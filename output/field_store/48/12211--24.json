The second General Conference of the Church opened at Fayette, on the  1st day of September, 1830. Joseph Smith presided, and he was supported  by the presence, the faith and prayers of nearly all the members of the  Church. The Conference lasted three days and was remarkable for the  power of the Spirit which was exhibited.    At the Conference Joseph Smith showed one of his greatest  characteristics, which was an especial willingness to meet any issue  which might be involved within his labor as a prophet, or his life as  an individual. He had already won Oliver Cowdery and the Whitmers to  a rejection of the destroying revelations enunciated by Hiram Page;  and Hiram, himself, had abandoned these false manifestations. But the  Prophet knew that the people must learn within their own individual  experience to be guided by holy influence, and to know the voice of  Christ and for their individual rejection, the tempting whisper of the  evil one. His confidence in the inspiration which flowed from Heaven,  and then from heart to heart within the congregation, was not mistaken.  Every soul present at this Conference, realized for himself that Satan  had been lying in wait to ensnare the feet of God's children, and to  bring upon their heads a greater condemnation than the unbelieving  world could know. Therefore the conference officially and unanimously  renounced the false and pernicious doctrines sought to be foisted upon  the Church, and heard with joyful acceptance the revelation from God  declaring that His commands should come only through His Prophet.    The men who held the holy Priesthood in the new and everlasting  covenant were learning to love each other with a love greater than  that of brothers. Separated from the world no less by its hatred and  murderous persecution than by their own determination to keep the  commandments of God, they realized that they must seek within each  other's society on earth the comfort and peace necessary to sustain  them through the waters of tribulation. And at this Conference was felt  an unspeakable influence of union and mutual regard. People attracted  by the wondrous tidings, had come from afar to Fayette, and many  of them listened and believed. Baptisms for the remission of sins,  confirmations, for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and ordinations to power  and Priesthood, were numerous, and the sacrament was administered to  every person who was present claiming membership in the body of Christ.  Faith and hope and charity abounded in the midst of the congregation of  Israel.    Revelations to David Whitmer, Peter Whitmer, Jun., and John Whitmer,  and to Thomas B. Marsh, were received through the Prophet, announcing  the will of the Lord concerning these brethren. Of Peter Whitmer it was  decreed of God that he should soon journey with Oliver Cowdery towards  the land of the Lamanites. David was rebuked for being worldly-minded;  and he was ordered to attend to the ministry in the Church and before  the people dwelling in the regions around about Fayette, until the Lord  should give unto him further commandments.    The revelation formerly given through the Prophet to Oliver Cowdery,  enunciating the divine decree concerning the Lamanites and the work to  be accomplished among them, created great interest in the minds of the  elders of the Church. The desire to learn more of this important matter  was intensified by the harmony which prevailed during the Conference,  and the flow of the Spirit resulting therefrom. Joseph and his brethren  realized that the purposes of God toward the Indians of this land  were great and far-reaching; and that the time would come when they  must receive the gospel and enjoy its blessings. Many of the elders  expressed a desire to take up the work of the ministry among their  brethren bound in darkness and ignorance through the curse laid upon  their fathers; but before appointing any one to aid Oliver and Peter  Whitmer in this mission, Joseph inquired of the Lord. His answer was  a revelation appointing unto Parley P. Pratt and Ziba Peterson that  they should go with Oliver and Peter into the wilderness, among the  Lamanites. Our Lord and Savior promised them that He would go with them  and be in their midst, and that nothing should prevail against them;  but they were commanded to pretend to no power or revelation except  that which was given to them by God, and unfolded by the Holy Spirit to  their understanding.    In the month of October, 1830, the elders appointed to this work  departed from Fayette, carrying with them a copy of the revelations  concerning their mission. Their mission was more than to journey  westward to the land of the Lamanites; for each one of them was also  under the special command and ordination to proclaim the gospel of  Jesus Christ to every listening ear. And from the hour that they  departed from Fayette, they lifted up their voices by the wayside and  left their testimony in every village through which they passed.    In this same month of October a revelation was given through the  Prophet to Ezra Thayer and Northrop Sweet, calling them to labor in  the vineyard, for the eleventh hour had come. They were promised  that speech sacred and powerful, should be given unto them, if they  would have faith to open their mouths before congregations. And in  November, 1830, Orson Pratt, a youth of 19 years, a brother of Parley  P. Pratt--came from his home in Canaan, New York, to Fayette, to ask of  the Lord for light and help concerning his individual duty. The Prophet  complied with the youth's desire and inquired of the Lord for him; and  in response a revelation was given in Orson's behalf, which has since  had a wondrous fulfilment in his life:        Blessed are you, because you are called of me to preach my gospel.      * * * * For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, the time is      soon at hand that I shall come in a cloud with power and great      glory, and it shall be a day at the time of my coming for all      nations to tremble. But before that great day shall come, the      sun shall be darkened and the moon be turned into blood, and the      stars shall refuse their shining, and some shall fall, and great      destructions await the wicked. Wherefore, lift up your voice and      spare not, for the Lord God hath spoken. Therefore prophesy and it      shall be given by the power of the Holy Ghost.    These revelations to individuals concerning their duty were necessary  in that hour. Men, however faithful and devoted to the Church, had not  yet learned the order of the gospel and its requirements upon them.  And, that they might not be suffered to rest in their own ignorance  and led astray by the whiles of Satan, the Lord, through His Prophet,  marked out the plain path which they were to follow. The rich heritage  of knowledge, which belongs now to every faithful member of the Church,  had to be gained little by little through long and continuous prayer to  God, by the early acceptors of the Gospel.    The Lord suffered none to go astray for lack of commandment. And,  in the subsequent history of the men whose names appear as early  recipients of Divine revelation, can be traced their faithfulness  to Heavenly requirement, or their yielding to the whispers of the  evil one. The Lord in His revelation through Joseph Smith gave a  mission to Orson Pratt which was nobly fulfilled. No less particular  and comprehensive was His commandment to other elders, but in many  instances far different was the result.    The work which the Prophet directed under these revelations shows  that the plan decreed by God for the building up of His Church was  understood by Joseph. Viewed from a human standpoint, the intention  of the Prophet to send missionaries throughout all the land, bearing  proclamation concerning the new Church, would have been a surprising  ambition. What was he that he should declare a gathering-place in the  west; that he should command men to lay down their daily toil, and go  forth as ministers proclaiming religious truth to a skeptical world;  that he should decree the building up of a city upon the Lamanite  borders? Had Joseph Smith, at the hour when he sent forth Oliver  Cowdery and Parley P. Pratt, with their companions into the western  wilderness, made avowal of such intentions, prompted by vanity and  a self-conceived desire to give himself and his cause prominence,  complete and humiliating would have been his failure. But if the  declaration which he made had originated from such a source, he could  not have been subjected to greater ridicule than fell upon him when  he avowed that he and his coadjutors were but fulfilling the will of  God--who would not suffer His purposes to fail one jot or tittle. To  call men untrained by education and special preparation to go forth  without purse or scrip, to preach the gospel, was a departure from  accustomed methods that in many minds excited derision and contempt.  True, this was the practice in apostolic days, and was the course taken  by the Savior in the calling and sending out of His disciples, but the  fashion had become obsolete. Education had become more essential for  ministers than the Holy Ghost; a salary than a faith that would trust  the Lord to supply food and clothing.    Teaching of the doctrine of the gathering, also was a new announcement  to the world. The belief common in Christendom was that man was as near  to God in one place as another, and He could be worshiped everywhere  alike. The idea, therefore of converts abandoning home, with all  its delightful associations and ancestral memories, and going to a  new land, remote from kindred and friends, as a religious duty was  a startling one and came in contact with all pre-conceived"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5999"],[0,"Guy Mannering; or, The Astrologer — Complete (#18)"],[1,"shealings which they  inhabited. This protection they were said anciently to have repaid by  service to the Laird in war, or more frequently, by infesting or  plundering the lands of those neighbouring barons with whom he chanced to  be at feud. Latterly their services were of a more pacific nature. The  women spun mittens for the lady, and knitted boot-hose for the Laird,  which were annually presented at Christmas with great form. The aged  sibyls blessed the bridal bed of the Laird when he married, and the  cradle of the heir when born. The men repaired her ladyship's cracked  china, and assisted the Laird in his sporting parties, wormed his dogs,  and cut the ears of his terrier puppies. The children gathered nuts in  the woods, and cranberries in the moss, and mushrooms on the pastures,  for tribute to the Place. These acts of voluntary service, and  acknowledgments of dependence, were rewarded by protection on some  occasions, connivance on others, and broken victuals, ale, and brandy  when circumstances called for a display of generosity; and this mutual  intercourse of good offices, which had been carried on for at least two  centuries, rendered the inhabitants of Derncleugh a kind of privileged  retainers upon the estate of Ellangowan. 'The knaves' were the Laird's  'exceeding good friends'; and he would have deemed himself very ill used  if his countenance could not now and then have borne them out against the  law of the country and the local magistrate. But this friendly union was  soon to be dissolved.    The community of Derncleugh, who cared for no rogues but their own, were  wholly without alarm at the severity of the Justice's proceedings towards  other itinerants. They had no doubt that he determined to suffer no  mendicants or strollers in the country but what resided on his own  property, and practised their trade by his immediate permission, implied  or expressed. Nor was Mr. Bertram in a hurry to exert his newly-acquired  authority at the expense of these old settlers. But he was driven on by  circumstances.    At the quarter-sessions our new Justice was publicly upbraided by a  gentleman of the opposite party in county politics, that, while he  affected a great zeal for the public police, and seemed ambitious of the  fame of an active magistrate, he fostered a tribe of the greatest rogues  in the country, and permitted them to harbour within a mile of the house  of Ellangowan. To this there was no reply, for the fact was too evident  and well known. The Laird digested the taunt as he best could, and in his  way home amused himself with speculations on the easiest method of  ridding himself of these vagrants, who brought a stain upon his fair fame  as a magistrate. Just as he had resolved to take the first opportunity of  quarrelling with the pariahs of Derncleugh, a cause of provocation  presented itself.    Since our friend's advancement to be a conservator of the peace, he had  caused the gate at the head of his avenue, which formerly, having only  one hinge, remained at all times hospitably open--he had caused this  gate, I say, to be newly hung and handsomely painted. He had also shut up  with paling, curiously twisted with furze, certain holes in the fences  adjoining, through which the gipsy boys used to scramble into the  plantations to gather birds' nests, the seniors of the village to make a  short cut from one point to another, and the lads and lasses for evening  rendezvous--all without offence taken or leave asked. But these halcyon  days were now to have an end, and a minatory inscription on one side of  the gate intimated 'prosecution according to law' (the painter had spelt  it 'persecution'--l'un vaut bien l'autre) to all who should be found  trespassing on these inclosures. On the other side, for uniformity's  sake, was a precautionary annunciation of spring-guns and man-traps of  such formidable powers that, said the rubrick, with an emphatic nota  bene--'if a man goes in they will break a horse's leg.'    In defiance of these threats, six well-grown gipsy boys and girls were  riding cock-horse upon the new gate, and plaiting may-flowers, which it  was but too evident had been gathered within the forbidden precincts.  With as much anger as he was capable of feeling, or perhaps of assuming,  the Laird commanded them to descend;--they paid no attention to his  mandate: he then began to pull them down one after another;--they  resisted, passively at least, each sturdy bronzed varlet making himself  as heavy as he could, or climbing up as fast as he was dismounted.    The Laird then called in the assistance of his servant, a surly fellow,  who had immediate recourse to his horsewhip. A few lashes sent the party  a-scampering; and thus commenced the first breach of the peace between  the house of Ellangowan and the gipsies of Derncleugh.    The latter could not for some time imagine that the war was real; until  they found that their children were horsewhipped by the grieve when found  trespassing; that their asses were poinded by the ground-officer when  left in the plantations, or even when turned to graze by the roadside,  against the provision of the turnpike acts; that the constable began to  make curious inquiries into their mode of gaining a livelihood, and  expressed his surprise that the men should sleep in the hovels all day,  and be abroad the greater part of the night.    When matters came to this point, the gipsies, without scruple, entered  upon measures of retaliation. Ellangowan's hen-roosts were plundered, his  linen stolen from the lines or bleaching-ground, his fishings poached,  his dogs kidnapped, his growing trees cut or barked. Much petty mischief  was done, and some evidently for the mischief's sake. On the other hand,  warrants went forth, without mercy, to pursue, search for, take, and  apprehend; and, notwithstanding their dexterity, one or two of the  depredators were unable to avoid conviction. One, a stout young fellow,  who sometimes had gone to sea a-fishing, was handed over to the captain  of the impress service at D--; two children were soundly flogged, and one  Egyptian matron sent to the house of correction.    Still, however, the gipsies made no motion to leave the spot which they  had so long inhabited, and Mr. Bertram felt an unwillingness to deprive  them of their ancient 'city of refuge'; so that the petty warfare we have  noticed continued for several months, without increase or abatement of  hostilities on either side.              CHAPTER  VIII       So the red Indian, by Ontario's side,       Nursed hardy on the brindled panther's hide,       As fades his swarthy race, with anguish sees       The white man's cottage rise beneath the trees;       He leaves the shelter of his native wood,       He leaves the murmur of Ohio's flood,       And forward rushing in indignant grief,       Where never foot has trod the fallen leaf,       He bends his course where twilight reigns sublime.       O'er forests silent since the birth of time.              SCENES OF INFANCY.      In tracing the rise and progress of the Scottish Maroon war, we must not  omit to mention that years had rolled on, and that little Harry Bertram,  one of the hardiest and most lively children that ever made a sword and  grenadier's cap of rushes, now approached his fifth revolving birthday. A  hardihood of disposition, which early developed itself, made him already  a little wanderer; he was well acquainted with every patch of lea ground  and dingle around Ellangowan, and could tell in his broken language upon  what baulks grew the bonniest flowers, and what copse had the ripest  nuts. He repeatedly terrified his attendants by clambering about the  ruins of the old castle, and had more than once made a stolen excursion  as far as the gipsy hamlet.    On these occasions he was generally brought back by Meg Merrilies, who,  though she could not be prevailed upon to enter the Place of Ellangowan  after her nephew had been given up to the press-gang, did not apparently  extend her resentment to the child. On the contrary, she often contrived  to waylay him in his walks, sing him a gipsy song, give him a ride upon  her jackass, and thrust into his pocket a piece of gingerbread or a  red-cheeked apple. This woman's ancient attachment to the family,  repelled and checked in every other direction, seemed to rejoice in  having some object on which it could yet repose and expand itself. She  prophesied a hundred times, 'that young Mr. Harry would be the pride o'  the family, and there hadna been sic a sprout frae the auld aik since the  death of Arthur Mac-Dingawaie, that was killed in the battle o' the  Bloody Bay; as for the present stick, it was good for nothing but  fire-wood.' On one occasion, when the child was ill, she lay all night  below the window, chanting a rhyme which she believed sovereign as a  febrifuge, and could neither be prevailed upon to enter the house nor to  leave the station she had chosen till she was informed that the crisis  was over.    The affection of this woman became matter of suspicion, not indeed to the  Laird, who was never hasty in suspecting evil, but to his wife, who had  indifferent health and poor spirits. She was now far advanced in a second  pregnancy, and, as she could not walk abroad herself, and the woman who  attended upon Harry was young and thoughtless, she prayed Dominie Sampson  to undertake the task of watching the boy in his rambles, when he should  not be otherwise accompanied. The Dominie loved his young charge, and was  enraptured with his own success in having already brought him so far in  his learning as to spell words of three syllables. The idea of this early  prodigy of erudition being carried off by the gipsies, like a second Adam  Smith,[Footnote: The father of Economical Philosophy was, when a child,  actually carried off by gipsies, and remained some hours in their  possession.] was not to be tolerated; "]]]
