On this account the art did not advance so  quickly as it might otherwise have done, among the Florentine and other  artists of the fourteenth century, who flourished after Giotto. In the  several cities above mentioned, Giotto invariably appears superior when  seen in the vicinity of such painters as Cavallini, or Gaddi; and  whoever is acquainted with his style, stands in no need of a prolix  account of that of his followers, which, with a general resemblance to  him, is less grand and less agreeable. Stefano Fiorentino alone is a  superior genius in the opinion of Vasari, according to whose account he  greatly excelled Giotto in every department of painting. He was the son  of Catherine, a daughter of Giotto, and possessed a genius for  penetrating into the difficulties of the art, and an insuperable desire  of conquering them. He first introduced foreshortenings into painting,  and if in this he did not attain his object, he greatly improved the  perspective of buildings, the attitudes, and the variety and expression  of the heads. According to Landino he was called the _Ape of Nature_, an  eulogy of a rude age; since such animals, in imitating the works of man,  always debase them: but Stefano endeavoured to equal and to embellish  those of nature. The most celebrated of his pictures which were in the  _Ara Coeli_ at Rome, in the church of S. Spirito at Florence, and in  other places, have all perished. As far as I know, his country does not  possess one of his undoubted pictures; unless we mention as such, that  of the Saviour in the Campo Santo of Pisa, which, indeed, is in a  greater manner than the works of this master, but it has been retouched.  A _Pieta_, by his son and disciple Tommaso, as is believed by some,  exists in S. Remigi at Florence, which strongly partakes of the manner  of Giotto; like his frescos at Assisi. He deserved the name of Giottino,  given him by his fellow citizens, who used to say that the soul of  Giotto had transmigrated, and animated him. Baldinucci alleges that  there was another of the same name, who should not be confounded with  him, and quotes the following inscription from a picture in the Villa  Tolomei, \"Dipinse Tommaso di Stefano Fortunatino de' Gucci Tolomei.\" But  Cinelli, the strenuous opponent of Baldinucci, attributes it, perhaps  justly, to Giottino. This artist left behind him one Lippo, sufficiently  commended by Vasari, but who rather seems to have been an imitator than  a scholar. Giovanni Tossicani of Arezzo, was a disciple of Giottino,  employed in Pisa and over all Tuscany. He painted the St. Philip and St.  James, which still remain on the baptismal font in Arezzo, and were  repaired by Vasari while a young man, who acknowledges that he learned  much from this work, injured as it was. With him perished the best  branch of the stock of Giotto.    Taddeo Gaddi may be considered as the Giulio Romano of Giotto, his most  intimate and highly favoured pupil. Vasari, who saw his frescos and  easel pictures at Florence, in good preservation, prefers him to his  master, in colouring and in delicacy; but the lapse of time at this day  forbids our deciding this point, although several of his pictures  remain, especially in the church of Santa Croce, which are scriptural  histories, much in the manner of Giotto. He discovered more originality  in the chapter house of the Spagnuoli, where he worked in competition  with Memmi.[64] He painted some of the acts of the Redeemer on the  ceiling, and the descent of the Holy Spirit in the refectory, which is  among the finest specimens of art in the fourteenth century. On one of  the walls he painted the Sciences, and under each some one of its  celebrated professors; and demonstrated his excellence in this species  of allegorical painting, which approaches so nearly to poetry. The  brilliance and clearness of his tints are chiefly conspicuous in that  chapter house. The royal gallery contains the taking down of Christ, the  work of his hands, which was formerly at Orsanmichele, and by some  ascribed to Buffalmacco, merely because it was unascertained. Taddeo  flourished beyond the term assigned him by Vasari, and outlived most of  those already named. This may be collected from Franco Sacchetti, a  contemporary writer, who relates in his 136th Tale, that Andrea Orcagna  proposed as a question, \"who was the greatest master, setting Giotto out  of the question?\" Some answered Cimabue, others Stefano, some Bernardo,  and some Buffalmacco. Taddeo Gaddi, who was in the company, said, \"truly  these were very able painters, but the art is decaying every day, &c.\"  He is mentioned up to 1352, and he might possibly survive several years.    He left at his death several disciples, who became eminent teachers of  painting in Florence, and other places. D. Lorenzo Camaldolese is  mentioned with honour. He instructed pupils in the art; and several old  pictures by him and his scholars are in the monastery of the Angeli. At  that time the fraternity of Camaldulites furnished some miniature  painters, one of whom, named D. Silvestro, ornamented missals, which  still exist, and are amongst the best that Italy possesses. The most  favoured pupils of Taddeo were Giovanni da Milano, whom I shall notice  in the school of Lombardy, and Jacopo di Casentino, who also will find a  place there, together with his imitators. To these two he recommended on  his death-bed his two sons and disciples: Giovanni, who died  prematurely, with a reputation for genius; and Angiolo, who being then  very young, most needed a protector. The latter died, according to  Vasari, at 63 years of age; in 1589, according to the date of  Baldinucci. He did not improve the art in proportion to his abilities,  but contented himself with imitating Giotto and his father, in which he  was astonishingly successful. The church of S. Pancrazio possessed one  picture by him, containing several saints, and some histories from the  Gospel, which may still be seen in the monastery, divided into several  pieces, and coloured in a taste superior to what was then usual. There  is another in the same style in the sacristy of the Conventual friars,  by whom he was employed in the choir of the church, to paint in fresco  the story of the recovery of the Cross, and its transportation in the  time of Heraclius; a work inferior to the others, because much larger,  and to him somewhat new. He afterwards lived at Venice, as a merchant  rather than as a painter; and Baldinucci, who seizes every opportunity  of supporting his hypothesis, says, that if he was not the founder of  that school, he, at least, improved it. But I shall demonstrate, in the  proper place, that the Venetian school was advancing to a modern style,  before Angiolo could have taught in that place; and in the many old  pictures I saw at Venice, I was unable to recal to mind the delicate  style of Angiolo. The Venetians owe to him the education of Stefano da  Verona, whom I shall consider in the second volume; and he gave the  Florentines Cennino Cennini, praised by Vasari as a colourist, of whom  as a writer I shall soon make mention.    In the school of Angiolo Gaddi we may reckon Antonio Veneziano,  concerning whom Vasari and Baldinucci disagree. The former makes him a  Venetian, \"who came to Florence to learn painting of Agnolo Gaddi:\" the  latter, a systematic writer, as we have seen, asserts that he was born  in Florence, and that he obtained the surname of Veneziano, from his  residence and many labours in Venice, on the authority of certain  memoirs in the Strozzi library, which were, perhaps, doubted by himself;  for had they been of high authority, he would not have omitted to  proclaim their antiquity. However this may be, each of them is a little  inconsistent with himself. As they assert that Antonio died of the  plague in 1384, or, according to the correction of their annotators, in  1383, at the age of 74, it follows that he was born many years before  Gaddi, whose disciple, therefore, we cannot easily suppose him. It is  likewise rendered doubtful by his design in the legends of S.  Ranieri,[65] which remain in the Campo Santo of Pisa, where there is a  certain facility, care, and caprice in the composition, that savour of  another school. Vasari, moreover, notices a method of painting in  fresco, without ever re-touching it when dry, that would seem to have  been introduced from other parts, different from what was employed by  the Tuscan artists, his competitors, whose paintings, in the time of the  historian, were not in as good a state of preservation as those of  Antonio. In the same place he deposited his portrait, which the  describers of the ducal gallery at Florence pretend still to find in the  chamber of celebrated artists. This portrait is, however, painted in a  manner so modern, that I cannot believe it the work of a painter so  ancient. On this occasion I must observe that there was another Antonio  Veneziano, whom this picture probably represents, and who, about the  year 1500, painted, at Osimo, a picture of St. Francis, in the manner of  that age, and inscribed it with his name. I learned this from the  accomplished Sig. Cav. Aqua, who added, that this name had been erased,  and that of Pietro Perugino inserted, who certainly gains no very great  honour by such substitution.    We learn from history[66] that Antonio educated in Paolo Uccello, a  great artist in perspective; and in Gherardo Starnina, a master in the  gay style, of whom there are yet some remnants, in a chapel of the  church of Santa Croce. They are among the last efforts of the school of  Giotto, which succeeding artists abandoned, to adopt a better manner.  One exception occurs in Antonio Vite, who executed some works in the old  style, in Pistoia, his native city, and in Pisa. I may here observe,  that Starnina and Dello Fiorentino shortly after"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34501"],[0,"Wolf and Coyote Trapping: An Up-to-Date Wolf Hunter's Guide (#18)"],[1,"g. I choke them with a small  rope. Do not skin carcass nearer than 200 yards of setting. I use  gloves always in handling bait or traps. I never go nearer than is  absolutely necessary to see that they are not sprung. My line this  spring, 1902, was 30 miles long. I went over it every other day,  catching 43 coyotes in 6 weeks. I have never lost any coyotes by  twisting feet off. When using square setting, they most always have  two or more feet caught. I lose game and traps frequently by being  lifted by human coyotes. I pull my traps up about the middle of May,  then go to cruising after their dens.\"      [Illustration: A Northern Coyote.]    The following method, submitted by another northwestern trapper is  practically the same: \"My outfit consists of the following: 60 No. 3  Newhouse single spring otter traps (I find they will hold any wolf  and are easier to set than double spring traps), axe, 60 stakes 16 or  18 inches long, 12 or 15 pounds of wool or cotton, wool preferred, 20  stakes 10 or 12 inches long. A piece of oilcloth or canvas about 3  feet square, a light wagon and team, a 30-30 Savage rifle and four  stag hounds. The hounds are trained to stay on the wagon until told  to go, and will nearly always get a coyote when sent after him.\"    \"In setting traps I choose a high knoll or a bare spot on the range  and often the bed of a dry creek, where I see plenty of signs and  then proceed as follows: Stick one of the small stakes where I want  the bait and from 20 to 24 inches from it, I lay a trap and stretch  the chain straight back, drive stake through chain ring and drive  down below the surface of the ground an inch or more, then fix two  more traps the same way at the opposite points of a triangle, set  your traps and place a good wad of wool under the pan so that rabbits  and other small game will not spring it, then proceed to bed the  traps, and chains, placing all the dirt on the canvas. Now place your  bait (I always use live bait if weather is not too cold but have had  good success with dead bait). Lay an old dead hen or other fowl in  the center and drive small stakes through it into the ground, firmly,  cover the end of stake with wing or feathers of bait. Now step back  and take dirt from the canvas and cover traps 1/2 to 5/8 inches deep,  also cover your own tracks and brush over well with a brush. If traps  are well set, it will be hard to tell where they lay. All dirt that  is left on canvas should be taken away some distance and dropped.\"    \"In using live bait, proceed the same way with traps, only bait  should be tied by the feet with a good, stout cord and place a can of  corn and one of water within reach of fowl, both cans to be set into  the ground even with surface. Do not go nearer to traps than to see  they are not sprung and do not shoot or club game in traps but choke  to death with a copper wire on the end of a pole; a good stout cord  will answer the same purpose. Wipe all blood off traps before setting  again and brush out your tracks as before, and above all don't spit  tobacco juice near your traps.\"    \"Never set your trap by your bait; the bait is there to attract the  animal,\" says a Colorado trapper. \"When setting traps at your bait  you only catch two or three, and by this time all the coyotes in the  country have seen their comrades' doom at this particular place, and  will stay clear of the place in the future.\"    \"Find where there is a dead horse or cow in a draw, or some place  where there are a number of trails leading toward it. Coyotes always  travel on trails whenever they have the chance, in order to save  their feet. Find where the trail goes thru some brush or high grass.  Here is the place to conceal your traps, five in number, in the  trail. Set them so they will take in eight feet of the trail, and  there is no animal that can pass over these traps without stepping in  one or more; fasten each trap with a pin eight inches long if the  ground is frozen, and if not, the pin should be longer. If there is  snow on the ground, put a piece of cotton under the pan and brush  snow over them; if there is no snow, dig the trap down level with the  ground, put a piece of paper over them and cover lightly with fine  dirt. Use No. 3 Hawley & Norton or Newhouse traps.\"    \"Use the same method for wolf; you need no bait for him. Find where  he travels in a trail. He travels this trail every four or five days,  take note of this and see if I am not right. Use No. 4 Newhouse or  Hawley & Norton trap, with a heavy short chain and a good sized pin.  When setting traps, take a piece of hide small enough to tie on the  bottom of your shoes, and when within a hundred yards of the place  where the traps are to be set, tie the hides on the soles of your  shoes. Always use clean buckskin gloves when handling your traps.\"    \"When you catch anything, move your traps a hundred yards or so, and  reset. A coyote or wolf tears the ground up so that others get  suspicious. If you have the chance to set traps horseback, take a  hide and tie a rope on it, take this along, and when setting traps,  throw this on the ground and step off on to the hide to set traps.  When thru, get on your horse and pull the hide up with the rope. I  learned this method from two of the best coyote and wolf trappers in  Wyoming.\"    The following is from Joseph Casper, an Oregon trapper: \"We have  here, the coyote, wild cat, lynx, mountain lion and bear, but no grey  wolves. Coyotes are plentiful, and I have seen as many as 6 or 8 at  one time. A good way to trap them is by dragging the carcass of a  sheep or pig through shallow ponds and set the traps in the water.  The coyotes will follow the trail and will wade around in the water,  looking for the bait. Traps may also be set by the side of some dead  animal after the coyotes have been eating at it, or small pieces of  meat or lard cracklings may be scattered around the trap. When  setting traps on dry land, I would advise using some good wolf scent,  to smother the human odor. I use the No. 3 Newhouse and No. 4 Hawley  & Norton traps.\"    W. L. Williamson, a Montana trapper, in telling his experiences gives  the following:    \"Take some rabbits, chickens or other bait and make a drag out of it;  dragging the bait from the horn of the saddle, and about every half  mile, set two No. 4 Victor or No. 3 Newhouse traps in the trail and  about 6 inches apart. Have a sheep skin to stand on when setting the  traps, and do not step on the ground. Place all loose dirt on the  sheepskin and after the traps are set and covered, get on your horse  and lift the skin by cords, attached to the corners. Carry the loose  dirt away from the setting.\"      [Illustration: An Idaho Coyote.]    This set is good for both grey wolves and coyotes:    \"One day I went to the slaughter house, got a fresh cow head and took  it about three miles away, placing it in the center of a small flat.  I set several traps around it and the next morning I had a nice grey  wolf, caught by two feet.\"    \"When my father had his cattle down on our lower ranch, the coyotes  killed a young calf one morning, so I took four Victor traps and set  around it, and by 4 o'clock, I had two coyotes. I reset the traps and  the next morning I had another one.\"    The trapping methods given in the following pages are from expert  trappers of all parts of the central and northern portions of the  coyote range.    \"We have a $1.00 bounty on coyotes and $5.00 on wolves in this state  (Wyoming) besides a stockmen's bounty in certain districts, ranging  from $1.00 to $2.50 on coyotes, and $15.00 to $35.00 on wolves. I  find the best way to find coyotes here is to go out in the open  country where the sheep men run their sheep in winter, and when I can  find a camp that has just been vacated by a band of sheep, I always  figure on getting from one to five coyotes on that ground, as there  is most always some dead carcasses left behind, and a good, dry place  to set in.\"    \"My method of setting is this, I have all my traps with the chains  cut off to about six inches and a swivel on the end, and use a long  iron pin about 5/8 inches in diameter. Usually, I take a part of a  sheep with the hide on, and so place it as to leave but one natural  way into it, where two traps put about ten inches apart will make it  impossible for a coyote to get at it without being pinched. One can  always find natural runways thru the sage brush, to make such sets.\"    \"I also use the trail set a good deal, and always drag a piece of  sheep pelt along from the pack horse. I use a pack horse most all the  time, besides a saddle horse, and have two twenty-five mile circles  out, with about thirty-five traps to each circle. In this way, I get  from 75 to 150 coyotes every winter. The ground is too dry to freeze  here, so I bury traps, pins, and use paper over and under jaws.\"    \"A dead sure way to get a coyote every time is this, I can kill sage  hens most any time, and always carry some on the pack horse. When it  comes time to eat, first dig a hole to bury trap in and build a sage  brush fire in it and singe a few of the feathers and some of the  flesh in it, and set in the ashes. Who ever saw a camp fire that  didn't have coyote tracks around it?\"      * * *    \"My way of trapping coyotes is to go to some prairie dog town and  find an unused hole or one that has been filled up. Chop out a small  hole two or three inches deep, then dig three trenches for the  chains, then three holes for the traps, which must not be too deep  nor too shallow. This requires practice and good judgment. They must  be deep enough to allow the trap to be covered half an inch with dirt  or sand, and still be even with the surrounding surface. Any deeper  is too deep.\"    \"Put a large piece of wool under the pan, and cover jaws, pan and all  with a piece of heavy paper or light cloth, to keep the dirt from  getting under the trap pan.
