She had a rather markedly aggressive look,  queenly perhaps, but not very comfortable.    But there is no species of self-hypnotism equal to that of a man  who gazes persistently at a photograph with the preconceived idea  that he is in love with the original of it. Little by little Bill  found that the old feeling began to return. He persevered. By the  end of a quarter of an hour he had almost succeeded in capturing  anew that first fine careless rapture which, six months ago, had  caused him to propose to Claire and walk on air when she accepted  him.    He continued the treatment throughout the day, and by dinner-time  had arranged everything with his conscience in the most satisfactory  manner possible. He loved Claire with a passionate fervour; he  liked Elizabeth very much indeed. He submitted this diagnosis to  conscience, and conscience graciously approved and accepted it.    It was Sunday that day. That helped. There is nothing like Sunday  in a foreign country for helping a man to sentimental thoughts of  the girl he has left behind him elsewhere. And the fact that there  was a full moon clinched it. Bill was enabled to go for an  after-dinner stroll in a condition of almost painful loyalty to Claire.    From time to time, as he walked along the road, he took out the  photograph and did some more gazing. The last occasion on which he  did this was just as he emerged from the shadow of a large tree  that stood by the roadside, and a gush of rich emotion rewarded  him.    'Claire!' he murmured.    An exclamation at his elbow caused him to look up. There, leaning  over a gate, the light of the moon falling on her beautiful face,  stood Claire herself!          12      In trying interviews, as in sprint races, the start is everything.  It was the fact that she recovered more quickly from her  astonishment that enabled Claire to dominate her scene with Bill.  She had the advantage of having a less complicated astonishment to  recover from, for, though it was a shock to see him there when she  had imagined that he was in New York, it was not nearly such a  shock as it was to him to see her here when he had imagined that  she was in England. She had adjusted her brain to the situation  while he was still gaping.    'Well, Bill?'    This speech in itself should have been enough to warn Lord Dawlish  of impending doom. As far as love, affection, and tenderness are  concerned, a girl might just as well hit a man with an axe as say  'Well, Bill?' to him when they have met unexpectedly in the  moonlight after long separation. But Lord Dawlish was too shattered  by surprise to be capable of observing _nuances_. If his love had  ever waned or faltered, as conscience had suggested earlier in the  day, it was at full blast now.    'Claire!' he cried.    He was moving to take her in his arms, but she drew back.    'No, really, Bill!' she said; and this time it did filter through  into his disordered mind that all was not well. A man who is a  good deal dazed at the moment may fail to appreciate a remark like  'Well, Bill?' but for a girl to draw back and say, 'No, really,  Bill!' in a tone not exactly of loathing, but certainly of pained  aversion, is a deliberately unfriendly act. The three short words,  taken in conjunction with the movement, brought him up with as  sharp a turn as if she had punched him in the eye.    'Claire! What's the matter?'    She looked at him steadily. She looked at him with a sort of  queenly woodenness, as if he were behind a camera with a velvet  bag over his head and had just told her to moisten the lips with  the tip of the tongue. Her aspect staggered Lord Dawlish. A  cursory inspection of his conscience showed nothing but purity and  whiteness, but he must have done something, or she would not be  staring at him like this.    'I don't understand!' was the only remark that occurred to him.    'Are you sure?'    'What do you mean?'    'I was at Reigelheimer's Restaurant--Ah!'    The sudden start which Lord Dawlish had given at the opening words  of her sentence justified the concluding word. Innocent as his  behaviour had been that night at Reigelheimer's, he had been glad  at the time that he had not been observed. It now appeared that he  had been observed, and it seemed to him that Long Island suddenly  flung itself into a whirling dance. He heard Claire speaking a  long way off: 'I was there with Lady Wetherby. It was she who  invited me to come to America. I went to the restaurant to see her  dance--and I saw you!'    With a supreme effort Bill succeeded in calming down the excited  landscape. He willed the trees to stop dancing, and they came  reluctantly to a standstill. The world ceased to swim and flicker.    'Let me explain,' he said.    The moment he had said the words he wished he could recall them.  Their substance was right enough; it was the sound of them that  was wrong. They sounded like a line from a farce, where the erring  husband has been caught by the masterful wife. They were  ridiculous. Worse than being merely ridiculous, they created an  atmosphere of guilt and evasion.    'Explain! How can you explain? It is impossible to explain. I saw  you with my own eyes making an exhibition of yourself with a  horrible creature in salmon-pink. I'm not asking you who she is.  I'm not questioning you about your relations with her at all. I  don't care who she was. The mere fact that you were at a public  restaurant with a person of that kind is enough. No doubt you  think I am making a great deal of fuss about a very ordinary  thing. You consider that it is a man's privilege to do these  things, if he can do them without being found out. But it ended  everything so far as I am concerned. Am I unreasonable? I don't  think so. You steal off to America, thinking I am in England, and  behave like this. How could you do that if you really loved me?  It's the deceit of it that hurts me.'    Lord Dawlish drew in a few breaths of pure Long Island air, but he  did not speak. He felt helpless. If he were to be allowed to  withdraw into the privacy of the study and wrap a cold, wet towel  about his forehead and buckle down to it, he knew that he could  draft an excellent and satisfactory explanation of his presence at  Reigelheimer's with the Good Sport. But to do it on the spur of  the moment like this was beyond him.    Claire was speaking again. She had paused for a while after her  recent speech, in order to think of something else to say; and  during this pause had come to her mind certain excerpts from one  of those admirable articles on love, by Luella Delia Philpotts,  which do so much to boost the reading public of the United States  into the higher planes. She had read it that afternoon in the  Sunday paper, and it came back to her now.    'I may be hypersensitive,' she said, dropping her voice from the  accusatory register to the lower tones of pathos, 'but I have such  high ideals of love. There can be no true love where there is not  perfect trust. Trust is to love what--'    She paused again. She could not remember just what Luella Delia  Philpotts had said trust was to love. It was something extremely  neat, but it had slipped her memory.    'A woman has the right to expect the man she is about to marry to  regard their troth as a sacred obligation that shall keep him as  pure as a young knight who has dedicated himself to the quest of  the Holy Grail. And I find you in a public restaurant, dancing  with a creature with yellow hair, upsetting waiters, and  staggering about with pats of butter all over you.'    Here a sense of injustice stung Lord Dawlish. It was true that  after his regrettable collision with Heinrich, the waiter, he had  discovered butter upon his person, but it was only one pat. Claire  had spoken as if he had been festooned with butter.    'I am not angry with you, only disappointed. What has happened has  shown me that you do not really love me, not as I think of love.  Oh, I know that when we are together you think you do, but absence  is the test. Absence is the acid-test of love that separates the  base metal from the true. After what has happened, we can't go on  with our engagement. It would be farcical. I could never feel that  way toward you again. We shall always be friends, I hope. But as  for love--love is not a machine. It cannot be shattered and put  together again.'    She turned and began to walk up the drive. Hanging over the top of  the gate like a wet sock, Lord Dawlish watched her go. The  interview was over, and he could not think of one single thing to  say. Her white dress made a patch of light in the shadows. She  moved slowly, as if weighed down by sad thoughts, like one who, as  Luella Delia Philpotts beautifully puts it, paces with measured  step behind the coffin of a murdered heart. The bend of the drive  hid her from his sight.    About twenty minutes later Dudley Pickering, smoking sentimentally  in the darkness hard by the porch, received a shock. He was musing  tenderly on his Claire, who was assisting him in the process by  singing in the drawing-room, when he was aware of a figure, the  sinister figure of a man who, pressed against the netting of the  porch, stared into the lighted room beyond.    Dudley Pickering's first impulse was to stride briskly up to the  intruder, tap him on the shoulder, and ask him what the devil he  wanted; but a second look showed him that the other was built on  too ample a scale to make this advisable. He was a large,  fit-looking intruder.    Mr Pickering was alarmed. There had been the usual epidemic of  burglaries that season. Houses had been broken into, valuable  possessions removed. In one case a negro butler had been struck  over the head with a gas-pipe and given a headache. In these  circumstances, it was unpleasant to find burly strangers looking  in at windows.

My attention  became absorbed by the group of three Rajputs before me--by the two  shield bearers and their master. I cannot tell why I was specially  attracted at this moment by the sight of the long hair of the servants,  which was waving in the wind, though the place they occupied was  comparatively sheltered. I turned my eyes upon their Sahib, and the  blood in my veins stood still. The veil of somebody's topi, which hung  beside him, tied to a pillar, was simply whirling in the wind, while the  hair of the Sahib himself lay as still as if it had been glued to his  shoulders, not a hair moved, nor a single fold of his light muslin  garment. No statue could be more motionless. What is this then? I said  to myself. Is it delirium? Is this a hallucination, or a wonderful  inexplicable reality? I shut my eyes, telling myself I must look no  longer. But a moment later I again looked up, startled by a crackling  sound from above the steps. The long, dark silhouette of some animal  appeared at the entrance, clearly outlined against the pale sky. I saw  it in profile. Its long tail was lashing to and fro. Both the servants  rose swiftly and noiselessly and turned their heads towards Gulab-Sing,  as if asking for orders. But where was Gulab-Sing? In the place which,  but a moment ago, he occupied, there was no one. There lay only the  topi, torn from the pillar by the wind. I sprang up: a tremendous roar  deafened me, filling the vihara, wakening the slumbering echoes, and  resounding, like the softened rumbling of thunder, over all the borders  of the precipice. Good heavens! A tiger!    Before this thought had time to shape itself clearly in my mind, the  sleepers sprang up and the men all seized their guns and revolvers, and  then we heard the sound of crashing branches, and of something heavy  sliding down into the precipice. The alarm was general.    \"What is the matter now?\" said the calm voice of Gulab-Sing, and I again  saw him on the stone bench. \"Why should you be so frightened?\"    \"A tiger! Was it not a tiger?\" came in hasty, questioning tones from  Europeans and Hindus.    Miss X---- trembled like one stricken with fever. \"Whether it was a  tiger, or something else, matters very little to us now. Whatever it  was, it is, by this time, at the bottom of the abyss,\" answered the  Rajput yawning.    \"I wonder the Government does not destroy all these horrid animals,\"  sobbed poor Miss X----, who evidently believed firmly in the omnipotence  of her Executive.    \"But how did you get rid of the 'striped one'?\" insisted the colonel.  \"Has anyone fired a shot?\"    \"You Europeans think that shooting is, if not the only, at least the  best way to get rid of wild animals. We possess other means, which are  sometimes more efficacious than guns,\" explained Babu Narendro-Das Sen.  \"Wait until you come to Bengal, there you will have many opportunities  to make acquaintance with the tigers.\"    It was now getting light, and Gulab-Sing proposed to us to descend and  examine the rest of the caves and the ruins of a fortress before the day  became too hot, so, at half-past three, we went by another and easier  way to the valley, and, happily, this time we had no adventures. The  Mahratti did not accompany us. He disappeared without informing us  whither he was going.        We saw Logarh, a fortress which was captured by Sivaji from the Moguls  in 1670, and the ruins of the hall, where the widow of Nana Farnavese,  under the pretext of an English protectorate, became de facto the  captive of General Wellesley in 1804, with a yearly pension of 12,000  rupees. We then started for the village of Vargaon, once fortified and  still very rich. We were to spend the hottest hours of the day there,  from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, and proceed  afterwards to the historical caves of Birsa and Badjah, about three  miles from Karli.    At about two P.M. when, in spite of the huge punkahs waving to and fro,  we were grumbling at the heat, appeared our friend the Mahratta Brahman,  whom we thought we had lost on the way. Accompanied by half-a-dozen  Daknis (inhabitants of the Dekhan plateau) he was slowly advancing,  seated almost on the ears of his horse, which snorted and seemed very  unwilling to move. When he reached the verandah and jumped down, we  saw the reason of his disappearance. Across the saddle was tied a huge  tiger, whose tail dragged in the dust. There were traces of dark blood  in his half opened mouth. He was taken from the horse and laid down by  the doorstep.    Was it our visitor of the night before? I looked at Gulab-Sing. He  lay on a rug in a corner, resting his head on his hand and reading. He  knitted his brows slightly, but did not say a word. The Brahman who  had just brought the tiger was very silent too, watching over certain  preparations, as if making ready for some solemnity. We soon learned  that, in the eyes of a superstitious people, what was about to happen  was a solemnity indeed.    A bit of hair cut from the skin of a tiger that has been killed, neither  by bullet, nor by knife, but by a \"word,\" is considered the best of all  talismans against his tribe.    \"This is a very rare opportunity,\" explained the Mahratti. \"It is very  seldom that one meets with a man who possesses the word. Yogis and  Sadhus do not generally kill wild animals, thinking it sinful to destroy  any living creature, be it even a cobra or a tiger, so they simply keep  out of the way of noxious animals. There exists only one brotherhood in  India whose members possess all secrets, and from whom nothing in nature  is concealed. Here is the body of the tiger to testify that the animal  was not killed with a weapon of any kind, but simply by the word of  Gulab-Lal-Sing. I found it, very easily, in the bushes exactly under our  vihara, at the foot of the rock over which the tiger had rolled, already  dead. Tigers never make false steps. Gulab-Lal-Sing, you are a Raj-Yogi,  and I salute you!\" added the proud Brahman, kneeling before the Takur.    \"Do not use vain words, Krishna Rao!\" interrupted Gulab-Sing. \"Get up;  do not play the part of a Shudra.\"    \"I obey you, Sahib, but, forgive me, I trust my own judgment. No  Raj-Yogi ever yet acknowledged his connection with the brotherhood,  since the time Mount Abu came into existence.\"    And he began distributing bits of hair taken from the dead animal. No  one spoke, I gazed curiously at the group of my fellow-travelers. The  colonel, President of our Society, sat with downcast eyes, very pale.  His secretary, Mr. Y----, lay on his back, smoking a cigar and looking  straight above him, with no expression in his eyes. He silently accepted  the hair and put it in his purse. The Hindus stood round the tiger,  and the Sinhalese traced mysterious signs on its forehead. Gulab-Sing  continued quietly reading his book.----      The Birza cave, about six miles from Vargaon, is constructed on the  same plan as Karli. The vault-like ceiling of the temple rests upon  twenty-six pillars, eighteen feet high, and the portico on four,  twenty-eight feet high; over the portico are carved groups of horses,  oxen, and elephants, of the most exquisite beauty. The \"Hall of  Initiation\" is a spacious, oval room, with pillars, and eleven very deep  cells cut in the rock. The Bajah caves are older and more beautiful.  Inscriptions may still be seen showing that all these temples were built  by Buddhists, or, rather, by Jainas. Modern Buddhists believe in one  Buddha only, Gautama, Prince of Kapilavastu (six centuries before  Christ) whereas the Jainas recognize a Buddha in each of their  twenty-four divine teachers (Tirthankaras) the last of whom was the Guru  (teacher) of Gautama. This disagreement is very embarrassing when people  try to conjecture the antiquity of this or that vihara or chaitya. The  origin of the Jaina sect is lost in the remotest, unfathomed antiquity,  so the name of Buddha, mentioned in the inscriptions, may be attributed  to the last of the Buddhas as easily as to the first, who lived (see  Tod's genealogy) a long time before 2,200 B.C.    One of the inscriptions in the Baira cave, for instance, in cuneiform  characters, says: \"From an ascetic in Nassik to the one who is worthy,  to the holy Buddha, purified from sins, heavenly and great.\"    This tends to convince scientists that the cave was cut out by  Buddhists.    Another inscription, in the same cave, but over an-other cell, contains  the following: \"An agreeable offering of a small gift to the moving  force [life], to the mind principle [soul], the well-beloved material  body, fruit of Manu, priceless treasure, to the highest and here  present, Heavenly.\"    Of course the conclusion is drawn that the building does not belong to  the Buddhists, but to the Brahmans, who believe in Manu.    Here are two more inscriptions from Bajah caves.    \"An agreeable gift of the symbol and vehicle of the purified Saka-Saka.\"    \"Gift of the vehicle of Radha [wife of Krishna, symbol of perfection] to  Sugata who is gone for ever.\"    Sugata, again, is one of the names of Buddha. A new contradiction!    It was somewhere here, in the neighborhood of Vargaon, that the  Mahrattis seized Captain Vaughan and his brother, who were hanged after  the battle of Khirki.    Next morning we drove to Chinchor, or, as it is called here, Chinchood.  This place is celebrated in the annals of the Dekkan. Here one meets  with a repetition in miniature of what takes place on a larger scale  at L'hassa in Tibet. As Buddha incarnates in every new Dalai-Lama, so,  here, Gunpati (Ganesha, the god of wisdom with the elephant's head) is  allowed by his father Shiva to incarnate in the eldest son of a certain  Brahman family. There is a splendid temple erected in his honor, where  the avatars (incarnations) of Gunpati have lived and received"]]]
