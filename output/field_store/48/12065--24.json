"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38404"],[0,"A Journey from Prince of Wales's Fort in Hudson's Bay to the Northern Ocean in (#18)"],[1," the  Northward, it was the thirteenth of May before we could procure any. On  that day the Indians killed two swans and three geese. This in some  measure alleviated our distress, which at that time was very great;  having had no other subsistence for five or six days, than a few  cranberries, that we gathered from the dry ridges where the snow was  thawed away in spots; for though we set our fishing-nets in the best  judged places, and angled at every part that was likely to afford  success, we only caught three small fish during the whole time. Many of  the Northern Indians, who had joined us on the 24th of April, remained  in our company for some time; and though I well knew they had had a  plentiful winter, and had then good stocks of dried meat by them, and  {27} were also acquainted with our distress, they never gave me or my  Southern companions the least supply, although they had in secret amply  provided for our Northern guides.    [Sidenote: 19th.]    [Sidenote: 23d.]    [Sidenote: 1770. May.]    By the nineteenth, the geese, swans, ducks, gulls, and other birds of  passage, were so plentiful, that we killed every day as many as were  sufficient for our support; and having stopped a few days to recruit our  spirits after so long a fast, on the twenty-third we began once more to  proceed toward the barren ground. Sossop having now perfectly recovered  from his late misfortune, everything seemed to have a favourable  appearance; especially as my crew had been augmented to twelve persons,  by the addition of one of my guide's wives, and five others, whom I had  engaged to assist in carrying our luggage; and I well knew, from the  season of the year, that hauling would soon be at an end for the summer.      The thaws having been by this time so great as to render travelling in  the woods almost impracticable, we continued our course to the East on  Seal River, about sixteen miles farther, when we came to a small river,  and a string of lakes connected with it, that tended to the North.    [Sidenote: June. 1st.]    The weather for some time was remarkably fine and pleasant. Game of all  kinds was exceedingly plentiful, {28} and we continued our course to the  Northward on the above river and lakes till the first of June, when we  arrived at a place called Beralzone.[34] In our way thither, beside  killing more geese than was necessary, we shot two deer. One of my  companions had now the misfortune to shatter his hand very much by the  bursting of a gun; but as no bones were broken, I bound up the wound,  and with the assistance of some of Turlington's drops, yellow basilicon,  &c., which I had with me, soon restored the use of his hand; so that in  a very short time he seemed to be out of all danger.    [Sidenote: 4th.]    After stopping a few days at Beralzone, to dry a little venison and a  few geese, we again proceeded to the Northward on the barren ground; for  on our leaving this place we soon got clear of all the woods.    [Sidenote: 5th.]    [Sidenote: 6th.]    [Sidenote: 10th.]    [Sidenote: 1770. June.]    The snow was by this time so soft as to render walking in snow-shoes  very laborious; and though the ground was bare in many places, yet at  times, and in particular places, the snow-drifts were so deep, that we  could not possibly do without them. By the sixth, however, the thaws  were so general, and the snows so much melted, that as our snow-shoes  were attended with more trouble than service, we all consented to throw  them away. Till the tenth, our sledges proved serviceable, particularly  in crossing lakes and ponds on the ice; but that mode of travelling now  growing dangerous on account of the great thaws, we {29} determined to  throw away our sledges, and every one to take a load on his back.    This I found to be much harder work than the winter carriage, as my part  of the luggage consisted of the following articles, viz. the quadrant  and its stand, a trunk containing books, papers, &c., a land-compass,  and a large bag containing all my wearing apparel; also a hatchet,  knives, files, &c., beside several small articles, intended for presents  to the natives. The awkwardness of my load, added to its great weight,  which was upward of sixty pounds, and the excessive heat of the weather,  rendered walking the most laborious task I had ever encountered; and  what considerably increased the hardship, was the badness of the road,  and the coarseness of our lodging, being, on account of the want of  proper tents, exposed to the utmost severity of the weather. The tent we  had with us was not only too large, and unfit for barren ground service,  where no poles were to be got, but we had been obliged to cut it up for  shoes, and each person carried his own share. Indeed my guide behaved  both negligently and ungenerously on this occasion; as he never made me,  or my Southern Indians, acquainted with the nature of pitching tents on  the barren ground; which had he done, we could easily have procured a  set of poles before we left the woods. He took care, however, to procure  a set for himself and his wife; and when the tent was divided, though he  made shift to get a piece large enough to serve him for {30} a complete  little tent, he never asked me or my Southern Indians to put our heads  into it.    Beside the inconvenience of being exposed to the open air, night and  day, in all weathers, we experienced real distress from the want of  victuals. When provisions were procured, it often happened that we could  not make a fire, so that we were obliged to eat the meat quite raw;  which at first, in the article of fish particularly, was as little  relished by my Southern companions as myself.    [Sidenote: 1770. June.]    Notwithstanding these accumulated and complicated hardships, we  continued in perfect health and good spirits; and my guide, though a  perfect niggard of his provisions, especially in times of scarcity, gave  us the strongest assurance of soon arriving at a plentiful country,  which would not only afford us a certain supply of provisions, but where  we should meet with other Indians, who probably would be willing to  carry part of our luggage. This news naturally gave us great  consolation; for at that time the weight of our constant loads was so  great, that when Providence threw any thing in our way, we could not  carry above two days provisions with us, which indeed was the chief  reason of our being so frequently in want.    [Sidenote: 23d.]    From the twentieth to the twenty-third we walked every day near twenty  miles, without any other subsistence {31} than a pipe of tobacco, and a  drink of water when we pleased: even partridges and gulls, which some  time before were in great plenty, and easily procured, were now so  scarce and shy, that we could rarely get one; and as to geese, ducks,  &c., they had all flown to the Northward to breed and molt.    [Sidenote: 1770. June.]    Early in the morning of the twenty-third, we set out as usual, but had  not walked above seven or eight miles before we saw three musk-oxen  grazing by the side of a small lake. The Indians immediately went in  pursuit of them; and as some of them were expert hunters, they soon  killed the whole of them. This was no doubt very fortunate; but, to our  great mortification, before we could get one of them skinned, such a  fall of rain came on, as to put it quite out of our power to make a  fire; which, even in the finest weather, could only be made of moss, as  we were near an hundred miles from any woods. This was poor comfort for  people who had not broke their fast for four or five days. Necessity,  however, has no law; and having been before initiated into the method of  eating raw meat, we were the better prepared for this repast: but this  was by no means so well relished, either by me or the Southern Indians,  as either raw venison or raw fish had been: for the flesh of the musk-ox  is not only coarse and tough, but smells and tastes so strong of musk as  to make it very disagreeable when raw, though it is tolerable eating  when properly cooked. The weather continued so {32} remarkably bad,  accompanied with constant heavy rain, snow, and sleet, and our  necessities were so great by the time the weather permitted us to make a  fire, that we had nearly eat to the amount of one buffalo quite raw.    Notwithstanding I mustered up all my philosophy on this occasion, yet I  must confess that my spirits began to fail me. Indeed our other  misfortunes were greatly aggravated by the inclemency of the weather,  which was not only cold, but so very wet that for near three days and  nights, I had not one dry thread about me. When the fine weather  returned, we made a fire, though it was only of moss, as I have already  observed; and having got my cloaths dry, all things seemed likely to go  on in the old channel, though that was indifferent enough; but I  endeavoured, like a sailor after a storm, to forget past misfortunes.    [Sidenote: 1770. June.]    None of our natural wants, if we except thirst, are so distressing, or  hard to endure, as hunger; and in wandering situations, like that which  I now experienced, the hardship is greatly aggravated by the uncertainty  with respect to its duration, and the means most proper to be used to  remove it, as well as by the labour and fatigue we must necessarily  undergo for that purpose, and the disappointments which too frequently  frustrate our best concerted plans and most strenuous exertions: it not  only enfeebles the body, but depresses the spirits, in spite of {33}  every effort to prevent it. Besides, for want of action, the stomach so  far loses its digestive powers, that after long fasting it resumes its  office with pain and reluctance. During this journey I have too  frequently experienced the dreadful effects of this calamity, and more  than once been reduced to so low a state by hunger and fatigue, that  when Providence threw any thing in my"]]]
