For in the ratio  of the tension is the pulse of the heart, fuller, stronger, and  more frequent as that acts more vigorously, still preserving the  rhythm and volume, and order of the heart's contractions. Nor is  it to be expected that because of the motion of the blood, the  time at which the contraction of the heart takes place, and that  at which the pulse in an artery (especially a distant one) is  felt, shall be otherwise than simultaneous: it is here the same  as in blowing up a glove or bladder; for in a plenum (as in a  drum, a long piece of timber, etc.) the stroke and the motion  occur at both extremities at the same time. Aristotle, [Footnote:  De Anim., iii, cap. 9.] too, has said, \"the blood of all animals  palpitates within their veins (meaning the arteries), and by the  pulse is sent everywhere simultaneously.\" And further, [Footnote:  De Respir., cap. 20] \"thus do all the veins pulsate together and  by successive strokes, because they all depend upon the heart;  and, as it is always in motion, so are they likewise always  moving together, but by successive movements.\" It is well to  observe with Galen, in this place, that the old philosophers  called the arteries veins. I happened upon one occasion to have a  particular case under my care, which plainly satisfied me of the  truth: A certain person was affected with a large pulsating  tumour on the right side of the neck, called an aneurism, just at  that part where the artery descends into the axilla, produced by  an erosion of the artery itself, and daily increasing in size;  this tumour was visibly distended as it received the charge of  blood brought to it by the artery, with each stroke of the heart;  the connexion of parts was obvious when the body of the patient  came to be opened after his death. The pulse in the corresponding  arm was small, in consequence of the greater portion of the blood  being diverted into the tumour and so intercepted.    Whence it appears that whenever the motion of the blood through  the arteries is impeded, whether it be by compression or  infarction, or interception, there do the remote divisions of the  arteries beat less forcibly, seeing that the pulse of the  arteries is nothing more than the impulse or shock of the blood  in these vessels.          CHAPTER IV    OF THE MOTION OF THE HEART AND ITS AURICLES, AS SEEN IN THE  BODIES OF LIVING ANIMALS      Besides the motions already spoken of, we have still to consider  those that appertain to the auricles.    Caspar Bauhin and John Riolan, [Footnote: i Bauhin, lib. ii. cap.  II. Riolan. lib. viii, cap. I.] most learned men and skilful  anatomists, inform us that from their observations, that if we  carefully watch the movements of the heart in the vivisection of  an animal, we shall perceive four motions distinct in time and in  place, two of which are proper to the auricles, two to the  ventricles. With all deference to such authority I say that there  are four motions distinct in point of place, but not of time; for  the two auricles move together, and so also do the two  ventricles, in such wise that though the places be four, the  times are only two. And this occurs in the following manner:    There are, as it were, two motions going on together: one of the  auricles, another of the ventricles; these by no means taking  place simultaneously, but the motion of the auricles preceding,  that of the heart following; the motion appearing to begin from  the auricles and to extend to the ventricles. When all things are  becoming languid, and the heart is dying, as also in fishes and  the colder blooded animals there is a short pause between these  two motions, so that the heart aroused, as it were, appears to  respond to the motion, now more quickly, now more tardily; and at  length, when near to death, it ceases to respond by its proper  motion, but seems, as it were, to nod the head, and is so  slightly moved that it appears rather to give signs of motion to  the pulsating auricles than actually to move. The heart,  therefore, ceases to pulsate sooner than the auricles, so that  the auricles have been said to outlive it, the left ventricle  ceasing to pulsate first of all; then its auricle, next the right  ventricle; and, finally, all the other parts being at rest and  dead, as Galen long since observed, the right auricle still  continues to beat; life, therefore, appears to linger longest in  the right auricle. Whilst the heart is gradually dying, it is  sometimes seen to reply, after two or three contractions of the  auricles, roused as it were to action, and making a single  pulsation, slowly, unwillingly, and with an effort.    But this especially is to be noted, that after the heart has  ceased to beat, the auricles however still contracting, a finger  placed upon the ventricles perceives the several pulsations of  the auricles, precisely in the same way and for the same reason,  as we have said, that the pulses of the ventricles are felt in  the arteries, to wit, the distension produced by the jet of  blood. And if at this time, the auricles alone pulsating, the  point of the heart be cut off with a pair of scissors, you will  perceive the blood flowing out upon each contraction of the  auricles. Whence it is manifest that the blood enters the  ventricles, not by any attraction or dilatation of the heart, but  by being thrown into them by the pulses of the auricles.    And here I would observe, that whenever I speak of pulsations as  occurring in the auricles or ventricles, I mean contractions:  first the auricles contract, and then and subsequently the heart  itself contracts. When the auricles contract they are seen to  become whiter, especially where they contain but little blood;  but they are filled as magazines or reservoirs of the blood,  which is tending spontaneously and, by its motion in the veins,  under pressure towards the centre; the whiteness indicated is  most conspicuous towards the extremities or edges of the auricles  at the time of their contractions.    In fishes and frogs, and other animals which have hearts with but  a single ventricle, and for an auricle have a kind of bladder  much distended with blood, at the base of the organ, you may very  plainly perceive this bladder contracting first, and the  contraction of the heart or ventricle following afterwards.    But I think it right to describe what I have observed of an  opposite character: the heart of an eel, of several fishes, and  even of some (of the higher) animals taken out of the body,  pulsates without auricles; nay, if it be cut in pieces the  several parts may still be seen contracting and relaxing; so that  in these creatures the body of the heart may be seen pulsating  and palpitating, after the cessation of all motion in the  auricle. But is not this perchance peculiar to animals more  tenacious of life, whose radical moisture is more glutinous, or  fat and sluggish, and less readily soluble? The same faculty  indeed appears in the flesh of eels, which even when skinned and  embowelled, and cut into pieces, are still seen to move.    Experimenting with a pigeon upon one occasion, after the heart  had wholly ceased to pulsate, and the auricles too had become  motionless, I kept my finger wetted with saliva and warm for a  short time upon the heart, and observed that under the influence  of this fomentation it recovered new strength and life, so that  both ventricles and auricles pulsated, contracting and relaxing  alternately, recalled as it were from death to life.    Besides this, however, I have occasionally observed, after the  heart and even its right auricle had ceased pulsating,--when it  was in articulo mortis in short,--that an obscure motion, an  undulation or palpitation, remained in the blood itself, which  was contained in the right auricle, this being apparent so long  as it was imbued with heat and spirit. And, indeed, a  circumstance of the same kind is extremely manifest in the course  of the generation of animals, as may be seen in the course of the  first seven days of the incubation of the chick: A drop of blood  makes its appearance which palpitates, as Aristotle had already  observed; from this, when the growth is further advanced and the  chick is fashioned, the auricles of the heart are formed, which  pulsating henceforth give constant signs of life. When at length,  and after the lapse of a few days, the outline of the body begins  to be distinguished, then is the ventricular part of the heart  also produced, but it continues for a time white and apparently  bloodless, like the rest of the animal; neither does it pulsate  or give signs of motion. I have seen a similar condition of the  heart in the human foetus about the beginning of the third month,  the heart then being whitish and bloodless, although its auricles  contained a considerable quantity of purple blood. In the same  way in the egg, when the chick was formed and had increased in  size, the heart too increased and acquired ventricles, which then  began to receive and to transmit blood.    And this leads me to remark that he who inquires very  particularly into this matter will not conclude that the heart,  as a whole, is the primum vivens, ultimum moriens,--the first  part to live, the last to die,--but rather its auricles, or the  part which corresponds to the auricles in serpents, fishes, etc.,  which both lives before the heart and dies after it.    Nay, has not the blood itself or spirit an obscure palpitation  inherent in it, which it has even appeared to me to retain after  death? and it seems very questionable whether or not we are to  say that life begins with the palpitation or beating of the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5697"],[0,"Tales of Chinatown (#18)"],[1,"was absolutely  nothing to indicate that anyone had surreptitiously entered or departed  from my chambers.    I returned to the study and sat gazing at the revolver lying on the  blotting-pad before me. Perhaps my mind worked slowly, but I think that  fully fifteen minutes must have passed before it dawned on me that the  explanation not only of the missing pigtail but of the other incidents  of the night, was simple enough. The yellow man had been a fabrication,  and my dark-eyed visitor had not been in quest of \"Raphael Philips,\" but  in quest of the pigtail: and her quest had been successful!    \"What a hopeless fool I am!\" I cried, and banged my fist down upon the  table, \"there was no yellow man at all--there was-----\"    My door bell rang. I sprang nervously to my feet, glanced at the  revolver on the table--and finally dropped it into my coat pocket ere  going out and opening the door.    On the landing stood a police constable and an officer in plain clothes.    \"Your name is Malcolm Knox?\" asked the constable, glancing at a  note-book which he held in his hand.    \"It is,\" I replied.    \"You are required to come at once to Bow Street to identify a woman  who was found murdered in a taxi-cab in the Strand about eleven o'clock  to-night.\"    I suppressed an exclamation of horror; I felt myself turning pale.    \"But what has it to do------\"    \"The driver stated she came from your chambers, for you saw her off, and  her last words to you were 'Good night, Mr. Knox, I am sincerely sorry  to have given you all this trouble.' Is that correct, sir?\"    The constable, who had read out the information in an official voice,  now looked at me, as I stood there stupefied.    \"It is,\" I said blankly. \"I'll come at once.\" It would seem that I had  misjudged my unfortunate visitor: her story of the yellow man on the  stair had apparently been not a fabrication, but a gruesome fact!          III    HOW I REGAINED IT        My ghastly duty was performed; I had identified the dreadful thing,  which less than an hour before had been a strikingly beautiful woman,  as my mysterious visitor. The police were palpably disappointed at the  sparsity of my knowledge respecting her. In fact, had it not chanced  that Detective Sergeant Durham was in the station, I think they would  have doubted the accuracy of my story.    As a man of some experience in such matters, I fully recognized its  improbability, but beyond relating the circumstances leading up to my  possession of the pigtail and the events which had ensued, I could do  no more in the matter. The weird relic had not been found on the dead  woman, nor in the cab.    Now the unsavoury business was finished, and I walked along Bow Street,  racking my mind for the master-key to this mystery in which I was become  enmeshed. How I longed to rush off to Harley's rooms in Chancery Lane  and to tell him the whole story! But my friend was a thousand miles  away--and I had to see the thing out alone.    That the pigtail was some sacred relic stolen from a Chinese temple and  sought for by its fanatical custodians was a theory which persistently  intruded itself. But I could find no place in that hypothesis for the  beautiful Jewess; and that she was intimately concerned I did not doubt.  A cool survey of the facts rendered it fairly evident that it was she  and none other who had stolen the pigtail from my rooms. Some third  party--possibly the \"yellow man\" of whom she had spoken--had in turn  stolen it from her, strangling her in the process.    The police theory of the murder (and I was prepared to accept it) was  that the assassin had been crouching in hiding behind or beside the  cab--or even within the dark interior. He had leaped in and attacked the  woman at the moment that the taxi-man had started his engine; if already  inside, the deed had proven even easier. Then, during some block in the  traffic, he had slipped out unseen, leaving the body of the victim to be  discovered when the cab pulled up at the hotel.    I knew of only one place in London where I might hope to obtain useful  information, and for that place I was making now. It was Malay Jack's,  whence I had been bound on the previous night when my strange meeting  with the seaman who then possessed the pigtail had led to a change of  plan. The scum of the Asiatic population always come at one time or  another to Jack's, and I hoped by dint of a little patience to achieve  what the police had now apparently despaired of achieving--the discovery  of the assassin.    Having called at my chambers to obtain my revolver, I mounted an  eastward-bound motor-bus. The night, as I have already stated, was  exceptionally dark. There was no moon, and heavy clouds were spread over  the sky; so that the deserted East End streets presented a sufficiently  uninviting aspect, but one with which I was by no means unfamiliar and  which certainly in no way daunted me.    Changing at Paul Harley's Chinatown base in Wade Street, I turned my  steps in the same direction as upon the preceding night; but if my  own will played no part in the matter, then decidedly Providence  truly guided me. Poetic justice is rare enough in real life, yet I was  destined to-night to witness swift retribution overtaking a malefactor.    The by-ways which I had trodden were utterly deserted; I was far from  the lighted high road, and the only signs of human activity that reached  me came from the adjacent river; therefore, when presently an outcry  arose from somewhere on my left, for a moment I really believed that my  imagination was vividly reproducing the episode of the night before!    A furious scuffle--between a European and an Asiatic--was in progress  not twenty yards away!    Realizing that such was indeed the case, and that I was not the victim  of hallucination, I advanced slowly in the direction of the sounds,  but my footsteps reechoed hollowly from wall to wall of the narrow  passage-way, and my coming brought the conflict to a sudden and dramatic  termination.    \"Thought I wouldn't know yer ugly face, did yer?\" yelled a familiar  voice. \"No good squealin'--I got yer! I'd bust you up if I could!\"  (a sound of furious blows and inarticulate chattering) \"but it ain't  'umanly possible to kill a Chink------\"    I hurried forward toward the spot where two dim figures were locked in  deadly conflict.    \"Take that to remember me by!\" gasped the husky voice as I ran up.    One of the figures collapsed in a heap upon the ground. The other  made off at a lumbering gait along a second and even narrower passage  branching at right angles from that in which the scuffle had taken  place.    The clatter of the heavy sea-boots died away in the distance. I stood  beside the fallen man, looking keenly about to right and left; for an  impression was strong upon me that another than I had been witness of  the scene--that a shadowy form had slunk back furtively at my approach.  But the night gave up no sound in confirmation of this, and I could  detect no sign of any lurker.    I stooped over the Chinaman (for a Chinaman it was) who lay at my feet,  and directed the ray of my pocket-lamp upon his yellow and contorted  countenance. I suppressed a cry of surprise and horror.    Despite the human impossibility referred to by the missing fireman, this  particular Chinaman had joined the shades of his ancestors. I think that  final blow, which had felled him, had brought his shaven skull in  such violent contact with the wall that he had died of the thundering  concussion set up.    Kneeling there and looking into his upturned eyes, I became aware that  my position was not an enviable one, particularly since I felt little  disposed to set the law on the track of the real culprit. For this  man who now lay dead at my feet was doubtless one of the pair who had  attempted the life of the fireman of the Jupiter.    That my seafaring acquaintance had designed to kill the Chinaman I did  not believe, despite his stormy words: the death had been an accident,  and (perhaps my morality was over-broad) I considered the assault to  have been justified.    Now my ideas led me further yet. The dead Chinaman wore a rough blue  coat, and gingerly, for I found the contact repulsive, I inserted  my hand into the inside pocket. Immediately my fingers closed upon a  familiar object--and I stood up, whistling slightly, and dangling in my  left hand the missing pigtail!    Beyond doubt Justice had guided the seaman's blows. This was the man who  had murdered my dark-eyed visitor!    I stood perfectly still, directing the little white ray of my flashlight  upon the pigtail in my hand. I realized that my position, difficult  before, now was become impossible; the possession of the pigtail  compromised me hopelessly. What should I do?    \"My God!\" I said aloud, \"what does it all mean?\"    \"It means,\" said a gruff voice, \"that it was lucky I was following you  and saw what happened!\"    I whirled about, my heart leaping wildly. Detective-Sergeant Durham was  standing watching me, a grim smile upon his face!    I laughed rather shakily.    \"Lucky indeed!\" I said. \"Thank God you're here. This pigtail is a  nightmare which threatens to drive me mad!\"    The detective advanced and knelt beside the crumpled-up figure on the  ground. He examined it briefly, and then stood up.    \"The fact that he had the missing pigtail in his pocket,\" he said, \"is  proof enough to my mind that he did the murder.\"    \"And to mine.\"    \"There's another point,\" he added, \"which throws a lot of light on the  matter. You and Mr. Harley were out of town at the time of the Huang  Chow case; but the Chief and I outlined it, you remember, one night in  Mr. Harley's rooms?\"    \"I remember it perfectly; the giant spider in the coffin------\"    \"Yes; and a certain Ah Fu, confidential servant of the old man, who used  to buy the birds the thing fed on.
