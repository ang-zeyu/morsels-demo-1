In referring to his own personal experience he said that one year ago  he was in the great city of London, presiding over the conference of  Saints in the metropolis, and officiating as first counselor to the  President of all the Churches in the British Empire--looking forward  with deep solicitude, anticipating the difficulties and dangers  that awaited him in crossing the boisterous ocean, and holding the  responsibility attendant on leading up to Zion a company of Saints; but  the Lord had brought him through most successfully; and we are here  together, enjoying the blessings of social life, etc., etc.    He said, the year upon which we are soon to enter will, probably,  release some of us from the difficulties into which the changes of the  past have placed us; it will open our path and make things clear before  us, but, perhaps we shall then meet other things of an unpleasant  nature, as consequent attendants on those circumstances, and that  scenery in which we may find ourselves.    He forcibly suggested the utility of suppressing all anxiety with  respect to the future, saying, \"How illy were we qualified one year ago  to pass through the scenes through which we have been led with success!  From which, let us realize the folly of an over anxiety to pry into  scenes that are lying before us, inasmuch as God will prepare the way  by a gradual process, step by step; and leading us forward in a manner  that will prove easy, as we pass along, but which, if presented to our  view at once, would seem insurmountable.\"    He said that inasmuch as we are disposed to do right, we may learn  from the past year's experience, that those things which we are called  to suffer, produce a very different effect upon the mind from what  we should anticipate if they were presented before us in prospect;  producing pleasure and satisfaction where we would look for misery.  While we reflect with astonishment on the past, we may be instructed  to set our hearts at rest with regard to the future; and also by  contrasting the situations of some present with our situations one  year ago, and taking into consideration our present enjoyments, we  find it practicable for the mind to rise superior to circumstance; by  having cultivated in our bosoms such principles as are calculated to  elevate the affections--bring the feelings into subjection and give  stability to the mind; thus producing happiness independent of outward  contingencies--possessing our happiness within ourselves.    He said, in taking a retrospective view of our lives, even from the  time we embraced the Gospel, although we had passed through some scenes  of severe trials, God had borne us off victoriously thus far, even to  our great astonishment and we may confidently trust in His guidance and  protection for the coming year!    I will here record a little circumstance which transpired a short time  after my brother returned from his English mission, as follows:    By request of Lieutenant General Joseph Smith for him to organize a  military company, which was to constitute a portion of the celebrated  \"Nauvoo Legion,\" Lorenzo proceeded at once. The company which he  organized was mostly composed of volunteers from the company of Saints  he had recently conducted from England. In the selection of officers,  he was chosen captain.    At their first parade they were inspected by Gen. Smith, by whom the  captain was highly complimented for the fine martial appearance and  good military maneuvering of his company. It would not be at all  surprising if an encomium from that source should arouse the long  dormant military spirit of a man, who, as his early history tells, had  so strikingly manifested a chivalrous vein in his \"make up.\" Suffice it  to say, the \"Legion\" claims the finale of Lorenzo's military tactics.    An interval occurred between the missionary travels of my brother,  which he decided to spend alternately between Nauvoo and the home of  our sister, Mrs. L. A. Morley.    Her home was in a small town called Lima, thirty miles south of Nauvoo.  A few families of the Saints had clustered there, but most of the  inhabitants were \"old settlers,\" and anti-Mormon in their feelings,  yet, when there was no uprising, very friendly and respectful to those  of our people who sojourned among them.    Knowing that Lorenzo was rather leisurely that winter, the trustees  solicited him to teach their district school. He consented, although,  at the time, he well knew that he was taking an elephant by the bitts.  The condition of that school was simply preposterous. A club of rough,  ungovernable, rowdy boys, for some time previous, had prided themselves  on whipping teachers and breaking up schools. The Saints being a small  minority, could exercise no authority to remedy the evil, and the \"old  settlers\" too indifferent on the subject of education to do so, and  the roughs carried the day, insomuch that no teacher had been able to  complete his term for some time before this, without serious difficulty.    Lorenzo was unaccustomed to defeat, and in this instance was willing  to risk the chances. In the first place, he must obtain a school  certificate of his moral character and proper qualifications, in order  to secure the share of public money to which the district was entitled.  Mr. Williams, a notorious mobocrat, was the one authorized to issue  certificates, and to him my brother applied. The examination was not  only brief, but very superficial--sufficiently so to exhibit Williams'  profound ignorance, which was truly amusing.    The day arrived--he opened school--the belligerents were at their post,  and as he proceeded in the arrangements, he noticed a half dozen of  those boys grouped together, eying and scrutinizing him in that kind  of earnestness that means business. Without a wise policy on his part,  a battle was inevitable. \"_Stoop to conquer_,\" was at this juncture  his watchword. Physically they had decidedly the advantage of him,  but mentally the advantage was altogether on his side. He resolved  to win respect by conferring it. \"_Love, and love only, is the loan  for love_,\" and he addressed those boys as though they were most  respectable gentlemen. Grown up without either moral or mental culture,  they were larger, and some of them perhaps older than himself.    He took especial pains to impress them with a sense of the interest he  felt in their behalf, and the efforts he purposed making to assist them  forward in their studies, with his peculiar faculty for teaching--the  ambition he felt in this direction, etc., etc. In this way, by kindness  and persuasion, their feelings relaxed--their confidence was won, and  with patient and continued exertions, the unscrupulous roughs were  transformed into respectful students; and long before the expiration of  the term, with surprising progress, they had become habitually studious.    The parents of those sons whom, through the wisdom that God had given,  my brother had _civilized, moralized_ and _mentalized_, were delighted  with the wonderful changes, and expressed their high appreciation and  deep gratitude for the interest he had taken in their behalf.    Patriarch Morley, the husband of our sister Leonora, presided over the  Saints at Lima. A few families, mostly his family connections, had  grouped together and formed a little neighborhood of their own, which  was known as the \"Morley Settlement.\" Here occurred the first violent  outbreak of hostilities against the Latter-day Saints in the State  of Illinois. It commenced in a sudden raid in which houses and other  conbustible property were burned, to that extent that the Saints had to  flee precipitately, and destitute, to Nauvoo, leaving their real estate  possessions to a heartless mob.        CHAPTER XIV.    The Prophet instructs the Twelve.--They appoint a Delegation to seek a  location for the Saints.--Lorenzo notified to be in readiness.--Change  intervenes.--An unprecedented apostacy.--Joseph Smith's  correspondence.--Calls for an expression from candidates for the  Presidency.--Copy of Appeal.--Disgusted with their responses.--Offers  himself as candidate.--Elders electioneer.--How Lorenzo  succeeds.--Terrible news--Assassination.--Mournful Elegy.--Meeting  mobocrats.    On the 20th of February, 1844, the Prophet Joseph Smith instructed the  Twelve Apostles to send a delegation and make explorations in Oregon  and California, and seek a good location to which we can remove after  the Temple is completed, and \"_where we can build a city in a day, and  have a government of our own_.\"    In accordance with the foregoing instructions, the Twelve appointed  the following committee: Jonathan Dunham, Phineas H. Young, David D.  Yearsley, David Fullmer, Alphonso Young, James Emmett, George D. Watt,  Daniel Spencer. Subsequently others, including Lorenzo Snow, were  called, and some volunteers were added to the above list.    Previous to this, the Prophet had remarked to me that he anticipated  moving to the Rocky Mountains with all his family, where he could live  in peace and worship God unmolested. But other scenes and prospects  awaited us. Ever busy change was hurrying onward to a fearful point.  The most inveterate apostacy that this Church has yet had to meet  was inaugurated in open rebellion against the authorities and the  Priesthood in general.    After the expulsion of the Latter-day Saints from the State of  Missouri, the authorities of the Church, from time to time, appealed  to the rulers of the nation for redress. When Martin Van Buren filled  the presidential chair, the Prophet Joseph, after acquainting His  Excellency with the causes of our grievances, received from our Chief  Magistrate the laconic response: \"_Your cause is just, but I can do  nothing for you_.\"    When the campaign of 1843 opened, Joseph Smith opened correspondence  with those brought forward as candidates for the presidency,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47730"],[0,"Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 1 of 2) (#18)"],[1,"conflict with the      established government and laws of these states and of the United      States while the great Christian denominations live in peace and      harmony under those same laws?\"    The gentleman would have shown better judgement than to have propounded  such a question as that. The Latter-day Saints suffered persecution  in both New York and Ohio, they were driven several times from their  homes in Missouri, and finally driven in a body--some twelve thousand  in number--from that state into Illinois, and later between twenty and  thirty thousand of them were driven from the state of Illinois. The  gentleman should remember that this all happened before plural marriage  was practiced in the Church [except in Nauvoo, where, in the last  years of his life, it was introduced by the prophet, but it was known  but by a few, and was neither the cause of his martyrdom nor of the  subsequent expulsion of his people]; and Mormons may defy not only your  correspondent but the whole world to instance any case where they were  persecuted or driven from their homes or murdered (as scores of them  were) for violation of the laws of the land in those states. And there  is yet to arise within these states or in the United States, however  much he may despise the Mormons and their faith, an apologist who is  bold enough to undertake the justification of those states in their  treatment of the Mormons, save only, perhaps, your correspondent, and  he only by cowardly imputation and innuendo.    _Salt Lake City, Utah, Sept. 26, 1903._        V.    WHICH OF THE SECTS HAS OPPOSED MORMONISM MOST?    FOREWORD.    This is a question frequently asked, but I do not remember that an  answer has been ever before put in print. It would be easy to record  the names of the ministers and the Christian sects to which they  belonged who began the agitation in Missouri which resulted in such  disgraceful scenes of mob-violence, robbery and murder, and the final  expulsion of from twelve to fifteen thousand people from their homes  and the state. It would only be a matter of time and space to set  down the names of the ministers and the sects they represented, who  began and continued that abominable campaign of slander and falsehood  which terminated in the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, and the  expulsion of more than twenty thousand Latter-day Saints from the  confines of the United States. But is it worth while? Is it not enough  to say that so-called ministers of the gospel quite generally took the  leading part in this opposition. They headed bands of men who burned  the homes of our people; they sat on drumhead militia court-martials  to try Joseph Smith, and condemned him to be shot in the public square  at Far West; it was a sectarian minister who led the mob that murdered  Joseph and Hyrum Smith at Carthage prison; it was a somewhat noted  preacher who led the mob forces against Nauvoo and expelled the aged,  the weak and helpless from that city after the great bulk of the  Mormon people had departed into the western wilderness in search of  new homes. So we might continue all down the line of our experience.  The mobbings in the southern states have quite generally been led by  so-called ministers of the gospel; as also all the unfriendly agitation  in Utah and elsewhere. But it isn't worth while to dwell too long in  our thought on these matters, or to take them too seriously. God has a  reward that will be ample for all those who have suffered martyrdom in  his cause, and those who have assailed it he doubtless will remember  in his own time and way, and we need not wish them any harm, and we  do not. If we could affect them in any way it would be to mitigate  their difficulties. For a man to carry with him through eternity the  recollection of an injustice he has inflicted upon the innocent; to  be compelled always to remember a murder committed, must of itself be  a terrible punishment. So I say if we could affect the persecutors of  the Saints in any way it would be to mitigate their sufferings, not  to increase them. We will try not to remember the wrongs of Missouri;  and will try to forget the fate of Nauvoo. We will remember only that  in those troublous days there were noble men, and women too, who  befriended our people and who did what they could to make light their  burdens and ease their sorrows--God bless them!    Which of the Sects Have Opposed Mormonism Most.    SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, Aug. 8, 1903.    _D. A. Holcomb, Esq., Dunlap, Iowa._    DEAR SIR:--Your letter of the 21st ult., addressed to President Joseph  F. Smith and Counselors, asking \"which one of the religious societies  has opposed the faith and doctrine of the Church the most,\" etc., has  been handed to me by President Smith, with a request that I answer your  questions.    In the first place I call your attention to the fact that it is not  a matter of astonishment or of any great amount of anxiety to us  that the churches of this world oppose the Church of Christ. It has  become a matter of course from our point of view, and really under the  circumstances we do not see how it could be otherwise, for the first  word of the Lord to Joseph Smith was to the effect that the churches of  the world were all wrong, that is, in error; that their professors of  religion drew near to the Lord with their lips while their hearts were  far from him; that they taught for doctrine the commandments of men,  and Joseph Smith was commanded to join none of them, for God did not  acknowledge them as his Church or kingdom. After such a declaration the  good will of sectarian Christendom was naturally out of the question,  yet, of course, the truth had to be told. The theological rubbish that  had accumulated for ages had to be swept away that the rocks of truth  might be made bare for the erection of that structure, the Temple of  God--the Church of Christ.    As to which of the several churches has been most opposed to the faith  and doctrines of the Church it would be difficult to say definitely,  except to say that up to the present time the Catholic Church has  not manifested any hostility' in any way as an organization. A few  individual Catholic prelates have had their fling at us, but I think  they have not passed resolutions against our organization, chiefly  for the reason, as I think, that we have done but little work as yet  in Catholic countries; and then, too, it is quite possible that the  Catholic clergy count us as one among the many protestant sects, and  think us no worse than the rest of what they consider the \"separated  brethren.\" As for the Protestant brood, you may take the Methodists,  Presbyterians, Baptists, Campbellites, and Josephites as the most  active of our opponents, judging from the fulminations they reel off  against us in the form of resolutions and petitions to Congress asking  that we be \"suppressed\" or \"crushed.\" It would be difficult to say  which of these is the most opposed. I think I am safe in saying they  are all about equally bitter, but thank the Lord there is no proportion  between their bitterness and their power to do us injury. The rest of  the Protestant sects give us but little trouble, at least in any formal  way, and the opposition expressed in frantic resolutions by those I  have named merely serve to make matters interesting and keep Mormonism  well to the fore in public attention; and as for \"annoyance\"--well,  it is hardly worth while being annoyed. Have you not read the golden  words, \"We can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth?\" and  that other saying, equally comforting to those who are called upon  to face the wrath of men for the kingdom of heaven's sake, \"Surely  the wrath of men shall praise thee; the remainder of wrath shalt thou  restrain?\" So we are very comfortable, thank you, and not worried and  not \"annoyed\" and not hurt by the opposition of men. We have the truth  and rejoice in it, and intend to make it known just as far as it is  possible for us to proclaim it. In our view those who oppose it, pass  resolutions against our faith and ourselves, are but God's advertising  agents, to present to the attention of the world the thing which he has  planted in the earth; and we amuse ourselves sometimes by thinking what  a surprised lot of fellows those sanctimonious divines who \"resolute\"  against us with such vigor will be when they wake up and discover that  they have helped instead of hindered God's work; but as for being  \"annoyed\"--pshaw!    Very truly yours.    B. H. ROBERTS.    * * * * * * * * * *    Looking through an old scrap book the other day, I found in it a  clipping from the \"Newark (New Jersey) News,\" containing a letter  from Salt Lake City, by J. Martin Miller, which describes in a very  admirable way the attitude of a Jewish Rabbi and a Catholic Bishop  toward the Mormon people, and as their attitude is one of fairness I  take pleasure in recording the evidence of it here. Mr. Miller's letter  to the \"Newark News\" was written about two months before my letter to  Mr. Holcomb--in June, 1903:    VIEWS OF RABBI REYNOLDS.        \"I found a very prominent former Newarker, in the person of Rabbi      Louis G. Reynolds, of the Synagogue B'nai Israel here [in Salt Lake      City]. He was rabbi of the Oheb Shalom Synagogue, Newark, from 1892      to 1896.\"        \"There is a Jewish population of about 500 in Salt Lake City,\" said      Rabbi Reynolds? \"Aside from that particular feature of their creed,      polygamy, I think the Mormons are a very good people. Everything      indicates that polygamy is dying out and that the Church means to      obey the law. Aside from polygamy, I am of the opinion that in      morals the Mormons will average higher than the Gentiles who live      here. The records show that the Mormons furnish a very small quota      of the vice of the city. As a rule, they are a temperate people.      'If Senator Smoot is unseated, would the"]]]
