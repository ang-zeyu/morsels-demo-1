About this time three white whales were also  obtained at Etah by a similar method of hunting.    With the advent of actual winter, storms swept over the land and sea  with such fury that it was no longer safe to venture out on the water in  kayaks. After the catching of several walruses from boats, sea hunting  now was confined to the quest of seal through young ice. As such hunting  would soon be limited to only a few open spaces near prominent  headlands, an industrious pursuit was feverishly engaged in at every  village from Annoatok to Cape York, and hour by hour, day by day, until  the hunt of necessity changed from sea to land, the husky natives  engaged in seal catching. As yet we had no caribou meat, and the little  auks, which had been gathered in nets during the summer, with the  eider-duck bagged later, soon disappeared as a steady diet. We must now  procure such available land game as hare, ptarmigan and reindeer, for we  had not yet learned to eat with a relish the fishy, liver-like substance  which is characteristic of all marine mammals.    Guns and ammunition were now distributed, and when the winds were easy  enough to allow one to venture out, every Eskimo sought the neighboring  hills. Francke also took his exercise with a gun on his shoulder.    The combined efforts resulted in a long line of ptarmigan, two reindeer  and sixteen hares. As snow covered the upper slopes, the game was forced  down near the sea, where we could still hope to hunt in the feeble light  of the early part of the night.    With a larder fairly stocked and good prospects for other tasty meats,  we were spared the anxiety of a winter without supplies. Francke was an  ideal chef in the preparation of this game to good effect, for he had a  delightful way of making our primitive provisions quite appetizing.    In the middle of October fox skins were prime, and then new steel traps  were distributed and set near the many caches. By this time all the  Eskimos had abandoned their sealskin tents and were snugly settled in  their winter igloos. The ground was covered with snow, and the sea was  almost entirely frozen.    Everybody was busy preparing for the coming cold and night. The  temperature was about 20 deg. below zero. Severe storms were becoming less  frequent, and the air, though colder, was less humid and less  disagreeable. An ice-foot was formed by the tides along shore, and over  this the winter sledging was begun by short excursions to bait the fox  traps and gather the foxes.    Our life now resolved itself into a systematic routine of work, which  was practically followed throughout the succeeding long winter night.  About the box-house in which Francke and I lived were igloos housing  eight to twelve families. The tribe of two hundred and fifty was  distributed in a range of villages along the coast, an average of four  families constituting a community. Early each morning Koo-loo-ting-wah  would bang at my door, enter, and I would drowsily awaken while he  freshened the fire. Rising, we would prepare hot coffee and partake of  breakfast with biscuits. By seven o'clock--according to our standard of  time--five or six of the natives would arrive, and, after a liberal  libation of coffee, begin work. I taught them to help me in the making  of my hickory sleds. Some I taught to use modern carpentering  instruments, which I had with me. Another group was schooled in bending  the resilient but tough hickory. This was done by wrapping old cloths  about the wood and steeping it in hot water. Others engaged, as the days  went by, in making dog harness, articles of winter clothing, and drying  meat. Not an hour was lost during the day. At noon we paused for a bite  of frozen meat and hot tea. Then we fell to work again without respite  until five or six o'clock.    Meanwhile, beginning in the early morning of our steadily darkening  days, other male members of the tribe pursued game. Others again  followed a routine of scouring of the villages and collecting all the  furs and game which had been caught. The women of the tribe, in almost  every dimly lighted igloo, were no less industrious. To them fell the  task of assisting in drying the fur skins, preparing dried meat and  making our clothing. Throughout the entire days they sat in their snow  and stone houses, masses of ill-smelling furs before them, cutting the  skins and sewing them into serviceable garments. This work I often  watched, passing from igloo to igloo, with an interest that verged on  anxiety; for upon the strength, thickness and durability of these  depended my life, and that of the companions I should choose, on the  frigid days which would inevitably come on my journey Poleward. But  these broad-faced, patient women did their work well. Their skill is  quite remarkable. They took my measurements, for instance, by roughly  sizing up my old garments and by measuring me by sight. Garments were  made to fit snugly after the preliminary making by cutting out or  inserting patches of fur. Needles among the natives are indeed precious.  So valuable are they that if a point or eye is broken, with infinite  skill and patience the broken end is heated and flattened, and by means  of a bow drill a new eye is bored. A new point is with equal skill  shaped on local stones. With marvelous patience they make their own  thread by drying and stripping caribou or narwhale sinews.    Were it not for their extraordinary eyesight, such work, under such  conditions, would be impossible. But in the dark the natives can espy  things invisible to white men. This owl-sight enables them to hunt, if  necessary, in almost pitch darkness, and to perform tedious feats of  hand skill which, in such dim light, an alien would bungle. I noticed,  with much curiosity, that when the natives inspected any photograph or  object which I gave them they always held it upside down. All objects,  as is well known, are reflected in the retina thus, and it is our  familiarity with the size and comparative relations of things which  enables the brain to visualize an object or scene at its proper angle.  This strange, instinctive act of the natives might form an interesting  chapter in optics.    Meanwhile, busy and interested in the beginning of our various pursuits,  the great crust which was to hold down the sea for so many months,  closed and thickened.    During the last days of brief sunshine the weather cleared, and at noon  on October 24 everybody sought the open for a last glimpse of the dying  day. There was a charm of color and glitter, but no one seemed quite  happy as the sun sank under the southern ice, for it was not to rise  again for one hundred and eighteen days.    Just prior to the falling of darkness, with that instinctive and forced  hilarity with which aboriginal beings seek to ward off an impending  calamity, the Eskimos engaged in their annual sporting event. It is a  curious sight, indeed, to behold a number of excited, laughing Eskimos  gathering about two champion dogs which are to fight. Although the zest  of betting is unknown, the natives regard dog fights with much the same  eager excitement as a certain type of sporting man does a cock  encounter. Sometimes the dogs do not fight fairly, a number of the  animals bunching together and attacking a single dog. Dogs selected for  the fight are, of course, the best of the teams. A dog which maintains  his fighting supremacy becomes a king dog, and when beaten becomes a  first lieutenant to the king.    After the forced enthusiasm of this brief period of excitement, the  Eskimos begin to succumb to the inevitable melancholia of nature, when  the sun, the source of natural life, disappears and darkness descends.  A gloom descends heavily upon their spirits. A subtle sadness tinctures  their life, and they are possessed by an impulse to weep. At this  season, hour by hour, the darkness thickens; the cold increases and  chills their igloos; the wind, exultant while the sun shines, now whines  and sobs dolorously--there is something gruesome, uncanny, supernatural,  in its siren sorrow. Outside, the snow falls, the sea closes. Its  clamant beat of waves is silenced. Sea animals mostly disappear; land  animals are rare. Their source of physical supply vanished, the Eskimos  unconsciously feel the grim hand of want, of starvation, which means  death, upon them. The psychology of this period of depression partly  lies, undoubtedly, in this instinctive dread of death from lack of food  and the natural depression of unrelieved gloom. Moreover, there is a  grief, born of the native superstition that, when the sea freezes, the  souls of all who have perished in the waters are imprisoned during the  long night. Too fierce is the struggle of these people with the  elemental forces to permit them, like many other aboriginal peoples to  be obsessed greatly with superstitions. Although their religion is a  very primitive and native one, it is usually only at the inception of  night that they feel the appalling nearness of a world that is  supernatural. As the last rim of the sun sank over the southern ice, the  natives entered upon a formal period of melancholy, during which the  bereavements of each family, and the discomforts and disasters of the  year, were memoralized.    I shall never forget that long, sad evening, which lasted many normal  days. The sun had descended. A sepulchral, gray-green curtain of gloom  hung over the chilled earth. In the dim semi-darkness could be vaguely  seen the outlines of the igloos, of the heaving curvatures of  snow-covered land, and the blacker, snake-like twistings of open lanes  of water, where the sea had not yet frozen. Sitting in my box-house, I  was startled suddenly by a sound that made my flesh for the instant  creep. I walked to the door and threw it open. Over the bluish,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36974"],[0,"Old Trails on the Niagara Frontier (#18)"],[1,"bereavements and hardships, into old Fort Niagara as prisoners of war.  Davy was born at Fishkill, Dutchess Co., New York, in 1764. His parents  made one remove after another, in the restless American fashion, for  some years taking such chances of betterment as new settlements  afforded; first at Waterford, Saratoga Co.; then in the wilderness on  the head-waters of the Susquehanna near the present village of  Huntsville; then up the river to the settlement known in those days as  Newtown Martin, now Middlefield; and later, for safety, to Cherry  Valley. Here David's mother and her four boys were at the time of the  famous massacre of November, 1778. When the alarm was given Mrs. Ogden  snatched a blanket, and with her little ones began a flight through the  woods towards the Mohawk. With them also fled Col. Campbell, of the  patriot militia. Coming to a deserted cabin whose owner had fled, they  did not scruple to help themselves to a loaf of bread, which Col.  Campbell cut up with his sword. After another flight of some hours  through a storm of mingled snow and rain, they came to the house of one  Lyons, a Tory, who was absent, presumably because busied in the black  work at Cherry Valley. Mrs. Lyons, who seems to have shared her  husband's sentiments, refused the refugees anything to eat, but finally  let the mother and children spend the night on the floor. Col. Campbell  left the Ogdens here and pushed on alone towards Canajoharie; while Mrs.  Odgen and her hungry little ones went on by themselves through the snow.  That day they came to a more hospitable house, where the keen suffering  of that adventure ended; and some days later, on the Mohawk, the father  rejoined the family, he also having escaped the massacre at Cherry  Valley.    This incident may be reckoned the mere prelude of our Davy's adventures;  for the next spring, having reached the mature age of fourteen, he  volunteered in the service of his country, entered upon the regular life  of a soldier, and began to have adventures on his own account. The year  that followed was spent in arduous but not particularly romantic  service. He was marched from one point to another on the Mohawk and the  Hudson; saw Andre hanged at Tappan, and finally was sent to the frontier  again, where at Fort Stanwix,[22] in the spring of 1781, what we may  regard as the real adventures of Davy Ogden began.    A party of eleven wood-choppers were at work in the heavy timber about  two miles from the fort, and every day an armed guard was sent out from  the garrison to protect them. On March 2d, Corporal Samuel Betts and six  soldiers, Davy among them, were detailed on this service. I conceive of  my hero at this time as a sturdy, well-seasoned lad, to whom woodcraft  and pioneer soldiering had become second nature. I would like to see him  among city boys of his own age to-day. Most things that they know, and  think of, would be quite out of his range. But there is a common ground  on which all healthy, high-minded boys, of whatever time or station in  life, stand on a level. I do not know that he had ever been to school,  or that he could read, though I think his mother must have looked to  that. But I do know that he was well educated. He was innocent of the  bicycle, but I'll warrant he could skate. I know he could swim like an  otter--as I shall presently record--and when it came to running, he  would have been a champion of the cinder-path, to-day. He knew the ways  of poverty and of self-denial; knew the signs of the forest, of wild  animal and Indian; and best of all, I am sure he knew just why he was  carrying a heavy flint-lock in the ragged, hungry ranks of the American  \"rebels.\" It must be admitted, I linger somewhat over my hero; but I  like the lad, and would have the reader come into sympathy with him. I  can see him now as he followed the corporal out of the fort that March  morning. He wore the three-cornered cocked-up hat of the prescribed  uniform, and his powder-horn was slung at his side. The whole guard  very likely wore snowshoes, for the snow lay three feet deep in the  woods, and a thaw had weakened the crust.    Late in the afternoon, soldiers and wood-choppers were startled by the  yells of Indians and Tories, who had gained a hill between them and the  fort. Brant had achieved another of his surprises, and there was no  escape from his party, which seemed to fill the woods. His evident  intent was to make captives and not to kill, though his men had orders  to shoot or tomahawk any who fired in self-defense. Two of Davy's  companions were wounded by the enemy. One of them, Timothy Runnels, was  shot in the mouth, \"the ball coming through his cheek; and yet not a  tooth was disturbed, a pretty good evidence, in the opinion of his  comrades, that his mouth was wide open when the ball went in.\" It fared  more seriously with the other wounded soldier. This man, whose name was  Morfat, had his thigh broken by a bullet. The Indians rushed upon him as  he fell at Davy's side, tomahawked him, scalped him, stripped him and  left him naked upon the snow, thus visiting a special vengeance upon one  who was said to be a deserter from the British. It is further chronicled  that Morfat did not immediately die, but lived until he was found, hours  after, by a party from the fort, finally expiring as his comrades bore  him through the gate of Fort Stanwix.    Davy Ogden had seen this dreadful thing, but with no sign of fear or  sickness. He had already mastered that scorn of suffering and death  which always commended the brave to their Indian captors. He was ranged  up with the other prisoners, and Brant asked of each his name. When Davy  gave his, the great chief exclaimed:    \"What, a son of Ogden the beaver-hunter, that old scouter? Ugh! I wish  it were he instead of you! But we will take care of his boy or he may  become a scouter too!\"    Thus began David's captivity, as the prisoner, and perhaps receiving  some of the special regard, of Brant himself. There could have been  little doubt in Davy's mind, from the moment of his capture, that he was  to be carried to Fort Niagara; yet the first move of the party was  characteristic of Indian strategy; for instead of taking the trail  westward, they all marched off to the eastward, coming upon the Mohawk  some miles below Fort Stanwix. They forded the river twice, the icy  water coming above their waists. On emerging upon the road between Fort  Stanwix and Fort Herkimer, Brant halted his sixteen prisoners and caused  the buckles to be cut from their shoes. These he placed in a row in the  road, where the first passing American would be sure to see them. There  was something of a taunt in the act, and a good deal of humor; and we  may be sure that Joseph Brant, who was educated enough, and of great  nature enough, to enjoy a joke, had many a laugh on his way back to  Niagara as he thought of those thirty-two buckles in a row.    The prisoners tied up their shoes with deerskin strings, and trudged  along through the night until the gleam of fires ahead and a chorus of  yells turned their thoughts towards the stake and an ignominious  martyrdom. But their fate was easier to meet. In a volley of sixteen  distinct yells for the prisoners and one for the scalp, the party--said  to number 100 Indians and fifty Tories--entered the first camp, where  squaws were boiling huge kettles of samp--pounded corn--eaten without  salt. All fared equally well, and all slept on the ground in the snow,  Davy and his fellows being guarded by British soldiers.    The next day's march brought them to Oneida Castle, often the  headquarters of Brant in his expeditions. Here the Indians dug up from  the snow a store of unhusked corn, and shelled and pounded a quantity  for their long march. Here, too, Davy's three-cornered Revolutionary hat  was taken from him, and in its place was given him a raccoon skin. All  of the captives except the corporal were similarly treated and the  Indians showed them how to tie the head and tail together. On some the  legs stuck up and on others the legs hung down. I do not know how Davy  wore his--with a touch of taste and an air of gaiety, no doubt; and we  may be sure it made a better head-covering for a march of 250 miles at  that season than would the stiff hat he had lost. Corporal Betts alone  was permitted to keep his hat, as insignia of rank, and it is to be  hoped he got some comfort out of it.    It would take too long to give all the dismal details of Davy's dreary  tramp across the State. Other captivities which I have spoken of had  incidents of more dire misery and greater horror than befel the party  to which Ogden belonged; and this is one reason why I have chosen to  dwell upon his adventures, because my aim is, by a personal narrative,  to illustrate the average experience of the time.    There were hundreds of American prisoners brought to Fort Niagara during  the period we are studying, but it would be far from just to their  captors, and would throw our historical perspective out of focus, to  take the extreme cases as types for the whole.    Yet, put it mildly as we can, the experience persists in being serious.  At Oneida Castle Brant, evidently fearing pursuit, roused his party in  the middle of the night, and a forced march was begun through the heavy  timber and up and down the long hills to the westward. When the moon  went down they halted, but at the first streak of daylight they pushed  on, not waiting even to boil their samp. An occasional handful of  parched corn, pounded fine and taken with a swallow of water, was all  the food any of the party had that day.    The next encampment was on the Onondaga River, south of the lake; and  here occurred an incident as characteristic of Indian character as was  the row of shoe-buckles in the road. Some Indians found a small cannon,  which had probably been abandoned by one of the detachments sent out by  Sullivan"]]]
