[The peasantry embrace. Enter SACRIST, with imperial messenger.    SACRIST.  Here are the worthy chiefs of Switzerland!    ROSSELMANN and several others.  Sacrist, what news?    SACRISTAN.             A courier brings this letter.    ALL (to WALTER FURST).  Open and read it.    FURST (reading).            \"To the worthy men  Of Uri, Schwytz, and Unterwald, the Queen  Elizabeth sends grace and all good wishes!\"    MANY VOICES.  What wants the queen with us? Her reign is done.    FURST (reads).  \"In the great grief and doleful widowhood,  In which the bloody exit of her lord  Has plunged her majesty, she still remembers  The ancient faith and love of Switzerland.\"    MELCHTHAL.  She ne'er did that in her prosperity.    ROSSELMANN.  Hush, let us hear.    FURST (reads).            \"And she is well assured,  Her people will in due abhorrence hold  The perpetrators of this damned deed.  On the three Cantons, therefore, she relies,  That they in nowise lend the murderers aid;  But rather, that they loyally assist  To give them up to the avenger's hand,  Remembering the love and grace which they  Of old received from Rudolph's princely house.\"       [Symptoms of dissatisfaction among the peasantry.    MANY VOICES.  The love and grace!    STAUFFACHER.  Grace from the father we, indeed, received,  But what have we to boast of from the son?  Did he confirm the charter of our freedom,  As all preceding emperors had done?  Did he judge righteous judgment, or afford  Shelter or stay to innocence oppressed?  Nay, did he e'en give audience to the envoys  We sent to lay our grievances before him?  Not one of all these things e'er did the king.  And had we not ourselves achieved our rights  By resolute valor our necessities  Had never touched him. Gratitude to him!  Within these vales he sowed not gratitude.  He stood upon an eminence--he might  Have been a very father to his people,  But all his aim and pleasure was to raise  Himself and his own house: and now may those  Whom he has aggrandized lament for him!    FURST.  We will not triumph in his fall, nor now  Recall to mind the wrongs we have endured.  Far be't from us! Yet, that we should avenge  The sovereign's death, who never did us good,  And hunt down those who ne'er molested us,  Becomes us not, nor is our duty. Love  Must bring its offerings free and unconstrained;  From all enforced duties death absolves--  And unto him we are no longer bound.    MELCHTHAL.  And if the queen laments within her bower,  Accusing heaven in sorrow's wild despair;  Here see a people from its anguish freed.  To that same heaven send up its thankful praise,  For who would reap regrets must sow affection.       [Exit the imperial courier.    STAUFFACHER (to the people).  But where is Tell? Shall he, our freedom's founder,  Alone be absent from our festival?  He did the most--endured the worst of all.  Come--to his dwelling let us all repair,  And bid the savior of our country hail!                   [Exeunt omnes.        SCENE II.       Interior of TELL'S cottage. A fire burning on the hearth.     The open door shows the scene outside.       HEDWIG, WALTER, and WILHELM.    HEDWIG.  Boys, dearest boys! your father comes to-day.  He lives, is free, and we and all are free!  The country owes its liberty to him!    WALTER.  And I too, mother, bore my part in it;  I shall be named with him. My father's shaft  Went closely by my life, but yet I shook not!    HEDWIG (embracing him).  Yes, yes, thou art restored to me again.  Twice have I given thee birth, twice suffered all  A mother's agonies for thee, my child!  But this is past; I have you both, boys, both!  And your dear father will be back to-day.       [A monk appears at the door.    WILHELM.  See, mother, yonder stands a holy friar;  He's asking alms, no doubt.    HEDWIG.                 Go lead him in,  That we may give him cheer, and make him feel  That he has come into the house of joy.       [Exit, and returns immediately with a cup.    WILHELM (to the monk).  Come in, good man. Mother will give you food.    WALTER.  Come in, and rest, then go refreshed away!    MONK (glancing round in terror, with unquiet looks).  Where am I? In what country?    WALTER.                  Have you lost  Your way, that you are ignorant of this?  You are at Buerglen, in the land of Uri,  Just at the entrance of the Sheckenthal.    MONK (to HEDWIG).  Are you alone? Your husband, is he here?    HEDWIG.  I momently expect him. But what ails you?  You look as one whose soul is ill at ease.  Whoe'er you be, you are in want; take that.       [Offers him the cup.    MONK.  Howe'er my sinking heart may yearn for food,  I will take nothing till you've promised me----    HEDWIG.  Touch not my dress, nor yet advance one step.  Stand off, I say, if you would have me hear you.    MONK.  Oh, by this hearth's bright, hospitable blaze,  By your dear children's heads, which I embrace----       [Grasps the boys.    HEDWIG.  Stand back, I say! What is your purpose, man?  Back from my boys! You are no monk,--no, no.  Beneath that robe content and peace should dwell,  But neither lives within that face of thine.    MONK.  I am the veriest wretch that breathes on earth.    HEDWIG.  The heart is never deaf to wretchedness;  But thy look freezes up my inmost soul.    WALTER (springs up).  Mother, my father!    HEDWIG.            Oh, my God!       [Is about to follow, trembles and stops.    WILHELM (running after his brother).  My father!    WALTER (without).  Thou'rt here once more!    WILHELM (without).               My father, my dear father!    TELL (without).  Yes, here I am once more! Where is your mother?       [They enter.    WALTER.  There at the door she stands, and can no further,  She trembles so with terror and with joy.    TELL.  Oh Hedwig, Hedwig, mother of my children!  God has been kind and helpful in our woes.  No tyrant's hand shall e'er divide us more.    HEDWIG (falling on his neck).  Oh, Tell, what have I suffered for thy sake!       [Monk becomes attentive.    TELL.  Forget it now, and live for joy alone!  I'm here again with you! This is my cot  I stand again on mine own hearth!    WILHELM.                    But, father,  Where is your crossbow left? I see it not.    TELL.  Nor shalt thou ever see it more, my boy.  It is suspended in a holy place,  And in the chase shall ne'er be used again.    HEDWIG.  Oh, Tell, Tell!       [Steps back, dropping his hand.    TELL.           What alarms thee, dearest wife?    HEDWIG.  How--how dost thou return to me? This hand--  Dare I take hold of it? This hand--Oh God!    TELL (with firmness and animation).  Has shielded you and set my country free;  Freely I raise it in the face of Heaven.       [MONK gives a sudden start--he looks at him.    Who is this friar here?    HEDWIG.               Ah, I forgot him.  Speak thou with him; I shudder at his presence.    MONK (stepping nearer).  Are you that Tell that slew the governor?    TELL.  Yes, I am he. I hide the fact from no man.    MONK.  You are that Tell! Ah! it is God's own hand  That hath conducted me beneath your roof.    TELL (examining him closely).  You are no monk. Who are you?    MONK.                  You have slain  The governor, who did you wrong. I too,  Have slain a foe, who late denied me justice.  He was no less your enemy than mine.  I've rid the land of him.    TELL (drawing back).                Thou art--oh horror!  In--children, children--in without a word.  Go, my dear wife! Go! Go! Unhappy man,  Thou shouldst be----    HEIWIG.  Heavens, who is it?    TELL.             Do not ask.  Away! away! the children must not hear it.  Out of the house--away! Thou must not rest  'Neath the same roof with this unhappy man!    HEDWIG.  Alas! What is it? Come!       [Exit with the children.    TELL (to the MONK).                Thou art the Duke  Of Austria--I know it. Thou hast slain  The emperor, thy uncle, and liege lord.    DUKE JOHN.  He robbed me of my patrimony.    TELL.                  How!  Slain him--thy king, thy uncle! And the earth  Still bears thee! And the sun still shines on thee!    DUKE JOHN.  Tell, hear me, ere you----    TELL.               Reeking with the blood  Of him that was thy emperor and kinsman,  Durst thou set foot within my spotless house?  Show thy fell visage to a virtuous man,  And claim the rites of hospitality?    DUKE JOHN.  I hoped to find compassion at your hands.  You also took revenge upon your foe!    TELL.  Unhappy man! And dar'st thou thus confound  Ambition's bloody crime with the dread act  To which a father's direful need impelled him?  Hadst thou to shield thy children's darling heads?  To guard thy fireside's sanctuary--ward off  The last, worst doom from all that thou didst love?  To heaven I raise my unpolluted hands,  To curse thine act and thee! I have avenged  That holy nature which thou hast profaned.  I have no part with thee. Thou art a murderer;  I've shielded all that was most dear to me.    DUKE JOHN.  You cast me off to comfortless despair!    TELL.  My blood runs cold even while I talk with thee.  Away! Pursue thine awful course! Nor longer  Pollute the cot where innocence abides!       [DUKE JOHN turns to depart.    DUKE JOHN.  I cannot live, and will no longer thus!    TELL.  And yet my soul bleeds for thee--gracious heaven!  So young, of such a noble line, the grandson  Of Rudolph, once my lord and emperor,  An outcast--murderer--standing at my door,  The poor man's door--a suppliant, in despair!       [Covers his face.    DUKE JOHN.  If thou hast power to weep, oh let my fate  Move your compassion--it is horrible.  I am--say, rather was--a prince. I might  Have been most happy had I only curbed  The impatience of my passionate desires;  But envy gnawed my heart--I saw the youth  Of mine own cousin Leopold endowed  With honor, and enriched with broad domains,  The while myself, that was "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6791"],[0,"Mary Stuart: A Tragedy (#18)"],[1,"my father cast disgrace upon me:  In vain with princely virtues would I hide it;  The envious hatred of my enemies  Uncovers it, and places Mary Stuart,  A threatening fiend, before me evermore!       [Walking up and down, with quick and agitated steps.    Oh, no! this fear must end. Her head must fall!  I will have peace. She is the very fury  Of my existence; a tormenting demon,  Which destiny has fastened on my soul.  Wherever I had planted me a comfort,  A flattering hope, my way was ever crossed  By this infernal viper! She has torn  My favorite, and my destined bridegroom from me.  The hated name of every ill I feel  Is Mary Stuart--were but she no more  On earth I should be free as mountain air.       [Standing still.    With what disdain did she look down on me,  As if her eye should blast me like the lightning!  Poor feeble wretch! I bear far other arms,  Their touch is mortal, and thou art no more.       [Advancing to the table hastily, and taking the pen.    I am a bastard, am I? Hapless wretch,  I am but so the while thou liv'st and breath'st.  Thy death will make my birth legitimate.  The moment I destroy thee is the doubt  Destroyed which hangs o'er my imperial right.  As soon as England has no other choice,  My mother's honor and my birthright triumphs!       [She signs with resolution; lets her pen then fall,     and steps back with an expression of terror. After     a pause she rings.        SCENE XI.       ELIZABETH, DAVISON.    ELIZABETH.  Where are their lordships?    DAVISON.                They are gone to quell  The tumult of the people. The alarm  Was instantly appeased when they beheld  The Earl of Shrewsbury. That's he! exclaimed  A hundred voices--that's the man--he saved  The queen; hear him--the bravest man in England!  And now began the gallant Talbot, blamed  In gentle words the people's violence,  And used such strong, persuasive eloquence,  That all were pacified, and silently  They slunk away.    ELIZABETH.           The fickle multitude!  Which turns with every wind. Unhappy he  Who leans upon this reed! 'Tis well, Sir William;  You may retire again----     [As he is going towards the door.              And, sir, this paper,  Receive it back; I place it in your hands.    DAVISON (casts a look upon the paper, and starts back).  My gracious queen--thy name! 'tis then decided.    ELIZABETH.  I had but to subscribe it--I have done so--  A paper sure cannot decide--a name  Kills not.    DAVISON.        Thy name, my queen, beneath this paper  Is most decisive--kills--'tis like the lightning,  Which blasteth as it flies! This fatal scroll  Commands the sheriff and commissioners  To take departure straight for Fotheringay,  And to the Queen of Scots announce her death,  Which must at dawn be put in execution.  There is no respite, no discretion here.  As soon as I have parted with this writ  Her race is run.    ELIZABETH.           Yes, sir, the Lord has placed  This weighty business in your feeble hands;  Seek him in prayer to light you with his wisdom;  I go--and leave you, sir, to do your duty.                         [Going.    DAVISON.  No; leave me not, my queen, till I have heard  Your will. The only wisdom that I need  Is, word for word, to follow your commands.  Say, have you placed this warrant in my hands  To see that it be speedily enforced?    ELIZABETH.  That you must do as your own prudence dictates.    DAVISON (interrupting her quickly, and alarmed).  Not mine--oh, God forbid! Obedience is  My only prudence here. No point must now  Be left to be decided by your servant.  A small mistake would here be regicide,  A monstrous crime, from which my soul recoils.  Permit me, in this weighty act, to be  Your passive instrument, without a will:--  Tell me in plain, undoubted terms your pleasure,  What with the bloody mandate I should do.      ELIZABETH.  Its name declares its meaning.    DAVISON.                  Do you, then,  My liege, command its instant execution?    ELIZABETH.  I said not that; I tremble but to think it.    DAVISON.  Shall I retain it, then, 'till further orders?    ELIZABETH.  At your own risk; you answer the event.    DAVISON.  I! gracious heavens! Oh, speak, my queen, your pleasure!    ELIZABETH.  My pleasure is that this unhappy business  Be no more mentioned to me; that at last  I may be freed from it, and that forever.    DAVISON.  It costs you but a word--determine then  What shall I do with this mysterious scroll?    ELIZABETH.  I have declared it, plague me, sir, no longer.    DAVISON.  You have declared it, say you? Oh, my queen,  You have said nothing. Please, my gracious mistress,  But to remember----    ELIZABETH (stamps on the ground).            Insupportable!    DAVISON.  Oh, be indulgent to me! I have entered  Unwittingly, not many months ago,  Upon this office; I know not the language  Of courts and kings. I ever have been reared  In simple, open wise, a plain blunt man.  Be patient with me; nor deny your servant  A light to lead him clearly to his duty.       [He approaches her in a supplicating posture,     she turns her back on him; he stands in despair;     then speaks with a tone of resolution.    Take, take again this paper--take it back!  Within my hands it is a glowing fire.  Select not me, my queen; select not me  To serve you in this terrible conjecture.    ELIZABETH.  Go, sir;--fulfil the duty of your office.                      [Exit.        SCENE XII.       DAVISON, then BURLEIGH.    DAVISON.  She goes! She leaves me doubting and perplexed  With this dread paper! How to act I know not;  Should I retain it, should I forward it?       [To BURLEIGH, who enters.    Oh! I am glad that you are come, my lord,  'Tis you who have preferred me to this charge;  Now free me from it, for I undertook it,  Unknowing how responsible it made me.  Let me then seek again the obscurity  In which you found me; this is not my place.    BURLEIGH.  How now? Take courage, sir! Where is the warrant?  The queen was with you.    DAVISON.               She has quitted me  In bitter anger. Oh, advise me, help me,  Save me from this fell agony of doubt!  My lord, here is the warrant: it is signed!    BURLEIGH.  Indeed! Oh, give it, give it me!    DAVISON.                    I may not.    BURLEIGH.  How!    DAVISON.     She has not yet explained her final will.    BURLEIGH.  Explained! She has subscribed it;--give it to me.    DAVISON.  I am to execute it, and I am not.  Great heavens! I know not what I am to do!    BURLEIGH (urging more violently).  It must be now, this moment, executed.  The warrant, sir. You're lost if you delay.    DAVISON.  So am I also if I act too rashly.    BURLEIGH.  What strange infatuation. Give it me.       [Snatches the paper from him, and exit with it.    DAVISON.  What would you? Hold? You will be my destruction.          ACT V.    SCENE I.       The Scene the same as in the First Act.       HANNAH KENNEDY in deep mourning, her eyes still red     from weeping, in great but quiet anguish, is employed     in sealing letters and parcels. Her sorrow often     interrupts her occupation, and she is seen at such     intervals to pray in silence. PAULET and DRURY,     also in mourning, enter, followed by many servants,     who bear golden and silver vessels, mirrors, paintings,     and other valuables, and fill the back part of the stage     with them. PAULET delivers to the NURSE a box of jewels     and a paper, and seems to inform her by signs that it     contains the inventory of the effects the QUEEN had brought     with her. At the sight of these riches, the anguish of     the NURSE is renewed; she sinks into a deep, glowing     melancholy, during which DRURY, PAULET, and the servants     silently retire.       MELVIL enters.    KENNEDY (screams aloud as soon as she observes him).  Melvil! Is it you? Behold I you again?    MELVIL.  Yes, faithful Kennedy, we meet once more.    KENNEDY.  After this long, long, painful separation!    MELVIL.  A most unhappy, bitter meeting this!    KENNEDY.  You come----    MELVIL.       To take an everlasting leave  Of my dear queen--to bid a last farewell!    KENNEDY.  And now at length, now on the fatal morn  Which brings her death, they grant our royal lady  The presence of her friends. Oh, worthy sir,  I will not question you, how you have fared,  Nor tell you all the sufferings we've endured,  Since you were torn away from us: alas!  There will be time enough for that hereafter.  O, Melvil, Melvil, why was it our fate  To see the dawn of this unhappy day?    MELVIL.  Let us not melt each other with our grief.  Throughout my whole remaining life, as long  As ever it may be, I'll sit and weep;  A smile shall never more light up these cheeks,  Ne'er will I lay this sable garb aside,  But lead henceforth a life of endless mourning.  Yet on this last sad day I will be firm;  Pledge me your word to moderate your grief;  And when the rest of comfort all bereft,  Abandoned to despair, wail round her, we  Will lead her with heroic resolution,  And be her staff upon the road to death!    KENNEDY.  Melvil! You are deceived if you suppose  The queen has need of our support to meet  Her death with firmness. She it is, my friend,  Who will exhibit the undaunted heart.  Oh! trust me, Mary Stuart will expire  As best becomes a heroine and queen!    MELVIL.  Received she firmly, then, the sad decree  Of death?--'tis said that she was not prepared.    KENNEDY.  She was not; yet they were far other terrors  Which made our lady shudder: 'twas not death,  But her deliverer, which made her tremble.  Freedom was promised us; this very night  Had Mortimer engaged to bear us hence:  And thus the queen, perplexed 'twixt hope and fear,  And doubting still if she should trust her honor  And royal person to the adventurous youth,  Sat waiting for the morning. On a sudden  We hear a boisterous tumult in the castle;  Our ears are startled by repeated blows  Of many hammers, and we think we hear  The approach of"]]]
