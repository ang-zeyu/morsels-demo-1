Canberra's emphasis on reforms is  a key factor behind the economy's strength, and Australia is expected  to outperform its trading partners in 2002, with GDP growth projected  to be 3% or better. Australia probably will experience some weakness in  mid-2002 as its business cycle tends to lag the US by about six months,  and larger problems could emerge if Australia's trade position worsens.

Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and subsequent  occupation by the victorious Allies in 1945, Austria's status remained  unclear for a decade. A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended the occupation,  recognized Austria's independence, and forbade unification with  Germany. A constitutional law of that same year declared the country's  \"perpetual neutrality\" as a condition for Soviet military withdrawal. This  neutrality, once ingrained as part of the Austrian cultural identity,  has been called into question since the Soviet collapse of 1991 and  Austria's entry into the European Union in 1995. A prosperous country,  Austria entered the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/636"],[0,"Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions — Volume 1 (#18)"],[1,"the use of Mr. Aislabie. Five of the  South Sea directors, including Mr. Edward Gibbon, the grandfather of the  celebrated historian, were ordered into the custody of the black rod.  Upon a motion made by Earl Stanhope, it was unanimously resolved,  that the taking in or giving credit for stock without a valuable  consideration actually paid or sufficiently secured; or the purchasing  stock by any director or agent of the South Sea Company, for the use  or benefit of any member of the administration, or any member of either  House of Parliament, during such time as the South Sea Bill was yet  pending in Parliament, was a notorious and dangerous corruption. Another  resolution was passed a few days afterwards, to the effect that several  of the directors and officers of the Company having, in a clandestine  manner, sold their own stock to the Company, had been guilty of a  notorious fraud and breach of trust, and had thereby mainly caused the  unhappy turn of affairs that had so much affected public credit.  Mr. Aislabie resigned his office as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and  absented himself from Parliament until the formal inquiry into his  individual guilt was brought under the consideration of the Legislature.    In the mean time, Knight, the treasurer of the Company, and who was  intrusted with all the dangerous secrets of the dishonest directors,  packed up his books and documents, and made his escape from the country.  He embarked in disguise, in a small boat on the river, and proceeding  to a vessel hired for the purpose, was safely conveyed to Calais. The  Committee of Secrecy informed the House of the circumstance, when it was  resolved unanimously that two addresses should be presented to the King;  the first praying that he would issue a proclamation, offering a reward  for the apprehension of Knight; and the second, that he would give  immediate orders to stop the ports, and to take effectual care of the  coasts, to prevent the said Knight, or any other officers of the South  Sea Company, from escaping out of the kingdom. The ink was hardly  dry upon these addresses before they were carried to the King by Mr.  Methuen, deputed by the House for that purpose. The same evening a royal  proclamation was issued, offering a reward of two thousand pounds for  the apprehension of Knight. The Commons ordered the doors of the House  to be locked, and the keys to be placed upon the table. General Ross,  one of the members of the Committee of Secrecy, acquainted them that  they had already discovered a train of the deepest villany and fraud  that Hell had ever contrived to ruin a nation, which in due time they  would lay before the House. In the mean time, in order to a further  discovery, the Committee thought it highly necessary to secure the  persons of some of the directors and principal South Sea officers, and  to seize their papers. A motion to this effect having been made, was  carried unanimously. Sir Robert Chaplin, Sir Theodore Janssen, Mr.  Sawbridge, and Mr. F. Eyles, members of the House, and directors of the  South Sea Company, were summoned to appear in their places, and answer  for their corrupt practices. Sir Theodore Janssen and Mr. Sawbridge  answered to their names, and endeavoured to exculpate themselves. The  House heard them patiently, and then ordered them to withdraw. A motion  was then made, and carried nemine contradicente, that they had been  guilty of a notorious breach of trust--had occasioned much loss to great  numbers of his Majesty's subjects, and had highly prejudiced the public  credit. It was then ordered that, for their offence, they should be  expelled the House, and taken into the custody of the sergeant-at-arms.  Sir Robert Chaplin and Mr. Eyles, attending in their places four days  afterwards, were also expelled the House. It was resolved at the same  time to address the King, to give directions to his ministers at foreign  courts to make application for Knight, that he might be delivered up  to the English authorities, in ease he took refuge in any of their  dominions. The King at once agreed, and messengers were despatched to  all parts of the Continent the same night.    Among the directors taken into custody, was Sir John Blunt, the man whom  popular opinion has generally accused of having been the original author  and father of the scheme. This man, we are informed by Pope, in his  epistle to Allen, Lord Bathurst, was a dissenter, of a most religious  deportment, and professed to be a great believer. He constantly  declaimed against the luxury and corruption of the age, the partiality  of parliaments, and the misery of party spirit. He was particularly  eloquent against avarice in great and noble persons. He was originally  a scrivener, and afterwards became, not only a director, but the most  active manager of the South Sea Company. Whether it was during his  career in this capacity that he first began to declaim against the  avarice of the great, we are not informed. He certainly must have seen  enough of it to justify his severest anathema; but if the preacher had  himself been free from the vice he condemned, his declamations would  have had a better effect. He was brought up in custody to the bar of the  House of Lords, and underwent a long examination. He refused to answer  several important questions. He said he had been examined already by  a committee of the House of Commons, and as he did not remember his  answers, and might contradict himself, he refused to answer before  another tribunal. This declaration, in itself an indirect proof of  guilt, occasioned some commotion in the House. He was again asked  peremptorily whether he had ever sold any portion of the stock to  any member of the administration, or any member of either House of  Parliament, to facilitate the passing of the hill. He again declined to  answer. He was anxious, he said, to treat the House with all possible  respect, but he thought it hard to be compelled to accuse himself. After  several ineffectual attempts to refresh his memory, he was directed to  withdraw. A violent discussion ensued between the friends and opponents  of the ministry. It was asserted that the administration were no  strangers to the convenient taciturnity of Sir John Blunt. The Duke  of Wharton made a reflection upon the Earl Stanhope, which the latter  warmly resented. He spoke under great excitement, and with such  vehemence as to cause a sudden determination of blood to the head. He  felt himself so ill that he was obliged to leave the House and retire  to his chamber. He was cupped immediately, and also let blood on the  following morning, but with slight relief. The fatal result was not  anticipated. Towards evening he became drowsy, and turning himself on  his face, expired. The sudden death of this statesman caused great grief  to the nation. George I was exceedingly affected, and shut himself up  for some hours in his closet, inconsolable for his loss.    Knight, the treasurer of the company, was apprehended at Tirlemont, near  Liege, by one of the secretaries of Mr. Leathes, the British resident  at Brussels, and lodged in the citadel of Antwerp. Repeated applications  were made to the court of Austria to deliver him up, but in vain. Knight  threw himself upon the protection of the states of Brabant, and demanded  to be tried in that country. It was a privilege granted to the states  of Brabant by one of the articles of the Joyeuse Entree, that every  criminal apprehended in that country should be tried in that country.  The states insisted on their privilege, and refused to deliver Knight to  the British authorities. The latter did not cease their solicitations;  but in the mean time, Knight escaped from the citadel.    On the 16th of February the Committee of Secrecy made their first report  to the House. They stated that their inquiry had been attended with  numerous difficulties and embarrassments; every one they had examined  had endeavoured, as far as in him lay, to defeat the ends of justice. In  some of the books produced before them, false and fictitious entries had  been made; in others, there were entries of money, with blanks for the  name of the stockholders. There were frequent erasures and alterations,  and in some of the books leaves were torn out. They also found that some  books of great importance had been destroyed altogether, and that  some had been taken away or secreted. At the very entrance into their  inquiry, they had observed that the matters referred to them were of  great variety and extent. Many persons had been intrusted with various  parts in the execution of the law, and under colour thereof had acted  in an unwarrantable manner, in disposing of the properties of many  thousands of persons, amounting to many millions of money. They  discovered that, before the South Sea Act was passed, there was an entry  in the Company's books of the sum of 1,259,325 pounds, upon account of  stock stated to have been sold to the amount of 574,500 pounds. This  stock was all fictitious, and had been disposed of with a view to  promote the passing of the bill. It was noted as sold at various days,  and at various prices, from 150 to 325 per cent. Being surprised to see  so large an account disposed of, at a time when the Company were  not empowered to increase their capital, the committee determined  to investigate most carefully the whole transaction. The governor,  sub-governor, and several directors were brought before them, and  examined rigidly. They found that, at the time these entries were made,  the Company was not in possession of such a quantity of stock, having  in their own right only a small quantity, not exceeding thirty thousand  pounds at the utmost. Pursuing the inquiry, they found that this amount  of stock, was to be esteemed as taken in or holden by the Company, for  the benefit of the pretended purchasers, although no mutual agreement  was made for its delivery"]]]
