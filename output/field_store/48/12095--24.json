But now the case  is like that of the natural parents who let their children do as they  please; at present the spiritual authority threatens, dispenses, takes  money, and pardons more than it has power to pardon. I will here  refrain from saying more; we see more of it than is good; greed holds  the reins, and just what should be forbidden is taught; and it is  clearly seen that the spiritual estate is in all things more worldly  than the worldly estate itself. Meanwhile Christendom must be ruined,  and this Commandment perish.    If there were a bishop who would zealously provide for all these  classes, supervise, make visitations and be faithful as he ought,  truly, one city would be too much for him. For in the time of the  Apostles, when Christendom was at its best estate, each city had a  bishop, although the smallest part of the inhabitants were Christians.  How may things go when one bishop wants to have so much, another so  much, this one the whole world, that one the fourth of it.    It is time that we pray God for mercy. Of spiritual power we have much;  but of spiritual government nothing or little. Meanwhile may he help  who can, that endowments, monastic houses, parishes and schools be well  established and managed; and it would also be one of the works of the  spiritual authority that it lessen the number of endowments, monastic  houses and schools, where they cannot be cared for. It is much better  that there be no monastic house or endowment than that there be evil  government in them, whereby God is the more provoked to anger.    IX. Since, then, the authorities so entirely neglect their work, and  are perverted, it must assuredly follow that they misuse their power,  and undertake other and evil works, just as parents do when they give  some command contrary to God. Here we must be wise; for the Apostle has  said, that those times shall be perilous in which such authorities  shall rule. For it seems as if we resisted their power if we do not do  and leave undone all that they prescribe. Therefore we must take hold  of the first three Commandments and the First Table, and be certain  that no man, neither bishop, nor pope, nor angel, may command or  determine anything that is contrary to or hinders these three  Commandments, or does not help them; and if they attempt such things,  it is not valid and amounts to nothing; and we also sin if we follow  and obey, or even tolerate such acts.    From this it is easy to understand that the commands of fasting do not  include the sick, the pregnant women, or those who for other reasons  cannot fast without injury. And, to rise higher, in our time nothing  comes from Rome but a fair of spiritual wares, which are openly and  shamelessly bought and sold, indulgences, parishes, monastic houses,  bishoprics, provostships, benefices, and every thing that has ever been  founded to God's service far and wide; whereby not only is all money  and wealth of the world drawn and driven to Rome (for this would be the  smallest harm), but the parishes, bishoprics and prelacies are torn to  pieces, deserted, laid waste, and so the people are neglected, God's  Word and God's Name and honor come to naught, and faith is destroyed,  so that at last such institutions and offices fall into the hands not  only of unlearned and unfit men, but the greater part into the hands of  the Romans, the greatest villains in the world. Thus what has been  founded for God's service, for the instruction, government and  improvement of the people, must now serve the stable-boys,  mule-drivers, yea, not to use plainer language, Roman whores and  knaves; yet we have no more thanks than that they mock us for it as  fools.    X. If then such unbearable abuses are all carried on in the Name of God  and St. Peter, just as if God's Name and the spiritual power were  instituted to blaspheme God's honor, to destroy Christendom, body and  soul: we are indeed in duty bound to resist in a proper way as much as  we can. And here we must do like pious children whose parents have  become insane, and first see by what right that which has been founded  for God's service in our lands, or has been ordained to provide for our  children, must be allowed to do its work in Rome, and to lapse here,  where it ought to serve. How can we be so foolish?    Since then bishops and spiritual prelates stand idle in this matter,  offer no opposition or are afraid, and thus allow Christendom to  perish, it is our duty first of all humbly to call upon God for help to  prevent this thing, then to put our hand to work to the same end, send  the courtesans and those who bear letters from Rome about their  business, in a reasonable, gentle way inform them that, if they wish to  care for their parishes properly, they shall live in them and improve  the people by preaching or by good example; or if not, and they do live  in Rome or elsewhere, lay waste and debauch the churches, then let the  pope feed them, whom they serve. It is not fitting that we support the  pope's servants, his people, yes, his knaves and whores, to the  destruction and injury of our souls.    Lo! these are the true Turks, whom the kings, princes and the nobility  ought to attack first: not seeking thereby their own benefit, but only  the improvement of Christendom, and the prevention of the blasphemy and  disgracing of the divine Name; and so to deal with the clergy as with a  father who has lost his sense and wits; who, if one did not restrain  him and resist him (although with all humility and honor), might  destroy child, heir and everybody. Thus we are to honor Roman authority  as our highest father; and yet, since they have gone mad and lost their  senses, not allow them to do what they attempt, lest Christendom be  destroyed thereby.    XI. Some think, this should be referred to a General Council. To this I  say: No! For we have had many councils in which this has been proposed,  namely, at Constance, Basel and the last Roman Council; but nothing has  been accomplished, and things have grown ever worse, Moreover, such  councils are entirely useless, since Roman wisdom has contrived the  device that the kings and princes must beforehand take an oath to let  the Romans remain what they are and keep what they have, and so has put  up a bar to ward off all reformation, to retain protection and liberty  for all their knavery, although this oath is demanded, forced and taken  contrary to God and the law, and by it the doors are locked against the  Holy Spirit, Who should rule the councils. But this would be the best,  and also the only remedy remaining, if kings, princes, nobility, cities  and communities themselves began and opened a way for reformation, so  that the bishops and clergy, who now are afraid, would have reason to  follow. For here nothing else shall and must be considered except God's  first three Commandments, against which neither Rome, nor heaven nor  earth can command or forbid anything. And the ban or threatening with  which they think they can prevent this, amounts to nothing; just as it  amounts to nothing if an insane father severely threatens the son who  restrains him or locks him up.    XII. The third work of this Commandment is to obey the temporal  authority, as Paul teaches, Romans xiii, and Titus iii, and St.  Peter,  I. Peter ii: \"Submit yourselves to the king as supreme, and to the  princes as his ambassadors, and to all the ordinances of the worldly  power.\" But it is the work of the temporal power to protect its  subjects, and to punish thievery, robbery, and adultery, as St. Paul  says, Romans xiii: \"It beareth not the sword in vain; it serves God  with it, to the terror of evil doers, and to the protection of the  good.\"    Here men sin in two ways. First, if they lie to the government, deceive  it, and are disloyal, neither obey nor do as it has ordered and  commanded, whether with their bodies or their possessions. For even if  the government does injustice, as the King of Babylon did to the people  of Israel, yet God would have it obeyed, without treachery and  deception. Secondly, when men speak evil of the government and curse  it, and when a man cannot revenge himself and abuses the government  with grumbling and evil words, publicly or secretly.    In all this we are to regard that which St. Peter bids us regard,  namely, that its power, whether it do right or wrong, cannot harm the  soul, but only the body and property; unless indeed it should try  openly to compel us to do wrong against God or men; as in former days  when the magistrates were not yet Christians, and as the Turk is now  said to do. For to suffer wrong destroys no one's soul, nay, it  improves the soul, although it inflicts loss upon the body and  property; but to do wrong, that destroys the soul, although it should  gain all the world's wealth.    XIII. This also is the reason why there is not such great danger in the  temporal power as in the spiritual, when it does wrong.  For the  temporal power can do no harm, I since it has nothing to do with  preaching and faith and the first three Commandments. But the spiritual  power does harm not only when it does wrong, but also when it neglects  its duty and busies itself with other things, even if they were better  than the very best works of the temporal power. Therefore, we must  resist it when it does not do right, and not resist the temporal power  although it does wrong.  For the poor people believe and do as they see  the spiritual power believing and doing; if they are not set an example  and are not taught, then they also believe nothing and do nothing;  since this power is instituted for no other reason than to lead the  people in faith to God. All this is not found in the temporal power;  for it may do and leave undone what it will, my faith to God still goes  its way and works its works, because I need not believe what it  believes.    Therefore, also, the temporal power is a very "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/419"],[0,"The Magic of Oz (#18)"],[1,", the Wizard  called out to the prisoners:    \"Are you free?\"    Both Trot and Cap'n Bill tried to move their feet and failed.    \"No!\" they shouted in answer.    The Wizard rubbed his bald head thoughtfully and then took some other  magic tools from the bag.    First he placed a little black ball in a silver pistol and shot it  toward the Magic Isle.  The ball exploded just over the head of Trot  and scattered a thousand sparks over the little girl.    \"Oh!\" said the Wizard, \"I guess that will set her free.\"    But Trot's feet were still rooted in the ground of the Magic Isle, and  the disappointed Wizard had to try something else.    For almost an hour he worked hard, using almost every magic tool in his  black bag, and still Cap'n Bill and Trot were not rescued.    \"Dear me!\" exclaimed Dorothy, \"I'm 'fraid we'll have to go to Glinda,  after all.\"    That made the little Wizard blush, for it shamed him to think that his  magic was not equal to that of the Magic Isle.    \"I won't give up yet, Dorothy,\" he said, \"for I know a lot of wizardry  that I haven't yet tried.  I don't know what magician enchanted this  little island, or what his powers were, but I DO know that I can break  any enchantment known to the ordinary witches and magicians that used  to inhabit the Land of Oz.  It's like unlocking a door; all you need is  to find the right key.\"    \"But 'spose you haven't the right key with you.\" suggested Dorothy;  \"what then?\"    \"Then we'll have to make the key,\" he answered.    The Glass Cat now came back to their side of the river, walking under  the water, and said to the Wizard: \"They're getting frightened over  there on the island because they're both growing smaller every minute.  Just now, when I left them, both Trot and Cap'n Bill were only about  half their natural sizes.\"    \"I think,\" said the Wizard reflectively, \"that I'd better go to the  shore of the island, where I can talk to them and work to better  advantage.  How did Trot and Cap'n Bill get to the island?\"    \"On a raft,\" answered the Glass Cat.  \"It's over there now on the  beach.\"    \"I suppose you're not strong enough to bring the raft to this side, are  you?\"    \"No; I couldn't move it an inch,\" said the Cat.    \"I'll try to get it for you,\" volunteered the Cowardly Lion.  \"I'm  dreadfully scared for fear the Magic Isle will capture me, too; but  I'll try to get the raft and bring it to this side for you.\"    \"Thank you, my friend,\" said the Wizard.    So the Lion plunged into the river and swam with powerful strokes  across to where the raft was beached upon the island.  Placing one paw  on the raft, he turned and struck out with his other three legs and so  strong was the great beast that he managed to drag the raft from off  the beach and propel it slowly to where the Wizard stood on the river  bank.    \"Good!\" exclaimed the little man, well pleased.    \"May I go across with you?\" asked Dorothy.    The Wizard hesitated.    \"If you'll take care not to leave the raft or step foot on the island,  you'll be quite safe,\" he decided.  So the Wizard told the Hungry Tiger  and the Cowardly Lion to guard the cage of monkeys until he returned,  and then he and Dorothy got upon the raft.  The paddle which Cap'n Bill  had made was still there, so the little Wizard paddled the clumsy raft  across the water and ran it upon the beach of the Magic Isle as close  to the place where Cap'n Bill and Trot were rooted as he could.    Dorothy was shocked to see how small the prisoners had become, and Trot  said to her friends: \"If you can't save us soon, there'll be nothing  left of us.\"    \"Be patient, my dear,\" counseled the Wizard, and took the little axe  from his black bag.    \"What are you going to do with that?\" asked Cap'n Bill.    \"It's a magic axe,\" replied the Wizard, \"and when I tell it to chop, it  will chop those roots from your feet and you can run to the raft before  they grow again.\"    \"Don't!\" shouted the sailor in alarm.  \"Don't do it!  Those roots are  all flesh roots, and our bodies are feeding 'em while they're growing  into the ground.\"    \"To cut off the roots,\" said Trot, \"would be like cutting off our  fingers and toes.\"    The Wizard put the little axe back in the black bag and took out a pair  of silver pincers.    \"Grow--grow--grow!\" he said to the pincers, and at once they grew and  extended until they reached from the raft to the prisoners.    \"What are you going to do now?\" demanded Cap'n Bill, fearfully eyeing  the pincers.    \"This magic tool will pull you up, roots and all, and land you on this  raft,\" declared the Wizard.    \"Don't do it!\" pleaded the sailor, with a shudder.  \"It would hurt us  awfully.\"    \"It would be just like pulling teeth to pull us up by the roots,\"  explained Trot.    \"Grow small!\" said the Wizard to the pincers, and at once they became  small and he threw them into the black bag.    \"I guess, friends, it's all up with us, this time,\" remarked Cap'n  Bill, with a dismal sigh.    \"Please tell Ozma, Dorothy,\" said Trot, \"that we got into trouble  trying to get her a nice birthday present.  Then she'll forgive us.  The Magic Flower is lovely and wonderful, but it's just a lure to catch  folks on this dreadful island and then destroy them.  You'll have a  nice birthday party, without us, I'm sure; and I hope, Dorothy, that  none of you in the Emerald City will forget me--or dear ol' Cap'n Bill.\"          19.  Dorothy and the Bumble Bees      Dorothy was greatly distressed and had hard work to keep the tears from  her eyes.    \"Is that all you can do, Wizard?\" she asked the little man.    \"It's all I can think of just now,\" he replied sadly.  \"But I intend to  keep on thinking as long--as long--well, as long as thinking will do  any good.\"    They were all silent for a time, Dorothy and the Wizard sitting  thoughtfully on the raft, and Trot and Cap'n Bill sitting thoughtfully  on the toadstools and growing gradually smaller and smaller in size.    Suddenly Dorothy said: \"Wizard, I've thought of something!\"    \"What have you thought of?\" he asked, looking at the little girl with  interest.    \"Can you remember the Magic Word that transforms people?\" she asked.    \"Of course,\" said he.    \"Then you can transform Trot and Cap'n Bill into birds or bumblebees,  and they can fly away to the other shore.  When they're there, you can  transform 'em into their reg'lar shapes again!\"    \"Can you do that, Wizard?\" asked Cap'n Bill, eagerly.    \"I think so.\"    \"Roots an' all?\" inquired Trot.    \"Why, the roots are now a part of you, and if you were transformed to a  bumblebee the whole of you would be transformed, of course, and you'd  be free of this awful island.\"    \"All right; do it!\" cried the sailor-man.    So the Wizard said slowly and distinctly:    \"I want Trot and Cap'n Bill to become bumblebees--Pyrzqxgl!\"    Fortunately, he pronounced the Magic Word in the right way, and  instantly Trot and Cap'n Bill vanished from view, and up from the  places where they had been flew two bumblebees.    \"Hooray!\" shouted Dorothy in delight; \"they're saved!\"    \"I guess they are,\" agreed the Wizard, equally delighted.    The bees hovered over the raft an instant and then flew across the  river to where the Lion and the Tiger waited.  The Wizard picked up the  paddle and paddled the raft across as fast as he could.  When it  reached the river bank, both Dorothy and the Wizard leaped ashore and  the little man asked excitedly:    \"Where are the bees?\"    \"The bees?\" inquired the Lion, who was half asleep and did not know  what had happened on the Magic Isle.    \"Yes; there were two of them.\"    \"Two bees?\" said the Hungry Tiger, yawning.  \"Why, I ate one of them  and the Cowardly Lion ate the other.\"    \"Goodness gracious!\" cried Dorothy horrified.    \"It was little enough for our lunch,\" remarked the Tiger, \"but the bees  were the only things we could find.\"    \"How dreadful!\" wailed Dorothy, wringing her hands in despair.  \"You've  eaten Trot and Cap'n Bill.\"    But just then she heard a buzzing overhead and two bees alighted on her  shoulder.    \"Here we are,\" said a small voice in her ear.  \"I'm Trot, Dorothy.\"    \"And I'm Cap'n Bill,\" said the other bee.    Dorothy almost fainted, with relief, and the Wizard, who was close by  and had heard the tiny voices, gave a laugh and said:    \"You are not the only two bees in the forest, it seems, but I advise  you to keep away from the Lion and the Tiger until you regain your  proper forms.\"    \"Do it now, Wizard!\" advised Dorothy.  \"They're so small that you never  can tell what might happen to 'em.\"    So the Wizard gave the command and pronounced the Magic Word, and in  the instant Trot and Cap'n Bill stood beside them as natural as before  they had met their fearful adventure.  For they were no longer small in  size, because the Wizard had transformed them from bumblebees into the  shapes and sizes that nature had formerly given them.  The ugly roots  on their feet had disappeared with the transformation.    While Dorothy was hugging Trot, and Trot was softly crying because she  was so happy, the Wizard shook hands with Cap'n Bill and congratulated  him on his escape.  The old sailor-man was so pleased that he also  shook the Lion's paw and took off his hat and bowed politely to the  cage of monkeys.    Then Cap'n Bill did a curious thing.  He went to a big tree and, taking  out his knife, cut away a big, broad piece of thick bark.  Then he sat  down on the ground and after taking a roll of stout cord from his  pocket--which seemed to be full of all sorts of things--he proceeded to  bind the flat piece of bark to the bottom of his good foot, over the  leather sole.    \"What's that for?\" inquired the Wizard.    \"I hate to be stumped,\" replied the sailor-man; \"so I'm goin' back to  that island.\"    \"And get enchanted again?\" exclaimed Trot, with evident disapproval.    \"No; this time I'll dodge the magic of the island.  I noticed that my  wooden leg didn't get"]]]
