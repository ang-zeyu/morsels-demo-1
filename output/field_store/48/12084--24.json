Does it immediately burst forth with considerable magnitude, or does it  begin as the smallest visible speck, and gradually grow? When several  spots coalesce into one, how do they do it? When a spot breaks up into  several pieces, what is the seeming nature of the process? How do the  groups of brilliant points called faculae come, change, and grow? All  these questions must no doubt be answered in various ways, according to  the behavior of the particular spot, but the record is rather meagre,  and the conscientious and industrious amateur will be able to amuse  himself by adding to it, and possibly may make valuable contributions  to science in the same way.    Still another branch of astronomical observation, in which industry and  skill count for more than expensive instruments, is the search for new  comets. This requires a very practised eye, in order that the comet may  be caught among the crowd of stars which flit across the field of view  as the telescope is moved. It is also necessary to be well acquainted  with a number of nebulae which look very much like comets. The search  can be made with almost any small telescope, if one is careful to use a  very low power. With a four-inch telescope a power not exceeding twenty  should be employed. To search with ease, and in the best manner, the  observer should have what among astronomers is familiarly known as a  \"broken-backed telescope.\" This instrument has the eye-piece on the end  of the axis, where one would never think of looking for it. By turning  the instrument on this axis, it sweeps from one horizon through the  zenith and over to the other horizon without the observer having to  move his head. This is effected by having a reflector in the central  part of the instrument, which throws the rays of light at right angles  through the axis.    [Illustration: THE \"BROKEN-BACKED COMET-SEEKER\"]    How well this search can be conducted by observers with limited means  at their disposal is shown by the success of several American  observers, among whom Messrs. W. R. Brooks, E. E. Barnard, and Lewis  Swift are well known. The cometary discoveries of these men afford an  excellent illustration of how much can be done with the smallest means  when one sets to work in the right spirit.    The larger number of wonderful telescopic objects are to be sought for  far beyond the confines of the solar system, in regions from which  light requires years to reach us. On account of their great distance,  these objects generally require the most powerful telescopes to be seen  in the best manner; but there are quite a number within the range of  the amateur. Looking at the Milky Way, especially its southern part, on  a clear winter or summer evening, tufts of light will be seen here and  there. On examining these tufts with a telescope, they will be found to  consist of congeries of stars. Many of these groups are of the greatest  beauty, with only a moderate optical power. Of all the groups in the  Milky Way the best known is that in the sword-handle of Perseus, which  may be seen during the greater part of the year, and is distinctly  visible to the naked eye as a patch of diffused light. With the  telescope there are seen in this patch two closely connected clusters  of stars, or perhaps we ought rather to say two centres of condensation.    Another object of the same class is Proesepe in the constellation  Cancer. This can be very distinctly seen by the naked eye on a clear  moonless night in winter or spring as a faint nebulous object,  surrounded by three small stars. The smallest telescope shows it as a  group of stars.    Of all stellar objects, the great nebula of Orion is that which has  most fascinated the astronomers of two centuries. It is distinctly  visible to the naked eye, and may be found without difficulty on any  winter night. The three bright stars forming the sword-belt of Orion  are known to every one who has noticed that constellation. Below this  belt is seen another triplet of stars, not so bright, and lying in a  north and south direction. The middle star of this triplet is the great  nebula. At first the naked eye sees nothing to distinguish it from  other stars, but if closely scanned it will be seen to have a hazy  aspect. A four-inch telescope will show its curious form. Not the least  interesting of its features are the four stars known as the  \"Trapezium,\" which are located in a dark region near its centre. In  fact, the whole nebula is dotted with stars, which add greatly to the  effect produced by its mysterious aspect.    The great nebula of Andromeda is second only to that of Orion in  interest. Like the former, it is distinctly visible to the naked eye,  having the aspect of a faint comet. The most curious feature of this  object is that although the most powerful telescopes do not resolve it  into stars, it appears in the spectroscope as if it were solid matter  shining by its own light.    The above are merely selections from the countless number of objects  which the heavens offer to telescopic study. Many such are described in  astronomical works, but the amateur can gratify his curiosity to almost  any extent by searching them out for himself.    [Illustration with caption: NEBULA IN ORION]    Ever since 1878 a red spot, unlike any before noticed, has generally  been visible on Jupiter. At first it was for several years a very  conspicuous object, but gradually faded away, so that since 1890 it has  been made out only with difficulty. But it is now regarded as a  permanent feature of the planet. There is some reason to believe it was  occasionally seen long before attention was first attracted to it.  Doubtless, when it can be seen at all, practice in observing such  objects is more important than size of telescope.          VI    WHAT THE ASTRONOMERS ARE DOING      In no field of science has human knowledge been more extended in our  time than in that of astronomy. Forty years ago astronomical research  seemed quite barren of results of great interest or value to our race.  The observers of the world were working on a traditional system,  grinding out results in an endless course, without seeing any prospect  of the great generalizations to which they might ultimately lead. Now  this is all changed. A new instrument, the spectroscope, has been  developed, the extent of whose revelations we are just beginning to  learn, although it has been more than thirty years in use. The  application of photography has been so extended that, in some important  branches of astronomical work, the observer simply photographs the  phenomenon which he is to study, and then makes his observation on the  developed negative.    The world of astronomy is one of the busiest that can be found to-day,  and the writer proposes, with the reader's courteous consent, to take  him on a stroll through it and see what is going on. We may begin our  inspection with a body which is, for us, next to the earth, the most  important in the universe. I mean the sun. At the Greenwich Observatory  the sun has for more than twenty years been regularly photographed on  every clear day, with the view of determining the changes going on in  its spots. In recent years these observations have been supplemented by  others, made at stations in India and Mauritius, so that by the  combination of all it is quite exceptional to have an entire day pass  without at least one photograph being taken. On these observations must  mainly rest our knowledge of the curious cycle of change in the solar  spots, which goes through a period of about eleven years, but of which  no one has as yet been able to establish the cause.    This Greenwich system has been extended and improved by an American.  Professor George E. Hale, formerly Director of the Yerkes Observatory,  has devised an instrument for taking photographs of the sun by a single  ray of the spectrum. The light emitted by calcium, the base of lime,  and one of the substances most abundant in the sun, is often selected  to impress the plate.    The Carnegie Institution has recently organized an enterprise for  carrying on the study of the sun under a combination of better  conditions than were ever before enjoyed. The first requirement in such  a case is the ablest and most enthusiastic worker in the field, ready  to devote all his energies to its cultivation. This requirement is  found in the person of Professor Hale himself. The next requirement is  an atmosphere of the greatest transparency, and a situation at a high  elevation above sea-level, so that the passage of light from the sun to  the observer shall be obstructed as little as possible by the mists and  vapors near the earth's surface. This requirement is reached by placing  the observatory on Mount Wilson, near Pasadena, California, where the  climate is found to be the best of any in the United States, and  probably not exceeded by that of any other attainable point in the  world. The third requirement is the best of instruments, specially  devised to meet the requirements. In this respect we may be sure that  nothing attainable by human ingenuity will be found wanting.    Thus provided, Professor Hale has entered upon the task of studying the  sun, and recording from day to day all the changes going on in it,  using specially devised instruments for each purpose in view.  Photography is made use of through almost the entire investigation. A  full description of the work would require an enumeration of technical  details, into which we need not enter at present. Let it, therefore,  suffice to say in a general way that the study of the sun is being  carried on on a scale, and with an energy worthy of the most important  subject that presents itself to the astronomer. Closely associated with  this work is that of Professor Langley and Dr. Abbot, at the  Astro-Physical Observatory of the Smithsonian Institution, who have  recently"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4075"],[0,"The Intrusion of Jimmy (#18)"],[1,"\"says there's only one rhyme in the English language to 'burglar,'  and that's 'gurgler--' unless you count 'pergola'! He says--\"    \"Personally,\" said Jimmy, with a glance at McEachern, \"I have rather  a sympathy for burglars. After all, they are one of the hardest-working  classes in existence. They toil while everybody else is  asleep. Besides, a burglar is only a practical socialist. People  talk a lot about the redistribution of wealth. The burglar goes out  and does it. I have found burglars some of the decentest criminals I  have ever met.\"    \"I despise burglars!\" ejaculated Lady Julia, with a suddenness that  stopped Jimmy's eloquence as if a tap had been turned off. \"If I  found one coming after my jewels, and I had a pistol, I'd shoot  him.\"    Jimmy met McEachern's eye, and smiled kindly at him. The  ex-policeman was looking at him with the gaze of a baffled, but  malignant basilisk.    \"I take very good care no one gets a chance at your diamonds, my  dear,\" said Sir Thomas, without a blush. \"I have had a steel box  made for me,\" he added to the company in general, \"with a special  lock. A very ingenious arrangement. Quite unbreakable, I imagine.\"    Jimmy, with Molly's story fresh in his mind, could not check a rapid  smile. Mr. McEachern, watching intently, saw it. To him, it was  fresh evidence, if any had been wanted, of Jimmy's intentions and of  his confidence of success. McEachern's brow darkened. During the  rest of the meal, tense thought rendered him even more silent than  was his wont at the dinner-table. The difficulty of his position  was, he saw, great. Jimmy, to be foiled, must be watched, and how  could he watch him?    It was not until the coffee arrived that he found an answer to the  question. With his first cigarette came the idea. That night, in his  room, before going to bed, he wrote a letter. It was an unusual  letter, but, singularly enough, almost identical with one Sir Thomas  Blunt had written that very morning.    It was addressed to the Manager of Dodson's Private Inquiry Agency,  of Bishopsgate Street, E. C., and ran as follows:    Sir,--    On receipt of this, kindly send down one of your smartest men.  Instruct him to stay at the village inn in character of American  seeing sights of England, and anxious to inspect Dreever Castle. I  will meet him in the village and recognize him as old New York  friend, and will then give him further instructions. Yours  faithfully,    J. McEACHERN.    P. S. Kindly not send a rube, but a real smart man.      This brief, but pregnant letter cost some pains in its composition.  McEachern was not a ready writer. But he completed it at last to his  satisfaction. There was a crisp purity in the style that pleased  him. He sealed up the envelope, and slipped it into his pocket. He  felt more at ease now. Such was the friendship that had sprung up  between Sir Thomas Blunt and himself as the result of the jewel  episode in Paris that he could count with certainty on the  successful working of his scheme. The grateful knight would not be  likely to allow any old New York friend of his preserver to languish  at the village inn. The sleuth-hound would at once be installed at  the castle, where, unsuspected by Jimmy, he could keep an eye on the  course of events. Any looking after that Mr. James Pitt might  require could safely be left in the hands of this expert.    With considerable fervor, Mr. McEachern congratulated himself on his  astuteness. With Jimmy above stairs and Spike below, the  sleuth-hound would have his hands full.          CHAPTER XV    MR. MCEACHERN INTERVENES      Life at the castle during the first few days of his visit filled  Jimmy with a curious blend of emotions, mainly unpleasant. Fate, in  its pro-Jimmy capacity, seemed to be taking a rest. In the first  place, the part allotted to him was not that of Lord Herbert, the  character who talked to Molly most of the time. The instant  Charteris learned from Lord Dreever that Jimmy had at one time  actually been on the stage professionally, he decided that Lord  Herbert offered too little scope for the new man's talents.    \"Absolutely no good to you, my dear chap,\" he said. \"It's just a  small dude part. He's simply got to be a silly ass.\"    Jimmy pleaded that he could be a sillier ass than anybody living;  but Charteris was firm.    \"No,\" he said. \"You must be Captain Browne. Fine acting part. The  biggest in the piece. Full of fat lines. Spennie was to have played  it, and we were in for the worst frost in the history of the stage.  Now you've come, it's all right. Spennie's the ideal Lord Herbert.  He's simply got to be him-self. We've got a success now, my boy.  Rehearsal after lunch. Don't be late.\" And he was off to beat up the  rest of the company.    From that moment, Jimmy's troubles began. Charteris was a young man  in whom a passion for the stage was ineradicably implanted. It  mattered nothing to him during these days that the sun shone, that  it was pleasant on the lake, and that Jimmy would have given five  pounds a minute to be allowed to get Molly to himself for half-an-hour  every afternoon. All he knew or cared about was that the local  nobility and gentry were due to arrive at the castle within a week,  and that, as yet, very few of the company even knew their lines.  Having hustled Jimmy into the part of CAPTAIN BROWNE, he gave his  energy free play. He conducted rehearsals with a vigor that  occasionally almost welded the rabble he was coaching into something  approaching coherency. He painted scenery, and left it about--wet,  and people sat on it. He nailed up horseshoes for luck, and they  fell on people. But nothing daunted him. He never rested.    \"Mr. Charteris,\" said Lady Julia, rather frigidly, after one  energetic rehearsal, \"is indefatigable. He whirled me about!\"    It was perhaps his greatest triumph, properly considered, that he  had induced Lady Julia to take a part in his piece; but to the born  organizer of amateur theatricals no miracle of this kind is  impossible, and Charteris was one of the most inveterate organizers  in the country. There had been some talk--late at night, in the  billiard room--of his being about to write in a comic footman role  for Sir Thomas; but it had fallen through, not, it was felt, because  Charteris could not have hypnotized his host into undertaking the  part, but rather because Sir Thomas was histrionically unfit.    Mainly as a result of the producer's energy, Jimmy found himself one  of a crowd, and disliked the sensation. He had not experienced much  difficulty in mastering the scenes in which he appeared; but  unfortunately those who appeared with him had. It occurred to Jimmy  daily, after he had finished \"running through the lines\" with a  series of agitated amateurs, male and female, that for all practical  purposes he might just as well have gone to Japan. In this confused  welter of rehearsers, his opportunities of talking with Molly were  infinitesimal. And, worse, she did not appear to mind. She was  cheerful and apparently quite content to be engulfed in a crowd.  Probably, he thought with some melancholy, if she met his eye and  noted in it a distracted gleam, she put it down to the cause that  made other eyes in the company gleam distractedly during this week.    Jimmy began to take a thoroughly jaundiced view of amateur  theatricals, and of these amateur theatricals in particular. He felt  that in the electric flame department of the infernal regions there  should be a special gridiron, reserved exclusively for the man who  invented these performances, so diametrically opposed to the true  spirit of civilization. At the close of each day, he cursed  Charteris with unfailing regularity.    There was another thing that disturbed him. That he should be unable  to talk with Molly was an evil, but a negative evil. It was  supplemented by one that was positive. Even in the midst of the  chaos of rehearsals, he could not help noticing that Molly and Lord  Dreever were very much together. Also--and this was even more  sinister--he observed that both Sir Thomas Blunt and Mr. McEachern  were making determined efforts to foster the state of affairs.    Of this, he had sufficient proof one evening when, after scheming  and plotting in a way that had made the great efforts of Machiavelli  and Richelieu seem like the work of raw novices, he had cut Molly out  from the throng, and carried her off for the alleged purpose of  helping him feed the chickens. There were, as he had suspected,  chickens attached to the castle. They lived in a little world of  noise and smells at the back of the stables. Bearing an iron pot  full of a poisonous-looking mash, and accompanied by Molly, he had  felt for perhaps a minute and a half like a successful general. It  is difficult to be romantic when you are laden with chicken-feed in  an unwieldy iron pot, but he had resolved that this portion of the  proceedings should be brief. The birds should dine that evening on  the quick-lunch principle. Then--to the more fitting surroundings of  the rose-garden! There was plenty of time before the hour of the  sounding of the dressing-gong. Perhaps, even a row on the lake--    \"What ho!\" said a voice.    Behind them, with a propitiatory smile on his face, stood his  lordship of Dreever.    \"My uncle told me I should find you out here. What have you got in  there, Pitt? Is this what you feed them on? I say, you know, queer  coves, hens! I wouldn't touch that stuff for a fortune, what? Looks  to me poisonous.\"    He met Jimmy's eye, and stopped. There was that in Jimmy's eye that  would have stopped an avalanche. His lordship twiddled his fingers  in pink embarrassment.    \"Oh, look!\" said Molly. \"There's a poor little chicken out there in  the cold. It hasn't had a morsel. Give me the spoon, Mr. Pitt. Here,  chick, chick! Don't be silly, I'm not going to hurt you. I've  brought you your dinner.\"    She moved off in pursuit of "]]]
