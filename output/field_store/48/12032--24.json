This was at length the case, and we advanced with  extra care. The jungle became so thick that it was almost impossible to  proceed. I wore a thick flaxen shirt which would not tear. This had  short sleeves, as I was accustomed to bare arms from a few inches above  the elbow. Not only my shirt, but the tough skin of my arms was every  now and then hooked up fast by these dreadful thorns, and at last it  appeared impossible to proceed. Just at that moment there was a sudden  rush, a shrill trumpet, and the jungle crashed around us in magnificent  style to those who enjoy such excitement, and a herd of elephants dashed  through the dense thicket and consolidated themselves into a mighty  block as they endeavoured to force down the tough thorny mass ahead of  them. This was a grand opportunity to run in, but a phalanx of opposing  rumps like the sterns of Dutch vessels in a crowd rendered it impossible  to shoot, or to pass ahead of the perplexed animals. A female elephant  suddenly wheeled round, and charged straight into us; fortunately I  killed her with a forehead shot exactly below the boss or projection  above the trunk. I now took a spare rifle, the half-pounder, and fired  into the flank of the largest elephant in the herd, just behind the last  rib, the shot striking obliquely, thus aimed to reach the lungs, as I  could not see any of the fore portion of the body.    The dense compressed thorny mass of jungle offered such resistance that  it was some time before it gave way before the united pressure of these  immense animals. At length it yielded as the herd crashed through, but  it then closed again upon us and made following impossible. However, we  felt sure that the elephant I had hit with the half-pound explosive  shell would die, and after creeping through upon the tracks with the  greatest difficulty for about 150 yards, we found it lying dead upon its  side.    The whole morning was occupied in cutting up the flesh and making a  post-mortem examination. We found the inside partially destroyed by the  explosive shell, which had shattered the lungs, but there was an old  wound still open where a bullet had entered the chest, and missing the  heart and lungs in an oblique course, it had passed through the stomach,  then through the cavity of the body beneath the ribs and flank, and had  penetrated the fleshy mass inside the thigh. In that great resisting  cushion of strong muscles the bullet had expended its force, and found  rest from its extraordinary course of penetration. After some trouble, I  not only traced its exact route, but I actually discovered the  projectile embedded in a foul mass of green pus, which would evidently  have been gradually absorbed without causing serious damage to the  animal. To my surprise, it was my own No. 10 two-groove conical bullet,  composed of twelve parts lead and one of quicksilver, which I had fired  when this elephant had advanced towards me at night, forty-two days ago,  and 22 miles, as far as I could ascertain, from the spot where I had now  killed it. The superior size of this animal to the remainder of the herd  had upon both occasions attracted my special attention, hence the fact  of selection, but I was surprised that any animal should have recovered  from such a raking shot. The cavity of the body abounded with hairy  worms about 2 inches in length. These had escaped from the stomach  through the two apertures made by the bullet; and upon an examination of  the contents, I found a great number of the same parasites crawling  among the food, while others were attached to the mucous membrane of the  paunch. This fact exhibits the recuperative power of an elephant in  recovering from a severe internal injury.    The natives of Central Africa have a peculiar method of destroying them,  by dropping a species of enormous dagger from the branch of a tree. The  blade of this instrument is about 2 feet in length, very sharp on both  edges, and about 3 inches in width at the base. It is secured in a  handle about 18 inches long, the top of which is knobbed; upon this  extremity a mass of well-kneaded tenacious clay mixed with chopped straw  is fixed, weighing 10 or 12 lbs., or even more. When a large herd of  elephants is discovered in a convenient locality, the hunt is thus  arranged:--A number of men armed with these formidable drop-spears or  daggers ascend all the largest and most shady trees throughout the  neighbouring forest. In a great hunt there may be some hundred trees  thus occupied. When all is arranged, the elephants are driven and forced  into the forest, to which they naturally retreat as a place of refuge.  It is their habit to congregate beneath large shady trees when thus  disturbed, in complete ignorance of the fact that the assassins are  already among the branches. When an elephant stands beneath a tree thus  manned, the hunter drops his weighted spearhead so as to strike the back  just behind the shoulder. The weight of the clay lump drives the sharp  blade up to the hilt, as it descends from a height of 10 or 12 feet  above the animal. Sometimes a considerable number may be beneath one  tree, in which case several may be speared in a similar manner. This  method of attack is specially fatal, as the elephants, in retreating  through the forest, brush the weighted handle of the spear-blade against  the opposing branches; these act as levers in cutting the inside of the  animal by every movement of the weapon, and should this be well centred  in the back there is no escape.    There is no animal that is more persistently pursued than the elephant,  as it affords food in wholesale supply to the Africans, who consume the  flesh, while the hide is valuable for shields; the fat when boiled down  is highly esteemed by the natives, and the ivory is of extreme value. No  portion of the animal is wasted in Africa, although in Ceylon the  elephant is considered worthless, and is allowed to rot uselessly upon  the ground where it fell to die.    The professional hunters that are employed by European traders shoot the  elephant with enormous guns, or rifles, which are generally rested upon  a forked stick driven into the ground. In this manner they approach to  about 50 yards' distance, and fire, if possible simultaneously, two  shots behind the shoulder. If these shots are well placed, the elephant,  if female, will fall at once, but if a large male, it will generally run  for perhaps 100 or more yards until it is forced to halt, when it  quickly falls, and dies from suffocation, if the lungs are pierced.    The grandest of all hunters are the Hamran Arabs, upon the Settite  river, on the borders of Abyssinia, who have no other weapon but the  heavy two-edged sword. I gave an intimate account of these wonderful  Nimrods many years ago in the _Nile Tributaries of Abyssinia_, but it is  impossible to treat upon the elephant without some reference to these  extraordinary people.    Since I visited that country in 1861, the published account of those  travels attracted several parties of the best class of ubiquitous  Englishmen, and I regret to hear that all those mighty hunters who  accompanied me have since been killed in the desperate hand-to-hand  encounters with wild elephants. Their life is a constant warfare with  savage beasts, therefore it may be expected that the termination is a  death upon their field of battle, invariably sword in hand.    James Bruce, the renowned African traveller of the last century, was the  first to describe the Agagheers of Abyssinia, and nothing could be more  graphic than his description both of the people and the countries they  inhabit, through which I have followed in Bruce's almost forgotten  footsteps, with the advantage of possessing his interesting book as my  guide wheresoever I went in 1861. Since that journey, the deplorable  interference of England in Egypt which resulted in the abandonment of  the Soudan and the sacrifice of General Gordon at Khartoum has  completely severed the link of communication that we had happily  established established, which had laid the foundations for future  civilisation. The splendid sword-hunters of the Hamran Arabs, who were  our friends in former days, have been converted into enemies by the  meddling of the British Government with affairs which they could not  understand. It is painful to look back to the past, when Lady Baker and  myself, absolutely devoid of all escort, passed more than twelve months  in exploring the wildest portions of the Soudan, attended only by one  Egyptian servant, assisted by some Arab boys which we picked up in the  desert among the Arab tribes. In those days the name of England was  respected, although not fairly understood. There was a vague impression  in the Arab mind that it was the largest country upon earth; that its  Government was the emblem of perfection; that the military power of the  country was overwhelming (having conquered India); and that the English  people always spoke the truth, and never forsook their friends in the  moment of distress. There was also an idea that England was the only  European Power which regarded the Mussulmans with a friendly eye, and  that, were it not for British protection, the Russians would eat the  Sultan and overthrow the mosques, to trample upon the Mahommedan power  in Constantinople. England was therefore regarded as the friend and the  ally of the Mahommedans; it was known that we had together fought  against the Russians, and it was believed that we were always ready to  fight in the same cause when called upon by the Sultan. All British  merchandise was looked upon as the ne plus ultra of purity and  integrity; there could be no doubt of the quality of goods, provided  that they were of English manufacture.    An Englishman cannot show his face among those people at the present  day. The myth has been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3668"],[0,"The Albert N'Yanza, Great Basin of the Nile, And Explorations of the Nile (#18)"],[1,"expressed his conviction that the Luta N'zige must be a second  source of the Nile, and that geographers would be dissatisfied that he  had not explored it. To me this was most gratifying. I had been much  disheartened at the idea that the great work was accomplished, and that  nothing remained for exploration; I even said to Speke, \"Does not one  leaf of the laurel remain for me?\" I now heard that the field was not  only open, but that an additional interest was given to the exploration  by the proof that the Nile flowed out of one great lake, the Victoria,  but that it evidently must derive an additional supply from an unknown  lake as it entered it at the NORTHERN extremity, while the body of the  lake came from the south. The fact of a great body of water such as the  Luta N'zige extending in a direct line from south to north, while the  general system of drainage of the Nile was from the same direction,  showed most conclusively, that the Luta N'zige, if it existed in the  form assumed, must have an important position in the basin of the Nile.    My expedition had naturally been rather costly, and being in excellent  order it would have been heartbreaking to have returned fruitlessly. I  therefore arranged immediately for my departure, and Speke most kindly  wrote in my journal such instructions as might be useful. I therefore  copy them verbatim:    \"Before you leave this be sure you engage two men, one speaking the Bari  or Madi language, and one speaking Kinyoro, to be your interpreters  through the whole journey, for there are only two distinct families of  languages in the country, though of course some dialectic differences,  which can be easily overcome by anybody who knows the family language.  . . . Now, as you are bent on first going to visit Kamrasi M'Kamma, or  King of Unyoro, and then to see as much of the western countries  bordering on the little Luta N'zige, or `dead locust' lake, as possible,  go in company with the ivory hunters across the Asua river to Apuddo  eight marches, and look for game to the east of that village. Two  marches further on will bring you to Panyoro, where there are antelopes  in great quantity; and in one march more the Turks' farthest outpost,  Faloro, will be reached, where you had better form a depot, and make a  flying trip across the White Nile to Koshi for the purpose of inquiring  what tribes live to west and south of it, especially of the Wallegga;  how the river comes from the south, and where it is joined by the little  Luta N'zige. Inquire also after the country of Chopi, and what  difficulties or otherwise you would have to overcome if you followed up  the left bank of the White river to Kamrasi's; because, if found easy,  it would be far nearer and better to reach Kamrasi that way than going  through the desert jungles of Ukidi, as we went. This is the way I  should certainly go myself, but if you do not like the look of it,  preserve your information well; and after returning to Faloro, make Koki  per Chougi in two marches, and tell old Chougi you wish to visit his  M'Kamma Kamrasi, for Chougi was appointed Governor-general of that place  by Kamrasi to watch the Wakidi who live between his residence and Chopi,  which is the next country you will reach after passing through the  jungles of Ukidi and crossing the Nile below Karuma Falls. Arrived at  Chopi, inquire for the residence of the Katikiro or commander-in-chief,  who will show you great respect, give you cows and pombe, and send  messengers on to Kamrasi to acquaint him of your intention to visit him.  This is the richest part of Kamrasi's possessions, and by a little  inquiry you will learn much about the lake. Kamrasi's brother Rionga  lives on a river island within one march of this. They are deadly  enemies and always fighting, so if you made a mistake and went to  Rionga's first, as the Turks would wish you to do, all travelling in  Unyoro would be cut off. Tell the Katikiro all your plans frankly, and  remark earnestly upon my great displeasure at Kamrasi's having detained  me so long in his country without deigning to see me, else he may be  assured no other white man will ever take the trouble to see him. We  came down the river in boats from Kamrasi's to Chopi, but the boatmen  gave much trouble, therefore it would be better for you to go overland.  Kamrasi will most likely send Kidgwiga, an excellent officer, to escort  you to his palace, but if he does not, ask after him; you could not have  a better man.    \"Arrived at Kamrasi's, insist upon seeing all his fat wives and  brothers. Find out all you can about his pedigree, and ask for leave to  follow up the lake from its JUNCTION with the Nile to Utumbi, and then  crossing to its northern bank follow it down to Ullegga and Koshi. If  you are so fortunate as to reach Utumbi, and don't wish to go farther  south, inquire well about Ruanda, the M'Fumbiro mountains, if there is  any copper in Ruanda, and whether or not the people of those countries  receive Simbi (the cowrie shell) or any other articles of merchandise  from the west coast, guarding well that no confusion is made with the  trade of Karagwe, for Rumanika sends men to Utumbi ivory-hunting  continually. \"Remember well that the Wahuma are most likely Gallas; this  question is most interesting, and the more you can gather of their  history, since they crossed the White Nile, the better. Formerly Unyoro,  Uganda, and Uddhu were all united in one vast kingdom called Kittara,  but this name is now only applied to certain portions of that kingdom.    \"Nothing is known of the Mountains of the Moon to the westward of  Ruanda. In Unyoro the king will feed you; beyond that I suspect you will  have to buy food with beads.\"    Such was the information most kindly written by Speke, which, in  addition to a map drawn by Captain Grant, and addressed to the Secretary  of the Royal Geographical Society, was to be my guide in the important  exploration resolved upon. I am particular in publishing these details,  in order to show the perfect freedom from jealousy of both Captains  Speke and Grant. Unfortunately, in most affairs of life, there is not  only fair emulation, but ambition is too often combined with intense  jealousy of others. Had this miserable feeling existed in the minds of  Speke and Grant, they would have returned to England with the sole  honour of discovering the source of the Nile; but in their true devotion  to geographical science and especially to the specific object of their  expedition they gave me all information to assist in the completion of  the great problem--the \"Nile Sources.\"    We were all ready to start. Speke and Grant, an their party of  twenty-two people, for Egypt, and I in the opposite direction. At this  season there were many boats at Gondokoro belonging to the traders'  parties, among which were four belonging to Mr. Petherick, three of  which were open cargo boats, and one remarkably nice diahbiah, named the  \"Kathleen,\" that was waiting for Mrs. Petherick and her husband, who  were supposed to be at their trading station, the Niambara, about  seventy miles west of Gondokoro; but no accounts had been heard of them.  On the 20th February they suddenly arrived from the Niambara, with their  people and ivory and were surprised at seeing so large a party of  English in so desolate a spot. It is a curious circumstance, that  although many Europeans had been as far south as Gondokoro, I was the  first Englishman that had ever reached it. We now formed a party of  four.    Gondokoro has a poor and sandy soil, so unproductive that corn is in the  greatest scarcity and is always brought from Khartoum by the annual  boats for the supply of the traders' people, who congregate there from  the interior, in the months of January and February, to deliver the  ivory for shipment to Khartoum. Corn is seldom or never less than eight  times the price at Khartoum; this is a great drawback to the country, as  each trading party that arrives with ivory from the interior brings with  it five or six hundred native porters, all of whom have to be fed during  their stay at Gondokoro, and in many cases, in times of scarcity, they  starve. This famine has given a bad name to the locality, and it is  accordingly difficult to procure porters from the interior, who  naturally fear starvation.    I was thus extremely sorry that I was obliged to refuse a supply of corn  to Mr. Petherick upon his application--an act of necessity, but not of  ill-nature upon my part, as I was obliged to leave a certain quantity in  depot at Gondokoro, in case I should be driven back from the interior,  in the event of which, without a supply in depot, utter starvation would  have been the fate of my party. Mr. Petherick accordingly despatched one  of his boats to the Shir tribe down the White Nile to purchase corn in  exchange for molotes (native hoes). The boat returned with corn on the  11th of March. On the 26th February, Speke and Grant sailed from  Gondokoro. Our hearts were too full to say more than a short \"God bless  you!\" They had won their victory; my work lay all before me. I watched  their boat until it turned the corner, and wished them in my heart all  honor for their great achievement. I trusted to sustain the name they  had won for English perseverance, and I looked forward to meeting them  again in dear old England, when I should have completed the work we had  so warmly planned together.        CHAPTER III.    GUN ACCIDENT.    A DAY before the departure of Speke and Grant from Gondokoro, an event  occurred which appeared as a bad omen to the superstitions of my men. I  had ordered the diahbiah to be prepared for sailing: thus, the cargo  having been landed and the boat cleared and washed, we were sitting in  the cabin, when a sudden explosion close to the windows startled us from  our seats, and the consternation of a crowd of men who were on the bank,  showed that some accident"]]]
