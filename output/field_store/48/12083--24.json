My heart is ill at ease, my mind  disturbed;--then how shall I do any sensible thinking or work?  Why is this? Most people think we are already married; this  enrages the mother and the poor girl and I are tormented almost  to death. All this can be easily relieved. Believe me it is  possible to live as cheaply in expensive Vienna as anywhere else;  it all depends on the housekeeping and the orderliness which is  never to be found in a young man especially if he be in love.  Whoever gets a wife such as I am going to have can count himself  fortunate. We shall live simply and quietly, and yet be happy.  Do not worry; for should I (which God forefend!) get ill today,  especially if I were married, I wager that the first of the  nobility would come to my help....I await your consent with  longing, best of fathers, I await it with confidence, my honor  and fame depend upon it.\"    (Vienna, July 27, 1782.)    238. \"Meanwhile my striving is to secure a small certainty; then  with the help of the contingencies, it will be easy to live here;  and then to marry. I beg of you, dearest and best of fathers,  listen to me! I have preferred my request, now listen to my  reasons. The calls of nature are as strong in me, perhaps  stronger, than in many a hulking fellow. I can not possibly live  like the majority of our young men. In the first place I have too  much religion, in the second too much love for my fellow man and  too great a sense of honor ever to betray a girl....\"    (Vienna, December 18, 1781. [The whole of this letter deserves to  be read by those who, misled by the reports, still deemed  trustworthy when Jahn published the first edition of his great  biography, believed that Mozart was a man of bad morals.  Unfortunately Mozart's candor in presenting his case to his  father can scarcely be adjusted to the requirements of a book  designed for general circulation. Let it suffice that in his  confession to his father Mozart puts himself on the ground of the  loftiest sexual purity, and stakes life and death on the  truthfulness of his statements. H.E.K.])    239. \"You surely can not be angry because I want to get married?  I think and believe that you will recognize best my piety and  honorable intentions in the circumstance. O, I could easily write  a long answer to your last letter, and offer many objections; but  my maxim is that it is not worth while to discuss matters that  do not affect me. I can't help it,--it's my nature. I am really  ashamed to defend myself when I find myself falsely accused;  I always think, the truth will out some day.\"    (Vienna, January 9, 1782, to his father. In the same letter he  continues: \"I can not be happy and contented without my dear  Constanze, and without your satisfied acquiescence, I could only  be half happy. Therefore, make me wholly happy.\")    240. \"As I have thought and said a thousand times I would gladly  leave everything in your hands with the greatest pleasure, but  since, so to speak, it is useless to you but to my advantage, I  deem it my duty to remember my wife and children.\"    (June 16, 1787, to his sister, concerning his inheritance from  his father who had died on May 28.)    241. \"Isn't it true that you are daily becoming more convinced of  the truth of my corrective sermons? Is not the amusement of a  fickle and capricious love far as the heavens from the  blessedness which true, sensible love brings with it? Do you not  often thank me in your heart for my instruction? You will soon  make me vain! But joking aside, you do owe me a modicum of  gratitude if you have made yourself worthy of Fraulein N., for I  certainly did not play the smallest role at your conversion.\"    (Prague, November 4, 1787, to a wealthy young friend, name  unknown.)    242. \"Pray believe anything you please about me but nothing ill.  There are persons who believe it is impossible to love a poor  girl without harboring wicked intentions; and the beautiful word  mistress is so lovely!--I am a Mozart, but a young and well  meaning Mozart. Among many faults I have this that I think that  the friends who know me, know me. Hence many words are not  necessary. If they do not know me where shall I find words  enough? It is bad enough that words and letters are necessary.\"    (Mannheim, February 22, 1778, to his father, who had rebuked him  for falling in love with Aloysia Weber, who afterward became his  sister-in-law.)        RELIGION        Mozart was of a deeply religious nature, reared in Salzburg where  his father was a member of the archiepiscopal chapel. Throughout  his life he remained a faithful son of the church, for whose  servants, however, he had little sympathy.    The one man whom Mozart hated from the bottom of his soul was  Archbishop Hieronymus of Salzburg who sought to put all possible  obstacles in the way of the youthful genius, and finally by the  most infamous of acts covered himself everlastingly with infamy.  Though Mozart frequently speaks angrily and bitterly of the  priests he always differentiates between religion, the church and  their servants. Like Beethoven, Mozart stood toward God in the  relationship of a child full of trust in his father.    His reliance on Providence was so utter that his words sometimes  sound almost fatalistic. His father harbored some rationalistic  ideas which were even more pronounced in Mozart, so that he  formed his own opinion concerning ecclesiastical ceremonies and  occasionally disregarded them. His cheery temperament made it  impossible that his religious life should be as profound as that  of Beethoven.        243. \"I hope that with the help of God, Miss Martha will get well  again. If not, you should not grieve too deeply, for God's will  is always the best. God will know whether it is better to be in  this world or the other.\"    (Bologna, September 29, 1770, to his mother and sister in  Salzburg. The young woman died soon after.)    244. \"Tell papa to put aside his fears; I live, with God ever  before me. I recognize His omnipotence, I fear His anger; I  acknowledge His love, too, His compassion and mercy towards all  His creatures, He will never desert those who serve Him. If  matters go according to His will they go according to mine;  consequently nothing can go wrong,--I must be satisfied and  happy.\"    (Augsburg, October 25, 1777, to his father, who was showering him  with exhortations on the tour which he made with his mother  through South Germany.)    245. \"Let come what will, nothing can go ill so long as it is the  will of God; and that it may so go is my daily prayer.\"    (Mannheim, December 6, 1777, to his father. Mozart was waiting  with some impatience to learn if he was to receive an appointment  from Elector Karl Theodore. It did not come.)    246. \"I know myself;--I know that I have so much religion that I  shall never be able to do a thing which I would not be willing  openly to do before the whole world; only the thought of meeting  persons on my journeys whose ideas are radically different from  mine (and those of all honest people) frightens me. Aside from  that they may do what they please. I haven't the heart to travel  with them, I would not have a single pleasant hour, I would not  know what to say to them; in a word I do not trust them. Friends  who have no religion are not stable.\"    (Mannheim, February 2, 1778, to his father. For the reasons  mentioned in the letter Mozart gave up his plan to travel to  Paris with the musicians Wendling and Ramen. In truth, perhaps,  his love affair with Aloysia Weber may have had something to do  with his resolve.)    247. \"I prayed to God for His mercy that all might go well, to  His greater glory, and the symphony began....Immediately after  the symphony full of joy I went into the Palais Royal, ate an  iced cream, prayed the rosary as I had promised to do, and went  home. I am always best contented at home and always will be, or  with a good, true, honest German.\"    (Paris, July 3, 1778, to his father. The symphony in question is  no longer in existence, although Mozart wanted to write it down  again at a later date.)    248. \"I must tell you my mother, my dear mother, is no more.--God  has called her to Himself; He wanted her, I see that clearly, and  I must submit to God's will. He gave her to me, and it was His to  take her away. My friend, I am comforted, not but now, but long  ago. By a singular grace of God I endured all with steadfastness  and composure. When her illness grew dangerous I prayed God for  two things only,--a happy hour of death for my mother, and  strength and courage for myself. God heard me in His loving  kindness, heard my prayer and bestowed the two mercies in largest  measure.\"    (Paris, July 3, 1778, to his good friend Bullinger, in Salzburg,  who was commissioned gently to bear the intelligence to Mozart's  father. At the same time Mozart, with considerate deception,  wrote to his father about his mother's illness without mentioning  her death.)    249. \"I believe, and nothing shall ever persuade me differently,  that no doctor, no man, no accident, can either give life to man  or take it away; it rests with God alone. Those are only the  instruments which He generally uses, though not always; we see  men sink down and fall over dead. When the time is come no  remedies can avail,--they accelerate death rather than retard  it....I do not say, therefore, that my mother will and must die,  that all hope is gone; she may recover and again be well and  sound,--but only if it is God's will.\"    (Paris, July 3, 1778, to his father, from whom he is concealing  the fact that his mother is dead. He is seeking to prepare him  for the intelligence which he has already commissioned Bullinger  to convey to the family.)    250. \"Under those melancholy circumstances I comforted myself  with three things, viz.: my complete and trustful submission to  the will of God, then the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4060"],[0,"The Renaissance: studies in art and poetry (#18)"],[1,"this curiosity came in conflict with the desire of  beauty; it tended to make him go too far below that outside of  things in which art really begins and ends.  This struggle between  the reason and its ideas, and the senses, the desire of beauty, is  the key to Leonardo's life at Milan--his restlessness, his endless  re-touchings, his odd experiments with colour.  How much must  he leave unfinished, how much recommence!  His problem was  the transmutation of ideas into images.  What he had attained so  far had been the mastery of that earlier Florentine style, with its  naïve and limited sensuousness.  Now he was to entertain in this  narrow medium those divinations of a humanity too wide for it,  that larger vision of the opening world, which is only not too  much for the great, irregular art of Shakespeare; and everywhere  the effort is visible in the work of his hands.  This agitation, this  [113] perpetual delay, give him an air of weariness and ennui.  To  others he seems to be aiming at an impossible effect, to do  something that art, that painting, can never do.  Often the  expression of physical beauty at this or that point seems strained  and marred in the effort, as in those heavy German foreheads--  too heavy and German for perfect beauty.    For there was a touch of Germany in that genius which, as  Goethe said, had \"thought itself weary\"--müde sich gedacht.  What an anticipation of modern Germany, for instance, in that  debate on the question whether sculpture or painting is the nobler  art!*  But there is this difference between him and the German,  that, with all that curious science, the German would have  thought nothing more was needed.  The name of Goethe himself  reminds one how great for the artist may be the danger of  overmuch science; how Goethe, who, in the Elective Affinities  and the first part of Faust, does transmute ideas into images, who  wrought many such transmutations, did not invariably find the  spell-word, and in the second part of Faust presents us with a  mass of science which has almost no artistic character at all.  But  Leonardo will never work till the happy moment comes--that  moment of bien-être, which to imaginative men is a moment of  invention.  On this he waits with [114] a perfect patience; other  moments are but a preparation, or after-taste of it.  Few men  distinguish between them as jealously as he.  Hence so many  flaws even in the choicest work.  But for Leonardo the distinction  is absolute, and, in the moment of bien-être, the alchemy  complete: the idea is stricken into colour and imagery: a cloudy  mysticism is refined to a subdued and graceful mystery, and  painting pleases the eye while it satisfies the soul.    This curious beauty is seen above all in his drawings, and in these  chiefly in the abstract grace of the bounding lines.  Let us take  some of these drawings, and pause over them awhile; and, first,  one of those at Florence--the heads of a woman and a little child,  set side by side, but each in its own separate frame.  First of all,  there is much pathos in the reappearance, in the fuller curves of  the face of the child, of the sharper, more chastened lines of the  worn and older face, which leaves no doubt that the heads are  those of a little child and its mother.  A feeling for maternity is  indeed always characteristic of Leonardo; and this feeling is  further indicated here by the half-humorous pathos of the  diminutive, rounded shoulders of the child.  You may note a like  pathetic power in drawings of a young man, seated in a stooping  posture, his face in his hands, as in sorrow; of a slave sitting in an  uneasy inclined attitude, in some brief interval of rest; of a small  Madonna and Child, [115] peeping sideways in half-reassured  terror, as a mighty griffin with batlike wings, one of Leonardo's  finest inventions, descends suddenly from the air to snatch up a  great wild beast wandering near them.  But note in these, as that  which especially belongs to art, the contour of the young man's  hair, the poise of the slave's arm above his head, and the curves  of the head of the child, following the little skull within, thin and  fine as some sea-shell worn by the wind.    Take again another head, still more full of sentiment, but of a  different kind, a little drawing in red chalk which every one will  remember who has examined at all carefully the drawings by old  masters at the Louvre.  It is a face of doubtful sex, set in the  shadow of its own hair, the cheek-line in high light against it,  with something voluptuous and full in the eye-lids and the lips.  Another drawing might pass for the same face in childhood, with  parched and feverish lips, but much sweetness in the loose, short-  waisted childish dress, with necklace and bulla, and in the  daintily bound hair.  We might take the thread of suggestion  which these two drawings offer, when thus set side by side, and,  following it through the drawings at Florence, Venice, and Milan,  construct a sort of series, illustrating better than anything else  Leonardo's type of womanly beauty.  Daughters of Herodias,  with their fantastic head-dresses knotted and folded so strangely  to leave the [116] dainty oval of the face disengaged, they are not  of the Christian family, or of Raphael's.  They are the  clairvoyants, through whom, as through delicate instruments, one  becomes aware of the subtler forces of nature, and the modes of  their action, all that is magnetic in it, all those finer conditions  wherein material things rise to that subtlety of operation which  constitutes them spiritual, where only the final nerve and the  keener touch can follow.  It is as if in certain significant examples  we actually saw those forces at their work on human flesh.  Nervous, electric, faint always with some inexplicable faintness,  these people seem to be subject to exceptional conditions, to feel  powers at work in the common air unfelt by others, to become, as  it were, the receptacle of them, and pass them on to us in a chain  of secret influences.    But among the more youthful heads there is one at Florence  which Love chooses for its own--the head of a young man, which  may well be the likeness of Andrea Salaino, beloved of Leonardo  for his curled and waving hair--belli capelli ricci e inanellati--  and afterwards his favourite pupil and servant.  Of all the  interests in living men and women which may have filled his life  at Milan, this attachment alone is recorded.  And in return  Salaino identified himself so entirely with Leonardo, that the  picture of Saint Anne, in the Louvre, has been attributed to him.  It illustrates Leonardo's usual choice of pupils, men [117] of  some natural charm of person or intercourse like Salaino, or men  of birth and princely habits of life like Francesco Melzi--men  with just enough genius to be capable of initiation into his secret,  for the sake of which they were ready to efface their own  individuality.  Among them, retiring often to the villa of the  Melzi at Canonica al Vaprio, he worked at his fugitive  manuscripts and sketches, working for the present hour, and for a  few only, perhaps chiefly for himself.  Other artists have been as  careless of present or future applause, in self-forgetfulness, or  because they set moral or political ends above the ends of art; but  in him this solitary culture of beauty seems to have hung upon a  kind of self-love, and a carelessness in the work of art of all but  art itself.  Out of the secret places of a unique temperament he  brought strange blossoms and fruits hitherto unknown; and for  him, the novel impression conveyed, the exquisite effect woven,  counted as an end in itself--a perfect end.    And these pupils of his acquired his manner so thoroughly, that  though the number of Leonardo's authentic works is very small  indeed, there is a multitude of other men's pictures through  which we undoubtedly see him, and come very near to his genius.  Sometimes, as in the little picture of the Madonna of the  Balances, in which, from the bosom of His mother, Christ weighs  the pebbles of the brook against the sins of men, we have a hand,  rough enough by [118] contrast, working upon some fine hint or  sketch of his.  Sometimes, as in the subjects of the Daughter of  Herodias and the Head of John the Baptist, the lost originals have  been re-echoed and varied upon again and again by Luini and  others.  At other times the original remains, but has been a mere  theme or motive, a type of which the accessories might be  modified or changed; and these variations have but brought out  the more the purpose, or expression of the original.  It is so with  the so-called Saint John the Baptist of the Louvre--one of the few  naked figures Leonardo painted--whose delicate brown flesh and  woman's hair no one would go out into the wilderness to seek,  and whose treacherous smile would have us understand  something far beyond the outward gesture or circumstance.  But  the long, reedlike cross in the hand, which suggests Saint John  the Baptist, becomes faint in a copy at the Ambrosian Library,  and disappears altogether in another version, in the Palazzo  Rosso at Genoa.  Returning from the latter to the original, we are  no longer surprised by Saint John's strange likeness to the  Bacchus which hangs near it, and which set Théophile Gautier  thinking of Heine's notion of decayed gods, who, to maintain  themselves, after the fall of paganism, took employment in the  new religion.  We recognise one of those symbolical inventions  in which the ostensible subject is used, not as matter for definite  pictorial realisation, but as the starting-point of a [119] train of  sentiment, subtle and vague as a piece of music.  No one ever  ruled over the mere subject in hand more entirely than Leonardo,  or bent it more dexterously to purely artistic ends.  And so it  comes to pass that though he handles sacred subjects"]]]
