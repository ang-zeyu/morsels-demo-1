The mob at this time was reported to number about four hundred      strong.        The \"Mormons\" in these distresses, in pursuance of the laws of      Missouri, made application to Judge King, the circuit judge of that      circuit, for protection, and for the aid of the officers of the      law to protect them. Judge King, as they have been informed, and      believe, gave an order to Major General David R. Atchison to call      out the militia to protect the \"Mormons\" against the fury of the      mob. General Atchison thereupon gave orders to Brigadiers Parks      and Doniphan. In pursuance of these orders issued as aforesaid, on      the 18th of October, 1838, General Doniphan arrived at Far West, a      \"Mormon\" village in the county of Caldwell, with a small company of      militia. After he had been at Far West two days, General Doniphan      disbanded his company, alleging to the \"Mormons,\" as his reason for      so doing, that his company had the same feelings as the mob, and      that he could not rely upon them. In a short time General Parks      arrived at Far West, and also disbanded his company. At this time      the mob was marching from Carroll to Daviess. General Doniphan,      while at Far West, directed the \"Mormons\" to raise a company to      protect themselves, telling them that one Cornelius Gilliam was      raising a mob to destroy their town, and also advising them to      place out guards to watch the motions of the mob. He also directed      them to raise a company and send them to Daviess, to aid their      brethren there against the mob which was marching down upon them      from Carroll. This the \"Mormons\" did; they mustered a company of      about sixty men, who proceeded to Diahman. When General Parks      arrived at Far West as aforesaid, and learned that General Doniphan      had disbanded his men he expressed great dissatisfaction. The same      evening on which General Parks disbanded his company as aforesaid,      he proceeded to Diahman, in order to learn what the mob were doing      there, and if possible to protect the \"Mormons.\"        When General Parks had arrived in Daviess, he found that the mob      had commenced its operations there, which was on the 20th of      October, 1838. {33} They commenced by burning the house of a man      [Don Carlos Smith] who had gone to Tennessee on business, and      left his wife at home with two small children. When the house was      burned down, the wife and two small children were left in the snow,      and she had to walk three miles before she could find a shelter,      carrying her two children all that distance, and had to wade Grand      River, which was three feet deep. The mob on the same evening      burned seven other houses, burning and destroying all the property      that they thought proper. The next morning, Colonel Lyman Wight, an      officer in the militia, inquired of General Parks, what was to be      done, as he now saw the course the mob was determined to pursue.      General Parks replied that he (Wight) should take a company of men      and give the mob battle, and that he would be responsible for the      act, saying that they could have no peace with the mob, until they      had given them a scourging.        On the next morning, in obedience to this order, David W. Patten      was despatched with one hundred men under his command to meet the      mob as they were advancing from Carroll, with directions to protect      the citizens, and collect and bring into Far West such of the      \"Mormons\" as were scattered through the county, and unprotected,      and if the mob interfered, he must fight them. The company under      the command of Patten was the same, in part, that had gone from      Far West by the order of General Doniphan to protect the citizens      of Daviess. As Patten went in the direction of the mob, they fled      before him, leaving their cannon, which Patten took possession of.      The mob dispersed. Patten with his men then returned to Daviess      county. Patten in a few days after returned to Far West. It was      now supposed that the difficulties were at an end. But contrary      to expectation, on the evening of the 23rd of October, messengers      arrived at Far West and informed the citizens that a body of armed      men had made their appearance in the south part of the county, and      that they were burning houses, destroying property, and threatening      the \"Mormon\" citizens with death, unless they left the county the      next morning by 10 o'clock, or renounced their religion.        About midnight another messenger arrived with news of the like      tenor. Patten collected about sixty men and proceeded to the scene      of the disturbance, to protect if possible the lives and property      of the \"Mormon\" citizens. On his arrival at the neighborhood where      the first disturbance had commenced, he found that the mob had      gone to another neighborhood to prosecute their acts of plunder      and outrage. He marched a short distance and unexpectedly came      upon the encampment of the mob. The guards of the mob fired upon      him and killed one of his men. Patten then charged the mob, and      after a few fires, the mob dispersed and fled, but Patten was      killed and another of his {34} men. After the fight and dispersion      of the mob, Patten's company returned to Far West. The report of      the proceedings created much excitement. The community was made      to believe that the \"Mormons\" were in rebellion against the law;      whereas the above facts show they were an injured people, standing      up in the defense of their persons and their property.        At this time the governor of the state issued an order to General      Clark to raise several thousand men and march against the      \"Mormons,\" and drive them from the state, or \"exterminate them.\"      Major-General Lucas and Brigadier-General Wilson collected three or      four thousand men; and with this formidable force, commenced their      march and arrived at Far West. In their rear marched General Clark      with another formidable force.        In the meantime the \"Mormons\" had not heard of these immense      preparations, and so far from expecting an armed force under the      orders of the state to war against them, were daily expecting a      force from the governor to protect their lives and their property      from the mob.        When this formidable array first made its appearance, intent upon      peace, the \"Mormons\" sent a white flag several miles to meet them,      to ascertain the reason why an armed force was marching against      them, and what we might expect at their hands. They gave us no      satisfaction, but continued marching towards Far West. Immediately      on their arrival, a man came bearing a white flag from their      camp. He was interrogated about his business; he answered the      interrogations, saying they wanted three persons out of Far West,      before they massacred the rest. Those persons refused to go, and      he returned back to the camp. He was closely followed by General      Doniphan and his whole brigade marching to the city of Far West      in line of battle. The citizens also of Far West formed a line of      battle in full front of Doniphan's army: upon this Doniphan ordered      a halt, and then a retreat. Night closed upon both parties without      any collision.        On the next day, towards evening, the \"Mormons\" were officially      informed that the governor of the state had sent this immense force      against them to massacre them, or drive them from the state. As      soon as the \"Mormons\" learned that this order had the sanction of      the governor of the state, they determined to make no resistance;      to submit themselves to the authorities of the state, how      tyrannical and unjust soever the exercise of that authority might      be.        The commanders of the Missouri militia before Far West sent a      messenger into the town, requesting an interview in their camp      with five of the principal citizens among the \"Mormons,\" pledging      their faith for their safe return on the following morning at eight      o'clock. Invited, as they {35} supposed, to propose and receive      terms of peace, and under the pledge of a safe conduct, Lyman      Wight, George W. Robinson, Joseph Smith, Jun., Parley P. Pratt, and      Sidney Rigdon, went towards the camp of the militia. Before they      arrived at the camp, they were surrounded by the whole army; and by      order of General Lucas put under guard, and marched to the camp,      and were told that they were prisoners of war. A court martial was      held that night, and they, without being heard, and in the absence      of all proof, were condemned to be shot next morning.        The execution of this bloody order, was prevented by the manly      protest of General Doniphan. He denounced the act as cold blooded      murder, and withdrew his brigade. This noble stand taken by General      Doniphan, prevented the murder of the prisoners. It is here worthy      of note, that seventeen preachers of the gospel were on this court      martial, and were in favor of the sentence.        The next morning the prisoners were marched under a strong guard      to Independence, in Jackson county, and after being detained there      for a week, they were marched to Richmond, where General Clark then      was with his troops. Here a court of inquiry was held before Judge      King; this continued from the 11th until the 28th of November;      while the five prisoners were kept in chains, and about"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60736"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 5 (#18)"],[1,", but rather that ye may prophesy.\" It is very      evident from these Scriptures that many of them had not spiritual      gifts, for if they had spiritual gifts where was the necessity      of Paul telling them to follow after them, and it is as evident      that they did not all receive those gifts by the imposition of the      hands; for they as a Church had been baptized and confirmed by      the laying on of hands--and yet to a Church of this kind, under      the immediate inspection and superintendency of the Apostles, it      was necessary for Paul to say, \"Follow after charity, and desire      spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy,\" evidently      showing that those gifts were in the Church, but not enjoyed by all      in their outward manifestations.        But suppose the gifts of the Spirit were immediately, upon the      imposition of hands, enjoyed by all, in all their fullness and      power; the skeptic would still be as far from receiving any      testimony except upon a mere casualty as before, for all the      gifts of the Spirit are not visible to the natural vision, or      understanding of man; indeed very few of them are. We read that      \"Christ ascended into heaven and gave gifts unto men; and He gave      some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some      Pastors and Teachers.\" (Eph. iv).        The Church is a compact body composed of different members, and is      strictly analogous to the human system, and Paul, after speaking      of the different gifts, says, \"Now ye are the body of Christ and      {29} members in particular; and God hath set some in the Church,      first Apostles, secondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers, after that      miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, governments, diversities      of tongues. Are all Teachers? Are all workers of miracles? Do all      speak with tongues? Do all interpret? It is evident that they do      not; yet are they all members of one body. All members of the      natural body are not the eye, the ear, the head or the hand--yet      the eye cannot say to the ear I have no need of thee, nor the head      to the foot, I have no need of thee; they are all so many component      parts in the perfect machine--the one body; and if one member      suffer, the whole of the members suffer with it: and if one member      rejoice, all the rest are honored with it.        These, then, are all gifts; they come from God; they are of God;      they are all the gifts of the Holy Ghost; they are what Christ      ascended into heaven to impart; and yet how few of them could be      known by the generality of men. Peter and John were Apostles, yet      the Jewish court scourged them as impostors. Paul was both an      Apostle and Prophet, yet they stoned him and put him into prison.      The people knew nothing about it, although he had in his possession      the gift of the Holy Ghost. Our Savior was \"anointed with the oil      of gladness above his fellows,\" yet so far from the people knowing      Him, they said He was Beelzebub, and crucified Him as an impostor.      Who could point out a Pastor, a Teacher, or an Evangelist by their      appearance, yet had they the gift of the Holy Ghost?        But to come to the other members of the Church, and examine the      gifts as spoken of by Paul, and we shall find that the world can      in general know nothing about them, and that there is but one      or two that could be immediately known, if they were all poured      out immediately upon the imposition of hands. In I. Cor. xii.,      Paul says, \"There are diversities of gifts yet the same spirit,      and there are differences of administrations but the same Lord;      and there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God      which worketh all in all. But the manifestations of the Spirit is      given unto every man to profit withal. For to one is given, by the      Spirit, the word of wisdom, to another, the word of knowledge by      the same Spirit; to another faith, by the same Spirit; to another      the gifts of healing, by the same Spirit; to another the working      of miracles; to another prophecy; to another the discerning of      spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the      interpretation of tongues. But all these worketh that one and the      self same spirit, dividing to each man severally as he will.\"        There are several gifts mentioned here, yet which of them all      could be known by an observer at the imposition of hands? The word      of wisdom, and the word of knowledge, are as much gifts as any      other, yet if a person possessed both of these gifts, or received      them by the imposition {30} of hands, who would know it? Another      might receive the gift of faith, and they would be as ignorant      of it. Or suppose a man had the gift of healing or power to work      miracles, that would not then be known; it would require time and      circumstances to call these gifts into operation. Suppose a man      had the discerning of spirits, who would be the wiser for it? Or      if he had the interpretation of tongues, unless someone spoke in      an unknown tongue, he of course would have to be silent; there are      only two gifts that could be made visible--the gift of tongues and      the gift of prophecy. These are things that are the most talked      about, and yet if a person spoke in an unknown tongue, according to      Paul's testimony, he would be a barbarian to those present. They      would say that it was gibberish; and if he prophesied they would      call it nonsense. The gift of tongues is the smallest gift perhaps      of the whole, and yet it is one that is the most sought after.        So that according to the testimony of Scripture and the      manifestations of the Spirit in ancient days, very little could      be known about it by the surrounding multitude, except on some      extraordinary occasion, as on the day of Pentecost.        The greatest, the best, and the most useful gifts would be known      nothing about by an observer. It is true that a man might prophesy,      which is a great gift, and one that Paul told the people--the      Church--to seek after and to covet, rather than to speak in      tongues; but what does the world know about prophesying? Paul says      that it \"serveth only to those that believe.\" But does not the      Scriptures say that they spake in tongues and prophesied? Yes; but      who is it that writes these Scriptures? Not the men of the world      or mere casual observers, but the Apostles--men who knew one gift      from another, and of course were capable of writing about it; if      we had the testimony of the Scribes and Pharisees concerning the      outpouring of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, they would have      told us that it was no gift, but that the people were \"drunken with      new wine,\" and we shall finally have to come to the same conclusion      that Paul did--\"No man knows the things of God but by the Spirit of      God;\" for with the great revelations of Paul when he was caught up      into the third heaven and saw things that were not lawful to utter,      no man was apprised of it until he mentioned it himself fourteen      years after; and when John had the curtains of heaven withdrawn,      and by vision looked through the dark vista of future ages,      and contemplated events that should transpire throughout every      subsequent period of time, until the final winding up scene--while      he gazed upon the glories of the eternal world, saw an innumerable      company of angels and heard the voice of God--it was in the Spirit,      on the Lord's day, unnoticed and unobserved by the world.        The manifestations of the gift of the Holy Ghost, the ministering      of {31} angels, or the development of the power, majesty or glory      of God were very seldom manifested publicly, and that generally      to the people of God, as to the Israelites; but most generally      when angels have come, or God has revealed Himself, it has been      to individuals in private, in their chamber; in the wilderness      or fields, and that generally without noise or tumult. The angel      delivered Peter out of prison in the dead of night; came to Paul      unobserved by the rest of the crew; appeared to Mary and Elizabeth      without the knowledge of others; spoke to John the Baptist whilst      the people around were ignorant of it.        When Elisha saw the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof,      it was unknown to others. When the Lord appeared to Abraham it was      at his tent door; when the angels went to Lot, no person knew them      but himself, which was the case probably with Abraham and his wife;      when the Lord appeared to Moses, it was in the burning bush, in      the tabernacle, or in the mountain top; when Elijah was taken in a      chariot of fire, it was unobserved by the world; and when he was in      a cleft of a rock, there was loud thunder, but the Lord was not in      the thunder; there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the      earthquake; and then there was a still small voice, which was the      voice of the Lord, saying, \"What doest thou hear, Elijah?\"        The Lord cannot always be known by the thunder of His voice, by      the display of His glory or by the manifestation of His power; and      those that are the most anxious to see these things, are the least      prepared to meet them, and were the Lord to manifest His power as      He did to the children of Israel, such characters would be the      first to say, \"Let not the Lord speak any more, lest we His people      die.\"        We would say to the brethren, seek to know God in your closets,      call upon him in the fields. Follow the directions of the Book of      Mormon, and pray over, and for your families, your cattle, your      flocks, your herds, your corn, and all things that you"]]]
