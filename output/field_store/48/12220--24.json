Thus it was that before Dicky had arranged what he should do, though  plans were fusing in his brain, he said to Mahommed Yeleb seriously,  as befitting the crime Sowerby had committed--evenly, as befitted the  influence he wished to have over the Arab: \"Keep your tongue between  your teeth, Mahommed. We will pull him through all right.\"    \"But, effendi, whom God honour, for greatness is in all thy ways, friend  of the Commander of the Faithful as thou art--but, saadat el basha, if  he be dead?\"    \"He is not dead. I know it by the eyes of my mind, Mahommed--yea, by the  hairs of my head, he is not dead!\"    \"Saadat el basha, thou art known as the truth-teller and the  incorruptible--this is the word of the Egyptian and of the infidel  concerning thee. I kiss thy feet. For it is true he hath deserved death,  but woe be to him by whom his death cometh! And am I not his servant to  be with him while he hath life, and hath need of me? If thou sayest he  is alive, then is he alive, and my heart rejoices.\"    Dicky scarcely heard what the Arab said, for the quick conviction he had  had that Sowerby was alive was based on the fact, suddenly remembered,  that Selamlik Pasha had only returned from the Fayoum this very morning,  and that therefore he could not as yet have had any share in the fate of  Sowerby, but had probably been sent for by the Chief Eunuch. It was but  an hour since that he had seen Selamlik Pasha driving hastily towards  his palace.    His mind was instantly made up, his plans formed to his purpose.    \"Listen, Mahommed,\" he said to the Arab. \"Listen to each word I say,  as though it were the prayer to take thee into Paradise. Go at once to  Selamlik Pasha. Carry this ring the Khedive gave to me--he will know it.  Do not be denied his presence. Say that it is more than life and death;  that it is all he values in the world. Once admitted, say these words:  'Donovan Pasha knows all, and asks an audience at midnight in this  palace. Until that hour Donovan Pasha desires peace. For is it not the  law, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth? Is not a market a place  to buy and sell?'\"    Four times did Dicky make the Arab repeat the words after him, till they  ran like water from his tongue, and dismissed him upon the secret errand  with a handful of silver.    Immediately the Arab had gone, Dicky's face flushed with excitement,  in the reaction from his lately assumed composure. For five minutes he  walked up and down, using language scarcely printable, reviling Sowerby,  and setting his teeth in anger. But he suddenly composed himself,  and, sitting down, stared straight before him for a long time without  stirring a muscle. There was urgent need of action, but there was  more urgent need of his making no mistake, of his doing the one thing  necessary, for Sowerby could only be saved in one way, not many.    It was useless to ask the Khedive's intervention--Ismail dared not  go against Selamlik in this. Whatever was done must be done between  Selamlik Pasha, the tigerish libertine, and Richard Donovan, the little  man who, at the tail end of Ismail's reign, was helping him hold things  together against the black day of reckoning, \"prepared for the devil  and all his angels,\" as Dicky had said to Ismail on this very momentous  morning, when warning him of the perils in his path. Now Dicky had been  at war with Selamlik ever since, one day long ago on the Nile, he and  Fielding had thwarted his purposes; and Dicky had earned the Pasha's  changeless hatred by calling him \"Trousers\"--for this name had gone  up and down throughout Egypt as a doubtful story travels, drawing easy  credit everywhere. Those were the days when Dicky was irresponsible. Of  all in Egypt who hated him most, Selamlik Pasha was the chief. But most  people hated Selamlik, so the world was not confounded by the great  man's rage, nor did they dislike Dicky simply because the Pasha chose  to do so. Through years Selamlik had built up his power, until even the  Khedive feared him, and would have been glad to tie a stone round his  neck and drop him into the Nile. But Ismail could no longer do this sort  of thing without some show of reason--Europe was hanging on his actions,  waiting for the apt moment to depose him.    All this Dicky knew, and five minutes from the time Mahommed Yeleb had  left him he was on his way to Ismail's palace, with his kavass behind  him, cool and ruminating as usual, now answering a salute in Turkish  fashion, now in English, as Egyptians or Europeans passed him.      II    There was one being in the Khedive's palace whose admiration for Dicky  was a kind of fetish, and Dicky loathed him. Twice had Dicky saved  this Chief Eunuch's life from Ismail's anger, and once had he saved  his fortune--not even from compassion, but out of his inherent love of  justice. As Dicky had said: \"Let him die--for what he has done, not for  something he has not done. Send him to the devil with a true bill  of crime.\" So it was that Dicky, who shrank from the creature whom  Ministers and Pashas fawned upon--so powerful was his unique position  in the palace--went straight to him now to get his quid-pro-quo, his  measure for measure.    The tall, black-coated, smooth-faced creature, silent and watchful and  lean, stepped through the doorway with the footfall of a cat. He slid  forward, salaamed to the floor-Dicky wondered how a body could open and  shut so like the blade of a knife--and, catching Dicky's hand, kissed  it.    \"May thy days be watered with the dew of heaven, saadat el basha,\" said  the Chief Eunuch.    \"Mine eyes have not seen since thy last withdrawal,\" answered Dicky  blandly, in the high-flown Oriental way.    \"Thou hast sent for me. I am thy slave.\"    \"I have sent for thee, Mizraim. And thou shalt prove thyself, once for  all, whether thy hand moves as thy tongue speaks.\"    \"To serve thee I will lay down my life--I will blow it from me as the  wind bloweth the cotton flower. Have I not spoken thus since the Feast  of Beiram, now two years gone?\"    Dicky lowered his voice. \"Both Mustapha Bey, that son of the he-wolf  Selamlik Pasha, still follow the carriage of the Khedive's favourite,  and hang about the walls, and seek to corrupt thee with gold, Mahommed  Mizraim?\"    \"Saadat el basha, but for thy word to wait, the Khedive had been told  long since.\"    \"It is the sport to strike when the sword cuts with the longest arm, O  son of Egypt!\"    The face of Mizraim was ugly with the unnatural cruelty of an unnatural  man. \"Is the time at hand, saadat el basha?\"    \"You hate Selamlik Pasha?\"    \"As the lion the jackal.\"    Dicky would have laughed in scorn if he might have dared--this being to  class himself with lions! But the time was not fit for laughter. \"And  the son of Selamlik Pasha, the vile Mustapha Bey?\" he asked.    \"I would grind him like corn between the stones! Hath he not sent  messages by the women of the bazaar to the harem of my royal master, to  whom God give glory in heaven? Hath he not sought to enter the harem as  a weasel crawls under a wall? Hath he not sought to steal what I hoard  by a mighty hand and the eye of an eagle for Ismail the Great? Shall  I love him more than the dog that tears the throat of a gazelle?\" The  gesture of cruelty he made was disgusting to the eyes of Dicky Donovan,  but he had in his mind the peril to Sowerby, and he nodded his head in  careless approval, as it were.    \"Then, Mizraim, thou son of secrecy and keeper of the door, take heed  to what I say, and for thine honour and my need do as I will. Thou shalt  to-night admit Mustapha Bey to the harem--at the hour of nine o'clock!\"    \"Saadat el basha!\" The eunuch's face was sickly in its terrified wonder.    \"Even so. At nine.\"    \"But, saadat--\"    \"Bring him secretly, even to the door of the favourite's room; then,  have him seized and carried to a safe place till I send for him.\"    \"Ah, saadat el basha--\" The lean face of the creature smiled, and the  smile was not nice to see.    \"Let no harm be done him, but await my messenger, Mahommed Yeleb, and  whatsoever he bids you to do, do it; for I speak.\"    \"Ah, saadat el basha, you would strike Selamlik Pasha so--the great  beast, the black river pig, the serpent of the slime...!\"    \"You will do this thing, Mizraim?\"    \"I shall lure him, as the mirage the pilgrim. With joy I will do this,  and a hundred times more.\"    \"Even if I asked of thee the keys of the harem?\" asked Dicky grimly.    \"Effendi, thou wouldst not ask. All the world knows thee. For thee the  harem hath no lure. Thou goest not by dark ways to deeds for thine own  self. Thou hast honour. Ismail himself would not fear thee.\"    \"See, thou master of many, squeak not thy voice so high. Ismail will  take thy head and mine, if he discovers to-night's business. Go then  with a soft tread, Mizraim. Let thy hand be quick on his mouth, and  beware that no one sees!\"      III    Upon the stroke of midnight Dicky entered the room where Selamlik Pasha  awaited him with a malicious and greasy smile, in which wanton cruelty  was uppermost. Selamlik Pasha knew well the object of this meeting. He  had accurately interpreted the message brought by Mahommed Yeleb. He  knew his power; he knew that the Englishman's life was in his hands to  do with what he chose, for the law of the harem which defies all outside  law was on his side. But here he was come to listen to Dicky Donovan,  the arrogant little favourite, pleading for the life of the English boy  who had done the thing for which the only penalty was death.    Dicky showed no emotion as he entered the room, but salaamed, and said:  \"Your Excellency is prompt. Honour and peace be upon your Excellency!\"  \"Honour and the bounty of the stars be upon thee, saadat el basha!\"    There was a slight pause, in which Dicky seated himself, lighted a  cigarette, and summoned a servant, of whom he ordered coffee. They did  not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6267"],[0,"The Weavers: a tale of England and Egypt of fifty years ago - Complete (#18)"],[1,"been sitting.    The question was unnecessary, and she knew it was so; but she could  not bear the strain of the silence. She seemed to have risen out of the  letter he had been writing; and had he not been writing of her--of what  concerned them both? How mean and small-hearted he had been, to have  thought for an instant that she had not the highest courage, though in  going she had done the discreeter, safer thing. But she had come--she  had come!    All this was in his eyes, though his face was pale and still. He  was almost rigid with emotion, for the ancient habit of repose and  self-command of the Quaker people was upon him.    \"Can you not see--do you not know?\" she repeated, her back upon him now,  her face still veiled, her hands making a swift motion of distress.    \"Has thee found in the past that thee is so soon forgotten?\"    \"Oh, do not blame me!\" She raised her veil suddenly, and showed a face  as pale as his own, and in the eyes a fiery brightness. \"I did not know.  It was so hard to come--do not blame me. I went to Alexandria--I felt  that I must fly; the air around me seemed full of voices crying out. Did  you not understand why I went?\"    \"I understand,\" he said, coming forward slowly. \"Thee should not have  returned. In the way I go now the watchers go also.\"    \"If I had not come, you would never have understood,\" she answered  quickly. \"I am not sorry I went. I was so frightened, so shaken. My only  thought was to get away from the terrible Thing. But I should have been  sorry all my life long had I not come back to tell you what I feel, and  that I shall never forget. All my life I shall be grateful. You have  saved me from a thousand deaths. Ah, if I could give you but one life!  Yet--yet--oh, do not think but that I would tell you the whole truth,  though I am not wholly truthful. See, I love my place in the world more  than I love my life; and but for you I should have lost all.\"    He made a protesting motion. \"The debt is mine, in truth. But for you I  should never have known what, perhaps--\" He paused.    His eyes were on hers, gravely speaking what his tongue faltered to say.  She looked and looked, but did not understand. She only saw troubled  depths, lighted by a soul of kindling purpose. \"Tell me,\" she said,  awed.    \"Through you I have come to know--\" He paused again. What he was going  to say, truthful though it was, must hurt her, and she had been sorely  hurt already. He put his thoughts more gently, more vaguely.    \"By what happened I have come to see what matters in life. I was behind  the hedge. I have broken through upon the road. I know my goal now. The  highway is before me.\"    She felt the tragedy in his words, and her voice shook as she spoke. \"I  wish I knew life better. Then I could make a better answer. You are on  the road, you say. But I feel that it is a hard and cruel road--oh, I  understand that at least! Tell me, please, tell me the whole truth. You  are hiding from me what you feel. I have upset your life, have I not?  You are a Quaker, and Quakers are better than all other Christian  people, are they not? Their faith is peace, and for me, you--\" She  covered her face with her hands for an instant, but turned quickly and  looked him in the eyes: \"For me you put your hand upon the clock of a  man's life, and stopped it.\"    She got to her feet with a passionate gesture, but he put a hand gently  upon her arm, and she sank back again. \"Oh, it was not you; it was I who  did it!\" she said. \"You did what any man of honour would have done, what  a brother would have done.\"    \"What I did is a matter for myself only,\" he responded quickly. \"Had  I never seen your face again it would have been the same. You were the  occasion; the thing I did had only one source, my own heart and mind.  There might have been another way; but for that way, or for the way I  did take, you could not be responsible.\"    \"How generous you are!\" Her eyes swam with tears; she leaned over the  table where he had been writing, and the tears dropped upon his letter.  Presently she realised this, and drew back, then made as though to dry  the tears from the paper with her handkerchief. As she did so the words  that he had written met her eye: \"'But offences must come, and woe to  him from whom the offence cometh!' I have begun now, and only now, to  feel the storms that shake us to our farthest cells of life.\"    She became very still. He touched her arm and said heavily: \"Come away,  come away.\"    She pointed to the words she had read. \"I could not help but see, and  now I know what this must mean to you.\"    \"Thee must go at once,\" he urged. \"Thee should not have come. Thee was  safe--none knew. A few hours and it would all have been far behind. We  might never have met again.\"    Suddenly she gave a low, hysterical laugh. \"You think you hide the real  thing from me. I know I'm ignorant and selfish and feeble-minded, but I  can see farther than you think. You want to tell the truth about--about  it, because you are honest and hate hiding things, because you want to  be punished, and so pay the price. Oh, I can understand! If it were not  for me you would not....\" With a sudden wild impulse she got to her  feet. \"And you shall not,\" she cried. \"I will not have it.\" Colour came  rushing to her cheeks.    \"I will not have it. I will not put myself so much in your debt. I will  not demand so much of you. I will face it all. I will stand alone.\"    There was a touch of indignation in her voice. Somehow she seemed moved  to anger against him. Her hands were clasped at her side rigidly, her  pulses throbbing. He stood looking at her fixedly, as though trying  to realise her. His silence agitated her still further, and she spoke  excitedly:    \"I could have, would have, killed him myself without a moment's regret.  He had planned, planned--ah, God, can you not see it all! I would  have taken his life without a thought. I was mad to go upon such an  adventure, but I meant no ill. I had not one thought that I could not  have cried out from the housetops, and he had in his heart--he had what  you saw. But you repent that you killed him--by accident, it was by  accident. Do you realise how many times others have been trapped by him  as was I? Do you not see what he was--as I see now? Did he not say as  much to me before you came, when I was dumb with terror? Did he not make  me understand what his whole life had been? Did I not see in a flash  the women whose lives he had spoiled and killed? Would I have had pity?  Would I have had remorse? No, no, no! I was frightened when it was done,  I was horrified, but I was not sorry; and I am not sorry. It was to be.  It was the true end to his vileness. Ah!\"    She shuddered, and buried her face in her hands for a moment, then went  on: \"I can never forgive myself for going to the Palace with him. I was  mad for experience, for mystery; I wanted more than the ordinary share  of knowledge. I wanted to probe things. Yet I meant no wrong. I thought  then nothing of which I shall ever be ashamed. But I shall always be  ashamed because I knew him, because he thought that I--oh, if I were a  man, I should be glad that I had killed him, for the sake of all honest  women!\"    He remained silent. His look was not upon her, he seemed lost in a  dream; but his face was fixed in trouble.    She misunderstood his silence. \"You had the courage, the impulse to--to  do it,\" she said keenly; \"you have not the courage to justify it. I will  not have it so.    \"I will tell the truth to all the world. I will not shrink I shrank  yesterday because I was afraid of the world; to-day I will face it, I  will--\"    She stopped suddenly, and another look flashed into her face. Presently  she spoke in a different tone; a new light had come upon her mind. \"But  I see,\" she added. \"To tell all is to make you the victim, too, of what  he did. It is in your hands; it is all in your hands; and I cannot speak  unless--unless you are ready also.\"    There was an unintended touch of scorn in her voice. She had been  troubled and tried beyond bearing, and her impulsive nature revolted  at his silence. She misunderstood him, or, if she did not wholly  misunderstand him, she was angry at what she thought was a needless  remorse or sensitiveness. Did not the man deserve his end?    \"There is only one course to pursue,\" he rejoined quietly, \"and that is  the course we entered upon last night. I neither doubted yourself nor  your courage. Thee must not turn back now. Thee must not alter the  course which was your own making, and the only course which thee could,  or I should, take. I have planned my life according to the word I gave  you. I could not turn back now. We are strangers, and we must remain so.  Thee will go from here now, and we must not meet again. I am--\"    \"I know who you are,\" she broke in. \"I know what your religion is; that  fighting and war and bloodshed is a sin to you.\"    \"I am of no family or place in England,\" he went on calmly. \"I come of  yeoman and trading stock; I have nothing in common with people of rank.  Our lines of life will not cross. It is well that it should be so. As  to what happened--that which I may feel has nothing to do with whether I  was justified or no. But if thee has thought that I have repented doing  what I did, let that pass for ever from your mind. I know that I should  do the same, yes, even a hundred times. I did according to my nature.  Thee must not now be punished cruelly for a thing thee did not do.  Silence is the only way of safety or of justice. We must not speak of  this again. We must each go our own way.\"    Her eyes were moist. She reached out a hand to him timidly. \"Oh, forgive  me,\" she added brokenly, \"I am so vain, so selfish, and that makes one  blind to the truth. It is all clearer now. You have shown me that I was  right in my first impulse, and that is all I can say for myself. I shall  pray all my life that it"]]]
