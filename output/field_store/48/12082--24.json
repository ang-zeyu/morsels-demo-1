[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4028"],[0,"The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini (#18)"],[1,"of my artillery practice, which I never intermitted  through the whole month passed by us beleaguered in the castle, I met  with a great many very striking accidents, all of them worthy to be  related. But since I do not care to be too prolix, or to exhibit myself  outside the sphere of my profession, I will omit the larger part of  them, only touching upon those I cannot well neglect, which shall be the  fewest in number and the most remarkable. The first which comes to hand  is this: Messer Antonio Santacroce had made me come down from the Angel,  in order to fire on some houses in the neighbourhood, where certain of  our besiegers had been seen to enter. While I was firing, a cannon shot  reached me, which hit the angle of a battlement, and carried off enough  of it to be the cause why I sustained no injury. The whole mass struck  me in the chest and took my breath away. I lay stretched upon the ground  like a dead man, and could hear what the bystanders were saying. Among  them all, Messer Antonio Santacroce lamented greatly, exclaiming: Alas,  alas! we have lost the best defender that we had. Attracted by the  uproar, one of my comrades ran up; he was called Gianfrancesco, and was  a bandsman, but was far more naturally given to medicine than to music.  On the spot he flew off, crying for a stoop of the very best Greek wine.  Then he made a tile red-hot, and cast upon it a good handful of  wormwood; after which he sprinkled the Greek wine; and when the wormwood  was well soaked, he laid it on my breast, just where the bruise was  visible to all. Such was the virtue of the wormwood that I immediately  regained my scattered faculties. I wanted to begin to speak; but could  not; for some stupid soldiers had filled my mouth with earth, imagining  that by so doing they were giving me the sacrament; and indeed they were  more like to have excommunicated me, since I could with difficulty come  to myself again, the earth doing me more mischief than the blow.  However, I escaped that danger, and returned to the rage and fury of the  guns, pursuing my work there with all the ability and eagerness that I  could summon.    Pope Clement, by this, had sent to demand assistance from the Duke of  Urbino, who was with the troops of Venice; he commissioned the envoy to  tell his Excellency that the Castle of S. Angelo would send up every  evening three beacons from its summit accompanied by three discharges of  the cannon thrice repeated, and that so long as this signal was  continued, he might take for granted that the castle had not yielded. I  was charged with lighting the beacons and firing the guns for this  purpose; and all this while I pointed my artillery by day upon the  places where mischief could be done. The Pope, in consequence, began to  regard me with still greater favour, because he saw that I discharged my  functions as intelligently as the task demanded. Aid from the Duke of  Urbino [1] never came; on which, as it is not my business, I will make  no further comment.    Note 1. Francesco Maria della Rovere, Duke of Urbino, commanded a  considerable army as general of the Church, and was now acting for  Venice. Why he effected no diversion while the Imperial troops were  marching upon Rome, and why he delayed to relieve the city, was never  properly explained. Folk attributed his impotent conduct partly to a  natural sluggishness in warfare, and partly to his hatred for the house  of Medici. Leo X had deprived him of his dukedom, and given it to a  Medicean prince. It is to this that Cellini probably refers in the  cautious phrase which ends the chapter.    XXXVI    WHILE I was at work upon that diabolical task of mine, there came from  time to time to watch me some of the cardinals who were invested in the  castle; and most frequently the Cardinal of Ravenna and the Cardinal de  Gaddi. [1] I often told them not to show themselves, since their nasty  red caps gave a fair mark to our enemies. From neighbouring buildings,  such as the Torre de Bini, we ran great peril when they were there; and  at last I had them locked off, and gained thereby their deep ill-will. I  frequently received visits also from the general, Orazio Baglioni, who  was very well affected toward me. One day while he was talking with me,  he noticed something going forward in a drinking-place outside the Porta  di Castello, which bore the name of Baccanello. This tavern had for sign  a sun painted between two windows, of a bright red colour. The windows  being closed, Signor Orazio concluded that a band of soldiers were  carousing at table just between them and behind the sun. So he said to  me Benvenuto, if you think that you could hit that wall an ells  breadth from the sun with your demi-cannon here, I believe you would be  doing a good stroke of business, for there is a great commotion there,  and men of much importance must probably be inside the house. I  answered that I felt quite capable of hitting the sun in its centre, but  that a barrel full of stones, which was standing close to the muzzle of  the gun, might be knocked down by the shock of the discharge and the  blast of the artillery. He rejoined: Dont waste time, Benvenuto. In  the first place, it is not possible, where it is standing, that the  cannons blast should bring it down; and even if it were to fall, and  the Pope himself was underneath, the mischief would not be so great as  you imagine. Fire, then, only fire! Taking no more thought about it, I  struck the sun in the centre, exactly as I said I should. The cask was  dislodged, as I predicted, and fell precisely between Cardinal Farnese  and Messer Jacopo Salviati. [2] It might very well have dashed out the  brains of both of them, except that just at that very moment Farnese was  reproaching Salviati with having caused the sack of Rome, and while they  stood apart from one another to exchange opprobrious remarks, my gabion  fell without destroying them. When he heard the uproar in the court  below, good Signor Orazio dashed off in a hurry; and I, thrusting my  neck forward where the cask had fallen, heard some people saying; It  would not be a bad job to kill that gunner! Upon this I turned two  falconets toward the staircase, with mind resolved to let blaze on the  first man who attempted to come up. The household of Cardinal Farnese  must have received orders to go and do me some injury; accordingly I  prepared to receive them, with a lighted match in hand. Recognising some  who were approaching, I called out: You lazy lubbers, if you dont pack  off from there, and if but a mans child among you dares to touch the  staircase, I have got two cannon loaded, which will blow you into  powder. Go and tell the Cardinal that I was acting at the order of  superior officers, and that what we have done and are doing is in  defence of them priests, [3] and not to hurt them. They made away; and  then came Signor Orazio Baglioni, running. I bade him stand back, else  Id murder him; for I knew very well who he was. He drew back a little,  not without a certain show of fear, and called out: Benvenuto, I am  your friend! To this I answered: Sir, come up, but come alone, and  then come as you like. The general, who was a man of mighty pride,  stood still a moment, and then said angrily: I have a good mind not to  come up again, and to do quite the opposite of that which I intended  toward you. I replied that just as I was put there to defend my  neighbours, I was equally well able to defend myself too. He said that  he was coming alone; and when he arrived at the top of the stairs, his  features were more discomposed that I thought reasonable. So I kept my  hand upon my sword, and stood eyeing him askance. Upon this he began to  laugh, and the colour coming back into his face, he said to me with the  most pleasant manner: Friend Benvenuto, I bear you as great love as I  have it in my heart to give; and in Gods good time I will render you  proof of this. Would to God that you had killed those two rascals; for  one of them is the cause of all this trouble, and the day perchance will  come when the other will be found the cause of something even worse. He  then begged me, if I should be asked, not to say that he was with me  when I fired the gun; and for the rest bade me be of good cheer. The  commotion which the affair made was enormous, and lasted a long while.  However, I will not enlarge upon it further, only adding that I was  within an inch of revenging my father on Messer Jacopo Salviati, who had  grievously injured him, according to my fathers complaints. As it was,  unwittingly I gave the fellow a great fright. Of Farnese I shall say  nothing here, because it will appear in its proper place how well it  would have been if I had killed him.    Note 1. Benedetto Accolti of Arezzo, Archbishop of Ravenna in 1524,  obtained the hat in 1527, three days before the sack of Rome. He was a  distinguished man of letters. Niccolò Gaddi was created Cardinal on the  same day as Accolti. We shall hear more of him in Cellinis pages.    Note 2. Alessandro Farnese, Dean of the Sacred College, and afterwards  Pope Paul III. Of Giacopo Salviati we have already heard, p. 14.    Note 3. 'Loro preti.' Perhaps 'their priests.'    XXXVII    I PURSUED my business of artilleryman, and every day performed some  extraordinary feat, whereby the credit and the favour I acquired with  the Pope was something indescribable. There never passed a day but what  I killed one or another of our enemies in the besieging army. On one  occasion the Pope was walking round the circular keep, [1] when he  observed a Spanish Colonel in the Prati; he recognised the man by  certain indications, seeing that this officer had formerly been in his  service; and while he fixed his eyes on him, he kept talking about him.  I, above by the Angel, knew nothing of all this, but spied a fellow down  there, busying himself about the trenches with a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4035"],[0,"Greek Studies: a Series of Essays (#18)"],[1,"philosophy of perpetual change, which forces him, in his theory of  morals and the state, of poetry and music, of dress and manners even,  and of style in the very vessels and furniture of daily life, on an  austere simplicity, the older Dorian or Egyptian type of a rigid,  eternal immobility.  The disintegrating, centrifugal influence, which  had penetrated, as he thought, political and social existence, making  men too myriad-minded, had laid hold on the life of the gods also,  and, even in their calm sphere, one could hardly identify a single  divine person as himself, and not another.  There must, then, be no  doubling, no disguises, no stories of transformation.  The modern  reader, however, will hardly acquiesce in this \"improvement\" of Greek  mythology.  He finds in these stories, like that, for instance, of  the appearance of Athene to Telemachus, in the first book of the  Odyssey, which has a quite biblical mysticity and solemnity,--stories  in which, the hard material outline breaking up, the gods lay aside  their visible form like a garment, yet remain essentially  themselves,--not the least spiritual element of Greek religion, an  evidence of the sense therein of unseen presences, which might at any  moment cross a man's path, to be recognised, in half disguise, by the  more delicately trained eye, here or there, by one and not by [120]  another.  Whatever religious elements they lacked, they had at least  this sense of subtler and more remote ways of personal presence.    And as there are traces in the Homeric hymn of the primitive cosmical  myth, relics of the first stage of the development of the story, so  also many of its incidents are probably suggested by the  circumstances and details of the Eleusinian ritual.  There were  religious usages before there were distinct religious conceptions,  and these antecedent religious usages shape and determine, at many  points, the ultimate religious conception, as the details of the myth  interpret or explain the religious custom.  The hymn relates the  legend of certain holy places, to which various impressive religious  rites had attached themselves--the holy well, the old fountain, the  stone of sorrow, which it was the office of the \"interpreter\" of the  holy places to show to the people.  The sacred way which led from  Athens to Eleusis was rich in such memorials.  The nine days of the  wanderings of Demeter in the Homeric hymn are the nine days of the  duration of the greater or autumnal mysteries; the jesting of the old  woman Iambe, who endeavours to make Demeter smile, are the customary  mockeries with which the worshippers, as they rested on the bridge,  on the seventh day of the feast, assailed those who passed by.  The  torches in the hands of Demeter are borrowed from the same source;  and the shadow in which she is [121] constantly represented, and  which is the peculiar sign of her grief, is partly ritual, and a  relic of the caves of the old Chthonian worship, partly poetical--  expressive, half of the dark earth to which she escapes from Olympus,  half of her mourning.  She appears consistently, in the hymn, as a  teacher of rites, transforming daily life, and the processes of life,  into a religious solemnity.  With no misgiving as to the proprieties  of a mere narration, the hymn-writer mingles these symbolical  imitations with the outlines of the original story; and, in his  Demeter, the dramatic person of the mysteries mixes itself with the  primitive mythical figure.  And the worshipper, far from being  offended by these interpolations, may have found a special  impressiveness in them, as they linked continuously its inner sense  with the outward imagery of the ritual.    And, as Demeter and her story embodied themselves gradually in the  Greek imagination, so these mysteries in which her worship found its  chief expression, grew up little by little, growing always in close  connexion with the modifications of the story, sometimes prompting  them, at other times suggested by them.  That they had a single  special author is improbable, and a mere invention of the Greeks,  ignorant of their real history and the general analogy of such  matters.  Here again, as in the story itself, the idea of  development, of degrees, of a slow [122] and natural growth, impeded  here, diverted there, is the illuminating thought which earlier  critics lacked.  \"No tongue may speak of them,\" says the Homeric  hymn; and the secret has certainly been kept.  The antiquarian,  dealing, letter by letter, with what is recorded of them, has left  few certain data for the reflexion of the modern student of the Greek  religion; and of this, its central solemnity, only a fragmentary  picture can be made.  It is probable that these mysteries developed  the symbolical significance of the story of the descent into Hades,  the coming of Demeter to Eleusis, the invention of Persephone.  They  may or may not have been the vehicle of a secret doctrine, but were  certainly an artistic spectacle, giving, like the mysteries of the  middle age, a dramatic representation of the sacred story,--perhaps a  detailed performance, perhaps only such a conventional  representation, as was afforded for instance by the medieval  ceremonies of Palm Sunday; the whole, probably, centering in an image  of Demeter--the work of Praxiteles or his school, in ivory and gold.  There is no reason to suppose any specific difference between the  observances of the Eleusinian festival and the accustomed usages of  the Greek religion; nocturns, libations, quaint purifications,  processions--are common incidents of all Greek worship; in all  religious ceremonies there is an element of dramatic symbolism; and  what we really do see, through those scattered notices, [123] are  things which have their parallels in a later age, the whole being not  altogether unlike a modern pilgrimage.  The exposition of the sacred  places--the threshing-floor of Triptolemus, the rocky seat on which  Demeter had rested in her sorrow, the well of Callichorus--is not so  strange, as it would seem, had it no modern illustration.  The  libations, at once a watering of the vines and a drink-offering to  the dead--still needing men's services, waiting for purification  perhaps, or thirsting, like Dante's Adam of Brescia, in their close  homes--must, to almost all minds, have had a certain natural  impressiveness; and a parallel has sometimes been drawn between this  festival and All Souls' Day.    And who, everywhere, has not felt the mystical influence of that  prolonged silence, the mystic silence, from which the very word  \"mystery\" has its origin?  Something also there undoubtedly was,  which coarser minds might misunderstand.  On one day, the initiated  went in procession to the sea-coast, where they underwent a  purification by bathing in the sea.  On the fifth night there was the  torchlight procession; and, by a touch of real life in him, we gather  from the first page of Plato's Republic that such processions were  popular spectacles, having a social interest, so that people made  much of attending them.  There was the procession of the sacred  basket filled with poppy-seeds and pomegranates.  There was the day  of rest, after [124] the stress and excitement of the \"great night.\"  On the sixth day, the image of Iacchus, son of Demeter, crowned with  myrtle and having a torch in its hand, was carried in procession,  through thousands of spectators, along the sacred way, amid joyous  shouts and songs.  We have seen such processions; we understand how  many different senses, and how lightly, various spectators may put on  them; how little definite meaning they may have even for those who  officiate in them.  Here, at least, there was the image itself, in  that age, with its close connexion between religion and art,  presumably fair.  Susceptibility to the impressions of religious  ceremonial must always have varied with the peculiarities of  individual temperament, as it varies in our own day; and Eleusis,  with its incense and sweet singing, may have been as little  interesting to the outward senses of some worshippers there, as the  stately and affecting ceremonies of the medieval church to many of  its own members.  In a simpler yet profounder sense than has  sometimes been supposed, these things were really addressed to the  initiated only.*    We have to travel a long way from the Homeric hymn to the hymn of  Callimachus, who writes in the end of Greek literature, in the third  century before Christ, in celebration of the procession of the sacred  basket of Demeter, not [125] at the Attic, but at the Alexandrian  Eleusinia.  He developes, in something of the prosaic spirit of a  medieval writer of \"mysteries,\" one of the burlesque incidents of the  story, the insatiable hunger which seized on Erysichthon because he  cut down a grove sacred to the goddess.  Yet he finds his  opportunities for skilful touches of poetry;--\"As the four white  horses draw her sacred basket,\" he says, \"so will the great goddess  bring us a white spring, a white summer.\"  He describes the grove  itself, with its hedge of trees, so thick that an arrow could hardly  pass through, its pines and fruit-trees and tall poplars within, and  the water, like pale gold, running from the conduits.  It is one of  those famous poplars that receives the first stroke; it sounds  heavily to its companion trees, and Demeter perceives that her sacred  grove is suffering.  Then comes one of those transformations which  Plato will not allow.  Vainly anxious to save the lad from his ruin,  she appears in the form of a priestess, but with the long hood of the  goddess, and the poppy in her hand; and there is something of a real  shudder, some still surviving sense of a haunting presence in the  groves, in the verses which describe her sudden revelation, when the  workmen flee away, leaving their axes in the cleft trees.    Of the same age as the"]]]
