I am forgiven,\" and he held out his hand.    Stella had crossed her hands behind her as he entered with an  instinctive desire to hide her bare arms and the flour, now she put out  her hand a few inches and held it up with a smile.    \"I can't,\" she said.    He looked at the white hand--at the white arm so beautifully molded  that a sculptor would have sighed over it in despair at his inability  to imitate it, and he still held out his hand.    \"I do not mind the flour,\" he said, not as Mr. Adelstone would have  said it, but simply, naturally.    Stella gave him one small taper finger and he took it and held it for a  moment, his eyes smiling into hers; then he relinquished it, with not  a word of commonplace compliment, but in silence, and turned to Mr.  Etheridge.    \"It is quite hopeless to ask you to forgive me for interrupting you  I know, so I won't ask,\" he said, and there was in his voice, Stella  noticed, a frank candor that was almost boyish but full of respect. At  once it seemed to intimate that he had known and honored the old man  since he, Leycester, was a boy.    \"How are you, my lord?\" said Mr. Etheridge, giving him his long, thin  hand, but still keeping a hold, as it were, on his beloved easel.  \"Taking the dogs for a walk? Are they safe? Take care, Stella!\"    For Stella was kneeling down in the midst of them, making friends with  the huge mastiff, much to the jealous disgust of the others, who were  literally crowding and pushing round her.    Lord Leycester looked round and was silent for a moment; his eyes fixed  on the kneeling girl rather than on the dogs. Then he said, suddenly:    \"They are quite safe,\" and then he added, for Stella's behalf, \"they  are quite safe, Miss Etheridge.\"    Stella turned her face toward him.    \"I am not afraid. I should as soon think of biting them as they would  dream of biting me, wouldn't you?\" and she drew the mastiffs great  head on to her lap, where it lay with his big eyes looking up at her  piteously, as he licked her hand.    \"Great Heavens, what a herd of them!\" said Mr. Etheridge, who loved  dogs--on canvas.    \"I ought not to have brought them,\" said Lord Leycester, \"but they will  be quite quiet, and will do no harm, I assure you.\"    \"I don't care if they don't bite my niece,\" said Mr. Etheridge.    \"There is no fear of that,\" he said, quietly, \"or I should not allow  her to go near them. Please go on with your work, or I shall think I am  a nuisance.\"    Mr. Etheridge waved him to a chair.    \"Won't you sit down?\" he said.    Lord Leycester shook his head.    \"I have come to ask you a favor,\" he said.    Mr. Etheridge nodded.    \"What is it?\"    Lord Leycester laughed his rare laugh.    \"I am trembling in my shoes,\" he said. \"My tongue cleaves to my mouth  with nervousness----\"    The old painter glanced round at him, and his face relaxed into a smile  as his eyes rested on the bold, handsome face and easy grace of the  speaker.    \"Yes, you look excessively frightened,\" he said. \"What is it?\"    It was noticeable that, excepting in his first greeting, the old man  had not given him the benefit of his title; he had known him when  Leycester had been a boy, running in and out of the cottage, always  followed by a pack of dogs, and generally doing some mischief.    \"I want you to do a little scene for me.\"    The old man groaned and looked at his picture firmly.    \"You know the glade in the woods opening out opposite the small island.  I want you to paint it.\"    \"I am sorry,\" began the old man.    Lord Leycester went on, interrupting him gently:    \"Have you seen it lately?\" he said, and as he spoke Stella came into  the room enticing the mastiff after her, with a handful of biscuits  she had taken from the cheffonier. \"It is very beautiful. It is the  loveliest bit on the whole river. Right up from the stream it stretches  green, with the young Spring leaves, to the sky above the hill. In the  open space between the trees the primroses have made a golden carpet. I  saw two kingfishers sailing up it as I stood and looked this morning,  and as I looked I thought how well, how delightfully you would put it  on canvas. Think! The bright green, the golden foreground, the early  Summer sky to crown the whole, and reflected in the river running  below.\"    Mr. Etheridge paused in his work and listened, and Stella, kneeling  over the dog, listened too, with down-bent face, and wondered how the  painter could stand so firm and obstinate.    To her the voice sounded like the sweetest music set to some poem. She  saw the picture as he drew it, and in her heart the music of the words  and voice found an echoing harmony.    Forgotten was the other man's warning; vain it would have been if he  had repeated it at that moment. As well associate the darkness of a  Winter's night with the bright gladness of a Summer's morning, as think  of evil in connection with that noble face and musical voice.    Mr. Etheridge paused, but he shook his head.    \"Very fine, very temptingly put; you are a master of words, Leycester;  but I am immovable as a rock. Indeed your eloquence is wasted; it is  not an impressionable man whom you address. I, James Etheridge, am on  this picture. I am lost in my work, Lord Leycester.\"    \"You will not do it?\"    The old man smiled.    \"I will not. To another man I should present an excuse, and mask my  refusal. With you anything but a simple 'no' is of no avail.\"    Lord Leycester smiled and turned away.    \"I am sorry,\" he said. \"I meant it for a present to my sister Lilian.\"    Again Stella's eyes turned toward him. This man--infamous!    The old man put down his brush and turned upon him.    \"Why didn't you say so at first?\" he said.    Lord Leycester smiled.    \"I wanted to see if you would do something for me--for myself,\" he  said, with infinite _naivete_.    \"You want it for Lady Lilian,\" said Mr. Etheridge. \"I will do it, of  course.\"    \"I shan't say thank you,\" said Lord Leycester. \"I have nothing to thank  you for. She shall do that. When will you come----\"    \"Next week--next month----\"    \"Now at once,\" said Lord Leycester, stretching out his hand with a  peculiar gesture which struck Stella by its infinite grace.    The old man groaned.    \"I thought so! I thought so! It would always be now at once with you.\"    \"The Spring won't wait for you! The green of those leaves is changing  now, very slowly, but surely, as we speak; in a week it will be gone,  and with it half--all the beauty will go too. You will come now, will  you not?\"    Mr. Etheridge looked round with comical dismay, then he laughed.    Lord Leycester's laugh chimed in, and he turned to Stella with the air  of a man who has conquered and needs no more words.    \"You see,\" said Mr. Etheridge, \"that is the way I am led, like a pig to  market, will I or will I not! And the sketch will take me, how long?\"    \"A few hours!\"    \"And there will be all the things to drag down----\"    Lord Leicester strode to an old-fashioned cabinet.    \"I will carry them, and yourself into the bargain if you like.\"    Then, with his hand upon the cabinet, he stopped short and turned to  Stella.    \"I beg your pardon!--I am always sinning. I forgot that there was now  a presiding spirit. I am so used to taking liberties with your uncle's  belongings; I know where all his paraphernalia is so well, that----\"    Stella rose and smiled at them.    \"Your knowledge is deeper than my uncle's, then,\" she said. \"Do not beg  pardon of me.\"    \"May I?\" he said, and he opened the cabinet and took out the  sketching-pad and color-box; then, with some difficulty, he  disentangled a folding camp-stool from a mass of artistic litter in a  corner, and then prepared to depart.    Mr. Etheridge watched these proceedings with a rueful countenance, but  seeing that resistance had long passed out of his power, he said:    \"Where is my hat, Stella? I must go, I suppose.\"    Lord Leycester opened the door for her, and she went out, followed by  all the dogs, and fetched the soft felt hat, holding it by the very  tips of her fingers.    With a sigh, Mr. Etheridge dropped it on his head.    \"Give me some of the things,\" he said; but Lord Leycester declined.    \"Not one,\" he said, laughing. And Mr. Etheridge, without another word,  walked out.    Lord Leycester stood looking at Stella, a wistful eagerness in his eyes.    \"I have gone so far,\" he said, \"that I am emboldened to venture still  further. Will you come too?\"    Stella started, and an eager light flashed for a moment in her eyes;  then she held out her hands and laughed.    \"I have to make a pudding,\" she said.    He looked at the white arms, and then at her, with an intensified  eagerness.    \"If you knew how beautiful the morning is--how grand the river  looks--you would let the pudding go.\"    Stella shook her head.    He inclined his head, too highly bred to persist.    \"I am so sorry,\" he said, simply. \"I am sorry now that I have gained my  way. I thought that you would have come.\"    Stella stood silent, and, with something like a sigh, put down the  things and held out her hand; but as he took the finger which she gave  him, his face brightened, and a light came into his eyes.    \"Are you still firm?\"    \"I would not desert the pudding for anything, my lord,\" said Stella,  naively.    At the \"my lord,\" a slight shade covered his face, but it went again  instantly, as he said:    \"Well, then, will you come when the inevitable pudding is made? There,\"  he said, eagerly, and still holding her hand he drew her to the window  and pointed with his whip, \"there's the place! It is not far--just  across the meadows, and through the first gate.

He isn't looking  well at all.\"    I think it was Uncle Roger's last argument which convinced Aunt Janet.  In the end she decided to go. Uncle Roger's house was to be closed, and  he and Peter and the Story Girl were to take up their abode with us.    We were all delighted. Felicity, in especial, seemed to be in seventh  heaven. To be left in sole charge of a big house, with three meals a  day to plan and prepare, with poultry and cows and dairy and garden  to superintend, apparently furnished forth Felicity's conception of  Paradise. Of course, we were all to help; but Felicity was to \"run  things,\" and she gloried in it.    The Story Girl was pleased, too.    \"Felicity is going to give me cooking lessons,\" she confided to me, as  we walked in the orchard. \"Isn't that fine? It will be easier when  there are no grown-ups around to make me nervous, and laugh if I make  mistakes.\"    Uncle Alec and aunts left on Monday morning. Poor Aunt Janet was full of  dismal forebodings, and gave us so many charges and warnings that we did  not try to remember any of them; Uncle Alec merely told us to be good  and mind what Uncle Roger said. Aunt Olivia laughed at us out of her  pansy-blue eyes, and told us she knew exactly what we felt like and  hoped we'd have a gorgeous time.    \"Mind they go to bed at a decent hour,\" Aunt Janet called back to Uncle  Roger as she drove out of the gate. \"And if anything dreadful happens  telegraph us.\"    Then they were really gone and we were all left \"to keep house.\"    Uncle Roger and Peter went away to their work. Felicity at once set the  preparations for dinner a-going, and allotted to each of us his portion  of service. The Story Girl was to prepare the potatoes; Felix and Dan  were to pick and shell the peas; Cecily was to attend the fire; I was to  peel the turnips. Felicity made our mouths water by announcing that she  was going to make a roly-poly jam pudding for dinner.    I peeled my turnips on the back porch, put them in their pot, and set  them on the stove. Then I was at liberty to watch the others, who had  longer jobs. The kitchen was a scene of happy activity. The Story Girl  peeled her potatoes, somewhat slowly and awkwardly--for she was not  deft at household tasks; Dan and Felix shelled peas and tormented Pat  by attaching pods to his ears and tail; Felicity, flushed and serious,  measured and stirred skilfully.    \"I am sitting on a tragedy,\" said the Story Girl suddenly.    Felix and I stared. We were not quite sure what a \"tragedy\" was, but we  did not think it was an old blue wooden chest, such as the Story Girl  was undoubtedly sitting on, if eyesight counted for anything.    The old chest filled up the corner between the table and the wall.  Neither Felix nor I had ever thought about it particularly. It was very  large and heavy, and Felicity generally said hard things of it when she  swept the kitchen.    \"This old blue chest holds a tragedy,\" explained the Story Girl. \"I know  a story about it.\"    \"Cousin Rachel Ward's wedding things are all in that old chest,\" said  Felicity.    Who was Cousin Rachel Ward? And why were her wedding things shut up  in an old blue chest in Uncle Alec's kitchen? We demanded the tale  instantly. The Story Girl told it to us as she peeled her potatoes.  Perhaps the potatoes suffered--Felicity declared the eyes were not  properly done at all--but the story did not.    \"It is a sad story,\" said the Story Girl, \"and it happened fifty  years ago, when Grandfather and Grandmother King were quite young.  Grandmother's cousin Rachel Ward came to spend a winter with them. She  belonged to Montreal and she was an orphan too, just like the Family  Ghost. I have never heard what she looked like, but she MUST have been  beautiful, of course.\"    \"Mother says she was awful sentimental and romantic,\" interjected  Felicity.    \"Well, anyway, she met Will Montague that winter. He was  handsome--everybody says so\"--    \"And an awful flirt,\" said Felicity.    \"Felicity, I WISH you wouldn't interrupt. It spoils the effect. What  would you feel like if I went and kept stirring things that didn't  belong to it into that pudding? I feel just the same way. Well, Will  Montague fell in love with Rachel Ward, and she with him, and it was  all arranged that they were to be married from here in the spring. Poor  Rachel was so happy that winter; she made all her wedding things with  her own hands. Girls did, then, you know, for there was no such thing as  a sewing-machine. Well, at last in April the wedding day came, and  all the guests were here, and Rachel was dressed in her wedding robes,  waiting for her bridegroom. And\"--the Story Girl laid down her knife and  potato and clasped her wet hands--\"WILL MONTAGUE NEVER CAME!\"    We felt as much of a shock as if we had been one of the expectant guests  ourselves.    \"What happened to him? Was HE killed too?\" asked Felix.    The Story Girl sighed and resumed her work.    \"No, indeed. I wish he had been. THAT would have been suitable and  romantic. No, it was just something horrid. He had to run away for debt!  Fancy! He acted mean right through, Aunt Janet says. He never sent even  a word to Rachel, and she never heard from him again.\"    \"Pig!\" said Felix forcibly.    \"She was broken-hearted of course. When she found out what had happened,  she took all her wedding things, and her supply of linen, and some  presents that had been given her, and packed them all away in this old  blue chest. Then she went away back to Montreal, and took the key with  her. She never came back to the Island again--I suppose she couldn't  bear to. And she has lived in Montreal ever since and never married. She  is an old woman now--nearly seventy-five. And this chest has never been  opened since.\"    \"Mother wrote to Cousin Rachel ten years ago,\" said Cecily, \"and asked  her if she might open the chest to see if the moths had got into it.  There's a crack in the back as big as your finger. Cousin Rachel wrote  back that if it wasn't for one thing that was in the trunk she would ask  mother to open the chest and dispose of the things as she liked. But  she could not bear that any one but herself should see or touch that one  thing. So she wanted it left as it was. Ma said she washed her hands of  it, moths or no moths. She said if Cousin Rachel had to move that  chest every time the floor had to be scrubbed it would cure her of her  sentimental nonsense. But I think,\" concluded Cecily, \"that I would feel  just like Cousin Rachel in her place.\"    \"What was the thing she couldn't bear any one to see?\" I asked.    \"Ma thinks it was her wedding dress. But father says he believes it was  Will Montague's picture,\" said Felicity. \"He saw her put it in. Father  knows some of the things that are in the chest. He was ten years old,  and he saw her pack it. There's a white muslin wedding dress and a  veil--and--and--a--a\"--Felicity dropped her eyes and blushed painfully.    \"A petticoat, embroidered by hand from hem to belt,\" said the Story Girl  calmly.    \"And a china fruit basket with an apple on the handle,\" went on  Felicity, much relieved. \"And a tea set, and a blue candle-stick.\"    \"I'd dearly love to see all the things that are in it,\" said the Story  Girl.    \"Pa says it must never be opened without Cousin Rachel's permission,\"  said Cecily.    Felix and I looked at the chest reverently. It had taken on a new  significance in our eyes, and seemed like a tomb wherein lay buried some  dead romance of the vanished years.    \"What happened to Will Montague?\" I asked.    \"Nothing!\" said the Story Girl viciously. \"He just went on living and  flourishing. He patched up matters with his creditors after awhile, and  came back to the Island; and in the end he married a real nice girl,  with money, and was very happy. Did you ever HEAR of anything so  unjust?\"    \"Beverley King,\" suddenly cried Felicity, who had been peering into  a pot, \"YOU'VE GONE AND PUT THE TURNIPS ON TO BOIL WHOLE JUST LIKE  POTATOES!\"    \"Wasn't that right?\" I cried, in an agony of shame.    \"Right!\" but Felicity had already whisked the turnips out, and was  slicing them, while all the others were laughing at me. I had added a  tradition on my own account to the family archives.    Uncle Roger roared when he heard it; and he roared again at night over  Peter's account of Felix attempting to milk a cow. Felix had previously  acquired the knack of extracting milk from the udder. But he had never  before tried to \"milk a whole cow.\" He did not get on well; the cow  tramped on his foot, and finally upset the bucket.    \"What are you to do when a cow won't stand straight?\" spluttered Felix  angrily.    \"That's the question,\" said Uncle Roger, shaking his head gravely.    Uncle Roger's laughter was hard to bear, but his gravity was harder.    Meanwhile, in the pantry the Story Girl, apron-enshrouded, was being  initiated into the mysteries of bread-making. Under Felicity's eyes she  set the bread, and on the morrow she was to bake it.    \"The first thing you must do in the morning is knead it well,\" said  Felicity, \"and the earlier it's done the better--because it's such a  warm night.\"    With that we went to bed, and slept as soundly as if tragedies of blue  chests and turnips and crooked cows had no place in the scheme of things  at all.        CHAPTER XIII. AN OLD PROVERB WITH A NEW MEANING    It was half-past five when we boys got up the next morning. We were  joined on the stairs by Felicity, yawning and rosy.    \"Oh, dear me, I overslept myself. Uncle Roger wanted breakfast at six.  Well, I suppose the fire is on anyhow, for the Story Girl is up. I guess  she got up early to knead the bread. She couldn't sleep all night for  worrying over it.\"    The fire was on, and a flushed and triumphant Story Girl was taking a  loaf of bread from the oven.    \"Just look,\" she said proudly. \"I have every bit"]]]
