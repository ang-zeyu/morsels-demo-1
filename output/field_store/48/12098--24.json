Presently I observed Mr. Riach and the seamen busy round the skiff, and,  still in the same blank, ran over to assist them; and as soon as I set  my hand to work, my mind came clear again. It was no very easy task, for  the skiff lay amidships and was full of hamper, and the breaking of the  heavier seas continually forced us to give over and hold on; but we all  wrought like horses while we could.    Meanwhile such of the wounded as could move came clambering out of the  fore-scuttle and began to help; while the rest that lay helpless in  their bunks harrowed me with screaming and begging to be saved.    The captain took no part. It seemed he was struck stupid. He stood  holding by the shrouds, talking to himself and groaning out aloud  whenever the ship hammered on the rock. His brig was like wife and  child to him; he had looked on, day by day, at the mishandling of poor  Ransome; but when it came to the brig, he seemed to suffer along with  her.    All the time of our working at the boat, I remember only one other  thing: that I asked Alan, looking across at the shore, what country it  was; and he answered, it was the worst possible for him, for it was a  land of the Campbells.    We had one of the wounded men told off to keep a watch upon the seas and  cry us warning. Well, we had the boat about ready to be launched, when  this man sang out pretty shrill: \"For God's sake, hold on!\" We knew  by his tone that it was something more than ordinary; and sure enough,  there followed a sea so huge that it lifted the brig right up and canted  her over on her beam. Whether the cry came too late, or my hold was too  weak, I know not; but at the sudden tilting of the ship I was cast clean  over the bulwarks into the sea.    I went down, and drank my fill, and then came up, and got a blink of the  moon, and then down again. They say a man sinks a third time for good. I  cannot be made like other folk, then; for I would not like to write how  often I went down, or how often I came up again. All the while, I was  being hurled along, and beaten upon and choked, and then swallowed  whole; and the thing was so distracting to my wits, that I was neither  sorry nor afraid.    Presently, I found I was holding to a spar, which helped me somewhat.  And then all of a sudden I was in quiet water, and began to come to  myself.    It was the spare yard I had got hold of, and I was amazed to see how far  I had travelled from the brig. I hailed her, indeed; but it was plain  she was already out of cry. She was still holding together; but whether  or not they had yet launched the boat, I was too far off and too low  down to see.    While I was hailing the brig, I spied a tract of water lying between  us where no great waves came, but which yet boiled white all over and  bristled in the moon with rings and bubbles. Sometimes the whole tract  swung to one side, like the tail of a live serpent; sometimes, for a  glimpse, it would all disappear and then boil up again. What it was I  had no guess, which for the time increased my fear of it; but I now know  it must have been the roost or tide race, which had carried me away so  fast and tumbled me about so cruelly, and at last, as if tired of that  play, had flung out me and the spare yard upon its landward margin.    I now lay quite becalmed, and began to feel that a man can die of cold  as well as of drowning. The shores of Earraid were close in; I could see  in the moonlight the dots of heather and the sparkling of the mica in  the rocks.    \"Well,\" thought I to myself, \"if I cannot get as far as that, it's  strange!\"    I had no skill of swimming, Essen Water being small in our  neighbourhood; but when I laid hold upon the yard with both arms, and  kicked out with both feet, I soon begun to find that I was moving. Hard  work it was, and mortally slow; but in about an hour of kicking  and splashing, I had got well in between the points of a sandy bay  surrounded by low hills.    The sea was here quite quiet; there was no sound of any surf; the moon  shone clear; and I thought in my heart I had never seen a place so  desert and desolate. But it was dry land; and when at last it grew so  shallow that I could leave the yard and wade ashore upon my feet, I  cannot tell if I was more tired or more grateful. Both, at least, I was:  tired as I never was before that night; and grateful to God as I trust I  have been often, though never with more cause.          CHAPTER XIV    THE ISLET    With my stepping ashore I began the most unhappy part of my adventures.  It was half-past twelve in the morning, and though the wind was broken  by the land, it was a cold night. I dared not sit down (for I thought  I should have frozen), but took off my shoes and walked to and fro upon  the sand, bare-foot, and beating my breast with infinite weariness.  There was no sound of man or cattle; not a cock crew, though it was  about the hour of their first waking; only the surf broke outside in the  distance, which put me in mind of my perils and those of my friend.  To walk by the sea at that hour of the morning, and in a place so  desert-like and lonesome, struck me with a kind of fear.    As soon as the day began to break I put on my shoes and climbed a  hill--the ruggedest scramble I ever undertook--falling, the whole way,  between big blocks of granite, or leaping from one to another. When I  got to the top the dawn was come. There was no sign of the brig, which  must have lifted from the reef and sunk. The boat, too, was nowhere to  be seen. There was never a sail upon the ocean; and in what I could see  of the land was neither house nor man.    I was afraid to think what had befallen my shipmates, and afraid to look  longer at so empty a scene. What with my wet clothes and weariness, and  my belly that now began to ache with hunger, I had enough to trouble  me without that. So I set off eastward along the south coast, hoping to  find a house where I might warm myself, and perhaps get news of those I  had lost. And at the worst, I considered the sun would soon rise and dry  my clothes.    After a little, my way was stopped by a creek or inlet of the sea, which  seemed to run pretty deep into the land; and as I had no means to get  across, I must needs change my direction to go about the end of it. It  was still the roughest kind of walking; indeed the whole, not only of  Earraid, but of the neighbouring part of Mull (which they call the Ross)  is nothing but a jumble of granite rocks with heather in among. At first  the creek kept narrowing as I had looked to see; but presently to my  surprise it began to widen out again. At this I scratched my head,  but had still no notion of the truth: until at last I came to a rising  ground, and it burst upon me all in a moment that I was cast upon a  little barren isle, and cut off on every side by the salt seas.    Instead of the sun rising to dry me, it came on to rain, with a thick  mist; so that my case was lamentable.    I stood in the rain, and shivered, and wondered what to do, till it  occurred to me that perhaps the creek was fordable. Back I went to the  narrowest point and waded in. But not three yards from shore, I plumped  in head over ears; and if ever I was heard of more, it was rather by  God's grace than my own prudence. I was no wetter (for that could hardly  be), but I was all the colder for this mishap; and having lost another  hope was the more unhappy.    And now, all at once, the yard came in my head. What had carried me  through the roost would surely serve me to cross this little quiet creek  in safety. With that I set off, undaunted, across the top of the isle,  to fetch and carry it back. It was a weary tramp in all ways, and if  hope had not buoyed me up, I must have cast myself down and given up.  Whether with the sea salt, or because I was growing fevered, I was  distressed with thirst, and had to stop, as I went, and drink the peaty  water out of the hags.    I came to the bay at last, more dead than alive; and at the first  glance, I thought the yard was something farther out than when I left  it. In I went, for the third time, into the sea. The sand was smooth  and firm, and shelved gradually down, so that I could wade out till the  water was almost to my neck and the little waves splashed into my face.  But at that depth my feet began to leave me, and I durst venture in no  farther. As for the yard, I saw it bobbing very quietly some twenty feet  beyond.    I had borne up well until this last disappointment; but at that I came  ashore, and flung myself down upon the sands and wept.    The time I spent upon the island is still so horrible a thought to me,  that I must pass it lightly over. In all the books I have read of people  cast away, they had either their pockets full of tools, or a chest of  things would be thrown upon the beach along with them, as if on purpose.  My case was very different. I had nothing in my pockets but money and  Alan's silver button; and being inland bred, I was as much short of  knowledge as of means.    I knew indeed that shell-fish were counted good to eat; and among the  rocks of the isle I found a great plenty of limpets, which at first I  could scarcely strike from their places, not knowing quickness to be  needful. There were, besides, some of the little shells that we call  buckies; I think periwinkle is the English name. Of these two I made my  whole diet, devouring them cold and raw as I found them; and so hungry  was I, that at first they seemed to me delicious.    Perhaps they were out of season, or perhaps there was something wrong  in the sea about my island. But at least I had no sooner eaten my first  meal than I was seized with giddiness and retching, and lay for a long  time no better than dead.

Frost is not uncommon, and during north  winds, thin ice may form, though snow is unknown in any part of  the island.    The prevailing wind is the easterly trade breeze, but from  November to February, cool north winds, rarely lasting more than  forty-eight hours, are experienced in the western part of the  island, to which they add a third seasonal change. Hurricanes may  occur from August to October, but they are rare and sometimes five  or six years pass without such a storm.    GRAND SCENIC SURPRISES.    Many \"globe-trotters\" who have never included this little corner  of the world in their itinerary, do not appreciate the fact that  nowhere under the sun can be found a more perfect climate, grander  mountain scenery, more charming valleys, more picturesque ruins,  and fertile fields than Cuba offers to their view.    In another portion of this work will be found descriptions of the  cities of Cuba, and brief mention here of some of the beauties of  the country may not be amiss.    One of the grandest bits of scenery in the known world is to be found in  the valley of the Yumuri, rivaling in sublimity the far-famed Lookout  Mountain view and the Yosemite of the Sierra Nevadas. The journey leads  over a winding trail, easily traversed by the native horses, up a steep  hill, until, after a continuous climb of an hour and a half, the road  turns around the edge of a grassy precipice, and the beautiful valley,  with its patches of green and gold, spreads away in the distance. The  little river of Yumuri winds its way through its flower-decked banks  until it reaches the bay beyond, while in the distance rise the mighty  mountains, clod in their coats of evergreen, and over all the fleecy  clouds, and the sky of azure blue.    In this vicinity an opportunity is given the sight-seer to visit a  sugar house and gain an idea of the sugar-making process, though  on a very small scale, and enjoy a half an hour in the study of  the natives, and their home life.    A traveler, in writing of this place, says:    \"Our interview with the little black 'ninos' was highly amusing.  On entering the court yard of the negro quarters, a dozen little  black imps, of all ages and sexes and sizes, perfectly naked,  rushed towards us, and crossing their arms upon their breasts,  fell upon their knees before us, and jabbered and muttered, out of  which could be distinguished, 'Master, master, give us thy  blessing,' which we interpreted to mean 'tin;' whereupon we  scattered sundry 'medios' among them! Hey! presto! what a change!  The little black devils fell over one another, fought, tugged, and  scrambled to secure a prize, while anyone who had been lucky  enough to obtain a coin, marched off in a state of dignified  delight, his distended little stomach going before him like a  small beer barrel, while the owner of it kept shouting out,  'Medio, yo tengo medio' (five cents, I have five cents).\"    THE CAVES OF BELLAMAR.    One of the most interesting trips that can be made is to the  \"Caves of Bellamar,\" which may be found about two and a half miles  southeast of the city of Matanzas.    The journey takes the traveler up a winding and rugged road to the  top of a hill, where the \"Cave house\" is reached, a large frame  structure built over the entrance, and containing, among other  objects of interest, a large collection of beautiful crystal  formations found in the cave.    Here the tourist enters his name in the visitors' register, pays  his dollar, and follows the boy guide down the stairs into the  cave. About one hundred and fifty feet from the entrance a small  bridge is crossed, and the \"Gothic Temple\" is reached. The only  light comes from a few scattered lanterns, and is consequently  very obscure, but one can see the millions of crystals, the  thousand weird forms, and realize that it is surpassingly  beautiful. The temple is about two hundred feet in length and  seventy feet in width, and while it does not equal in size or  solemn grandeur the temple of the same name in the Mammoth cave of  Kentucky, it greatly excels it in the richness and splendor of its  crystal formations and beautiful effects.    The spectator possessed of strongly developed imaginative powers  cannot fail to feel himself in fairy land. From the gloomy corners  come gnomes and demons, and in the crystal shadows he sees sprites  and lovely fairies, keeping gay revel to dreamy airs, played on  invisible strings by spirit hands.    One of the most beautiful objects in the cave is the \"Fountain of  Snow,\" a name given to one of the great pillars, called by the  natives the \"Cloak of the Virgin.\" Others are known as \"Columbus  Mantle,\" \"The Altar,\" and \"The Guardian Spirit.\"    \"Who has not seen the Caves of Bellamar has not seen Cuba.\"    UNDER NATURE'S DOME.    One of the most vivid pieces of descriptive writing, referring to  the beauties of Cuban skies, is from the pen of James M.  Phillippo:    \"The splendor of the early dawn in Cuba, as in the tropical  islands in its vicinity, has been referred to. The whole sky is  often so resplendent that it is difficult to determine where the  orb of day will appear. Small fleecy clouds are often seen  floating on the north wind, and as they hover over the mountains  and meet the rays of the sun, are changed into liquid gold and a  hundred intensely beautiful dyes more splendid than the tints of  the rainbow. During the cooler months, the mornings are delightful  till about ten o'clock, the air soon after dawn becoming agreeably  elastic, and so transparent that distant objects appear as if  delineated upon the bright surface of the air; the scenery  everywhere, especially when viewed from an eminence, is  indescribably rich and glowing; the tops of the rising grounds and  the summits of the mountains are radiant with a flood of light,  while the vapor is seen creeping along the valleys, here  concealing the entrance to some beautiful glen, and there  wreathing itself fantastically around a tall spire or groves of  palm trees that mark the site of a populous village.    \"The finest and most gorgeous sunsets occur in the West Indian  Archipelago during the rainy seasons. The sky is then sublimely  mantled with gigantic masses of cloud, glowing with a thousand  gorgeous dyes, and seeming to collect at the close of day as  though to form a couch for the sun's repose. In these he sinks,  flooding them with glory, touching both heavens and earth with  gold and amber brightness long after he has flung his beams across  the other hemisphere, or perhaps half revealing himself through  gauze-like clouds, a crimson sphere, at once rayless and of  portentous size.    \"The azure arch, which by an optical illusion limits our view on  every side, seems here, and in the tropics generally, higher than  in England, even higher than in Italy. Here is seen, in a  perfection compared to which even Italian skies are vapid and  uninteresting, that pure, serene, boundless sky, that atmosphere  of clear blue, or vivid red, which so much contributes to enrich  the pencil of Claude Lorraine. The atmosphere of Cuba, as  everywhere within the tropics, except when the high winds prevail,  is so unpolluted, so thin, so elastic, so dry, so serene, and so  almost inconceivably transparent and brilliant, that every object  is distinct and clearly defined as if cut out of the clear blue  sky. All travelers agree in praising the calm depths of the  intensely blue and gloriously bright skies of inter-tropical  latitudes. In the temperate zone, it is estimated that about 1,000  stars are visible to the naked eye at one time; but here, from the  increased elevation and wider extent of the vault, owing to the  clearness of the atmosphere, especially as seen from a high  mountain chain, the number is greatly augmented. If, however,  these luminaries may not be seen here in greater numbers, they  certainly shine with greater brilliancy. The different  constellations are indeed so greatly magnified as to give the  impression that the power of the eye is increased. Venus rises  like a little moon, and in the absence of the greater casts a  distinguishable shadow.    \"The Milky Way, which in the temperate zone has the appearance of  a luminous phosphorescent cloud, and, as is well known, derives  its brightness from the diffused light of myriads of stars  condensed into so small space that fifty thousand of them are  estimated to pass across the disc of the telescope in an hour, is  here seen divided into constellations, and the whole galaxy is of  so dazzling a whiteness as to make it resemble a pure flame of  silvery light thrown across the heavens, turning the atmosphere  into a kind of green transparency. Besides this, there are vast  masses of stellar nebulae of indefinite diversity and form, oval,  oblate, elliptical, as well as of different degrees of density,  diffused over the firmament, and discoverable through a common  telescope, all novel to an inhabitant of temperate climes, and  recalling the exclamation of the psalmist: 'The heavens declare  the glory of God, ... the firmament showeth forth His handiwork.'        \"'The stars      Are elder scripture, writ of God's own hand,      Scripture authentic, uncorrupt by man.'    \"An interesting phenomenon sometimes occurs here, as in other  islands of the West Indies, which was long supposed to be seen  only in the eastern hemisphere. A short time before sunrise or  sunset, a flush of strong, white light, like that of the Aurora  Borealis, extends from the horizon a considerable way up the  zenith, and so resembles the dawn as to prove greatly deceptive to  a stranger. As he watches the luminous track he sees it decrease  instead of becoming more vivid, and at length totally disappear,  leaving the heavens nearly as dark as previous to its appearance.  This is the zodiacal light.\"            CHAPTER VII.    WEALTH FROM NATURE'S STORES IN THE FORESTS AND FIELDS OF CUBA.    The "]]]
