The day  passed like its predecessor; they breakfasted in the shade, and danced and  slept until noon, when they rose, and, at their queen's behest, assembled in  the cool meadow, and sat them down in a circle about her. Fair and very  debonair she shewed, crowned with her laurel wreath, as for a brief space  she scanned the company, and then bade Neifile shew others the way with a  story. Neifile made no excuse, and gaily thus began.      NOVEL I.    --  Martellino pretends to be a paralytic, and makes it appear as if he were  cured by being placed upon the body of St. Arrigo. His trick is detected; he  is beaten and arrested, and is in peril of hanging, but finally escapes.  --    Often has it happened, dearest ladies, that one who has studied to raise a  laugh at others' expense, especially in regard of things worthy to be had in  reverence, has found the laugh turn against himself, and sometimes to his  loss: as, in obedience to the queen's command, and by way of introducing our  theme, I am about to shew you, by the narrative of an adventure which befell  one of our own citizens, and after a course of evil fortune had an entirely  unexpected and very felicitous issue.    Not long ago there was at Treviso a German, named Arrigo, a poor man who got  his living as a common hired porter, but though of so humble a condition,  was respected by all, being accounted not only an honest but a most holy  man; insomuch that, whether truly or falsely I know not, the Trevisans  affirm, that on his decease all the bells of the cathedral of Treviso began  to toll of their own accord. Which being accounted a miracle, this Arrigo  was generally reputed a saint; and all the people of the city gathered  before the house where his body lay, and bore it, with a saint's honours,  into the cathedral, and brought thither the halt and paralytic and blind,  and others afflicted with disease or bodily defects, as hoping that by  contact with this holy body they would all be healed. The people thus  tumultuously thronging the church, it so chanced that there arrived in  Treviso three of our own citizens, of whom one was named Stecchi, another  Martellino, and the third Marchese; all three being men whose habit it was  to frequent the courts of the nobles and afford spectators amusement by  assuming disguises and personating other men. Being entire strangers to the  place, and seeing everybody running to and fro, they were much astonished,  and having learned the why and wherefore, were curious to go see what was to  be seen. So at the inn, where they put up, Marchese began:--\"We would fain  go see this saint; but for my part I know not how we are to reach the spot,  for I hear the piazza is full of Germans and other armed men, posted there  by the Lord who rules here to prevent an uproar, and moreover the church, so  far as one may learn, is so full of folk that scarce another soul may enter  it.\" Whereupon Martellino, who was bent on seeing what was to be seen,  said:--\"Let not this deter us; I will assuredly find a way of getting to the  saint's body.\" \"How?\" rejoined Marchese. \"I will tell you,\" replied  Martellino; \"I will counterfeit a paralytic, and thou wilt support me on one  side and Stecchi on the other, as if I were not able to go alone, and so you  will enter the church, making it appear as if you were leading me up to the  body of the saint that he may heal me, and all that see will make way and  give us free passage.\" Marchese and Stecchi approved the plan; so all three  forthwith left the inn and repaired to a lonely place, where Martellino  distorted his hands, his fingers, his arms, his legs, and also his mouth and  eyes and his entire face in a manner horrible to contemplate; so that no  stranger that saw him could have doubted that he was impotent and paralysed  in every part of his body. In this guise Marchese and Stecchi laid hold of  him, and led him towards the church, assuming a most piteous air, and humbly  beseeching everybody for God's sake to make way for them. Their request was  readily granted; and, in short, observed by all, and crying out at almost  every step, \"make way, make way,\" they reached the place where St. Arrigo's  body was laid. Whereupon some gentlemen who stood by, hoisted Martellino on  to the saint's body, that thereby he might receive the boon of health. There  he lay still for a while, the eyes of all in the church being riveted upon  him in expectation of the result; then, being a very practised performer, he  stretched, first, one of his fingers, next a hand, afterwards an arm, and so  forth, making as if he gradually recovered the use of all his natural  powers. Which the people observing raised such a clamour in honour of St.  Arrigo that even thunder would have been inaudible. Now it chanced that hard  by stood a Florentine, who knew Martellino well, though he had failed to  recognise him, when, in such strange guise, he was led into the church; but  now, seeing him resume his natural shape, the Florentine recognised him, and  at once said with a laughÂ°\"God's curse upon him. Who that saw him come but  would have believed that he was really paralysed?\" These words were  overheard by some of the Trevisans, who began forthwith to question the  Florentine. \"How?\" said they; \"was he then not paralysed? No, by God  returned the Florentine he has always been as straight as any of us; he has  merely shewn you that he knows better than any man alive how to play this  trick of putting on any counterfeit semblance that he chooses.\" Thereupon  the Trevisans, without further parley, made a rush, clearing the way and  crying out as they went:--\"Seize this traitor who mocks at God and His  saints; who, being no paralytic, has come hither in the guise of a paralytic  to deride our patron saint and us.\" So saying, they laid hands on him,  dragged him down from where he stood, seized him by the hair, tore the  clothes from his back, and fell to beating and kicking him, so that it  seemed to him as if all the world were upon him. He cried out:--\"Pity, for  God's sake,\" and defended himself as best he could: all in vain, however;  the press became thicker and thicker moment by moment. Which Stecchi and  Marchese observing began to say one to the other that 'twas a bad business;  yet, being apprehensive on their own account, they did not venture to come  to his assistance, but cried out with the rest that he ought to die, at the  same time, however, casting about how they might find the means to rescue  him from the hands of the people, who would certainly have killed him, but  for a diversion which Marchese hastily effected. The entire posse of the  signory being just outside, he ran off at full speed to the Podesta's  lieutenant, and said to him:--\"Help, for God's sake; there is a villain here  that has cut my purse with full a hundred florins of gold in it; prithee  have him arrested that I may have my own again.\" Whereupon, twelve sergeants  or more ran forthwith to the place where hapless Martellino was being carded  without a comb, and, forcing their way with the utmost difficulty through  the throng, rescued him all bruised and battered from their hands, and led  him to the palace; whither he was followed by many who, resenting what he  had done, and hearing that he was arrested as a cutpurse, and lacking better  pretext for harassing him, began one and all to charge him with having cut  their purses. All which the deputy of the Podesta had no sooner heard, than,  being a harsh man, he straightway took Martellino aside and began to examine  him. Martellino answered his questions in a bantering tone, making light of  the arrest; whereat the deputy, losing patience, had him bound to the  strappado, and caused him to receive a few hints of the cord with intent to  extort from him a confession of his guilt, by way of preliminary to hanging  him. Taken down from the strappado, and questioned by the deputy if what his  accusers said were true, Martellino, as nothing was to be gained by denial,  answered:--\"My lord, I am ready to confess the truth; let but my accusers  say, each of them, when and where I cut his purse, and I will tell you what  I have and what I have not done.\" \"So be it,\" said the deputy, and caused a  few of them to be summoned. Whereupon Martellino, being charged with having  cut this, that or the other man's purse eight, six or four days ago, while  others averred that he had cut their purses that very day, answered thus:--  \"My lord, these men lie in the throat, and for token that I speak true, I  tell you that, so far from having been here as long as they make out, it is  but very lately that I came into these parts, where I never was before; and  no sooner was I come, than, as my ill-luck would have it, I went to see the  body of this saint, and so have been carded as you see; and that what I say  is true, his Lordship's intendant of arrivals, and his book, and also my  host may certify. Wherefore, if you find that even so it is as I say,  hearken not to these wicked men, and spare me the torture and death which  they would have you inflict.\" In this posture of affairs Marchese and  Stecchi, learning that the Podesta's deputy was dealing rigorously with  Martellino, and had already put him to the strappado, grew mightily alarmed.  \"We have made a mess of it,\" they said to themselves; \"we have only taken  him out of the frying-pan to toss him into the fire.\" So, hurrying hither  and thither with the utmost zeal, they made diligent search until they found  their host, and told him how matters stood. The host had his laugh over the  affair, and then brought them to one Sandro Agolanti, who dwelt in Treviso  and had great interest with the Lord of the place. The host laid the whole  matter before Sandro,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37329"],[0,"The Domestic Cat (#18)"],[1,"  English courage requires no such keeping up, and it will be a poor day  for this country when it does.  Besides, it is only gentlemen (?) who  hunt; and, well as our army is officered, it is, after all, the men who  do the fighting; and it has always struck me that good beef and mutton,  together with a determination to do their duty, are the mainstays on  which our soldiers depend in the day of battle.    A great deal, I think, of the cruelty which is inflicted on the poor  cat, is done through ignorance of pussy's nature and constitution; done  unwittingly, and with no real intention of doing the animal an injury.    It is very cruel indeed to starve the creature, with the idea that you  will induce her to catch more mice.  When a cat is hungry the system is  weak, the mind is dull, and the nerves so far from being well-strung  that she will do anything sooner than hunt.  A well-filled stomach gives  pussy patience, and that is much wanted for mouse-killing; besides, you  must not forget that cats kill mice as much for the sport as anything  else.    Another very common form of cruelty is that of turning the cat out every  night.  Cats need their comforts, and enjoy them too, more than any  other domestic animal we possess.  Leaving her out at night not only  exposes her to colds, inflammations, and various diseases, but it leads  her to contract bad habits; and she eventually gets trapped or killed,  and no wonder; is she not, through your carelessness, a nuisance to the  whole neighbourhood?    It is cruel not to feed your cats with regularity.  They expect it, and  need it; and, if they do not get it, what else can you expect but that  your cat will become a thief?    What is called \"wandering\" cats is extremely cruel.  A man has no  further use for his cat, so he \"wanders\" her.  I assure you it would be  far more humane to drown her at once.  How would you, yourself, like to  be wandered--to be taken abroad somewhere, and placed down in the centre  of savages; hungry and cold, and longing and pining for the home you  left behind you; and in danger every moment of being cruelly slain?  Don't you think that speedy dissolution were more to be desired than  such a life?    It is cruel, when your cat has kittens, to permit more to live than you  can find decent homes for.  It is a shame to a poor little kit, after it  has opened its eyes to the wonders all around it, and begun to get happy  and funny.  Always keep one or two kittens for sake of the mother, and  try, if possible, to find some one to take them.  But the worst form of  unintentional cruelty is that of leaving your poor favourite at home,  when you go to the seaside, or to summer quarters.  Often and often, on  the return of the family, the unhappy cat is found lying in the empty  hall, dead or dying, and wasted away to a mere handful of bones and  skin--this in itself testifying to the sufferings she must have  undergone for the want of food and water.  Such gross _carelessness  ought to be made penal_.  I do not know whether the Society has ever yet  prosecuted anyone for thus cruelly starving a cat, but I should think it  would have little difficulty in obtaining a conviction.    I come now to mention some cases of intentional and specific cruelty,  and shall be as brief as possible.    Some men, both young and old, think that a cat is a fit subject for  torture and cruelty of all kinds; hence they never miss the chance of  shying a stone after pussy's retreating figure.  Cases, too, are  continually cropping up in the police courts, of men having tortured  cats to the death with dogs.    Cat skins are considered of some value by the furriers.  At a sale not  long since in London, there were some three thousand cat skins.  Where  think you, reader, do these come from?  That is a question unfortunately  only too easily answered.  In almost all large cities there exists a  gang of ruffians--you cannot call them by a milder name--who eke out a  sort of livelihood by stealing cats by every available means and method.  But worse than this remains to be told; it is darkly whispered, and I  have some reason to believe it may be but too true, that many of those  poor cats are _skinned alive_, in the belief that the living skin thus  procured retains the gloss.    In Greenland I have seen young seals flayed alive by the score.  That  was a sickening sight enough, but skinning alive a poor harmless cat  must be many times worse.  I wish I could say that it was only the  lowest class of ruffians that ill-treat poor cats to the death, but--and  I know this for certain--there are men who pass as gentlemen, who night  after night set traps for cats that stray into their gardens, and kill  them in the cruellest manner; and some of these fellows, too, keep  neither poultry, pigeons, nor rabbits, and haven't a flower in their  gardens worthy of the name, only _they hate cats_.  I know one gentleman  (?) who thus traps and kills cats because he has a passion for fur rugs,  which he thus indulges on the cheap.    Little boys, and those too, sometimes the sons of respectable parents  who ought to have taught them better, are often dreadfully cruel to  cats, stoning them wherever found, and setting dogs to worry them to  death.    A lady, a friend of mine, once attracted by the heartrending cries of a  cat, found two young fiends, with a pretty pussy tied in an apron,  gouging its eyes out with a nail!    A common form of cruelty to cats, in some rural districts of England, is  that of tying two of them together by the tails and hanging them over a  rope or pole to fight to the death.    Such cases as that of cutting cats' tails off for wanton mischief,  burning or boiling cats alive, though not unknown, I am happy to say are  very rare.    Now, considering how very useful an animal a cat is, I think it is high  time the law interfered to protect her from violence and ill-usage.    I should like to see a tax imposed upon all cats, and a home for lost  cats, precisely on the same principles as the home for lost and starving  dogs, only with this difference, that there should be no reward offered  for bringing a cat to the home.  Remember this, that a stranger or  starving cat will come to anyone who says a kind word to it, so  policemen would have no difficulty in catching them.    The revenue from the imposition of even a small tax would be very large,  and it would not only help to clear the country of a whole army corps of  thieving, prowling, homeless cats, but give to the cats of respectable  people a greater value in the eyes of the law, and a greater chance of  taking their walks abroad without being molested.    We have a law to protect even our wild birds, why not one for the  protection of my friend the harmless, useful cat?    In conclusion, let me assure lovers and owners of cats, that, as the law  stands at present, the only way to keep their favourites alive, and free  from danger, is to be kind to them, feed them well and teach them, as  far as possible, to keep to the house at night.    We think that men who kill, and trap, and injure our cats are  exceedingly cruel.  And so they are, and I hope they will in time learn  to be a shade more merciful.  At the same time, don't forget that the  temptation to take revenge upon a cat for vines destroyed, beautiful  flowerbeds torn up, favourite rabbits murdered in their hutches, and  valuable pigeons torn and eaten in their dovecots, is a very great  temptation indeed.  You see, reader, there are two sides to every  question.    Pray think of the matter.    CHAPTER TWENTY.    PUSSY'S TRICKS AND MANNERS.    When I was a boy, it used to be a positive pain to me to have to enter a  large library and choose a book.  I used to wander round and round the  well-filled shelves like a butterfly floating over a clover-field.  I  didn't know where to alight.  I would fain have begun at the beginning,  and read the lot--but that was impracticable.  Hence my difficulty.  I  am in a somewhat similar fix now.  I have so many original anecdotes of  cat life and customs that I don't know which to tell.    If I had space at command you should have the whole lot, and I would  arrange them into classes according to their character; as it is, I must  be content to present the reader with some account of a few of pussy's  tricks and manners, deduced from these and from my own rather large  experience of cat life.    Every child knows how fond cats are of hunting and catching mice, but no  cat of any respectability would think of confining her attentions to  mice alone.  The very presence of a cat about a house will usually  suffice to keep these destructive pests at bay; and if one should pop  out of its hole, it knows, or ought to know, what to expect.  But seldom  will a high-bred cat condescend to eat a mouse.  She will play with it  as long as hope keeps up its little heart; when that fails it, pussy  turns it over once or twice to see whether it is really dead or only  shamming, and then walks disdainfully away.  The next higher game is  rats, but these she seldom cares to eat, only she kills them on the  spot.  She knows that rats have teeth and can use them, so she doesn't  romp with them.  I have known rats inflict such severe wounds upon a cat  that they ultimately proved fatal.    Cats delight to spend a day in the woods, bird-catching.  They rob the  nests, too, when they find any, and cases have occurred of a cat paying  visits to nests day after day until the young were hatched, then eating  them.  (I once had a blackbird's nest in the side of a bank at the  roadside--a strange place for a blackbird to build.  I often used to see  a polecat close to, and I am convinced it knew of the nest, but it never  robbed it until the young were hatched.)    Nearly all cats who live in the country hunt over the hills and the  woods, and a great plague, too, gamekeepers find them.  There is no  animal which a cat may meet"]]]
