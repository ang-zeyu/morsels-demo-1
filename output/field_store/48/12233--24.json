On hearing this, Mr. Woolf decided at once to admit  and conceal the travelers, and Richard went back to bring the king.    When they arrived at the house, they found Mr. Woolf making preparations  for their reception. They placed the king by the fire to warm and dry  his clothes, and they gave him such food as could be provided on so  sudden an emergency. As the morning was now approaching, it was  necessary to adopt some plan of concealment for the day, and Mr. Woolf  decided upon concealing his guests in his barn. He said that there  were holes and hiding places built in his house, but that they had all  been discovered on some previous search, and, in case of any suspicion  or alarm, the officers would go directly to them all. He took the  travelers, accordingly, to the barn, and concealed them there among  the hay. He said that he would himself, during the day, make inquiries  in respect to the practicability of their going on upon their journey,  and come and report to them in the evening.    Accordingly, when the evening came, Mr. Woolf returned, relieved them  from their confinement, and took them back again to the house. His  report, however, in respect to the continuance of their journey, was  very unfavorable. He thought it would be impossible, he said, for them  to cross the Severn. The Republican forces had stationed guards at all  the bridges, ferries, and fords, and at every other practicable place  of crossing, and no one was allowed to pass without a strict  examination. The country was greatly excited, too, with the intelligence  of the king's escape; rewards were offered for his apprehension, and  heavy penalties denounced upon all who should harbor or conceal him.  Under these circumstances, Mr. Woolf recommended that Charles should  go back to Boscobel, and conceal himself as securely as possible there,  until some plan could be devised for effecting his escape from the  country.    The king had no alternative but to accede to this plan. He waited at  Mr. Woolf's house till midnight, in order that the movement in the  streets of the town might have time entirely to subside, and then,  disappointed and discouraged by the failure of his hopes, he prepared  to set out upon his return. Mr. Woolf made some changes in his disguise,  and bathed his face in a decoction of walnut leaves, which he had  prepared during the day, to alter his complexion, which was naturally  very dark and peculiar, and thus exposed him to danger of discovery.  When all was ready, the two travelers bade their kind host farewell,  and crept forth again through the silent streets, to return, by the  way they came, back to Boscobel.    They went on very well till they began to approach the branch stream  where they had met with their adventure with the miller. They could  not cross this stream by the bridge without going by the mill again,  which they were both afraid to do. The king proposed that they should  go a little way below, and ford the stream. Richard was afraid to  attempt this, as he could not swim; and as the night was dark, and the  current rapid, there would be imminent danger of their getting beyond  their depth. Charles said that _he_ could swim, and that he would,  accordingly, go first and try the water. They groped their way down,  therefore, to the bank, and Charles, leaving his guide upon the land,  waded in, and soon disappeared from view as he receded from the shore.  He returned, however, after a short time, in safety, and reported the  passage practicable, as the water was only three or four feet deep;  so, taking Richard by the hand, he led him into the stream. It was a  dismal and dangerous undertaking, wading thus through a deep and rapid  current in darkness and cold, but they succeeded in passing safely  over.    They reached Boscobel before the morning dawned, and Richard, when  they arrived, left the king in the wood while he went toward the house  to reconnoiter, and see if all was safe. He found within an officer  of the king's army, a certain Colonel Carlis, who had fled from  Worcester some time after the king had left the field, and, being  acquainted with the situation of Boscobel, had sought refuge there;  William Penderel, who had remained in charge of Boscobel, having  received and secreted him when he arrived.    Richard and William brought Colonel Carlis out into the wood to see  the king. They found him sitting upon the ground at the foot of a tree,  entirely exhausted. He was worn out with hardship and fatigue. They  took him to the house. They brought him to the fire, and gave him some  food. The colonel drew off his majesty's heavy peasant shoes and coarse  stockings. They were soaked with water and full of gravel. The colonel  bathed his feet, which were sadly swollen and blistered, and, as there  were no other shoes in the house which would answer for him to wear,  Dame Penderel warmed and dried those which the colonel had taken off,  by filling them with hot ashes from the fire, and then put them on  again.    The king continued to enjoy such sort of comforts as these during the  night, but when the morning drew near it became necessary to look out  for some place of concealment. The Penderels thought that no place  within the house would be safe, for there was danger every hour of the  arrival of a band of soldiers, who would not fail to search the mansion  most effectually in every part. There was the wood near by, which was  very secluded and solitary; but still they feared that, in case of a  search, the wood would be explored as effectually as the dwelling.  Under these circumstances, Carlis was looking around, perplexed and  uncertain, not knowing what to do, when he perceived some scattered  oaks standing by themselves in a field not far from the house, one of  which seemed to be so full and dense in its foliage as to afford some  hope of concealment there. The tree, it seems, had been headed down  once or twice, and this pruning had had the effect, usual in such  cases, of making the branches spread and grow very thick and full. The  colonel thought that though, in making a search for fugitives, men  might very naturally explore a thicket or a grove, they would not  probably think of examining a detached and solitary tree; he proposed,  accordingly, that the king and himself should climb up into this  spreading oak, and conceal themselves for the day among its branches.    The king consented to this plan. They took some provisions, therefore,  as soon as the day began to dawn, and something to answer the purpose  of a cushion, and proceeded to the tree. By the help of William and  Richard the king and the colonel climbed up, and established themselves  in the top. The colonel placed the cushion for the king on the best  support among the limbs that he could find. The bread and cheese, and  a small bottle of beer, which Richard and William had brought for their  day's supplies, they suspended to a branch within their reach. The  colonel then seated himself a little above the king, in such a manner  that the monarch's head could rest conveniently in his lap, and in as  easy a position as it was possible, under such circumstances, to attain.  Richard and William, then, after surveying the place of retreat all  around from below, in order to be sure that the concealment afforded  by the foliage was every where complete, went away, promising to keep  faithful watch during the day and to return in the evening. All things  being thus arranged in the oak, the colonel bade his majesty to close  his eyes and go to sleep, saying that he would take good care that he  did not fall. The king followed his directions, and slept safely for  many hours.    In the course of the day the king and Carlis saw, by means of the  openings between the leaves, through which, as through loop holes in  a tower, they continually reconnoitered the surrounding fields, men  passing to and fro, some of whom they imagined to be soldiers searching  the wood. They were not, however, themselves molested. They passed the  day undisturbed, except by the incessant anxiety and alarm which they  necessarily suffered, and the fatigue and pain, which must have become  almost intolerable before night, from their constrained and comfortless  position. Night, however, came at last, and relieved them from their  duress. They descended from the tree and stole back cautiously to the  house, the king resolving that he could not bear such hardship another  day, and that they must, accordingly, find some other hiding place for  him on the morrow. We can scarcely be surprised at this decision. A  wild beast could hardly have endured a second day in such a lair.    Other plans of concealment for the king were accordingly formed that  night, and measures were soon concerted, as we shall see in the next  chapter, to effect his escape from the country. The old tree, however,  which had sheltered him so safely, was not forgotten. In after years,  when the monarch was restored to his throne, and the story of his  dangers and his escape was made known throughout the kingdom, thousands  of visitors came to look upon the faithful tree which had thus afforded  his majesty its unconscious but effectual protection. Every one took  away a leaf or a sprig for a souvenir, and when, at last, the proprietor  found that there was danger that the whole tree would be carried away  unless he interposed, he fenced it in and tilled the ground around it,  to defend it from further mutilation. It has borne the name of the  Royal Oak from that time to the present day, and has been the theme  of narrators and poets without number, who have celebrated its praises  in every conceivable form of composition. There is, however, probably  no one of them all who has done more for the wide extension of its  fame among all the ranks and gradations of society than the unknown  author of the humble distich,      \"The royal oak, it was the tree,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6675"],[0,"The Loss of the S. S. Titanic: Its Story and Its Lessons (#18)"],[1,", the Titanic had a considerable list to  port, so much so that one boat at any rate swung so far away from the  side that difficulty was experienced in getting passengers in. This  list was increased towards the end, and Colonel Gracie relates that  Mr. Lightoller, who has a deep, powerful voice, ordered all passengers  to the starboard side. This was close before the end. They crossed  over, and as they did so a crowd of steerage passengers rushed up and  filled the decks so full that there was barely room to move. Soon  afterwards the great vessel swung slowly, stern in the air, the lights  went out, and while some were flung into the water and others dived  off, the great majority still clung to the rails, to the sides and  roofs of deck-structures, lying prone on the deck. And in this  position they were when, a few minutes later, the enormous vessel  dived obliquely downwards. As she went, no doubt many still clung to  the rails, but most would do their best to get away from her and jump  as she slid forwards and downwards. Whatever they did, there can be  little question that most of them would be taken down by suction, to  come up again a few moments later and to fill the air with those  heartrending cries which fell on the ears of those in the lifeboats  with such amazement. Another survivor, on the other hand, relates that  he had dived from the stern before she heeled over, and swam round  under her enormous triple screws lifted by now high out of the water  as she stood on end. Fascinated by the extraordinary sight, he watched  them up above his head, but presently realizing the necessity of  getting away as quickly as possible, he started to swim from the ship,  but as he did she dived forward, the screws passing near his head. His  experience is that not only was no suction present, but even a wave  was created which washed him away from the place where she had gone  down.    Of all those fifteen hundred people, flung into the sea as the Titanic  went down, innocent victims of thoughtlessness and apathy of those  responsible for their safety, only a very few found their way to the  Carpathia. It will serve no good purpose to dwell any longer on the  scene of helpless men and women struggling in the water. The heart of  everyone who has read of their helplessness has gone out to them in  deepest love and sympathy; and the knowledge that their struggle in  the water was in most cases short and not physically painful because  of the low temperature--the evidence seems to show that few lost their  lives by drowning--is some consolation.    If everyone sees to it that his sympathy with them is so practical as  to force him to follow up the question of reforms personally, not  leaving it to experts alone, then he will have at any rate done  something to atone for the loss of so many valuable lives.    We had now better follow the adventures of those who were rescued from  the final event in the disaster. Two accounts--those of Colonel Gracie  and Mr. Lightoller--agree very closely. The former went down clinging  to a rail, the latter dived before the ship went right under, but was  sucked down and held against one of the blowers. They were both  carried down for what seemed a long distance, but Mr. Lightoller was  finally blown up again by a \"terrific gust\" that came up the blower  and forced him clear. Colonel Gracie came to the surface after holding  his breath for what seemed an eternity, and they both swam about  holding on to any wreckage they could find. Finally they saw an  upturned collapsible boat and climbed on it in company with twenty  other men, among them Bride the Marconi operator. After remaining thus  for some hours, with the sea washing them to the waist, they stood up  as day broke, in two rows, back to back, balancing themselves as well  as they could, and afraid to turn lest the boat should roll over.  Finally a lifeboat saw them and took them off, an operation attended  with the greatest difficulty, and they reached the Carpathia in the  early dawn. Not many people have gone through such an experience as  those men did, lying all night on an overturned, ill-balanced boat,  and praying together, as they did all the time, for the day and a ship  to take them off.    Some account must now be attempted of the journey of the fleet of  boats to the Carpathia, but it must necessarily be very brief.  Experiences differed considerably: some had no encounters at all with  icebergs, no lack of men to row, discovered lights and food and water,  were picked up after only a few hours' exposure, and suffered very  little discomfort; others seemed to see icebergs round them all night  long and to be always rowing round them; others had so few men  aboard--in some cases only two or three--that ladies had to row and in  one case to steer, found no lights, food or water, and were adrift  many hours, in some cases nearly eight.    The first boat to be picked up by the Carpathia was one in charge of  Mr. Boxhall. There was only one other man rowing and ladies worked at  the oars. A green light burning in this boat all night was the  greatest comfort to the rest of us who had nothing to steer by:  although it meant little in the way of safety in itself, it was a  point to which we could look. The green light was the first intimation  Captain Rostron had of our position, and he steered for it and picked  up its passengers first.    Mr. Pitman was sent by First Officer Murdock in charge of boat 5, with  forty passengers and five of the crew. It would have held more, but no  women could be found at the time it was lowered. Mr. Pitman says that  after leaving the ship he felt confident she would float and they  would all return. A passenger in this boat relates that men could not  be induced to embark when she went down, and made appointments for the  next morning with him. Tied to boat 5 was boat 7, one of those that  contained few people: a few were transferred from number 5, but it  would have held many more.    Fifth Officer Lowe was in charge of boat 14, with fifty-five women and  children, and some of the crew. So full was the boat that as she went  down Mr. Lowe had to fire his revolver along the ship's side to  prevent any more climbing in and causing her to buckle. This boat,  like boat 13, was difficult to release from the lowering tackle, and  had to be cut away after reaching the sea. Mr. Lowe took in charge  four other boats, tied them together with lines, found some of them  not full, and transferred all his passengers to these, distributing  them in the darkness as well as he could. Then returning to the place  where the Titanic had sunk, he picked up some of those swimming in the  water and went back to the four boats. On the way to the Carpathia he  encountered one of the collapsible boats, and took aboard all those in  her, as she seemed to be sinking.    Boat 12 was one of the four tied together, and the seaman in charge  testified that he tried to row to the drowning, but with forty women  and children and only one other man to row, it was not possible to  pull such a heavy boat to the scene of the wreck.    Boat 2 was a small ship's boat and had four or five passengers and  seven of the crew. Boat 4 was one of the last to leave on the port  side, and by this time there was such a list that deck chairs had to  bridge the gap between the boat and the deck. When lowered, it  remained for some time still attached to the ropes, and as the Titanic  was rapidly sinking it seemed she would be pulled under. The boat was  full of women, who besought the sailors to leave the ship, but in  obedience to orders from the captain to stand by the cargo port, they  remained near; so near, in fact, that they heard china falling and  smashing as the ship went down by the head, and were nearly hit by  wreckage thrown overboard by some of the officers and crew and  intended to serve as rafts. They got clear finally, and were only a  short distance away when the ship sank, so that they were able to pull  some men aboard as they came to the surface.    This boat had an unpleasant experience in the night with icebergs;  many were seen and avoided with difficulty.    Quartermaster Hickens was in charge of boat 6, and in the absence of  sailors Major Peuchen was sent to help to man her. They were told to  make for the light of the steamer seen on the port side, and followed  it until it disappeared. There were forty women and children here.    Boat 8 had only one seaman, and as Captain Smith had enforced the rule  of \"Women and children only,\" ladies had to row. Later in the night,  when little progress had been made, the seaman took an oar and put a  lady in charge of the tiller. This boat again was in the midst of  icebergs.    Of the four collapsible boats--although collapsible is not really the  correct term, for only a small portion collapses, the canvas edge;  \"surf boats\" is really their name--one was launched at the last moment  by being pushed over as the sea rose to the edge of the deck, and was  never righted. This is the one twenty men climbed on. Another was  caught up by Mr. Lowe and the passengers transferred, with the  exception of three men who had perished from the effects of immersion.  The boat was allowed to drift away and was found more than a month  later by the Celtic in just the same condition. It is interesting to  note how long this boat had remained afloat after she was supposed to  be no longer seaworthy. A curious coincidence arose from the fact that  one of my brothers happened to be travelling on the Celtic, and  looking over the side, saw adrift on the sea a boat belonging to the  Titanic in which I had been wrecked.    The two other collapsible boats came to the Carpathia carrying full  loads of passengers: in one, the forward starboard boat and one of the  last to leave, was Mr. Ismay. Here four Chinamen were concealed under  the feet of the passengers. How they got there no"]]]
