On the relative intensity of derived shadows (175-179).    175.    ON PAINTING.    The derived shadow is stronger in proportion as it is nearer to its  place of origin.    176.    HOW SHADOWS FADE AWAY AT LONG DISTANCES.    Shadows fade and are lost at long distances because the larger  quantity of illuminated air which lies between the eye and the  object seen tints the shadow with its own colour.    177.    _a b_ will be darker than _c d_ in proportion as _c d_ is broader  than _a b_.    [Footnote: In the original MS. the word _lume_ (light) is written at  the apex of the pyramid.]    178.    It can be proved why the shadow _o p c h_ is darker in proportion as  it is nearer to the line _p h_ and is lighter in proportion as it is  nearer to the line _o c_. Let the light _a b_, be a window, and let  the dark wall in which this window is, be _b s_, that is, one of the  sides of the wall.    Then we may say that the line _p h_ is darker than any other part of  the space _o p c h_, because this line faces the whole surface in  shadow of [Footnote: In the original the diagram is placed between  lines 27 and 28.] the wall _b s_. The line _o c_ is lighter than the  other part of this space _o p c h_, because this line faces the  luminous space _a b_.    Where the shadow is larger, or smaller, or equal the body which  casts it.    [First of the character of divided lights. [Footnote 14: _lumi  divisi_. The text here breaks off abruptly.]    OF THE COMPOUND SHADOW _F, R, C, H_ CAUSED BY A SINGLE LIGHT.    The shadow _f r c h_ is under such conditions as that where it is  farthest from its inner side it loses depth in proportion. To prove  this:    Let _d a_, be the light and _f n_ the solid body, and let _a e_ be  one of the side walls of the window that is _d a_. Then I  say--according to the 2nd [proposition]: that the surface of any  body is affected by the tone of the objects surrounding it,--that  the side _r c_, which faces the dark wall _a e_ must participate of  its darkness and, in the same way that the outer surface which faces  the light _d a_ participates of the light; thus we get the outlines  of the extremes on each side of the centre included between them.]    This is divided into four parts. The first the extremes, which  include the compound shadow, secondly the compound shadow between  these extremes.    179.    THE ACTION OF THE LIGHT AS FROM ITS CENTRE.    If it were the whole of the light that caused the shadows beyond the  bodies placed in front of it, it would follow that any body much  smaller than the light would cast a pyramidal shadow; but experience  not showing this, it must be the centre of the light that produces  this effect.    [Footnote: The diagram belonging to this passage is between lines 4  and 5 in the original. Comp. the reproduction Pl. IV, No. 4. The  text and drawing of this chapter have already been published with  tolerable accuracy. See M. JORDAN: \"_Das Malerbuch des Leonardo da  Vinci_\". Leipzig 1873, P. 90.]    PROOF.    Let _a b_ be the width of the light from a window, which falls on a  stick set up at one foot from _a c_ [Footnote 6: _bastone_ (stick).  The diagram has a sphere in place of a stick.]. And let _a d_ be the  space where all the light from the window is visible. At _c e_ that  part of the window which is between _l b_ cannot be seen. In the  same way _a m_ cannot be seen from _d f_ and therefore in these two  portions the light begins to fail.    Shadow as produced by two lights of different size (180. 181).    180.    A body in light and shade placed between two equal lights side by  side will cast shadows in proportion to the [amount of] light. And  the shadows will be one darker than the other in proportion as one  light is nearer to the said body than the other on the opposite  side.    A body placed at an equal distance between two lights will cast two  shadows, one deeper than the other in proportion, as the light which  causes it is brighter than the other.    [Footnote: In the MS. the larger diagram is placed above the first  line; the smaller one between l. 4 & 5.]    181.    A light which is smaller than the body it illuminates produces  shadows of which the outlines end within [the surface of] the body,  and not much compound shadow; and falls on less than half of it. A  light which is larger than the body it illuminates, falls on more  than half of it, and produces much compound shadow.    The effect of light at different distances.    182.    OF THE SHADOW CAST BY A BODY PLACED BETWEEN 2 EQUAL LIGHTS.    A body placed between 2 equal lights will cast 2 shadows of itself  in the direction of the lines of the 2 lights; and if you move this  body placing it nearer to one of the lights the shadow cast towards  the nearer light will be less deep than that which falls towards the  more distant one.    Further complications in the derived shadows (183-187).    183.    The greatest depth of shadow is in the simple derived shadow because  it is not lighted by either of the two lights _a b, c d_.    The next less deep shadow is the derived shadow _e f n_; and in this  the shadow is less by half, because it is illuminated by a single  light, that is _c d_.    This is uniform in natural tone because it is lighted throughout by  one only of the two luminous bodies [10]. But it varies with the  conditions of shadow, inasmuch as the farther it is away from the  light the less it is illuminated by it [13].    The third degree of depth is the middle shadow [Footnote 15: We  gather from what follows that _q g r_ here means _ombra media_ (the  middle shadow).]. But this is not uniform in natural tone; because  the nearer it gets to the simple derived shadow the deeper it is  [Footnote 18: Compare lines 10-13], and it is the uniformly gradual  diminution by increase of distance which is what modifies it  [Footnote 20: See Footnote 18]: that is to say the depth of a shadow  increases in proportion to the distance from the two lights.    The fourth is the shadow _k r s_ and this is all the darker in  natural tone in proportion as it is nearer to _k s_, because it gets  less of the light _a o_, but by the accident [of distance] it is  rendered less deep, because it is nearer to the light _c d_, and  thus is always exposed to both lights.    The fifth is less deep in shadow than either of the others because  it is always entirely exposed to one of the lights and to the whole  or part of the other; and it is less deep in proportion as it is  nearer to the two lights, and in proportion as it is turned towards  the outer side _x t_; because it is more exposed to the second light  _a b_.    [Footnote: The diagram to this section is given on Pl. V. To the  left is the facsimile of the beginning of the text belonging to it.]    184.    OF SIMPLE SHADOWS.    Why, at the intersections _a_, _b_ of the two compound shadows _e f_  and _m e_, is a simple shadow pfoduced as at _e h_ and _m g_, while  no such simple shadow is produced at the other two intersections _c  d_ made by the very same compound shadows?    ANSWER.    Compound shadow are a mixture of light and shade and simple shadows  are simply darkness. Hence, of the two lights _n_ and _o_, one falls  on the compound shadow from one side, and the other on the compound  shadow from the other side, but where they intersect no light falls,  as at _a b_; therefore it is a simple shadow. Where there is a  compound shadow one light or the other falls; and here a difficulty  arises for my adversary since he says that, where the compound  shadows intersect, both the lights which produce the shadows must of  necessity fall and therefore these shadows ought to be neutralised;  inasmuch as the two lights do not fall there, we say that the shadow  is a simple one and where only one of the two lights falls, we say  the shadow is compound, and where both the lights fall the shadow is  neutralised; for where both lights fall, no shadow of any kind is  produced, but only a light background limiting the shadow. Here I  shall say that what my adversary said was true: but he only mentions  such truths as are in his favour; and if we go on to the rest he  must conclude that my proposition is true. And that is: That if both  lights fell on the point of intersection, the shadows would be  neutralised. This I confess to be true if [neither of] the two  shadows fell in the same spot; because, where a shadow and a light  fall, a compound shadow is produced, and wherever two shadows or two  equal lights fall, the shadow cannot vary in any part of it, the  shadows and the lights both being equal. And this is proved in the  eighth [proposition] on proportion where it is said that if a given  quantity has a single unit of force and resistance, a double  quantity will have double force and double resistance.    DEFINITION.    The intersection _n_ is produced by the shadows caused by the light  _b_, because this light _b_ produces the shadow _x b_, and the  shadow _s b_, but the intersection _m_ is produced by the light _a_  which causes the shadow _s a_, and the shadow _x a_.    But if you uncover both the lights _a b_, then you get the two  shadows _n m_ both at once, and besides these, two other, simple  shadows are produced at _r o_ where neither of the two lights falls  at all. The grades of depth in compound shadows are fewer in  proportion as the lights falling on, and crossing them are less  numerous.    186.    Why the intersections at _n_ being composed of two compound derived  shadows, forms a compound shadow and not a simple one, as happens  with other intersections of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/502"],[0,"Desert Gold (#18)"],[1,"  which had been so suggestively defined in Belding's terse description  and Ladd's encomiums, and in her own audacious speech and merry laugh  and flashing eye of that never-to-be-forgotten first meeting.  She  might have been an entirely different girl. But Gale remembered; and  when the ice had been somewhat broken between them, he was always  trying to surprise her into her real self. There were moments that  fairly made him tingle with expectation. Yet he saw little more than a  ghost of her vivacity, and never a gleam of that individuality which  Belding had called a devil. On the few occasions that Dick had been  left alone with her in the patio Nell had grown suddenly unresponsive  and restrained, or she had left him on some transparent pretext. On the  last occasion Mercedes returned to find Dick staring disconsolately at  the rose-bordered path, where Nell had evidently vanished.  The Spanish  girl was wonderful in her divination.    \"Senor Dick!\" she cried.    Dick looked at her, soberly nodded his head, and then he laughed.  Mercedes had seen through him in one swift glance.  Her white hand  touched his in wordless sympathy and thrilled him.  This Spanish girl  was all fire and passion and love.  She understood him, she was his  friend, she pledged him what he felt would be the most subtle and  powerful influence.    Little by little he learned details of Nell's varied life.  She had  lived in many places.  As a child she remembered moving from town to  town, of going to school among schoolmates whom she never had time to  know.  Lawrence, Kansas, where she studied for several years, was the  later exception to this changeful nature of her schooling.  Then she  moved to Stillwater, Oklahoma, from there to Austin, Texas, and on to  Waco, where her mother met and married Belding.  They lived in New  Mexico awhile, in Tucson, Arizona, in Douglas, and finally had come to  lonely Forlorn River.    \"Mother could never live in one place any length of time,\" said Nell.  \"And since we've been in the Southwest she has never ceased trying to  find some trace of her father.  He was last heard of in Nogales  fourteen years ago.  She thinks grandfather was lost in the Sonora  Desert.... And every place we go is worse.  Oh, I love the desert.  But  I'd like to go back to Lawrence--or to see Chicago or New York--some of  the places Mr. Gale speaks of.... I remember the college at Lawrence,  though I was only twelve. I saw races--and once real football.  Since  then I've read magazines and papers about big football games, and I was  always fascinated .... Mr. Gale, of course, you've seen games?    \"Yes, a few,\" replied Dick; and he laughed a little.  It was on his  lips then to tell her about some of the famous games in which he had  participated.  But he refrained from exploiting himself. There was  little, however, of the color and sound and cheer, of the violent  action and rush and battle incidental to a big college football game  that he did not succeed in making Mercedes and Nell feel just as if  they had been there.  They hung breathless and wide-eyed upon his words.    Some one else was present at the latter part of Dick's narrative. The  moment he became aware of Mrs. Belding's presence he remembered  fancying he had heard her call, and now he was certain she had done so.  Mercedes and Nell, however, had been and still were oblivious to  everything except Dick's recital.  He saw Mrs. Belding cast a strange,  intent glance upon Nell, then turn and go silently through the patio.  Dick concluded his talk, but the brilliant beginning was not sustained.    Dick was haunted by the strange expression he had caught on Mrs.  Belding's face, especially the look in her eyes.  It had been one of  repressed pain liberated in a flash of certainty.  The mother had seen  just as quickly as Mercedes how far he had gone on the road of love.  Perhaps she had seen more--even more than he dared hope.  The incident  roused Gale.  He could not understand Mrs. Belding, nor why that look  of hers, that seeming baffled, hopeless look of a woman who saw the  inevitable forces of life and could not thwart them, should cause him  perplexity and distress.  He wanted to go to her and tell her how he  felt about Nell, but fear of absolute destruction of his hopes held him  back.  He would wait. Nevertheless, an instinct that was perhaps akin  to self-preservation prompted him to want to let Nell know the state of  his mind. Words crowded his brain seeking utterance.  Who and what he  was, how he loved her, the work he expected to take up soon, his  longings, hopes, and plans--there was all this and more.  But something  checked him.  And the repression made him so thoughtful and quiet, even  melancholy, that he went outdoors to try to throw off the mood. The sun  was yet high, and a dazzling white light enveloped valleys and peaks.  He felt that the wonderful sunshine was the dominant feature of that  arid region.  It was like white gold.  It had burned its color in a  face he knew.  It was going to warm his blood and brown his skin.  A  hot, languid breeze, so dry that he felt his lips shrink with its  contact, came from the desert; and it seemed to smell of wide-open,  untainted places where sand blew and strange, pungent plants gave a  bitter-sweet tang to the air.    When he returned to the house, some hours later, his room had been put  in order.  In the middle of the white coverlet on his table lay a fresh  red rose.  Nell had dropped it there.  Dick picked it up, feeling a  throb in his breast.  It was a bud just beginning to open, to show  between its petals a dark-red, unfolding heart. How fragrant it was,  how exquisitely delicate, how beautiful its inner hue of red, deep and  dark, the crimson of life blood!    Had Nell left it there by accident or by intent?  Was it merely  kindness or a girl's subtlety?  Was it a message couched elusively, a  symbol, a hope in a half-blown desert rose?        VI    THE YAQUI    TOWARD evening of a lowering December day, some fifty miles west of  Forlorn River, a horseman rode along an old, dimly defined trail. From  time to time he halted to study the lay of the land ahead. It was bare,  somber, ridgy desert, covered with dun-colored greasewood and stunted  prickly pear.  Distant mountains hemmed in the valley, raising black  spurs above the round lomas and the square-walled mesas.    This lonely horseman bestrode a steed of magnificent build, perfectly  white except for a dark bar of color running down the noble head from  ears to nose.  Sweatcaked dust stained the long flanks.  The horse had  been running.  His mane and tail were laced and knotted to keep their  length out of reach of grasping cactus and brush.  Clumsy home-made  leather shields covered the front of his forelegs and ran up well to  his wide breast.  What otherwise would have been muscular symmetry of  limb was marred by many a scar and many a lump.  He was lean, gaunt,  worn, a huge machine of muscle and bone, beautiful only in head and  mane, a weight-carrier, a horse strong and fierce like the desert that  had bred him.    The rider fitted the horse as he fitted the saddle.  He was a young man  of exceedingly powerful physique, wide-shouldered, long-armed,  big-legged.  His lean face, where it was not red, blistered and  peeling, was the hue of bronze.  He had a dark eye, a falcon gaze,  roving and keen.  His jaw was prominent and set, mastiff-like; his lips  were stern.  It was youth with its softness not yet quite burned and  hardened away that kept the whole cast of his face from being ruthless.    This young man was Dick Gale, but not the listless traveler, nor the  lounging wanderer who, two months before, had by chance dropped into  Casita.  Friendship, chivalry, love--the deep-seated, unplumbed  emotions that had been stirred into being with all their incalculable  power for spiritual change, had rendered different the meaning of life.  In the moment almost of their realization the desert had claimed Gale,  and had drawn him into its crucible.  The desert had multiplied weeks  into years.  Heat, thirst, hunger, loneliness, toil, fear, ferocity,  pain--he knew them all.  He had felt them all--the white sun, with its  glazed, coalescing, lurid fire; the caked split lips and rasping,  dry-puffed tongue; the sickening ache in the pit of his stomach; the  insupportable silence, the empty space, the utter desolation, the  contempt of life; the weary ride, the long climb, the plod in sand, the  search, search, search for water; the sleepless night alone, the watch  and wait, the dread of ambush, the swift flight; the fierce pursuit of  men wild as Bedouins and as fleet, the willingness to deal sudden  death, the pain of poison thorn, the stinging tear of lead through  flesh; and that strange paradox of the burning desert, the cold at  night, the piercing icy wind, the dew that penetrated to the marrow,  the numbing desert cold of the dawn.    Beyond any dream of adventure he had ever had, beyond any wild story he  had ever read, had been his experience with those hard-riding rangers,  Ladd and Lash.  Then he had traveled alone the hundred miles of desert  between Forlorn River and the Sonoyta Oasis.  Ladd's prophecy of  trouble on the border had been mild compared to what had become the  actuality.  With rebel occupancy of the garrison at Casita, outlaws,  bandits, raiders in rioting bands had spread westward.  Like troops of  Arabs, magnificently mounted, they were here, there, everywhere along  the line; and if murder and worse were confined to the Mexican side,  pillage and raiding were perpetrated across the border.  Many a  dark-skinned raider bestrode one of Belding's fast horses, and indeed  all except his selected white thoroughbreds had been stolen.  So the  job of the rangers had become more than a patrolling of the boundary  line to keep Japanese and Chinese from being smuggled into the United  States."]]]
