Nor has its part been of  less importance in the sphere of politics. The wanderer through its  halls is reminded not only of Fra Angelico da Fiesole and Fra  Bartolommeo, to whose artistic genius the monastery is indebted for the  treasures which adorn its halls, refectory, corridors, and cells, but of  Cosimo de Medici, Lorenzo his great descendant, of Savonarola, and the  long series of contests here waged against temporal and spiritual  tyranny. The works of Giotto and Domenico Ghirlandajo are likewise to be  found in the monastery, and there also miniature pictures of the most  flourishing period of art may be seen ornamenting the books of the  choir. Every historian who has written upon Florence has taken care not  to omit San Marco and its inhabitants.    We are glad to announce that a society of artists at Florence has  undertaken to give as wide a publicity as possible to the noblest  productions of art in this monastery. A former work by the same men is a  good indication of what may now be expected from them. Some years since  they published copies of the most important pictures from the collection  of the Florentine Academy of Art. They gave sixty prints with  explanations. Among engravings from galleries this was one of the best,  containing in moderate compass a history of Tuscan art from Cimabue to  Andrea del Sarto. The new work, which has long been in preparation but  has been delayed by unfavorable circumstances, will now be carried  through the press without delay. Its title is, _San Marco Convento dei  Padri Predicatori in Firenze illustrato e inciso principalmente nei  dipinti del B. Giovanni Angelico_. Antonio Parfetti, the successor of  Morghen and Garavaglia as professor of the art of engraving on copper at  the Florentine Academy, has the artistic supervision of the enterprise.  Father Vincenzo Marchese, to whom the public are indebted for the work  well known to all students, on the artists of the Dominican order, is to  furnish a history of the monastery, a biography of Fra Angelico,  together with explanations of the engravings. Everything is thus in the  most capable hands. The execution of the copperplates leaves nothing to  be desired. The draughtsmen and engravers having had the best  preparatory practice in the above-mentioned series from the Academy,  have fully entered into the spirit of the originals; both outlines and  shading are said by the best critics to combine the greatest delicacy  with exactness, and to reproduce the expression of feeling which is the  difficulty in these Florentine works, with tact and truth. As yet they  have finished only the smaller frescoes which adorn almost every cell;  but they will soon have ready the larger ones, which will show how this  painter, whose sphere was mainly the pious emotions of the soul, was  also master of the most thrilling effects. The same is proved by the  powerful picture of the Crucifixion in the chapter hall, with its heads  so full of expression, a selection from which has just been published by  G.B. Nocchi, who some years since issued the well-known collection of  drawings from the Life of Jesus in the Academy. The impression of the  frescoes on Chinese paper has been done with the greatest care. Forty  plates and forty printed folio sheets will complete the work, which is  to be put at a moderate price. These illustrations of San Marco will be  universally welcomed with delight by the admirers of the beautiful, for  there the painter who most purely represented Christian art passed the  greater part of his life, leaving behind him an incomparable mass of the  most characteristic and charming creations.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. William W. Story, who some time since abandoned a lucrative  profession to devote himself to art, has recently returned from Rome,  where he had been practicing sculpture during the past three years. Mr.  Story, we understand, has brought home with him to Boston several models  of classical subjects, the fruits of his labors abroad, which are spoken  of in the highest terms by those who have had the privilege of  inspecting them. Mr. Story is the only son of the late Justice Story of  Massachusetts. Before going abroad he had distinguished himself by some  of his attempts at sculpture, one of which was a bust of his father,  which he executed in marble. A copy of this work has been purchased or  ordered by some of his father's admirers in London, to be placed in one  of the Inns of Court. Mr. Story also made himself known by a volume of  miscellaneous poems, published in 1845. It is his intention, we learn,  to return to Italy in the spring.           *       *       *       *       *    Les Beautes de la France is the title of a splendid new work now  publishing at Paris. It consists of a collection of engravings on steel,  representing the principal cities, cathedrals, public monuments,  chateaux, and picturesque landscapes of France. Each engraving is  accompanied by four pages of text, giving the complete history of the  edifice or locality represented. What is curious about it is that the  engravings are made in London, for what reason we are not informed.           *       *       *       *       *    The first exhibition of paintings, such as is now given annually by our  academies, was at Paris in the year 1699. In September of that year, at  the suggestion of Mansart, the first was held in the Louvre. It  consisted of two hundred and fifty-three paintings, twenty-four pieces  of sculpture, and twenty-nine engravings. The second and last during the  reign of Louis XIV. was opened in 1704. That was composed of five  hundred and twenty specimens. During the reign of Louis XV., from 1737,  there were held twenty-four expositions. That of 1767 was remarkable for  the presence of several of the marine pieces of Claude Joseph Vernet.  During the reign of Louis XVI., from 1775 to 1791 there were nine  expositions. The _Horatii_, one of the master pieces of David, figured  in that of 1785. His first pieces had appeared in that of 1782. The  former Republic, too, upon stated occasions \"exposed the works of the  artists forming the general commune of the arts.\" It was in these that  David acquired his celebrity as a painter which alone saved his head  from the revolutionary axe. The Paris exhibition will this year commence  on the fifteenth of December.           *       *       *       *       *    The largest specimen of Enamel Painting probably in the world, has  recently been completed by Kloeber and Martens at Berlin. It is four and  a half feet high, and eight feet broad, and it is intended for the  castle church at Wittenberg. The subject is Christ on the Cross, and at  his feet, on the right, stands Luther holding an open bible and looking  up to the Savior; and, on the left, Melancthon, the faithful cooperator  of the great reformer. The tombs of both are in this church, and it is  known that to those who, after the capture of the town, desired to  destroy these tombs, the emperor, Charles V., answered, \"I war against  the living, not against the dead!\" It was to the portal of this church  that Luther affixed the famous protest against indulgences which  occasioned the first movement of the Reformation. The king has caused  two doors to be cast in bronze, with this protest inscribed on them, so  that it will now be seen there in imperishable characters.           *       *       *       *       *    The original portrait of Sir Francis Drake wearing the jewel around his  neck which Queen Elizabeth gave him, is now in London for the purpose of  being copied for the United Service Club. Sir T.T.F.E. Drake, to whom it  belongs, carried to London at the same time, for the inspection of the  curious in such matters, the original jewel, which, beyond the interest  of its associations with Elizabeth and Drake, is valuable as a work of  art. On the outer case is a carving by Valerio Belli, called Valerio  Vincentino, of a black man kneeling to a white. This is not mentioned by  Walpole in his account of Vincentino. Within is a capital and  well-preserved miniature of Queen Elizabeth, by Isaac Oliver, set round  with diamonds and pearls.           *       *       *       *       *    The Family of Vernet--the \"astonishing family of Vernet\"--is thus  referred to by a Paris correspondent of the _Courier and Enquirer_:         \"History, probably, does not show another instance of so remarkable       a descent from father to son, through four generations, of the       possession, in an eminent degree, of a special and rare talent.       Claude Joseph was born in 1714, and was the son of a distinguished       painter of his day, Antoine Vernet. He excelled all his       contemporaries in sea pieces. His son, Antoine Charles Horace       Vernet, was, after David, one of the first painters of the empire,       excelling especially in battle scenes. His Rivoli, Marengo,       Austerlitz, Wagram, and his twenty-eight plates illustrative of the       campaign of Bonaparte in Italy, have secured a very high reputation       for A.C.H. Vernet. The greatest living French painter--perhaps it       may be truly said, the greatest painter of the day--is Horace       Vernet, son of the last named. He was born in 1789 _in the Louvre_.       He, like his father, excels in battle scenes and is remarkable for       the vivacity and boldness of his conceptions. He is now covering       the walls of the historic gallery at Versailles with canvas, which       will cause him to descend to posterity as the greatest of his       family.

A short walk of ten minutes through St  James' Park and the Mall would bring him to Buckingham Palace, and  from that to Mrs Schroeter's was only a stone-throw. Whether the old  affectionate relations were resumed it is impossible to say. If there  were any letters of the second London visit, it is curious that Haydn  should not have preserved them with the rest. There is no ground for  supposing that any disagreement came between the pair: the facts point  rather the other way. When Haydn finally said farewell to London, he  left the scores of his six last symphonies \"in the hands of a lady.\"  Pohl thinks the lady was Mrs Schroeter, and doubtless he is right.  At any rate Haydn's esteem for her, to use no stronger term, is  sufficiently emphasized by his having inscribed to her the three trios  numbered 1, 2 and 6 in the Breitkopf & Hartel list.    Haydn's Note-Book    Reference has already been made to the diary or note-book kept by Haydn  during his visit. The original manuscript of this curious document  came into the hands of his friend, Joseph Weigl, whose father had been  'cellist to Prince Esterhazy. A similar diary was kept during the  second visit, but this was lost; and indeed the first note-book narrowly  escaped destruction at the hands of a careless domestic. Haydn's  autograph was at one time in the possession of Dr Pohl. A copy of it  made by A. W. Thayer, the biographer of Beethoven, in 1862, became,  as previously stated, the property of Mr Krehbiel, who has printed  the entries, with running comment, in his \"Music and Manners in the  Classical Period\" (London, 1898). Mr Krehbiel rightly describes some  of the entries as mere \"vague mnemonic hints,\" and adds that one entry  which descants in epigrammatic fashion on the comparative morals of the  women of France, Holland and England is unfit for publication. Looking  over the diary, it is instructive to observe how little reference  is made to music. One or two of the entries are plainly memoranda of  purchases to be made for friends. There is one note about the National  Debt of England, another about the trial of Warren Hastings. London, we  learn, has 4000 carts for cleaning the streets, and consumes annually  800,000 cartloads of coals. That scandalous book, the Memoirs of Mrs  Billington, which had just been published, forms the subject of a long  entry. \"It is said that her [Mrs Billington's] character is very faulty,  but nevertheless she is a great genius, and all the women hate her  because she is so beautiful.\"    Prince of Wale's Punch    A note is made of the constituents of the Prince of Wales's punch--\"One  bottle champagne, one bottle Burgundy, one bottle rum, ten lemons, two  oranges, pound and a half of sugar.\" A process for preserving milk \"for  a long time\" is also described. We read that on the 5th of November  (1791) \"there was a fog so thick that one might have spread it on bread.  In order to write I had to light a candle as early as eleven o'clock.\"  Here is a curious item--\"In the month of June 1792 a chicken, 7s.; an  Indian [a kind of bittern found in North America] 9s.; a dozen larks, 1  coron [? crown]. N.B.--If plucked, a duck, 5s.\"    Haydn liked a good story, and when he heard one made a note of it. The  diary contains two such stories. One is headed \"Anectod,\" and runs: \"At  a grand concert, as the director was about to begin the first number,  the kettledrummer called loudly to him, asking him to wait a moment,  because his two drums were not in tune. The leader could not and would  not wait any longer, and told the drummer to transpose for the present.\"  The second story is equally good. \"An Archbishop of London, having asked  Parliament to silence a preacher of the Moravian religion who preached  in public, the Vice-President answered that could easily be done: only  make him a Bishop, and he would keep silent all his life.\"    On the whole the note-book cannot be described as of strong biographical  interest, but a reading of its contents as translated by Mr Krehbiel  will certainly help towards an appreciation of the personal character of  the composer.

Haydn left London some time towards the end of June 1792. He had  intended to visit Berlin, in response to an invitation from King  Frederick William II., but he altered his route in order to meet Prince  Anton Esterhazy, who was at Frankfort for the coronation of the Emperor  Francis II.    Beethoven    A more interesting meeting took place at Bonn. Beethoven, then a young  man of twenty-two, was still living with his people in the Wenzegasse,  but already arrangements had been made by the Elector for his paying a  somewhat lengthened visit to Vienna in order to prosecute his studies  there. Since the death of Mozart, Haydn had become the most brilliant  star in the musical firmament, and it was only natural that the rising  genius should look to him for practical help and encouragement. It so  happened that the Elector's Band, of which Beethoven was a member, gave  a dinner to Haydn at Godesberg. The occasion was opportune. Beethoven  submitted a cantata to the guest of the evening which Haydn \"greatly  praised, warmly encouraging the composer to proceed with his studies.\"  The name of the cantata has not been ascertained, though Thayer  conjectures it to have been on the death of the Emperor Leopold II.    Whatever it was, the fact of Haydn's approval would make it an easy  matter to discuss the subject of lessons, whether now or later.  Beethoven did not start for Vienna until November, and it appears that  immediately before that date some formal communication had been made  with Haydn in reference to his studies. On the 29th of October Count  Waldstein wrote:    \"DEAR BEETHOVEN,--You are travelling to Vienna in fulfillment of your  long-cherished wish. The genius of Mozart is still weeping and bewailing  the death of her favourite. With the inexhaustible Haydn she found a  refuge, but no occupation, and is now waiting to leave him and join  herself to someone else. Labour assiduously, and receive Mozart's spirit  from the hands of Haydn.\"    This was not exactly complimentary to Haydn, but Beethoven doubtless had  the good sense not to repeat the count's words. When the young artist  arrived in Vienna, he found Haydn living at the Hamberger Haus, No.  992 (since demolished), and thither he went for his lessons. From  Beethoven's own notes of expenses we find that his first payment was  made to Haydn on December 12. The sum entered is 8 groschen (about  9 1/2 d.), which shows at least that Haydn was not extravagant in  his charges.    Master and Pupil    Beethoven's studies were in strict counterpoint, and the text-book was  that same \"Gradus ad Parnassum\" of Fux which Haydn had himself contended  with in the old days at St Stephen's. How many exercises Beethoven wrote  cannot be said, but 245 have been preserved, of which, according to  Nottebohm, Haydn corrected only forty-two. Much ink has been wasted in  discussing the relations of these distinguished composers. There is no  denying that Haydn neglected his young pupil, but one may find another  excuse for the neglect besides that of his increasing age and his  engrossing occupations. Beethoven was already a musical revolutionist:  Haydn was content to walk in the old ways. The two men belonged almost  to different centuries, and the disposition which the younger artist  had for \"splendid experiments\" must have seemed to the mature musician  little better than madness and licentious irregularity. \"He will never  do anything in decent style,\" was Albrechtsberger's dictum after giving  Beethoven a series of lessons.    Haydn's opinion of Beethoven's future was not so dogmatically expressed;  but he must have been sorely puzzled by a pupil who looked upon even  consecutive fifths as an open question, and thought it a good thing to  \"learn occasionally what is according to rule that one may hereafter  come to what is contrary to rule.\" It is said that Haydn persisted  in regarding Beethoven, not as a composer at all but as a pianoforte  player; and certainly Beethoven regarded Haydn as being behind the age.  That he was unjust to Haydn cannot be gainsaid. He even went so far as  to suspect Haydn of willfully trying to retard him in his studies, a  proceeding of which Haydn was altogether incapable. For many years he  continued to discharge splenetic remarks about his music, and he was  always annoyed at being called his pupil. \"I never learned anything from  Haydn,\" he would say; \"he never would correct my mistakes.\" When, the  day after the production of his ballet music to Prometheus, he met Haydn  in the street, the old man observed to him: \"I heard your music last  night; I liked it very well.\" To which Beethoven, alluding to Haydn's  oratorio, replied: \"Oh! dear master, it is far from being a CREATION.\"  The doubtful sincerity of this remark may be inferred from an anecdote  quoted by Moscheles. Haydn had been told that Beethoven was speaking  depreciatingly of \"The Creation.\" \"That is wrong of him,\" he said. \"What  has HE written, then? His Septet? Certainly that is beautiful; nay,  splendid.\"    Beethoven on Haydn    It is hardly necessary to say who comes out best in these passages  at arms. Yet we must not be too hard on Beethoven. That he recognized  Haydn's genius as a composer no careful reader of his "]]]
