The ceiling is coved, and ornamented with enormous pendants, and  the cornice above the great bay mullioned-window is enriched with a  curious design. A remarkable feature of the room is a three-sided  projection of the wall, the upper part of which is panelled, having  scooped-out niches for five seats, one in the middle and two on either  side. The banqueting-room also is a typical room of Queen Elizabeth's  time, and the \"Guest chamber\" is one of the many rooms in England which  claim the honour of inhaling the first fumes from a tobacco-pipe in  England. But Raleigh's pipe here is said to have been of solid silver;  moreover, tradition does not state that it was so rudely extinguished as  elsewhere, with a bucket of water: so, at any rate, here the story is  more dignified. To settle definitely where Sir Walter smoked his first  pipe would be as difficult a problem as to decide which was the mansion  where the bride hid herself in the oak chest, or which was King John's  favourite hunting lodge.          EASTERN AND SOUTHERN  SOMERSET      [Illustration: THE GEORGE, NORTON ST. PHILIP.]    [Illustration: THE GEORGE, NORTON ST. PHILIP.]    Somersetshire abounds in old-world villages, more particularly the  eastern division, or rather the eastern side--to the east, say, of a  line drawn from Bristol to Crewkerne. This line would intersect such  famous historic places as Wells and Glastonbury, but in our limited  space we must confine our attention more particularly to more remote  spots. One of these, for example, is the village of Norton St. Philip,  midway between Bath and Frome, which possesses one of the oldest and  most picturesque inns in England. This wonderful timber building of  projecting storeys dates mainly from the fifteenth century, although it  has been a licensed house since 1397, and upon its solid basement of  stone the \"George\" looks good for many centuries to come. It was  formerly known as the \"Old House,\" not that the other buildings at  Norton St. Philip are by any means new. It is merely, comparatively  speaking, a matter of a couple of hundred years or so.    Many are the local stories and traditions of \"Philips Norton Fight,\" for  here it was that the Duke of Monmouth's followers had the first real  experience of warfare; and the encounter with the Royalist soldiers was  a sharp one while it lasted. Monmouth's intention of attacking Bristol  had been abandoned, and during a halt at Norton on June 27, 1685, his  little army was overtaken by the king's forces under the young Duke of  Grafton, Monmouth's half-brother. The lane where fighting was briskest  used to be remembered as \"Monmouth Street,\" possibly the same steep and  narrow lane now called Bloody Lane, which winds round to the back of the  Manor Farm (some remains of which go back quite a century before  Monmouth's time), through the courtyard of which the duke marched his  regiment to attack the enemy in flank. The other end of the lane was  barricaded, so Grafton was caught in a trap, and had difficulty in  fighting his way through.    Both armies sought protection of the high hedges, which, take it all  round, got the worst of it; but Grafton lost considerably more men than  Monmouth, although a cannonade of six hours on both sides only had one  victim. An old resident living fifty years ago, whose great-grandfather  fought for \"King Monmouth,\" used to relate how the duke's field pieces  were planted by the \"Old House,\" his grace's headquarters; and the  tradition yet lingers in the inn that Colonel Holmes, on Monmouth's  side, finished the amputation of his own arm, which was shattered with a  shot, with a carving knife. Some of the ancient farmhouses between Bath  and Frome preserve some story or another in connection with \"Norton  Fight,\" and George Roberts relates in his excellent Life of Monmouth  that early in the nineteenth century the song was still sung:      \"The Duke of Monmouth is at Norton Town    All a fighting for the Crown                Ho-boys-ho.\"    There are some curious old rooms in the \"George\"; and it is astonishing  the amount of space that is occupied by the attics, the timbers of which  are enormous. Up in these dimly lighted wastes, report says that a cloth  fair was held three times a year; and one may see the shaft or well up  which the cloth was hauled from a side entrance in the street. The fair  survives in a very modified form on one of the dates, May 1st. Upon  the first floor, approached by a spiral stone staircase, is \"Monmouth's  room,\" the windows of which look up the road to Trowbridge. The open  Tudor fireplace, the oaken beams and uneven floor, carries the mind back  to the illustrious visitor who already was well aware that he was  playing a losing game, and knew what he might expect from the  unforgiving James. At the back of the old inn is the galleried yard, a  very primitive one, now almost ruinous, with rooms, leading from the  open corridors, tumbling to pieces, and floors unsafe to walk upon.  Through the gaps may be seen the cellars below, containing three huge  beer barrels, each of a thousand gallons' capacity. A fine stone  fireplace in one will make a plunge below ere very long.    But Somersetshire owns another remarkable fifteenth-century hostelry,  the \"George\" at Glastonbury, in character entirely different from that  at Norton St. Philip. The panelled and traceried Gothic stonework of the  front, with its graceful bay-window rising to the roof, is perhaps more  beautiful but not so quaint, nor has it that rugged vastness of the  other which somehow impresses us with the rough-and-tumble hospitality  of the Middle Ages. \"Ye old Pilgrimme Inn,\" as the \"George\" at  Glastonbury once was called, was built in Edward IV.'s reign, whose arms  are displayed over the entrance gateway. Here is, or was, preserved the  bedstead said to have been used by Henry VIII. when he paid a visit to  the famous abbey.    A mile or so before one gets to Norton, travelling up the main road from  Frome, there is one of those exasperating signposts which are  occasionally planted about the country. The road divides, and the sign  points directly in the middle at a house between. It says \"To Bath,\" and  that is all; and people have to ask the way to that fashionable place at  the aforesaid house. The inmate wearily came to the door. How many times  had he been asked the same question! He was driven to desperation, and  was going to invest in some black paint and a brush for his own as well  as travellers' comfort. But how much worse when there is no habitation  where to make inquiries! You are often led carefully up to a desolate  spot, and then abandoned in the most heartless fashion. The road forks,  and either there is no signpost, or the place you are nearing is not  mentioned at all. Unless your intuitive perception is beyond the  ordinary, you must either toss up for it, or sit down and wait  peacefully until some one may chance to pass by.    [Illustration: CHARTERHOUSE HINTON.]    [Illustration: WELLOW MANOR-HOUSE.]    The church and manor-house of the pretty village of Wellow, above Norton  to the north-west, are rich in oak carvings. The latter was one of the  seats of the Hungerfords, and was built in the reign of Charles I. In  the rubbish of the stable-yard, for it is now a farm, a friend of ours  picked up a spur of seventeenth-century date, which probably had lain  there since the Royalist soldiers were quartered upon their way to meet  the Monmouth rebels. Another seat of the Hungerfords was Charterhouse  Hinton Manor, to the east of Wellow, a delightful old ivy-clad dwelling,  incorporated with the remains of a thirteenth-century priory. Corsham  and Heytesbury also belonged to this important family; but their  residence for over three centuries was the now ruinous castle of  Farleigh, midway between Hinton and Norton to the east. These formidable  walls and round towers, embowered in trees and surrounded by orchards,  are romantically placed above a ravine whose beauty is somewhat marred  by a factory down by the river. The entrance gatehouse is fairly  perfect, but the clinging ivy obliterates its architectural details and  the carved escutcheon over the doorway. But were it not for this natural  protection the gatehouse would probably share the fate of one of the  round towers of the northern court, whose ivy being removed some sixty  years ago brought it down with a run. The castle chapel is full of  interest, with frescoed walls and flooring of black and white marble.  The magnificent monuments of the Hungerfords duly impress one with their  importance. The recumbent effigies of the knights and dames, with the  numerous shields of arms and their various quarterings, are quite  suggestive of a corner in Westminster Abbey, though not so dark and  dismal. Here lie the bodies of Sir Thomas, Sir Walter, and Sir Edward  Hungerford, the first of whom fought at Crecy and the last on the  Parliamentary side, when his fortress was held for the king, and  surrendered in September 1645. His successor and namesake did his best  to squander away his fortune of thirty thousand pounds a year. His  numerous mansions were sold, including the castle, and his town house  pulled down and converted into the market at Charing Cross, where his  bewigged bust was set up in 1682. His son Edward, who predeceased him  before he came to man's estate (or what was left of his father's),  married the Lady Althea Compton, who was well endowed. In the letters  preserved at Belvoir we learn that the union was without her sire's  consent. \"She went out with Mis Grey,\" writes Lady Chaworth in one of  her letters to Lord Roos, \"as to a play, but went to Sir Edward  Hungerford's,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/398"],[0,"The First Book of Adam and Eve (#18)"],[1,"us until we offer up to the Lord in their  behalf.\"    5 And Adam said no more.    6 Meanwhile Satan came to Cain in the figure of a man of the field, and  said to him, \"Behold Adam and Eve have taken counsel together about the  marriage of you two; and they have agreed to marry Abel's sister to  you, and your sister to him.    7 But if it was not that I love you, I would not have told you this  thing.  Yet if you will take my advice, and obey me, I will bring to  you on your wedding day beautiful robes, gold and silver in plenty, and  my relations will attend you.\"    8 Then Cain said with joy, \"Where are your relations?\"    9 And Satan answered, \"My relations are in a garden in the north, where  I once meant to bring your father Adam; but he would not accept my  offer.    10 But you, if you will receive my words and if you will come to me  after your wedding, you shall rest from the misery in which you are;  and you shall rest and be better off than your father Adam.\"    11 At these words of Satan Cain opened his ears, and leaned towards his  speech.    12 And he did not remain in the field, but he went to Eve, his mother,  and beat her, and cursed her, and said to her, \"Why are you planning to  take my sister to wed her to my brother?   Am I dead?\"    13 His mother, however, quieted him, and sent him to the field where he  had been.    14 Then when Adam came, she told him of what Cain had done.    15 But Adam grieved and held his peace, and said not a word.    16 Then on the next morning Adam said to Cain his son, \"Take of your  sheep, young and good, and offer them up to your God; and I will speak  to your brother, to make to his God an offering of corn.\"    17 They both obeyed their father Adam, and they took their offerings,  and offered them up on the mountain by the altar.    18 But Cain behaved haughtily towards his brother, and shoved him from  the altar, and would not let him offer up his gift on the altar; but he  offered his own on it, with a proud heart, full of guile, and fraud.    19 But as for Abel, he set up stones that were near at hand, and on  that, he offered up his gift with a heart humble and free from guile.    20 Cain was then standing by the altar on which he had offered up his  gift; and he cried to God to accept his offering; but God did not  accept it from him; neither did a divine fire come down to consume his  offering.    21 But he remained standing over against the altar, out of humor and  meanness, looking towards his brother Abel, to see if God would accept  his offering or not.    22 And Abel prayed to God to accept his offering.  Then a divine fire  came down and consumed his offering.  And God smelled the sweet savor  of his offering; because Abel loved Him and rejoice in Him.    23 And because God was well pleased with him, He sent him an angel of  light in the figure of a man who had partaken of his offering, because  He had smelled the sweet savor of his offering, and they comforted Abel  and strengthened his heart.    24 But Cain was looking on all that took place at his brother's  offering, and was angry because of it.    25 Then he opened his mouth and blasphemed God, because He had not  accepted his offering.    26 But God said to cain, \"Why do you look sad?  Be righteous, that I  may accept your offering.  Not against Me have you murmured, but  against yourself.    27 And God said this to Cain in rebuke, and because He abhorred him and  his offering.    28 And Cain came down from the altar, his color changed and with a sad  face, and came to his father and mother and told them all that had  befallen him.  And Adam grieved much because God had not accepted  Cain's offering.    29 But Abel came down rejoicing, and with a gladsome heart, and told  his father and mother how God had accepted his offering.  And they  rejoiced at it and kissed his face.    30 And Abel said to his father, \"Because Cain shoved me from the altar,  and would not allow me to offer my gift on it, I made an altar for  myself and offered my gift on it.\"    31 But when Adam heard this he was very sorry, because it was the altar  he had built at first, and on which he had offered his own gifts.    32 As to Cain, he was so resentful and so angry that he went into the  field, where Satan came to him and said to him, \"Since your brother  Abel has taken refuge with your father Adam, because you shoved him  from the altar, they have kissed his face, and they rejoice over him,  far more than over you.\"    33 When Cain heard these words of  Satan, he was filled with rage; and  he let no one know.  But he was laying wait to kill his brother, until  he brought him into the cave, and then said to him:--    34 \"O brother, the country is so beautiful, and there are such  beautiful and pleasurable trees in it, and charming to look at!  But  brother, you have never been one day in the field to take your pleasure  in that place.    35 Today, O, my brother, I very much wish you would come with me into  the field, to enjoy yourself and to bless our fields and our flocks,  for you are righteous, and I love you much, O my brother!  But you have  alienated yourself from me.\"    36 Then Abel consented to go with his brother Cain into the field.    37 But before going out, Cain said to Abel, \"Wait for me, until I fetch  a staff, because of wild beasts.\"    38 Then Abel stood waiting in his innocence.  But Cain, the forward,  fetched a staff and went out.    39 And they began, Cain and his brother Abel, to walk in the way; Cain  talking to him, and comforting him, to make him forget everything.          Chapter LXXIX - A wicked plan is carried to a tragic conclusion.  Cain  is frightened.  \"Am I my brother's keeper?\" The seven punishments.  Peace is shattered.    1 And so they went on, until they came to a lonely place, where there  were no sheep; then Abel said to Cain, \"Behold, my brother, we are  tired from walking; for we see none of the trees, nor of the fruits,  nor of the flourishing green plants, nor of the sheep, nor any one of  the things of which you told me.  Where are those sheep of thine you  told me to bless?\"    2 Then Cain said to him, \"Come on, and you shall see many beautiful  things very soon, but go before me, until I catch up to you.\"    3 Then went Abel forward, but Cain remained behind him.    4 And Abel was walking in his innocence, without guile; not believing  his brother would kill him.    5 Then Cain, when he came up to him, comforted him with his talk,  walking a little behind him; then he ran up to him and beat him with  the staff, blow after blow, until he was stunned.    6 But when Abel fell down on the ground, seeing that his brother meant  to kill him, he said to Cain, \"O, my brother, have pity on me.  By the  breasts we have sucked, don't hit me!  By the womb that bore us and  that brought us into the world, don't beat me to death with that staff!  If you will kill me, take one of these large stones and kill me  outright.\"    7 Then Cain, the hard-hearted, and cruel murderer, took a large stone,  and beat his brother's head with it, until his brains oozed out, and he  wallowed in his blood, before him.    8 And Cain repented not of what he had done.    9 But the earth, when the blood of righteous Abel fell on it, trembled,  as it drank his blood, and would have destroyed Cain because of it.    10 And the blood of Abel cried mysteriously to God, to avenge him of  his murderer.    11 Then Cain began at once to dig the ground wherein to lay his  brother; for he was trembling from the fear that came over him, when he  saw the earth tremble on his account.    12 He then cast his brother into the pit he made, and covered him with  dust.  But the ground would not receive him; but it threw him up at  once.    13 Again Cain dug the ground and hid his brother in it; but again the  ground threw him up on itself; until three times the ground thus threw  up on itself the body of Abel.    14 The muddy ground threw him up the first time, because he was not the  first creation; and it threw him up the second time and would not  receive him, because he was righteous and good, and was killed without  a cause; and the ground threw him up the third time and would not  receive him, that there might remain before his brother a witness  against him.    15 And so the earth mocked Cain, until the Word of God, came to him  concerning his brother.    16 Then was God angry, and much displeased at Abel's death; and He  thundered from heaven, and lightnings went before Him, and the Word of  the Lord God came from heaven to Cain, and said to him, \"Where is Abel  your brother?\"    17 Then Cain answered with a proud heart and a gruff voice, \"How, O  God?  Am I my brother's keeper?\"    18 Then God said to Cain, \"Cursed be the earth that has drunk the blood  of Abel your brother; and as for you, you will always be trembling and  shaking; and this will be a mark on you so that whoever finds you, will  kill you.\"    19 But Cain cried because God had said those words to him; and Cain  said to Him, \"O God, whosoever finds me shall kill me, and I shall be  blotted out from the face of the earth.\"    20 Then God said to Cain, \"Whoever finds you will not kill you;\"  because before this, God had been saying to Cain, \"I shall put seven  punishments on anyone that kills Cain.\" For as to the word of God to  Cain, \"Where is your brother?\" God said it in mercy for him, to try and  make him repent.    21 For if Cain had repented at that time, and had said, \"O God, forgive  me my sin, and the murder of my brother,\"  God would then have forgiven  him his sin.    22 And as to God saying to Cain, \"Cursed be the ground that has drunk  the blood of your brother.\"  That also, was God's mercy on Cain.  For  God did not curse him, but He cursed the ground; although it was not  the ground that had killed Abel, and committed a wicked sin.    23 For it was fitting that the curse should fall on the murderer; yet  in mercy did God so manage"]]]
