[14] By the old English law, no bull beef could be sold unless          the bull had been baited.    Marshall, who touches very slightly on the subject, says, \"The flesh  of sheep when slaughtered is well known to be of various qualities:  some is composed of large coarse grains, interspersed with wide empty  pores, like a sponge; others of large grains, with wide pores filled  with fat; others of fine close grains with smaller pores filled with  fat; and a fourth of close grains without any mixture of fatness. The  flesh of sheep when dressed is equally well known to possess a variety  of qualities: some mutton is coarse, dry, and insipid,--a dry sponge  affording little or no gravy of any colour. Another sort is somewhat  firmer, imparting a light-coloured gravy only. A third plump, short,  and palatable, affording a mixture of white and red gravy. A fourth  likewise plump, and well-flavoured, but discharging red gravy only,  and this in various quantities. It is likewise observable that some  mutton, when dressed, appears covered with a thick, tough,  parchment-like integument; others with a membrane comparatively fine  and flexible.\" This membrane ought to be rather thin than thick, as,  when of the latter texture, you may safely affirm that the animal was  aged. _Looseness_ is reckoned a bad quality of the flesh of sheep  during life, as indicating a coarse-grained porous mutton, and as  equally exceptionable with that of _hardness_: while _mellowness_, and  firmness, are much to be desired, as forming a happy mixture, deemed  by some the point of perfection. The tendency to become fat at an  early age, though a valuable one in some points, is not so in others.  Premature decay is always the result, showing with certainty that a  healthy action has not been going on. An animal when _loaded_ with fat  cannot be looked upon otherwise than as in a diseased state, and  liable to embarassment of many organs, especially of the heart and  brain. Sudden death on any hurried exertion is far from rare, and  life, from the difficulty of enjoying it, is any thing but desirable.    (82.) _Abuses in Feeding._--The custom of over-feeding was carried to  an absurd extent on the promulgation of Bakewell's method, nothing  less being aspired to than the glory of laying seven or eight inches  of fat on the ribs of sheep. This folly however had its day: the  ridiculous parts of the system have to a great extent disappeared,  while attention to the production of an increased quantity of mutton,  without too great an abundance of fat, has remained to prove to the  world the value of the benefits which the English farmer conferred  upon his country. Overgrown sheep are indeed good for nothing \"save\"  in the words of Meg Dods, \"to obtain premiums at cattle shows, and  deluge dripping-pans with liquid fat;\" and in this every one will  agree, excepting always boarding-school cooks, and others who depend  for their principal perquisites on the over-roasting of oily meat! The  fat, though not reckoned as offal in the slaughter-house, will  speedily show itself as such in the kitchen, by the waste during the  cooking process, even in England where fat meat is so much admired;  and it is surely absurd to pay the price of good mutton for tallow,  when if the latter were really wanted, it could be procured at a  cheaper rate by itself, than when forming part of a dear commodity.  The only way in which over-fat meat can at all be reckoned profitable,  is in its application to the wants of the working classes, whose  bodily labour enables them to enjoy what would to others prove  displeasing in the extreme, and to digest and assimilate with ease,  food which to the sons of sloth would prove a poison. So far as these  wants have been supplied, the attempt of Bakewell has been attended  with the happiest results, as he and his disciples have placed by  their well-spent exertions much good food within the reach of the  poorer classes, which they must otherwise have gone without; while in  many instances it has driven bacon from the market, being a cheaper  and more palatable commodity, which cannot but contribute to the  health of the people, seeing the continued use of salted meat is  calculated to injure the body, and render it liable to many diseases.  Marshall remarks, that fat, like charity, covers a multitude of  faults: and he is right, for an ill-shaped animal if well fed, has all  its angles speedily effaced, and if its ugliness has not amounted to  absolute deformity, it acquires that rotundity of contour so pleasing  to the eye, and so apt to mislead us.    The rapidity is various with which animals take on fat, much depending  on hereditary predisposition, and the nature of the food; and much  also on the state of the atmosphere, and quiet habits; a moist and  rather warm air tending greatly to the advancement of the process,  some birds becoming fat in twenty-four hours of wet weather. Children  that have been emaciated by diseases often resume their original plump  condition in a few days; and animals that have been famished, as hogs,  afterwards fatten very rapidly. Moderate and repeated bleedings, mild  farinaceous diet, and emasculation conjoined, tend to the repletion of  the body, and to the speedy deposition of fat; yet it would appear,  that when acquired in this rapid manner, it never possesses the value  in a culinary point of view, that is yielded to such as has been  slowly formed, when, as one may say, the worthless particles have had  time to be removed, and the remaining part to become a firm and  healthy deposit. It is partly owing to this, that animals are never at  their best when forced to take on fat at an early age, but are most  esteemed by the gourmand when they, as in the case of the sheep, have  lived from three to four years.    (83.) _Tendency to acquire Fat._--A disposition to early obesity, as  well as a tendency to that form which indicates a propensity to  fatten, is materially promoted by a good supply of rich food, while  the animal is in a growing state. The Spanish shepherds are so well  aware of this, that half of the lambs are annually killed, that the  survivors may obtain every indulgence in the way of milk. Care should  be taken never to place animals suddenly on food much superior in  feeding qualities to what they have left. Very lean sheep are never  put to full turnips in winter, nor to rich pastures in summer, but are  prepared for turnips on good grass lands, and kept on second years'  leys, and afterwards given a moderate allowance of turnips if they are  to be fatted on pastures. It is an invariable rule with all good  managers, never to allow this or any other animal, reared solely for  the shambles, to lose flesh from its earliest age till it is sent to  the butcher as more food is necessary to bring it to a certain  condition than to keep it at it. In the case of the Dishleys, it is  customary to keep all in a state of fatness, except those intended for  breeding, and after full feeding on turnips during winter and spring,  to finish them on the first year's clover early in summer, when the  prices of meat are usually the highest; so that this variety is always  fit for market at eighteen months, while the Highland breeds, though  prepared by means of turnips, a year at least, sooner than in former  times, do not usually go to the shambles till from three to four years  old.    (84.) _Frequent change of Pasture necessary._--Sheep ought never to be  permitted to remain too long on one pasture:--Great benefit will be  derived from their removal from time to time to different parts even  of the same farm, by which arrangement a change of herbage will be  ensured. No animal can be kept for any length of time in health, if  restricted to one unvarying routine of diet. This has been  satisfactorily proved by the experiments of Majendie, who found that  health could not be sustained on one or even two kinds of food beyond  the thirtieth day. Now, though such immediate injury cannot result to  a flock from retention on a particular pasture, owing to the variety  of sustenance being considerable, yet proportional harm will ensue  sufficient to induce us not to repeat the risk. Nature, the best of  guides in all that relates to the protection of her creatures, is no  where more pointed in her directions than on this head. A necessity  for a variety of food, and a desire to secure it, are implanted in the  disposition of every animal; and where is the creature more prone to  extensive rambles than the sheep? We limit it to a paltry  pasture-ground of roods and acres, but does it not show, by its  determination to transgress our barriers, that such is not the  treatment nature has designed for it? There is something more than  wildness of character, and restless disposition, in the powerful  attempts it continually makes to defy our artificial boundaries. There  is in these efforts a longing for fresh fields and other herbage, an  instinctive feeling that all is not as it ought to be; and yet we  attend not to the hint! Nothing will conduce so much to the health of  the sheep, and to the speedy taking on of fat, as the frequent  shifting of the flock. Disease will doubtless still affect the  animals, but illness will be rare, and mortality diminished, if by the  care of their rulers, they are enabled to obtain what instinct tells  them is the best of medicine.    (85.) _Varieties induced by apparently trivial causes._--Surrounded in  a civilized state, by all that can minister to the supply of wants,  whether real or supposed, man is not on that account to be imagined as  always so situated. Look to savage nations, and remark their destitute  condition, their dependence on the uncertain proceeds of the chase,  and their "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3819"],[0,"The Euahlayi Tribe: A Study of Aboriginal Life in Australia (#18)"],[1,"know his spirit is in you.    For this is the sign,    A front tooth gone.    That is his sign,    He will know you by it.    Some of the wirreenuns buried these teeth by the Boorah fire, others  carefully wrapped them up to keep as charms, or to send to other  tribes, each according to the individual custom of his tribe.    This all over, once more there was a marching and chanting round the  fire, then the boys were taken away and given food for the first time  since they left their mothers.    No wonder that the 'supernatural' was mixed up with their impressions  of the Boorah: fasting nourishes hallucinations. While the boys were  eating, they could hear in the distance other chants, and knew that  ceremonies were going on to which they were not yet to be admitted,  there being degrees of initiation.    On the fourth day the men took them about ten miles, and camped with  them where they could hear faintly in the distance the noise of the  main camp; so they knew they were near the place chosen for the  Durramunga, or Little Boorah.    Just before dawn next morning each Munthdeegun took his Boorahbayyi, or  partially initiated one, to the Durramunga. There was a Boorah ring,  but instead of earth grass was heaped all round it. No young women were  visible, only the old women, who sang and corroboreed towards the boys.  Slowly they came forward, peered at their shoulders, and seeing there  the marks, embraced them, shrieking out cries of joy that their boys  had borne the tests. They danced round them, then at a sign from the  old men embraced them again; and while, the women sang their brumboorah  and danced, the boys were taken away by their guardians.    For two moons they remained away, learning much as to sacred things.  They were told that the oldest wirreenuns could see in their sacred  crystals pictures of the past, pictures of what was happening at a  distance in the present, and pictures of the future; some of which last  filled their minds with dread, for they said as time went on the  colours of the blacks, as seen in these magical stones, seemed to grow  paler and paler, until at last only the white faces of the Wundah, or  spirits of the dead, and white devils were seen, as if it should mean  that some day no more blacks should be on this earth.    The reason of this must surely be that the tribes fell away from the  Boorah rites, and in his wrath Byamee stirred from his crystal seat in  Bullimah. He had said that as long as the blacks kept his sacred laws,  so long should he stay in his crystal seat, and the blacks live on  earth; but if they failed to keep up the Boorah rites as he had taught  them, then he would move and their end would come, and only Wundah, or  white devils, be in their country.    It is said that this prophetic vision was the reason that so many of  the first-born half-caste babies were killed, the old wirreenuns seeing  in them the beginning of the end.    At the end of two moons they make back towards the place where the  Boorah had begun, and where preparations were now being made to receive  them.    They camped in the scrub near the old camp of the tribe who had started  the Boorah.    That night in the camp the Gayandi was heard again, another ceremony  was at hand.    The next day the women at the big camp made a big fire, a little  distance away. When this fire was nearly burnt out they covered it  thickly with Budtha, Dheal, and Coolabah leaves to make a great smoke.  On the top of these leaves, which were piled about two feet high, logs  were placed; this fire was round a Dheal tree.    When the thick smoke was seen curling up in a column, the Boorahbayyi  were brought out of the scrub by the Munthdeegun, while in the distance  sounded the whizzing voice of the Boorah spirit. As it ceased, when the  women's chanting rose above it, the painted boys came into the open. On  they came, heads down and hands on thighs, looking neither to the right  nor to the left, but walking straight ahead until they stood on the  logs on the fire. They leaned over and placed a hand each on the tree  in the centre, there they stood while the smoke curled all round them.  The women past child-bearing were singing all the time, while the men  danced outside the leaf-smoke, clicking boomerangs as they did so.    For some time this went on, then the men took the boys back into the  scrub.    In about four moons' time another leaf-smoke was made ready, and the  Boorahbayyi were again brought out and smoked. This time while chanting  a song the old women brought a big net and put it right over the boys.  Then they stepped back and danced round to the clicking of boomerangs  by the men. The boys were again taken away.    But after this they were allowed to camp nearer the general camp,  though they held no intercourse with the people of it. I have often met  these Boorah boys in the bush, and on sighting me they have fled as if  I were a devil in petticoats.    In about another moon's time, the boys were painted principally white,  a waywah put on them, a yunbean--a piece of beefwood gum with two  kangaroo teeth stuck in it, and a hole through it--was tied to their  front lock of hair. A number of these yunbean were tied to forehead  bands, which they wore too. Armlets of opossum's hair string were put  on their arms, and feathers stuck in them. Feathers were also stuck  upright in the forehead bands.    Some of the old men added to their own decorations by putting on  wongins, from which were hanging those most precious possessions to  inland blacks--seaside shells. Some had fresh beads of gum fastened on  to their hair, hanging round their heads in dozens.    The women, too, had coiffured themselves with fresh gum beads; the  mothers of the Boorahbayyi were painted, too, in corroboree style. They  had made a smoke fire, but the logs instead of being put on it, were  placed at a little distance; on these the painted boys sat, the smoke  enveloping them.    After they had been seated there some time, their mothers came up  behind them, and put their hands on their sons' shoulders. Then they  rubbed all the paint off the boys' bodies; the boys never once looking  at them. When the paint was all off, the women sang and danced, until  the men in charge took the boys away again.    After this, supervision was relaxed except at night. During the  day-time the boys might wander at will, so as they kept clear of the  general camp. They might not receive food from nor speak to a woman for  twelve months, as if they were monks of Byamee in training.    At his second Boorah a young man was allowed to see the sacred fire  ceremony, throwing in of weapons, walking on burning coals, and the  rest. He saw the huge earthen figures of Byamee, Birrahgnooloo, and  Baillahburrah, or Dillalee, and was told all about them; that Byamee  having initiated the Boorah, only such as have been through its rites  can go to his sky-camp.    Three sins are unforgiveable, and commit a spirit of a guilty one to  continual movement in the lower world of the Eleanbah Wundah, where,  but for big fires kept up, would be darkness.    There the guilty one had to keep his right hand at his side, never  moving it, but he himself perpetually moving. Those who know the blacks  and their love of a 'dolce far niente,' will understand what a  veritable hell this perpetual movement would make.    The three deadly sins were unprovoked murder, lying to the elders of  the tribe, or stealing a woman within the forbidden degrees--that is,  of the same hereditary totem, i.e. of the same blood, or of the  prohibited family name clan.    But by a curious train of reasoning two wrongs make a right. Should by  any chance a man succeed in getting a wife he had no right to, having  lived with her, he could keep her, if he came unhurt from the trial he  had to stand; he only having a shield to defend himself with, the men  of the stolen woman's kin threw weapons at him. Only the men of her kin  are assailants, not as in a murder trial, when the men of all kins can  throw at the guilty man. Should he defend himself successfully, he can  keep the woman on the understanding that a woman of his family is given  to a man of hers, to square things. A man who stands his trial is  called a Booreenbayyi.    Kindliness towards the old and sick is strictly inculcated as a command  of Byamee, to whom all breaches of his laws are reported by the  all-seeing spirit at a man's death, and he is judged accordingly. Sir  Thomas Mitchell, writing in 1837 his experiences of the blacks during  his explorations, notices as very striking their care and affection for  the aged of their race.    At his second Boorah a man is allowed to see the carvings on the trees  and to hear the legends of them. Also to hear the Boorah song of  Byamee, which Byamee himself sang; and to hear the prayer of the oldest  wirreenun to Byamee, asking him to let the blacks live long, for they  have been faithful to his charge as shown by the observance of the  Boorah ceremony.    The old wirreenun says words to this effect several times imploringly,  his head turned to the east; facing this direction the dead are mostly  buried.    Though we say that actually these people have but two attempts at  prayers, one at the grave and one at the inner Boorah ring, I think  perhaps we are wrong. These two seem the only ones directly addressed  to Byamee. But perhaps it is his indirect aid which is otherwise  invoked. Daily set prayers seem to them a foolishness and an insult,  rather than otherwise, to Byamee. He knows; why weary him by  repetition, disturbing the rest he enjoys after his earth labours? But  a prayer need not necessarily be addressed to the highest god. I think  if we really understood and appreciated the mental attitude of the  blacks, we should find more in their so-called incantations of the  nature of invocations.
