Meanwhile dictate and I will write.'    \"Never was there a more docile literary lady than my friend. Without a  word of objection she followed my request.    \"'I am ready to write,' said I. 'The last sentence was: \"What is this  life to one who has suffered as I have?\" What next?'    \"'Shall I put in the brown or the white bread first?' said Mina.    \"'The brown first,' said Harriet.    \"'\"What is this life to one who has suffered as I have?\"' said I.    \"Harriet brushed the flour off her apron and sat down for a moment in a  muse. Then she dictated as follows:--    \"'\"Under the breaking of my heart I have borne up. I have borne up  under all that tries a woman,--but this thought,--oh, Henry!\"'    \"'Ma'am, shall I put ginger into this pumpkin?' queried Mina.    \"'No, you may let that alone just now,' replied Harriet. She then  proceeded:--    \"'\"I know my duty to my children. I see the hour must come. You must  take them, Henry; they are my last earthly comfort.\"'    \"'Ma'am, what shall I do with these egg-shells and all this truck  here?' interrupted Mina.    \"'Put them in the pail by you,' answered Harriet.    \"'\"They are my last earthly comfort,\"' said I. 'What next?'    \"She continued to dictate,--    \"'\"You must take them away. It may be--perhaps it _must_ be--that I  shall soon follow, but the breaking heart of a wife still pleads, 'a  little longer, a little longer.'\"'    \"'How much longer must the gingerbread stay in?' inquired Mina.    \"'Five minutes,' said Harriet.    \"'\"A little longer, a little longer,\"' I repeated in a dolorous tone,  and we burst into a laugh.    \"Thus we went on, cooking, writing, nursing, and laughing, till I  finally accomplished my object. The piece was finished, copied, and the  next day sent to the editor.\"    The widely scattered members of the Beecher family had a fashion of  communicating with each other by means of circular letters. These,  begun on great sheets of paper, at either end of the line, were passed  along from one to another, each one adding his or her budget of news  to the general stock. When the filled sheet reached the last person  for whom it was intended, it was finally remailed to its point of  departure. Except in the cases of Mrs. Stowe and Mrs. Perkins, the  simple address \"Rev. Mr. Beecher\" was sufficient to insure its safe  delivery in any town to which it was sent.    One of these great, closely-written sheets, bearing in faded ink the  names of all the Beechers, lies outspread before us as we write. It  is postmarked Hartford, Conn., Batavia, N. Y., Chillicothe, Ohio,  Zanesville, Ohio, Walnut Hills, Ohio, Indianapolis, Ind., Jacksonville,  Ill., and New Orleans, La. In it Mrs. Stowe occupies her allotted space  with--                                 WALNUT HILLS, _April 27, 1839._        DEAR FRIENDS,--I am going to Hartford myself, and      therefore shall not write, but hurry along the      preparations for my forward journey. Belle, father says      you may go to the White Mountains with Mr. Stowe and me      this summer. George, we may look in on you coming back.      Good-by.        Affectionately to all,                  H. E. STOWE.    FOOTNOTES:    [2] A ridiculous book from which Mr. Stowe derived endless amusement.    [3] Salmon P. Chase.          CHAPTER V.    POVERTY AND SICKNESS, 1840-1850.

ON January 7, 1839, Professor Stowe wrote to his mother in Natick,  Mass.: \"You left here, I believe, in the right time, for as there has  been no navigation on the Ohio River for a year, we are almost in a  state of famine as to many of the necessities of life. For example,  salt (coarse) has sold in Cincinnati this winter for three dollars a  bushel; rice eighteen cents a pound; coffee fifty cents a pound; white  sugar the same; brown sugar twenty cents; molasses a dollar a gallon;  potatoes a dollar a bushel. We do without such things mostly; as there  is yet plenty of bread and bacon (flour six and seven dollars a barrel,  and good pork from six to eight cents a pound) we get along very  comfortably.    \"Our new house is pretty much as it was, but they say it will be  finished in July. I expect to visit you next summer, as I shall deliver  the Phi Beta Kappa oration at Dartmouth College; but whether wife and  children come with me or not is not yet decided.\"    Mrs. Stowe came on to the East with her husband and children during  the following summer, and before her return made a trip through the  White Mountains.    In May, 1840, her second son was born and named Frederick William,  after the sturdy Prussian king, for whom her husband cherished an  unbounded admiration.    Mrs. Stowe has said somewhere: \"So we go, dear reader, so long as we  have a body and a soul. For worlds must mingle,--the great and the  little, the solemn and the trivial, wreathing in and out like the  grotesque carvings on a gothic shrine; only did we know it rightly,  nothing is trivial, since the human soul, with its awful shadow, makes  all things sacred.\" So in writing a biography it is impossible for us  to tell what did and what did not powerfully influence the character.  It is safer simply to tell the unvarnished truth. The lily builds up  its texture of delicate beauty from mould and decay. So how do we know  from what humble material a soul grows in strength and beauty!    In December, 1840, writing to Miss May, Mrs. Stowe says:--    \"For a year I have held the pen only to write an occasional business  letter such as could not be neglected. This was primarily owing to a  severe neuralgic complaint that settled in my eyes, and for two months  not only made it impossible for me to use them in writing, but to fix  them with attention on anything. I could not even bear the least light  of day in my room. Then my dear little Frederick was born, and for two  months more I was confined to my bed. Besides all this, we have had an  unusual amount of sickness in our family....    \"For all that my history of the past year records so many troubles, I  cannot on the whole regard it as a very troublous one. I have had so  many counterbalancing mercies that I must regard myself as a person  greatly blessed. It is true that about six months out of the twelve I  have been laid up with sickness, but then I have had every comfort and  the kindest of nurses in my faithful Anna. My children have thriven,  and on the whole 'come to more,' as the Yankees say, than the care of  them. Thus you see my troubles have been but enough to keep me from  loving earth too well.\"    In the spring of 1842 Mrs. Stowe again visited Hartford, taking her  six-year-old daughter Hatty with her. In writing from there to her  husband she confides some of her literary plans and aspirations to him,  and he answers:--    \"My dear, you must be a literary woman. It is so written in the book  of fate. Make all your calculations accordingly. Get a good stock of  health and brush up your mind. Drop the E. out of your name. It only  incumbers it and interferes with the flow and euphony. Write yourself  fully and always Harriet Beecher Stowe, which is a name euphonious,  flowing, and full of meaning. Then my word for it, your husband will  lift up his head in the gate, and your children will rise up and call  you blessed.    \"Our humble dwelling has to-day received a distinguished honor of which  I must give you an account. It was a visit from his excellency the  Baron de Roenne, ambassador of his majesty the King of Prussia to the  United States. He was pleased to assure me of the great satisfaction  my report on Prussian schools had afforded the king and members of  his court, with much more to the same effect. Of course having a real  live lord to exhibit, I was anxious for some one to exhibit him to; but  neither Aunt Esther nor Anna dared venture near the study, though they  both contrived to get a peep at his lordship from the little chamber  window as he was leaving.    \"And now, my dear wife, I want you to come home as quick as you can.  The fact is I cannot live without you, and if we were not so prodigious  poor I would come for you at once. There is no woman like you in this  wide world. Who else has so much talent with so little self-conceit;  so much reputation with so little affectation; so much literature with  so little nonsense; so much enterprise with so little extravagance;  so much tongue with so little scold; so much sweetness with so little  softness; so much of so many things and so little of so many other  things?\"    In answer to this letter Mrs. Stowe writes from Hartford:--    \"I have seen Johnson of the 'Evangelist.' He is very liberally  disposed, and I may safely reckon on being paid for all I do there. Who  is that Hale, Jr., that sent me the 'Boston Miscellany,' and will he  keep his word with me? His offers are very liberal,--twenty dollars for  three pages, not very close print. Is he to be depended on? If so, it  is the best offer I have received yet. I shall get something from the  Harpers some time this winter or spring. Robertson, the publisher here,  says the book ('The Mayflower') will sell, and though the terms they  offer me are very low, that I shall make something on it. For a second  volume I shall be able to make better terms. On the whole, my dear, if  I choose to be a literary lady, I have, I think, as good a chance of  making profit by it as any one I know of. But with all this, I have my  doubts whether I shall be able to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6753"],[0,"Psmith in the City (#18)"],[1,"to say. Whereas Psmith gave him the  impression of looking forward to the thing as a treat.           *       *       *       *       *    The house where Mr Waller lived was one of a row of semi-detached  villas on the north side of the Common. The door was opened to them by  their host himself. So far from looking battered and emitting last  breaths, he appeared particularly spruce. He had just returned from  Church, and was still wearing his gloves and tall hat. He squeaked with  surprise when he saw who were standing on the mat.    'Why, dear me, dear me,' he said. 'Here you are! I have been wondering  what had happened to you. I was afraid that you might have been  seriously hurt. I was afraid those ruffians might have injured you.  When last I saw you, you were being--'    'Chivvied,' interposed Psmith, with dignified melancholy. 'Do not let  us try to wrap the fact up in pleasant words. We were being chivvied.  We were legging it with the infuriated mob at our heels. An ignominious  position for a Shropshire Psmith, but, after all, Napoleon did the  same.'    'But what happened? I could not see. I only know that quite suddenly  the people seemed to stop listening to me, and all gathered round you  and Jackson. And then I saw that Jackson was engaged in a fight with a  young man.'    'Comrade Jackson, I imagine, having heard a great deal about all men  being equal, was anxious to test the theory, and see whether Comrade  Bill was as good a man as he was. The experiment was broken off  prematurely, but I personally should be inclined to say that Comrade  Jackson had a shade the better of the exchanges.'    Mr Waller looked with interest at Mike, who shuffled and felt awkward.  He was hoping that Psmith would say nothing about the reason of his  engaging Bill in combat. He had an uneasy feeling that Mr Waller's  gratitude would be effusive and overpowering, and he did not wish to  pose as the brave young hero. There are moments when one does not feel  equal to the _role_.    Fortunately, before Mr Waller had time to ask any further questions,  the supper-bell sounded, and they went into the dining-room.    Sunday supper, unless done on a large and informal scale, is probably  the most depressing meal in existence. There is a chill discomfort in  the round of beef, an icy severity about the open jam tart. The  blancmange shivers miserably.    Spirituous liquor helps to counteract the influence of these things,  and so does exhilarating conversation. Unfortunately, at Mr Waller's  table there was neither. The cashier's views on temperance were not  merely for the platform; they extended to the home. And the company was  not of the exhilarating sort. Besides Psmith and Mike and their host,  there were four people present--Comrade Prebble, the orator; a young  man of the name of Richards; Mr Waller's niece, answering to the name  of Ada, who was engaged to Mr Richards; and Edward.    Edward was Mr Waller's son. He was ten years old, wore a very tight  Eton suit, and had the peculiarly loathsome expression which a snub  nose sometimes gives to the young.    It would have been plain to the most casual observer that Mr Waller was  fond and proud of his son. The cashier was a widower, and after five  minutes' acquaintance with Edward, Mike felt strongly that Mrs Waller  was the lucky one. Edward sat next to Mike, and showed a tendency to  concentrate his conversation on him. Psmith, at the opposite end of the  table, beamed in a fatherly manner upon the pair through his eyeglass.    Mike got on with small girls reasonably well. He preferred them at a  distance, but, if cornered by them, could put up a fairly good show.  Small boys, however, filled him with a sort of frozen horror. It was  his view that a boy should not be exhibited publicly until he reached  an age when he might be in the running for some sort of colours at a  public school.    Edward was one of those well-informed small boys. He opened on Mike  with the first mouthful.    'Do you know the principal exports of Marseilles?' he inquired.    'What?' said Mike coldly.    'Do you know the principal exports of Marseilles? I do.'    'Oh?' said Mike.    'Yes. Do you know the capital of Madagascar?'    Mike, as crimson as the beef he was attacking, said he did not.    'I do.'    'Oh?' said Mike.    'Who was the first king--'    'You mustn't worry Mr Jackson, Teddy,' said Mr Waller, with a touch of  pride in his voice, as who should say 'There are not many boys of his  age, I can tell you, who _could_ worry you with questions like  that.'    'No, no, he likes it,' said Psmith, unnecessarily. 'He likes it. I  always hold that much may be learned by casual chit-chat across the  dinner-table. I owe much of my own grasp of--'    'I bet _you_ don't know what's the capital of Madagascar,'  interrupted Mike rudely.    'I do,' said Edward. 'I can tell you the kings of Israel?' he added,  turning to Mike. He seemed to have no curiosity as to the extent of  Psmith's knowledge. Mike's appeared to fascinate him.    Mike helped himself to beetroot in moody silence.    His mouth was full when Comrade Prebble asked him a question. Comrade  Prebble, as has been pointed out in an earlier part of the narrative,  was a good chap, but had no roof to his mouth.    'I beg your pardon?' said Mike.    Comrade Prebble repeated his observation. Mike looked helplessly at  Psmith, but Psmith's eyes were on his plate.    Mike felt he must venture on some answer.    'No,' he said decidedly.    Comrade Prebble seemed slightly taken aback. There was an awkward  pause. Then Mr Waller, for whom his fellow Socialist's methods of  conversation held no mysteries, interpreted.    'The mustard, Prebble? Yes, yes. Would you mind passing Prebble the  mustard, Mr Jackson?'    'Oh, sorry,' gasped Mike, and, reaching out, upset the water-jug into  the open jam-tart.    Through the black mist which rose before his eyes as he leaped to his  feet and stammered apologies came the dispassionate voice of Master  Edward Waller reminding him that mustard was first introduced into Peru  by Cortez.    His host was all courtesy and consideration. He passed the matter off  genially. But life can never be quite the same after you have upset a  water-jug into an open jam-tart at the table of a comparative stranger.  Mike's nerve had gone. He ate on, but he was a broken man.    At the other end of the table it became gradually apparent that things  were not going on altogether as they should have done. There was a sort  of bleakness in the atmosphere. Young Mr Richards was looking like a  stuffed fish, and the face of Mr Waller's niece was cold and set.    'Why, come, come, Ada,' said Mr Waller, breezily, 'what's the matter?  You're eating nothing. What's George been saying to you?' he added  jocularly.    'Thank you, uncle Robert,' replied Ada precisely, 'there's nothing the  matter. Nothing that Mr Richards can say to me can upset me.'    'Mr Richards!' echoed Mr Waller in astonishment. How was he to know  that, during the walk back from church, the world had been transformed,  George had become Mr Richards, and all was over?    'I assure you, Ada--' began that unfortunate young man. Ada turned a  frigid shoulder towards him.    'Come, come,' said Mr Waller disturbed. 'What's all this? What's all  this?'    His niece burst into tears and left the room.    If there is anything more embarrassing to a guest than a family row, we  have yet to hear of it. Mike, scarlet to the extreme edges of his ears,  concentrated himself on his plate. Comrade Prebble made a great many  remarks, which were probably illuminating, if they could have been  understood. Mr Waller looked, astonished, at Mr Richards. Mr Richards,  pink but dogged, loosened his collar, but said nothing. Psmith, leaning  forward, asked Master Edward Waller his opinion on the Licensing Bill.    'We happened to have a word or two,' said Mr Richards at length, 'on  the way home from church on the subject of Women's Suffrage.'    'That fatal topic!' murmured Psmith.    'In Australia--' began Master Edward Waller.    'I was rayther--well, rayther facetious about it,' continued Mr  Richards.    Psmith clicked his tongue sympathetically.    'In Australia--' said Edward.    'I went talking on, laughing and joking, when all of a sudden she flew  out at me. How was I to know she was 'eart and soul in the movement?  You never told me,' he added accusingly to his host.    'In Australia--' said Edward.    'I'll go and try and get her round. How was I to know?'    Mr Richards thrust back his chair and bounded from the room.    'Now, iawinyaw, iear oiler--' said Comrade Prebble judicially, but was  interrupted.    'How very disturbing!' said Mr Waller. 'I am so sorry that this should  have happened. Ada is such a touchy, sensitive girl. She--'    'In Australia,' said Edward in even tones, 'they've _got_ Women's  Suffrage already. Did _you_ know that?' he said to Mike.    Mike made no answer. His eyes were fixed on his plate. A bead of  perspiration began to roll down his forehead. If his feelings could  have been ascertained at that moment, they would have been summed up in  the words, 'Death, where is thy sting?'          18. Psmith Makes a Discovery      'Women,' said Psmith, helping himself to trifle, and speaking with the  air of one launched upon his special subject, 'are, one must recollect,  like--like--er, well, in fact, just so. Passing on lightly from that  conclusion, let us turn for a moment to the Rights of Property, in  connection with which Comrade Prebble and yourself had so much that was  interesting to say this afternoon. Perhaps you'--he bowed in Comrade  Prebble's direction--'would resume, for the benefit of Comrade Jackson--a  novice in the Cause, but earnest--your very lucid--'    Comrade Prebble beamed, and took the floor. Mike began to realize that,  till now, he had never known what boredom meant. There had been moments  in his life which"]]]
