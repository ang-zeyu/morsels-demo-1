[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5157"],[0,"How I Found Livingstone (#18)"],[1,"the town is about half a square mile, its plan  being quadrangular. Well-built towers of stone guard each corner; four  gates, one facing each cardinal point, and set half way between the  several towers, permit ingress and egress for its inhabitants. The gates  are closed with solid square doors made of African teak, and carved  with the infinitesimally fine and complicated devices of the Arabs, from  which I suspect that the doors were made either at Zanzibar or on the  coast, and conveyed to Simbamwenni plank by plank; yet as there is much  communication between Bagamoyo and Simbamwenni, it is just possible that  native artisans are the authors of this ornate workmanship, as several  doors chiselled and carved in the same manner, though not quite so  elaborately, were visible in the largest houses. The palace of the  Sultan is after the style of those on the coast, with long sloping roof,  wide eaves, and veranda in front.    The Sultana is the eldest daughter of the famous Kisabengo, a name  infamous throughout the neighbouring countries of Udoe, Ukami, Ukwere,  Kingaru, Ukwenni, and Kiranga-Wanna, for his kidnapping propensities.  Kisabengo was another Theodore on a small scale. Sprung from humble  ancestry, he acquired distinction for his personal strength, his powers  of harangue, and his amusing and versatile address, by which he gained  great ascendency over fugitive slaves, and was chosen a leader among  them. Fleeing from justice, which awaited him at the hands of the  Zanzibar Sultan, he arrived in Ukami, which extended at that time from  Ukwere to Usagara, and here he commenced a career of conquest, the  result of which was the cession by the Wakami of an immense tract of  fertile country, in the valley of the Ungerengeri. On its most desirable  site, with the river flowing close under the walls, he built his  capital, and called it Simbamwenni, which means \"The Lion,\" or the  strongest, City. In old age the successful robber and kidnapper  changed his name of Kisabengo, which had gained such a notoriety, to  Simbamwenni, after his town; and when dying, after desiring that his  eldest daughter should succeed him, he bestowed the name of the town  upon her also, which name of Simbamwenni the Sultana now retains and is  known by.    While crossing a rapid stream, which, as I said before flowed close  to the walls, the inhabitants of Simbamwenni had a fine chance of  gratifying their curiosity of seeing the \"Great Musungu,\" whose several  caravans had preceded him, and who unpardonably, because unlicensed, had  spread a report of his great wealth and power. I was thus the object of  a universal stare. At one time on the banks there were considerably over  a thousand natives going through the several tenses and moods of the  verb \"to stare,\" or exhibiting every phase of the substantive, viz.--the  stare peremptory, insolent, sly, cunning, modest, and casual. The  warriors of the Sultana, holding in one hand the spear, the bow, and  sheaf or musket, embraced with the other their respective friends, like  so many models of Nisus and Euryalus, Theseus and Pirithous, Damon and  Pythias, or Achilles and Patroclus, to whom they confidentially related  their divers opinions upon my dress and colour. The words \"Musungu kuba\"  had as much charm for these people as the music of the Pied Piper had  for the rats of Hamelin, since they served to draw from within the walls  across their stream so large a portion of the population; and when I  continued the journey to the Ungerengeri, distant four miles, I feared  that the Hamelin catastrophe might have to be repeated before I could  rid myself of them. But fortunately for my peace of mind, they finally  proved vincible under the hot sun, and the distance we had to go to  camp.    As we were obliged to overhaul the luggage, and repair saddles, as well  as to doctor a few of the animals, whose backs had by this time become  very sore, I determined to halt here two days. Provisions were very  plentiful also at Simbamwenni, though comparatively dear.    On the second day I was, for the first time, made aware that my  acclimatization in the ague-breeding swamps of Arkansas was powerless  against the mukunguru of East Africa. The premonitory symptoms of the  African type were felt in my system at 10 A.M. First, general lassitude  prevailed, with a disposition to drowsiness; secondly, came the spinal  ache which, commencing from the loins, ascended the vertebrae, and  extended around the ribs, until it reached the shoulders, where it  settled into a weary pain; thirdly came a chilliness over the whole  body, which was quickly followed by a heavy head, swimming eyes, and  throbbing temples, with vague vision, which distorted and transformed  all objects of sight. This lasted until 10 P.M., and the mukunguru left  me, much prostrated in strength.    The remedy, applied for three mornings in succession after the attack,  was such as my experience in Arkansas had taught me was the most  powerful corrective, viz., a quantum of fifteen grains of quinine,  taken in three doses of five grains each, every other hour from dawn to  meridian--the first dose to be taken immediately after the first effect  of the purging medicine taken at bedtime the night previous. I may add  that this treatment was perfectly successful in my case, and in all  others which occurred in my camp. After the mukunguru had declared  itself, there was no fear, with such a treatment of it, of a second  attack, until at least some days afterwards.    On the third day the camp was visited by the ambassadors of Her Highness  the Sultana of Simbamwenni, who came as her representatives to receive  the tribute which she regards herself as powerful enough to enforce. But  they, as well as Madame Simbamwenni, were informed, that as we knew it  was their custom to charge owners of caravans but one tribute, and as  they remembered the Musungu (Farquhar) had paid already, it was not fair  that I should have to pay again. The ambassadors replied with a \"Ngema\"  (very well), and promised to carry my answer back to their mistress.  Though it was by no means \"very well\" in fact, as it will be seen in  a subsequent chapter how the female Simbamwenni took advantage of an  adverse fortune which befell me to pay herself. With this I close the  chapter of incidents experienced during our transit across the maritime  region.        CHAPTER VI. -- TO UGOGO.         A valley of despond, and hot-bed of malaria.--Myriads of       vermin.--The Makata swamp.--A sorrowful experience catching       a deserter.--A far-embracing prospect.--Illness of William       Farquhar.-Lake Ugombo.--A land of promise.--The great       Kisesa.--The plague of earwigs.      The distance from Bagamoyo to Simbamwenni we found to be 119 miles,  and was accomplished in fourteen marches. But these marches, owing to  difficulties arising from the Masika season, and more especially to the  lagging of the fourth caravan under Maganga, extended to twenty-nine  days, thus rendering our progress very slow indeed--but a little more  than four miles a-day. I infer, from what I have seen of the travelling,  that had I not been encumbered by the sick Wanyamwezi porters, I could  have accomplished the distance in sixteen days. For it was not the  donkeys that proved recreant to my confidence; they, poor animals,  carrying a weight of 150 lbs. each, arrived at Simbamwenni in first-rate  order; but it was Maganga, composed of greed and laziness, and his  weakly-bodied tribe, who were ever falling sick. In dry weather the  number of marches might have been much reduced. Of the half-dozen  of Arabs or so who preceded this Expedition along this route, two  accomplished the entire distance in eight days. From the brief  descriptions given of the country, as it day by day expanded to our  view, enough may be gleaned to give readers a fair idea of it. The  elevation of Simbamwenni cannot be much over 1,000 feet above the level,  the rise of the land having been gradual. It being the rainy season,  about which so many ominous statements were doled out to us by those  ignorant of the character of the country, we naturally saw it under its  worst aspect; but, even in this adverse phase of it, with all its depth  of black mud, its excessive dew, its dripping and chill grass, its  density of rank jungle, and its fevers, I look back upon the scene with  pleasure, for the wealth and prosperity it promises to some civilized  nation, which in some future time will come and take possession of it. A  railroad from Bagamoyo to Simbamwenni might be constructed with as  much ease and rapidity as, and at far less cost than the Union Pacific  Railway, whose rapid strides day by day towards completion the world  heard of and admired. A residence in this part of Africa, after a  thorough system of drainage had been carried out, would not be attended  with more discomfort than generally follows upon the occupation of new  land. The temperature at this season during the day never exceeded 85  degrees Fahrenheit. The nights were pleasant--too cold without a pair  of blankets for covering; and, as far as Simbamwenni, they were without  that pest which is so dreadful on the Nebraska and Kansas prairies,  the mosquito. The only annoyances I know of that would tell hard on the  settler is the determined ferocity of the mabungu, or horse-fly; the  chufwa, &c., already described, which, until the dense forests and  jungles were cleared, would be certain to render the keeping of domestic  cattle unremunerative.    Contrary to expectation the Expedition was not able to start at the end  of two days; the third and the fourth days were passed miserably enough  in the desponding valley of Ungerengeri. This river, small as it is in  the dry seasons, becomes of considerable volume and power during the  Masika, as we experienced to our sorrow. It serves as a drain to a score  of peaks and two long ranges of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/517"],[0,"The Emerald City of Oz (#18)"],[1,"untry, yet none of us three happens to be a fairy.\"    Dorothy grew sober at this.    \"P'raps you're right, Billina,\" she answered.  \"But how funny it is, to  be captured by a lot of spoons!\"    \"I do not see anything very funny about it,\" declared a spoon.  \"We're  the regular military brigade of the kingdom.\"    \"What kingdom?\" she asked.    \"Utensia,\" said he.    \"I never heard of it before,\" asserted Dorothy.  Then she added  thoughtfully, \"I don't believe Ozma ever heard of Utensia, either.  Tell me, are you not subjects of Ozma of Oz?\"    \"We have never heard of her,\" retorted a spoon.  \"We are subjects of  King Kleaver, and obey only his orders, which are to bring all  prisoners to him as soon as they are captured.  So step lively, my  girl, and march with us, or we may be tempted to cut off a few of your  toes with our swords.\"    This threat made Dorothy laugh again.  She did not believe she was in  any danger; but here was a new and interesting adventure, so she was  willing to be taken to Utensia that she might see what King Kleaver's  kingdom was like.        16.  How Dorothy Visited Utensia    There must have been from six to eight dozen spoons in the Brigade, and  they marched away in the shape of a hollow square, with Dorothy,  Billina and Toto in the center of the square.  Before they had gone  very far Toto knocked over one of the spoons by wagging his tail, and  then the Captain of the Spoons told the little dog to be more careful,  or he would be punished.  So Toto was careful, and the Spoon Brigade  moved along with astonishing swiftness, while Dorothy really had to  walk fast to keep up with it.    By and by they left the woods and entered a big clearing, in which was  the Kingdom of Utensia.    Standing all around the clearing were a good many cookstoves, ranges  and grills, of all sizes and shapes, and besides these there were  several kitchen cabinets and cupboards and a few kitchen tables.  These  things were crowded with utensils of all sorts: frying pans, sauce  pans, kettles, forks, knives, basting and soup spoons, nutmeg graters,  sifters, colanders, meat saws, flat irons, rolling pins and many other  things of a like nature.    When the Spoon Brigade appeared with the prisoners a wild shout arose  and many of the utensils hopped off their stoves or their benches and  ran crowding around Dorothy and the hen and the dog.    \"Stand back!\" cried the Captain, sternly, and he led his captives  through the curious throng until they came before a big range that  stood in the center of the clearing.  Beside this range was a butcher  block upon which lay a great cleaver with a keen edge.  It rested upon  the flat of its back, its legs were crossed and it was smoking a long  pipe.    \"Wake up, your Majesty,\" said the Captain.  \"Here are prisoners.\"    Hearing this, King Kleaver sat up and looked at Dorothy sharply.    \"Gristle and fat!\" he cried.  \"Where did this girl come from?\"    \"I found her in the forest and brought her here a prisoner,\" replied  the Captain.    \"Why did you do that?\" inquired the King, puffing his pipe lazily.    \"To create some excitement,\" the Captain answered.  \"It is so quiet  here that we are all getting rusty for want of amusement.  For my part,  I prefer to see stirring times.\"    \"Naturally,\" returned the cleaver, with a nod.  \"I have always said,  Captain, without a bit of irony, that you are a sterling officer and a  solid citizen, bowled and polished to a degree.  But what do you expect  me to do with these prisoners?\"    \"That is for you to decide,\" declared the Captain.  \"You are the King.\"    \"To be sure; to be sure,\" muttered the cleaver, musingly.  \"As you say,  we have had dull times since the steel and grindstone eloped and left  us.  Command my Counselors and the Royal Courtiers to attend me, as  well as the High Priest and the Judge.  We'll then decide what can be  done.\"    The Captain saluted and retired and Dorothy sat down on an overturned  kettle and asked:    \"Have you anything to eat in your kingdom?\"    \"Here!  Get up!  Get off from me!\" cried a faint voice, at which his  Majesty the cleaver said:    \"Excuse me, but you're sitting on my friend the Ten-quart Kettle.\"    Dorothy at once arose, and the kettle turned right side up and looked  at her reproachfully.    \"I'm a friend of the King, so no one dares sit on me,\" said he.    \"I'd prefer a chair, anyway,\" she replied.    \"Sit on that hearth,\" commanded the King.    So Dorothy sat on the hearth-shelf of the big range, and the subjects  of Utensia began to gather around in a large and inquisitive throng.  Toto lay at Dorothy's feet and Billina flew upon the range, which had  no fire in it, and perched there as comfortably as she could.    When all the Counselors and Courtiers had assembled--and these seemed  to include most of the inhabitants of the kingdom--the King rapped on  the block for order and said:    \"Friends and Fellow Utensils!  Our worthy Commander of the Spoon  Brigade, Captain Dipp, has captured the three prisoners you see before  you and brought them here for--for--I don't know what for.  So I ask  your advice how to act in this matter, and what fate I should mete out  to these captives.  Judge Sifter, stand on my right.  It is your  business to sift this affair to the bottom.  High Priest Colender,  stand on my left and see that no one testifies falsely in this matter.\"    As these two officials took their places, Dorothy asked:    \"Why is the colander the High Priest?\"    \"He's the holiest thing we have in the kingdom,\" replied King Kleaver.    \"Except me,\" said a sieve.  \"I'm the whole thing when it comes to  holes.\"    \"What we need,\" remarked the King, rebukingly, \"is a wireless sieve.  I  must speak to Marconi about it.  These old-fashioned sieves talk too  much.  Now, it is the duty of the King's Counselors to counsel the King  at all times of emergency, so I beg you to speak out and advise me what  to do with these prisoners.\"    \"I demand that they be killed several times, until they are dead!\"  shouted a pepperbox, hopping around very excitedly.    \"Compose yourself, Mr. Paprica,\" advised the King.  \"Your remarks are  piquant and highly-seasoned, but you need a scattering of commonsense.  It is only necessary to kill a person once to make him dead; but I do  not see that it is necessary to kill this little girl at all.\"    \"I don't, either,\" said Dorothy.    \"Pardon me, but you are not expected to advise me in this matter,\"  replied King Kleaver.    \"Why not?\" asked Dorothy.    \"You might be prejudiced in your own favor, and so mislead us,\" he  said.  \"Now then, good subjects, who speaks next?\"    \"I'd like to smooth this thing over, in some way,\" said a flatiron,  earnestly.  \"We are supposed to be useful to mankind, you know.\"    \"But the girl isn't mankind!  She's womankind!\" yelled a corkscrew.    \"What do you know about it?\" inquired the King.    \"I'm a lawyer,\" said the corkscrew, proudly.  \"I am accustomed to  appear at the bar.\"    \"But you're crooked,\" retorted the King, \"and that debars you.  You may  be a corking good lawyer, Mr. Popp, but I must ask you to withdraw your  remarks.\"    \"Very well,\" said the corkscrew, sadly; \"I see I haven't any pull at  this court.\"    \"Permit me,\" continued the flatiron, \"to press my suit, your Majesty.  I do not wish to gloss over any fault the prisoner may have committed,  if such a fault exists; but we owe her some consideration, and that's  flat!\"    \"I'd like to hear from Prince Karver,\" said the King.    At this a stately carvingknife stepped forward and bowed.    \"The Captain was wrong to bring this girl here, and she was wrong to  come,\" he said.  \"But now that the foolish deed is done let us all  prove our mettle and have a slashing good time.\"    \"That's it! that's it!\" screamed a fat choppingknife.  \"We'll make  mincemeat of the girl and hash of the chicken and sausage of the dog!\"    There was a shout of approval at this and the King had to rap again for  order.    \"Gentlemen, gentlemen!\" he said, \"your remarks are somewhat cutting and  rather disjointed, as might be expected from such acute intellects.  But you give me no reasons for your demands.\"    \"See here, Kleaver; you make me tired,\" said a saucepan, strutting  before the King very impudently.  \"You're about the worst King that  ever reigned in Utensia, and that's saying a good deal.  Why don't you  run things yourself, instead of asking everybody's advice, like the  big, clumsy idiot you are?\"    The King sighed.    \"I wish there wasn't a saucepan in my kingdom,\" he said.  \"You fellows  are always stewing, over something, and every once in a while you slop  over and make a mess of it.  Go hang yourself, sir--by the handle--and  don't let me hear from you again.\"    Dorothy was much shocked by the dreadful language the utensils  employed, and she thought that they must have had very little proper  training.  So she said, addressing the King, who seemed very unfit to  rule his turbulent subjects:    \"I wish you'd decide my fate right away.  I can't stay here all day,  trying to find out what you're going to do with me.\"    \"This thing is becoming a regular broil, and it's time I took part in  it,\" observed a big gridiron, coming forward.    \"What I'd like to know,\" said a can-opener, in a shrill voice, \"is why  the little girl came to our forest anyhow and why she intruded upon  Captain Dipp--who ought to be called Dippy--and who she is, and where  she came from, and where she is going, and why and wherefore and  therefore and when.\"    \"I'm sorry to see, Sir Jabber,\" remarked the King to the can-opener,  \"that you have such a prying disposition.  As a matter of fact, all the  things you mention are none of our business.\"    Having said this the King relighted his pipe, which had gone out.    \"Tell me, please, what IS our business?\" inquired a potato-masher,  winking at Dorothy somewhat impertinently.  \"I'm fond of little girls,  myself, and it"]]]
