[New Series.], December 14, 1878 (#18)"],[1,"me a short description of the  principle and construction of the aerophone? A. We think it has not  been perfected.    (8) A. T. L. asks for a recipe for a liquid boot or shoe polish. A.  Clausen's ink is made as follows: Nutgalls, 8 parts; logwood extract,  10 parts; boil together in water, q. s., and add Castile soap, 4  parts; glycerin, trace. Crocker's--Logwood extract, 6 ozs.; water, 1  gallon; ivory black, 1.5 oz.; glycerin, 1 oz.; bichromate of potassa,  0.125 oz.; copperas, 0.125 oz.; boil together. Sefton's--Orange  shellac, 64 ozs.; alcohol, 4 gallons; pure asphaltum, 60 ozs.; neat's  foot oil, 1 pint; lampblack, q. s. Ovington's--Water, 1 gallon;  logwood extract, 6 ozs.; water, 1 gallon; borax, 6 ozs.; shellac,  1.5 oz.; water, 0.5 pint; bichromate of potassa, 0.375 oz. Mix the  solutions, and add 3 ozs. ammonia. Shaw's--Borax, 3 ozs.; orange  shellac, 5 ozs.; water, q. s.; boil and add soluble aniline black or  nigrosine, q. s. Rub the spots with strong aqueous solution of ferric  chloride, and dry before applying the dressing.    (9) J. S. & R. M. write: 1. We propose putting in a steam engine of 20  horse power, and we are informed there is an engine that weighs 2,700  lbs., that has a balance wheel weighing 500 lbs., cylinder 10 x 10  inches; cutting off at 3/4 stroke, running at 180 to 200 revolutions  a minute, and they say that it is 20 horse at 70 lbs. steam. Will such  an engine develop 20 horse power? A. The engine would develop 20 horse  power under the above conditions, if well constructed. 2. How can  we calculate the power of an engine? A. To determine the power of  an engine, multiply the mean pressure on the piston in lbs., by the  piston speed in feet per minute, and divide the product by 33,000.    (10) A. L. G. asks: 1. With a boiler 15 inches in diameter by 30  inches in height, with five 11/2 inch tubes 18 inches long, firebox 12  x 12, and all made of iron plates 1/4 inch thick. What is the greatest  number of pounds of steam to the square inch it will hold, and what  fraction of a horse power will it give to an engine having a cylinder  2 x 4 inches, situated 2 feet from the boiler, and connected by 40  inches of steam pipe? A. You can carry 150 lbs. of steam, and might  develop 1 horse power. 2. What is meant by the pitch of a wheel in a  propeller, and what is the inclination of a cylinder? A. The pitch of  a propeller is the distance it would advance in the direction of its  axis at each revolution, if it worked without slip. The inclination of  a cylinder refers to the angle made by its axis with a horizontal or  vertical line.    (11) J. H. asks: 1. Has steel been used for portable boilers? A. Yes.  2. What size boiler is required for an engine having a 3 x 4 inch  cylinder? A. Diameter, 24 inches; height, 45 inches; heating surface,  65 to 70 square feet.    (12) J. A. M. asks: How large must an air pump be for an engine steam  cylinder 8 x 8, making 100 revolutions per minute with 90 lbs. of  steam, allowing the pump to be 4 inches stroke, double acting, to be  attached to surface condenser? A. Diameter, 31/2 inches.    (13) J. A. F. asks: 1. What shall I paint my boiler and smoke stack  with, and where can I get the paint? My engine is a thrashing engine,  and of course is out of doors during the fall of the year. A. Get  some black varnish made from petroleum, from a dealer in machinists'  supplies. 2. How shall I care for the boiler inside? A. Leave the  boiler perfectly dry, unless you can coat the interior with oil. 3.  What shall I do for the engine. Is it necessary to take the piston out  of cylinder and oil it? A. If the engine is to stand for some time,  remove the piston, coat it and the cylinder with tallow; the same for  the journals. Cover all finished parts of the engine with a mixture of  white lead and tallow. 4. I find my steam gauge does not indicate less  than 10 lbs. when boiler is cold. What is the trouble and how can it  be repaired? A. In such a case it is best to send the gauge to a maker  for repairs.    (14) \"Zebra\" wishes to know the best test of the genuineness of  white lead; also the simplest way to try the comparative value of  two samples of ground white lead. Also the name of the best work to  consult upon the manufacture of Portland cement. A. See answer No. 29,  p. 283, current volume, SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN. Also pp. 102-105 Normandy  and Noad's \"Commercial Analysis.\" The relative value of different  samples of white lead in oil is roughly judged from the weight of  a given measured quantity, the covering properties when compared on  glass with a sample of finest white lead, and the color and general  appearance of the sample. You may consult Reid's \"Manufacture of  Portland Cement.\"    (15) J. B. B. asks: Can I arrange an electric battery so as to heat a  platinum wire for the purpose of cutting wood? Is it practicable? A.  Two or three Bunsen cells will do it. It is impracticable save as an  experiment.    (16) D. S. M. asks how to color butter to make it yellow, without  injuring it in any way. A. A little annotto is often used. If pure, it  is not injurious.    (17) H. C. M. asks: What substances are there that will absorb light  during the day when exposed to light, and give it out again at night?  A. 1. Heat strontium theosulphate for fifteen minutes over a good  Bunsen gas lamp and then for 5 minutes over a blast lamp. 2. Heat  equal parts of strontium carbonate and lac Supt gently for 5  minutes, then strongly for 25 minutes over a Bunsen lamp, and finally  5 minutes over a blast lamp. 3. Precipitate strong aqueous solution  of strontium chloride by means of sulphuric acid, dry the precipitate,  and heat it to redness for some time in a current of hydrogen, then  over a Bunsen lamp for 10 minutes, and for 20 minutes over a blast  lamp. Mix any of these with pure melted paraffin for use as a paint,  and expose for a time to sunlight. The two former yield a greenish  phosphorescence in the dark, the latter a bluish light.    (18) Z. asks: Is the Great African Desert below the level of the sea,  and if so, could it be made into an inland sea by flooding from the  ocean? A. A considerable, though relatively small, portion of the  Sahara is below the sea level, and the flooding of the lowest portion  has been proposed. The greater part of North Africa lies at a higher  level, the exception being a chain of old lake beds or chotts on the  border of Algeria.    (19) J. P. L. asks: How can I make a filter to cleanse rain water from  smoke as it passes from the roof to the cistern? The coal which is  burned here (bituminous) gives us a great deal of trouble in this  regard. A. The carbonaceous matters may be removed by passing the  water through a large barrel half filled with fine gravel and pounded,  freshly-burnt charcoal (free from dust), distributed in alternate  layers, each several inches deep. Over this spread a clean piece of  bagging, and fill in with fine gravel or coarse clean quartz sand for  12 inches or more. The inlet pipe should discharge at the bottom of  the barrel--the filtered water flowing from the top.    (20) F. E. H. asks: Can percussion caps be so composed as to explode  when pierced by a sharp pointed needle? If so, of what should they be  composed? A. Such an arrangement is employed in the needle gun. The  composition may be of mercuric fulminate.    (21) C. A. N. asks: What is the horse power of an engine 30 inches  stroke, 14 inches cylinder, 51 revolutions per minute, 60 lbs. mean  pressure in cylinder?    A. Piston area = 153.94 square inches. Piston speed = 255 feet per  minute. Indicated horse power =    153.94 x 60 x 255  -----------------  = 71.4        33,000    (22) P. O. asks: If I admit steam 100 lbs. pressure in a cylinder 15  x 24 inches, and cut the steam off when piston has traveled 6 inches,  what will be the pressure at 6 inches, 12 inches, 18 inches, and 24  inches, or just before it exhausts? A. The pressure will vary about in  the inverse ratio of the volume, so that, approximately,    vol. of cylinder up to point of cut-off + clearance vol.  ---------------------------------------------------------  vol. of cylinder at any point of expansion + clearance vol.        pressure above zero, at the given point.   =  ----------------------------------------      pressure above zero, at point of cut-off.    (23) H. T. S. asks: What size should I make the holes in the side of a  fan wheel, 20 inches in diameter? Also what size should the nozzle  be? A. Allow an opening of from 17 to 20 square inches at inlet and  discharge.    (24) E. M. D. writes: I am constructing a telephone according to  directions in SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT No. 142, using a bar  magnet in place of horseshoe magnet and soft iron core. 1. Would it  reduce the strength of bar magnet to cut a thread on one end of it?  A. No. 2. Will a bar magnet, used in Bell telephone, lose its power to  such a degree as not to work? A. Not readily. 3. Is No. 22 copper wire  of sufficient size for a telephone line of 1,000 feet? A. Yes; but  larger would be better.    (25) S. & Y. write: We have a pair of burrs on which we grind plaster.  The burrs are about 4 feet in diameter and 11/2 foot thick. We are  running them as an over runner at this time, but wish to change them  and make the lower burr run instead of the upper. Can a pair of burrs  of the above size be run in that way, and if so, what is the maximum  speed at which they can be run? A. If properly arranged, you can  run them, after the change, as fast as is allowable for overrunning  stones.    (26) J. J. asks: Which tire makes a wheel the strongest, 1.25 x 0.50  inch iron, or 1.25 x 5/16 steel tire? A. The steel tire will be the  strongest, comparing good qualities of steel and iron.    (27) E. L. W. asks: Is a ton (2,000 lbs.) of first class coke equal in  heat giving power to a ton (2,000 lbs.) of coal? If not, please  give me the relative value of coke and coal in heat"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38482"],[0,"Scientific American, Vol. XLIII.â€”No. 1.
