The early portion of the First Book, down to the end  of the twenty-fourth chapter, was probably written by Samuel; while  the rest of it, and the whole of the Second, are commonly ascribed  to Nathan and Gad, founding the opinion on I Chronicles xxix: 29..  Commentators, however, are divided about this, some supposing that the  statements in I Samuel ii: 26; iii: 1, indicate the hand of the judge  himself, or a contemporary; while some think, from I Samuel vi: 18;  xii: 5; xxvii: 6, that the composition must be referred to a later age.  It is probable, however, that these supposed marks of an after period  were interpolations of Ezra. This uncertainty, however, as to the  authorship does not affect the inspired authority of the book, which is  indisputable, being quoted in the New Testament (Acts xiii: 22; Hebrews  i: 5) as well as in many of the Psalms.\" (Commentary, Explanatory and  Critical, p. 8.)    3. _Catholic View of the Books of Samuel:_ \"This [I Samuel] and the  following book [II Samuel] are called by the Hebrews the books of  Samuel, because they contain the history of Samuel, and of the two  kings, Saul and David, whom he anointed. They are more commonly named  by the Fathers the first and second book of kings. As to the writer  of them, the common opinion is that Samuel composed the first book as  far as the twenty-fifth chapter; and that the prophets Nathan and Gad  finished the first, and wrote the second book. See I Chronicles xxix:  29.\" (Introduction to the First Book of Samuel, Douay Bible, p. 308.)    4. _The First and Second Books of Kings. Protestant View:_ \"In the  ancient copies of the Hebrew Bible, First and Second Kings constitute  one book. Various titles have been given to them; in the Septuagint  and the Vulgate they are called the Third and Fourth Books of Kings.  The authorship of these books is unknown; but the prevailing opinion  is that they were compiled by Ezra, or one of the later prophets, from  the ancient documents that are so frequently referred to in the course  of the history as of public and established authority. Their inspired  character was acknowledged by the Jewish church, which ranked them in  the sacred canon; and, besides, is attested by our Lord, who frequently  quotes from them (cf. I Kings xvii: 9; II Kings v: 14 with Luke iv:  24-27; I Kings x: 1 with Matthew xii: 42).\" (Commentary, Explanatory  and Critical, p. 8.)    5. _Catholic View of Books of Kings:_ \"This [the first Book of Kings]  and the following [the second Book of Kings] book are called by the  holy fathers the third and fourth book of Kings; but by the Hebrews  the first and second Malachim, that is Kings. They contain the history  of the kingdoms of Israel and Juda, from the beginning of the reign of  Solomon, to the captivity. As to the writer of these books, it seems  most probable they were not writen by one man, nor at one time; but as  there was all along a succession of prophets in Israel, who recorded,  by divine inspiration, the most remarkable things that happened in  their days, these books seem to have been written by these prophets.\"  (Douay Bible, pp. 381-2.)    6. _Historical Period of the Books of Kings:_ \"The Books of Kings  narrate the history from the rebellion of Adonijah to the final  captivity of Judah, including the whole history of the northern kingdom  from the separation till its disappearance in B. C. 721. The succession  of events will be found under Chronology. The books were compiled by  some unknown writer from a variety of written documents, including the  state chronicles.\" (Seventies' Bible Dictionary, p 94.)    7. _Literary Features of the Books of Samuel and of Kings:_ \"The  literary form of the books of Kings is quite different from that of the  books of Samuel. There is an almost stereotyped framework, resembling  that of the book of Judges, within which the events of the successive  reigns are placed. When the name of a new king is introduced, it is  stated how old he was when he came to the throne, how many years he  reigned, and, in regard to the kings of Judah, what was his mother's  name. Then a general character is pronounced upon his reign, the events  are recorded at greater or less length, and at the close a reference is  usually given to another authority for fuller details. When the divided  monarchy is to be treated, the usual proceeding is to give the record  of the northern kingdom first, and then the corresponding record for  the southern, the history thus falling into periods longer or shorter.  And this course is followed so closely that sometimes the same event  is twice related, if it concerns the two kingdoms. These features make  it probable that the book is composed from other written materials,  or at least largely based upon them. And the frequent references to  books of chronicles of the kings of Judah or of Israel favor the  inference that state records of the respective kingdoms, containing  lists of officials, statistical matters, and memoranda of events in  the different reigns were available for the purpose. There were also,  in all probability, narratives of the doings of Elijah, Elisha, and  other prophets, preserved in the prophetic circles, which would furnish  information of another kind. A work extending over so long a period  could not be the expression of the direct personal knowledge of any one  writer, and could only be composed in the way indicated.\" (Cambridge  Bible, p. 63.)

I  Chronicles v: 1, 2._    _NOTES._    1. _Books of Chronicles:_ \"The two Books of Chronicles counted as  one in the Hebrew canon. They give a short history of events from  the creation down to the proclamation of Cyrus, allowing the Jews  to return to Palestine. The books contain several references to the  sources whence information was derived, e. g., \"the book of Nathan  the prophet, the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and the visions of  Iddo the seer,\" (II Chron. ix: 29; cf. also II Chron. xii: 15; xiii:  22; xx: 34; xxvi: 22; xxxii: 32; xxxiii: 18.) These passages make it  clear that, from the earliest times of the kingdom, writers living amid  the events described, and generally of the prophetic order, recorded  the history of their own times. These records along with Samuel and  Kings, formed the materials out of which our Books of Chronicles were  compiled, the compilers choosing such portions as suited the purpose  of their composition. Though secular events are not excluded from the  compilations thus formed, the writers dwell with most satisfaction  upon the ecclesiastical and religious aspects of the history, and the  progress of temple worship in Jerusalem. The date of composition cannot  be fixed with certainty; it was probably between 300 and 250 B. C.\"  (Cambridge Bible Helps, p. 32.)    2. _Catholic View of Chronicles:_ \"These books are called by the Greek  interpreters Paralipomenon, that is, 'of things left out, or omitted,'  because they are a kind of a supplement of such things as were passed  over in the book of the Kings. The Hebrews call them Dibre Hajamim,  that is, 'The words of the days,' or The Chronicles. Not that they are  the books which are so often quoted in Kings, under the title of the  'Words of the Days of the Kings of Israel, and of the Kings of Juda;'  for the Books of Paralipomenon were written after the Books of Kings;  but because in all probability they have been abridged from those  ancient 'Words of the Days,' by Esdras or some other sacred writer.\"  (Introduction to Chronicles, Douay Bible.)    3. _Controversial Value of the Books of Chronicles:_ \"The constant  tradition of the Jews, in which they have been followed by the great  mass of Christian commentators, is that these books were for the most  part compiled by Ezra; and the one genealogy, that of Zerubbabel, which  comes down to a later time, is no objection to this statement, without  recurring to the strange notion broached by the old commentators, and  even sanctioned by Dr. Davidson (in Kitto's Cyclo. of Bibl. Lit., art.  Chronicles), that the knowledge of these generations was communicated  to Ezra by inspiration.

I now believe that in a very real sense the animal is  himself giving the stage performance. He knows what he is doing,  he delights in it, he varies it from time to time, he understands  the succession of tricks which are being called for, he is guided  by word of mouth without any signal open or concealed, and the  function of his trainer is exercised mainly to steady and control.    \"I am prepared to accept the statement of his trainers, Mr. and  Mrs. McArdle, that Peter's proficiency is not so much the result  of training as of downright self-education.\"    Peter was put through many of the tests which Dr. Witmer uses for  the study of backward children. He performed many of these tests  in a very satisfactory manner. He was able to string beads the  first time he tried it. He put pegs in the ordinary kindergarten  pegging board. He opened and closed a very difficult lock. He used  hammer and screw driver, and distinguished without any mistake  between nails and screws. A peculiar kind of hammer was given to  him in order to fool him, but Peter was not fooled. He felt both  ends of the hammer and used the flat end instead of the round end.    Showing his initiative during the tests, Peter got away from those  who were watching him and darted for a washstand, quickly turned  the faucet and put his mouth to the spigot and secured a drink  before he was snatched away by his trainers. He understood  language and followed instructions without signs. He was able to  say \"mamma,\" and Doctor Witmer taught him in five minutes to give  the sound of \"p.\" The most remarkable performance was making the  letter \"w\" on the blackboard, in which he imitated Doctor Witmer's  movements exactly, and reproduced a fair copy of the letter.    The last four paragraphs reproduced above have been copied from an  article which appeared in the Philadelphia _Public Ledger_ on  December 17, 1909.    Dr. Witmer declares that the study of this ape's mind is a subject  fit, not for the animal psychologist, but for the child  psychologist.    Suzette's Failure in Maternal Instinct. As a closing contribution  to our observations on the chimpanzee, I must record a tragic  failure in maternal instinct, as well as in general intelligence,  in a chimpanzee.    In 1919 our two fine eight-year old chimpanzees, Boma and Suzette,  were happily married. It was a genuine love match, and strictly  monogamous at that; for while big Fanny Chimp in the cage next  door to Boma loved Boma and openly courted him, he was  outrageously indifferent to her, and even scorned her. After  seven months of gestation, a very good baby was born to Suzette,  quite naturally and successfully. Boma's shouts of excitement and  delight carried half a mile throughout the Park. Everything looked  most auspicious for the rearing of a wonderful cage-bred and  cage-born chimpanzee, the second one ever born in captivity.  Instead of carrying her infant astride her hip, as do orang  mothers, and the coolie women of India, Suzette astonished us  beyond measure by tucking it _into her groin,_ between her  thigh and her abdomen, head outward. It was a fine place,--warm  and soft,--but not good when overdone! When Suzette walked, as she  freely did, she held up the leg responsible for the baby, to hold  it securely in place, and walked upon the other foot and her two  hands. About all this there was one very bad thing. The baby was  perfectly helpless! As long as the mother chose to keep it in her  groin prison, it could not get free.    Suzette was completely isolated, kept absolutely quiet, and every  chance was given her to go on with the functions of motherhood.  Her breasts contained plenty of milk, and the flow was due to  start on the second day after the infant's arrival.    Day and night the baby was jealously confined in that massive and  powerful groin,--and _under too much pressure!_ When the baby  cried, and kicked, and struggled to get free, Suzette would  nervously rearrange her straw bed, carefully pick from the tiny  fingers every straw that they had clutched, and settle down again.  If the struggle was soon renewed, Suzette would change the infant  over to the other groin, and close upon it as before.    Sleeping or waking, walking, sitting or lying down, she held it  there. If we attempted to touch the infant, the mother instantly  became savage and dangerous. Not one human finger was permitted to  touch it. For hours, and for days, we anxiously watched for  nursing to begin; but in vain. At last we became almost frantic  from the spectacle of the infant being slowly starved to death  because the mother did not realize that it needed her milk, and  that she alone could promote nursing. _Her mother instinct  utterly failed to supply the link that alone could connect infancy  to motherhood, and furnish life._    Of course this failure was due to poor Suzette's artificial life,  and unnatural surroundings. Had she been all alone, in the depths  of a tropical forest, Nature would have proceeded along her usual  lines. But in our Primate House, Suzette felt that her infant was  surrounded by a host of strange enemies, from whom it must be  strongly and persistently _guarded and defended._ That was  the idea that completely dominated her mind, ruled out all human  help, and blocked the main process of nature.    During the eight days that the infant lived, it was able to reach  her breast and nurse only once, for about one minute; and then  back it went to its prison, where it died from sheer lack of  nourishment.    In 1920, that same history was repeated, except that on this  occasion our Veterinary Surgeon, Dr. W. Reid Blair, worked (on the  fifth day) for seven hours without intermission to stupefy Suzette  with chloroform, or other opiates, sufficiently to make it  possible to remove the baby without a fight with the mother and  its certain death. Owing to her savage temper all the work had to  be done between iron bars, to keep from losing hands or arms, and  the handicap on the human hand was too great. Even when Suzette  had received chloroform for an hour and twenty minutes, and was  regarded as _half dead,_ at the first touch of a human finger  upon her thigh she instantly aroused and sprang up, raging and  ready for battle.    The whole effort failed. To rope Suzette and attempt to control  her by force would have been sheer folly, or worse. In such a  struggle the infant would have been torn to pieces.    The second one died as the first one did, and for an awful week we  were unable to gain possession of the decomposing cadaver. Suzette  knew that something was wrong, and she realized the awful odor,  but that idea of defense of her offspring obscured all others. In  maintaining her possession of that infant, nothing could surpass  the cunning of that ape mother. Will we ever succeed in outwitting  her, and in getting one of her babies alive into a baby incubator?  Who can say?          X    THE TRUE MENTAL STATUS OF THE GORILLA      The true mental status of the gorilla was discovered in 1919 and  1920, at 15 Sloane Street, London, by Major Rupert Penny, of the  Royal Air Service, and his young relative, Miss Alyse Cunningham.  Prior to that time, through various combinations of retarding  circumstances, no living gorilla had ever been placed and kept in  an environment calculated to develop and display the real mental  calibre of the gorilla mind. It seems that an exhibition cage, in  a zoological park or garden thronged with visitors, actually tends  to the suppression, or even the complete extinguishment, of true  gorilla character. The atmosphere of the footlights and the stage  in which the chimpanzee delights and thrives is to the gorilla  repulsive and unbearable.    Judging by Major Penny's \"John,\" the gorilla wishes to live in a  high-class human family, in a modern house, and be treated like a  human being! It is now definitely recognized by us, and also by  our colleagues in the London Zoological Gardens, that gorillas can  not live long and thrive on public exhibition, before great crowds  of people, and that it is folly to insist upon trying to compel  them to do so. The male individual that lived several years in the  Breslau Zoological Garden and attained the age of seven years was  a striking exception.    We have had two gorillas at our Park, one of which, a female named  Dinah, arrived in good health, and lived with us eleven and one-  half months. Her mind was dull and hopelessly unresponsive. She  learned next to nothing, and she did nothing really interesting.  Other captive gorillas I have known have been equally morose and  unresponsive, and lived fewer months than Dinah.    It is because of such animals as Dinah that for fifty years the  mental status of the gorilla species has been under a cloud. Until  now it has been much misunderstood and unappreciated. Of the few  gorillas that have been seen in England and America, I think that  all save John have been so morose and unresponsive, _and so  undeveloped by companionship and training_, that mentally they  have been rated far below the chimpanzee and orang.    Our own Dinah was no exception to the rule. Personally she was a  stupid little thing, even when in excellent health. Her most  pronounced and exasperating stupidities were shown in her refusal  to eat, or to taste, strange food, even when very hungry. Any ape  that does not know enough to eat a fine, ripe banana, and will  only mince away at the _inner lining_ of the banana skin, is  an unmitigated numskull, and hardly fit to live. Dinah was all  that, and more. But, alas! We have seen a few stupid human  children who obstinately refused even to taste certain new and  unknown kinds of food, because they \"know\" they will not like  them! So Dinah was not alone in her childish folly.    At last a chain of"]]]
