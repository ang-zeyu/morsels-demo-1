If your intentions     be more decided, I think this ground of quarrel ought to be kept up.     Let me know what you mean to do, and wait till the favourable     moment, which I shall seize according to circumstances; for we must     not have to do with all the world at once.    The Directory answered that the moment was not favourable; that it  was first necessary to take Mantua, and give Wurmser a sound beating.  However, towards the end of the year 1796 the Directory began to give  more credit to the sincerity of the professions of neutrality made  on the part of Venice. It was resolved, therefore, to be content with  obtaining money and supplies for the army, and to refrain from violating  the neutrality. The Directory had not then in reserve, like Bonaparte,  the idea of making the dismemberment of Venice serve as a compensation  for such of the Austrian possessions as the French Republic might  retain.    In 1797 the expected favourable moment had arrived. The knell of Venice  was rung; and Bonaparte thus wrote to the Directory on the 30th of  April: \"I am convinced that the only course to be now taken is to  destroy this ferocious and sanguinary Government.\" On the 3d of May,  writing from Palma Nuova, he says: \"I see nothing that can be done but  to obliterate the Venetian name from the face of the globe.\"    Towards the end of March 1797 the Government of Venice was in a  desperate state. Ottolini, the Podesta of Bergamo, an instrument of  tyranny in the hands of the State inquisitors, then harassed the people  of Bergamo and Brescia, who, after the reduction of Mantua, wished to  be separated from Venice. He drew up, to be sent to the Senate, a long  report respecting the plans of separation, founded on information given  him by a Roman advocate, named Marcelin Serpini; who pretended to have  gleaned the facts he communicated in conversation with officers of the  French army. The plan of the patriotic party was, to unite the Venetian  territories on the mainland with Lombardy, and to form of the whole  one republic. The conduct of Ottolini exasperated the party inimical to  Venice, and augmented the prevailing discontent. Having disguised his  valet as a peasant, he sent him off to Venice with the report he had  drawn up on Serpini's communications, and other information; but this  report never reached the inquisitors. The valet was arrested, his  despatches taken, and Ottolini fled from Bergamo. This gave a beginning  to the general rising of the Venetian States. In fact, the force of  circumstances alone brought on the insurrection of those territories  against their old insular government. General La Hoz, who commanded  the Lombard Legion, was the active protector of the revolution,  which certainly had its origin more in the progress of the prevailing  principles of liberty than in the crooked policy of the Senate of  Venice. Bonaparte, indeed, in his despatches to the Directory, stated  that the Senate had instigated the insurrection; but that was not quite  correct, and he could not wholly believe his own assertion.    Pending the vacillation of the Venetian Senate, Vienna was exciting the  population of its States on the mainland to rise against the French.  The Venetian Government had always exhibited an extreme aversion to the  French Revolution, which had been violently condemned at Venice. Hatred  of the French had been constantly excited and encouraged, and religious  fanaticism had inflamed many persons of consequence in the country. From  the end of 1796 the Venetian Senate secretly continued its armaments,  and the whole conduct of that Government announced intentions which  have been called perfidious, but the only object of which was to defeat  intentions still more perfidious. The Senate was the irreconcilable  enemy of the French Republic. Excitement was carried to such a point  that in many places the people complained that they were not permitted  to arm against the French. The Austrian generals industriously  circulated the most sinister reports respecting the armies of the  Sombre-et-Meuse and the Rhine, and the position of the French troops in  the Tyrol. These impostures, printed in bulletins, were well calculated  to instigate the Italians, and especially the Venetians, to rise in mass  to exterminate the French, when the victorious army should penetrate  into the Hereditary States.    The pursuit of the Archduke Charles into the heart of Austria encouraged  the hopes which the Venetian Senate had conceived, that it would be easy  to annihilate the feeble remnant of the French army, as the troops were  scattered through the States of Venice on the mainland. Wherever the  Senate had the ascendency, insurrection was secretly fomented; wherever  the influence of the patriots prevailed, ardent efforts were made to  unite the Venetian terra firma to the Lombard Republic.    Bonaparte skillfully took advantage of the disturbances, and the  massacres consequent on them, to adopt towards the Senate the tone of  an offended conqueror. He published a declaration that the Venetian  Government was the most treacherous imaginable. The weakness and cruel  hypocrisy of the Senate facilitated the plan he had conceived of making  a peace for France at the expense of the Venetian Republic. On returning  from Leoben, a conqueror and pacificator, he, without ceremony, took  possession of Venice, changed the established government, and, master of  all the Venetian territory, found himself, in the negotiations of Campo  Formio, able to dispose of it as he pleased, as a compensation for the  cessions which had been exacted from Austria. After the 19th of May he  wrote to the Directory that one of the objects of his treaty with Venice  was to avoid bringing upon us the odium of violating the preliminaries  relative to the Venetian territory, and, at the same time, to afford  pretexts and to facilitate their execution.    At Campo Formio the fate of this republic was decided. It disappeared  from the number of States without effort or noise. The silence of its  fall astonished imaginations warmed by historical recollections from  the brilliant pages of its maritime glory. Its power, however, which had  been silently undermined, existed no longer except in the prestige of  those recollections. What resistance could it have opposed to the man  destined to change the face of all Europe?            CHAPTER V     1797.         Signature of the preliminaries of peace--Fall of Venice--My arrival     and reception at Leoben--Bonaparte wishes to pursue his success--     The Directory opposes him--He wishes to advance on Vienna--Movement     of the army of the Sombre-et-Mouse--Bonaparte's dissatisfaction--     Arrival at Milan--We take up our residence at Montebello--Napoleon's     judgment respecting Dandolo and Melzi.    I joined Bonaparte at Leoben on the 19th of April, the day after the  signature of the preliminaries of peace. These preliminaries resembled  in no respect the definitive treaty of Campo Formio. The still  incomplete fall of the State of Venice did not at that time present an  available prey for partition. All was arranged afterwards. Woe to the  small States that come in immediate contact with two colossal empires  waging war!    Here terminated my connection with Bonaparte as a comrade and equal, and  those relations with him commenced in which I saw him suddenly great,  powerful, and surrounded with homage and glory. I no longer addressed  him as I had been accustomed to do. I appreciated too well his personal  importance. His position placed too great a social distance between  him and me not to make me feel the necessity of fashioning my demeanour  accordingly. I made with pleasure, and without regret, the easy  sacrifice of the style of familiar companionship and other little  privileges. He said, in a loud voice, when I entered the salon where  he was surrounded by the officers who formed his brilliant staff, \"I am  glad to see you, at last\"--\"Te voila donc, enfin;\", but as soon as we  were alone he made me understand that he was pleased with my reserve,  and thanked me for it. I was immediately placed at the head of his  Cabinet. I spoke to him the same evening respecting the insurrection of  the Venetian territories, of the dangers which menaced the French, and  of those which I had escaped, etc. \"Care thou' nothing about it,\" said  he;         --[He used to 'tutoyer' me in this familiar manner until his return     to Milan.]--    \"those rascals shall pay for it. Their republic has had its day, and is  done.\" This republic was, however, still existing, wealthy and powerful.  These words brought to my recollection what I had read in a work by one  Gabriel Naude, who wrote during the reign of Louis XIII. for Cardinal de  Bagin: \"Do you see Constantinople, which flatters itself with being the  seat of a double empire; and Venice, which glories in her stability of a  thousand years? Their day will come.\"    In the first conversation which Bonaparte had with me, I thought I could  perceive that he was not very well satisfied with the preliminaries. He  would have liked to advance with his army to Vienna. He did not conceal  this from me. Before he offered peace to Prince Charles, he wrote to  the Directory that he intended to pursue his success, but that for  this purpose he reckoned on the co-operation of the armies of the  Sambre-et-Meuse and the Rhine. The Directory replied that he must  not reckon on a diversion in Germany, and that the armies of the  Sambre-et-Meuse and the Rhine were not to pass that river. A resolution  so unexpected--a declaration so contrary to what he had constantly  solicited, compelled him to terminate his triumphs, and renounce his  favourite project of planting the standard of the republic on the  ramparts of Vienna, or at least of levying contributions on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35744"],[0,"The gradual acceptance of the Copernican theory of the universe (#18)"],[1,"ingenious and valuable subtilties may one  unearth.\" Then he adds that \"the greatness of Copernicus has never  been sufficiently appreciated nor will it be,--that man who  accomplished what no astronomer before him had scarcely been able even  to suggest without an insane machinery of spheres, for by a triple  motion of the earth he abolished epicycles and eccentrics. What before  so many Atlases could not support, this one Hercules has dared to  carry. Would that he had kept himself within the limits of his  hypothesis!\"[341]    [Footnote 341: Riccioli: _Op. cit._: II, 304, 309.]    His conclusions seem to show that only his position as a Jesuit  restrained him from being a Copernican himself.[342] \"I. If the  celestial phenomena alone are considered, they are equally well  explained by the two hypotheses [Ptolemaic and Copernican]. II. The  physical evidence as explained in the two systems with exception of  percussion and the speed of bodies driven north or south, and east or  west, is all for immobility. III. One might waver indifferently  between the two hypotheses aside from the witness of the Scriptures,  which settles the question. IV. There are in addition plenty of other  motives besides Scriptural ones for rejecting this system.\" (!) But  with the Scriptural evidence he adduces the decree of the Index under  Paul V against the doctrine, and the sentence of Galileo, so that \"the  sole possible conclusion is that the earth stands by nature immobile  in the center of the universe, and the sun moves around it with both a  diurnal and an annual motion.\"[343]    [Footnote 342: Delambre: _Astr. Mod._: I, 680.]    [Footnote 343: Riccioli: _Op. cit._: II, 478 (condensed), 500.]    Even this great book was as insufficient to stop the criticism of the  action of the Congregations, as it was to stop the spread of the  doctrine. So once again the father took up the cudgels in defense of  the Church. The full title of his _Apologia_ runs: \"An Apologia in  behalf of an argument from physical mathematics against the Copernican  system, directed against that system by a new argument from the reflex  motion of falling weights.\" (Venice, 1669). He states in this that his  _Almagestum Novum_ had received the approbation of professors of  mathematics at Bologna, of one at Pisa, and of another at Padua, and  he quotes the conclusion from _Nicetas Orthodoxus_ (\"a diatribe by  Julius Turrinus, doctor of mathematics, philosophy, medicine, law, and  Greek letters\"): \"That the sun is revolved by diurnal and by annual  motion, and that the earth is at rest I firmly hold, infallibly  believe, and openly confess, not because of mathematical reasons, but  solely at the command of faith, by the authority of the Scriptures,  and the nod of approval (_nutu_) of the Roman See, whose rules laid  down at the dictation of the spirit of truth, may I, as befits  everyone, uphold as law.\"[344]    [Footnote 344: Riccioli: _Apologia_: 4.]    Riccioli further on proceeds to answer his objecters, declaring that  \"the Church did not decide _ex cathedra_ that the Scripture concerning  movement should be interpreted literally; that the censure was laid by  qualified theologians and approved by eminent cardinals, and was not  merely provisional, nor for the time being absolute, since the  contrary could never be demonstrated; and that while it was the  primary intent of the Inquisitors to condemn the opinion as heretical  and directly contrary to the Scriptures ... they added that it was  absurd and false also in philosophy, in order, not to avert any  objections which could be on the side of philosophy or astronomy, but  only lest any one should say that Scripture is opposed to  philosophy.\"[345] These answers are indicative of the type of  criticism with which the Church had to cope even at that time.[346]    [Footnote 345: Ibid: 103.]    [Footnote 346: One bit of contemporary opinion on Riccioli and his  work has come down to us. A canon at Liege, Rene-Francois Sluse, wrote  asking a friend (about 1670) to sound Wallis, the English  mathematician, as to his opinion of the _Almagestum Novum_, and of  this argument based on the acceleration of movement in falling bodies.  Wallis himself replied that he thought the argument devoid of all  value. The canon at once wrote, \"I do not understand how a man as  intelligent as Riccioli should think he could bring to a close a  matter so difficult [the refutation] by a proof as futile as this.\"  Monchamp: 165-166.

THE GRADUAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE COPERNICAN SYSTEM.      Just as Tycho Brahe's system proved to be for some a good half-way  station between the improbable Ptolemaic and the heretical Copernican  system;[347] so the Cartesian philosophy helped others to reconcile  their scientific knowledge with their reverence for the Scriptures,  until Newton's work had more fully demonstrated the scientific truth.    [Footnote 347: See Moxon: _Advice, A Tutor to Astronomy and Geography_  (1670): 269.]    Its originator, Rene Descartes[348] (1596-1650) was in Holland when  word of Galileo's condemnation reached him in 1633, as he was seeking  in the bookshops of Amsterdam and Leyden for a copy of the  _Dialogo_.[349] He at once became alarmed lest he too be accused of  trying to establish the movement of the earth, a doctrine which he had  understood was then publicly taught even in Rome, and which he had  made the basis of his own philosophy. If this doctrine were condemned  as false, then his philosophy must be also; and, true to his training  by the Jesuits, rather than go against the Church he would not publish  his books. He set aside his _Cosmos_, and delayed the publication of  the _Methode_ for some years in consequence, even starting to  translate it into Latin as a safeguard.[350] His conception of the  universe, the Copernican one modified to meet the requirements of a  literally interpreted Bible, was not printed until 1644, when it  appeared in his _Principes_.[351]    [Footnote 348: Haldane's _Descartes_ (1905) is the most recent and  authoritative account based upon Descartes's works as published in the  Adams-Tannery edition (Paris, 1896. foll.). This edition supersedes  that of Cousin. [Transcriber's Note: Missing footnote reference in  original text has been added above in a logical place.]]    [Footnote 349: Haldane: 153.]    [Footnote 350: Ibid: 158.]    [Footnote 351: Descartes: _Principes_, Pt. III, chap. 13.]    According to this statement which he made only as a possible  explanation of the phenomena and not as an absolute truth, while there  was little to choose between the Tychonic and the Copernican  conceptions, he inclined slightly toward the former. He conceived of  the earth and the other planets as each borne along in its enveloping  heaven like a ship by the tide, or like a man asleep on a ship that  was sailing from Calais to Dover. The earth itself does not move, but  it is transported so that its position is changed in relation to the  other planets but not visibly so in relation to the fixed stars  because of the vast intervening spaces. The laws of the universe  affect even the most minute particle, and all alike are swept along in  a series of vortices, or whirlpools, of greater or less size. Thus the  whole planetary system sweeps around the sun in one great vortex, as  the satellites sweep around their respective planets in lesser ones.  In this way Descartes worked out a mechanical explanation of the  universe of considerable importance because it was a rational one  which anyone could understand. Its defects were many, to be sure, as  for example, that it did not allow for the elliptical orbits of the  planets;[352] and one critic has claimed that this theory of a  motionless earth borne along by an enveloping heaven was comparable to  a worm in a Dutch cheese sent from Amsterdam to Batavia,--the worm has  travelled about 6000 leagues but without changing its place![353] But  this theory fulfilled Descartes's aim: to show that the universe was  governed by mechanical laws of which we can be absolutely certain and  that Galileo's discoveries simply indicated this.[354]    [Footnote 352: Haldane: 291.]    [Footnote 353: Monchamp: 185, note.]    [Footnote 354: Haldane: 292.]    This exposition of the Copernican doctrine strongly appealed to the  literary world of the 17th and 18th centuries in western Europe,  especially in the Netherlands, in the Paris salons and in the  universities.[355] M. Monchamp cites a number of contemporary comments  upon its spread, in one of which it is claimed that in 1691, the  university of Louvain had for the preceding forty years been  practically composed of Cartesians.[356] For the time being, this  theory was a more or less satisfactory explanation of the universe  according to known laws; it answered to Galileo's observations; it was  in harmony with the Scriptures, and its vortices paved the way for the  popular acceptance of Newton's law of universal gravitation.    [Footnote 355: Ibid: 193, 279.]    [Footnote 356: Monchamp: 177-181.]    Protestant England was of course little disturbed by the decree  against the Copernican doctrine, a fact that makes it possible,  perhaps, to see there more clearly the change in people's attitude  from antagonism to acceptance, than in Catholic Europe where fear of  the Church's power, and respect for its decisions inhibited honest  public expression of thought and conviction. While in England also the  literal interpretation of the Scriptures continued to be with the  common people a strong objection against the doctrine, the rationalist  movement of the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries along with  Newton's great work, helped win acceptance for it among the better  educated classes.
