Dorothy's success had greatly  encouraged him, and they both hoped he would manage to make at least  one correct guess.    However, he proved as unfortunate as the others except Dorothy, and  although he took a good deal of time to select his objects, not one did  the poor Scarecrow guess aright.    So he became a solid gold card-receiver, and the beautiful but terrible  palace awaited its next visitor.    \"It's all over,\" remarked the King, with a sigh of satisfaction; \"and  it has been a very amusing performance, except for the one good guess  the Kansas girl made.  I am richer by a great many pretty ornaments.\"    \"It is my turn, now,\" said Billina, briskly.    \"Oh, I'd forgotten you,\" said the King.  \"But you needn't go if you  don't wish to.  I will be generous, and let you off.\"    \"No you won't,\" replied the hen.  \"I insist upon having my guesses, as  you promised.\"    \"Then go ahead, you absurd feathered fool!\" grumbled the King, and he  caused the opening that led to the palace to appear once more.    \"Don't go, Billina,\" said Dorothy, earnestly.  \"It isn't easy to guess  those orn'ments, and only luck saved me from being one myself.  Stay  with me and we'll go back to the Land of Ev together.  I'm sure this  little Prince will give us a home.\"    \"Indeed I will,\" said Evring, with much dignity.    \"Don't worry, my dear,\" cried Billina, with a cluck that was meant for  a laugh.  \"I may not be human, but I'm no fool, if I AM a chicken.\"    \"Oh, Billina!\" said Dorothy, \"you haven't been a chicken in a long  time.  Not since you--you've been--grown up.\"    \"Perhaps that's true,\" answered Billina, thoughtfully.  \"But if a  Kansas farmer sold me to some one, what would he call me?--a hen or a  chicken!\"    \"You are not a Kansas farmer, Billina,\" replied the girl, \"and you  said--\"    \"Never mind that, Dorothy.  I'm going.  I won't say good-bye, because  I'm coming back.  Keep up your courage, for I'll see you a little  later.\"    Then Billina gave several loud \"cluck-clucks\" that seemed to make the  fat little King MORE nervous than ever, and marched through the  entrance into the enchanted palace.    \"I hope I've seen the last of THAT bird,\" declared the monarch, seating  himself again in his throne and mopping the perspiration from his  forehead with his rock-colored handkerchief.  \"Hens are bothersome  enough at their best, but when they can talk they're simply dreadful.\"    \"Billina's my friend,\" said Dorothy quietly.  \"She may not always be  'zactly polite; but she MEANS well, I'm sure.\"          16.  Purple, Green, and Gold      The yellow hen, stepping high and with an air of vast importance,  walked slowly over the rich velvet carpets of the splendid palace,  examining everything she met with her sharp little eyes.    Billina had a right to feel important; for she alone shared the Nome  King's secret and knew how to tell the objects that were  transformations from those that had never been alive.  She was very  sure that her guesses would be correct, but before she began to make  them she was curious to behold all the magnificence of this underground  palace, which was perhaps one of the most splendid and beautiful places  in any fairyland.    As she went through the rooms she counted the purple ornaments; and  although some were small and hidden in queer places, Billina spied them  all, and found the entire ten scattered about the various rooms.  The  green ornaments she did not bother to count, for she thought she could  find them all when the time came.    Finally, having made a survey of the entire palace and enjoyed its  splendor, the yellow hen returned to one of the rooms where she had  noticed a large purple footstool.  She placed a claw upon this and said  \"Ev,\" and at once the footstool vanished and a lovely lady, tall and  slender and most beautifully robed, stood before her.    The lady's eyes were round with astonishment for a moment, for she  could not remember her transformation, nor imagine what had restored  her to life.    \"Good morning, ma'am,\" said Billina, in her sharp voice.  \"You're  looking quite well, considering your age.\"    \"Who speaks?\" demanded the Queen of Ev, drawing herself up proudly.    \"Why, my name's Bill, by rights,\" answered the hen, who was now perched  upon the back of a chair; \"although Dorothy has put scollops on it and  made it Billina.  But the name doesn't matter.  I've saved you from the  Nome King, and you are a slave no longer.\"    \"Then I thank you for the gracious favor,\" said the Queen, with a  graceful courtesy.  \"But, my children--tell me, I beg of you--where are  my children?\" and she clasped her hands in anxious entreaty.    \"Don't worry,\" advised Billina, pecking at a tiny bug that was crawling  over the chair back.  \"Just at present they are out of mischief and  perfectly safe, for they can't even wiggle.\"    \"What mean you, O kindly stranger?\" asked the Queen, striving to  repress her anxiety.    \"They're enchanted,\" said Billina, \"just as you have been--all, that  is, except the little fellow Dorothy picked out.  And the chances are  that they have been good boys and girls for some time, because they  couldn't help it.\"    \"Oh, my poor darlings!\" cried the Queen, with a sob of anguish.    \"Not at all,\" returned the hen.  \"Don't let their condition make you  unhappy, ma'am, because I'll soon have them crowding 'round to bother  and worry you as naturally as ever.  Come with me, if you please, and  I'll show you how pretty they look.\"    She flew down from her perch and walked into the next room, the Queen  following.  As she passed a low table a small green grasshopper caught  her eye, and instantly Billina pounced upon it and snapped it up in her  sharp bill.  For grasshoppers are a favorite food with hens, and they  usually must be caught quickly, before they can hop away.  It might  easily have been the end of Ozma of Oz, had she been a real grasshopper  instead of an emerald one.  But Billina found the grasshopper hard and  lifeless, and suspecting it was not good to eat she quickly dropped it  instead of letting it slide down her throat.    \"I might have known better,\" she muttered to herself, \"for where there  is no grass there can be no live grasshoppers.  This is probably one of  the King's transformations.\"    A moment later she approached one of the purple ornaments, and while  the Queen watched her curiously the hen broke the Nome King's  enchantment and a sweet-faced girl, whose golden hair fell in a cloud  over her shoulders, stood beside them.    \"Evanna!\" cried the Queen, \"my own Evanna!\" and she clasped the girl to  her bosom and covered her face with kisses.    \"That's all right,\" said Billina, contentedly.  \"Am I a good guesser,  Mr. Nome King?  Well, I guess!\"    Then she disenchanted another girl, whom the Queen addressed as Evrose,  and afterwards a boy named Evardo, who was older than his brother  Evring.  Indeed, the yellow hen kept the good Queen exclaiming and  embracing for some time, until five Princesses and four Princes, all  looking very much alike except for the difference in size, stood in a  row beside their happy mother.    The Princesses were named, Evanna, Evrose, Evella, Evirene and Evedna,  while the Princes were Evrob, Evington, Evardo and Evroland.  Of these  Evardo was the eldest and would inherit his father's throne and be  crowned King of Ev when he returned to his own country.  He was a grave  and quiet youth, and would doubtless rule his people wisely and with  justice.    Billina, having restored all of the royal family of Ev to their proper  forms, now began to select the green ornaments which were the  transformations of the people of Oz.  She had little trouble in finding  these, and before long all the twenty-six officers, as well as the  private, were gathered around the yellow hen, joyfully congratulating  her upon their release.  The thirty-seven people who were now alive in  the rooms of the palace knew very well that they owed their freedom to  the cleverness of the yellow hen, and they were earnest in thanking her  for saving them from the magic of the Nome King.    \"Now,\" said Billina, \"I must find Ozma.  She is sure to be here,  somewhere, and of course she is green, being from Oz.  So look around,  you stupid soldiers, and help me in my search.\"    For a while, however, they could discover nothing more that was green.  But the Queen, who had kissed all her nine children once more and could  now find time to take an interest in what was going on, said to the hen:    \"Mayhap, my gentle friend, it is the grasshopper whom you seek.\"    \"Of course it's the grasshopper!\" exclaimed Billina.  \"I declare, I'm  nearly as stupid as these brave soldiers.  Wait here for me, and I'll  go back and get it.\"    So she went into the room where she had seen the grasshopper, and  presently Ozma of Oz, as lovely and dainty as ever, entered and  approached the Queen of Ev, greeting her as one high born princess  greets another.    \"But where are my friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman?\" asked  the girl Ruler, when these courtesies had been exchanged.    \"I'll hunt them up,\" replied Billina.  \"The Scarecrow is solid gold,  and so is Tiktok; but I don't exactly know what the Tin Woodman is,  because the Nome King said he had been transformed into something  funny.\"    Ozma eagerly assisted the hen in her quest, and soon the Scarecrow and  the machine man, being ornaments of shining gold, were discovered and  restored to their accustomed forms.  But, search as they might, in no  place could they find a funny ornament that might be the transformation  of the Tin Woodman.    \"Only one thing can be done,\" said Ozma, at last, \"and that is to  return to the Nome King and oblige him to tell us what has become of  our friend.\"    \"Perhaps he won't,\" suggested Billina.    \"He"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48991"],[0,"Leyte: The Return to the Philippines (#18)"],[1,"the  movement of the main portion of the convoy.    Company B of the 6th Rangers was to have landed on Homonhon Island at  the same time landings were made on Suluan and Dinagat. Its mission,  too, was the emplacement of a navigation light, but bad weather  and choppy seas kept the troops confined to the ship throughout the  17th. [194] On the morning of the 18th, the ship's address system  clanged out general quarters. The men went below, put on their gear,  and checked their weapons. At 0900 the troops were told to prepare to  disembark. They bolted up the ladders and spilled out over the deck to  the davits. [195] The boats were lowered and the first wave started for  the beach. At the same time the guns from the destroyer and frigate  which had escorted the transport concentrated fire against the shore  line for twelve minutes. Three minutes later, the boats grounded on a  coral reef forty yards from the beach, and the men waded the remaining  distance to shore. They encountered no resistance and at 1038 the  company commander, Capt. Arthur D. Simons, notified the battalion  commander, \"Beachhead secured, supplies ashore. No resistance. No  casualties.\" [196] The company set up a channel light.    By 18 October, steady white lights were beaming from Dinagat and  Homonhon Islands to guide the convoy in to Leyte Island. The one  on Dinagat had a visibility of twelve miles and that on Homonhon a  visibility of ten. [197]        Mine Sweeping    The mine-sweeping plans contemplated that the mine-sweeping group  would arrive on 17 October simultaneously with the troops that were  to storm Suluan, Dinagat, and Homonhon Islands. On 11 October the  slow-moving mine sweepers lifted anchor at Manus and departed for the  objective area. They rendezvoused near the Palaus with the Dinagat  force, which had left Hollandia on 12 October. On 15 October they were  joined by the carriers and the beach demolition and bombardment and  fire support groups which had sortied from Manus on 12 October. On  14 October information was received from guerrilla sources that  there were no underwater obstacles off the beaches between Abuyog  and Tacloban. Although the northern Surigao Strait was mined, it was  considered doubtful whether the same condition existed at the southern  entrances of Leyte Gulf. [198] The mine-sweeping groups that had left  Hollandia on 11 October arrived in Leyte Gulf during the storm of the  evening of 16 October. Some of the mine sweepers had been delayed  by the storm but were able to arrive in time to begin sweeping the  channels. [199]    In the early dawn of 17 October the mine sweepers began their work  on the channel approaches to Suluan Island. [200] By 0630 they had  accomplished their task and then began to sweep the waters of the  landing areas in Leyte Gulf until the storm forced them to suspend  operations. At 1259 they resumed sweeping with great difficulty. Until  A Day, intensive area and tactical mine sweeping continued. The  sweepers started at dawn each day and worked continuously until  nightfall. By 19 October it was known that the Japanese had heavily  mined the approaches to Leyte Gulf but that there were no mines  within the gulf itself. The northern part of the main channel into  the gulf, however, was not considered safe. [201] By the same date  sweeping had been completed in the southern half, 186 mines having  been destroyed. At about 0135 on 19 October, the destroyer supporting  the mine-sweeping units which were in the gulf struck a floating mine  and while maneuvering away from the area struck another. The ship  was disabled and retired from action. By A Day, a total of 227 mines  had been destroyed and a passage approximately six miles wide had  been cleared just north of Dinagat Island. All ships were therefore  directed to enter Leyte Gulf through that portion of the strait. [202]    As the mine sweepers came close to the land, boats containing Filipinos  moved out to welcome the advance party of liberators. The reception  they met was not enthusiastic. Admiral Oldendorf, the commanding  officer of the bombardment and fire support group, \"suspected that  some might have come seeking information so detained them aboard  their respective ships.... Directed no further patriots be taken  aboard ship.\" [203]        Underwater Demolition Teams    The naval plans for the amphibious phase of the operation contemplated  the use of seven underwater demolition teams--three to cover the  northern coast beaches and four to cover the southern beaches. The  teams, starting A minus 2 (18 October), were to locate underwater  obstructions and detonate mines. On 18 and 19 October the underwater  demolition teams made a reconnaissance of the landing areas,  accompanied by destroyers which bombarded the shores. The two days'  reconnaissance disclosed no underwater obstacles or mines in the  vicinity of the proposed landing beaches.          The Convoy Enters Leyte Gulf    By the evening of 19 October the preliminary operations were almost  completed. The beaches had been surveyed and found suitable for  landing; mines had been cleared from most of the main approach channel;  and the entrances to Leyte Gulf had been secured. [204]    All ships were to be prepared to attach paravanes (mine-cable cutting  devices) on signal at any time after noon on 19 October. [205] Since  the mine sweepers had not sufficiently cleared the gulf, paravanes were  attached preparatory to entering it. The mine sweepers were to have  escorted the convoy into the area, but since they would not be ready  for about two hours, the entry was ordered to be made without them. The  convoy hugged the Dinagat shore line so closely that the distance from  the center of the formation to the shore was only 3,800 yards. [206]  Some of the ships did not see the signal light which had been placed  on Dinagat Island by the 6th Rangers and were delayed on that account.    The convoy advanced without incident toward the target area. On the  18th Admiral Kinkaid radioed General MacArthur that the operations  were going well, though the storm had somewhat delayed matters, and  the General was made \"welcome to our city.\" [207] MacArthur in reply  said that he was \"glad indeed to be in your domicile and under your  flag. It gives me not only confidence but a sense of inspiration,\"  and, probably thinking of the many arduous months of planning and  amphibious operations, he added, \"As Ripley says believe it or not  we are almost there.\" [208]    As the convoy came ever closer to the target, the atmosphere aboard  the vessels became more and more tense. By 1800 on 19 October most of  the vessels had arrived outside the gulf. The Far Shore was now near  and could be seen vaguely in the distance. On board one of the vessels  Protestant and Catholic evening prayers were broadcast over the address  system. Some of the men felt that it gave them a lift, but many felt  that they were being administered the last rites of their church. [209]    All vessels arrived on schedule. Because the mine barrier in the  entrance had not been completely cleared, the ships entered the  gulf somewhat to the south of the center of the entrance, avoiding  the main channel and keeping close to the northern point of Dinagat  Island. Fears that strong ebb tides might impede progress of the  slower vessels through the entrance proved groundless. Paravanes  were retained until arrival in the transport areas, but no mines were  encountered. [210]    Naval plans called for bombardment of the enemy-held shores on A minus  2 (18 October), but because the water areas had not been completely  swept for mines by that time, ships could not reach the bombardment  area. On A minus 1, bombardment was chiefly for the purpose of  providing effective support and coverage for the underwater demolition  teams. However, many of the defenses and installations of the enemy  on or near the landing beaches, including buildings and supply dumps,  were neutralized or destroyed.    By the afternoon of 19 October, when it had become apparent to the  Japanese that the Americans had returned to the Philippine Islands,  General Suzuki put his defense plan into effect. He ordered the  16th Division to annihilate the American force, and, failing that,  to interfere as much as possible with the use of Leyte airfields by  the American Army. The mobile units, including two battalions from the  30th Division, were to speed to Leyte as fast as possible. Finally,  the headquarters of the 35th Army was to move to Ormoc on the west  coast of Leyte on the 23d or 24th of October. [211]    Through the night of 19-20 October, destroyers near the shore continued  to shell the Japanese forces on land. The American forces were safely  within Leyte Gulf--A Day had arrived.                  CHAPTER V    A Day: 20 October 1944      Bombardment of the Shores of Leyte    The waters of Leyte Gulf were glassy calm as the convoys bearing the  assault forces steamed into their appointed positions off the shores  of Leyte in the very early morning hours of 20 October 1944.    There were three stages of the naval gunfire support: the pre-A-Day  bombardment, A-Day bombardment, and close supporting missions to be  delivered after H Hour and to continue until 24 October. A portion of  the fire support group in support of the underwater demolition teams  had bombarded the southern landing beaches and the town of Dulag  on 18 October, a process which was repeated on the following day in  support of the underwater demolition teams on the northern landing  beaches. [212]    At 0600 on A Day, 20 October, the battleships assigned to the  Southern Attack Force opened fire on the beaches. A lone Japanese  plane appeared at 0612 over the northern beaches, circled the convoy,  and despite gunfire from the Maryland and West Virginia disappeared  unscathed. [213] At 0700 the battleships of the Northern Attack Force  commenced firing. For "]]]
