NOTICE.      OWING to circumstances beyond the control of the Committee of  Publication, or of the Committees on the Pedigrees of the various  classes of stock, it has been impossible to publish the first volume of  the Herd Record of the Association of Breeders of Thorough-bred Neat  Stock at an earlier day. The desire to obtain as large a representation  of stock as possible, and to extend the advantages of the Association as  widely among breeders as they could, has induced the committees on the  various classes of stock to hold open their books and the delays  incident upon tracing doubtful pedigrees, through in many instances a  long correspondence with owners and breeders, have prevented them from  furnishing the copy to the Publication Committee, in season to have the  work finished sooner. Every care has been taken to have the records  perfect, and to admit no pedigrees of doubtful character. It is believed  this has been successfully accomplished, and that the animals here  recorded may be relied upon as of undoubted purity of blood.                                       H. A.

THE Committee appointed to examine and prepare for publication pedigrees  of Ayrshire Stock, having completed their labors, offer the following as  their Report.    In arranging the pedigrees, we have endeavored to render them simple and  exact, and to trace each animal to a direct importation. In a few  instances this latter has been impossible, and we have been obliged to  be content with tracing the pedigrees to the herds of well known  breeders, having their assurances that the animals in question were  thorough-bred Ayrshire.    Many breeders, who have taken the utmost pains, and have been at great  expense to keep their herds pure, have not been careful to keep accurate  records of the pedigrees of their stock, feeling that as long as they  themselves were satisfied, their assurances would be sufficient to  convince purchasers. This course answered when there were but few cattle  of this breed in the country, and the necessity of an organized effort  to preserve the purity of the blood had not been recognized; but  hereafter it is hoped that every one liberal enough to breed  thorough-bred stock, will see the advantages and the necessity of a  record of pedigrees, and assist in swelling the next edition of the  work, to a size more nearly commensurate with the importance of the  subject.    The Committee thought best to have a short history of the Ayrshires,  together with the points given by the Ayrshire Agricultural  Association, printed as an introduction to the work, and applied to  Sanford Howard, Esq., of Boston, who kindly consented to write"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35450"],[0,"Our Cats and All About Them (#18)"],[1,"pigeon fancier by way of analogy, take, as  an instance, what is termed the silver-coloured pigeon, or the yellow.  These two, and duns, are, by loss of certain pigments, differently  coloured and constituted (like the tortoiseshell among cats) from other  varieties of pigeons of harder colours, such as blues, and blacks, or  even reds. For a long time silver turbit cock pigeons were so scarce  that, until I bred some myself, I had never seen such a thing; yet hens  were common enough, and got from silver and blues. In the nestling  before the feathers come, the young of these colours are without down,  and are thus thought to be, and doubtless are, a weakly breed; yet there  is no absolute diminution of strength, beyond that of colour, when  silver is matched to silver; but dun with dun, these last go lower in  the scale, losing the black tint, and not unfrequently the colour is  yellow; or, matched with black, breed true blacks. I am, therefore, of  opinion that a tortoiseshell male and female would, and should, produce  the best of tortoiseshells, both male and female.    It not unfrequently happens that from a tortoiseshell mother, in the  litter of kittens there are male blacks and clear whites, and I have  known of one case when a good blue and one where the mixed colours were  blue, light red, and light yellow were produced, while the sisters in  the litter were of the usual pure tortoiseshell markings. In such cases,  generally, the latter only are kept, unless it is the blue, the others  being too often destroyed. My own plan would be to breed from such black  or white males, and if not successful in the first attempt, to breed  again in the same way with the young obtained with such cross; and I  have but little doubt that, by so doing, the result so long sought after  would be achieved. At least, I deem it far more likely to be so than the  present plan of using the red tabby as the male, which are easily  produced, though very few are of high excellence in richness of ground  tints.      TORTOISESHELL-AND-WHITE.    If tortoiseshell-and-white are desired, then a black-and-white male may  be selected, being bred in the same way as those recommended for the  pure tortoiseshell, or one without white if the female has white; but on  _no account_ should an ordinary tabby be tolerated, but a red tabby  female of deep colour, or having white, may be held in request, though  I would prefer patches of colour not in any way barred. The gray tabby  will throw barred, spotted, or banded kittens, mixed with tortoiseshell,  which is the very worst form of mottling, and is very difficult to  eradicate. A gray \"ticking\" will most likely appear between the dark  colour, as it does between the black bars of the tabby.      BLACK.    The best black, undoubtedly, are those bred from tortoiseshell mothers  or females. The black is generally more dense, and less liable to show  any signs of spots, bands, or bars, when the animal is in the sun or a  bright light; when this is so, it is fatal to a black as regards its  chance of a prize, or even notice, and it comes under the denomination  of a black tabby.    If a black and a white cat are mated, let the black be the male, blacks  having more stamina, the issue will probably be either white or black;  and also when you wish the black to be perpetuated, the black male must  be younger. In 1884, a black female cat was exhibited with five white  kittens. I have just seen a beautiful black Persian whose mother was a  clear white; this, and the foregoing example, prove either colour  represents the same for the purpose of breeding to colour.    For breeding black with white, take care that the white is the  gray-white, and not the yellow-white; the first generally has orange or  yellow eyes, and this is one of the required qualities in the black cat.  If a yellow-white with blue eyes, this type of eye would be detrimental,  and most likely the eyes of the offspring would have a green stain, or  possibly be of odd colours.    It should be borne in mind, that black kittens are seldom or ever so  rich in colour when newly born, as they afterwards become; therefore, if  without spots or bars, and of a deep self brown-black, they will in all  possibility be fine in colour when they gain their adult coat. This the  experienced fancier well knows, though the tyro often destroys that  which will ultimately prove of value, simply from ignorance. An instance  of the brown-black kitten is before me as I write, in a beautiful  Persian, which is now changing from the dull kitten self brown-black on  to a brilliant glossy, jetty beauty.      BLUES.    Blue in cats is one of the most extraordinary colours of any, for the  reason that it is the _mixture_ of black which is no colour, and white  which is no colour, and this is the more curious because black mated  with white generally produces either one colour or the other, or breaks  black and white, or white and black. The blue being, as it were, a  weakened black, or a withdrawal by white of some, if not all, of the  brown or red, varying in tint according to the colour of the black from  which it was bred, dark-gray, or from weakness in the stamina of the  litter. In the human species an alliance of the Negro, or African race,  and the European, produces the mulatto, and some other shades of  coloured skin, though the hair generally retains the black hue; but  seldom or ever are the colours broken up as in animal life, the only  instance that has come to my knowledge, and I believe on record, being  that of the spotted Negro boy, exhibited at fairs in England by  Richardson, the famous showman; but in this case both the parents were  black, and natives of South Africa. The boy arrived in England in  September, 1809, and died February, 1813. His skin and hair were  everywhere parti-coloured, transparent brown and white; on the crown of  his head several triangles, one within the other, were formed by  alternations of the colour of the hair.    In other domestic animals blue colour is not uncommon. Blue-tinted dogs,  rabbits, horses of a blue-gray, or spotted with blue on a pink flesh  colour, as in the naked horse shown at the Crystal Palace some years  ago, also pigs; and all these have likewise broken colours of blue, or  black, and white. I do not remember having seen any blue cattle, nor any  blue guinea-pigs, but no doubt these latter will soon exist. When once  the colour or break from the black is acquired, it is then easy to go on  multiplying the different shades and varieties of tint and tone, from  the dark blue-black to the very light, almost white-gray. In some places  in Russia, I am told, blue cats are exceedingly common; I have seen  several shown under the names of Archangel, and others as Chartreuse and  Maltese cats. Persians are imported sometimes of this colour, both dark  and light. Next kin to it is the very light-gray tabby, with almost the  same hue, if not quite so light-gray markings. Two such mated have been  known to produce very light self grays, and of a lovely hue, a sort of  \"morning gray\"; these matched with black should breed blues. Old male  black, and young female white cats, have been known to produce kittens  this colour. There is a colony of farm cats at Rodmell, Sussex, from  which very fine blues are bred. Light silver tabby males, and white  females, are also apt to have one or so in a litter of kittens; but  these generally are not such good blues, the colour being a gray-white,  or nearly so, should the hair or coat be parted or divided, the skin  being light. The very dark, if from brown-black, are not so blue, but  come under the denomination of \"smokies,\" or blue \"smokies,\" with  scarcely a tint of blue in them; some \"smokies\" are white, or nearly so,  with dark tips to the hair; these more often occur among Persian than  English cats, though I once had a smoky tabby bred from a black and a  silver tabby. Importations of some of the former are often extremely  light, scarcely showing any markings. These, and such as these, are very  valuable where a self blue is desired. If these light colours are  females, a smoke-coloured male is an excellent cross, as it already  shows a weakened colour. For a very light, tender, delicate, light-gray  long-haired self, I should try a white male, and either a rich blue, or  a soft gray, extremely lightly-marked tabby.    As a rule, all broken whites, such as black and white, should be  avoided; because, as I explained at the commencement of these notes on  blues, the blue is black and white _amalgamated_, or the brown withdrawn  from the colouring, or, if not, with the colours breaking, or becoming  black and white. If whole coloured blues are in request, then  parti-colours, such as white and black, or black and white, are best  excluded. Blue and white are easily attainable by mating a blue male  with a white and black female.    The best and deepest coloured of the blue short-haired cats are from  Archangel. Those I have seen were very fine in colour, the pelage being  the same colour to the skin, which was also dark and of a uniform  lilac-tinted blue. Some come by chance. I knew of a blue English cat,  winner of several prizes, whose parents were a black and white male  mated with a \"light-gray tabby\" and white; but this was an exception to  the rule, for strongly-marked tabbies are not a good cross.      BROWN TABBY.    For the purpose of breeding rich brown black-striped tabbies, a male of  a rich dark rufous or red tabby should be selected, the bands being  regular and not too broad, the lighter or ground colour showing well  between the lines; if the black lines are very broad, it is then a  black, striped with brown, instead of a brown with black, which is  wrong. With this match a female of a good brown ground colour, marked  with dense, not broad, black bands, having clear, sharply defined edges.  Note also that the centre line of the back is "]]]
