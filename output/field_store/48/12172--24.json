TESTIMONY OF BENJAMIN F. JOHNSON                                     Mesa City, Arizona, 9th March, 1904.    _President Joseph F. Smith_,    _Washington, D. C_.    My Dear Brother:--    In reading reports from the Senate Committee on the Reed Smoot case,  I see that witnesses are subpoenaed to prove that the Prophet Joseph  Smith did not authorize or practice polygamy; and I do know that he did  teach plural marriage, and that he did give to me a plural wife who is  still living with me, and that I saw one of my sisters married to him.  * * *    And I do know that at his Mansion House was living Mariah and Sarah  Lawrence and one of Cornelius P. Lott's daughters as his plural wives  with the full knowledge of his wife, Emma, of the married relations to  him.    At that time I was his legal business agent at Macedonia or Ramtis,  and was familiar with his family or domestic affairs; and occupying,  as I did, the family mansion often in a business way with Emma, the  Prophet's first wife, who at no time did ever in my hearing deny the  plural character of her husband's family.    And now with this and much more knowledge relating to this subject,  could my evidence before the Senate Committee be of any real value to  the cause of truth? If so, although too infirm to travel alone I would  willingly try to be there, if according to your counsel and wish.    Loyal to the truth, I am,                                 Always brother,                                                     B. F. Johnson.      THE CELESTIAL AND PLURAL MARRIAGE REVELATION    The following letter was written by Elder William Clayton who wrote the  revelation known as section 132 in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants,  at the direction of the Prophet Joseph Smith, July 12, 1843.[3]        Salt Lake City, Nov, 11, 1871.        _Madison M. Scott, Esq_.        Dear Sir:        Your letter of 23rd of June last, was received by due course of      mail, but owing to my being so very closely confined with public      duties, which has almost destroyed my health, I have not answered      your letter so promptly as is my practice. My health is yet very      poor, but I have resigned the office which was bearing so heavy      upon me, and am in hopes to regain my usual sound health.        Now, in regard to the subject matter of your letter, it appears to      me that the principal topic is what is commonly called polygamy,      but which I prefer to call celestial marriage. As to young Joseph      saying that the Church here have apostatized; that _we_ have      introduced polygamy, denying bitterly that his father ever had a      revelation on the subject, that is all mere bosh! I _believe_ he      knows better, and I have often felt sorry to learn that the sons      of the Prophet should spend their time in contending against a      pure and holy principle which their father's blood was shed to      establish. They will have a heavy atonement to make when they meet      their father in the next world. They are in the hands of God, and      my respect for their father will not permit me to say much about      the wicked course of his sons.        _Now, I say to you, as I am ready to testify to all the world, and      on which testimony I am most willing to meet all the Latter-day      Saints and all apostates, in time and through all eternity, I did      write the revelations on celestial marriage given through the      Prophet Joseph Smith, on the 12th of July, 1843_.        When the revelation was written there was no one present except the      Prophet Joseph, his brother Hyrum and myself. It was written in the      small office upstairs in the rear of the brick store which stood      on the banks of the Mississippi river. It took some three hours to      write it. Joseph dictated sentence by sentence, and I wrote it as      he dictated. After the whole was written Joseph requested me to      read it slowly and carefully, which I did, and he then pronounced      it correct. The same night a copy was taken by Bishop Whitney,      which copy is now here (in the Historian's office) and which I know      and testify is correct. The original was destroyed by Emma Smith.        I again testify that the revelation on polygamy was given through      the prophet Joseph on the 12th July, 1843; and that the Prophet      Joseph both taught and practiced polygamy I do positively know,      and bear testimony to the fact. In April, 1843, he sealed to me my      second wife, my first wife being then living. By my said second      wife I had two sons born in Nauvoo. The first died; the second is      here now, and is married.        I had the honor to seal one woman[4] to Joseph under his direction.      I could name ten or a dozen of his wives who are now living in      this territory, so that for any man to tell me that Joseph did not      teach polygamy, he is losing his time, for I know better. It is      not hearsay, nor opinion with me, for I positively know of what I      speak, and I testify to the truth, and shall be willing to meet all      opponents on the subject through all eternity.        As to the Church here having apostatized that is all a mere      matter of assertion, destitute of truth. President Young and his      associates are, and have been doing everything they can to carry      out the plans and instructions of the Prophet Joseph, and so      eternity will prove to the condemnation and confusion of all their      enemies. Any one who says to the contrary does not know Joseph nor      the mission the Lord gave him to fulfill. * * *                                                Truly yours,                                                     William Clayton.      AFFIDAVIT OF HOWARD CORAY    Territory of Utah, County of Salt Lake. ss.    As many false statements have been made in relation to the authorship  of the revelation on celestial marriage, I deem it but justice to all  lovers of truth for me to express what I know concerning this very  important matter.

It  has had a marvelous history, and a wonderful growth. Never so strong,  or so well equipped, as now, its future is rife with glorious promise.    Epitome of Church Government.--The Aaronic Priesthood administers in  all outward ordinances, such as baptism, the sacrament of the Lord's  supper, etc. The higher ordinances, such as confirmations, sealings,  adoptions, and other ceremonies of the Temple, must be administered by  the Priesthood of Melchizedek.    The offices of the Aaronic Priesthood, graded upward, are deacon,  teacher and priest, and the presidency of that priesthood is the  bishopric. The bishop has charge of the Church property, and he  receives and disburses the tithes, fast offerings, and other revenues,  under the direction of the higher authorities. There is a presiding  bishopric, who have general charge of the funds provided for the  support of the poor, for the building of temples, and for other  purposes. They also have in custody the general financial records of  the Church. A bishop must either be a lineal descendant of Aaron, in  which event he can act without counselors, or he must be a high priest  after the order of Melchizedek, having as his counselors two other  high priests of that order. Under the jurisdiction of the presiding  bishopric, in temporal matters, are the bishoprics of the wards. The  ward is a division of the stake, as the stake is a division of the  Church.    A stake, in territorial extent, often corresponds to a county, though  in populous districts there may be several stakes in one county. There  are four stakes in Salt Lake City. Each stake has a presidency of three  and a high council of twelve, and these have jurisdiction over all  members and organizations in the stake, including the ward bishoprics.  The ward bishopric constitutes a court for the trial of members who  transgress the Church laws and regulations. From the decision of the  bishop's court either party in the case may appeal to the high council;  and from a decision of the high council an appeal may be taken to the  First Presidency, who review the evidence, and if any injustice has  been done, they remand the case for a new trial. If a President of the  Church were tried, it would have to be before \"the common council of  the Church,\" assisted by \"twelve counselors of the high priesthood.\"  The extreme penalty imposed by any Church tribunal is excommunication.    The Melchizedek Priesthood comprises, in an ascending scale, the  offices of elder, seventy, and high priest. There are also the callings  of patriarch, apostle, and president, who must all be high priests  after this order. Each specific body of high priests, seventies,  elders, priests, teachers, or deacons, is called a quorum, but most of  the general priesthood organizations are termed councils.    The Council of the First Presidency is composed of three, one of them  the President, and the other two his first and second counselors. These  three high priests preside over the entire Church. The President is  prophet, seer and revelator, and likewise trustee-in-trust for the  Church, holding the legal title to its property.    Next in authority to the First Presidency is the council of the twelve  apostles, whose special mission is to preach the gospel, or cause it to  be preached, in all nations. The apostles have the right to regulate  and set in order the Church throughout the world, but they act under  the direction of the First Presidency, and exercise presidential power  only in the absence of the higher council. The death of the President  of the Church dissolves the First Presidency, rendering necessary a  new organization of that council. It is the privilege of the apostles  to nominate the President of the Church, who then chooses his two  counselors.    Next to the twelve apostles stands the presiding patriarch; it is his  duty to bless the Church, to give individual blessings to its members,  and comfort them with spiritual ministrations. He also assists the  apostles in visiting the stakes, attending conferences, and performing  other duties as required.    Presiding over the great body of the seventies, are seven presidents,  known as the first council of the seventy. They are next in authority  to the council of the twelve. These seven, with the senior presidents  of the first sixty-three quorums of seventy, form a council equal in  authority to either of the two higher councils: but they can exercise  authority to the extent of presiding over the Church, only in the  absence of the First Presidency and the twelve apostles.    Next comes the presiding bishopric, already mentioned, composed of  three high priests, having jurisdiction over the temporalities of  the Church. The First Presidency, the twelve apostles, the presiding  patriarch, the first council of the seventy, and the presiding  bishopric, constitute the general authorities. The names of all general  officers, from the President down, are submitted to the general  conference, held twice a year, to be voted upon by the members of  the Church. They are also presented at the stake conferences, held  quarterly, to be voted upon, with the stake officers, in like manner.    Under the presidency and high council of each stake, are one or more  patriarchs, whose ministry, so far as blessings are concerned, is  similar to that of the presiding patriarch. They minister, however,  only in their own stakes. Each stake has a quorum of high priests,  indefinite in number, presided over by three of its members. The  high priesthood holds the inherent right of presidency, and it is  from the high priests that presidencies are selected, such as the  First Presidency, the council of the twelve, a stake presidency, or a  bishopric. While the seventies, as an entire body, are presided over  by their first council, they are divided into quorums of seventy,  each quorum having seven presidents of its own. The special duty of  the seventies is to assist the apostles in preaching the gospel, and  they labor under the direction of the twelve. Unlike the high priests,  elders, and lesser priesthood, the seventies are independent of the  jurisdiction of the stake presidency, as quorums, though not as  individual members. They are the \"minute men\" of the Church, subject to  sudden calls into the mission field. A stake has one or more quorums  of elders, each composed of ninety-six members, three of whom preside.  Each ward should have one or more quorums of priests (forty-eight),  teachers (twenty-four), and deacons (twelve), each with a presidency of  three. A ward bishopric presides in a general way over all the quorums  of the Aaronic Priesthood in the ward, and over all Church members, as  individuals, residing therein. The bishop of the ward is ex-officio  president of the priests' quorum.    The elder's office is the lowest in the Melchizedek Priesthood proper.  The duties of an elder are similar to those of a seventy, though they  are exercised more at home than abroad. Next under the office of elder,  is that of priest, the high est office in the Aaronic Priesthood,  excepting the bishop, who, however, is a priest, and officiates as such  when sitting as a judge, but as a high priest, in presiding over his  ward. The priest may preach, baptize, and administer the sacrament,  but has not the right to lay on hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.  That is a function of the Melchizedek Priesthood, to be exercised only  by the elders and those above them. The teacher is a peace-maker. It  is his duty to settle difficulties arising between Church members in  his district, or, if he cannot settle them, to report them to the  bishop under whose jurisdiction he labors. A ward is divided into  districts, and in each district two or more teachers labor regularly.  It is incumbent upon them to visit from house to house, to see that no  iniquity shall exist among the members, that they attend their meetings  faithfully, and do all things required by the laws and regulations of  the Church. The teachers report monthly, or as often as required, to  the bishopric. The deacons have charge of the ward property, and are to  assist the teachers, as the teachers assist the priests, when necessary.    There are at present sixty-five stakes of Zion, all located in the  region of the Rocky Mountains. Two of these stakes are in Canada,  and until recently there was another in Mexico. The stakes organized  in Ohio, Missouri, Illinois and Iowa, were abandoned when the Saints  were compelled to flee from their former homes. In addition to the  sixty-five stakes, there are twenty-one outside missions, comprising  most of the countries of the globe. There is also a central bureau of  information, at Salt Lake City, the headquarters of the Church. The  Latter-day Saints, in all the world, number about half a million.    All the organizations named are strictly within the place of the  Priesthood: but in addition there are auxiliary organizations, such  as Relief Societies, Sabbath Schools, Young Men's and Young Ladies'  Mutual Improvement Associations, Primary Associations, and Religion  Classes. The Relief Societies, which form a vast net-work over all the  stakes, wards, and most of the missions, are women's organizations,  for the care and comfort of the sick and the needy. The Deseret Sunday  School Union has a membership of over 150,000. The Mutual Improvement  Associations are what their name implies: the sexes meet separately,  except in monthly conjoint sessions, and study systematically religion,  history, philosophy, and the arts and sciences. The Primaries are for  the training of children too young for membership in the Mutuals; and  the Religion Classes are for special instruction to the youth of both  sexes.
