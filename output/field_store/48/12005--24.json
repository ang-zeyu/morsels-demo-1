For she is always there, in the few  observations which chance affords me. A subterranean excursion would not  attract the Wasp if it had no object. And its object is certainly the  search for some sort of game for her larvae. The inference becomes  inevitable: the Anathema Tachytes, who explores the Mole-cricket's  galleries, gives her larvae this same Mole-cricket as their food. Very  probably the specimen selected is a young one, for the adult insect  would be too big. Besides, to this consideration of quantity is added  that of quality. Young and tender flesh is highly appreciated, as  witness the Tarsal Tachytes, the Black Tachytes and the Mantis-killing  Tachytes, who all three select game that is not yet made tough by age.  It goes without saying that the moment the huntress emerged from the  ground I proceeded to dig up the track. The Mole-cricket was no longer  there. The Tachytes had come too late; and so had I.    Well, how right was I to define the Tachytes as a Locust lover! What  constancy in the gastronomic rules of the race! And what tact in varying  the game, while keeping within the order of the Orthoptera! What have  the Locust, the Cricket, the Praying Mantis and the Mole-cricket in  common, as regards their general appearance? Why, absolutely nothing!  None of us, if he were unfamiliar with the delicate associations  dictated by anatomy, would think of classing them together. The  Tachytes, on the other hand, makes no mistake. Guided by her instinct,  which rivals the science of a Latreille, she groups them all  together. (Pierre Andre Latreille (1762-1833), one of the founders of  entomological science, a professor at the Musee d'histoire naturelle and  member of the Academie des sciences.--Translator's Note.)    This instinctive taxonomy becomes more surprising still if we consider  the variety of the game stored in a single burrow. The Mantis-killing  Tachytes, for instance, preys indiscriminately upon all the Mantides  that occur in her neighbourhood. I see her warehousing three of them,  the only varieties, in fact, that I know in my district. They are the  following: the Praying Mantis (M. religiosa, LIN.), the Grey Mantis  (Ameles decolor, CHARP. (Cf. \"The Life of the Grasshopper\": chapter  10.--Translator's Note.)) and the Empusa (E. pauperata, LATR. (Cf. idem:  chapter 9.--Translator's Note.)). The numerical predominance in the  Tachytes' cells belongs to the Praying Mantis; and the Grey Mantis  occupies second place. The Empusa, who is comparatively rare on the  brushwood in the neighbourhood, is also rare in the store-houses of the  Wasp; nevertheless her presence is repeated often enough to show that  the huntress appreciates the value of this prey when she comes across  it. The three sorts of game are in the larval state, with rudimentary  wings. Their dimensions, which vary a good deal, fluctuate between  two-fifths and four-fifths of an inch in length.    The Praying Mantis is a bright green; she boasts an elongated prothorax  and an alert gait. The other Mantis is ash-grey. Her prothorax is short  and her movements heavy. The coloration therefore is no guide to the  huntress, any more than the gait. The green and the grey, the swift  and the slow are unable to baffle her perspicacity. To her, despite the  great difference in appearance, the two victims are Mantes. And she is  right.    But what are we to say of the Empusa? The insect world, at all events in  our parts, contains no more fantastic creature. The children here, who  are remarkable for finding names which really depict the animal, call  the larva \"the Devilkin.\" It is indeed a spectre, a diabolical phantom  worthy of the pencil of a Callot. (Jacques Callot (1592-1635), the  French engraver and painter, famous for the grotesque nature of his  subjects.--Translator's Note.) There is nothing to beat it in the  extravagant medley of figures in his \"Temptation of Saint Anthony.\" Its  flat abdomen, scalloped at the edges, rises into a twisted crook; its  peaked head carries on the top two large, divergent, tusk-shaped horns;  its sharp, pointed face, which can turn and look to either side,  would fit the wily purpose of some Mephistopheles; its long legs have  cleaver-like appendages at the joints, similar to the arm-pieces which  the knights of old used to bear upon their elbows. Perched high upon the  shanks of its four hind-legs, with its abdomen curled, its thorax raised  erect, its front-legs, the traps and implements of warfare, folded  against its chest, it sways limply from side to side, on the tip of the  bough.    Any one seeing it for the first time in its grotesque pose will give  a start of surprise. The Tachytes knows no such alarm. If she catches  sight of it, she seizes it by the neck and stabs it. It will be a treat  for her children. How does she manage to recognize in this spectre the  near relation of the Praying Mantis? When frequent hunting-expeditions  have familiarized her with the last-named and suddenly, in the midst of  the chase, she encounters the Devilkin, how does she become aware that  this strange find makes yet another excellent addition to her larder?  This question, I fear, will never receive an adequate reply. Other  huntresses have already set us the problem; others will set it to us  again. I shall return to it, not to solve it, but to show even more  plainly how obscure and profound it is. But we will first complete the  story of the Mantis-killing Tachytes.    The colony which forms the subject of my investigations is established  in a mound of fine sand which I myself cut into, a couple of years ago,  in order to unearth a few Bembex larvae. The entrances to the Tachytes'  dwelling open upon the little upright bank of the section. At the  beginning of July the work is in full swing. It must have been going on  already for a week or two, for I find very forward larvae, as well as  recent cocoons. There are here, digging into the sand or returning from  expeditions with their booty, some hundred females, whose burrows, all  very close to one another, cover an area of barely a square yard. This  hamlet, small in extent, but nevertheless densely populated, shows us  the Mantis-slayer under a moral aspect which is not shared by the Locust  slayer, Panzer's Tachytes, who resembles her so closely in costume.  Though engaged in individual tasks, the first seeks the society of her  kind, as do certain of the Sphex-wasps, while the second establishes  herself in solitude, after the fashion of the Ammophila. Neither the  personal form nor the nature of the occupation determines sociability.    Crouching voluptuously in the sun, on the sand at the foot of the bank,  the males lie waiting for the females, to plague them as they pass. They  are ardent lovers, but cut a poor figure. Their linear dimensions  are barely half those of the other sex, which implies a volume only  one-eighth as great. At a short distance they appear to wear on their  heads a sort of gaudy turban. At close quarters this headgear is seen to  consist of the eyes, which are very large and a bright lemon-yellow and  which almost entirely surround the head.    At ten o'clock in the morning, when the heat begins to grow intolerable  to the observer, there is a continual coming and going between the  burrows and the tufts of grass, everlasting, thyme and wormwood, which  constitute the Tachytes' hunting-grounds within a moderate radius. The  journey is so short that the Wasp brings her game home on the wing,  usually in a single flight. She holds it by the fore-part, a very  judicious precaution, which is favourable to rapid stowage in the  warehouse, for then the Mantis' legs stretch backwards, along the axis  of the body, instead of folding and projecting sideways, when their  resistance would be difficult to overcome in a narrow gallery. The lanky  prey dangles beneath the huntress, all limp, lifeless and paralysed.  The Tachytes, still flying, alights on the threshold of the home and  immediately, contrary to the custom of Panzer's Tachytes, enters with  her prey trailing behind her. It is not unusual for a male to come upon  the scene at the moment of the mother's arrival. He is promptly snubbed.  This is the time for work, not for amusement. The rebuffed male  resumes his post as a watcher in the sun; and the housewife stows her  provisions.    But she does not always do so without hindrance. Let me recount one of  the misadventures of this work of storage. There is in the neighbourhood  of the burrows a plant which catches insects with glue. It is the Oporto  silene (S. portensis), a curious growth, a lover of the sea-side dunes,  which, though of Portuguese origin, as its name would seem to indicate,  ventures inland, even as far as my part of the country, where it  represents perhaps a survivor of the coastal flora of what was once a  Pliocene sea. The sea has disappeared; a few plants of its shores have  remained behind. This Silene carries in most of its internodes, in those  both of the branches and of the main stalk, a viscous ring, two- to  four-fifths of an inch wide, sharply delimited above and below. The  coating of glue is of a pale brown. Its stickiness is so great that the  least touch is enough to hold the object. I find Midges, Plant-lice and  Ants caught in it, as well as tufted seeds which have blown from the  capitula of the Cichoriaceae. A Gad-fly, as big as a Blue bottle, falls  into the trap before my eyes. She has barely alighted on the perilous  perch when lo, she is held by the hinder tarsi! The Fly makes violent  efforts to take wing; she shakes the slender plant from top to bottom.  If she frees her hinder tarsi she remains snared by the front tarsi  and has to begin all over again. I was doubting the possibility of her  escape when, after a good quarter of an hour's struggle, she succeeded  in extricating "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34645"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 3 (of 6) (#18)"],[1,"exaggeration, as there is  certainly much diversity of style and merit when compared with one  another. Among the leading disciples of Giorgione are to be ranked  three, who belong to the city or territory of Bergamo, and these are  Lotto, as is most generally supposed, Palma, and Cariani. They resemble  their master most frequently in fulness, but in the mixture and  selection of colours they often appear of the school of Lombardy. More  particularly in Cariani there is apparent a certain superficies, like  that of wax, equally diffused over the canvass, which shines so as to  enliven the eye; and when seen at a distance, with but little light,  appears in full relief, a result which others have also noticed in the  works of Coreggio.    The name of Lorenzo Lotto is recorded by Vasari and elsewhere, in which  accounts his country is considered as consisting of the entire state, as  he himself, indeed, affixed to his picture of S. Cristoforo di Loreto,  _Laurentius Lottus Pictor Venetus_.[43] The late annotator of Vasari,  observing the grace of countenance and the turn of the eyes remarkable  in his pictures, supposed him to be a disciple of Vinci, an opinion that  might be supported by the authority of Lomazzo, who mentions the names  of Cesare da Sesto and Lorenzo Lotto together, both being imitators, in  the distribution of their lights, of da Vinci. Lotto most likely  profited by his vicinity to Milan, in order to cultivate an acquaintance  with, and to imitate Vinci in many points; though I am not, therefore,  inclined to discredit the account which gives him for a pupil to  Bellini, and a rival to Castelfranco. But the style of the disciples of  Lionardo, so uniform in Luini and in the other Milanese, is very  slightly perceptible in the productions of Lotto. His manner is, in  truth, wholly Venetian, bold in its colours, luxurious in its draperies,  and like Giorgione, of a deep red in the fleshy parts. His hand,  however, is less bold and free than that of the latter, whose loftier  character he is fond of tempering with the play, as it were, of his  middle tints; selecting, at the same time, lighter forms, to whose heads  he gives a character more placid and a beauty more ideal. In the  background of his pictures he often retains a peculiar clear or azure  colour, which if it do not harmonize so much with the figures, confers  distinctness on each individual, and presents them in a very lively  manner to the eye. His pictures of S. Antonino, at the Dominicans in  Venice, and of S. Niccolo, at the Carmine, which design he repeated in  the S. Vincenzio of the Dominicans at Recanati, are compositions  extremely novel and original. In his others he varies little from the  usual style; that of a Madonna seated on a throne, surrounded with  saints, with cherubs in the air, or upon the steps. Yet these he  relieves by the novelty of perspective, or by attitudes, or contrasted  views. Thus in his specimen of the S. Bartolommeo, at Bergamo, entitled  by Ridolfi wonderful, he bestows upon the Virgin and the infant Jesus  such finely diversified and contrasted motions, that they seem as if  conversing with the holy bystanders, the one on the right and the other  on the left hand. And in that of S. Spirito, sparkling as it were with  graces, we meet with a figure of S. John the Baptist, drawn as a child,  standing at the foot of the throne, in the act of embracing a lamb, and  expressing so natural and lively a joy, at once so simple and innocent,  with a smile so beautiful, that we can hardly believe while we gaze upon  it, that Raffaello or Correggio could have gone beyond it.    Such masterpieces as these, with others that are to be seen at Bergamo,  in churches and private collections, place him almost on a level with  the first luminaries of the art. If Vasari did not fairly appreciate his  merits, it arose only from his having viewed several of his less studied  and less noble pieces. And it is true that he has not always exhibited  the same degree of excellence, or force of design. The period in which  he chiefly flourished may be computed from the year 1513, when he was  selected, among many professors of reputation, to adorn the altar for  the church of the Dominicans at Bergamo; and, perhaps, the decline of  his powers ought to be dated from 1546, an epoch inscribed upon his  picture of San Jacopo dell'Orio, in Venice. He was employed also at  Ancona, and in particular at the church of S. Dominico, at Recanati,  where, interspersed among pieces of superior power, more especially in  his smaller pictures, we detect some incorrectness in his extremities,  and stiffness of composition, resembling that of Gian Bellini; whether,  as it is conjectured by Vasari, they were among the earliest, or more  probably among some of his latest efforts. For it is well known, that  when far advanced in years, he was accustomed to retire to Loreto, a  little way from Recanati, and that engaged in continual supplication to  the Virgin, in order that she might guide him into a better method, he  there closed the period of his days in tranquillity.    Jacopo Palma, commonly called _Palma Vecchio_, to distinguish him from  his great-nephew Jacopo, was invariably considered the companion and  rival of Lotto, until such time as Combe first confused the historical  dates relating to him. By Ridolfi we are told that Palma employed  himself in completing a picture left imperfect by Titian, at the period  of his death in 1576. Upon this, and similar authorities, Combe takes  occasion to postpone the birth of Palma, until 1540; adding to which the  forty-eight years assigned him by Vasari, the time of his decease is  placed in 1588. In such arrangement the critic seems neither to have  paid attention to the style of Jacopo, still retaining some traces of  the antique, nor to the authority of Ridolfi, who makes him the master  of Bonifazio, any more than to Vasari's testimony, in the work published  in 1568, declaring him to have died several years before that period in  Venice. He does not even consider, what he might more easily have  ascertained, that there was another Jacopo Palma, great-nephew of the  elder, who, according to the authority of Boschini (p. 110), was a pupil  of Titian's as long as the latter survived; and that Ridolfi, on this  occasion, entitled him _Palma_, without the addition of _younger_, on  account of its being so extremely unlikely that any would confound him  with the elder Palma. Such, notwithstanding, was the case, and is, in  fact, only a slight sample of the inaccuracies of the whole work. The  same error has been repeated by too many authors, even among the  Italians; and the most amusing of all is, that Palma the elder is said  to have been born about the year 1540, while almost, in the same breath,  the younger Palma is declared to have been born in 1544. So much must  here suffice as to his age, proceeding in the next instance to his  style.    Much attached to the method of Giorgione, he aimed at attaining his  clearness of expression, and vivacity of colouring. In his celebrated  picture of Saint Barbara, at S. Maria Formosa, one of his most powerful  and characteristic productions, Jacopo more especially adopted him as  his model. In some of his other pieces, he more nearly approaches  Titian, a resemblance we are told by Ridolfi, consisting in the peculiar  grace which he acquired from studying the earliest productions of that  great master. Of this kind is the Supper of Christ, painted for Santa  Maria _Mater Domini_, with the Virgin at San Stefano di Vicenza,  executed with so much sweetness of expression as to be esteemed one of  his happiest productions. There are many examples of both styles to be  met with in the grand Carrara collection, as given in the list of Count  Tassi, (p. 93). Finally, Zanetti is of opinion that in some others he  displays a more original genius, as exemplified in the Epiphany of the  island of Saint Helena, where he equally shines in the character of a  naturalist who selects well, who carefully disposes his draperies, and  who composes according to good rules. The distinguishing character then  of his pieces is diligence, refinement, and a harmony of tints, so great  as to leave no traces of the pencil; and it has been observed by one of  his historians, that he long occupied himself in the production of each  piece, and frequently retouched it. In the mixture of his colours, as  well as other respects, he often resembles Lotto, and if he be less  animated and sublime, he is, perhaps, generally speaking, more beautiful  in the form of his heads, especially in those of boys and women. It is  the opinion of some, that in several of his countenances he expressed  the likeness of his daughter Violante, very nearly related to Titian,  and a portrait of whom, by the hand of her father, was to be seen in the  gallery of Sera, a Florentine gentleman, who purchased at Venice many  rarities for the House of the Medici, as well as for himself, (Boschini,  p. 368). A variety of pictures intended for private rooms, met with in  different places in Italy, have also been attributed to the hand of  Palma; besides portraits, one of which has been commended by Vasari as  truly astonishing, from its beauty; and Madonnas, chiefly drawn along  with other saints, on oblong canvass; a practice in common use by many  artists of that age, some of whom we have already recounted, and others  are yet to come. But the least informed among people of taste, being  ignorant of their names, the moment they behold a picture between the  dryness of Giovanni Bellini and the softness of Titian, pronounce it to  be a Palma, and this, more particularly, where they find countenances  well rounded and coloured, landscape exhibited with care, and roseate  hues in the drapery, occurring more frequently than any of a more  sanguine dye. In this way Palma is in the mouths of all, while other  artists, "]]]
