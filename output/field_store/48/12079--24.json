OBS. This bird Dr. Horsfield tells me is his _Alcedo meninting_      described in the Linn. Transactions.           *       *       *       *       *    The general resemblance between this and the European Kingsfisher may have  been the cause why it has remained hitherto unnoticed by ornithologists. It  bears, however, on closer inspection, a strong and peculiar distinction in  the crest at the back of the head, in being much smaller in size, and  especially as inhabiting the hottest parts of India; while our own braves  the cold of a Siberian winter.    Total length six inches, of which the bill from the angle of the mouth to  the tip occupies one inch and three-quarters, and is black, with the under  mandible paler; the ears and the upper part of the head and neck are  blueish-black, transversely banded with somewhat crescent-shaped narrow  bands of a rich deep blue, which are broken into spots on the crest and  ears: from the base of the under mandible is a black stripe richly glossed  with blue, and carried down on each side the neck, between which and the  upper part is a whitish stripe beginning just behind the ears (this in the  European species is rufous). The wing-covers, scapulars and lesser quills  are blackish glossed with blue, the two former having a bright spot at the  end of each feather; superior and greater quills entirely blackish; down  the middle of the back, rump, and tail-covers, light and vivid blue, with a  slight tinge of greenish; chin and throat cream-colour; line between the  nostrils and eyes, margin of the shoulders, under wing-covers, and all the  lower parts of the body, rufous; tail deep and obscure blue; legs red.    My specimen came from some part of India; I have met with others from the  same place; and Dr. Horsfield has likewise observed it in Java.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 51    [Illustration]    COLIAS Pyrene.    _White African Colias._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 5.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _C. alis albis; anticis supra punctulo nigro subcentrali oblongo ad      apicem approximante; posticis margine integerrimis; singulis subtus      puncto ocellari lineisque fulvis undulatis: sexibus similibus._        Wings white; anterior with a small, nearly central, oblong, black dot      nearest the tip; margin of the posterior wings very entire, beneath all      with a brown ocellate spot and undulated fulvous lines: both sexes      alike.           *       *       *       *       *    Under the head of _Colias Pyranthe_, M. Godart has united the three insects  described by Fabricius, as, _Pap. Pyranthe_, _Nepthe_ and _Gnomia_, all  bearing in their leading colours a very near resemblance to each other. Yet  as this consideration alone appears to have decided this ingenious author  in uniting them, without apparently noticing the nicer but more important  characters of form, proportion, and real sexual distinction, as well as  geography, I cannot but consider the question still remains doubtful; and  although I am not at present prepared to offer an opinion as to the actual  affinity between these three insects, I have little or no doubt that the  one now figured is a really distinct species from either of the above,  which all inhabit various parts of India. This, on the contrary, is from  the interior of the Cape of Good Hope, from whence it was brought by Mr.  Burchall, among whose insects I have seen about twenty unvarying specimens,  but they were all males. I discovered however three or four of both sexes,  varying in size, in Mr. Haworth's cabinet, and the perfect similarity in  colour of the female with the other sex is very striking: it wants of  course the little tuft of hair and opaque spot within the borders of the  wings, so generally found in the male _Coliadae_.    The distinctions of _Colias Pyrene_ as a species rest on the areola of the  anterior wings being considerably larger in proportion than in the others  allied to it, thus making the black dot (which is always placed at the  outer extremity of the areola) much nearer the tip than the base: these  wings are also more sharply trigonal (in the male), and have only the  slightest appearance of a black margin; the hinder wings are also perfectly  entire, and not obtusely undulated as in those insects, and the sexes not  differing in colour. Like most of the insects of this genus, the ocellate  spots beneath vary considerably; sometimes they are silvery, at other times  not; the anal valves in the male are short and obtuse, and the wings in the  female not so sharply pointed.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 52    [Illustration]    COLIAS argante.    _Orange Colias._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 5.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _C.

Cnidia_ were, without the least  remaining doubt, the male and the female of one species. I have had the  same opinion communicated to me by my friend Dr. Langsdorff, whose long  residence and observations in Brazil render his opinion of no small  authority.    As both insects are well known, and their distinctions given in the  specific character, it will be only necessary to observe, that the under  surfaces of the wings in both sexes vary much both in the density of the  minute dots, and short undulated stripes that spread over their surface;  and that the silvery spots in some males are strongly marked, and in others  quite obsolete: there is, in very fine individuals of this sex, a faint  bloom of pink spread on the orange of the upper surface, which heightens  the vivid yet chaste beauty of the insect. The females are not so common. I  met with them both in northern and southern Brazil, and have seen them in  collections from Para directly under the equinoctial line.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 53    [Illustration]    STROMBUS cylindricus.    _False Scarlet-mouthed Strombus_--_Upper and under figures_.           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 10.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _S. testa coniformi, spira brevissima ad basin depressa, anfractibus      convexis inaequalibus, labio exteriore supra lobato, intus striato;      interiore sub-obsoleto, albo._        Shell coniform; spire short, depressed at the base, the whorls convex      and unequal; outer lip lobed above, and internally striated; inner lip      nearly obsolete, white.        _Lister_ 850. 5.

Luhuanus_ of authors; and this consists not so much in  the colour of the inner lip, as in the almost total absence of that  important part, which this shell invariably exhibits through all its  growths: it is therefore, I think, contradictory to the meaning of the word  to term that variable which is found to be constant, particularly where the  point of distinction rests on a marked difference of _formation_ no less  than of colour, though both shells are common to the Oriental seas. Minor  differences exist, in the mouth of this always being pink, the inner lip  white, and the outer lip but slightly lobed (or cut out) above: in _S.  Luhuanus_ the mouth is deep scarlet, inner lip black and highly polished,  and the outer lip deeply notched above; the two former characters, indeed,  begin to show themselves at a very early growth of the shell.           *       *       *       *       *    STROMBUS Persicus.    _Persian Strombus__--middle figures._        _S. testa sub-coniformi, brevi; spira conica, aequali; labio exteriore      prominente, supra sinuato, intus glabro; interiore polito, albo._        Shell somewhat coniform, short; spire conic, equal.

Shamus seemed imitating that famous hunter who  brought home his bear-meat alive, preceding it by only half a coat-tail.  But the game before us was changing in appearance most wonderfully. It  seemed bristling with unusually long horns, and as we looked the dark  cloud suddenly spread out into a fan-like shape, and we all cried,  simultaneously, \"Indians!\"    There they were, a party of our red brethren bearing rapidly down upon  us in pursuit of Dobeen, whose arms and legs were playing like flails on  his donkey's sides, with an appeal for speed which had evidently called  into action all the reserves of that true conservative.    Our party would have sold out their interest in the plains for a  bagatelle. Our whole outfit had whirled, like a weather-cock, and was  pointing back to Hays. The Mexicans were already dodging in and out  among their oxen, and firing their old muskets furiously, although the  foe was yet a fair cannon-shot away. Shamus could not well have been in  more danger from foes behind than he was from friends before; indeed, he  afterward said that asking deliverance from the latter made him almost  forget the former.    [Illustration: _BUREAU OF ILLUSTRATION_    OUR HORSES RUN AWAY WITH US.]    The horses of both Sachem and Muggs ran away, taking a straight line for  the distant town. This caused a general stampede on the part of all the  other horses, much to the regret of their riders, who were thus cruelly  prevented from a proper display of latent prowess in rendering  protection to the wagons and our cook. From the former came a steady  cannonade. Squirming like eels among their oxen, the Mexicans fired from  under the animals' bellies, astride the tongue, from anywhere, indeed,  that furnished a barricade between the distant Indians and themselves.    It is one of the remarkable tactics of this remarkable people, in  military emergencies, that when they can not put distance between them  and the enemy, they must substitute _something_ else. A single trooper,  on an open plain, could send a small army of them scampering off, but  let them get behind a barricade, and they will continue banging away  with their old muskets until either the weapon bursts or ammunition  gives out. It is surprising how harmless their fusillades generally are.  If Mexican powder is used, it goes off like a mixture of lamp-black and  nitro-glycerine, with a premonitory fiz and then a fearful concussion,  leaving a smell of burnt oil in the air which overcomes for a moment the  natural aroma of the warriors themselves.    But while we were still being run away with by our spirited animals,  another change occurred in the situation equally as unexpected as the  first. The Indians had stopped running about the time that we commenced,  and now stood in a dusky line something less than half a mile off,  making signs to us. Shamus evidently considered it a horrible  incantation for his scalp, and every time he looked backward plied with  renewed fervor at his donkey's ribs. Our guide, who had stayed with the  wagons and exerted himself to silence the Mexican batteries, motioned us  to return, which we were finally enabled to do by virtue of steady  pulling upon one rein and coming back in half circles.    By the time our cook reached us, out of breath and perspiring terribly,  two savages had ridden out from their band, weaponless, and were now  gesturing a wish to communicate. The Professor and our guide rode to  meet them, apparently unarmed; but with characteristic exhibition of the  white man's subtlety, the tail-pocket of the philosopher's coat held a  pistol in reserve, and the guide, I have no doubt, was equally well  provided.          CHAPTER XI.         WHITE WOLF, THE CHEYENNE CHIEF--HUNGRY INDIANS--RETURN TO HAYS--A       CHEYENNE WAR PARTY--THE PIPE OF PEACE--THE COUNCIL CHAMBER--WHITE       WOLF'S SPEECH, AS RENDERED BY SACHEM--THE WHITE MAN'S WIGWAM.      About midway between our party and the dusky group that stood watching  us the four embassadors met. The Indians proved to be a band of  Cheyennes, under White Wolf, or, as he is more frequently called,  Medicine Wolf, out on the war-path against the Pawnees. The Wolf was a  fine-looking man, six feet four in height, straight as an arrow, and  developed like a giant. Being a chief, he possessed the regalia and  warranty deed of one, consisting of a ragged military coat without any  tail, and a dirty letter from some Indian agent, with a lie in it over  which even a Cheyenne must have smiled, telling how White Wolf loved the  whites. Perhaps he did; his namesake loves spring lamb.    Our guide was an indifferent interpreter, but had no difficulty in  understanding that the Indians were hungry and wished something to eat.  In all my experience from that day to this I have never found an Indian  who was not hungry, except once. The exception was an old fellow who,  although enough of an Indian to be habitually drunk, was so degenerate a  specimen in other respects as to be somewhat dyspeptic. His stomach had  repudiated, after receiving a deposit from a trader of one hundred  pickled oysters, and had temporarily closed its doors. His stock of  gastric juices seemed to have been well-nigh bankrupted by a fifty  years' discounting of jerked buffalo. The one hundred tons of this  compound which the noble warrior had dissolved would have exhausted the  liquid of a tannery. Let these savages of the plains meet a white man,  whenever or wherever they may, their first demand is always for meat and  drink, followed not unfrequently by another for his scalp. The victim  may have but a day's rations, and be a hundred miles from any station  where more can be obtained, but his all is taken as greedily and  remorselessly as if he commanded a commissary train.    The Professor and our guide motioned White Wolf and his companion to  wait, and rode back to us for the purpose of casting up our account of  ways and means. The only chance of balancing it seemed to be by sight  draft on Shamus' wagon or an entry of war. We dare not refuse them and  go on; they would be sure to dog our steps, and at the first convenient  opportunity attack and probably murder us. Shamus, with recovered  courage, stoutly protested against a raid upon his department. \"To  think,\" he expostulated, \"of the swate sausage and ham bein' used to wad  such painted carcasses as them divils!\" The guide suggested as the best  alternative that we should invite the Indians to return with us to Hays.  We caught at the idea and adopted it immediately; and while the guide  rode back as the bearer of our invitation, we \"stood to arms,\" awaiting  the result with silent but ill-concealed solicitude.    Should the Indians consider it an attempt to trap them, our bones might  have an opportunity to rest in some neighboring ravine until the ready  spades of some future geological expedition should disturb them, and we  be at once reconstructed into some rare species of ancient ape or  specimens of extinct salamanders. Or, if happily resurrected at a  somewhat earlier period, might not some enterprising Barnum of the  twentieth century place on our bones the seal of centuries, and lay them  with the mummies in his showcases? Our expedition was partly intended  for diving into the past, but not quite so deep or so permanent a dive  as that. What wonder that incipient ague-chills played up and down and  all about our spinal column, as we reflected how completely we were  dependent on the caprice of those Native Americans sitting out there, in  half-naked dignity, on their tough ponies? Or that we gazed anxiously at  the huge chief as he sat, silent and motionless, awaiting the approach  of our guide?    Our ideas of the savage had been so thoroughly Cooperised during  boyhood, that when our guide approached the Wolf, and, with a gesture to  the south, invited him back to Hays, I was prepared to see the tall form  straighten in the saddle, and pictured to my imagination some such  specimen of untutored eloquence as this:    \"Pale-face, the blood of the Cheyenne burns quick. He meets you trailing  like a serpent across his war-path, seeking to steal treasures from the  red man's land. He asks food, and you tell him to come into your trap  and get it. Pale-faces, remove your hats; noble Cheyennes, remove their  scalps!\"    Nothing of this kind occurred, however. Our guide informed us that the  bold savage simply fastened one button of his tailless coat, grunted out  \"Ugh!\" in a satisfied way, and motioned his band to follow. This they  did, and we were soon retracing our steps to Hays; by the guide's  advice, making the savages keep a fair distance behind us.    The roofs of Hays glistened across the plains, as they say those of  Damascus do in the East. We had formed a boy's romantic acquaintance  with that land, where the sun burns and the simooms frolic, and once  were quite enamored of its wild Bedouins of the desert. Our manhood was  now experiencing the sensation of seeing a tribe fiercer than their  eastern brethren, not exactly at our doors, because we had none, but  following very closely at our heels.    As our strange cavalcade re-entered the town the people stopped to gaze  a moment, and then came out to meet us. News flew to the fort, and some  of the officers rode over. The Land Company's office was selected for a  council room, the Cheyennes tying their ponies to the stage corral near.  The Indians were a strange-looking crew. Sachem declared them all women,  and Dobeen affirmed that they looked more like a covey of witches than  warriors. With their long hair divided in the middle, and falling,"]]]
