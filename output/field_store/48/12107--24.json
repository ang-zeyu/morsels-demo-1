B. asks: Can I add anything to Arnold's writing fluid which  will cause it to give a good free copy in my letter book? A. Try a  little sugar.    (9) R. & C. ask for information in regard to the process of printing  copies of drawings made on transparent materials, by using chemically  prepared paper and exposing to the sunlight. A. It is based on the fact  that an acid in the presence of potassium dichromate strikes a  blackish-green color when brought in contact with aniline. The paper is  prepared by floating it on a bath of aqueous solution of potassium  dichromate and a trace of phosphoric acid, and then drying it in the  dark. Aniline is dissolved in a little alcohol, and the mixed vapors  allowed to come into contact with the sensitive paper that has been  exposed to strong sunlight beneath the drawing, when the portions not  changed by the sunlight assume the dark color mentioned. All that is  requisite is that the paper or cloth original should be fairly  penetrable by the light. A piece of paper sensitized as indicated, a  sheet of glass to place over the drawing, and a box in which to place  the exposed print to the aniline vapor are the only necessary plant.    (10) P. Y. P. writes: 1. To find the number of acres in a farm of valley  and hillside land, is it by measuring the general contour of the land,  allowing its actual surface, or by measuring and allowing only the  imaginary face of the plane of it? A. The latter is the correct method.  2. Can more grain, say rye, be raised on a farm of valley and hillside  land, as described above, than on a farm having a flat surface, the area  of which is equal to the plane of the former, all other things supposed  to be equal? A. No.    (11) Inventor asks: 1. Can you tell me of a book on sound boards? A. We  do not know of a book especially devoted to the subject. 2. Also the  best kind of wood to make them out of? A. Spruce.    (12) F. C. A. writes: I wish to construct a bar electro-magnet to go in  a cylinder 1 inch in diameter and 1 inch long. 1. What size ought the  core to be? What number of wire shall I use, and what number of  Leclanche cells shall I use (not to exceed twelve) to obtain the  greatest possible attractive power, distance 1/10 of an inch? A. Make  the core 3/8 inch, wind it with No. 24 silk covered wire. Use 6 or 8  cells. 2. In the same space, could a horseshoe magnet be used, with a  gain of power over the bar magnet? A. A cylindrical magnet, which is  substantially the same as a horseshoe, might be substituted with  advantage for the bar magnet.    (13) W. C. H. writes: In turning a tapering shaft in an engine lathe,  will the tool if raised above the centers of the lathe turn the taper  true from end to end, _i. e._, neither concave nor convex, the taper to  be made by sliding the tail center the required distance? A. The taper  will be concave.    (14) H. E. H. asks how to make lime light. A. The lime light is made by  directing the jet of an oxyhydrogen blowpipe against a cylinder of lime.  The blowpipe is contrived to take the proper proportion of oxygen and  hydrogen gas, and the lime is placed in the reducing focus of the jet.    (15) L. F. asks: 1. How many Daniell's or Smee's cells would it require  to produce the same effect as 50 Bunsen cells? A. About 100. 2. Is the  diaphragm equally necessary in Bunsen's, Smee's and Daniell's cells, or  can it be omitted in any one of them easier than in the others, and why  so? A. The diaphragm or porous cell is required in Daniell's and  Bunsen's batteries, but is not used in Smee's. The porous cell is used  only in two fluid batteries; its object is to allow the current to pass,  but to prevent the mixture of the two liquids. 3. Is the thickness of  the zinc of any importance? A. Only that the thicker zinc lasts longer.  4. Which is the cheapest way to produce electric sparks and to charge a  Leyden jar, and what will be the expense? A. By means of a frictional  electrical machine. The machines cost from $10 upward.    (16) R. C. K. writes: I am an engineer by trade; have been at it 9  years. Am out of a position at present and want to learn mechanical  draughting. How long would it take me to become a good draughtsman by  taking a special course at some university? And with my knowledge of  engineering and draughting, would my services be likely to be in fair  demand? A. If you are familiar with mechanical operations, you might  become a good draughtsman by close application under a competent  instructor for one or two years. At present there are many excellent  draughtsmen looking for positions.    (17) G. B. M. asks for the cause of the ribs or ridges on the surface of  a piece of timber which has passed through a planing machine. A. They  are frequently due to the intermittent motion of the feed.    (18) A. F. writes: Having a small quantity of gold and gold plated  things, I would like to know the simplest way to melt it. A. Put it in a  small crucible with a little borax and melt in a common kitchen fire.    (19) J. H. S. writes: I have three drawings each 21 x 30 inches, which I  wish to mount upon cloth like a map, placing them end to end so as to  make one whole sheet 90 inches long. The drawings are upon heavy Whatman  paper. A. You should stretch wet canvas or factory cloth upon a frame,  and while it is still damp apply paste to the backs of the drawings and  lay them smoothly on the stretched cloth. When the paste becomes  thoroughly dry cut the cloth from the stretching frame and paste a tape  binding around the edges.    (20) P. M. asks: What is the difference between the inner and outer  rails of a 10 deg. curve 100 yards in length, gauge 4 feet 8 inches? A. If  this 100 yards is measured on the center of the curve, whose radius in                                               R - 2-1/3   feet is R, the length of the inner rail is  --------- X 100, and of the                                                  R              R + 2-1/3   outer tail --------- X 100.                 R    (21) W. B. K. asks how to make a shoe dressing for ladies' shoes. A.  Soft water, 1 gallon; extract of logwood, 6 ozs.; dissolve at a  temperature of about 120 deg. Fah. Soft water, 1 gallon; borax, 6 ozs.;  shellac, 1-1/2 oz.; boil until dissolved. Potassium dichromate, 3/8 oz.;  hot water, 1/2 pint; dissolve, and add all together. It is preferred to  add 3 ozs. of strong aqua ammonia to the liquid before bottling.    (22) J. D. asks: What chemicals can be put into water to increase its  efficiency in extinguishing fire? A. Carbonic acid; sodium carbonate.    (23) H. P. writes: Please give me the advantages and disadvantages of  substituting a galvanized iron tube 18 inches in diameter and 20 feet  high for a wood tank, 5 feet wide and 6 deep, as a container of water in  a dwelling house in the country. Would the narrower body of water keep  fresh or sweet longer, etc.? Also the thickness of iron necessary to  safety, and the number of gallons of water this tube would hold. A. The  advantages are in favor of the wooden tank; zinc lined vessels  (galvanized) are unsuitable for reservoirs for potable water. See p.  369, vol. 36, SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN. 0.3 inch iron would be stout enough.  A pipe of the dimensions specified would contain about 327 gallons when  full.    (24) F. L. M. asks: 1. What is the process by which wire is given a  copper finish? A. Clean the wire by pickling it for a short time in very  dilute sulphuric acid and scouring with sand if necessary. Then pass the  clean wire through a strong bath of copper sulphate dissolved in water.  2. Can wire be thus finished and also annealed? If so, how? A. The wire  should be annealed first. 3. What other finish can be put on iron wire  (annealed), and by what process? A. Zinc--by passing the clean wire  through molten zinc covered with sal ammoniac; tin--by drawing the wire  through a bath of molten tin covered with tallow.

Yet, upon the whole, the space I traversed is unlikely to become the haunt  of civilized man, or will only become so in isolated spots, as a chain of  connection to a more fertile country; if such a country exist to the  westward.    The hill which thus became the extreme of my journey, is of sandstone  formation, and is bold and precipitous. Its summit is level and lightly  timbered. As a tribute of respect to the late Surveyor-General, I called  it Oxley's Table Land, and I named the distant hills D'Urban's Group,  after Sir Benjamin D'Urban, in compliance with a previous request of my  friend Lieut. De la Condamine, that I would so name any prominent feature  of the interior that I might happen to come upon.    RETURN TO THE CAMP.    In returning to the camp, I made a circuit to the N.E., and reached the  Macquarie late on the evening of the 5th of January; having been absent  six days, during which we could not have ridden less than 200 miles. Yet  the horses were not so fatigued as it was natural to expect they would  have been.    My servant informed me that a party of natives had visited the camp on the  3rd, but that they retired precipitately on seeing the animals. I  regretted to find the men but little better than when I left them. Several  still complained of a painful irritation of the eyes, and of great  weakness of sight. Attributing their continued indisposition in some  measure to our situation, I was anxious to have moved from it; but as Mr.  Hume was still absent, I could not decide upon the measure. He made his  appearance, however, on the 6th, having ridden the greater part of the day  through rain, which commenced to fall in the morning. Soon after his  arrival, Dawber, my overseer of animals, who had accompanied him, was  taken suddenly ill. During the night he became much worse, with shivering  and spasms, and on the following morning he was extremely weak and  feverish. To add to my anxiety, Mr. Hume also complained of indisposition.  His state of health made me the more anxious to quit a position which I  fancied unwholesome, and in which, if there was no apparent, there was  certainly some secret, exciting cause; and as Mr. Hume reported having  crossed a chain of ponds about four miles to the eastward, and out of the  immediate precincts of the marshes, I ordered the tents to be struck, and  placing Dawber on my horse, we all moved quietly over to them.    MR. HUME'S EXCURSION.    The result of Mr. Hume's journey perplexed me exceedingly. He stated, that  on setting out from the Macquarie his intention was to have proceeded to  the N.E., to ascertain how far the reeds existed in that direction, and,  if at all practicable, to reach the Castlereagh; but in case of failure,  to regain the Macquarie by a westerly course. At first he travelled nearly  four miles east, to clear the marshes, when he came on the chain of ponds  to which we had removed.    He travelled over good soil for two miles after crossing this chain of  ponds, but afterwards got on a red sandy loam, and found it difficult to  proceed, by reason of the thickness of the brush, and the swampy state of  the ground in consequence of the late rain.    The timber in the brushes was of various kinds, and he saw numerous  kangaroos and emus. On issuing from this brush, he crossed a creek,  leading northerly, the banks of which were from ten to twelve feet high.  Whatever the body of water usually in it is, it now only afforded a few  shallow puddles. Mr. Hume travelled through brushes until he came upon a  third creek, similar to the one he had left behind him, at which he halted  for the night. The water in it was bad, and the feed for the animals  extremely poor. The brush lined the creek thickly, and consisted chiefly  of acacia pendula and box. The country preserved an uniform level, nor did  Mr. Hume, from the highest trees, observe any break on the horizon.    On the 2nd of January, Mr. Hume kept more northerly, being unable to  penetrate the brushes he encountered. At two miles he crossed a creek  leading to the N.W., between which and the place at which he had slept, he  passed a native burial ground, containing eight graves. The earth was  piled up in a conical shape, but the trees were not carved over as he had  seen them in most other places.    The country became more open after he had passed the last mentioned creek,  which he again struck upon at the distance of eight miles, and as it was  then leading to the N.N.E. he followed it down for eighteen or twenty  miles, and crossed it frequently during the day. The creek was dry in most  places, and where he stopped for the night the water was bad, and the  cattle feed indifferent.    Mr. Hume saw many huts, but none of them had been recently occupied,  although large quantities of muscle-shells were scattered about. He  computed that he had travelled about thirty miles, in a N.N.W.  direction, and the whole of the land he passed over was, generally  speaking, bad, nor did it appear to be subject to overflow.    On the 3rd, Mr. Hume proceeded down the creek on which he had slept, on a  northern course, under an impression that it would have joined the  Castlereagh, but it took a N.W. direction after he had ridden about four  miles, and then turned again to the eastward of north. In consequence of  this, he left it, and proceeded to the westward, being of opinion that the  river just mentioned must have taken a more northerly course than Mr.  Oxley supposed it to have done.    A short time after Mr. Hume turned towards the Macquarie, the country  assumed a more pleasing appearance. He soon cleared the brushes, and at  two miles came upon a chain of ponds, again running northerly in times of  flood. Shortly after crossing these, he found himself on an extensive  plain, apparently subject to overflow. The timber on it was chiefly of  the blue-gum kind, and the ground was covered with shells. He then thought  he was approaching the Macquarie, and proceeded due west across the flat  for about two miles. At the extremity of it there was a hollow, which he  searched in vain for water. Ascending about thirty feet, he entered a  thick brush of box and acacia pendula, which continued for fourteen miles,  when it terminated abruptly, and extensive plains of good soil commenced,  stretching from N. to S. as far as the eye could reach, on which there  were many kangaroos. Continuing to journey over them, he reached a creek  at 5 p.m. on which the wild fowl were numerous, running nearly north and  south, and he rested on its banks for the night. The timber consisted both  of blue and rough gum, and the soil was a light earth.    Mr. Hume expected in the course of the day to have reached the Macquarie,  but on arriving at the creek, he began to doubt whether it any longer  existed, or whether it had not taken a more westerly direction. On the  following morning, therefore, he crossed the creek, and travelled  W.S.W., for about two miles over good plains; then through light brushes  of swamp-oak, cypress, box, and acacia pendula, for about twelve miles, to  another creek leading northerly. He shortly afterwards ascended a range of  hills stretching W.N.W. to which he gave the name of New Year's Range.  From these hills, he had an extensive view, although not upon the highest  part, but the only break he could see in the horizon was caused by some  hills bearing by compass W. by S. distant about twenty-five miles. There  was, however, an appearance as of high land to the northward, although Mr.  Hume thought it might have been an atmospheric deception. From the range  he looked in vain for the Macquarie, or other waters, and, as his  provisions were nearly consumed, he was obliged to give up all further  pursuit, and to retrace his steps. He fell in with two parties of natives,  which, taken collectively, amounted to thirty-five in number, but had no  communication with them.    It was evident, from the above account, that supposing a line to have been  drawn from the camp northerly, Mr. Hume must have travelled considerably  to the westward of it, and as I had run on a N.W. course from the marshes,  it necessarily followed that our lines of route must have intersected each  other, or that want of extension could alone have prevented them from  having done so; but that, under any circumstances, they could not have  been very far apart. This was too important a point to be left undecided,  as upon it the question of the Macquarie's termination seemed to depend.    Both Mr. Hume and myself were of opinion, that a medium course would be  the most satisfactory for us to pursue, to decide this point; and it  appeared that we could not do better than, by availing ourselves of the  creek on which we were, and skirting the reeds, to take the first  opportunity of dashing through them in a westerly direction.    DOUBTS OF THE FURTHER EXTENSION OF THE RIVER.    I entertained great doubts as to the longer existence of the river, and as  I foresaw that, in the event of its having terminated we should strike at  once into the heart of the interior, I became anxious for the arrival of  supplies at Mount Harris; and although I could hardly expect that they had  yet reached it, I determined to proceed thither. Mr. Hume was too unwell  for me to think of imposing additional fatigue upon him; I left him,  therefore, to conduct the party, by easy stages, to the northward, until  such time as I should overtake them. Even in one day there was a visible  improvement in the men, and Dawber's attack seemed to be rather the  effects of cold than of any thing else. A death, however, under our  circumstances, would have been so truly deplorable an event, that the  least illness was sufficient to create alarm.    I can hardly say that I was"]]]
