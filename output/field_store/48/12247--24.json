He produced a package of sealed  papers and handing it to me, said:    \"Doctor, this is a most important affair.  There is a most serious  trouble brewing somewhere--trouble about war.  We have our suspicions  as to what power is behind all this and we are going to find out.  You  are well enough acquainted with the situation to require no further  illustration.  You know how here at home they are also trying to force  the Emperor into a war-- You will leave this package at the Embassy in  Paris.  It must be there at the Rue de Lille to-morrow noon.  To do so  you will have to catch the Orient Express at half-past three this  morning.  At the Paris legation you will receive another package which  you will take on to Madrid.  After delivering this, you have _carte  blanche_ to make your way to the _Panther_, which you will find off  Barcelona.  Also, you will visit Gibraltar and inform yourself of the  strength and state of preparation of the British Naval Squadron  there.\"  He paused.  \"This time you will not apply at the cashier's  desk.  Your expenses are borne this time out of the Emperor's private  chatulle.  In a few hours time I will have French and Spanish money  ready for you and send it to your lodgings.  You thoroughly understand  your instructions?  Of course, you have not forgotten the message that  you memorized before the Emperor?\"    I assured him I had not and after a cordial handshake I bowed myself  out and hurried back to my quarters.  Here I found that my boy had my  traveling bag ready with his usual completeness.  One does not take  much baggage on these trips.  Pajamas, slippers, smoking cap, tooth  brush, have seen me three-quarters around the globe, and I never  carried a six-shooter in my life.  In all my experience I have seen  few secret agents who do carry it.  The only protective article I ever  carried was a little silk bag containing a mixture of cayenne pepper,  snuff and certain chemicals.  It is very effective to throw into the  faces of those who attack you.    Soon there came a messenger from Wedel with the promised funds, a  thousand francs and two thousand pesos.  It lacked a half hour to  three-thirty, so I made my way to the Friedrichstrasse depot on foot.  Experience has taught me that the Orient Express is generally  overcrowded and that unless one reaches the depot early and uses a  good deal of palm oil, it is impossible to secure a decent seat.  A  judicious oiling of palms enabled me to get a very pleasant window  seat in the middle compartment.  After making myself at home I took a  tour through the train.  It is my invariable custom to take stock of  my fellow travelers and in this case it was most imperative.    Nothing happened until we pulled in at Frankfort-on-the-Main, the  second last stop for the express in Germany.  Glancing out of the  window I saw a party of three entering the carriage.  They selected  the compartment next to mine.  Obviously they were traveling together,  equally obvious was it that there was plenty of room in their own  compartment.  The train was hardly in motion, however, when the woman  of the party entered my compartment.  She started to complain about  being annoyed by the man next door and to ask my protection.  As a  matter of course, I got up and offered my assistance to remove her  belongings into my compartment.  I had, up to now, not the slightest  doubt as to there being anything fishy in her request.  I had, in  fact, no reason to be apprehensive of any interference, because only  two people besides myself--Wedel and the Emperor--knew my mission.  Of  course, there were others who would have given anything to know of it,  who would have done anything to prevent my reaching my destination.    I had hardly entered the compartment and tried to remove the traveling  bag indicated by the lady as hers, when one of the men exclaimed:    \"How dare you remove my wife's property?\"    The lady in question stood in the corridor of the carriage.  I had my  back to her but I could see her by means of the looking-glass with  which the sides of the compartment were framed.  I noticed her make a  sign to the man.  Of course, this put a different light on the affair.  It was preconceived.  For the life of me, though, I could not see how  they could use the situation to advantage.    Presently I was enlightened.  When the conductor came along, the  \"husband\" coolly requested my detention on grounds of interference  with his wife's luggage.  He was stanchly supported by the other man  and by the lady who had come to me for assistance.  I attempted to  explain, but it didn't go down with the conductor.  Pending our  arrival at Cologne, he locked me up in my compartment and leaving me,  said that he intended to hand me over to the station master here.    I had time to ponder over my situation.  I was thoroughly angry,  chiefly with myself.  Here I was, an old, and presumably experienced,  secret agent and I was caught by a simple device.  But the simplicity  got me!  When one is prepared for elaborate schemes, the simplest  trick lands one high and dry.  Still I could see no daylight.  They  could not hope to keep me on this preposterous charge.  A single wire  to Berlin would settle the matter, but then there would be a delay.  I  would not reach Paris until six o'clock at night.  Wedel had insisted  that I be there at noon.  Hum!    Delays at this time were of tremendous importance.  A difference of  six hours might mean war.  Powerful influences in Germany were all for  war.  It filled the air.  It needed only a false or overstep on the  part of any government official to bring about an explosion.  France  seemed fairly itching for a fight.  My verbal message to the captain  of the Panther must be delivered on schedule or the explosion might  occur.  I began to see what they hoped to gain by the trick of  detaining me, but how they got word of my mission I have never been  able to learn.  I must have been shadowed from my lodging to the  Wilhelmstrasse and subsequently lain in wait for on general  principles.    According to the time-table, the Orient Express stops at Cologne nine  minutes.  This time it stopped eleven.  The station master held it up.  After the party in the next compartment made their charge, we all  hurried to his office.  I called the station master aside and showed  him my Secret Service card.    I showed him a package addressed and sealed to the German Embassy at  Paris.  It was an official linen envelope tied with a black and white  silk cord and with the Foreign Office seal on the back.  He was  impressed.    \"This is a ridiculous charge,\" I declared.  \"Telephone the  Wilhelmstrasse at my expense.  Detain me and you do so at your own  peril.  That is all.  I have given you the facts.  I put no obstacle  in the path of your duty.  I judge, though, that you are a man of  discretion.\"    The station master _was_ a man of discretion.  I could imagine what  was going through his mind:    \"This fellow who says he is the Emperor's messenger,\" he doubtless  thought, \"has three more hours on that train before he crosses the  German border.  If he isn't what he claims to be, we can catch him at  the Frontier.  If he is what he claims to be and I hold him here, I  will get in trouble.\"    Finally, he told the others that their charge was too thin and they  hurriedly left his office.  I never saw them again.  The station  master escorted me to my compartment and I noticed that from Cologne  to the French Frontier I had no other traveling companions.  My  arrival and what I accomplished in Paris is commonplace.  Arriving in  the Gare du Norde, I took a taxi to the German Embassy on the Rue de  Lille, where an under-secretary signed for my dispatches and handed me  two letters addressed to the Embassy in Madrid.  I immediately posted  his receipt to the Wilhelmstrasse, something German secret agents  always must do--mail the Foreign Office signatures for documents as  soon as they are delivered.  Without further adventure I reached  Madrid.  As the train was four hours late I did not present myself at  the Embassy.  I was met by a commissaire at the station, delivered him  the paper, received his signature, posted it to the Wilhelmstrasse,  and made connections for Barcelona.  Somewhere off the city, on the  open sea, the _Panther_ was waiting.    With the utmost difficulty I chartered a tug and in the twilight set  off to find the _Panther_.  It was coming night when we finally saw  her dark trim hull lying against the horizon.  Well named the  _Panther_, for in this case a false spring by her meant war.  As we  steamed up alongside a sentry hailed us from the deck.  I shouted that  I had come to see the Captain, but he told us to stand off.  Finally,  after persistently hailing the warship, the officer of the watch came  to the rail and held parley with me.    \"I have Imperial orders to see the Captain,\" I shouted.    Apparently this satisfied him, for he let me come on board.  Without  further delay I was shown into the Captain's room.  Very important,  the Captain.  Picture him, a man in the forties, straight-backed,  rather jolly, and with one of those German naval beards.  The  slightest mistake by the Captain of the _Panther_ and England and  France would have flung themselves into war with Germany.  He stood  for a moment regarding me, then he said,    \"Well, what is this?  What is your Wilhelmstrasse number?\"    \"Seventeen,\" I told him.    That appeared to satisfy the Captain.  I knew that the Wilhelmstrasse  had wired him that \"Number Seventeen\" was coming.  Still he was  careful.    \"Where were your first instructions received?\"    \"From Wedel.\"    \"Subsequently?\"    I felt him looking at me sharply.    \"Confirmed by the Emperor,\" I replied, \"and I deliver you herewith the  following message.  You are requested to use the private service code  as soon as I have delivered this message to you and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6952"],[0,"By Pike and Dyke: a Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic (#18)"],[1,"   \"Why, of course, you will remain on board, Master Ned. What else  should you do?\"    \"Well, Peters, my own mind is set upon joining the Prince of  Orange, and fighting against the Spaniards. Before I sailed from  home I told my sisters that was what I was longing to do, for I  could scarce sleep for thinking of all the cruelties and massacres  that they carried out upon the people of the Netherlands, who are,  by my mother's side, my kinsfolk. Since then I have scarce thought  of aught else. They have murdered my grandfather and uncles and one  of my aunts; they have shot away my father's leg, and would have  taken his life had he not escaped out of their hands; so that what  was before a longing is now a fixed idea, and if my father will  but give me permission, assuredly I will carry it out.    \"There are many English volunteers who have already crossed the  sea to fight against these murderers, although unconnected by ties  of blood as I am, and who have been brought here to fight solely  from pity and horror, and because, as all know, Spain is the enemy  of England as well as of the Netherlands, and would put down our  freedom and abolish our religion as she has done here. I know that  my wishes, in this as in all other matters, must give way to those  of my father. Still I hope he may be moved to consent to them.\"    Ned thought it better to allow his father and mother to remain  quietly together for some time, and did not therefore return to  the house until twelve o'clock, when he knew that dinner would be  prepared; for his mother was so methodical in her ways that everything  would go on just as at home directly she took charge of the affairs  of the house. He went up for a few minutes before dinner, and was  struck with the change in the expression of his father's face.  There was a peaceful and contented look in his eyes, and it almost  seemed to Ned that his face was less hollow and drawn than before.  Ned told him that it would be necessary for the brig to go round to  Leyden and the Hague, and that Peters had proposed that he should  go with him to see the merchants, and arrange the business parts  of the affair.    \"That will do very well,\" Captain Martin said. \"You are young,  Ned, to begin having dealings with the Dutch merchants, but when  you tell them how it comes that I am not able to call upon them  myself, they will doubtless excuse your youth.\"    \"Do you wish us to take any cargo there, father, if we can get  any?\"    Captain Martin did not answer for some little time, then he said:    \"No, Ned, I think you had best return here in the ship. By that time  I shall, I hope, be capable of thinking matters over, and deciding  upon my arrangements for the future. When is Peters thinking of  sailing?\"    \"By tomorrow morning's tide, sir. He said that he could be ready  perhaps by this evening; but that unless you wished it otherwise  he would not start till tomorrow's tide, as he will thereby avoid  going out between the islands at night.\"    \"That will be the best way, Ned. If the winds are fair he will be  at the Hague before nightfall.\"    The day after his return Ned took an opportunity of speaking to his  mother as to his wish to take service with the Prince of Orange,  and to aid in the efforts that the people of the Netherlands were  making to free themselves from their persecutors. His mother, as  he feared would be the case, expressed a strong opposition to his  plan.    \"You are altogether too young, Ned, even if it were a matter that  concerned you.\"    \"It does concern me, mother. Are you not Dutch? And though I was  born in England and a subject of the queen, it is natural I should  feel warmly in the matter; besides we know that many English are  already coming over here to help. Have not the Spanish killed my  relations, and unless they are driven back they will altogether  exterminate the Protestants of the Netherlands? Have they not  already been doomed to death regardless of age and sex by Philip's  proclamation? and do not the Spaniards whenever they capture a town  slay well nigh all within it?\"    \"That is all true enough,\" his mother agreed; \"but proves in no  way that you are a fit age to meddle in the affair.\"    \"I am sixteen, mother; and a boy of sixteen who has been years at  sea is as strong as one of eighteen brought up on land. You have  told me yourself that I look two or three years older than I am,  and methinks I have strength to handle pike and axe.\"    \"That may be perfectly true,\" said Mrs. Martin, \"but even supposing  all other things were fitting, how could we spare you now when  your father will be months before he can follow his trade on the  sea again, even if he is ever able to do so?\"    \"That is the thing, mother, that weighs with me. I know not what my  father's wishes may be in that respect, and of course if he holds  that I can be of use to him I must give up my plan; but I want you  at any rate to mention it to him. And I pray you not to add your  objections, but to let him decide on the matter according to his  will.\"    \"There will be no occasion for me to add objections, Ned. I do not  think your father will listen to such a mad scheme for a moment.\"    It was not until three or four days later that Mrs. Martin, seeing  that her husband was stronger and better, and was taking an interest  in what passed in the house, fulfilled her promise to Ned by telling  his father of his wishes.    \"You must not be angry with him,\" she said when she had finished;  \"for he spoke beautifully, and expressed himself as perfectly willing  to yield his wishes to yours in the matter. I told him, of course,  that it was a mad brained scheme, and not to be thought of. Still,  as he was urgent I should lay it before you, I promised to do so.\"    Captain Martin did not, as his wife expected, instantly declare  that such a plan was not to be thought of even for a moment, but  lay for some time apparently turning it over in his mind.    \"I know not quite what to say,\" he said at length.    \"Not know what to say?\" his wife repeated in surprise. \"Why, husband,  you surely cannot for a moment think of allowing Ned to embark in  so wild a business.\"    \"There are many English volunteers coming over; some of them not  much older, and not so fit in bodily strength for the work as Ned.  He has, too, the advantage of speaking the language, and can pass  anywhere as a native. You are surprised, Sophie, at my thinking of  this for a moment.\"    \"But what would you do without him?\" she exclaimed in astonishment.    \"That is what I have been thinking as I lay here. I have been  troubled what to do with Ned. He is too young yet to entrust with  all the business of the ship, and the merchants here and at home  would hesitate in doing business with a lad. Moreover, he is too  young to be first mate on board the brig. Peters is a worthy man and  a good sailor, but he can neither read nor write and knows nought  of business; and, therefore, until I am able, if I ever shall be,  to return to the Good Venture, I must have a good seaman as first  mate, and a supercargo to manage the business affairs of the  ship. Were Ned four years older he could be at once first mate and  supercargo. There, you see your objection that I need him falls to  the ground. As to other reasons I will think them over, and speak  to you another time.\"        CHAPTER VI    THE PRINCE OF ORANGE      Mistress Martin was much troubled in her mind by what seemed to  her the unaccountable favour with which her husband had received  Ned's proposal. She did not, however, allow any trace of this  feeling to escape her, nor did she mention to Ned that she had as  yet spoken as to his wishes to his father. The next day Captain  Martin himself renewed the subject.    \"I told you yesterday, Sophie, why in my opinion Ned would at  present be of little aid to me in the matter of the brig, and may  even go further in that respect and say that I think for a time it  will be just as well that he were not on board. Having no established  position there would be no special duties for him to perform. Now,  I have made a point of telling him all about the consignments and  the rates of freight, and have encouraged him always to express  his opinion freely on these matters in order that his intelligence  might thereby be quickened; but if he so expressed himself to the  supercargo the latter might well take offence and difficulties  arise, therefore before you spoke to me I had quite resolved that it  would be best he should sail no more in the Good Venture until old  enough to come in and take the place of second mate and supercargo,  but that I would place him with some captain of my acquaintance,  under whom he would continue to learn his duty for the next three  or four years.\"    \"That is a good reason, doubtless, husband, why Ned should not sail  in the Venture, but surely no reason at all why he should carry  out this mad fancy of his.\"    \"No reason, I grant you, wife; but it simply shows that it happens  at this moment we can well spare him. As to the main question, it  is a weighty one. Other young Englishmen have come out to fight for  the Netherlands with far less cause than he has to mix themselves  up in its affairs. Moreover, and this principally, it is borne  strongly upon my mind that it may be that this boy of ours is called  upon to do good service to Holland. It seems to me wife,\" he went  on, in answer to the look of astonishment upon his wife's face,  \"that the hand of Providence is in this matter.    \"I have always felt with you a hatred of the Spaniards and a deep  horror at the cruelties they are perpetrating upon this unhappy  people, and have thought that did the queen give the order for war  against them I would gladly adventure my life and ship in such an  enterprise; further than that I have not gone. But upon that day  when I heard the news of your father and brothers' murder I took  a solemn oath "]]]
