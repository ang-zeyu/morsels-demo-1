In all animals, as well as in man, the iliac bone, at the beginning of  life, consists of three parts, which afterwards unite and fuse together  and join at the middle of the bottom of a deep cavity which is situated  on the outer aspect of the bone--the cotyloid cavity.    Of those three portions when examined in the human iliac bone, that  above the cavity is the ilium; that on the inside is the pubis; and the  last, the lower one, is the ischium. In quadrupeds, the iliac bone  being, in its entirety, directed much more obliquely downwards and  backwards, the relative position of these constituent parts is a little  modified: the ilium is in front, the pubis is still internal, but in a  more inferior position, and the ischium is behind the cotyloid cavity.  We notice this peculiarity of the development of the iliac bone because  it is customary to continue to apply to the osseous regions which  correspond to these parts the names by which they were known when  independent bones.    [Illustration: FIG. 43.--THE LEFT ILIAC BONE OF THE HUMAN BEING:  EXTERNAL SURFACE, PLACED IN THE POSITION WHICH IT WOULD OCCUPY IN THE  SKELETON OF A QUADRUPED.    1, Cotyloid cavity; 2, ilium; 3, iliac crest; 4, anterior iliac crest;  5, posterior iliac spine; 6, pubis; 7, tuberosity of the ischium; 8,  obturator foramen; 9, ischiadic spine.]    [Illustration: FIG. 44.--LEFT ILIAC BONE OF A QUADRUPED (HORSE):  EXTERNAL SURFACE.    1, Cotyloid cavity; 2, ilium, external iliac fossa (directed upward in  the horse); 3, iliac crest; 4, anterior iliac spine (directed inwards in  the horse, it is the angle of the haunch); 5, posterior iliac spine  (directed inwards in the horse; it is the angle of the haunch); 6,  pubis; 7, tuberosity of the ischium; 8, obturator foramen; 9, ischiadic  spine, or subcotyloid foramen.]    The bones which form the skeleton of the pelvis of quadrupeds are  proportionally more elongated and less massive than those of the human  pelvis (Figs. 43 and 44).    We find, on the external surface of the iliac bone, the cotyloid cavity,  whose border is interrupted by the cotyloid notch; a deep notch which  looks downwards.    In front of this cavity is the ilium. This portion, narrow in the part  which is next the cavity, is directed forwards and upwards, expanding  more and more as it passes upwards. It presents an external or superior  surface (external in some animals, superior in others), which recalls  the external iliac fossa; and an internal or inferior surface, at the  superior part of which is found the auricular surface for articulation  with the sacrum.    The anterior border of the ilium is rough; this is the iliac crest, at  the extremities of which we find, below or outside, a prominence which  corresponds to the anterior superior iliac spine of man; and internally  another projection which corresponds to the posterior iliac spine.    Immediately above the cotyloid cavity is a rough crest, which is known  as the _supracotyloid crest_, which is, however, no other than the  homologue of the sciatic spine. In front of this prominence, the border  of the ilium, which is notched, forms the great sciatic notch.    If, still taking the cotyloid cavity as the point of departure, we  proceed inwards--that is, towards the median line of the body--we find  the pubis; if in a posterior direction, the ischium. These two portions,  pubis and ischium, limit an oval orifice, the subpubic foramen.    In the human skeleton, the pubis of one side is united to that of the  opposite side, to form the pubic symphysis. In the animals which we are  now studying a portion of the ischium enters into the formation of the  symphysis; in other words, it is formed, not only by the body of the  pubis, but also by the descending branch or ramus of the pubis and a  portion of the ascending branch or ramus of the ischium, which are fused  with those of the opposite side. It results that, though in the human  being the symphysis is short and the ischio-pubic arch large, in  quadrupeds it is the opposite. In them the arch is a mere slot, and  being formed by the ischium alone, merits the name of the ischial arch.  The ischio-pubic symphysis is very large, and forms a horizontal surface  relatively extensive, a sort of floor, on which rest certain organs  which occupy the cavity of the pelvis.    The posterior and external angle of the ischium is rough and prominent;  it is the tuberosity of the ischium. This forms a projection under the  skin; it also does in man when the trunk is strongly inclined forwards,  while the thighs are maintained in the vertical position. In  marsupials--opossum, kangaroo, and phalanger--the pelvis at its pubic  region is surmounted by two bones, situated one on each side of the  median line, and arranged in the form of a fork of two prongs (Fig. 45).  These, which are called _marsupial bones_, support the pouch which, in  animals of this genus, lodges their young, which, at the time of birth,  are incapable of supporting a separate existence, their development  being absolutely incomplete.    [Illustration: FIG. 45.--PUBIC REGION OF THE PELVIS OF A MARSUPIAL  (PHALANGER, FOX).    1, Symphysis pubis; 2, obturator foramen; 3, marsupial bones.]    In the cetaceans--for example, the dolphin--because of the absence of  posterior limbs, the pelvis is represented by two separate bones only,  which have no connection with the vertebral column. In birds, the pelvis  is remarkable for its elongated form (see for its form Fig. 21, and for  details Fig. 46). The cotyloid cavity is pierced by an opening, and  presents on its posterior border, which is here a little prominent, a  surface with which the great trochanter is in contact.    The ilium is very highly developed, and is fused in the median line with  the ilium of the opposite side, the last dorsal vertebrae, the lumbar  vertebrae, and the sacrum. Because of these relations with the dorsal  vertebrae, it is in contact anteriorly with the last ribs, which  consequently emerge from each side of the iliac region of the pelvis.    The ischium forms a plate of bone which, in part, closes the external  portion of the cavity of the pelvis. Its superior border is separate for  a certain distance from the external border of the ilium; there is thus  left an opening of more or less considerable size, which represents or  takes the place of the great sciatic notch.    [Illustration: FIG. 46.--PELVIS OF A BIRD (THE COCK): EXTERNAL SURFACE,  LEFT SIDE.    1, Ilium; 2, ischium; 3, pubis; 4, inferior extremity of the pubis; 5,  sciatic foramen; 6, oval foramen, homologous to the obturator; 7,  coccygeal vertebrae.]    The pubis, long and slender, is in connection with the inferior border  of the ischium, of which it follows the general direction; and  circumscribes with this latter, below the cotyloid cavity, an oval  orifice, which is the homologue of the obturator foramen. Its inferior  extremity reaches beyond the corresponding part of the ischium, bending  towards the middle line, but without joining the pubis of the opposite  side. On this account there is no symphysis pubis in birds.  Nevertheless, an exception must be noted in the case of the ostrich, the  pubic bones of which meet in the middle line, and are articulated in  form of a symphysis.      The Thigh    A single bone, the femur, forms the skeleton of this portion of the  lower limb.    =The Femur.=--The bone of the thigh is, in man, directed downwards and  inwards; this obliquity, we may remind the reader, is due to the  difference in length of the two condyles which form its inferior  extremity; the internal is the more prominent, the result of which is  that when the femur is held vertically, the internal condyle descends  lower than the external. Now, as those two articular expansions rest on  the horizontal plane formed by the upper extremity of the tibia, it  follows that the superior part of the femur inclines towards the side of  the shorter condyle--that is to say, outwards--and that, the leg being  vertical, it and the bone of the thigh unite in forming an angle, of  which the apex is directed towards the inner side of the knee.    In many mammals the two condyles are equally prominent, the result of  which is that the femur inclines neither inwards nor outwards, but is  contained in a plane parallel to the axis of the trunk; while the leg is  included in the same plane. Nevertheless, although contained in the  plane which we have just indicated, the femur is obliquely placed, and  directed downwards and forwards; it accordingly forms, with the pelvis,  an angle, of which the opening is directed to the anterior aspect of the  body.    In reptiles and in birds the femur and leg are both placed in the same  plane, but this plane is not parallel to the axis of the trunk. This is  the result, on the one hand, of the thorax being wide, and, on the other  hand, of the femur, which is directed forwards, being in contact by its  anterior extremity with the lateral aspect of the costal region, it is  thus necessarily placed in a direction forwards and outwards, and the  knee is further removed from the axis of the trunk than is the  articulation which unites the thigh with the pelvis.    The femur, like the humerus, is almost completely enveloped by muscular  masses, which bind it to the lateral walls of the abdomen. Its inferior  extremity alone is free, and is always the more so in proportion to its  elongation--that is to say, as it belongs to an animal whose foot is  more divided. The femur in this respect conforms to the law which we  have indicated in connection with the bone of the arm, in which the  development, as to length, is in proportion to the division of the hand.

We shall have no food soon; then shall we die, and the  Noongahburrah be no more seen on the Narrin. Then why, if he is able,  does not Wirreenun inake rain?\"    Soon these murmurs reached the ears of the old Wirreenun. He said  nothing, but the young fellows noticed that for two or three days in  succession he went to the waterhole in the creek and placed in it a  willgoo willgoo--a long stick, ornamented at the top with white cockatoo  feathers--and beside the stick he placed two big gubberah, that is, two  big, clear pebbles which at other times he always secreted about him,  in the folds of his waywah, or in the band or net on his head.  Especially was he careful to hide these stones from the women.    At the end of the third day Wirreenun said to the young men: \"Go you,  take your comeboos and cut bark sufficient to make dardurr for all the  tribe.\"    The young men did as they were bade. When they had the bark cut and  brought in Wirreenun said: \"Go you now and raise with ant-bed a high  place, and put thereon logs and wood for a fire, build the ant-bed  about a foot from the ground. Then put you a floor of ant-bed a foot  high whereever you are going to build a dardurr.\"    And they did what he told them. When the dardurr were finished, having  high floors of ant-bed and water-tight roofs of bark, Wirreenun  commanded the whole camp to come with him to the waterhole; men, women,  and children; all were to come. They all followed him down to the  creek, to the waterhole where he had placed the willgoo willgoo and  gubberah. Wirreenun jumped into the water and bade the tribe follow  him, which they did. There in the water they all splashed and played  about. After a little time Wirreenun went up first behind one black  fellow and then behind another, until at length he had been round them  all, and taken from the back of each one's head lumps of charcoal. When  he went up to each he appeared to suck the back or top of their heads,  and to draw out lumps of charcoal, which, as he sucked them out, he  spat into the water. When he had gone the round of all, he went out of  the water. But just as he got out a young man caught him up in his arms  and threw him back into the water. This happened several times, until  Wirreenun was shivering. That was the signal for all to leave the  creek. Wirreenun sent all the young people into a big bough shed, and  bade them all go to sleep. He and two old men and two old women stayed  outside. They loaded themselves with all their belongings piled up on  their backs, dayoorl stones and all, as if ready for a flitting. These  old people walked impatiently around the bough shed as if waiting a  signal to start somewhere. Soon a big black cloud appeared on the  horizon, first a single cloud, which, however, was soon followed by  others rising all round. They rose quickly until they all met just  overhead, forming a big black mass of clouds. As soon as this big,  heavy, rainladen looking cloud was stationary overhead, the old people  went into the bough shed and bade the young people wake up and come out  and look at the sky. When they were all roused Wirreenun told them to  lose no time, but to gather together all their possessions and hasten  to gain the shelter of the bark dardurr. Scarcely were they all in the  dardurrs and their spears well hidden when there sounded a terrific  clap of thunder, which was quickly followed by a regular cannonade,  lightning flashes shooting across the sky, followed by instantaneous  claps of deafening thunder. A sudden flash of lightning, which lit a  pathway, from heaven to earth, was followed by such a terrific clash  that the blacks thought their very camps were struck. But it was a tree  a little distance off. The blacks huddled together in their dardurrs,  frightened to move, the children crying with fear, and the dogs  crouching towards their owners.    \"We shall be killed,\" shrieked the women. The men said nothing but  looked as frightened.    Only Wirreenun was fearless. \"I will go out,\" he said, \"and stop the  storm from hurting us. The lightning shall come no nearer.\"    So out in front of the dardurrs strode Wirreenun, and naked he stood  there facing the storm, singing aloud, as the thunder roared and the  lightning flashed, the chant which was to keep it away from the camp      \"Gurreemooray, mooray,    Durreemooray, mooray, mooray,\" &c.    Soon came a lull in the cannonade, a slight breeze stirred the trees  for a few moments, then an oppressive silence, and then the rain in  real earnest began, and settled down to a steady downpour, which lasted  for some days.    When the old people had been patrolling the bough shed as the clouds  rose overhead, Wirreenun had gone to the waterhole and taken out the  willgoo willgoo and the stones, for he saw by the cloud that their work  was done.    When the rain was over and the country all green again, the blacks had  a great corrobboree and sang of the skill of Wirreenun, rainmaker to  the Noongahburrah.    Wirreenun sat calm and heedless of their praise, as he had been of  their murmurs. But he determined to show them that his powers were  great, so he summoned the rainmaker of a neighbouring tribe, and after  some consultation with him, he ordered the tribes to go to the  Googoorewon, which was then a dry plain, with the solemn, gaunt trees  all round it, which had once been black fellows.    When they were all camped round the edges of this plain, Wirreenun and  his fellow rainmaker made a great rain to fall just over the plain and  fill it with water.    When the plain was changed into a lake, Wirreenun said to the young men  of his tribe: \"Now take your nets and fish.\"    \"What good?\" said they. \"The lake is filled from the rain, not the  flood water of rivers, filled but yesterday, how then shall there be  fish?\"    \"Go,\" said Wirreenun. \"Go as I bid you; fish. If your nets catch  nothing then shall Wirreenun speak no more to the men of his tribe, he  will seek only honey and yams with the women.\"    More to please the man who had changed their country from a desert to a  hunter's paradise, they did as he bade them, took their nets and went  into the lake. And the first time they drew their nets, they were heavy  with goodoo, murree, tucki, and bunmillah. And so many did they catch  that all the tribes, and their dogs, had plenty.    Then the elders of the camp said now that there was plenty everywhere,  they would have a borah that the boys should be made young men. On one  of the ridges away from the camp, that the women should not know, would  they prepare a ground.    And so was the big borah of the Googoorewon held, the borah which was  famous as following on the triumph of Wirreenun the rainmaker.
