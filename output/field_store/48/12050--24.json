The study of 68 dried skeletons and 25 cleared and stained preparations,  including an ontogenetic series of _S. baudini_, has resulted in an  understanding of the progressive development of skeletal elements and a  knowledge of interspecific and intraspecific variation in these  elements. Furthermore, investigations of the osteology have provided  correlations between some cranial characters and certain aspects of  external morphology.    _Descriptive Osteology of Smilisca baudini_    The following description is based primarily on an adult female (KU  68184):    _Skull._--The skull is large, solid, and broader than long; the greatest  width is between the sutures of quadratojugal and maxillary on either  side of the skull (Pls. 2-3). The maxillaries bear well-developed dorsal  flanges, curve gently, join the moderately convex premaxillaries  anteriorly and form a slightly truncate snout. The combined premaxillary  width is about one-fourth the width of the skull. The premaxillaries are  separated medially, and laterally from the maxillaries by sutures. Each  premaxillary bears a dorsomedial alary process, which is anteriorly  convex and four times as high as the depth of the lateral wing of  premaxillary; each premaxillary also has a ventromedial palatine process  that projects dorsally from the lingual edge of the premaxillary. The  septomaxillaries are closely associated dorsally with the premaxillaries  immediately lateral to the prenasal processes.    The nasals are large, widest anteriorly and narrowing posteriorly,  parallel to maxillaries, and not separated from the ethmoid by  cartilage. The nasals bear long, delicate maxillary processes extending  nearly to the maxillaries. Anteriorly, the nasals are widely separated  by the partially ossified internasal septum, which is in contact with  the premaxillaries between the prenasal processes; the anterior points  of the nasals lie approximately one-half the distance between the  anterior ends of the ethmoid and the premaxillaries. The ethmoid is  large and completely ossified; the margins are smooth. The trunate  anterior edge lies between the nasals and is in contact with the  internasal septum. The frontoparietals are large, smooth-margined, and  bear large supraorbital flanges curving posterolaterally at the rear of  the orbit. A small, oval foramen involves the posterior part of the  ethmoid and anterior portion of frontoparietals; continued ossification  in older specimens fills in the foramen, thereby resulting in a solidly  roofed cranium. The auditory regions are relatively massive and bear  narrow tegmen tympani; the distal ends of the tegmen tympani are medial  to the lateral edge of the pterygoids in dorsal view. The squamosals are  large; the long anterior arm is separated from the maxillary by a  suture. The delicate, spindle-shaped columellae lie ventral to the  tegmen tympani and squamosals, are spatulate distally, and have a broad  basal attachment to the auditory region.    The vomers are moderately large and are in contact anteriorly with the  premaxillaries and posteriorly with the ethmoid. Each vomer has two wide  serrated flanges laterally. The tooth-bearing parts of the vomers are  widely separated and at a slight angle to one another; the vomers  terminate medially in two pointed processes on the ethmoid. The  palatines are edentate, but bear strong ridges throughout their lengths.  They are broadly in contact with the maxillary, are narrow medially, and  are attached by pointed processes to the medial part of the ethmoid.  The pterygoids are large, attached to the maxillaries immediately  anterior and medial to the squamosal-maxillary connection, bear  well-developed pedicles, which are broadly attached to the prooetic, and  a wide wing is in contact posteriorly with the distal two-thirds of the  quadrate.    The angular makes up most of the lower jaw, bears a broad articular  surface posteriorly, and has a small coronoid process on the lingual  edge; anteriorly the angular is separated from the dentary and  mentomecklian by Meckel's cartilage. The dentary lies external to the  angular and extends from the mentomecklian to approximately the  mid-length of the angular. The mentomecklians are ossified, but  separated by cartilage medially.    _Hyoid._--The hyoid plate is curved, thin, and mostly cartilaginous, but  calcined posteriorly (Fig. 6). The anterior cornua are slender,  cartilaginous, and curve anteromedially from the hyoid plate and thence  laterally and posteriorly, to attach to the posterior surface of the  prooetics. The lateral cornua are broad, flat, cartilaginous lateral  extensions from the bases of the anterior cornua. The posterior cornua  are bony, except distally.        [Illustration: FIG. 6.

KU 64220, x5.]    _Vertebral Column._--The atlas lacks transverse processes and a neural  crest, whereas transverse processes are present on the other seven  presacral vertebrae, and knoblike neural crests are present on the  second, third, and fourth vertebrae; a faint neural ridge is visible on  the fifth vertebra. The transverse processes are directed laterally on  the second and sixth vertebrae, ventrolaterally on the third,  posterolaterally on the fourth and fifth, and anterolaterally on the  seventh and eighth. The processes are slightly expanded on the fourth,  and more so on the fifth, vertebra. The sacral diapophyses are expanded  and have a border of calcified cartilage laterally. There are two sacral  condyles. The slender coccyx has a thin dorsal ridge on the anterior  three-fourths of its length.    _Pectoral Girdle._--The omosternum is large, ovoid, and cartilaginous;  the sternum is a thin cartilaginous sheet deeply notched posteriorly and  is not differentiated into episternal and xiphisternal elements. The  coracoids are robust, twice as stout as the clavicles. The epicoracoidal  cartilages overlap in the usual arciferal manner, except that they are  fused anteriorly between the slender clavicles. The clavicles are  strongly arched. The clavicle, coracoid, and scapula on each side form a  bony articulation at the glenoid fossa. A bifurcation of the ventral end  of the scapula results in a large glenoid foramen. The scapula is flat  and expanded dorsally; the suprascapula is broad, flat, and calcified in  large adults. In young specimens no distinct ossification of the  cleithrum or ossification of endochondral centers are evident.    _Arm and Hand._--The humerus is equally well-developed in both sexes and  has a prominent lateral crest. The radius and ulna are completely fused.  A bony prepollex is present in both sexes. The metacarpals are about  equal in length. The phalangeal formula is 2-2-3-3; the terminal  phalanges are claw-shaped.    _Pelvic Girdle._--The ilia are long, slender, and slightly curved. A  thin ridge projects laterally from the dorsal edge of the posterior  one-half of each ilium. The ilial prominence is large and knoblike when  viewed from above. The anterior edge of the ilial prominence is at the  level of the anterior edge of the acetabular border. The dorsal  acetabular expansion is small. The pubis is slender, and the ischium is  elevated and robust.    _Leg and Foot._--The slightly curved femur has a distinct crest  proximally on the posterior surface. The nearly straight tibio-fibula is  slightly longer than the femur. The tibial and fibial elements are  completely fused but have a distinct cleft between them. A small foramen  exists at the mid-length of the tibio-fibula. The fibulare (calcaneum)  is much more robust than the tibiale (astragalus). The prehallux is  large and flat. The metatarsals of the third, fourth, and fifth digits  are equal in length; the metatarsal of the second is somewhat shorter,  and that of the first is much shorter. The phalangeal formula is  2-2-3-4-3; the terminal phalanges are claw-shaped.    _Developmental Cranial Morphology of Smilisca baudini_    The following description of development of the skull of _Smilisca  baudini_ is based on the examination of 12 cleared and stained  specimens. In table 3 the cranial bones are listed in the left hand  column in the approximate order of their appearance in the young frogs.  Across the top of the table selected specimens designated by  developmental stage or snout-vent length are listed. It should be noted  that although each individual, from left to right, has an increasing  number of ossified bones, the correlation with increasing size is  imperfect; the precise ages of the individuals are unknown.    The first bones to appear are the septomaxillaries, frontoparietals,  part of the exoccipital, and the parasphenoid in developmental stage 40.  The frontoparietals are represented by two slender ossifications  dorsomedial to the orbits; the septomaxillaries are present as small  ossifications anterior to the nasal capsules (Pl. 1A). The parasphenoid  is present as a faint median ossification, and the exoccipital shows  some ossification.

He was supposed to exercise a  certain influence over many of the large villages, but the influence  was lessened by the feeling entertained by the Nagas that our stay  in the hills was uncertain, and that for all practical purposes the  Manipuris were the power most to be reckoned with, and from our  point of view it was very desirable that our headquarter station  should be removed to Kohima. A dispute with Mozuma, due chiefly to  our vacillating conduct, was now going on, but its chiefs would not  accept our terms, and an expedition to coerce them was in preparation  in which I was to take part. Mr. Carnegy was political officer, a man  of ability and determination, and very pleasant to deal with. During  the dispute with Mozuma, the other villages held aloof, thinking Mozuma  was able to hold its own, and waiting to see which side gained the day.    Burmah was still under its native rulers. There were constant frontier  disputes going on between it and Manipur, but that state of things  was chronic.    To the south of Manipur, the Chin and Lushai tribes were quiet.    There was a long standing boundary dispute between Manipur and the  Naga Hills. The boundary had been most arbitrarily settled by us  when the survey was carried out, so far as a certain point, beyond  that it was vague. Manipur claimed territory which we certainly did  not possess, and which she had visited from time to time, but did not  actually hold in subjection. Other portions, as I afterwards proved,  were occupied by her, though the fact had not been ascertained. Over  and over again efforts had been made to bring the Durbar to terms,  but without success. I determined to grapple with the question at  once. I took a map and drew a line including all that I thought Manipur  entitled to, in the neighbourhood of the Naga Hills, and advised the  Maharajah to accept the arrangement on the understanding that when I  visited the country claimed further eastward, I would recommend the  Government of India to allow him to retain all that he actually held in  his possession. This was agreed to by him and confirmed by Government,  and I believe that substantial justice was done to both parties.    I should like to have seen Manipur get more, as a set-off against our  unjust treatment in former years, but as we were sure eventually, to  occupy all the Naga Hills, it was necessary to make such an adjustment  as would not injure British interests in the future.                CHAPTER XI.        My early days in Manipur--The capital--The inhabitants--Good      qualities of Manipuris--Origin of valley of Manipur--Expedition      to the Naga Hills--Lovely scenery--Attack on Kongal Tannah by      Burmese--Return from Naga Hills--Visit Kongal Tannah.      The first few weeks in Manipur were taken up in making acquaintance  with the place and people, and doing all that was possible to disarm  the fears of the Durbar. Never was there one so suspicious. At  first all my movements were watched, and wherever I went spies,  open or secret, followed; however, I encouraged it to the utmost,  and told the officials to inquire into everything I did, and they  very soon saw that there was no necessity for special espionage,  though all my acts were still noted and reported. Several little  difficulties cropped up regarding British subjects, and required some  care in dealing with them. In one case, a man had taken upon himself  to intrigue with some of the Nagas under Manipur, and urged them to  declare themselves British subjects, and in another, a man had robbed  the Maharajah. In both instances the Durbar had acted foolishly and  precipitately, though under much provocation. However, I turned both  men out of the country, with orders never to return.    The question of British subjects and their rights was one that gave  me much trouble for years. Judging by a decision of the High Court  of Calcutta that all the descendants of European British subjects  were European British subjects, I insisted on all descendants  of British subjects being considered as such, and subject to my  jurisdiction. After a long struggle I carried my point, and it very  greatly strengthened my position.    A few more words about the capital and the Manipuris may not be  amiss. Imphal, as has been said, [20] covered a space of fifteen  square miles. On the north side it touches on some low hills, called  Ching-mai-roong, and running westward is bounded by a shallow lake,  which is partly enclosed by a continuation of the hills, here called  Langol, on which grows a celebrated cane used for polo sticks. Then,  running south, it is intersected by several roads, notably the road  to Silchar, which enters the capital at a place called Kooak-Kaithel  (i.e. crow bazaar). Here it is bounded by rice cultivation. Going  farther south, and sweeping round in an easterly direction, it is  bounded by the Plain of Lang-thabal, at one extremity of which lies  the old capital; here two rivers intersect it. And going farther east,  it is bounded by the lower slopes of a hill rising 2500 feet above the  valley. Then turning to the northward and crossing two rivers, we come  again to the place from which we started. The want of the town was a  good water-supply; there were one or two fair-sized tanks, or ponds,  as they would be called in England, and the afore-mentioned rivers,  of which the water is not improved by receiving the ashes of the  dead burned on their banks. Beyond this, all the water obtainable was  derived from small ponds, one or more of which was to be found in every  garden enclosure. The ground on which the capital stands must at one  time have been very low, probably a marsh, and it has been artificially  raised from time to time by digging these tanks; every raised road,  too, meant a deep stagnant ditch on either side. The people are not  sanitary in their habits, and when heavy rain falls the gardens are  flooded, and a fair share of the accumulated filth is washed into  the drinking-tanks, the result being frequent epidemics of cholera.    The Manipuris themselves are a fine stalwart race descended from an  Indo-Chinese stock, with some admixture of Aryan blood, derived from  the successive waves of Aryan invaders that have passed through the  valley in prehistoric days. It may be this, or from an admixture of  Chinese blood, but certainly the Manipuris have stable and industrious  qualities which the Burmese and Shans do not possess. Since then the  race has been constantly fed by additions from the various hill-tribes  surrounding the valley. The result is a fairly homogeneous people of  great activity and energy, with much of the Japanese aptitude for  acquiring new arts. The men seem capable of learning anything, and  the women are famous as weavers, and in many cases have completely  killed out the manufacture of cloths formerly peculiar to certain  of the hill-tribes, over whom the Manipuris have obtained mastery  by superior intellect. They are always cheerful, even on a long and  trying march, and are good-humoured under any difficulties and never  apparently conscious of fatigue. They are very abstemious, and live  chiefly on rice and fish, which is often rotten from preference. Though  rigid Hindoos outwardly, they have a curious custom by which a man  of low caste, marrying a high-caste woman, can be adopted into her  tribe, the exact reverse of what prevails in India, where a woman of  high caste marrying a low-caste man is hopelessly degraded and her  children outcasts.    It is impossible for those who have marched much in the hills with  Manipuris to avoid liking them. Their caste prejudices, though rigid,  give no trouble to others. Hungry or not, they are always ready to  march, and march all day and all night, if necessary. Still, the  Indo-Chinese races exceed even the ordinary Asiatic in reserve and  sphinx-like characteristics, and the Manipuris are an inscrutable  set. I had many intimate friends among them, yet, on the whole,  prefer the pure Hindoo.    What is now the valley of Manipur was evidently once a series of  valleys and ranges of hills, between the higher ranges which now border  it and converge to the south. The rivers now flowing through the valley  then flowed through it like the Barak, Eerung, and others, at a much  lower level. One of the great earthquakes, to which these regions are  so subject, closed the outlet and raised a permanent barrier; thus  a lake was formed, and in the course of ages the alluvium brought  down by the streams filled it up to its present level leaving the  Logtak Lake in its lowest part, a lake which has constantly lessened  and is still lessening in size. The crests of the sunken ranges are  still to be seen running down the valley, and mostly parallel to the  bordering ranges, such are Langol, Langthabal, Phoiching, Lokching,  and others. Sometimes a river, as at a place called \"Eeroce Semba,\"  runs at the base of a hill, and cuts away the alluvium, showing the  solid rock. This alluvium forms one of the deepest and richest soils  in the world.    I have referred to the proposed expedition to the Naga Hills, to aid  the troops there in the operations against the powerful village of  Mozuma. In order to take part in this expedition I had brought up one  hundred men of the 35th Native Infantry, from Cachar, and I started  from Manipur on December 3rd, 1877, having sent on the 35th and a  Manipuri force of over three hundred men under the Minister Bularam  Singh. I rode out the first day to Mayang Khang, a distance of forty  miles, where I caught up my men. I passed Sengmai"]]]
