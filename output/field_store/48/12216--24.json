I could see her through the crack of  the door, she actually seemed disappointed at not finding me there.    \"'What noise was that I heard, Flora?' she said, speakin' as mild as  if she was actilly afraid to wake the cat up.    \"Flora lifted the centre of the muslin she was starching with one  hand, and makin' a hollow under it in the palm of the other, she held  it close up to the old woman's face, and clapped it; and it made the  very identical sound of the smack she had heard, and the dear child  repeated it in quick succession several times. The old lady jumped  back the matter of a foot or more, she positively looked skared, as if  the old gentleman would think somebody was a kissin' of her.    \"Oh dear, I thought I should have teeheed right out. She seemed  utterly confounded, and Flora looked, as she was, the dear critter, so  artless and innocent! It dumbfoundered her completely. Still she  warn't quite satisfied.    \"'What's this chair doing so far in the chimbley corner?' said she.    \"How glad I was there warn't two there. The fact is, we never used but  one, we was quite young, and it was always big enough for us both.    \"Flora talked Gaelic as fast as hail, slipt off her shoes, sat down on  it, put her feet to the fire, folded her arms across her bosom, laid  her head back and looked so sweet and so winnin' into mother's face,  and said, 'cha n'eil Beurl' (I have no English), and then proceeded in  Gaelic--    \"'If you hadn't sat in that place yourself, when you was young, I  guess you wouldn't be so awful scared at it, you old goose you.'    \"I thought I never saw her look so lovely. Mother was not quite  persuaded she was wrong after all. She looked all round agin, as if  she was sure I was there, and then came towards the door where I was,  so I sloped up-stairs like a shadow on the wall, and into bed in no  time; but she followed up and came close to me, and holdin the candle  in my face, said:    \"'Sam, are you asleep?'    \"Well, I didn't answer.    \"'Sam,' said she, 'why don't you speak?' and she shook me.    \"'Hullo,' sais I, pretendin' to wake up, 'what's the matter! have I  overslept myself? is it time to get up?' and I put out my arm to rub  my eyes, and lo and behold I exposed my coat sleeve.    \"'No, Sam,' said she, 'you couldn't oversleep yourself, for you  haven't slept at all, you ain't even ondressed.'    \"'Ain't I,' said I, 'are you sure?'    \"'Why look here,' said she, throwin' down the clothes and pullin' my  coat over my head till she nearly strangled me.    \"'Well, I shouldn't wonder if I hadn't stripped,' sais I. 'When a  feller is so peskilly sleepy as I be, I suppose he is glad to turn in  any way.'    \"She never spoke another word, but I saw a storm was brewin, and I  heard her mutter to herself, 'Creation! what a spot of work! I'll have  no teaching of 'mother tongue' here.' Next morning she sent me to  Boston of an errand, and when I returned, two days after, Flora was  gone to live with sister Sally. I have never forgiven myself for that  folly; but really it all came of our being so artless and so innocent.  There was no craft in either of us. She forgot to remove the chair  from the chimbley corner, poor simple-minded thing, and I forgot to  keep my coat sleeve covered. Yes, yes, it all came of our being too  innocent; but that's the way, ladies, I learned Gaelic.\"                                     CHAPTER VI.                           THE WOUNDS OF THE HEART.      When I took leave of the family I returned to the room where I had  left Peter and the doctor, but they had both retired. And as my  chamber adjoined it, I sat by the fire, lighted a cigar, and fell into  one of my rambling meditations.    Here, said I to myself, is another phase of life. Peter is at once a  Highlander, a Canadian, a trapper, a backwoodsman, and a coaster. His  daughters are half Scotch and half Indian, and have many of the  peculiarities of both races. There is even between these sisters a  wide difference in intellect, appearance, and innate refinement. The  doctor has apparently abandoned his profession for the study of  nature, and quit the busy haunts of men for the solitude of the  forest. He seems to think and act differently from any one else in the  country. Here too we have had Cutler, who is a scholar and a skilful  navigator, filling the berth of a master of a fishing craft. He began  life with nothing but good principles and good spirits, and is now  about entering on a career, which in a few years will lead to a great  fortune. He is as much out of place where he is, as a salmon would be  in a horse pond. And here am I, Squire, your humble servant, Sam Slick  the Clockmaker, not an eccentric man, I hope, for I detest them, they  are either mad, or wish to be thought so, because madness they suppose  to be an evidence of genius; but a specimen of a class not uncommon in  the States, though no other country in the world but Yankeedoodledum  produces it.    This is a combination these colonies often exhibit, and what a fool a  man must be when character is written in such large print, if he can't  read it even as he travels on horseback.    Of all the party assembled here to-night, the Scotch lasses alone, who  came in during the evening, are what you call everyday galls. They are  strong, hearty, intelligent, and good-natured, full of fun and  industry, can milk, churn, make butter and cheese, card, spin, and  weave, and will make capital wives for farmers of their own station in  life. As such, they are favourable representatives of their class, and  to my mind, far, far above those that look down upon them, who ape,  but can't copy, and have the folly, because they sail in the wake of  larger craft, to suppose they can be mistaken for anything else than  tenders. Putting three masts into a coaster may make her an object of  ridicule, but can never give her the appearance of a ship. They know  this in England, they have got to learn it yet in the Provinces.    Well, this miscellaneous collection of people affords a wide field for  speculation. Jessie is a remarkable woman, I must ask the doctor about  her history. I see there is a depth of feeling about her, a simplicity  of character, a singular sensitiveness, and a shade of melancholy. Is  it constitutional, or does it arise from her peculiar position? I  wonder how she reasons, and what she thinks, and how she would talk,  if she would say what she thinks. Has she ability to build up a theory  of her own, or does she, like half the women in the world, only think  of a thing as it occurs? Does she live in instances or in  generalities, I'll draw her out and see. Every order, where there are  orders, and every class (and no place is without them where women  are), have a way of judging in common with their order or class. What  is her station I wonder in her own opinion? What are her expectations?  What are her notions of wedlock? All girls regard marriage as an  enviable lot, or a necessary evil. If they tell us they don't, it's  because the right man hante come. And therefore I never mind what they  say on this subject. I have no doubt they mean it; but they don't know  what they are a talking about.    You, Squire, may go into a ball-room, where there are two hundred  women. One hundred and ninety-nine of them you will pass with as much  indifference as one hundred and ninety-nine pullets; but the two  hundredth irresistibly draws you to her. There are one hundred  handsomer, and ninety-nine cleverer ones present; but she alone has  the magnet that attracts you. Now, what is that magnet? Is it her  manner that charms? is it her voice that strikes on one of those  thousand and one chords of your nervous system, and makes it vibrate,  as sound does hollow glass? Or do her eyes affect your gizzard, so  that you have no time to chew the cud of reflection, and no  opportunity for your head to judge how you can digest the notions they  have put into it? Or is it animal magnetism, or what the plague is it?    You are strangely affected; nobody else in the room is, and everybody  wonders at you. But so it is. It's an even chance if you don't  perpetrate matrimony. Well, that's a thing that sharpens the eyesight,  and will remove a cateract quicker than an oculist can, to save his  soul alive. It metamorphoses an angel into a woman, and it's plaguey  lucky if the process don't go on and change her into something else.    After I got so far in my meditations, I lit another cigar, and took  out my watch to look at the time. \"My eyes,\" sais I, \"if it tante past  one o'clock at night. Howsomever, it ain't often I get a chance to be  alone, and I will finish this here weed, at any rate.\" Arter which I  turned in. The following morning I did not rise as early as usual, for  it's a great secret for a man never to be in the way, especially in a  house like Peter's, where his daughters had, in course, a good deal to  see to themselves. So I thought I'd turn over and take another snoose;  and do you know, Squire, that is always a dreamy one, and if your mind  ain't worried, or your digestion askew, it's more nor probable you  will have pleasant ones.    When I went into the keeping-room, I found Jessie and her sister  there, the table set, and everything prepared for me.    \"Mr Slick,\" said the elder one, \"your breakfast is ready.\"    \"But where is your father?\" said I, \"and Doctor Ovey?\"    \"Oh, they have gone to the next harbour, Sir, to see a man who is very  ill there. The doctor left a message for you, he said he wanted to see  you again very much, and hoped to find you here on his return, which  will be about four o'clock in the afternoon. He desired me to say, if  you sailed before he got back, he hoped you would leave word what port  he would find you in, as he would follow you.\"    \"Oh,\" said I, \"we shall not go before to-morrow, at the earliest, so  he will be in very good time. But who in the world is Doctor Ovey?

He took me up, in a kinder manner than ever I had known; and he said,  Shut the door, Pamela, and come to me in my closet: I want to have a  little serious talk with you. How can I, sir, said I, how can I! and  wrung my hands. O pray, sir, let me go out of your presence, I beseech  you! By the God that made me, said he, I'll do you no harm. Shut the  parlour door, and come to me in my library.    He then went into his closet, which is his library, and full of rich  pictures besides; a noble apartment, though called a closet, and next  the private garden, into which it has a door that opens. I shut the  parlour door, as he bid me; but stood at it irresolute. Place some  confidence in me, said he: Surely you may, when I have spoken thus  solemnly. So I crept towards him with trembling feet, and my heart  throbbing through my handkerchief. Come in, said he, when I bid you. I  did so. Pray, sir, said I, pity and spare me. I will, said he, as I hope  to be saved. He sat down upon a rich settee; and took hold of my hand,  and said, Don't doubt me, Pamela. From this moment I will no more  consider you as my servant: and I desire you'll not use me with  ingratitude for the kindness I am going to express towards you. This a  little emboldened me; and he said, holding both my hands between his,  You have too much wit and good sense not to discover, that I, in spite  of my heart, and all the pride of it, cannot but love you. Yes, look  up to me, my sweet-faced girl! I must say I love you; and have put on a  behaviour to you, that was much against my heart, in hopes to frighten  you from your reservedness. You see I own it ingenuously; and don't play  your sex upon me for it.    I was unable to speak; and he, seeing me too much oppressed with  confusion to go on in that strain, said, Well, Pamela, let me know in  what situation of life is your father: I know he is a poor man; but is  he as low and as honest as he was when my mother took you?    Then I could speak a little; and with a down look, (and I felt my face  glow like fire,) I said, Yes, sir, as poor and as honest too; and that  is my pride. Says he, I will do something for him, if it be not your  fault, and make all your family happy. All, sir, said I, he is happier  already than ever he can be, if his daughter's innocence is to be the  price of your favour: and I beg you will not speak to me on the only  side that can wound me. I have no design of that sort, said he. O sir,  said I, tell me not so, tell me not so!--'Tis easy, said he, for me to  be the making of your father, without injuring you. Well, sir, said I,  if this can be done, let me know how; and all I can do with innocence  shall be the study and practice of my life.--But, O! what can such a  poor creature as I do, and do my duty?--Said he, I would have you stay a  week or fortnight only, and behave yourself with kindness to me; I  stoop to beg it of you, and you shall see all shall turn out beyond your  expectation. I see, said he, you are going to answer otherwise than I  would have you; and I begin to be vexed I should thus meanly sue; and so  I will say, that your behaviour before honest Longman, when I used you  as I did, and you could so well have vindicated yourself, has quite  charmed me. And though I am not pleased with all you said yesterday,  while I was in the closet, yet you have moved me more to admire you than  before; and I am awakened to see more worthiness in you, than ever I  saw in any lady in the world. All the servants, from the highest to the  lowest, doat upon you, instead of envying you; and look upon you in so  superior a light, as speaks what you ought to be. I have seen more  of your letters than you imagine, (This surprised me!) and am quite  overcome with your charming manner of writing, so free, so easy, and  many of your sentiments so much above your years, and your sex; and all  put together, makes me, as I tell you, love you to extravagance. Now,  Pamela, when I have stooped to acknowledge all this, oblige me only  to stay another week or fortnight, to give me time to bring about some  certain affairs, and you shall see how much you may find your account in  it.    I trembled to find my poor heart giving way.--O good sir, said I, spare  a poor girl that cannot look up to you, and speak. My heart is full;  and why should you wish to undo me?--Only oblige me, said he, to stay a  fortnight longer, and John shall carry word to your father, that I will  see him in the time, either here, or at the Swan in his village. O sir,  said I, my heart will burst; but, on my bended knees, I beg you to  let me go to-morrow, as I designed: and don't offer to tempt a poor  creature, whose whole will would be to do yours, if my virtue would  permit!--I shall permit it, said he; for I intend no injury to you, God  is my witness! Impossible! said I; I cannot, sir, believe you, after  what has passed: How many ways are there to undo poor creatures! Good  God, protect me this one time, and send me but to my dear father's  cot in safety!--Strange, d----d fate! said he, that when I speak so  solemnly, I can't be believed!--What should I believe, sir? said I, what  can I believe? What have you said, but that I am to stay a fortnight  longer? and what then is to become of me?--My pride of birth and fortune  (d--n them both! said he, since they cannot obtain credit with you, but  must add to your suspicions) will not let me descend all at once; and  I ask you but a fortnight's stay, that, after this declaration, I may  pacify those proud demands upon me.    O how my heart throbbed! and I began (for I did not know what I did) to  say the Lord's prayer. None of your beads to me Pamela! said he; thou  art a perfect nun, I think.    But I said aloud, with my eyes lifted up to heaven, Lead me not into  temptation: but deliver me from evil, O my good God! He hugged me in his  arms, and said, Well, my dear girl, then you stay this fortnight, and  you shall see what I will do for you--I'll leave you a moment, and walk  into the next room, to give you time to think of it, and to shew you I  have no design upon you. Well, this, I thought, did not look amiss.    He went out, and I was tortured with twenty different doubts in a  minute; sometimes I thought that to stay a week or fortnight longer in  this house to obey him, while Mrs. Jervis was with me, could do no great  harm: But then, thought I, how do I know what I may be able to do? I  have withstood his anger; but may I not relent at his kindness?--How  shall I stand that.--Well, I hope, thought I, by the same protecting  grace in which I will always confide!--But, then, what has he promised?  Why, he will make my poor father and mother's life comfortable. O! said  I to myself, that is a rich thought; but let me not dwell upon it, for  fear I should indulge it to my ruin.--What can he do for me, poor girl  as I am!--What can his greatness stoop to! He talks, thought I, of his  pride of heart, and pride of condition; O these are in his head, and in  his heart too, or he would not confess them to me at such an instant.  Well then, thought I, this can be only to seduce me.--He has promised  nothing.--But I am to see what he will do, if I stay a fortnight; and  this fortnight, thought I again, is no such great matter; and I shall  see in a few days how he carries it.--But then, when I again reflected  upon this distance between him and me, and his now open declaration of  love, as he called it; and that after this he would talk with me on that  subject more plainly than ever, and I shall be less armed, may be,  to withstand him; and then I bethought myself, why, if he meant no  dishonour, he should not speak before Mrs. Jervis; and the odious  frightful closet came again into my head, and my narrow escape upon it;  and how easy it might be for him to send Mrs. Jervis and the maids out  of the way; and so that all the mischief he designed me might be brought  about in less than that time; I resolved to go away and trust all to  Providence, and nothing to myself. And how ought I to be thankful for  this resolution!--as you shall hear.    But just as I have writ to this place, John sends me word, that he is  going this minute your way; and so I will send you so far as I have  written, and hope by to-morrow night, to ask your blessings, at your own  poor, but happy abode, and tell you the rest by word of mouth; and so I  rest, till then, and for ever, Your dutiful DAUGHTER.          LETTER XXXI      DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,    I will continue my writing still, because, may be, I shall like to  read it, when I am with you, to see what dangers I have been enabled to  escape; and though I bring it along with me.    I told you my resolution, my happy resolution as I have reason to think  it: and just then he came in again, with great kindness in his looks,  and said, I make no doubt, Pamela, you will stay this fortnight to  oblige me. I knew not how to frame my words so as to deny, and yet not  make him storm. But, said I, Forgive, sir, your poor distressed servant.  I know I cannot possibly deserve any favour at your hands, consistent  with virtue; and I beg you will let me go to my poor father. Why, said  he, thou art the veriest fool that I ever knew. I tell you I will  see your father; I'll send for him hither to-morrow, in my travelling  chariot, if you will; and I'll let him know what I intend to do for  him and you. What, sir, may I ask you, can that be? Your honour's noble  estate may easily make him happy, and not unuseful, perhaps to you, in  some respect or other. But what price am I to pay for all this?--You  shall be happy as you can wish, said he, I do assure you: And here I  will now give you this purse, in which are fifty guineas, which I will  allow your father yearly, and find an employ suitable to his liking, to  deserve that and more: Pamela, he "]]]
