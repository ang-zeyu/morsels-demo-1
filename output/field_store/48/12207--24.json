The problem dramatist, in place of broad effect and truth to nature, must  find it in stress of invention and resource of that kind.  Thus care and  concentration must be all in all with him--he must never let himself go,  or get so interested and taken with his characters that _they_, in a  sense, control or direct him.  He is all too conscious a \"maker\" and must  pay for his originality by what in the end is really painful and  overweighted work.  This, I take it, is the reason why so many of the  modern dramatists find their work so hard, and are, comparatively, so  slow in the production of it, while they would fain, by many devices,  secure the general impression or appeal made to all classes alike by the  natural or what we may call spontaneous drama, they are yet, by the  necessity of subject matter and methods of dealing with it, limited to  the real interest of a special class--to whom is finally given up what  was meant for mankind--and the troublesome and trying task laid on them,  to try as best they may to reconcile two really conflicting tendencies  which cannot even by art be reconciled but really point different ways  and tend to different ends.  As the impressionist and the pre-Raphaelite,  in the sister-art of painting cannot be combined and reconciled in one  painter--so it is here; by conception and methods they go different ways,  and if they _seek_ the same end, it is by opposing processes--the  original conception alike of nature and of art dictating the process.    As for Stevenson, it was no lack of care or concentration in anything  that he touched; these two were never lacking, but because his subtlety,  mystical bias and dreaminess, and theorising on human nature made this to  him impossible.  He might have concentrated as much as he pleased,  concentrated as much as even Mr Pinero desires, but he would not have  made a successful drama, because he was Robert Louis Stevenson, and not  Mr Pinero, and too long, as he himself confessed, had a tendency to think  bad-heartedness was strength; while the only true and enduring joy  attainable in this world--whether by deduction from life itself, or from  _impressions_ of art or of the drama, is simply the steady, unassailable,  and triumphant consciousness that it is not so, but the reverse, that  goodness and self-sacrifice and self-surrender are the only strength in  the universe.  Just as Byron had it with patriotism:--       \"Freedom's battle once begun,     Bequeathed from bleeding sire to son,     Tho' baffled oft is ever won.\"    To go consciously either in fiction or in the drama for bad-heartedness  as strength, is to court failure--the broad, healthy, human heart, thank  Heaven, is so made as to resent the doctrine; and if a fiction or a play  based on this idea for the moment succeeds, it can only be because of  strength in other elements, or because of partial blindness and partially  paralysed moral sense in the case of those who accept it and joy in it.  If Mr Pinero directly disputes this, then he and I have no common  standing-ground, and I need not follow the matter any further.  Of  course, the dramatist may, under mistaken sympathy and in the midst of  complex and bewildering concatenations, give wrong readings to his  audience, but he must not be always doing even that, or doing it on  principle or system, else his work, however careful and concentrated,  will before long share the fate of the Stevenson-Henley dramas  confessedly wrought when the authors all too definitely held  bad-heartedness was strength.          CHAPTER XV--THEORY OF GOOD AND EVIL      We have not hitherto concerned ourselves, in any express sense, with the  ethical elements involved in the tendency now dwelt on, though they are,  of necessity, of a very vital character.  We have shown only as yet the  effect of this mood of mind on dramatic intention and effort.  The  position is simply that there is, broadly speaking, the endeavour to  eliminate an element which is essential to successful dramatic  presentation.  That element is the eternal distinction, speaking broadly,  between good and evil--between right and wrong--between the secret  consciousness of having done right, and the consciousness of mere  strength and force in certain other ways.    Nothing else will make up for vagueness and cloudiness here--no technical  skill, no apt dialogue nor concentration, any more than \"fine speeches,\"  as Mr Pinero calls them.  Now the dramatic demand and the ethical demand  here meet and take each other's hands, and will not be separated.  This  is why Mr Stevenson and Mr Henley--young men of great talent,  failed--utterly failed--they thought they could make a hero out of a  shady and dare-devil yet really cowardly villain generally--and failed.    The spirit of this is of the clever youth type--all too ready to forego  the moral for the sake of the fun any day of the week, and the unthinking  selfishness and self-enjoyment of youth--whose tender mercies are often  cruel, are transcendent in it.  As Stevenson himself said, they were  young men then and fancied bad-heartedness was strength.  Perhaps it was  a sense of this that made R. L. Stevenson speak as he did of the _Ebb-  Tide_ with Huish the cockney in it, after he was powerless to recall it;  which made him say, as we have seen, that the closing chapters of _The  Master of Ballantrae_ \"_shame_, _and perhaps degrade_, _the beginning_.\"  He himself came to see then the great error; but, alas! it was too late  to remedy it--he could but go forward to essay new tales, not backward to  put right errors in what was done.    Did Mr William Archer have anything of this in his mind and the  far-reaching effects on this side, when he wrote the following:       \"Let me add that the omission with which, in 1885, I mildly reproached     him--the omission to tell what he knew to be an essential part of the     truth about life--was abundantly made good in his later writings.  It     is true that even in his final philosophy he still seems to me to     underrate, or rather to shirk, the significance of that most     compendious parable which he thus relates in a letter to Mr Henry     James:--'Do you know the story of the man who found a button in his     hash, and called the waiter?  \"What do you call that?\" says he.     \"Well,\" said the waiter, \"what d'you expect?  Expect to find a gold     watch and chain?\"  Heavenly apologue, is it not?'  Heavenly, by all     means; but I think Stevenson relished the humour of it so much that he     'smiling passed the moral by.'  In his enjoyment of the waiter's     effrontery, he forgot to sympathise with the man (even though it was     himself) who had broken his teeth upon the harmful, unnecessary     button.  He forgot that all the apologetics in the world are based     upon just this audacious paralogism.\"    Many writers have done the same--and not a few critics have hinted at  this: I do not think any writer has got at the radical truth of it more  directly, decisively, and clearly than \"J. F. M.,\" in a monthly magazine,  about the time of Stevenson's death; and the whole is so good and clear  that I must quote it--the writer was not thinking of the drama specially;  only of prose fiction, and this but makes the passage the more effective  and apt to my point.       \"In the outburst of regret which followed the death of Robert Louis     Stevenson, one leading journal dwelt on his too early removal in     middle life 'with only half his message delivered.'  Such a phrase may     have been used in the mere cant of modern journalism.  Still it set     one questioning what was Stevenson's message, or at least that part of     it which we had time given us to hear.       \"Wonderful as was the popularity of the dead author, we are inclined     to doubt whether the right appreciation of him was half as wide.  To a     certain section of the public he seemed a successful writer of boys'     books, which yet held captive older people.  Now, undoubtedly there     was an element (not the highest) in his work which fascinated boys.  It     gratified their yearning for adventure.  To too large a number of his     readers, we suspect, this remains Stevenson's chief charm; though even     of those there were many able to recognise and be thankful for the     literary power and grace which could serve up their sanguinary diet so     daintily.       \"Most of Stevenson's titles, too, like _Treasure Island_, _Kidnapped_,     and_ The Master of Ballantrae_, tended to foster delusion in this     direction.  The books were largely bought for gifts by maiden aunts,     and bestowed as school prizes, when it might not have been so had     their titles given more indication of their real scope and tendency.       \"All this, it seems to us, has somewhat obscured Stevenson's true     power, which is surely that of an arch-delineator of 'human nature'     and of the devious ways of men.  As we read him we feel that we have     our finger on the pulse of the cruel politics of the world.  He has     the Shakespearean gift which makes us recognise that his pirates and     his statesmen, with their violence and their murders and their     perversions of justice, are swayed by the same interests and are     pulling the same strings and playing on the same passions which are at     work in quieter methods around ourselves.  The vast crimes and the     reckless bloodshed are nothing more nor less than stage effects used     to accentuate for the common eye what the seer can detect without     them.       \"And reading him from this standpoint, Stevenson's 'message' (so far     as it was delivered) appears to be that of utter gloom--the creed that     good is always overcome by evil.  We do not mean in the sense that     good always suffers through evil and is frequently crucified by evil.

In imitation of them he halted for  a while, and after having deeply considered it, he gave Rocinante his  head, submitting his own will to that of his hack, who followed out his  first intention, which was to make straight for his own stable. After he  had gone about two miles Don Quixote perceived a large party of people,  who, as afterwards appeared, were some Toledo traders, on their way to  buy silk at Murcia. There were six of them coming along under their  sunshades, with four servants mounted, and three muleteers on foot.  Scarcely had Don Quixote descried them when the fancy possessed him that  this must be some new adventure; and to help him to imitate as far as he  could those passages he had read of in his books, here seemed to come one  made on purpose, which he resolved to attempt. So with a lofty bearing  and determination he fixed himself firmly in his stirrups, got his lance  ready, brought his buckler before his breast, and planting himself in the  middle of the road, stood waiting the approach of these knights-errant,  for such he now considered and held them to be; and when they had come  near enough to see and hear, he exclaimed with a haughty gesture, \"All  the world stand, unless all the world confess that in all the world there  is no maiden fairer than the Empress of La Mancha, the peerless Dulcinea  del Toboso.\"    The traders halted at the sound of this language and the sight of the  strange figure that uttered it, and from both figure and language at once  guessed the craze of their owner; they wished, however, to learn quietly  what was the object of this confession that was demanded of them, and one  of them, who was rather fond of a joke and was very sharp-witted, said to  him, \"Sir Knight, we do not know who this good lady is that you speak of;  show her to us, for, if she be of such beauty as you suggest, with all  our hearts and without any pressure we will confess the truth that is on  your part required of us.\"    \"If I were to show her to you,\" replied Don Quixote, \"what merit would  you have in confessing a truth so manifest? The essential point is that  without seeing her you must believe, confess, affirm, swear, and defend  it; else ye have to do with me in battle, ill-conditioned, arrogant  rabble that ye are; and come ye on, one by one as the order of knighthood  requires, or all together as is the custom and vile usage of your breed,  here do I bide and await you relying on the justice of the cause I  maintain.\"    \"Sir Knight,\" replied the trader, \"I entreat your worship in the name of  this present company of princes, that, to save us from charging our  consciences with the confession of a thing we have never seen or heard  of, and one moreover so much to the prejudice of the Empresses and Queens  of the Alcarria and Estremadura, your worship will be pleased to show us  some portrait of this lady, though it be no bigger than a grain of wheat;  for by the thread one gets at the ball, and in this way we shall be  satisfied and easy, and you will be content and pleased; nay, I believe  we are already so far agreed with you that even though her portrait  should show her blind of one eye, and distilling vermilion and sulphur  from the other, we would nevertheless, to gratify your worship, say all  in her favour that you desire.\"    \"She distils nothing of the kind, vile rabble,\" said Don Quixote, burning  with rage, \"nothing of the kind, I say, only ambergris and civet in  cotton; nor is she one-eyed or humpbacked, but straighter than a  Guadarrama spindle: but ye must pay for the blasphemy ye have uttered  against beauty like that of my lady.\"    And so saying, he charged with levelled lance against the one who had  spoken, with such fury and fierceness that, if luck had not contrived  that Rocinante should stumble midway and come down, it would have gone  hard with the rash trader. Down went Rocinante, and over went his master,  rolling along the ground for some distance; and when he tried to rise he  was unable, so encumbered was he with lance, buckler, spurs, helmet, and  the weight of his old armour; and all the while he was struggling to get  up he kept saying, \"Fly not, cowards and caitiffs! stay, for not by my  fault, but my horse's, am I stretched here.\"          One of the muleteers in attendance, who could not have had much good  nature in him, hearing the poor prostrate man blustering in this style,  was unable to refrain from giving him an answer on his ribs; and coming  up to him he seized his lance, and having broken it in pieces, with one  of them he began so to belabour our Don Quixote that, notwithstanding and  in spite of his armour, he milled him like a measure of wheat. His  masters called out not to lay on so hard and to leave him alone, but the  muleteers blood was up, and he did not care to drop the game until he had  vented the rest of his wrath, and gathering up the remaining fragments of  the lance he finished with a discharge upon the unhappy victim, who all  through the storm of sticks that rained on him never ceased threatening  heaven, and earth, and the brigands, for such they seemed to him. At last  the muleteer was tired, and the traders continued their journey, taking  with them matter for talk about the poor fellow who had been cudgelled.  He when he found himself alone made another effort to rise; but if he was  unable when whole and sound, how was he to rise after having been  thrashed and well-nigh knocked to pieces? And yet he esteemed himself  fortunate, as it seemed to him that this was a regular knight-errant's  mishap, and entirely, he considered, the fault of his horse. However,  battered in body as he was, to rise was beyond his power.          CHAPTER V.    IN WHICH THE NARRATIVE OF OUR KNIGHT'S MISHAP IS CONTINUED      Finding, then, that, in fact he could not move, he thought himself of  having recourse to his usual remedy, which was to think of some passage  in his books, and his craze brought to his mind that about Baldwin and  the Marquis of Mantua, when Carloto left him wounded on the mountain  side, a story known by heart by the children, not forgotten by the young  men, and lauded and even believed by the old folk; and for all that not a  whit truer than the miracles of Mahomet. This seemed to him to fit  exactly the case in which he found himself, so, making a show of severe  suffering, he began to roll on the ground and with feeble breath repeat  the very words which the wounded knight of the wood is said to have  uttered:    Where art thou, lady mine, that thou    My sorrow dost not rue?  Thou canst not know it, lady mine,    Or else thou art untrue.    And so he went on with the ballad as far as the lines:    O noble Marquis of Mantua,    My Uncle and liege lord!    As chance would have it, when he had got to this line there happened to  come by a peasant from his own village, a neighbour of his, who had been  with a load of wheat to the mill, and he, seeing the man stretched there,  came up to him and asked him who he was and what was the matter with him  that he complained so dolefully.    Don Quixote was firmly persuaded that this was the Marquis of Mantua, his  uncle, so the only answer he made was to go on with his ballad, in which  he told the tale of his misfortune, and of the loves of the Emperor's son  and his wife all exactly as the ballad sings it.    The peasant stood amazed at hearing such nonsense, and relieving him of  the visor, already battered to pieces by blows, he wiped his face, which  was covered with dust, and as soon as he had done so he recognised him  and said, \"Senor Quixada\" (for so he appears to have been called when he  was in his senses and had not yet changed from a quiet country gentleman  into a knight-errant), \"who has brought your worship to this pass?\" But  to all questions the other only went on with his ballad.    Seeing this, the good man removed as well as he could his breastplate and  backpiece to see if he had any wound, but he could perceive no blood nor  any mark whatever. He then contrived to raise him from the ground, and  with no little difficulty hoisted him upon his ass, which seemed to him  to be the easiest mount for him; and collecting the arms, even to the  splinters of the lance, he tied them on Rocinante, and leading him by the  bridle and the ass by the halter he took the road for the village, very  sad to hear what absurd stuff Don Quixote was talking.    Nor was Don Quixote less so, for what with blows and bruises he could not  sit upright on the ass, and from time to time he sent up sighs to heaven,  so that once more he drove the peasant to ask what ailed him. And it  could have been only the devil himself that put into his head tales to  match his own adventures, for now, forgetting Baldwin, he bethought  himself of the Moor Abindarraez, when the Alcaide of Antequera, Rodrigo  de Narvaez, took him prisoner and carried him away to his castle;"]]]
