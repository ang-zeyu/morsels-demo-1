[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6840"],[0,"Queen Lucia (#18)"],[1,"have changed after  lunch, which was an unheard of thing to do for a mere stroll on the  green. Georgie knew well that this was no mere stroll; she was on her  way to pay a call of the most formal and magnificent kind. She did not  deviate a hair-breadth from her straight course to the door of the  Arms, she just waggled her hand to Mrs Antrobus, blew a kiss to her  sprightly daughters, made a gracious bow to Colonel Boucher, who stood  up and took his hat off, and went on with the inexorability of the  march of destiny, or of fate knocking at the door in the immortal fifth  symphony. And in her hand she carried a note. Through his glasses  Georgie could see it quite plainly, and it was not a little folded-up  sheet, such as she commonly used, but a square thick envelope. She  disappeared in the Arms and Georgie began thinking feverishly. A great  deal depended on how long she stopped there.    A few little happenings beguiled the period of waiting. Mrs Weston  desisted from her wild career, and came to anchor on the path just  opposite the door into the Arms, while the gardener's boy sank  exhausted on to the grass. It was quite easy to guess that she proposed  to have a chat with Lucia when she came out. Similarly the Miss  Antrobuses who had paid no attention to her at all before, ceased from  their pretty gambolings, and ran up to talk to her, so they wanted a  word too. Colonel Boucher, a little less obviously, began throwing  sticks into the ducking-pond for his bull-dog (for Lucia would be  obliged to pass the ducking-pond) and Mrs Antrobus examined the stocks  very carefully, as if she had never seen them before.    And then, before a couple of minutes had elapsed Lucia came out. She  had no longer the note in her hand, and Georgie began taking his  opera-glasses to bits, in order to wash the lenses. For the present  they had served their purpose. \"She has left a note on Olga Bracely,\"  said Georgie quite aloud, so powerful was the current of his thoughts.  Then as a corollary came the further proposition which might be  considered as proved, \"But she had not seen her.\"    The justice of this conclusion was soon proved, for Lucia had hardly  disengaged herself from the group of her subjects, and traversed the  green on her way back to her house, when a motor passed Georgie's  bathroom window, closely followed by a second; both drew up at the  entrance to the Ambermere Arms. With the speed of a practised optician  Georgie put his opera glass together again, and after looking through  the wrong end of it in his agitation was in time to see a man get out  of the second car, and hold the carriage-door open for the occupants of  the first. A lady got out first, tall and slight in figure, who stood  there unwinding her motor veil, then she turned round again, and with a  thump of his heart that surprised Georgie with its violence, he beheld  the well-remembered features of his Brunnhilde.    Swiftly he passed into his bedroom next door, and arrayed himself in  his summer Hightums; a fresh (almost pearly) suit of white duck, a  mauve tie with an amethyst pin in it, socks, tightly braced up, of  precisely the same colour as the tie, so that an imaginative beholder  might have conjectured that on this warm day the end of his tie had  melted and run down his legs; buckskin shoes with tall slim heels and a  straw hat completed this pretty Hightum. He had meant to wear it for  the first time at Lucia's party tomorrow, but now, after her meanness,  she deserved to be punished. All Riseholme should see it before she  did.    The group round Mrs Weston's chair was still engaged in conversation  when Georgie came up, and he casually let slip what a bore it was to  pay calls on such a lovely day, but he had promised to visit Miss Olga  Bracely, who had just arrived. So there was another nasty one for  Lucia, since now all Riseholme would know of her actual arrival before  Lucia did.    \"And who, Mr Georgie,\" asked Mrs Antrobus presenting her trumpet to him  in the manner in which an elephant presents its trunk to receive a  bun, \"who was that with her?\"    \"Oh, her husband, Mr Shuttleworth,\" said Georgie. \"They have just been  married, and are on their honeymoon.\" And if that was not another  staggerer for Lucia, it is diffy, as Georgie would say, to know what a  staggerer is. For Lucia would be last of all to know that this was not  Mr Bracely.    \"And will they be at Mrs Lucas's party tomorrow?\" asked Mrs Weston.    \"Oh, does she know them?\" asked Georgie.    \"Haw, haw, by Jove!\" began Colonel Boucher. \"Very handsome woman. Envy  you, my boy. Pity it's their honeymoon. Haw!\"    Mrs Antrobus's trumpet was turned in his direction at this moment, and  she heard these daring remarks.    \"Naughty!\" she said, and Georgie, the envied, passed in into the inn.    He sent in his card, on which he had thought it prudent to write \"From  Lady Ambermere,\" and was presently led through into the garden behind  the building. There she was, tall and lovely and welcoming, and held  out a most cordial hand.    \"How kind of you to come and see us,\" she said. \"Georgie, this is Mr  Pillson. My husband.\"    \"How do you do, Mr Shuttleworth,\" said Georgie to shew he knew, though  his own Christian name had given him quite a start. For the moment he  had almost thought she was speaking to him.    \"And so Lady Ambermere asked you to come and see us?\" Olga went on. \"I  think that was much kinder of her than to ask us to dinner. I hate  going out to dinner in the country almost as much as I hate not going  out to dinner in town. Besides with that great hook nose of hers, I'm  always afraid that in an absent moment I might scratch her on the head  and say 'Pretty Polly.' Is she a great friend of yours, Mr Pillson? I  hope so, because everyone likes his best friends being laughed at.\"    Up till that moment Georgie was prepared to indicate that Lady  Ambermere was the hand and he the glove. But evidently that would not  impress Olga in the least. He laughed in a most irreverent manner  instead.    \"Don't let us go,\" she went on. \"Georgie, can't you send a telegram  saying that we have just discovered a subsequent engagement and then  we'll ask Mr Pillson to show us round this utterly adorable place, and  dine with us afterwards. That would be so much nicer. Fancy living  here! Oh, and do tell me something, Mr Pillson. I found a note when I  arrived half an hour ago, from Mrs Lucas asking me and Mr Shuttleworth  to go to a garden-party tomorrow. She said she didn't even hope that I  should remember her, but would we come. Who is she? Really I don't  think she can remember me very well, if she thinks I am Mrs Bracely.  Georgie says I must have been married before, and that I have caused  him to commit bigamy. That's pleasant conversation for a honeymoon,  isn't it? Who is she?\"    \"Oh, she's quite an old friend of mine,\" said Georgie, \"though I never  knew she had met you before; I'm devoted to her.\"    \"Extremely proper. But now tell me this, and look straight in my face,  so that I shall know if you're speaking the truth. Should I enjoy  myself more wandering about this heavenly place than at her garden  party?\"    Georgie felt that poor Lucia was really punished enough by this time.    \"You will give her a great deal of pleasure if you go,\" he began.    \"Ah, that's not fair; it is hitting below the belt to appeal to  unselfish motives. I have come here simply to enjoy myself. Go on; eyes  front.\"    The candour and friendliness of that beautiful face gave Georgie an  impulse of courage. Besides, though no doubt in fun, she had already  suggested that it would be much nicer to wander about with him and dine  together than spend the evening among the splendours of The Hall.    \"I've got a suggestion,\" he said. \"Will you come and lunch with me  first, and we'll stroll about, and then we can go to the garden-party,  and if you don't like it I'll take you away again?\"    \"Done!\" she said. \"Now don't you try to get out of it, because my  husband is a witness. Georgie, give me a cigarette.\"    In a moment Riseholme-Georgie had his cigarette-case open.    \"Do take one of mine,\" he said, \"I'm Georgie too.\"    \"You don't say so! Let's send it to the Psychical Research, or whoever  those people are who collect coincidences and say it's spooks. And a  match please, one of you Georgies. Oh, how I should like never to see  the inside of an Opera House again. Why mayn't I grow on the walls of a  garden like this, or better still, why shouldn't I have a house and  garden of my own here, and sing on the village-green, and ask for  halfpennies? Tell me what happens here! I've always lived in town since  the time a hook-nosed Hebrew, rather like Lady Ambermere, took me out  of the gutter.\"    \"My dear!\" said Mr Shuttleworth.    \"Well, out of an orphan-school at Brixton and I would much prefer the  gutter. That's all about my early life just now, because I am keeping  it for my memoirs which I shall write when my voice becomes a little  more like a steam-whistle. But don't tell Lady Ambermere, for she would  have a fit, but say you happen to know that I belong to the Surrey  Bracelys. So I do; Brixton is on the Surrey side. Oh, my dear, look at  the sun. It's behaving like the best sort of Claude! Heile Sonne!\"    \"I heard you do that last May,\" said Georgie.    \"Then you heard a most second-rate performance,\" said she. \"But really  being unlaced by that Thing, that great fat profligate beery Prussian  was almost too much for me. And the duet! But it was very polite of you  to come, and I will do better next time. Siegfried! Brunnhilde!  Siegfried! Miaou! Miaou! Bring on the next lot of cats! Darling  Georgie, wasn't it awful? And you had proposed to me only the day  before.\"    \"I was absolutely enchanted,\" said Riseholme-Georgie.    \"Yes, but then you didn't have that Thing breathing beer into your  innocent face.\" Georgie rose; the first call on a stranger"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6841"],[0,"Mosaics of Grecian History (#18)"],[1," most beautiful woman of the age, and the daughter of  Tyn'darus, King of Sparta, was sought in marriage by all the  Princes of Greece. Tyndarus, perplexed with the difficulty of  choosing one of the suitors without displeasing all the rest,  being advised by the sage Ulysses, bound all of them by an oath  that they would approve of the uninfluenced choice of Helen, and  would unite to restore her to her husband, and to avenge the  outrage, if ever she was carried off. Menela'us became the choice  of Helen, and soon after, on the death of Tyndarus, succeeded to  the vacant throne of Sparta.    Three years subsequently, Paris, son of Priam, King of Ilium,  or Troy, visited the court of Menelaus, where he was hospitably  received; but during the temporary absence of the latter he  corrupted the fidelity of Helen, and induced her to flee with  him to Troy. When Menelaus returned he assembled the Grecian  princes, and prepared to avenge the outrage. Combining their  forces under the command of Agamem'non, King of Myce'nae, a brother  of Menelaus, they sailed with a great army for Troy. The  imagination of the poet EURIPIDES describes this armament as  follows:                          With eager haste    The sea-girt Aulis strand I paced,    Till to my view appeared the embattled train    Of Hellas, armed for mighty enterprise,    And galleys of majestic size,    To bear the heroes o'er the main;      A thousand ships for Ilion steer,      And round the two Atridae's spear    The warriors swear fair Helen to regain.    After a siege of ten years Troy was taken by stratagem, and the  fair Helen was recovered. On the fanciful etymology of the word  Helen, from a Greek verb signifying to take or seize, the poet  AECHYLUS indulges in the following reflections descriptive of the  character and the history of this \"spear-wooed maid of Greece:\"          Who gave her a name        So true to her fame?    Does a Providence rule in the fate of a word?    Sways there in heaven a viewless power    O'er the chance of the tongue in the naming hour?        Who gave her a name,    This daughter of strife, this daughter of shame,      The spear-wooed maid of Greece!      Helen the taker! 'tis plain to see,      A taker of ships, a taker of men,        A taker of cities is she!    From the soft-curtained chamber of Hymen she fled,        By the breath of giant Zephyr sped,    And shield-bearing throngs in marshalled array    Hounded her flight o'er the printless way,        Where the swift-flashing oar        The fair booty bore        To swirling Sim'o-is' leafy shore,    And stirred the crimson fray.      --Trans. by BLACKIE.    According to Homer, the principal Greek heroes engaged in the  siege of Troy, aside from Agamemnon, were Menelaus, Achilles,  Ulysses, Ajax (the son of Tel'amon), Di'omed, Patro'clus, and  Palame'des; while among the bravest of the defenders of Troy  were Hector, Sarpe'don, and AEne'as.    The poet's story opens, in the tenth year of the siege, with an  account of a contentious scene between two of the Grecian chiefs  --Achilles and Agamemnon--which resulted in the withdrawal of  Achilles and his forces from the Grecian army. The aid of the  gods was invoked in behalf of Achilles, and Jupiter sent a  deceitful vision to Agamemnon, seeking to persuade him to lead  his forces to battle, in order that the Greeks might realize  their need of Achilles. Agamemnon first desired to ascertain the  feeling or disposition of the army regarding the expedition it  had undertaken, and so proposed a return to Greece, which was  unanimously and unexpectedly agreed to, and an advance was made  toward the ships. But through the efforts of the valiant and  sagacious Ulysses all discontent on the part of the troops was  suppressed, and they returned to the plains of Troy.    Among those in the Grecian camp who had complained of their  leaders, and of the folly of the expedition itself, was a brawling,  turbulent, and tumultuous character named Thersi'tes, whose  insolence Ulysses sternly and effectively rebuked. The following  sketch of Thersites reads like a picture drawn from modern  life; while the merited reproof administered by Ulysses is in  the happiest vein of just and patriotic indignation:      Ulysses and Thersites.      Thersites only clamored in the throng,    Loquacious, loud, and turbulent of tongue;    Awed by no shame, by no respect controlled,    In scandal busy, in reproaches bold;    With witty malice, studious to defame;    Scorn all his joy, and censure all his aim;    But chief he gloried, with licentious style,    To lash the great, and monarchs to revile.      His figure such as might his soul proclaim:    One eye was blinking, and one leg was lame;    His mountain shoulders half his breast o'erspread,    Thin hairs bestrew'd his long misshapen head;    Spleen to mankind his envious heart possessed,    And much he hated all--but most, the best.    Ulysses or Achilles still his theme;    But royal scandal his delight supreme.    Long had he lived the scorn of every Greek,    Vext when he spoke, yet still they heard him speak:    Sharp was his voice; which, in the shrillest tone,    Thus with injurious taunts attacked the throne.    Ulysses, in his tent, listens awhile to the complaints, and censures,  and scandals against the chiefs, with which Thersites addresses  the throng gathered around him, and at length--      With indignation sparkling in his eyes,    He views the wretch, and sternly thus replies:      \"Peace, factious monster, born to vex the state    With wrangling talents formed for foul debate,    Curb that impetuous tongue, nor, rashly vain,    And singly mad, asperse the sovereign reign.      \"Have we not known thee, slave! of all our host    The man who acts the least, upbraids the most?    Think not the Greeks to shameful flight to bring;    Nor let those lips profane the name of King.    For our return we trust the heavenly powers;    Be that their care; to fight like men be ours.      \"But grant the host, with wealth our chieftain load;    Except detraction, what hast thou bestowed?    Suppose some hero should his spoil resign,    Art thou that hero? Could those spoils be thine?    Gods! let me perish on this hateful shore,    And let these eyes behold my son no more,    If on thy next offence this hand forbear    To strip those arms thou ill deserv'st to wear,    Expel the council where our princes meet,    And send thee scourged and howling through the fleet.\"      --B. II. POPE'S Trans.      COMBAT OF MENELAUS AND PARIS.    The opposing armies being ready to engage, a single combat is  agreed upon between Menelaus, and Paris son of Priam, for the  determination of the war. Paris is soon vanquished, but is rescued  from death by Venus; and, according to the terms on which the  combat took place, Agamemnon demands the restoration of Helen.  But the gods declare that the war shall go on. So the conflict  begins, and Diomed, assisted by the goddess Pallas (or Minerva),  performs wonders in this day's battle, wounding and putting to  flight Pan'darus, AEneas, and the goddess Venus, even wounding  the war-god Mars, who had challenged him to combat, and sending  him groaning back to heaven.    Hector, the eldest son of Priam King of Troy, and the chief hero  of the Trojans, leaves the field for a brief space, to request  prayers to Minerva for assistance, and especially for the removal  of Diomed from the fight. This done, he seeks a momentary interview  with his wife, the fair and virtuous Androm'a-che, whose touching  appeal to him, and his reply, are both, perhaps, without a parallel  in tender, natural solicitude.      Parting of Hector and Andromache.      \"Too daring prince! ah, whither dost thou run?    Ah, too forgetful of thy wife and son!    And think'st thou not how wretched we shall be,    A widow I, a helpless orphan he?    For sure such courage length of life denies,    And thou must fall, thy virtue's sacrifice.    Greece in her single heroes strove in vain;    Now hosts oppose thee, and thou must be slain!    Oh grant me, gods! ere Hector meets his doom,    All I can ask of heaven, an early tomb!    So shall my days in one sad tenor run,    And end with sorrows as they first begun.      \"No parent now remains my griefs to share,    No father's aid, no mother's tender care.    The fierce Achilles wrapp'd our walls in fire,    Laid The'be waste, and slew my warlike sire!    By the same arm my seven brave brothers fell;    In one sad day beheld the gates of hell.    My mother lived to bear the victor's bands,    The queen of Hippopla'cia's sylvan lands.      \"Yet, while my Hector still survives, I see    My father, mother, brethren, all in thee:    Alas! my parents, brothers, kindred, all    Once more will perish, if my Hector fall.    Thy wife, thy infant, in thy danger share:    Oh, prove a husband's and a father's care!    That quarter most the skilful Greeks annoy,    Where yon wild fig-trees join the walls of Troy;    Thou from this tower defend the important post;    There Agamemnon points his dreadful host,    That pass Tydi'des, Ajax, strive to gain,    And there the vengeful Spartan fires his train.    Thrice our bold foes the fierce attack have given,    Or led by hopes, or dictated from heaven.    Let others in the field their arms employ,    But stay my Hector here, and guard his Troy.\"      The chief replied: \"That post shall be my care,    Nor that alone, but all the works of war.    How would the sons of Troy, in arms renown'd,    And Troy's proud dames, whose garments sweep the ground,    Attaint the lustre of my former name,    Should Hector basely quit the field of fame!    My early youth was bred to martial pains,    My soul impels me to the embattled plains:    Let me be foremost to defend the throne,    And guard my father's glories and my own.      \"Yet come it will, the day decreed by fates;    (How my heart trembles while my tongue relates!)
