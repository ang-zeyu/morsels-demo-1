Peasant and other Irish seers do not  usually speak of the _Sidhe_ as being little, but as being tall: an old  schoolmaster in the West of Ireland described them to me from his own  visions as tall beautiful people, and he used some Gaelic words, which I  took as meaning that they were shining with every colour.'    _The worlds of the 'Sidhe.'_--    Q.--Do the two orders of _Sidhe_ beings inhabit the same world?    A.--'The shining beings belong to the mid-world; while the opalescent  beings belong to the heaven-world. There are three great worlds which we  can see while we are still in the body: the earth-world, mid-world, and  heaven-world.'    _Nature of the 'Sidhe.'_--    Q.--Do you consider the life and state of these _Sidhe_ beings superior  to the life and state of men?    A.--'I could never decide. One can say that they themselves are  certainly more beautiful than men are, and that their worlds seem more  beautiful than our world.    'Among the shining orders there does not seem to be any individualized  life: thus if one of them raises his hands all raise their hands, and if  one drinks from a fire-fountain all do; they seem to move and to have  their real existence in a being higher than themselves, to which they  are a kind of body. Theirs is, I think, a collective life, so  unindividualized and so calm that I might have more varied thoughts in  five hours than they would have in five years; and yet one feels an  extraordinary purity and exaltation about their life. Beauty of form  with them has never been broken up by the passions which arise in the  developed egotism of human beings. A hive of bees has been described as  a single organism with disconnected cells; and some of these tribes of  shining beings seem to be little more than one being manifesting itself  in many beautiful forms. I speak this with reference to the shining  beings only: I think that among the opalescent or _Sidhe_ beings, in the  heaven-world, there is an even closer spiritual unity, but also a  greater individuality.'    _Influence of the 'Sidhe' on Men._--    Q.--Do you consider any of these _Sidhe_ beings inimical to humanity?    A.--'Certain kinds of the shining beings, whom I call wood beings, have  never affected me with any evil influences I could recognize. But the  water beings, also of the shining tribes, I always dread, because I felt  whenever I came into contact with them a great drowsiness of mind and, I  often thought, an actual drawing away of vitality.'    _Water Beings Described._--    Q.--Can you describe one of these water beings?    A.--'In the world under the waters--under a lake in the West of Ireland  in this case--I saw a blue and orange coloured king seated on a throne;  and there seemed to be some fountain of mystical fire rising from under  his throne, and he breathed this fire into himself as though it were his  life. As I looked, I saw groups of pale beings, almost grey in colour,  coming down one side of the throne by the fire-fountain. They placed  their head and lips near the heart of the elemental king, and, then, as  they touched him, they shot upwards, plumed and radiant, and passed on  the other side, as though they had received a new life from this chief  of their world.'    _Wood Beings Described._--    Q.--Can you describe one of the wood beings?    A.--'The wood beings I have seen most often are of a shining silvery  colour with a tinge of blue or pale violet, and with dark  purple-coloured hair.'    _Reproduction and Immortality of the 'Sidhe'._--    Q.--Do you consider the races of the _Sidhe_ able to reproduce their  kind; and are they immortal?    A.--'The higher kinds seem capable of breathing forth beings out of  themselves, but I do not understand how they do so. I have seen some of  them who contain elemental beings within themselves, and these they  could send out and receive back within themselves again.    'The immortality ascribed to them by the ancient Irish is only a  relative immortality, their space of life being much greater than ours.  In time, however, I believe that they grow old and then pass into new  bodies just as men do, but whether by birth or by the growth of a new  body I cannot say, since I have no certain knowledge about this.'    _Sex among the 'Sidhe'._--    Q.--Does sexual differentiation seem to prevail among the Sidhe races?    A.--'I have seen forms both male and female, and forms which did not  suggest sex at all.'    _'Sidhe' and Human Life._--    Q.--(1) Is it possible, as the ancient Irish thought, that certain of  the higher _Sidhe_ beings have entered or could enter our plane of life  by submitting to human birth? (2) On the other hand, do you consider it  possible for men in trance or at death to enter the _Sidhe_ world?    A.--(1) 'I cannot say.' (2) 'Yes; both in trance and after death. I  think any one who thought much of the _Sidhe_ during his life and who  saw them frequently and brooded on them would likely go to their world  after death.'    _Social Organization of the 'Sidhe'._--    Q.--You refer to chieftain-like or prince-like beings, and to a king  among water beings; is there therefore definite social organization  among the various _Sidhe_ orders and races, and if so, what is its  nature?    A.--'I cannot say about a definite social organization. I have seen  beings who seemed to command others, and who were held in reverence.  This implies an organization, but whether it is instinctive like that of  a hive of bees, or consciously organized like human society, I cannot  say.'    _Lower 'Sidhe' as Nature Elementals._--    Q.--You speak of the water-being king as an elemental king; do you  suggest thereby a resemblance between lower _Sidhe_ orders and what  mediaeval mystics called elementals?    A.--'The lower orders of the _Sidhe_ are, I think, the nature elementals  of the mediaeval mystics.'    _Nourishment of the Higher 'Sidhe'._--    Q.--The water beings as you have described them seem to be nourished and  kept alive by something akin to electrical fluids; do the higher orders  of the _Sidhe_ seem to be similarly nourished?    A.--'They seemed to me to draw their life out of the Soul of the World.'    _Collective Visions of 'Sidhe' Beings._--    Q.--Have you had visions of the various _Sidhe_ beings in company with  other persons?    A.--'I have had such visions on several occasions.'    And this statement has been confirmed to me by three participants in  such collective visions, who separately at different times have seen in  company with our witness the same vision at the same moment. On another  occasion, on the Greenlands at Rosses Point, County Sligo, the same  _Sidhe_ being was seen by our present witness and a friend with him,  also possessing the faculty of seership, at a time when the two  percipients were some little distance apart, and they hurried to each  other to describe the being, not knowing that the explanation was  mutually unnecessary. I have talked with both percipients so much, and  know them so intimately that I am fully able to state that as  percipients they fulfil all necessary pathological conditions required  by psychologists in order to make their evidence acceptable.      PARALLEL EVIDENCE AS TO THE _SIDHE_ RACES    In general, the rare evidence above recorded from the Irish seer could  be paralleled by similar evidence from at least two other reliable Irish  people, with whom also I have been privileged to discuss the  Fairy-Faith. One is a member of the Royal Irish Academy, the other is  the wife of a well-known Irish historian; and both of them testify to  having likewise had collective visions of _Sidhe_ beings in Ireland.    This is what Mr. William B. Yeats wrote to me, while this study was in  progress, concerning the Celtic Fairy Kingdom:--'I am certain that it  exists, and will some day be studied as it was studied by Kirk.'[21]      INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE FROM THE _SIDHE_ WORLD    One of the most remarkable discoveries of our Celtic researches has been  that the native population of the Rosses Point country, or, as we have  called it, the _Sidhe_ world, in most essentials, and, what is most  important, by independent folk-testimony, substantiate the opinions and  statements of the educated Irish mystics to whom we have just referred,  as follows:--    _John Conway's Vision of the 'Gentry'._--In Upper Rosses Point, Mrs. J.  Conway told me this about the 'gentry':--'John Conway, my husband, who  was a pilot by profession, in watching for in-coming ships used to go  up on the high hill among the Fairy Hills; and there he often saw the  _gentry_ going down the hill to the strand. One night in particular he  recognized them as men and women of the _gentry_; and they were as big  as any living people. It was late at night about forty years ago.'    _Ghosts and Fairies._--When first I introduced myself to Owen Conway, in  his bachelor quarters, a cosy cottage at Upper Rosses Point, he said  that Mr. W. B. Yeats and other men famous in Irish literature had  visited him to hear about the fairies, and that though he knew very  little about the fairies he nevertheless always likes to talk of them.  Then Owen began to tell me about a man's ghost which both he and Bran  Reggan had seen at different times on the road to Sligo, then about a  woman's ghost which he and other people had often seen near where we  were, and then about the exorcizing of a haunted house in Sligo some  sixty years ago by Father McGowan, who as a result died soon afterwards,  apparently having been killed by the exorcized spirits. Finally, I heard  from him the following anecdotes about the fairies:--    _A Stone Wall overthrown by 'Fairy' Agency._--'Nothing is more certain  than that there are fairies. The old folks always thought them the  fallen angels. At the back of this house the fairies had their pass. My  neighbour started to build a cow-shed, and one wall abutting on the pass  was"]]]
