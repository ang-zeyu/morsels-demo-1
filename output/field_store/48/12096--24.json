November 30,  1919, he published in the most widely circulated and influential  newspaper of Central Italy, the _Resto del Carlino_, an article entitled  \"Amore e Morte\" (\"Love and Death\"), which sets forth that he has had  that experience which the Christian calls \"seeing a great light, knowing  a spiritual reincarnation,\" and which those whom Papini has been  supposed to represent call a pitiable defalcation, a spiritual  bankruptcy.    On February 21, 1913, he proclaimed in the Costanzi Theatre of Rome that  \"in order to reach his power man must throw off religious faith, not  only Christianity or Catholicism, but all mystic, spiritualistic,  theosophic faiths and beliefs.\" Now he has discovered Jesus. In his  literary ruminations he has come upon the gospels of Matthew, Mark,  Luke, and John, which set forth the purpose and teachings of our Lord  and which have convinced countless living and dead of His divinity. We  must forswear egocentrism; we must stop making obeisance to materialism;  we must cease striving for success, comfort, or power. Such efforts led  to the massacre of yesterday, to the agony of to-day, and are  conditioning our eternal perdition. Salvation is within ourselves, the  Kingdom of Heaven is within our hearts, he who seeks it without is a  blind man led by a blind guide. The road over which we must travel is  bordered on either side by seductive pastures from which gush  life-giving springs, topped with luxurious trees of soul-satisfying  color that protect from the blazing sun or the congealing wind, and on  either side are pathways so softly cushioned that even the most tender  feet may tread them without fear of wound or blister. The sign-posts to  this road are the four little volumes written two thousand years ago.    No one unfamiliar with that strange disorder of the mind called the  manic depressive psychosis can fully understand Signor Papini. There is  no one more sane and businesslike than the former Futurist, yet the  reactions of his supersensitive nature have some similarity with this  mental condition present, in embryo, in many people. In that mysterious  malady there is a period of emotional, physical, and intellectual  activity that surmounts every obstacle, brushes aside every barrier,  leaps over every hurdle. During its dominancy the victim respects  neither law not convention; the goal is his only object. He doesn't  always know where he is going and he isn't concerned with it; he is  concerned only with going. When the spectator sees the road over which  he has travelled on his winged horse he finds it littered with the  debris that Pegasus has trampled upon and crushed.    This period of hyperactivity is invariably followed by a time of  depression, of inadequacy, of emotional barrenness, of intellectual  sterility, of physical impotency, of spiritual frigidity. The sun from  which the body and the soul have had their warmth and their glow falls  below the horizon of the unfortunate's existence and he senses the  terrors of the dark and the rigidity of beginning congelation. Then,  when hope and warmth have all but gone and only life, mere life without  color or emotion remains, and the necessity of living forever in a world  perpetually enshrouded in darkness with no differentiation in the debris  remaining after the tornado, then the sun gradually peeps up,  illuminates, warms, revives, fructifies the earth, and the sufferer  becomes normal--normal save in the moments or hours of fear when he  contemplates having again to brave the hurricane or to breast the  deluge. But once the wind begins to blow with a velocity that bespeaks  the readvent of the tornado, he throws off inhibition and goes out in  the open, holds up the torch that shall light the whole world, and with  his megaphone from the top of Helicon shouts: \"This way to the  revolution.\"    In a relative sense, this is the mode of Signor Papini. He is fascinated  by the beauty and perfections of an individual or of a school and he  will enroll himself a member, but before he gets thoroughly initiated he  gets word of another individual or another school which must be  investigated. In the intoxication he defames and often slays his  previous mistress. Thus his whole life has been given to the task of  discovering a new philosophy, a new poetry, a new romance, a new  prophecy, and their makers. In the ecstasy of discovery he cannot resist  smashing the idol of yesterday that his pedestal may be free for the  more worthy one of to-day, and he cannot inhibit the impulse to rush off  to the composing-rooms of _La Voce_ to register his emotions in print.    In his desire to be famous he reminds one of those individuals who would  be liked by every one, and who will do anything save cease making the  effort. Pretending that he loves to have people hate him, he does not,  but he would rather have hate and disparagement than indifference or  neglect. He desires power, that unattainable he will be satisfied with  notoriety. He does not agree with a fellow poet that        \"On stepping stones we reach to higher dreams,      And ever high and higher must we climb,      Casting aside our burdens as we go,      Till we have reached the mountain-tops sublime,      Where purged from care and dross the free winds flow.\"    Were he a genius and at the same time had the industry that he has  displayed, he would be the equal of H. G. Wells, possibly the peer of  Bernard Shaw, but he is neither. He is simply a clever, industrious,  versatile, sensitive, emotional man of forty, whose mental juvenility  tends to cling to him. He has so long habituated himself to  overestimation and his admiring friends have been so injudicious in  praising his productions for qualities which they do not possess and  neglecting praiseworthy qualities which they do possess, that he is like  an object under a magnifying-glass out of focus.    But, as Papini himself says, he has not finished. He is still  comparatively a young man and the world awaits his accomplishment. If  the function he has chosen is that of agitation rather than  construction, of preparation rather than of building, he cannot be  totally condemned for that. His environment is in a condition where much  destruction is necessary before anything real can be evolved. And as the  apostle of this destruction Papini must be accepted. He stands as a  prophet, \"the voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Prepare ye the  way--'\"; and the generations will show whether it is indeed a highway he  has opened.          CHAPTER VI    TWO NOISY ITALIAN SCHOOLMASTERS      The most diverting and conspicuous figures in the literary world of  Italy to-day are two old school-teachers, Alfredo Panzini, humanist, and  Luigi Pirandello, satirist. Both of them have earned a permanent fame  and their fecundity seems to be increasing with age.    Alfredo Panzini, a pedagogue by profession, is a writer by dint of long  training. Born in Senigaglia, a small town in the Province of Ancona, in  1863, he called Carducci master. After serving a long literary  apprenticeship compiling grammars, readers, dictionaries, anthologies,  his name began to appear in journals and magazines, and gradually he has  forged his way to the front rank as an episodist, an interpreter of the  feelings and sentiments of the average man and woman and their  spokesman, and as a master of prose.    In appearance he is a typical lower middle-class Italian, short, stout,  and ruddy, a kindly, benevolent face, with contented eyes that look at  you uninquiringly from behind gold-rimmed spectacles. One might gather  from looking at him that he had asked but little from the world and got  more than he asked.    His writings display an intimate familiarity with a few classic writers,  especially of Greece and Italy, which he reveals by frequent and  appropriate quotations and references, contrasting the sayings and  doings of the venerated ancients with those of the not always deprecated  modern. He knows the emotional desires and reactions of the average man;  he senses his aspirations and his appeasements; he has keen  understanding of his virtues and his infirmities. He knows his potential  and actual pleasures, and he reveals this understanding of his fellows  to us in a diverting and instructive way and at the same time shows us  idealistic vistas of life and conduct that are most refreshing. It is to  be regretted that he is not equally enlightened about women. If he knows  their aspirations he denies the legitimacy of them; if he discerns their  future he refuses to forecast it; if he knows feminine psychology his  writings do not reveal it. He is the traveller ascending from the plains  whose pleasure is in looking backward to survey the paths over which he  has travelled, to describe the beauty of the country and its  associations, and to moralize about them. Elevations in front of him  from which one may legitimately anticipate more comprehensive vistas he  refuses to consider, or, if constrained to do so, denies that what shall  be seen from them will compare with what he sees and has seen.    His two most successful and commendable books are \"La Lanterna di  Diogene\" (\"Diogenes' Lantern\") and \"Xantippe.\" The first is a narrative  of sentimental wandering in which he describes the commonplace world and  the homely conflict of those whom he encounters, and in which he  displays not only tolerance, but love of his fellow men. He is sometimes  playful, more often ironical, but never disparaging or vituperative, and  his prose is clear, limpid--sometimes, indeed, sparkling.    His \"Xantippe\" does not deal particularly with the virtues or  infirmities of that renowned shrew. It recounts many incidents in the  life, trial, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41990"],[0,"The Cid Campeador: A Historical Romance (#18)"],[1,".\"    \"But, captain,\" interrupted one of the band, \"let us first bandage your  wounds, for you will lose much blood if we don't do so.\"    \"No, by Beelzebub! My blood must run till the venom, which the cowardly  conduct of those vile Salvadores has put into it, has all left it.\"    This answer of their bold captain captivated more and more the hearts of  the bandits, to whose eyes tears came--tears which they would not have  shed on hearing the pitiful wailings of poor peasants from whom they had  stolen the small store with which they had hoped to support their  families; of unhappy parents whose daughter was about to be their  victim; of the sad wife whom their swords had condemned to widowhood; of  the weak children whom they had made orphans, without means of  subsistence.    \"Hear me, brothers,\" continued the Vengador; \"from to-day, war to the  strong and help to the weak! If we go near the poor, it must be only for  the purpose of alleviating their misery with what we shall have taken  from the powerful. Have any of you daughters or a wife?\"    \"Yes,\" replied one of the robbers; \"I have a daughter who is worth more  than those of the king, and I love her more than the apple of my eyes.\"    \"I have a wife,\" answered another, \"and, although a peasant, she is of  more value than the most noble dame in Castile. For this I love her as  well as people say the son of the Grandee of Vivar loves the daughter of  De Gormaz.\"    \"Well, then, what would you do if your daughter were torn away from  you?\"    \"Anger of God! If such were done, I would never rest till my dagger was  buried in the heart of him who took her from me, even were he hid in the  bowels of the earth, even if he fled to the ends of the world! Brother  captain, say no more, for God's sake; thinking only of such a thing  makes my blood boil.\"    \"And you,\" he said, turning to the other, \"what would you do if your  wife were taken from you and dishonoured?\"    \"If such happened,\" he exclaimed, placing his hand on his dagger with an  instinctive movement, and his eyes flashing fire, \"my sword would pierce  a hundred hearts and then my own! But for what reason do you ask us such  questions, captain?\"    \"Because I wish to put you on your guard,--you on account of your wife,  and you, of your daughter, if they live in this district; for there is  in it a ruffianly count, who carries off wives from their husbands, and  daughters from their fathers.\"    \"Who, then, is that count?\" asked all the bandits, full of indignation.    \"The Count of Carrion,\" replied Martin, repressing with difficulty the  joy he felt on seeing how successfully he had disposed his companions to  aid him in his projects of vengeance. \"The Count of Carrion,\" he  continued, \"is the most cruel, the most treacherous, and the worst of  men; when you return home to clasp your daughters or your wives to your  hearts, perchance you will find that he has stolen them from you.\"    \"May the earth open and may we sink into hell, if we suffer such a  wretch to live any longer!\" exclaimed the robbers; and Martin continued,  more warmly and solemnly--    \"Yes, yes, comrades, let the Count of Carrion die, if we ourselves do  not desire to die like the Raposo and the greater part of his band. It  is that count who has sacrificed our brothers, for to him is due the  creation of the brotherhood of the Salvadores.\"    \"Let us attack his castle!\" all exclaimed; \"let us bury our swords in  the breast of that traitor count!\"    \"But Don Suero, for such is his name, will be able to say to us, that if  he carries off young girls and married women, we also do the same; that  if he attacks and wounds poor people, and deprives them of their means  of subsistence, we also do the same.\"    \"But from this day forward we shall not do such things. Let us all now  swear that we will plunge our daggers in the breast of any comrade who  dares to commit such crimes.\" Thus spoke the bandit who had a daughter.    Without the slightest hesitation, they all then took a solemn oath, that  in future they would not ill-treat women, or injure and rob the poor and  helpless.    Martin now began to feel weak on account of the quantity of blood he had  lost, and considered that he should not delay any longer the binding of  his wounds.    One of the bandits gathered some herbs that were abundant in that  country, and applied them to the wounds of his captain, having first  washed them in water brought in a helmet from an adjacent spring. They  were bound up with bandages, made from a handkerchief which was torn up  for that purpose.    The much reduced band of the Vengador rested under the trees of the  thick wood, where the horses found abundant pasture; and when the vesper  bells began to ring in the surrounding villages, the bandits mounted  their horses and, according to the orders of their captain, continued  their way towards the Sierra de Oca.          CHAPTER XI    HOW THE DE VIVAR FAMILY RECEIVED LETTERS FROM THE KING, DON FERNANDO      A few days after the events which we have related in preceding chapters,  Diego Lainez and his family, including Rodrigo, were seated at table in  the castle of Vivar. All were in good spirits, all were eating with  excellent appetites, except the last-mentioned, who in vain endeavoured  to take part in the general joyousness; but the smile departed suddenly  from his lips, as if there came to drive it away some sad memories,  which the most trivial phrases of those present seemed to awake in his  soul.    Teresa, who was observing her son, saw his inquietude and sadness, and  from that moment she shared them with him; for the feelings of a son  reflect themselves in a mother, especially when she is as good as the  mother of Rodrigo was.    \"My son,\" she said to the youth, who was then buried in thought, \"why  are you so sad when we all have such reason to be joyous, especially  you, who have washed off the blot that stained our honour? What is the  cause of your sadness?\"    \"Mother,\" replied Rodrigo, \"have you not heard that Casilda, the  solitary of the lake of San Vicente, shares her home with a noble maiden  who also has gone to bury herself in that solitary place?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"That maiden is Ximena Gome.\"    \"Let her then, my son, weep in solitude over the perfidy of her father,  let her consecrate some of her days to God, and to the care of the poor  invalids who resort to the lake to seek their health, for grief finds  its first consolations in God and in those who suffer. If she loves you  still, of which I have no doubt, her grief will pass away, and her love  will remain; for true love is eternal, and grief, no matter how deep, is  transitory.\"    \"Do you believe, my mother, that Ximena can love the slayer of her  father?\"    \"Yes, my son, for in killing her father you gave another proof of your  noble character, and Ximena herself would have abhorred you if she saw  you regard with indifference the stain which her father had cast on the  honour of yours.\"    \"Do you not know that, before she quitted the court, she demanded  vengeance against me from the king, supposing that I had wrongfully  killed her father?\"    \"Yes,\" interposed Diego Lainez, who until then did not wish to interrupt  the conversation between his wife and son; \"and such is the duty of  every daughter. The king, however, is too wise and just to believe such  a thing, and to punish one who not only committed no offence, but rather  added fresh lustre to his honour.\"    \"Notwithstanding, my father, I fear that the king is much displeased  with us, for the question regarding Calahorra is now the foremost one,  and he has not asked your advice, as he always was in the habit of doing  in similar cases.\"    Just as Rodrigo said this, a servant entered, announcing the arrival of  a messenger from the king, from whom he brought letters for Diego Lainez  and Rodrigo.    A perceptible uneasiness came upon the countenance of Diego, as well as  on those of his wife and son. A moment afterwards the old man was  reading a sheet of parchment, upon which was the royal seal, and the  young man was reading a similar one. This is what the first contained:--           \"Much honoured Diego Lainez, the King of Leon and Castile salutes       you, whom he loves the most of all his subjects. Know that we await       you impatiently in our Alcazar, for it is our wish that you should       devote your wisdom and prudence to the education of the princes,       our sons, as we informed you but a short time ago, in the presence       of the cavaliers of our court. Pay attention to your health till it       is quite restored from the injury which the wounds made on your       honour must have caused it, and as those have been healed, receive       the congratulations which, on that account, we offer you.--THE       KING.\"      The second letter, directed to Rodrigo, was conceived in the following  terms:--           \"To you, Rodrigo Diaz, a good son as well as a good knight, the       king sends his greetings; be it known to you that the King of       Aragon disputes with us the possession of Calahorra, alleging       injustice on the part of the king our father, who made it over to       us of his own good will, when God was pleased to call him to       Himself. And as we have agreed to confide the decision of the       dispute to the valour of two cavaliers, one to be named by us, and       the other by the King of Aragon, it is our will that you shall be       he who is to defend our rights, combating with Martin Gonzalez, who       has been appointed to defend those which Don Ramiro claims to       possess. You have given proof of being an honourable and valiant       knight, by slaying De Gormaz to avenge the insult offered to your       father's and to your honour, and we doubt not but that the       enterprise, which we confide to you, shall come to a successful       issue.--THE KING.\"      \"Martin Gonzalez,\" exclaimed"]]]
