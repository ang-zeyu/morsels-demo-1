[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3536"],[0,"The Enchanted Castle (#18)"],[1,"that it was true.    \"Tiens!\" said Mademoiselle, \"you love the old French governess?  Impossible,\" and she spoke rather indistinctly.    \"You're not old,\" said Mabel; \"at least not so very, she added  brightly, and you're as lovely as a Princess.\"    \"Go then, flatteress!\" said Mademoiselle, laughing; and Mabel  went. The others were already half-way up the stairs.    Mademoiselle sat in the drawing-room as usual, and it was a good  thing that she was not engaged in serious study, for it seemed that  the door opened and shut almost ceaselessly all throughout the  afternoon. Might they have the embroidered antimacassars and the  sofa cushions? Might they have the clothes-line out of the  washhouse? Eliza said they mightn't, but might they? Might they  have the sheepskin hearth-rugs? Might they have tea in the garden,  because they had almost got the stage ready in the dining-room,  and Eliza wanted to set tea? Could Mademoiselle lend them any  coloured clothes scarves or dressing-gowns, or anything bright?  Yes, Mademoiselle could, and did silk things, surprisingly lovely  for a governess to have.    Had Mademoiselle any rouge? They had always heard that French  ladies No. Mademoiselle hadn't and to judge by the colour of her  face, Mademoiselle didn't need it. Did Mademoiselle think the  chemist sold rouge or had she any false hair to spare? At this  challenge Mademoiselle's pale fingers pulled out a dozen hairpins,  and down came the loveliest blue-black hair, hanging to her knees  in straight, heavy lines.    \"No, you terrible infants,\" she cried. \"I have not the false hair, nor  the rouge. And my teeth you want them also, without doubt?\"    She showed them in a laugh.    \"I said you were a Princess,\" said Mabel, \"and now I know. You're  Rapunzel. Do always wear your hair like that! May we have the  peacock fans, please, off the mantelpiece, and the things that loop  back the curtains, and all the handkerchiefs you've got?\"    Mademoiselle denied them nothing. They had the fans and the  handkerchiefs and some large sheets of expensive drawing-paper  out of the school cupboard, and Mademoiselle's best sable  paint-brush and her paint-box.    \"Who would have thought,\" murmured Gerald, pensively sucking  the brush and gazing at the paper mask he had just painted, \"that  she was such a brick in disguise? I wonder why crimson lake  always tastes just like Liebig's Extract.\"    Everything was pleasant that day somehow. There are some days  like that, you know, when everything goes well from the very  beginning; all the things you want are in their places, nobody  misunderstands you, and all that you do turns out admirably. How  different from those other days which we all know too well, when  your shoe-lace breaks, your comb is mislaid, your brush spins on  its back on the floor and lands under the bed where you can't get at  it you drop the soap, your buttons come off, an eyelash gets into  your eye, you have used your last clean handkerchief, your collar is  frayed at the edge and cuts your neck, and at the very last moment  your suspender breaks, and there is no string. On such a day as this  you are naturally late for breakfast, and everyone thinks you did it  on purpose. And the day goes on and on, getting worse and worse  you mislay your exercise-book, you drop your arithmetic in the  mud, your pencil breaks, and when you open your knife to sharpen  the pencil you split your nail. On such a day you jam your thumb  in doors, and muddle the messages you are sent on by grown-ups.  You upset your tea, and your bread-and-butter won't hold together  for a moment. And when at last you get to bed usually in disgrace  it is no comfort at all to you to know that not a single bit of it is  your own fault.    This day was not one of those days, as you will have noticed. Even  the tea in the garden there was a bricked bit by a rockery that made  a steady floor for the tea-table was most delightful, though the  thoughts of four out of the five were busy with the coming play,  and the fifth had thoughts of her own that had had nothing to do  with tea or acting.    Then there was an interval of slamming doors, interesting silences,  feet that flew up and down stairs.    It was still good daylight when the dinner-bell rang  the signal had  been agreed upon at tea-time, and carefully explained to Eliza.  Mademoiselle laid down her book and passed out of the  sunset-yellowed hail into the faint yellow gaslight of the  dining-room. The giggling Eliza held the door open before her, and  followed her in. The shutters had been closed streaks of daylight  showed above and below them. The green-and-black tablecloths of  the school dining-tables were supported on the clothes-line from  the backyard. The line sagged in a graceful curve, but it answered  its purpose of supporting the curtains which concealed that part of  the room which was the stage.    Rows of chairs had been placed across the other end of the room  all the chairs in the house, as it seemed and Mademoiselle started  violently when she saw that fully half a dozen of these chairs were  occupied. And by the queerest people, too an old woman with a  poke bonnet tied under her chin with a red handkerchief, a lady in  a large straw hat wreathed in flowers and the oddest hands that  stuck out over the chair in front of her, several men with strange,  clumsy figures, and all with hats on.    \"But,\" whispered Mademoiselle, through the chinks of the  tablecloths, \"you have then invited other friends? You should have  asked me, my children.\"    Laughter and something like a \"hurrah\" answered her from behind  the folds of the curtaining tablecloths.    \"All right, Mademoiselle Rapunzel,\" cried Mabel; \"turn the gas up.  It's only part of the entertainment.\"    Eliza, still giggling, pushed through the lines of chairs, knocking  off the hat of one of the visitors as she did so, and turned up the  three incandescent burners.    Mademoiselle looked at the figure seated nearest to her, stooped to  look more closely, half laughed, quite screamed, and sat down  suddenly.    \"Oh!\" she cried, \"they are not alive!\"    Eliza, with a much louder scream, had found out the same thing  and announced it differently. \"They ain't got no insides,\" said she.  The seven members of the audience seated among the wilderness  of chairs had, indeed, no insides to speak of. Their bodies were  bolsters and rolled-up blankets, their spines were broom-handles,  and their arm and leg bones were hockey sticks and umbrellas.  Their shoulders were the wooden crosspieces that Mademoiselle  used for keeping her jackets in shape; their hands were gloves  stuffed out with handkerchiefs; and their faces were the paper  masks painted in the afternoon by the untutored brush of Gerald,  tied on to the round heads made of the ends of stuffed  bolster-cases. The faces were really rather dreadful. Gerald had  done his best, but even after his best had been done you would  hardly have known they were faces, some of them, if they hadn't  been in the positions which faces usually occupy, between the  collar and the hat. Their eyebrows were furious with lamp-black  frowns their eyes the size, and almost the shape, of five-shilling  pieces, and on their lips and cheeks had been spent much crimson  lake and nearly the whole of a half-pan of vermilion.    \"You have made yourself an auditors, yes? Bravo!\" cried  Mademoiselle, recovering herself and beginning to clap. And to  the sound of that clapping the curtain went up or, rather, apart. A  voice said, in a breathless, choked way, \"Beauty and the Beast,\"  and the stage was revealed.    It was a real stage too the dining-tables pushed close together and  covered with pink-and-white counterpanes. It was a little unsteady  and creaky to walk on, but very imposing to look at. The scene was  simple, but convincing. A big sheet of cardboard, bent square, with  slits cut in it and a candle behind, represented, quite transparently,  the domestic hearth; a round hat-tin of Eliza s, supported on a stool  with a night-light under it, could not have been mistaken, save by  wilful malice, for anything but a copper. A waste-paper basket  with two or three school dusters and an overcoat in it, and a pair of  blue pyjamas over the back of a chair, put the finishing touch to  the scene. It did not need the announcement from the wings, \"The  laundry at Beauty's home.\" It was so plainly a laundry and nothing  else.    In the wings: \"They look just like a real audience, don't they?\"  whispered Mabel. \"Go on, Jimmy don't forget the Merchant has to  be pompous and use long words.\"    Jimmy, enlarged by pillows under Gerald's best overcoat which  had been intentionally bought with a view to his probable growth  during the two years which it was intended to last him, a Turkish  towel turban on his head and an open umbrella over it, opened the  first act in a simple and swift soliloquy:    \"I am the most unlucky merchant that ever was. I was once the  richest merchant in Bagdad, but I lost all my ships, and now I live  in a poor house that is all to bits; you can see how the rain comes  through the roof, and my daughters take in washing. And ,\"    The pause might have seemed long, but Gerald rustled in, elegant  in Mademoiselle's pink dressing-gown and the character of the  eldest daughter.    \"A nice drying day,\" he minced. \"Pa dear, put the umbrella the  other way up. It'll save us going out in the rain to fetch water.  Come on, sisters, dear father's got us a new wash-tub. Here's  luxury!\"    Round the umbrella, now held the wrong way up, the three sisters  knelt and washed imaginary linen. Kathleen wore a violet skirt of  Eliza s, a blue blouse of her own, and a cap of knotted  handkerchiefs. A white nightdress girt with a white apron and two  red carnations in Mabel's black hair left no doubt as to which of  the three was Beauty.    The scene went very well. The final dance with waving towels"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35409"],[0,"Beauty: Illustrated Chiefly (#18)"],[1,",\" says Barry, \"and union of parts,  which we call beautiful in a greyhound, are pleasing in consequence of the  idea of agility which they convey. In other animals, less agility is  united with more strength; and, indeed, all the different arrangements  please because they indicate either different qualities, different degrees  of qualities, or the different combinations of them.\"    In relation to the various fitness of the human body, the same writer  says: \"We should not increase the beauty of the female bosom, by the  addition of another protuberance; and the exquisite undulating transitions  from the convex to the concave tendencies, could not be multiplied with  any success. In fine, our rule for judging of the mode and degree of this  combination of variety and unity, seems to be no other than that of its  fitness and conformity to the designation of each species.\"    But it is less necessary for me to adduce authorities in support of this  truth, than to answer the objections that have been made to it by some of  the ablest writers on the subject--objections which have generally their  origin in the narrow views which these men have taken, and in those  partial hypotheses which, even when true, led them to reject all other  truth.    \"It is said,\" observes Burke, \"that the idea of a part's being well  adapted to answer its end, is one cause of beauty, or indeed beauty  itself.... In framing this theory, I am apprehensive that experience was  not sufficiently consulted. For, on that principle, the wedgelike snout of  a swine with its tough cartilage at the end, the little sunk eyes, and  the whole make of the head, so well adapted to its offices of digging and  rooting, would be extremely beautiful.\"--And so they are, when the beauty  of fitness for their purpose is considered; but that purpose being the  mere growth and fattening of an animal of sensual and dirty habits, it is  a fallacy to represent this, without explanation, as a fair proof of the  absence of connexion between fitness and beauty.    \"If beauty in our species,\" says the same writer, \"was annexed to use, men  would be much more lovely than women; and strength and agility would be  considered as the only beauties.\"--Burke was a stringer of fine words, not  for woman, but for queens, when that served a selfish and venal purpose.  The sentence just quoted shows that his gallantry was as ignorant as it  was mean. He here asserts by implication that women are less useful than  men, although it is to women that the care of the whole human race, during  its most helpless years, is committed, and although they take upon  themselves all that half of the duties of life which men are as little  capable of performing, as women are of performing the portion suited to  men.    \"And,\" says he, \"I appeal to the first and most natural feelings of  mankind, whether, on beholding a beautiful eye, or a well-fashioned mouth,  or a well-turned leg, any ideas of their being well fitted for seeing,  eating, or running, ever present themselves.\"--Is running, then, the  proper use of the leg in woman! Rousseau more truly thought its use was  to _fail_ in running, or _not_ to run! Is eating the only use of her  mouth! This, too from the man who deplored that \"the age of chivalry was  gone!\"--Nevertheless, I will venture to assert that such things never were  and never will be seen, without suggesting ideas of fitness of some kind  or other.    \"There is,\" he proceeds, \"another notion current, pretty closely allied to  the former; that perfection is the constituent cause of beauty. This  opinion has been made to extend much farther than to sensible objects. But  in these, so far is perfection, considered as such, from being the cause  of beauty, that this quality, where it is highest in the female sex,  almost always carries with it an idea of weakness and imperfection.\"--For  this plain reason, that female perfection is utterly incompatible with  great muscular perfection or strength, which would indeed be injurious to  the performance of every feminine function.    We may now advance another step in the subject under discussion. What,  then, are the peculiar physical characters of beings thus possessing sense  and motion, and thus characterized by fitness?    \"It must be remembered,\" says Knight, \"that irregularity is the general  characteristic of trees, and regularity that of animals.\"--It would have  been more correct to say that symmetry is this peculiar characteristic.  There is little resemblance between the parts of one side; and it is  symmetry which results from the uniform disposition of double parts, and  from the regular division of single ones.    Hence an agreeable impression is produced by the corresponding disposition  and the exact resemblance of the eyes, of the eyebrows, of the ears, of  the hemispheres of the bosom, and of the different parts of which the  limbs are composed; and the forehead, the nose, the mouth, the abdomen,  the back, are agreeably distinguished by means of the median line which  divides them.    It appears that the eye is pleased by the exactness of corresponding  parts; and that symmetry is the first character of beauty in thinking  beings.    Occasional irregularity makes us better appreciate the importance of  symmetry. The oblique direction of the eyes, squinting, twisting of the  nose or lips, unequal magnitude of the hemispheres of the bosom, or  unequal length of the limbs, disfigure the most beautiful person.    But how does symmetry contribute to fitness, or why is it necessary?    \"All our limbs and organs,\" says Payne Knight, \"serve us in pairs, and by  mutual co-operation with each other: whence the habitual association of  ideas has taught us to consider this uniformity as indispensable to the  beauty and perfection of the animal form. There is no reason to be deduced  from any abstract consideration of the nature of things, why an animal  should be more ugly and disgusting for having only one eye, or one ear,  than for having only one nose or one mouth; yet if we were to meet with a  beast with one eye, or two noses, or two mouths, in any part of the world,  we should, without inquiry, decide it to be a monster, and turn from it  with abhorrence: neither is there any reason, in the nature of things, why  a strict parity, or relative equality, in the correspondent limbs and  features of a man or a horse, should be absolutely essential to beauty,  and absolutely destructive of it in the roots and branches of a tree. But,  nevertheless, the Creator having formed the one regular, and the other  irregular, we habitually associate ideas of regularity to the perfection  of one, and ideas of irregularity to the perfection of the other; and this  habit has been so unvaried, as to have become natural.\"    This is the common cant of every weak man at loss for a reason. Now, it is  not by any \"habitual association\" with \"our limbs and organs serving us in  pairs,\" that we are \"taught to consider this uniformity indispensable to  beauty,\" but because, independent of all association, we could not  conveniently walk upon one leg, or, indeed, on any unequal number of legs:  and there being two sides in the moving organs, there are necessarily two  in the sensitive organs, which are mere portions of the same general  system. Thus it is locomotion to be performed that renders \"a strict  parity, or relative equality, in the correspondent limbs and features of a  man or a horse\" absolutely essential to beauty; and it is the absence of  locomotion which renders it utterly worthless, and therefore very rare, in  \"the roots and branches of a tree.\"    In animals, proportion is not less essential than symmetry. It is indeed  the second character of this kind of beauty. As this part of the subject  has been perfectly well treated by Mr. Alison, I need only quote what he  has said:--    \"It is this expression of fitness which is, I apprehend, the source of the  beauty of what is strictly and properly called proportion in the parts of  the human form.    \"We expect a different form, and a different conformation of limbs, in a  running footman and a waterman, in a wrestler and a racing groom, in a  shepherd and a sailor, &c.    \"They who are conversant in the productions of the fine arts, must have  equally observed, that the forms and proportions of features, which the  sculptor and the painter have given to their works, are very different,  according to the nature of the character they represent, and the emotion  they wish to excite. The form or proportions of the features of Jove are  different from those of Hercules; those of Apollo, from those of Ganymede;  those of the Fawn, from those of the Gladiator. In female beauty, the form  and proportions in the features of Juno are very different from those of  Venus; those of Minerva, from those of Diana; those of Niobe, from those  of the Graces. All, however, are beautiful; because all are adapted with  exquisite taste to the characters they wish the countenance to express.\"    In \"the Hercules and the Antinous, the Jupiter and the Apollo, we find  that not only the proportions of the form, but those of every limb, are  different; and that the pleasure we feel in these proportions arises from  their exquisite fitness for the physical ends which the artists were  consulting.    \"The illustration, however, may be made still more precise; for, even in  the same countenance, and in the same hour, the same form of feature may  be beautiful or otherwise.\"      SECTION IV.    ELEMENTS OF BEAUTY AS EMPLOYED IN OBJECTS OF ART.    I divide the arts into the useful, the ornamental, and the intellectual,  commonly called the fine arts; and I shall endeavor to show, that the  objects of each of these are characterized by a peculiar kind of beauty,  corresponding to one of those already described.    I shall endeavor to show that the objects of the useful arts are  characterized by the simple"]]]
