THE ORIGIN OF THE BOOK OF MORMON.    BY BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS    (A Reply to Mr. Theodore Schroeder)    1.    When one undertakes at this late day a serious discussion of the  Spaulding theory of the origin of the Book of Mormon, he instinctively  feels inclined to begin with an apology to his readers. When Pococke  inquired of Grotius, where the proof was of that story of the pigeon,  trained to pick peas from Mahomet's ear, and pass for an angel  dictating the Koran to him, Grotius answered that there was no proof.  The statement here is Carlyle's; and the gruff old Scotch philosopher  adds in his sour fashion, \"It is really time to dismiss all that.\" [1]  So indeed we think of this Spaulding myth in reference to its being the  origin of the Book of Mormon.    [Footnote 1: \"Heroes and Hero Worship,\" by Thomas Carlyle, lecture II.]    When the Church of which the Book of Mormon may be said, in a way, to  have been the origin has survived the most cruel religious persecution  of modern times, first in the expulsion of from twelve to fifteen  thousand of its members from the state of Missouri; and, second, in the  murder of its first prophet in Illinois, followed by the expatriation  of between twenty and thirty thousand of its members from the territory  of the United States; when that religious movement to which the Book  of Mormon may be said to have given the first impulse, and is now a  continuous, sustaining factor, has resulted in the founding of a number  of American commonwealths in the inter-mountain country of the United  States; [2] when that people who accept the Book of Mormon as a divine  revelation have established, for an extent of well nigh three thousand  miles through the plateau valleys of the Rocky Mountains--from the  province of Alberta, Canada, to the states of Chihuahua and Sonora in  the republic of Mexico--no less than between seven and nine hundred  settlements, many of them prosperous towns of large manufacturing as  well as of large agriculture and trade interests; when that same people  have won world-wide renown as superior colonizers, and are eagerly  sought for in such enterprises because of their well known sobriety,  honesty, frugality and industry; when that same people are quietly  building up an educational system including as it does the rounding  of universities in its principal centers, and academies elsewhere as  feeders to the central educational institutions; [3] when those who  accept the Book of Mormon as a divine revelation continuously sustain a  corps of missionaries, numbering from fifteen to eighteen hundred, to  carry their message to the world, and these missionaries are at work  in nearly all civilized nations, and in the islands of the Pacific,  meeting their own expenses and manifesting the unselfishness of their  faith by their works--their service for God and fellowman; when the  Book of Mormon itself has been accepted in the first three-quarters of  a century of its existence by hundreds of thousands of earnest people  of average intelligence and certainly of independent character; when  the Book of Mormon itself has been translated into and published in at  least eleven languages, in a number of which it has run through many  editions and the copies published run into the hundreds of thousands,  and with no abatement of interest yet manifested; when the Book of  Mormon is creating not only a people but also a literature, embracing  history, poetry and philosophy; when it is inspiring music, painting  and sculpture--when all this has come of the Book of Mormon, is it  not really about time to dismiss all that silly talk of the Spaulding  manuscript being stolen by Rigdon, revamped by him and palmed off upon  the world by a backwoods boy as a revelation, and this practiced fraud  and deception being the origin of all this that is here enumerated?    [Footnote 2: It must not be supposed that the migration of the Mormon  people to the Salt Lake and adjacent valleys when that region was  Mexican territory, resulted only in the founding of the state of  Utah. Indirectly and directly, too, that movement contributed to the  settlement of the entire inter-mountain region, and the founding of the  States created out of that territory.]    [Footnote 3: This refers to the Brigham Young University at Provo,  Utah, the Latter-day Saints' University in Salt Lake City, and fifteen  Colleges and Academies in other parts of the territory occupied by the  Saints in the inter-mountain west. See \"Defense of the Faith and the  Saints,\" Vol. I, p. 226.]    What faith men must have in fraud and dishonesty to think it can start  and sustain all this! What a lasting victory is accorded to a thing  conceived in fraud, brought forth in iniquity, and perpetuated by  continuous falsehood! What credulity is required to believe all this!  Let no one hereafter, standing in such ranks, dare say that \"cheat\" is  a horse good only for a short race. They must know better than that  from the stand they take in this Book of Mormon matter.    JUSTIFICATIONS FOR REPLYING TO MR. SCHROEDER    Two things, yea, three, justify a reply to Mr. Theodore Schroeder's  series of articles on \"The Origin of the Book of Mormon,\" published  in the September and November numbers of the _American Historical  Magazine,_ for 1906, and the January and May numbers for 1907.    The first justification is the fact of the high standing of the  magazine in which his articles appeared. Published in a periodical of  such rank, if unchallenged, they might lead many to believe undeniable  the theory there advanced for the origin of the Book of Mormon, and  the argument by which said theory is sustained, unanswerable. It has  been from just such circumstances as these with reference to articles  that appeared in standard works, in histories and encyclopedias,  that Mormonism suffered so much defamation in the earlier year of  its existence. It now stands recorded in the earlier editions of the  American Cyclopedia and in the Encyclopedia Britannica that David  Whitmer denied his testimony as one of the witnesses to the divinity  of the Book of Mormon; and that his two associate witnesses, Oliver  Cowdery and Martin Harris, had denied their testimony to that book.  Being misinformed from these high sources of information, doubtless  tens of thousands have been impressed with those untrue statements.  David Whitmer never denied his testimony. In a brochure issued by  himself, in 1887, and referring directly to these false statements, he  said:        \"It is recorded in the American Cyclopedia and the Encyclopedia      Britannica, that I, David Whitmer, have denied my testimony as one      of the three witnesses to the divinity of the Book of Mormon; and      that the other two witnesses, Oliver Cowdery and Martin Harris,      denied their testimony to that Book. I will say once more to all      mankind, that I have never at any time denied that testimony or      any part thereof. I also testify to the world, that neither Oliver      Cowdery nor Martin Harris ever at any time denied their testimony.      They both died reaffirming the truth of the divine authenticity of      the Book of Mormon.\" [4]    [Footnote 4: \"Address to all Believers in Christ,\" p. 8. The high  character and reputation for truthfulness of David Whitmer is attested  in this brochure by all the leading officials and citizens of Richmond,  Mo., (not Mormons) where he lived for fifty years, pp. 8-10.]    People, however, can still quote the above named standard works to  prove that these men denied their testimony and were false witnesses.  It is to prevent as far as possible the creation of such conditions  respecting Mr. Schroeder's articles in the American Historical Magazine  that I think it important that they should be answered.    The second thing that justifies an answer to Mr. Schroeder, is the  form in which his treatment of the subject is cast. Much in the form  would lead one to believe, at first glance, that here we had a really  exhaustive treatise of the origin of the Book of Mormon; that every  item of obtainable information had been collected, the mass of facts  sifted and net results given, instead of a specious plea made for a  special theory. This is evidenced in the constant appeal to sources of  information in the notes appended to the articles, of which notes there  are one hundred and ninety-six. Then there is an occasional halting in  the movement of the argument, as if to weigh the evidence, to balance  one statement against another as if to get down to bed-rock facts,  instead of a mere effort to remove some obstruction in the way of the  special theory being worked out. All of which is but so much juggling  with forms of treatment,--an effort to win the reader with the shows  of honest argument, to betray him in deeper consequences. Shimmering  under all these forms may be seen the arts of the special pleader bent  on making out a case. It is the false appearance of exhaustive and  fair treatment of the subject that makes it desirable to answer Mr.  Schroeder.    The third justification for answering Mr. Schroeder's articles arises  out of a suggestion of the gentleman himself, near the close of his  article, namely, that the actors who participated in the origin of  the Book of Mormon are all dead, and that \"upon the precise question  here discussed, no new evidence is likely to be discovered. All the  evidence directly affecting either side of the question has been  introduced and reviewed.\" One may pardon the conscious or unconscious"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/529"],[0,"Knights of Art: Stories of the Italian Painters (#18)"],[1,"haunts  of beauty and delight.    For most people the very name of 'Raphael' is like the 'Open Sesame' of  the robber chief in the old story. In a moment a door seems to open out  of the commonplace everyday world, and through it they see a stretch of  fair sweet country. There their eyes rest upon gentle, dark-eyed  Madonnas, who smile down lovingly upon the heavenly Child, playing at  her side or resting in her arms. The little St. John is also there,  companion of the Infant Christ; rosy, round-limbed children both, half  human and half divine. And standing in the background are a crowd of  grave, quiet figures, each one alive with interest, while over all  there is a glow of intense vivid colour.    We know but little of the everyday life of this great artist. When we  hear his name, it is of his different pictures that we think at once,  for they are world-famous. We almost forget the man as we gaze at his  work.    It was in the little village of Urbino, in Umbria, that Raphael was  born. His father was a painter called Giovanni Santi, and from him  Raphael inherited his love of Art. His mother, Magia, was a sweet,  gracious woman, and the little Raphael was like her in character and  beauty. It seemed as if the boy had received every good gift that  Nature could bestow. He had a lovely oval face, and soft dark eyes that  shone with a beauty that was more of heaven than earth, and told of a  soul which was as pure and lovely as his face. Above all, he had the  gift of making every one love him, so that his should have been a happy  sunshiny life.    But no one can ever escape trouble, and when Raphael was only eight  years old, the first cloud overspread his sky. His mother died, and  soon after his father married again.    The new mother was very young, and did not care much for children, but  Raphael did not mind that as long as he could be with his father. But  three years later a blacker cloud arose and blotted out the sunshine  from his life, for his father too died, and left him all alone.    The boy had loved his father dearly, and it had been his great delight  to be with him in the studio, to learn to grind and mix the colours and  watch those wonderful pictures grow from day to day.    But now all was changed. The quiet studio rang with angry voices, and  the peaceful home was the scene of continual quarrelling. Who was to  have the money, and how were the Santi estates to be divided?  Stepmother and uncle wrangled from morning until night, and no one gave  a thought to the child Raphael. It was only the money that mattered.    Then when it seemed that the boy's training was going to be totally  neglected, kindly help arrived. Simone di Ciarla, brother of Raphael's  own mother, came to look after his little nephew, and ere long carried  him off from the noisy, quarrelsome household, and took him to Perugia.    'Thou shalt have the best teaching in all Italy,' said Simone as they  walked through the streets of the town. 'The great master to whose  studio we go, can hold his own even among the artists of Florence. See  that thou art diligent to learn all that he can teach thee, so that  thou mayest become as great a painter as thy father.'    'Am I to be the pupil of the great Perugino?' asked Raphael, his eyes  shining with pleasure. 'I have often heard my father speak of his  marvellous pictures.'    'We will see if he can take thee,' answered his uncle.    The boy's heart sunk. What if the master refused to take him as a  pupil? Must he return to idleness and the place which was no longer  home?    But soon his fears were set at rest. Perugino, like every one else,  felt the charm of that beautiful face and gentle manner, and when he  had seen some drawings which the boy had done, he agreed readily that  Raphael should enter the studio and become his pupil.    Perugia had been passing through evil times just before this. The two  great parties of the Oddi and Baglioni families were always at war  together. Whichever of them happened to be the stronger held the city  and drove out the other party, so that the fighting never ceased either  inside or outside the gates. The peaceful country round about had been  laid waste and desolate. The peasants did not dare go out to till their  fields or prune their olive-trees. Mothers were afraid to let their  little ones out of their sight, for hungry wolves and other wild beasts  prowled about the deserted countryside.    Then came a day when the outside party managed to creep silently into  the city, and the most terrible fight of all began. So long and  fiercely did the battle rage that almost all the Oddi were killed. Then  for a time there was peace in Perugia and all the country round.    So it happened that as soon as the people of Perugia had time to think  of other things besides fighting, they began to wish that their town  might be put in order, and that the buildings which had been injured  during the struggles might be restored.    This was a good opportunity for peaceful men like Perugino, for there  was much work to be done, and both he and his pupils were kept busy  from morning till night.    Of all his pupils, Perugino loved the young Raphael best. He saw at  once that this was no ordinary boy.    'He is my pupil now, but soon he will be my master,' he used to say as  he watched the boy at work.    So he taught him with all possible carefulness, and was never tired of  giving him good advice.    'Learn first of all to draw,' he would say, when Raphael looked with  longing eyes at the colours and brushes of the master. 'Draw everything  you see, no matter what it is, but always draw and draw again. The rest  will follow; but if the knowledge of drawing be lacking, nothing will  afterwards succeed. Keep always at hand a sketch-book, and draw therein  carefully every manner of thing that meets thy eye.'    Raphael never forgot the good advice of his master. He was never  without a sketch-book, and his drawings now are almost as interesting  as his great pictures, for they show the first thought that came into  his mind, before the picture was composed.    So the years passed on, and Raphael learned all that the master could  teach him. At first his pictures were so like Perugino's, that it was  difficult to know whether they were the work of the master or the pupil.    But the quiet days at Perugia soon came to an end, and Perugino went  back to Florence. For some time Raphael worked at different places near  Perugia, and then followed his master to the City of Flowers, where  every artist longed to go. Though he was still but a young man, the  world had already begun to notice his work, and Florence gladly  welcomed a new artist.    It was just at that time that Leonardo da Vinci's fame was at its  height, and when Raphael was shown some of the great man's work, he was  filled with awe and wonder. The genius of Leonardo held him spellbound.    'It is what I have dreamed of in my dreams,' he said. 'Oh that I might  learn his secret!'    Little by little the new ideas sunk into his heart, and the pictures he  began to paint were no longer like those of his old master Perugino,  but seemed to breathe some new spirit.    It was always so with Raphael. He seemed to be able to gather the best  from every one, just as the bee goes from flower to flower and gathers  its sweetness into one golden honeycomb. Only the genius of Raphael  made all that he touched his very own, and the spirit of his pictures  is unlike that of any other master.    For many years after this he lived in Rome, where now his greatest  frescoes may be seen--frescoes so varied and wonderful that many books  have been written about them.    There he first met Margarita, the young maiden whom he loved all his  life. It is her face which looks down upon us from the picture of the  Sistine Madonna, perhaps the most famous Madonna that ever was painted.  The little room in the Dresden Gallery where this picture now hangs  seems almost like a holy place, for surely there is something divine in  that fair face. There she stands, the Queen of Heaven, holding in her  arms the Infant Christ, with such a strange look of majesty and sadness  in her eyes as makes us realise that she was indeed fit to be the  Mother of our Lord.    But the picture which all children love best is one in Florence called  'The Madonna of the Goldfinch.'    It is a picture of the Holy Family, the Infant Jesus, His mother, and  the little St. John. The Christ Child is a dear little curly-headed  baby, and He stands at His mother's knee with one little bare foot  resting on hers. His hand is stretched out protectingly over a yellow  goldfinch which St. John, a sturdy little figure clad in goatskins, has  just brought to Him. The baby face is full of tender love and care for  the little fluttering prisoner, and His curved hand is held over its  head to protect it.    'Do not hurt My bird,' He seems to say to the eager St. John, 'for it  belongs to Me and to My Father.'    These are only two of the many pictures which Raphael painted. It is  wonderful to think how much work he did in his short life, for he died  when he was only thirty-seven. He had been at work at St. Peter's,  giving directions about some alterations, and there he was seized by a  severe chill, and in a few days the news spread like wildfire through  the country that Raphael was dead.    It seemed almost as if it could not be true. He had been so full of  life and health, so eager for work, such a living power among men.    But there he lay, beautiful in death as he had been in life, and over  his head was hung the picture of the 'Transfiguration,' on which he had  been at work, its colours yet wet, never to be finished by that still  hand.    All Rome flocked to his funeral, and high and low mourned his loss. But  he left behind him a fame which can never die, a name which through all  these four hundred years has never lost the magic"]]]
