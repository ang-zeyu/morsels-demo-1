The whole of the northern lords hold aloof, and in the  south Carrick and Annandale and Galloway are hostile. Against me  I have all the power of England, Wales, and Ireland; and although  I may for a time win victories and capture towns I am certain,  Archie, in the end to be crushed.\"    \"And will all our efforts have been in vain?\" Archie said, with  tears in his eyes.    \"By no means, my brave lad; we shall have lighted the fire of a  national resistance; we shall have shown the people that if Scotland,  divided against herself, and with all her great nobles and their  vassals standing sullenly aloof, can yet for a long time make head  against the English, assuredly when the time shall come, and she  shall rise as one man from the Solway to Caithness, her freedom  will be won. Our lives will not have been thrown away, Archie, if  they have taught this lesson.\"    Wallace had by this time returned from his expedition farther  north, and his force was in camp near Lanark, which town, when not  engaged in distant enterprises, was regarded as the centre of the  movement. That evening Archie said, that as his leader purposed to  give his troops rest for a week or two, he should go to his uncle's  for a short time.    \"And if you can spare them, Sir William, I would fain let my band  go away for the same time. They have now been six months from home.\"    \"Certainly,\" Wallace said, \"they need a rest after their hard work.  They are ever afoot, and have been of immense service.\"    Having obtained this permission, Archie went to the spot where his  band were encamped. \"I have another expedition for you,\" he said,  \"this time all together; when that is over you will be able to go  home for a few days for a rest. They will all be glad to see you,  and may well be proud of you, and I doubt not that the spoil which  you gathered at Ayr and elsewhere will create quite a sensation at  Glen Cairn. There are some of you who are, as I remember in the old  days, good shots with the bow and arrow. Do ten of you who were  the best at home get bows and arrows from the store. Here is an  order for you to receive them, and be all in readiness to march at  daylight.\"    The next morning the band set out in a southwesterly direction,  and after a long day's march halted near Cumnock.  In the morning  they started at the same time, observing more caution as they went,  for by the afternoon they had crossed the stream and were within the  boundaries of Carrick. They halted for the night near Crossraguel  Abbey. Here for the first time Archie confided to his followers  the object of their march.    \"We are now,\" he said, \"within a few miles of Turnberry Castle, the  residence of Bruce. Sir William has a great desire to speak with  him; but, seeing that Bruce is at present fighting for King Edward  against Douglas, there is little chance of such a meeting coming  about with his goodwill. He has recently returned from Douglasdale.  Here, in the heart of his own country, it is like enough that he  may ride near his castle with but a few horsemen. In that case we  will seize him, without, I trust, having to do him hurt, and will  bear him with us to Lanark. We may have to wait some time before  we find an opportunity; but even if the ten days for which I have  asked, lengthen to as many weeks, Sir William will not grudge the  time we have spent if we succeed. Tomorrow morning let those who  have bows go out in the forest and see if they can shoot a deer;  or failing that, bring in a sheep or two from some of the folds.  As each of you has brought with you meal for ten days, we shall be  able to keep an eye on Turnberry for some time.\"    The next day Archie, with Andrew Macpherson and Cluny Campbell,  made their way through the woods until within sight of the castle,  which was but a mile distant. The strongholds of the lords of  Carrick stood on a bold promontory washed by the sea.    \"It would be a hard nut to crack, Sir Archie,\" his lieutenant said.  \"Unless by famine, the place could scarce be taken.\"    \"No,\" Archie replied, \"I am glad that our mission is rather to  capture the earl than his castle. It is a grand fortalice.  Would  that its owner were but a true Scotchman! This is a good place on  which we are standing, Andrew, to place a scout. Among the trees  here he can watch the road all the way from the castle to the point  where it enters the forest.  Do you, Cluny, take post here at once.  Mark well all that passes, and what is doing, and all bodies of men  who enter or leave the castle. There is no occasion to bring news  to me, for it would be unlikely that we should meet in the forest;  you have therefore only to watch. Tomorrow I shall return with the  band, and encamp in the woods farther back. Directly we arrive,  you will be relieved of your guard.\"    The following day the band moved up to a spot within half a mile  of the seaward edge of the forest, and a few hundred yards from the  road to Crossraguel Abbey.  It was only on this road that Archie  could hope to effect a capture; for the country near the coast was  free of trees, and no ambush could be set. The lords of Carrick  were, moreover, patrons of the abbey; and Bruce might ride over  thither with but a small party, whereas, if journeying south, or  southeast towards Douglasdale, he would probably be marching with  a strong force. For several days they watched the castle; bodies of  mounted men entered and departed. Twice parties, among whom ladies  could be seen, came out with their hawks; but none came within  reach of their lurking foes.    On the fifth morning, however, the lad on watch ran into the glade  in which they were encamped and reported that a small body of  seemingly two or three knights, with some ladies, followed by four  mounted men, had left the castle and were approaching by the route  towards the abbey.    Not a moment was lost. Archie placed six of his company, with pike  and sword, close to the road, to form across it when he gave the  order, and to bar the retreat of any party who had passed. Another  party of equal strength he placed 100 yards further on, and with  them himself took post; while he placed four, armed with bows and  arrows, on either side, near the party which he commanded. Scarcely  had his preparations been made when a trampling of horses was heard,  and the party were seen approaching. They consisted of Robert Bruce,  his brother Nigel, and three of his sisters--Isabel, Mary, and  Christina. Behind rode four men-at-arms.  From the description which  he had heard of him Archie had no doubt that the elder of the two  knights was Robert Bruce himself, and when they approached within  thirty yards he gave a shout, and, with his band, with levelled  spears, drew up across the road. At the same moment the other party  closed in behind the horsemen; and the eight archers, with bent  bows and arrows drawn to the head, rose among the trees. The party  reined in their horses suddenly.    \"Hah! what have we here?\" Bruce exclaimed. \"An ambush--and on  all sides too!\" he added as he looked round.  \"What means this?  Are you robbers who thus dare attack the Bruce within a mile of  Turnberry?  Why, they are but lads,\" he added scornfully. \"Rein  back, girls; we and the men-at-arms will soon clear a way for you  through these varlets. Nay, I can do it single handed myself.\"    \"Halt! Sir Robert Bruce,\" Archie exclaimed in a loud clear voice.  \"If you move I must perforce give the word, and it may well be that  some of the ladies with you may be struck with the arrows; nor,  young though my followers may be, would you find them so easy a  conquest as you imagine. They have stood up before the English ere  now; and you and your men-at-arms will find it hard work to get  through their pikes; and we outnumber you threefold. We are no  robbers. I myself am Sir Archibald Forbes.\"    \"You!\" exclaimed Robert Bruce, lowering his sword, which he  had drawn at the first alarm and held uplifted in readiness for a  charge; \"you Sir Archibald Forbes! I have heard the name often as  that of one of Wallace's companions, who, with Sir John Grahame,  fought with him bravely at the captures of Lanark, Ayr, and other  places, but surely you cannot be he!\"    \"I am Sir Archibald Forbes, I pledge you my word,\" Archie said  quietly; \"and, Sir Robert Bruce, methinks that if I, who am, as  you see, but yet a lad--not yet having reached my seventeenth  year--can have done good service for Scotland, how great the  shame that you, a valiant knight and a great noble, should be in  the ranks of her oppressors, and not of her champions! My name will  tell you that I have come hither for no purpose of robbery. I have  come on a mission from Wallace--not sent thereon by him, but  acting myself in consequences of words which dropped from him.  He  said how sad it was that you, who might be King of a Scotland free  and independent, by the choice of her people, should prefer the  chance of reigning, a mere puppet of Edward, over an enslaved land.  He spoke in the highest terms of your person, and held that, did  you place yourself at its head, the movement which he commands  would be a successful one. Then I determined, unknown to him, to  set out and bring you to him face to face--honourably and with  courtesy if you would, by force if you would not. I would fain it  shall be the former; but believe me, you would not find it easy to  break away through the hedge of pikes now around you.\"    By this time the whole party had gathered round the horsemen. Bruce  hesitated; his mind was not yet made up as to his future course.

The economy is based      on the output of a narrow range of agricultural products, such as jute,      which is the main cash crop and major source of export earnings, and rice.      Bangladesh is hampered by a relative lack of natural resources, population      growth of more than 2% a year, large-scale unemployment, and a limited      infrastructure; furthermore, it is highly vulnerable to natural disasters.      Despite these constraints, real GDP growth averaged about 3.5% annually      during 1985-89. A strong agricultural performance in FY90 pushed the growth      rate up to 6.2%, and FY91 saw further, though smaller, increases in output.      Alleviation of poverty remains the cornerstone of the government's      development strategy.
