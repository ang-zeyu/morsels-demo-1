The  parlour-maid opened the door and smiled brightly at him. \"Miss  Daisy is upstairs in the drawing-room,\" she said. \"Thank you,\" he  replied, \"I will announce myself.\" (Now you see how we know that  they were engaged. He must have announced himself in order to  have reached the situation implied in the \"agony,\" and he would  not have been allowed to do so if he had not had the standing of  a fiance.)    For a moment before knocking Patrick stood outside the drawing-  room door, and in that moment the tragedy occurred; he heard his  lady's voice. \"DARLING!\" it said, \"she SHALL kiss her sweetest,  ownest, little pupsy-wupsy.\"    Patrick's brow grew black. His strong jaw clenched (just like the  jaws of those people on the stage), and he staggered back from  the door. \"This is the end,\" he muttered. Then he strode down the  stairs and out into the stifling streets. And up in the drawing-  room of the house in Netting Hill Daisy and the toy pom sat and  wondered why their lord and master was so late.    Now we come to the letter which Patrick wrote to Daisy, telling  her that it was all over. He would explain to her how he had  \"accidentally\"(he would dwell upon that) accidentally overheard  her and her----(probably he was rather coarse here) exchanging  terms of endearment; he would accuse her of betraying one whose  only fault was that he loved her not wisely but too well; he  would announce gloomily that he had lost his faith in women. All  this is certain. But it would appear also that he made some such  threat as this--most likely in a postscript: \"It is no good your  writing. There can be no explanation. Your letters will be  destroyed unopened.\" It is a question, however, if even this  would have prevented Daisy from trying an appeal by post, for  though one may talk about destroying letters unopened, it is an  extremely difficult thing to do. I feel, therefore, that  Patrick's letter almost certainly contained a P.P.S. also--to  this effect: \"I cannot remain in London where we have spent so  many happy hours together. I am probably leaving for the Rocky  Mountains to-night. Letters will not be forwarded. Do not attempt  to follow me.\"    And so Daisy was left with only the one means of communication  and explanation--the agony columns of the morning newspapers. \"I  was alone when you called. You heard me talking to the dog.  PLEASE make appointment.\" In the last sentence there is just a  hint of irony which I find very attractive. It seems to me to  say, \"Don't for heaven's sake come rushing back to Notting Hill  (all love and remorse) without warning, or you might hear me  talking to the cat or the canary. Make an appointment, and I'll  take care that there's NOTHING in the room when you come.\" We may  tell ourselves, I think, that Daisy understands her Patrick. In  fact, I am beginning to understand Patrick myself, and I see now  that the real reason why Daisy chose the agony column as the  medium of communication was that she knew Patrick would prefer  it. Patrick is distinctly the sort of man who likes agony  columns. I am sure it was the first thing he turned to on  Wednesday morning.    It occurs to me to wonder if the honeymoon will be spent at  Ilfracombe. Patrick must have received William Benson's picture  post card too. We have all had one. Just fancy if he HAD gone to  the Rocky Mountains; almost certainly Mr. Benson's letters would  not have been forwarded.          The Label      On those rare occasions when I put on my best clothes and venture  into society, I am always astonished at the number of people in  it whom I do not know. I have stood in a crowded ball-room, or  sat in a crowded restaurant, and reflected that, of all the  hundreds of souls present, there was not one of whose existence I  had previously had any suspicion. Yet they all live tremendously  important lives, lives not only important to themselves but to  numbers of friends and relations; every day they cross some sort  of Rubicon; and to each one of them there comes a time when the  whole of the rest of the world (including--confound it!--me)  seems absolutely of no account whatever. That I had lived all  these years in contented ignorance of their existence makes me a  little ashamed.    To-day in my oldest clothes I have wandered through the index of  The Times Literary Supplement, and I am now feeling a little  ashamed of my ignorance of so many books. Of novels alone there  seem to be about 900. To write even a thoroughly futile novel is,  to my thinking, a work of extraordinary endurance; yet in, say,  600 houses this work has been going on, and I (and you, and all  of us) have remained utterly unmoved. Well, I have been making up  for my indifference this morning. I have been reading the titles  of the books. That is not so good (or bad) as reading the books  themselves, but it enables me to say that I have heard of such  and such a novel, and in some cases it does give me a slight clue  to what goes on inside.    I should imagine that the best part of writing a novel was the  choosing a title. My idea of a title is that it should be  something which reflects the spirit of your work and gives the  hesitating purchaser some indication of what he is asked to buy.  To call your book Ethnan Frame or Esther Grant or John Temple or  John Merridew (I quote from the index) is to help the reader not  at all. All it tells him is that one of the characters inside  will be called John or Esther--a matter, probably, of  indifference to him. Phyllis is a better title, because it does  give a suggestion of the nature of the book. No novel with a  tragic ending, no powerful realistic novel, would be called  Phyllis. Without having read Phyllis I should say that it was a  charming story of suburban life, told mostly in dialogue, and  that Phyllis herself was a perfect dear--though a little cruel  about that first box of chocolates he sent her. However, she  married him in the end all right.    But if you don't call your book Phyllis or John Temple or Mrs.  Elmsley, what--I hear you asking--are you to call it? Well, you  might call it Kapak, as I see somebody has done. The beauty of  Kapak as a title is that if you come into the shop by the back  entrance, and so approach the book from the wrong end, it is  still Kapak. A title which looks the same from either end is of  immense advantage to an author. Besides, in this particular case  there is a mystery about Kapak which one is burning to solve. Is  it the bride's pet name for her father-in-law, the password into  the magic castle, or that new stuff with which you polish brown  boots? Or is it only a camera? Let us buy the book at once and  find out.    Another mystery title is The Man with Thicker Beard, which  probably means something. It is like Kapak in this, that it reads  equally well backwards; but it is not so subtle. Still, we should  probably be lured on to buy it. On the other hand, A Welsh  Nightingale and a Would-be Suffragette is just the sort of book  to which we would not be tempted by the title. It is bad enough  to have to say to the shopman, \"Have you A Welsh Nightingale and  a Would-be Suffragette?\" but if we forgot the title, as we  probably should, and had to ask at random for a would-be  nightingale and a Welsh suffragette, or a wood nightingale and a  Welsh rabbit, or the Welsh suffragette's night in gaol, we should  soon begin to wish that we had decided on some quite simple book  such as Greed, Earth, or Jonah.    And this is why a French title is always such a mistake. Authors  must remember that their readers have not only to order the book,  in many cases, verbally, but also to recommend it to their  friends. So I think Mr. Oliver Onions made a mistake when he  called his collection of short stories Pot au Feu. It is a good  title, but it is the sort of title to which the person to whom  you are recommending the book always answers, \"What?\" And when  people say \"What?\" in reply to your best Parisian accent, the  only thing possible for you is to change the subject altogether.  But it is quite time that we came to some sort of decision as to  what makes the perfect title. Kapak will attract buyers, as I  have said, though to some it may not seem quite fair. Excellent  from a commercial point of view, it does not satisfy the  conditions we laid down at first. The title, we agreed, must  reflect the spirit of the book. In one sense Five Gallons of  Gasolene does this, but of course nobody could ask for that in a  book-shop.    Well, then, here is a perfect title, Their High Adventure. That  explains itself just sufficiently. When a Man's Married, For  Henri and Navarre, and The King Over the Water are a little more  obvious, but they are still good. The Love Story of a Mormon  makes no attempt to deceive the purchaser, but it can hardly be  called a beautiful title. Melody in Silver, on the other hand, is  beautiful, but for this reason makes one afraid to buy it, lest  there should be disappointment within. In fact, as I look down  the index, I am beginning to feel glad that there are so many  hundreds of novels which I haven't read. In most of them there  would be disappointment. And really one only reads books nowadays  so as to be able to say to one's neighbour on one's rare  appearances in society, \"HAVE you read The Forged Coupon, and  WHAT do you think of The Muck Rake?\" And for this an index is  quite enough.          The Profession      I have been reading a little book called How to Write for the  Press. Other books which have been published upon the same  subject are How to Be an Author, How to Write a Play, How to  Succeed as a Journalist, How to Write for the Magazines, and How  to Earn L600 a Year with the Pen. Of these the last-named has, I  think, the most pleasing title. Anybody can write a play; the  trouble is to get it produced. Almost anybody can be an author;  the business is to collect money and fame from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5805"],[0,"The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel (#18)"],[1,"room to a wardrobe, which you will see in  front of you. Open it. It is hung full of shabby clothes; put these  aside, and you will notice that the panels at the back do not fit very  closely, as if the wardrobe was old or had been badly put together.  Insert your fingers in the tiny aperture between the two middle panels.  These slide back easily: there is a recess immediately behind them. Get  in there; pull the doors of the wardrobe together first, then slide the  back panels into their place. You will be perfectly safe there, as the  house is not under suspicion at present, and even if the revolutionary  guard, under some meddle-some sergeant or other, chooses to pay it a  surprise visit, your hiding-place will be perfectly secure. Now is all  that quite understood?\"    \"Absolutely, milor,\" replied Lenegre, even as he made ready to obey Sir  Percy's orders, \"but what about you? You cannot get out of this house,  milor,\" he urged; \"it is watched, I tell you.\"    \"La!\" broke in Blakeney, in his light-hearted way, \"and do you think I  didn't know that? I had to come and tell you about Pierre, and now I  must give those worthy gendarmes the slip somehow. I have my rooms  downstairs on the ground floor, as you know, and I must make certain  arrangements so that we can all get out of Paris comfortably this  evening. The demmed place is no longer safe either for you, my good  Lenegre, or for petite maman and Rosette. But wherever I may be,  meanwhile, don't worry about me. As soon as the gendarmes have been and  gone, I'll go over to the Rue Ste. Anne and let you know what  arrangements I've been able to make. So do as I tell you now, and in  Heaven's name let me look after myself.\"    Whereupon, with scant ceremony, he hustled the old man out of the room.    Pere Lenegre had contrived to kiss petite maman and Rosette before he  went. It was touching to see the perfect confidence with which these  simple-hearted folk obeyed the commands of milor. Had he not saved  Pierre in his wonderful, brave, resourceful way? Of a truth he would  know how to save Pere Lenegre also. But, nevertheless, anguish gripped  the women's hearts; anguish doubly keen since the saviour of Pierre was  also in danger now.    When Pere Lenegre's shuffling footsteps had died away along the flagged  corridor, the stranger once more turned to the two women.    \"And now, petite maman,\" he said cheerily, as he kissed the old woman on  both her furrowed cheeks, \"keep up a good heart, and say your prayers  with Rosette. Your old man and I will both have need of them.\"    He did not wait to say good-bye, and anon it was his firm footstep that  echoed down the corridor. He went off singing a song, at the top of his  voice, for the whole house to hear, and for that traitor, Jean Baptiste,  to come rushing out of his room marvelling at the impudence of the man,  and cursing the Committee of Public Safety who were so slow in sending  the soldiers of the Republic to lay this impertinent Englishman by the  heels.      II    A quarter of an hour later half dozen men of the Republican Guard, with  corporal and sergeant in command, were in the small apartment on the  fifth floor of the tenement house in the Rue Jolivet. They had demanded  an entry in the name of the Republic, had roughly hustled petite maman  and Rosette, questioned them to Lenegre's whereabouts, and not satisfied  with the reply which they received, had turned the tidy little home  topsy-turvy, ransacked every cupboard, dislocated every bed, table or  sofa which might presumably have afforded a hiding place for a man.    Satisfied now that the \"suspect\" whom they were searching for was not on  the premises, the sergeant stationed four of his men with the corporal  outside the door, and two within, and himself sitting down in the centre  of the room ordered the two women to stand before him and to answer his  questions clearly on pain of being dragged away forthwith to the St.  Lazare house of detention.    Petite maman smoothed out her apron, crossed her arms before her, and  looked the sergeant quite straight in the face. Rosette's eyes were full  of tears, but she showed no signs of fear either, although her  shoulder--where one of the gendarmes had seized it so roughly--was  terribly painful.    \"Your husband, citizeness,\" asked the sergeant peremptorily, \"where is  he?\"    \"I am not sure, citizen,\" replied petite maman. \"At this hour he is  generally at the government works in the Quai des Messageries.\"    \"He is not there now,\" asserted the sergeant. \"We have knowledge that he  did not go back to his work since dinner-time.\"    Petite maman was silent.    \"Answer,\" ordered the sergeant.    \"I cannot tell you more, citizen sergeant,\" she said firmly. \"I do not  know.\"    \"You do yourself no good, woman, by this obstinacy,\" he continued  roughly. \"My belief is that your husband is inside this house, hidden  away somewhere. If necessary I can get orders to have every apartment  searched until he is found: but in that case it will go much harder with  you and with your daughter, and much harder too with your husband than  if he gave us no trouble and followed us quietly.\"    But with sublime confidence in the man who had saved Pierre and who had  given her explicit orders as to what she should do, petite maman, backed  by Rosette, reiterated quietly:    \"I cannot tell you more, citizen sergeant, I do not know.\"    \"And what about the Englishman?\" queried the sergeant more roughly, \"the  man they call the Scarlet Pimpernel, what do you know of him?\"    \"Nothing, citizen,\" replied petite maman, \"what should we poor folk know  of an English milor?\"    \"You know at any rate this much, citizeness, that the English milor  helped your son Pierre to escape from justice.\"    \"If that is so,\" said petite maman quietly, \"it cannot be wrong for a  mother to pray to God to bless her son's preserver.\"    \"It behooves every good citizen,\" retorted the sergeant firmly, \"to  denounce all traitors to the Republic.\"    \"But since I know nothing about the Englishman, citizen sergeant--?\"    And petite maman shrugged her thin shoulders as if the matter had ceased  to interest her.    \"Think again, citizeness,\" admonished the sergeant, \"it is your  husband's neck as well as your daughter's and your own that you are  risking by so much obstinacy.\"    He waited a moment or two as if willing to give the old woman time to  speak: then, when he saw that she kept her thin, quivering lips  resolutely glued together he called his corporal to him.    \"Go to the citizen Commissary of the Section,\" he commanded, \"and ask  for a general order to search every apartment in No. 24 Rue Jolivet.  Leave two of our men posted on the first and third landings of this  house and leave two outside this door. Be as quick as you can. You can  be back here with the order in half an hour, or perhaps the committee  will send me an extra squad; tell the citizen Commissary that this is a  big house, with many corridors. You can go.\"    The corporal saluted and went.    Petite maman and Rosette the while were still standing quietly in the  middle of the room, their arms folded underneath their aprons, their  wide-open, anxious eyes fixed into space. Rosette's tears were falling  slowly, one by one down her cheeks, but petite maman was dry-eyed. She  was thinking, and thinking as she had never had occasion to think  before.    She was thinking of the brave and gallant Englishman who had saved  Pierre's life only yesterday. The sergeant, who sat there before her,  had asked for orders from the citizen Commissary to search this big  house from attic to cellar. That is what made petite maman think and  think.    The brave Englishman was in this house at the present moment: the house  would be searched from attic to cellar and he would be found, taken, and  brought to the guillotine.    The man who yesterday had risked his life to save her boy was in  imminent and deadly danger, and she--petite maman--could do nothing to  save him.    Every moment now she thought to hear milor's firm tread resounding on  stairs or corridor, every moment she thought to hear snatches of an  English song, sung by a fresh and powerful voice, never after to-day to  be heard in gaiety again.    The old clock upon the shelf ticked away these seconds and minutes while  petite maman thought and thought, while men set traps to catch a  fellow-being in a deathly snare, and human carnivorous beasts lay  lurking for their prey.      III    Another quarter of an hour went by. Petite maman and Rosette had hardly  moved. The shadows of evening were creeping into the narrow room,  blurring the outlines of the pieces of furniture and wrapping all the  corners in gloom.    The sergeant had ordered Rosette to bring in a lamp. This she had done,  placing it upon the table so that the feeble light glinted upon the belt  and buckles of the sergeant and upon the tricolour cockade which was  pinned to his hat. Petite maman had thought and thought until she could  think no more.    Anon there was much commotion on the stairs; heavy footsteps were heard  ascending from below, then crossing the corridors on the various  landings. The silence which reigned otherwise in the house, and which  had fallen as usual on the squalid little street, void of traffic at  this hour, caused those footsteps to echo with ominous power.    Petite maman felt her heart beating so vigorously that she could hardly  breathe. She pressed her wrinkled hands tightly against her bosom.    There were the quick words of command, alas! so familiar in France just  now, the cruel, peremptory words that invariably preceded an arrest,  preliminaries to the dragging of some wretched--often wholly  harmless--creature before a tribunal that knew neither pardon nor mercy.    The sergeant, who had become drowsy in the close atmosphere of the tiny  room, roused himself at the sound and jumped to his feet. The door was"]]]
