Ready to shout for any leader  who might with vainglorious words set himself up as a patriot.    This Rohbar, perhaps, was planning to do just that.    And so was Derek! He said, \"Hope, if you could persuade the king to  postpone the festival--if Blanca would help persuade him--just until  to-morrow night....\"    \"I can try, Derek. But the festival is planned for an hour or two from  now.\"    \"Where is the king?\"    \"In his palace, near the festival gardens.\"    She gestured to the south. My mind went back to New York City. This  hillock, where we were standing in the starlight beside a tree, was in  my world about Fifth Avenue and Sixteenth Street. The king's palace--the  festival gardens--stood down at the Battery, where the rivers met in the  broad water of the harbor.           *       *       *       *       *    Derek was saying, \"We haven't much time: can you get us to the palace?\"    \"Yes. I have a cart down there on the road.\"    \"And the cloaks for Charlie and me?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Good!\" said Derek. \"We'll go with you. It's a long chance; he probably  won't postpone it. If he does not, we'll be among the audience. And when  he chooses the Red Sensua--\"    She shuddered, \"Oh, Derek--\" And I thought I heard her whisper, \"Oh,  Alexandre--\" and I saw his finger go to his lips.    His arm went around her. She huddled, small as a child against his tall,  muscular body.    He said gently, \"Don't be afraid, little Hope.\"    His face was grim, his eyes were gleaming. I saw him suddenly as an  instinctive military adventurer. An anachronism in our modern New York  City. Born in a wrong age. But here in this primitive realm he was at  home.    I plucked at him. \"How can you--how can we dare plunge into this thing?  Hidden with cloaks, yes. But you talk of leading these toilers.\"    He cast Hope away and confronted me. \"I can do it! You'll see, Charlie.\"  He was very strangely smiling. \"You'll see. But I don't want to come  into the open right away. Not to-night. But if we can only postpone this  accursed festival.\"    We had been talking perhaps five minutes. We were ready now to start  away. Derek said:    \"Whatever comes, Charlie, I want you to take care of Hope. Guard her for  me, will you?\"    I said, \"Yes, I will try to.\"    Hope smiled as she held out her hand to me. \"I will not be afraid, with  Derek's friend.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Her English was of different intonation from our own, but it was her  native language, I could not doubt.    I took her cold, slightly trembling hand. \"Thank you, Hope.\"    Her eyes were misty with starlight. Tender eyes, but the tenderness was  not for me.    \"Yes,\" I repeated. \"You can depend upon me, Derek.\"    We left the hillock. A food-laden cart came along the road. The driver,  a boy vivid in jacket and wide trousers of red and blue, bravely worn  but tattered, ran alongside guiding the oxen. When they had passed we  followed, and presently we came to the cloaks Hope had hidden. Derek and  I donned them. They were long crimson cloaks with hoods.    Hope said, \"Many are gathering for the festival shrouded like that. You  will not be noticed now.\"    Further along the road we reached a little eminence. I saw the river  ahead of us, and a river behind us. And a few miles to the south, an  open spread of water where the rivers joined. Familiar contours! The  Hudson River! The East River. And down at the end of the island, New  York Harbor.    Hope gestured that way. \"The king's palace is there.\"    We were soon passing occasional houses, primitive thatched dwellings. I  saw inside one. Workers were seated over their frugal evening meal.  Always the same vivid garments, jaunty but tattered. We passed one old  fellow in a field, working late in the starlight. A man bent with age,  but still a tiller of the soil. Hope waved to him and he responded, but  the look he gave us as we hurried by shrouded in our crimson cloaks was  sullenly hostile.    We came to an open cart. It stood by the roadside. An ox with shaggy  coat and spreading horns was fastened to the fence. It was a small cart  with small rollers like wheels. Seats were in it and a vivid canopy over  it. We climbed in and rumbled away.           *       *       *       *       *    And this starlit road in our own world was Broadway! We were presently  passing close to the river's edge. This quiet, peaceful, starlit river!  Why, in our world it was massed with docks! Great ocean liners, huge  funneled, with storied decks lay here! Under this river, tunnels with  endless passing vehicles! Tubes, with speeding trains crowded with  people!    The reality here was so different! Behind us what seemed an upper city  was strung along the river. Ahead of us also there were streets and  houses, the city of the workers. A bell was tolling. Along all the roads  now we could see the moving yellow spots of lights on the holiday carts  headed for the festival. And there were spots of yellow torchlight from  boats on the river.    We soon were entering the city streets. Narrow dirt streets they were,  with primitive shacks to the sides. Women came to the doorways to stare  at our little cart rumbling hastily past. I was conscious of my crimson  cloak, and conscious of the sullen glances of hate which were flung at  it from every side, here in this squalid, forlorn section where the  workers lived.    Along every street now the carts were passing, converging to the south.  They were filled, most of them, with young men and girls, all in gaudy  costumes. Some of them, like ourselves, were shrouded in crimson cloaks.  The carts occasionally were piled with flowers. As one larger than us,  and moving faster rumbled by, a girl in it stood up and pelted me with  blossoms. She wore a crimson robe, but it had fallen from her shoulders.  I caught a glimpse of her face, framed in flowing dark hair, and of eyes  with laughter in them, mocking me, alluring.    We came at last to the end of the island. There seemed to be a thousand  or more people arriving, or here already. The tip of the island had an  esplanade with a broad canopy behind it. Burning torches of wood gave  flames of yellow, red and blue fire. A throng of gay young people  promenaded the walk, watching the arriving boats.           *       *       *       *       *    And here, behind the walk at the water's edge, was a garden of trees and  lawn, shrubs and beds of tall vivid flowers. Nooks were here to shelter  lovers, pools of water glinted red and green with the reflected  torchlight. In one of the pools I saw a group of girls bathing,  sportive as dolphins.    To one side at a little distance up the river, banked against the water,  was a broad, low building: the palace of the king. About it were broad  gardens, with shrubs and flowers. The whole was surrounded by a high  metal fence, spiked on top.    The main gate was near at hand; we left our cart. Close to the gate was  a guard standing alert, a jaunty fellow in leather pantaloons and  leather jacket, with a spiked helmet, and in his hand a huge,  sharp-pointed lance. The gardens of the palace, what we could see of  them, seemed empty--none but the favored few might enter here. But as I  climbed from the cart, I got the impression that just inside the fence a  figure was lurking. It started away as we approached the gate. The guard  had not seen it--the drab figure of a man in what seemed to be dripping  garments, as though perhaps he had swum in from the water.    And Derek saw him. He muttered, \"They are everywhere.\"    Hope led us to the gate. The guard recognized her. At her imperious  gesture he stood aside. We passed within. I saw the palace now as a long  winged structure of timber and stone, with a high tower at the end of  one wing. The building fronted the river, but here on the garden side  there was a broad doorway up an incline, twenty feet up and over a small  bridge, spanning what seemed a dry moat. Beyond it, a small platform,  then an oval archway, the main entrance to the building.    Derek and I, shrouded in our crimson cloaks with hoods covering us to  the eyes, followed Hope into the palace.          CHAPTER VI    _The King's Henchman_      The long room was bathed in colored lights. There was an ornate tiled  floor. Barbaric draperies of heavy fabric shrouded the archways and  windows. It was a totally barbaric apartment. It might have been the  audience chamber of some fabled Eastern Prince of our early ages. Yet  not quite that either. There was a primitive modernity here. I could not  define it, could not tell why I felt this strangeness. Perhaps it was  the aspect of the people. The room was crowded with men and gay laughing  girls in fancy dress costumes. Half of them at least were shrouded in  crimson cloaks, but most of the hoods were back. They moved about,  laughing and talking, evidently waiting for the time to come for them to  go to the festival. We pushed our way through them.    Derek murmured, \"Keep your hood up, Charlie.\"    A girl plucked at me. \"Handsome man, let me see.\" She thrust her painted  lips up to mine as though daring me to kiss them. Hope shoved her away.  Her parted cloak showed her white, beautiful body with the dark tresses  of her hair shrouding it. Exotically lovely she was, with primitive,  unrestrained passions--typical of the land in which she lived.    \"This way,\" whispered Hope. \"Keep close together. Do not speak!\"    We moved forward and stood quietly against the wall of the room, where  great curtains hid us partly from view. Under a canopy, at a table on a  raised platform near one end of the apartment, sat the youthful monarch.  I saw him as a man of perhaps thirty. He was in holiday garb, robed in  silken hose of red and white, a strangely fashioned doublet, and a  close-fitting shirt. Bare-headed, with thick black hair, long to the  base of his neck.
