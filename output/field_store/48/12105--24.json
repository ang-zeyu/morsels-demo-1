[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4278"],[0,"An Introduction to Yoga (#18)"],[1,"you will  see the weariness of power, the satiety that cloys passion. Does  then God mock us with all the objects? No. The object has been to  bring out the power of the Self to develop the capacity latent in  man, and in the development of human faculty, the result of the  great lila may be seen. That is the way in which we learn to  unfold the God within us; that is the result of the play of the  divine Father with His children.    But sometimes the desire for objects is lost too early, and the  lesson is but half learned. That is one of the difficulties in  the India of today. You have a mighty spiritual philosophy, which  was the natural expression for the souls who were born centuries  ago. They were ready to throw away the fruit of action and to  work for the Supreme to carry out His Will.    But the lesson for India at the present time is to wake up the  desire. It may look like going back, but it is really a going  forward. The philosophy is true, but it belonged to those older  souls who were ready for it, and the younger souls now being born  into the people are not ready for that philosophy. They repeat it  by rote, they are hypnotised by it, and they sink down into  inertia, because there is nothing they desire enough to force  them to exertion. The consequence is that the nation as a whole  is going downhill. The old lesson of putting different objects  before souls of different ages, is forgotten, and every one is  now nominally aiming at ideal perfection, which can only be  reached when the preliminary steps have been successfully  mounted. It is the same as with the \"Sermon on the Mount\" in  Christian countries, but there the practical common sense of the  people bows to it and--ignores it. No nation tries to live by the  \"Sermon on the Mount \" It is not meant for ordinary men and  women, but for the saint. For all those who are on the Path of  Forthgoing, desire is necessary for progress.    What is the Path of Nivritti? It is the Path of Return. There  desire must cease; and the Self-determined will must take its  place. The last object of desire in a person commencing the Path  of Return is the desire to work with the Will of the Supreme; he  harmonises his will with the Supreme Will, renounces all separate  desires, and thus works to turn the wheel of life as long as such  turning is needed by the law of Life. Desire on the Path of  Forthgoing becomes will on the Path of Return; the soul, in  harmony with the Divine, works with the law. Thought on the Path  of Forthgoing is ever alert, flighty and changing; it becomes  reason on the Path of Return; the yoke of reason is placed on the  neck of the lower mind, and reason guides the bull. Work,  activity, on the Path of Forthgoing, is restless action by which  the ordinary man is bound; on the Path of Return work becomes  sacrifice, and thus its binding force is broken. These are, then,  the manifestations of three aspects, as shown on the Paths of  Forthgoing and Return.    Bliss manifested as desire is changed into will  Wisdom manifested as thought is changed into reason.  Activity  manifested as work  is changed into sacrifice.    People very often ask with regard to this: \"Why is will placed in  the human being as the correspondence of bliss in the Divine?\"  The three great Divine qualities are: chit or consciousness;  ananda or bliss; sat or existence. Now it is quite clear that the  consciousness is reflected in intelligence in man--the same  quality, only in miniature. It is equally clear that existence  and activity belong to each other. You can only exist as you act  outwards. The very form of the word shows It --\"ex, out of\"; it  is manifested life. That leaves the third, bliss, to correspond  with will, and some people are rather puzzled with that, and they  ask: \"What is the correspondence between bliss and will?\" But if  you come down to desire, and the objects of desire, you will be  able to solve the riddle. The nature of the Self is bliss. Throw  that nature down into matter and what will be the expression of  the bliss nature? Desire for happiness, the seeking after  desirable objects, which it imagines will give it the happiness  which is of its own essential nature, and which it is continually  seeking to realise amid the obstacles of the world. Its nature  being bliss, it seeks for happiness and that desire for happiness  is to be transmuted into will. All these correspondences have a  profound meaning if you will only look into them, and that  universal \"will-to-live\" translates itself as the \"desire for  happiness\" that you find in every man and woman, in every  sentient creature. Has it ever struck you how surely you are  justifying that analysis of your own nature by the way you accept  happiness as your right, and resent misery, and ask what you have  done to deserve it? You do not ask the same about happiness,  which is the natural result of your own nature. The thing that  has to be explained is not happiness but pain, the things that  are against the nature of the Self that is bliss. And so, looking  into this, we see how desire and will are both the determination  to be happy. But the one is ignorant, drawn out by outer objects;  the other is self-conscious, initiated and ruled from within.  Desire is evoked and directed from outside; and when the same  aspect rules from within, it is will. There is no difference in  their nature. Hence desire on the Path of Forthgoing becomes will  on the Path of Return.    When desire, thought and work are changed into will, reason and  sacrifice, then the man is turning homewards, then he lives by  renunciation.    When a man has really renounced, a strange change takes place. On  the Path of Forthgoing, you must fight for everything you want to  get; on the Path of Return, nature pours her treasures at your  feet. When a man has ceased to desire them, then all treasures  pour down upon him, for he has become a channel through which all  good gifts flow to those around him. Seek the good, give up  grasping, and then everything will be yours. Cease to ask that  your own little water tank may be filled, and you will become a  pipe, joined to the living source of all waters, the source which  never runs dry, the waters which spring up unfailingly.  Renunciation means the power of unceasing work for the good of  all, work which cannot fail, because wrought by the Supreme  Worker through His servant.    If you are engaged in any true work of charity, and your means  are limited and the wealth does not flow into your hands, what  does it mean? It means that you have not yet learnt the true  renunciation. You are clinging to the visible, to the fruit of  action, and so the wealth does not pour through your hands.          Purification of Bodies        The unfolding of powers belongs to the side of consciousness;  purification of bodies belongs to the side of matter. You must  purify each of your three working bodies--mental, astral and  physical. Without that purification you had better leave yoga  alone. First of all, how shall you purify the thought body? By  right thinking. Then you must use imagination, your great  creative tool, once more. Imagine things, and, imagining them,  you will form your thought-body into the organisation that you  desire. Imagine something strongly, as the painter imagines when  he is going to paint. Visualise an object if you have the power  of visualisation at all: if you have not, try to make it. It is  an artistic faculty, of course, hut most people have it more or  less. See how far you can reproduce perfectly a face you see  daily. By such practice you will be strengthening your  imagination, and by strengthening your imagination you will be  making the great tool with which you have to practice in Yoga.    There is another use of the imagination which is very valuable.  If you will imagine in your thought-body the presence of the  qualities that you desire to have, and the absence of those which  you desire not to have, you are half-way to having and not having  them. Also, many of the troubles of your life might be weakened  if you would imagine them on right lines before you have to go  through them. Why do you wait helplessly until you meet them in  the physical world. If you thought of your coming trouble in the  morning, and thought of yourself as acting perfectly in the midst  of it (you should never scruple to imagine yourself perfect),  when the thing turned up in the day, it would have lost its  power, and you would no longer feel the sting to the same extent.  Now each of you must have in your life something that troubles  you. Think of yourself as facing that trouble and not minding it,  and when it comes, you will be what you have been thinking. You  might get rid of half your troubles and your faults, if you would  deal with them through your imagination.    As the thought body, becomes purified in this way, you must turn  to the astral body. The astral body is purified by right desire.  Desire nobly, and the astral body will evolve the organs of good  desires instead of the organs of evil ones. The secret of all  progress is to think and desire the highest, never dwelling on  the fault, the weakness, the error, but always on the perfected  power, and slowly in that way you will be able to build up  perfection in yourself. Think and desire, then, in order to  purify the thought body and the astral body.    And how shall you purify the physical body? You must regulate it  in all its activities--in sleep, in food, in exercise, in  everything. You cannot have a pure physical body with impure  mental and astral bodies so that the work of imagination helps  also in the purification of the physical. But you must also  regulate the physical body in all its activities. Take for  instance, food. The Indian says truly that every sort of food has  a dominant quality in it, either rhythm, or activity, or inertia,  and that all foods fall"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4294"],[0,"Tales of Aztlan; The Romance of a Hero of Our Late Spanish-American War, (#18)"],[1,"he realizes now how degraded and unhappy I must feel with my  last year's gowns and made-over millinery--and your poor sister's  ancient bonnets, I dare not look at them any longer!\"    \"But papa has a coat,\" I said, \"a royal Prince Albert!\"    \"True,\" answered mother, \"but it has no swallow's tails!\"    \"A Prince Albert has no swallow-tails?\" I gasped wonderingly; \"but it  has great, long tails, surely!\"    \"Oh, now I see,\" an idea flashing through my mind; \"it has cock-tails,  has it, mamma, and it can't swallow them, can it, mamma?\"    \"Oh my, oh my!\" screamed mother, \"you are the funniest little chap to  ask me questions. Go, ask pussy!\"    Then I went into the back yard to interview my favorite playmate, our  big, black tomcat, and aroused him from his cat nap. But he blinked  sleepily only, saying nothing.    However, speech was not to be denied me in that manner, for I held the  combination which unlocks the portals of silence. I gave the handle a  double twist and he spat and spluttered: \"Sh--sh--sht--t--t!\"    As may be imagined, my father passed a sleepless night in the solitude  of his studio. He wrestled with a host of demons and made a good fight  of it; for finally in the small hours of morning he overcame the evil  spirit of worldly ambition and with true Christian humility, his soul  purified by vanquished temptation, resigned himself unreservedly, good  man that he was, to the mandate of a cruel fate. He began to write his  sermon for the Sabbath, and being spiritually chastened and  battle-sore, naturally his thoughts dwelt on melancholy topics.  Therefore, he took the text of his sermon from the Lamentations of  Jeremiah, chapter 3, v. I:    \"I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of His wrath.\"    It may be stated here that on the next Sabbath, from \"firstly\" to  \"seventhly\" for two long hours father pondered over the uncertainties  of earthly life, and that on this occasion he delivered the most  effective sermon of his pastoral career.    When father had written his sermon he resumed work on an unfinished  volume of historical sketches which he prepared for future publication.    Meantime mother, who was busy with a pleasanter task was  correspondingly cheerful. She altered father's \"Prince Albert\" into a  stately full-dress coat, ripping up its waist-seams, and pinned back  the skirts of the coat into the proper claw-hammer shape.    Then she took that other garment which goes with the long waistcoat and  the full-dress coat of a courtier's suit, in hand.    This article had not been mentioned before by anyone, as there was a  goodly supply of it known to be in mother's wardrobe. Deftly cutting  the lace away, a few inches above the knees she placed some  mother-of-pearl buttons and bows of ribbons and with few stitches  fashioned a beautiful pair of courtier's small clothes, or  knickerbockers, for father's use.    Father had begun a description of the battle of Waterloo, for nothing  so touched a responsive chord in his mind as the recording of a most  fearful catastrophe, the direst calamity known to history, nor served  as well to alleviate by comparison his mind's distress and  mortification.    Just as he wrote the sentence, \"Alas for Napoleon, here set his lucky  star; not only was his misfortune repeated, but also his final downfall  accomplished when Blucher's tardy cavalry appeared on the field,  turning the tide of battle in favor of the British\"--in came mother  with happy, triumphant laughter, unfolding and flaunting to the breeze  the so anxiously wished-for full-dress suit.    \"Julia, darling, you have saved the day, oh you are so clever,\" shouted  father, joyfully embracing her; \"but I say!\" he exclaimed in startled  surprise, \"where on earth did you get this--er--trousseau? Do you  really think I shall need those?\"    \"Yes, indeed you shall, dearest, when you are going to court,\" replied  mother. \"Here you have everything needed except the silken hose which  you must buy.\"    \"But you have a plenty of long-limbed stockings,\" said father,  wrinkling his brow.    \"My good man, look here now!\" answered mother, bristling, \"well enough  you know that all my stockings are very old and holey!\"    \"Oh, darn them!\" growled father testily.    \"Wilhelm, do you wish the king to see my stockings then?\" cried mamma,  angrily.    \"But, my dear, you know that he can't see, as he is stone-blind,\" said  father.    \"So he is, Wilhelm, and for that very reason he could not find the  throne of England,\" snapped mother, \"but never was he blind as you to  his queenly wife's unfashionable appearance, nor was he ever deaf to  her demands for something decent to wear!\"    And mother, as always when it came to ultimate extremes, finally gained  her point, for father loved her dearly and dared not deny her.    On the following day arrived the king, for whose reception our township  had made grand preparations. Festoons of evergreen decorated the  roadway from the parsonage to the opposite house, and mother and my  sisters were stationed at our gate with an abundance of roses to strew  in the king's path.    From the steeple pealed the chimes, heralding his majesty's arrival. He  traveled in an open landau, which was drawn by six milk-white Arabian  steeds and surrounded by a select escort of young men who were his  subjects and served as his guard of honor.    They wore scarfs of the royal colors over breasts and shoulders.    A courtier sat on either side of the king for the purpose of advising  him and to direct his movements.    Poor man, he turned his sightless white eyes on us, bowing to the  ladies in acknowledgment of their curtesies and roses.    This king was very unlike his royal namesake predecessors, as he was  pitied by everyone and not envied or hated. I must confess to having  been sorely disappointed with this sight of royalty, for I thought a  king must be an extraordinary being, expecting to see a double-header,  as kings and queens are pictured on playing cards, the kings holding  scepters in their left hands and bearing a ball with their right, but I  saluted and shouted as everyone else did, and when my sisters pelted  the royal equipage with their roses I shied my cap at his majesty, at  which the people who saw this laughed as loudly as they dared in the  presence of a king. I expected also to see a military display, but  there were no soldiers present, because the king traveled \"incognito,\"  which means that it was forbidden to reveal his royal identity. He was  supposed to be a plain nobleman merely, \"Herr von Beerstein\" for  instance.    But a king, who is human after all, may wish to enjoy himself as others  do and desire to associate occasionally with ordinary people. So \"Herr  von Beerstein\" goes to a beer garden in quest of a pleasing companion  who is readily found, for he has money to burn and invests it freely.    An obliging bar-maid introduces him to her lovely cousin and they  retire to a lonely seat in the most secluded spot of the garden.    \"Herr von Beerstein\" now places his heart and purse in the keeping of  his gentle companion, who calls directly for \"zwei beers.\"    Now follows a repetition of the old, old legend that yet is always new  and ever recurring in the romance of mutual love on sight, two hearts  beating as one and in the love that laughs at locksmiths, but as the  course of true love seldom runs smooth, now with the maiden's oft  repeated calls for \"lager\" \"Herr von Beerstein\" grows by stages  sentimental, incautious and then so reckless that \"presto!\" before he  is aware of any danger to himself he has stopped Cupid's fatal dart  with his royal personal circumference. Maddened with pain he exhibits  symptoms of a most violent passion and becomes very aggressive. But the  cunning maid appeals to the protecting presence of Fritz, the waiter,  with other calls for beer, whispering in the ear of her love-lorn  swain: \"Nine, mine lieber Herr von Beerstein, ven you has married me  once alretty, nicht wahr? Ach vas, den shall you kiss me yet some more,  yaw!\"    Thus she tantalizes the poor man until he becomes desperate under the  strain of an unrequited love and as a last resort he places his hand  over his heart, bares the bosom of his shirt and exposes the insignia  of royalty, flashing the sovereign's star before her eyes. Humbly,  overcome with shame and remorse at the thought of having trifled with  her king's affections, and prompted by her pitiful exaggerated notion  of loyalty the poor thing kneels before his majesty, craving his pardon.    With royal hands the king uplifts her, graciously kissing her rosebud  mouth and when she says: \"Your majesty's slightest wish is a command to  me, your servant!\" and is about to surrender her loveliness to Cupid's  forces and temporarily lose her heart, but her soul forever--in the  very nick of time comes her guardian-angel to the rescue.    When she, poor little gray dove, lies trembling in the royal falcon's  talons a head rises up and peeps over the fence, for the royal star has  been seen through a crack between the boards, its knowing, sly grin  passing into the lusty shout:    \"Heil dem koenig, hoch, hoch!\"    An excited crowd rushes from all directions, cheering: \"Ein, zwei,  drei, hurrah!\" while a constable places the damsel under arrest,  charging her with lese majeste. When, however, his majesty intercedes  most graciously the your lady is promptly released, and restored to  freedom.    But the constable's fee that she must pay--in earthly power, not even a  king can save her from it, for that is a \"trinkgeld\" and she pays it  from the royal purse.    On the evening of the king's arrival I accompanied my father to the  castle where the reception royal took place. There were no ladies  present on this occasion. The king was, as has been said, totally  blind, but indulged in the curious habit of feigning to have an  unimpaired eye sight and pretended to admire scenic objects"]]]
