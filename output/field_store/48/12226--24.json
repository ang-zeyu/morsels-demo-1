We towed up as far as ever our boats would swim, and we went two days  the farther--having been about twelve days in this last part of the  river--by lightening the boats and taking our luggage out, which we made  the negroes carry, being willing to ease ourselves as long as we could;  but at the end of these two days, in short, there was not water enough  to swim a London wherry.    We now set forward wholly by land, and without any expectation of more  water-carriage. All our concern for more water was to be sure to have a  supply for our drinking; and therefore upon every hill that we came near  we clambered up to the highest part to see the country before us, and  to make the best judgment we could which way to go to keep the lowest  grounds, and as near some stream of water as we could.    The country held verdant, well grown with trees, and spread with rivers  and brooks, and tolerably well with inhabitants, for about thirty days'  march after our leaving the canoes, during which time things went pretty  well with us; we did not tie ourselves down when to march and when to  halt, but ordered those things as our convenience and the health and  ease of our people, as well our servants as ourselves, required.    About the middle of this march we came into a low and plain country,  in which we perceived a greater number of inhabitants than in any other  country we had gone through; but that which was worse for us, we found  them a fierce, barbarous, treacherous people, and who at first looked  upon us as robbers, and gathered themselves in numbers to attack us.    Our men were terrified at them at first, and began to discover an  unusual fear, and even our black prince seemed in a great deal of  confusion; but I smiled at him, and showing him some of our guns, I  asked him if he thought that which killed the spotted cat (for so they  called the leopard in their language) could not make a thousand of those  naked creatures die at one blow? Then he laughed, and said, yes, he  believed it would. \"Well, then,\" said I, \"tell your men not to be afraid  of these people, for we shall soon give them a taste of what we can do  if they pretend to meddle with us.\" However, we considered we were in  the middle of a vast country, and we knew not what numbers of people  and nations we might be surrounded with, and, above all, we knew not how  much we might stand in need of the friendship of these that we were now  among, so that we ordered the negroes to try all the methods they could  to make them friends.    Accordingly the two men who had gotten bows and arrows, and two more  to whom we gave the prince's two fine lances, went foremost, with five  more, having long poles in their hands; and after them ten of our men  advanced toward the negro town that was next to us, and we all stood  ready to succour them if there should be occasion.    When they came pretty near their houses our negroes hallooed in their  screaming way, and called to them as loud as they could. Upon their  calling, some of the men came out and answered, and immediately after  the whole town, men, women, and children, appeared; our negroes, with  their long poles, went forward a little, and stuck them all in the  ground, and left them, which in their country was a signal of peace, but  the other did not understand the meaning of that. Then the two men with  bows laid down their bows and arrows, went forward unarmed, and made  signs of peace to them, which at last the other began to understand; so  two of their men laid down their bows and arrows, and came towards them.  Our men made all the signs of friendship to them that they could think  of, putting their hands up to their mouths as a sign that they wanted  provisions to eat; and the other pretended to be pleased and friendly,  and went back to their fellows and talked with them a while, and they  came forward again, and made signs that they would bring some provisions  to them before the sun set; and so our men came back again very well  satisfied for that time.    But an hour before sunset our men went to them again, just in the same  posture as before, and they came according to their appointment, and  brought deer's flesh, roots, and the same kind of corn, like rice, which  I mentioned above; and our negroes, being furnished with such toys as  our cutler had contrived, gave them some of them, which they seemed  infinitely pleased with, and promised to bring more provisions the next  day.    Accordingly the next day they came again, but our men perceived they  were more in number by a great many than before. However, having sent  out ten men with firearms to stand ready, and our whole army being in  view also, we were not much surprised; nor was the treachery of the  enemy so cunningly ordered as in other cases, for they might have  surrounded our negroes, which were but nine, under a show of peace; but  when they saw our men advance almost as far as the place where they were  the day before, the rogues snatched up their bows and arrows and came  running upon our men like so many furies, at which our ten men called  to the negroes to come back to them, which they did with speed enough  at the first word, and stood all behind our men. As they fled, the other  advanced, and let fly near a hundred of their arrows at them, by which  two of our negroes were wounded, and one we thought had been killed.  When they came to the five poles that our men had stuck in the ground,  they stood still awhile, and gathering about the poles, looked at them,  and handled them, as wondering what they meant. We then, who were drawn  up behind all, sent one of our number to our ten men to bid them fire  among them while they stood so thick, and to put some small shot into  their guns besides the ordinary charge, and to tell them that we would  be up with them immediately.    Accordingly they made ready; but by the time they were ready to fire,  the black army had left their wandering about the poles, and began to  stir as if they would come on, though seeing more men stand at some  distance behind our negroes, they could not tell what to make of us;  but if they did not understand us before, they understood us less  afterwards, for as soon as ever our men found them to begin to move  forward they fired among the thickest of them, being about the distance  of 120 yards, as near as we could guess.    It is impossible to express the fright, the screaming and yelling  of those wretches upon this first volley. We killed six of them, and  wounded eleven or twelve, I mean as we knew of; for, as they stood  thick, and the small shot, as we called it, scattered among them, we had  reason to believe we wounded more that stood farther off, for our small  shot was made of bits of lead and bits of iron, heads of nails, and such  things as our diligent artificer, the cutler, helped us to.    As to those that were killed and wounded, the other frighted creatures  were under the greatest amazement in the world, to think what should  hurt them, for they could see nothing but holes made in their bodies  they knew not how. Then the fire and noise amazed all their women and  children, and frighted them out of their wits, so that they ran staring  and howling about like mad creatures.    However, all this did not make them fly, which was what we wanted, nor  did we find any of them die as it were with fear, as at first; so we  resolved upon a second volley, and then to advance as we did before.  Whereupon our reserved men advancing, we resolved to fire only three men  at a time, and move forward like an army firing in platoon; so, being  all in a line, we fired, first three on the right, then three on the  left, and so on; and every time we killed or wounded some of them, but  still they did not fly, and yet they were so frighted that they used  none of their bows and arrows, or of their lances; and we thought their  numbers increased upon our hands, particularly we thought so by the  noise. So I called to our men to halt, and bid them pour in one whole  volley and then shout, as we did in our first fight, and so run in upon  them and knock them down with our muskets.    But they were too wise for that too, for as soon as we had fired a whole  volley and shouted, they all ran away, men, women, and children, so fast  that in a few moments we could not see one creature of them except some  that were wounded and lame, who lay wallowing and screaming here and  there upon the ground as they happened to fall.    Upon this we came up to the field of battle, where we found we had  killed thirty-seven of them, among which were three women, and had  wounded about sixty-four, among which were two women; by wounded I  mean such as were so maimed as not to be able to go away, and those our  negroes killed afterwards in a cowardly manner in cold blood, for which  we were very angry, and threatened to make them go to them if they did  so again.    There was no great spoil to be got, for they were all stark naked as  they came into the world, men and women together, some of them having  feathers stuck in their hair, and others a kind of bracelet about their  necks, but nothing else; but our negroes got a booty here, which we were  very glad of, and this was the bows and arrows of the vanquished, of  which they found more than they knew what to do with, belonging to the  killed and wounded men; these we ordered them to pick up, and they  were very useful to us afterwards. After the fight, and our negroes had  gotten bows and arrows, we sent them out in parties to see what they  could get, and they got some provisions; but, which was better than all  the rest, they brought us four more young bulls, or buffaloes, that  had been brought up to labour and to carry burthens.

Elsie would have gone with her, but her father had taken her hand  again, and he held it fast.    She looked up inquiringly into his face.    \"Stay here,\" he said. \"Lucy will be down again in a moment.\"    And Elsie stood quietly at his side until Lucy returned.    But even then her father did not relinquish his hold of her hand, and  all the talking the little girls could do must be done close at his  side.    Yet, as he was engaged in earnest conversation with Mr. Carrington, and  did not seem to be listening to them, Lucy ventured to whisper to  Elsie, \"I think it's real mean of him; he might let you go.\"    \"No,\" replied Elsie, in the same low tone, \"I'm sure papa knows best;  and besides, I _have_ been naughty, and don't deserve to go, though I  should like to, dearly.\"    \"Well, good-bye,\" said Lucy, giving her a kiss.    It was not until Mr. Carrington's carriage was fairly on its way down  the avenue, that Mr. Dinsmore dropped his little girl's hand; and then  he said, \"I want you in the library, Elsie; come to me in half an hour.\"    \"Yes, papa, I will,\" she replied, looking a little frightened.    \"You need not be afraid,\" he said, in a tone of displeasure; \"I am not  going to hurt you.\"    Elsie blushed and hung her head, but made no reply, and he turned away  and left her. She could not help wondering what he wanted with her, and  though she tried not to feel afraid, it was impossible to keep from  trembling a little as she knocked at the library door.    Her father's voice said, \"Come in,\" and entering, she found him alone,  seated at a table covered with papers and writing materials, while  beside the account book in which he was writing lay a pile of money, in  bank notes, and gold and silver.    \"Here, Elsie,\" he said, laying down his pen, \"I want to give you your  month's allowance. Your grandfather has paid it to you heretofore, but  of course, now that I am at home, I attend to everything that concerns  you. You have been receiving eight dollars--I shall give you ten,\" and  he counted out the money and laid it before her as he spoke; \"but I  shall require a strict account of all that you spend. I want you to  learn to keep accounts, for if you live, you will some day have a great  deal of money to take care of; and here is a blank book that I have  prepared, so that you can do so very easily. Every time that you lay  out or give away any money, you must set it down here as soon as you  come home; be particular about that, lest you should forget something,  because you must bring your book to me at the end of every month, and  let me see how much you have spent, and what is the balance in hand;  and if you are not able to make it come out square, and tell me what  you have done with every penny, you will lose either the whole or a  part of your allowance for the next month, according to the extent of  your delinquency. Do you understand?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Very well. Let me see now how much you can remember of your last  month's expenditures. Take the book and set down everything you can  think of.\"    Elsie had a good memory, and was able to remember how she had spent  almost every cent during the time specified; and she set down one item  after another, and then added up the column without any mistake.    \"That was very well done,\" said her father approvingly. And then  running over the items half aloud, \"Candy, half a dollar; remember,  Elsie, there is to be no more money disposed of in that way; not as a  matter of economy, by any means, but because I consider is very  injurious. I am very anxious that you should grow up strong and  healthy. I would not for anything have you a miserable dyspeptic.\"    Then suddenly closing the book and handing it to her, he said,  inquiringly, \"You were very anxious to go to Ashlands?\"    \"I would have liked to go, papa, if you had been willing,\" she replied  meekly.    \"I am afraid Lucy is not a suitable companion for you, Elsie. I think  she puts bad notions into your head,\" he said very gravely.    Elsie flushed and trembled, and was just opening her lips to make her  confession, when the door opened and her grandfather entered. She could  not speak before him, and so remained silent.    \"Does she not sometimes say naughty things to you?\" asked her father,  speaking so low that her grandfather could not have heard.    \"Yes, sir,\" replied the little girl, almost under her breath.    \"I thought so,\" said he, \"and therefore I shall keep you apart as  entirely as possible; and I hope there will be no murmuring on your  part.\"    \"No, papa, you know best,\" she answered, very humbly.    Then, putting the money into her hands, he dismissed her. When she had  gone out he sat for a moment in deep thought. Elsie's list of articles  bought with her last month's allowance consisted almost entirely of  gifts for others, generally the servants. There were some beads and  sewing-silk for making a purse, and a few drawing materials; but with  the exception of the candy, she had bought nothing else for herself.  This was what her father was thinking of.    \"She is a dear, unselfish, generous little thing,\" he said to himself.  \"However, I may be mistaken; I must not allow myself to judge from only  one month. She seems submissive, too,\"--he had overheard what passed  between her and Lucy at parting--\"but perhaps that was for effect; she  probably suspected I could hear her--and she thinks me a tyrant, and  obeys from fear, not love.\"    This thought drove away all the tender feeling that had been creeping  into his heart; and when he next met his little daughter, his manner  was as cold and distant as ever, and Elsie found it impossible to  approach him with sufficient freedom to tell him what was in her heart.          CHAPTER FIFTH         \"Man is unjust, but God is just; and finally justice      Triumphs.\"                                   --LONGFELLOW'S _Evangeline_.                          \"How disappointment tracks      The steps of hope!\"                                   --MISS LANDON.      One afternoon, the next week after the Carringtons had left, the  younger members of the family, Arthur, Elsie, Walter and Enna, were  setting out to take a walk, when Elsie, seeing a gold chain depending  from the pocket of Arthur's jacket, exclaimed:    \"O Arthur! how _could_ you take grandpa's watch? _Do_ put it away, for  you will be almost sure to injure it.\"    \"Hold your tongue, Elsie; I'll do as I please,\" was the polite  rejoinder.    \"But, Arthur, you _know_ that grandpa would never let you take it. I  have often heard him say that it was very valuable, for it was seldom  that so good a one could be had at any price; and I know that he paid a  great deal for it.\"    \"Well, if he prizes it so, he needn't have left it lying on his table,  and so I'll just teach him a lesson; it's about time he learnt to be  careful.\"    \"O Arthur! do put it away,\" pleaded Elsie, \"if anything should happen  to it, what will grandpa say? I know he will be very angry, and ask us  all who did it; and you know I cannot tell a lie, and if he asks me if  it was you, I cannot say no.\"    \"Yes, I'll trust you for telling tales,\" replied Arthur, sneeringly;  \"but if you do, I'll pay you for it.\"    He ran down the avenue as he spoke, Walter and Enna following, and  Elsie slowly bringing up the rear, looking the picture of distress, for  she knew not what to do, seeing that Arthur would not listen to her  remonstrances, and, as often happened, all the older members of the  family were out, and thus there was no authority that could be appealed  to in time to prevent the mischief which she had every reason to fear  would be done. Once she thought of turning back, that she might escape  the necessity of being a witness in the case; but, remembering that her  father told her she must walk with the others that afternoon, and also  that, as she had already seen the watch in Arthur's possession, her  testimony would be sufficient to convict him even if she saw no more,  she gave up the idea, and hurried on, with the faint hope that she  might be able to induce Arthur to refrain from indulging in such sports  as would be likely to endanger the watch; or else to give it into her  charge. At any other time she would have trembled at the thought of  touching it; but now she felt so sure it would be safer with her than  with him, that she would gladly have taken the responsibility.    The walk was far from being a pleasure that afternoon; the boys ran so  fast that it quite put her out of breath to keep up with them; and then  every little while Arthur would cut some caper that made her tremble  for the watch; answering her entreaties that he would either give it  into her care or walk along quietly, with sneers and taunts, and  declarations of his determination to do just exactly as he pleased, and  not be ruled by her.    But at length, while he was in the act of climbing a tree, the watch  dropped from his pocket and fell to the ground, striking with  considerable force.    Elsie uttered a scream, and Arthur, now thoroughly frightened himself,  jumped down and picked it up.    The crystal was broken, the back dented, and how much the works were  injured they could not tell; but it had ceased to run.    \"O Arthur! see what you've done!\" exclaimed Walter.    \"What will papa say?\" said Enna; while Elsie stood pale and trembling,  not speaking a word.    \"You hush!\" exclaimed Arthur fiercely. \"I'll tell you what, if any of  you dare to tell of me, I'll make you sorry for it to the last day of  your life. Do you hear?\"    The question was addressed to Elsie in a tone of defiance.    \"Arthur,\" said she, \"grandpa will know that _somebody_ did it, and  surely you would not wish an innocent "]]]
