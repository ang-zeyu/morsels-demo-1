That increased volume of sales ought  to lessen other cost of production so much that even a considerable  increase in labor costs can be absorbed without imposing higher  prices on the consumer.    I am a firm believer in fully adequate pay for all labor.  But right  now I am most greatly concerned in increasing the pay of the  lowest-paid labor--those who are our most numerous consuming group  but who today do not make enough to maintain a decent standard of  living or to buy the food, and the clothes and the other articles  necessary to keep our factories and farms fully running.    Farsighted businessmen already understand and agree with this  policy.  They agree also that no one section of the country can  permanently benefit itself, or the rest of the country, by  maintaining standards of wages and hours far inferior to other  sections of the country.    Most businessmen, big and little, know that their government  neither wants to put them out of business nor to prevent them from  earning a decent profit.  In spite of the alarms of a few who seek  to regain control of American life, most businessmen, big and  little, know that their government is trying to make property more  secure than ever before by giving every family a real chance to  have a property stake in the nation.    Whatever danger there may be to the property and profits of the  many, if there be any danger, comes not from government's attitude  toward business but from restraints now imposed upon business by  private monopolies and financial oligarchies.  The average  businessman knows that a high cost of living is a great deterrent  to business and that business prosperity depends much upon a low  price policy which encourages the widest possible consumption.  As  one of the country's leading economists recently said, \"The  continuance of business recovery in the United States depends far  more upon business policies, business pricing policies, than it  does on anything that may be done, or not done, in Washington.\"    Our competitive system is, of course, not altogether competitive.  Anybody who buys any large quantity of manufactured goods knows  this, whether it be the government or an individual buyer.  We have  anti-trust laws, to be sure, but they have not been adequate to  check the growth of many monopolies.  Whether or not they might have  been adequate originally, interpretation by the courts and the  difficulties and delays of legal procedure have now definitely  limited their effectiveness.    We are already studying how to strengthen our anti-trust laws in  order to end monopoly--not to hurt but to free legitimate business.    I have touched briefly on these important subjects, which, taken  together, make a program for the immediate future.  To attain it,  legislation is necessary.    As we plan today for the creation of ever higher standards of  living for the people of the United States, we are aware that our  plans may be most seriously affected by events in the world outside  our borders.    By a series of trade agreements, we have been attempting to  recreate the trade of the world which plays so important a part in  our domestic prosperity; but we know that if the world outside our  borders falls into the chaos of war, world trade will be completely  disrupted.    Nor can we view with indifference the destruction of civilized  values throughout the world.  We seek peace, not only for our  generation but also for the generation of our children.    We seek for them the continuance of world civilization in order  that their American civilization may continue to be invigorated by  the achievements of civilized men and women in the rest of the  world.    I want our great democracy to be wise enough to realize that  aloofness from war is not promoted by unawareness of war.  In a  world of mutual suspicions, peace must be affirmatively reached  for.  It cannot just be wished for.  And it cannot just be waited  for.    We have now made known our willingness to attend a conference of  the parties to the Nine Power Treaty of 1922--the Treaty of  Washington--of which we are one of the original signatories.  The  purpose of this conference will be to seek by agreement a solution  of the present situation in China.  In efforts to find that  solution, it is our purpose to cooperate with the other signatories  to this Treaty, including China and Japan.    Such cooperation would be an example of one of the possible paths  to follow in our search for means toward peace throughout the whole  world.    The development of civilization and of human welfare is based on  the acceptance by individuals of certain fundamental decencies in  their relations with each other.  The development of peace in the  world is dependent similarly on the acceptance by nations of  certain fundamental decencies in their relations with each other.    Ultimately, I hope _each_ nation will accept the fact that  violations of these rules of conduct are an injury to the well-  being of _all_ nations.    Meanwhile, remember that from 1913 to 1921, I personally was fairly  close to world events, and in that period, while I learned much of  what to do, I also learned much of what _not_ to do.    The common sense, the intelligence of America agree with my  statement that \"America hates war.  America hopes for peace.  Therefore, America actively engages in the search for peace.\"        April 14, 1938.      My Friends:    Five months have gone by since I last spoke to the people of the  nation about the state of the nation.    I had hoped to be able to defer this talk until next week because,  as we all know, this is Holy Week.  But what I want to say to you,  the people of the country, is of such immediate need and relates so  closely to the lives of human beings and the prevention of human  suffering that I have felt that there should be no delay.  In this  decision I have been strengthened by the thought that by speaking  tonight there may be greater peace of mind and that the hope of  Easter may be more real at firesides everywhere, and therefore that  it is not inappropriate to encourage peace when so many of us are  thinking of the Prince of Peace.    Five years ago we faced a very serious problem of economic and  social recovery.  For four and a half years that recovery proceeded  apace.  It is only in the past seven months that it has received a  visible setback.    And it is only within the past two months, as we have waited  patiently to see whether the forces of business itself would  counteract it, that it has become apparent that government itself  can no longer safely fail to take aggressive government steps to  meet it.    This recession has not returned us the disasters and suffering of  the beginning of 1933.  Your money in the bank is safe; farmers are  no longer in deep distress and have greater purchasing power;  dangers of security speculation have been minimized; national  income is almost 50 percent higher than in 1932; and government has  an established and accepted responsibility for relief.    But I know that many of you have lost your jobs or have seen your  friends or members of your families lose their jobs, and I do not  propose that the government shall pretend not to see these things.  I know that the effect of our present difficulties has been uneven;  that they have affected some groups and some localities seriously,  but that they have been scarcely felt in others.  But I conceive the  first duty of government is to protect the economic welfare of all  the people in all sections and in all groups.  I said in my message  opening the last session of the Congress that if private enterprise  did not provide jobs this spring, government would take up the  slack--that I would not let the people down.  We have all learned  the lesson that government cannot afford to wait until it has lost  the power to act.    Therefore, my friends, I have sent a message of far-reaching  importance to the Congress.  I want to read to you tonight certain  passages from that message, and to talk with you about them.    In that message I analyzed the causes of the collapse of 1929 in  these words: \"over-speculation in and overproduction of practically  every article or instrument used by man. . . millions of people, to  be sure, had been put to work, but the products of their hands had  exceeded the purchasing power of their pocketbooks. . . .  Under the  inexorable law of supply and demand, supplies so overran demand  which would pay that production was compelled to stop.  Unemployment  and closed factories resulted.  Hence the tragic years from 1929 to  1933.\"    I pointed out to the Congress that the national income--not the  government's income but the total of the income of all the  individual citizens and families of the United States--every  farmer, every worker, every banker, every professional man and  every person who lived on income derived from investments--that  national income had amounted, in the year 1929, to eighty-one  billion dollars.  By 1932 this had fallen to thirty-eight billion  dollars.  Gradually, and up to a few months ago, it had risen to a  total, an annual total; of sixty-eight billion dollars--a pretty  good come-back from the low point.    I then said this to the Congress:    \"But the very vigor of the recovery in both durable goods and  consumers' goods brought into the picture early in certain highly  undesirable practices, which were in large part responsible for the  economic decline which began in the later months of that year.  Again production outran the ability to buy.    \"There were many reasons for this overproduction.  One of them was  fear--fear of war abroad, fear of inflation, fear of nation-wide  strikes.  None of these fears have been borne out.    \". . .Production in many important lines of goods outran the  ability of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5770"],[0,"The Rover Boys in the Jungle; Or, Stirring Adventures in Africa (#18)"],[1,"as best you can--and we'll see  what we will see.\"    \"And let us get along just as fast as we can,\" added Sam.    On they went through a forest that in spots was so thick they  could scarcely pass.  The jungle contained every kind of tropical  growth, including ferns, which were beautiful beyond description,  and tiny vines so wiry that they cut like a knife.    \"This is tough,\" remarked Sam.  \"But I suppose it doesn't hold a  candle to what is beyond.\"    \"Werry bad further on,\" answered Cujo.  \"See, here am de trail,\"  and he pointed it out.    Several miles were covered, when they came to a halt in order to  rest and to give Aleck a let up in carrying Tom.  The youth now  declared his foot felt much better and hobbled along for some  distance by leaning on Sam's shoulder.    Presently they were startled by hearing a cry from a distance.  They listened intently, then Cujo held up his hand.    \"Me go an' see about dat,\" he said.  \"Keep out ob sight, all ob  you!\"  And he glided into the bushes with the skill and silence of  a snake.    Another wait ensued, and Tom improved the time by again bathing  his foot in a pool which was discovered not far from where Cujo  had left them.  The water seemed to do much good, and the youth  declared that by the morrow he reckoned he would be able to do a  fair amount of walking if they did not progress too rapidly.    \"But what a country this is!\" he murmured.  \"I declare they could burn wood night and day for a century and  never miss a stick.\"    \"I thought I heard some monkeys chattering a while ago,\" answered  Sam.  \"I suppose the interior is alive with them.\"    \"I dun see a monkey lookin' at us now, from dat tree,\" observed  Aleck.  \"See dem shinin' eyes back ob de leaves?\"  He pointed with  his long forefinger, and both, boys gazed in the direction.  Then  Tom gave a yell.    \"A monkey?  That's a snake!  Look out for yourselves!\"    He started back and the others did the same.  And they were none  too soon, for an instant later the leaves were thrust apart and a  serpent's form appeared, swaying slowly to and fro, as if  contemplating a drop upon their very heads!          CHAPTER XX    THE FIGHT AT THE OLD FORT      For the instant after the serpent appeared nobody spoke or moved.  The waving motion of the reptile was fascinating to the last  degree, as was also that beady stare from its glittering eyes.  The stare was fixed upon poor Tom, and having retreated but a few  feet, he now stood as though rooted to the spot.  Slowly the form  of the snake was lowered, until only the end of its tail kept it  up on the tree branch.  Then the head and neck began to swing back  and forth, in a straight line with Tom's face.    The horrible fascination held the poor, boy as by a spell, and he  could do nothing but look at those eyes, which seemed to bum  themselves upon his very brain.  Closer and closer, and still  closer, they came to his face, until at last the reptile prepared  to strike.    Crack!  It was Sam's pistol that spoke up, at just the right  instant, and those beady eyes were ruined forever, and the wounded  head twisted in every direction, while the body of the serpent,  dropping from the tree, lashed and dashed hither and thither in  its agony.  Then the spell was broken, and Tom let out such a yell  of terror as had never before issued from his lips.    Crack! came a second shot from Sam's pistol.  But the serpent was  moving around too rapidly for a good aim to be taken, and only the  tip of the tail was struck. Then, in a mad, blind fashion, the  snake coiled itself upon Aleck's foot, and began, with  lightning-like rapidity, to encircle the colored man's body.    \"Help!\" shrieked Aleck, trying to pull the snake off with his  hands.  \"Help! or Ise a dead man, shuah!\"    \"Catch him by the neck, Aleck!\" ejaculated Tom, and brought out  his own pistol.  Watching his chance, he pulled the trigger twice,  sending both bullets straight through the reptile's body.  Then  Sam fired again, and the mangled head fell to the ground.    But dead or alive the body still encircled Aleck, and the  contraction threatened to cave in the colored man's ribs.    \"Pull him off somehow!\" he gasped.  \"Pull him off!\"    Crack! went Tom's pistol once more, and now the snake had  evidently had enough of it, for it uncoiled slowly and fell to the  ground in a heap, where it slowly shifted from one spot to another  until life was extinct.  But neither the boys nor the colored man  waited to see if it was really dead.  Instead, they took to their  heels and kept on running until the locality was left a  considerable distance behind.    \"That was a close shave,\" said Tom, as he dropped on the ground  and began to nurse his lame ankle once more.  \"Ugh! but that snake  was enough to give one the nightmare!\"    \"Don't say a word,\" groaned Aleck, who had actually turned pale.  \"I vought shuah I was a goner, I did fo' a fac'!  I don't want to  meet no mo' snakes!\"    The two boys reloaded their pistols with all rapidity, and this  was scarcely accomplished when they heard Cujo calling to them.  Soon the native put in an appearance.  When told of what had  happened he would not believe the tale until he had gone back to  look at the dead snake.    \"You werry lucky,\" he said.  \"Him big wonder um snake didn't kill  all of yo'!\"    Cujo had made an important discovery.  He had located Captain  Villaire's party at the old fort, and said that several French  brigands were on guard, by the trail leading from the swamp and at  the cliff overlooking the river.    \"I see white boy dare too,\" he added.  \"Same boy wot yo' give  money to in Boma.\"    \"Dan Baxter!\" ejaculated Sam.  \"Can it be possible that he is  mixed up in this affair?\"    \"I can't understand it at all,\" returned Tom.  \"But the question  is, now we have tracked the rascals, what is to be done next?\"    After a long talk it was resolved to get as close to the old fort  as possible.  Cujo said they need not hurry, for it would be best  to wait until nightfall before making any demonstration against  their enemies.  The African was very angry to think that the other  natives had deserted the party, but this anger availed them  nothing.    Four o'clock in the afternoon found them on the edge of the swamp  and not far from the bank of the Congo.  Beyond was the cliff,  overgrown in every part with rank vegetation, and the ever-present  vines, which hung down like so many ropes of green.    \"If we want to get up the wall we won't want any scaling ladders,\"  remarked Tom grimly.  \"Oh, if only we knew that Dick and Uncle  Randolph were safe!\"    \"I'm going to find out pretty soon,\" replied Sam.  \"I'll tell you  what I think.  I think they are being held for ransom.\"    \"I was thinking of that, too.  But I didn't dream of such a thing  being done down here although, I know it is done further north in  Africa among the Moors and Algerians.\"    Cujo now went off on another scout and did not return until the  sun was setting. Again he was full of smiles.    \"I can show you a way up de rocks,\" he said.  \"We can get to the  walls of um fort, as you call um, without being seen.\"    Soon night was upon them, for in the tropics there is rarely any  twilight.  Tom now declared himself able to walk once more, and  they moved off silently, like so many shadows, beside the swamp  and then over a fallen palm to where a series of rocks, led up to  the cliff proper.    \"Sh-ah!\" came presently from Cujo.  \"Man ahead!\"    They came to a halt, and through the gloom saw a solitary figure  sitting on a rock.  The sentinel held a gun over his knees and was  smoking a cigarette.    \"If he sees us he will give the alarm,\" whispered Tom.  \"Can't we  capture him without making a noise?\"    \"Dat's de talk,\" returned Aleck.  \"Cujo, let us dun try dat  trick.\"    Cujo nodded.  \"Urn boys stay here,\" he said.  \"Cujo fix dat  feller!\"    And off he crawled through the wet grass, taking a circuitous  route which brought him up on the sentinel's left.    Presently the sentinel started to rise.  As he did so Cujo leaped  from the grass and threw him to the earth.  Then a long knife  flashed in the air.  \"No speak, or um diet\" came softly; but, the  Frenchman realized that the African meant what he said.    \"I will be silent!\" he growled, in the language of the African.  \"Don't--don't choke me.\"    Cujo let out a low whistle, which the others rightly guessed was a  signal for them to come up.  Finding himself surrounded, the  Frenchman gave up his gun and other weapons without a struggle.  He could talk no English, so what followed had to be translated by  Cujo.    \"Yes, de man an' boy are dare,\" explained Cujo, pointing to the  fort.  \"Da chained up, so dis rascal say.  De captain ob de band  want heap money to let um go.\"    \"Ask him how many of the band there are,\" asked Sam.    But at this question the Frenchman shook his head.  Either he did  not know or would not tell.    After a consultation the rascal was made to march back to safer  ground.  Then he was strapped to a tree and gagged. The straps  were not fastened very tightly, so that the man was sure to gain  his liberty sooner or later.  \"If we didn't come back and he was  too tight he might starve to death,\" said Tom.    \"Not but wot he deserves to starve,\" said Aleck, with a scowl at  the crestfallen prisoner.    At the foot of the cliff all was as dark and silent as a tomb.  \"We go slow now, or maybe take a big tumble,\" cautioned Cujo.  \"Perhaps him better if me climb up first,\" and he began the  dangerous ascent of the cliff by means of the numerous vines  already mentioned.    He was halfway up when the others started after him, Sam first,  Tom next, and Aleck bringing up in the rear.    Slowly they arose until the surface of the stream was a score or  more of feet below them.  Then came the sounds of footsteps from  above and suddenly a torch shone down into their upturned faces.    \"Hullo, who's this?\""]]]
