My sorrow was great  to see so many of our brethren there sick and dying, in consequence of  being driven and exposed to hunger and cold.    Brother Lyman Wight took us in a one-horse wagon to Brother Charles C.  Rich's, at Burton; where we stayed through the night. Brother Wight  predicted many good things, and left this blessing with us, when he  bade us farewell.    The following day while Brother Rich was taking us to Brother Wilbur's,  the chills came on me again, and I suffered much pain and fatigue.    On the 27th, Brother Wilbur took us in a buggy about twenty-five miles  to the house of James Allred, in Pittsfield, and the following day  Father Allred conveyed us to the place where Brother Harlow Redfield  lived, where we preached to a small branch of the Church on Sunday, the  29th.    On the 30th, Brother Rodgers carried Brother Brigham to Brother  Decker's, and me to the house of Mr. Roswell Murray, my father-in-law.  They were living within a few rods of each other, near Winchester, in  Scott County.    Here we also found a few brethren in the Church, who had been smitten  and robbed of their property in Missouri, but were once more in  comfortable circumstances and rejoicing in the Lord.    On the 1st of October, we were conveyed to Lorenzo D. Young's, where we  remained and recruited our strength until the 4th, when he conveyed us  to Jacksonville.    On the 5th, a sister in the Church hired a horse and buggy to take us  to Springfield, a distance of thirty-five miles, and Brother Babcock  drove for us. There we were kindly received by brethren, and nursed.  Brother Brigham being confined to his bed by sickness, Brother Libeus  T. Coon, who was practicing medicine, waited upon him. Here we found  Brothers G. A. Smith, T. Turley and R. Hedlock.    I went from house to house strengthening and comforting the brethren,  and teaching them the things of the kingdom. I was so far recovered  that I preached on the Sabbath, which caused a great feeling of love  towards us. The Saints got a two horse wagon and harness for us, for  which they paid fifty-five dollars, and also collected thirty-five  dollars in money for the company. Judge Adams, of the supreme court,  took me to his house. I stayed with him three nights and the greater  part of three days, and he gave me five dollars when I left.    While we remained at Springfield, the sisters fitted up a bed in the  wagon for Brother Brigham to ride on, as he was unable to sit up.    On the 11th of October, I resumed my journey, in company with Brothers  Young, Turley, Smith and Hedlock.    We traveled eight miles and put up at the house of Father Draper.  When we went into the house, Brother George A. Smith, while stooping  down to warm at the fire, dropped a small flask bottle, containing  tonic bitters, out of his pocket on the hearth, and broke it. At this  occurrence, Father Draper was very much astonished, and said, \"You are  a pretty set of Apostles, to be carrying a bottle of whisky with you!\"    We explained to him that the bottle contained some bitters which the  brethren at Springfield had prepared for Brother George A., because of  his sickness. This appeased his righteous soul, so that he consented to  allow us to stay through the night.    On the following day, we pursued our journey towards Terre Haute, most  of the brethren being very sick. Owing to the bad roads, I walked most  of the way. At might I slept in a wagon and caught cold. The next  morning I had to go till twelve o'clock before I had anything to eat,  and then it was transparent pork and corn dodger. My health again began  to fail. The wagon broke down twice and the chills came on me about two  in the afternoon and held me till night, then the fever held me all  night. I had the chills and fever three days, and lost my appetite. The  third chill was so severe that it seemed as though I could not live  till night.    We arrived at Terre Haute about dusk on the 17th. Brother Young and I  put up at Dr. Modisett's, and the other brethren and Father Murray,  my father-in-law, who had accompanied us on a visit to his friends in  the east, stayed at Milton Stowe's, who lived in one of the doctor's  houses. In the evening the doctor went to see them, as they were quite  ill, and Brother Stowe was very poor. The doctor expressed great  sympathy for them when he returned to his house, * * seeing them in ill  health and lying on a straw bed on the floor. He shed many tears at  thoughts of the brethren going under such suffering circumstances upon  such a long mission; but he did not have quite sympathy enough to buy  them a chicken to make them some broth, or even give them a shilling,  although he was worth four or five hundred thousand dollars. He said  his taxes amounted to over four hundred dollars a year.    In the evening I became very ill. The doctor said he could give me  something that would do me good and relieve me of my distress, and I  would probably get a nap; but the old man was so drunk that he did  not know what he did, and he gave me a table-spoonfull of morphine.  His wife saw him pour it out; but dared not say a word, although she  believed it would kill me.    In a few minutes after I took it, I straightened up in my chair,  complaining of feeling very strangely, and as though I wanted to lie  down. On my attempting to go to the bed, I reeled and fell to the  floor. There was hardly a breath of life in my body. Brother Brigham  rolled me over on my back, put a pillow under my head and inquired of  the doctor what he had given me, and then learned that he had given me  morphine. I lay there for a long time; when I came to, Brother Brigham  was attending to me with a fatherly care, and manifesting much anxiety  in my behalf. I remarked, \"Don't be scared; for I shan't die.\"    In a short time after, he got me on the bed, and nursed me through  the night. I commenced vomiting and continued doing so most of the  night. He changed my under-clothes five times, and washed me each  time previous to changing, as I was covered with a cold sweat. It was  through the closest attention of Brother Young and the family that my  life was preserved through the night. I was scarcely able to speak so  as to be understood.    In the morning, Brothers Smith, Turley, Hedlock and Father Murray came  to see us, and the brethren laid their hands upon me and prayed for  me. When they left they wept like children. Father Murray felt very  sorrowful. Said he, \"We shall never see Heber again; he will die.\"  I looked up at them and said, \"Never mind, brethren; go ahead, for  Brother Brigham and I will reach Kirtland before you will.\" Brother  Brigham gave them all the money we had except five dollars, and told  them to take good care of the team and make all possible speed to  Kirtland. They started the same day. In about an hour after their  departure I arose from my bed.        CHAPTER XVI.

On the 22nd of October, Elder Almon W. Babbitt and Dr. Knight, an  eminent physician, came from Pleasant Garden to see me, and the next  day Brother James Modisett took us in his father's carriage twenty  miles, to the house of Brother Addison Pratt. From there we were  conveyed by Dr. Knight to Pleasant Garden, and put up with Brother  Jonathan Crosby. We found a few brethren there, who were well and in  good spirits. We remained three days, preaching to the few brethren and  those who wished to hear. * * *    Before leaving, Dr. Knight and some others gave us some money to  assist us on our mission. While there I also received a letter from my  wife, giving an account of her sickness since I left, also that of our  children, William and Helen. I wrote her a comforting letter in reply,  praying the Lord to bless her and the little ones.    On the 26th, Brother Babbitt took us in his buggy twelve miles, to the  house of Brother Scott, whose family was very glad to see us, and we  tarried with them through the night, after which Brother Scott sent his  little son, John, to convey us to Bellville, fifteen miles, several  miles of the journey in a rain storm, which obliged us to put up at  an inn for the remainder of the day and night. Brother Brigham was  very sick, and had to go to bed. I sat up to wait upon him, and spent  the evening with the landlord and his lady, preaching to them. They  received our testimony, and were very kind to us.    The following morning the landlord arose very early, and talked to  the citizens about the travelers who had stayed with him the night  previous, and what he had heard us say concerning the gospel. The  neighbors flocked in; made many enquiries and were very anxious that we  should tarry and preach in the place.    Our host said several times he hoped the stage would not come, that we  might stay and preach, as the people were very much excited on account  of a great discussion which had recently occurred between two popular  preachers.    The stage, however, came along about ten o'clock, and we started on our  way towards Kirtland, leaving the landlord in tears.    The money given to us in Pleasant Garden added to the five dollars we  had left when the brethren parted from us on the 18th, amounted to  thirteen dollars and fifty cents. When we got into the stage we did not  expect to ride many miles. We rode, however, as far as Indianapolis,  paid our passage, and found we had sufficient means to carry us to  Richmond, Indiana. When we arrived in Richmond, we found we had means  to take us to Dayton, to which place we proceeded and tarried over  night, waiting for another line of stages. We expected to stop here  and preach until we got means to pursue our journey.

The conclusion, therefore, is still the same, namely that judicial  repression, in France and Italy, has grown stronger and stronger,  whilst criminality has increased more and more.    In this fact, again, which confutes the common opinion that the  sovereign remedy of crime is the greater rigour of punishment, we  may fairly find a positive proof that the penal, legislative, and  administrative systems hitherto adopted have missed their aim,  which can be nothing else than the defence of society against  criminals.    Henceforth we must seek, through the study of <p 92>facts, a  better direction for penal legislation as a function of society,  so that, by the observation of psychological and sociological  laws, it may tend, not to a violent and always tardy reaction  against crime already evolved, but to the elimination or diversion  of its natural factors.      This fundamental conclusion of criminal statistics is so important  that we must confirm it by adding to the statistical data the  general laws of biology and sociology.  This is the more necessary  because my position as first stated has met with some criticism.    In the first place, it is easily seen, when we compare the total  result of crime with the varied character of its anthropological,  physical, and social factors, that punishment can exert but a  slight influence upon it.  Punishment, in fact, by its special  effect as a legal deterrent, acting as a psychological motive,  will clearly be unable to neutralise the constant and hereditary  action of climate, customs, increase of population, agricultural  production, economic and political crises, which statistics  invariably exhibit as the most potent factors of the growth or  diminution of criminality.    It is a natural law that forces cannot conflict or neutralise each  other unless they are of the same kind.  The fall of a body cannot  be retarded, changed in direction or accelerated, save by a force  homogeneous with that of gravity.  So punishment, as a  psychological motive, can only oppose the psychological factors of  crime, and indeed only the occasional and moderately energetic  factors; for it is <p 93>evident that it cannot, as a preliminary  to its application, eliminate the organic hereditary factors which  are revealed to us by criminal anthropology.    Punishment, which has professed to be such a simple and powerful  remedy against all the factors of crime, is therefore a panacea  whose potency is far beneath its reputation.    We must bear in mind a fact which is familiar enough, though it  has been too often forgotten by legislators and criminalists.  Society is not a homogeneous aggregate, but on the contrary an  organism, like every animal organism, composed of tissues of  varying structure and sensibility.  Every society, in fact, with  its progressive and increasingly distinctive needs and  occupations, is a product of the union of social classes which  differ greatly in their organic and psychical characteristics.  The physical constitution, the habits, sentiments, ideas, and  tendencies of one social stratum are far from being the same as  those of other strata.  Here again we have, as Spencer would say,  the law of evolution through a departure from the homogeneous to  the heterogeneous, from the simple to the complex, or, in the  words of Ardigo, a natural formation by successive distinctions.  Amongst savage tribes this distinction of the social strata does  not exist, or it is far less marked than in barbarian societies,  and still less than in civilised societies.    Every schoolmaster with a bent for psychological observation  separates his pupils into three classes.  There is the class of  industrious pupils of good disposition, who work of their own  accord, without <p 94>calling for strict discipline; that of the  ignorant and idle (degenerate and of weak nervous force) from whom  neither mildness nor severity can obtain anything worth having;  and that of the pupils who are neither wholly industrious nor  wholly idle, and for whom a discipline based on psychological laws  may be genuinely useful.    This is the case with large bodies of soldiers or of prisoners,  for all associations of men, and for society as a whole.  These  partial organisms, due to the constant relationships of a life  more or less in common, are in this respect reproductions of  society as a whole, just as a fragment of crystal reproduces the  characteristics of the unbroken crystal.[13]        [13] There is, however, some difference between the manifestation  of the activity of a group of men and that of the aggregate  society.  Between psychology which studies the individual, and  sociology which studies the society, I think there is room for a  _collective psychology_, to study more or less defined groups.  The phenomena of these groups are analogous, but not identical  with those of the sociological body properly so called, according  as the union is more or less definite.  Collective psychology has  its field of observation in all unions, however occasional, such  as the public street, the markets, workshops, theatres meetings,  assemblies, colleges, schools, barracks, prisons, and so forth.  Many practical applications of the data of collective psychology  might be given.  An example will be found in a future chapter,  when I come to consider the psychology of the jury.        In the same way, from the standpoint of criminal sociology, we may  divide the social strata into three analogous categories--the  highest, which commits no crimes, organically upright, restrained  only by the authority of the moral sense, of religious sentiments  and public opinion, together with the hereditary transmission of  moral habits.  This class, for which no penal code would be  necessary, is unfortunately very small; and it is far smaller if,  in <p 95>addition to legal and apparent criminality, we also take  into account that social and latent criminality through which many  men, who are upright so far as the penal code is concerned, are  not upright by the standard of morality.    Another class, the lowest, is made up of individuals opposed to  all sense of uprightness, who, being without education,  perpetually dragged back by their material and moral destitution  into the primitive forms of the brute struggle for existence,  inherit from their parents and transmit to their children an  abnormal organisation, adding degeneration and disease, an  atavistic return to savage humanity.  This is the nursery of the  born criminals, for whom punishments, so far as they are legal  deterrents, are useless, because they encounter no moral sense  which could distinguish punishment by law from the risk which also  attends upon every honest industry.    Lastly we have the other class of individuals who are not born to  crime, but are not firmly upright, alternating between vice and  virtue, with imperfect moral sense, education and training, for  whom punishment may be genuinely useful as a psychological motive.  It is just this class which yields the large contingent of  occasional criminals, for whom punishments are efficacious if they  are directed in their execution by the axioms of scientific  psychology, and especially if they are aided by the social  prevention which reduces the number of opportunities of committing  crimes and offences.    Once again I must express my agreement with M. Garofalo, who, in  dealing with this subject, <p 96>insists on the necessity of  distinguishing between the different classes of criminals before  deciding as to the efficacy of punishments.    Yet this conclusion as to the very limited efficiency of  punishments, which is forced upon us by facts, and which, as  Bentham said, is confirmed by the application of each punitive  act, precisely because its previous application did not succeed in  preventing crime, is directly opposed to general public opinion,  and even to the opinion of jurists and legislators.    On the inception or the growth of a criminal manifestation,  legislators, jurists, and public think only of the remedies, which  are as easy as they are illusory, of the penal code, or of some  new Act of repression.  Even if this were useful, which is very  problematical, it has the inevitable disadvantage of making men  ignore other remedies, far more profitable, albeit more difficult,  of a preventive and social kind.  And this tendency is so common  that many of those who have dwelt upon or accepted the positive  movement of the new school,"]]]
