In 1070 King Malcolm had invaded northern England, but without  results beyond laying waste other portions of that afflicted country. It  was easier to show the Scots than the Danes that William was capable of  striking back, and in 1072, after a brief visit to Normandy, an army  under the king's command advanced along the east coast with an  accompanying fleet. No attempt was made to check this invasion in the  field, and only when William had reached Abernethy did Malcolm come to  meet him. What arrangement was made between them it is impossible to say,  but it was one that was satisfactory to William at the time. Probably  Malcolm became his vassal and gave him hostages for his good conduct, but  if so, his allegiance did not bind him very securely. Norman feudalism  was no more successful than the ordinary type, in dealing with a reigning  sovereign who was in vassal relations.    The critical years of William's conquest of England had been undisturbed  by any dangers threatening his continental possessions. Matilda, who  spent most of the time in Normandy, with her councillors, had maintained  peace and order with little difficulty; but in the year after his  Scottish expedition he was called to Normandy by a revolt in his early  conquest, the county of Maine, which it required a formidable campaign to  subdue. William's plan to attach this important province to Normandy by a  marriage between his son Robert and the youngest sister of the last count  had failed through the death of the proposed heiress, and the county had  risen in favour of her elder sister, the wife of the Italian Marquis Azo  or of her son. Then a successful communal revolution had occurred in the  city of Le Mans, anticipating an age of rebellion against the feudal  powers, and the effort of the commune to bring the whole county into  alliance with itself, though nearly successful for the moment at least,  had really prepared the way for the restoration of the Norman power by  dividing the party opposed to it. William crossed to Normandy in 1073,  leading a considerable army composed in part of English. The campaign was  a short one. Revolt was punished, as William sometimes punished it, by  barbarously devastating the country. Le Mans did not venture to stand a  siege, but surrendered on William's sworn promise to respect its ancient  liberty. By a later treaty with Fulk of Anjou, Robert was recognized as  Count of Maine, but as a vassal of Anjou and not of Normandy.    William probably returned to England after the settlement of these  affairs, but of his doings there nothing is recorded, and for some time  troubles in his continental dominions occupied more of his attention than  the interests of the island. He was in Normandy, indeed, during the whole  of that \"most severe tempest,\" as a writer of the next generation called  it, which broke upon a part of England in the year 1075; and the first  feudal insurrection in English history was put down, as more serious ones  were destined to be before the fall of feudalism, by the king's officers  and the men of the land in the king's absence. To determine the causes of  this insurrection, we need to read between the lines of the story as it  is told us by the writers of that and the next age. Elaborate reasons for  their hostility to William's government were put into the mouths of the  conspirators by one of these writers, but these would mean nothing more  than a general statement that the king was a very severe and stern ruler,  if it were not for the more specific accusation that he had rewarded  those who had fought for him very inadequately, and through avarice had  afterward reduced the value even of these gifts.[10] A passage in a letter  of Lanfranc's to one of the leaders of the rebellion, Roger, Earl of  Hereford, written evidently after Roger's dissatisfaction had become known  but before any open rebellion, gives us perhaps a key to the last part of  this complaint.[11] He tells him that the king, revoking, we infer, former  orders, has directed his sheriffs not to hold any more pleas in the earl's  land until he can return and hear the case between him and the sheriffs.  In a time when the profits of a law court were important to the lord who  had the right to hold it, the entry of the king's officers into a  \"liberty\" to hear cases there as the representative of the king, and to  his profit, would naturally seem to the baron whose income was affected a  diminution of the value of his fief, due to the king's avarice. Nothing  could show us better the attitude natural to a strong king towards feudal  immunities than the facts which these words of Lanfranc's imply, and  though we know of no serious trouble arising from this reason for a  century or more, it is clear that the royal view of the matter never  changed, and finally like infringements on the baronial courts became one  of the causes of the first great advance towards constitutional liberty,  the Magna Carta.    This letter of Lanfranc's to Roger of Hereford is a most interesting  illustration of his character and of his diplomatic skill, and it shows  us clearly how great must have been his usefulness to William. Though it  is perfectly evident to us that he suspects the loyalty of Roger to be  seriously tempted, there is not a word of suspicion expressed in the  letter, but the considerations most likely to keep him loyal are strongly  urged. With the exception of the sentence about the sheriffs, and formal  phrases at the beginning and end, the letter runs thus: \"Our lord, the  king of the English, salutes you and us all as faithful subjects of his  in whom he has great confidence, and commands us that as much as we are  able we should have care of his castles, lest, which God avert, they  should be betrayed to his enemies; wherefore I ask you, as I ought to  ask, most dear son, whom, as God is witness, I love with my whole heart  and desire to serve, and whose father I loved as my soul, that you take  such care of this matter and of all fidelity to our lord the king that  you may have the praise of God, and of him, and of all good men. Hold  always in your memory how your glorious father lived, and how faithfully  he served his lord, and with how great energy he acquired many things and  held them with great honour.... I should like to talk freely with you; if  this is your will, let me know where we can meet and talk together of  your affairs and of our lord the king's. I am ready to go to meet you  wherever you direct.\"    The letter had no effect. Roger seems to have been a man of violent  temper, and there was a woman in this case also, though we do not know  that she herself influenced the course of events. The insurrection is  said to have been determined upon, and the details of action planned,  at the marriage of Roger's sister to Ralph Guader, Earl of Norfolk, a  marriage which William had forbidden.      There was that bride-ale    That was many men's bale,    said the Saxon chronicler, and it was so indeed. The two chief  conspirators persuaded Earl Waltheof to join them, at least for the  moment, and their plan was to drive the king out of England and to  divide the kingdom between them into three great principalities, \"for  we wish,\" the Norman historian Orderic makes them say, \"to restore in  all respects the kingdom of England as it was formerly in the time of  King Edward,\" a most significant indication of the general opinion  about the effect of the Conquest, even if the words are not theirs.    After the marriage the Earls of Norfolk and Hereford separated to raise  their forces and bring them together, when they believed they would be  too strong for any force which could be raised to act against them. They  counted on the unpopularity of the Normans and on the king's difficulties  abroad which would prevent his return to England. The king did not  return, but their other hope proved fallacious. Bishop Wulfstan of  Worcester and Abbot Ethelwy of Evesham, both English prelates, with some  Norman help, cut off the line of communication in the west, and Earl  Roger could not force his way through. The two justiciars, William of  Warenne and Richard of Bienfaite, after summoning the earls to answer in  the king's court, with the aid of Bishop Odo and the Bishop of Coutances,  who was also a great English baron, raised an army of English as well as  Normans, and went to meet Earl Ralph, who was marching westwards.  Something like a battle took place, but the rebels were easily defeated.  Ralph fled back to Norwich, but it did not seem to him wise to stop  there. Leaving his wife to stand a siege in the castle, he sailed off to  hasten the assistance which had already been asked for from the Danes. A  Danish fleet indeed appeared off the coast, but it did nothing beyond  making a plundering raid in Yorkshire. Emma, the new-made wife of Earl  Ralph, seems to have been a good captain and to have had a good garrison.  The utmost efforts of the king's forces could not take the castle, and  she at last surrendered only on favourable terms. She was allowed to  retire to the continent with her forces. The terms which were granted  her, as they are made known in a letter from Lanfranc to William, are  especially interesting as giving us one of the earliest glimpses we have  of that extensive dividing out of land to under-vassals, the process of  subinfeudation, which must already have taken place on the estates  granted to the king's tenants in chief. A clear distinction was made  between the men who were serving Ralph because they held land of him, and  those who were merely mercenaries. Ralph's vassals, although they were in  arms against Ralph's lord, the king, were thought to be entitled to  better terms, and they secured them more easily than those who served him  for money. Ralph and Emma eventually lived out the life of a generation  of those days, on Ralph's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8559"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 360, November 25, 1882 (#16)"],[1,"along the coast obtained in  large quantities for the construction of massive breakwaters to protect  harbors. Another point famous for its granite is Staten Island, New  York. This stone weighs 180 pounds to the cubic foot, while the Quincy  granite weighs but 165. The Staten Island product is used not only for  building purposes, but is also especially esteemed for paving after both  the Russ and Belgian patents. New York and other cities derive large  supplies from this source. The granite of Weehawken, N.J., is of the  same character, and greatly in demand. Port Deposit, Md., and Richmond,  Va, are also centers of granite production. Near Abbeville, S.C., and  in Georgia, granite is found quite like that of Quincy. Much southern  granite, however, decomposes readily, and is almost as soft as clay.  This variety of stone is found in great abundance in the Rocky  Mountains; but, except to a slight extent in California, it is not yet  quarried there.    Granite, having little grain, can be cut into blocks of almost any size  and shape. Specimens as much as eighty feet long have been taken out and  transported great distances. The quarrying is done by drilling a series  of small holes, six inches or more deep and almost the same distance  apart, inserting steel wedges along the whole line and then tapping each  gently with a hammer in succession, in order that the strain may be  evenly distributed.    A building material that came into use earlier than granite is known as  freestone or sandstone; although its first employment does not date back  further than the erection of King's Chapel, Boston, already referred to  as the earliest well-known occasion where granite was used in building.  Altogether the most famous American sandstone quarries are those at  Portland, on the Connecticut River, opposite Middletown. These were  worked before the Revolution; and their product has been shipped to many  distant points in the country. The long rows of \"brownstone fronts\" in  New York city are mostly of Portland stone, though in many cases the  walls are chiefly of brick covered with thin layers of the stone. The  old red sandstone of the Connecticut valley is distinguished in geology  for the discovery of gigantic fossil footprints of birds, first noticed  in the Portland quarries in 1802. Some of these footprints measured  ten to sixteen inches, and they were from four to six feet apart. The  sandstone of Belleville, N.J., has also extensive use and reputation.  Trinity Church in New York city and the Boston Atheneum are built of the  product of these quarries; St. Lawrence County, New York, is noted also  for a fine bed of sandstone. At Potsdam it is exposed to a depth of  seventy feet. There are places though, in New England, New York, and  Eastern Pennsylvania, where a depth of three hundred feet has been  reached. The Potsdam sandstone is often split to the thinness of an  inch. It hardens by exposure, and is often used for smelting furnace  hearth-stones. Shawangunk Mountain, in Ulster County, yields a sandstone  of inferior quality, which has been unsuccessfully tried for paving;  as it wears very unevenly. From Ulster, Greene, and Albany Counties  sandstone slabs for sidewalks are extensively quarried for city use;  the principal outlets of these sections being Kingston, Saugerties,  Coxsackie, Bristol, and New Baltimore, on the Hudson. In this region  quantities amounting to millions of square feet are taken out in large  sheets, which are often sawed into the sizes desired. The vicinity of  Medina, in Western New York, yields a sandstone extensively used in that  section for paving and curbing, and a little for building. A rather poor  quality of this stone has been found along the Potomac, and some of it  was used in the erection of the old Capitol building at Washington.  Ohio yields a sandstone that is of a light gray color; Berea, Amherst,  Vermilion, and Massillon are the chief points of production. St.  Genevieve, Mo., yields a stone of fine grain of a light straw color,  which is quite equal to the famous Caen stone of France. The Lake  Superior sandstones are dark and coarse grained, but strong.    In some parts of the country, where neither granite nor sandstone  is easily procured, blue and gray limestone are sometimes used for  building, and, when hammer dressed, often look like granite. A serious  objection to their use, however, is the occasional presence of iron,  which rusts on exposure, and defaces the building. In Western New York  they are widely used. Topeka stone, like the coquine of Florida and  Bermuda, is soft like wood when first quarried, and easily wrought,  but it hardens on exposure. The limestones of Canton, Mo., Joliet and  Athens, Ill., Dayton, Sandusky, Marblehead, and other points in Ohio,  Ellittsville, Ind., and Louisville and Bowling Green, Ky., are great  favorites west. In many of these regions limestone is extensively used  for macadamizing roads, for which it is excellently adapted. It also  yields excellent slabs or flags for sidewalks.    One of the principal uses of this variety of stone is its conversion, by  burning, into lime for building purposes. All limestones are by no  means equally excellent in this regard. Thomaston lime, burned with  Pennsylvania coal, near the Penobscot River, has had a wide reputation  for nearly half a century. It has been shipped thence to all points  along the Atlantic coast, invading Virginia as far as Lynchburg, and  going even to New Orleans, Smithfield, R.I., and Westchester County,  N.Y., near the lower end of the Highlands, also make a particularly  excellent quality of lime. Kingston, in Ulster County, makes an inferior  sort for agricultural purposes. The Ohio and other western stones yield  a poor lime, and that section is almost entirely dependent on the east  for supplies.    Marbles, like limestones, with which they are closely related, are very  abundant in this country, and are also to be found in a great variety of  colors. As early as 1804 American marble was used for statuary purposes.  Early in the century it also obtained extensive employment for  gravestones. Its use for building purposes has been more recent than  granite and sandstone in this country; and it is coming to supersede the  latter to a great degree. For mantels, fire-places, porch pillars, and  like ornamental purposes, however, our variegated, rich colored and  veined or brecciated marbles were in use some time before exterior walls  were made from them. Among the earliest marble buildings were Girard  College in Philadelphia and the old City Hall in New York, and the  Custom House in the latter city, afterward used for a sub-treasury. The  new Capitol building at Washington is among the more recent structures  composed of this material. Our exports of marble to Cuba and elsewhere  amount to over $300,000 annually, although we import nearly the same  amount from Italy. And yet an article can be found in the United States  fully as fine as the famous Carrara marble. We refer to that which comes  from Rutland, Vt. This state yields the largest variety and choicest  specimens. The marble belt runs both ways from Rutland County, where  the only quality fit for statuary is obtained. Toward the north it  deteriorates by growing less sound, though finer in grain; while to  the south it becomes coarser. A beautiful black marble is obtained at  Shoreham, Vt. There are also handsome brecciated marbles in the same  state; and in the extreme northern part, near Lake Champlain, they  become more variegated and rich in hue. Such other marble as is found  in New England is of an inferior quality. The pillars of Girard  College came from Berkshire, Mass., which ranks next after Vermont in  reputation.    The marble belt extends from New England through New York, Pennsylvania,  Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Virginia, Tennessee, and the  Carolinas, to Georgia and Alabama. Some of the variegated and high  colored varieties obtained near Knoxville, Tenn., nearly equal that of  Vermont. The Rocky Mountains contain a vast abundance and variety.    Slate was known to exist in this country to a slight extent in colonial  days. It was then used for gravestones, and to some extent for roofing  and school purposes. But most of our supplies came from Wales. It is  stated that a slate quarry was operated in Northampton County, Pa., as  early as 1805. In 1826 James M. Porter and Samuel Taylor engaged in the  business, obtaining their supplies from the Kittanninny Mountains. From  this time the business developed rapidly, the village of Slateford being  an outgrowth of it, and large rafts being employed to float the product  down the Schuylkill to Philadelphia. By 1860 the industry had reached  the capacity of 20,000 cases of slate, valued at $10 a case, annually.  In 1839 quarries were opened in the Piscataquis River, forty miles  north of Bangor, Me., but poor transportation facilities retarded the  business. Vermont began to yield in 1852. New York's quarries are  confined to Washington County, near the Vermont line. Maryland has  a limited supply from Harford County. The Huron Mountains, north of  Marquette, Mich., contain slate, which is also said to exist in Pike  County, Ga.    Grindstones, millstones, and whetstones are quarried in New York, Ohio,  Michigan, Pennsylvania, and other States. Mica is found at Acworth and  Grafton, N. H., and near Salt Lake, but our chief supply comes from  Haywood, Yancey, Mitchell, and Macon counties, in North Carolina, and  our product is so large that we can afford to export it. Other stones,  such as silex, for making glass, etc., are found in profusion in various  parts of the country, but we have no space to enter into a detailed  account of them at present.--_Pottery and Glassware Reporter_.           *       *       *       *       *          AN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.
