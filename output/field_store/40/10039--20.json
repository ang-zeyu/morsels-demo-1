He pounded heavily down the long trail into the coulee, passed close by the  house with a glance sidelong to see if anybody was in sight there, rounded  the corral to follow the trail which wound zigzag up the farther coulee  wall, and overtook Val, running bareheaded up the hill, dragging a wet sack  after her. She was panting already from the climb, and she had on thin  slippers with high heels, he noticed, that impeded her progress and  promised a sprained ankle before she reached the top. Kent laughed grimly  when he overtook her; he thought it was like a five-year-old child running  with a cup of water to put out a burning house.    \"Where do you think you're going with that sack?\" he called out, by way of  greeting.    She turned a pale, terrified face toward him, and reached up a hand  mechanically to push her fair hair out of her eyes. \"So much smoke was  rolling into the coulee,\" she panted, \"and I knew there must be a fire. And  I've never felt quite easy about our guards since Polycarp Jenks said--Do  you know where it is--the fire?\"    \"It's between here and the railroad. Give me that sack, and you go on back  to the house. You can't do any good.\" And when she handed the sack up to  him and then kept on up the hill, he became autocratic in his tone. \"Go on  back to the house, I tell you!\"    \"I shall not do anything of the kind,\" she retorted indignantly, and Kent  gave a snort of disapproval, kicked his horse into a lunging gallop, and  left her.    \"You'll spoil your complexion,\" he cried over his shoulder, \"and that's  about all you will do. You better go back and get a parasol.\"    Val did not attempt to reply, but she refused to let his taunts turn her  back, and kept stubbornly climbing, though tears of pure rage filled her  eyes and even slipped over the lids to her cheeks. Before she had reached  the top, he was charging down upon her again, and the pallor of his face  told her much.    \"All hell couldn't stop that fire!\" he cried, before he was near her, and  the words were barely distinguishable in the roar which was growing louder  and more terrifying. _\"Get back!_ You want to stand there till it comes  down on you?\" Then, just as he was passing, he saw how white and trembling  she was, and he pulled up, with Michael sliding his front feet in the loose  soil that he might stop on that steep slope.    \"You don't want to go and faint,\" he remonstrated in a more kindly tone,  vaguely conscious that he had perhaps seemed brutal. \"Here, give me your  hand, and stick your toe in the stirrup. Ah, don't waste time trying to  make up your mind--up you come! Don't you want to save the house and  corrals--and the haystacks? We've got our work cut out, let me tell you, if  we do it.\"    He had leaned and lifted her up bodily, helped her to put her foot in the  stirrup from which he had drawn his own, and he held her beside him while  he sent Michael down the trail as fast as he dared. It was a good deal of  a nuisance, having to look after her when seconds were so precious, but  he couldn't go on and leave her, though she might easily have reached the  bottom as soon as he if she had not been so frightened. He was afraid to  trust her; she looked, to him, as if she were going to faint in his arms.    \"You don't want to get scared,\" he said, as calmly as he could. \"It's back  two or three miles on the bench yet, and I guess we can easy stop it from  burning anything but the grass. It's this wind, you see. Manley went to  town, I suppose?\"    \"Yes,\" she answered weakly. \"He went yesterday, and stayed over. I'm all  alone, and I didn't know what to do, only to go up and try--\"    \"No use, up there.\"    They were at the corral gate then, and he set her down carefully, then  dismounted and turned Michael into the corral and shut the gate.    \"If we can't step it, and I ain't close by, I wish you'd let Michael out,\"  he said hurriedly, his eyes taking in the immediate surroundings and  measuring the danger which lurked in weeds, grass, and scattered hay. \"A  horse don't have much show when he's shut up, and--Out there where that dry  ditch runs, we'll back-fire. You take this sack and come and watch out my  fire don't jump the ditch. We'll carry it around the house, just the other  side the trail.\" He was pulling a handful of grass for a torch, and while  he was twisting it and feeling in his pocket for a match, he looked at her  keenly. \"You aren't going to get hysterics and leave me to fight it alone,  are you?\" he challenged.    \"I hope I'm not quite such a silly,\" she answered stiffly, and he smiled to  himself as he ran along the far side of the ditch with his blazing tuft  of grass, setting fire to the tangled, brown mat which covered the coulee  bottom.    Val followed slowly behind him, watching that the blaze did not blow back  across the ditch, and beating it out when it seemed likely to do so. Now  that she could actually do something, she was no more excited than he, if  one could judge by her manner. She did look sulky, however, at his way of  treating her.    To back-fire on short notice, with no fresh-turned furrow of moist earth,  but only a shallow little dry ditch with the grass almost meeting over its  top in places, is ticklish business at best. Kent went slowly, stamping out  incipient blazes that seemed likely to turn unruly, and not trusting  Val any more than he was compelled to do. She was a woman, and Kent's  experience with women of her particular type had not been extensive enough  to breed confidence in an emergency like this.    He had no more than finished stringing his line of fire in the irregular  half circle which enclosed house, corral, stables, and haystacks, and had  for its eastern half the muddy depression which, in seasons less dry, was  a fair-sized creek fed by the spring, when a jagged line of fire with an  upper wall of tumbling, brown smoke, leaped into view at the top of the  bluff.    One thing was in his favor: The grass upon the hillside was scantier  than on the level upland, and here and there were patches of yellow soil  absolutely bare of vegetation, where a fire would be compelled to halt and  creep slowly around. Also, fire usually burns slower down a hill than over  a level. On the other hand, the long, seamlike depressions which ran to the  top were filled with dry brush, and even the coulee bottom had clumps of  rosebushes and wild currant, where the flames would revel briefly.    But already the black, smoking line which curved around the haystacks to  the north, and around the house toward the south, was widening with every  passing second.    Val had a tub half filled with water at the house, and that helped  amazingly by making it possible to keep the sacks wet, so that every blow  counted as they beat out the ragged tongues of flame which, in that wind,  would jump here and there the ditch and the road, and go creeping back  toward the stacks and the buildings. For it was a long line they were  guarding, and there was a good deal of running up and down in their  endeavor to be in two places at once.    Then Val, in turning to strike a new-born flame behind her, swept her  skirt across a tuft of smoldering grass and set herself afire. With the  excitement of watching all points at once, and with the smoke and smell of  fire all about her, she did not see what had happened, and must have paid a  frightful penalty if Kent had not, at that moment, been running past her to  reach a point where a blaze had jumped the ditch.    He swerved, and swung a newly wet sack around her with a force which would  have knocked her down if he had not at the same time caught and held her.  Val screamed, and struggled in his arms, and Kent knew that it was of  him she was afraid. As soon as he dared, he released her and backed away  sullenly.    \"Sorry I didn't have time to say please--you were just ready to go up in  smoke,\" he flung savagely over his shoulder. But he found himself shaking  and weak, so that when he reached the blaze he must beat out, the sack was  heavy as lead. \"Afraid of _me_--women sure do beat hell!\" he told himself,  when he was a bit steadier. He glanced back at her resentfully. Val was  stooping, inspecting the damage done to her dress. She stood up, looked  at him, and he saw that her face was white again, as it had been upon the  hillside.    A moment later he was near her again.    \"Mr. Burnett, I'm--ashamed--but I didn't know, and you--you startled me,\"  she stopped him long enough to confess, though she did not meet his eyes.  \"You saved--\"    \"You'll be startled worse, if you let the fire hang there in that bunch of  grass,\" he interrupted coolly. \"Behind you, there.\"    She turned obediently, and swung her sack down several times upon a  smoldering spot, and the incident was closed.    Speedily it was forgotten, also. For with the meeting of the fires, which  they stood still to watch, a patch of wild rosebushes was caught fairly  upon both sides, and flared high, with a great snapping and crackling.  The wind seized upon the blaze, flung it toward them like a great, yellow  banner, and swept cinders and burning twigs far out over the blackened  path of the back fire. Kent watched it and hardly breathed, but Val was  shielding her face from the searing heat with her arms, and so did not  see what happened then. A burning branch like a long, flaming dagger flew  straight with the wind and lighted true as if flung by the hand of an  enemy. A long, neatly tapered stack received it fairly, and Kent's cry  brought Val's arms down, and her scared eyes staring at him.    \"That settles the hay,\" he exclaimed, and raced for the stacks knowing all  the while that he could do nothing, and yet panting in his hurry to reach  the spot.    Michael, trampling uneasily in the corral, lifted his head and neighed  shrilly as Kent passed him on the run.

He who learns from his companion a single chapter, a single rule, a  single verse, a single expression, or even a single letter, ought to  pay him honor, for so we find with David, King of Israel, who learned  only two things from Ahitophel (11), and yet regarded him as his  master, his guide, and familiar friend, as it is said, \"But it was  thou, a man, mine equal, my guide, and my familiar friend\" (12).  Now,  is it not an argument from minor to major (13), that if David, the  King of Israel, who learned only two things from Ahitophel, regarded  him as his master, guide, and familiar friend, he who learns from his  fellow a chapter, rule, verse, expression, or even a single letter, is  bound to pay him honor.  And \"honor\" is nothing but _Torah_, as it is  said, \"The wise shall inherit honor (14) and the perfect shall inherit  good\" (15).  And \"good\" is nothing but _Torah_, as it is said, \"For I  give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my _Torah_\" (16).          (11) Ahitophel deserted David to take up the cause of his        rebellious son, Absalom.  See II Sam. XVI, 15; XVII, 1 _et        seq._          (12) See Ps. LV, 14.  The two things David learned are hinted        at in Ps. LV, 15.          (13) See chapter I, n. 17.          (14) Prov. III, 35.          (15) _Ibid._, XXVIII, 10.          (16) _Ibid._, IV, 2.    4. This is the way that is becoming for the study of the _Torah_: a  morsel of bread with salt thou must eat (17), \"and water by measure  thou must drink\" (18), thou must sleep upon the ground, and live a  life of trouble the while thou toilest in the _Torah_.  If thou doest  thus, \"Happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee\" (19),  \"happy shalt thou be\" in this world, and \"it shall be well with thee\"  in the world to come (20).          (17) Even he who has only bread and salt to eat must busy        himself with the study of the _Torah_.          (18) Ezek. IV, 11.          (19) Ps. CXXVIII, 2.          (20) Cf. chapter IV, 1.    5. Seek not greatness for thyself, and court not honor; let thy works  exceed thy learning; and crave not after the table of kings; for thy  table is greater than theirs, and thy crown is greater than theirs,  and thy Employer is faithful to pay thee the reward of thy work.    6. The _Torah_ is greater than the priesthood and than royalty, for  royalty demands thirty qualifications (21), the priesthood twenty-four  (22), while the _Torah_ is acquired by forty-eight.  And these are  they: by audible study; by a listening ear (23); by distinct  pronunciation; by understanding (24) and discernment of the heart; by  awe, reverence, meekness, cheerfulness (25); by ministering to the  sages, by attaching one's self to colleagues, by discussion with  disciples; by sedateness; by knowledge of the Scripture and of the  _Mishnah;_ by moderation in business, in intercourse with the world,  in pleasure, in sleep, in conversation, in laughter; by long  suffering; by a good heart; by faith in the wise; by resignation under  chastisement; by recognizing one's place, rejoicing in one's portion,  putting a fence to one's words, claiming no merit for one's self, by  being beloved, loving the All-present, loving mankind, loving just  courses, rectitude, and reproof; by keeping one's self far from honor,  not boasting of one's learning, nor delighting in giving decisions; by  bearing the yoke with one's fellow, judging him favorably, and leading  him to truth and peace; by being composed in one's study; by asking  and answering, hearing and adding thereto; by learning with the object  of teaching, and by learning with the object of practising; by making  one's master wise, fixing attention upon his discourse, and reporting  a thing in the name of who said it.  So thou hast learned, \"Whosoever  reports a thing in the name of him that said it brings deliverance  into the world,\" as it is said, \"And Esther told the king in the name  of Mordecai\" (26).

(26) Esth. II, 22.    7. Great is the _Torah_, which gives life to those that practise it in  this world and in the world to come, as it is said, \"For they are life  unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh\" (27); and it  says, \"It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones\" (28);  and it says, \"It is a tree of life to them that grasp it, and of them  that uphold it every one is rendered happy\" (29); and it says, \"For  they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy  neck\" (30); and it says, \"It shall give to thine head a chaplet of  grace, a crown of glory it shall deliver to thee\" (31); and it says,  \"For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life  shall be increased\" (32); and it says, \"Length of days is in its right  hand; in its left hand are riches and honor\" (33); and it says, \"For  length of days, and years of life, and peace shall they add to thee\"  (34).

Simeon, the son of  Yohai, said, \"Beauty, strength, riches, honor, wisdom, old age, a  hoary head, and children are comely to the righteous and comely to the  world, as it is said, 'The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be  found in the way of righteousness' (35); and it says, 'The glory of  young men is their strength, and the adornment of old men is the hoary  head' (36); and it says, 'A crown unto the wise is their riches' (37);  and it says, 'Children's children are the crown of old men, and the  adornment of children are their fathers' (38); and it is said, 'Then  the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed; for the Lord of  hosts shall reign in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before his  elders shall be glory'\" (39).  R. Simeon, the son of Menasya, said,  \"These seven qualifications which the sages enumerated as becoming to  the righteous were all realized in Rabbi Judah, the Prince (40), and  in his sons.\"          (35) _Ibid._, XVI, 31.

Jose, the son of Kisma (41), said, \"I was once walking by the  way, when a man met me and saluted me, and I returned the salutation.  He said to me, 'Rabbi, from what place art thou?'  I said to him, 'I  come from a great city of sages and scribes.'  He said to me, 'If thou  art willing to dwell with us in our place, I will give thee a thousand  thousand golden dinars and precious stones and pearls.'  I said to  him, 'Wert thou to give me all the silver and gold and precious stones  and pearls in the world, I would not dwell anywhere but in a home of  the _Torah';_ and thus it is written in the book of Psalms by the  hands of David, King of Israel, 'The law of thy mouth is better unto  me than thousands of gold and silver' (42); and not only so, but in  the hour of man's departure neither silver nor gold nor precious  stones nor pearls accompany him, but only _Torah_ and good works, as  it is said, 'When thou walkest it shall lead thee; when thou liest  down it shall watch over thee; and when thou awakest it shall talk  with thee' (43); 'when thou walkest it shall lead thee'--in this  world; and 'when thou awakest it shall talk with thee'--in the world  to come.  And it says, 'The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,  saith the Lord of hosts'\" (44).          (41) He lived about 120 C.E.          (42) Ps. XCIX, 72.          (43) Prov. VI, 22.

Five possessions the Holy One, blessed be He, made especially His  own in His world, and these are they, the _Torah_, heaven and earth,  Abraham, Israel, and the house of the sanctuary.  Whence know we this  of the _Torah?_  Because it is written, \"The Lord possessed me as the  beginning of his way, before his works, from of old\" (45).  Whence of  heaven and earth?  Because it is written, \"Thus saith the Lord, the  heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what manner of  house will ye build unto me? and what manner of place for my rest?\"  (46); and it says, \"How manifold are thy works, O Lord!  In wisdom  hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy possessions\" (47).  Whence of"]]]
