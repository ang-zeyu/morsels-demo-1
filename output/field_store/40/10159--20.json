She was border territory upon her  admission to the sisterhood of States.    An area equal to four ordinary States, and a climate that permitted  of outdoor life the year round, made it a desirable rendezvous for  criminals. The sparsely settled condition of the country, the flow of  immigration being light until the seventies, was an important factor.  The fugitives from justice of the older States with a common impulse  turned toward this empire of isolation. Europe contributed her quota,  more particularly from the south, bringing with them the Mafia and  vendetta. Once it was the Ultima Thule of the criminal western world.  From the man who came for not building a church to the one who had  taken human life, the catalogue of crime was fully represented.    Humorous writers tell us that it was a breach of good manners to ask  a man his name, or what State he was from, or to examine the brand on  his horse very particularly. It can be safely said that there was a  great amount of truth mingled with the humor. Some of these fugitives  from justice became good citizens, but the majority sooner or later  took up former callings.    Along with this criminal immigration came the sturdy settler, the  man intent on building a home and establishing a fireside. Usually  following lines of longitude, he came from other Southern States. He  also brought with him the fortitude of the pioneer that reclaims the  wilderness and meets any emergency that confronts him. To meet and  deal with this criminal element as a matter of necessity soon became  an important consideration. His only team of horses was frequently  stolen. His cattle ran off their range, their ear-marks altered and  brands changed. Frequently it was a band of neighbors, together in  a posse, who followed and brought to bay the marauders. It was an  unlucky moment for a horse-thief when he was caught in possession of  another man's horse. The impromptu court of emergency had no sentiment  in regard to passing sentence of death. It was a question of guilt,  and when that was established, Judge Lynch passed sentence.    As the State advanced, the authorities enlisted small companies of men  called Rangers. The citizens' posse soon gave way to this organized  service. The companies, few in number at first, were gradually  increased until the State had over a dozen companies in the field.  These companies numbered anywhere from ten to sixty men. It can be  said with no discredit to the State that there were never half enough  companies of men for the work before them.    There was a frontier on the south and west of over two thousand miles  to be guarded. A fair specimen of the large things in that State was a  shoe-string congressional district, over eleven hundred miles long. To  the Ranger, then, is all credit due for guarding this western frontier  against the Indians and making life and the possession of property a  possibility. On the south was to be met the bandit, the smuggler, and  every grade of criminal known to the code.    A generation had come and gone before the Ranger's work was fairly  done. The emergency demanded brave men. They were ready. Not  necessarily born to the soil, as a boy the guardian of the frontier  was expert in the use of firearms, and in the saddle a tireless rider.  As trailers many of them were equal to hounds. In the use of that  arbiter of the frontier, the six-shooter, they were artists. As a  class, never before or since have their equals in the use of that arm  come forward to question this statement.    The average criminal, while familiar with firearms, was as badly  handicapped as woman would be against man. The Ranger had no equal.  The emergency that produced him no longer existing, he will never  have a successor. Any attempt to copy the original would be hopeless  imitation. He was shot at at short range oftener than he received his  monthly wage. He admired the criminal that would fight, and despised  one that would surrender on demand. He would nurse back to life a  dead-game man whom his own shot had brought to earth, and give a  coward the chance to run any time if he so desired.    He was compelled to lead a life in the open and often descend to the  level of the criminal. He had few elements in his makeup, and but a  single purpose; but that one purpose--to rid the State of crime--he  executed with a vengeance. He was poorly paid for the service  rendered. Frequently there was no appropriation with which to pay him;  then he lived by rewards and the friendship of ranchmen.    The Ranger always had a fresh horse at his command,--no one thought of  refusing him this. Rust-proof, rugged, and tireless, he gave the State  protection for life and property. The emergency had produced the man.    \"Here, take my glass and throw down on that grove of timber yonder,  and notice if there is any sign of animal life to be seen,\" said  Sergeant \"Smoky\" C----, addressing \"Ramrod,\" a private in Company X  of the Texas Rangers. The sergeant and the four men had been out on  special duty, and now we had halted after an all night's ride looking  for shade and water,--the latter especially. We had two prisoners,  (horse-thieves), some extra saddle stock, and three pack mules.    It was an hour after sun-up. We had just come out of the foothills,  where the Brazos has its source, and before us lay the plains, dusty  and arid. This grove of green timber held out a hope that within it  might be found what we wanted. Eyesight is as variable as men, but  Ramrod's was known to be reliable for five miles with the naked eye,  and ten with the aid of a good glass. He dismounted at the sergeant's  request, and focused the glass on this oasis, and after sweeping the  field for a minute or so, remarked languidly, \"There must be water  there. I can see a band of antelope grazing out from the grove. Hold  your mules! Something is raising a dust over to the south. Good! It's  cattle coming to the water.\"    While he was covering the field with his glass, two of the boys were  threatening with eternal punishment the pack mules, which showed  an energetic determination to lie down and dislodge their packs by  rolling.    \"Cut your observations short as possible there, Ramrod, or there will  be re-packing to do. Mula, you hybrid son of your father, don't you  dare to lie down!\"    But Ramrod's observations were cut short at sight of the cattle, and  we pushed out for the grove, about seven miles distant. As we  rode this short hour's ride, numerous small bands of antelope were  startled, and in turn stood and gazed at us in bewilderment.    \"I'm not tasty,\" said Sergeant Smoky, \"but I would give the preference  this morning to a breakfast of a well-roasted side of ribs of a nice  yearling venison over the salt hoss that the Lone Star State furnishes  this service. Have we no hunters with us?\"    \"Let me try,\" begged a little man we called \"Cushion-foot.\" What his  real name was none of us knew. The books, of course, would show some  name, and then you were entitled to a guess. He was as quiet as a  mouse, as reliable as he was quiet, and as noiseless in his movements  as a snake. One of the boys went with him, making quite a detour from  our course, but always remaining in sight. About two miles out from  the grove, we sighted a small band of five or six antelope, who soon  took fright and ran to the nearest elevation. Here they made a stand  about half a mile distant. We signaled to our hunters, who soon  spotted them and dismounted. We could see Cushion sneaking through the  short grass like a coyote, \"Conajo\" leading the horses, well hidden  between them. We held the antelopes' attention by riding around in a  circle, flagging them. Several times Cushion lay flat, and we thought  he was going to risk a long shot. Then he would crawl forward like a  cat, but finally came to his knee. We saw the little puff, the band  squatted, jumping to one side far enough to show one of their number  down and struggling in the throes of death.    \"Good long shot, little man,\" said the sergeant, \"and you may have the  choice of cuts, just so I get a rib.\"    We saw Conajo mount and ride up on a gallop, but we held our course  for the grove. We were busy making camp when the two rode in with a  fine two-year-old buck across the pommel of Cushion's saddle. They  had only disemboweled him, but Conajo had the heart as a trophy of the  accuracy of the shot, though Cushion hadn't a word to say. It was  a splendid heart shot. Conajo took it over and showed it to the two  Mexican prisoners. It was an object lesson to them. One said to the  other, \"Es un buen tirador.\"    We put the prisoners to roasting the ribs, and making themselves  useful in general. One man guarded them at their work, while all the  others attended to the hobbling and other camp duties.    It proved to be a delightful camp. We aimed to stay until sunset, the  days being sultry and hot.

NATHANIEL AND REBECCA GREENSMITH    Nathaniel Greensmith lived in Hartford, south of the little river, in  1661-62, on a lot of about twenty acres, with a house and barn. He also  had other holdings \"neer Podunk,\" and \"on ye highway leading to  Farmington.\"    He was thrifty by divergent and economical methods, since he is credited  in the records of the time with stealing a bushel and a half of wheat,  of stealing a hoe, and of lying to the court, and of battery.    In one way or another he accumulated quite a property for those days,  since the inventory of it filed in the Hartford Probate Office, January  25, 1662, after his execution, carried an appraisal of L137. l4s.  1_d_.--including \"2 bibles,\" \"a sword,\" \"a resthead,\" and a \"drachm  cup\"--all indicating that Nathaniel judiciously mingled his theology and  patriotism, his recreation and refreshment, with his everyday practical  affairs and opportunities.    But he made one adventure that was most unprofitable. In an evil hour he  took to wife Rebecca, relict of Abraham Elson, and also relict of Jarvis  Mudge, and of whom so good a man as the Rev. John Whiting, minister of  the First Church in Hartford--afterward first pastor of the Second  Church--said that she was \"a lewd, ignorant and considerably aged  woman.\"    This triple combination of personal qualities soon elicited the  criticism and animosity of the community, and Nathaniel and Rebecca fell  under the most fatal of all suspicions of that day, that of being  possessed by the evil one.    Gossip and rumor about these unpopular neighbors culminated in a formal  complaint, and December 30, 1662, at a court held at Hartford, both the  Greensmiths were separately indicted in the same formal charge.    \"Nathaniel Greensmith thou art here indicted by the name of Nathaniel  Greensmith for not having the fear of God before thine eyes, thou hast  entertained familiarity with Satan, the grand enemy of God and  mankind--and by his help hast acted things in a preternatural way beyond  human abilities in a natural course for which according to the law of  God and the established law of this commonwealth thou deservest to die.\"    While Rebecca was in prison under suspicion, she was interviewed by two  ministers, Revs. Haynes and Whiting, as to the charges of Ann Cole--a  next door neighbor--which were written down by them, all of which, and  more, she confessed to be true before the court.    (Note. Increase Mather regarded this confession as convictive a proof of  real witchcraft as most single cases he had known.)    THE MINISTERS' ACCOUNT--_Promise to Satan--A merry Christmas  meeting--Stone's lecture--Haynes' plea--The dear Devil--The corvine  guest--Sexual delusions_    \"She forthwith and freely confessed those things to be true, that she  (and other persons named in the discourse) had familiarity with the  devil. Being asked whether she had made an express covenant with him,  she answered she had not, only as she promised to go with him when he  called (which she had accordingly done several times). But that the  devil told her that at Christmas they would have a merry meeting, and  then the covenant should be drawn and subscribed. Thereupon the  fore-mentioned Mr. Stone (being then in court) with much weight and  earnestness laid forth the exceeding heinousness and hazard of that  dreadful sin; and therewith solemnly took notice (upon the occasion  given) of the devil's loving Christmas.    \"A person at the same time present being desired the next day more  particularly to enquire of her about her guilt, it was accordingly done,  to whom she acknowledged that though when Mr. Haynes began to read she  could have torn him in pieces, and was so much resolved as might be to  deny her guilt (as she had done before) yet after he had read awhile,  she was as if her flesh had been pulled from her bones, (such was her  expression,) and so could not deny any longer. She also declared that  the devil first appeared to her in the form of a deer or fawn, skipping  about her, wherewith she was not much affrighted but by degrees he  contrived talk with her; and that their meetings were frequently at such  a place, (near her own house;) that some of the company came in one  shape and some in another, and one in particular in the shape of a crow  came flying to them. Amongst other things she owned that the devil had  frequent use of her body.\"    Had Rebecca been content with purging her own conscience, she alone  would have met the fate she had invoked, and probably deserved; but out  of \"love to her husband's soul\" she made an accusation against him,  which of itself secured his conviction of the same offense, with the  same dire penalty.
