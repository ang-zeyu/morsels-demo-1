I had 'bout eighteen head of boys and five  girls myself; dere was so many, I can' 'member all of dem.\"    Mr. Gantling was asked to relate some incidents that he could remember  of the lives of slaves, and he continued:    \"Well the horn would blow every morning for you to git up and go right  to work; when the sun ris' if you were not in the field working, you  would be whipped with whips and leather strops. I 'member Aunt Beaty was  beat until she could hardly get along but I can' 'member what for but do  you know she had to work along till she got better. My ma had to work  pretty hard but my oldest sister, Judy, was too young to work much.    \"A heap of de slaves would run away and hide in de woods to keep from  working so hard but the white folks to keep them from running away so  that they could not ketch 'em would put a chain around the neck which  would hang down the back and be fastened on to another 'round the waist  and another 'round the feet so they could not run, still they had to  work and sleep in 'em, too; sometimes they would wear these chains for  three or four months.    \"When a slave would die they had wooden boxes to put 'em in and dug  holes and just put then in. A slave might go to a sister or brother's  funeral.    \"My recollection is very bad and so much is forgotten, but I have seen  slaves sold in droves like cows; they called 'em 'ruffigees,' and white  men wuz drivin' 'em like hogs and cows for sale. Mothers and fathers  were sold and parted from their chillun; they wuz sold to white people  in diffunt states. I tell you chile, it was pitiful, but God did not let  it last always. I have heard slaves morning and night pray for  deliverance. Some of 'em would stand up in de fields or bend over cotton  and corn and pray out loud for God to help 'em and in time you see, He  did.    \"They had whut you call \"pattyrollers\" who would catch you from home and  'wear you out' and send you back to your master. If a master had slaves  he jes' could not rule (some of 'em wuz hard and jes' would not mind de  boss), he would ask him if he wanted to go to another plantation and if  he said he did, then, he would give him a pass and that pass would read:  \"Give this nigger hell.\" Of course whan the \"pattyrollers\" or other  plantation boss would read the pass he would beat him nearly to death  and send him back. Of course the nigger could not read and did not know  what the pass said. You see, day did not 'low no nigger to have a book  or piece of paper of any kind and you know dey wuz not go teach any of  'em to read.    \"De women had it hard too; women with little babies would have to go to  work in de mornings with the rest, come back, nurse their chillun and go  back to the field, stay two or three hours then go back and eat dinner;  after dinner dey would have to go to de field and stay two or three more  hours then go and nurse the chillun again, go back to the field and stay  till night. One or maybe two old women would stay in a big house and  keep all de chillun while their mothers worked in de fields.    \"Now dey is a heap more I could tell maybe but I don't think of no more  now.\"    Mr. Gantling came to Florida to Jennings Plantation near Lake Park and  stayed two years, then went to Everett's Plantation and stayed one year.  From there he went to a place called High Hill and stayed two or three  years. He left there and went to Jasper, farmed and stayed until he  moved his family to Jacksonville. Here he worked on public works until  he started raising hogs and chickens which he continued up to about  fourteen years ago. Now, he is too old to do anything but just \"sit  around and talk and eat.\"    He lives with his daughter, Mrs. Minnie Holly and her husband, Mr. Dany  Holly on Lee Street.    Mr. Gantling cannot read or write, but is very interesting.    He has been a member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church for more  than fifty years.    He has a very good appetite and although has lost his teeth, he has  never worn a plate or had any dental work done. He is never sick and has  had but little medical attention during his lifetime. His form is bent  and he walks with a cane; although his going is confined to his home, it  is from choice as he seldom wears shoes on account of bad feet. His  eyesight is very good and his hobby is sewing. He threads his own  needles without assistance of glasses as he has never worn them.    Mr. Gantling celebrated his 89th birthday on the 20th day of November  1936.    He is very small, also very short; quite active for his age and of a  very genial disposition, always smiling.

As he puts it, he guesses he  could be called a 'conductor' on the underground railway, \"only we didn't  call it that then. I don't know as we called it anything--we just knew  there was a lot of slaves always a-wantin' to get free, and I had to  help 'em.\")    \"Most of the slaves didn't know when they was born, but I did. You see,  I was born on a Christmas mornin'--it was in 1840; I was a full grown  man when I finally got my freedom.\"    \"Before I got it, though, I helped a lot of others get theirs. Lawd only  knows how many; might have been as much as two-three hundred. It was  'way more than a hundred, I know.    \"But that all came after I was a young man--'grown' enough to know a  pretty girl when I saw one, and to go chasing after her, too. I was born  on a plantation that b'longed to Mr. Jack Tabb in Mason County, just  across the river in Kentucky.\"    \"Mr. Tabb was a pretty good man. He used to beat us, sure; but not  nearly so much as others did, some of his own kin people, even. But he  was kinda funny sometimes; he used to have a special slave who didn't  have nothin' to do but teach the rest of us--we had about ten on the  plantation, and a lot on the other plantations near us--how to read and  write and figger. Mr. Tabb liked us to know how to figger. But sometimes  when he would send for us and we would be a long time comin', he would  ask us where we had been. If we told him we had been learnin' to read,  he would near beat the daylights out of us--after gettin' somebody to  teach us; I think he did some of that so that the other owners wouldn't  say he was spoilin' his slaves.\"    \"He was funny about us marryin', too. He would let us go a-courtin' on  the other plantations near anytime we liked, if we were good, and if we  found somebody we wanted to marry, and she was on a plantation that  b'longed to one of his kin folks or a friend, he would swap a slave so  that the husband and wife could be together. Sometimes, when he couldn't  do this, he would let a slave work all day on his plantation, and live  with his wife at night on her plantation. Some of the other owners was  always talking about his spoilin' us.\"    \"He wasn't a Dimmacrat like the rest of 'em in the county; he belonged  to the 'know-nothin' party' and he was a real leader in it. He used to  always be makin' speeches, and sometimes his best friends wouldn't be  speaking to him for days at a time.\"    \"Mr. Tabb was always specially good to me. He used to let me go all  about--I guess he had to; couldn't get too much work out of me even when  he kept me right under his eyes. I learned fast, too, and I think he  kinda liked that. He used to call Sandy Davis, the slave who taught me,  'the smartest Nigger in Kentucky.'    \"It was 'cause he used to let me go around in the day and night so much  that I came to be the one who carried the runnin' away slaves over the  river. It was funny the way I started it too.\"    \"I didn't have no idea of ever gettin' mixed up in any sort of business  like that until one special night. I hadn't even thought of rowing  across the river myself.\"    \"But one night I had gone on another plantation 'courtin,' and the old  woman whose house I went to told me she had a real pretty girl there who  wanted to go across the river and would I take her? I was scared and  backed out in a hurry. But then I saw the girl, and she was such a  pretty little thing, brown-skinned and kinda rosy, and looking as scared  as I was feelin', so it wasn't long before I was listenin' to the old  woman tell me when to take her and where to leave her on the other  side.\"    \"I didn't have nerve enough to do it that night, though, and I told them  to wait for me until tomorrow night. All the next day I kept seeing  Mister Tabb laying a rawhide across my back, or shootin' me, and kept  seeing that scared little brown girl back at the house, looking at me  with her big eyes and asking me if I wouldn't just row her across to  Ripley. Me and Mr. Tabb lost, and soon as dust settled that night, I was  at the old lady's house.\"    \"I don't know how I ever rowed the boat across the river the current  was strong and I was trembling. I couldn't see a thing there in the  dark, but I felt that girl's eyes. We didn't dare to whisper, so I  couldn't tell her how sure I was that Mr. Tabb or some of the others  owners would 'tear me up' when they found out what I had done. I just  knew they would find out.\"    \"I was worried, too, about where to put her out of the boat. I couldn't  ride her across the river all night, and I didn't know a thing about the  other side. I had heard a lot about it from other slaves but I thought  it was just about like Mason County, with slaves and masters, overseers  and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12299"],[0,"The Mechanical Properties of Wood (#17)"],[1,"opposing forces; where the roots exercise  tension stresses most effectively the effect of compression  stresses is at a minimum; only where the pressure is in excess  of the tension, _i.e._, between the roots, can a separation of  the fibre result. Hence, when by frost a tension on the entire  periphery is established, and the wind localizes additional  strains, failure occurs. The stronger the compression and  tension, the severer the strains and the oftener failures occur.  The occurrence of reports of frost splits on wind-still days is  believed by Busse to be due to the opening of old frost splits  where the tension produced by the frost alone is sufficient.    Frost splits may heal over temporarily, but usually open up  again during the following winter. The presence of old splits is  often indicated by a ridge of callous, the result of the  cambium's effort to occlude the wound. Frost splits not only  affect the value of lumber, but also afford an entrance into the  living tree for disease and decay.        SHAKES, GALLS, PITCH POCKETS      _Heart shake_ occurs in nearly all overmature timber, being more  frequent in hardwoods (especially oak) than in conifers. In  typical heart shake the centre of the hole shows indications of  becoming hollow and radial clefts of varying size extend outward  from the pith, being widest inward. It frequently affects only  the butt log, but may extend to the entire hole and even the  larger branches. It usually results from a shrinkage of the  heartwood due probably to chemical changes in the wood.    When it consists of a single cleft extending across the pith it  is termed _simple heart shake_. Shake of this character in  straight-grained trees affects only one or two central boards  when cut into lumber, but in spiral-grained timber the damage is  much greater. When shake consists of several radial clefts it is  termed _star shake_. In some instances one or more of these  clefts may extend nearly to the bark. In felled or converted  timber clefts due to heart shake may be distinguished from  seasoning cracks by the darker color of the exposed surfaces.  Such clefts, however, tend to open up more and more as the  timber seasons.    _Cup_ or _ring shake_ results from the pulling apart of two or  more growth rings. It is one of the most serious defects to  which sound timber is subject, as it seriously reduces the  technical properties of wood. It is very common in sycamore and  in western larch, particularly in the butt portion. Its  occurrence is most frequent at the junction of two growth layers  of very unequal thickness. Consequently it is likely to occur in  trees which have grown slowly for a time, then abruptly  increased, due to improved conditions of light and food, as in  thinning. Old timber is more subject to it than young trees. The  damage is largely confined to the butt log. Cup shake is often  associated with other forms of shake, and not infrequently shows  traces of decay.    The causes of cup shake are uncertain. The swaying action of the  wind may result in shearing apart the growth layers, especially  in trees growing in exposed places. Frost may in some instances  be responsible for cup shake or at least a contributing factor,  although trees growing in regions free from frost often have  ring shake. Shrinkage of the heartwood may be concentric as well  as radial in its action, thus producing cup shake instead of, or  in connection with, heart shake.    A local defect somewhat similar in effect to cup shake is known  as _rind gall_. If the cambium layer is exposed by the removal  of the entire bark or rind it will die. Subsequent growth over  the damaged portion does not cohere with the wood previously  formed by the old cambium. The defect resulting is termed rind  gall. The most common causes of it are fire, gnawing, blazing,  chipping, sun scald, lightning, and abrasions.    _Heart break_ is a term applied to areas of compression failure  along the grain found in occasional logs. Sometimes these breaks  are invisible until the wood is manufactured into the finished  article. The occurrence of this defect is mostly limited to the  dense hardwoods, such as hickory and to heavy tropical species.  It is the source of considerable loss in the fancy veneer  industry, as the veneer from valuable logs so affected drops to  pieces.    The cause of heart break is not positively known. It is highly  probable, however, that when the tree is felled the trunk  strikes across a rock or another log, and the impact causes  actual failure in the log as in a beam.    _Resin_ or _pitch pockets_ are of common occurrence in the wood  of larch, spruce, fir, and especially of longleaf and other hard  pines. They are due to accumulations of resin in openings  between adjacent layers of growth. They are more frequent in  trees growing alone than in those of dense stands. The pockets  are usually a few inches in greatest dimension and affect only  one or two growth layers. They are hidden until exposed by the  saw, rendering it impossible to cut lumber with reference to  their position. Often several boards are damaged by a single  pocket. In grading lumber, pitch pockets are classified as  small, standard, and large, depending upon their width and  length.        INSECT INJURIES[37]      [Footnote 37: For detailed information regarding insect  injuries, the reader is referred to the various publications of  the U.S. Bureau of Entomology, Washington, D.C.]    The larvae of many insects are destructive to wood. Some attack  the wood of living trees, others only that of felled or  converted material. Every hole breaks the continuity of the  fibres and impairs the strength, and if there are very many of  them the material may be ruined for all purposes where strength  is required.    Some of the most common insects attacking the wood of living  trees are the oak timber worm, the chestnut timber worm,  carpenter worms, ambrosia beetles, the locust borer, turpentine  beetles and turpentine borers, and the white pine weevil.    The insect injuries to forest products may be classed according  to the stage of manufacture of the material. Thus round timber  with the bark on, such as poles, posts, mine props, and sawlogs,  is subject to serious damage by the same class of insects as  those mentioned above, particularly by the round-headed borers,  timber worms, and ambrosia beetles. Manufactured unseasoned  products are subject to damage from ambrosia beetles and other  wood borers. Seasoned hardwood lumber of all kinds, rough  handles, wagon stock, etc., made partially or entirely of  sapwood, are often reduced in value from 10 to 90 per cent by a  class of insects known as powder-post beetles. Finished hardwood  products such as handles, wagon, carriage and machinery stock,  especially if ash or hickory, are often destroyed by the  powder-post beetles. Construction timbers in buildings, bridges  and trestles, cross-ties, poles, mine props, fence posts, etc.,  are sometimes seriously injured by wood-boring larvae, termites,  black ants, carpenter bees, and powder-post beetles, and  sometimes reduced in value from 10 to 100 per cent. In tropical  countries termites are a very serious pest in this respect.        MARINE WOOD-BORER INJURIES      Vast amounts of timber used for piles in wharves and other  marine structures are constantly being destroyed or seriously  injured by marine borers. Almost invariably they are confined to  salt water, and all the woods commonly used for piling are  subject to their attacks. There are two genera of mollusks,  _Xylotrya_ and _Teredo_, and three of crustaceans, _Limnoria,  Chelura_, and _Sphoeroma_, that do serious damage in many places  along both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.    These mollusks, which are popularly known as \"shipworms,\" are  much alike in structure and mode of life. They attack the  exposed surface of the wood and immediately begin to bore. The  tunnels, often as large as a lead pencil, extend usually in a  longitudinal direction and follow a very irregular, tangled  course. Hard woods are apparently penetrated as readily as soft  woods, though in the same timber the softer parts are preferred.  The food consists of infusoria and is not obtained from the wood  substance. The sole object of boring into the wood is to obtain  shelter.    Although shipworms can live in cold water they thrive best and  are most destructive in warm water. The length of time required  to destroy an average barked, unprotected pine pile on the  Atlantic coast south from Chesapeake Bay and along the entire  Pacific coast varies from but one to three years.    Of the crustacean borers, _Limnoria_, or the \"wood louse,\" is  the only one of great importance, although _Sphoeroma_ is  reported destructive in places. _Limnoria_ is about the size of  a grain of rice and tunnels into the wood for both food and  shelter. The galleries extend inward radially, side by side, in  countless numbers, to the depth of about one-half inch. The thin  wood partitions remaining are destroyed by wave action, so that  a fresh surface is exposed to attack. Both hard and soft woods  are damaged, but the rate is faster in the soft woods or softer  portions of a wood.    Timbers seriously attacked by marine borers are badly weakened  or completely destroyed. If the original strength of the  material is to be preserved it is necessary to protect the wood  from the borers. This is sometimes accomplished by proper  injection of creosote oil, and more or less successfully by the  use of various kinds of external coatings.[38] No treatment,  however, has proved entirely satisfactory.
