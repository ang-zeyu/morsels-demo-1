Black Bart'll go with me. The dark don't bother him.\"    \"I'll go along.\"    \"I'd rather be alone. I might meet him.\"    \"Any way you want,\" said Calder, \"but first hear my plan--it doesn't  take long to tell it.\"    The darkness thickened around them while he talked. The fire died  out--the night swallowed up their figures.          CHAPTER XIII      THE LONE RIDERS ENTERTAIN    When Lee Haines rode into Silent's camp that evening no questions were  asked. Questions were not popular among the long riders. He did not  know more than the names of half the men who sat around the smoky  fire. They were eager to forget the past, and the only allusions  to former times came in chance phrases which they let fall at rare  intervals. When they told an anecdote they erased all names by  instinct. They would begin: \"I heard about a feller over to the Circle  Y outfit that was once ridin'--\" etc. As a rule they themselves were  \"that feller over to the Circle Y outfit.\" Accordingly only a few  grunts greeted Haines and yet he was far and away the most popular man  in the group. Even solemn-eyed Jim Silent was partial to the handsome  fellow.    \"Heard the whistling today?\" he asked.    Purvis shook his head and Terry Jordan allowed \"as how it was most  uncommon fortunate that this Barry feller didn't start his noise.\"  After this Haines ate his supper in silence, his ear ready to catch  the first sound of Kate's horse as it crashed through the willows and  shrubs. Nevertheless it was Shorty Rhinehart who sprang to his feet  first.    \"They's a hoss there comin' among the willows!\" he announced.    \"Maybe it's Silent,\" remarked Haines casually.    \"The chief don't make no such a noise. He picks his goin',\" answered  Hal Purvis.    The sound was quite audible now.    \"They's been some crooked work,\" said Rhinehart excitedly. \"Somebody's  tipped off the marshals about where we're lyin'.\"    \"All right,\" said Haines quietly, \"you and I will investigate.\"    They started through the willows. Rhinehart was cursing beneath his  breath.    \"Don't be too fast with your six-gun,\" warned Haines.    \"I'd rather be too early than too late.\"    \"Maybe it isn't a marshal. If a man were looking for us he'd be a fool  to come smashing along like that.\"    He had scarcely spoken when Kate came into view.    \"A girl, by God!\" said Rhinehart, with mingled relief and disgust.    \"Sure thing,\" agreed Haines.    \"Let's beat it back to the camp.\"    \"Not a hope. She's headed straight for the camp. We'll take her in and  tell her we're a bunch from the Y Circle X outfit headed north. She'll  never know the difference.\"    \"Good idea,\" said Rhinehart, and he added with a chuckle, \"it's been  nigh three months since I've talked to a piece of calico.\"    \"Hey, there!\" called Haines, and he stepped out with Rhinehart before  her horse.    \"Oh!\" cried Kate, reining up her horse sharply. \"Who are you?\"    \"A beaut!\" muttered Rhinehart in devout admiration.    \"We're from the Y Circle X outfit,\" said Haines glibly, \"camping over  here for the night. Are you lost, lady?\"    \"I guess I am. I thought I could get across the willows before the  night fell. I'm trying to find a man who rode in this direction.\"    \"Come on into the camp,\" said Haines easily. \"Maybe some of the boys  can put you on his track. What sort of a looking fellow is he?\"    \"Rides a black horse and whistles a good deal. His name is Barry. They  call him Whistling Dan.\"    \"By God!\" whispered Rhinehart in the ear of Haines.    \"Shut up!\" answered Haines in the same tone. \"Are you afraid of a  girl?\"    \"I've trailed him south this far,\" went on Kate, \"and a few miles away  from here I lost track of him. I think he may have gone on across the  willows.\"    \"Haven't seen him,\" said Rhinehart amiably. \"But come on to the camp,  lady. Maybe one of the boys has spotted him on the way. What's your  name?\"    \"Kate Cumberland,\" she answered.    He removed his hat with a broad grin and reached up a hand to her.    \"I'm most certainly glad to meet you, an' my name's Shorty. This here  is Lee. Want to come along with us?\"    \"Thank you. I'm a little worried.\"    \"'S all right. Don't get worried. We'll show you the way out. Just  follow us.\"    They started back through the willows, Kate following half a dozen  yards behind.    \"Listen here, Shorty,\" said Haines in a cautious voice. \"You heard her  name?\"    \"Sure.\"    \"Well, that's the daughter of the man that raised Whistling Dan. I  saw her at Morgan's place. She's probably been tipped off that he's  following Silent, but she has no idea who we are.\"    \"Sure she hasn't. She's a great looker, eh, Lee?\"    \"She'll do, I guess. Now get this: The girl is after Whistling Dan,  and if she meets him she'll persuade him to come back to her father's  place. She'll take him off our trail, and I guess none of us'll be  sorry to know that he's gone, eh?\"    \"I begin to follow you, Lee. You've always had the head!\"    \"All right. Now we'll get Purvis to tell the girl that he's heard a  peculiar whistling around here this evening. We'll advise her to stick  around and go out when she hears the whistling again. That way she'll  meet him and head him off, savvy?\"    \"Right,\" said Rhinehart.    \"Then beat it ahead as fast as you can and wise up the boys.\"    \"That's me--specially about their bein' Y Circle X fellers, eh?\"    He chuckled and made ahead as fast as his long legs could carry him.  Haines dropped back beside Kate.    \"Everything goes finely,\" he assured her. \"I told Rhinehart what to  do. He's gone ahead to the camp. Now all you have to do is to keep  your head. One of the boys will tell you that we've heard some  whistling near the camp this evening. Then I'll ask you to stay around  for a while in case the whistling should sound again, do you see?  Remember, never ask a question!\"    It was even more simple than Haines had hoped. Silent's men suspected  nothing. After all, Kate's deception was a small affair, and her  frankness, her laughter, and her beauty carried all before her.    The long riders became quickly familiar with her, but through their  rough talk, the Westerners' reverence for a woman ran like a thread of  gold over a dark cloth. Her fear lessened and almost passed away while  she listened to their talk and watched their faces. The kindly human  nature which had lain unexpressed in most of them for months together  burst out torrent-like and flooded about her with a sense of security  and power. These were conquerors of men, fighters by instinct and  habit, but here they sat laughing and chattering with a helpless girl,  and not a one of them but would have cut the others' throats rather  than see her come to harm. The roughness of their past and the dread  of their future they laid aside like an ugly cloak while they showed  her what lies in the worst man's heart--a certain awe of woman. Their  manners underwent a sudden change. Polite words, rusted by long  disuse, were resurrected in her honour. Tremendous phrases came  labouring forth. There was a general though covert rearranging of  bandanas, and an interchange of self-conscious glances. Haines alone  seemed impervious to her charm.    The red died slowly along the west. There was no light save the  flicker of the fire, which played on Kate's smile and the rich gold of  her hair, or caught out of the dark one of the lean, hard faces which  circled her. Now and then it fell on the ghastly grin of Terry Jordan  and Kate had to clench her hand to keep up her nerve.    It was deep night when Jim Silent rode into the clearing. Shorty  Rhinehart and Hal Purvis went to him quickly to explain the presence  of the girl and the fact that they were all members of the Y Circle  X outfit. He responded with nods while his gloomy eyes held fast on  Kate. When they presented him as the boss, Jim, he replied to her  good-natured greeting in a voice that was half grunt and half growl.          CHAPTER XIV      DELILAH    Haines muttered at Kate's ear: \"This is the man. Now keep up your  courage.\"    \"He doesn't like this,\" went on Haines in the same muffled voice, \"but  when he understands just why you're here I think he'll be as glad as  any of us.\"    Silent beckoned to him and he went to the chief.    \"What about the girl?\" asked the big fellow curtly.    \"Didn't Rhinehart tell you?\"    \"Rhinehart's a fool and so are the rest of them. Have you gone loco  too, Haines, to let a girl come here?\"    \"Where's the harm?\"    \"Why, damn it, she's marked every man here.\"    \"I let her in because she is trying to get hold of Whistling Dan.\"    \"Which no fool girl c'n take that feller off the trail. Nothin' but  lead can do that.\"    \"I tell you,\" said Haines, \"the boy's in love with her. I watched them  at Morgan's place. She can twist him around her finger.\"    A faint light broke the gloom of Silent's face.    \"Yaller hair an' blue eyes. They c'n do a lot. Maybe you're right.  What's that?\" His voice had gone suddenly husky.    A russet moon pushed slowly up through the trees. Its uncertain light  fell across the clearing. For the first time the thick pale smoke of  the fire was visible, rising straight up until it cleared the tops of  the willows, and then caught into swift, jagging lines as the soft  wind struck it. A coyote wailed from the distant hills, and before  his complaint was done another sound came through the hushing of the  willows, a melancholy whistling, thin with distance.    \"We'll see if that's the man you want,\" suggested Haines.    \"I'll go along,\" said Shorty Rhinehart.    \"And me too,\" said a third. The whole group would have accompanied  them, but the heavy voice of Jim Silent cut in: \"You'll stay here, all  of you except the girl and Lee.\"    They turned back, muttering, and Kate followed Haines into the  willows.    \"Well?\" growled"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10890"],[0,"Dio's Rome, Volume 5 (#17)"],[1,"of his adversary  (for they practically all knew one another and were well acquainted) and  would say: \"Comrade, take and eat this. I give you not a sword, but bread.  Take and drink: I hold toward you not a shield but a cup. For whether you  kill me or I you, this will afford us a more comfortable leave-taking, and  will save from feebleness and weakness the hand with which either you cut  me down or I you. These are the consecrated offerings that Vitellius and  Vespasian give us while we are yet alive, that they may sacrifice us to  the corpses of the past.\" That would be the style of their conversation,  after which they would rest a while, eat a bit, and then renew the battle.  Soon they would stop again, and then once more join in conflict.    [Sidenote:--14--] It went on this way the whole night through till dawn  broke. At that time two men of the Vespasian party wrought a notable  achievement. Their side was being severely damaged by an engine of some  sort, and these two, seizing shields from among the spoils of the  Vitellian faction, mingled with the opposing ranks, and made their way to  the engine without its being noticed that they did not belong to that  side. Thus they managed to cut the ropes of the affair, so that not  another missile could be discharged from it. As the sun was rising the  soldiers of the third legion, called the Gallic, that wintered in Syria  but was now by chance in the party of Vespasian, suddenly according to  custom saluted the Sun God. The followers of Vitellius, suspecting that  Mucianus had arrived, underwent a revulsion of feeling, and panic-stricken  at the shout took to flight. (Another instance of how the smallest things  can produce great alarm in men who are completely tired out). They retired  within the wall, from which they stretched forth their hands and made  supplications. As no one listened to them, they released the consul, and,  having arrayed him in his robe of office with the fasces, then sent him as  an intercessor. Thus they obtained a truce, for Alienus because of his  rank and the way he had been treated easily persuaded Primus to accept  their submission.    [Sidenote:--15--] When, however, the gates were opened and an amnesty had  been declared for all, suddenly soldiers came rushing in from all  directions and began plundering and setting fire to everything. This  catastrophe proved to be one of the greatest recorded. The city was  distinguished for the size and beauty of its buildings, and great sums of  money belonging to natives and to strangers had been accumulated there.  The larger portion of the harm was done by the Vitellians, since they knew  exactly which were the houses of the richest men and all about the  entrances on the alleys. They showed no scruples about destroying the  persons in whose behalf they had fought, but dealt blows, committed  murder, and acted as if it were they who had been wronged and had  conquered. Thus, counting those that fell in battle, five myriads perished  altogether.    [Sidenote:--16--] Vitellius, on learning of the defeat, was for a time  quite disturbed. Omens had contributed to make him uneasy. He had been  offering a certain sacrifice, and after it was addressing the soldiers,  when a lot of vultures swooped down, scattered the sacred meats, and  nearly knocked him from the platform. Accordingly, the news of the defeat  troubled him still more, and he quietly sent his brother to Tarracina, a  strong city, which the latter occupied. But when the generals of Vespasian  approached Rome he became alarmed and took his departure. He did nothing  and formed no plan, but in a state of terror was carried back and forth on  the billows of chance. One moment he was for clinging to the sovereignty  and he was making definite preparations for warfare: the next he was quite  willing to give it up and was definitely getting ready to live as a  private person. At times he wore the purple chlamys and girded on a sword:  again he assumed dark colored clothing. His public addresses both in the  palace and in the Forum were now of one tenor, now of another, first  urging battle and next terms of peace. At times he was inclined to  surrender himself for the public welfare, and later he would clasp his  child in his arms, kiss him, and hold him out to the people as if to  arouse their pity. Similarly he would dismiss the Pretorians and then send  for them again, would leave the palace to retire to his brother's house  and then return: in this way he dulled the enthusiasm of almost everybody  interested in him. Seeing him dashing hither and thither so frenziedly  they ceased to carry out commands with their usual diligence, and began to  consider their own interests as well as his. They ridiculed him a great  deal, especially when in the assemblies he proffered his sword to the  consuls and to the senators present as if to show that by this act he had  divested himself of the imperial office. No one of the above persons dared  to take it, and the bystanders jeered.    [Sidenote:--17--] In view of these conditions, when Primus at last drew  near, the consuls, Gaius Quintius Atticus and Gnaeus Caecilius Simplex,  together with Sabinus (a relative of Vespasian) and the other foremost men  held a consultation, the result of which was that they set out for the  palace in company with the soldiers that favored their cause, intending to  either persuade or force Vitellius to resign his position as emperor. They  encountered, however, the Celtae who were guarding him, and getting  decidedly the worst of the encounter they fled to the Capitol. Arrived  there they sent for Domitian, son of Vespasian, and his relatives, and put  themselves in a state of defence. The following day, when their  adversaries assailed them, they managed for a time to repulse them; but  when the environs of the Capitol were set on fire, its defenders were  beaten back by the flame. In this way the soldiers of Vitellius forced  their way up, slaughtered many of the resisting party, and after  plundering the whole stock of votive offerings burned down with other  structures the great temple. Sabinus and Atticus they arrested and sent  them to Vitellius. Domitian and the junior Sabinus had made their escape  from the Capitol at the first noise of conflict and by concealing  themselves in houses had succeeded in eluding observation.    [Sidenote:--18--] Those soldiers of Vespasian that were led by Quintus  Petilius Cerialis [Footnote: The epitome of Dio spells uniformly  _Cerealius_.] (one of the foremost senators and a relative of Vespasian  by marriage) and by Antonius Primus--for Mucianus had not yet overtaken  them--were by this time close at hand, and Vitellius fell into the depths  of terror. The oncoming leaders through the medium of certain messengers  and by placing their letters in coffins with dead bodies, in baskets full  of fruit, or the reed traps of bird-catchers, learned all that was being  done in the city and formed their plans accordingly. Now, when they saw  the blaze rising from the Capitol as from a beacon, they made haste. The  first of the two to approach the city with his cavalry was Cerialis, [and  he was defeated at the very entrance by being cut off with horsemen in a  narrow spot. However, he prevented any harm being done by his opponents.  For Vitellius, hoping that his proved superiority would afford him an  opportunity to make terms, restrained his soldiers]. And having convened  the senate he sent envoys chosen from that body together with the vestal  virgins to Cerialis as envoys.    [Sidenote:--19--] Since no one would listen to them and they came very  near losing their lives, the emissaries visited Primus, who was also at  last approaching; from him they secured an audience, but accomplished  nothing. For at this juncture his soldiers came angrily toward him and  overcame with ease the guard at the Tiber bridge. (When the latter took  their stand upon it and disputed their passage, the horsemen forded the  stream and fell upon them from the rear). After this various bodies of men  made assaults at various points and committed some of the most atrocious  deeds. All the behavior for which they censured Vitellius and his  followers, behavior which they pretended was the cause of the war between  them, they themselves repeated, slaying great numbers. Many of those  killed were struck with pieces of tiling from the roof or cut down in  alleyways while jostled about by a throng of adversaries. Thus as many as  fifty thousand human beings were destroyed during those days of carnage.    [Sidenote:--20--] So the city was being pillaged, and the men were some  fighting, some fleeing, some actually plundering and murdering by  themselves in order that they might be taken for the invaders and so  preserve their lives. Vitellius in dread put on a ragged, dirty, little  tunic and concealed himself in an obscure alcove where dogs were kept,  intending to run off during the night to Tarracina and join his brother.  But the soldiers found him after a short search, for he could not long be  sure of remaining hid, seeing that he had been emperor. They seized him, a  mass of shavings and blood--for the dogs had done him some harm  already--and stripping off his clothes they bound his hands behind his  back, put a rope around his neck and dragged from the palace the Caesar  who had reveled there. Down the Sacred Way they hauled the emperor who had  frequently paraded past in his chair of state. Then they conducted the  Augustus to the Forum, where he had often addressed the people. Some  buffeted him, some plucked at his beard, all ridiculed him, all insulted  him, laying especial stress in their remarks on his intemperance, since he  had an expansive paunch. [Sidenote:--21--] When in shame at this treatment  he kept his eyes lowered, the soldiers would prick him under the chin with  their daggers, to make him look up even against his"]]]
