Thus a noon-house became an absolute necessity to Puritan  health and existence, and often two or three were built near one  meeting-house; while in some towns, as in Bristol, a whole row of  disfiguring little \"Sabba-day houses\" stood on the meeting-house green,  and in them the farmers (as they quaintly expressed in their petitions for  permission to erect the buildings) \"kept their duds and horses.\"    In Derby, after several petitions had been granted to build noon-houses, it  was found necessary, in 1764, to place some restrictions as to the location  of the buildings, which had hitherto evidently been placed with the  characteristically Puritanical indifference to general convenience or  appearance. While the town still permitted the little log-huts to be  erected, and though they could be placed on either side of the highway, it  was ordered that the builders must not so locate them as to \"incommode any  highways.\" As early as 1690 the thoughtful Stonington people built a house  \"14 foot square and seven foot posts\" with a chimney at one side, for the  express purpose of having a place where their minister, Rev. Mr. Noyes,  could thaw out between services. The New Canaan Church built on the green  beside their meeting-house a fine \"Society House,\" twenty-one feet long  and sixteen feet wide, with a big chimney and fireplace. The horses were  plainly \"not in society\" in New Canaan, for they were excluded from the  occupancy and privileges of the Society House.    \"James June & all that lives at Larences\" were allowed to build a  \"Sabbath-House\" on the green near the New Britain meeting-house \"as a  Commodate for their conveniency of comeing to meeting on the Sabbath;\" at  the same time James Slason of the same village was given permission to \"set  yp a house for ye advantage of his having a place to go to\" on the Sabbath.  Frequently the petitions \"to build a Sabbath Day House\" or a \"Housel for  Shelter for Horss\" were made in company by several farmers for their joint  use and comfort, as shown by entries in the town and church records of  Norwalk, New Milford, Durham, and Hartford.    Noon-houses were much more frequent in Connecticut than in Massachusetts,  and in several small towns in the former State they were used weekly  between Sunday services until within the memory of persons now living;  and some of the buildings still exist, though changed into granaries or  stables. There was one also in use for many years and until recent years in  Topsfield, in Massachusetts. We chanced upon one still standing on a lonely  Narragansett road. A little enclosed burial-place, with moss-grown and  weather-smoothed head-stones and neglected graves, was by the side of a  filled-in cellar, upon which a church evidently had once stood. At a short  distance from the church-site was a long, low, gray, weather-beaten wooden  building, with a coarse stone-and-mortar chimney at one end, and a great  door at the other. Two small windows, destitute of glass, permitted us  to peer into the interior of this dilapidated old structure, and we saw  within, a floor of beaten earth, a rough stone fireplace, and a few rude  horse-stalls. We felt sure that this tumble-down building had been neither  a dwelling-house nor a stable, but a noon-house; and the occupants of a  neighboring farm-house confirmed our decision. Too worthless to destroy,  too out of the way to be of any use to any person, that old noon-house,  through neglect and isolation, has remained standing until to-day.    It was not until the use of chaises and wagons became universal, and the  new means of conveyance crowded out the old-fashioned saddle and pillion,  and the trotting horse superseded the once fashionable but quickly despised  pacer, that the great stretches of horse-sheds were built which now  surround and disfigure all our country churches. These sheds protect,  of course, both horse and carriage from wind and rain. Few churches had  horse-sheds until after the War of the Revolution, and some not until after  the War of 1812. In 1796 the Longmeadow Church had \"liberty to erect a  Horse House in the Meeting House Lane.\" This horse house was a horse-shed.    The \"wretched boys\" were not permitted even in these noon-houses to talk,  much less to \"sporte and playe.\" In some parishes it was ordered by the  minister and the deacons that the Bible should be read and expounded  to them, or a sermon be read to keep them quiet during the nooning.  Occasionally some old patriarch would explain to them the notes that he  had taken during the morning sermon. More unbearable still, the boys were  sometimes ordered to explain the notes which they had taken themselves. I  would I had heard some of those explanations! Thus they literally, as was  written in 1774, throve on the \"Good Fare of Brown Bread and the Gospell.\"    In Andover, Judge Phillips left in his will a silver flagon to the church  as an expression of interest and hope that the \"laudable practice of  reading between services may be continued so long as even a small number  shall be disposed to attend the exercise.\" Mr. Abbott left another silver  flagon to the Andover Church to encourage reading between services; though  how this piece of plate encouraged personally, since neither the deacons  nor the boys got it as a prize, cannot be precisely understood. The  noon-house in Andover was a large building with a great chimney and open  fireplace at either end. It has always seemed to me a piece of gratuitous  posthumous cruelty in Judge Phillips and Mr. Abbott to try to cheat those  Andover boys of their noon-time rest and relaxation, and to expect them,  wriggling and twisting with repressed vitality, to listen to a long extra  sermon, read perhaps by some unskilled reader, or explained by some  incapable expounder. The Sabbath-school did not then exist, and was not in  general favor until the noon-houses had begun to disappear. The Reverend  Jedediah Morse, father of the inventor of the electric telegraph, was  almost the first New England clergyman who approved of Sabbath-schools and  established them in his parish. In Salem they were opened in 1808, and the  scholars came at half-past six on Sunday mornings. Fancy the chill and  gloom of the unheated, ill-lighted churches at that hour on winter  mornings. The \"Salem Gazette\" openly characterized Sunday-schools, when  first suggested, as profanations of the Sabbath, and for years they were  not allowed in many Congregational churches. When the Sabbath-schools  were universally established, and thus the attention and interest of the  children was gained during the noon interval (the time the schools were  usually held in country churches), and when each family sat in its own pew,  and thus the boys were separated, and each under his parents' guardianship,  the \"wretched boys\" of the Puritan Sabbath disappeared, and well-behaved,  quiet, orderly boys were seen instead in the New England churches.    This fashion of sermon-reading at the nooning happily did not obtain in  all parts of New England. In many villages the meetings in the society  noon-houses were to the townspeople what a Sunday newspaper is to Sunday  readers now-a-days, an advertisement and exposition of all the news of the  past week, and also a suggestion of events to come. At noon they discussed  and wondered at the announcements and publishings which were tacked on  the door of the meeting-house or the notices that had been read from the  pulpit. The men talked in loud voices of the points of the sermon, of the  doctrines of predestination pedobaptism and antipedobaptism, of original  sin, and that most fascinating mystery, the unpardonable sin, and in lower  voices of wolf and bear killing, of the town-meeting, the taxes, the crops  and cattle; and they examined with keen interest one another's horses,  and many a sly bargain in horse-flesh or exchange of cows and pigs was  suggested, bargained over, and clinched in the \"Sabba'-day house.\" Many a  piece of village electioneering was also discussed and \"worked\" between the  services. The shivering women crowded around the blazing and welcome fire,  and seated themselves on rude benches and log seats while they ate and  exchanged doughnuts, slices of rusk, or pieces of \"pumpkin and Indian mixt\"  pie, and also gave to each other receipts therefor; and they discoursed  in low voices of their spinning and weaving, of their candle-dipping  or candle-running, of their success or failure in that yearly trial of  patience and skill--their soap-making, of their patterns in quilt-piecing,  and sometimes they slyly exchanged quilt-patterns. A sentence in an old  letter reads thus: \"Anne Bradford gave to me last Sabbath in the Noon House  a peecing of the Blazing Star; tis much Finer than the Irish Chain or the  Twin Sisters. I want yelloe peeces for the first joins, small peeces will  do. I will send some of my lilac flowered print for some peeces of Cicelys  yelloe India bed vallants, new peeces not washed peeces.\" They gave one  another medical advice and prescriptions of \"roots and yarbs\" for their  \"rheumatiz,\" \"neuralgy,\" and \"tissick;\" and some took snuff together, while  an ancient dame smoked a quiet pipe. And perhaps (since they were women as  well as Puritans) they glanced with envy, admiration, or disapproval, or  at any rate with close scrutiny, at one another's gowns and bonnets and  cloaks, which the high-walled pews within the meeting-house had carefully  concealed from any inquisitive, neighborly view.    The wood for these beneficent noon-house fires was given by the farmers  of the congregation, a load by each well-to-do land-owner, if it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/87"],[0,"The 1993 CIA World Factbook (#16)"],[1,"*Atlantic Ocean, Government    Digraph:   ZH    *Atlantic Ocean, Economy    Overview:    Economic activity is limited to exploitation of natural resources,    especially fish, dredging aragonite sands (The Bahamas), and crude oil and    natural gas production (Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and North Sea).    *Atlantic Ocean, Communications    Ports:    Alexandria (Egypt), Algiers (Algeria), Antwerp (Belgium), Barcelona (Spain),    Buenos Aires (Argentina), Casablanca (Morocco), Colon (Panama), Copenhagen    (Denmark), Dakar (Senegal), Gdansk (Poland), Hamburg (Germany), Helsinki    (Finland), Las Palmas (Canary Islands, Spain), Le Havre (France), Lisbon    (Portugal), London (UK), Marseille (France), Montevideo (Uruguay), Montreal    (Canada), Naples (Italy), New Orleans (US), New York (US), Oran (Algeria),    Oslo (Norway), Piraeus (Greece), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Rotterdam    (Netherlands), Saint Petersburg (formerly Leningrad; Russia), Stockholm    (Sweden)  Telecommunications:    numerous submarine cables with most between continental Europe and the UK,    North America and the UK, and in the Mediterranean; numerous direct links    across Atlantic via INTELSAT satellite network  Note:    Kiel Canal and Saint Lawrence Seaway are two important waterways    *Australia, Geography    Location:    Oceania, between Indonesia and New Zealand  Map references:    Southeast Asia, Oceania, Antarctic Region, Standard Time Zones of the World  Area:   total area:    7,686,850 km2   land area:    7,617,930 km2   comparative area:    slightly smaller than the US   note:    includes Macquarie Island  Land boundaries:    0 km  Coastline:    25,760 km  Maritime claims:   contiguous zone:    12 nm   continental shelf:    200 m (depth) or to depth of exploitation   exclusive fishing zone:    200 nm   territorial sea:    12 nm  International disputes:    territorial claim in Antarctica (Australian Antarctic Territory)  Climate:    generally arid to semiarid; temperate in south and east; tropical in north  Terrain:    mostly low plateau with deserts; fertile plain in southeast  Natural resources:    bauxite, coal, iron ore, copper, tin, silver, uranium, nickel, tungsten,    mineral sands, lead, zinc, diamonds, natural gas, petroleum  Land use:   arable land:    6%   permanent crops:    0%   meadows and pastures:    58%   forest and woodland:    14%   other:    22%  Irrigated land:    18,800 km2 (1989 est.)
