This has been the case in the long disputed question concerning  liberty and necessity; and to so remarkable a degree that, if I be not  much mistaken, we shall find, that all mankind, both learned and  ignorant, have always been of the same opinion with regard to this  subject, and that a few intelligible definitions would immediately have  put an end to the whole controversy. I own that this dispute has been so  much canvassed on all hands, and has led philosophers into such a  labyrinth of obscure sophistry, that it is no wonder, if a sensible  reader indulge his ease so far as to turn a deaf ear to the proposal of  such a question, from which he can expect neither instruction or  entertainment. But the state of the argument here proposed may, perhaps,  serve to renew his attention; as it has more novelty, promises at least  some decision of the controversy, and will not much disturb his ease by  any intricate or obscure reasoning.    I hope, therefore, to make it appear that all men have ever agreed in  the doctrine both of necessity and of liberty, according to any  reasonable sense, which can be put on these terms; and that the whole  controversy has hitherto turned merely upon words. We shall begin with  examining the doctrine of necessity.    64. It is universally allowed that matter, in all its operations, is  actuated by a necessary force, and that every natural effect is so  precisely determined by the energy of its cause that no other effect, in  such particular circumstances, could possibly have resulted from it. The  degree and direction of every motion is, by the laws of nature,  prescribed with such exactness that a living creature may as soon arise  from the shock of two bodies as motion in any other degree or direction  than what is actually produced by it. Would we, therefore, form a just  and precise idea of _necessity_, we must consider whence that idea  arises when we apply it to the operation of bodies.    It seems evident that, if all the scenes of nature were continually  shifted in such a manner that no two events bore any resemblance to each  other, but every object was entirely new, without any similitude to  whatever had been seen before, we should never, in that case, have  attained the least idea of necessity, or of a connexion among these  objects. We might say, upon such a supposition, that one object or event  has followed another; not that one was produced by the other. The  relation of cause and effect must be utterly unknown to mankind.  Inference and reasoning concerning the operations of nature would, from  that moment, be at an end; and the memory and senses remain the only  canals, by which the knowledge of any real existence could possibly have  access to the mind. Our idea, therefore, of necessity and causation  arises entirely from the uniformity observable in the operations of  nature, where similar objects are constantly conjoined together, and the  mind is determined by custom to infer the one from the appearance of the  other. These two circumstances form the whole of that necessity, which  we ascribe to matter. Beyond the constant _conjunction_ of similar  objects, and the consequent _inference_ from one to the other, we have  no notion of any necessity or connexion.    If it appear, therefore, that all mankind have ever allowed, without any  doubt or hesitation, that these two circumstances take place in the  voluntary actions of men, and in the operations of mind; it must follow,  that all mankind have ever agreed in the doctrine of necessity, and that  they have hitherto disputed, merely for not understanding each other.    65. As to the first circumstance, the constant and regular conjunction  of similar events, we may possibly satisfy ourselves by the following  considerations. It is universally acknowledged that there is a great  uniformity among the actions of men, in all nations and ages, and that  human nature remains still the same, in its principles and operations.  The same motives always produce the same actions. The same events follow  from the same causes. Ambition, avarice, self-love, vanity, friendship,  generosity, public spirit: these passions, mixed in various degrees, and  distributed through society, have been, from the beginning of the world,  and still are, the source of all the actions and enterprises, which have  ever been observed among mankind. Would you know the sentiments,  inclinations, and course of life of the Greeks and Romans? Study well  the temper and actions of the French and English: You cannot be much  mistaken in transferring to the former _most_ of the observations which  you have made with regard to the latter. Mankind are so much the same,  in all times and places, that history informs us of nothing new or  strange in this particular. Its chief use is only to discover the  constant and universal principles of human nature, by showing men in all  varieties of circumstances and situations, and furnishing us with  materials from which we may form our observations and become acquainted  with the regular springs of human action and behaviour. These records of  wars, intrigues, factions, and revolutions, are so many collections of  experiments, by which the politician or moral philosopher fixes the  principles of his science, in the same manner as the physician or  natural philosopher becomes acquainted with the nature of plants,  minerals, and other external objects, by the experiments which he forms  concerning them. Nor are the earth, water, and other elements, examined  by Aristotle, and Hippocrates, more like to those which at present lie  under our observation than the men described by Polybius and Tacitus are  to those who now govern the world.    Should a traveller, returning from a far country, bring us an account of  men, wholly different from any with whom we were ever acquainted; men,  who were entirely divested of avarice, ambition, or revenge; who knew no  pleasure but friendship, generosity, and public spirit; we should  immediately, from these circumstances, detect the falsehood, and prove  him a liar, with the same certainty as if he had stuffed his narration  with stories of centaurs and dragons, miracles and prodigies. And if we  would explode any forgery in history, we cannot make use of a more  convincing argument, than to prove, that the actions ascribed to any  person are directly contrary to the course of nature, and that no human  motives, in such circumstances, could ever induce him to such a conduct.  The veracity of Quintus Curtius is as much to be suspected, when he  describes the supernatural courage of Alexander, by which he was hurried  on singly to attack multitudes, as when he describes his supernatural  force and activity, by which he was able to resist them. So readily and  universally do we acknowledge a uniformity in human motives and actions  as well as in the operations of body.    Hence likewise the benefit of that experience, acquired by long life and  a variety of business and company, in order to instruct us in the  principles of human nature, and regulate our future conduct, as well as  speculation. By means of this guide, we mount up to the knowledge of  men's inclinations and motives, from their actions, expressions, and  even gestures; and again descend to the interpretation of their actions  from our knowledge of their motives and inclinations. The general  observations treasured up by a course of experience, give us the clue of  human nature, and teach us to unravel all its intricacies. Pretexts and  appearances no longer deceive us. Public declarations pass for the  specious colouring of a cause. And though virtue and honour be allowed  their proper weight and authority, that perfect disinterestedness, so  often pretended to, is never expected in multitudes and parties; seldom  in their leaders; and scarcely even in individuals of any rank or  station. But were there no uniformity in human actions, and were every  experiment which we could form of this kind irregular and anomalous, it  were impossible to collect any general observations concerning mankind;  and no experience, however accurately digested by reflection, would ever  serve to any purpose. Why is the aged husbandman more skilful in his  calling than the young beginner but because there is a certain  uniformity in the operation of the sun, rain, and earth towards the  production of vegetables; and experience teaches the old practitioner  the rules by which this operation is governed and directed.    66. We must not, however, expect that this uniformity of human actions  should be carried to such a length as that all men, in the same  circumstances, will always act precisely in the same manner, without  making any allowance for the diversity of characters, prejudices, and  opinions. Such a uniformity in every particular, is found in no part of  nature. On the contrary, from observing the variety of conduct in  different men, we are enabled to form a greater variety of maxims, which  still suppose a degree of uniformity and regularity.    Are the manners of men different in different ages and countries? We  learn thence the great force of custom and education, which mould the  human mind from its infancy and form it into a fixed and established  character. Is the behaviour and conduct of the one sex very unlike that  of the other? Is it thence we become acquainted with the different  characters which nature has impressed upon the sexes, and which she  preserves with constancy and regularity? Are the actions of the same  person much diversified in the different periods of his life, from  infancy to old age? This affords room for many general observations  concerning the gradual change of our sentiments and inclinations, and  the different maxims which prevail in the different ages of human  creatures. Even the characters, which are peculiar"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9666"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 497, July 11, 1885 (#16)"],[1,"write. The pencil maybe mastered just  as readily as the pen. It is a simpler tool. The child draws before  he writes, and savages begin their language with pictures; but, we  wiseacres of this age of books let our young folks drop their slate  pencils and their Fabers, and practice with their Gillotts and their  Esterbrooks. Let us say, in every school and in every house, the child  must not only learn to read and write, he must learn to draw. We cannot  afford to let our young folks grow up without this power. A new French  book is just now much talked about, with this droll title, \"The Life  of a Wise Man, by an Ignoramus.\" It is the story of the great Pasteur,  whose discoveries in respect to life have made him world renowned. I  turned to the book, eager to find out the key to such success, and  I found the old story--\"the child was father of the man.\" This  philosopher, whose eye is so skilled in observing nature, and whose hand  is so apt in experiments, is the boy grown up whose pictures were so  good that the villagers thought him at thirteen an artist of rank.    Girls should learn the first lesson of hand-craft with the needle; boys  may (and they will always prize the knowledge), but girls must. It is  wise that our schools are going back to old fashioned ways, and saying  that girls must be taught to sew.    Boys should practice their hands upon the knife. John Bull used to laugh  at Brother Jonathan for whittling, and Mr. Punch always drew the Yankee  with a blade in his fingers; but they found out long ago in Great  Britain that whittling in this land led to something, a Boston notion,  a wooden clock, a yacht America, a labor-saving machine, a cargo of  wooden-ware, a shop full of knick-knacks, an age of inventions. Boys  need not be kept back to the hand-craft of the knife. For in-doors there  are the type case and printing press, the paint box, the tool box, the  lathe; and for out doors, the trowel, the spade, the grafting knife. It  matters not how many of the minor arts the youth acquires. The more the  merrier. Let each one gain the most he can in all such ways; for arts  like these bring no harm in their train; quite otherwise, they lure good  fortune to their company.    Play, as well as work, may bring out hand-craft. The gun, the bat, the  rein, the rod, the oar, all manly sports, are good training for the  hand. Walking insures fresh air, but it does not train the body or mind  like games and sports which are played out of doors. A man of great fame  as an explorer and as a student of nature (he who discovered, in the  West, bones of horses with two, three, and four toes, and who found the  remains of birds with teeth) once told me that his success was largely  due to the sports of his youth. His boyish love of fishing gave him his  manly skill in exploration.    I speak as if hand-craft was to be learned by sport. So it may. It may  also be learned by labor. Day by day for weeks I have been watching from  my study window a stately inn rise from the cellar just across the road.  A bricklayer has been there employed whose touch is like the stroke of  an artist. He handled each brick as if it were porcelain, balanced it  carefully in his hand, measured with his eye just the amount of mortar  which it needed, and dropped the block into its bed, without staining  its edge, without varying from the plumb line, by a stroke of hand-craft  as true as the sculptor's. Toil gave him skill.    The second point I make is this: If you really value hand-craft,  buy that which shows hand-craft, encourage those who are engaged in  hand-craft, help on with your voice and with your pocket, those who  bring taste and skill and art into the works of their hand. If your  means are so small that you only buy what you need for your daily wants,  you cannot have much choice, you must buy that which is cheapest; but  hardly any one within the sound of my voice is so restricted as that;  almost if not quite every one buys something every year for his  pleasure, a curtain, a rug, a wall paper, a chair, or a table not  certainly needed, a vase, a clock, a, mantel ornament, a piece of  jewelry, a portrait, an etching, a picture. Now whenever you make such a  purchase, to please your taste, to make your parlor or your chamber more  attractive, choose that which shows good handiwork. Such a choice will  last. You will not tire of it as you will of that which has but a  commonplace form or pattern.    I come now to a third point. That which has just been said applies  chiefly to things whose price is fixed by beauty. But handicraft gives  us many works not pleasing to the eye, yet of the highest skill--a  Jacquard loom, a Corliss engine, a Hoe printing press, a Winchester  rifle, an Edison dynamo, a Bell telephone. Ruskin may scout the work of  machinery, and up to a certain point may take us with him. Let us  allow that works of art marked by the artist's own touch--the gates of  Paradise by Ghiberti, a shield by Cellini, a statue by Michael Angelo,  are better than all reproductions and imitations, better than plaster  casts by Eichler, electrotypes by Barbedienne, or chromos by Prang. But  even Ruskin cannot suppress the fact that machinery brings to every  thrifty cottage in New England comforts and adornments which, in the  days of Queen Bess, were not known outside of the palace. Be mindful,  then, that handicraft makes machines which are wonders of productive  force--weaving tissues such as Penelope never saw, of woolen, cotton,  linen, and silk, to carpet our floors, cover our tables, cushion our  chairs, and clothe our bodies; machines of which Vulcan never dreamed,  to point a needle, bore a rifle, cut a watch wheel, or rule a series  of lines, measuring forty thousand to an inch, with sureness which the  unaided hand can never equal. Machinery is a triumph of handicraft as  truly as sculpture and architecture. The fingers which can plan and  build a steamship or a suspension bridge, which can make the Quinebaug  and the Blackstone turn spindles by the hundred thousand, which can turn  a rag heap into spotless paper, and make myriads of useful and artful  articles from rough metal, are fingers which this age alone has evolved.  The craft which makes useful things cheap can make cheap things  beautiful. The Japanese will teach us how to form and finish, if we do  not first teach them how to slight and sham.    A fourth point is this. If hand-craft is of such worth, boys and girls  must be trained in it. This, I am well aware is no new thought. Forty  years ago schools of applied science were added to Harvard and Yale  colleges; twenty years ago Congress gave enough land-scrip to aid in  founding at least one such school in every state; men of wealth, like  many whom you have known and whom you honor, have given large sums for  like ends. Now the people at large are waking up. They see their needs;  they have the means to supply what they want. Is there the will? Know  they the way? Far and near the cry is heard for a different training  from that now given in the public schools. Many are trying to find it.  Almost every large town has its experiment--and many smaller places have  theirs. Nobody seems to know just what is best. Even the words which  express the want are vague. Bright and thoughtful people differ as to  what might, can, and should be done. A society has been formed in New  York to bring together the needed data. The Slater trustees, charged  with the care of a large fund for the training of freedmen, have said  that manual training must be given in all the schools they aid. The  town of Toledo in Ohio opened, some time since, a school of practical  training for boys, which worked so well that another has lately been  opened for girls. St. Louis is doing famously. Philadelphia has several  experiments in progress. Baltimore has made a start. In New York there  are many noteworthy movements--half a dozen at least full of life and  hope. Boston was never behindhand in knowledge, and in the new education  is very alert, the efforts of a single lady deserving praise of high  degree. These are but signs of the times.    Some things may be set down as fixed; for example, most of those who  have thought on this theme will agree on the points I am about to name,  though they may or may not like the names which I venture to propose:    1. Kindergarten work should be taught in the nurseries and infant  schools of rich and poor.    2. Drawing should be taught in schools of every grade, till the hand  uses the pencil as readily as the pen.    3. Every girl at school if not at home should learn to sew.    4. Every boy should learn the use of tools, the gardener's or the  carpenter's, or both.    5. Well planned exercises, fitted to strengthen the various bodily  organs, arms, fingers, wrists, lungs, etc., are good. Driving, swimming,  rowing, and other manly sports should be favored.    What precedes is at the basis of good work.    In addition:    6. With good teachers, quite young children may learn the minor  decorative arts, carving, leather stamping, brass beating and the like,  as is shown in the Leland classes of Philadelphia.    7. In towns, boys who begin to earn a living when they enter their teens  may be taught in evening schools to practice the craft of carpentry,  bricklaying, plastering, plumbing, gas fitting, etc., as is shown  successfully in the Auchmuty schools of New York. Trade schools they are  called; schools of practice for workmen would be a better name.    8. Boys who can carry their studies through the later teens may learn,  while at the high school or technical school or college, to work in wood  and metals with precision, as I have lately seen in the College of the  City of New York, at Cornell University, and elsewhere-colleges or high  schools with work-shops and practice classes. If they can take the  time to fit themselves to be foremen and leaders in machine shops and"]]]
