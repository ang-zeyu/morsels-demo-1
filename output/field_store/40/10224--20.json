Until  Russia becomes a federation of several separate democratic States, and  the Tsar is either promoted to the honourable position of hereditary  President or else totally abolished, the eastern boundary of the League  of Peace must be the eastern boundary of Swedish, German, and Italian  civilization; and Poland must stand between it and the quite different  and for the moment unassimilable, civilization of Russia, whose  friendship we could not really keep on any other terms, as a closer  alliance would embarrass her as much as it would embarrass us.  Meanwhile, we must trust to the march of Democracy to de-Russianize  Berlin and de-Prussianize Petrograd, and to put the nagaikas of the  Cossacks and the riding-whips with which Junker officers slash German  privates, and the forty tolerated homosexual brothels of Berlin, and all  the other psychopathic symptoms of overfeeding and inculcated insolence  and sham virility in their proper place, which I take to be the dustbin.      *Driving Capital Out of the Country*.    But I must here warn everyone concerned that the most formidable  opposition to the break-up of these unnatural alliances between east and  west, between Democracy and Autocracy, between the twentieth century and  the Dark Ages, will not come from the Balancers of Power. They are not  really Balance of Power alliances: in fact, they are tending to an  enormous overbalance of power in favor of the east as against the west  and in favor of Militarist Autocracy as against Democracy. They are at  root absolutely unpatriotic, even absolutely conscienceless products of  commercial finance; and the Balance of Power theories are only the  attempts of our diplomats to put a public spirited face on the  operations of private cupidity. This is not the first time nor the  second that I have had to urge that the greatest danger to us in the  sphere of foreign politics is the tendency of capital to run away from  civilization: the one running downhill to hell as naturally as the other  struggles uphill to the Celestial City. The Englishman is allowed to  produce the subsistence of himself and his family only on condition that  he produces the subsistence of the capitalist and his retainers as well;  and lo! he finds more and more that these retainers are not Englishmen,  but Russians, South Americans, Kaffirs, Persians, or yellow or black  barbarians armed for his destruction (not to mention Prussians and  Austrians), and that the treaties made by our diplomatists have less and  less to do with the security of the nation or the balance of power or  any other public business, and more and more with capitalist  opportunities of making big dividends out of slavish labour. For  instance, the Anglo-Russian agreement is not a national treaty: it is  the memorandum of a commercial agreement settling what parts of Persia  are to be exploited by the Russian and English capitalists respectively;  the capitalists, always against State interference for the benefit of  the people, being very strongly in favor of it for coercing strikers at  home and keeping foreign rivals off their grass abroad. And the absurd  part of it is that when the State has thus arranged for our capitalists  to exploit certain parts of Persia, and for their sakes to protect the  parliamentary liberties of the part left to Russia, they discovered  that, after all, the most profitable game was to lend Russia the money  to exploit with, and to facilitate the operation by allowing her to  destroy the Persian parliament in the face of our own exhortation to it  to keep the flag flying, which we accordingly did without a blush. The  French capitalists had dragged France into an alliance with Russia long  before this; but the French Republic had the excuse of the German peril  and the need for an anti-German ally. Her natural ally for that purpose  was England; but as there was no market in England for her money, her  plutocrats drove her into the alliance with Russia as well; and it is  that alliance and not the alliance with England that has terrified  Germany into flying at her throat and plunging Europe into a frightful  war. The natural alliance with England twice averted war: in the  Moroccan crises of Algeciras and Agadir, when Sir Edward Grey said  boldly that we should defend France, and took the first steps towards a  joint military and naval control of the French and English forces. Why  he shrank from that firm position last July and thereby led Germany to  count so fatally on our neutrality I do not pretend to know; it suffices  for my argument that we were able to hold the balance between France and  Germany, but failed to hold it between Germany and Russia, and that it  was the placing of Russian loans in France and England that brought  Russia into our western affairs. It would have paid us ten times over to  have made Russia a present of all we and France have lent her  (indemnifying, of course, the holders of the stock through an addition  to the income tax) rather than pay the price of a European war. But what  is the use of crying for spilt milk? I am merely explaining why, when  French money went to Russia, the French papers discovered that the  Russians were a most interesting people and their Government--properly  understood--a surprisingly Liberal Government; and why, when English  money went to Russia, the English press suddenly developed leanings  towards the Greek Church, and deplored the unofficial execution of  Stolypin as deeply as it had rejoiced in the like fate of Bobrikoff. The  upshot of it all is that western civilization is at present busy  committing suicide by machinery, and importing hordes of Asiatics and  Africans to help in the throat cutting, not for the benefit of the silly  capitalists, who are being ruined wholesale, but to break up the  Austrian Empire for the benefit of Russia and the Slavs of eastern  Europe, which may be a very desirable thing, but which could and should  be done by the eastern Powers among themselves, without tearing Belgium  and Germany and France and England to pieces in the process.      *The Red Flag and the Black.*    Will you now at last believe, O stupid British, German, and French  patriots, what the Socialists have been telling you for so many years:  that your Union Jacks and tricolours and Imperial Eagles (\"where the  carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered\") are only toys to keep  you amused, and that there are only two real flags in the world  henceforth: the red flag of Democratic Socialism and the black flag of  Capitalism, the flag of God and the flag of Mammon? What earthly or  heavenly good is done when Tom Fool shoots Hans Narr? The plain fact is  that if we leave our capital to be dealt with according to the  selfishness of the private man he will send it where wages are low and  workers enslaved and docile: that is, as many thousand miles as possible  from the Trade Unions and Trade Union rates and parliamentary Labour  Parties of civilization; and Germany, at his sordid behest, will plunge  the world into war for the sake of disgracing herself with a few rubber  plantations, poetically described by her orators and journalists as \"a  place in the sun.\" When you do what the Socialists tell you by keeping  your capital jealously under national control and reserving your  shrapnel for the wasters who not only shirk their share of the  industrial service of their country, but intend that their children and  children's children shall be idle wasters like themselves, you will find  that not a farthing of our capital will go abroad as long as there is a  British slum to be cleared and rebuilt, or a hungry, ragged, and  ignorant British child to be fed, clothed, and educated.      *A League of Peace*.    But in the west I see no insuperable obstacle to a Treaty of Peace in  the largest sense. This war has smoothed the way to it, if I may use the  word smoothing to describe a process conduced with so little courtesy  and so much shrapnel. Germany has now learned--and the lesson was  apparently needed, obvious as it would have been to a sanely governed  nation--that when it comes to shoving and shooting, Germany instantly  loses all the advantages of her high civilization, because France and  England, cultured or uncultured, can shove and shoot as well or beter  than she, whilst as to slashing and stabbing, their half barbarous Turco  and Ghoorka slaves can cut the Prussian Guard to bits, in spite of the  unquestionable superiority of Wagner's music to theirs. Then take  France. She does not dream that she could fight Germany and England  single-handed. And England could not fight France and Germany without a  sacrifice as ruinous as it would be senseless. We therefore have the  necessary primary conditions for a League of Peace between the three  countries; for if one of them break it, the other two can make her  sorry, under which circumstances she will probably not break it. The  present war, if it end in the reconquest of Alsace and Lorraine by the  French, will make such a League much more stable; not that France can  acquire by mere conquest any right to hold either province against its  will (which could be ascertained by plebiscite), but because the honors  of war as between France and Germany would then be easy, France having  regained her laurels and taught Germany to respect her, without  obliterating the record of Germany's triumph in 1870. And if the war  should further result in the political reconstruction of the German  Empire as a democratic Commonwealth, and the conquest by the English  people of democratic control of English foreign policy, the combination  would be immensely eased and strengthened, besides being brought into  harmony with American public feeling, which is important to the security  and prestige of the League.      *The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1364"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Locomotive; Or, Two Miles a Minute on the Rails (#17)"],[1,"was. It was on the same  road as this train they were traveling in, and, although on a different  track, it was not many miles ahead. In fact, if the two trains kept to  schedule, the transcontinental passenger train would pass the freight  in question about five o'clock in the morning.    It lacked half an hour of that time when the Pullman train came  suddenly to a jolting stop. Both Tom and Ned were awakened with the  rest of the passengers in their coach.    Heads were poked out between curtains all along the aisle and a chorus  of more or less excited voices demanded:    \"What's the matter?\"    \"Nothin's the matter wid dis train, gen'lemens an' ladies,\" came in the  porter's important voice. \"Jest nothin' at all's happened. It's done  happened up ahead of us, das all.\"    \"Well, what has happened ahead of us, George?\" asked Ned.    \"Jest another train, Boss, been splatterin' itself all ober de right of  way. We sort o' bein' held up, das all,\" replied the porter.    \"That's good news--for us,\" said Ned, preparing to climb back into his  berth. But he halted where he was when he heard his chum ask:    \"What train left the track, George?\"    \"A freight train, sah. Yes, sah. Number Forty-eight. She jumped de  rails, side-swiped de accommodation dat was holdin' us back, and has  jest done spread herself all over de right of way.\"    \"My goodness!\" gasped Ned.    \"Hear that, Ned?\" exclaimed Tom. \"Scramble into your clothes, boy. The  Hercules Three-Oughts-One is hitched to Forty-eight.\"    \"Suppose she's off the track?\" murmured Ned.    \"It's lucky if she isn't smashed to matchwood,\" groaned Tom, and almost  immediately left the Pullman coach on the run.    Ned was not far behind him. When they reached the cinder path beside  the freight train it was just sunrise. Long arms of rosy light reached  down the mountain side to linger on the tracks and what was strewed  across them. A glance assured the two young fellows from the East that  it was a bad smash indeed.    Several of the rear boxcars were slung athwart the passenger tracks.  The passenger train that had been ahead of the Pullman train on which  Tom and Ned rode, had been badly beaten in all along its side. Scarcely  a whole window was left on the inner side of the five cars. But those  cars were not derailed. It was merely some of the freight cars that  retarded the further progress of the transcontinental flyer. A derrick  car must be brought up to lift away the debris before the fast train  could move on.    Tom and Ned walked forward along the length of the wreck.  Suddenly the  anxious young inventor seized Ned's arm.    \"Glory be!\" he ejaculated. \"It's topside up, anyway.\"    \"The Hercules Three-Oughts-One?\" gasped Ned.    \"That's what it is!\"    Tom quickened his pace, and his financial manager followed close upon  his heels. The forward end of Forty-eight had not left the track and  the electric locomotive stood upright upon the rails, being near the  head end of the train.    \"If this wreck was intentional, and aimed at your invention, Tom,\"  whispered Ned Newton, \"it did not result as the wreckers expected.\"    Tom scouted the idea suggested by his chum. And in a few moments they  learned from a railroad employee that a broken flange on a boxcar wheel  had caused the wreck.    \"So that disposes of your suspicion, Ned,\" said Tom, approaching the  huge electric locomotive.    \"Hey, gents!\" exclaimed another railroad man, one of the crew of the  wrecked freight. \"Better keep away from that locomotive.\"    \"What's the matter with it?\" Ned asked, curiously.    \"Got some kind of an aborigine caged up in it. You put your hand on any  part of it and he's likely to jump out and bite your hand off, or  something. Believe me, he's some savage.\"    Both Tom and Ned burst into laughter. The former went forward to the  door of the cab and knocked in a peculiar way. It was a signal that the  giant recognized instantly.    \"Master!\" Koku cried from inside the cab. \"Master! Him come in?\"    \"No, Koku,\" said Tom. \"I'm not coming in. Are you all right?\"    \"Yes. Koku all right. Him come out?\"    \"No, no!\" laughed Tom. \"You are not at your journey's end yet, Koku.  Keep on the job a while longer.\"    \"Sure. Koku stay here forever, if Master say so.\"    \"Forever is a long word, Koku,\" said Tom, more seriously. \"I'll tell  you when to open the door. I'll be at the end of the journey to meet  you.\"    \"It all right if Master say so. But Koku no like to travel in box,\"  grumbled the giant.    Tom turned from the electric locomotive to see Ned staring across the  tracks at a man who was talking to several of the train crew of the  side-swiped accommodation train. That train was about to be moved on  under its own power. None of the wreckage of the freight interfered  with the progress of the accommodation.    Tom stepped to Ned's side and touched his arm. \"Who is he?\" the  inventor asked.    The man who had attracted Ned's attention and now held Tom's interest  as well was a solid looking man with gray hair and a dyed mustache. He  was chewing on a long and black cigar, and he spoke to the train hands  with authority.    \"Well, why can't you find him?\" he wanted to know in a hoarse and  arrogant voice.    \"Who is he?\" asked Tom again in Ned's ear.    \"I've seen him somewhere. Or else I've seen somebody that looks like  him. Maybe I've seen his picture. He's somebody of importance.\"    \"He thinks he is,\" rejoined the young inventor, with some disdain.    In answer to something one of the railroad men said the important  looking individual uttered an oath and added:    \"There's nobody been killed then? He's just missing? He was sitting in  the coach ahead of me. I saw him just before the wreck. You know  O'Malley yourself. Do you mean to say you haven't seen him, Conductor?\"    \"I assure you he disappeared like smoke, sir,\" said the passenger  conductor. \"I haven't an idea what became of him.\"    \"Humph! If you see him, send him to me,\" and the solid man stepped  heavily aboard the nearest coach and disappeared inside.    Tom and Ned stared at each other with wondering gaze. O'Malley!  The  spy who had represented Montagne Lewis and the Hendrickton & Western  Railroad in the East.    \"What do you know about that?\" demanded Ned, wonderingly.    \"Hold on!\" exclaimed Tom. He sprang across the rails after the  conductor of the accommodation train that was just starting on.  \"Let  me ask you a question.\"    \"Yes, sir?\" replied the conductor    \"Who was that man who just spoke to you?\" \"That man? Why, I thought  everybody out this way knew Montagne Lewis. That is his name, sir--and  a big man he is. Yes, sir,\" and the conductor, giving the watching  engineer of his train the \"highball,\" caught the hand-rail of the car  and swung himself aboard as the train started.          Chapter XVIII    On the Hendrickton & Pas Alos      The transcontinental was delayed three hours by the strewn wreckage of  the rear of Number Forty-eight. When she went on the two young fellows  from Shopton gazed anxiously at the Hercules 0001, which stood between  two gondolas in the forward end of the freight train.    \"Just by luck nothing happened to it,\" muttered Ned.    \"Just luck,\" agreed Tom Swift. \"It was a shock to me to learn that Andy  O'Malley was right there on the spot when the accident happened.\"    \"And his employer, too,\" added Ned. \"For we must admit that Mr.  Montagne Lewis is the man who sicked O'Malley on to you.\"    \"True.\"    \"And they were both in the accommodation that was sideswiped by the  derailed cars of Number Forty-eight.\"    \"That, likewise is a fact,\" said Tom, nodding quickly.    \"But what puzzles me, as it seemed to puzzle Lewis, more than anything  else, is what became of O'Malley?\"    \"I guess I can see through that knot-hole,\" Tom rejoined.    \"Yes?\"    \"I bet O'Malley got a squint at me--or perhaps at you--as we walked up  the track from this coach, and he lit out in a hurry.  There stood the  Three-Oughts-One, and there were we. He knew we would raise a hue and  cry if we saw him in the vicinity of my locomotive.\"    \"I bet that's the truth, Tom.\"    \"I know it. He didn't even have time to warn his employer. By the way,  Ned, what a brute that Montagne Lewis looks to be.\"    \"I believe you! I remember having seen his photograph in a magazine.  Oh, he's some punkins, Tom.\"    \"And just as wicked as they make 'em, I bet! Face just as pleasant as a  bulldog's!\"    \"You said it. I'm afraid of that man. I shall not have a moment's peace  until you have handed the Hercules Three-Oughts-One over to Mr.  Bartholomew and got his acceptance.\"    \"If I do,\" murmured Tom.    \"Of course you will, if that Lewis or his henchmen don't smash things  up. You are not afraid of the speed matter now, are you?\" demanded Ned  confidently.    \"I can be sure of nothing until after the tests,\" said Tom, shaking his  head. \"Remember, Ned, that I have set out to accomplish what was never  done before--to drive a locomotive over the rails at two miles a  minute. It's a mighty big undertaking.\"    \"Of course it will come out all right. If Koku is faithful----\"    \"That is the smallest 'if' in the category,\" Tom interposed, with a  laugh. \"If I was as sure of all else as I am of Koku, we'd have plain  sailing before us.\"    Two days later Tom Swift and Ned Newton were ushered into the private  office of the president of the H. & P. A. at the Hendrickton terminal.  The two young fellows from the East had got in the night before, had  become established at the best hotel in the rapidly growing Western  municipality, and had seen something of the town itself during the  hours before midnight.    Now they were ready for business, and very important business, too.    Mr. Richard Bartholomew sat up in his desk chair and his keen eyes  suddenly sparkled when he saw his visitors and recognized them.    \"I did not expect you so soon. Your locomotive arrived yesterday, Mr.  Swift. How are you, Mr."]]]
