The decision is one of much interest to  inventors and agents, and fully warrants its publication.           *       *       *       *       *    OIL PAPER HANGINGS.--A kind of oil paper hangings called \"Oleo Charta\"  is now made in England, which, it is asserted, is impervious to wet, may  be placed on new or damp walls without risk of damage or discoloration,  may be washed with soap and water as often as required, and will last  twenty years. The process of manufacture is not explained.           *       *       *       *       *          THE STEVENS BREECH-LOADING RIFLE.      This new arm, a patent on which, was obtained through the Scientific  American Patent Agency, June 11, 1867, is destined, in our opinion,  to become a formidable rival to the breech-loading rifles which have  already attained popularity. It is one of the most simple and effective  guns we have yet seen. Only three motions are required to load,  discharge the piece, and throw out the shell of the cartridge. The  breech-block is side-hinged, and it is opened and the shell is thrown  out by simply bringing the gun to half cock. The gun may, however, be  cocked without opening the breech by pressing the trigger while cocking.    The gun, when held in position, may be fired at the rate of forty shots  per minute. All the movements of the parts are directly backward and  forward; in our opinion the best that can be employed for this purpose,  and the least liable to get out of order. In short, the gun possesses  all the essentials of a first class rifle, and has advantages which we  think are not ordinarily met with in arms of this character.           *       *       *       *       *          A NOVEL FRENCH HAND VISE.      In using ordinary hand vises several inconveniences are met with. For  instance, if it is desired to work a piece of metal of a certain length,  it must necessarily be presented obliquely on the side of the jaw of the  vise, because of its screw, which is horizontal and forms a knob in the  axis of the vise. The consequences are, first, that on tightening the  nut of the horizontal screw vise the pressure is only exerted on the  side, and greatly tries the vise itself while obtaining an irregular  pressure; secondly, that as the piece to be worked is held obliquely,  however skilled the workman may be, he always finds himself cramped in  the execution of his work, particularly if of a delicate nature.    To avoid these inconveniences a Parisian mechanic has designed and  lately patented in England the neat form of hand vise of which we annex  illustrations, Fig. 1 being an elevation and Fig. 2 a longitudinal  section. In these views, A, is a wooden or metal handle pierced  throughout its length; this handle of metal may be made in one piece,  with the nut, and the conical ferrule. B is the ring or ferrule of the  handle; and C are the jaws of the vise worked by the adjusting screw,  D, and the springs, r r. E is a conical ferrule or shoulder, fixed or  movable, and serving to open or close the jaws of the vise accordingly  as the handle is turned right or left; this conical shoulder is  protected from wear by a tempered steel washer, v. G is a nut with  collar carrying the conical ferrule or shoulder, E, and the steel  washer, v, while H H are the joints of the jaws of the vise held by a  screw, I, which serves as a support to the adjusting screw.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. FIG. 2.]    This hand vise may be applied to a number of uses, and among others it  may be readily converted into a haft or handle for any kind of tailed  or shanked tool, such as files, wrenches, olive bits, chisels, or  screwdrivers, and may also serve as pincers or nippers. It is of very  simple construction.           *       *       *       *       *          THE MOUND-BUILDERS IN COLORADO.      New evidence of the existence of the Mound-Builders in the mountain  ranges of Colorado, similar to those in Montana, Utah, and Nevada, have  recently been discovered by Mr. C.A. Deane, of Denver. He found upon  the extreme summit of the snow-range structures of stone, evidently of  ancient origin, and hitherto unknown or unmolested. Opposite to and  almost north of the South Boulder Creek, and the summit of the range,  Dr. Deane observed large numbers of granite rocks, and many of them as  large as two men could lift, in a position that could not have been  the result of chance. They had evidently been placed upright in a line  conforming to a general contour of the dividing ridge, and frequently  extending in an unbroken line for one or two hundred yards. The walls  and the mounds are situated three thousand feet above the timber line.  It is, therefore, hardly supposable that they were built for altars of  sacrifice. They were not large enough for shelter or defense. The more  probable supposition is that, like the large mounds in Montana and  elsewhere, they were places of sepulture.           *       *       *       *       *          THE WOVEN-WIRE MATTRESS.      Most of our readers who attended the last Fair of the American  Institute, will recall an article in the furniture department, which  attracted much attention on account of its novelty and utility. We refer  to the wire mattress, or bed, manufactured by the Woven Wire Mattress  Company, of Hartford, Conn. To the ordinary mind a new invention is  interesting or not, in proportion to the probability of its coming into  every-day use, and many a good housewife lingers in admiration over an  improved sewing machine or cooking stove, to whom a new steam engine has  no attraction. For this reason it was that the wire mattress was sat on  and lain on by the numerous visitors at the Fair.    [Illustration]    The engraving presented herewith will give the reader, who has not seen  the article, a good idea of its appearance. It consists of a fabric  represented below, half an inch thick, composed of fine wire springs,  each one the length of the bed; all the three hundred spirals, being so  woven and braided together, in a double \"weave,\" by machinery, that  a sort of wire cloth is produced. It differs from any other material  hitherto made, in that it has great strength and elasticity. There is,  in fact, no other device, except the air or water bed, which can compare  with it in its elastic properties.    [Illustration]    We are informed that nine hundred pounds of dead weight of wire were  placed on it for nearly five days, without injurious effects. This  fabric is stretched on a frame, as seen in the first engraving, the  proper tension is secured to suit the fancy, and the mattress is ready  for use. It is then set into the bedstead, like the ordinary spring bed,  except that only two slats are used to support it. Thus, with a slight  covering in summer, and a thin hair mattress for warmth in winter, a  most perfect sleeping arrangement is secured.    The first adaptation of the wire mattresses was for private houses, but  they have been found to have special advantages for hospital use. They  have been largely introduced into the Hartford Hospital, the Bellevue  Hospital, New York, and the Marine Hospital, Brooklyn, and have proved  to be, after months of the severest use, with all classes of patients,  a very great success for such purposes. The elastic flexible mattresses  yield to every motion and part of the body, much to the relief of the  suffering patient.    Another very great advantage is, that when carefully painted they are  always clean.    Pillows of the same materials are made soft and pliable by using a fine  wire and small coil. They are always cool, and afford the opportunity of  placing bags of ice under the head in case of sickness.    One of these mattresses and a bedstead and pillows complete--all of  which the Company make--furnish, with the addition of a folded blanket  or comfortable, a perfect outfit for hospital use.    They are particularly useful for ships' berths, as they dispense with  the ordinary bottom, and the sacking and thick mattress. Shippers know  this.    We are assured that a coating of paint, carefully applied to the  well-tinned wires will protect them from rust.    There can be no question but that these beds, with a light  covering--scarcely more than a sheet--are especially adapted for hot  climates. The Company have already orders for them for the Brazilian  market, and they have been introduced into many of the Southern States.    This wire fabric is adapted to other articles of furniture, and is used  in place of the ordinary springs in chairs, sofas, etc. For out-door  settees, lounges, car seats, and other like purposes, it is well  adapted.    Three patents have been issued to the Company on the wire mattress,  through the Scientific American Patent Agency.

A correspondent, in discussing the causes of fires in flour mills, gives  the following facts and queries:    \"F. Bertchey's mill, at Milwaukee, burned in September last. The fire  originated from a candle held near a bran or feed spout, reaching from  the upper to a lower floor. The ignition was instant, and attained  different points of the building at about the same moment.    \"On November 20, 1868, Schmidt & Co's mill, at St. Louis, burned in a  similar manner, the light in this case being in a globe lamp, but the  conflagration was, nevertheless, quite as sudden and general as in the  first case cited. Other instances of like character have occurred quite  recently. And now the query is, What"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8997"],[0,"Ritchie's Fabulae Faciles: A First Latin Reader (#16)"],[1,"by attraction.    12. tú. The nominative of the personal pronouns is commonly expressed  only when emphatic. Here the use of the pronoun makes the promise more  positive.    15. rem aegré tulit, 'was vexed.' Compare 39, 10.    20. Vultisne, the verb _vultis_ and the enclitic _-ne_, which is used to  introduce a question, and is incapable of translation. Num (line 21)  introduces a question to which a negative answer is expected, and is  likewise not to be translated, except in so far as its effect is  reproduced by the form of the question or the tone of incredulity with  which the words are spoken.    28. effervésceret. See the note on 40, 16.    45. 3. stupentés, 'in amazement.'    5. Vós. See the note on 44, 12. Vós and ego in the next sentence are  contrasted.    7. Quod ubi. See the note on 28, 8.    10. necávérunt. See the note on _interfécit_, 13, 18.    13. quíbus. For the case see the note on _quíbus_, 34, 27.    15. ré vérá, 'really.'    18. aegré tulérunt, 'were indignant at.' Compare 39, 10, and 44, 15.    23. Creontí. See the note on _cui erant_, 13, 5.    25. núntium, 'a notice of divorce.'    26. dúceret. See the note on _dúxit_, 6, 18.    28. ultúram. See the note on 39, 1.    46. 1. Vestem. Compare the story of the death of Hercules, pp. 30, 31.    3. quis. See the note on 30, 3.    induisset, subjunctive by attraction.    5. nihil malí. See the note on 22, 26.    16. itaque, not the adverb _itaque_, but the adverb _ita_ and the  enclitic conjunction _-que_.    áera. See the note on 4, 11.    21. in eam partem, 'to that side.'      ULYSSES    49. 4. ínsidiás. This refers to the story of the wooden horse.    9. quem, subject of excógitásse. The English idiom is 'who, some say,  devised.' Notice that excógitásse is contracted from _excógitávisse_.    10. quó, ablative of means.    19. aliae ... partís, 'some in one direction and some in another,' but  Latin compresses this into the one clause 'others in other directions.'    20. quá. See the note on 43, 6.    26. quibusdam, dative with obviam factí, 'having fallen in with,' 'having  met.'    27. Accidit. See the note on 30, 1.    50. 2. gustássent, contracted from _gustávissent_.    patriae et sociórum. Verbs of remembering and forgetting take the  genitive or the accusative, but _oblívíscor_ prefers the former.    4. cibó. See the note on 16, 19.    5. hórá septimá. See the note on 42, 23.    11. docuérunt. See the note on 4, 26.    51. 6. tantum, the adverb.    23. sé, 'they,' _i.e_. himself and his companions.    praedandí causá, 'to steal.' Purpose is frequently thus expressed by  _causá_ with the genitive of the gerund or gerundive. What other ways of  expressing purpose have you met in your reading?    24. á Tróiá. The preposition is sometimes used with names of towns, with  the meaning 'from the direction of' or 'from the neighborhood of.'    25. esse. It will help you to understand indirect discourse if you will  try to discover what words would be used to express the idea in the  direct form. Here, for instance, the exact words of Ulysses would have  been in Latin: _Neque mercátórés sumus neque praedandí causá vénimus; sed  á Tróiá redeuntés ví tempestátum á réctó cursú dépulsí sumus_.    27. ubi ... essent. The question of Polyphemus was _Ubi est návis quá  vectí estis_?    sibi ... esse, 'that he must be exceedingly careful.' See the note on  _mátúrandum sibi_, 42, 12.    29. in ... esse, 'had been driven on the rocks and entirely dashed to  pieces.' See the note on _írá ... interfécit_, 18, 4.    52. 1. membrís eórum dívulsís, 'tearing them limb from limb.'    4. né ... quidem. See the note on 34, 25.    6. tam. Notice that the force of a second demonstrative word is lost in  the English rendering. So _híc tantus vir_, 'this great man,' etc.    7. humí. See the note on 30, 16.    próstrátus, 'throwing himself down.' See the note on _continébantur_,  20, 26.    8. reí gerendae, 'for action.' Compare 39, 8.    9. in eó ... tránsfígeret, 'was on the point of transfixing.' The clause  of result ut ... tránsfígeret is explanatory of in eó.    13. nihil sibi prófutúrum. See the note on 43, 25.    17. hóc cónátú. See the note on 13, 11.    18. núllá ... oblátá, 'since no hope of safety presented itself.' See the  note on _continébantur_, 20, 26.    21. et. See the note on 28, 18.    23. látúri essent, 'would bring,' more literally 'were going to bring.'  Notice that in subjunctive constructions the periphrastic form is  necessary to express future action clearly, since the subjunctive has no  future.    25. quod, object of the implied _fécerat_.    53. 14. quó. See the note on 43, 7.    15. id ... salútí, 'and this was his salvation,' literally 'that which  was for safety to him.' For the datives see the note on 13, 16.    20. tertium, the adverb.    22. Néminem. Why is the accusative used?    27. inquit. See the note on 14, 28.    28. quam facultátem, for _facultátem quam_. The antecedent is often thus  attracted into the relative clause,    né omittámus, 'let us not neglect,' the hortatory subjunctive.    29. reí gerendae. See the note on 52, 8.    54. 1. extrémum pálum, 'the end of the stake.' Other adjectives denoting  a part of the object named by the noun they modify are _medius_, 'the  middle of'; _céterus_, 'the rest of'; _reliquus_, 'the rest of';  _prímus_, 'the first of'; _summus_, 'the top of'; _ímus_, 'the bottom  of.'    5. dum errat, 'wandering.'    23. pecus. Is this _pecus, pecoris_, or _pecus, pecudis_? See the note on  _pecora_, 20, 26.    24. vénerat. We say 'came,' but the Latin by the use of the pluperfect  denotes that this action preceded that of tráctábat.    55. 1. quás. See the note on _quibus_, 20, 1.    inter sé. Compare 21, 20.    5. fore, 'would happen.'    15. aliquod. Compare 42, 12, and the note.    16. id ... erat, 'as was indeed the case.'    17. auxiliandí causá. See the note on 51, 23.    26. correptum coniécit, 'seized and threw.'    27. nón ... submergerentur. See the note on 37, 7.    56. 4-6. These verses and those on p. 57 and p. 59 are quoted from  Vergil's Aeneid.    6. vinclís, for _vinculís_.    8. vírís. Let the quantity of the first _i_ tell you from what nominative  this word comes.    11. sibi proficíscendum. See the note on _mátúrandum sibi_, 42, 12.    13. iam profectúró, 'as he was now about to set out.'    16. návigantí, 'to one sailing.'    25. mírábantur, 'had been wondering.' With iam dúdum and similar  expressions the imperfect denotes action begun some time before and still  going on at the given past time. This is similar to the use of the  present already commented on (see the note on _es_, 4, 1).    28. céláta, plural because of the plural expression aurum et argentum.    57. 1. ventí, subject of ruunt and perflant.    2. velut ágmine factó, 'as if formed in column.'    3. data. _Est_ is omitted.    10. próiécissent. See the note on _accépissent_, 26, 21.    13. in terram égrediendum esse, 'that a landing must be made.'    18. quam, an adverb modifying crúdélí.    19. essent, informal indirect discourse or subjunctive by attraction.    20. vellet, subjunctive of characteristic. This name is given to the  subjunctive when used in relative clauses to define or restrict an  indefinite or general antecedent. So here it is not 'no one was found,'  but 'no one willing to undertake this task was found.'    21. déducta est, 'came.'    23. praeesset, subjunctive of purpose.    25. événit. This verb takes the same construction as _accidit_, 30, 1.    58. 1. nihil. See the note on 37, 22.    2. mortí. Compare 49, 26.    5. aliquantum itineris, 'some distance on the journey.' The two words are  accusative of extent of space and partitive genitive respectively.    11. sibi, 'for them,' dative of reference.    12. forís. This is translated like forás above, but the former was  originally locative and is therefore used with verbs of rest; the latter,  accusative of place whither and therefore used with verbs of motion.    15. accubuérunt. See the note on 37, 6.    25. perturbátus, used as a predicate adjective, 'agitated.'    27. correptó. See the note on 38, 8.    59. 1. quid. See the note on _quis_, 30, 3.    gravius, 'serious.'    eí. The direct form of these two speeches would be: _Sí quid gravius tibi  acciderit, omnium salús in summó discrímine erit_; and _Néminem invítum  mécum addúcam; tibi licet, sí mávís, in náví manére; ego ipse sine úlló  praesidió rem suscipiam_. Notice that _ego_ is not used to represent _sé_  of line 2, but is used for _sé_ of line 4 for the sake of the contrast  with _tibi_.    6. núlló. Instead of the genitive and ablative of _némó_, _núllíus_ and  _núlló_ are regularly used.    7. Alíquantum itinerís. See the note on 58, 5.    10. in eó ... intráret. See the note on 52, 9.    11. eí. Compare 49, 26, and 58, 2.    14. Circés, a Greek form of the genitive.    16. Num. See the note on 44, 20. Nónne (line 14) is used to introduce a  question to which an affirmative answer is expected.    18. núllís. See the note on 24, 3.    22. tetigerit. See the note on 30, 20.    tú ... faciás, 'see that you draw your sword and make an attack upon  her.'    24. vísús, 'sight,' The use of the plural is poetic.    25. tenuem ... auram. The order of the words here is poetic.    60. 1. atque, 'as.' After adjectives and adverbs denoting likeness and  unlikeness, this use of _atque_ is regular.    3. dépulsa est. See the note on 4, 26.    4. sibi. See the note on 58, 11.    11. ut ... erat, 'as he had been instructed,' more literally 'as had been  enjoined upon him.' An intransitive verb must be used impersonally in the  passive, for it is the direct object of the active voice that becomes the  subject of the passive. If the intransitive verb takes a dative in the  active, this dative is kept in the passive. Notice that the corresponding  English verbs are transitive, and that the dative may therefore be  rendered as the object in the active construction and as the subject in"]]]
