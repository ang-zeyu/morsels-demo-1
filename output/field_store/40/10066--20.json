It even worried him, so that he  leaped upon the bank and hurriedly began to dress himself.  \"A great  misfortune has befallen me,\" he told himself, \"for hereafter I cannot  tell people I am wise, since it is not the truth.  The truth is that my  boasted wisdom is all a sham, assumed by me to deceive people and make  them defer to me.  In truth, no living creature can know much more than  his fellows, for one may know one thing, and another know another  thing, so that wisdom is evenly scattered throughout the world.  But--ah me!--what a terrible fate will now be mine.  Even Cayke the  Cookie Cook will soon discover that my knowledge is no greater than her  own, for having bathed in the enchanted water of the Truth Pond, I can  no longer deceive her or tell a lie.\"    More humbled than he had been for many years, the Frogman went back to  the grove where he had left Cayke and found the woman now awake and  washing her face in a tiny brook.  \"Where has Your Honor been?\" she  asked.    \"To a farmhouse to ask for something to eat,\" said he, \"but the woman  refused me.\"    \"How dreadful!\" she exclaimed.  \"But never mind, there are other houses  where the people will be glad to feed the Wisest Creature in all the  World.\"    \"Do you mean yourself?\" he asked.    \"No, I mean you.\"    The Frogman felt strongly impelled to tell the truth, but struggled  hard against it.  His reason told him there was no use in letting Cayke  know he was not wise, for then she would lose much respect for him, but  each time he opened his mouth to speak, he realized he was about to  tell the truth and shut it again as quickly as possible.  He tried to  talk about something else, but the words necessary to undeceive the  woman would force themselves to his lips in spite of all his struggles.  Finally, knowing that he must either remain dumb or let the truth  prevail, he gave a low groan of despair and said, \"Cayke, I am NOT the  Wisest Creature in all the World; I am not wise at all.\"    \"Oh, you must be!\" she protested. \"You told me so yourself, only last  evening.\"    \"Then last evening I failed to tell you the truth,\" he admitted,  looking very shamefaced for a frog.  \"I am sorry I told you this lie,  my good Cayke, but if you must know the truth, the whole truth and  nothing but the truth, I am not really as wise as you are.\"    The Cookie Cook was greatly shocked to hear this, for it shattered one  of her most pleasing illusions.  She looked at the gorgeously dressed  Frogman in amazement.  \"What has caused you to change your mind so  suddenly?\" she inquired.    \"I have bathed in the Truth Pond,\" he said, \"and whoever bathes in that  water is ever afterward obliged to tell the truth.\"    \"You were foolish to do that,\" declared the woman.    \"It is often very embarrassing to tell the truth.  I'm glad I didn't  bathe in that dreadful water!\"    The Frogman looked at his companion thoughtfully.  \"Cayke,\" said he, \"I  want you to go to the Truth Pond and take a bath in its water.  For if  we are to travel together and encounter unknown adventures, it would  not be fair that I alone must always tell you the truth, while you  could tell me whatever you pleased.  If we both dip in the enchanted  water, there will be no chance in the future of our deceiving one  another.\"    \"No,\" she asserted, shaking her head positively, \"I won't do it, Your  Honor.  For if I told you the truth, I'm sure you wouldn't like me. No  Truth Pond for me.  I'll be just as I am, an honest woman who can say  what she wants to without hurting anyone's feelings.\"    With this decision the Frogman was forced to be content, although he  was sorry the Cookie Cook would not listen to his advice.          CHAPTER 14    THE UNHAPPY FERRYMAN      Leaving the grove where they had slept, the Frogman and the Cookie Cook  turned to the east to seek another house, and after a short walk came  to one where the people received them very politely.  The children  stared rather hard at the big, pompous Frogman, but the woman of the  house, when Cayke asked for something to eat, at once brought them food  and said they were welcome to it.  \"Few people in need of help pass  this way,\" she remarked, \"for the Winkies are all prosperous and love  to stay in their own homes.  But perhaps you are not a Winkie,\" she  added.    \"No,\" said Cayke, \"I am a Yip, and my home is on a high mountain at the  southeast of your country.\"    \"And the Frogman, is he also a Yip?\"    \"I do not know what he is, other than a very remarkable and highly  educated creature,\" replied the Cookie Cook.  \"But he has lived many  years among the Yips, who have found him so wise and intelligent that  they always go to him for advice.\"    \"May I ask why you have left your home and where you are going?\" said  the Winkie woman.    Then Cayke told her of the diamond-studded gold dishpan and how it had  been mysteriously stolen from her house, after which she had discovered  that she could no longer cook good cookies.  So she had resolved to  search until she found her dishpan again, because a Cookie cook who  cannot cook good cookies is not of much use.  The Frogman, who had  wanted to see more of the world, had accompanied her to assist in the  search.  When the woman had listened to this story, she asked, \"Then  you have no idea as yet who has stolen your dishpan?\"    \"I only know it must have been some mischievous fairy, or a magician,  or some such powerful person, because none other could have climbed the  steep mountain to the Yip Country.  And who else could have carried  away my beautiful magic dishpan without being seen?\"    The woman thought about this during the time that Cayke and the Frogman  ate their breakfast.  When they had finished, she said, \"Where are you  going next?\"    \"We have not decided,\" answered the Cookie cook.    \"Our plan,\" explained the Frogman in his important way, \"is to travel  from place to place until we learn where the thief is located and then  to force him to return the dishpan to its proper owner.\"    \"The plan is all right,\" agreed the woman, \"but it may take you a long  time before you succeed, your method being sort of haphazard and  indefinite.  However, I advise you to travel toward the east.\"    \"Why?\" asked the Frogman.    \"Because if you went west, you would soon come to the desert, and also  because in this part of the Winkie Country no one steals, so your time  here would be wasted.  But toward the east, beyond the river, live many  strange people whose honesty I would not vouch for.  Moreover, if you  journey far enough east and cross the river for a second time, you will  come to the Emerald City, where there is much magic and sorcery. The  Emerald City is ruled by a dear little girl called Ozma, who also rules  the Emperor of the Winkies and all the Land of Oz.  So, as Ozma is a  fairy, she may be able to tell you just who has taken your precious  dishpan.  Provided, of course, you do not find it before you reach her.\"    \"This seems to be to be excellent advice,\" said the Frogman, and Cayke  agreed with him.    \"The most sensible thing for you to do,\" continued the woman, \"would be  to return to your home and use another dishpan, learn to cook cookies  as other people cook cookies, without the aid of magic.  But if you  cannot be happy without the magic dishpan you have lost, you are likely  to learn more about it in the Emerald City than at any other place in  Oz.\"    They thanked the good woman, and on leaving her house faced the east  and continued in that direction all the way.  Toward evening they came  to the west branch of the Winkie River and there, on the riverbank,  found a ferryman who lived all alone in a little yellow house.  This  ferryman was a Winkie with a very small head and a very large body. He  was sitting in his doorway as the travelers approached him and did not  even turn his head to look at them.    \"Good evening,\" said the Frogman.    The ferryman made no reply.    \"We would like some supper and the privilege of sleeping in your house  until morning,\" continued the Frogman.  \"At daybreak, we would like  some breakfast, and then we would like to have you row us across the  river.\"    The ferryman neither moved nor spoke.  He sat in his doorway and looked  straight ahead.  \"I think he must be deaf and dumb,\" Cayke whispered to  her companion.  Then she stood directly in front of the ferryman, and  putting her mouth close to his ear, she yelled as loudly as she could,  \"Good evening!\"    The ferryman scowled.    \"Why do you yell at me, woman?\" he asked.    \"Can you hear what I say?\" asked in her ordinary tone of voice.    \"Of course,\" replied the man.    \"Then why didn't you answer the Frogman?\"    \"Because,\" said the ferryman, \"I don't understand the frog language.\"    \"He speaks the same words that I do and in the same way,\" declared  Cayke.    \"Perhaps,\" replied the ferryman, \"but to me his voice sounded like a  frog's croak.  I know that in the Land of Oz animals can speak our  language, and so can the birds and bugs and fishes; but in MY ears,  they sound merely like growls and chirps and croaks.\"    \"Why is that?\" asked the Cookie Cook in surprise.    \"Once, many years ago, I cut the tail off a fox which had taunted me,  and I stole some birds' eggs from a nest to make an omelet with, and  also I pulled a fish from the river and left it lying on the bank to  gasp for lack of water until it died.  I don't know why I did those  wicked things, but I did them.  So the Emperor of the Winkies--who is  the Tin Woodman and has a very tender tin heart--punished me by denying  me any communication with beasts, birds or fishes.  I cannot understand  them when they speak to me, although I know that other people can do  so, nor can the creatures understand a word I say to them.  Every time  I meet one of them, I am reminded of my former cruelty, and it makes me  very unhappy.\"    \"Really,\" said Cayke, \"I'm sorry for you,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/960"],[0,"The Tin Woodman of Oz (#16)"],[1,"as silver,  reflecting all objects from its smooth surface like a mirror.    While her companions gathered around the table, eagerly attentive--and  Dorothy even held little Toto in her arms that he might see--Ozma waved  her wand over the mirror-like surface. At once it reflected the  interior of Yoop Castle, and in the big hall sat Mrs. Yoop, in her best  embroidered silken robes, engaged in weaving a new lace apron to  replace the one she had lost.    The Giantess seemed rather uneasy, as if she had a faint idea that  someone was spying upon her, for she kept looking behind her and this  way and that, as though expecting danger from an unknown source.  Perhaps some yookoohoo instinct warned her. Woot saw that she had  escaped from her room by some of the magical means at her disposal,  after her prisoners had escaped her. She was now occupying the big hall  of her castle as she used to do. Also Woot thought, from the cruel  expression on the face of the Giantess, that she was planning revenge  on them, as soon as her new magic apron was finished.    But Ozma was now making passes over the platter with her silver Wand,  and presently the form of the Giantess began to shrink in size and to  change its shape. And now, in her place sat the form of Woot the  Wanderer, and as if suddenly realizing her transformation Mrs. Yoop  threw down her work and rushed to a looking-glass that stood against  the wall of her room. When she saw the boy's form reflected as her own,  she grew violently angry and dashed her head against the mirror,  smashing it to atoms.    Just then Ozma was busy with her magic Wand, making strange figures,  and she had also placed her left hand firmly upon the shoulder of the  Green Monkey. So now, as all eyes were turned upon the platter, the  form of Mrs. Yoop gradually changed again. She was slowly transformed  into the Green Monkey, and at the same time Woot slowly regained his  natural form.    It was quite a surprise to them all when they raised their eyes from  the platter and saw Woot the Wanderer standing beside Ozma. And, when  they glanced at the platter again, it reflected nothing more than the  walls of the room in Jinjur's house in which they stood. The magic  ceremonial was ended, and Ozma of Oz had triumphed over the wicked  Giantess.    \"What will become of her, I wonder?\" said Dorothy, as she drew a long  breath.    \"She will always remain a Green Monkey,\" replied Ozma, \"and in that  form she will be unable to perform any magical arts whatsoever. She  need not be unhappy, however, and as she lives all alone in her castle  she probably won't mind the transformation very much after she gets  used to it.\"    \"Anyhow, it serves her right,\" declared Dorothy, and all agreed with  her.    \"But,\" said the kind hearted Tin Woodman, \"I'm afraid the Green Monkey  will starve, for Mrs. Yoop used to get her food by magic, and now that  the magic is taken away from her, what can she eat?\"    \"Why, she'll eat what other monkeys do,\" returned the Scarecrow. \"Even  in the form of a Green Monkey, she's a very clever person, and I'm sure  her wits will show her how to get plenty to eat.\"    \"Don't worry about her,\" advised Dorothy. \"She didn't worry about you,  and her condition is no worse than the condition she imposed on poor  Woot. She can't starve to death in the Land of Oz, that's certain, and  if she gets hungry at times it's no more than the wicked thing  deserves. Let's forget Mrs. Yoop; for, in spite of her being a  yookoohoo, our fairy friends have broken all of her transformations.\"          Chapter Fifteen    The Man of Tin      Ozma and Dorothy were quite pleased with Woot the Wanderer, whom they  found modest and intelligent and very well mannered. The boy was truly  grateful for his release from the cruel enchantment, and he promised to  love, revere and defend the girl Ruler of Oz forever afterward, as a  faithful subject.    \"You may visit me at my palace, if you wish,\" said Ozma, \"where I will  be glad to introduce you to two other nice boys, Ojo the Munchkin and  Button-Bright.\"    \"Thank your Majesty,\" replied Woot, and then he turned to the Tin  Woodman and inquired: \"What are your further plans, Mr. Emperor? Will  you still seek Nimmie Amee and marry her, or will you abandon the quest  and return to the Emerald City and your own castle?\"    The Tin Woodman, now as highly polished and well-oiled as ever,  reflected a while on this question and then answered:    \"Well, I see no reason why I should not find Nimmie Amee. We are now in  the Munchkin Country, where we are perfectly safe, and if it was right  for me, before our enchantment, to marry Nimmie Amee and make her  Empress of the Winkies, it must be right now, when the enchantment has  been broken and I am once more myself. Am I correct, friend Scarecrow?\"    \"You are, indeed,\" answered the Scarecrow. \"No one can oppose such  logic.\"    \"But I'm afraid you don't love Nimmie Amee,\" suggested Dorothy.    \"That is just because I can't love anyone,\" replied the Tin Woodman.  \"But, if I cannot love my wife, I can at least be kind to her, and all  husbands are not able to do that.\"    \"Do you s'pose Nimmie Amee still loves you, after all these years?\"  asked Dorothy.    \"I'm quite sure of it, and that is why I am going to her to make her  happy. Woot the Wanderer thinks I ought to reward her for being  faithful to me after my meat body was chopped to pieces and I became  tin. What do you think, Ozma?\"    Ozma smiled as she said:    \"I do not know your Nimmie Amee, and so I cannot tell what she most  needs to make her happy. But there is no harm in your going to her and  asking her if she still wishes to marry you. If she does, we will give  you a grand wedding at the Emerald City and, afterward, as Empress of  the Winkies, Nimmie Amee would become one of the most important ladies  in all Oz.\"    So it was decided that the Tin Woodman would continue his journey, and  that the Scarecrow and Woot the Wanderer should accompany him, as  before. Polychrome also decided to join their party, somewhat to the  surprise of all.    \"I hate to be cooped up in a palace,\" she said to Ozma, \"and of course  the first time I meet my Rainbow I shall return to my own dear home in  the skies, where my fairy sisters are even now awaiting me and my  father is cross because I get lost so often. But I can find my Rainbow  just as quickly while traveling in the Munchkin Country as I could if  living in the Emerald City--or any other place in Oz--so I shall go  with the Tin Woodman and help him woo Nimmie Amee.\"    Dorothy wanted to go, too, but as the Tin Woodman did not invite her to  join his party, she felt she might be intruding if she asked to be  taken. She hinted, but she found he didn't take the hint. It is quite a  delicate matter for one to ask a girl to marry him, however much she  loves him, and perhaps the Tin Woodman did not desire to have too many  looking on when he found his old sweetheart, Nimmie Amee. So Dorothy  contented herself with the thought that she would help Ozma prepare a  splendid wedding feast, to be followed by a round of parties and  festivities when the Emperor of the Winkies reached the Emerald City  with his bride.    Ozma offered to take them all in the Red Wagon to a place as near to  the great Munchkin forest as a wagon could get. The Red Wagon was big  enough to seat them all, and so, bidding good-bye to Jinjur, who gave  Woot a basket of ripe cream-puffs and caramels to take with him, Ozma  commanded the Wooden Sawhorse to start, and the strange creature moved  swiftly over the lanes and presently came to the Road of Yellow Bricks.  This road led straight to a dense forest, where the path was too narrow  for the Red Wagon to proceed farther, so here the party separated.    Ozma and Dorothy and Toto returned to the Emerald City, after wishing  their friends a safe and successful journey, while the Tin Woodman, the  Scarecrow, Woot the Wanderer and Polychrome, the Rainbow's Daughter,  prepared to push their way through the thick forest. However, these  forest paths were well known to the Tin Man and the Scarecrow, who felt  quite at home among the trees.    \"I was born in this grand forest,\" said Nick Chopper, the tin Emperor,  speaking proudly, \"and it was here that the Witch enchanted my axe and  I lost different parts of my meat body until I became all tin. Here,  also--for it is a big forest--Nimmie Amee lived with the Wicked Witch,  and at the other edge of the trees stands the cottage of my friend  Ku-Klip, the famous tinsmith who made my present beautiful form.\"    \"He must be a clever workman,\" declared Woot, admiringly.    \"He is simply wonderful,\" declared the Tin Woodman.    \"I shall be glad to make his acquaintance,\" said Woot.    \"If you wish to meet with real cleverness,\" remarked the Scarecrow,  \"you should visit the Munchkin farmer who first made me. I won't say  that my friend the Emperor isn't all right for a tin man, but any judge  of beauty can understand that a Scarecrow is far more artistic and  refined.\"    \"You are too soft and flimsy,\" said the Tin Woodman.    \"You are too hard and stiff,\" said the Scarecrow, and this was as near  to quarreling as the two friends ever came. Polychrome laughed at them  both, as well she might, and Woot hastened to change the subject.    At night they all camped underneath the trees. The boy ate cream-puffs  for supper and offered Polychrome some, but she preferred other food  and at daybreak sipped the dew that was clustered thick on the forest  flowers. Then they tramped onward again, and presently the Scarecrow  paused and said:    \"It was on this very spot that Dorothy and I first met the Tin Woodman,  who was rusted so badly that none of his joints would move. But after  we had oiled him up, he was as good as new and accompanied us to the  Emerald City.\"    \"Ah, that was a sad experience,\" asserted the Tin Woodman soberly. \"I  was caught in a"]]]
