[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11128"],[0,"The Red Thumb Mark (#17)"],[1,"formalities  were gone through, we found ourselves part of a numerous and very motley  company, for a considerable assemblage of the prisoners' friends was  awaiting the moment of admission. I noticed that my companion was  observing our fellow-visitors with a kind of horrified curiosity, which  she strove, however, and not unsuccessfully, to conceal; and certainly  the appearance of the majority furnished eloquent testimony to the  failure of crime as a means of worldly advancement. Their present  position was productive of very varied emotions; some were silent and  evidently stricken with grief; a larger number were voluble and excited,  while a considerable proportion were quite cheerful and even inclined to  be facetious.    At length the great iron gate was unlocked and our party taken in charge  by a warder, who conducted us to that part of the building known as \"the  wing\"; and, in the course of our progress, I could not help observing  the profound impression made upon my companion by the circumstance that  every door had to be unlocked to admit us and was locked again as soon  as we had passed through.    \"It seems to me,\" I said, as we neared our destination, \"that you had  better let me see Reuben first; I have not much to say to him and shall  not keep you waiting long.\"    \"Why do you think so?\" she asked, with a shade of suspicion.    \"Well,\" I answered, \"I think you may be a little upset by the interview,  and I should like to see you into your cab as soon as possible  afterwards.\"    \"Yes,\" she said; \"perhaps you are right, and it is kind of you to be so  thoughtful on my account.\"    A minute later, accordingly, I found myself shut into a narrow box, like  one of those which considerate pawnbrokers provide for their more  diffident clients, and in a similar, but more intense, degree, pervaded  by a subtle odour of uncleanness. The woodwork was polished to an  unctuous smoothness by the friction of numberless dirty hands and soiled  garments, and the general appearance--taken in at a glance as I  entered--was such as to cause me to thrust my hands into my pockets and  studiously avoid contact with any part of the structure but the floor.  The end of the box opposite the door was closed in by a strong grating  of wire--excepting the lower three feet, which was of wood--and looking  through this, I perceived, behind a second grating, Reuben Hornby,  standing in a similar attitude to my own. He was dressed in his usual  clothes and with his customary neatness, but his face was unshaven and  he wore, suspended from a button-hole, a circular label bearing the  characters \"B.31\"; and these two changes in his exterior carried with  them a suggestiveness as subtle as it was unpleasant, making me more  than ever regretful that Miss Gibson had insisted on coming.    \"It is exceedingly good of you, Dr. Jervis, to come and see me,\" he said  heartily, making himself heard quite easily, to my surprise, above the  hubbub of the adjoining boxes; \"but I didn't expect you here. I was told  I could see my legal advisers in the solicitor's box.\"    \"So you could,\" I answered. \"But I came here by choice because I have  brought Miss Gibson with me.\"  \"I am sorry for that,\" he rejoined, with  evident disapproval; \"she oughtn't to have come among these riff-raff.\"    \"I told her so, and that you wouldn't like it, but she insisted.\"    \"I know,\" said Reuben. \"That's the worst of women--they will make a  beastly fuss and sacrifice themselves when nobody wants them to. But I  mustn't be ungrateful; she means it kindly, and she's a deuced good  sort, is Juliet.\"    \"She is indeed,\" I exclaimed, not a little disgusted at his cool,  unappreciative tone; \"a most noble-hearted girl, and her devotion to you  is positively heroic.\"    The faintest suspicion of a smile appeared on the face seen through the  double grating; on which I felt that I could have pulled his nose with  pleasure--only that a pair of tongs of special construction would have  been required for the purpose.    \"Yes,\" he answered calmly, \"we have always been very good friends.\"    A rejoinder of the most extreme acidity was on my lips. Damn the fellow!  What did he mean by speaking in that supercilious tone of the loveliest  and sweetest woman in the world? But, after all, one cannot trample on a  poor devil locked up in a jail on a false charge, no matter how great  may be the provocation. I drew a deep breath, and, having recovered  myself, outwardly at least, said--    \"I hope you don't find the conditions here too intolerable?\"  \"Oh, no,\"  he answered. \"It's beastly unpleasant, of course, but it might easily be  worse. I don't mind if it's only for a week or two; and I am really  encouraged by what Dr. Thorndyke said. I hope he wasn't being merely  soothing.\"    \"You may take it that he was not. What he said, I am sure he meant. Of  course, you know I am not in his confidence--nobody is--but I gather  that he is satisfied with the defence he is preparing.\"    \"If he is satisfied, I am,\" said Reuben, \"and, in any case, I shall owe  him an immense debt of gratitude for having stood by me and believed in  me when all the world--except my aunt and Juliet--had condemned me.\"    He then went on to give me a few particulars of his prison life, and  when he had chatted for a quarter of an hour or so, I took my leave to  make way for Miss Gibson.    Her interview with him was not as long as I had expected, though, to be  sure, the conditions were not very favourable either for the exchange of  confidences or for utterances of a sentimental character. The  consciousness that one's conversation could be overheard by the  occupants of adjacent boxes destroyed all sense of privacy, to say  nothing of the disturbing influence of the warder in the alley-way.    When she rejoined me, her manner was abstracted and very depressed, a  circumstance that gave me considerable food for reflection as we made  our way in silence towards the main entrance. Had she found Reuben as  cool and matter-of-fact as I had? He was assuredly a very calm and  self-possessed lover, and it was conceivable that his reception of the  girl, strung up, as she was, to an acute pitch of emotion, might have  been somewhat in the nature of an anticlimax. And then, was it possible  that the feeling was on her side only? Could it be that the priceless  pearl of her love was cast before--I was tempted to use the colloquial  singular and call him an \"unappreciative swine!\" The thing was almost  unthinkable to me, and yet I was tempted to dwell upon it; for when a  man is in love--and I could no longer disguise my condition from  myself--he is inclined to be humble and to gather up thankfully the  treasure that is rejected of another.    I was brought up short in these reflections by the clank of the lock in  the great iron gate. We entered together the gloomy vestibule, and a  moment later were let out through the wicket into the courtyard; and as  the lock clicked behind us, we gave a simultaneous sigh of relief to  find ourselves outside the precincts of the prison, beyond the domain of  bolts and bars.    I had settled Miss Gibson in the cab and given her address to the  driver, when I noticed her looking at me, as I thought, somewhat  wistfully.    \"Can't I put you down somewhere?\" she said, in response to a  half-questioning glance from me.    I seized the opportunity with thankfulness and replied--    \"You might set me down at King's Cross if it is not delaying you;\" and  giving the word to the cabman, I took my place by her side as the cab  started and a black-painted prison van turned into the courtyard with  its freight of squalid misery.    \"I don't think Reuben was very pleased to see me,\" Miss Gibson remarked  presently, \"but I shall come again all the same. It is a duty I owe both  to him and to myself.\"    I felt that I ought to endeavour to dissuade her, but the reflection  that her visits must almost of necessity involve my companionship,  enfeebled my will. I was fast approaching a state of infatuation.    \"I was so thankful,\" she continued, \"that you prepared me. It was a  horrible experience to see the poor fellow caged like a wild beast, with  that dreadful label hanging from his coat; but it would have been  overwhelming if I had not known what to expect.\"    As we proceeded, her spirits revived somewhat, a circumstance that she  graciously ascribed to the enlivening influence of my society; and I  then told her of the mishap that had befallen my colleague.    \"What a terrible thing!\" she exclaimed, with evidently unaffected  concern. \"It is the merest chance that he was not killed on the spot. Is  he much hurt? And would he mind, do you think, if I called to inquire  after him?\"    I said that I was sure he would be delighted (being, as a matter of  fact, entirely indifferent as to his sentiments on the subject in my  delight at the proposal), and when I stepped down from the cab at King's  Cross to pursue my way homewards, there already opened out before me the  prospect of the renewal of this bitter-sweet and all too dangerous  companionship on the morrow.          CHAPTER X    POLTON IS MYSTIFIED      A couple of days sufficed to prove that Thorndyke's mishap was not to be  productive of any permanent ill consequences; his wounds progressed  favourably and he was able to resume his ordinary avocations.    Miss Gibson's visit--but why should I speak of her in these formal  terms? To me, when I thought of her, which I did only too often, she was  Juliet, with perhaps an adjective thrown in; and as Juliet I shall  henceforth speak of her (but without the adjective) in this narrative,  wherein nothing has been kept back from the reader--Juliet's visit,  then, had been a great success, for my colleague was really pleased by  the attention, and displayed a quiet geniality that filled our visitor  with delight.    He talked a good deal of Reuben, and I could see that he was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11153"],[0,"No Hero (#17)"],[1," \"while he is still up the Matterhorn and I  shouldn't let him know where I--shouldn't give him a chance of finding  out--\"    A sudden peal of laughter cut me short. I could not have believed it  came from my companion. But no other soul was near us, though I looked  all ways. It was the merriest laughter imaginable, only the merriment  was harsh and hard.    \"Oh, thank you, Captain Clephane! You are too delicious! I saw it  coming; I only wondered whether I could contain myself until it came.  Yet I could hardly believe that even you would commit yourself to that  finishing touch of impudence! Certainly it is an opportunity, _his_  being out of the way. _You_ were not long in making use of it, were you?  It will amuse him when he comes down, though it may open his eyes. I  shall tell him everything, so I give you warning. Every single thing,  that you have had the insolence to tell me!\"    She had caught up her skirts from the ground, she had half turned away  from me, toward the hotel. The false merriment had died out of her. The  true indignation remained, ringing in every accent of the deep sweet  voice, and drawn up in every inch of the tall straight figure. I do not  remember whether the moon was hid or shining at the moment. I only know  that my lady's eyes shone bright enough for me to see them then and ever  after, bright and dry with a scorn that burnt too hot for tears; and  that I admired her even while she scorned me, as I had never thought to  admire any woman but one, but this woman least of all.    So we both stood, intent, some seconds, looking our last upon each other  if I was wise. Then I lifted my hat, and offered my congratulations  (more sincere than they sounded) to her and Bob.    \"Did I tell you why he is going up?\" I added. \"It is to pass the time  until he knows his fate. If only we could let him know it now!\"    Mrs. Lascelles glanced toward the mountain, and my eyes followed hers.  A great cloud hid the grim outstanding summit.    \"If only you had prevented him from going!\" she cried back at me in a  last reproach; and to me her tone was conclusive, it rang so true, and  so invidiously free from the smaller emotions which it had been my own  unhappiness to inspire. It was the real woman who had spoken out once  more, suddenly, perhaps unthinkingly, but obviously from her heart. And  as she turned, I followed her very slowly and without a word; for now  was I surely and deservedly undone.          CHAPTER XI    THE LION'S MOUTH      It was a chilly morning, with rather a high wind; from the haze about  the mountains of the Zermatt valley, which were all that I could see  from my bedroom window, it occurred to me that I might look in vain for  the Matterhorn from the other side of the hotel. It was still visible,  however, when I came down, a white cloud wound about its middle like a  cloth, and the hotel telescope already trained upon its summit from the  shelter of the glass veranda.    \"See anybody?\" I asked of a man who sat at the telescope as though his  eye was frozen to the lens. He might have been witnessing the most  exciting adventure, where the naked eye saw only rock and snow, and cold  grey sky; but he rose at last with a shake of the head, a great gaunt  man with kind keen eyes, and the skin peeled off his nose.    \"No,\" said he, \"I can't see anybody, and I'm very glad I can't. It's  about as bad a morning for it as you could possibly have; yet last night  was so fine that some fellows might have got up to the hut, and been  foolish enough not to come down again. But have a look for yourself.\"    \"Oh, thanks,\" said I, considerably relieved at what I heard, \"but if you  can't see anybody I'm sure I can't. You have done it yourself, I  daresay?\"    The gaunt man smiled demurely, and the keen eyes twinkled in his flayed  face. He was, indeed, a palpable mountaineer.    \"What, the Matterhorn?\" said he, lowering his voice and looking about  him as if on the point of some discreditable admission. \"Oh, yes, I've  done the Matterhorn, back and front and both sides, with and without  guides; but everybody has, in these days. It's nothing when you know the  ropes and chains and things. They've got everything up there now except  an iron staircase. Still, I should be sorry to tackle it to-day, even if  they had a lift!\"    \"Do you think guides would?\" I asked, less reassured than I had felt at  first.    \"It depends on the guides. They are not the first to turn back, as a  rule; but they like wind and mist even less than we do. The guides know  what wind and mist mean.\"    I now understood the special disadvantages of the day and realised the  obvious dangers. I could only hope that either Bob Evers or his guides  had shown the one kind of courage required by the occasion, the moral  courage of turning back. But I was not at all sure of Bob. His stimulus  was not that of the single-minded, level-headed mountaineer; in his  romantic exaltation he was capable of hailing the very perils as so many  more means of grace in the sight of Mrs. Lascelles; yet without doubt he  would have repudiated any such incentive, and that in all the sincerity  of his simple heart. He did not know himself as I knew him.    My fears were soon confirmed. Returning to the glass veranda, after the  stock breakfast of the Swiss hotel, with its horseshoe rolls and  fabricated honey, I found the telescope the centre of an ominous crowd,  on whose fringe hovered my new friend the mountaineer.    \"We were wrong,\" he muttered to me. \"Some fools are up there, after  all.\"    \"How many?\" I asked quickly.    \"I don't know. There's no getting near the telescope now, and won't be  till the clouds blot them out altogether.\"    I looked out at the Matterhorn. The loincloth of cloud had shaken itself  out into a flowing robe, from which only the brown skull of the mountain  protruded in its white skull-cap.    \"There are three of them,\" announced a nasal voice from the heart of the  little crowd. \"A great long chap and two guides.\"    \"He can't possibly know that,\" remarked the mountaineer to me, \"but  let's hope it is so.\"    \"They're as plain as pike-staffs,\" continued Quinby, whose bent blond  head I now distinguished, as he occupied the congenial post of Sister  Anne. \"They seem stuck.... No, they're getting up on to the snow-slope,  and the front man's cutting steps.\"    \"Then they're all right for the present,\" said the mountaineer. \"It's  the getting down that's ticklish.\"    \"You can see the rope blowing about between them ... what a wind there  must be ... it's bent out taut like a bow, you can see it against the  snow, and they're bending themselves more than forty-five degrees to  meet it.\"    \"All very well going _up_,\" murmured the mountaineer: there was a  sinister innuendo in the curt comments of the practical man.    I turned into the hall. It, however, was quite deserted. I had hoped I  might see something of Mrs. Lascelles; she was not one of those in the  glass veranda. I now looked in the drawing-room, but neither was she  there. Returning to the empty hall, I passed a minute peering through  the locked glass door of the pigeon-holes in which the careful concierge  files the unclaimed letters. There was nothing for me that I could  discern, in the C pigeon-hole; but next door but one, under E, there lay  on the very top a letter which caught my eye and more. It had not been  through any post. It was a note directed to R. Evers, Esq., in a hand  that I knew instinctively to be that of Mrs. Lascelles, though I had  never seen it in my life before. It was a good hand, but large and bold  and downright as herself.    The concierge stood in the doorway, one eye on the disappearing  Matterhorn, one on the experts and others in animated conclave round the  still inaccessible telescope. I touched the concierge on the arm.    \"Did you see Mrs. Lascelles this morning?\"    The man's eyes opened before his lips.    \"She has gone away, sir.\"    \"I know,\" I said, having indeed divined no less. \"What train did she  catch?\"    \"The first one from here. That also catches the early train from  Zermatt.\"    \"I am sorry,\" I said after a pause. \"I hoped to see Mrs. Lascelles  before she went; now I must write. She left you an address, I suppose?\"    \"Oh, yes, sir.\"    \"I shall ask you for it later on. No letters for me, I suppose?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Sure?\"    \"I will look again.\"    And I looked with him, over his shoulder; but there was nothing; and  the note for Bob Evers now inspired me with a tripartite blend of  curiosity, envy, and apprehension. I would have had a last word from the  same hand myself; had it been never so scornful, this silent scorn was  the harder sort to bear. Also I wanted much to know what her last word  was to Bob--and dreaded more what it might be.    There remained the unexpected triumph of having got rid of my lady after  all. That is not to be belittled even now. It is a triumph to succeed in  any undertaking, more especially when one has abandoned one's own last  hope of such success. The unpleasant character of this particular  emprise made its eventual accomplishment in some ways the greater matter  for congratulation in my eyes. At least I had done my part. I had come  to hate it, but the thing was done, and it had been a fairly difficult  thing to do. It was impossible not to plume oneself a little on the  whole, but the feeling was a superficial one, with deeper and uneasier  feelings underneath. Still, I had practically redeemed my impulsive  promise to Catherine Evers; her son and this woman once parted, it  should be easy to keep them apart, and my knowledge of the woman  forbade me to deny the fullest significance to her departure. She had  gone away to stay away--from Bob. She had listened to me the less with  her ears, because her reason and her heart had been compelled to heed.  To be sure, she saw the unsuitability, the impossibility, as clearly as  we did. But it was I"]]]
