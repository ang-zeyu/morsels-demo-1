Everything  possible was done to reinforce the upper bridge, but it was hourly  expected to give way under the strain of the whirling yellow waters. The  old Arab rivermen said that they could tell by the color just which of the  tributaries were in spate. When they saw or thought they saw a new  admixture, they would shake their heads and say: \"Such and such a river  is now also in flood--the Tigris will rise still further.\"    On the night of April 24 we at length got our orders and at six o'clock  the following morning we set out, prepared to run through to Ain Leilah.  The country was indeed changed since I passed through six weeks before.  The desert had blossomed. We ran through miles and miles of clover; the  sweet smell seemed so wholesomely American, recalling home and family, and  the meadows of Long Island. The brilliant red poppies were more in keeping  with the country; and we passed by Indian cavalry reinforcements with the  scarlet flowers stuck in their black hair and twined in the head-stalls of  the horses.    As we approached the hills they looked less bleak--a soft green clothed  the hollows, and the little oasis of Ain Leilah no longer stood out in the  same marked contrast as when last I visited it. The roads were in good  shape, and we reached camp at four in the afternoon. I took one of the  tenders and set off to look up some old friends in the regiments near by.  As I passed a group of Arabs that had just finished work on the roads, I  noticed that they were playing a game that was new to me. A stake was  driven into the ground, with a horsehair rope ten or twelve feet in length  attached to it. An old man had hold of the end of the rope. About the  stake were piled some clothes, and the Arabs were standing around in a  circle just out of reach of the man with the rope. The object was to dart  in and snatch up something from the heap without the old man who was on  guard catching you. They were enjoying themselves hugely--the oldest  graybeards behaving as if they were children--a very pleasant side of the  Arab.    Our instructions were to be ready to pull out before daybreak. The mission  was, as usual, a flanking one. The direct attack was to be delivered on  Kara Tepe, and, if that were successful, upon Kifri. We were to intercept  the arrival of reinforcements, or cut off the retreat of the garrisons, as  the case might be.    In the early morning hours the country was lovely--rolling grass land  \"with a hint of hills behind\"--miles of daisies with clusters of blood-red  poppies scattered through them--and occasional hollows carpeted with a  brilliant blue flower. In the river courses there were numbers of  brilliantly hued birds--the gayest colors I saw in Mesopotamia with the  exception of the vivid arsenic-green birds around Ana on the Euphrates.  In one place I thought that the ground was covered with red flowers, but a  close inspection proved it to be myriads of tiny red insects swarming on  the grass stems.    Column marching is slow and wearisome, and after the sun rose the heat  became intense. The dust smothered us; there was not a breath of air to  rid us of it for even a moment. The miles seemed interminable. At noon we  halted beside a narrow stream known as Oil River--a common name in this  part of the country where oil abounds and the water is heavily impregnated  with it. For drinking it was abominable--and almost spoiled the tea upon  which we relied for a staple. A few miles beyond, the engineers found a  suitable location to throw a bridge across the creek. The main body was  halted at a place known as Umr Maidan and we were sent over the bridge to  form across the main road leading from Kara Tepe back into the Turkish  territory.    It was nightfall before we had effected a crossing, and we groped our way  along until we came upon the road. It was impossible to do very much in  the way of selecting a position, but we arranged the cars as best we  could. When you were off at large in the desert you were what the army  called \"Out in the blue,\" and that was certainly our situation on the  night of April 26. We all expected that we would intercept traffic going  one way or the other, but the night passed without incident or excitement.    [Illustration: Indian cavalry bringing in prisoners after the charge]    By four in the morning we were once more feeling our way along through the  darkness. As it lightened we came under observation by the Turks, who  started in to shell us. We learned from our aeroplanes that Kifri had been  evacuated; the garrison was falling back along a road running parallel to  the one on which we were, separated by eight or ten miles of broken  country. By this time our cavalry had caught up with us. They pushed off  across country to intercept the Turks. We attempted to do likewise but it  was more difficult, and what with dodging in and out to avoid a ravine  here or a hill there, we made little headway. At length we struck a road  that led in approximately the direction whither we wished to go. It was  already early afternoon before, upon topping a rise, we caught sight of a  good-sized body of Turks marching on a road which ran along the base of  a range of steep, stony hills. We put on as much speed as was possible,  and headed north to try to intercept them. The cavalry were coming from  the south, and while we were circling around they charged in upon the  Turks. It was a stirring scene. The powerful Indians sat their horses with  the utmost grace. Their drawn sabres flashed in the sun. As they came to  close quarters the turbaned heads bent forward and we could hear the  shouts and high-pitched cries of triumph as the riders slashed at the foe.  The wounded and dead testified to their skill as swordsmen. The whole  sight reminded me more of the battle books I read as a boy than anything I  saw in the war. About six hundred prisoners were taken, but many of the  Turks escaped to the mountains and lay among the rocks, whence they could  snipe at us with impunity. They were a tenacious lot, for all next day  when we were using the road below the hills they continued to shoot at us  from the places whence it was impossible to dislodge them.    While the prisoners were being brought in we caught sight of one of our  aeroplanes crashing. Making our way over to it we found that neither the  pilot nor the observer was seriously hurt. Flying in Mesopotamia was made  unusually difficult by the climatic conditions. The planes were designed  for work in France and during the summer months the heat and dryness  warped the propeller blades and indeed all the wooden parts. Then, too,  the fine dust would get into the machinery when the aviator was taxiing  for a start. Many pilots coming out from France with brilliant records met  an early and untimely end because they could not realize how very  different the conditions were. I remember one poor young fellow who set  off on a reconnaissance without the food and water he was required by  regulations to carry. He got lost and ran out of gasolene--being forced to  land out in the desert. The armored cars went off in search of him, and on  the second morning after he had come down they found his body near their  bivouac. He had evidently got that far during the night and died of  exhaustion and exposure practically within hearing. He was stripped of his  clothes; whether this had been done by himself or by the tribesmen was  never determined. A death of this sort always seems so much sadder than  being legitimately killed in combat. The L.A.M. batteries were in close  touch with the Royal Flying Corps, for when news came in that a plane was  down in the desert or some part of the debatable land, we would be  detailed to go out in search of the occupants. A notice printed in Arabic,  Persian, Turkish, and Kurdish was fastened into each aeroplane informing  the reader of the reward that would be paid him if the pilot were brought  in safety to the British lines. This was done in case a plane got lost and  was driven down out of its course among the tribesmen.    The night of the 27th we bivouacked once more \"out in the blue.\" Dawn  found me on my way back to Umr Maidan to lay in a new supply of gasolene.  I made a rapid trip and caught up with the armored cars in action in a  large swampy plain. The grass was very high and the ground so soft that it  was difficult to accomplish anything. Two or three small hills offered  vantage-points, but they were not neglected by the Turk, and among those  that fell was the colonel of the Twenty-First cavalry--the regiment that  had acquitted itself so well in the charge of the day before.    We were ten miles from Tuz Khurmartli, the next important town held by  the enemy now that Kifri had been taken. It was thither that the Turks had  been retreating when we cut them off. Finding that we were unable to  operate effectively where we were, it was decided that we should make our  way across to the Kifri-Kirkuk road and advance along it to make a frontal  attack upon Tuz. Our orders were to proceed to a deserted village known as  Kulawand, and wait there for the command to advance. When we got to the  road we found the hills still occupied by camel-guns and machine-guns. We  replied ineffectively, for we had no means of dislodging them, nor did the  cavalry when they came up. Kulawand we found to be a fair-sized native  village unoccupied save for a single hut full of old women and children.  Here we waited until nightfall for the orders that never came. I sat under  a ruined wall reading alternatively Camoens' _Lusiad_ and _David Harum_  until darkness fell.    During the night some infantry came up, both native and British. They had  had stiff marching during the last few days, and were done up, but very  cheerful at the prospect of an attack on the morrow. They had some hard  fighting ahead of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13670"],[0,"The Happy Family (#17)"],[1,"yuh done it for!\" Slim cut  in disgustedly. \"It was nacherlay supposed you could ride; we got  _money_ up on yuh! And then, by golly, to go and make a fluke like  that before them Diamond G men--to go and let that blue roan pile yuh  up b'fore he'd got rightly started t' pitch--If yuh'd stayed with him  till he got t' swappin' ends there, it wouldn't uh looked quite so  bad. But t' go and git throwed down right in the start--By golly!\"  Slim faced Andy accusingly. \"B'fore them Diamond G men--and I've got  money up, by golly!\"    \"Yuh ain't lost any money yet, have yuh?\" Andy inquired patiently.  What Andy felt like doing was to \"wade into the bunch\"; reason,  however, told him that he had it coming from them, and to take his  medicine, since he could not well explain just how it had happened. He  could not in reason wonder that the faith of the Happy Family was  shattered and that they mourned as lost the money they had already  rashly wagered on the outcome of the contest. The very completeness of  their faith in him, their very loyalty, seemed to them their undoing,  for to them the case was plain enough. If Andy could not ride the blue  roan in their own corral, how was he to ride that same blue roan in  Great Falls? Or, if he could ride him, how could any sane man hope  that he could win the purse and the belt under the stringent rules of  the contest, where \"riding on the spurs,\" \"pulling leather\" and a  dozen other things were barred? So Andy, under the sting of their  innuendoes and blunt reproaches, was so patient as to seem to them  cowed.    \"No, I ain't lost any yet, but by golly, I can see it fixin' to fly,\"  Slim retorted heavily.    Andy looked around at the others, and smiled as sarcastically as was  possible considering the mood he was in. \"It sure does amuse me,\" he  observed, \"to see growed men cryin' before they're hurt! By gracious,  I expect t' make a stake out uh that fall! I can get long odds from  them Diamond Gs, and from anybody they get a chance to talk to. I'm  kinda planning,\" he lied boldly, \"to winter in an orange grove and  listen at the birds singing, after I'm through with the deal.\"    \"I reckon yuh can count on hearing the birds sing, all right,\" Pink  snapped back. \"It'll be _tra-la-la_ for yours, if last night's a fair  sample uh what yuh expect to do with the blue roan.\" Pink walked  abruptly away, looking very much like a sulky cherub.    \"I s'pose yuh're aiming to give us the impression that you're going to  ride, just the same,\" said Cal Emmett.    \"I sure am,\" came brief reply. Andy was beginning to lose his temper.  He had expected that the Happy Family would \"throw it into him,\" to a  certain extent, and he had schooled himself to take their drubbing.  What he had not expected was their unfriendly attitude, which went  beyond mere disappointment and made his offence--if it could be called  that--more serious than the occasion would seem to warrant. Perhaps  Jack Bates unwittingly made plain the situation when he remarked:    \"I hate to turn down one of our bunch; we've kinda got in the habit uh  hanging together and backing each other's play, regardless. But darn  it, we ain't millionaires, none of us--and gambling, it is a sin. I've  got enough up already to keep me broke for six months if I lose, and  the rest are in about the same fix. I ain't raising no long howl,  Andy, but you can see yourself where we're kinda bashful about sinking  any more on yuh than what we have. Maybe you can ride; I've heard yuh  can, and I've seen yuh make some fair rides, myself. But yuh sure fell  down hard last night, and my faith in yuh got a jolt that fair broke  its back. If yuh done it deliberate, for reasons we don't know, for  Heaven's sake say so, and we'll take your word for it and forget your  rep for lying. On the dead, Andy, did yuh fall off deliberate?\"    Andy bit his lip. His conscience had a theory of its own about  truth-telling, and permitted him to make strange assertions at times.  Still, there were limitations. The Happy Family was waiting for his  answer, and he knew instinctively that they would believe him now. For  a moment, temptation held him. Then he squared his shoulders and spoke  truly.    \"On the dead, I hit the ground unexpected and inadvertant. I--\"    \"If that's the case, then the farther yuh keep away from that contest  the better--if yuh ask _me_.\" Jack turned on his heel and followed  Pink.    Andy stared after him moodily, then glanced at the rest. With one  accord they avoided meeting his gaze. \"Damn a bunch uh quitters!\" he  flared hotly, and left them, to hunt up the Old Man and Chip--one or  both, it did not matter to him.    Pink it was who observed the Old Man writing a check for Andy. He took  it that Andy had called for his time, and when Andy rolled his bed and  stowed it away in the bunk-house, saddled a horse and rode up the  grade toward town, the whole outfit knew for a certainty that Andy had  quit.    Before many hours had passed they, too, saddled and rode away, with  the wagons and the cavvy following after--and they were headed for  Great Falls and the fair there to be held; or, more particularly, the  rough-riding contest to which they had looked forward eagerly and with  much enthusiasm, and which they were now approaching gloomily and in  deep humiliation. Truly, it would be hard to find a situation more  galling to the pride of the Happy Family.    But Andy Green had not called for his time, and he had no intention of  quitting; for Andy was also suffering from that uncomfortable malady  which we call hurt pride, and for it he knew but one remedy--a remedy  which he was impatient to apply. Because of the unfriendly attitude of  the Happy Family, Andy had refused to take them into his confidence,  or to ride with them to the fair. Instead, he had drawn what money was  still placed to his credit on the pay-roll, had taken a horse and his  riding outfit and gone away to Dry Lake, where he intended to take the  train for Great Falls.    In Dry Lake, however, he found that the story of his downfall had  preceded him, thanks to the exultant men of the Diamond G, and that  the tale had not shrunk in the telling. Dry Lake jeered him as openly  as it dared, and part of it--that part which had believed in him--was  quite as unfriendly as was the Happy Family. To a man they took it for  granted that he would withdraw from the contest, and they were not  careful to conceal what they thought. Andy found himself rather left  alone, and he experienced more than once the unpleasant sensation of  having conversation suddenly lag when he came near, and of seeing  groups of men dissolve awkwardly at his approach. Andy, before he had  been in town an hour, was in a mood to do violence.    For that reason he kept his plans rigidly to himself. When someone  asked him if he had quit the outfit, he had returned gruffly that the  Flying U was not the only cow-outfit in the country, and let the  questioner interpret it as he liked. When the train that had its nose  pointed to the southwest slid into town, Andy did not step on, as had  been his intention. He remained idly leaning over the bar in Rusty  Brown's place, and gave no heed. Later, when the eastbound came  schreeching through at midnight, it found Andy Green on the platform  with his saddle, bridle, chaps, quirt and spurs neatly sacked, and  with a ticket for Havre in his pocket. So the wise ones said that they  knew Andy would never have the nerve to show up at the fair, after the  fluke he had made at the Flying U ranch, and those whose pockets were  not interested considered it a very good joke.    At Havre, Andy bought another ticket and checked the sack which held  his riding outfit; the ticket had Great Falls printed on it in bold,  black lettering. So that he was twelve hours late in reaching his  original destination, and to avoid unwelcome discovery and comment he  took the sleeper and immediately ordered his berth made up, that he  might pass through Dry Lake behind the sheltering folds of the berth  curtains. Not that there was need of this elaborate subterfuge. He was  simply mad clear through and did not want to see or hear the voice of  any man he knew. Besides, the days when he had danced in spangled  tights upon the broad, gray rump of a galloping horse while a  sober-clothed man in the middle of the ring cracked a whip and yelped  commands, had bred in him the unconscious love of a spectacular entry  and a dramatic finish.    That is why he sought out the most obscure rooming house that gave any  promise of decency and comfort, and stayed off Central Avenue and away  from its loitering groups of range dwellers who might know him. That  is why he hired a horse and rode early and alone to the fair grounds  on the opening day, and avoided, by a roundabout trail a certain  splotch of gray-white against the brown of the prairie, which he knew  instinctively to be the camp of the Flying U outfit, which had made  good time and were located to their liking near the river. Andy felt a  tightening of the chest when he saw the familiar tents, and kicked his  hired horse ill-naturedly in the ribs. It was all so different from  what he had thought it would be.    In those last two weeks, he had pictured himself riding vaingloriously  through town on his best horse, with a new Navajo saddle-blanket  making a dab of bright color, and a new Stetson hat dimpled  picturesquely as to crown and tilted rakishly over one eye, and with  his silver-mounted spurs catching the light; around him would ride the  Happy Family, also in gala attire and mounted upon the best horses in  their several strings. The horses would not approve of the  street-cars, and would circle and back--and it was quite possible,  even probable, that there would be some pitching and some pretty  riding before the gaping populace which did not often get a chance to  view the real thing. People would stop and gaze while"]]]
