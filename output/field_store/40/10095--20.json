We see a small plant with  linear leaves, and a stalk not thicker than a crow's quill; on digging  down a foot or eighteen inches beneath, we come to a tuber, often as  large as the head of a young child; when the rind is removed, we find it  to be a mass of cellular tissue, filled with fluid much like that in a  young turnip. Owing to the depth beneath the soil at which it is found,  it is generally deliciously cool and refreshing. Another kind, named  Mokuri, is seen in other parts of the country, where long-continued  heat parches the soil. This plant is an herbaceous creeper, and deposits  under ground a number of tubers, some as large as a man's head, at spots  in a circle a yard or more, horizontally, from the stem. The natives  strike the ground on the circumference of the circle with stones, till,  by hearing a difference of sound, they know the water-bearing tuber to  be beneath. They then dig down a foot or so, and find it.    But the most surprising plant of the Desert is the \"Kengwe or Keme\"  ('Cucumis caffer'), the watermelon. In years when more than the usual  quantity of rain falls, vast tracts of the country are literally covered  with these melons; this was the case annually when the fall of rain was  greater than it is now, and the Bakwains sent trading parties every year  to the lake. It happens commonly once every ten or eleven years, and  for the last three times its occurrence has coincided with an  extraordinarily wet season. Then animals of every sort and name,  including man, rejoice in the rich supply. The elephant, true lord of  the forest, revels in this fruit, and so do the different species of  rhinoceros, although naturally so diverse in their choice of pasture.  The various kinds of antelopes feed on them with equal avidity, and  lions, hyaenas, jackals, and mice, all seem to know and appreciate the  common blessing. These melons are not, however, all of them eatable;  some are sweet, and others so bitter that the whole are named by the  Boers the \"bitter watermelon\". The natives select them by striking  one melon after another with a hatchet, and applying the tongue to the  gashes. They thus readily distinguish between the bitter and sweet.  The bitter are deleterious, but the sweet are quite wholesome. This  peculiarity of one species of plant bearing both sweet and bitter fruits  occurs also in a red, eatable cucumber, often met with in the country.  It is about four inches long, and about an inch and a half in diameter.  It is of a bright scarlet color when ripe. Many are bitter, others quite  sweet. Even melons in a garden may be made bitter by a few bitter kengwe  in the vicinity. The bees convey the pollen from one to the other.    The human inhabitants of this tract of country consist of Bushmen and  Bakalahari. The former are probably the aborigines of the southern  portion of the continent, the latter the remnants of the first  emigration of Bechuanas. The Bushmen live in the Desert from choice, the  Bakalahari from compulsion, and both possess an intense love of liberty.  The Bushmen are exceptions in language, race, habits, and appearance.  They are the only real nomads in the country; they never cultivate  the soil, nor rear any domestic animal save wretched dogs. They are so  intimately acquainted with the habits of the game that they follow them  in their migrations, and prey upon them from place to place, and thus  prove as complete a check upon their inordinate increase as the other  carnivora. The chief subsistence of the Bushmen is the flesh of game,  but that is eked out by what the women collect of roots and beans, and  fruits of the Desert. Those who inhabit the hot sandy plains of the  Desert possess generally thin, wiry forms, capable of great exertion and  of severe privations. Many are of low stature, though not dwarfish;  the specimens brought to Europe have been selected, like costermongers'  dogs, on account of their extreme ugliness; consequently, English  ideas of the whole tribe are formed in the same way as if the ugliest  specimens of the English were exhibited in Africa as characteristic of  the entire British nation. That they are like baboons is in some degree  true, just as these and other simiae are in some points frightfully  human.    The Bakalahari are traditionally reported to be the oldest of the  Bechuana tribes, and they are said to have possessed enormous herds of  the large horned cattle mentioned by Bruce, until they were despoiled  of them and driven into the Desert by a fresh migration of their own  nation. Living ever since on the same plains with the Bushmen, subjected  to the same influences of climate, enduring the same thirst, and  subsisting on similar food for centuries, they seem to supply a standing  proof that locality is not always sufficient of itself to account for  difference in races. The Bakalahari retain in undying vigor the Bechuana  love for agriculture and domestic animals. They hoe their gardens  annually, though often all they can hope for is a supply of melons and  pumpkins. And they carefully rear small herds of goats, though I have  seen them lift water for them out of small wells with a bit of ostrich  egg-shell, or by spoonfuls. They generally attach themselves to  influential men in the different Bechuana tribes living adjacent to  their desert home, in order to obtain supplies of spears, knives,  tobacco, and dogs, in exchange for the skins of the animals they may  kill. These are small carnivora of the feline species, including two  species of jackal, the dark and the golden; the former, \"motlose\"  ('Megalotis capensis' or 'Cape fennec'), has the warmest fur the country  yields; the latter, \"pukuye\" ('Canis mesomelas' and 'C. aureus'), is  very handsome when made into the skin mantle called kaross. Next in  value follow the \"tsipa\" or small ocelot ('Felis nigripes'), the \"tuane\"  or lynx, the wild cat, the spotted cat, and other small animals. Great  numbers of 'puti' ('duiker') and 'puruhuru' ('steinbuck') skins are got  too, besides those of lions, leopards, panthers, and hyaenas. During the  time I was in the Bechuana country, between twenty and thirty thousand  skins were made up into karosses; part of them were worn by the  inhabitants, and part sold to traders: many, I believe, find their way  to China. The Bakwains bought tobacco from the eastern tribes, then  purchased skins with it from the Bakalahari, tanned them, and sewed them  into karosses, then went south to purchase heifer-calves with them, cows  being the highest form of riches known, as I have often noticed from  their asking \"if Queen Victoria had many cows.\" The compact they  enter into is mutually beneficial, but injustice and wrong are often  perpetrated by one tribe of Bechuanas going among the Bakalahari of  another tribe, and compelling them to deliver up the skins which they  may be keeping for their friends. They are a timid race, and in bodily  development often resemble the aborigines of Australia. They have thin  legs and arms, and large, protruding abdomens, caused by the coarse,  indigestible food they eat. Their children's eyes lack lustre. I never  saw them at play. A few Bechuanas may go into a village of Bakalahari,  and domineer over the whole with impunity; but when these same  adventurers meet the Bushmen, they are fain to change their manners  to fawning sycophancy; they know that, if the request for tobacco is  refused, these free sons of the Desert may settle the point as to its  possession by a poisoned arrow.    The dread of visits from Bechuanas of strange tribes causes the  Bakalahari to choose their residences far from water; and they not  unfrequently hide their supplies by filling the pits with sand and  making a fire over the spot. When they wish to draw water for use, the  women come with twenty or thirty of their water-vessels in a bag or net  on their backs. These water-vessels consist of ostrich egg-shells, with  a hole in the end of each, such as would admit one's finger. The women  tie a bunch of grass to one end of a reed about two feet long, and  insert it in a hole dug as deep as the arm will reach; then ram down  the wet sand firmly round it. Applying the mouth to the free end of  the reed, they form a vacuum in the grass beneath, in which the water  collects, and in a short time rises into the mouth. An egg-shell is  placed on the ground alongside the reed, some inches below the mouth of  the sucker. A straw guides the water into the hole of the vessel, as  she draws mouthful after mouthful from below. The water is made to pass  along the outside, not through the straw. If any one will attempt to  squirt water into a bottle placed some distance below his mouth, he will  soon perceive the wisdom of the Bushwoman's contrivance for giving the  stream direction by means of a straw. The whole stock of water is thus  passed through the woman's mouth as a pump, and, when taken home,  is carefully buried. I have come into villages where, had we acted a  domineering part, and rummaged every hut, we should have found nothing;  but by sitting down quietly, and waiting with patience until the  villagers were led to form a favorable opinion of us, a woman would  bring out a shellful of the precious fluid from I know not where.    The so-called Desert, it may be observed, is by no means a useless  tract of country. Besides supporting multitudes of both small and large  animals, it sends something to the market of the world, and has proved  a refuge to many a fugitive tribe--to the Bakalahari first, and to the  other Bechuanas in turn--as their lands were overrun by the tribe of  true Caffres, called Matebele. The Bakwains, the Bangwaketze, and the  Bamangwato all fled thither; and the Matebele marauders, who came from  the well-watered east, perished by hundreds in their attempts to follow  them. One of the Bangwaketze chiefs, more wily than the rest, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10430"],[0,"Trips to the Moon (#17)"],[1,"I came up, take out my own eyes and put  in the eagle's; thus imperfect, to be sure, I am not royally  furnished, but a kind of bastard bird.\"  \"You may have one royal  eye, for all that, if you please; it is only when you rise up to  fly, holding the vulture's wing still, and moving the eagle's only;  by which means, you will see clearly with one, though not at all  with the other.\"  \"That will do, and is sufficient for me; I have  often seen smiths, and other artists, look with one eye only, to  make their work the truer.\"  This conversation ended, Empedocles  vanished into smoke, and I saw no more of him.  I acted as he  advised me, and no sooner moved my eagle's wing, than a great light  came all around me, and I saw everything as clear as possible:  looking down to earth, I beheld distinctly cities and men, and  everything that passed amongst them; not only what they did openly,  but whatever was going on at home, and in their own houses, where  they thought to conceal it.  I saw Lysimachus betrayed by his son;  {172a} Antiochus intriguing with his mother-in-law; {172b} Alexander  the Thessalian slain by his wife; and Attalus poisoned by his son:  in another place I saw Arsaces killing his wife, and the eunuch  Arbaces drawing his sword upon Arsaces; Spartim, the Mede, dragged  by the heels from the banquet by his guards, and knocked on the head  with a cup.  In the palaces of Scythia and Thrace the same  wickedness was going forward; and nothing could I see but murderers,  adulterers, conspirators, false swearers, men in perpetual terrors,  and betrayed by their dearest friends and acquaintance.    Such was the employment of kings and great men:  in private houses  there was something more ridiculous; there I saw Hermodorus the  Epicurean forswearing himself for a thousand drachmas; Agathocles  the Stoic quarrelling with his disciples about the salary for  tuition; Clinias the orator stealing a phial out of the temple; not  to mention a thousand others, who were undermining walls, litigating  in the forum, extorting money, or lending it upon usury; a sight,  upon the whole, of wonderful variety.    FRIEND.    It must have been very entertaining; let us have it all, I desire.    MENIPPUS.    I had much ado to see, to relate it to you is impossible; it was  like Homer's shield, {173} on one side were feasting and nuptials,  on the other haranguing and decrees; here a sacrifice, and there a  burial; the Getae at war, the Scythians travelling in their  caravans, the Egyptians tilling their fields, the Phoenicians  merchandising, the Cilicians robbing and plundering, the Spartans  flogging their children, and the Athenians perpetually quarrelling  and going to law with one another.    When all this was doing, at the same time, you may conceive what a  strange medley this appeared to me; it was just as if a number of  dancers, or rather singers, were met together, and every one was  ordered to leave the chorus, and sing his own song, each striving to  drown the other's voice, by bawling as loud as he could; you may  imagine what kind of a concert this would make.    FRIEND.    Truly ridiculous and confused, no doubt.    MENIPPUS.    And yet such, my friend, are all the poor performers upon earth, and  of such is composed the discordant music of human life; the voices  not only dissonant and inharmonious, but the forms and habits all  differing from each other, moving in various directions, and  agreeing in nothing; till at length the great master {175a} of the  choir drives everyone of them from the stage, and tells him he is no  longer wanted there; then all are silent, and no longer disturb each  other with their harsh and jarring discord.  But in this wide and  extensive theatre, full of various shapes and forms, everything was  matter of laughter and ridicule.  Above all, I could not help  smiling at those who quarrel about the boundaries of their little  territory, and fancy themselves great because they occupy a  Sicyonian {175b} field, or possess that part of Marathon which  borders on Oenoe, or are masters of a thousand acres in Acharnae;  when after all, to me, who looked from above, Greece was but four  fingers in breadth, and Attica a very small portion of it indeed.  I  could not but think how little these rich men had to be proud of; he  who was lord of the most extensive country owned a spot that  appeared to me about as large as one of Epicurus's atoms.  When I  looked down upon Peloponnesus, and beheld Cynuria, {176a} I  reflected with astonishment on the number of Argives and  Lacedemonians who fell in one day, fighting for a piece of land no  bigger than an Egyptian lentil; and when I saw a man brooding over  his gold, and boasting that he had got four cups or eight rings, I  laughed most heartily at him:  whilst the whole Pangaeus, {176b}  with all its mines, seemed no larger than a grain of millet.    FRIEND.    A fine sight you must have had; but how did the cities and the men  look?    MENIPPUS.    You have often seen a crowd of ants running to and fro in and out of  their city, some turning up a bit of dung, others dragging a bean-  shell, or running away with half a grain of wheat.  I make no doubt  but they have architects, demagogues, senators, musicians, and  philosophers amongst them.  Men, my friend, are exactly like these:  if you approve not of the comparison, recollect, if you please, the  ancient Thessalian fables, and you will find that the Myrmidons,  {177} a most warlike nation, sprung originally from pismires.    When I had thus seen and diverted myself with everything, I shook my  wings and flew off,         \"To join the sacred senate of the skies.\" {178a}    Scarce had I gone a furlong, when the Moon, in a soft female voice,  cried out to me, \"Menippus, will you carry something for me to  Jupiter, so may your journey be prosperous?\"  \"With all my heart,\"  said I, \"if it is nothing very heavy.\"  \"Only a message,\" replied  she, \"a small petition to him:  my patience is absolutely worn out  by the philosophers, who are perpetually disputing about me, who I  am, of what size, how it happens that I am sometimes round and full,  at others cut in half; some say I am inhabited, others that I am  only a looking-glass hanging over the sea, and a hundred conjectures  of this kind; even my light, {178b} they say, is none of my own, but  stolen from the Sun; thus endeavouring to set me and my brother  together by the ears, not content with abusing him, and calling him  a hot stone, and a mass of fire.  In the meantime, I am no stranger  to what these men, who look so grave and sour all day, are doing o'  nights; but I see and say nothing, not thinking it decent to lay  open their vile and abominable lives to the public; for when I catch  them thieving, or practising any of their nocturnal tricks, I wrap  myself up in a cloud, that I may not expose to the world a parcel of  old fellows, who, in spite of their long beards, and professions of  virtue, are guilty of every vice, and yet they are always railing at  and abusing me.  I swear by night I have often resolved to move  farther off to get out of reach of their busy tongues; and I beg you  would tell Jupiter that I cannot possibly stay here any longer,  unless he will destroy these naturalists, stop the mouths of the  logicians, throw down the Portico, burn the Academy, and make an end  of the inhabitants of Peripatus; so may I enjoy at last a little  rest, which these fellows are perpetually disturbing.\"  \"It shall be  done,\" said I, and away I set out for heaven, where         \"No tracks of beasts or signs of men are found.\" {179}    In a little time the earth was invisible, and the moon appeared very  small; and now, leaving the sun on my right hand, I flew amongst the  stars, and on the third day reached my journey's end.  At first I  intended to fly in just as I was, thinking that, being half an  eagle, I should not be discovered, as that bird was an old  acquaintance of Jupiter's, but then it occurred to me that I might  be found out by my vulture's wing, and laid hold on:  deeming it,  therefore, most prudent not to run the hazard, I went up, and  knocked at the door:  Mercury heard me, and asking my name, went off  immediately, and carried it to his master; soon after I was let in,  and, trembling and quaking with fear, found all the gods sitting  together, and seemingly not a little alarmed at my appearance there,  expecting probably that they should soon have a number of winged  mortals travelling up to them in the same manner:  when Jupiter,  looking at me with a most severe and Titanic {180a} countenance,  cried out,         \"Say who thou art, and whence thy country, name        Thy parents--\" {180b}    At this I thought I should have died with fear; I stood motionless,  and astonished at the awfulness and majesty of his voice; but  recovering myself in a short time, I related to him everything from  the beginning, how desirous I was of knowing sublime truths, how I  went to the philosophers, and hearing them contradict one another,  and driven to despair, thought on the scheme of making me wings,  with all that had happened in my journey quite up to heaven.  I then  delivered the message to him from the Moon, at which, softening his  contracted brow, he smiled at me, and cried, \"What were Otus and  Ephialtes {181} in comparison of Menippus, who has thus dared to fly  up to heaven; but come, we now invite you to supper with us; to-  morrow we will attend to your business, and dismiss you.\"  At these  words he rose up and went to that part of heaven where everything  from below could be heard most distinctly; for this, it seems, was  the time appointed to hear petitions.  As we went along, he asked me  several questions about earthly matters, such as, \"How much corn is  there at present in Greece? had you a hard winter last year? and did  your cabbages want rain? is any of Phidias's {182} family alive now?  what is "]]]
