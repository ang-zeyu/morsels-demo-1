I do think so, the youth replied. Are not then some men  also beautiful and others ugly? Certainly. Do we then for the same  reason call each of them in the same kind beautiful, or each beautiful  for something peculiar? And you will judge of this matter thus. Since we  see a dog naturally formed for one thing, and a horse for another, and  for another still, as an example, a nightingale, we may generally and  not improperly declare each of them to be beautiful then when it is most  excellent according to its nature; but since the nature of each is  different, each of them seems to me to be beautiful in a different way.  Is it not so? He admitted that it was. That then which makes a dog  beautiful, makes a horse ugly; and that which makes a horse beautiful,  makes a dog ugly, if it is true that their natures are different. It  seems to be so. For I think that what makes a Pancratiast beautiful,  makes a wrestler to be not good, and a runner to be most ridiculous; and  he who is beautiful for the Pentathlon, is very ugly for wrestling. It  is so, said he. What then makes a man beautiful? Is it that which in its  kind makes both a dog and a horse beautiful? It is, he said. What then  makes a dog beautiful? The possession of the excellence of a dog. And  what makes a horse beautiful? The possession of the excellence of a  horse. What then makes a man beautiful? Is it not the possession of the  excellence of a man? And do you then, if you wish to be beautiful, young  man, labor at this, the acquisition of human excellence? But what is  this? Observe whom you yourself praise, when you praise many persons  without partiality: do you praise the just or the unjust? The just.  Whether do you praise the moderate or the immoderate? The moderate. And  the temperate or the intemperate? The temperate. If then you make  yourself such a person, you will know that you will make yourself  beautiful; but so long as you neglect these things, you must be ugly  ([Greek: aischron]), even though you contrive all you can to appear  beautiful.           *       *       *       *       *    IN WHAT A MAN OUGHT TO BE EXERCISED WHO HAS MADE PROFICIENCY; AND THAT  WE NEGLECT THE CHIEF THINGS.--There are three things (topics, [Greek:  topoi]) in which a man ought to exercise himself who would be wise and  good. The first concerns the desires and the aversions, that a man may  not fail to get what he desires, and that he may not fall into that  which he does not desire. The second concerns the movements towards an  object and the movements from an object, and generally in doing what a  man ought to do, that he may act according to order, to reason, and not  carelessly. The third thing concerns freedom from deception and rashness  in judgment, and generally it concerns the assents ([Greek:  sugchatatheseis]). Of these topics the chief and the most urgent is that  which relates to the affects ([Greek: ta pathae] perturbations); for an  affect is produced in no other way than by a failing to obtain that  which a man desires or falling into that which a man would wish to  avoid. This is that which brings in perturbations, disorders, bad  fortune, misfortunes, sorrows, lamentations, and envy; that which makes  men envious and jealous; and by these causes we are unable even to  listen to the precepts of reason. The second topic concerns the duties  of a man; for I ought not to be free from affects ([Greek: apathae])  like a statue, but I ought to maintain the relations ([Greek: scheseis])  natural and acquired, as a pious man, as a son, as a father, as a  citizen.    The third topic is that which immediately concerns those who are making  proficiency, that which concerns the security of the other two, so that  not even in sleep any appearance unexamined may surprise us, nor in  intoxication, nor in melancholy. This, it may be said, is above our  power. But the present philosophers neglecting the first topic and the  second (the affects and duties), employ themselves on the third, using  sophistical arguments ([Greek: metapiptontas]), making conclusions from  questioning, employing hypotheses, lying. For a man must, it is said,  when employed on these matters, take care that he is not deceived. Who  must? The wise and good man. This then is all that is wanting to you.  Have you successfully worked out the rest? Are you free from deception  in the matter of money? If you see a beautiful girl do you resist the  appearance? If your neighbor obtains an estate by will, are you not  vexed? Now is there nothing else wanting to you except unchangeable  firmness of mind ([Greek: ametaptosia])? Wretch, you hear these very  things with fear and anxiety that some person may despise you, and with  inquiries about what any person may say about you. And if a man come and  tell you that in a certain conversation in which the question was, Who  is the best philosopher, a man who was present said that a certain  person was the chief philosopher, your little soul which was only a  finger's length stretches out to two cubits. But if another who is  present says, You are mistaken; it is not worth while to listen to a  certain person, for what does he know? he has only the first principles,  and no more? then you are confounded, you grow pale, you cry out  immediately, I will show him who I am, that I am a great philosopher. It  is seen by these very things: why do you wish to show it by others? Do  you not know that Diogenes pointed out one of the sophists in this way  by stretching out his middle finger? And then when the man was wild with  rage, This, he said, is the certain person: I have pointed him out to  you. For a man is not shown by the finger, as a stone or a piece of  wood; but when any person shows the man's principles, then he shows him  as a man.    Let us look at your principles also. For is it not plain that you value  not at all your own will ([Greek: proairesis]), but you look externally  to things which are independent of your will? For instance, what will a  certain person say? and what will people think of you? Will you be  considered a man of learning; have you read Chrysippus or Antipater? for  if you have read Archedamus also, you have every thing (that you can  desire). Why you are still uneasy lest you should not show us who you  are? Would you let me tell you what manner of man you have shown us that  you are? You have exhibited yourself to us as a mean fellow, querulous,  passionate, cowardly, finding fault with everything, blaming everybody,  never quiet, vain: this is what you have exhibited to us. Go away now  and read Archedamus; then if a mouse should leap down and make a noise,  you are a dead man. For such a death awaits you as it did--what was the  man's name--Crinis; and he too was proud, because he understood  Archedamus. Wretch, will you not dismiss these things that do not  concern you at all? These things are suitable to those who are able to  learn them without perturbation, to those who can say: \"I am not subject  to anger, to grief, to envy: I am not hindered, I am not restrained.  What remains for me? I have leisure, I am tranquil: let us see how we  must deal with sophistical arguments; let us see how when a man has  accepted an hypothesis he shall not be led away to any thing absurd.\" To  them such things belong. To those who are happy it is appropriate to  light a fire, to dine; if they choose, both to sing and to dance. But  when the vessel is sinking, you come to me and hoist the sails.           *       *       *       *       *    WHAT IS THE MATTER ON WHICH A GOOD MAN SHOULD BE EMPLOYED, AND IN WHAT  WE OUGHT CHIEFLY TO PRACTISE OURSELVES.--The material for the wise and  good man is his own ruling faculty: and the body is the material for the  physician and the aliptes (the man who oils persons); the land is the  matter for the husbandman. The business of the wise and good man is to  use appearances conformably to nature: and as it is the nature of every  soul to assent to the truth, to dissent from the false, and to remain in  suspense as to that which is uncertain; so it is its nature to be moved  towards the desire for the good, and to aversion from the evil; and with  respect to that which is neither good nor bad it feels indifferent. For  as the money-changer (banker) is not allowed to reject Caesar's coin, nor  the seller of herbs, but if you show the coin, whether he chooses or  not, he must give up what is sold for the coin; so it is also in the  matter of the soul. When the good appears, it immediately attracts to  itself; the evil repels from itself. But the soul will never reject the  manifest appearance of the good, any more than persons will reject  Caesar's coin. On this principle depends every movement both of man and  God.    Against (or with respect to) this kind of thing chiefly a man should  exercise himself. As soon as you go out in the morning, examine every  man whom you see, every man whom you hear; answer as to a question, What  have you seen? A handsome man or woman? Apply the rule. Is this  independent of the will, or dependent? Independent. Take it away. What  have you seen? A man lamenting over the death of a child. Apply the  rule. Death is a thing independent of the will. Take it away. Has the  proconsul met you? Apply the rule. What kind of a thing is a proconsul's  office? Independent of the will or dependent on it? Independent. Take  this away also; it does not stand examination; cast it away; it is  nothing to you.    If we practised this and exercised ourselves in it daily from morning to  night, something indeed would be done. But now we are forthwith caught  half asleep by every appearance, and it is only, if ever, that in the  school we are roused a little. Then when we go out, if we see a man  lamenting, we say, He is undone. If we see a consul, we say, He is  happy. If we see an exiled man, we say, He is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10662"],[0,"The Night Land (#17)"],[1,"while there came  from afar off, a sound as of a wind wailing; and it came onwards out of  the distance, and passed over the Hills of the Babes, which were a great  way off. And so came anigh to the place where I stood. Even as the  blowing of a sorrowful wind did it come; and I knew that all the great  multitudes did sing quietly; and the singing passed onwards, and left  behind it an utter silence; even as the wind doth rustle the corn, and  pass onwards, and all fall to a greater seeming quietness than before.  And the Dead passed inward through The Gateway, into the great light and  silence of the Dome; and came out no more.    And again from beyond the far Hills of the Babes there was that sound of  the millions singing; and there rose up out of the earth beneath, the  voices of the underground organs; and the noise of the sorrow passed  over me, and went again into the distance, and left all hushed.    And lo! as there passed inward to the silence of the Dome the last of  those dead Heroes, there came again the sound from beyond the Hills of  the Babes; and as it came more nigh, I knew that it was the Song of  Honour, loud and triumphant, and sung by countless multitudes. And the  Voices of the Organs rose up into thunder from the deep earth. And there  was a great Honour done to the glory of the Dead. And afterwards, once  more a silence.    Then did the Peoples of the Cities arrange themselves so that from every  city whence had come a Hero, were the People of that City gathered  together. And when they were so gathered, they set up Tokens of Memory  to the Dead of their City. But afterwards did charge Artists to the  making of sculpture great and beautiful to that same end; and now did  but place Tablets against that time.    And afterwards the People did wander over that Country of Silence, and  made visit and honour to their Ancestors, if such were deserving.    And presently, the mighty lifts did raise them all to the Cities of the  Pyramid; and thereafter there was something more of usualness; save that  ever the embrasures were full of those that watched the Youths afar upon  the Great Road. And in this place I to remember how that our spy-glasses  had surely some power of the Earth-Current to make greater the impulse  of the light upon the eye. And they were like no spy-glass that ever you  did see; but oddly shaped and to touch both the forehead and the eyes;  and gave wonderful sight of the Land. But the Great Spy-Glass to be  beyond all this; for it had the Eyes of it upon every side of The Mighty  Pyramid, and did be truly an Huge Machine.    And to me, as I went about my duties, or peered forth through the Great  Spy-Glass at the Youths upon the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, there  came at times a far faint thrilling of the aether; so that sometimes I  was aware that there was the beating of the Master-Word in the night;  but so strange and weak, that the Instruments had no wotting of it. And  when this came, then would I call back through all the everlasting night  to Naani, who was indeed Mirdath; and I would send the Master-Word with  my brain-elements; and afterwards such comfort as I might.    Yet hard and bitter was the truth of my helplessness and weakness, and  the utter terror and might of the Evil Forces and Monsters of the Night  Land. So that I was like to have brake my heart with pondering.    And the silence would come again; and anon the weak thrilling of the  Aether; but no more the far voice speaking in my soul.          V    INTO THE NIGHT LAND      Now, after that destruction which had come upon the Ten-thousand, and  the fresh assurance that was upon us of the terror of the Night Land, it  may be known that there could be no more thought to succour. Though, in  truth, those Youths that went now upon the Road Where The Silent Ones  Walk were far beyond our aid.    Yet might it be thought that we should have signalled to them, calling  by the Home-Call, which was that great Voice which went forth from the  Machine above the sealed base of the Mighty Pyramid. But this we might  not do; for then we gave signal to the Monsters of that Land, that some  were even now abroad from the Pyramid; yet we could no more than hope  that the Evil Forces had no wotting of them; for, in verity, none might  ever know the knowledge or the Ignorance which those Powers did possess.    Yet, it must be kept to the mind that we knew even then there was an  Influence abroad in the Land, strange and quiet; so that the Instruments  did not more than make record of it. And as I have surely set down ere  now, we had belief that it did come from that House of Silence, afar in  the Night Land, upon that low hill to the North of the Great Road. And  many among the Monstruwacans feared that it was directed upon the  Youths; but of this there could be no surety; and we could but wait and  watch.    Now, about this time those poor Youths did draw nigh to that part of the  Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, where it turned more swiftly to the  North; and they to be now at no mighty distance from that grim and  horrid House.    And presently we knew that the Influence had a greater Power in the  Land; and I had an assuredness that it came from the House; yet no  certain proof was this. But I set out my feelings to the Master  Monstruwacan; and he had trust in them and in my power; moreover, he  also had belief within himself that some secret Power came out from the  House of Silence.    And some talk there was at times that we send the Home-Call into the  night, to give warning to the Youths of our knowledge and our fear; and  to entreat them to make a safe endeavour to return swiftly. Yet was this  an error; and refused by the Master Monstruwacan; for it was not meet  that we put the souls of those Youths in peril, until such time as we  had certainty that they should be lost if we did not bestir ourselves.  For, indeed, this Home-Call was as a mighty Voice, calling over the  world, and did have so exceeding a noise, that it had immediately told  all that Land how that some were yet abroad from the Great Redoubt. And  here will I set down how that the Home-Call had no use in those ages;  but had been a Call in the olden time when yet the great flying-ships  went abroad over the world.    And there passed now a day and a night; and in all that time there  ceased not great multitudes to peer forth into the Night Land at the  Youths. For it was known concerning the Influence, and all felt that the  Youths did draw nigh very speedy to their fate; and much talk there was;  and many things said, and much foolish speech, and kind intent; but no  courage to go forth to make further attempt to rescue; which, in truth,  calls not for great astonishment, as I have surely writ or oft thought.    And in this place let me set down that the Land was, as it might be  said, waked, and unquiet, and a sense of things passing in the night,  and of horrid watchfulness; and there were, at this time and at that,  low roars that went across the Land. And if I have not told the same  before this time, it must be set to count against me and my telling;  for, indeed, I should have writ it down before this place. Yet is the  difficulty of my task great; and all must bear with me, and entreat for  me that I have courage, so that I may come at last to strength and  wisdom to tell all that I did see.    Now, in the space of this day and night, it was known that the Youths  had not slept, neither had they eaten, save once, as they who had the  watch through the Great Spy-Glass did affirm. But they to hasten alway  at a woeful speed towards the North, along that Great Dismal Road, so  that presently they must cease, or slay themselves with their endeavour.    And all this did give surety to our fears that they were under a spell  from that horrid House afar in the Land; and we had an assurance that  this thing was. For, presently, there came a Monstruwacan to the Master  Monstruwacan to report that there had come sudden a mighty Influence  into the Land; and in the same moment, as it might be, I spied through  the Great Spy-Glass, and did see those Youths break swiftly from the  Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, and begin to run very swift that they  might come quickly to the House of Silence.    Then did the Master Monstruwacan hesitate not; but did send the  Home-Call across the world, aye, even to those poor doomed ones that  hastened, unknowing, to the terror which did compel them. And  immediately upon the sound, the Master did send a message to the natural  eye, in set language, and made warning that they suffered themselves to  be drawn to their destruction by a Force that came from within the House  of Silence.    And he besought them to put forth the strength of their spirits, and do  battle for their souls; and if they could in no wise compass a victory  over _that which drew them onwards_, to slay themselves quickly, ere  they went into that House to the horror of utter destruction.    And in all the Pyramid was there a great silence; for the bellowing of  the Home-Call bred a quietness, because of that which it did portend;  and it was swiftly known by the millions that the Master Monstruwacan  did plead for the souls of the Youths; and there went forth,  unknowingly, a counter-force from the Mighty Pyramid, by reason of the  prayers and soul-wishings of the countless millions.    And the counter-force was plain to my inward hearing, and beat all the  aether of the world into a surge of supplication; so that it stunned my  spirit with the great power of it. And it seemed to me, as it were,  that there was a vast spiritual-noise in all the night; and I spied  tremblingly through the Great Spy-Glass, and lo! the Youths did cease  from their swift running, and were come together in a crowd, and had a  seeming to be confused; as might some who have waked suddenly from  sleep, to find that they walked in their sleep, and had"]]]
