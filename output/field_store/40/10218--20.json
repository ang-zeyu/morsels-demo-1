At Monteponi the crystals  encrust cavities in glistening granular galena; and from Leadhills,  in Scotland, pseudomorphs of anglesite after galena are known. At most  localities it is found as isolated crystals in the lead-bearing  lodes, but at some places, in Australia and Mexico, it occurs as large  masses, and is then mined as an ore of lead, of which the pure mineral  contains 68%.        ANGLI, ANGLII or ANGLES, a Teutonic people mentioned by Tacitus in  his _Germania_ (cap. 40) at the end of the 1st century. He gives no  precise indication of their geographical position, but states that,  together with six other tribes, including the Varini (the Warni of  later times), they worshipped a goddess named Nerthus, whose sanctuary  was situated on \"an island in the Ocean.\" Ptolemy in his _Geography_  (ii. 11. Sec. 15), half a century later, locates them with more precision  between the Rhine, or rather perhaps the Ems, and the Elbe, and speaks  of them as one of the chief tribes of the interior. Unfortunately,  however, it is clear from a comparison of his map with the evidence  furnished by Tacitus and other Roman writers that the indications  which he gives cannot be correct. Owing to the uncertainty of these  passages there has been much speculation regarding the original home  of the Angli. One theory, which however has little to recommend it, is  that they dwelt in the basin of the Saale (in the neighbourhood of the  canton Engilin), from which region the _Lex Angliorum et Werinorum hoc  est Thuringorum_ is believed by many to have come. At the present time  the majority of scholars believe that the Angli had lived from the  beginning on the coasts of the Baltic, probably in the southern part  of the Jutish peninsula. The evidence for this view is derived partly  from English and Danish traditions dealing with persons and events of  the 4th century (see below), and partly from the fact that striking  affinities to the cult of Nerthus as described by Tacitus are to  be found in Scandinavian, especially Swedish and Danish, religion.  Investigations in this subject have rendered it very probable that  the island of Nerthus was Sjaelland (Zealand), and it is further to be  observed that the kings of Wessex traced their ancestry ultimately  to a certain Scyld, who is clearly to be identified with Skioeldr, the  mythical founder of the Danish royal family (Skioeldungar). In English  tradition this person is connected with \"Scedeland\" (pl.), a name  which may have been applied to Sjaelland as well as Skane, while in  Scandinavian tradition he is specially associated with the ancient  royal residence at Leire in Sjaelland.    Bede states that the Angli before they came to Britain dwelt in a  land called Angulus, and similar evidence is given by the _Historia  Brittonum_. King Alfred and the chronicler AEthelweard identified this  place with the district which is now called Angel in the province of  Schleswig (Slesvig), though it may then have been of greater extent,  and this identification agrees very well with the indications given by  Bede. Full confirmation is afforded by English and Danish traditions  relating to two kings named Wermund (_q.v._) and Offa (_q.v._), from  whom the Mercian royal family were descended, and whose exploits are  connected with Angel, Schleswig and Rendsburg. Danish tradition has  preserved record of two governors of Schleswig, father and son, in  their service, Frowinus (Freawine) and Wigo (Wig), from whom the royal  family of Wessex claimed descent. During the 5th century the Angli  invaded this country (see BRITAIN, _Anglo-Saxon_), after which time  their name does not recur on the continent except in the title of the  code mentioned above.    The province of Schleswig has proved exceptionally rich in prehistoric  antiquities which date apparently from the 4th and 5th centuries.  Among the places where these have been found, special mention should  be made of the large cremation cemetery at Borgstedterfeld, between  Rendsburg and Eckernfoerde, which has yielded many urns and brooches  closely resembling those found in heathen graves in England. Of still  greater importance are the great deposits at Thorsbjaerg (in Angel)  and Nydam, which contained large quantities of arms, ornaments,  articles of clothing, agricultural implements, &c., and in the latter  case even ships. By the help of these discoveries we are able to  reconstruct a fairly detailed picture of English civilization in the  age preceding the invasion of Britain.    AUTHORITIES.--Bede, _Hist.

[v.02 p.0019]        ANGLICAN COMMUNION, the name used to denote that great branch of the  Christian Church consisting of the various churches in communion with  the Church of England. The necessity for such a phrase as \"Anglican  Communion,\" first used in the 19th century, marked at once the immense  development of the Anglican Church in modern times and the change  which has taken place in the traditional conceptions of its character  and sphere. The Church of England itself is the subject of a separate  article (see ENGLAND, CHURCH OF); and it is not without significance  that for more than two centuries after the Reformation the history  of Anglicanism is practically confined to its developments within the  limits of the British Isles. Even in Ireland, where it was for over  three centuries the established religion, and in Scotland, where it  early gave way to the dominant Presbyterianism, its religious was long  overshadowed by its political significance. The Church, in fact,  while still claiming to be Catholic in its creeds and in its religious  practice, had ceased to be Catholic in its institutional conception,  which was now bound up with a particular state and also with a  particular conception of that state. To the native Irishman and the  Scotsman, as indeed to most Englishmen, the Anglican Church was one of  the main buttresses of the supremacy of the English crown and nation.  This conception of the relations of church and state was hardly  favourable to missionary zeal; and in the age succeeding the  Reformation there was no disposition on the part of the English Church  to emulate the wonderful activity of the Jesuits, which, in the 16th  and 17th centuries, brought to the Church of Rome in countries beyond  the ocean compensation for what she had lost in Europe through the  Protestant reformation. Even when English churchmen passed beyond the  seas, they carried with them their creed, but not their ecclesiastical  organization. Prejudice and real or imaginary legal obstacles stood in  the way of the erection of episcopal sees in the colonies; and though  in the 17th century Archbishop Laud had attempted to obtain a bishop  for Virginia, up to the time of the American revolution the churchmen  of the colonies had to make the best of the legal fiction that  their spiritual needs were looked after by the bishop of London, who  occasionally sent commissaries to visit them and ordained candidates  for the ministry sent to England for the purpose.    The change which has made it possible for Anglican churchmen to claim  that their communion ranks with those of Rome and the Orthodox East  as one of the three great historical divisions of the Catholic Church,  was due, in the first instance, to the American revolution. The  severance of the colonies from their allegiance to the crown brought  the English bishops for the first time face to face with the idea of  an Anglican Church which should have nothing to do either with the  royal supremacy or with British nationality. When, on the conclusion  of peace, the church-people of Connecticut sent Dr. Samuel Seabury to  England, with a request to the archbishop of Canterbury to consecrate  him, it is not surprising that Archbishop Moore refused. In the  opinion of prelates and lawyers alike, an act of parliament was  necessary before a bishop could be consecrated for a see abroad; to  consecrate one for a foreign country seemed impossible, since, though  the bestowal of the _potestas ordinis_ would be valid, the crown,  which, according to the law, was the source of the episcopal  _jurisdiction_, could hardly issue the necessary mandate for the  consecration of a bishop to a see outside the realm (see BISHOP).  The Scottish bishops, however, being hampered by no such legal  restrictions, were more amenable; and on the 11th of November 1784  Seabury was consecrated by them to the see of Connecticut. In 1786,  on the initiative of the archbishop, the legal difficulties in England  were removed by the act for the consecration of bishops abroad; and,  on being satisfied as to the orthodoxy of the church in America and  the nature of certain liturgical changes in contemplation, the two  English archbishops proceeded, on the 14th of February 1787,  to consecrate William White and Samuel Prevoost to the sees of  Pennsylvania and New York "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13602"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#17)"],[1,"plunged 'em in, while dem what had done been baptized sang:  \"Dar's a Love Feast in Heb'en Today.\"    \"Yes Ma'am, de white folkses had deir cemetery, an' dey had one for de  slaves.

Her  gingham dress was clean, and her wrinkled skin was a reddish-yellow  color, showing a large proportion of Indian and white blood. Har eyes  ware a faded blue.    \"I speck I is mos' white,\" acknowledged Nancy, \"but I ain't never knowed  who my father was. My mother was a dark color.\"    The cottage faced the pine grove behind an old church. Pink ramblers  grew everywhere, and the sandy yard was neatly kept. Nancy's paralyzed  granddaughter-in-law hovered in the doorway, her long smooth braids  hanging over Indian-brown shoulders, a loose wrapper of dark blue denim  flowing around her tall unsteady figure. She was eager to taka part in  the conversation but hampered by a thick tongue induced, as Nancy put  it, \"by a bad sore throat she ain't got over.\"    Nancy's recollections of plantation days were colored to a somber hue by  overwork, childbearing, poor food and long working hours.    \"Master was a hard taskmaster,\" said Nancy. \"My husband didn't live on  de same plantation where I was, de Jerrell places in Columbia County. He  never did have nuthin' to give me 'cause he never got nuthin'. He had to  come and ask my white folks for me. Dey had to carry passes everywhere  dey went, if dey didn't, dey'd git in trouble.    \"I had to work hard, plow and go and split wood jus' like a man.  Sometimes dey whup me. Dey whup me bad, pull de cloes off down to de  wais'--my master did it, our folks didn' have overseer.    \"We had to ask 'em to let us go to ohurch. Went to white folks church,  'tell de black folks get one of dere own. No'm I dunno how to read.  Never had no schools at all, didn' 'low us to pick up a piece paper and  look at it.\"    \"Nancy, wasn't your mistress kind to you?\"    \"Mistis was sorta kin' to me, sometimes. But dey only give me meat and  bread, didn' give me nothin' good--I ain' gwine tell no story. I had a  heap to undergo wid. I had to scour at night at de Big House--two planks  one night, two more de nex'. De women peoples spun at night and reeled,  so many cuts a night. Us had to git up befo' daybreak be ready to go to  de fiel's.    \"My master didn' have but three cullud people, dis yuh was what I stayed  wid, my young master, had not been long married and dus' de han's dey  give him when he marry was all he had.    \"Didn' have no such house as dis,\" Nancy looked into the open door of  the comfortable octtage, \"sometimes dey have a house built, it would be  daubed. Dus' one family, didn' no two families double up.\"    \"But the children had a good time, didn't they? They played games?\"    \"Maybe dey did play ring games, I never had no time to see what games my  chillus play, I work so hard. Heap o' little chillun slep' on de flo'.  Never had no frolics neither, no ma'm, and didn' go to none. We would  have prayer meetings on Saturday nights, and one might in de week us had  a chairback preacher, and sometimes a regular preacher would come in.\"    Nancy did not remember ever having seen the Patterollers.    \"I hearn talk of 'em you know, heap o' times dey come out and make out  like dey gwine shoot you at night, dey mus' been Patterollers, dey was  gettin' hold of a heap of 'em.\"    \"What did you do about funerals, Nancy?\"    \"Dey let us knock off for funerals, I tell de truth. Us stay up all  night, singin' and prayin'. Dey make de coffin outter pine boards.\"    \"Did you suffer during the war?\"    \"We done de bes' we could, we et what we could get, sometimes didn' have  nothin' to eat but piece of cornbread, but de white folks allus had  chicken.\"    \"But you had clothes to wear?\"    \"Us had clothes 'cause we spun de thread and weaved 'em. Dey bought dem  dere great big ole brogans where you couldn' hardly walk in 'em. Not  like dese shoes I got on.\" Nancy thrust out her foot, easy in \"Old  Ladies' Comforts.\"    \"When they told you were free, Nancy, did the master appear to be  angry?\"    \"No'm, white folks didn' 'pear to be mad. My master dus' tole us we was  free. Us moved right off, but not so far I couldn' go backwards and  forwards to see 'um.\" (So it was evident that even if Nancy's life had  been hard, there was a bond between her and her former owners.) \"I didn'  do no mo' work for 'um, I work for somebody else. Us rented land and  made what we could, so we could have little somethin' to eat. I scoured  and waited on white people in town, got little piece of money, and was  dus' as proud!\"    Nancy savored the recollection of her first earned money a moment,  thinking back to the old days.    \"I had a preacher for my second marriage,\" she continued, \"Fo' chillun  died on me--one girl, de yuthers was babies. White doctor tended me.\"    Asked about midwifery, Nancy smiled.    \"I was a midwife myself, to black and white, after freedom. De Thomson  doctors all liked me and tole people to 'git Nancy.' I used 'tansy  tea'--heap o' little root--made black pepper tea, fotch de pains on 'em.  When I would git to de place where I had a hard case, I would send for  de doctor, and he would help me out, yes, doctor help me out of all of  'em.\"    Asked about signs and superstitions, Nancy nodded.    \"I have seed things. Day look dus' like a person, walkin' in de woods. I  would look off and look back to see it again and it be gone.\" Nancy  lowered her voice mysteriously, and looked back into the little room  where Vanna's unsteady figure moved from bed to chair. \"I seed a coffin  floatin' in de air in dat room--\" she shivered, \"and I heard a heap o'  knockings. I dunno what it bees--but de sounds come in de house. I runs  ev'y squeech owl away what comes close, too.\" Nancy clasped her hands,  right thumb over left thumb, \"does dat--and it goes on away--dey quits  hollerin', you chokin' 'em when you does dat.\"    \"Do you plant by the moon, Nancy?\"    \"Plant when de moon change, my garden, corn, beans. I planted some beans  once on de wrong time of de moon and dey didn' bear nothing--I hated it  so bad, I didn' know what to do, so I been mindful ever since when I  plant.
