I,  where he is said to have sprung forth as the firstborn of creation  from the primeval waters. This being has twice been referred  to in the S'vetas'vatara, in III. 4 and IV. 12. It is indeed very strange  that this being is not referred to in any of the earlier Upani@sads.  In the two passages in which he has been spoken of, his mythical  character is apparent. He is regarded as one of the earlier  products in the process of cosmic creation, but his importance  from the point of view of the development of the theory of  Brahman or Atman is almost nothing. The fact that neither the  Puru@sa, nor the Vis'vakarma, nor the Hira@nyagarbha played an  important part in the earlier development of the Upani@sads  leads me to think that the Upani@sad doctrines were not directly  developed from the monotheistic tendencies of the later @Rg-Veda  speculations. The passages in S'vetas'vatara clearly show how from  the supreme eminence that he had in R.V.X. 121, Hira@nyagarbha  had been brought to the level of one of the created beings. Deussen  in explaining the philosophical significance of the Hira@nyagarbha  doctrine of the Upani@sads says that the \"entire objective universe is  possible only in so far as it is sustained by a knowing subject. This  subject as a sustainer of the objective universe is manifested in  all individual objects but is by no means identical with them. For  the individual objects pass away but the objective universe continues  to exist without them; there exists therefore the eternal  knowing subject also (_hira@nyagarbha_) by whom it is sustained.  Space and time are derived from this subject. It is itself accordingly  not in space and does not belong to time, and therefore  from an empirical point of view it is in general non-existent; it  has no empirical but only a metaphysical reality [Footnote ref 1].\" This  however seems to me to be wholly irrelevant, since the Hira@nyagarbha  doctrine cannot be supposed to have any philosophical importance  in the Upani@sads.        The Theory of Causation.    There was practically no systematic theory of causation in the  Upani@sads. S'a@nkara, the later exponent of Vedanta philosophy,  always tried to show that the Upani@sads looked upon the cause    ___________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Deussen's _Philosophy of the Upanishads_, p. 201.]    53    as mere ground of change which though unchanged in itself in  reality had only an appearance of suffering change. This he did  on the strength of a series of examples in the Chandogya  Upani@sad (VI. 1) in which the material cause, e.g. the clay, is  spoken of as the only reality in all its transformations as the pot,  the jug or the plate. It is said that though there are so many  diversities of appearance that one is called the plate, the other the  pot, and the other the jug, yet these are only empty distinctions of  name and form, for the only thing real in them is the earth which  in its essence remains ever the same whether you call it the pot,  plate, or Jug. So it is that the ultimate cause, the unchangeable  Brahman, remains ever constant, though it may appear to suffer  change as the manifold world outside. This world is thus only  an unsubstantial appearance, a mirage imposed upon Brahman,  the real _par excellence_.    It seems however that though such a view may be regarded  as having been expounded in the Upani@sads in an imperfect  manner, there is also side by side the other view which looks  upon the effect as the product of a real change wrought in the  cause itself through the action and combination of the elements  of diversity in it. Thus when the different objects of nature have  been spoken of in one place as the product of the combination  of the three elements fire, water and earth, the effect signifies a real  change produced by their compounding. This is in germ (as we  shall see hereafter) the Pari@nama theory of causation advocated  by the Sa@mkhya school [Footnote ref 1].      Doctrine of Transmigration.    When the Vedic people witnessed the burning of a dead body  they supposed that the eye of the man went to the sun, his breath  to the wind, his speech to the fire, his limbs to the different parts  of the universe. They also believed as we have already seen in  the recompense of good and bad actions in worlds other than our  own, and though we hear of such things as the passage of the  human soul into trees, etc., the tendency towards transmigration  had but little developed at the time.    In the Upani@sads however we find a clear development in  the direction of transmigration in two distinct stages. In the one  the Vedic idea of a recompense in the other world is combined with    ____________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Cha. VI. 2-4.]    54    the doctrine of transmigration, whereas in the other the doctrine  of transmigration comes to the forefront in supersession of the  idea of a recompense in the other world. Thus it is said that  those who performed charitable deeds or such public works as the  digging of wells, etc., follow after death the way of the fathers  (_pit@ryana_), in which the soul after death enters first into smoke,  then into night, the dark half of the month, etc., and at last reaches  the moon; after a residence there as long as the remnant of his  good deeds remains he descends again through ether, wind, smoke,  mist, cloud, rain, herbage, food and seed, and through the assimilation  of food by man he enters the womb of the mother and is  born again. Here we see that the soul had not only a recompense  in the world of the moon, but was re-born again in this world [Footnote  ref 1].    The other way is the way of gods (_devayana_), meant for those  who cultivate faith and asceticism (_tapas_). These souls at death  enter successively into flame, day, bright half of the month, bright  half of the year, sun, moon, lightning, and then finally into  Brahman never to return. Deussen says that \"the meaning of  the whole is that the soul on the way of the gods reaches regions  of ever-increasing light, in which is concentrated all that is bright  and radiant as stations on the way to Brahman the 'light of  lights'\" (_jyoti@sa@m jyoti@h_) [Footnote ref 2].    The other line of thought is a direct reference to the doctrine  of transmigration unmixed with the idea of reaping the fruits of  his deeds (_karma_) by passing through the other worlds and without  reference to the doctrine of the ways of the fathers and gods,  the _Yanas_. Thus Yajnavalkya says, \"when the soul becomes  weak (apparent weakness owing to the weakness of the body with  which it is associated) and falls into a swoon as it were, these senses  go towards it. It (Soul) takes these light particles within itself and  centres itself only in the heart. Thus when the person in the eye  turns back, then the soul cannot know colour; (the senses) become  one (with him); (people about him) say he does not see; (the senses)  become one (with him), he does not smell, (the senses) become  one (with him), he does not taste, (the senses) become one (with  him), he does not speak, (the senses) become one (with him), he  does not hear, (the senses) become one (with him), he does not  think, (the senses) become one with him, he does not touch, (the  senses) become one with him, he does not know, they say. The    ___________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Cha. V. 10.]    [Footnote 2: Deussen's _Philosophy of the Upanishads_, p. 335.]    55    tip of his heart shines and by that shining this soul goes out.  When he goes out either through the eye, the head, or by any  other part of the body, the vital function (_pra@na_) follows and all  the senses follow the vital function (_pra@na_) in coming out. He  is then with determinate consciousness and as such he comes  out. Knowledge, the deeds as well as previous experience (_prajna_)  accompany him. Just as a caterpillar going to the end of a blade  of grass, by undertaking a separate movement collects itself, so  this self after destroying this body, removing ignorance, by a  separate movement collects itself. Just as a goldsmith taking a  small bit of gold, gives to it a newer and fairer form, so the soul  after destroying this body and removing ignorance fashions a  newer and fairer form as of the Pit@rs, the Gandharvas, the gods,  of Prajapati or Brahma or of any other being....As he acts and  behaves so he becomes, good by good deeds, bad by bad deeds,  virtuous by virtuous deeds and vicious by vice. The man is full  of desires. As he desires so he wills, as he wills so he works, as  the work is done so it happens. There is also a verse, being  attached to that he wants to gain by karma that to which he  was attached. Having reaped the full fruit (lit. gone to the  end) of the karma that he does here, he returns back to this  world for doing karma [Footnote ref 1]. So it is the case with those who  have desires. He who has no desires, who had no desires, who has  freed himself from all desires, is satisfied in his desires and in  himself, his senses do not go out. He being Brahma attains  Brahmahood. Thus the verse says, when all the desires that are  in his heart are got rid of, the mortal becomes immortal and  attains Brahma here\" (B@rh. IV. iv. 1-7).    A close consideration of the above passage shows that the  self itself destroyed the body and built up a newer and fairer  frame by its own activity when it reached the end of the present  life. At the time of death, the self collected within itself all  senses and faculties and after death all its previous knowledge,  work and experience accompanied him. The falling off of the  body at the time of death is only for the building of a newer  body either in this world or in the other worlds.

I have been induced to sell my  birthright--I prefer to remain in prison--I love my townspeople--I  will not be free on these conditions! Give me back my bond!\"    \"Never!\" said the man, putting himself into an attitude of defense.    And he did wisely, for there was desperation in Dumiger's eye. He  waited a moment, and then with a maniac's strength he flew at the man,  but he found a powerful and vigorous antagonist. The stranger, who had  appeared half decrepit and aged, rose up in all the strength of youth.  In a moment he had grasped Dumiger's arms, very coolly taken out a  handkerchief, and in spite of all Dumiger's efforts bound his hands  together. After he had performed this operation he drew the document  again from his pocket, so as to be well assured that it was correctly  signed, and smiled as he said to Dumiger--    \"You know that signature?\"    \"Scoundrel! miscreant!\" were the only words to which Dumiger could  give utterance.    \"And now, fellow-citizen,\" said the man, \"I bid you farewell. Keep  your temper; these sober arts should have taught you this kind of  self-command. You will soon be free. As for your arms, I dare not  untie them now, but I will send the guard to you. Now, holloa, guard  without there!\" and he left the cell.    What did all this mean? A mystery seemed to be encircling Dumiger  which he could not penetrate. He knew there was danger near him, but  was unable to define its extent. Only one thing was now certain--he  had sold that clock on which years of toil had been bestowed, and not  in vain. He had but a few days since contemplated certain success, now  how far it was from him! And Hamburgh--to be great and ennobled there,  what did that signify to him? How long would it not take for him,  the inhabitant of the great rival city, to be admitted into this new  society? No, he had made an error which could never be recalled;  he had broken the ties which were once so dear to him. Dumiger now  learned the great truth, that it is only the opinion of the few with  whom we are most intimate that we care for. It is nothing to be  great amongst those with whom we have no sympathies, no affections  in common. The kind word from one lip which we love is far more to  be prized than the loudest acclamations of thousands to whom we are  indifferent.    CHAPTER V.    The day at last arrived for the triennial exhibition of the  productions of Dantzic art, on which day the council had agreed that  the prize for the clock was to be adjudged. It was a great _fete_ for  the town. At an early hour of the morning the inhabitants began to  decorate their houses with tapestry, and to hang garlands over the  door-posts. All classes prepared their dresses of brightest colors,  and their gayest, happiest smiles. And none was happier than  Marguerite, for Dumiger had written to tell her that on the next day  he was certain to be free; but he had not ventured to inform her that  the clock was sold to Hamburgh. Still, although the deed of sale was  irrevocable, his feelings would not permit him to believe that the  excellence of his work would remain unknown to his towns-people; he  felt convinced that the strangers vanity would induce him to make  use of the secret confided to him, so he wrote to Marguerite that  all would go right. Carl and Krantz arrived early in the morning to  accompany her to the great hall. She had within her a secret which she  would not have disclosed to the universe,--the secret of her husband's  success, of his fame and future happiness. So far Dumiger had informed  her that there was an intrigue against him, in which the Grand Master  was the principal: he explained to her that the object the Grand  Master had in view was to obtain the prize and its accompanying honors  for his own son. Carl and Krantz undertook to protect her through  the crowd, and it was with an abundant feeling of confidence that she  dressed for the ceremonial.    She wore her hair braided round her head; a bodice, which showed the  beauty and shape of her form, of scarlet cloth, attached by threads  of gold across the shirt, which was of the softest and most delicate  material; the short blue petticoat, which reached some way below the  knee, but did not descend so far as to conceal the ankle, the symmetry  of which was well-defined by the silk stocking. The shoe might have  stirred the envy of any _grisette_ in Paris--a class which was, even  in those days, supposed to enjoy a monopoly of taste and refinement.  There was a modesty combined with refinement and strength of character  in the appearance of Marguerite which would have distinguished her in  any crowd. She was a being for love and sunshine; but one who, at  the same time, would have dared much for him she loved. The kind and  generous are ever gallant, and rarely are the beautiful unworthy.    Carl and Krantz were also dressed out in their gayest costumes. It  would have been hard to have decided which was the predominant color  in the dresses of these two worthy citizens; they would have rivaled  any tulip bed in a Dutch garden, and perfectly dazzled Marguerite when  they entered the room.    At length the last touch was given to the toilette, and they sallied  forth. Already the streets were so crowded that it was difficult to  move through them; but Carl and Krantz were determined, energetic  fellows, and what with their elbows and Marguerite's bright smiles,  after incurring a few risks of some jokes on Carl's extravagant  appearance, they reached the great hall.    The street in front of the Courthouse was lined with the burgher  guard, stationed there to keep back the crowd; but Marguerite had  an order for admittance at a private entrance, so, escorted by her  cavalier, she ascended the staircase.    When she entered the hall she was struck with awe and astonishment.  The whole of that enormous space, with the exception of the portion  railed off for the competitors and the dais where the council were  sitting, was crowded by a dense mass of people: along the sides of the  vast edifice, and up to the very roof, were arranged all the various  productions of national art. Nothing can be pictured more beautiful  than the combination of rich and varied colors, or more curious than  the forms which art and genius had given them: here were dyes which  might have rivaled those of Tyre, and fabrics of finer texture than a  Penelope could have woven. At one end, toward which Marguerite's eyes  were most anxiously turned, the models of the clocks were arranged.  Dumiger's was placed in the center, for it was at the same time  the largest model, and contained the most elaborate and complicated  machinery; but, alas! the works remained still, while all the others  were in motion, and showed in the smallest space the movements of the  heavenly bodies, and the progress of time. If Dumiger's meant anything  more than a confused mass of machinery, it could not for a moment be  doubted that it was the work of highest genius exhibited, but in its  quiescent state it contrasted disadvantageously with the admirable  systems revolving round it. Marguerite held her breath while she  gazed; neither did she perceive how much attention she herself had  awakened--the moment for vanity had passed, her present interests lay  far deeper. Immediately above her the Grand Council, with the Grand  Master, were sitting, dressed in their robes of state. The Count  Albrecht wore his cordon of the Fleece, and looked every inch a grand  master; the anxiety for his son's success was apparent in the nervous  glances which he cast around him. Behind, and amid the retainers,  stood the dark, designing-looking stranger, who held in his hand the  fate of Dumiger.    The heralds proclaimed silence, and then the Grand Master rose to read  the decision of the council. It commenced with reciting the list of  the competitors, and when it mentioned Dumiger's name, it said, \"the  work is imperfect, and therefore must be withdrawn.\"    \"It is not imperfect,\" cried two stentorian voices from the farther  end of the hall.    The voices proceeded from Carl and Krantz, whose excitement could no  longer be retained.    \"No! it is not imperfect,\" said the gentler voice of Marguerite.    All eyes were turned toward the spot whence that voice proceeded.  Marguerite nearly fainted to find herself the object of so much  attention.    \"Keep your courage,\" whispered Carl. \"Tell them that Dumiger will soon  be free, and the works put in motion. I will tell them for you,\" he  exclaimed, and he began to speak, when the mysterious stranger stepped  forth.    \"Stay,\" he said, \"let me touch the works of this clock--the secret is  mine.\"    He forced his way through the crowd, looked carefully over the  machinery, opened a secret spring, arranged two small wheels, on which  the accurate movement of the whole machinery depended, and immediately  it was all in motion.    The proceeding was watched with intense interest by all. The  stranger's eye gleamed with delight, for he was anxious, with the true  spirit of Hamburg jealousy, that the people of Dantzic should feel the  value of what they were about to lose.    It was indeed a marvelous piece of workmanship: the planets all  revolved in their regular order, figures of exquisite workmanship  appeared and disappeared to mark the seconds, and the dial plate  was of elaborate beauty. The people for some time stood entranced in  wonder. At last they exclaimed, as with one voice--    \"It is a work worthy of Dantzic--and Dumiger has won! Dumiger  forever'.\"    If Marguerite had nearly fainted from fear, she was now pale with  delight.    \"Dumiger, Dumiger forever!\" again shouted the crowd; \"where is the  laurel? where is the triumph? Greatest amongst his citizens, Dumiger  has won!\"    But at that moment the stranger came forward with a paper in his hand.  The Count's face, which had been overspread with anger and"]]]
