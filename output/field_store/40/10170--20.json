Like all other spring and summer vegetables, they must be young and  freshly gathered: boil them till tender, drain them, add a little  butter, and serve them up. These beans are easily preserved for winter  use, and will be nearly as good as fresh ones. Gather them on a dry day,  when full grown, but quite young: have a clean and dry keg, sprinkle  some salt in the bottom, put in a layer of pods, containing the beans,  then a little salt--do this till the keg is full; lay a board on with a  weight, to press them down; cover the keg very close, and keep it in a  dry, cool place--they should be put up as late in the season, as they  can be with convenience. When used, the pods must be washed, and laid in  fresh water all night; shell them next day, and keep them in water till  you are going to boil them; when tender, serve them up with melted  butter in a boat. French beans (snaps) may be preserved in the same  manner.           *       *       *       *       *    TURNIP ROOTED CABBAGE.    The cabbage growing at the top is not good; cut the root in slices an  inch thick, peel off the rind, and boil the slices in a large quantity  of water, till tender, serve it up hot, with melted butter poured over  it.           *       *       *       *       *    EGG PLANT.    The purple ones are best; get them young and fresh; pull out the stem,  and parboil them to take off the bitter taste; cut them in slices an  inch thick, but do not peel them; dip them in the yelk of an egg, and  cover them with grated bread, a little salt and pepper--when this has  dried, cover the other side the same way--fry them a nice brown. They  are very delicious, tasting much like soft crabs. The egg plant may be  dressed in another manner: scrape the rind and parboil them; cut a slit  from one end to the other, take out the seeds, fill the space with a  rich forcemeat, and stew them in well seasoned gravy, or bake them, and  serve up with gravy in the dish.           *       *       *       *       *    POTATO PUMPKIN.    Get one of a good colour, and seven or eight inches in diameter; cut a  piece off the top, take out all the seeds, wash and wipe the cavity,  pare the rind off, and fill the hollow with good forcemeat--put the top  on, and set it in a deep pan, to protect the sides; bake it in a  moderate oven, put it carefully in the dish without breaking, and it  will look like a handsome mould. Another way of cooking potato pumpkin  is to cut it in slices, pare off the rind, and make a puree as directed  for turnips.           *       *       *       *       *    SWEET POTATO.    Take those that are nearly of the same size, that they may be done  equally--wash them clean, but do not peel them--boil them till tender,  drain the water off, and put them on tin sheets in a stove for a few  minutes to dry.           *       *       *       *       *    SWEET POTATOS STEWED.    Wash and wipe them, and if they be large, cut them in two lengths; put  them at the bottom of a stew pan, lay over some slices of boiled ham;  and on that, one or two chickens cut up with pepper, salt, and a bundle  of herbs; pour in some water, and stew them till done, then take out the  herbs, serve the stew in a deep dish--thicken the gravy, and pour over  it.           *       *       *       *       *    SWEET POTATOS BROILED.    Cut them across without peeling, in slices half an inch thick, broil  them on a griddle, and serve them with butter in a boat.           *       *       *       *       *    SPINACH.    Great care must be used in washing and picking it clean; drain it, and  throw it into boiling water--a few minutes will boil it sufficiently:  press out all the water, put it in a stew pan with a piece of butter,  some pepper and salt--chop it continually with a spoon till it is quite  dry: serve it with poached eggs or without, as you please.           *       *       *       *       *    SORREL.    Is dressed as the spinach; and if they be mixed in equal proportions,  improve each other.           *       *       *       *       *    CABBAGE PUDDING.    Get a fine head of cabbage, not too large; pour boiling water on, and  cover it till you can turn the leaves back, which you must do carefully;  take some of those in the middle of the head off, chop them fine, and  mix them with rich forcemeat; put this in, and replace the leaves to  confine the stuffing--tie it in a cloth, and boil it--serve it up whole,  with a little melted butter in the dish.           *       *       *       *       *    SQUASH OR CIMLIN.    Gather young squashes, peel, and cut them in two; take out the seeds,  and boil them till tender; put them into a colander, drain off the  water, and rub them with a wooden spoon through the colander; then put  them into a stew pan, with a cup full of cream, a small piece of butter,  some pepper and salt--stew them, stirring frequently until dry. This is  the most delicate way of preparing squashes.           *       *       *       *       *    WINTER SQUASH.    The crooked neck of this squash is the best part. Cut it in slices an  inch thick, take off the rind, and boil them with salt in the water;  drain them well before they are dished, and pour melted butter  over--serve them up very hot.    The large part, containing the seeds, must be sliced and pared--cut it  in small pieces, and stew it till soft, with just water enough to cover  it; pass it through a sieve and stew it again, adding some butter,  pepper, and salt; it must be dry, but not burnt. It is excellent when  stewed with pork chops.           *       *       *       *       *    FIELD PEAS.    There are many varieties of these peas; the smaller kind are the most  delicate. Have them young and newly gathered, shell and boil them  tender; pour them in a colander to drain; put some lard in a frying pan;  when it boils, mash the peas, and fry them in a cake of a light brown;  put it in the dish with the crust uppermost--garnish with thin bits of  fried bacon. They are very nice when fried whole, so that each pea is  distinct from the other; but they must be boiled less, and fried with  great care. Plain boiling is a very common way of dressing them.           *       *       *       *       *    CABBAGE WITH ONIONS.    Boil them separately, and mix them in the proportions you like; add  butter, pepper, and salt, and either stew them, or fry them in a cake.           *       *       *       *       *    SALSIFY.    Scrape and wash the roots, put them into boiling water with salt; when  done, drain them, and place them in the dish without cutting them up.  They are a very excellent vegetable, but require nicety in cooking;  exposure to the air, either in scraping, or after boiling, will make  them black.           *       *       *       *       *    STEWED SALSIFY.    Half boil it, cut it up, and put it in a stew pan, with a very little  water, and a spoonful of butter; stew them dry, and serve them up. For  change, you may, after stewing, cut them in scollop shells with grated  bread, and bake them; or make them into cakes, and fry them. They are  delicious in whatever way they can be dressed.           *       *       *       *       *    STEWED MUSHROOMS.    Gather grown mushrooms, but such as are young enough to have red gills;  cut off that part of the stem which grew in the earth--wash them  carefully, and take the skin from the top; put them into a stew pan with  some salt, but no water--stew them till tender, and thicken them with a  spoonful of butter, mixed with one of brown flour; red wine may be  added, but the flavour of the mushroom is too delicious to require aid  from any thing.           *       *       *       *       *    BROILED MUSHROOMS.    Prepare them as above directed--broil them on a griddle, and when done,  sprinkle pepper and salt on the gills, and put a little butter on them.           *       *       *       *       *    TO BOIL RICE.    Put two cups full of rice in a bowl of water, rub it well with the hand,  and pour off the water; do this until the water ceases to be  discoloured; then put the rice into two and a half cups of cold water;  add a tea-spoonful of salt, cover the pot close, and set it on a brisk  fire; let it boil ten minutes, pour off the greater part of the water,  and remove the pot to a bed of coals, where it must remain a quarter of  an hour to soak and dry.           *       *       *       *       *    RICE JOURNEY, OR JOHNNY CAKE.    Boil a pint of rice quite soft, with a tea-spoonful of salt; mix with it  while hot a large spoonful of butter, and spread it on a dish to cool;  when perfectly cold, add a pint of rice flour and half a pint of  milk--beat them all together till well mingled. Take the middle part of  the head of a barrel, make it quite clean, wet it, and put on the  mixture about an inch thick, smooth with a spoon, and baste it with a  little milk; set the board aslant before clear coals; when sufficiently  baked, slip a thread under the cake and turn it: baste and bake that  side in a similar manner, split it, and butter while hot. Small homony  boiled and mixed with rice flour, is better than all rice; and if baked  very thin, and afterwards toasted and buttered, it is nearly as good as  cassada bread.           *       *       *       *       *      PUDDINGS, &c.      OBSERVATIONS ON PUDDINGS AND CAKES.    The salt should always be washed from butter, when it is to be used in  any thing that has sugar for an ingredient, and also from that which is  melted to grease any kind of mould for baking--otherwise, there will be  a disagreeable salt taste on the outer side of the article baked.  Raisins should be stoned and cut in two, and have some flour sifted over  them--stir them gently in the flour, and take them out free from lumps;  the small quantity that adheres to them, will prevent their sticking  together, or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12539"],[0,"Observations Upon the Windward Coast of Africa (#17)"],[1,"land and sea, which, with a well chosen position,  central from Cape Sierra Leone, to Cape Palmas, would combine a regular  system of operation, concentrating in the river Sierra Leone. In addition  to these three principal depots, it would be requisite to establish  factories, and places of defence to the northward, on the rivers Scarcies  and Kissey, at the Isles de Loss, the rivers Dembia, Rio Pongo, Rio Grande,  Rio Noonez, and Gambia; and to leeward, on the rivers Sherbro, Galhinas,  Cape Mount, Junk river, John's river, Bassau, &c. or in other commanding  positions towards Cape Palmas. The expense of these auxiliary  establishments and forts would be inconsiderable, compared with the objects  they would attain, the chief requisite being regular and well supplied  assortments of goods, and a wise system of organization adapted to  circumstances.    The navigation of these rivers, and habits of conciliation and friendship  with the chiefs resident upon them, and towards the interior, it may here  be perceived, are the only practicable measures, under the auspicious  control of Government, to retain our commerce with Africa, to civilize its  inhabitants, and explore its hidden wealth; and are the most favourable,  also, towards our operations in the countries on this continent; while the  various natives attached to this pursuit, would aid, by wise management, in  influencing the inhabitants, where our researches and pursuits might carry  us, and eventually conduct us to the centre of Africa, from thence to the  eastern shores of the Mediterranean, and the banks of the Nile. I trust it  will here also appear that the means of acting, and the important  advantages to be derived therefrom, are neither illusive nor impracticable.    It is to be lamented, that, in undertakings of this kind, men of limited  genius, of no experience in business, and incapable of acting with  unanimity, have been too frequently employed; who are governed more by  caprice than principle, and are consequently seldom able to reduce their  ideas into practice, and allow their passions to predominate over the  maxims of duty. Delicacy in managing the humours and interests of men is  the art requisite to successful operation.    May it be remembered, that if civilization and our ascendency prevail in  Africa, and if the first essays we make to extend our relations with that  country are successful, we attach to the civilized world one-fourth of the  habitable globe, and its infinite resources. It therefore becomes a subject  of great magnitude, to commence and form a system of operation, to collect  the means of this immense extent, and the propriety of subjecting the whole  to a similarity of views, and co-operation under one controlling  administration.    The precipitate abolition of the slave trade will reduce our affairs in  Africa, to a contracted and unproductive compass, in its present condition;  therefore if we attach any consequence to this quarter of the globe, it  will be expedient to endeavour to discover new scources [**Note: sources]  of commercial wealth and industry.    Coffee, cotton, the sugar cane, cacao, indigo, rice, tobacco, aromatic  plants and trees, &c. first offer themselves to, our attention in wild  exuberance. And these, in my humble opinion, are the only rational means to  bring Africa into a state of civilization, and to abolish slavery.    I recommend one administration under the patronage of Government, in the  Sierra Leone river, to guard against a want of unity in the number of petty  establishments that may otherwise exist on the coast, which from jealousies  and interests varying in different directions, produce operations of a  contradictory nature, and the first necessary step, is to be well  acquainted with the character and dispositions, of the natives, and the  localities of the maritime situations; for without combined enterprises, I  venture to predict we are now excluded from the commerce of Africa.    I trust that my system will be examined in all its points, with  dispassionate impartiality before it is rejected; and if others more  competent to the task, devise more eligible means to promote the views of  humanity and commerce, I shall feel happy to have agitated the subject, and  rejoice at every means, to rescue so important a matter to the interests of  mankind.    The commandant of Goree, I would propose as second in command, with  delegated powers to control all the operations in the countries bordering  on the Senegal, and the river Gambia; and an annual inspection directed by  him, throughout this district. The intermediate countries from the Rio  Noonez to Cape Mount would come immediately under the examination of the  central and administrative government of Sierra Leone, and the third  division under the authority of another command at a position chosen  between Cape Mount, and Cape Palmas.    The military protection of the establishments, as I have here recommended,  would neither require great exertions, or numbers. Goree certainly claims  peculiar attention. Its fortifications should be repaired, and the guns  rendered more complete, and tanks for water should be in a perfect state to  guard against the want of this necessary article from the main land, which,  as before noticed, is liable to be cut off at any period by the enemy. The  convenience, airy and healthy construction of the barracks and hospitals,  claim the most minute attention and care. Under skilful superintendance in  these important departments, the health of the troops might be preserved,  and objects of defence realized with a very inconsiderable military  establishment. But as government must be well informed by its officers,  both military and naval in these points, it would be indecorous in me to  enlarge on the subject. Lieut. Colonel Lloyd, from his long residence, and  intimacy with a great portion of the Windward Coast, possesses ample  information. And the naval officers, who from time to time have visited it,  have, no doubt, furnished every document necessary to complete an effective  naval protection. A regular system of defence, adapted to the jurisdiction  of the Sierra Leone, and delegated establishment between Cape Mount and  Cape Palmas, are also obviously requisite. The establishments that would be  eligible for the purposes of defence, are confined to the three foregoing  principal positions, and they have little to perform that is either  difficult or embarrassing. It may not, however, be considered as going  beyond the bounds of propriety to hint, that a great portion of the  soldiers charged with defence, should be able engineers and gunners, and a  few cavalry might be occasionally found useful. To complete the entire  plan, and exclude our enemies from every point, from Cape Blanco to Cape  Palmas, the possession of the French establishment at the Isle of Louis in  the Senegal, is an abject of serious contemplation, and no doubt might be  attained with great facility by even a small force. The unhealthy  consequences to a military force attached to this place might be greatly  removed by superior convenience in the hospitals, barracks, and other  departments of residence; and in a commercial point of view, its advantages  are too well ascertained for me to obtrude any observations.    The bricks necessary for building may be procured in the country, lime from  oyster shells, &c. wood and other materials at a very inconsiderable  expense; and as the usual mode of payment, is in bars of goods, instead of  money, the nominal amount would thereby be greatly lessened.        CHAPTER IX.          _The Author embarks in the Ship Minerva.--Proceeds to the Rio  Pongo.--Disquisitions thereon.--Further Observations on the Inhabitants,  obtained from Natives of various Nations met with there.--The Isles de  Loss--Returns to Sierra Leone, &c._      Upon the 4th of June, 1806, I embarked at Bance Island, on board the ship  Minerva of Liverpool, bound upon a trading voyage to the Rio Pongo, and  other rivers to the northward, and on Thursday the 12th came to an anchor  at the upper forks, in the Rio Pongo, being the point at which the branches  of the _Bungra, Charleston, Constintia,_ &c. empty themselves; higher up  the river are the _Sanga_ and _Bashia_ branches, occupied by a chain of  factories, and inhabited by various nations and tribes. The principal  factories for trade are on the Constintia, about 40 miles up the river, Mr.  Cummings's factory, at Ventura; Mr. John Irvin's, at Kessey; Mr. Benjamin  Curtis's, at Boston; Mr. Frasier's, at Bangra; Mr. Sammo's, at Charleston;  Mr. David Lawrence's, at Gambia; Mr. Daniel Botefeur's, at Mary Hill; Mr.  Ormond's, Mr. Tillinghurst's, Mr. Gray's, in the Bashia branch; with  various others of inferior consideration.    During my stay on this river, I visited the whole of these branches, and in  addition to personal investigation, I obtained much information from the  various conductors of these factories, and had a variety of opportunities  of communicating with many of the natives from the interior countries, who  are drawn hither by the extensive commerce of the Rio Pongo. In my  excursions on this river, I was generally accompanied by Captain William  Browne, of Liverpool, who was part owner of the Minerva, and had the sole  management of the concerns of her voyage; and I am happy to give him this  public testimony of the many obligations he conferred upon me, while on  this part of the coast, which unceasingly continued until my arrival in  England, by the way of the West Indies.    The countries bounded by the Rio Pongo and the Gambia, are inhabited by the  Nilloes and various tribes, who carry on a considerable trade with that  river, the Rio Noonez, and Rio Grande, and inland to the two latter, is the  powerful nation of the Foolahs, possessing an extensive country, about 200  miles in breadth from north to south, and 400 miles from east "]]]
