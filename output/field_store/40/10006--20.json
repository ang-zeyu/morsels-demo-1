Let us hear Flinders in  reply. \"M. Peron should not have said that the south coast from  Westernport to Nuyts Land was then unknown, but that it was unknown to  them, for Captain Grant, of the Lady Nelson, had discovered the eastern  part from Westernport to the longitude 140 degrees 14 minutes in the year  1800, before the French ships sailed from Europe, and on the west I had  explored the coast and islands from Nuyts Land to Cape Jervis in 138  degrees 10 minutes.\" In other words, Grant's eye-chart connected up the  coast between the extremity of George Bass's exploration, Westernport,  and Cape Banks to the east, while Flinders had traversed the coast  between Nuyts Land and Encounter Bay to the west, leaving a gap of only  about fifty leagues of sandy shore, upon which there is \"neither river,  inlet, or place of shelter,\" that was actually discovered by Baudin.  Flinders not only admitted that the French had discovered this  particularly barren and uninteresting stretch of land, but marked it upon  his charts* (* Cf. plate 4 in Flinders' Atlas, for example.) as  \"discovered by Captain Baudin, 1802.\" The French on their charts,  however, made not the slightest reference to the discoveries of either  Flinders or Grant.    The true Terre Napoleon, therefore, if the name were to survive at all,  would be from a point north-west of Cape Banks in the state of South  Australia, to the mouth of the river Murray in Encounter Bay. The names  marked on a modern map indicate the sort of country that it is in the  main. Chinaman's Wells, M'Grath's Flat, Salt Creek, Martin's Washpool,  Jim Crow's Flat, and Tilley's Swamp are examples. They are not  noble-sounding designations to inscribe at the back of coasts once  dignified by the name of the greatest figure in modern history. It is  rather to be regretted that the name Terre Napoleon has slipped off  modern maps. It is historically interesting. When Eric the Red, as the  Saga tells us, discovered Greenland, he so called it because \"men would  be the more readily persuaded thither if the land had a good name.\" Most  will agree that Terre Napoleon sounds a bit better than Pipe Clay Plain  or Willow Swamp, which are other choice flowers in the same garden.* (*  These \"virginal chaste names\" are taken from the map of South Australia,  by the Surveyor-General of that State, 1892.)    There is no evidence to warrant the belief that Napoleon had anything  whatever to do with affixing his name to the territory to which it was  applied, or with the nomenclature of the features of the coast. Nor would  there be anything remarkable in the use of the name Terre Napoleon, if  the French had really discovered the region so described. In every part  of the world there are lands named after the rulers of the nations to  which the discoverers or founders belonged. Raleigh named Virginia \"from  the maiden Queen\"; the two Carolinas preserve the name of the amorous  monarch who granted the original charter of colonisation \"out of a Pious  and good intention for ye propogacion of ye Christian faith amongst ye  Barbarous and Ignorant Indians, ye Inlargement of his Empire and  Dominions, and Inriching of his Subjects\"; and two states of Australia  commemorate by their names the great Queen who occupied the British  throne when they were founded. There would have been nothing unusual or  improper in the action of the French in styling the country from Wilson's  Promontory to Cape Adieu \"Terre Napoleon,\" except that they did not  discover it. What they did excites a feeling akin to derision, because it  bore the character of \"jumping a claim,\" to use an Australian mining  phrase.    Nor is it to be inferred that affixing the name was intended to assert  possession. An examination of the large chart of Australia shows that the  whole of the coast-line, except this particular stretch, was previously  named. There was Terre de Nuyts on the south-west; Terre de Leeuwin,  Terre d'Endrels, Terre d'Endracht were on the west; Terre de Witt on the  north-west; Terre d'Arnheim and Terre de Carpentarie on the north. New  South Wales was marked as occupying the whole of the east. The styling of  the freshly discovered south Terre Napoleon was a mere piece of  courtiership. If Napoleon had ever been strong enough to strike a blow at  the British in Australia, the probabilities are that he would have  endeavoured to oust them from New South Wales, and would not have  troubled himself very much about the coasts that were named after him. It  was his way to strike at the heart of his enemy, and the heart of British  settlement in Australia was located at Port Jackson.    It has been represented in one of the best books in English on the  Napoleonic period,* (* Dr. Holland Rose's Life of Napoleon 1 381.) that  \"the names given by Flinders on the coasts of Western and South  Australia, have been retained owing to the priority of his investigation,  but the French names have been kept up on the coast between the mouth of  the Murray and Bass Straits for the same reason.\" That statement,  however, is very much too wide. Capes Patton, Otway, Nelson, Bridgewater,  Northumberland and Banks, Portland Bay and Julia Percy Island, all lie  between the points mentioned, and all of them were named by Grant, who  first discovered them and marked them on his chart. None of the French  names is properly in present employment east of Cape Buffon; for their  Cap Boufflers, which is marked on a few maps, is really the Cape Banks of  Grant. The only names freshly applied by Baudin to natural features of  the mainland on the Terre Napoleon charts, and which are in current use,  are Cape Buffon, Cape Lannes, Rivoli Bay, Cape Jaffa, Cape Rabelais, Cape  Dombey, Guichen Bay, Cape Bernoulli, Lacepede Bay, and Cape Morard de  Galles. Some or other of these names may be found, in some order, on some  modern map, but the sequence is variable, and they are not all to be  found on any single map with which the author is acquainted; because  there are more names than there are natural capes and bays to which they  can apply. The remainder of the French names between Lacepede Bay and  Cape Jervis, and most of those in the more easterly section, are not  marked on any current map, because in some instances they do not  represent features of the coast which are sufficiently pronounced to  require names, whilst in other cases they are applied to islands, capes,  and bays that do not exist.* (* The difficulty of identifying the  features marked on the Terre Napoleon charts is made clear by comparing  them with a few good modern maps. Thus, taking them from south-east to  north-west, they appear on the French charts in the following order: 1,  Cap Buffon; 2, Cap Lannes; 3, Baie de Rivoli; 4, Cap de Jaffa; 5, Cap  Rabelais; 6, Cap Dombey; 7, Baie de Guichen; 8, Cap Bernoulli; 9, Baie  Lacepede; 10, Cap Morard de Galles; 11, Cap Fermat; 12, Cap Monge 13, Cap  Caffarelli; 14, Cap Villars; 15, Baie Mollien; 16, Cap Mollien 17, Baie  Cretet; 18, Cap Cretet; 19, Iles Decaen; 20, Cap Decaen; 21, Cap  Montelivet. On the large Continental map constructed by the Department of  Lands and Survey, State of Victoria, 1879, the order of the names  included is as follows: 1, Buffon; 2, Rivoli; 3, Lannes; 4, Guichen; 5,  Jaffa; 6, Lacepede. Rabelais, Dombey, Bernoulli, and the rest are  omitted, the draftsman evidently being unable to find features to which  to apply them. On the large map compiled in the office of the  Surveyor-General, State of South Australia, 1892, the order of the names  is: 1, Buffon; 2, Rivoli; 3, Rabelais; 4, Lannes; 5, Dombey; 6, Guichen;  7, Jaffa; 8, Lacepede. On the excellent map in M'Lean's New Atlas of  Australia, 1886, we find: 1, Buffon; 2, Rivoli; 3, Lannes; 4, Guichen; 5,  Jaffa; 6, Lacepede. Flinders, on his separate chart of this part of the  coast, found features for the names of Buffon, Lannes, Rivoli, and  Bernoulli, but left out Rabelais, Dombey, Guichen, and Lacepede. In no  case is the cape or bay on the Terre Napoleon chart of this part of the  coast a tolerably good representation of an actuality.) Where are Cap  Monge, Cap Caffarelli, Cap Mollien, Cap du Mont St. Bernard, Ile  Latrelle, or Baie Descartes? They are not to be found. Freycinet* (*  Preface to the 1824 edition of the Voyage de Decouvertes page 13, note.)  complained that Flinders, on his charts, had erroneously applied the  French names between Cap Monge and Cap Lannes. It was a singular  complaint to make, seeing that Flinders gave the French full credit for  their discoveries, whilst they omitted all reference to his work on their  charts. But Flinders' difficulty was that of all later map-makers: he  could not find all the places to which Baudin had given names. He did his  best; but it is evidently easier to sprinkle a coast-line with the  contents of a biographical dictionary, than to fit all the names in.    The French cartography of the portions of the coast eastward of the two  gulfs was so badly done, in fact, that many of the features indicated on  the charts are mere geographical Mrs. Harrises--there \"ain't no sich\"  places. The coast was not surveyed at all, but was sketched roughly,  inaccurately, and out of scale; so that even the sandy stretch now known  as the Coorong, which is about as featureless as a railway embankment,  was fitted with names and drawn with corrugations as though it were as  jagged as a gigantic saw. Our respect for such names as Montesquieu and  Descartes causes us to regret that they should have been wasted on a cape  and a bay that geography knows not; and our abiding interest in the  sinister genius of Talleyrand fosters the wish that his patronymic had  been reserved for some other feature than the curve of the coast which  holds \"the Rip\" of Port Phillip, though in one sense he who was so wont  to \"fish"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7452"],[0,"Autobiography of a Yogi (#16)"],[1,"VAISESIKA expounders was Aulukya, also called Kanada, \"the  atom-eater,\" born about 2800 years ago.    In an article in EAST-WEST, April, 1934, a summary of VAISESIKA  scientific knowledge was given as follows: \"Though the modern  'atomic theory' is generally considered a new advance of science,  it was brilliantly expounded long ago by Kanada, 'the atom-eater.'  The Sanskrit ANUS can be properly translated as 'atom' in the latter's  literal Greek sense of 'uncut' or indivisible. Other scientific  expositions of VAISESIKA treatises of the B.C. era include (1) the  movement of needles toward magnets, (2) the circulation of water  in plants, (3) AKASH or ether, inert and structureless, as a basis  for transmitting subtle forces, (4) the solar fire as the cause of  all other forms of heat, (5) heat as the cause of molecular change,  (6) the law of gravitation as caused by the quality that inheres in  earth-atoms to give them their attractive power or downward pull,  (7) the kinetic nature of all energy; causation as always rooted  in an expenditure of energy or a redistribution of motion, (8)  universal dissolution through the disintegration of atoms, (9)  the radiation of heat and light rays, infinitely small particles,  darting forth in all directions with inconceivable speed (the modern  'cosmic rays' theory), (10) the relativity of time and space.    \"VAISESIKA assigned the origin of the world to atoms, eternal in  their nature, i.e., their ultimate peculiarities. These atoms were  regarded as possessing an incessant vibratory motion. . . . The  recent discovery that an atom is a miniature solar system would be  no news to the old VAISESIKA philosophers, who also reduced time to  its furthest mathematical concept by describing the smallest unit  of time (KALA) as the period taken by an atom to traverse its own  unit of space.\"    {FN8-6} Translated from the Bengali of Rabindranath Tagore, by  Manmohan Ghosh, in VISWA-BHARATI.        CHAPTER: 9    THE BLISSFUL DEVOTEE AND HIS COSMIC ROMANCE    \"Little sir, please be seated. I am talking to my Divine Mother.\"    Silently I had entered the room in great awe. The angelic  appearance of Master Mahasaya fairly dazzled me. With silky white  beard and large lustrous eyes, he seemed an incarnation of purity.  His upraised chin and folded hands apprized me that my first visit  had disturbed him in the midst of his devotions.    His simple words of greeting produced the most violent effect my  nature had so far experienced. The bitter separation of my mother's  death I had thought the measure of all anguish. Now an agony at  separation from my Divine Mother was an indescribable torture of  the spirit. I fell moaning to the floor.    \"Little sir, quiet yourself!\" The saint was sympathetically  distressed.    Abandoned in some oceanic desolation, I clutched his feet as the  sole raft of my rescue.    \"Holy sir, thy intercession! Ask Divine Mother if I find any favor  in Her sight!\"    This promise is one not easily bestowed; the master was constrained  to silence.    Beyond reach of doubt, I was convinced that Master Mahasaya was in  intimate converse with the Universal Mother. It was deep humiliation  to realize that my eyes were blind to Her who even at this moment  was perceptible to the faultless gaze of the saint. Shamelessly  gripping his feet, deaf to his gentle remonstrances, I besought  him again and again for his intervening grace.    \"I will make your plea to the Beloved.\" The master's capitulation  came with a slow, compassionate smile.    What power in those few words, that my being should know release  from its stormy exile?    \"Sir, remember your pledge! I shall return soon for Her message!\"  Joyful anticipation rang in my voice that only a moment ago had  been sobbing in sorrow.    Descending the long stairway, I was overwhelmed by memories. This  house at 50 Amherst Street, now the residence of Master Mahasaya,  had once been my family home, scene of my mother's death. Here  my human heart had broken for the vanished mother; and here today  my spirit had been as though crucified by absence of the Divine  Mother. Hallowed walls, silent witness of my grievous hurts and  final healing!    My steps were eager as I returned to my Gurpar Road home. Seeking  the seclusion of my small attic, I remained in meditation until  ten o'clock. The darkness of the warm Indian night was suddenly  lit with a wondrous vision.    Haloed in splendor, the Divine Mother stood before me. Her face,  tenderly smiling, was beauty itself.    \"Always have I loved thee! Ever shall I love thee!\"    The celestial tones still ringing in the air, She disappeared.    The sun on the following morning had hardly risen to an angle of  decorum when I paid my second visit to Master Mahasaya. Climbing  the staircase in the house of poignant memories, I reached his  fourth-floor room. The knob of the closed door was wrapped around  with a cloth; a hint, I felt, that the saint desired privacy. As  I stood irresolutely on the landing, the door was opened by the  master's welcoming hand. I knelt at his holy feet. In a playful  mood, I wore a solemn mask over my face, hiding the divine elation.    \"Sir, I have come-very early, I confess!-for your message. Did the  Beloved Mother say anything about me?\"    \"Mischievous little sir!\"    Not another remark would he make. Apparently my assumed gravity  was unimpressive.    \"Why so mysterious, so evasive? Do saints never speak plainly?\"  Perhaps I was a little provoked.    \"Must you test me?\" His calm eyes were full of understanding. \"Could  I add a single word this morning to the assurance you received last  night at ten o'clock from the Beautiful Mother Herself?\"    Master Mahasaya possessed control over the flood-gates of my soul:  again I plunged prostrate at his feet. But this time my tears welled  from a bliss, and not a pain, past bearing.    \"Think you that your devotion did not touch the Infinite Mercy?  The Motherhood of God, that you have worshiped in forms both human  and divine, could never fail to answer your forsaken cry.\"    Who was this simple saint, whose least request to the Universal Spirit  met with sweet acquiescence? His role in the world was humble, as  befitted the greatest man of humility I ever knew. In this Amherst  Street house, Master Mahasaya {FN9-1} conducted a small high school  for boys. No words of chastisement passed his lips; no rule and  ferule maintained his discipline. Higher mathematics indeed were  taught in these modest classrooms, and a chemistry of love absent  from the textbooks. He spread his wisdom by spiritual contagion  rather than impermeable precept. Consumed by an unsophisticated  passion for the Divine Mother, the saint no more demanded the  outward forms of respect than a child.    \"I am not your guru; he shall come a little later,\" he told me.  \"Through his guidance, your experiences of the Divine in terms of  love and devotion shall be translated into his terms of fathomless  wisdom.\"    Every late afternoon, I betook myself to Amherst Street. I  sought Master Mahasaya's divine cup, so full that its drops daily  overflowed on my being. Never before had I bowed in utter reverence;  now I felt it an immeasurable privilege even to tread the same  ground which Master Mahasaya sanctified.    \"Sir, please wear this champak garland I have fashioned especially  for you.\" I arrived one evening, holding my chain of flowers. But  shyly he drew away, repeatedly refusing the honor. Perceiving my  hurt, he finally smiled consent.    \"Since we are both devotees of the Mother, you may put the garland  on this bodily temple, as offering to Her who dwells within.\" His  vast nature lacked space in which any egotistical consideration  could gain foothold.    [Illustration: Two Brothers of Therese Neumann, I stand with them  in Konnersreuth, Bavaria.--see nbrothers.jpg]    [Illustration: Master Mahasaya, Ever engrossed in his blissful  cosmic romance.--see mmahasaya.jpg]    \"Let us go tomorrow to the Dakshineswar Temple, forever hallowed  by my guru.\" Master Mahasaya was a disciple of a Christlike master,  Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa.    The four-mile journey on the following morning was taken by boat  on the Ganges. We entered the nine-domed Temple of Kali, where the  figures of the Divine Mother and Shiva rest on a burnished silver  lotus, its thousand petals meticulously chiseled. Master Mahasaya  beamed in enchantment. He was engaged in his inexhaustible romance  with the Beloved. As he chanted Her name, my enraptured heart seemed  shattered into a thousand pieces.    We strolled later through the sacred precincts, halting in a  tamarisk grove. The manna characteristically exuded by this tree  was symbolic of the heavenly food Master Mahasaya was bestowing.  His divine invocations continued. I sat rigidly motionless on the  grass amid the pink feathery tamarisk flowers. Temporarily absent  from the body, I soared in a supernal visit.    This was the first of many pilgrimages to Dakshineswar with the holy  teacher. From him I learned the sweetness of God in the aspect of  Mother, or Divine Mercy. The childlike saint found little appeal in  the Father aspect, or Divine Justice. Stern, exacting, mathematical  judgment was alien to his gentle nature.    \"He can serve as an earthly prototype for the very angels of  heaven!\" I thought fondly, watching him one day at his prayers.  Without a breath of censure or criticism, he surveyed the world  with eyes long familiar with the Primal Purity. His body, mind,  speech, and actions were effortlessly harmonized with his soul's  simplicity.    \"My Master told me so.\" Shrinking from personal assertion, the  saint ended any sage counsel with this invariable tribute. So deep  was his identity with Sri Ramakrishna that Master Mahasaya no longer  considered his thoughts as his own.    Hand in hand, the saint and I walked one evening on the block of his  school.
