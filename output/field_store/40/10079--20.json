They should never be allowed to remain in the  water after the skin begins to loosen. For scalding fruits and  vegetables a wire basket or a square of cheesecloth may be used in the  manner shown in Figs. 7 and 8.    Blanching is done to reduce the bulk of such foods as spinach and other  greens, to render them partly sterilized, and to improve their flavor.  It consists in dipping the food into boiling water or suspending it over  live steam and allowing it to remain there for a longer period of time  than is necessary for scalding. To blanch food, place it in a wire  basket, a sieve, or a piece of clean cheesecloth and lower it into  boiling water or suspend it above the water in a closely covered vessel.  Allow it to remain there long enough to accomplish the purpose intended.    [Illustration: FIG. 8]    36. COLD DIPPING.--After the food to be canned is scalded or blanched,  it is ready for cold-dipping. Cold-dipping is done partly to improve the  color of the food. It stops the softening process at once, makes the  food more firm and thus easier to handle, and helps to loosen the skin  of foods that have been scalded. It also assists in destroying bacteria  by suddenly shocking the spores after the application of heat.  Cold-dipping, in conjunction with blanching or scalding, replaces the  long process of fractional sterilization, and is what makes the  one-period cold-pack method superior to this other process. To cold-dip  food, simply plunge that which has just been scalded or blanched into  cold water, as in Fig. 9, and then take it out at once.    37. PACKING THE JARS.--Packing the jars immediately follows  cold-dipping, and it is work that should be done as rapidly as possible.  Remove the jars from the hot water as they are needed and fill each with  the cold-dipped fruit or vegetable. Pack the jars in an orderly manner  and as solidly as possible with the aid of a spoon, as in Fig. 10. Just  this little attention to detail not only will help to improve the  appearance of the canned fruit, but will make it possible to put more  food in the jars.    [Illustration: FIG. 9]    When a jar is filled, pour into it whatever liquid is to be used, as in  Fig. 11. As has been stated, hot sirup is added for fruits and boiling  water and salt for vegetables. However, when fruit is to be canned  without sugar, only water is added. With tomatoes and some greens, no  liquid need be used, because they contain a sufficient amount in  themselves.    [Illustration: FIG. 10]    38. PREPARATION FOR THE WATER BATH.--As the jars are filled, they must  be prepared for the water bath. Therefore, proceed to place the rubber  and cover on the jar. Adjust the rubber, as shown in Fig. 12, so that it  will be flat in place. Then put the cover, or lid, on as in Fig. 13, but  do not tighten it. The cover must be loose enough to allow steam to  escape during the boiling in the water bath and thus prevent the jar  from bursting. If the cover screws on, as in the jar at the left, do not  screw it down tight; merely turn it lightly until it stops without  pressure being put upon it. If glass covers that fasten in place with  the aid of a clamp are to be used, as in the jar at the right, simply  push the wire over the cover and allow the clamp at the side to remain  up. Jars of food so prepared are ready for processing.    [Illustration: FIG 11]    [Illustration: FIG. 12]    39. PROCESSING.--The purpose of the water bath is to _process_ the food  contained in the jars before they are thoroughly sealed. Therefore, when  the jars are filled, proceed to place them in the water bath. The water,  which was placed in the sterilizer during the preparation of the food,  should be boiling, and there should be enough to come 2 inches over the  tops of the jars when they are placed in this large vessel. In putting  the jars of food into the sterilizer, place them upright and allow them  to rest on the rack in the bottom. If the filled jars have cooled, they  should be warmed before placing them in the sterilizer by putting them  in hot water. On account of the boiling water, the jars should be  handled with a jar lifter, as in Fig. 14. However, if the sterilizer is  provided with a perforated part like that in Fig. 15, all the jars may  be placed in it and then lowered in place.    [Illustration: FIG. 13]    When the jars are in place, put the tight-fitting cover on the  sterilizer and allow the water to boil and thus cook and sterilize the  food in the jars. The length of time for boiling varies with the kind of  food and is given later with the directions for canning different foods.  The boiling time should be counted from the instant the water in the  sterilizer begins to bubble violently. A good plan to follow, provided  an alarm clock is at hand, it to set it at this time, so that it will go  off when the jars are to be removed from the sterilizer.    [Illustration: FIG. 14]    [Illustration: FIG. 15]    40. SEALING THE JARS.--After processing the food in this manner, the  jars must be completely sealed. Therefore, after the boiling has  continued for the required length of time, remove the jars from the  water with the aid of the jar lifter or the tray and seal them at once  by clamping or screwing the covers, or lids, in place, as in Fig. 16.  Sometimes, the food inside the jars shrinks so much in this process that  the jars are not full when they are ready to be sealed. This is  illustrated in Fig. 17. Such shrinkage is usually the result of  insufficient blanching, or poor packing or both. However, it will not  prevent the food from keeping perfectly. Therefore, the covers of such  jars of food must not be removed and the jars refilled; rather, seal the  jars tight immediately, just as if the food entirely filled them. If, in  sealing jars removed from the water bath, it is found that a rubber has  worked loose, shove it back carefully with the point of a clean knife,  but do not remove the cover.    [Illustration: FIG. 15]    As the jars are sealed, place them on their sides or stand them upside  down, as in Fig. 18, to test for leaks, in a place where a draft will  not strike them and cause them to break. If a leak is found in any jar,  a new rubber and cover must be provided and the food then reprocessed  for a few minutes. This may seem to be a great inconvenience, but it is  the only way in which to be certain that the food will not be wasted  by spoiling.    [Illustration: FIG. 17]    [Illustration: FIG. 18]    [Illustration: FIG. 19]    41. WRAPPING AND LABELING.--When the jars of food have stood long  enough to cool, usually overnight, they are ready for wrapping and  labeling. Wrapping is advisable for practically all foods that are  canned, so as to prevent bleaching, and, of course, labeling is  necessary when canned food is wrapped, so as to enable it to be  distinguished readily when it is in storage. To wrap canned foods,  proceed as in Fig. 19. Use ordinary wrapping paper cut to a size that  will be suitable for the jar, and secure it in place with a rubber band,  as shown, or by pasting the label over the free edge.      PROCEDURE IN THE FRACTIONAL-STERILIZATION METHOD    42. In canning food by the FRACTIONAL-STERILIZATION CANNING METHOD, the  procedure is much the same as in the one-period cold-pack method. In  fact, the only difference between the two is that blanching and  cold-dipping are omitted, and in their stead the food in the jars is  subjected to three periods of cooking. When the jars of food are made  ready for processing in the sterilizer, they are put in the water bath,  boiled for a short time, and then allowed to cool. After 24 hours, they  are again boiled for the same length of time and allowed to cool. After  another 24 hours, they are subjected to boiling for a third time. Then  the jars of food are removed and sealed as in the one-period cold-pack  method. By the fractional-sterilization method, the spores of bacteria  contained in the food packed in the jars are given a chance to develop  during the 24-hour periods after the first and second cookings, those  which become active being destroyed by cooking the second and third  times. Although some canners prefer this method to those already  mentioned, the majority look on it with disfavor, owing to the length of  time it requires.      STEAM-PRESSURE METHODS    43. For canning foods by steam pressure, special equipment is necessary.  In one of the steam-pressure methods, what is known as a _water-seal  outfit_ is required, and in the other a device called a _pressure  cooker_ is employed. The work of getting the containers ready, preparing  the food for canning, packing it into the jars, and sealing and testing  the jars is practically the same in the steam pressure methods as in the  cold-pack methods. The difference lies in the cooking and sterilization  of the foods after they are in the jars and partly sealed and in the  rapidity with which it may be done.    44. CANNING WITH A WATER-SEAL OUTFIT.--A water-seal outfit, which may be  purchased in stores that sell canning supplies, consists of a large  metal vessel into which fits a perforated metal basket designed to hold  jars of food. This vessel is also provided with a tight-fitting cover  having an edge that passes down through the water, which is placed in  the bottom of the vessel. When heat is applied to the bottom of the  vessel, the water inside of it is changed into steam. The cover prevents  the steam from passing out, and it collects in and around the metal  basket supporting the jars of food. Enough steam is generated in this  outfit to raise the temperature about 4 to 6 degrees above the boiling  point. Thus, the water-seal outfit will cook the food in the cans in  about one-fourth less time than will the water bath of the one-period  cold-pack canning method.    [Illustration: FIG. 20]    45.

GEORGE'S BRIDGE.    5TH MARCH.--Early this morning the stockman brought over two natives,  brothers, who were to guide us to water ten miles on towards the Narran,  which was said to be thirty-five miles off. In the first two miles we  passed over some soft ground. Further on, hills were visible to the left,  which our native guides called Goodeingora. Fragments of conglomerate  rocks appeared in the soil of the plains, pebbles and grains of quartz  cemented by felspar. These plains appeared to become undulating ground as  we proceeded northward, and the surface became firmer. At length the  country opened into slight undulations, well clothed with grass, and good  for travelling over, the soil being full of the same hard rock found on  the rising grounds nearest to the Darling, in the lowest parts of that  river explored formerly by me. The red earth seemed to be but the  decomposed matrix of that rock, as the water-worn pebbles of quartz so  thickly set therein, here covered the ground in some places so thickly as  to resemble snow. Much Anthistiria and other good grasses grew on those  plains. I was, indeed, most agreeably surprised at the firm undulating  stony surface and open character of the country, where I had expected to  see soft clay, and holes and scrubs. At six miles, other slight  elevations appeared to the N. E. which the natives called Toolowly, a  name well calculated to fix in white men's memory elevations TOO LOW to  be called hills. They were quite high enough, however, along a line of  route for such heavy drays as those following us. There appeared much  novelty in the trees on this side the Darling. The ANGOPHORA LANCEOLATA  was every where; Callitris grew about the base of the hills, and some  very singular acacias, a long-leaved grey kind of wattle, the ACACIA  STENOPHYLLA of Cunningham. On one tree large pods hung in such profusion  as to bend the branches to the ground. From this abundance I supposed it  was not good to be eaten; nevertheless, I found in another place many of  the same pods roasted at some fires of the natives, and learnt from our  guides that they eat the pea. The pod somewhat resembled that of the  Cachou nut of the Brazils,--Munumula is the native name. The grasses  comprised a great variety, and amongst the plants a beautiful little  BRUNONIA, not more than four inches high, with smaller flower-heads than  those of BR. SERICEA, quite simple or scarcely at all lobed, and a hairy  indusium.[*] The tree, still a nondescript, although the fruit had been  gathered by me in 1831, and then sent to Mr. Brown, was also here; and I  saw one or two trees of a species of CAPPARIS. Mr. Stephenson found a  great variety of new insects also.    [* B. SIMPLEX (Lindl. MSS.); pumila, foliis undique scapisque  longitudinaliter sericeis, villis appressis, capitulis subsimplicibus,  bracteis majoribus oblongis, indusio extus piloso.]    Our guides brought us at length to some waterholes, amongst some verdant  grass on a plain, where no stranger would have looked for water; and here  we encamped fifteen good miles from the Barwan. The ponds were called  \"Carawy,\" and were vitally important to us, enabling us to pass on  towards the Narran, which was still, as we had been informed, twenty-five  miles off. As we approached these springs, I saw some natives running  off, and I sent one of the guides after them to say we should do them no  harm, and beg them to stop, but he could not overtake them. The  undulations crossed by us this day seemed to extend east and west in  their elongations, and were probably parallel to the general course of  the main channel of drainage. The same felspathic rock seen in other  parts of this great basin, seems the basis of the clay, although the  fragments imbedded are very hard. The earth is reddish, and much  resembles in this respect the matrix of the conglomerate. Near these  springs we found a new HELICHRYSUM.[*] Thermometer at sunrise, 61 deg.; at  noon, 100 deg.; at 4 P. M., 102 deg.; at 9, 79 deg.;--with wet bulb, 65 deg..    [* HELICHRYSUM RAMOSISSIMUM (Hook. MSS.); suffruticosum valde ramosum  arachnoideo-tomentosum, foliis lineari-spathulatis subflaccidis acutis,  capitulis in racemis terminalibus parvis globosis flavis, involucri  squamis lineari-subulatis undulatis fimbriato-ciliatis.]    6TH MARCH.--The drays not having come up, in consequence of the excessive  length of yesterday's journey, and very hot weather--(161/2 miles by  latitude alone)--we were obliged to remain inactive here on a beautiful  cool morning. I found near the ponds, several huts made of fresh branches  of trees and the remains of fires, doubtless the deserted home of the  fugitives of yesterday. At these fires I found the roasted pods of the  acacia already mentioned (Munumula). The water was surrounded by fresh  herbage, and such was the simple fare of those aborigines, such the home  whence they fled. As I looked at it in the presence of my sable guides, I  could not but reflect that the white man's cattle would soon trample  these holes into a quagmire of mud, and destroy the surrounding verdure  and pleasant freshness for ever. I feared that my good-natured but acute  guides thought as much, and I blushed inwardly [*] for our pallid race.    [* The author of Waverley maintains that one may LAUGH inwardly--  conscience may, I suppose, make us also blush inwardly sometimes.]    All day we sat still in anxious suspense about the non-arrival of our  drays--the ground having been so good. With a country so interesting  before us, this delay was doubly irksome, and as the cattle could only be  watered by coming forward, why they did not come was the question; and  this was not solved until evening, when a messenger came forward to ask  if they might come, and to inform me that they were nearly exhausted. The  fatal alternative of endeavouring to make them work in the morning, after  passing a night without water, had been adopted, and as, on the day  before, they had been worked until dusk in expectation of reaching my  camp, they could not draw on the morning after; I instantly directed them  to be brought forward; but the consequence of this derangement was the  death of one, and much injury to many others. This contretemps arose  wholly from the guides not having been understood at the Barwan as to the  real distance, and this we had calculated too surely upon. Latitude 29 deg.  52' 26\" south. Thermometer at sunrise, 68 deg.; at noon, 96 deg.; at 4 P. M.,  102 deg.; at 9, 83 deg.;--with wet bulb, 68 deg..    7TH MARCH, 1846.--The bullocks having been sent back after they had been  watered last evening, the drays came up about 9 A. M. I left them in Mr.  Kennedy's charge, and proceeded with the light carts followed by all the  bullocks yoked up. They had trodden into mud the little water that had  been left at that camp, and could not live much longer without more. The  guides assured us the Narran was not far off, although we had understood  when at the Barwan that the distance was twenty-five miles from these  springs. We passed over very good ground, and found the country to  improve as we advanced. We were conducted through the most open parts of  scrubs by our guides, who were made to comprehend clearly how desirable  that was for our \"wheelbarrows;\" and after travelling about seven miles,  they pointed to a line of trees as the \"Narran,\" beyond an extensive open  country, which had a singular appearance from being higher than that we  were upon. We crossed one or two slight elevations wholly composed of  compact felspar in blocks--forming ridges resembling an outcrop of  strata, whereof the strike always pointed N. W. and S. E. Various curious  new plants and fruits appeared; amongst others a solanum, the berry of  which was a very pleasant-tasted fruit. The plant was a runner and spread  over several yards from one root. There was also a fruit shaped like an  elongated egg; it appeared to be some Asclepiad, and was called by the  natives \"Doobah.\" They ate it, seeds and all, but said it was"]]]
