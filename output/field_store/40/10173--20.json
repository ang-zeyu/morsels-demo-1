[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12573"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 08 (#17)"],[1,"each one \"the  dear\" or \"the good\" or \"the worthy.\" Barefoot reaped a great deal of  praise everywhere she delivered these greetings, and each time pointed  to the precise place, and said:    \"See--there it stands!\"    For a time Barefoot was silent and abstracted; she seemed to repent of  having let her brother go, or of having refused to go with him. Formerly  she had always been heard singing in the stable and barn, in the kitchen  and chamber, and when she went out with the scythe over her shoulder and  the grass-cloth under her arm; but now she was silent. She seemed to be  making an effort to restrain herself. Still there was one time when she  allowed people to hear her voice again; in the evening, when she put  Farmer Rodel's children to bed, she sang incessantly, even long after  the children were asleep. Then she would hurry over to Black Marianne's  and supply her with wood and water and whatever else the old woman  wanted.    On Sunday afternoons, when everybody was out for a good time, Barefoot  often used to stand quiet and motionless at the door of her house,  looking out into the world and at the sky in dreamy, far-off meditation,  wondering where Damie was now and how he was getting on. And then she  would stand and gaze for a long time at an overturned plow, or watch a  fowl clawing in the sand. When a vehicle passed through the village, she  would look up and say, almost aloud:    \"They are driving to somebody. On all the roads of the world there is  nobody coming to me, and no one thinking of me. And do I not belong here  too?\"    And then she would make believe to herself that she was expecting  something, and her heart would beat faster, as if for somebody who was  coming. And involuntarily the old song rose to her lips:      All the brooklets in the wide world,    They run their way to the Sea;    But there's no one in this wide world,    Who can open my heart for me.    \"I wish I were as old as you,\" she once said to Black Marianne, after  dreaming in this way.    \"Be glad that a wish is but a word,\" replied the old woman. \"When I was  your age I was merry; and down there at the plaster-mill I weighed a  hundred and thirty-two pounds.\"    \"But you are the same at one time as at another, while I am not at  all--even.\"    \"If one wants to be 'even' one had better cut one's nose off, and then  one's face will be even all over. You little simpleton! Don't fret your  young years away, for nobody will give them back to you; and the old  ones will come of their own accord.\"    Black Marianne did not find it very difficult to comfort Barefoot; only  when she was alone, did a strange anxiety come over her. What did it  mean?    A wonderful rumor was now pervading the village; for many days there had  been talk of a wedding that was to be celebrated at Endringen, with such  festivities as had not been seen in the country within the memory of  man. The eldest daughter of Dominic and Ameile--whom we know, from  Lehnhold--was to marry a rich wood-merchant from the Murg Valley, and it  was said that there would be such merry-making as had never yet been  seen.    The day drew nearer and nearer. Wherever two girls meet, they draw each  other behind a hedge or into the hallway of a house, and there's no end  to their talking, though they declare emphatically that they are in a  particular hurry. It is said that everybody from the Oberland is coming,  and everybody from the Murg Valley for a distance of sixty miles! For it  is a large family. At the Town-hall pump, there the true gossiping goes  on; but not a single girl will own to having a new dress, lest she  should lose the pleasure of seeing the surprise and admiration of her  companions, when the day arrived. In the excitement of asking and  answering questions, the duty of water-carrying is forgotten, and  Barefoot, who arrives last, is the first to leave with her bucketful of  water. What is the dance to her? And yet she feels as if she hears music  everywhere.    The next day Barefoot had much running back and forth to do in the  house; for she was to dress Rose for the great occasion. She received  many an unseen knock while she was plaiting her hair, but bore them in  silence. Rose had a fine head of hair, and she was determined it should  make a fine show. Today she wished to try something new with it; she  wanted to have a Maria-Theresa braid, as a certain artistic arrangement  of fourteen braids is called in those parts. That would create a  sensation as something new. Barefoot succeeded in accomplishing the  difficult task, but she had scarcely finished when Rose tore it all down  in anger; and with her hair hanging down over her brow and face, she  looked wild enough.    But for all that she was handsome and stately, and very plump; her whole  demeanor seemed to say: \"There must be not less than four horses in the  house into which I marry.\" And many farmers' sons were, indeed, courting  her, but she did not seem to care to make up her mind in favor of any  one of them. She now decided to keep to the country fashion of having  two braids, interwoven with red ribbons, hanging down her back and  reaching almost to the ground. At last she stood adorned and ready.    But now she had to have a nosegay. She had allowed her own flowers to  run wild; and in spite of all objections, Barefoot was ultimately  obliged to yield to her importunities and rob her own cherished plants  on her window-sill of almost all their blossoms. Rose also demanded the  little rosemary plant; but Barefoot would rather have torn that in  pieces than give it up. Rose began to jeer and laugh, and then to scold  and mock the stupid goose-girl, who gave herself such obstinate airs,  and who had been taken into the house only out of charity. Barefoot did  not reply; but she turned a glance at Rose which made the girl cast down  her eyes.    And now a red, woolen rose had come loose on Rose's left shoe, and  Barefoot had just knelt down to sew it on carefully, when Rose said,  half ashamed of her own behavior, and yet half jeeringly:    \"Barefoot, I will have it so--you must come to the dance today.\"    \"Do not mock so. What do you want of me?\"    \"I am not mocking,\" persisted Rose, still in a somewhat jeering tone.  \"You, too, ought to dance once, for you are a young girl, and there will  be some of your equals at the wedding--our stable-boy is going, or  perhaps some farmer's son will dance with you. I'll send you some one  who is without a partner.\"    \"Let me be in peace--or I shall prick you.\"    \"My sister-in-law is right,\" said the young farmer's wife, who, until  now, had sat silent. \"I'll never give you a good word again if you don't  go to the dance today. Come--sit down, and I will get you ready.\"    Barefoot felt herself flushing crimson as she sat there while her  mistress dressed her and brushed her hair away from her face and turned  it all back; and she almost sank from her chair, when the farmer's wife  said:    \"I am going to arrange your hair as the Allgau girls wear it. That will  suit you very well, for you look like an Allgau girl yourself--sturdy,  and brown, and round. You look like Dame Landfried's daughter at  Zusmarshofen.\"    \"Why like her daughter? What made you think of her?\" asked Barefoot, and  she trembled all over.    How was it that she was just now reminded again of Dame Landfried, who  had been in her mind from childhood, and who had once appeared to her  like the benevolent spirit in a fairy-tale? But Barefoot had no ring  that she could turn and cause her to appear; but mentally she could  conjure her up, and that she often did, almost involuntarily.    \"Hold still, or I'll pull your hair,\" said the farmer's wife; and  Barefoot sat motionless, scarcely daring to breathe. And while her hair  was being parted in the middle, and she sat with her arms folded and  allowed her mistress to do what she liked with her, and while her  mistress, who was expecting a baby very soon, bustled about her, she  really felt as if she had suddenly been bewitched; she did not say a  word for fear of breaking the charm, but sat with her eyes cast down in  modest submission.    \"I wish I could dress you thus for your own wedding,\" said the farmer's  wife, who seemed to be overflowing with kindness today. \"I should like  to see you mistress of a respectable farm, and you would not be a bad  bargain for any man; but nowadays such things don't happen, for money  runs after money. Well, do you be contented--so long as I live you shall  not want for anything; and if I die--and I don't know, but I seem to  fear the heavy hour so much this time--look, you will not forsake my  children, but will be a mother to them, will you not?\"    \"Oh, good heavens! How can you think of such a thing?\" cried Barefoot,  and the tears ran down her cheeks. \"That is a sin; for one may commit a  sin by letting thoughts enter one's mind that are not right.\"    \"Yes, yes, you may be right,\" said the farmer's wife. \"But wait--sit  still a moment; I will bring you my necklace and put it around your  neck.\"    \"No, pray don't do that! I can wear nothing that is not my own; I should  sink to the ground for shame of myself.\"    \"Yes, but you can't go as you are. Or have you, perhaps, something of  your own?\"    Hereupon Barefoot said that she, to be sure, had a necklace which had  been presented to her as a child by Dame Landfried, but that on account  of Damie's emigration it was in pledge with the sexton's widow.    Barefoot was then told to sit still and to promise not to look at  herself in the glass until the farmer's wife returned; and the latter  hurried away to get the ornament, herself being surety for the money  lent upon it.    What a thrill now went through Barefoot's soul as she sat there! She  who had always waited upon others was now being waited upon  herself!--and indeed almost as if under a spell. She was almost afraid  of the dance; for she was now being treated so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1259"],[0,"Twenty Years After (#17)"],[1,"am turned forty years old.\"    \"Indeed! Then 'tis I who am mistaken, for you have always been a good  chronologist. By your reckoning I must be forty-three at least. The  devil I am! Don't let it out at the Hotel Rambouillet; it would ruin  me,\" replied the abbe.    \"Don't be afraid,\" said D'Artagnan. \"I never go there.\"    \"Why, what in the world,\" cried Aramis, \"is that animal Bazin doing?  Bazin! Hurry up there, you rascal; we are mad with hunger and thirst!\"    Bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each hand.    \"At last,\" said Aramis, \"we are ready, are we?\"    \"Yes, monsieur, quite ready,\" said Bazin; \"but it took me some time to  bring up all the----\"    \"Because you always think you have on your shoulders your beadle's robe,  and spend all your time reading your breviary. But I give you warning  that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up  my sword, I will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see  that you are roasted on it.\"    Bazin, scandalized, made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his  hand. D'Artagnan, more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of  the Abbe d'Herblay, which contrasted so strongly with those of the  Musketeer Aramis, remained staring with wide-open eyes at the face of  his friend.    Bazin quickly covered the table with a damask cloth and arranged upon it  so many things, gilded, perfumed, appetizing, that D'Artagnan was quite  overcome.    \"But you expected some one then?\" asked the officer.    \"Oh,\" said Aramis, \"I always try to be prepared; and then I knew you  were seeking me.\"    \"From whom?\"    \"From Master Bazin, to be sure; he took you for the devil, my dear  fellow, and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if  I should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers.\"    \"Oh, monsieur!\" said Bazin, clasping his hands supplicatingly.    \"Come, no hypocrisy! you know that I don't like it. You will do much  better to open the window and let down some bread, a chicken and a  bottle of wine to your friend Planchet, who has been this last hour  killing himself clapping his hands.\"    Planchet, in fact, had bedded and fed his horses, and then coming back  under the window had repeated two or three times the signal agreed upon.    Bazin obeyed, fastened to the end of a cord the three articles  designated and let them down to Planchet, who then went satisfied to his  shed.    \"Now to supper,\" said Aramis.    The two friends sat down and Aramis began to cut up fowls, partridges  and hams with admirable skill.    \"The deuce!\" cried D'Artagnan; \"do you live in this way always?\"    \"Yes, pretty well. The coadjutor has given me dispensations from fasting  on the jours maigres, on account of my health; then I have engaged as my  cook the cook who lived with Lafollone--you know the man I mean?--the  friend of the cardinal, and the famous epicure whose grace after dinner  used to be, 'Good Lord, do me the favor to cause me to digest what I  have eaten.'\"    \"Nevertheless he died of indigestion, in spite of his grace,\" said  D'Artagnan.    \"What can you expect?\" replied Aramis, in a tone of resignation. \"Every  man that's born must fulfil his destiny.\"    \"If it be not an indelicate question,\" resumed D'Artagnan, \"have you  grown rich?\"    \"Oh, Heaven! no. I make about twelve thousand francs a year, without  counting a little benefice of a thousand crowns the prince gave me.\"    \"And how do you make your twelve thousand francs? By your poems?\"    \"No, I have given up poetry, except now and then to write a drinking  song, some gay sonnet or some innocent epigram; I compose sermons, my  friend.\"    \"What! sermons? Do you preach them?\"    \"No; I sell them to those of my cloth who wish to become great orators.\"    \"Ah, indeed! and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation  yourself?\"    \"I should, my dear D'Artagnan, have been so, but nature said 'No.' When  I am in the pulpit, if by chance a pretty woman looks at me, I look at  her again: if she smiles, I smile too. Then I speak at random; instead  of preaching about the torments of hell I talk of the joys of Paradise.  An event took place in the Church of St. Louis au Marais. A gentleman  laughed in my face. I stopped short to tell him that he was a fool; the  congregation went out to get stones to stone me with, but whilst they  were away I found means to conciliate the priests who were present, so  that my foe was pelted instead of me. 'Tis true that he came the next  morning to my house, thinking that he had to do with an abbe--like all  other abbes.\"    \"And what was the end of the affair?\"    \"We met in the Place Royale--Egad! you know about it.\"    \"Was I not your second?\" cried D'Artagnan.    \"You were; you know how I settled the matter.\"    \"Did he die?\"    \"I don't know. But, at all events, I gave him absolution in articulo  mortis. 'Tis enough to kill the body, without killing the soul.\"    Bazin made a despairing sign which meant that while perhaps he approved  the moral he altogether disapproved the tone in which it was uttered.    \"Bazin, my friend,\" said Aramis, \"you don't seem to be aware that I can  see you in that mirror, and you forget that once for all I have  forbidden all signs of approbation or disapprobation. You will do me the  favor to bring us some Spanish wine and then to withdraw. Besides, my  friend D'Artagnan has something to say to me privately, have you not,  D'Artagnan?\"    D'Artagnan nodded his head and Bazin retired, after placing on the table  the Spanish wine.    The two friends, left alone, remained silent, face to face. Aramis  seemed to await a comfortable digestion; D'Artagnan, to be preparing his  exordium. Each of them, when the other was not looking, hazarded a sly  glance. It was Aramis who broke the silence.    \"What are you thinking of, D'Artagnan?\" he began.    \"I was thinking, my dear old friend, that when you were a musketeer you  turned your thoughts incessantly to the church, and now that you are an  abbe you are perpetually longing to be once more a musketeer.\"    \"'Tis true; man, as you know,\" said Aramis, \"is a strange animal, made  up of contradictions. Since I became an abbe I dream of nothing but  battles.\"    \"That is apparent in your surroundings; you have rapiers here of every  form and to suit the most exacting taste. Do you still fence well?\"    \"I--I fence as well as you did in the old time--better still, perhaps; I  do nothing else all day.\"    \"And with whom?\"    \"With an excellent master-at-arms that we have here.\"    \"What! here?\"    \"Yes, here, in this convent, my dear fellow. There is everything in a  Jesuit convent.\"    \"Then you would have killed Monsieur de Marsillac if he had come alone  to attack you, instead of at the head of twenty men?\"    \"Undoubtedly,\" said Aramis, \"and even at the head of his twenty men, if  I could have drawn without being recognized.\"    \"God pardon me!\" said D'Artagnan to himself, \"I believe he has become  more Gascon than I am!\" Then aloud: \"Well, my dear Aramis, do you ask me  why I came to seek you?\"    \"No, I have not asked you that,\" said Aramis, with his subtle manner;  \"but I have expected you to tell me.\"    \"Well, I sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to  kill Monsieur de Marsillac whenever you please, prince though he is.\"    \"Hold on! wait!\" said Aramis; \"that is an idea!\"    \"Of which I invite you to take advantage, my friend. Let us see; with  your thousand crowns from the abbey and the twelve thousand francs you  make by selling sermons, are you rich? Answer frankly.\"    \"I? I am as poor as Job, and were you to search my pockets and my boxes  I don't believe you would find a hundred pistoles.\"    \"Peste! a hundred pistoles!\" said D'Artagnan to himself; \"he calls that  being as poor as Job! If I had them I should think myself as rich as  Croesus.\" Then aloud: \"Are you ambitious?\"    \"As Enceladus.\"    \"Well, my friend, I bring you the means of becoming rich, powerful, and  free to do whatever you wish.\"    The shadow of a cloud passed over Aramis's face as quickly as that which  in August passes over the field of grain; but quick as it was, it did  not escape D'Artagnan's observation.    \"Speak on,\" said Aramis.    \"One question first. Do you take any interest in politics?\"    A gleam of light shone in Aramis's eyes, as brief as the shadow that had  passed over his face, but not so brief but that it was seen by  D'Artagnan.    \"No,\" Aramis replied.    \"Then proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you, since for the  moment you have no master but God?\"    \"It is possible.\"    \"Have you, my dear Aramis, thought sometimes of those happy, happy,  happy days of youth we passed laughing, drinking, and fighting each  other for play?\"    \"Certainly, and more than once regretted them; it was indeed a glorious  time.\"    \"Well, those splendidly wild days may chance to come again; I am  commissioned to find out my companions and I began by you, who were the  very soul of our society.\"    Aramis bowed, rather with respect than pleasure at the compliment.    \"To meddle in politics,\" he exclaimed, in a languid voice, leaning back  in his easy-chair. \"Ah! dear D'Artagnan! see how regularly I live and  how easy I am here. We have experienced the ingratitude of 'the great,'  as you well know.\"    \"'Tis true,\" replied D'Artagnan. \"Yet the great sometimes repent of  their ingratitude.\"    \"In that case it would be quite another thing. Come! let's be merciful  to every sinner! Besides, you are right in another respect, which is in  thinking that if we were to meddle in politics there could not be a  better time than the present.\"    \"How can you know that? You who never interest yourself in politics?\"    \"Ah! without caring about them myself, I live among those who are much  occupied in them. Poet as I am, I am intimate with Sarazin, who is  devoted to the Prince de Conti, and with Monsieur de Bois-Robert,"]]]
