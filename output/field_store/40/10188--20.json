[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12928"],[0,"Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia, Volume 1 (#17)"],[1,"th, the northern limits of the plain, we  encountered, after passing through some slight woods of Acacia pendula  and eucalyptus, a thick brush through which we were obliged to open a way  with axes for a mile and a half.    MEET A TRIBE OF NATIVES.    While engaged in this work, one of the men said he heard voices. On  gaining once more the opener forest, we saw two newly felled trees which  had been cut with an iron axe or tomahawk; and immediately after we  perceived the natives at a little distance. They were hurrying off, but  being most anxious to conciliate them and gain if possible some  information respecting the country, I sent Dawkins, who was an eager  volunteer on the occasion, forward to them, and he prevailed on several  to stop and speak to him, while their women and children decamped. When  they seemed no longer disposed to run, I ventured forward; but those who  had got round Dawkins, on seeing me approach, made off, one by one, until  none remained when I rode up to Dawkins, except a young man. Not a word  was understood on either side, yet our new acquaintance talked fluently,  and also repeated what we said to him. He carried no spear or weapon,  with the exception of three little sticks, which he held in the left  hand; neither did he wear any dress or ornament, nor was his skin much  scarified. His features were not bad, and they wore an expression of  extreme good nature. We now regretted more than ever the absence of Mr.  Brown, as with his assistance we might now have learnt so much respecting  the rivers and the country before us. The tribe appeared to consist of  about thirty individuals; those who remained, at a distance, carried  spears, and were evidently much afraid of us. The string of low slang  words which the natives nearer the colony suppose to be our language,  while our stockmen believe they speak theirs, was of no use here. In vain  did Dawkins address them thus: \"What for you jerran budgerry  whitefellow?\" \"Whitefellow brother belong it to blackfellow.\"* Neither  had the piece of tobacco, which he had put in the stranger's mouth, any  effect in bringing intelligible words out of it, although the poor fellow  complacently chewed the bitter weed. He readily ate some bread which was  given him, and on presenting him with a halfpenny he signified by gesture  that he should wear it at his breast, a fashion of the natives nearer the  colony. I placed in his hand a small tomahawk, the most valuable of gifts  to his tribe; and leaving him enriched thus, we quietly continued our  journey, that the tribe might see our purpose had no particular reference  to them, and that they had no cause for alarm, as our behaviour to the  young man must have sufficiently testified.    (*Footnote. Meaning: Why are you afraid of a good white man? The white  man is the black man's brother.)    We soon after entered another extensive plain on which the rich soil,  when we had got halfway across, changed to a stiff clay, the grass  marking the change by a difference of colour, being red on the clay and  quite green on the other soil. This clay occupied the highest part of the  plain. Passing through another scrub of Acacia pendula we reached a still  more extensive plain, and while we were crossing it I was informed, by  the carpenter, that the wheels of one of the carts were falling to pieces  and required immediate repair. We accordingly halted, and some wedges  were driven into them. The thermometer here stood at 97 degrees.    AGAIN OBLIGED TO CUT OUR WAY.    A brush of Acacia pendula also bounded this plain on the north; and  beyond it we entered a scrub of forest-oak (casuarina) which was so very  thick that we were compelled to halt the carts until a way could be cut  through it for upwards of two miles; beyond that distance however the  brush opened into patches of clearer ground. We had changed our course to  north in the large plain, and had preserved this direction in cutting  through these scrubs. It was now four P.M., and during the whole journey  from six A.M., we had seen no water; the day also was exceedingly warm,  and I was riding in advance of the party, and looking at some elevated  ground in an opening of the wood with thoughts of encamping there, but  very doubtful whether we should ever see water again.    FORTUNATE DISCOVERY OF WATER.    When almost in despair I observed a small hollow with an unusually large  gumtree hanging over it; and my delight under such circumstances may be  imagined, when I perceived on going forward, the goodly white trunk of  the tree reflected in a large pond. A grassy flat beside the water proved  quite a home to us, affording food for our cattle, and rest from the  fatigues of that laborious day. We found these ponds in situations which  seemed rather elevated above the adjacent plains, at least their  immediate banks were higher; hence we usually came upon them where we  least expected to see water, before we were acquainted with this  peculiarity of the country. The pond where we now encamped was connected  with several others that were dry, but it was quite impossible at that  time to discover which way the current ran in times of flood. The  latitude was 30 degrees 6 minutes 30 seconds South. In the evening the  sky was illuminated so much by an extensive fire in the woods near us  that the light was clearer in our camp than the brightest moonlight.    DRY VALLEYS.    January 4.    Continuing due north, we just avoided some thick scrubs, which either on  the right or left would have been very difficult to penetrate. The woods  opened gradually however, into a thick copse of Acacia pendula, and at  the end of three miles we reached the eastern skirts of an extensive open  plain, the ground gently undulating. At 4 3/4 miles, on ascending a  slight eminence, we suddenly overlooked a rather deep channel, containing  abundance of water in ponds, the opposite banks being the highest ground  visible. The vast plains thus watered consist chiefly of a rich  dark-coloured earth, to the depth of 30 or 40 feet. Unabraded fragments  of trap are not uncommon in the soil of these plains, and I imagined  there was a want of symmetry in the hollows and slopes as compared with  features more closely connected with hills elsewhere. At 8 1/2 miles,  perceiving boundless plains to the northward, I changed the direction of  our route 24 degrees east of north. The plains extended westward to the  horizon, and opened to our view an extensive prospect towards the  north-east, into the country north of the range of Nundewar, a region  apparently champaign, but including a few isolated and picturesque hills.  Patches of wood were scattered over the level parts, and we hastened  towards a land of such promising aspect. Water however was the great  object of our search, but I had no doubt that I should find enough in a  long valley before us, which descended from the range on the east. In  this I was nevertheless mistaken; for although the valley was well  escarped, it did not contain even the trace of a watercourse.    MOUNT FRAZER.    Crossing the ridge beyond it, to a valley still deeper, which extended  under a ridge of very remarkable hills, we met with no better success;  nor yet when we had followed the valley to its union with another, under  a hill which I named Mount Frazer, after the botanist of that name.    THE PARTY IN DISTRESS FOR WANT OF WATER.    No other prospect of relief from this most distressing of all privations  remained to us, and the day was one of extraordinary heat, for the  thermometer, which had never before been above 101 degrees on this  journey, now stood at 108 degrees in the shade. The party had travelled  sixteen miles, and the cattle could not be driven further with any better  prospect of finding water. We therefore encamped in this valley while I  explored it upwards, but found all dry and desolate. Mr. White returned  late, after a most laborious but equally fruitless search northward, and  we consequently passed a most disagreeable afternoon. Unable to eat, the  cattle lay groaning, and the men extended on their backs watched some  heavy thunderclouds which at length stretched over the sky; the very  crows sat on the trees with their mouths open.    The thunder roared and the cloud broke darkly over us, but its liquid  contents seemed to evaporate in the middle air. At half-past seven a  strong hot wind set in from the north-east and continued during the  night. Thermometer 90 degrees. I was suddenly awoke from feverish sleep  by a violent shaking of my tent, and I distinctly heard the flapping of  very large wings, as if some bird, perhaps an owl, had perched upon it.    January 5.    The sun's rays were scorching before his red orb had cleared the horizon,  but ere he appeared the party was in motion. No dew had fallen, yet even  the distressed bullocks and horses seemed to participate in the hope  which led us forward. With one accord men and quadrupeds hastened from  the inhospitable valley, common sufferers from the want of an element so  essential to the living world. Continuing on the same bearing of 24  degrees east of north we reached the highest part of some clear ground,  at about two miles from where we had encamped, and from this spot I  obtained an extensive view over the country before us. The ground sloped  for several miles towards a line of trees beyond which a steep ridge  extended parallel to that line, and upwards to the mountains, evidently  enclosing a channel of drainage, so that I ventured at once, on seeing  this, to assure the men that I saw where we should meet with water. The  way to it was all downhill, open and smooth; while the Nundewar range,  now to the southward, presented, on this northern side, a beautiful  variety of summits.    WATER FOUND NEXT DAY. DISCOVER A SMALL RIVER.    I galloped impatiently towards the line of wood, and found there a  meandering channel full of water, with steep"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12929"],[0,"A Voyage to Terra Australis — Volume 1 (#17)"],[1,"shoals;  when they saw much water inland, as if the country were drowned, but no  men, nor any thing for food; and, wherever they dug, the ground was salt.  They afterwards came to another river, which they ascended about one  league, and found it to terminate in a round basin, and to be entirely  salt water. No men were seen, nor any animals, except divers which were  very shy; and the country was destitute of grass and trees. Returning  downward on the 10th, they saw footsteps of men and children, of the  common size, and observed the point of entrance into the river to be of a  very red sand.    The ships appear to have left Dirk Hartog's Road on Feb. 12. In the  evening, the west variation was observed to be 7 deg. 21'; am on the 13th,  they saw a cliffy point from whence three shoals, connected by a reef,  stretch out to the N. N. E. The shore here, in latitude 24 deg. 42', lies S.  by E. and N. by W. On the 16th, they passed round the point, and steered  southward along the inner side of this land; and having doubled its south  end, found that it was it was an island: their latitude was then 24 deg. 54'.    Feb. 17. The variation was observed to be 5 deg. west, in latitude 23 deg. 59'.  Eight miles south of this situation they saw a bay with a rugged point;  but to the northward the land was low: the variation was 7 deg. 3', in the  evening. They discovered some reefs on the 19th, lying three geographic  miles off shore; and also a point or cape (the North-west Cape) from  which a reef extended two miles to the N. N. W. On the north side of this  cape is a bay, where the Geelvink anchored; and a little further on  (eastward), the other two vessels found an _opening like a river, whose  entrance was twelve miles wide_. They went into it, _but could no where  find anchorage_. The bay is called _Willem's River_; and the two vessels  afterwards there joined the Geelvink: it is in 21 deg. 28'. The same day it  was determined to sail for Batavia, every thing having been done that the  commodore's orders required; and, on the 21st, they departed accordingly.    Thus the West Coast, from the island Rottenest to the North-west Cape,  was examined with care by Vlaming; and it is most probable, that the  chart in Van Keulen, which Mr. Dalrymple republished, and was the best  known at the end of the eighteenth century, resulted from this same  voyage.    DAMPIER. 1699.    CAPTAIN WILLIAM DAMPIER visited, a second time, the western coasts of  Terra Australis; being then sent out purposely for discovery, in his  Majesty's ship the _Roebuck_.    In the night of Aug. 1, 1699, he struck soundings upon the northern part  of the Abrolhos shoal, in latitude about 27 deg. 40' south. Next morning he  saw the main coast, and ran northward along it; discovering, in 26. 10',  an opening two leagues wide, but full of rocks and foul ground. Aug. 6,  he anchored (in _Dirk Hartog's Road_) at the entrance of a sound, which  he named SHARK's BAY, in latitude 25 deg. 5' south. He remained there eight  days, examining the sound, cutting wood upon the islands, fishing, etc.;  and gives a description of what was seen in his usually circumstantial  manner.*    [* For the full account of Dampier's proceedings and observations, with  views of the land, see his _Voyages_, Vol. III. page 81, _et seq_.]    An animal found upon one of the islands is described as \"a sort of  raccoon, different from that of the West Indies, chiefly as to the legs;  for these have very short fore legs; but go jumping upon them\" (not upon  the short fore, but the long hind, legs, it is to be presumed), \"as the  others do; and like them are very good meat.\" This appears to have been  the small kangaroo, since found upon the islands which form the road; and  if so, this description is probably the first ever made of that singular  animal.    Leaving Shark's Bay on Aug. 14, captain Dampier steered northward, along  the coast; but at too great a distance to make much observation upon it,  until he got round the North-west Cape. On the 22nd, he saw an extensive  cluster of islands; and anchored, in latitude 20 deg. 21', under one of the  largest, which he called _Rosemary Island_. This was near the southern  part of De Witt's Land; but, besides an error in latitude of 40', he  complains that, in _Tasman's chart_, \"the shore is laid down as all along  joining in one body, or continent, with some openings like rivers; and  not like islands, as really they are.\"--\"By what we saw of them, they  must have been a range of islands, of about twenty leagues in length,  stretching from E. N. E. to W. S. W.; and for ought I know, as far as to  those of Shark's Bay; and to a considerable breadth also, for we could  see nine or ten leagues in amongst them, towards the continent or main  land of New Holland, _if there be any such thing hereabouts_: And by the  great tides I met with awhile afterwards, more to the north-east, I had a  strong suspicion that here might be a kind of archipelago of islands; and  a passage, possibly, to the to the south of New Holland and New Guinea,  into the great South Sea, eastward.\"    Not finding fresh water upon such of the islands as were visited that  day, captain Dampier quitted his anchorage next morning, and \"steered  away E. N. E., coasting along as the land lies.\" He seems to have kept  the land in sight, in the day time, at the distance of four to six  leagues; but the shore being low, this was too far for him to be certain  whether all was main land which he saw; and what might have been passed  in the night was still more doubtful.    Aug. 30, being in latitude 18 deg. 21', and the weather fair, captain Dampier  steered in for the shore; and anchored in 8 fathoms, about three-and-half  leagues off. The tide ran \"very swift here; so that our nun-buoy would  not bear above the water to be seen. It flows here, as on that part of  New Holland I described formerly, about five fathoms.\"    He had hitherto seen no inhabitants; but now met with several. The place  at which he had touched in the former voyage \"was not above forty or  fifty leagues to the north-east of this. And these were much the same  blinking creatures (here being also abundance of the same kind of flesh  flies teizing them), and with the same black skins, and hair frizzled,  tall and thin, etc., as those were. But we had not the opportunity to see  whether these, as the former, wanted two of their fore teeth.\" One of  them, who was supposed to be a chief, \"was painted with a circle of  white paste or pigment about his eyes, and a white streak down his nose,  from his forehead to the tip of it. And his breast, and some part of his  arms, were also made white with the same paint.\"    Neither bows nor arrows were observed amongst these people: they used  wooden lances, such as Dampier had before seen. He saw no houses at  either place, and believed they had none; but \"there were several things  like haycocks, standing in the savannah; which, at a distance, we thought  were houses, looking just like the Hottentots' houses at the Cape of Good  Hope; but we found them to be so many rocks.\" *    [* Dampier could not have examined these rocks closely; for there can be  little doubt that they were the ant hills described by Pelsert as being  \"so large., that they might have been taken for the houses of Indians.\"]    The land near the sea-coast is described as equally sandy with the parts  before visited, and producing, amongst its scanty vegetation, nothing for  food. No stream of fresh water was seen, nor could any, fit to drink, be  procured by digging.    Quitting this inhospitable shore, captain Dampier weighed his anchor on  September 5, with the intention of seeking water and refreshments further  on to the north-eastward. The shoals obliged him to keep at a  considerable distance from the land; and finally, when arrived at the  latitude 16 deg. 9', to give up his project, and direct his course for Timor.    CONCLUSIVE REMARKS.    With the voyage of Dampier terminates the information gained of the  Western Coasts, previously to the year 1801. Monsieur de _St. Alouarn_  had, indeed, seen some points or islands, in the year 1772, when he  commanded the French _flute Le Gros Ventre_; but the particulars are not  generally known, being, in all probability, of little importance.    The summary of the knowledge possessed by the public, and the objects to  which investigation might be usefully directed in these parts of Terra  Australis, were as follow. The outline of the north-west coast was known  upon the authority, as generally believed, of _Tasman_; with some points  corrected by _Dampier_. The accuracy of Tasman's chart was, however, very  much called in doubt: instead of being a continued shore, as the Dutch  chart represented it, Dampier found the southern parts of De Witt's Land  to consist of a range of islands. And he gives it as his opinion, that  the northern part of New Holland was separated from the lands to the  southward, by a strait; \"unless\", says he, \"the high tides and indraught  thereabout should be occasioned by the mouth of some large river; which  hath often low lands on each side of the outlet, and many islands and  shoals lying at its entrance: but I rather thought it a channel, or  strait, than a river.\" This opinion he supports by a fair induction from  facts; and the opening of _twelve miles wide_, seen near the same place  by Vlaming's two vessels, and in which they could find no anchorage,  strongly corroborated Dampier's supposition.    Later information had demonstrated, that the supposed strait could not  lead out into the Great Ocean, eastward, as the English navigator had  conjectured; but it was thought possible, that it might communicate with  the Gulph of Carpentaria, and even probable that a passage existed from  thence to the unknown part of the South Coast, beyond the Isles of St.  Francis and St. Peter.    But whether this opening were the "]]]
