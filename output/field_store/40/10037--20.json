Then he led her to the ship's side, steadied her descent  of the monkey-ladder, holding the child for her as she climbed to the  waiting boat below.  A moment later he had cut the rope that held the  small boat to the steamer's side, and, bending silently to the muffled  oars, was pulling toward the black shadows up the Ugambi River.    Anderssen rowed on as though quite sure of his ground, and when after  half an hour the moon broke through the clouds there was revealed upon  their left the mouth of a tributary running into the Ugambi.  Up this  narrow channel the Swede turned the prow of the small boat.    Jane Clayton wondered if the man knew where he was bound.   She did not  know that in his capacity as cook he had that day been rowed up this  very stream to a little village where he had bartered with the natives  for such provisions as they had for sale, and that he had there  arranged the details of his plan for the adventure upon which they were  now setting forth.    Even though the moon was full, the surface of the small river was quite  dark.  The giant trees overhung its narrow banks, meeting in a great  arch above the centre of the river.   Spanish moss dropped from the  gracefully bending limbs, and enormous creepers clambered in riotous  profusion from the ground to the loftiest branch, falling in curving  loops almost to the water's placid breast.    Now and then the river's surface would be suddenly broken ahead of them  by a huge crocodile, startled by the splashing of the oars, or,  snorting and blowing, a family of hippos would dive from a sandy bar to  the cool, safe depths of the bottom.    From the dense jungles upon either side came the weird night cries of  the carnivora--the maniacal voice of the hyena, the coughing grunt of  the panther, the deep and awful roar of the lion.  And with them  strange, uncanny notes that the girl could not ascribe to any  particular night prowler--more terrible because of their mystery.    Huddled in the stern of the boat she sat with her baby strained close  to her bosom, and because of that little tender, helpless thing she was  happier tonight than she had been for many a sorrow-ridden day.    Even though she knew not to what fate she was going, or how soon that  fate might overtake her, still was she happy and thankful for the  moment, however brief, that she might press her baby tightly in her  arms.  She could scarce wait for the coming of the day that she might  look again upon the bright face of her little, black-eyed Jack.    Again and again she tried to strain her eyes through the blackness of  the jungle night to have but a tiny peep at those beloved features, but  only the dim outline of the baby face rewarded her efforts.  Then once  more she would cuddle the warm, little bundle close to her throbbing  heart.    It must have been close to three o'clock in the morning that Anderssen  brought the boat's nose to the shore before a clearing where could be  dimly seen in the waning moonlight a cluster of native huts encircled  by a thorn boma.    At the village gate they were admitted by a native woman, the wife of  the chief whom Anderssen had paid to assist him.   She took them to the  chief's hut, but Anderssen said that they would sleep without upon the  ground, and so, her duty having been completed, she left them to their  own devices.    The Swede, after explaining in his gruff way that the huts were  doubtless filthy and vermin-ridden, spread Jane's blankets on the  ground for her, and at a little distance unrolled his own and lay down  to sleep.    It was some time before the girl could find a comfortable position upon  the hard ground, but at last, the baby in the hollow of her arm, she  dropped asleep from utter exhaustion.   When she awoke it was broad  daylight.    About her were clustered a score of curious natives--mostly men, for  among the aborigines it is the male who owns this characteristic in its  most exaggerated form.   Instinctively Jane Clayton drew the baby more  closely to her, though she soon saw that the blacks were far from  intending her or the child any harm.    In fact, one of them offered her a gourd of milk--a filthy,  smoke-begrimed gourd, with the ancient rind of long-curdled milk caked  in layers within its neck; but the spirit of the giver touched her  deeply, and her face lightened for a moment with one of those almost  forgotten smiles of radiance that had helped to make her beauty famous  both in Baltimore and London.    She took the gourd in one hand, and rather than cause the giver pain  raised it to her lips, though for the life of her she could scarce  restrain the qualm of nausea that surged through her as the malodorous  thing approached her nostrils.    It was Anderssen who came to her rescue, and taking the gourd from her,  drank a portion himself, and then returned it to the native with a gift  of blue beads.    The sun was shining brightly now, and though the baby still slept, Jane  could scarce restrain her impatient desire to have at least a brief  glance at the beloved face.  The natives had withdrawn at a command  from their chief, who now stood talking with Anderssen, a little apart  from her.    As she debated the wisdom of risking disturbing the child's slumber by  lifting the blanket that now protected its face from the sun, she noted  that the cook conversed with the chief in the language of the Negro.    What a remarkable man the fellow was, indeed!  She had thought him  ignorant and stupid but a short day before, and now, within the past  twenty-four hours, she had learned that he spoke not only English but  French as well, and the primitive dialect of the West Coast.    She had thought him shifty, cruel, and untrustworthy, yet in so far as  she had reason to believe he had proved himself in every way the  contrary since the day before.  It scarce seemed credible that he could  be serving her from motives purely chivalrous.  There must be something  deeper in his intentions and plans than he had yet disclosed.    She wondered, and when she looked at him--at his close-set, shifty eyes  and repulsive features, she shuddered, for she was convinced that no  lofty characteristics could be hid behind so foul an exterior.    As she was thinking of these things the while she debated the wisdom of  uncovering the baby's face, there came a little grunt from the wee  bundle in her lap, and then a gurgling coo that set her heart in  raptures.    The baby was awake!  Now she might feast her eyes upon him.    Quickly she snatched the blanket from before the infant's face;  Anderssen was looking at her as she did so.    He saw her stagger to her feet, holding the baby at arm's length from  her, her eyes glued in horror upon the little chubby face and twinkling  eyes.    Then he heard her piteous cry as her knees gave beneath her, and she  sank to the ground in a swoon.          Chapter 10    The Swede      As the warriors, clustered thick about Tarzan and Sheeta, realized that  it was a flesh-and-blood panther that had interrupted their dance of  death, they took heart a trifle, for in the face of all those circling  spears even the mighty Sheeta would be doomed.    Rokoff was urging the chief to have his spearmen launch their missiles,  and the black was upon the instant of issuing the command, when his  eyes strayed beyond Tarzan, following the gaze of the ape-man.    With a yell of terror the chief turned and fled toward the village  gate, and as his people looked to see the cause of his fright, they too  took to their heels--for there, lumbering down upon them, their huge  forms exaggerated by the play of moonlight and camp fire, came the  hideous apes of Akut.    The instant the natives turned to flee the ape-man's savage cry rang  out above the shrieks of the blacks, and in answer to it Sheeta and the  apes leaped growling after the fugitives.   Some of the warriors turned  to battle with their enraged antagonists, but before the fiendish  ferocity of the fierce beasts they went down to bloody death.    Others were dragged down in their flight, and it was not until the  village was empty and the last of the blacks had disappeared into the  bush that Tarzan was able to recall his savage pack to his side.  Then  it was that he discovered to his chagrin that he could not make one of  them, not even the comparatively intelligent Akut, understand that he  wished to be freed from the bonds that held him to the stake.    In time, of course, the idea would filter through their thick skulls,  but in the meanwhile many things might happen--the blacks might return  in force to regain their village; the whites might readily pick them  all off with their rifles from the surrounding trees; he might even  starve to death before the dull-witted apes realized that he wished  them to gnaw through his bonds.    As for Sheeta--the great cat understood even less than the apes; but  yet Tarzan could not but marvel at the remarkable characteristics this  beast had evidenced.  That it felt real affection for him there seemed  little doubt, for now that the blacks were disposed of it walked slowly  back and forth about the stake, rubbing its sides against the ape-man's  legs and purring like a contented tabby.  That it had gone of its own  volition to bring the balance of the pack to his rescue, Tarzan could  not doubt.  His Sheeta was indeed a jewel among beasts.    Mugambi's absence worried the ape-man not a little.   He attempted to  learn from Akut what had become of the black, fearing that the beasts,  freed from the restraint of Tarzan's presence, might have fallen upon"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8502"],[0,"Common Diseases of Farm Animals (#16)"],[1,"the hand and arm  into the uterus, and break down the attachments with the fingers. In the  larger animals, the use of the arm must not be interfered with by clothing.  Every possible precaution should be taken to prevent infection of the  genital organs with irritating germs. It is advisable in most cases to  flush out the womb with a one per cent water solution of liquor cresolis  compound after the removal of the fetal envelopes.    LEUCORRHOEA.--This is a chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane lining  the genital tract, that is associated with more or less of a discharge from  the vulva. It is common in animals that abort, or retain the \"after-birth.\"    The discharge may be white, sticky, albuminous, and without odor, or it may  be chocolate colored and foul smelling. The tail and hind parts are usually  soiled with it. In chronic inflammation of the womb the discharge is  intermittent. In mild cases the health of the animal is in no way impaired.  Sterility is common. Loss of appetite and unthriftiness occur in severe  cases.    _Treatment_.--Mild cases readily yield to treatment. This consists in  irrigating the maternal passages with a one-half per cent warm water  solution of liquor cresolis compound. This treatment should be repeated  daily and continued for as long a time as necessary.    MAMMITIS.--Inflammation of the mammary gland or udder is more common in the  cow than in any of the other domestic animals. In all animals it is most  frequently met with during the first few weeks after birth.    _A predisposing cause_ in the development of mammitis is a high development  of the mammary glands. The following _direct causes_ may be mentioned:  incomplete milking, or milking at irregular intervals; injury to the udder  by stepping on the teat; blows from the horns and pressure caused by lying  on a rough, uneven surface; chilling of the udder by draughts and lying on  frozen ground; and infection of the glandular tissue by _irritating germs_.  The latter cause produces the most serious, and, sometimes, a very  extensive inflammation. This form of inflammation may spread from one cow  to another, causing the milk to be unfit for food, and bringing about the  loss of one or more quarters of the udder.    _The symptoms_ occurring in the different forms of mammitis differ. The  inflammation may involve one or more of the glands, and may affect either  the glandular or the connective tissue. In some cases the gland may appear  congested for a few days before the inflammatory changes occur. The part  becomes hot, swollen, tender and reddened. It may feel doughy or hard. If  the connective tissue is involved (interstitial form), there is apt to be a  high body temperature, the udder may be much larger than normal, is tender  and pits on pressure. Loss of appetite usually accompanies this form of  mammitis. Very little or no milk is secreted. Sometimes, the milk is  greatly changed in appearance, is foul smelling and contains pus. In  congestion of the udder and rupture of the capillary vessels, the milk may  contain blood.    Mild inflammation of the udder responds readily to treatment. The  interstitial form may terminate in abscesses and gangrene. The replacement  of the glandular tissue by fibrous tissue in one or more quarters is not  uncommon. Death seldom occurs.    _The preventive treatment_ consists in avoiding conditions that may favor  or cause an inflammation of the gland. Animals that have highly developed  mammary glands should be fed a light diet just before and following  parturition. Following parturition, a dose of Epsom or Glauber's salts may  be given. If the young does not take all the milk, the udder should be  milked out as clean as possible. Massaging the udder by kneading or  stroking may be practised.    The following _treatment_ is recommended: The application of a thick  coating of antiphlogistin once or twice daily is a useful remedy. If the  udder becomes badly swollen, it should be supported with a bandage.  Extensive inflammation may be treated by the application of cold in the  form of packs of cracked ice. Irrigating the gland with a four per cent  water solution of boric acid is an important treatment for certain forms of  mammitis. Abscess formation or suppuration should be promptly treated by  opening and treating the abscesses. If gangrene occurs, it may be necessary  to remove a part, or the whole of the udder.    The giving of milk discolored with blood may be treated by applying  camphorated ointment twice daily.    SORE AND WARTY TEATS.--Irritation to the teats by filth, cold, moisture and  injuries cause the skin to become inflamed, sore and scabby.    _Preventive treatment_ is the most satisfactory. Sore teats may be treated  by applying the following ointment after each milking: vaseline ten parts  and oxide of zinc one part. Pendulous warts may be clipped off with a sharp  pair of scissors. Castor oil applied to the wart daily by rubbing may be  used for the removal of flat warts.    \"MILK-FEVER\" OR POST-PARTUM PARALYSIS.--This is a disease peculiar to cows,  especially heavy milkers that are in good condition. It most commonly  occurs after the third, fourth and fifth calving. The disease usually  appears within the first two or three days after calving, but it has been  known to occur before, and as late as several weeks after calving. The  cause is not certainly known. The Schmidt theory is that certain toxins are  formed in the udder, owing to the over activity of the cells of the  glandular tissue.    [Illustration: FIG. 20.--A case of milk-fever.]    _The symptoms_ are characteristic of the disease. At the very beginning of  the attack the cow stops eating and ruminating, becomes uneasy, switches  the tail, stamps the feet, trembles, staggers when forced to walk and  finally falls and is unable to get up. At first she may lie in a natural  position; later, as the paralytic symptoms become more pronounced, the head  is laid against the side of the body and the animal seems to be in a deep  sleep (Fig. 20). In the more severe form the cow lies on her side,  consciousness is lost and the paralysis of the muscles is marked. The  different body functions are interfered with; the urine is retained,  bloating occurs, respirations are slow, pulse weak and temperature  subnormal or normal.    _Preventive treatment_, such as feeding a spare diet during the latter  period of pregnancy, is not always advisable. Heavy milkers should be given  one-half pound of Glauber's salts a day or two before calving, and the dose  repeated when the cow becomes fresh. Cows affected with milk-fever seldom  die if treated promptly.    The _treatment_ consists in emptying the udder by milking and injecting air  or oxygen gas into the gland until it is completely distended (Fig. 21).  The milk-fever apparatus should be clean, and the air injected filtered.  Before introducing the milking tube into the milk duct, the udder should  first be washed with a disinfectant, and a clean towel laid on the floor  for the gland to rest on. After injecting the quarter, strips of muslin or  tape should be tied around the ends of the teats to prevent the escape of  the air. If the cow does not show indications of recovery in from four to  five hours, the treatment should be repeated.    [Illustration: FIG. 21.--Milk-fever apparatus: pump; filter; rubber tubing;  and milk tube.]    It is very necessary to give the cow a comfortable stall and protect her  from any kind of exposure. No bulky drenches should be administered. If she  lies stretched out, the fore parts should be raised by packing straw under  her. This is necessary in order to prevent pneumonia, caused by  regurgitated feed entering the air passages and lungs. It is very advisable  to give her the following mixture for a few days after the attack: tincture  of nux vomica two ounces, and alcohol six ounces. One ounce of this mixture  may be given four times daily in a little water.      QUESTIONS     1. Name the generative organs of the female.     2. Name the generative organs of the male.     3.

CHAPTER VIII    DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY APPARATUS      GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The respiratory apparatus may be divided into two  groups of organs, anterior and posterior. The anterior group, the  _nostrils, nasal cavities, pharynx, larynx_ and _trachea_, is situated in  the region of the head and neck. The posterior group, the _bronchial tubes_  and _lungs_, is situated in the chest or thoracic cavity.    _The nostrils_ are the anterior openings of the air passages. The nasal  cavities are situated in the anterior region of the head, and extend the  entire length of the face. Each cavity is divided into three long, narrow  passages by the two pairs of turbinated bones. The lining membrane is the  nasal mucous membrane, the lower two-thirds or respiratory portion  differing from the upper one-third"]]]
