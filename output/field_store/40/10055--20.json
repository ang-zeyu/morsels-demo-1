According to the  common understanding, the Danube had _seven_ mouths. So Strabo, Mela,  Ammian, and Ovid; Pliny makes six. T. reconciles the two accounts. The  _enim_ inserted after _septimum_ in most editions is not found in the  best mss. and is unnecessary. Or. & Rit. omit it.       II. _Ipsos_ marks the transition from the country to the people--_the  Germans themselves_. So A. 13: _Ipsi Britanni_.    _Crediderim_. Subj. attice. A modest way of expressing his opinion, like  our: I should say, I am inclined to think. H. 486, I. 3; Z. 527.    _Adventibus et hospitiis. Immigrants and visitors. Adventibus_ certae  sedes, _hospitiis_ preregrinationes significantur. Gün. Both abstract for  concrete. Död. compares [Greek: epoikoi] and [Greek: metoikoi].    _Terra--advehebantur_. Zeugma for _terra adveniebant_, classibus  advehebantur. H. 704, I. 2; Z. 775.    _Nec--et_. These correlatives connect the members more closely than  et--et; as in Greek oute-te. The sentiment here advanced touching  colonization (as by sea, rather than by land), though true of Carthage,  Sicily, and most _Grecian_, colonies, is directly the reverse of the  general fact; and Germany itself is now known to have received its  population by land emigration, from western Asia. The Germans, as we  learn from affinities of languages and occasional references of  historians and geographers, belonged to the same great stock of the human  family with the Goths and Scythians, and may be traced back to that hive  of nations, that primitive residence of mankind, the country east and  south of the Caspian Sea and in the vicinity of Mount Ararat: cf. Tur.  His. Ang. Sax. B. II. C. 1; also Donaldson's New Cratylus, B. I. Chap. 4.  Latham's dogmatic skepticism will hardly shake the now established faith  on this subject. The science of ethnography was unknown to the ancients.  Tacitus had not the remotest idea, that all mankind were sprung from a  common ancestry, and diffused themselves over the world from a common  centre, a fact asserted in the Scriptures, and daily receiving fresh  confirmation from literature and science. Hence he speaks of the Germans  as _indigenas_, which he explains below by _editum terra_, sprung from  the earth, like the mutum et turpe pecus of Hor. Sat. 1. 3, 100. cf.  A. 11.    _Mutare quaerebant. Quaerere_ with inf. is poet. constr., found, however,  in later prose writers, and once in Cic. (de Fin. 313: quaeris scire,  enclosed in brackets in Tauchnitz's edition), to avoid repetition of  _cupio_. _Cupio_ or _volo mutare_ would be regular classic prose.    _Adversus_. That the author here uses _adversus_ in some unusual and  recondite sense, is intimated by the clause: _ut sic dixerim_. It is  understood by some, of a sea _unfriendly to navigation_. But its  connexion by _que_ with _immensus ultra_, shows that it refers to  _position_, and means _lying opposite_, i.e., belonging, as it were, to  another hemisphere or world from ours; for so the Romans regarded the  Northern Ocean and Britain itself, cf. A 12: ultra _nostri orbis_  mensuram; G. 17: _exterior_ oceanus. So Cic. (Som. Scip. 6.) says:  Homines partim obliquos, partim aversos, partim etiam _adversos_, stare  vobis. This interpretation is confirmed by _ab orbe nostra_ in the  antithesis. On the use of _ut sic dixerim_ for _ut sic dicam_, which is  peculiar to the silver age, see Z. 528.    _Asia_, sc. Minor. _Africa_, sc. the Roman Province of that name,  comprising the territory of Carthage.--_Peteret_. The question implies a  negative answer, cf. Z. 530. The subj. implies a protasis understood: if  he could, or the like. H. 502.    _Sit_. Praesens, ut de re vera. Gün. _Nisi si_ is nearly equivalent to  _nisi forte: unless perchance_; unless if we may suppose the case. Cf.  Wr. note on Ann. 2, 63, and Hand's Tursellinus, 3, 240.    _Memoriae et annalium_. Properly opposed to each other as _tradition_ and  _written history_, though we are not to infer that written books existed  in Germany in the age of Tacitus.    _Carminibus_. _Songs, ballads_ (from cano). Songs and rude poetry have  been, in all savage countries, the memorials of public transactions,  e.g. the runes of the Goths, the bards of the Britons and Celts, the  scalds of Scandinavia, &c.    _Tuisconem_. The god from whom Tuesday takes its name, as Wednesday from  Woden, Thursday from Thor, &c., cf. Sharon Turner's His. of Ang. Sax.  app. to book 2. chap. 3. Some find in the name of this god the root of  the words Teutonic, Dutch (Germ. Deutsche or Teutsche &c.,) Al. Tuistonem,  Tristonem, &c. More likely it has the same root as the Latin divus,  dius, deus, and the Greek theios, dios, theos, cf. Grimm's _Deutsche  Mythologie_, sub v.    _Terra editum==indigena_ above; and gaegenaes and autochthon in Greek.    _Originem_==auctores. It is predicate after _Mannum_.    _Ut in licentia vetustatis. As in the license of antiquity_, i.e. since  such license is allowed in regard to ancient times.    _Ingaevones_. \"According to some German antiquaries, the _Ingaevones_ are  die _Einwohner_, those dwelling inwards towards the sea; the _Istaevones_  are die _Westwohner_, the inhabitants of the western parts; and the  _Hermiones_ are the _Herumwohner_, midland inhabitants,\" Ky. cf.  Kiessling in loc. Others, e.g. Zeuss and Grimm, with more probability,  find in these names the roots of German words significant of _honor_  and _bravery_, assumed by different tribes or confederacies as epithets  or titles of distinction. Grimm identifies these three divisions with  the Franks, Saxons, and Thuringians of a later age. See further, note  chap. 27.    _Vocentur_. The subj. expresses the opinion of others, not the direct  affirmation of the author. H. 529; Z. 549.    _Deo_==hoc deo, sc. Mannus--Germ. Mann, Eng. Man.    _Marsos, Gambrivios_. Under the names of Franci and Salii these tribes  afterwards became formidable to the Romans. Cf. Prichard's Researches  into the Physical History of Mankind, Vol. III. chap. 6, sec. 2.--  _Suevos_, cf. note, 38.--_Vandalios_. The Vandals, now so familiar in  history.    _Additum_, sc. esse, depending on _affirmant_.    _Nunc Tungri_, sc. vocentur, cf. His. 4, 15, 16. In confirmation of the  historical accuracy of this passage, Gr. remarks, that Caes. (B.G. 2, 4)  does not mention the Tungri, but names four tribes on the left bank of  the Rhine, who, he says, are called by the common name of _Germans_;  while Pliny (Nat. His. 4, 31), a century later, gives not the names of  these four tribes, but calls them by the new name _Tungri_.    _Ita--vocarentur_. Locus vexatissimus! exclaim all the critics. And so  they set themselves to amend the text by conjecture. Some have written  _in nomen gentis_ instead of _non gentis_. Others have proposed _a  victorum metu_, or _a victo ob metum_, or _a victis ob metum_. But these  emendations are wholly conjectural and unnecessary. Günther and Walch  render _a victore, from_ the victorious tribe, i.e. _after the name of_  that tribe. But _a se ipsis_ means _by_ themselves; and the antithesis  doubtless requires _a_ to be understood in the same sense in both  clauses. Grüber translates and explains thus: \"In this way the name of a  single tribe, and not of the whole people, has come into use, so that  all, at first by the victor (the Tungri), in order to inspire fear, then  by themselves (by the mouth of the whole people), when once the name  became known, were called by the name of Germans. That is, the Tungri  called all the kindred tribes that dwelt beyond the Rhine, Germans, in  order to inspire fear by the wide extension of the name, since they gave  themselves out to be a part of so vast a people; but at length all the  tribes began to call themselves by this name, probably because they were  pleased to see the fear which it excited.\" This is, on the whole, the  most satisfactory explanation of the passage, and meets the essential  concurrence of Wr., Or. and Död.--_Germani_. If of German etymology,  this word==gehr or wehr (Fr. guerre) and mann, _men of war_; hence the  _metus_, which the name carried with it. If it is a Latin word  corresponding only in _sense_ with the original German, then==_brethren_.  It will be seen, that either etymology would accord with Grüber's  explanation of the whole passage--in either case, the name would  inspire fear. The latter, however, is the more probable, cf. Ritter in  loc. A people often bear quite different names abroad from that by which  they call themselves at home. Thus the people, whom we call _Germans_,  call themselves _Deutsche_ (Dutch), and are called by the French  _Allemands_, cf. Latham. _Vocarentur_ is subj. because it stands in a  subordinate clause of the oratio obliqua, cf. H. 531; Z. 603.    _Metum_. Here taken in an _active_ sense; oftener passive, but used in  both senses. Quintilian speaks of _metum duplicem_, quem patimur et quem  facimus (6, 2, 21). cf. A. 44: nihil metus in vultu, i.e., nothing to  inspire fear in his countenance. In like manner admiratio (§ 7) is used  for the admiration which one excites, though it usually denotes the  admiration which one feels. For _ob_, cf. Ann. 1, 79: _ob moderandas  Tiberis exundationes_.    _Nationis--gentis. Gens_ is often used by T. as a synonym with _natio_.  But in antithesis, _gens_ is the whole, of which _nationes_ or _populi_  are the parts, e.g. G. 4: populos--gentem; § 14: nationes--genti. In  like manner, in the civil constitution of Rome, a _gens_ included several  related _families_.      III. _Herculem_. That is, Romana interpretatione, cf. § 34. The Romans  found _their_ gods everywhere, and ascribed to Hercules, quidquid ubique  magnificum est, cf. note 34: _quicquid--consensimus_. That this is a  Roman account of the matter is evident, from the use of _eos_, for if  the Germans were the subject of _memorant_, _se_ must have been used. On  the use of _et_ here, cf. note 11.  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9097"],[0,"Robert's Rules of Order (#16)"],[1,"the committee make their report, some one moves  \"That the report of the committee be accepted and that the officers  nominated be declared the officers of this convention.\"* [Where there is  any competition for the offices, it is better that they be elected by  ballot.  In this case, when the nominating committee report, a motion  can be made as follows:  \"I move that the convention now proceed to  ballot for its permanent officers;\" or \"I move that we now proceed to  the election, by ballot, of the permanent officers of this convention.\"  [See Rules of Order, Sec. 38, for balloting, and other methods of voting.]  The constitutions of permanent societies usually provide that the  officers shall be elected by ballot.] This motion being carried, the  chairman declares the officers elected, and instantly calls the new  presiding officer to the chair, and the temporary secretary is at the  same time replaced.  The convention is now organized for work.    48. A Permanent Society.  (a) First Meeting.  When it is desired to  form a permanent society, those interested in it should see that only  the proper persons are invited to be present, at a certain time and  place.  It is not usual in mass meetings, or meetings called to organize  a society, to commence until    === Page 109 ===========================================================    fifteen or thirty minutes after the appointed time, when some one steps  forward and says, \"The meeting will please come to order; I move that  Mr. A. act as chairman of this meeting;\" some one \"seconds the motion,\"  when the one who made the motion puts it to vote (or, as it is called,  \"puts the question\"), as already described, under an \"occasional  meeting\" [Sec. 46, (a)]; and, as in that case, when the chairman is  elected, he announces as the first business in order the election of a  secretary.    After the secretary is elected, the chairman calls on some member who is  most interested in getting up the society, to state the object of the  meeting.  When this member rises he says, \"Mr. Chairman;\" the chairman  then announces his name, when the member proceeds to state the object of  the meeting.  Having finished his remarks, the chairman may call on  other members to give their opinions upon the subject, and sometimes a  particular speaker is called out by members who wish to hear him.  The  chairman should observe the wishes of the assembly, and while being  careful not to be too strict, he must not permit any one to occupy too  much time and weary the meeting.    When a sufficient time has been spent in this    === Page 110 ===========================================================    informal way, some one should offer a resolution, so that definite  action can be taken.  Those interested in getting up the meeting, if it  is to be a large one, should have previously agreed upon what is to be  done, and be prepared at the proper time to offer a suitable resolution,  which may be in a form similar to this:  \"Resolved, That it is the sense  of this meeting that a society for [state the object of the society]  should now be formed in this city.\"  This resolution, when seconded, and  stated by the chairman, would be open to debate and be treated as  already described [Sec. 46, (b)].  This preliminary motion could have been  offered at the commencement of the meeting, and if the meeting is a very  large one, this would probably be better than to have the informal  discussion.    After this preliminary motion has been voted on, or even without waiting  for such motion, one like this can be offered:  \"I move that a committee  of five be appointed by the Chair, to draft a Constitution and By-Laws  for a society for [here state the object], and that they report at an  adjourned meeting of this assembly.\"  This motion can be amended [Sec. 56]  by striking out and adding words, etc., and it is debatable.    === Page 111 ===========================================================    When this committee is appointed, the chairman may inquire, \"Is there  any other business to be attended to?\" or, \"What is the further pleasure  of the meeting?\"  When all business is finished, a motion can be made to  adjourn to meet at a certain place and time, which, when seconded, and  stated by the Chair, is open to debate and amendment.  It is usually  better to fix the time of the next meeting [see Sec. 63] at an earlier  stage of the meeting, and then, when it is desired to close the meeting,  move simply \"to adjourn,\" which cannot be amended or debated.  When this  motion is carried, the chairman says, \"This meeting stands adjourned to  meet at,\" etc., specifying the time and place of the next meeting.    (b) Second Meeting.* [Ordinary meetings of a society are conducted like  this second meeting, the chairman, however, announcing the business in  the order prescribed by the rules of the society [Sec. 72].  For example,  after the minutes are read and approved, he would say, \"The next  business in order is hearing reports from the standing committees.\"  He  may then call upon each committee in their order, for a report, thus:  \"Has the committee on applications for membership any report to make?\"  In which case the committee may report, as shown above, or some member  of it reply that they have no report to make.  Or, when the chairman  knows that there are but few if any reports to make, it is better, after  making the announcement of the business, for him to ask, \"Have these  committees any reports to make?\"  After a short pause, if no one rises  to report, he states, \"There being no reports from the standing  committees, the next business in order is hearing the reports of select  committees,\" when he will act the same as in the case of the standing  committees.  The chairman should always have a list of the committees,  to enable him to call upon them, as well as to guide him in the  appointment of new committees.] At the next meeting the officers of the  previous meeting, if present, serve until the permanent officers are  elected.  When the hour arrives for the meeting, the chairman standing,  says, \"The meeting will    === Page 112 ===========================================================    please come to order:\"  as soon as the assembly is seated, he adds, \"The  secretary will read the minutes of the last meeting.\"  If any one  notices an error in the minutes, he can state the fact as soon as the  secretary finishes reading them; if there is no objection, without  waiting for a motion, the chairman directs the secretary to make the  correction.  The chairman then says, \"If there is no objection the  minutes will stand approved as read\" [or \"corrected,\" if any corrections  have been made].    He announces as the next business in order, \"the hearing of the report  of the committee on the Constitution and By-Laws.\"  The chairman of the  committee, after addressing \"Mr. Chairman\" and being recognized, reads  the committee's report and then hands it to the chairman.* [In large and  formal bodies the chairman, before inquiring what is to be done with the  report, usually directs the secretary to read it again.  See note to Sec.  46 (c), for a few common errors in acting upon reports of committees.  [See also note to Sec. 46 (b).]] If no motion is made, the chairman says,  \"You have heard the report read --    === Page 113 ===========================================================    what order shall be taken upon it?\"  Or simply inquires, \"What shall be  done with the report?\"  Some one moves its adoption, or still better,  moves \"the adoption of the Constitution reported by the committee,\" and  when seconded, the chairman says, \"The question is on the adoption of  the Constitution reported by the committee.\"  He then reads the first  article of the Constitution, and asks, \"Are there any amendments  proposed to this article?\"  If none are offered, after a pause, he reads  the next article and asks the same question, and proceeds thus until he  reads the last article, when he says, \"The whole Constitution having  been read, it is open to amendment.\"  Now any one can move amendments to  any part of the Constitution.    When the chairman thinks it has been modified to suit the wishes of the  assembly, he inquires, \"Are you ready for the question?\"  If no one  wishes to speak, he puts the question, \"As many as are in favor of  adopting the Constitution as amended, will say aye;\" and then, \"As many  as are opposed, will say no.\"  He distinctly announces the result of the  vote, which should always be done.  If the articles of the Constitution  are subdivided into sections    === Page 114 ===========================================================    or paragraphs, then the amendments should be made by sections or  paragraphs, instead of by articles.    The chairman now states that the Constitution having been adopted, it  will be necessary for those wishing to become members to sign it (and  pay the initiation fee, if required by the Constitution), and suggests,  if the assembly is a large one, that a recess be taken for the purpose.  A motion is then made to take a recess for say ten minutes, or until the  Constitution is signed.  The constitution being signed, no one is  permitted to vote excepting those who have signed it.    The recess having expired, the chairman calls the meeting to order and  says, \"The next business in order is the adoption of By-Laws.\"  Some one  moves the adoption of the By-Laws reported by the committee, and they  are treated just like the Constitution.  The chairman then asks, \"What  is the further pleasure of the meeting?\" or states that the next  business in order is the election of the permanent officers of the  society.  In either case some one moves the appointment of a committee  to nominate the permanent officers of the society, which motion is  treated as already described in Sec. 47.  As    === Page 115 ================================================"]]]
