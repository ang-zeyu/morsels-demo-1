At any rate, one of the points to which he recurs frequently in  his notes is to exhort himself to make his own service a continual  contrast to the Attorney's--\"to have in mind and use the Attorney's  weakness,\" enumerating a list of instances: \"Too full of cases and  distinctions. Nibbling solemnly, he distinguisheth but apprehends not;\"  \"No gift with his pen in proclamations and the like;\" and at last he  draws out in a series of epigrams his view of \"Hubbard's  disadvantages\"--         \"Better at shift than at drift.... _Subtilitas sine acrimonia_....       No power with the judge.... He will alter a thing but not mend....       He puts into patents and deeds words not of law but of common sense       and discourse.... Sociable save in profit.... He doth depopulate       mine office; otherwise called inclose.... I never knew any one of       so good a speech with a worse pen.\" ...    Then in a marginal note--\"Solemn goose. Stately, leastwise nodd (?)  crafty. They have made him believe that he is wondrous wise.\" And,  finally, he draws up a paper of counsels and rules for his own  conduct--\"_Custumae aptae ad Individuum_\"--which might supply an outline  for an essay on the arts of behaviour proper for a rising official, a  sequel to the biting irony of the essays on _Cunning_ and _Wisdom for a  Man's Self_.         \"To furnish my L. of S. with ornaments for public speeches. To make       him think how he should be reverenced by a Lord Chancellor, if I       were; Princelike.         \"To prepare him for matters to be handled in Council or before the       King aforehand, and to show him and yield him the fruits of my       care.         \"To take notes in tables, when I attend the Council, and sometimes       to move out of a memorial shewed and seen. To have particular       occasions, fit and graceful and continual, to maintain private       speech with every the great persons, and sometimes drawing more       than one together. _Ex imitatione Att._ This specially in public       places, and without care or affectation.

Not to fall upon the main too sudden, but to induce and       intermingle speech of good fashion. To use at once upon entrance       given of speech, though abrupt, to compose and draw in myself. To       free myself at once from payt. (?) of formality and compliment,       though with some show of carelessness, pride, and rudeness.\"         (And then follows a long list of matters of business to be attended       to.)    These arts of a court were not new; it was not new for men to observe  them in their neighbours and rivals. What was new was the writing them  down, with deliberate candour, among a man's private memoranda, as  things to be done and with the intention of practising them. This of  itself, it has been suggested, shows that they were unfamiliar and  uncongenial to Bacon; for a man reminds himself of what he is apt to  forget. But a man reminds himself also of what seems to him, at the  moment, most important, and what he lays most stress upon. And it is  clear that these are the rules, rhetorical and ethical, which Bacon laid  down for himself in pursuing the second great object of his life--his  official advancement; and that, whatever we think of them, they were the  means which he deliberately approved.    As long as Salisbury lived, the distrust which had kept Bacon so long in  the shade kept him at a distance from the King's ear, and from influence  on his counsels. Salisbury was the one Englishman in whom the King had  become accustomed to confide, in his own conscious strangeness to  English ways and real dislike and suspicion of them; Salisbury had an  authority which no one else had, both from his relations with James at  the end of Elizabeth's reign, and as the representative of her policy  and the depositary of its traditions; and if he had lived, things might  not, perhaps, have been better in James's government, but many things,  probably, would have been different. But while Salisbury was supreme,  Bacon, though very alert and zealous, was mainly busied with his  official work; and the Solicitor's place had become, as he says, a \"mean  thing\" compared with the Attorney's, and also an extremely laborious  place--\"one of the painfullest places in the kingdom.\" Much of it was  routine, but responsible and fatiguing routine. But if he was not in  Salisbury's confidence, he was prominent in the House of Commons. The  great and pressing subject of the time was the increasing difficulties  of the revenue, created partly by the inevitable changes of a growing  state, but much more by the King's incorrigible wastefulness. It was  impossible to realise completely the great dream and longing of the  Stuart kings and their ministers to make the Crown independent of  parliamentary supplies; but to dispense with these supplies as much as  possible, and to make as much as possible of the revenue permanent, was  the continued and fatal policy of the Court. The \"Great Contract\"--a  scheme by which, in return for the surrender by the Crown of certain  burdensome and dangerous claims of the Prerogative, the Commons were to  assure a large compensating yearly income to the Crown--was Salisbury's  favourite device during the last two years of his life. It was not a  prosperous one. The bargain was an ill-imagined and not very decorous  transaction between the King and his people. Both parties were naturally  jealous of one another, suspicious of underhand dealing and tacit  changes of terms, prompt to resent and take offence, and not easy to  pacify when they thought advantage had been taken; and Salisbury, either  by his own fault, or by yielding to the King's canny shiftiness, gave  the business a more haggling and huckstering look than it need have had.  Bacon, a subordinate of the Government, but a very important person in  the Commons, did his part, loyally, as it seems, and skilfully in  smoothing differences and keeping awkward questions from making their  appearance. Thus he tried to stave off the risk of bringing definitely  to a point the King's cherished claim to levy \"impositions,\" or custom  duties, on merchandise, by virtue of his prerogative--a claim which he  warned the Commons not to dispute, and which Bacon, maintaining it as  legal in theory, did his best to prevent them from discussing, and to  persuade them to be content with restraining. Whatever he thought of the  \"Great Contract,\" he did what was expected of him in trying to gain for  it fair play. But he made time for other things also. He advised, and  advised soundly, on the plantation and finance of Ireland. It was a  subject in which he took deep interest. A few years later, with only  too sure a foresight, he gave the warning, \"lest Ireland civil become  more dangerous to us than Ireland savage.\" He advised--not soundly in  point of law, but curiously in accordance with modern notions--about  endowments; though, in this instance, in the famous will case of Thomas  Sutton, the founder of the Charter House, his argument probably covered  the scheme of a monstrous job in favour of the needy Court. And his own  work went on in spite of the pressure of the Solicitor's place. To the  first years of his official life belong three very interesting  fragments, intended to find a provisional place in the plan of the  \"Great Instauration.\" To his friend Toby Matthews, at Florence, he sent  in manuscript the great attack on the old teachers of knowledge, which  is perhaps the most brilliant, and also the most insolently unjust and  unthinking piece of rhetoric ever composed by him--the _Redargutio  Philosophiarum_.         \"I send you at this time the only part which hath any harshness;       and yet I framed to myself an opinion, that whosoever allowed well       of that preface which you so much commend, will not dislike, or at       least ought not to dislike, this other speech of preparation; for       it is written out of the same spirit, and out of the same       necessity. Nay it doth more fully lay open that the question       between me and the ancients is not of the virtue of the race, but       of the rightness of the way. And to speak truth, it is to the other       but as _palma_ to _pugnus_, part of the same thing more large....       Myself am like the miller of Huntingdon, that was wont to pray for       peace amongst the willows; for while the winds blew, the wind-mills       wrought, and the water-mill was less customed. So I see that       controversies of religion must hinder the advancement of sciences.       Let me conclude with my perpetual wish towards yourself, that the       approbation of yourself by your own discreet and temperate       carriage, may restore you to your country, and your friends to your       society. And so I commend you to God's goodness.         \"Gray's Inn, this 10th of October, 1609.\"    To Bishop Andrewes he sent, also in manuscript, another piece,  belonging to the same plan--the deeply impressive treatise called _Visa  et Cogitata_--what Francis Bacon had seen of nature and knowledge, and  what he had come by meditation to think of what he had seen. The letter  is not less interesting than the last, in respect to the writer's  purposes, his manner of writing, and his relations to his correspondent.         \"MY VERY GOOD LORD,--Now your Lordship hath been so long in the       church and the palace disputing between kings and popes, methinks       you should take pleasure to look into the field, and refresh your       mind with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13893"],[0,"Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents: William McKinley; (#17)"],[1,"since our occupation and give to the people security in  life and property and encouragement under a just and beneficent rule.    As soon as we are in possession of Cuba and have pacified the island  it will be necessary to give aid and direction to its people to form  a government for themselves. This should be undertaken at the earliest  moment consistent with safety and assured success. It is important that  our relations with this people shall be of the most friendly character  and our commercial relations close and reciprocal. It should be our  duty to assist in every proper way to build up the waste places of the  island, encourage the industry of the people, and assist them to form a  government which shall be free and independent, thus realizing the best  aspirations of the Cuban people.    Spanish rule must be replaced by a just, benevolent, and humane  government, created by the people of Cuba, capable of performing all  international obligations, and which shall encourage thrift, industry,  and prosperity and promote peace and good will among all of the  inhabitants, whatever may have been their relations in the past. Neither  revenge nor passion should have a place in the new government. Until  there is complete tranquillity in the island and a stable government  inaugurated military occupation will be continued.    With the one exception of the rupture with Spain, the intercourse of  the United States with the great family of nations has been marked with  cordiality, and the close of the eventful year finds most of the issues  that necessarily arise in the complex relations of sovereign states  adjusted or presenting no serious obstacle to a just and honorable  solution by amicable agreement.    A long unsettled dispute as to the extended boundary between the  Argentine Republic and Chile, stretching along the Andean crests from  the southern border of the Atacama Desert to Magellan Straits, nearly a  third of the length of the South American continent, assumed an acute  stage in the early part of the year, and afforded to this Government  occasion to express the hope that the resort to arbitration, already  contemplated by existing conventions between the parties, might prevail  despite the grave difficulties arising in its application. I am happy to  say that arrangements to this end have been perfected, the questions of  fact upon which the respective commissioners were unable to agree being  in course of reference to Her Britannic Majesty for determination.  A residual difference touching the northern boundary line across the  Atacama Desert, for which existing treaties provided no adequate  adjustment, bids fair to be settled in like manner by a joint  commission, upon which the United States minister at Buenos Ayres has  been invited to serve as umpire in the last resort.    I have found occasion to approach the Argentine Government with a view  to removing differences of rate charges imposed upon the cables of an  American corporation in the transmission between Buenos Ayres and the  cities of Uruguay and Brazil of through messages passing from and  to the United States. Although the matter is complicated by exclusive  concessions by Uruguay and Brazil to foreign companies, there is strong  hope that a good understanding will be reached and that the important  channels of commercial communication between the United States and the  Atlantic cities of South America may be freed from an almost prohibitory  discrimination.    In this relation I may be permitted to express my sense of the fitness  of an international agreement whereby the interchange of messages over  connecting cables may be regulated on a fair basis of uniformity.  The world has seen the postal system developed from a congeries of  independent and exclusive services into a well-ordered union, of which  all countries enjoy the manifold benefits. It would be strange were the  nations not in time brought to realize that modern civilization, which  owes so much of its progress to the annihilation of space by the  electric force, demands that this all-important means of communication  be a heritage of all peoples, to be administered and regulated in their  common behoof. A step in this direction was taken when the international  convention of 1884 for the protection of submarine cables was signed,  and the day is, I trust, not far distant when this medium for the  transmission of thought from land to land may be brought within the  domain of international concert as completely as is the material  carriage of commerce and correspondence upon the face of the waters  that divide them.    The claim of Thomas Jefferson Page against Argentina, which has been  pending many years, has been adjusted. The sum awarded by the Congress  of Argentina was $4,242.35.    The sympathy of the American people has justly been offered to the ruler  and the people of Austria-Hungary by reason of the affliction that has  lately befallen them in the assassination of the Empress-Queen of that  historic realm.    On the 10th of September, 1897, a conflict took place at Lattimer, Pa.,  between a body of striking miners and the sheriff of Luzerne County and  his deputies, in which 22 miners were killed and 44 wounded, of whom  10 of the killed and 12 of the wounded were Austrian and Hungarian  subjects. This deplorable event naturally aroused the solicitude of the  Austro-Hungarian Government, which, on the assumption that the killing  and wounding involved the unjustifiable misuse of authority, claimed  reparation for the sufferers. Apart from the searching investigation and  peremptory action of the authorities of Pennsylvania, the Federal  Executive took appropriate steps to learn the merits of the case, in  order to be in a position to meet the urgent complaint of a friendly  power. The sheriff and his deputies, having been indicted for murder,  were tried, and acquitted, after protracted proceedings and the hearing  of hundreds of witnesses, on the ground that the killing was in the line  of their official duty to uphold law and preserve public order in the  State. A representative of the Department of Justice attended the trial  and reported its course fully. With all the facts in its possession,  this Government expects to reach a harmonious understanding on the  subject with that of Austria-Hungary, notwithstanding the renewed claim  of the latter, after learning the result of the trial, for indemnity for  its injured subjects.    Despite the brief time allotted for preparation, the exhibits of this  country at the Universal Exposition at Brussels in 1897 enjoyed the  singular distinction of a larger proportion of awards, having regard  to the number and classes of articles entered than those of other  countries. The worth of such a result in making known our national  capacity to supply the world's markets is obvious.    Exhibitions of this international character are becoming more frequent  as the exchanges of commercial countries grow more intimate and varied.  Hardly a year passes that this Government is not invited to national  participation at some important foreign center, but often on too short  notice to permit of recourse to Congress for the power and means to do  so. My predecessors have suggested the advisability of providing by  a general enactment and a standing appropriation for accepting such  invitations and for representation of this country by a commission.  This plan has my cordial approval.    I trust that the Belgian restrictions on the importation of cattle from  the United States, originally adopted as a sanitary precaution, will at  an early day be relaxed as to their present features of hardship and  discrimination, so as to admit live cattle under due regulation of their  slaughter after landing. I am hopeful, too, of favorable change in  the Belgian treatment of our preserved and salted meats. The growth  of direct trade between the two countries, not alone for Belgian  consumption and Belgian products, but by way of transit from and to  other continental states, has been both encouraging and beneficial. No  effort will be spared to enlarge its advantages by seeking the removal  of needless impediments and by arrangements for increased commercial  exchanges.    The year's events in Central America deserve more than passing mention.    A menacing rupture between Costa Rica and Nicaragua was happily composed  by the signature of a convention between the parties, with the  concurrence of the Guatemalan representative as a mediator, the act  being negotiated and signed on board the United States steamer  _Alert_, then lying in Central American waters. It is believed that  the good offices of our envoy and of the commander of that vessel  contributed toward this gratifying outcome.    In my last annual message the situation was presented with respect to  the diplomatic representation of this Government in Central America  created by the association of Nicaragua, Honduras, and Salvador under  the title of the Greater Republic of Central America, and the delegation  of their international functions to the Diet thereof. While the  representative character of the Diet was recognized by my predecessor  and has been confirmed during my Administration by receiving its  accredited envoy and granting exequaturs to consuls commissioned under  its authority, that recognition was qualified by the distinct  understanding that the responsibility of each of the component sovereign  Republics toward the United States remained wholly unaffected.    This proviso was needful inasmuch as the compact of the three  Republics was at the outset an association whereby certain  representative functions were delegated to a tripartite commission  rather than a federation possessing centralized powers of government  and administration. In this view of their relation and of the  relation of the United States to the several Republics, a change  in the"]]]
