This indefatigable naturalist ranged through  the East, under a royal commission, in quest of botanical knowledge;  and during his stay in the Western regions has sent over to Europe from  twenty to twenty-five thousand specimens in botany and zoology. La  Gabrielle is on a far-extending range of woody hills. Figure to  yourself a hill in the shape of a bowl reversed, with the buildings on  the top of it, and you will have an idea of the appearance of La  Gabrielle. You approach the house through a noble avenue, five hundred  toises long, of the choicest tropical fruit-trees, planted with the  greatest care and judgment; and should you chance to stray through it,  after sunset, when the clove-trees are in blossom, you would fancy  yourself in the Idalian groves or near the banks of the Nile, where  they were burning the finest incense as the queen of Egypt passed.    On La Gabrielle there are twenty-two thousand clove-trees in full  bearing. They are planted thirty feet asunder. Their lower branches  touch the ground. In general the trees are topped at five and twenty  feet high, though you will see some here towering up above sixty. The  black pepper, the cinnamon and nutmeg are also in great abundance here,  and very productive.    While the stranger views the spicy groves of La Gabrielle, and tastes  the most delicious fruits which have been originally imported hither  from all parts of the tropical world, he will thank the Government  which has supported, and admire the talents of the gentleman who has  raised to its present grandeur, this noble collection of useful fruits.  There is a large nursery attached to La Gabrielle where plants of all  the different species are raised and distributed gratis to those  colonists who wish to cultivate them.    Not far from the banks of the River Oyapoc, to windward of Cayenne, is  a mountain which contains an immense cavern. Here the cock-of-the-rock  is plentiful. He is about the size of a fantail pigeon, his colour a  bright orange and his wings and tail appear as though fringed; his head  is ornamented with a superb double-feathery crest edged with purple. He  passes the day amid gloomy damps and silence, and only issues out for  food a short time at sunrise and sunset. He is of the gallinaceous  tribe. The South-American Spaniards call him \"Gallo del Rio Negro\"  (Cock of the Black River), and suppose that he is only to be met with  in the vicinity of that far-inland stream; but he is common in the  interior of Demerara, amongst the huge rocks in the forests of  Macoushia, and he has been shot south of the line, in the captainship  of Para.    The bird called by Buffon grand gobe-mouche has never been found in  Demerara, although very common in Cayenne. He is not quite so large as  the jackdaw, and is entirely black, except a large spot under the  throat, which is a glossy purple.    You may easily sail from Cayenne to the River Surinam in two days. Its  capital, Paramaribo, is handsome, rich and populous: hitherto it has  been considered by far the finest town in Guiana, but probably the time  is not far off when the capital of Demerara may claim the prize of  superiority. You may enter a creek above Paramaribo and travel through  the interior of Surinam till you come to the Nicari, which is close to  the large River Coryntin. When you have passed this river there is a  good public road to New Amsterdam, the capital of Berbice.    On viewing New Amsterdam, it will immediately strike you that something  or other has intervened to prevent its arriving at that state of wealth  and consequence for which its original plan shows it was once intended.  What has caused this stop in its progress to the rank of a fine and  populous city remains for those to find out who are interested in it;  certain it is that New Amsterdam has been languid for some years, and  now the tide of commerce seems ebbing fast from the shores of Berbice.    Gay and blooming is the sister colony of Demerara. Perhaps, kind  reader, thou hast not forgot that it was from Stabroek, the capital of  Demerara, that the adventurer set out, some years ago, to reach the  Portuguese frontier-fort and collect the wourali poison. It was not  intended, when this second sally was planned in England, to have  visited Stabroek again by the route here described. The plan was to  have ascended the Amazons from Para and got into the Rio Negro, and  from thence to have returned towards the source of the Essequibo, in  order to examine the crystal mountains and look once more for Lake  Parima, or the White Sea; but on arriving at Cayenne the current was  running with such amazing rapidity to leeward that a Portuguese sloop,  which had been beating up towards Para for four weeks, was then only  half-way. Finding, therefore, that a beat to the Amazons would be long,  tedious and even uncertain, and aware that the season for procuring  birds in fine plumage had already set in, I left Cayenne in an American  ship for Paramaribo, went through the interior to the Coryntin, stopped  a few days in New Amsterdam, and proceeded to Demerara. If, gentle  reader, thy patience be not already worn out, and thy eyes half-closed  in slumber by perusing the dull adventures of this second sally,  perhaps thou wilt pardon a line or two on Demerara; and then we will  retire to its forests to collect and examine the economy of its most  rare and beautiful birds, and give the world a new mode of preserving  them.    Stabroek, the capital of Demerara, has been rapidly increasing for some  years back; and if prosperity go hand in hand with the present  enterprising spirit, Stabroek, ere long, will be of the first colonial  consideration. It stands on the eastern bank at the mouth of the  Demerara, and enjoys all the advantages of the refreshing sea-breeze;  the streets are spacious, well bricked and elevated, the trenches  clean, the bridges excellent, and the houses handsome. Almost every  commodity and luxury of London may be bought in the shops at Stabroek:  its market wants better regulations. The hotels are commodious, clean  and well-attended. Demerara boasts as fine and well-disciplined militia  as any colony in the Western world.    The court of justice, where in times of old the bandage was easily  removed from the eyes of the goddess and her scales thrown out of  equilibrium, now rises in dignity under the firmness, talents and  urbanity of Mr. President Rough.    The plantations have an appearance of high cultivation; a tolerable  idea may be formed of their value when you know that last year Demerara  numbered 72,999 slaves. They made above 44,000,000 pounds of sugar,  near 2,000,000 gallons of rum, above 11,000,000 pounds of coffee, and  3,819,512 pounds of cotton; the receipt into the public chest was  553,956 guilders; the public expenditure 451,603 guilders.    Slavery can never be defended. He whose heart is not of iron can never  wish to be able to defend it: while he heaves a sigh for the poor negro  in captivity, he wishes from his soul that the traffic had been stifled  in its birth; but unfortunately the Governments of Europe nourished it,  and now that they are exerting themselves to do away the evil, and  ensure liberty to the sons of Africa, the situation of the  plantation-slaves is depicted as truly deplorable and their condition  wretched. It is not so. A Briton's heart, proverbially kind and  generous, is not changed by climate or its streams of compassion dried  up by the scorching heat of a Demerara sun: he cheers his negroes in  labour, comforts them in sickness, is kind to them in old age, and  never forgets that they are his fellow-creatures.    Instances of cruelty and depravity certainly occur here as well as all  the world over, but the edicts of the colonial Government are well  calculated to prevent them, and the British planter, except here and  there one, feels for the wrongs done to a poor ill-treated slave, and  shows that his heart grieves for him by causing immediate redress and  preventing a repetition.    Long may ye flourish, peaceful and liberal inhabitants of Demerara.  Your doors are ever open to harbour the harbourless; your purses never  shut to the wants of the distressed: many a ruined fugitive from the  Oroonoque will bless your kindness to him in the hour of need, when  flying from the woes of civil discord, without food or raiment, he  begged for shelter underneath your roof. The poor sufferer in Trinidad  who lost his all in the devouring flames will remember your charity to  his latest moments. The traveller, as he leaves your port, casts a  longing, lingering look behind: your attentions, your hospitality, your  pleasantry and mirth are uppermost in his thoughts; your prosperity is  close to his heart. Let us now, gentle reader, retire from the busy  scenes of man and journey on towards the wilds in quest of the  feathered tribe.    Leave behind you your high-seasoned dishes, your wines and your  delicacies: carry nothing but what is necessary for your own comfort  and the object in view, and depend upon the skill of an Indian, or your  own, for fish and game. A sheet about twelve feet long, ten wide,  painted, and with loop-holes on each side, will be of great service: in  a few minutes you can suspend it betwixt two trees in the shape of a  roof. Under this, in your hammock, you may defy the pelting shower, and  sleep heedless of the dews of night. A hat, a shirt and a light pair of  trousers will be all the raiment you require. Custom will soon teach  you to tread lightly and barefoot on the little inequalities of the  ground, and show you how to pass on unwounded amid the mantling briers.    Snakes, in these wilds, are certainly an annoyance, though perhaps more  in imagination than reality, for you must"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8172"],[0,"History of Astronomy (#16)"],[1,"colour remained, although their cause was unknown  until Newton carried out his experiments on dispersion and the solar  spectrum. To overcome the spherical aberration James Gregory,[2] of  Aberdeen and Edinburgh, in 1663, in his _Optica Promota_,  proposed a reflecting speculum of parabolic form. But it was Newton,  about 1666, who first made a reflecting telescope; and he did it with  the object of avoiding colour dispersion.    Some time elapsed before reflectors were much used.  Pound and Bradley  used one presented to the Royal Society by Hadley in 1723. Hawksbee,  Bradley, and Molyneaux made some. But James Short, of Edinburgh, made  many excellent Gregorian reflectors from 1732 till his death in 1768.    Newton's trouble with refractors, chromatic aberration, remained  insurmountable until John Dollond (born 1706, died 1761), after many  experiments, found out how to make an achromatic lens out of two  lenses--one of crown glass, the other of flint glass--to destroy the  colour, in a way originally suggested by Euler. He soon acquired a  great reputation for his telescopes of moderate size; but there was a  difficulty in making flint-glass lenses of large size. The first  actual inventor and constructor of an achromatic telescope was Chester  Moor Hall, who was not in trade, and did not patent it.  Towards the  close of the eighteenth century a Swiss named Guinand at last  succeeded in producing larger flint-glass discs free from  striae. Frauenhofer, of Munich, took him up in 1805, and soon  produced, among others, Struve's Dorpat refractor of 9.9 inches  diameter and 13.5 feet focal length, and another, of 12 inches  diameter and 18 feet focal length, for Lamont, of Munich.    In the nineteenth century gigantic _reflectors_ have been  made. Lassel's 2-foot reflector, made by himself, did much good work,  and discovered four new satellites.  But Lord Rosse's 6-foot  reflector, 54 feet focal length, constructed in 1845, is still the  largest ever made.  The imperfections of our atmosphere are against  the use of such large apertures, unless it be on high mountains.  During the last half century excellent specula have been made of  silvered glass, and Dr.  Common's 5-foot speculum (removed, since his  death, to Harvard) has done excellent work. Then there are the 5-foot  Yerkes reflector at Chicago, and the 4-foot by Grubb at Melbourne.    Passing now from these large reflectors to refractors, further  improvements have been made in the manufacture of glass by Chance, of  Birmingham, Feil and Mantois, of Paris, and Schott, of Jena; while  specialists in grinding lenses, like Alvan Clark, of the U.S.A., and  others, have produced many large refractors.    Cooke, of York, made an object-glass, 25-inch diameter, for Newall, of  Gateshead, which has done splendid work at Cambridge. We have the  Washington 26-inch by Clark, the Vienna 27-inch by Grubb, the Nice  291/2-inch by Gautier, the Pulkowa 30-inch by Clark. Then there was  the sensation of Clark's 36-inch for the Lick Observatory in  California, and finally his _tour de force_, the Yerkes 40-inch  refractor, for Chicago.    At Greenwich there is the 28-inch photographic refractor, and the  Thompson equatoreal by Grubb, carrying both the 26-inch photographic  refractor and the 30-inch reflector. At the Cape of Good Hope we find  Mr. Frank McClean's 24-inch refractor, with an object-glass prism for  spectroscopic work.    It would be out of place to describe here the practical adjuncts of a  modern equatoreal--the adjustments for pointing it, the clock for  driving it, the position-micrometer and various eye-pieces, the  photographic and spectroscopic attachments, the revolving domes,  observing seats, and rising floors and different forms of mounting,  the siderostats and coelostats, and other convenient adjuncts, besides  the registering chronograph and numerous facilities for aiding  observation.  On each of these a chapter might be written; but the  most important part of the whole outfit is the man behind the  telescope, and it is with him that a history is more especially  concerned.      SPECTROSCOPE.    Since the invention of the telescope no discovery has given so great  an impetus to astronomical physics as the spectroscope; and in giving  us information about the systems of stars and their proper motions it  rivals the telescope.    Frauenhofer, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, while  applying Dollond's discovery to make large achromatic telescopes,  studied the dispersion of light by a prism. Admitting the light of the  sun through a narrow slit in a window-shutter, an inverted image of  the slit can be thrown, by a lens of suitable focal length, on the  wall opposite. If a wedge or prism of glass be interposed, the image  is deflected to one side; but, as Newton had shown, the images formed  by the different colours of which white light is composed are  deflected to different extents--the violet most, the red least. The  number of colours forming images is so numerous as to form a  continuous spectrum on the wall with all the colours--red, orange,  yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. But Frauenhofer found with a  narrow slit, well focussed by the lens, that some colours were missing  in the white light of the sun, and these were shown by dark lines  across the spectrum.  These are the Frauenhofer lines, some of which  he named by the letters of the alphabet. The D line is a very marked  one in the yellow. These dark lines in the solar spectrum had already  been observed by Wollaston. [3]    On examining artificial lights it was found that incandescent solids  and liquids (including the carbon glowing in a white gas flame) give  continuous spectra; gases, except under enormous pressure, give bright  lines. If sodium or common salt be thrown on the colourless flame of a  spirit lamp, it gives it a yellow colour, and its spectrum is a bright  yellow line agreeing in position with line D of the solar spectrum.    In 1832 Sir David Brewster found some of the solar black lines  increased in strength towards sunset, and attributed them to  absorption in the earth's atmosphere.  He suggested that the others  were due to absorption in the sun's atmosphere. Thereupon Professor  J. D.  Forbes pointed out that during a nearly total eclipse the lines  ought to be strengthened in the same way; as that part of the sun's  light, coming from its edge, passes through a great distance in the  sun's atmosphere.  He tried this with the annular eclipse of 1836,  with a negative result which has never been accounted for, and which  seemed to condemn Brewster's view.    In 1859 Kirchoff, on repeating Frauenhofer's experiment, found that,  if a spirit lamp with salt in the flame were placed in the path of the  light, the black D line is intensified. He also found that, if he used  a limelight instead of the sunlight and passed it through the flame  with salt, the spectrum showed the D line black; or the vapour of  sodium absorbs the same light that it radiates. This proved to him the  existence of sodium in the sun's atmosphere.[4] Iron, calcium, and  other elements were soon detected in the same way.    Extensive laboratory researches (still incomplete) have been carried  out to catalogue (according to their wave-length on the undulatory  theory of light) all the lines of each chemical element, under all  conditions of temperature and pressure. At the same time, all the  lines have been catalogued in the light of the sun and the brighter of  the stars.    Another method of obtaining spectra had long been known, by  transmission through, or reflection from, a grating of equidistant  lines ruled upon glass or metal.  H. A. Rowland developed the art of  constructing these gratings, which requires great technical skill, and  for this astronomers owe him a debt of gratitude.    In 1842 Doppler[5] proved that the colour of a luminous body, like the  pitch or note of a sounding body, must be changed by velocity of  approach or recession. Everyone has noticed on a railway that, on  meeting a locomotive whistling, the note is lowered after the engine  has passed. The pitch of a sound or the colour of a light depends on  the number of waves striking the ear or eye in a second. This number  is increased by approach and lowered by recession.    Thus, by comparing the spectrum of a star alongside a spectrum of  hydrogen, we may see all the lines, and be sure that there is hydrogen  in the star; yet the lines in the star-spectrum may be all slightly  displaced to one side of the lines of the comparison spectrum. If  towards the violet end, it means mutual approach of the star and  earth; if to the red end, it means recession. The displacement of  lines does not tell us whether the motion is in the star, the earth,  or both.  The displacement of the lines being measured, we can  calculate the rate of approach or recession in miles per second.    In 1868 Huggins[6] succeeded in thus measuring the velocities of stars  in the direction of the line of sight.    In 1873 Vogel[7] compared the spectra of the sun's East (approaching)  limb and West (receding) limb, and the displacement of lines endorsed  the theory. This last observation was suggested by Zoellner.
