A leg of mutton will require from two hours  roasting to two hours and a half in proportion to its size. A  chine or saddle, from two hours and a half, to three hours. A  shoulder, from an hour and a half, to two hours. A loin, from an  hour and three quarters, to two hours. A haunch (that is a leg  with, part of the loin) cannot be well roasted in less than four  hours.    Always have some currant jelly on the table to eat with roast  mutton. It should also be accompanied by mashed turnips.    Slices cut from a cold leg of mutton that has been under-done, are  very nice broiled or warmed on a gridiron, and sent to the  breakfast table covered with currant jelly.    Pickles are always eaten with mutton.    In preparing a leg of mutton for roasting, you may make deep  incisions in it, and stuff them with chopped oysters, or with a  force-meat made in the usual manner; or with chestnuts parboiled  and peeled. The gravy will be improved by stirring into it a glass  of port wine.      TO BOIL MUTTON.    To prepare a leg of mutton for boiling, wash it clean, cut a small  piece off the shank bone, and trim the knuckle. Put it into a pot  with water enough to cover it, and boil it gently for three hours,  skimming it well. Then take it from the fire, and keeping the pot  well covered, let it finish by remaining in the steam for ten or  fifteen minutes. Serve it up with a sauce-boat of melted butter  into which a tea-cup full of capers or nasturtians have been  stirred.    Have mashed turnips to eat with it.    A few small onions boiled in the water with the mutton are thought  by some to improve the flavour of the meat. It is much better when  sufficient time is allowed to boil or simmer it slowly.    A neck or a loin of mutton will require also about three hours  slow boiling. These pieces should on no account be sent to table  the least under-done. Serve up with them carrots and whole  turnips. You may add a dish of suet dumplings to eat with the  meat, made of finely chopped suet mixed with double its quantity  of flour, and a little cold water.      MUTTON CHOPS.    Take chops or steaks from a loin of mutton, cut off the bone close  to the meat, and trim off the skin, and part of the fat. Beat them  to make them tender, and season them with pepper and salt. Make  your gridiron hot over a bed of clear bright coals; rub the bars  with suet, and lay on the chops. Turn them frequently; and if the  fat that falls from them causes a blaze and smoke, remove the  gridiron for a moment till it is over. When they are thoroughly  done, put them into a warm dish and butter them. Keep them covered  till a moment before they are to be eaten.    When the chops have been turned for the last time, you may strew  over them some finely minced onion moistened with boiling water,  and seasoned with pepper.    Some like them flavoured with mushroom catchup.    Another way of dressing mutton chops is, after trimming them  nicely and seasoning them with pepper and salt, to lay them for  awhile in melted butter. When they have imbibed a sufficient  quantity, take them out, and cover them all over with grated  bread-crumbs. Broil them over a clear fire, and see that the bread  does not burn.      CUTLETS A LA MAINTENON.    Cut a neck of mutton into steaks with a bone in each; trim them  nicely, and scrape clean the end of the bone. Flatten them with a  rolling pin, or a meat beetle, and lay them in oiled butter. Make  a seasoning of hard-boiled yolk of egg and sweet-herbs minced  small, grated bread, pepper, salt, and nutmeg; and, if you choose,  a little minced onion. Take the chops out of the butter, and cover  them with the seasoning. Butter some half sheets of white paper,  and put the cutlets into them, so as to be entirely covered,  securing the paper with pins or strings; and twisting them nicely  round the bone. Heat your gridiron over some bright lively coals.  Lay the cutlets on it, and broil them about twenty minutes. The  custom of sending them to table in the papers had best be omitted,  as (unless managed by a French cook) these envelopes, after being  on the gridiron, make a very bad appearance.    Serve them up hot, with mushroom sauce in a boat, or with a brown  gravy, flavoured with red wine. You may make the gravy of the  bones and trimmings, stewed in a little water, skimmed well, and  strained when sufficiently stewed. Thicken it with flour browned  in a Dutch oven, and add a glass of red wine.    You may bake these cutlets in a Dutch oven without the papers.  Moisten them frequently with a little oiled butter.      STEWED MUTTON CHOPS.    Cut a loin or neck of mutton into chops, and trim away the fat and  bones. Beat and flatten them. Season them with pepper and salt,  and put them into a stew-pan, with barely sufficient water to  cover them, and some sliced carrots, turnips, onions, potatoes,  and a bunch of sweet herbs, or a few tomatas. Let the whole stew  slowly about three hours, or till every thing is tender. Keep the  pan closely covered, except when you are skimming it.    Send it to table with sippets or three-cornered pieces of toasted  bread, lain all round the dish.      HASHED MUTTON.    Cut into small pieces the lean of some cold mutton that has been  under-done, and season it with pepper and salt. Take the bones and  other trimmings, put them into a sauce-pan with as much water as  will cover them, and some sliced onions, and let them stew till  you have drawn from them a good gravy. Having skimmed it well,  strain the gravy into a stew-pan, and put the mutton into it. Have  ready-boiled some carrots, turnips, potatoes and onions. Slice  them, and add them to the meat and gravy. Set the pan on hot  coals, and let it simmer till the meat is warmed through, but do  not allow it to boil, as it has been once cooked already. Cover  the bottom of a dish with slices of buttered toast. Lay the meat  and vegetables upon it, and pour over them the gravy.    Tomatas will be found an improvement.    If green peas, or Lima beans are in season, you may boil them, and  put them to the hashed mutton; leaving out the other vegetables,  or serving them up separately.      A CASSEROLE OF MUTTON.    Butter a deep dish or mould, and line it with potatoes mashed with  milk or putter, and seasoned with pepper and salt. Fill it with  slices of the lean of cold mutton, or lamb, seasoned also. Cover  the whole with more mashed potatoes. Put it into an oven, and bake  it till the meat is thoroughly warmed, and the potatoes brown.  Then carefully turn it out on a large dish; or you may, if more  convenient, send it to table in the dish it was baked in.      MUTTON HARICO.    Take a neck of mutton, cut it into chops, and fry them brown. Then  put them into a stew-pan with a bunch of sweet herbs, two or three  cloves, a little mace, and pepper and salt to your taste. Cover  them with boiling water, and let them stew slowly for about an  hour. Then cut some carrots and turnips into dice; slice some  onions, and cut up a head of celery; put them all into the stew-pan,  and keep it closely covered except when you are skimming off  the fat. Let the whole stew gently for an hour longer, and then  send it to table in a deep dish, with the gravy about it.    You may make a similar harico of veal steaks, or of beef cut very  thin.      STEWED LEG OF MUTTON.    Take a leg of mutton and trim it nicely. Put it into a pot with  three pints of water; or with two pints of water and one quart of  gravy drawn from bones, trimmings, and coarse pieces of meat. Add  some slices of carrots, and a little salt. Stew it slowly three  hours. Then put in small onions, small turnips, tomatas or tomata  catchup, and shred or powdered sweet marjoram to your taste, and  let it stew three hours longer. A large leg will require from  first to last from six hours and a half to seven hours stewing.  But though it must be tender and well done all through, do not  allow it to stew to rags. Serve it up with the vegetables and  gravy round it. Have mashed potatoes in another dish.      TO ROAST LAMB.    The best way of cooking lamb is to roast it; when drest otherwise  it is insipid, and not so good as mutton. A hind-quarter of eight  pounds will be done in about two hours; a fore-quarter of ten  pounds, in two hours and a half; a leg of five pounds will take  from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half; a loin about an  hour and a half. Lamb, like veal and pork, is not eatable unless  thoroughly done; no one preferring it rare, as is frequently the  case with beef and mutton.    Wash the meat, wipe it dry, spit it, and cover the fat with paper.  Place it before a clear brisk fire. Baste it at first with a  little salt and water, and then with its own drippings. Remove the  paper when the meat is nearly done, and dredge the lamb with a  little flour. Afterwards baste it with butter. Do not take it off  the spit till you see it drop white gravy.    Prepare some mint sauce by stripping from the stalks the leaves of  young green mint, mincing them very fine, and mixing them with  vinegar and sugar. There must be just sufficient vinegar to  moisten the mint, but not enough to make the sauce liquid. Send it  to table in a boat, and the gravy in another boat. Garnish with  sliced lemon.    In carving a quarter of lamb, separate the shoulder from the  breast, or the leg from the ribs, sprinkle a little salt and  pepper, and squeeze on some lemon juice.    It should be accompanied by asparagus, green peas, and lettuce.          PORK, HAM, &c.      GENERAL REMARKS.    In cutting up pork, you have the spare-rib, shoulder, griskin or  chine, the loin, middlings and leg; the head, feet, heart and  liver. On the spare-rib and chine there is but little meat, and  the pieces called middlings consist almost entirely of fat. The  best parts are the loin, and the leg or hind-quarter.

Near the warriors' hands were drinking cups of heavy gold. There  were seal rings with carved stones. There was the silver mask of an  ox head with golden horns, and the golden mask of a lion's head. And  scattered over everything were buttons, and ribbons, and leaves, and  flowers of gold.    Schliemann gazed at the swords with burning eyes.    \"The heroes of Troy have used these swords,\" he said to his wife,  \"Perhaps Achilles himself has handled them.\" He looked long at the  golden masks of kingly faces.    \"I believe that one of these masks covered the face of Agamemnon. I  believe I am kneeling at the side of the king of men,\" he said in a  hushed voice.    Why were all these things there? Thousands of years before, when their  king had died, the people had grieved.    \"He is going to the land of the dead,\" they had thought. \"It is a dull  place. We will send gifts with him to cheer his heart. He must have  lions to hunt and swords to kill them. He must have cattle to eat. He  must have his golden cup for wine.\"    So they had put these things into the grave, thinking that the king  could take them with him. They even had put in food, for Schliemann  found oyster shells buried there. And they had thought that a king, even  in the land of the dead, must have servants to work for him. So they had  sacrificed slaves, and had sent them with their lord. Schliemann found  their bones above the grave. And besides the silver mask of the ox head  they had sent real cattle. After the king had been laid in his grave,  they had killed oxen before the altar. Part they had burned in the  sacred fire for the dead king, and part the people had eaten for the  funeral feast. These bones and ashes, too, Schliemann found. For a long,  long time the people had not forgotten their dead chiefs. Every year  they had sacrificed oxen to them. They had set up gravestones for them,  and after a while they had heaped great mounds over their graves.    That was a wonderful old world at Mycenae. The king's palace sat on a  hill. It was not one building, but many--a great hall where the warriors  ate, the women's large room where they worked, two houses of many  bedrooms, treasure vaults, a bath, storehouses. Narrow passages led from  room to room. Flat roofs of thatch and clay covered all. And there were  open courts with porches about the sides. The floors of the court were  of tinted concrete. Sometimes they were inlaid with colored stones. The  walls of the great hall had a painted frieze running about them. And  around the whole palace went a thick stone wall.    One such old palace has been uncovered at Tiryns near Mycenae. To-day  a visitor can walk there through the house of an ancient king. The  watchman is not there, so the stranger goes through the strong old  gateway. He stands in the courtyard, where the young men used to play  games. He steps on the very floor they trod. He sees the stone bases of  columns about him. The wooden pillars have rotted away, but he imagines  them holding a porch roof, and he sees the men resting in the shade. He  walks into the great room where the warriors feasted. He sees the hearth  in the middle and imagines the fire blazing there. He looks into the  bathroom with its sloping stone floor and its holes to drain off the  water. He imagines Greek maidens coming to the door with vases of water  on their heads. He walks through the long, winding passages and into  room after room. \"The children of those old days must have had trouble  finding their way about in this big palace,\" he thinks.    Such was the palace of the king. Below it lay many poorer houses, inside  the walls and out. We can imagine men and women walking about this city.  We raise the warriors from their graves. They carry their golden cups in  their hands. Their rings glisten on their fingers, and their bracelets  on their arms. Perhaps, instead of the golden armor, they wear  breastplates of bronze of the same shape, but these same swords hang at  their sides. We look at their golden masks and see their straight noses  and their short beards. We study the carving on their gravestones, and  we see their two-wheeled chariots and their prancing horses. We look at  the carved gems of their seal rings and see them fighting or killing  lions. We look at their embossed drinking cups, and we see them catching  the wild bulls in nets. We gaze at the great walls of Mycenae, and  wonder what machines they had for lifting such heavy stones. We look at  a certain silver vase, and see warriors fighting before this very wall.  We see all the beautiful work in gold and silver and gems and ivory, and  we think, \"Those men of old Mycenae were artists.\"            PICTURES OF MYCENAE      THE CIRCLE OF ROYAL TOMBS.    Digging within this circle, Dr. Schliemann found the famous treasure  of golden gifts to the dead, which he gave to Greece. In the Museum at  Athens you can see these wonderful things. (From a photograph in the  Metropolitan Museum.)      DR. AND MRS. SCHLIEMANN AT WORK.    This picture is taken from Dr. Schliemann's own book on his work.      THE GATE OF LIONS.    The stone over the gateway is immensely strong. But the wall builders  were afraid to pile too great a weight upon it. So they left a  triangular space above it. You can see how they cut the big stones with  slanting ends to do this. This triangle they filled with a thinner  stone carved with two lions. The lions' heads are gone. They were made  separately, perhaps of bronze, and stood away from the stone looking out  at people approaching the gate.      INSIDE THE TREASURY OF ATREUS.    No wonder the untaught modern Greeks thought that this was a giants'  oven, where the giants baked their bread. But learned men have shown  that it was connected with a tomb, and that in this room the men  of Mycenae worshipped their dead. It was very wonderfully made and  beautifully ornamented. The big stone over the doorway was nearly thirty  feet long, and weighs a hundred and twenty tons. Men came to this  beehive tomb in the old days of Mycenae, down a long passage with a high  stone wall on either side. The doorway was decorated with many-colored  marbles and beautiful bronze plates. The inside was ornamented, too, and  there was an altar in there.      THE INTERIOR OF THE PALACE.    From these ruins and relics, we know much about the art of the  Mycenaeans, something about their government, their trade, their  religion, their home life, their amusements, and their ways of fighting,  though they lived three thousand years ago. If a great modern city  should be buried, and men should dig it up three thousand years later,  what do you think they will say about us?      GOLD MASK.    This mask was still on the face of the dead king. The artist tried to  make the mask look just as the great king himself had looked, but this  was very hard to do.      A COW'S HEAD OF SILVER.    The king's people put into his grave this silver mask of an ox head with  golden horns. It was a symbol of the cattle sacrificed for the dead.  There is a gold rosette between the eyes. The mouth, muzzle, eyes and  ears are gilded. In Homer's Iliad, which is the story of the Trojan war,  Diomede says, \"To thee will I sacrifice a yearling heifer, broad at  brow, unbroken, that never yet hath man led beneath the yoke. Her will I  sacrifice to thee, and gild her horns with gold.\"      THE WARRIOR VASE.    This vase was made of clay and baked. Then the artist painted figures on  it with colored earth. This was so long ago that men had not learned to  draw very well, but we like the vase because the potter made it such a  beautiful shape, and because we learn from it how the warriors of early  Mycenae dressed. Under their armor they wore short chitons with fringe  at the bottom, and long sleeves, and they carried strangely shaped  shields and short spears or long lances. Do you think those are  knapsacks tied to the lances?      BRONZE HELMETS.    These may have been worn by King Agamemnon, or by the Trojan warriors.  They are now in the Metropolitan Museum in New York.      GEM FROM MYCENAE.    Early men made many pictures much like this--a pillar guarded by an  animal on each side.      BRONZE DAGGERS.    It would take a very skilfull man to-day, a man who was both goldsmith  and artist, to make such daggers as men found at Mycenae. First the  blade was made. Then the artist took a separate sheet of bronze for his  design. This sheet he enamelled, and on it he inlaid his design. On one  of these daggers we see five hunters fighting three lions. Two of the  lions are running away. One lion is pouncing upon a hunter, but his  friends are coming to help him. If you could turn this dagger over, you  would see a lion chasing five gazelles. The artist used pure gold for  the bodies of the hunters and the lions; he used electron, an alloy of  gold and silver, for the hunters' shields and their trousers; and he  made the men's hair, the lions' manes, and the rims of the shields, of  some black substance. When the picture was finished on the plate, he  set the plate into the blade, and riveted on the handle. On the smaller  dagger we see three lions running.      CARVED IVORY HEAD.    It shows the kind of helmet used in Mycenae. Do you think the button at  the top may have had a socket for a horse hair plume?      BRONZE BROOCHES.    These brooches were like modern safety pins, and were used to fasten the  chlamys at the shoulder. The chlamys was a heavy woolen shawl, red or  purple.      ONE OF THE CUPS FOUND AT VAPHIO.    Some people say that these cups are the most wonderful things that  have been found, made by Mycenaean artists. Some people say that no  goldsmiths in the world since then, unless perhaps in Italy in the  fifteenth century, have done such lovely work. The goldsmith took a  plate of gold and hammered his design into it from the wrong side. Then  he riveted the two ends together"]]]
