I'd like to go back up there, but I guess  I'm gettin' too old. While I was there I preached and I worked all the  time. I worked on the streets and the driveways in Lincoln Park. I was  in the brick and block department. Then I went from there to the asphalt  department. There's where I coined the money. Made $6.60 in the brick  and block and $7.20 a day in the asphalt. Down here they don't know no  more about asphalt than a pig does about a holiday. _A man that's from  the South and never been nowhere, don't know nothin', a woman either_.    \"Yes ma'm, I'm a preacher. Just a local preacher, wasn't ordained. The  reason for that was, in Texas a man over forty-five couldn't join the  traveling connection. I was licensed, but of course I couldn't perform  marriage ceremonies. I was just within one step of that.    \"I went to school two days in my life. I was privileged to go to the  first free school in Texas. Had a teacher named Goldman. Don't know what  year that was but they found out me and another fellow was too old so  they wouldn't let us go no more. But I caught my alphabet in them two  days. So I just caught what education I've got, here and there. I can  read well--best on my Bible and Testament and I read the newspapers. I  can sorta scribble my name.    \"I've been a farmer most of my life and a preacher for fifty-five years.  I can repair shoes and use to do common carpenter work. I can help build  a house. I only preach occasionally now, here and there. I belong to the  Allen Temple in Hoboken (East Pine Bluff).    \"I think the young generation is gone to naught.

Pine Bluff District  FOLKLORE SUBJECTS  Name of Interviewer: Martin - Barker  Subject: Negro Customs    Information by: Ben Moon  [TR: Information moved from bottom of second page.]      I was born on the Walker place, in 1869. My father was a slave to Mr.  Bob. I used to drive Miss Lelia (Eulalie) to the Catholic church here in  Pine Bluff. She used to let me go barefooted, and bare headed.    Miss Lelia was the daughter of Col. Creed Taylor. All during slavery  time I drove her gins. We had eight mules. Eight at a time hitched to  each lever, they would weave in an out but they was so hitched that they  never got in any body's way. They just walked around and round like they  did in those days. We had herds of sheep, we sheared them and wove yarn  for socks. We raised wheat, when it was ripe we laid a canvas cloth on  the ground and put wheat on it, then men and women on horse back rode  over it, and thrashed it that way. They called it treading it. Then we  took it to the mill and ground it and made it into flour. For breakfast,  (we ate awful soon in the morning), about 4 AM, then we packed lunch in  tin buckets and eat again at daylight. Fat meat, cornbread and molasses.  Some would have turnip greens for breakfast.    Summertime, Miss Lelia would plant plenty of fruit, and we would have  fried apples, stewed peaches and things.    Sunday mornings we would have biscuit, butter, molasses, chicken, etc.    For our work they paid us seventy-five cents a day and when come cotton  picking time old rule, seventy five cents for pickin cotton. Christmas  time, plenty of fireworks, plenty to eat, drink and everything. We would  dance all Christmas.    All kind of game was plentiful, plenty of coon, possum, used up  everything that grew in the woods. Plenty of corn, we took it to the  grist mill every Saturday.    Ark. riv. boats passed the Walker place, and dey was a landing right at  dere place, and one at the Wright place, that is where the airport is  now.    All de white folks had plenty of cattle den and in de winter time dey  was all turned in on the fields and with what us niggers had, that made  a good many, and you know yorself dat was good for de ground.    Mother was a slave on the Merriweather place, her marster was Mick[TR:  name not clear] Merriweather. My granma was Gusta Merriweather, my  mother Lavina and lived on the Merriweather place in what was then  Dorsey county, near Edinburg, now Cleveland Co. My grandfather was Louis  Barnett, owned by Nick Barnett of Cleveland co., then Dorsey co. Fathers  people was owned by Marse Bob Walker. Miss Lelia (Eulalie) was mistis.  Miss Maggie Benton was young mistis.    I dont believe in ghosts or spirits.

When my daddy come back from the War, he  said I was gwine on seven or eight.    \"He stayed in the War three years and six months. I know that's what he  always told us.

She didn't play with us much.    \"Yes ma'am, they sure did take us to Texas durin' of the War--in a ox  wagon. Stayed down there a long time.    \"We didn't have plenty to eat but we had to eat what we did. I member  they wouldn't give us chillun no meat, jus' grease my mouf and make my  mother think we had meat.    \"Now my mother told me, at night some of the folks used to steal one of  old massa's shoats and cook it at night.

My mammy was a worker and as the  sayin' is, I was a chip off the old block.    \"The first teacher I went to school to was named Mr. Cushman. Didn't go  only on rainy days.

The Blackfeet were much surprised at what the young man had done. After a  little while, the leader decided that they would go back to the camp from  which they had come. When he had returned from this war journey this young  man's name was changed from A'-tsi-tsi to E-k[=u]s'-kini (Low Horn). This  was his first war path.    From that time on the name of E-k[=u]s'-kini was often heard as that of one  doing some great deed.        II    E-k[=u]s'-kini started on his last war trail from the Black-foot crossing  _(Su-yoh-pah'-wah-ku)_. He led a party of six Sarcees. He was the seventh  man.    On the second day out, they came to the Red Deer's River. When they reached  this river, they found it very high, so they built a raft to cross on. They  camped on the other side. In crossing, most of their powder got wet. The  next morning, when they awoke, E-k[=u]s'-kini said: \"Well, trouble is  coming for us. We had better go back from here. We started on a wrong  day. I saw in my sleep our bodies lying on the prairie, dead.\" Some of the  young men said: \"Oh well, we have started, we had better go on. Perhaps it  is only a mistake. Let us go on and try to take some horses anyhow.\"  E-k[=u]s'-kini said: \"Yes, that is very true. To go home is all  foolishness; but remember that it is by your wish that we are going on.\"  He wanted to go back, not on his own account, but for the sake of his young  men--to save his followers.    From there they went on and made another camp, and the next morning he said  to his young men: \"Now I am sure. I have seen it for certain. Trouble is  before us.\" They camped two nights at this place and dried some of their  powder, but most of it was caked and spoilt. He said to his young men:  \"Here, let us use some sense about this. We have no ammunition. We cannot  defend ourselves. Let us turn back from here.\" So they started across the  country for their camp.    They crossed the Red Deer's River, and there camped again. The next morning  E-k[=u]s'-kini said: \"I feel very uneasy to-day. Two of you go ahead on the  trail and keep a close lookout. I am afraid that to-day we are going to see  our enemy.\" Two of the young men went ahead, and when they had climbed to  the top of a ridge and looked over it on to Sarvis Berry (Saskatoon) Creek,  they came back and told E-k[=u]s'-kini that they had seen a large camp of  people over there, and that they thought it was the Piegans, Bloods,  Blackfeet, and Sarcees, who had all moved over there together. Saskatoon  Creek was about twenty miles from the Blackfoot camp. He said: \"No, it  cannot be our people. They said nothing about moving over here; it must be  a war party. It is only a few days since we left, and there was then no  talk of their leaving that camp. It cannot be they.\" The two young men  said: \"Yes, they are our people. There are too many of them for a war  party. We think that the whole camp is there.\" They discussed this for some  little time, E-k[=u]s'-kini insisting that it could not be the Blackfoot  camp, while the young men felt sure that it was. These two men said, \"Well,  we are going on into the camp now.\" Low Horn said: \"Well, you may go. Tell  my father that I will come into the camp to-night. I do not like to go in  in the daytime, when I am not bringing back anything with me.\"    It was now late in the afternoon, and the two young men went ahead toward  the camp, travelling on slowly. A little after sundown, they came down the  hill on to the flat of the river, and saw there the camp. They walked down  toward it, to the edge of the stream, and there met two women, who had come  down after water. The men spoke to them in Sarcee, and said, \"Where is the  Sarcee camp?\" The women did not understand them, so they spoke again, and  asked the same question in Blackfoot. Then these two women called out in  the Cree language, \"Here are two Blackfeet, who have come here and are  talking to us.\" When these men heard the women talk Cree, and saw what a  mistake they had made, they turned and ran away up the creek. They ran up  above camp a short distance, to a place where a few willow bushes were  hanging over the stream, and pushing through these, they hid under the  bank, and the willows above concealed them. The people in the camp came  rushing out, and men ran up the creek, and down, and looked everywhere for  the two enemies, but could find nothing of them.    Now when these people were running in all directions, hunting for these two  men, E-k[=u]s'-kini was coming down the valley slowly with the four other  Sarcees. He saw some Indians coming toward him, and supposed that they were  some of his own people, coming to meet him, with horses for him to ride. At  length, when they were close to him, and E-k[=u]s'-kini could see that they  were the enemy, and were taking the covers off their guns, he jumped to one  side and stood alone and began to sing his war song. He called out,  \"Children of the Crees, if you have come to try my manhood, do your best.\"  In a moment or two he was surrounded, and they were shooting at him from  all directions. He called out again, \"People, you can't kill me here, but  I will take my body to your camp, and there you shall kill me.\" So he  advanced, fighting his way toward the Cree camp, but before he started, he  killed two of the Crees there. His enemies kept coming up and clustering  about him: some were on foot and some on horseback. They were thick about  him on all sides, and they could not shoot much at him, for fear of killing  their own people on the other side.    One of the Sarcees fell. E-k[=u]s'-kini said to his men, \"_A-wah-heh'_\"  (Take courage). \"These people cannot kill us here. Where that patch of  choke-cherry brush is, in the very centre of their camp, we will go and  take our stand.\" Another Sarcee fell, and now there were only three of  them. E-k[=u]s'-kini said to his remaining men: \"Go straight to that patch  of brush, and I will fight the enemy off in front and at the sides, and so  will keep the way open for you. These people cannot kill us here. There are  too many of their own people. If we can get to that brush, we will hurt  them badly.\" All this time they were killing enemies, fighting bravely, and  singing their war songs. At last they gained the patch of brush, and then  with their knives they began to dig holes in the ground, and to throw up a  shelter.    In the Cree camp was K[)o]m-in'-[)a]-k[=u]s (Round), the chief of the  Crees, who could talk Blackfoot well. He called out: \"E-k[=u]s'-kini, there  is a little ravine running out of that brush patch, which puts into the  hills. Crawl out through that, and try to get away. It is not guarded.\"  E-k[=u]s'-kini replied: \"No, Children of the Crees, I will not go. You must  remember that it is E-k[=u]s'-kini that you are fighting with--a man who  has done much harm to your people. I am glad that I am here. I am sorry for  only one thing; that is, that my ammunition is going to run out. To-morrow  you may kill me.\"    All night long the fight was kept up, the enemy shooting all the time, and  all night long E-k[=u]s'-kini sang his death song. K[)o]m-in'-[)a]-k[=u]s  called to him several times: \"E-k[=u]s'-kini, you had better do what I tell  you. Try to get away.\" But he shouted back, \"No,\" and laughed at them. He  said: \"You have killed all my men. I am here alone, but you cannot kill  me.\" K[)o]m-in'-[)a]-k[=u]s, the chief, said: \"Well, if you are there at  daylight in the morning, I will go into that brush and will catch you with  my hands. I will be the man who will put an end to you.\" E-k[=u]s'-kini  said: \"K[)o]m-in'-[)a]-k[=u]s, do not try to do that. If you do, you shall  surely die.\" The patch of brush in which he had hidden had now been all  shot away, cut off by the bullets of the enemy.    When day came, E-k[=u]s'-kini called out: \"Eh, K[)o]m-in'-[)a]-k[=u]s, it  is broad daylight now. I have run out of ammunition. I have not another  grain of powder in my horn. Now come and take me in your hands, as you  said you would.\" K[)o]m-in'-[)a]-k[=u]s answered: \"Yes, I said that I was  the one who was going to catch you this morning. Now I am coming.\"    He took off all his clothes, and alone rushed for the  breastworks. E-k[=u]s'-kini's ammunition was all gone, but he still had one  load in his gun, and his dagger. K[)o]m-in'-[)a]-k[=u]s came on with his  gun at his shoulder, and E-k[=u]s'-kini sat there with his gun in his hand,  looking at the man who was coming toward him with the cocked gun pointed at  him. He was singing his death song. As K[)o]m-in'-[)a]-k[=u]s got up close,  and just as he was about to fire, E-k[=u]s'-kini threw up his gun and  fired, and the ball knocked off the Cree chiefs forefinger, and going on,  entered his right eye and came out at the temple, knocking the eye  out. K[)o]m-in'-[)a]-k[=u]s went down, and his gun flew a long way.    When K[)o]m-in'-[)a]-k[=u]s fell, the whole camp shouted the war whoop, and  cried out, \"This is his last shot,\" and they all charged on him. They knew  that he had no more ammunition.    The head warrior of the Crees was named Bunch of Lodges. He was the first  man to jump inside the breastworks. As he sprang inside, E-k[=u]s'-kini  met him, and thrust his dagger through him, and killed him on the spot.  Then, as the enemy threw themselves on him, and he began to feel the knives  stuck into him from all sides, he gave a war whoop and laughed, and said,  \"Only now I begin to think that I am fighting.\" All the time he was cutting  and stabbing, jumping backward and forward, and all the time laughing. When  he was dead, there were fifteen dead Crees lying about the  earthworks. E-k[=u]s'-kini body was cut into small pieces and scattered all  over the country, so that he might not come to life again.      III    That morning, before it was daylight, the two Sarcees who had hidden in the  willows left their hiding-place and"]]]
