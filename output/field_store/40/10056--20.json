To sum up: the American 44-gun frigate was a true frigate, in build  and armament, properly rated, stronger than a 38-gun frigate just  about in the proportion of 44 to 38, and not exceeding in strength  an 18-pounder frigate as much as the latter exceeded one carrying  12-pounders. They were in no way whatever line-of-battle ships;  but they were superior to any other frigates afloat, and, what is  still more important, they were better manned and commanded than  the _average_ frigate of any other navy. Lord Codrington says  (\"Memoirs,\" i, p. 310): \"But I well know the system of favoritism  and borough corruption prevails so very much that many people are  promoted and kept in command that should be dismissed the service,  and while such is the case the few Americans chosen for their merit  may be expected to follow up their successes except where they meet  with our best officers on even terms.\" [Footnote: To show that I am  not quoting an authority biassed in our favor I will give Sir  Edward Codrington's opinion of our rural better class (i, 318).  \"It is curious to observe the animosity which prevails here among  what is called the better order of people, which I think is more  a misnomer here than in any other country I have ever been. Their  _whig_ and _tory_ are democrat and federalist, and it would seem  for the sake of giving vent to that bitterness of hatred which  marks the Yankee character, every gentleman (God save the term)  who takes possession of a property adopts the opposite political  creed to that of his nearest neighbor.\"] The small size of our  navy was probably to a certain extent effective in keeping it up  to a high standard; but this is not the only explanation, as can  be seen by Portugal's small and poor navy. On the other hand, the  champions or pick of a large navy _ought_ to be better than the  champions of a small one. [Footnote: In speaking of tonnage I wish  I could have got better authority than James for the British side  of the question. He is so bitter that it involuntarily gives one  a distrust of his judgment. Thus, in speaking of the _Penguin's_  capture, he, in endeavoring to show that the _Hornet's_ loss was  greater than she acknowledged, says, \"several of the dangerously  wounded were thrown overboard because the surgeon was afraid to  amputate, owing to his want of experience\" (\"Naval Occurrences,\"  492). Now what could persuade a writer to make such a foolish  accusation? No matter how utterly depraved and brutal Captain  Biddle might be, he would certainly not throw his wounded over  alive because he feared they might die. Again, in vol. vi, p. 546,  he says: \"Captain Stewart had caused the _Cyane_ to be painted to  resemble a 36-gun frigate. The object of this was to aggrandize his  exploit in the eyes of the gaping citizens of Boston.\" No matter  how skilful an artist Captain Stewart was, and no matter how great  the gaping capacities of the Bostonians, the _Cyane_ (which by the  way went to New York and not Boston) could no more be painted to  look like a 36-gun frigate than a schooner could be painted to look  like a brig. Instances of rancor like these two occur constantly  in his work, and make it very difficult to separate what is matter  of fact from what is matter of opinion. I always rely on the British  official accounts when they can be reached, except in the case of  the _Java_, which seem garbled. That such was sometimes the case  with British officials is testified to by both James (vol. iv,  p. 17) and Brenton (vol. ii, p. 454, note). From the \"Memoir of  Admiral Broke\" we learn that his public letter was wrong in a number  of particulars. See also any one of the numerous biographies of  Lord Dundonald, the hero of the little _Speedy's_ fight. It is  very unfortunate that the British stopped publishing official  accounts of their defeats; it could not well help giving rise to  unpleasant suspicions.    It may be as well to mention here, again, that James' accusations do not  really detract from the interest attaching to the war, and its value for  purposes of study. If, as he says, the American commanders were cowards,  and their crews renegades, it is well worth while to learn the lesson that  good training will make such men able to beat brave officers with loyal  crews. And why did the British have such bad average crews as he makes  out? He says, for instance, that the Java's was unusually bad; yet  Brenton says (vol. ii, p. 461) it was like \"the generality of our crews.\"  It is worth while explaining the reason that such a crew was generally  better than a French and worse than an American one.]    Again, the armaments of the American as well as of the British  ships were composed of three very different styles of guns. The  first, or long gun, was enormously long and thick-barrelled in  comparison to its bore, and in consequence very heavy; it possessed  a very long range, and varied in calibre from two to forty-two  pounds. The ordinary calibres in our navy were 6, 9, 12, 18, and  24. The second style was the carronade, a short, light gun of  large bore; compared to a long gun of the same weight it carried  a much heavier ball for a much shorter distance. The chief calibres  were 9, 12, 18, 24, 32, 42, and 68-pounders, the first and the  last being hardly in use in our navy. The third style was the  columbiad, of an intermediate grade between the first two. Thus  it is seen that a gun of one style by no means corresponds to a  gun of another style of the same calibre. As a rough example, a  long 12, a columbiad 18, and a 32-pound carronade would be about  equivalent to one another. These guns were mounted on two different  types of vessel. The first was flush-decked; that is, it had a  single straight open deck on which all the guns were mounted.  This class included one heavy corvette, (the _Adams_), the  ship-sloops, and the brig-sloops. Through the bow-chase port, on  each side, each of these mounted a long gun; the rest of their guns  were carronades, except in the case of the _Adams_, which had all  long guns. Above these came the frigates, whose gun-deck was  covered above by another deck; on the fore and aft parts (forecastle  and quarter-deck) of this upper, open deck were also mounted guns.  The main-deck guns were all long, except on the _Essex_, which  had carronades; on the quarter-deck were mounted carronades, and  on the forecastle also carronades, with two long bow-chasers.    Where two ships of similar armament fought one another, it is easy  to get the comparative force by simply comparing the weight in  broadsides, each side presenting very nearly the same proportion  of long guns to carronades. For such a broadside we take half the  guns mounted in the ordinary way; and all guns mounted on pivots  or shifting. Thus Perry's force in guns was 54 to Barclay's 63;  yet each presented 34 in broadside. Again, each of the British  brig-sloops mounted 19 guns, presenting 10 in broadside. Besides  these, some ships mounted bow-chasers run through the bridle-ports,  or stern-chasers, neither of which could be used in broadsides.  Nevertheless, I include them, both because it works in about an  equal number of cases against each navy, and because they were  sometimes terribly effective. James excludes the _Guerri√®re's_  bow-chaser; in reality he ought to have included both it and its  fellow, as they worked more damage than all the broadside guns  put together. Again, he excludes the _Endymion's_ bow-chasers,  though in her action they proved invaluable. Yet he includes those  of the _Enterprise_ and _Argus_, though the former's were probably  not fired. So I shall take the half of the fixed, plus all the  movable guns aboard, in comparing broadside force.    But the chief difficulty appears when guns of one style are  matched against those of another. If a ship armed with long 12's,  meets one armed with 32-pound carronades, which is superior in  force? At long range the first, and at short range the second; and  of course each captain is pretty sure to insist that \"circumstances\"  forced him to fight at a disadvantage. The result would depend  largely on the skill or luck of each commander in choosing position.    One thing is certain; long guns are more formidable than carronades  of the same calibre. There are exemplifications of this rule on  both sides; of course, American writers, as a rule, only pay  attention to one set of cases, and British to the others. The _Cyane_  and _Levant_ threw a heavier broadside than the _Constitution_ but  were certainly less formidably armed; and the _Essex_ threw a heavier  broadside than the _Phoebe_, yet was also less formidable. On Lake  Ontario the American ship _General Pike_ threw less metal at a  broadside than either of her two chief antagonists, but neither  could be called her equal; while on Lake Champlain a parallel case  is afforded by the British ship _Confiance_. Supposing that two  ships throw the same broadside weight of metal, one from long guns,  the other from carronades, at short range they are equal; at long,  one has it all her own way. Her captain thus certainly has a great  superiority of force, and if he does not take advantage of it it  is owing to his adversary's skill or his own mismanagement. As a  mere approximation, it may be assumed, in comparing the broadsides  of two vessels or squadrons, that long guns count for at least  twice as much as carronades of the same calibre. Thus on Lake  Champlain Captain Downie possessed an immense advantage in his  long guns, which Commodore Macdonough's exceedingly good arrangements  nullified. Sometimes part of the advantage may be willingly foregone,  so as to acquire some other. Had the _Constitution_ kept at long  bowls with the _Cyane_ and _Levant_ she could have probably captured  one without any loss "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/917"],[0,"Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty (#16)"],[1,"got upon the table too; and seating himself in a lower  chair than Mr Tappertit's, with much state and ceremony, placed the  large book on the shoulders of their mute companion as deliberately as  if he had been a wooden desk, and prepared to make entries therein with  a pen of corresponding size.    When the long comrade had made these preparations, he looked towards Mr  Tappertit; and Mr Tappertit, flourishing the bone, knocked nine times  therewith upon one of the skulls. At the ninth stroke, a third young  gentleman emerged from the door leading to the skittle ground, and  bowing low, awaited his commands.    'Prentice!' said the mighty captain, 'who waits without?'    The 'prentice made answer that a stranger was in attendance, who claimed  admission into that secret society of 'Prentice Knights, and a free  participation in their rights, privileges, and immunities. Thereupon  Mr Tappertit flourished the bone again, and giving the other skull a  prodigious rap on the nose, exclaimed 'Admit him!' At these dread words  the 'prentice bowed once more, and so withdrew as he had come.    There soon appeared at the same door, two other 'prentices, having  between them a third, whose eyes were bandaged, and who was attired in a  bag-wig, and a broad-skirted coat, trimmed with tarnished lace; and who  was girded with a sword, in compliance with the laws of the Institution  regulating the introduction of candidates, which required them to  assume this courtly dress, and kept it constantly in lavender, for  their convenience. One of the conductors of this novice held a rusty  blunderbuss pointed towards his ear, and the other a very ancient  sabre, with which he carved imaginary offenders as he came along in a  sanguinary and anatomical manner.    As this silent group advanced, Mr Tappertit fixed his hat upon his head.  The novice then laid his hand upon his breast and bent before him. When  he had humbled himself sufficiently, the captain ordered the bandage to  be removed, and proceeded to eye him over.    'Ha!' said the captain, thoughtfully, when he had concluded this ordeal.  'Proceed.'    The long comrade read aloud as follows:--'Mark Gilbert. Age, nineteen.  Bound to Thomas Curzon, hosier, Golden Fleece, Aldgate. Loves Curzon's  daughter. Cannot say that Curzon's daughter loves him. Should think it  probable. Curzon pulled his ears last Tuesday week.'    'How!' cried the captain, starting.    'For looking at his daughter, please you,' said the novice.    'Write Curzon down, Denounced,' said the captain. 'Put a black cross  against the name of Curzon.'    'So please you,' said the novice, 'that's not the worst--he calls his  'prentice idle dog, and stops his beer unless he works to his liking. He  gives Dutch cheese, too, eating Cheshire, sir, himself; and Sundays out,  are only once a month.'    'This,' said Mr Tappert gravely, 'is a flagrant case. Put two black  crosses to the name of Curzon.'    'If the society,' said the novice, who was an ill-looking, one-sided,  shambling lad, with sunken eyes set close together in his head--'if the  society would burn his house down--for he's not insured--or beat him  as he comes home from his club at night, or help me to carry off his  daughter, and marry her at the Fleet, whether she gave consent or no--'    Mr Tappertit waved his grizzly truncheon as an admonition to him not to  interrupt, and ordered three black crosses to the name of Curzon.    'Which means,' he said in gracious explanation, 'vengeance, complete and  terrible. 'Prentice, do you love the Constitution?'    To which the novice (being to that end instructed by his attendant  sponsors) replied 'I do!'    'The Church, the State, and everything established--but the masters?'  quoth the captain.    Again the novice said 'I do.'    Having said it, he listened meekly to the captain, who in an address  prepared for such occasions, told him how that under that same  Constitution (which was kept in a strong box somewhere, but where  exactly he could not find out, or he would have endeavoured to procure a  copy of it), the 'prentices had, in times gone by, had frequent holidays  of right, broken people's heads by scores, defied their masters, nay,  even achieved some glorious murders in the streets, which privileges  had gradually been wrested from them, and in all which noble aspirations  they were now restrained; how the degrading checks imposed upon them  were unquestionably attributable to the innovating spirit of the times,  and how they united therefore to resist all change, except such change  as would restore those good old English customs, by which they would  stand or fall. After illustrating the wisdom of going backward, by  reference to that sagacious fish, the crab, and the not unfrequent  practice of the mule and donkey, he described their general objects;  which were briefly vengeance on their Tyrant Masters (of whose grievous  and insupportable oppression no 'prentice could entertain a moment's  doubt) and the restoration, as aforesaid, of their ancient rights and  holidays; for neither of which objects were they now quite ripe, being  barely twenty strong, but which they pledged themselves to pursue with  fire and sword when needful. Then he described the oath which every  member of that small remnant of a noble body took, and which was of a  dreadful and impressive kind; binding him, at the bidding of his chief,  to resist and obstruct the Lord Mayor, sword-bearer, and chaplain; to  despise the authority of the sheriffs; and to hold the court of aldermen  as nought; but not on any account, in case the fulness of time should  bring a general rising of 'prentices, to damage or in any way disfigure  Temple Bar, which was strictly constitutional and always to be  approached with reverence. Having gone over these several heads with  great eloquence and force, and having further informed the novice that  this society had its origin in his own teeming brain, stimulated by a  swelling sense of wrong and outrage, Mr Tappertit demanded whether he  had strength of heart to take the mighty pledge required, or whether he  would withdraw while retreat was yet in his power.    To this the novice made rejoinder, that he would take the vow, though  it should choke him; and it was accordingly administered with many  impressive circumstances, among which the lighting up of the two skulls  with a candle-end inside of each, and a great many flourishes with  the bone, were chiefly conspicuous; not to mention a variety of grave  exercises with the blunderbuss and sabre, and some dismal groaning by  unseen 'prentices without. All these dark and direful ceremonies  being at length completed, the table was put aside, the chair of state  removed, the sceptre locked up in its usual cupboard, the doors of  communication between the three cellars thrown freely open, and the  'Prentice Knights resigned themselves to merriment.    But Mr Tappertit, who had a soul above the vulgar herd, and who, on  account of his greatness, could only afford to be merry now and then,  threw himself on a bench with the air of a man who was faint with  dignity. He looked with an indifferent eye, alike on skittles, cards,  and dice, thinking only of the locksmith's daughter, and the base  degenerate days on which he had fallen.    'My noble captain neither games, nor sings, nor dances,' said his host,  taking a seat beside him. 'Drink, gallant general!'    Mr Tappertit drained the proffered goblet to the dregs; then thrust  his hands into his pockets, and with a lowering visage walked among the  skittles, while his followers (such is the influence of superior genius)  restrained the ardent ball, and held his little shins in dumb respect.    'If I had been born a corsair or a pirate, a brigand, genteel highwayman  or patriot--and they're the same thing,' thought Mr Tappertit, musing  among the nine-pins, 'I should have been all right. But to drag out a  ignoble existence unbeknown to mankind in general--patience! I will be  famous yet. A voice within me keeps on whispering Greatness. I shall  burst out one of these days, and when I do, what power can keep me down?  I feel my soul getting into my head at the idea. More drink there!'    'The novice,' pursued Mr Tappertit, not exactly in a voice of thunder,  for his tones, to say the truth were rather cracked and shrill--but very  impressively, notwithstanding--'where is he?'    'Here, noble captain!' cried Stagg. 'One stands beside me who I feel is  a stranger.'    'Have you,' said Mr Tappertit, letting his gaze fall on the party  indicated, who was indeed the new knight, by this time restored to his  own apparel; 'Have you the impression of your street-door key in wax?'    The long comrade anticipated the reply, by producing it from the shelf  on which it had been deposited.    'Good,' said Mr Tappertit, scrutinising it attentively, while a  breathless silence reigned around; for he had constructed secret  door-keys for the whole society, and perhaps owed something of his  influence to that mean and trivial circumstance--on such slight  accidents do even men of mind depend!--'This is easily made. Come  hither, friend.'    With that, he beckoned the new knight apart, and putting the pattern in  his pocket, motioned to him to walk by his side.    'And so,' he said, when they had taken a few turns up and down, you--you  love your master's daughter?'    'I do,' said the 'prentice. 'Honour bright. No chaff, you know.'    'Have you,' rejoined Mr Tappertit, catching him by the wrist, and  giving him a look which would have been expressive of the most deadly  malevolence, but for an accidental hiccup that rather interfered with  it; 'have you a--a rival?'    'Not as I know on,' replied the 'prentice.    'If you had now--' said Mr Tappertit--'what would you--eh?--'    The 'prentice looked fierce and clenched his fists.    'It is enough,' cried Mr Tappertit hastily, 'we understand each other.  We"]]]
