Then Drake gave every  Spanish officer and man a personal gift proportioned to his rank, put  all his accumulated prisoners aboard the emptied treasure ship, wished  them a prosperous voyage and better luck next time, furnished the brave  Don Anton with a letter of protection in case he should fall in with an  English vessel, and, after many expressions of goodwill on both sides,  sailed north, the voyage 'made'; while the poor 'spit-silver' treasure  ship turned sadly east and steered for Panama.    Lima, Panama, and Nombre de Dios were in wild commotion at the news; and  every sailor and soldier that the Spaniards had was going to and fro,  uncertain whether to attack or to defend, and still more distracted as  to the most elusive English whereabouts. One good Spanish captain, Don  Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, was all for going north, his instinct telling  him that Drake would not come back among the angry bees after stealing  all the honey. But, by the time the Captain-General of New Spain had  made up his mind to take one of the many wrong directions he had been  thinking of, Drake was already far on his way north to found New Albion.    Drake's triumph over all difficulties had won the hearts of his men more  than ever before, while the capture of the treasure ship had done  nothing to loosen the bonds of discipline. Don Francisco de Zarate wrote  a very intimate account of his experience as a prisoner on board the  _Golden Hind._ 'The English captain is one of the greatest mariners at  sea, alike from his skill and his powers of command. His ship is a very  fast sailer and her men are all skilled hands of warlike age and so well  trained that they might be old soldiers of the Italian tertias,' the  crack corps of the age in Spanish eyes. 'He is served with much plate  and has all possible kinds of delicacies and scents, many of which he  says the Queen of England gave him. None of the gentlemen sit or cover  in his presence without first being ordered to do so. They dine and sup  to the music of violins. His galleon carries about thirty guns and a  great deal of ammunition.' This was in marked contrast to the common  Spanish practice, even on the Atlantic side. The greedy exploiters of  New Spain grudged every ton of armament and every well-trained fighting  sailor, both on account of the expense and because this form of  protection took up room they wished to fill with merchandise. The result  was, of course, that they lost more by capture than they gained by  evading the regulation about the proper armament. 'His ship is not only  of the very latest type but sheathed.' Before copper sheathing was  invented some generations later, the Teredo worm used to honeycomb  unprotected hulls in the most dangerous way. John Hawkins invented the  sheathing used by Drake: a good thick tar-and-hair sheeting clamped on  with elm.    Northwest to Coronado, then to Aguatulco, then fifteen hundred miles due  west, brought Drake about that distance west-by-south of the modern San  Francisco. Here he turned east-north-east and, giving the land a wide  berth, went on to perhaps the latitude of Vancouver Island, always  looking for the reverse way through America by the fabled Northwest  Passage. Either there was the most extraordinary June ever known in  California and Oregon, or else the narratives of those on board have all  been hopelessly confused, for freezing rain is said to have fallen on  the night of June the 3d in the latitude of 42 deg.. In 48 deg. 'there followed  most vile, thick, and stinking fogs' with still more numbing cold. The  meat froze when taken off the fire. The wet rigging turned to icicles.  Six men could hardly do the work of three. Fresh from the tropics, the  crews were unfit for going any farther. A tremendous nor'wester settled  the question, anyway; and Drake ran south to 38 deg. 30', where, in what is  now Drake's Bay, he came to anchor just north of San Francisco.    Not more than once, if ever at all, and that a generation earlier, had  Europeans been in northern California. The Indians took the Englishmen  for gods whom they knew not whether to love or fear. Drake with the  essential kindliness of most, and the magnetic power of all, great born  commanders, soon won the natives' confidence. But their admiration 'as  men ravished in their minds' was rather overpowering; for, after 'a kind  of most lamentable weeping and crying out,' they came forward with  various offerings for the new-found gods, prostrating themselves in  humble adoration and tearing their breasts and faces in a wild desire to  show the spirit of self-sacrifice. Drake and his men, all Protestants,  were horrified at being made what they considered idols. So kneeling  down, they prayed aloud, raising hands and eyes to Heaven, hoping  thereby to show the heathen where the true God lived. Drake then read  the Bible and all the Englishmen sang Psalms, the Indians, 'observing  the end of every pause, with one voice still cried _Oh!_ greatly  rejoicing in our exercises.' As this impromptu service ended the Indians  gave back all the presents Drake had given them and retired in attitudes  of adoration.    In three days more they returned, headed by a Medicine-man, whom the  English called the 'mace-bearer.' With the slow and stately measure of a  mystic dance this great high priest of heathen rites advanced chanting a  sort of litany. Both litany and dance were gradually taken up by tens,  by hundreds, and finally by all the thousands of the devotees, who  addressed Drake with shouts of _Hyoh!_ and invested him with a headdress  of rare plumage and a necklace of quaint beads. It was, in fact, a  native coronation without a soul to doubt the divine right of their new  king. Drake's Protestant scruples were quieted by thinking 'to what good  end God had brought this to pass, and what honour and profit it might  bring to our country in time to come. So, in the name and to the use of  her most excellent Majesty, he took the sceptre, crown, and dignity' and  proclaimed an English protectorate over the land he called New Albion.  He then set up a brass plate commemorating this proclamation, and put an  English coin in the middle so that the Indians might see Elizabeth's  portrait and armorial device.    The exaltation of the ecstatic devotees continued till the day he left.  They crowded in to be cured by the touch of his hand--those were the  times in which the sovereign was expected to cure the King's Evil by a  touch. They also expected to be cured by inhaling the divine breath of  any one among the English gods. The chief narrator adds that the gods  who pleased the Indians most, braves and squaws included, 'were commonly  the youngest of us,' which shows that the human was not quite forgotten  in the all-divine. When the time for sailing came, the devotees were  inconsolable. 'They not only in a sudden did lose all mirth, joy, glad  countenance, pleasant speeches, agility of body, and all pleasure, but,  with sighs and sorrowings, they poured out woefull complayntes and moans  with bitter tears, and wringing of their hands, and tormenting of  themselves.' The last the English saw of them was the whole devoted  tribe assembled on the hill around a sacrificial fire, whence they  implored their gods to bring their heaven back to earth.    From California Drake sailed to the Philippines; and then to the  Moluccas, where the Portuguese had, if such a thing were possible,  outdone even the Spaniards in their fiendish dealings with the natives.  Lopez de Mosquito--viler than his pestilential name--had murdered the  Sultan, who was then his guest, chopped up the body, and thrown it into  the sea. Baber, the Sultan's son, had driven out the Portuguese from the  island of Ternate and was preparing to do likewise from the island of  Tidore, when Drake arrived. Baber then offered Drake, for Queen  Elizabeth, the complete monopoly of the trade in spices if only Drake  would use the _Golden Hind_ as the flagship against the Portuguese.  Drake's reception was full of Oriental state; and Sultan Baber was so  entranced by Drake's musicians that he sat all afternoon among them in a  boat towed by the _Golden Hind_. But it was too great a risk to take a  hand in this new war with only fifty-six men left. So Drake traded for  all the spices he could stow away and concluded a sort of understanding  which formed the sheet anchor of English diplomacy in Eastern seas for  another century to come. Elizabeth was so delighted with this result  that she gave Drake a cup (still at the family seat of Nutwell Court in  Devonshire) engraved with a picture of his reception by the Sultan Baber  of Ternate.    Leaving Ternate, the _Golden Hind_ beat to and fro among the tortuous  and only half-known channels of the Archipelago till the 9th of January,  1580, when she bore away before a roaring trade wind with all sail set  and, so far as Drake could tell, a good clear course for home. But  suddenly, without a moment's warning, there was a most terrific shock.  The gallant ship reared like a stricken charger, plunged forward,  grinding her trembling hull against the rocks, and then lay pounding out  her life upon a reef. Drake and his men at once took in half the  straining sails; then knelt in prayer; then rose to see what could be  done by earthly means. To their dismay there was no holding ground on  which to get an anchor fast and warp the vessel off. The lead could find  no bottom anywhere aft. All night long the _Golden Hind_ remained fast  caught in this insidious death-trap. At dawn Parson Fletcher preached a  sermon and administered the Blessed Sacrament. Then Drake ordered ten  tons overboard--cannon, cloves, and provisions.

The belief of the noble-minded man in the eternal continuance of his  activity, even upon this earth, is based, accordingly, on the hope  for the eternal continuance of the nation from which he has himself  developed, and of its individuality in accordance with that hidden  law, without intermixture and corruption by any alien element and  by what does not appertain to the totality of this legislation.  This individuality is the permanent element to which he intrusts the  eternity of himself and of his continued action--the eternal order  of things in which he lays his perpetuity. He must desire its  continuance, for it is alone the releasing agency whereby the brief  span of his life here is extended to a continuous life upon the earth.  His belief and his endeavor to plant what shall not pass away, and  the concept in which he comprehends his own life as an eternal life,  constitute the bond which most intimately associates with himself,  first, his own nation and, through that, the entire human race--which  brings the needs of them all, to the end of time, into his broadened  heart. This is his love for his nation, and through it, first, he  respects, trusts, rejoices in it, and takes pride in his descent from  it; the Divine has appeared in it, and has deigned to make it his  covering and his means of direct communication with the world; the  Divine, therefore, will continue to break forth from it. Therefore  man is, secondly, active, efficacious, and self-sacrificing for his  nation. Life, simply as life, as a continuance of changing existence,  has certainly never possessed value for him apart from this--he has  desired it merely as the source of the permanent. This permanence,  however, alone promises him the independent continuance of the  existence of his nation; and to save this he must even be willing to  die that it may live, and that in it he may live the only life that  has ever been possible to him.    Thus it is. Love, to be really love, and not merely a transitory  desire, never clings to the perishable, but is awakened and kindled  by, and based upon, the eternal only. Man is not even able to love  himself unless he consider himself as eternal; moreover, he cannot  even esteem and approve himself. Still less can he love anything  outside himself, except, that is, that he receive it within the  eternity of his belief and of his soul, and connect it with this  eternity. He who does not, first of all, regard himself as eternal,  has no love whatever, nor can he, moreover, love a fatherland, since  nothing of the sort exists for him. It is true that he who, perchance,  regards his invisible life as eternal, but who does not, therefore,  esteem his visible life as eternal in the same sense, may perhaps  have a heaven, and in this his fatherland, but here on earth he has no  fatherland; for this also is seen only under the metaphor of eternity  and, indeed, of visible eternity, rendered perceptible to the senses;  moreover, he cannot, therefore, love his fatherland. If such a man has  none, he is to be pitied; but he to whom one has been given, and  in whose soul heaven and earth, the invisible and the visible,  interpenetrate, and thus for the first time create a true and worthy  heaven, fights to the last drop of his blood again to transmit the  precious possession undiminished to posterity.    Thus has it been from time immemorial, though it has not been  expressed from time immemorial with this generality and with this  clearness. What inspired the noble spirits among the Romans, whose  sentiments and mode of thought still live and breathe among us in  their monuments, to struggle and to sacrifice, to endure and be  patient, for their fatherland? They themselves state it frequently and  clearly. It was their firm belief in the eternal continuance of their  Rome, and their confident expectation of themselves continuing to live  in this eternity. In so far as this conviction had foundation, and  in so far as they themselves would have grasped it if they had been  perfectly clear within themselves, it never deceived them.    Unto this day what was really eternal in their eternal Rome lives on  and they with it in our midst, and it will continue to live, in its  results, until the end of time.    In this sense--as the vehicle and the pledge of earthly eternity,  and the interpretation of the eternal here--nation and fatherland  far transcend the State in the ordinary sense of the term social  organization, as this is conceived in its simple, clear connotation,  and as it is founded and maintained in accordance with this  conception--a conception which demands sure justice and internal  peace, and requires that every one through his efforts obtain his  support and the prolongation of his sentient existence so long as God  will grant it to him. All this is only a means, a condition, and a  scaffolding of what patriotism really means--the development of the  eternal and the divine in the world, which is ever to become purer,  more perfect in infinite progression. For that very reason this  patriotism must, first of all, rule the State itself as absolutely the  highest, ultimate, and independent authority, by limiting it in the  choice of means for its immediate purpose--inner peace. To reach this  goal, the natural freedom of the individual must be limited in many  ways, it is true; and if this were absolutely the only consideration  and intention regarding them, it would be well to restrict this  liberty as closely as possible, in order to bring all their movements  under one uniform rule, and to keep them under constant supervision.  Granted that such severity be necessary, it could at least do no harm  for this single end; only the higher concept of the human race and of  the nations widens this limited view. Even in the manifestations  of external life freedom is the soil in which the higher culture  germinates; a legislation which keeps this later aim in view will give  the broadest possible scope to freedom, even at the risk that a less  degree of uniform quiet and calm may result, and that government may  become a little more difficult and laborious.    To elucidate this by an example--it has been known to happen that  nations have been told to their faces that they did not require as  much freedom as many other nations do. This statement might, indeed,  be dictated by forbearance and a desire to palliate, the true meaning  being that they were utterly unable to endure so great freedom and  that only a high degree of rigidity could prevent them from destroying  one another. If, however, the words are taken as they are spoken,  they are true under the presupposition that such a nation is entirely  incapable of the natural life and of the impulse toward it. Such a  nation--in case such a one, in which some few of the nobler sort did  not make an exception to the general rule, were possible--would indeed  require no freedom whatever, since this is only for the higher ends  which transcend the State; it requires simply taming and training in  order that the individuals may live peaceably side by side, and that  the whole may be made an efficient means for arbitrary ends which  lie outside its proper sphere. We need not decide whether this may  truthfully be said of any nation whatever; but this much is clear,  that a primitive nation requires freedom, that this freedom is the  pledge of its persistence as a primitive people, and that, as it  continues, it bears, without any danger, an ever ascending degree of  freedom. And this is the first example of the necessity of patriotism  governing the state itself.    It must, then, be patriotism which governs the state in that it sets  for it itself a higher end than the ordinary one of the maintenance of  the internal peace, of the property, of the personal freedom, of the  life, and of the well-being of all. Solely for this higher end, and  with no other intention, the state assembles an armed force. When the  problem of the application of this armed force arises, when it is  a question of hazarding all the aims of the state in the  abstract-property, personal freedom, life, welfare, and the  continuance of the state itself--when, answerable to God alone, they  are called upon to decide without a clear and rational conception of  the sure attainment of the end in view, which in matters of this sort  it is never possible to gain--then only the true primitive life holds  the rudder of the state, and here for the first time enters the true  sovereign right of the government, like God, to imperil the lower  life for the sake of the higher. In the maintenance of the traditional  organization, of the laws, and of civic welfare, there is absolutely  no genuine life and no primitive decision. Circumstances and  situations, legislators who have perhaps long been dead, have created  those things; succeeding ages go trustingly forward in the road they  have entered, and thus, as a matter of fact, they do not live a public  life of their own, but merely repeat a former. In such periods there  is no need of a real government. If, however, this uniform progress  is imperiled, and the problem arises of deciding with reference to  new cases, then a life is required which has its roots in itself. What  spirit is it, now, which in such cases may take its place at the helm,  which is able to decide with individual certainty and without uneasy  wavering, and which has an indubitable right authoritatively to lay  demands upon every one who may be concerned, whether he will or not,  and to compel the recalcitrant to imperil everything, even to his  life? Not the spirit of calm civilian love for the constitution and  the laws, but the burning flame of the higher patriotism which regards  the"]]]
