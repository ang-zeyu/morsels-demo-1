Perfectly hardy, and of free,  almost rampant growth in any but the stiffest soils. Cuttings root  freely and grow rapidly.      LIGUSTRUM.    LIGUSTRUM IBOTA (_syn L. amurense_).--Japan, 1861. A compact growing  species, about 3 feet in height, with small spikes of pure white flowers  produced freely during the summer months.    L. JAPONICUM (_syns L. glabrum, L. Kellennanni, L. Sieboldii_ and _L.  syringaeflorum_).--Japan Privet. This is a dwarf-growing species rarely  exceeding 4 feet in height, with broad, smooth, glossy-green leaves, and  large compound racemes of flowers. There are several varieties,  including L. japonicum microphyllum, with smaller leaves than the  parent; and one with tricoloured foliage and named L. japonicum  variegatum.    L. LUCIDUM (_syns L. magnoliaefolium_ and _L. strictum_).--Shining-leaved  Privet, or Woa Tree. China, 1794. A pretty evergreen species, with oval  leaves, and terminal, thyrsoid panicles of white flowers. It is an old  inhabitant of our gardens, and forms a somewhat erect, twiggy bush, of  fully 10 feet in height. Of this there are two varieties, one with  larger bunches of flowers, and named L. lucidum floribundum, and another  with variegated leaves, L. lucidum variegatum. L. lucidum coriaceum  (Leathery-leaved Privet) is a distinct variety, with thick,  leathery-green leaves, and dense habit of growth.    L. OVALIFOLIUM (_syn L. californicum_).--Oval-leaved Privet. Japan,  1877. This is a commonly-cultivated species, with semi-evergreen leaves,  and spikes of yellowish-white flowers. It is a good hedge plant, and  succeeds well as a town shrub. There are several variegated forms, of  which L. ovalifolium variegatum (Japan, 1865) and L. ovalifolium aureum  are the best.    L. QUIHOI.--China, 1868. This is a much valued species, as it does not  flower until most of its relations have finished. Most of the Privets  flower at mid-summer, but this species is often only at its best by the  last week of October and beginning of November. It forms a straggling  freely-branched shrub, of fully 6 feet in height and nearly as much  through, with dark shining-green oblong leaves, and loose terminal  panicles of pure white, powerfully-scented flowers. It flourishes, like  most of the Privets, on poor soil, and is a little-known species that  note should be made of during the planting season.    L. SINENSE (_syns L. villosum_ and _L. Ibota villosum_).--Chinese  Privet. China, 1858. This is a tall deciduous shrub, with oblong and  tomentose leaves, and flowers in loose, terminal panicles and produced  freely in August. L. sinense nanum is one of the prettiest forms in  cultivation. It is almost evergreen, with a horizontal mode of growth,  and dense spikes of crearny-white flowers, so thickly produced as almost  to hide the foliage from view. It is a most distinct and desirable  variety.    L. VULGARE.--Common Privet. Although one of our commonest shrubs, this  Privet can hardly be passed unnoticed, for the spikes of creamy-white  flowers, that are deliciously scented, are both handsome and effective.  Of the common Privet there are several distinct and highly ornamental  forms, such as L. vulgare variegatum, L. vulgare pendulum, having  curiously-creeping branches, and the better-known and valuable L.  vulgare sempervirens (_syn L. italicum_), the Italian Privet.      LINNAEA.    LINNAEA BOREALIS.--Twin Flower. A small and elegant, much-creeping  evergreen shrub, with small, ovate crenate leaves, and pairs of very  fragrant, pink flowers. Two conditions are necessary for its  cultivation--a half-shaded aspect where bottom moisture is always  present, and a deep, rich, friable loam. A native of Scotland and  England, flowering in July.      LIPPIA.    LIPPIA CITRIODORA (_syns Aloysia citriodora_ and _Verbena  triphylla_).--Lemon-scented Verbena. Chili, 1794. With its slender  branches and pale green, pleasantly-scented, linear leaves, this little  plant is a general favourite that needs no description. The flowers are  not very ornamental, being white or lilac, and produced in small,  terminal panicles. A native of Chili, it is not very hardy, but grown  against a sunny wall, and afforded the protection of a mat in winter,  with a couple of shovelfuls of cinders heaped around the stem, it passes  through the most severe weather with little or no injury, save, in some  instances, the branch tips being killed back. Propagated readily from  cuttings placed in a cool frame or under a hand-light.      LIRIODENDRON.    LIRIODENDRON TULIPIFERA.--Tulip Tree. North America, 1688. One of the  noblest hardy exotic trees in cultivation. The large, four-lobed,  truncate leaves, of a soft and pleasing green, are highly ornamental,  and are alone sufficient to establish the identity of the tree. Flowers  large, yellow, and sweet-scented, and usually freely produced when the  tree has attained to a height of between 20 feet and 30 feet. When we  consider the undoubted hardihood of the tree and indifference to soil,  its noble aspect, handsome foliage that is so distinct from that of any  other tree, and showy flowers, we feel justified in placing it in the  very first rank of ornamental trees. L. tulipifera integrifolia has  entire leaves, which render it distinct from the type; L. tulipifera  fastigiata, or pyramidalis, is of erect growth; L. tulipifera aurea,  with golden foliage; and L. tulipifera crispa, with the leaves curiously  undulated--a peculiarity which seems constant, but is more curious than  beautiful. Few soils come amiss to the Tulip Tree, it thriving well in  that of very opposite descriptions--loam, almost pure gravel, and  alluvial deposit.      LONICERA.    LONICERA CAPRIFOLIUM.--Europe. This species resembles L. Periclymenum,  but is readily distinguished by the sessile flower-heads, and  fawny-orange flowers.    L. FLEXUOSA (_syn L. brachypoda_).--Japan, 1806. This is a pretty  species, and one of the most useful of the climbing section. By its  slender, twining, purplish stems, it may at once be distinguished, as  also by the deep green, purplish-tinted leaves, and sweetly-scented  flowers of various shades of yellow and purple. A native of China, and  perfectly hardy as a wall plant. L. flexuosa aureo-reticulata is a  worthy variety, in which the leaves are beautifully netted or variegated  with yellow.    L. FRAGRANTISSIMA.--China, 1845. This species is often confounded with  L. Standishii, but differs in at least one respect, that the former is  strictly a climber, while the latter is of bushy growth. The leaves,  too, of L. Standishii are hairy, which is not the case with the other  species. It is a very desirable species, with white fragrant flowers,  produced during the winter season.    L. PERICLYMENUM.--Honeysuckle, or Woodbine. An indigenous climbing  shrub, with long, lithe, and twisted cable-like branches, and bearing  heads of sweetly-scented, reddish-yellow flowers. This is a favourite  wild plant, and in the profusion and fragrance of its flowers it is  surpassed by none of the exotic species. There are several distinct  nursery forms of this plant, including those known as L. Periclymenum  Late Dutch, L. Periclymenum Early Cream, and L. Periclymenum  odoratissimum; as also one with variegated foliage.    L. SEMPERVIRENS.--Scarlet Trumpet Honeysuckle. A North American  evergreen species (1656), with scarlet, almost inodorous flowers,  produced freely during the summer. For wall covering it is one of the  most useful of the family. The variety L. sempervirens minor is worthy  of attention.    L. STANDISHII, a Chinese species (1860), has deliciously fragrant while  flowers, with a slight purplish tint, and is well worthy of attention,  it soon forming a wall covering of great beauty.    L. TATARICA.---Tartarian Honeysuckle. Tartary, 1752. This is a very  variable species, in so far at least as the colour of flowers is  concerned, and has given rise to several handsome varieties. The typical  plant has rosy flowers, but the variety L. tatarica albiflora has pure  white flowers; and another, L. tatarica rubriflora has freely produced  purplish-red flowers.    L. XYLOSTEUM (_syn Xylosteum dumetorum_).--Fly Honeysuckle. Europe  (England) to the Caucasus. The small, creamy-white flowers of this plant  are not particularly showy, but the scarlet berries are more conspicuous  in September and October. The gray bark of the branches has also a  distinct effect in winter when grown in contrast to the red-barked  species of Cornus, Viburnum, and yellow-barked Osier. It is one of the  oldest occupants of British shrubberies. L. Xylosteum leucocarpum has  white berries; those of L. Xylosteum melanocarpum are black; and in L.  Xylosteum xanthocarpum they are yellow.    The Honeysuckles are all of the readiest culture, and succeed well in  very poor soils, and in that of opposite qualities. Propagated from  cuttings or by layering.      LOROPETALON.    LOROPETALON CHINENSE.--Khasia Mountains and China, 1880. This is a  pretty and interesting shrub belonging to the more familiar Witch Hazel  family. Flowers clustered in small heads, the calyx pale green, and the  long linear petals almost pure white. Being quite hardy, and interesting  as well as ornamental, should insure this Chinese shrub a place in every  good collection.      LYCIUM.    LYCIUM BARBARUM.--Box Thorn, or Tea Tree. North Asia, 1696. A pretty  lax, trailing shrub, with long, slender, flexible twigs, small  linear-lanceolate leaves, and rather sparsely-produced lilac or violet  flowers. Planted against a wall, or beside a stout-growing, open-habited  shrub, where the peculiarly lithe branches can find support, this plant  does best. Probably nowhere is the Box Thorn so much at home as in  seaside places, it then attaining to sometimes 12 feet in height, and  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10885"],[0,"Stories from the Italian Poets: with Lives of the Writers, Volume 1 (#17)"],[1,"s. Dante  at first looked eagerly down into the gulf, like one who feels that he  shall turn away instantly out of the very horror that attracts him.  \"See--look behind thee!\" said Virgil, dragging him at the same time from  the place where he stood, to a covert behind a crag. Dante looked round,  and beheld a devil coming up with a newly-arrived sinner across his  shoulders, whom he hurled into the lake, and then dashed down after him,  like a mastiff let loose on a thief. It was a man from Lucca, where  every soul was a false dealer except Bonturo.[29] The devil called out  to other devils, and a heap of them fell upon the wretch with hooks as  he rose to the surface; telling him, that he must practise there in  secret, if he practised at all; and thrusting him back into the boiling  pitch, as cooks thrust back flesh into the pot. The devils were of the  lowest and most revolting habits, of which they made disgusting jest and  parade.    Some of them, on a sudden, perceived Dante and his guide, and were going  to seize them, when Virgil resorted to his usual holy rebuke. For a  while they let him alone; and Dante saw one of them haul a sinner out of  the pitch by the clotted locks, and hold him up sprawling like an otter.  The rest then fell upon him and flayed him.    It was Ciampolo, a peculator in the service of the good Thiebault, king  of Navarre. One of his companions under the pitch was Friar Gomita,  governor of Gallura; and another, Michael Zanche, also a Sardinian.  Ciampolo ultimately escaped by a trick out of the hands of the devils,  who were so enraged that they turned upon the two pilgrims; but Virgil,  catching up Dante with supernatural force, as a mother does a child in  a burning house, plunged with him out of their jurisdiction into the  borders of gulf the sixth, the region of Hypocrites.    The hypocrites, in perpetual tears, walked about in a wearisome and  exhausted manner, as if ready to faint. They wore huge cowls, which hung  over their eyes, and the outsides of which were gilded, but the insides  of lead. Two of them had been rulers of Florence; and Dante was  listening to their story, when his attention was called off by the sight  of a cross, on which Caiaphas the High Priest was writhing, breathing  hard all the while through his beard with sighs. It was his office to  see that every soul which passed him, on its arrival in the place, was  oppressed with the due weight. His father-in-law, Annas, and all his  council, were stuck in like manner on crosses round the borders of the  gulf. The pilgrims beheld little else in this region of weariness, and  soon passed into the borders of one of the most terrible portions of  Evil-budget, the land of the transformation of Robbers.    The place was thronged with serpents of the most appalling and unwonted  description, among which ran tormented the naked spirits of the  robbers, agonised with fear. Their hands were bound behind them with  serpents--their bodies pierced and enfolded with serpents. Dante saw one  of the monsters leap up and transfix a man through the nape of the neck;  when, lo! sooner than a pen could write _o_, or _i_, the sufferer burst  into flames, burnt up, fell to the earth a heap of ashes--was again  brought together, and again became a man, aghast with his agony, and  staring about him, sighing.[30] Virgil asked him who he was.    \"I was but lately rained down into this dire gullet,\" said the man,  \"amidst a shower of Tuscans. The beast Vanni Fucci am I, who led a  brutal life, like the mule that I was, in that den Pistoia.\"    \"Compel him to stop,\" said Dante, \"and relate what brought him hither. I  knew the bloody and choleric wretch when he was alive.\"    The sinner, who did not pretend to be deaf to these words, turned round  to the speaker with the most painful shame in his face, and said, \"I  feel more bitterly at being caught here by thee in this condition, than  when I first arrived. A power which I cannot resist compels me to let  thee know, that I am here because I committed sacrilege and charged  another with the crime; but now, mark me, that thou mayest hear  something not to render this encounter so pleasant: Pistoia hates thy  party of the Whites, and longs for the Blacks back again. It will have  them, and so will Florence; and there will be a bloody cloud shall burst  over the battlefield of Piceno, which will dash many Whites to the  earth. I tell thee this to make thee miserable.\"    So saying, the wretch gave a gesture of contempt with his thumb and  finger towards heaven, and said, \"Take it, God--a fig for thee!\" [31]    \"From that instant,\" said Dante, \"the serpents and I were friends; for  one of them throttled him into silence, and another dashed his hands  into a knot behind his back. O Pistoia! Pistoia! why art not thou  thyself turned into ashes, and swept from the face of the earth, since  thy race has surpassed in evil thine ancestors? Never, through the  whole darkness of hell, beheld I a blasphemer so dire as this--not even  Capaneus himself.\"    The Pistoian fled away with the serpents upon him, followed by a  Centaur, who came madly galloping up, crying, \"Where is the caitiff?\" It  was the monster-thief Cacus, whose den upon earth often had a pond of  blood before it, and to whom Hercules, in his rage, when he slew him,  gave a whole hundred blows with his club, though the wretch perceived  nothing after the ninth. He was all over adders up to the mouth; and  upon his shoulders lay a dragon with its wings open, breathing fire on  whomsoever it met.    The Centaur tore away; and Dante and Virgil were gazing after him, when  they heard voices beneath the bank on which they stood, crying, \"Who are  ye?\" The pilgrims turned their eyes downwards, and beheld three spirits,  one of whom, looking about him, said, \"Where's Cianfa?\" Dante made a  sign to Virgil to say nothing.    Cianfa came forth, a man lately, but now a serpent with six feet.[32]    \"If thou art slow to believe, reader, what I am about to tell thee,\"  says the poet, \"be so; it is no marvel; for I myself, even now, scarcely  credit what I beheld.\"    The six-footed serpent sprang at one of the three men front to front,  clasping him tightly with all its legs, and plunging his fangs into  either cheek. Ivy never stuck so close to a tree as the horrible monster  grappled with every limb of that pinioned man. The two forms then  gradually mingled into one another like melting wax, the colours of  their skin giving way at the same time to a third colour, as the white  in a piece of burning paper recedes before the brown, till it all  becomes black. The other two human shapes looked on, exclaiming,  \"Oh, how thou changest, Agnello! See, thou art neither two nor yet one.\"  And truly, though the two heads first became one, there still remained  two countenances in the face. The four arms then became but two, and  such also became the legs and thighs; and the two trunks became such a  body as was never beheld; and the hideous twofold monster walked slowly  away.[33]    A small black serpent on fire now flashed like lightning on to the body  of one of the other two, piercing him in the navel, and then falling on  the ground, and lying stretched before him. The wounded man, fascinated  and mute, stood looking at the adder's eyes, and endeavouring to stand  steady on his legs, yawning the while as if smitten with lethargy or  fever; the adder, on his part, looked up at the eyes of the man, and  both of them breathed hard, and sent forth a smoke that mingled into one  volume.    And now, let Lucan never speak more of the wretched Sabellus or  Nisidius, but listen and be silent; and now, let Ovid be silent, nor  speak again of his serpent that was Cadmus, or his fountain that was  Arethusa; for, says the Tuscan poet, I envy him not. Never did he change  the natures of two creatures face to face, so that each received the  form of the other.    With corresponding impulse, the serpent split his train into a fork,  while the man drew his legs together into a train; the skin of the  serpent grew soft, while the man's hardened; the serpent acquired  tresses of hair, the man grew hairless; the claws of the one projected  into legs, while the arms of the other withdrew into his shoulders; the  face of the serpent, as it rose from the ground, retreated towards the  temples, pushing out human ears; that of the man, as he fell to the  ground, thrust itself forth into a muzzle, withdrawing at the same time  its ears into its head, as the slug does its horns; and each creature  kept its impious eyes fixed on the other's, while the features beneath  the eyes were changing. The soul which had become the serpent then  turned to crawl away, hissing in scorn as he departed; and the serpent,  which had become the man, spat after him, and spoke words at him. The  new human-looking soul then turned his back on his late adversary, and  said to the third spirit, who remained unchanged, \"Let Buoso now take to  his crawl, as I have done.\"    The two then hastened away together, leaving Dante in a state of  bewildered amazement, yet not so confused but that he recognised the  unchanged one for another of his countrymen, Puccio the Lame. \"Joy to  thee, Florence!\" cried the poet; \"not content with having thy name  bruited over land and sea, it flourishes throughout hell.\"    The pilgrims now quitted the seventh, and looked down from its barrier  into the eighth gulf, where they saw innumerable flames, distinct from  one another, flickering all over the place like fire-flies.    \"In those flames,\" said Virgil, \"are souls, each tormented with the fire  that swathes it.\"    \"I observe one,\" said Dante, \"divided at the summit. Are the Theban  brothers in it?\"    \"No,\" replied Virgil; \"in that flame are Diomed and Ulysses.\" The  sinners punished in this gulf were Evil Counsellors; and those two were  the advisers of the stratagem of the Trojan horse.
