London:  Printed for the Author; and sold at Mrs. Ashburn's, a China Shop, the  Corner of Fleet Ditch. MDCCXLVII.\" The lady was no other than Mrs.  Glasse, wife of an attorney residing in Carey Street; and a very  sensible lady she was, and a very sensible and interesting book hers  is, with a preface showing that her aim was to put matters as plainly  as she could, her intention being to instruct the lower sort. \"For  example,\" says she, \"when I bid them lard a fowl, if I should bid them  lard with large lardoons they would not know what I meant; but when  I say they must lard with little pieces of Bacon, they know what  I mean.\" I have been greatly charmed with Hannah Glasse's \"Art of  Cookery,\" 1747, and with her \"Complete Confectioner\" likewise in a  modified degree. The latter was partly derived, she tells you, from  the manuscript of \"a very old experienced housekeeper to a family of  the first distinction.\" But, nevertheless, both are very admirable  performances; and yet the compiler survives scarcely more than in  an anecdote for which I can see no authority. For she does not say,  \"First catch your hare\" [Footnote: Mrs. Glasse's cookery book was  reprinted at least as late as 1824].    Mrs. Glasse represents that, before she undertook the preparation  of the volume on confectionery, there was nothing of the kind for  reference and consultation. But we had already a curious work by E.  Kidder, who was, according to his title-page, a teacher of the art  which he expounded eventually in print. The title is sufficiently  descriptive: \"E. Kidder's Receipts of Pastry and Cookery, for the use  of his Scholars, who teaches at his School in Queen Street, near St.  Thomas Apostle's, [Footnote: In another edition his school is in  St. Martin's Le Grand] on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, in the  afternoon. Also on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, in the afternoon,  at his School next to Furnivalls Inn in Holborn. Ladies may be taught  at their own Houses.\" It is a large octavo, consisting of fifty pages  of engraved text, and is embellished with a likeness of Mr. Kidder.  For all that Mrs. Glasse ignores him.    I have shown how Mrs. Glasse might have almost failed to keep a place  in the public recollection, had it not been for a remark which that  lady did not make. But there is a still more singular circumstance  connected with her and her book, and it is this--that in Dr. Johnson's  day, and possibly in her own lifetime, a story was current that the  book was really written by Dr. Hill the physician. That gentleman's  claim to the authorship has not, of course, been established, but at a  dinner at Dilly's the publisher's in 1778, when Johnson, Miss Seward,  and others were present, a curious little discussion arose on the  subject. Boswell thus relates the incident and the conversation:--\"The  subject of cookery having been very naturally introduced at a table,  where Johnson, who boasted of the niceness of his palate, avowed that  'he always found a good dinner,' he said, 'I could write a better book  about cookery than has ever yet been written; it should be a book  upon philosophical principles. Pharmacy is now made much more simple.  Cookery may be so too. A prescription, which is now compounded of five  ingredients, had formerly fifty in it. So in Cookery. If the nature of  the ingredients is well known, much fewer will do. Then, as you cannot  make bad meat good, I would tell what is the best butcher's meat,  the best beef, the best pieces; how to choose young fowls; the proper  seasons of different vegetables; and then how to roast, and boil, and  compound.\"    DILLY:--\"Mrs. Glasse's 'Cookery,' which is the best, was written by  Dr. Hill. Half the trade know this.\"    JOHNSON:--\"Well, Sir, that shews how much better the subject of  cookery may be treated by a philosopher. I doubt if the book be  written by Dr Hill; for in Mrs. Glasse's Cookery, which I have  looked into, saltpetre and salt-prunella are spoken of as different  substances, whereas salt-prunella is only saltpetre burnt on charcoal;  and Hill could not be ignorant of this. However, as the greatest part  of such a book is made by transcription, this mistake may have been  carelessly adopted. But you shall see what a book of cookery I could  make. I shall agree with Mr. Dilly for the copyright.\"    Miss SEWARD:--\"That would be Hercules with the distaff indeed!\"    JOHNSON:--\"No, Madam. Women can spin very well; but they cannot make a  good book of cookery.\"    But the Doctor's philosophical cookery book belongs to the voluminous  calendar of works which never passed beyond the stage of proposal; he  did not, so far as we know, ever draw out a title-page, as Coleridge  was fond of doing; and perhaps the loss is to be borne with. The  Doctor would have pitched his discourse in too high a key.    Among the gastronomical enlargements of our literature in the  latter half of the last century, one of the best books in point of  classification and range is that by B. Clermont, of which the third  edition made its appearance in 1776, the first having been anonymous.  Clermont states that he had been clerk of the kitchen in some of the  first families of the kingdom, and lately to the Earl of Abingdon. But  elsewhere we find that he had lived very recently in the establishment  of the Earl of Ashburnham, for he observes in the preface: \"I beg the  candour of the Public will excuse the incorrectness of the Language  and Diction. My situation in life as an actual servant to the Earl of  Ashburnham at the time of the first publication of this Book will I  trust plead my Apology.\" He informs his readers on the title-page, and  repeats in the preface, that a material part of the work consists of a  translation of \"Les Soupers de la Cour,\" and he proceeds to say,  that he does not pretend to make any further apology for the title of  _supper_, than that the French were, in general, more elegant in their  suppers than their dinners. In other words, the late dinner was still  called supper.    The writer had procured the French treatise from Paris for his own  use, and had found it of much service to him in his capacity as clerk  of the kitchen, and he had consequently translated it, under the  persuasion that it would prove an assistance to gentlemen, ladies,  and others interested in such matters. He specifies three antecedent  publications in France, of which his pages might be considered the  essence, viz., \"La Cuisine Royale,\" \"Le Maitre d'Hotel Cuisinier,\" and  \"Les Dons de Comus\"; and he expresses to some of his contemporaries,  who had helped him in his researches, his obligations in the following  terms:--\"As every country produces many Articles peculiar to itself,  and considering the Difference of Climates, which either forward or  retard them, I would not rely on my own Knowledge, in regard to such  Articles; I applied therefore to three Tradesmen, all eminent in their  Profession, one for Fish, one for Poultry, and one for the productions  of the Garden, viz., Mr. Humphrey Turner, the Manager in St. James's  Market; Mr. Andrews, Poulterer in ditto; and Mr. Adam Lawson, many  years chief gardener to the Earl of Ashburnham; in this article I  was also assisted by Mr. Rice, Green-Grocer, in St. Albans Street.\"  Clermont dates his remarks from Princes Street, Cavendish Square.    While Mrs. Glasse was still in the middle firmament of public favour,  a little book without the writer's name was published as by \"A Lady.\"  I have not seen the first or second editions; but the third appeared  in 1808. It is called \"A New System of Domestic Cookery, Formed upon  Principles of Economy, and Adapted to the use of Private Families.\"  The author was Helene Rundell, of whom I am unable to supply any  further particulars at present. Mrs. Rundell's cookery book, according  to the preface, was originally intended for the private instruction of  the daughters of the authoress in their married homes, and specially  prepared with an eye to housekeepers of moderate incomes. Mrs. Rundell  did not write for professed cooks, or with any idea of emolument; and  she declared that had such a work existed when she first set out in  life it would have been a great treasure to her. The public shared  the writer's estimate of her labours, and called for a succession  of impressions of the \"New System,\" till its run was checked by  Miss Acton's still more practical collection. Mrs. Rundell is little  consulted nowadays; but time was when Mrs. Glasse and herself were the  twin stars of the culinary empyrean.    Coming down to our own times, the names most familiar to our ears  are Ude, Francatelli, and Soyer, and they are the names of foreigners  [Footnote: A fourth work before me has no clue to the author, but  it is like the others, of an alien complexion. It is called \"French  Domestic Cookery, Combining Elegance and Economy. In twelve Hundred  Receipts, 12mo, 1846.\" Soyer's book appeared in the same year. In  1820, an anonymous writer printed a Latin poem of his own composition,  called \"Tabella Cibaria, a Bill of Fare, etc., etc., with Copious  Notes,\" which seem more important than the text]. No English school of  cookery can be said ever to have existed in England. We have, and  have always had, ample material for making excellent dishes; but if  we desire to turn it to proper account, we have to summon men from a  distance to our aid, or to accept the probable alternative--failure.  The adage, \"God sends meat, and the devil sends cooks,\" must surely  be of native parentage, for of no country is it so true as of our own.  Perhaps, had it not been for the influx among us of French and  Italian experts, commencing with our Anglo-Gallic relations under  the Plantagenets, and the palmy days of the monastic orders, culinary  science would not have arrived at the height of development which it  has attained in the face of great obstacles."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12296"],[0,"Camps and Trails in China (#17)"],[1,"poppy blossoms, are now yellow with corn. In all our 2000 miles of riding  over unfrequented trails and in the most out-of-the-way spots we found only  one instance where opium was being cultivated.    The mandarin of each district accompanied by a guard of soldiers makes  periodical excursions during the seasons when the poppy is in blossom, cuts  down the plants if any are found, and punishes the owners. China deserves  the greatest credit for so successfully dealing with a question which  affects such a large part of her four hundred millions of people and which  presents such unusual difficulties because of its economic importance.    Just across the frontier in Burma, opium is grown freely and much is  smuggled into Yün-nan. Therefore its use has by no means been abandoned,  especially in the south of the province, and in some towns it is smoked  openly in the tea houses. In August, 1916, just before we reached Yün-nan  Fu there was an _exposé_ of opium smuggling which throws an illuminating  side light on the corruption of some Chinese officials.    Opium can be purchased in Yün-nan Fu for two dollars (Mexican) an ounce,  while in Shanghai it is worth ten dollars (Mexican). Tang (the Military  Governor), the Minister of Justice, the Governor's brother and three  members of Parliament had collected six hundred pounds of opium which they  undertook to transfer to Shanghai.    Their request that no examination of their baggage be made by the French  during their passage through Tonking was granted, and a similar favor was  procured for them at Shanghai. Thus the sixty cases were safely landed, but  a few hours later, through the opium combine, foreign detectives learned of  the smuggling and the boxes were seized.    The Minister of Justice denied all knowledge of the opium, as did the three  Parliament members, and Governor Tang was not interrogated as that would be  quite contrary to the laws of Chinese etiquette; however, he will not  receive reappointment when his official term expires.    As we neared Ta-li Fu, and indeed along the entire road, we were amazed at  the prevalence of goitre. At a conservative estimate two out of every five  persons were suffering from the disease, some having two, or even three,  globules of uneven size hanging from their throats. In one village six out  of seven adults were affected, but apparently children under twelve or  fourteen years are free from it as we saw no evidences in either sex.  Probably the disease is in a large measure due to the drinking water, for  it is most prevalent in the limestone regions and seems to be somewhat  localized.    Every day we passed \"chairs,\" or as we named them, \"mountain schooners,\" in  each of which a fat Chinaman sprawled while two or four sweating coolies  bore him up hill. The chair is rigged between a pair of long bamboo poles  and consists of two sticks swung by ropes on which is piled a heap of  bedding. Overhead a light bamboo frame supports a piece of yellow oilcloth,  which completely shuts in the occupant, except from the front and rear.    The Chinese consider it undignified to walk, or even to ride, and if one is  about to make an official visit nothing less than a four-man chair is  required. Haste is just as much tabooed in the \"front families\" as physical  exertion, and is utterly incomprehensible to the Chinese. Major Davies says  that while he was in Tonking before the railroad to Yün-nan Fu had been  constructed, M. Doumer, the Governor-General of French Indo-China, who was  a very energetic man, rode to Yün-nan Fu in an extraordinarily short time.  While the Europeans greatly admired his feat, the Chinese believed he must  be in some difficulty from which only the immediate assistance of the  Viceroy of Yün-nan could extricate him.    In Yün-nan it is necessary to carry one's own bedding for the inns supply  nothing but food, and consequently when a Chinaman rides from one city to  another he piles a great heap of blankets on his horse's back and climbs on  top with his legs astride the animal's neck in front. The horses are  trained to a rapid trot instead of a gallop, and I know of no more  ridiculous sight than a Chinaman bouncing along a road on the summit of a  veritable mountain of bedding with his arms waving and streamers flying in  every direction. He is assisted in keeping his balance by broad brass  stirrups in which he usually hooks his heels and guides his horse by means  of a rawhide bridle decorated with dozens of bangles which make a  comforting jingle whenever he moves.    On the sixth day out when approaching the city of Chu-hsuing Fu we took a  short cut through the fields leaving the caravan to follow the main road.  The trail brought us to a river about forty feet wide spanned by a bridge  made from two narrow planks, with a wide median fissure. We led our horses  across without trouble and Heller started to follow. He had reached the  center of the bridge when his horse shied at the hole, jumped to one side,  hung suspended on his belly for a moment, and toppled off into the water.    The performance had all happened behind Heller's back and when he turned  about in time to see his horse diving into the river, he stood looking down  at him with a most ludicrous expression of surprise and disgust, while the  animal climbed out and began to graze as quietly as though nothing had  happened.    Chu-hsuing was interesting as being the home of Miss Cordelia Morgan, a  niece of Senator Morgan of Virginia. We found her to be a most charming and  determined young woman who had established a mission station in the city  under considerable difficulties. The mandarin and other officials by no  means wished to have a foreign lady, alone and unattended, settle down  among them and become a responsibility which might cause them endless  trouble, and although she had rented a house before she arrived, the owner  refused to allow her to move in.    She could get no assistance from the mandarin and was forced to live for  two months in a dirty Chinese inn, swarming with vermin, until they  realized that she was determined not to be driven away. She eventually  obtained a house and while she considers herself comfortable, I doubt if  others would care to share her life unless they had an equal amount of  determination and enthusiasm.    At that time she had not placed her work under the charge of a mission  board and was carrying it on independently. Until our arrival she had seen  but one white person in a year and a half, was living entirely upon Chinese  food, and had tasted no butter or milk in months.    We had a delightful dinner with Miss Morgan and the next morning as our  caravan wound down the long hill past her house she stood at the window to  wave good-by. She kept her head behind the curtains, and doubtless if we  could have seen her face we would have found tears upon it, for the evening  with another woman of her kind had brought to her a breath of the old life  which she had resolutely forsaken and which so seldom penetrated to her  self-appointed exile.    On our ninth day from Yün-nan Fu we had a welcome bit of excitement. We  were climbing a long mountain trail to a pass over eight thousand feet high  and were near the summit when a boy dashed breathlessly up to the caravan,  jabbering wildly in Chinese. It required fifteen minutes of questioning  before we finally learned that bandits had attacked a big caravan less than  a mile ahead of us and were even then ransacking the loads.    He said that there were two hundred and fifty of them and that they had  killed two _mafus_; almost immediately a second gesticulating Chinaman  appeared and gave the number as three hundred and fifty and the dead as  five. Allowing for the universal habit of exaggeration we felt quite sure  that there were not more than fifty, and subsequently learned that forty  was the correct number and that no one had been killed.    Our caravan was in a bad place to resist an attack but we got out our  rifles and made for a village at the top of the pass. There were not more  than a half dozen mud houses and in the narrow street between them perfect  bedlam reigned. Several small caravans had halted to wait for us, and men,  horses, loads, and chairs were packed and jammed together so tightly that  it seemed impossible ever to extricate them. Our arrival added to the  confusion, but leaving the _mafus_ to scream and chatter among themselves,  we scouted ahead to learn the true condition of affairs.    Almost within sight we found the caravan which had been robbed. Paper and  cloth were strewn about, loads overturned, and loose mules wandered over  the hillside. The frightened _mafus_ were straggling back and told us that  about forty bandits had suddenly surrounded the caravan, shooting and  brandishing long knives. Instantly the _mafus_ had run for their lives  leaving the brigands to rifle the packs unmolested. The goods chiefly  belonged to the retiring mandarin of Li-chiang, and included some five  thousand dollars worth of jade and gold dust, all of which was taken.    Yün-nan, like most of the outlying provinces of China, is infested with  brigands who make traveling very unsafe. There are, of course, organized  bands of robbers at all times, but these have been greatly augmented since  the rebellion by dismissed soldiers or deserters who have taken to  brigandage as the easiest means to avoid starvation.    The Chinese Government is totally unable to cope with the situation and  makes only half-hearted attempts to punish even the most flagrant  robberies, so that unguarded caravans carrying valuable material which  arrive at their destination unmolested consider themselves very lucky.    So far as our expedition was concerned we did not feel great apprehension  for it was generally known that we carried but little money and our  equipment, except for guns, could not readily be disposed of.
