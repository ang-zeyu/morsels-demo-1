And leisurely Jurgen advanced: there was no hurry, with weeks  wherein to accomplish everything: meanwhile this routine work had a  familiar pleasantness.    For the amateur co-ordinates matters, knowing that one thing  axiomatically leads to another. There is no harm at all in  respectful allusions to a love that comprehends its hopelessness: it  was merely a fact which Jurgen mentioned, and was about to pass on;  only Guenevere, in modesty, was forced to disparage her own  attractions, as an inadequate cause for so much misery. Common  courtesy demanded that Jurgen enter upon a rebuttal. To emphasize  one point in this, the orator was forced to take the hand of his  audience: but strangers did that every day, with nobody objecting;  moreover, the hand was here, not so much seized as displayed by its  detainer, as evidence of what he contended. How else was he to prove  the Princess of Glathion had the loveliest hand in the world? It was  not a matter he could request Guenevere to accept on hearsay: and  Jurgen wanted to deal fairly with her.    Well, but before relinquishing the loveliest hand in the world a  connoisseur will naturally kiss each fingertip: this is merely a  tribute to perfection, and has no personal application. Besides, a  kiss, wherever deposited, as Jurgen pointed out, is, when you think  of it, but a ceremonial, of no intrinsic wrongfulness. The girl  demurring against this apothegm--as custom again exacted,--was,  still in common fairness, convinced of her error. So now, says  Jurgen presently, you see for yourself. Is anything changed between  us? Do we not sit here, just as we were before? Why, to be sure! a  kiss is now attestedly a quite innocuous performance, with nothing  very fearful about it one way or the other. It even has its pleasant  side. Thus there is no need to make a pother over kisses or over an  arm about you, when it is more comfortable sitting so: how can one  reasonably deny to a sincere friend what is accorded to a cousin or  an old cloak? It would be nonsense, as Jurgen demonstrated with a  very apt citation from Napsacus.    Then, sitting so, in the heat of conversation a speaker naturally  gesticulates: and a deal of his eloquence is dependent upon his  hands. When anyone is talking it is discourteous to interrupt,  whereas to lay hold of a gentleman's hand outright, as Jurgen  parenthesized, is a little forward. No, he really did not think it  would be quite proper for Guenevere to hold his hand. Let us  preserve decorum, even in trifles.    \"Ah, but you know that you are doing wrong!\"    \"I doing wrong! I, who am simply sitting here and talking my poor  best in an effort to entertain you! Come now, Princess, but tell me  what you mean!\"    \"You should know very well what I mean.\"    \"But I protest to you I have not the least notion. How can I  possibly know what you mean when you refuse to tell me what you  mean?\"    And since the Princess declined to put into words just what she  meant, things stayed as they were, for the while.    Thus did Jurgen co-ordinate matters, knowing that one thing  axiomatically leads to another. And in short, affairs sped very much  as Jurgen had anticipated.    Now, by ordinary, Jurgen talked with Guenevere in dimly lighted  places. He preferred this, because then he was not bothered by that  unaccountable shadow whose presence in sunlight put him out. Nobody  ever seemed to notice this preposterous shadow; it was patent,  indeed, that nobody could see it save Jurgen: none the less, the  thing worried him. So even from the first he remembered Guenevere as  a soft voice and a delectable perfume in twilight, as a beauty not  clearly visioned.    And Gogyrvan's people worried him. The hook-nosed tall old King had  been by Jurgen dismissed from thought, as an enigma not important  enough to be worth the trouble of solving. Gogyrvan at once seemed  to be schooling himself to patience under some private annoyance and  to be revolving in his mind some private jest; he was queer, and  probably abominable: but to grant the old rascal his due, he was not  meddlesome.    The people about Gogyrvan, though, were perplexing. These men who  considered that all you possessed was loaned you to devote to the  service of your God, your King and every woman who crossed your  path, could hardly be behaving rationally. To talk of serving God  sounded as sonorously and as inspiritingly as a drum: yes, and a  drum had nothing but air in it. The priests said so-and-so: but did  anybody believe the gallant Bishop of Merion, for example, was  always to be depended upon?    \"I would like the opinion of Prince Evrawc's wife as to that,\" said  Jurgen, with a grin. For it was well-known that all affairs between  this Dame Alundyne and the Bishop were so discreetly managed as to  afford no reason for any scandal whatever.    As for serving the King, there in plain view was Gogyrvan Gawr, for  anyone who so elected, to regard and grow enthusiastic over:  Gogyrvan might be shrewd enough, but to Jurgen he suggested very  little of the Lord's anointed. To the contrary, he reminded you of  Jurgen's brother-in-law, the grocer, without being graced by the  tradesman's friendly interest in customers. Gogyrvan Gawr was a  person whom Jurgen simply could not imagine any intelligent Deity  selecting as steward. And finally, when it came to serving women,  what sort of service did women most cordially appreciate? Jurgen had  his answer pat enough, but it was an answer not suitable for  utterance in a mixed company.    \"No one of my honest opinions, in fact, is adapted to further my  popularity in Glathion, because I am a monstrous clever fellow who  does justice to things as they are. Therefore I must remember  always, in justice to myself, that I very probably hold traffic with  madmen. Yet Rome was a fine town, and it was geese who saved it.  These people may be right; and certainly I cannot go so far as to  say they are wrong: but still, at the same time--! Yes, that is how  I feel about it.\"    Thus did Jurgen abide at the chivalrous court of Glathion, and  conform to all its customs. In the matter of love-songs nobody  protested more movingly that the lady whom he loved (quite  hopelessly, of course), embodied all divine perfections: and when it  came to knightly service, the possession of Caliburn made the  despatching of thieves and giants and dragons seem hardly  sportsmanlike. Still, Jurgen fought a little, now and then, in order  to conform to the customs of Glathion: and the Duke of Logreus was  widely praised as a very promising young knight.    And all the while he fretted because he could just dimly perceive  that ideal which was served in Glathion, and the beauty of this  ideal, but could not possibly believe in it. Here was, again, a  loveliness perceived in twilight, a beauty not clearly visioned.    \"Yet am not I a monstrous clever fellow,\" he would console himself,  \"to take them all in so completely? It is a joke to which, I think,  I do full justice.\"    So Jurgen abode among these persons to whom life was a high-hearted  journeying homeward. God the Father awaited you there, ready to  punish at need, but eager to forgive, after the manner of all  fathers: that one became a little soiled in traveling, and sometimes  blundered into the wrong lane, was a matter which fathers  understood: meanwhile here was an ever-present reminder of His  perfection incarnated in woman, the finest and the noblest of His  creations. Thus was every woman a symbol to be honored magnanimously  and reverently. So said they all.    \"Why, but to be sure!\" assented Jurgen. And in support of his  position he very edifyingly quoted Ophelion, and Fabianus Papirius,  and Sextius Niger to boot.          15.    Of Compromises in Glathion      The tale records that it was not a great while before, in simple  justice to Guenevere, Duke Jurgen had afforded her the advantage of  frank conversation in actual privacy. For conventions have to be  regarded, of course. Thus the time of a princess is not her own, and  at any hour of day all sorts of people are apt to request an  audience just when some most improving conversation is progressing  famously: but the Hall of Judgment stood vacant and unguarded at  night.    \"But I would never consider doing such a thing,\" said Guenevere:  \"and whatever must you think of me, to make such a proposal!\"    \"That too, my dearest, is a matter which I can only explain in  private.\"    \"And if I were to report your insolence to my father--\"    \"You would annoy him exceedingly: and from such griefs it is our  duty to shield the aged.\"    \"And besides, I am afraid.\"    \"Oh, my dearest,\" says Jurgen, and his voice quavered, because his  love and his sorrow seemed very great to him: \"but, oh, my dearest,  can it be that you have not faith in me! For with all my body and  soul I love you, as I have loved you ever since I first raised your  face between my hands, and understood that I had never before known  beauty. Indeed, I love you as, I think, no man has ever loved any  woman that lived in the long time that is gone, for my love is  worship, and no less. The touch of your hand sets me to trembling,  dear; and the look of your gray eyes makes me forget there is  anything of pain or grief or evil anywhere: for you are the  loveliest thing God ever made, with joy in the new skill that had  come to His fingers. And you have not faith in me!\"    Then the Princess gave a little sobbing laugh of content and  repentance, and she clasped the hand of her grief-stricken lover.  \"Forgive me, Jurgen, for I cannot bear to see you so unhappy!\"    \"Ah, and what is my grief to you!\" he asks of her, bitterly.    \"Much, oh, very much, my dear!\" she whispered.    So in the upshot Jurgen was never to forget that moment wherein he  waited behind the door, and through the crack between the half-open  door and the door-frame saw Guenevere approach irresolutely, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8789"],[0,"The vision of hell.

One from the wound, the other from the mouth  Breath'd a thick smoke, whose vap'ry columns join'd.    Lucan in mute attention now may hear,  Nor thy disastrous fate, Sabellus! tell,  Nor shine, Nasidius!  Ovid now be mute.  What if in warbling fiction he record  Cadmus and Arethusa, to a snake  Him chang'd, and her into a fountain clear,  I envy not; for never face to face  Two natures thus transmuted did he sing,  Wherein both shapes were ready to assume  The other's substance.  They in mutual guise  So answer'd, that the serpent split his train  Divided to a fork, and the pierc'd spirit  Drew close his steps together, legs and thighs  Compacted, that no sign of juncture soon  Was visible: the tail disparted took  The figure which the spirit lost, its skin  Soft'ning, his indurated to a rind.  The shoulders next I mark'd, that ent'ring join'd  The monster's arm-pits, whose two shorter feet  So lengthen'd, as the other's dwindling shrunk.  The feet behind then twisting up became  That part that man conceals, which in the wretch  Was cleft in twain.  While both the shadowy smoke  With a new colour veils, and generates  Th' excrescent pile on one, peeling it off  From th' other body, lo! upon his feet  One upright rose, and prone the other fell.  Not yet their glaring and malignant lamps  Were shifted, though each feature chang'd beneath.  Of him who stood erect, the mounting face  Retreated towards the temples, and what there  Superfluous matter came, shot out in ears  From the smooth cheeks, the rest, not backward dragg'd,  Of its excess did shape the nose; and swell'd  Into due size protuberant the lips.  He, on the earth who lay, meanwhile extends  His sharpen'd visage, and draws down the ears  Into the head, as doth the slug his horns.  His tongue continuous before and apt  For utt'rance, severs; and the other's fork  Closing unites.  That done the smoke was laid.  The soul, transform'd into the brute, glides off,  Hissing along the vale, and after him  The other talking sputters; but soon turn'd  His new-grown shoulders on him, and in few  Thus to another spake: \"Along this path  Crawling, as I have done, speed Buoso now!\"    So saw I fluctuate in successive change  Th' unsteady ballast of the seventh hold:  And here if aught my tongue have swerv'd, events  So strange may be its warrant.  O'er mine eyes  Confusion hung, and on my thoughts amaze.    Yet 'scap'd they not so covertly, but well  I mark'd Sciancato: he alone it was  Of the three first that came, who chang'd not: thou,  The other's fate, Gaville, still dost rue.          CANTO XXVI    FLORENCE exult! for thou so mightily  Hast thriven, that o'er land and sea thy wings  Thou beatest, and thy name spreads over hell!  Among the plund'rers such the three I found  Thy citizens, whence shame to me thy son,  And no proud honour to thyself redounds.    But if our minds, when dreaming near the dawn,  Are of the truth presageful, thou ere long  Shalt feel what Prato, (not to say the rest)  Would fain might come upon thee; and that chance  Were in good time, if it befell thee now.  Would so it were, since it must needs befall!  For as time wears me, I shall grieve the more.    We from the depth departed; and my guide  Remounting scal'd the flinty steps, which late  We downward trac'd, and drew me up the steep.  Pursuing thus our solitary way  Among the crags and splinters of the rock,  Sped not our feet without the help of hands.    Then sorrow seiz'd me, which e'en now revives,  As my thought turns again to what I saw,  And, more than I am wont, I rein and curb  The powers of nature in me, lest they run  Where Virtue guides not; that if aught of good  My gentle star, or something better gave me,  I envy not myself the precious boon.    As in that season, when the sun least veils  His face that lightens all, what time the fly  Gives way to the shrill gnat, the peasant then  Upon some cliff reclin'd, beneath him sees  Fire-flies innumerous spangling o'er the vale,  Vineyard or tilth, where his day-labour lies:  With flames so numberless throughout its space  Shone the eighth chasm, apparent, when the depth  Was to my view expos'd. As he, whose wrongs  The bears aveng'd, at its departure saw  Elijah's chariot, when the steeds erect  Rais'd their steep flight for heav'n; his eyes meanwhile,  Straining pursu'd them, till the flame alone  Upsoaring like a misty speck he kenn'd;  E'en thus along the gulf moves every flame,  A sinner so enfolded close in each,  That none exhibits token of the theft.    Upon the bridge I forward bent to look,  And grasp'd a flinty mass, or else had fall'n,  Though push'd not from the height.  The guide, who mark'd  How I did gaze attentive, thus began:    \"Within these ardours are the spirits, each  Swath'd in confining fire.\"--\"Master, thy word,\"  I answer'd, \"hath assur'd me; yet I deem'd  Already of the truth, already wish'd  To ask thee, who is in yon fire, that comes  So parted at the summit, as it seem'd  Ascending from that funeral pile, where lay  The Theban brothers?\"  He replied: \"Within  Ulysses there and Diomede endure  Their penal tortures, thus to vengeance now  Together hasting, as erewhile to wrath.  These in the flame with ceaseless groans deplore  The ambush of the horse, that open'd wide  A portal for that goodly seed to pass,  Which sow'd imperial Rome; nor less the guile  Lament they, whence of her Achilles 'reft  Deidamia yet in death complains.  And there is rued the stratagem, that Troy  Of her Palladium spoil'd.\"--\"If they have power  Of utt'rance from within these sparks,\" said I,  \"O master! think my prayer a thousand fold  In repetition urg'd, that thou vouchsafe  To pause, till here the horned flame arrive.  See, how toward it with desire I bend.\"    He thus: \"Thy prayer is worthy of much praise,  And I accept it therefore: but do thou  Thy tongue refrain: to question them be mine,  For I divine thy wish: and they perchance,  For they were Greeks, might shun discourse with thee.\"    When there the flame had come, where time and place  Seem'd fitting to my guide, he thus began:  \"O ye, who dwell two spirits in one fire!  If living I of you did merit aught,  Whate'er the measure were of that desert,  When in the world my lofty strain I pour'd,  Move ye not on, till one of you unfold  In what clime death o'ertook him self-destroy'd.\"    Of the old flame forthwith the greater horn  Began to roll, murmuring, as a fire  That labours with the wind, then to and fro  Wagging the top, as a tongue uttering sounds,  Threw out its voice, and spake: \"When I escap'd  From Circe, who beyond a circling year  Had held me near Caieta, by her charms,  Ere thus Aeneas yet had nam'd the shore,  Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence  Of my old father, nor return of love,  That should have crown'd Penelope with joy,  Could overcome in me the zeal I had  T' explore the world, and search the ways of life,  Man's evil and his virtue.  Forth I sail'd  Into the deep illimitable main,  With but one bark, and the small faithful band  That yet cleav'd to me.  As Iberia far,  Far as Morocco either shore I saw,  And the Sardinian and each isle beside  Which round that ocean bathes.  Tardy with age  Were I and my companions, when we came  To the strait pass, where Hercules ordain'd  The bound'ries not to be o'erstepp'd by man.  The walls of Seville to my right I left,  On the other hand already Ceuta past.    \"O brothers!\"  I began, \"who to the west  Through perils without number now have reach'd,  To this the short remaining watch, that yet  Our senses have to wake, refuse not proof  Of the unpeopled world, following the track  Of Phoebus. Call to mind from whence we sprang:  Ye were not form'd to live the life of brutes  But virtue to pursue and knowledge high.  With these few words I sharpen'd for the voyage  The mind of my associates, that I then  Could scarcely have withheld them.  To the dawn  Our poop we turn'd, and for the witless flight  Made our oars wings, still gaining on the left.  Each star of the other pole night now beheld,  And ours so low, that from the ocean-floor  It rose not.  Five times re-illum'd, as oft  Vanish'd the light from underneath the moon  Since the deep way we enter'd, when from far  Appear'd a mountain dim, loftiest methought  Of all I e'er beheld.  Joy seiz'd us straight,  But soon to mourning changed.  From the new land  A whirlwind sprung, and at her foremost side  Did strike the vessel.  Thrice it whirl'd her round  With all the waves, the fourth time lifted up  The poop, and sank the prow: so fate decreed:  And over us the booming billow clos'd.\"          CANTO XVII    NOW upward rose the flame, and still'd its light  To speak no more, and now pass'd on with leave  From the mild poet gain'd, when following came  Another, from whose top a sound confus'd,  Forth issuing, drew our eyes that way to look.    As the Sicilian bull, that rightfully  His cries first echoed, who had shap'd its mould,  Did so rebellow, with the voice of him  Tormented, that the brazen monster seem'd  Pierc'd through with pain; thus while no way they found  Nor avenue immediate through the flame,  Into its language turn'd the dismal words:  But soon as they had won their passage forth,  Up from the point, which vibrating obey'd  Their motion at the tongue, these sounds we heard:  \"O thou! to whom I now direct my voice!  That lately didst exclaim in Lombard phrase,    \"Depart thou, I solicit thee no more,  Though somewhat tardy I perchance arrive  Let it not irk thee here to pause awhile,  And with me parley: lo! it irks not me  And yet I burn.  If but e'en now thou fall  into this blind world, from that pleasant land  Of Latium, whence I draw my sum of guilt,  Tell me if those, who in Romagna dwell,  Have peace or war.
