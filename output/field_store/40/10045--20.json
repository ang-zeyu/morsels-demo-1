Now that the ghastly moment had come, he  felt too petrified with fear even to act the little part in which he had  been diligently rehearsed by the obliging Mr. Teal. He simply sat and  did nothing.    It was speedily made clear to him that Miss Chilvers would do all the  actual doing that was necessary. The butler had drawn no false picture  of her personal appearance. Dyed yellow hair done all frizzy was but one  fact of her many-sided impossibilities. In the serene surroundings of  the long drawing-room, she looked more unspeakably \"not much good\" than  Roland had ever imagined her. With such a leading lady, his drama  could not fail of success. He should have been pleased; he was merely  appalled. The thing might have a happy ending, but while it lasted it  was going to be terrible.    She had a flatteringly attentive reception. Nobody failed to notice her.  Lord Evenwood woke with a start, and stared at her as if she had been  some ghost from his trouble of '85. Lady Eva's face expressed sheer  amazement. Lady Kimbuck, laying down her crochet-work, took one look at  the apparition, and instantly decided that one of her numerous erring  relatives had been at it again. Of all the persons in the room, she  was possibly the only one completely cheerful. She was used to these  situations and enjoyed them. Her mind, roaming into the past, recalled  the night when her cousin Warminster had been pinked by a stiletto in  his own drawing-room by a lady from South America. Happy days, happy  days.    Lord Evenwood had, by this time, come to the conclusion that the festive  Blowick must be responsible for this visitation. He rose with dignity.    \"To what are we----?\" he began.    Miss Chilvers, resolute young woman, had no intention of standing there  while other people talked. She shook her gleaming head and burst into  speech.    \"Oh, yes, I know I've no right to be coming walking in here among a lot  of perfect strangers at their teas, but what I say is, 'Right's right  and wrong's wrong all the world over,' and I may be poor, but I have  my feelings. No, thank you, I won't sit down. I've not come for the  weekend. I've come to say a few words, and when I've said them I'll go,  and not before. A lady friend of mine happened to be reading her Daily  Sketch the other day, and she said 'Hullo! hullo!' and passed it on to  me with her thumb on a picture which had under it that it was Lady Eva  Blyton who was engaged to be married to Mr. Roland Bleke. And when I  read that, I said 'Hullo! hullo!' too, I give you my word. And not being  able to travel at once, owing to being prostrated with the shock, I came  along to-day, just to have a look at Mr. Roland Blooming Bleke, and ask  him if he's forgotten that he happens to be engaged to me. That's all. I  know it's the sort of thing that might slip any gentleman's mind, but I  thought it might be worth mentioning. So now!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Roland, perspiring in the shadows at the far end of the room, felt that  Miss Chilvers was overdoing it. There was no earthly need for all this  sort of thing. Just a simple announcement of the engagement would have  been quite sufficient. It was too obvious to him that his ally was  thoroughly enjoying herself. She had the center of the stage, and did  not intend lightly to relinquish it.    \"My good girl,\" said Lady Kimbuck, \"talk less and prove more. When did  Mr. Bleke promise to marry you?\"    \"Oh, it's all right. I'm not expecting you to believe my word. I've got  all the proofs you'll want. Here's his letters.\"    Lady Kimbuck's eyes gleamed. She took the package eagerly. She never  lost an opportunity of reading compromising letters. She enjoyed them  as literature, and there was never any knowing when they might come in  useful.    \"Roland,\" said Lady Eva, quietly, \"haven't you anything to contribute to  this conversation?\"    Miss Chilvers clutched at her bodice. Cinema palaces were a passion with  her, and she was up in the correct business.    \"Is he here? In this room?\"    Roland slunk from the shadows.    \"Mr. Bleke,\" said Lord Evenwood, sternly, \"who is this woman?\"    Roland uttered a kind of strangled cough.    \"Are these letters in your handwriting?\" asked Lady Kimbuck, almost  cordially. She had seldom read better compromising letters in her life,  and she was agreeably surprized that one whom she had always imagined a  colorless stick should have been capable of them.    Roland nodded.    \"Well, it's lucky you're rich,\" said Lady Kimbuck philosophically. \"What  are you asking for these?\" she enquired of Miss Chilvers.    \"Exactly,\" said Lord Evenwood, relieved. \"Precisely. Your sterling  common sense is admirable, Sophia. You place the whole matter at once on  a businesslike footing.\"    \"Do you imagine for a moment----?\" began Miss Chilvers slowly.    \"Yes,\" said Lady Kimbuck. \"How much?\"    Miss Chilvers sobbed.    \"If I have lost him for ever----\"    Lady Eva rose.    \"But you haven't,\" she said pleasantly. \"I wouldn't dream of standing in  your way.\" She drew a ring from her finger, placed it on the table, and  walked to the door. \"I am not engaged to Mr. Bleke,\" she said, as she  reached it.    Roland never knew quite how he had got away from The Towers. He had  confused memories in which the principals of the drawing-room scene  figured in various ways, all unpleasant. It was a portion of his life  on which he did not care to dwell. Safely back in his flat, however, he  gradually recovered his normal spirits. Indeed, now that the tumult and  the shouting had, so to speak, died, and he was free to take a broad  view of his position, he felt distinctly happier than usual. That Lady  Kimbuck had passed for ever from his life was enough in itself to make  for gaiety.           *       *       *       *       *    He was humming blithely one morning as he opened his letters; outside  the sky was blue and the sun shining. It was good to be alive. He opened  the first letter. The sky was still blue, the sun still shining.        \"Dear Sir,\" (it ran).        \"We have been instructed by our client, Miss Maud Chilvers, of the      Goat and Compasses, Aldershot, to institute proceedings against      you for Breach of Promise of Marriage. In the event of your being      desirous to avoid the expense and publicity of litigation, we are      instructed to say that Miss Chilvers would be prepared to accept      the sum of ten thousand pounds in settlement of her claim against      you. We would further add that in support of her case our client      has in her possession a number of letters written by yourself to      her, all of which bear strong prima facie evidence of the alleged      promise to marry: and she will be able in addition to call as      witnesses in support of her case the Earl of Evenwood, Lady      Kimbuck, and Lady Eva Blyton, in whose presence, at a recent      date, you acknowledged that you had promised to marry our client.        \"Trusting that we hear from you in the course of post.             We are, dear Sir,                     Yours faithfully,                              Harrison, Harrison, Harrison, & Harrison.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8743"],[0,"Mary Schweidler, the amber witch (#16)"],[1,"the end, which was as follows:--      Tempus erit, quo tu reversus ab hostibus ultor      Intrabis patriae libera regna meae;    Tunc meliora student nostrae tibi carmina musae,      Tunc tua, maxime rex, Martia facta canam.    Tu modo versiculis ne spernas vilibus ausum      Auguror et res est ista futura brevi!    Sis foelix, fortisque diu, vive optime princeps,      Omnia, et ut possis vincere, dura. Vale!    As soon as she held her peace, his Majesty said, \"_Propius accedas, patria  virgo, ut te osculer_\"; whereupon she drew near to his horse, blushing  deeply. I thought he would only have kissed her forehead, as potentates  commonly use to do, but not at all! he kissed her lips with a loud smack,  and the long feathers on his hat drooped over her neck, so that I was  quite afraid for her again. But he soon raised up his head, and taking off  his gold chain, whereon dangled his own effigy, he hung it round my  child's neck with these words: \"_Hocce tuce pulchritudim! et si favente  Deo redux fuero victor, promissum carmen et praeterea duo oscula  exspecto_.\"    Hereupon the Sheriff with his three men again came forward and bowed down  to the ground before his Majesty. But as he knew no Latin, _item_ no  Italian nor French, I had to act as interpreter. For his Majesty inquired  how far it was to Swine, and whether there was still much foreign soldiery  there: And the Sheriff thought there were still about 200 Croats in the  camp; whereupon his Majesty spurred on his horse, and nodding graciously,  cried \"_Valete_!\" And now came the rest of the troops, about 3000 strong,  out of the coppice, which likewise had a valiant bearing, and attempted no  fooleries, as troops are wont to do, when they passed by us and the women,  but marched on in honest quietness, and we followed the train until the  forest beyond Coserow, where we commended it to the care of the Almighty,  and every one went on his way home.          _The Sixteenth Chapter_      HOW LITTLE MARY PAASCH WAS SORELY PLAGUED OF THE DEVIL, AND THE WHOLE  PARISH FELL OFF FROM ME    Before I proceed any further I will first mark that the illustrious King  Gustavus Adolphus, as we presently heard, had cut down the 300 Croats at  Swine, and was thence gone by sea to Stettin. May God be for ever gracious  to him! Amen.    But my sorrows increased from day to day, seeing that the devil now played  pranks such as he never had played before. I had begun to think that the  ears of God had hearkened to our ardent prayers, but it pleased him to try  us yet more hardly than ever. For, a few days after the arrival of the  most illustrious King Gustavus Adolphus, it was bruited about that my  child her little god-daughter was possessed of the Evil One, and tumbled  about most piteously on her bed, insomuch that no one was able to hold  her. My child straightway went to see her little god-daughter, but  presently came weeping home. Old Paasch would not suffer her even to come  near her, but railed at her very angrily, and said that she should never  come within his doors again, as his child had got the mischief from the  white roll which she had given her that morning. It was true that my child  had given her a roll, seeing that the maid had been the day before to  Wolgast and had brought back a napkin full of them.    Such news vexed me sore, and after putting on my cassock I went to old  Paasch his house to exorcise the foul fiend and to remove such disgrace  from my child. I found the old man standing on the floor by the cockloft  steps weeping; and after I had spoken \"The peace of God,\" I asked him  first of all whether he really believed that his little Mary had been  bewitched by means of the roll which my child had given her? He said,  \"Yes!\" And when I answered that in that case I also must have been  bewitched, _item_ Pagel his little girl, seeing that we both had eaten of  the rolls, he was silent, and asked me with a sigh, whether I would not go  into the room and see for myself how matters stood. I then entered with  \"The peace of God,\" and found six people standing round little Mary her  bed; her eyes were shut, and she was as stiff as a board; wherefore Kit  Wells (who was a young and sturdy fellow) seized the little child by one  leg and held her out like a hedgestake, so that I might see how the devil  plagued her. I now said a prayer, and Satan, perceiving that a servant of  Christ was come, began to tear the child so fearfully that it was pitiful  to behold; for she flung about her hands and feet so that four strong men  were scarce able to hold her: _item_ she was afflicted with extraordinary  risings and fallings of her belly, as if a living creature were therein,  so that at last the old witch Lizzie Kolken sat herself upon her belly,  whereupon the child seemed to be somewhat better, and I told her to repeat  the Apostles' Creed, so as to see whether it really were the devil who  possessed her. She straightway grew worse than before, and began to gnash  her teeth, to roll her eyes, and to strike so hard with her hands and feet  that she flung her father, who held one of her legs, right into the middle  of the room, and then struck her foot so hard against the bedstead that  the blood flowed, and Lizzie Kolken was thrown about on her belly as  though she had been in a swing. And as I ceased not, but exorcised Satan  that he should leave her, she began to howl and to bark like a dog, _item_  to laugh, and spoke at last, with a gruff bass voice, like an old man's,  \"I will not depart.\" But he should soon have been forced to depart out of  her, had not both father and mother besought me by God's holy Sacrament to  leave their poor child in peace, seeing that nothing did her any good, but  rather made her worse. I was therefore forced to desist, and only  admonished the parents to seek for help, like the Canaanitish woman, in  true repentance and incessant prayer, and with her to sigh in constant  faith, \"Have mercy upon me, O Lord, Thou Son of David, my daughter is  grievously vexed of a devil,\" Matthew xv.; that the heart of our Lord  would then melt, so that he would have mercy on their child, and command  Satan to depart from her. _Item_, I promised to pray for the little child  on the following Sunday with the whole congregation, and told them to  bring her, if it were any ways possible, to the church, seeing that the  ardent prayer of the whole congregation has power to rise beyond the  clouds. This they promised to do, and I then went home sorely troubled,  where I soon learned that she was somewhat better; thus it still is sure  that Satan hates nothing so much, after the Lord Jesus, as the servants of  the Gospel. But wait, and I shall even yet \"bruise thy head with my heel\"  (Genesis, chap, iii.); nought shall avail thee.    Howbeit before the blessed Sunday came, I perceived that many of my people  went out of my way, both in the village and elsewhere in the parish, where  I went to visit sundry sick folks. When I went to Uekeritze to see young  Tittlewitz, there even befell me as follows:--Claus Pieper the peasant  stood in his yard chopping wood, and on seeing me he flung the axe out of  his hand so hastily that it stuck in the ground, and he ran towards the  pigsty, making the sign of the cross. I motioned him to stop, and asked  why he thus ran from me, his confessor? Whether, peradventure, he also  believed that my daughter had bewitched her little god-child? \"_Ille_.  Yes, he believed it, because the whole parish did. _Ego_. Why, then, had  she been so kind to her formerly, and kept her like a sister through the  worst of the famine? _Ille_. This was not the only mischief she had done.  _Ego_. What, then, had she done besides? _Ille_. That was all one to me.  _Ego_. He should tell me, or I would complain to the magistrate. _Ille_.  That I might do, if I pleased.\" Whereupon he went his way insolently. Any  one may guess that I was not slow to inquire everywhere what people  thought my daughter had done; but no one would tell me anything, and I  might have grieved to death at such evil reports. Moreover not one child  came during this whole week to school to my daughter; and when I sent out  the maid to ask the reason she brought back word that the children were  ill, or that the parents wanted them for their work. I thought and  thought, but all to no purpose, until the blessed Sunday came round when I  meant to have held a great Sacrament, seeing that many people had made  known their intention to come to the Lord's table. It seemed strange to me  that I saw no one standing (as was their wont) about the church door; I  thought, however, that they might have gone into the houses. But when I  went into the church with my daughter, there were not more than six people  assembled, among whom was old Lizzie Kolken; and the accursed witch no  sooner saw my daughter follow me than she made the sign of the cross and  ran out of the door under the steeple; whereupon the five others, among  them mine own church-warden Claus Bulken (I had not appointed any one in  the room of old Seden), followed her. I was so horror-struck that my blood  curdled, and I began to tremble, so that I fell with my shoulder against  the confessional. My child, to whom I had as yet told nothing, in order to  spare her, then asked me, \"Father, what is the matter with all the people;  are they, too, bewitched?\" Whereupon I came to myself again and went into  the churchyard to look after them. But all were gone save my churchwarden,  Claus Bulken, who stood under the lime-tree, whistling to himself. I  stepped up to him and asked what had come to the people? Whereupon he  answered he could not tell; and when I asked him again why, then, he  himself had left the church, he said, What was he to do there alone,  seeing that no collection could be made? I then implored him to tell me  the truth, and what horrid suspicion had arisen against me in the parish?  But he"]]]
