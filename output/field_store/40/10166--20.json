He was glad to be freed from a tie which had interfered with  his duties at Frankfort; to these he devoted himself with an  extraordinary energy; all his old repugnance to official life had  disappeared; he did not confine himself to the mere routine of his  duties, or to carrying out the instructions sent to him from Berlin.    His power of work was marvellous: there passed through his hands a  constant series of most important and complicated negotiations; up to  this time he had no experience or practice in sedentary literary work,  now he seems to go out of the way to make fresh labours for himself. He  writes long and careful despatches to his Minister on matters of general  policy; some of them so carefully thought out and so clearly expressed  that they may still be looked on as models. He is entirely free from  that circumlocution and involved style which makes so much diplomatic  correspondence almost worthless. His arguments are always clear,  complete, concise. He used to work long into the night, and then, when  in the early morning the post to Berlin had gone, he would mount his  horse and ride out into the country. It was in these years that he  formed those habits to which the breakdown of his health in later years  was due; but now his physical and intellectual vigour seemed  inexhaustible.    He never feared to press his own views as to the policy which should be  pursued. He also kept up a constant correspondence with Gerlach, and  many of these letters were laid before the King, so that even when  absent he continued as before to influence both the official and  unofficial advisers. He soon became the chief adviser on German affairs  and was often summoned to Berlin that his advice might be taken; within  two years after his appointment he was sent on a special mission to  Vienna to try and bring about an agreement as to the rivalry concerning  the Customs' Union. He failed, but he had gained a knowledge of persons  and opinions at the Austrian Court which was to be of much use to him.    During these years, indeed, he acquired a most remarkable knowledge of  Germany; before, he had lived entirely in Prussia, now he was at the  centre of the German political system, continually engaged in important  negotiations with the other Courts; after a few years there was not a  man of importance in German public life whose character and opinions he  had not gauged.    Further experience only confirmed in him the observations he had made at  the beginning, that it was impossible to maintain a good understanding  with Austria. The tone of his letters soon changes from doubt and  disappointment to settled and determined hostility. In other matters  also he found that the world was not the same place it had seemed to  him; he had been accustomed to regard the Revolution as the chief danger  to be met; at Frankfort he was in the home of it; here for nearly a year  the German Assembly had held its meetings; in the neighbouring States of  Baden, Hesse, and in the Palatinate, the Republican element was strong;  he found them as revolutionary as ever, but he soon learnt to despise  rather than fear them:      \"The population here would be a political volcano if revolutions    were made with the mouth; so long as it requires blood and    strength they will obey anyone who has courage to command and, if    necessary, to draw the sword; they would be dangerous only under    cowardly governments.      \"I have never seen two men fighting in all the two years I have    been here. This cowardice does not prevent the people, who are    completely devoid of all inner Christianity and all respect for    authority, from sympathising with    the Revolution.\"    His observations on the character of the South Germans only increased  his admiration for the Prussian people and his confidence in the  Prussian State.    He had not been at Frankfort a year before he had learnt to look on this  hostility of Austria as unsurmountable. As soon as he had convinced  himself of this, he did not bewail and bemoan the desertion of their  ally; he at once accustomed himself to the new position and considered  in what way the Government ought to act. His argument was simple.  Austria is now our enemy; we must be prepared to meet this enmity either  by diplomacy or war; we are not strong enough to do so alone; therefore  we must have allies. There was no sure alliance to be had in Germany; he  despised the other German States. If there were to be a war he would  rather have them against him than on his side. He must find help abroad;  Austria had overcome Prussia by the alliance with Russia. Surely the  only thing to be done was to seek support where it could be got, either  with Russia or with France, if possible with both. In this he was only  reverting to the old policy of Prussia; the alliance with Austria had  only begun in 1813. From now until 1866 his whole policy was ceaselessly  devoted to bringing about such a disposition of the forces of Europe  that Austria might be left without allies and Prussia be able to regain  the upper hand in German affairs.    The change was in his circumstances, not in his character; as before he  was moved by a consuming passion of patriotism; something there was too  of personal feeling,--his own pride, his own ambitions were engaged,  though this was as nothing compared to love of his country and loyalty  to the King. He was a soldier of the Prussian Crown: at Berlin he had to  defend it against internal enemies; now the danger had shifted, the  power of the Government was established, why waste time in fighting  with Liberalism? Other enemies were pressing on. When Jellachich and  Windischgaetz had stood victorious by the blood-stained altar of St.  Stephen's, the Austrian army had destroyed the common foe; now it was  the same Austrian army and Austrian statesmen who desired to put a limit  to Prussian ambition. Bismarck threw himself into the conflict of  diplomacy with the same courage and relentless persistence that he had  shewn in Parliamentary debates. He had already begun to divine that the  time might come when the Prussian Crown would find an ally in Italian  patriots and Hungarian rebels.    It was the Eastern complications which first enabled him to shew his  diplomatic abilities in the larger field of European politics. The plans  for the dismemberment of the Turkish Empire which were entertained by  the Czar were opposed by England, France, and Austria; Prussia, though  not immediately concerned, also at first gave her assent to the various  notes and protests of the Powers; so that the ambition of the Czar was  confronted by the unanimous voice of Europe.    Bismarck from the beginning regarded the situation with apprehension; he  saw that Prussia was being entangled in a struggle in which she had much  to lose and nothing to gain. If she continued to support the Western  Powers she would incur the hatred of Russia; then, perhaps, by a sudden  change of policy on the part of Napoleon, she would be left helpless and  exposed to Russian vengeance. If war were to break out, and Prussia took  part in the war, then the struggle between France and Russia would be  fought out on German soil, and, whoever was victorious, Germany would be  the loser. What interests of theirs were at stake that they should incur  this danger? why should Prussia sacrifice herself to preserve English  influence in the Mediterranean, or the interests of Austria on the  Danube? He wished for exactly the opposite policy; the embarrassment of  Austria must be the opportunity of Prussia; now was the time to recover  the lost position in Germany. The dangerous friendship of Austria and  Russia was dissolved; if Prussia came to an understanding with the Czar,  it was now Austria that would be isolated. The other German States would  not desire to be dragged into a war to support Austrian dominion in the  East. Let Prussia be firm and they would turn to her for support, and  she would once more be able to command a majority of the Diet.    For these reasons he recommended his Government to preserve an armed  neutrality, in union, if possible, with the other German States. If they  were to take sides, he preferred it should not be with the Western  Powers, for, as he said,--      \"We must look abroad for allies, and among the European Powers    Russia is to be had on the cheapest terms; it wishes only to grow    in the East, the two others at our expense.\"    It shews the advance he had made in diplomacy that throughout his  correspondence he never refers to the actual cause of dispute; others  might discuss the condition of the Christians in Turkey or the Holy  Places of Jerusalem; he thinks only of the strength and weakness of his  own State. The opening of the Black Sea, the dismemberment of Turkey,  the control of the Mediterranean, the fate of the Danubian  Principalities--for all this he cared nothing, for in them Prussia had  no interests; they only existed for him so far as the new combinations  among the Powers might for good or evil affect Prussia.    The crisis came in 1854: a Russian army occupied Moldavia and Wallachia;  England and France sent their fleets to the Black Sea; they determined  on war and they wished for the alliance of Austria. Austria was inclined  to join, for the presence of Russian troops on the Danube was a menace  to her; she did not dare to move unless supported by Prussia and  Germany; she appealed to the Confederacy and urged that her demands  might be supported by the armies of her allies; but the German States  were little inclined to send the levies of their men for the Eastern  interests of the Emperor. If they were encouraged by Prussia, they would  refuse; the result in Germany, as in Europe, depended on the action of  Prussia, and the decision lay with the King.    Was Prussia to take part with Russia or the Western Powers? That was the  question which for many"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12422"],[0,"Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation: 1838-1839 (#17)"],[1,"hich, together with the rind itself, is extremely sweet. The principal  peculiarity of this growth, as perhaps you know, is that they are laid  horizontally in the earth when they are planted for propagation, and from  each of the notches or joints of the recumbent cane a young shoot is  produced at the germinating season.    A very curious and interesting circumstance to me just now in the  neighbourhood is the projection of a canal, to be called the Brunswick  Canal, which, by cutting through the lower part of the mainland, towards  the southern extremity of Great St. Simon's Island, is contemplated as a  probable and powerful means of improving the prosperity of the town of  Brunswick, by bringing it into immediate communication with the Atlantic.  The scheme, which I think I have mentioned to you before, is, I believe,  chiefly patronised by your States' folk--Yankee enterprise and funds being  very essential elements, it appears to me, in all southern projects and  achievements. This speculation, however, from all I hear of the  difficulties of the undertaking, from the nature of the soil, and the  impossibility almost of obtaining efficient labour, is not very likely to  arrive at any very satisfactory result; and, indeed, I find it hard to  conceive how this part of Georgia can possibly produce a town which can be  worth the digging of a canal, even to Yankee speculators. There is one  feature of the undertaking, however, which more than all the others  excites my admiration, namely, that Irish labourers have been advertised  for to work upon the canal, and the terms offered them are twenty dollars  a month per man and their board. Now these men will have for fellow  labourers negroes who not only will receive nothing at all for their work,  but who will be hired by the contractors and directors of the works from  their masters, to whom they will hand over the price of their slaves'  labour; while it will be the interest of the person hiring them not only  to get as much work as possible out of them, but also to provide them as  economically with food, combining the two praiseworthy endeavours exactly  in such judicious proportions as not to let them neutralize each other.  You will observe that this case of a master hiring out his slaves to  another employer, from whom he receives their rightful wages, is a form of  slavery which, though extremely common, is very seldom adverted to in  those arguments for the system which are chiefly founded upon the master's  presumed regard for his human property. People who have ever let a  favourite house to the temporary occupation of strangers, can form a  tolerable idea of the difference between one's own regard and care of  one's goods and chattels and that of the most conscientious tenant; and  whereas I have not yet observed that ownership is a very effectual  protection to the slaves against ill usage and neglect, I am quite  prepared to admit that it is a vastly better one than the temporary  interest which a lessee can feel in the live stock he hires, out of whom  it is his manifest interest to get as much, and into whom to put as  little, as possible. Yet thousands of slaves throughout the southern  states are thus handed over by the masters who own them to masters who do  not; and it does not require much demonstration to prove that their estate  is not always the more gracious. Now you must not suppose that these same  Irish free labourers and negro slaves will be permitted to work together  at this Brunswick Canal. They say that this would be utterly impossible;  for why?--there would be tumults, and risings, and broken heads, and  bloody bones, and all the natural results of Irish intercommunion with  their fellow creatures, no doubt--perhaps even a little more riot and  violence than merely comports with their usual habits of Milesian good  fellowship; for, say the masters, the Irish hate the negroes more even  than the Americans do, and there would be no bound to their murderous  animosity if they were brought in contact with them on the same portion of  the works of the Brunswick Canal. Doubtless there is some truth in  this--the Irish labourers who might come hither, would be apt enough,  according to a universal moral law, to visit upon others the injuries they  had received from others. They have been oppressed enough themselves, to  be oppressive whenever they have a chance; and the despised and degraded  condition of the blacks, presenting to them a very ugly resemblance of  their own home, circumstances naturally excite in them the exercise of the  disgust and contempt of which they themselves are very habitually the  objects; and that such circular distribution of wrongs may not only be  pleasant, but have something like the air of retributive right to very  ignorant folks, is not much to be wondered at. Certain is the fact,  however, that the worst of all tyrants is the one who has been a slave;  and for that matter (and I wonder if the southern slaveholders hear it  with the same ear that I do, and ponder it with the same mind?) the  command of one slave to another is altogether the most uncompromising  utterance of insolent truculent despotism that it ever fell to my lot to  witness or listen to. 'You nigger--I say, you black nigger,--you no hear  me call you--what for you no run quick?' All this, dear E----, is  certainly reasonably in favour of division of labour on the Brunswick  Canal; but the Irish are not only quarrelers, and rioters, and fighters,  and drinkers, and despisers of niggers--they are a passionate, impulsive,  warm-hearted, generous people, much given to powerful indignations, which  break out suddenly when they are not compelled to smoulder  sullenly--pestilent sympathisers too, and with a sufficient dose of  American atmospheric air in their lungs, properly mixed with a right  proportion of ardent spirits, there is no saying but what they might  actually take to sympathy with the slaves, and I leave you to judge of  the possible consequences. You perceive, I am sure, that they can by no  means be allowed to work together on the Brunswick Canal.    I have been taking my daily walk round the island, and visited the sugar  mill and the threshing mill again.    Mr. ---- has received another letter from Parson S---- upon the subject of  more church building in Darien. It seems that there has been a very  general panic in this part of the slave states lately, occasioned by some  injudicious missionary preaching, which was pronounced to be of a  decidedly abolitionist tendency. The offensive preachers, after sowing,  God only knows what seed in this tremendous soil, where one grain of  knowledge may spring up a gigantic upas tree to the prosperity of its most  unfortunate possessors, were summarily and ignominiously expulsed; and now  some short sighted, uncomfortable Christians in these parts, among others  this said Parson S----, are possessed with the notion that something had  better be done to supply the want created by the cessation of these  dangerous exhortations, to which the negroes have listened, it seems, with  complacency. Parson S---- seems to think that, having driven out two  preachers, it might be well to build one church where, at any rate, the  negroes might be exhorted in a safe and salutary manner, 'qui ne leur  donnerait point d'idees,' as the French would say. Upon my word, E----, I  used to pity the slaves, and I do pity them with all my soul; but oh  dear! oh dear! their case is a bed of roses to that of their owners, and I  would go to the slave block in Charleston to-morrow cheerfully to be  purchased, if my only option was to go thither as a purchaser. I was  looking over this morning, with a most indescribable mixture of feelings,  a pamphlet published in the south upon the subject of the religious  instruction of the slaves; and the difficulty of the task undertaken by  these reconcilers of God and Mammon really seems to me nothing short of  piteous. 'We must give our involuntary servants,' (they seldom call them  slaves, for it is an ugly word in an American mouth, you know,) 'Christian  enlightenment,' say they; and where shall they begin? 'Whatsoever ye would  that men should do unto you, do ye also unto them?' No--but, 'Servants,  obey your masters;' and there, I think, they naturally come to a full  stop. This pamphlet forcibly suggested to me the necessity for a slave  church catechism, and also, indeed, if it were possible, a slave Bible. If  these heaven-blinded negro enlighteners persist in their pernicious plan  of making Christians of their cattle, something of the sort must be done,  or they will infallibly cut their own throats with this two-edged sword of  truth, to which they should in no wise have laid their hand, and would  not, doubtless, but that it is now thrust at them so threateningly that  they have no choice. Again and again, how much I do pity them!    I have been walking to another cluster of negro huts, known as Number  Two, and here we took a boat and rowed across the broad brimming Altamaha  to a place called Woodville, on a part of the estate named Hammersmith,  though why that very thriving suburb of the great city of London should  have been selected as the name of the lonely plank house in the midst of  the pine woods which here enjoys that title I cannot conceive, unless it  was suggested by the contrast. This settlement is on the mainland, and  consists apparently merely of this house, (to which the overseer retires  when the poisonous malaria of the rice plantations compels him to withdraw  from it,) and a few deplorably miserable hovels, which appeared to me to  be chiefly occupied by the most decrepid and infirm samples of humanity it  was ever my melancholy lot to behold.    The air of this pine barren is salubrious compared with that of the rice  islands, and here some of the oldest slaves who will not die yet, and  cannot work any more, are sent, to go, "]]]
