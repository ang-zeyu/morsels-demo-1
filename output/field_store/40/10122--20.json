The cannon of the upper fore-limb is then fixed to the cannon  of the upper hind, as described under the section of this chapter devoted  to the methods of restraint, and the lower limb freed from the hobbles and  drawn forward by an assistant by means of a stout piece of cord round the  pastern.    An alternative method of holding the limb is to bind both fore-legs  together above the knee by means of the side-line run round a few times in  the form of the figure 8, and then fastened off. As in the former method,  the lower foot is then removed from the hobble, and again held forward by  an assistant. By either method the inside of the limb is operated on first.    [Illustration: FIG. 57.--THE ESMARCH RUBBER BANDAGE AND TOURNIQUET.]    Although it is not absolutely necessary, it is an advantage, especially to  the inexperienced operator, to apply before operating an Esmarch's bandage  and tourniquet (Fig. 57). This expels the greater part of the blood from  the limb, and renders the operation comparatively bloodless.    [Illustration: FIG. 58.--RUBBER TOURNIQUET WITH WOODEN BLOCK.]    The Esmarch bandage is composed of solid rubber, and with it the limb is  bandaged tightly from below upwards. On reaching the knee the tourniquet is  stretched round the limb, fastened by means of its buckle and strap, and  the bandage removed. Those who feel they can dispense with the bandage use  the tourniquet alone. For this purpose the form depicted in Fig. 58, and  the one in general use at the Royal Veterinary College, is more suitable,  on account of its wooden block, which may be placed so as to press on the  main artery of supply.    [Illustration: Fig. 59. NEURECTOMY BISTOURY.]    _Instruments Required_.--These should be at hand in an earthenware or  enamelled iron tray containing just sufficient of a 5 per cent. solution  of carbolic acid to keep them covered. Those that are necessary will be a  sharp scalpel, or, if preferred, one of the many forms of bistoury devised  for the purpose (see Fig. 59), a pair of artery forceps, a needle ready  threaded with silk or gut, one of the patterns of neurectomy needle (see  Fig. 60), and a pair of blunt-pointed scissors curved on the flat. It is  also an advantage, when once the incision through the skin is made, to  employ one of the forms of elastic, self-adjusting tenacula (see Fig. 61)  for keeping the edges of the wound apart while searching for the nerve.    [Illustration: FIG. 60. NEURECTOMY NEEDLE.]    _Incision through the Skin_.--We remember that the plantar nerve of the  inner side is in close relation with the internal metacarpal artery, and  that both, in company with the internal metacarpal vein, run down the limb  in close proximity with the inner border of the flexor tendons. Also, we  remember that the external plantar nerve has no attendant artery, although,  like its fellow, it is to be found in close touch with the edge of the  flexor tendons.    Bearing these landmarks in mind, we feel for the nerve in the hollow  just above the fetlock-joint by noting the pulsations of the artery, and  determining the edge of the flexor tendons. This done, a clean incision is  made with the bistoury or the scalpel in the direction of the vessels. The  incision should be made firmly and decisively, so that the skin may be  cleanly penetrated with one clear cut. If judiciously made, little else in  the shape of dissection will be needed.    [Illustration: FIG. 61.--DOUBLE TENACULUM.]    It is now that the double tenaculum (Fig. 61) is applied. One clip is fixed  to the anterior edge of the wound, and the other carried beneath the limb  and made to grasp the posterior edge. If found desirable to keep the  edges of the wound apart, and no tenaculum to hand, the same end may be  accomplished by means of a needle and silk. In like manner as is the  tenaculum, the silk is attached to one edge of the wound, carried under the  limb, and firmly secured to the other.    Having made the incision, the wound should be wiped free from blood by  means of a pledget of cotton-wool previously soaked in a carbolic acid  solution and squeezed dry. At the bottom of the wound will now be seen  the glistening white sheath, containing the vein, artery, and nerve. This  should be picked up with the forceps, and a further incision made with the  bistoury. Care should be exercised in making this second incision, or the  artery may accidentally be opened. If an ordinary scalpel is used, the  lower end of the sheath should be picked up and the point of the scalpel  inserted through it. With the cutting edge of the scalpel turned towards  the opening of the wound, the sheath is then slit from below upwards. The  second incision satisfactorily made, the wound is again wiped dry, and the  nerve seen as a piece of white, curled string in the posterior portion of  the wound.    At this stage it is advisable to accurately ascertain whether what we have  taken to be the nerve actually is it. This is done by taking it up with the  forceps and giving it a sharp tweeze. A sudden struggle on the part of the  patient will then leave no doubt in the operator's mind that it is the  nerve he has interfered with.    _Section of the Nerve_.--The neurectomy needle (Fig. 60) is now taken, and,  excluding the other structures, passed under the nerve. A piece of stout  silk or ordinary string is then threaded through the eye of the needle, the  needle withdrawn, and the silk left in position under the nerve. The silk  is now tied in a loop, and the nerve by this means gently lifted from its  bed. With the curved scissors or the scalpel it is severed as high up as is  possible. The lower end of the severed nerve is then grasped firmly with  the forceps, pulled downwards as far as possible, and then cut off. At  least an inch of the nerve should be excised.    The animal is then turned over, and the opposite side of the limb operated  on in the same manner.    The tourniquet is now removed, and the wound is examined for bleeding  vessels. If the haemorrhage is only slight, the wound should be merely  dabbed gently with the antiseptic wool until it has stayed. A larger vessel  may be taken up with the artery forceps and ligatured, or the haemorrhage  stopped by torsion. On no account, unless it it done to stay haemorrhage  that is otherwise uncontrollable, should the wound be sutured with blood in  it. With the wound once dry and clean, it is well to insert three or four  silk sutures, but care must be taken not to draw them too tightly. This  done, the patient may be allowed to get up. _After-treatment_.--This is  simple. Over each wound is placed a pledget of antiseptic cotton-wool or  tow, and the whole lightly covered with a bandage soaked in an antiseptic  solution. For the first night the animal should be tied up short to the  rack, and the following morning the bandages removed. A little boracic  acid or iodoform, or a mixture of the two combined with starch (starch and  boracic acid equal parts, iodoform 1 drachm to each ounce) should now be  dusted over the wounds, the antiseptic pledgets renewed, and the bandage  readjusted over all.    At the end of three or four days the bandages may be dispensed with. All  that is necessary now is an occasional dusting with an antiseptic powder,  and, as far as possible, the restriction of movement. At the end of a week  the sutures may be removed, and the animal turned into a loose box or out  to pasture.      E. MEDIAN NEURECTOMY.    As a palliative for lameness when confined to the foot, one would imagine  that the plantar operation would be all sufficient. There are operators,  however, who state that the results following section of the median nerve  have been such as to cause them to entirely abandon the lower operation in  its favour. If only for that reason a brief mention of the operation must  be made here.    The operation was first performed in this country in October, 1895, the  subject being one of the out-patients at the Royal Veterinary College Free  Clinique.    For five or six years following this date Professor Hobday performed the  operation some several hundred times, and was certainly instrumental in  bringing the operation into prominence. Though so recently introduced here,  it appears to have been practised for several years on the Continent,  originating in Germany as early as 1867. In that country a first public  account of it was published in 1885 by Professor Peters of Berlin, while in  France it was introduced by Pellerin in 1892. In this operation a portion  of the median nerve is excised on the inside of the elbow-joint just below  the internal condyle of the humerus. Here the nerve runs behind the artery,  then crosses it, and descends in a slightly forward direction behind the  ridge formed by the radius.    The position of the limb most suitable for the operation is exactly that we  have described as most convenient for the plantar excision. The animal is  cast, preferably anaesthetized, and the limb removed from the hobbles, and  held as far forward as is possible by an assistant with the side-line.    Professor Hobday's description of the operation is as follows:    'A bold incision is made through the skin and aponcurotic portion of  the pectoralis transversus and panniculus muscles, about 1 to 3 inches  (depending on the size of the horse) below the internal condyle of the  humerus, and immediately behind the ridge formed by the radius. This  latter, and the nerve which can be felt passing over the elbow-joint, form  the chief landmarks. The haemorrhage which ensues is principally venous, and  is easily controlled by the artery forceps. In some cases I have found it  of advantage to put on a tourniquet below the seat of operation, but this  is not always advisable, as it distends the radial artery. We now have  exposed to view the glistening white fascia of the arm, which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11212"],[0,"Modern India (#17)"],[1,"the bearers have brought the body into the anteroom of the  tower they strip it entirely of its clothing. Valuable coverings  are carefully laid away and sent to the chamber of purification,  where they are thoroughly fumigated, and afterward returned to  the friends. The cotton wrappings are burned. The body is laid  in one of the compartments entirely naked, and in half an hour  the flesh is completely stripped from the bones by voracious  birds that have been eagerly watching the proceedings from the  tops of the tall palms that overlook the cemetery. There are  about two hundred vultures around the place; most of them are  old birds and are thoroughly educated. They know exactly what  to expect, and behave with greatest decorum. They never enter  the tower until the bearers have left it, and usually are as  deliberate and solemn in their movements as a lot of undertakers.  But sometimes, when they are particularly hungry, their greed  gets the better of their dignity and they quarrel and fight over  their prey.    After the bones are stripped they are allowed to lie in the sun  and bleach and decay until the compartment they occupy is needed  for another body, when the Nasr Salars enter with gloves and  tongs and cast them into the central pit, where they finally  crumble into dust. The floor of the tower is so arranged that all  the rain that falls upon it passes into the pit, and the moisture  promotes decomposition. The bottom of the pit is perforated and  the water impregnated with the dust from the bones is filtered  through charcoal and becomes thoroughly disinfected before it  is allowed to pass through a sewer into the bay. The pits are  the receptacles of the dust of generations, and I am told that  so much of it is drained off by the rainfall, as described, that  they have never been filled. The carriers are not allowed to  leave the grounds, and when a man engages in that occupation  he must retire forever from the world, as much as if he were  a Trappist monk. Nor can he communicate with anyone except the  priests who have charge of the temple.    The grounds are beautifully laid out. No money or labor has been  spared to make them attractive, and comfortable benches have  been placed along the walks where relatives and friends may sit  and converse or meditate after the ceremonies are concluded.  The Parsees are firm believers in the resurrection, and they  expect their mutilated bodies to rise again glorified and  incorruptible. The theory upon which their peculiar custom is  based is veneration for the elements. Fire is the chief object  of their worship, and they cannot allow it to be polluted by  burning the dead; water is almost as sacred, and the soil of  the earth is the source of their food, their strength and almost  everything that is beautiful. Furthermore, they believe in the  equality of all creatures before God, and hence the dust of the  rich and the poor mingles in the pit.    Parsee temples are very plain and the form of worship is extremely  simple. None but members of the faith are admitted. The interior  of the temple is almost empty, except for a reading desk occupied  by the priest. The walls are without the slightest decoration and  are usually whitewashed. The sacred fire, the emblem of spiritual  life, which is never extinguished, is kept in a small recess  in a golden receptacle, and is attended by priests without  interruption. They relieve each other every two hours, but the  fire is never left alone.    The Mohammedans have many mosques in Bombay, but none of them  is of particular interest. The Hindu or Brahmin temples are also  commonplace, with two exceptions. One of them, known as the Monkey  Temple, is covered with carved images of monkeys and other animals.  There are said to be 300 of them, measuring from six inches to  two feet in height. The other is the \"Walkeshwar,\" dedicated to  the \"Sand Lord\" occupying a point upon the shore of the bay not  far from the water. It has been a holy place for many centuries.  The legend says that not long after the creation of the world  Rama, one of the most powerful of the gods, while on his way  to Ceylon to recover Stia, his bride, who had been kidnaped,  halted and camped there for a night and went through various  experiences which make a long and tedious story, but of profound  interest to Hindu theologians and students of mythology. The  temple is about 150 years old, but does not compare with those  in other cities of India. It is surrounded by various buildings  for the residence of the Brahmins, lodging places for pilgrims  and devotees, which are considered excellent examples of Hindu  architecture. Several wealthy families have cottages on the grounds  which they occupy for a few days each year on festival occasions  or as retreats.    [Illustration: BODY READY FOR THE FUNERAL PYRE--BOMBAY BURNING  GHATS]    Upon the land side of the boulevard which skirts the shore of  the bay, not far from the university of Bombay, is the burning  ghat of the Hindus, where the bodies of their dead are cremated  in the open air and in a remarkably rude and indifferent manner.  The proceedings may be witnessed by any person who takes the  trouble to visit the place and has the patience to wait for the  arrival of a body. It is just as public as a burial in any cemetery  in the United States. Bodies are kept only a few hours after  death. Those who die at night are burned the first thing in the  morning, so that curious people are usually gratified if they  visit the place early. Immediately after a poor Hindu sufferer  breathes his last the family retire and professional undertakers  are brought in. The latter bathe the body carefully, dress it  in plain white cotton cloth, wrap it in a sheet, with the head  carefully concealed, place it upon a rude bier made of two bamboo  poles and cross pieces, with a net work of ropes between, and  four men, with the ends of the poles on their shoulders, start  for the burning ghat at a dog trot, singing a mournful song.  Sometimes they are followed by the sons or the brothers of the  deceased, who remain through the burning to see that it is properly  done, but more often that duty is entrusted to an employe or a  servant or some humble friend of the family in whom they have  confidence. Arriving at the burning ghat, negotiations are opened  with the superintendent or manager, for they are usually private  enterprises or belong to corporations and are conducted very  much like our cemeteries. The cheapest sort of fire that can be  provided costs two rupees, which is sixty-six cents in American  money, and prices range from that amount upwards according to the  caste and the wealth of the family. When a rich man's body is  burned sandal-wood and other scented fuel is used and sometimes  the fire is very expensive. After an agreement is reached coolies  employed on the place make a pile of wood, one layer pointing  one way and the next crossed at right angles, a hole left in  the center being filled with kindling and quick-burning reeds.  The body is lifted from the bier and placed upon it, then more  wood is piled on and the kindling is lit with a torch. If there  is plenty of dry fuel the corpse is reduced to ashes in about  two hours. Usually the ashes are claimed by friends, who take  them to the nearest temple and after prayers and other ceremonies  cast them into the waters of the bay.    The death rate in Bombay is very large. The bubonic plague prevails  there with a frightful mortality. Hence cremation is safer than  burial. In the province of Bombay the total deaths from all diseases  average about 600,000 a year, and you can calculate what an enormous  area would be required for cemeteries. In 1900, on account of  the famine, the deaths ran up to 1,318,783, and in 1902 they  were more than 800,000. Of these 128,259 were from the plague,  13,600 from cholera, 5,340 from smallpox, and 2,212 from other  contagious diseases. Hence the burning ghats were very useful,  for at least 80 percent of the dead were Brahmins and their bodies  were disposed of in that way.    It is difficult to give an accurate idea of Brahminism in a brief  manner, but theoretically it is based upon the principles set  forth in a series of sacred books known as the Vedas, written  about 4,000 years ago. Its gods were originally physical forces  and phenomena--nature worship,--which was once common to all  men, the sun, fire, water, light, wind, the procreative and  productive energies and the mystery of sex and birth, which impressed  with wonder and awe the mind of primitive humanity. As these  deities became more and more vague and indefinite in the popular  mind, and the simple, instinctive appeal of the human soul to  a Power it could not see or comprehend was gradually debased  into what is now known as Brahminism, and the most repugnant,  revolting, cruel, obscene and vicious rites ever practiced by  savages or barbarians. There is nothing in the Vedas to justify  the cruelties of the Hindu gods and the practices of the priests.  They do not authorize animal worship, caste, child-marriage,  the burning of widows or perpetual widowhood, but the Brahmins  have built up a stupendous system of superstition, of which they  alone pretend to know the mystic meaning, and their supremacy is  established. Thus the nature worship of the Vedas has disappeared  and has given place to terrorism, demon worship, obscenity, and  idolatry.    The three great gods of the Hindus are Siva, Vishnu and Brahma,  with innumerable minor deities, some 30,000,000 altogether, which  have been created during emergencies from time to time by worshipers  of vivid imaginations. When we speak of Hinduism or Brahminism as  a religion, however, it is only a conventional use of a term,  because it is not a religion in the sense that we are accustomed  to apply that word. In all other creeds there is an element of  ethics; morality,"]]]
