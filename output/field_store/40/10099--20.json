[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10554"],[0,"Right Ho, Jeeves (#17)"],[1,"the sort of girl Madeline Bassett was--stars and  rabbits and all that, I mean--you might say that a sober sadness would  have been more fitting. But in these matters you have got to realize that  tastes differ. The impulse of right-thinking men might be to run a mile  when they saw the Bassett, but for some reason she appealed to the deeps  in Gussie, so that was that.    I had reached this point in my meditations, when I was aroused by the  sound of the door opening. Somebody came in and started moving like a  leopard toward the side-table and, lowering the feet, I perceived that it  was Tuppy Glossop.    The sight of him gave me a momentary twinge of remorse, reminding me, as  it did, that in the excitement of getting Gussie fixed up I had rather  forgotten about this other client. It is often that way when you're  trying to run two cases at once.    However, Gussie now being off my mind, I was prepared to devote my whole  attention to the Glossop problem.    I had been much pleased by the way he had carried out the task assigned  him at the dinner-table. No easy one, I can assure you, for the browsing  and sluicing had been of the highest quality, and there had been one dish  in particular--I allude to the _nonnettes de poulet Agnes Sorel_--which  might well have broken down the most iron resolution. But he had passed  it up like a professional fasting man, and I was proud of him.    \"Oh, hullo, Tuppy,\" I said, \"I wanted to see you.\"    He turned, snifter in hand, and it was easy to see that his privations  had tried him sorely. He was looking like a wolf on the steppes of Russia  which has seen its peasant shin up a high tree.    \"Yes?\" he said, rather unpleasantly. \"Well, here I am.\"    \"Well?\"    \"How do you mean----well?\"    \"Make your report.\"    \"What report?\"    \"Have you nothing to tell me about Angela?\"    \"Only that she's a blister.\"    I was concerned.    \"Hasn't she come clustering round you yet?\"    \"She has not.\"    \"Very odd.\"    \"Why odd?\"    \"She must have noted your lack of appetite.\"    He barked raspingly, as if he were having trouble with the tonsils of the  soul.    \"Lack of appetite! I'm as hollow as the Grand Canyon.\"    \"Courage, Tuppy! Think of Gandhi.\"    \"What about Gandhi?\"    \"He hasn't had a square meal for years.\"    \"Nor have I. Or I could swear I hadn't. Gandhi, my left foot.\"    I saw that it might be best to let the Gandhi _motif_ slide. I went back  to where we had started.    \"She's probably looking for you now.\"    \"Who is? Angela?\"    \"Yes. She must have noticed your supreme sacrifice.\"    \"I don't suppose she noticed it at all, the little fathead. I'll bet it  didn't register in any way whatsoever.\"    \"Come, Tuppy,\" I urged, \"this is morbid. Don't take this gloomy view. She  must at least have spotted that you refused those _nonnettes de poulet  Agnes Sorel_. It was a sensational renunciation and stuck out like a sore  thumb. And the _cepes a la Rossini_----\"    A hoarse cry broke from his twisted lips:    \"Will you stop it, Bertie! Do you think I am made of marble? Isn't it bad  enough to have sat watching one of Anatole's supremest dinners flit by,  course after course, without having you making a song about it? Don't  remind me of those _nonnettes_. I can't stand it.\"    I endeavoured to hearten and console.    \"Be brave, Tuppy. Fix your thoughts on that cold steak-and-kidney pie in  the larder. As the Good Book says, it cometh in the morning.\"    \"Yes, in the morning. And it's now about half-past nine at night. You  would bring that pie up, wouldn't you? Just when I was trying to keep my  mind off it.\"    I saw what he meant. Hours must pass before he could dig into that pie.  I dropped the subject, and we sat for a pretty good time in silence. Then  he rose and began to pace the room in an overwrought sort of way, like a  zoo lion who has heard the dinner-gong go and is hoping the keeper won't  forget him in the general distribution. I averted my gaze tactfully, but  I could hear him kicking chairs and things. It was plain that the man's  soul was in travail and his blood pressure high.    Presently he returned to his seat, and I saw that he was looking at me  intently. There was that about his demeanour that led me to think that he  had something to communicate.    Nor was I wrong. He tapped me significantly on the knee and spoke:    \"Bertie.\"    \"Hullo?\"    \"Shall I tell you something?\"    \"Certainly, old bird,\" I said cordially. \"I was just beginning to feel  that the scene could do with a bit more dialogue.\"    \"This business of Angela and me.\"    \"Yes?\"    \"I've been putting in a lot of solid thinking about it.\"    \"Oh, yes?\"    \"I have analysed the situation pitilessly, and one thing stands out as  clear as dammit. There has been dirty work afoot.\"    \"I don't get you.\"    \"All right. Let me review the facts. Up to the time she went to Cannes  Angela loved me. She was all over me. I was the blue-eyed boy in every  sense of the term. You'll admit that?\"    \"Indisputably.\"    \"And directly she came back we had this bust-up.\"    \"Quite.\"    \"About nothing.\"    \"Oh, dash it, old man, nothing? You were a bit tactless, what, about her  shark.\"    \"I was frank and candid about her shark. And that's my point. Do you  seriously believe that a trifling disagreement about sharks would make a  girl hand a man his hat, if her heart were really his?\"    \"Certainly.\"    It beats me why he couldn't see it. But then poor old Tuppy has never  been very hot on the finer shades. He's one of those large, tough,  football-playing blokes who lack the more delicate sensibilities, as I've  heard Jeeves call them. Excellent at blocking a punt or walking across an  opponent's face in cleated boots, but not so good when it comes to  understanding the highly-strung female temperament. It simply wouldn't  occur to him that a girl might be prepared to give up her life's  happiness rather than waive her shark.    \"Rot! It was just a pretext.\"    \"What was?\"    \"This shark business. She wanted to get rid of me, and grabbed at the  first excuse.\"    \"No, no.\"    \"I tell you she did.\"    \"But what on earth would she want to get rid of you for?\"    \"Exactly. That's the very question I asked myself. And here's the answer:  Because she has fallen in love with somebody else. It sticks out a mile.  There's no other possible solution. She goes to Cannes all for me, she  comes back all off me. Obviously during those two months, she must have  transferred her affections to some foul blister she met out there.\"    \"No, no.\"    \"Don't keep saying 'No, no'. She must have done. Well, I'll tell you one  thing, and you can take this as official. If ever I find this slimy,  slithery snake in the grass, he had better make all the necessary  arrangements at his favourite nursing-home without delay, because I am  going to be very rough with him. I propose, if and when found, to take  him by his beastly neck, shake him till he froths, and pull him inside  out and make him swallow himself.\"    With which words he biffed off; and I, having given him a minute or two  to get out of the way, rose and made for the drawing-room. The tendency  of females to roost in drawing-rooms after dinner being well marked, I  expected to find Angela there. It was my intention to have a word with  Angela.    To Tuppy's theory that some insinuating bird had stolen the girl's heart  from him at Cannes I had given, as I have indicated, little credence,  considering it the mere unbalanced apple sauce of a bereaved man. It was,  of course, the shark, and nothing but the shark, that had caused love's  young dream to go temporarily off the boil, and I was convinced that a  word or two with the cousin at this juncture would set everything right.    For, frankly, I thought it incredible that a girl of her natural  sweetness and tender-heartedness should not have been moved to her  foundations by what she had seen at dinner that night. Even Seppings,  Aunt Dahlia's butler, a cold, unemotional man, had gasped and practically  reeled when Tuppy waved aside those _nonnettes de poulet Agnes Sorel_,  while the footman, standing by with the potatoes, had stared like one  seeing a vision. I simply refused to consider the possibility of the  significance of the thing having been lost on a nice girl like Angela. I  fully expected to find her in the drawing-room with her heart bleeding  freely, all ripe for an immediate reconciliation.    In the drawing-room, however, when I entered, only Aunt Dahlia met the  eye. It seemed to me that she gave me rather a jaundiced look as I hove  in sight, but this, having so recently beheld Tuppy in his agony, I  attributed to the fact that she, like him, had been going light on the  menu. You can't expect an empty aunt to beam like a full aunt.    \"Oh, it's you, is it?\" she said.    Well, it was, of course.    \"Where's Angela?\" I asked.    \"Gone to bed.\"    \"Already?\"    \"She said she had a headache.\"    \"H'm.\"    I wasn't so sure that I liked the sound of that so much. A girl who has  observed the sundered lover sensationally off his feed does not go to bed  with headaches if love has been reborn in her heart. She sticks around  and gives him the swift, remorseful glance from beneath the drooping  eyelashes and generally endeavours to convey to him that, if he wants to  get together across a round table and try to find a formula, she is all  for it too. Yes, I am bound to say I found that going-to-bed stuff a bit  disquieting.    \"Gone to bed, eh?\" I murmured musingly.    \"What did you want her for?\"    \"I thought she might like a stroll and a chat.\"    \"Are you going for a stroll?\" said Aunt Dahlia, with a sudden show of  interest. \"Where?\"    \"Oh, hither and thither.\"    \"Then I wonder if you would mind doing something for me.\"    \"Give it a name.\"    \"It won't take you long. You know that path that runs past the  greenhouses into the kitchen garden. If you go along it, you come to a  pond.\"    \"That'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10556"],[0,"The Old Man in the Corner (#17)"],[1,"gentleman, in a magnificent fur coat, stepped quickly out of  a cab which had been stationed near the kerb, and, touching him lightly  upon the shoulder, said with an unmistakable air of authority, at the  same time handing him a card:    \"'That is my name. I must speak with you immediately.\"    \"Schwarz glanced at the card, and by the light of the arc lamps above  his head read on it the name of 'Dimitri Slaviansky Burgreneff, de la  IIIe Section de la Police Imperial de S.M. le Czar.'    \"Quickly the owner of the unpronounceable name and the significant title  pointed to the cab from which he had just alighted, and Schwarz, whose  every suspicion with regard to his princely customer bristled up in one  moment, clutched his bag and followed his imposing interlocutor; as soon  as they were both comfortably seated in the cab the latter began, with  courteous apology in broken but fluent English:    \"'I must ask your pardon, sir, for thus trespassing upon your valuable  time, and I certainly should not have done so but for the certainty that  our interests in a certain matter which I have in hand are practically  identical, in so far that we both should wish to outwit a clever rogue.'    \"Instinctively, and his mind full of terrible apprehension, Mr.  Schwarz's hand wandered to his pocket-book, filled to overflowing with  the bank-notes which he had so lately received from the Prince.    \"'Ah, I see,' interposed the courteous Russian with a smile, 'he has  played the confidence trick on you, with the usual addition of so many  so-called bank-notes.'    \"'So-called,' gasped the unfortunate young man.    \"'I don't think I often err in my estimate of my own countrymen,'  continued M. Burgreneff; 'I have vast experience, you must remember.  Therefore, I doubt if I am doing M.--er--what does he call  himself?--Prince something--an injustice if I assert, even without  handling those crisp bits of paper you have in your pocket-book, that no  bank would exchange them for gold.'    \"Remembering his uncle's suspicions and his own, Mr. Schwarz cursed  himself for his blindness and folly in accepting notes so easily without  for a moment imagining that they might be false. Now, with every one of  those suspicions fully on the alert, he felt the bits of paper with  nervous, anxious fingers, while the imperturbable Russian calmly struck  a match.    \"'See here,' he said, pointing to one of the notes, 'the shape of that  \"w\" in the signature of the chief cashier. I am not an English police  officer, but I could pick out that spurious \"w\" among a thousand genuine  ones. You see, I have seen a good many.'    \"Now, of course, poor young Schwarz had not seen very many Bank of  England notes. He could not have told whether one 'w' in Mr. Bowen's  signature is better than another, but, though he did not speak English  nearly as fluently as his pompous interlocutor, he understood every word  of the appalling statement the latter had just made.    \"'Then that Prince,' he said, 'at the hotel--'    \"'Is no more Prince than you and I, my dear sir,' concluded the  gentleman of His Imperial Majesty's police calmly.    \"'And the jewels? Mr. Winslow's jewels?'    \"'With the jewels there may be a chance--oh! a mere chance. These forged  bank-notes, which you accepted so trustingly, may prove the means of  recovering your property.'    \"'How?'    \"'The penalty of forging and circulating spurious bank-notes is very  heavy. You know that. The fear of seven years' penal servitude will act  as a wonderful sedative upon the--er--Prince's joyful mood. He will give  up the jewels to me all right enough, never you fear. He knows,' added  the Russian officer grimly, 'that there are plenty of old scores to  settle up, without the additional one of forged bank-notes. Our  interests, you see, are identical. May I rely on your co-operation?'    \"'Oh, I will do as you wish,' said the delighted young German. 'Mr.  Winslow and Mr. Vassall, they trusted me, and I have been such a fool. I  hope it is not too late.'    \"'I think not,' said M. Burgreneff, his hand already on the door of the  cab. 'Though I have been talking to you I have kept an eye on the hotel,  and our friend the Prince has not yet gone out. We are accustomed, you  know, to have eyes everywhere, we of the Russian secret police. I don't  think that I will ask you to be present at the confrontation. Perhaps  you will wait for me in the cab. There is a nasty fog outside, and you  will be more private. Will you give me those beautiful bank-notes? Thank  you! Don't be anxious. I won't be long.'    \"He lifted his hat, and slipped the notes into the inner pocket of his  magnificent fur coat. As he did so, Mr. Schwarz caught sight of a rich  uniform and a wide sash, which no doubt was destined to carry additional  moral weight with the clever rogue upstairs.    \"Then His Imperial Majesty's police officer stepped quickly out of the  cab, and Mr. Schwarz was left alone.\"          CHAPTER XIII    A CUNNING RASCAL      \"Yes, left severely alone,\" continued the man in the corner with a  sarcastic chuckle. \"So severely alone, in fact, that one quarter of an  hour after another passed by and still the magnificent police officer in  the gorgeous uniform did not return. Then, when it was too late, Schwarz  cursed himself once again for the double-dyed idiot that he was. He had  been only too ready to believe that Prince Semionicz was a liar and a  rogue, and under these unjust suspicions he had fallen an all too easy  prey to one of the most cunning rascals he had ever come across.    \"An inquiry from the hall porter at the North-Western elicited the fact  that no such personage as Mr. Schwarz described had entered the hotel.  The young man asked to see Prince Semionicz, hoping against hope that  all was not yet lost. The Prince received him most courteously; he was  dictating some letters to his secretary, while the valet was in the next  room preparing his master's evening clothes. Mr. Schwarz found it very  difficult to explain what he actually did want.    \"There stood the dressing-case in which the Prince had locked up the  jewels, and there the bag from which the secretary had taken the  bank-notes. After much hesitation on Schwarz's part and much impatience  on that of the Prince, the young man blurted out the whole story of the  so-called Russian police officer whose card he still held in his hand.    \"The Prince, it appears, took the whole thing wonderfully  good-naturedly; no doubt he thought the jeweller a hopeless fool. He  showed him the jewels, the receipt he held, and also a large bundle of  bank-notes similar to those Schwarz had with such culpable folly given  up to the clever rascal in the cab.    \"'I pay all my bills with Bank of England notes, Mr. Schwarz. It would  have been wiser, perhaps, if you had spoken to the manager of the hotel  about me before you were so ready to believe any cock-and-bull story  about my supposed rogueries.'    \"Finally he placed a small 16mo volume before the young jeweller, and  said with a pleasant smile:    \"'If people in this country who are in a large way of business, and are  therefore likely to come in contact with people of foreign nationality,  were to study these little volumes before doing business with any  foreigner who claims a title, much disappointment and a great loss would  often be saved. Now in this case had you looked up page 797 of this  little volume of Gotha's Almanach you would have seen my name in it and  known from the first that the so-called Russian detective was a liar.'    \"There was nothing more to be said, and Mr. Schwarz left the hotel. No  doubt, now that he had been hopelessly duped he dared not go home, and  half hoped by communicating with the police that they might succeed in  arresting the thief before he had time to leave Liverpool. He  interviewed Detective-Inspector Watson, and was at once confronted with  the awful difficulty which would make the recovery of the bank-notes  practically hopeless. He had never had the time or opportunity of  jotting down the numbers of the notes.    \"Mr. Winslow, though terribly wrathful against his nephew, did not wish  to keep him out of his home. As soon as he had received Schwarz's  letter, he traced him, with Inspector Watson's help, to his lodgings in  North Street, where the unfortunate young man meant to remain hidden  until the terrible storm had blown over, or perhaps until the thief had  been caught red-handed with the booty still in his hands.    \"This happy event, needless to say, never did occur, though the police  made every effort to trace the man who had decoyed Schwarz into the cab.  His appearance was such an uncommon one; it seemed most unlikely that no  one in Liverpool should have noticed him after he left that cab. The  wonderful fur coat, the long beard, all must have been noticeable, even  though it was past four o'clock on a somewhat foggy December afternoon.    \"But every investigation proved futile; no one answering Schwarz's  description of the man had been seen anywhere. The papers continued to  refer to the case as 'the Liverpool Mystery.' Scotland Yard sent Mr.  Fairburn down--the celebrated detective--at the request of the Liverpool  police, to help in the investigations, but nothing availed.    \"Prince Semionicz, with his suite, left Liverpool, and he who had  attempted to blacken his character, and had succeeded in robbing Messrs.  Winslow and Vassall of L10,500, had completely disappeared.\"    The man in the corner readjusted his collar and necktie, which, during  the narrative of this interesting mystery, had worked its way up his  long, crane-like neck under his large flappy ears. His costume of  checked tweed of a peculiarly loud pattern had tickled the fancy of some  of the waitresses, who were standing gazing at him and giggling in one  corner. This evidently made him nervous. He gazed up very meekly at  Polly, looking for all the world like a "]]]
