He rode towards the Maple Gate, excusing  his haste volubly to Sir Constans, who was on foot, and walked beside  him a little way, pressing him to take some refreshment.    His sons overtook the Baron as he walked towards home, and walked by his  side in silence. Sir Constans was full of his fruit.    \"The wall cherry,\" said he, \"will soon have a few ripe.\"    Oliver swore a deep but soundless oath in his chest. Sir Constans  continued talking about his fruit and flowers, entirely oblivious of the  silent anger of the pair beside him. As they approached the house, the  warder blew his horn thrice for noon. It was also the signal for dinner.          CHAPTER VI    THE FOREST TRACK      When the canoe was finished, Oliver came to help Felix launch it, and  they rolled it on logs down to the place where the stream formed a pool.  But when it was afloat, as Oliver had foretold, it did not swim upright  in the water. It had not been shaped accurately, and one side was higher  out of the water than the other.    Felix was so disgusted at this failure that he would not listen to  anything Oliver could suggest. He walked back to the spot where he had  worked so many weeks, and sat down with his face turned from the pool.  It was not so much the actual circumstance which depressed him, as the  long train of untoward incidents which had preceded it for years past.  These seemed to have accumulated, till now this comparatively little  annoyance was like the last straw.    Oliver followed him, and said that the defect could be remedied by  placing ballast on the more buoyant side of the canoe to bring it down  to the level of the other; or, perhaps, if some more wood were cut away  on the heavier side, that it would cause it to rise. He offered to do  the work himself, but Felix, in his gloomy mood, would not answer him.  Oliver returned to the pool, and getting into the canoe, poled it up and  down the stream. It answered perfectly, and could be easily managed; the  defect was more apparent than real, for when a person sat in the canoe,  his weight seemed to bring it nearly level.    It was only when empty that it canted to one side. He came back again to  Felix, and pointed this out to him. The attempt was useless; the boat  might answer the purpose perfectly well, but it was not the boat Felix  had intended it to be. It did not come up to his ideal.    Oliver was now somewhat annoyed at Felix's sullen silence, so he drew  the canoe partly on shore, to prevent it from floating away, and then  left him to himself.    Nothing more was said about it for a day or two. Felix did not go near  the spot where he had worked so hard and so long, but on the Saturday  Philip came home as usual, and, as there was now no secret about the  canoe, went down to look at it with Oliver. They pushed it off, and  floated two or three miles down the stream, hauling it on the shore past  the fallen fir tree, and then, with a cord, towed it back again. The  canoe, with the exception of the trifling deficiency alluded to, was a  good one, and thoroughly serviceable.    They endeavoured again to restore Felix's opinion of it, and an idea  occurring to Philip, he said a capital plan would be to add an  outrigger, and so balance it perfectly. But though usually quick to  adopt ideas when they were good, in this case Felix was too much out of  conceit with himself. He would listen to nothing. Still, he could not  banish it from his mind, though now ashamed to return to it after so  obstinately refusing all suggestions. He wandered aimlessly about in the  woods, till one day he found himself in the path that led to Heron Bay.    Strolling to the shore of the great Lake, he sat down and watched a  vessel sailing afar off slowly before the east wind. The thought  presently occurred to him, that the addition of an outrigger in the  manner Philip had mentioned would enable him to carry a sail. The canoe  could not otherwise support a sail (unless a very small one merely for  going before the breeze), but with such a sail as the outrigger would  bear, he could venture much farther away from land, his voyage might be  much more extended, and his labour with the paddle lessened.    This filled him with fresh energy; he returned, and at once recommenced  work. Oliver, finding that he was again busy at it, came and insisted  upon assisting. With his help, the work progressed rapidly. He used the  tools so deftly as to accomplish more in an hour than Felix could in a  day. The outrigger consisted of a beam of poplar, sharpened at both  ends, and held at some six or seven feet from the canoe by two strong  cross-pieces.    A mast, about the same height as the canoe was long, was then set up; it  was made from a young fir-tree. Another smaller fir supplied the yard,  which extended fore and aft, nearly the length of the boat. The sail, of  coarse canvas, was not very high, but long, and rather broader at each  end where the rope attached it to the prow and stern, or, rather, the  two prows. Thus arranged, it was not so well suited for running straight  before the wind, as for working into it, a feat never attempted by the  ships of the time.    Oliver was delighted with the appearance of the boat, so much so that  now and then he announced his intention of accompanying Felix on his  voyage. But after a visit to the town, and a glance at the Princess  Lucia, his resolution changed. Yet he wavered, one time openly  reproaching himself for enduring such a life of inaction and ignominy,  and at another deriding Felix and his visionary schemes. The canoe was  now completed; it was tried on the pool and found to float exactly as it  should. It had now to be conveyed to Heron Bay.    The original intention was to put it on a cart, but the rude carts used  on the estate could not very well carry it, and a sledge was  substituted. Several times, during the journey through the forest, the  sledge had to be halted while the underwood was cut away to permit of  its passing; and once a slough had to be filled up with branches hewn  from fir trees, and bundles of fern. These delays made it evening before  the shore of the creek was reached.    It was but a little inlet, scarce a bowshot wide at the entrance and  coming to a point inland. Here the canoe was left in charge of three  serfs, who were ordered to build a hut and stay beside it. Some  provisions were sent next day on the backs of other serfs, and in the  afternoon (it was Saturday) all three brothers arrived; the canoe was  launched, and they started for a trial sail. With a south wind they ran  to the eastward at a rapid pace, keeping close to the shore till within  a mile of White Horse.    There they brought to by steering the canoe dead against the wind; then  transferring the steering-paddle (a rather large one, made for the  purpose) to the other end, and readjusting the sail, the outrigger being  still to leeward, they ran back at an equal speed. The canoe answered  perfectly, and Felix was satisfied. He now despatched his tools and  various weapons to the hut to be put on board. His own peculiar yew bow  he kept to the last at home; it and his chest bound with hide would go  with him on the last day.    Although, in his original purpose, Felix had designed to go forth  without anyone being aware of his intention, the circumstances which had  arisen, and the necessary employment of so many men, had let out the  secret to some degree. The removal of the tools and weapons, the  crossbow, darts, and spear, still more attracted attention. But little  or nothing was said about it, though the Baron and Baroness could not  help but observe these preparations. The Baron deliberately shut his  eyes and went about his gardening; he was now, too, busy with the first  mowing. In his heart, perhaps, he felt that he had not done altogether  right in so entirely retiring from the world.    By doing so he had condemned his children to loneliness, and to be  regarded with contempt. Too late now, he could only obstinately persist  in his course. The Baroness, inured for so many, many years to  disappointment, had contracted her view of life till it scarcely  extended beyond mere physical comfort. Nor could she realize the idea of  Felix's approaching departure; when he was actually gone, it would,  perhaps, come home to her.    All was now ready, and Felix was only waiting for the Feast of St. James  to pay a last visit to Aurora at Thyma Castle. The morning before the  day of the Feast, Felix and Oliver set out together. They had not lived  altogether in harmony, but now, at this approaching change, Oliver felt  that he must bear Felix company. Oliver rode his beautiful Night, he  wore his plumed hat and precious sword, and carried his horseman's  lance. Felix rode a smaller horse, useful, but far from handsome. He  carried his yew bow and hunting knife.    Thyma Castle was situated fifteen miles to the south; it was the last  outpost of civilization; beyond it there was nothing but forest, and the  wild open plains, the home of the gipsies. This circumstance of position  had given Baron Thyma, in times past, a certain importance more than was  due to the size of his estate or the number of his retainers. During an  invasion of the gipsies, his castle bore the brunt of the war, and its  gallant defence, indeed, broke their onward progress. So many fell in  endeavouring to take it, that the rest were disheartened, and only  scattered bands penetrated beyond.    For this service the Baron received the grant of various privileges; he  was looked on as a pillar of the State, and was welcome at the court.  But it proved an injury to him in the end. His honours, and the high  society they led him into, were too great for the comparative smallness  of his income. Rich in flocks and herds, he had but little coin.

Our engraving represents a new departure in shaft turning lathes, and is  the result of thirty years' experience in the manufacture of shafting,  with many years' study, to perfect a machine of the greatest practical  capacity and efficiency.    [Illustration: IMPROVED SHAFTING LATHE.]    The principal points of difference from a common engine lathe are readily  distinguished, among which may be mentioned the absence of centers and  tail stock, a traveling head with hollow driving spindle, and a stationary  tool rest and water tank. By dispensing with a tail stock a much shorter  bed may be used, and the hollow driving spindle enables any length shaft  to be turned, with one setting of the tools. The tool rest is so arranged  as to allow of perfect lubrication of the tools, keeping the shaft cool,  and at the same time holding it perfectly rigid and strong; the operator  is not required to travel the length of the bed, but remains near the  driving belt, feed gearing, etc. Power is communicated to the driving  spindle by means of a sliding pinion on a splined rod inside the bed, the  driving belt and gears being at the end.    The driving head, after having traveled the length of the bed and turned a  shaft, is returned by a quick feed, and stops automatically, allowing  nearly time enough for the operator to grind tools and be ready with  another shaft, thus economizing the time completely.    Wood, Jennison & Co., Worcester, Mass., are the makers, and they say that  with a good quality of iron they have turned three hundred feet of two  inch iron in ten hours.           *       *       *       *       *          POWER STRAIGHTENING MACHINE.      The machine is provided with a pair of rolls at each end of the bed, which  are adjustable for different lengths of shaft, and are made to revolve by  power applied through suitable gearing and a splined rod inside the bed;  the bar of iron being placed on the periphery of the rolls receives a  rotary motion by friction, and shows the crooked places in the same way  and with the same ease as though rotating on centers in the usual manner;  vertically adjustable blocks are arranged in the base of the press to  support the iron; power is applied by means of gearing to a splined rod at  the back of the machine, on which is a sliding clutch connecting, at the  will of the operator, with an eccentric; the eccentric conveys motion and  power through a link to the elbow joint at the front of the press, which  forces a plunger down against the iron.    [Illustration: POWER STRAIGHTENING MACHINE.]    Sufficient adjustment is provided for different sizes of iron by turning a  nut at the top of the press.    Any point in the length of the bar can be reached by moving the press on  the bed. Any length of iron can be straightened, and the most laborious  and disagreeable work in the process of making shafting is rendered easy  and rapid.

Our knowledge of the primitive operations of the aboriginal inhabitants of  the globe in pursuit of gold is barely traditional, as we are only aware  that from very early times the precious metal was collected and highly  prized by them, and that they chiefly extracted the visible gold, which  existed in prodigious quantities on or closely beneath the surface of the  earth, and of its being particularly abundant in Asia and Africa. But we  can draw more positive conclusions as we survey remains of the rude but  effective contrivances used by them in later, but still remote, periods,  with full evidence as to the extent of their operations, in the numerous  perpendicular shafts located at short distances from each other, over  large areas of auriferous gravel in India, as well as from precisely  similar memorials of ancient workings which remain also further  demonstrations, in the abandoned \"hill diggings,\" and shifted beds, and  beds of rivers, in Peru South America, flowing between the sea and coast  ranges of the Andes, descending in a northeasterly direction to the river  Amazon, and that their much coveted and enormous productions were the  accumulated riches of the Incas, transferred as spoils of war to their  Spanish conquerors in the sixteenth century. And for similar explorations  in the same class of depositions we have the experiences of our own times,  and which explain by comparison all the previous operations alluded to.    Thus in the year 1849, after the cession of the northern portion of Mexico  to the United States of North America, the rich mineral district of  California was at once invaded by hardy and intelligent bands of mining  adventurers from all parts of the world, who, with little other means at  their disposal but pick, shovel, and pan, soon fell on the productive bars  of rivers and rich ravines where the gold was trapped, derived from its  original birthplaces, where it had been sparsely disseminated, to be  dispersed by the subsequent disintegrations and denudations of the  mountains themselves, and deposited in a disengaged form for the first  comer; and so perfect were sometimes these concentrations, in certain  localities where water once streamed, that, divested of its earthy matrix,  the cleansed pure metal was found deposited, detained by its superior  specific gravity, on the bare rock, and only hidden from vision by a  slight covering of vegetable mould. In this manner, as an example of such  concentration, a \"pot\" or \"find\" (in mining parlance) to the value of  L10,000 was collected in a space of 15 square yards, or within the limits  of a particular \"mining claim,\" at the foot of Mokulumne Hill, in a  southern county of California, soon after the territorial transfer from  Mexico. And in search of such locations we must account for the numberless  shafts which still exist both in India and Peru, and sometimes sunk within  a few feet of each other, passing through the alluvium to a depth of 40  feet to the bed rock.    These mining adventurers soon extended their explorations over the other  recently acquired territories, and built Virginia City, the capital of  Montana, with the gold derived from the alluvium of a river channel which  they excavated; and its inhabitants were the founders of an institution  called the Vigilance Committee, with \"Lynch law,\" and by it ruled  supremely for many years. But their surface diggings, by the manual  operations alone of multitudes, were soon exhausted in every direction,  and then their energies and powers of invention were dedicated to discover  and explore deeper and more permanent depositions, along the western  slopes of the Sierra Nevada, the Andes of the Western Territories, and  which originally were without doubt several miles higher than they are at  the present time--probably 20,000 feet above the sea-level--and of which,  or whatever superior elevation they formerly had, the greater portion of  it has already been removed, by the continuous natural action of  centuries, to form there, as elsewhere, the plains and prairies of the  earth, burying and diverting by the mutation the ancient river system,  whose sources of supply were consequently extinguished by the removal of  these altitudes. These denudations and subsequent depositions have been  caused by alternations of temperature and combined action of air, water,  and time since the creation of the world; and powerful demonstrations of  these transformations instruct us in all directions, if we care to observe  them. Thus in \"Little Cottonwood\" ravine, in the Wahsatch range of  mountains in Utah Territory, lie isolated in the center of the valley huge  masses of metamorphic granite, some blocks of which weigh individually  thousands of tons, and were dislodged from the hills--which on either side  are of limestone formation--with no visible granite in them, having been  undermined by the removal of their pulverized basis by denudation, and  which is the material now forming the tablelands, the foundation, of Salt  Lake City. The blocks of granite, having alone resisted the atmospheric  changes, were precipitated into the valley beneath, and the Mormons are  now constructing their cathedral church from these granitic remains.    The melting of the snow which formerly capped all these ranges of  mountains furnished the water that once flowed in the extinguished  channels of ancient rivers, and whose now diverted waters were also the  powerful agent to assist in causing these marvelous alternations; and by  the means of hydraulic mining we can advance our feeble knowledge on the  subject.    These mighty changes have gradually been accomplished, and the accumulated  denudations of the mineral zones have defended themselves by strata of  crystallized silicates of quartz of various thicknesses, and thus in  places beneath such system of defense, or by their own concretion, have  preserved in many localities a thickness of from 500 to 600 feet of  conglomerate, but without this necessary cementation its further removal  is very certain when again attacked by water. An example of this  continuous process is very observable in \"Death Valley,\" Lower California,  where a width of about 100 miles has been filled up from the hills to the  gulf of same name, invading and occupying its former bed; and this  activity is still proceeding, and a temporary formation of tableland  above it is in course of removal, although already overgrown with forest  trees, which are toppling over the side which is being attacked. But  eternal snow now only covers a small portion of these Sierras, and a  period of comparative repose may be expected, as the distribution has  already been far "]]]
