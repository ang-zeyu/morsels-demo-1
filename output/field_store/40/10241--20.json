I'm no relative of yours or even a particular, close friend, but  I'd like to say--\"    \"Please don't,\" interposed Columbine.    \"All right, my girl. I guess it's better I don't say anythin'. It's a  pity, though, onless you love this Buster Jack. An' you never used to do  that, I'll swan.\"    \"No, I don't love Jack--yet--as I ought to love a husband. But I'll try,  and if--if I--I never do--still, it's my duty to marry him.\"    \"Some woman ought to talk to Bill Belllounds,\" declared Mrs. Andrews  with a grimness that boded ill for the old rancher.    \"Did you know we had a new man up at the ranch?\" asked Columbine,  changing the subject.    \"You mean the hunter, Hell-Bent Wade?\"    \"Yes. But I hate that ridiculous name,\" said Columbine.    \"It's queer, like lots of names men get in these parts. An' it'll stick.  Wade's been here twice; once as he was passin' with the hounds, an' the  other night. I like him, Columbine. He's true-blue, for all his strange  name. My men-folks took to him like ducks to water.\"    \"I'm glad. I took to him almost like that,\" rejoined Columbine. \"He has  the saddest face I ever saw.\"    \"Sad? Wal, yes. That man has seen a good deal of what they tacked on to  his name. I laughed when I seen him first. Little lame fellar,  crooked-legged an' ragged, with thet awful homely face! But I forgot how  he looked next time he came.\"    \"That's just it. He's not much to look at, but you forget his homeliness  right off,\" replied Columbine, warmly. \"You feel something behind all  his--his looks.\"    \"Wal, you an' me are women, an' we feel different,\" replied Mrs.  Andrews. \"Now my men-folks take much store on what Wade can _do_. He  fixed up Tom's gun, that's been out of whack for a year. He made our  clock run ag'in, an' run better than ever. Then he saved our cow from  that poison-weed. An' Tom gave her up to die.\"    \"The boys up home were telling me Mr. Wade had saved some of our cattle.  Dad was delighted. You know he's lost a good many head of stock from  this poison-weed. I saw so many dead steers on my last ride up the  mountain. It's too bad our new man didn't get here sooner to save them.  I asked him how he did it, and he said he was a doctor.\"    \"A cow-doctor,\" laughed Mrs. Andrews. \"Wal, that's a new one on me.  Accordin' to Tom, this here Wade, when he seen our sick cow, said she'd  eat poison-weed--larkspur, I think he called it--an' then when she drank  water it formed a gas in her stomach an' she swelled up turrible. Wade  jest stuck his knife in her side a little an' let the gas out, and she  got well.\"    \"Ughh!... What cruel doctoring! But if it saves the cattle, then it's  good.\"    \"It'll save them if they can be got to right off,\" replied Mrs. Andrews.    \"Speaking of doctors,\" went on Columbine, striving to make her query  casual, \"do you know whether or not Wilson Moore had his foot treated by  a doctor at Kremmling?\"    \"He did not,\" answered Mrs. Andrews. \"Wasn't no doctor there. They'd had  to send to Denver, an', as Wils couldn't take that trip or wait so long,  why, Mrs. Plummer fixed up his foot. She made a good job of it, too, as  I can testify.\"    \"Oh, I'm--very thankful!\" murmured Columbine. \"He'll not be crippled  or--or club-footed, then?\"    \"I reckon not. You can see for yourself. For Wils's here. He was drove  up night before last an' is stayin' with my brother-in-law--in the other  cabin there.\"    Mrs. Andrews launched all this swiftly, with evident pleasure, but with  more of woman's subtle motive. Her eyes were bent with shrewd kindness  upon the younger woman.    \"Here!\" exclaimed Columbine, with a start, and for an instant she was at  the mercy of conflicting surprise and joy and alarm. Alternately she  flushed and paled.    \"Sure he's here,\" replied Mrs. Andrews, now looking out of the door. \"He  ought to be in sight somewheres. He's walkin' with a crutch.\"    \"Crutch!\" cried Columbine, in dismay.    \"Yes, crutch, an' he made it himself.... I don't see him nowheres. Mebbe  he went in when he see you comin'. For he's powerful sensitive about  that crutch.\"    \"Then--if he's so--so sensitive, perhaps I'd better go,\" said Columbine,  struggling with embarrassment and discomfiture. What if she happened to  meet him! Would he imagine her purpose in coming there? Her heart began  to beat unwontedly.    \"Suit yourself, lass,\" replied Mrs. Andrews, kindly. \"I know you and  Wils quarreled, for he told me. An' it's a pity.... Wal, if you must go,  I hope you'll come again before the snow flies. Good-by.\"    Columbine bade her a hurried good-by and ventured forth with misgivings.  And almost around the corner of the second cabin, which she had to pass,  and before she had time to recover her composure, she saw Wilson Moore,  hobbling along on a crutch, holding a bandaged foot off the ground. He  had seen her; he was hurrying to avoid a meeting, or to get behind the  corrals there before she observed him.    \"Wilson!\" she called, involuntarily. The instant the name left her lips  she regretted it. But too late! The cowboy halted, slowly turned.    Then Columbine walked swiftly up to him, suddenly as brave as she had  been fearful. Sight of him had changed her.    \"Wilson Moore, you meant to avoid me,\" she said, with reproach.    \"Howdy, Columbine!\" he drawled, ignoring her words.    \"Oh, I was so sorry you were hurt!\" she burst out. \"And now I'm so  glad--you're--you're ... Wilson, you're thin and pale--you've suffered!\"    \"It pulled me down a bit,\" he replied.    Columbine had never before seen his face anything except bronzed and  lean and healthy, but now it bore testimony to pain and strain and  patient endurance. He looked older. Something in the fine, dark, hazel  eyes hurt her deeply.    \"You never sent me word,\" she went on, reproachfully. \"No one would tell  me anything. The boys said they didn't know. Dad was angry when I asked  him. I'd never have asked Jack. And the freighter who drove up--he lied  to me. So I came down here to-day purposely to ask news of you, but I  never dreamed you were here.... Now I'm glad I came.\"    What a singular, darkly kind, yet strange glance he gave her!    \"That was like you, Columbine,\" he said. \"I knew you'd feel badly about  my accident. But how could I send word to you?\"    \"You saved--Pronto,\" she returned, with a strong tremor in her voice. \"I  can't thank you enough.\"    \"That was a funny thing. Pronto went out of his head. I hope he's all  right.\"    \"He's almost well. It took some time to pick all the splinters out of  him. He'll be all right soon--none the worse for that--that cowboy trick  of Mister Jack Belllounds.\"    Columbine finished bitterly. Moore turned his thoughtful gaze away from  her.    \"I hope Old Bill is well,\" he remarked, lamely.    \"Have you told your folks of your accident?\" asked Columbine, ignoring  his remark.    \"No.\"    \"Oh, Wilson, you ought to have sent for them, or have written at least.\"    \"Me? To go crying for them when I got in trouble? I couldn't see it that  way.\"    \"Wilson, you'll be going--home--soon--to Denver--won't you?\" she  faltered.    \"No,\" he replied, shortly.    \"But what will you do? Surely you can't work--not so soon?\"    \"Columbine, I'll never--be able to ride again--like I used to,\" he said,  tragically. \"I'll ride, yes, but never the old way.\"    \"Oh!\" Columbine's tone, and the exquisite softness and tenderness with  which she placed a hand on the rude crutch would have been enlightening  to any one but these two absorbed in themselves. \"I can't bear to  believe that.\"    \"I'm afraid it's true. Bad smash, Columbine! I just missed being  club-footed.\"    \"You should have care. You should have.... Wilson, do you intend to stay  here with the Andrews?\"    \"Not much. They have troubles of their own. Columbine, I'm going to  homestead one hundred and sixty acres.\"    \"Homestead!\" she exclaimed, in amaze. \"Where?\"    \"Up there under Old White Slides. I've long intended to. You know that  pretty little valley under the red bluff. There's a fine spring. You've  been there with me. There by the old cabin built by prospectors?\"    \"Yes, I know. It's a pretty place--fine valley, but Wils, you can't  _live_ there,\" she expostulated.    \"Why not, I'd like to know?\"    \"That little cubby-hole! It's only a tiny one-room cabin, roof all gone,  chinks open, chimney crumbling.... Wilson, you don't mean to tell me you  want to live there alone?\"    \"Sure. What'd you think?\" he replied, with sarcasm.    \"Expect me to _marry_ some girl? Well, I wouldn't, even if any one would  have a cripple.\"    \"Who--who will take care of you?\" she asked, blushing furiously.    \"I'll take care of myself,\" he declared. \"Good Lord! Columbine, I'm not  an invalid yet. I've got a few friends who'll help me fix up the cabin.  And that reminds me. There's a lot of my stuff up in the bunk-house at  White Slides. I'm going to drive up soon to haul it away.\"    \"Wilson Moore, do you mean it?\" she asked, with grave wonder. \"Are you  going to homestead near White Slides Ranch--and _live_ there--when--\"    She could not finish. An overwhelming disaster, for which she had no  name, seemed to be impending.    \"Yes, I am,\" he replied. \"Funny how things turn out, isn't it?\"    \"It's very--very funny,\" she said, dazedly, and she turned slowly away  without another word.    \"Good-by, Columbine,\" he called out after her, with farewell, indeed, in  his voice.    All the way home Columbine was occupied with feelings that swayed her to  the exclusion of rational consideration of the increasing perplexity of  her situation. And to make matters worse, when she arrived at the ranch  it was to meet Jack Belllounds with a face as black as a thunder-cloud.    \"The old man wants to see you,\" he announced, with an accent that  recalled his threat of a few hours back.    \"Does he?\" queried Columbine, loftily. \"From the courteous way you speak  I imagine it's important.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13941"],[0,"The Divine Right of Church Government (#17)"],[1,"hrist,\" Eph. iv.  11, 12. \"There is one body,\" Eph. iv. 4. \"As we have many members in one  body, and all members have not the same office; so we being many are one  body in Christ, and every one members one of another,\" &c., Rom. xii.  4-9. \"As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of  that one body being many, are one body; so also is Christ,\" (i.e.,  Christ considered mystically, not personally,) \"for by one Spirit are we  all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we  be bond or free,\" &c., 1 Cor. xii. 12, to the end of the chapter, which  context plainly demonstrates all Christ's visible members in the world,  Jews or Gentiles, &c., to be members of one and the same organical body  of Christ, which organical body of Christ is the general visible Church  of Christ; for the invisible church is not organical.    II. That the edification of the Church of Christ is that eminent scope  and end, why Christ gave church government and all other ordinances of  the New Testament to his Church. This is frequently testified in  scripture. 1. The apostle, speaking of this power generally, saith, \"Our  authority which the Lord hath given to us for edification, and not for  the destruction of you,\" 2 Cor. x. 8. The like passage he hath again,  saying, \"according to the authority,\" or power, \"which the Lord hath  given to me for edification, and not for destruction,\" 2 Cor. xiii. 10;  in both which places he speaks of the authority of church government in  a general comprehensive way, declaring the grand and general immediate  end thereof to be, affirmatively, edification of the church; negatively,  not the subversion or destruction thereof. 2. In like manner, when  particular acts of government, and particular ordinances  are mentioned, the edification of the Church, at least in her members,  is propounded as the great end of all: e.g. 1. Admonition is for  edification, that an erring _brother may be gained_, Matt. xviii. 15,  16, that wavering minds may be sound in the faith. \"Rebuke them  cuttingly, that they may be sound in the faith,\" Tit. i. 13, that  beholders and bystanders may fear to fall into like sins. \"Them that sin  rebuke before all, that others also may fear,\" 1 Tim. v. 20. 2.  Excommunication is for edification; particularly of the delinquent  member himself; thus the incestuous person was \"delivered to Satan for  the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit might be saved in the day  of the Lord Jesus,\" 1 Cor. v. 4, 5. \"Hymeneus and Alexander were  delivered to Satan, that they might learn not to blaspheme,\" 1 Tim. i.  20: more generally of the Church; thus the incestuous person was to be  put away from among them lest the whole lump of the church should be  leavened by him, 1 Cor. v. 3. Absolution also is for edification, lest  the penitent party \"should be swallowed up of too much sorrow,\" 2 Cor.  ii. 7. 4. All the officers of his Church are for edification of the  Church, (Eph. iv. 7, 8, 11, 12, 16,) together with all the gifts and  endowments in these officers, whether of prayer, prophecy, tongues, &c.,  all must be managed to edification. This is the scope of the whole  chapter. 1 Cor. xii. 7, &c., and 1 Cor. xiv. 3-5, 9, 12, &c., 26; read  the whole chapter. That passage of Paul is remarkable, \"I thank my God,  I speak with tongues more than you all; yet in the church I had rather  speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach  others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue,\" verses 18,  19. Thus church government, and all sorts of ordinances, with the  particular acts thereof, are to be levelled at this mark of edification.  Edification is an elegant metaphor from material buildings (perhaps of  the material and typical temple) to the spiritual; for explanation's  sake briefly thus take the accommodation: The _architects_, or builders,  are the _ministers_, 1 Cor. iii. 10. The _foundation_ and _corner-stone_  that bears up, binds together, and gives strength to the building, is  Jesus Christ, 1 Cor. iii. 11; 1 Pet. ii. 4, 6. The _stones_ or  _materials_ are the _faithful_ or _saints_, 2 Cor. i. 1. The _building_,  or house itself, is the _Church_, that spiritual house, and _temple of  the living God_, Eph. ii. 21, and iv. 12; 1 Cor. iii. 9, 16, 17. The  edification of this house is gradually to be perfected more and more  till the coming of Christ, by laying the foundation of Christianity, in  bringing men still unto Christ, and carrying on the superstruction in  perfecting them in Christ in all spiritual growth, till at last the  top-stone be laid on, the Church completed, and translated _to the house  not made with hands, eternal in the heavens_.          CHAPTER IX.    _Of the proper receptacle and distinct subject of all this power and  authority of Church Government, which Christ hath peculiarly intrusted  with the execution thereof according to the Scriptures. And_ 1.  _Negatively, That the political magistrate is not the proper subject of  this power._      Thus we have taken a brief survey of church government, both in the  rule, root, kind, branches, and end thereof, all which are comprised in  the former description, and being less controverted, have been more  briefly handled. Now, the last thing in the description which comes  under our consideration, is the proper receptacle of all this power from  Christ, or the peculiar subject intrusted by Christ with this power and  the execution thereof, viz. only Christ's own officers. For church  government is a spiritual power or authority, derived from Jesus Christ  our Mediator, only to his own officers, and by them exercised in  dispensing of the word, &c. Now about this subject of the power will be  the great knot of the controversy, forasmuch as there are many different  claims thereof made, and urged with vehement importunity: (to omit the  Romish claim for the pope, and the prelatical claim for the bishop,) the  politic Erastian pretends that the only proper subject of all church  government is the political or civil magistrate; the gross Brownists or  rigid Separatists, that it is the body of the people, or community of  the faithful in an equal even level; they that are more refined, (who  style themselves for distinction's sake[26] Independents,) that it is  the single congregation, or the company of the faithful with their  presbytery, or church officers; the Presbyterians hold that the proper  subject wherein Christ hath seated and intrusted all church power, and  the exercise thereof, is only his own church officers, (as is in the  description expressed.) Here, therefore, the way will be deeper, and the  travelling slower; the opposition is much, and therefore the  disquisition of this matter will unavoidably be the more.    For perspicuity herein, seeing it is said that this power is derived  from Christ only to his own officers; and by this word (only) all other  subjects are excluded; the subject of church power may be considered,  1. Negatively, what it is not. 2. Affirmatively, what it is.    Negatively, the proper subject unto whom Christ hath committed the power  of church government, and the exercise thereof, is not, 1. The political  magistrate, as the Erastians imagine. 2. Nor the body of the people,  either with their presbytery or without it, as the Separatists and  Independents pretend. Let these negatives first be evinced, and then the  affirmative will be more clearly evidenced.    Touching the first of these--that the political magistrate is not the  proper subject unto whom Jesus Christ our Mediator hath committed the  power of church government, and the exercise of that power; it will be  cleared by declaring these two things distinctly and severally, viz: 1.  What power about ecclesiasticals is granted to the civil magistrate. 2.  What power therein is denied unto him, and why.      SECTION 1.    Such power is granted by the reformed churches and orthodox writers to  the political magistrate, in reference to church affairs. Take it in  these particulars.    A defensive, protecting, patronizing power to the church, and all the  members thereof. \"Kings shall be thy nursing-fathers,\" &c., Isa. xlix.  23. \"The magistrate is the minister of God for good to well-doers, as  well as the avenger, executing wrath upon evil-doers; a terror not to  good works, but to the evil,\" Rom. xiii. 3, 4; he is called _an heir,  or, possessor of restraint, to put men to shame_, Judges xviii. 7. And  as the church ought to pray for kings and all in authority, so  consequently all in authority should endeavor to defend it, that the  church and people of God should lead a quiet and peaceable life, (under  the wing of their protection,) \"in all godliness and honesty,\" 1 Tim.  ii. 2; and this is evident from the end and scope of these prayers here  prescribed, as interpreters unanimously agree. And hereupon are those  promises to the church, \"The sons of strangers shall build up thy walls,  and their kings shall minister unto thee,\" Isa. lx. 10; \"and thou shalt  suck the breast of kings,\" Isa. lx. 16. Now, this nursing, protecting  care of magistrates towards the church, puts forth itself in these or  like acts, viz: He,    1. Removes all external impediments of true religion, worship of God,  &c., by his civil power, whether persons or things, whether  persecutions, profaneness, heresy, idolatry, superstition, &c., that  truth and godliness may purely flourish: as did Jehoshaphat, Asa,  Hezekiah, Josiah. And hereupon it is that God so oft condemns the not  removing and demolishing of the high places and monuments of idolatry,  1 Kings xv. 14, with 2 Chron. xv. 17; 1 Kings xxii. 44; 2 Kings xii. 3:  and highly commends the contrary in Asa, 2 Chron. xv. 8, 16: in  Jehoshaphat, 2 Chron. xvii. 3, 4, 6-10: in Hezekiah, 2 Chron. xxxi. 1; 2  Kings xviii. 4: in Manasseh, 2 Chron. xxxiii. 15: in Josiah, 2 Kings  xxiii. 8, 13, 19, 20, 24: whereupon the Holy Ghost"]]]
