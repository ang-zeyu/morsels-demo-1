But the best authorities, Eastern and  Western, hold to the \"single idea\" theory as being correct. On this point  we may quote a few authorities.    _Jouffroy_ says that \"It is established by experience that we cannot give  our attention to two different objects at the same time.\" And _Holland_  states that \"Two thoughts, however closely related to one another,  cannot be presumed to exist at the same time.\" And _Lewes_ has told us  that \"The nature of our organism prevents our having more than one aspect  of an object at each instant presented to consciousness.\" _Whateley_  says: \"The best philosophers are agreed that the mind cannot actually  attend to more than one thing at a time, but, when it appears to be doing  so it is really shifting with prodigious rapidity backward and forward  from one to the other.\"    By giving a concentrated Voluntary Attention to an object, we not only  are able to see and think about it with the greatest possible degree of  clearness, but the mind has a tendency, under such circumstances, to  bring into the field of consciousness all the different ideas associated  in our memory with that object or subject, and to build around the object  or subject a mass of associated facts and information. And at the same  time the Attention given the subject makes more vivid and clear all that  we learn about the thing at the time, and, in fact, all that we may  afterwards learn about it. It seems to cut a channel, through which  knowledge flows.    Attention magnifies and increases the powers of perception, and greatly  aids the exercise of the perceptive faculties. By \"paying attention\" to  something seen or heard, one is enabled to observe the details of the  thing seen or heard, and where the inattentive mind acquires say three  impressions the attentive mind absorbs three times three, or perhaps  three times \"three times three,\" or twenty-seven. And, as we have just  said, Attention brings into play the powers of association, and gives us  the \"loose end\" of an almost infinite chain of associated facts, stored  away in our memory, forming new combinations of facts which we had never  grouped together before, and bring out into the field of consciousness  all the many scraps of information regarding the thing to which we are  giving attention. The proof of this is within the experience of everyone.  Where is the one who does not remember sitting down to some writing,  painting, reading, etc., with interest and attention, and finding, much  to his surprise, what a flow of facts regarding the matter in hand was  passing through his mind. Attention seems to focus all the knowledge of a  thing that you possess, and by bringing it to a point enables you to  combine, associate, classify, etc., and thus create new knowledge.  _Gibbon_ tells us that after he gave a brief glance and consideration to  a new subject, he suspended further work upon it, and allowed his mind  (under concentrated attention) to bring forth all his associated  knowledge regarding the subject, after which he renewed the task with  increased power and efficiency.    The more one's attention is fixed upon a subject under consideration, the  deeper is the impression which the subject leaves upon the mind. And the  easier will it be for him to afterwards pursue the same train of thought  and work.    Attention is a prerequisite of good memory, and in fact there can be no  memory at all unless some degree of attention is given. The degree of  memory depends upon the degree of attention and interest. And when it is  considered that the work of today is made efficient by the memory of  things learned yesterday, the day before yesterday, and so on, it is seen  that the degree of attention given today regulates the quality of the  work of tomorrow.    Some authorities have described Genius as the result of great powers of  attention, or, at least, that the two seem to run together. Some writer  has said that \"possibly the best definition of genius is the power of  concentrating upon some one given subject until its possibilities are  exhausted and absorbed.\" _Simpson_ has said that \"The power and habit of  thinking closely and continuously upon the subject at hand, to the  exclusion, for the time, of all other subjects, is one of the principal,  if, indeed, not the principal, means of success.\" _Sir Isaac Newton_ has  told us his plan of absorbing information and knowledge. He has stated  that he would keep the subject under consideration before him  continually, and then would wait till the first dawning of perception  gradually brightened into a clear light, little by little. A mental  sunrise, in fact.    That sage observer, _Dr. Abercrombie_, has written that he considered  that he knew of no more important rule for rising to eminence in any  profession or occupation than the Ability to do one thing at a time,  avoiding all distracting and diverting objects or subjects, and keeping  the leading matter continually before the mind. And others have added  that such a course will enable one to observe relations between the  subject and other things that will not be apparent to the careless  observer or student.    The degree of Attention cultivated by a man is the degree of his capacity  for intellectual work. As we have said, the \"great\" men of all walks of  life have developed this faculty to a wonderful degree, and many of them  seem to get results \"intuitively,\" whereas, in truth, they obtain them by  reason of their concentrated power of Attention, which enables them to  see right into the center of a subject or proposition--and all around it,  back and front, and all sides, in a space of time incredible to the man  who has not cultivated this mighty power. Men who have devoted much  attention to some special line of work or research, are able to act  almost as if they possessed \"second sight,\" providing the subject is  within their favorite field of endeavor. Attention quickens every one of  the faculties--the reasoning faculties--the senses--the deriding  qualities--the analytical faculties, and so on, each being given a \"fine  edge\" by their use under a concentrated Attention.    And, on the other hand, there is no surer indication of a weak mind than  the deficiency in Attention. This weakness may arise from illness or  physical weakness reacting upon the brain, in which case the trouble is  but temporary. Or it may arise from a lack of mental development.  Imbeciles and idiots have little or no Attention. The great French  psychologist, _Luys_, speaking of this fact, says \"Imbeciles and idiots  see badly, hear badly, feel badly, and their sensorium is, in  consequence, in a similar condition of sensitive poverty. Its  impressionability for the things of the external world is at a minimum,  its sensibility weak, and consequently, it is difficult to provoke the  physiological condition necessary for the absorption of the external  impression.\"    In old age the Attention is the first faculty to show signs of decay.  Some authorities have held that the Memory was the first faculty to be  affected by the approach of old age, but this is incorrect, for it is a  matter of common experience that the aged manifest a wonderfully clear  memory of events occurring in the far past. The reason that their memory  of recent events is so poor is because their failing powers of Attention  has prevented them from receiving strong, clear mental impressions, and  as is the impression so is the memory. Their early impressions having  been clear and strong, are easily recalled, while their later ones,  being weak, are recalled with difficulty. If the Memory were at fault, it  would be difficult for them to recall any impression, recent or far  distant in time.    But we must stop quoting examples and authorities, and urging upon you  the importance of the faculty of Attention. If you do not now realize it,  it is because you have not given the subject the Attention that you  should have exercised, and further repetition would not remedy matters.    Admitting the importance of Attention, from the psychological point  of view, not to speak of the occult side of the subject, is it not a  matter of importance for you to start in to cultivate that faculty? We  think so. And the only way to cultivate any mental or physical part or  faculty is to Exercise it. Exercise \"uses up\" a muscle, or mental  faculty, but the organism makes haste to rush to the scene additional  material--cell-stuff, nerve force, etc., to repair the waste, and it  always sends a little more than is needed. And this \"little more,\"  continually accruing and increasing, is what increases the muscles and  brain centers. And improved and strengthened brain centers give the mind  better instruments with which to work.    One of the first things to do in the cultivation of Attention is to learn  to think of, and do, one thing at a time. Acquiring the \"knack\" or habit  of attending closely to the things before us, and then passing on to the  next and treating it in the same way, is most conducive to success, and  its practice is the best exercise for the cultivation of the faculty of  Attention. And on the contrary, there is nothing more harmful from the  point of view of successful performance--and nothing that will do more to  destroy the power of giving Attention--than the habit of trying to do one  thing while thinking of another. The thinking part of the mind, and the  acting part should work together, not in opposition.    _Dr. Beattie_, speaking of this subject, tells us \"It is a matter of no  small importance"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1366"],[0,"The Cloister and the Hearth (#17)"],[1,"his body necessarily fell about a yard. A stifled cry came up  from below. Gerard hung in mid-air. He clenched his teeth, and nipped  the rope tight with his feet and gripped it with his hands, and went  down slowly hand below hand. He passed by one huge rough stone after  another. He saw there was green moss on one. He looked up and he looked  down. The moon shone into his prison window: it seemed very near. The  fluttering figures below seemed an awful distance. It made him dizzy to  look down: so he fixed his eyes steadily on the wall close to him, and  went slowly down, down, down.    He passed a rusty, slimy streak on the wall: it was some ten feet long.  The rope made his hands very hot. He stole another look up.    The prison window was a good way off now.    Down--down--down--down.    The rope made his hands sore.    He looked up. The window was so distant, he ventured now to turn his  eyes downward again; and there, not more than thirty feet below him,  were Margaret and Martin, their faithful hands upstretched to catch him  should he fall. He could see their eyes and their teeth shine in the  moonlight. For their mouths were open, and they were breathing hard.    \"Take care, Gerard oh, take care! Look not down.\"    \"Fear me not,\" cried Gerard joyfully, and eyed the wall, but came down  faster.    In another minute his feet were at their hands. They seized him ere he  touched the ground, and all three clung together in one embrace.    \"Hush! away in silence, dear one.\"    They stole along the shadow of the wall.    Now, ere they had gone many yards, suddenly a stream of light shot from  an angle of the building, and lay across their path like a barrier of  fire, and they heard whispers and footsteps close at hand.    \"Back!\" hissed Martin. \"Keep in the shade.\"    They hurried back, passed the dangling rope, and made for a little  square projecting tower. They had barely rounded it when the light shot  trembling past them, and flickered uncertainly into the distance.    \"A lantern!\" groaned Martin in a whisper. \"They are after us.\"    \"Give me my knife,\" whispered Gerard. \"I'll never be taken alive.\"    \"No, no!\" murmured Margaret; \"is there no way out where we are?\"    \"None! none! But I carry six lives at my shoulder;\" and with the word,  Martin strung his bow, and fitted an arrow to the string: \"in war never  wait to be struck: I will kill one or two ere they shall know where  their death comes from:\" then, motioning his companions to be quiet he  began to draw his bow, and, ere the arrow was quite drawn to the head,  he glided round the corner ready to loose the string the moment the  enemy should offer a mark.    Gerard and Margaret held their breath in horrible expectation: they had  never seen a human being killed.    And now a wild hope, but half repressed, thrilled through Gerard, that  this watchful enemy might be the burgomaster in person. The soldier, he  knew, would send an arrow through a burgher or burgomaster, as he would  through a boar in a wood.    But who may foretell the future, however near? The bow, instead of  remaining firm, and loosing the deadly shaft, was seen to waver first,  then shake violently, and the stout soldier staggered back to them, his  knees knocking and his cheeks blanched with fear. He let his arrow fall,  and clutched Gerard's shoulder.    \"Let me feel flesh and blood,\" he gasped. \"The haunted tower! the  haunted tower!\"    His terror communicated itself to Margaret and Gerard. They gasped  rather than uttered an inquiry.    \"Hush!\" he cried, \"it will hear you up the wall! it is going up the  wall! Its head is on fire. Up the wall, as mortal creatures walk upon  green sward. If you know a prayer, say it, for hell is loose to-night.\"    \"I have power to exorcise spirits,\" said Gerard, trembling. \"I will  venture forth.\"    \"Go alone then,\" said Martin; \"I have looked on't once, and live.\"        CHAPTER XI    The strange glance of hatred the burgomaster had cast on Gerard, coupled  with his imprisonment, had filled the young man with a persuasion that  Ghysbrecht was his enemy to the death, and he glided round the angle of  the tower, fully expecting to see no supernatural appearance, but some  cruel and treacherous contrivance of a bad man to do him a mischief in  that prison, his escape from which could hardly be known.    As he stole forth, a soft but brave hand crept into his; and Margaret  was by his side, to share this new peril.    No sooner was the haunted tower visible, than a sight struck their eyes  that benumbed them as they stood. More than halfway up the tower, a  creature with a fiery head, like an enormous glowworm, was steadily  mounting the wall: the body was dark, but its outline visible through  the glare from the head, and the whole creature not much less than four  feet long.    At the foot of the tower stood a thing in white, that looked exactly  like the figure of a female. Gerard and Margaret palpitated with awe.    \"The rope! the rope! It is going up the rope,\" gasped Gerard.    As they gazed, the glowworm disappeared in Gerard's late prison, but  its light illuminated the cell inside and reddened the window. The white  figure stood motionless below.    Such as can retain their senses after the first prostrating effect of  the supernatural are apt to experience terror in one of its strangest  forms, a wild desire to fling themselves upon the terrible object. It  fascinates them as the snake the bird. The great tragedian Macready  used to render this finely in Macbeth, at Banquo's second appearance.  He flung himself with averted head at the horrible shadow. This strange  impulse now seized Margaret. She put down Gerard's hand quietly, and  stood bewildered; then, all in a moment, with a wild cry, darted towards  the spectre. Gerard, not aware of the natural impulse I have spoken of,  never doubted the evil one was drawing her to her perdition. He fell on  his knees.    \"Exorcizo vos. In nomine beatae Mariae, exorcizo vos.\"    While the exorcist was shrieking his incantations in extremity of  terror, to his infinite relief he heard the spectre utter a feeble  cry of fear. To find that hell had also its little weaknesses was  encouraging. He redoubled his exorcisms, and presently he saw the  ghastly shape kneeling at Margaret's knees, and heard it praying  piteously for mercy.      Kate and Giles soon reached the haunted tower. Judge their surprise when  they found a new rope dangling from the prisoner's window to the ground.    \"I see how it is,\" said the inferior intelligence, taking facts as they  came. \"Our Gerard has come down this rope. He has got clear. Up I go,  and see.\"    \"No, Giles, no!\" said the superior intelligence, blinded by prejudice.  \"See you not this is glamour? This rope is a line the evil one casts out  to wile thee to destruction. He knows the weaknesses of all our hearts;  he has seen how fond you are of going up things. Where should our Gerard  procure a rope? how fasten it in the sky like this? It is not in nature.  Holy saints protect us this night, for hell is abroad.\"    \"Stuff!\" said the dwarf; \"the way to hell is down, and this rope leads  up. I never had the luck to go up such a long rope. It may be years ere  I fall in with such a long rope all ready for me. As well be knocked on  the head at once as never know happiness.\"    And he sprung on to the rope with a cry of delight, as a cat jumps with  a mew on to a table where fish is. All the gymnast was on fire; and the  only concession Kate could gain from him was permission to fasten the  lantern on his neck first.    \"A light scares the ill spirits,\" said she.    And so, with his huge arms, and his legs like feathers, Giles went up  the rope faster than his brother came down it. The light at the nape of  his neck made a glowworm of him. His sister watched his progress, with  trembling anxiety. Suddenly a female figure started out of the solid  masonry, and came flying at her with more than mortal velocity.    Kate uttered a feeble cry. It was all she could, for her tongue clove to  her palate with terror. Then she dropped her crutches, and sank upon her  knees, hiding her face and moaning:    \"Take my body, but spare my soul!\"    Margaret (panting). \"Why, it is a woman!\"    Kate (quivering). \"Why, it is a woman!\"    Margaret. \"How you scared me!\"    Kate. \"I am scared enough myself. Oh! oh! oh!\"    \"This is strange! But the fiery-headed thing? Yet it was with you, and  you are harmless! But why are you here at this time of night?\"    \"Nay, why are YOU?\"    \"Perhaps we are on the same errand? Ah! you are his good sister, Kate!\"    \"And you are Margaret Brandt.\"    \"Yes.    \"All the better. You love him; you are here. Then Giles was right. He  has won free.\"    Gerard came forward, and put the question at rest. But all further  explanation was cut short by a horrible unearthly noise, like a  sepulchre ventriloquizing:    \"PARCHMENT!--PARCHMENT!--PARCHMENT!\"    At each repetition, it rose in intensity. They looked up, and there was  the dwarf, with his hands full of parchments, and his face lighted with  fiendish joy and lurid with diabolical fire. The light being at his  neck, a more infernal \"transparency\" never startled mortal eye. With the  word, the awful imp hurled parchment at the astonished heads below.  Down came records, like wounded wild-ducks; some collapsed, others  fluttering, and others spread out and wheeling slowly down in airy  circles. They had hardly settled, when again the sepulchral roar was  heard--\"Parchment--parchment!\" and down pattered and sailed another  flock of documents: another followed: they whitened the grass. Finally,  the fire-headed imp, with his light body and horny hands, slid down the  rope like a falling star, and (business before sentiment) proposed to  his rescued brother an immediate settlement for the merchandise he had  just delivered.    \"Hush!\" said Gerard; \"you speak too loud. Gather them up, and"]]]
