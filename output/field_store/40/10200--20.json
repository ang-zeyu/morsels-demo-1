Each hour, as it passes, is  struck by the man on duty with a hammer on a broad plate of bell-metal,  suspended to the branch of a tree, or to a rail;--the gong of an English  showman at the country fairs is the exact resemblance of the metal plates  used in India for striking the hours on, and must, I think, have been  introduced into England from the East.    The durwaun (gate-keeper), or the chokeedhars (watchmen), keep the time.[3]  In most establishments the watchmen are on guard two at a time, and are  relieved at every watch, day and night. On these men devolves the care of  observing the advance of time by the floating vessel, and striking the  hour, in which duty they are required to be punctual, as many of the  Mussulmauns' services of prayer are scrupulously performed at the  appointed hours, which will be more particularly explained when their  creed is brought forward in a future Letter; and now, after this  digression, I will pursue my subject.    When a member of the Mussulmaun family dies, the master of the house  mourns forty days, during which period the razor is laid aside.[4] In the  same manner the devout Mussulmaun mourns every year for his martyred  Emaums; this, however, is confined to the most religious men; the general  practice of the many is to throw off their mourning garb and restore the  razor to its duties on the third day after the observances of Mahurrum  have terminated.    It is stated, on the authority of ancient Arabian writers, on whose  veracity all Mussulmauns rely, that the head of Hosein being taken to  Yuzeed, one of his many wives solicited and received the head, which she  gave to the family of the martyred leader, who were prisoners to the King,  and that they contrived to have it conveyed to Kraabaallah, where it was  deposited in the same grave with his body on the fortieth day after the  battle.[5]    When a death occurs in a Mussulmaun family, the survivor provides dinners  on the third, seventh, and fortieth days succeeding, in memory of the  deceased person; these dinners are sent in trays to the immediate  relatives and friends of the party,--on which sacred occasion all the poor  and the beggars are sought to share the rich food provided. The like  customs are observed for Hosein every year. The third day offering is  chiefly composed of sugar, ghee, and flour, and called meetah[6]; it is of  the consistence of our rice-puddings, and whether the dainty is sent to a  king or a beggar there is but one style in the presentation--all is served  in the common brown earthen dish,--in imitation of the humility of Hosein  and his family, who seldom used any other in their domestic circle. The  dishes of meetah are accompanied with the many varieties of bread common  to Hindoostaun, without leaven, as sheah-maul,[7] bacherkaunie,[8]  chapaatie,[9] &c.; the first two have milk and ghee mixed with the flour,  and nearly resemble our pie-crust. I must here stay to remark one custom I  have observed amongst Natives: they never cook food whilst a dead body  remains in the house;[10] as soon as it is known amongst a circle of  friends that a person is dead, ready-dressed dinners are forwarded to the  house for them, no one fancying he is conferring a kindness, but  fulfilling a duty.    The third day after the accomplishment of the Mahurrum ceremonies is a  busy time with the inmates of zeenahnahs, when generally the mourning garb  is thrown off, and preparations commence at an early hour in the morning  for bathing and replacing the banished ornaments. Abstinence and privation  being no longer deemed meritorious by the Mussulmauns, the pawn--the dear  delightful pawn, which constitutes the greatest possible luxury to the  Natives,--pours in from the bazaar, to gladden the eye and rejoice the  heart of all classes, who after this temporary self-denial enjoy the  luxury with increased zest.    Again the missee[11] (a preparation of antimony) is applied to the lips,  the gums, and occasionally to the teeth of every married lady, who emulate  each other in the rich black produced;--such is the difference of taste as  regards beauty;--where we admire the coral hue, with the females of  Hindoostaun, Nature is defaced by the application of black dye. The eyelid  also is pencilled afresh with prepared black, called kaarjil[12]: the  chief ingredient in this preparation is lampblack. The eyebrow is well  examined for fear an ill-shaped hair should impair the symmetry of that  arch esteemed a beauty in every clime, though all do not, perhaps,  exercise an equal care with Eastern dames to preserve order in its growth.  The mayndhie is again applied to the hands and feet, which restores the  bright red hue deemed so becoming and healthy.    The nose once more is destined to receive the nutt[13] (ring) which  designates the married lady; this ring, I have before mentioned, is of  gold wire, the pearls and ruby between them are of great value, and I have  seen many ladies wear the nutt as large in circumference as the bangle on  her wrist, though of course much lighter; it is often worn so large, that  at meals they are obliged to hold it apart from the face with the left  hand, whilst conveying food to the mouth with the other. This nutt,  however, from ancient custom, is indispensable with married women, and  though they may find it disagreeable and inconvenient, it cannot possibly  be removed, except for Mahurrum, from the day of their marriage until  their death or widowhood, without infringing on the originality of their  customs, in adhering to which they take so much pride.    The ears of the females are pierced in many places; the gold or silver  rings return to their several stations after Mahurrum, forming a broad  fringe of the precious metals on each side the head; but when they dress  for great events,--as paying visits or receiving company,--these give  place to strings of pearls and emeralds, which fall in rows from the upper  part of the ear to the shoulder in a graceful, elegant style. My ayah, a  very plain old woman, has no less than ten silver rings in one ear and  nine in the other,[15] each of them having pendant ornaments; indeed, her  ears are literally fringed with silver.    After the hair has undergone all the ceremonies of washing, drying, and  anointing with the sweet jessamine oil of India, it is drawn with great  precision from the forehead to the back, where it is twisted into a queue  which generally reaches below the waist; the ends are finished with strips  of red silk and silver ribands entwined with the hair, and terminating  with a good-sized rosette. The hair is jet black, without a single  variation of tinge, and luxuriantly long and thick, and thus dressed  remains for the week,--about the usual interval between their laborious  process of bathing;--nor can they conceive the comfort other people find  in frequent brushing and combing the hair. Brushes for the head and the  teeth have not yet been introduced into Native families, nor is it ever  likely they will, unless some other material than pigs' bristles can be  rendered available by the manufacturers for the present purposes of  brushes. The swine is altogether considered abominable to Mussulmauns; and  such is their detestation of the unclean animal that the most angry  epithet from a master to a slave would be to call him 'seur'[15] (swine).    It must not, however, be supposed that the Natives neglect their teeth;  they are the most particular people living in this respect, as they never  eat or drink without washing their mouths before and after meals; and as a  substitute for our tooth-brush, they make a new one every day from the  tender branch of a tree or shrub,--as the pomegranate, the neem,[16]  babool,[17] &c. The fresh-broken twig is bruised and made pliant at the  extremity, after the bark or rind is stripped from it, and with this the  men preserve the enamelled-looking white teeth which excite the admiration  of strangers; and which, though often envied, I fancy, are never surpassed  by European ingenuity.    As I have rather prematurely introduced the Native ladies' style of dress  into this Letter, I may as well conclude the whole business of their  toilet under the present head, instead of reserving the detail of the  subject for a future Letter when the zeenahnah is to be described, and  accordingly proceed to tell you that the ladies' pyjaamahs are formed of  rich satin, or gold cloth, goolbudden,[18] or mussheroo[19] (striped  washing silks manufactured at Benares), fine chintz,--English manufacture  having the preference,--silk or cotton ginghams,--in short, all such  materials are used for this article of female dress as are of sufficiently  firm texture, down to the white calico of the country, suited to the means  of the wearer. By the most fashionable females they are worn very full  below the knee, and reach to the feet, which are partially covered by the  fulness, the extremity finished and the seams are bound with silver riband;  a very broad silver riband binds the top of the pyjaamah; this being  double has a zarbund[20] (a silk net cord) run through, by which this part  of the dress is confined at the waist. The ends of the zarbund are  finished with rich tassels of gold and silver, curiously and expressly  made for this purpose, which extend below the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13166"],[0,"The Psalms of David (#17)"],[1,"design.    5 Thus shall the wondering nations see  The Lord is good and just;  And distant islands fly to thee,  And make thy Name their trust.    6 They dread thy glittering tokens, Lord,  When signs in heaven appear;  But they shall learn thy holy word,  And love as well as fear.      Psalm 65:4. Second Part. C. M.  The providence of God in air, earth,  and sea; or, The blessing of rain.    1 'Tis by thy strength the mountains stand,  God of eternal power;  The sea grows calm at thy command,  And tempests cease to roar.    2 Thy morning light and evening shade  Successive comforts bring;  Thy plenteous fruits make harvest glad,  Thy flowers adorn the spring.    3 Seasons and times, and moons and hours,  Heaven, earth, and air are thine;  When clouds distil in fruitful showers,  The author is divine.    4 Those wandering cisterns in the sky,  Borne by the winds around,  With watery treasures well supply  The furrows of the ground.    5 The thirsty ridges drink their fill,  And ranks of corn appear;  Thy ways abound with blessings still,  Thy goodness crowns the year.      Psalm 65:5. Third Part. C. M.  The blessing: of the spring; or, God gives  rain. A psalm for the husbandman.    1 Good is the Lord, the heavenly King,  Who makes the earth his care,  Visits the pastures every spring,  And bids the grass appear.    2 The clouds, like rivers rais'd on high,  Pour out, at thy command,  Their watery blessings from the sky,  To cheer the thirsty land.    3 The soften'd ridges of the field  Permit the corn to spring;  The vallies rich provision yield,  And the poor labourers sing.    4 The little hills on every side  Rejoice at falling showers;  The meadows, drest in all their pride,  Perfume the air with flowers.    5 The barren clods, refresh'd with rain,  Promise a joyful crop;  The parching grounds look green again,  And raise the reaper's hope.    6 The various months thy goodness crowns;  How bounteous are thy ways;  The bleating flocks spread o'er the downs,  And shepherds shout thy praise.      Psalm 66:1. First Part.  Governing power and goodness;  or, Our graces tried by afflictions.    1 Sing, all ye nations, to the Lord,  Sing with a joyful noise;  With melody of sound record  His honours, and your joys.    2 Say to the power that shakes the sky,  \"How terrible art thou!  \"Sinners before thy presence fly,  \"Or at thy feet they bow.\"    3 [Come, see the wonders of our God,  How glorious are his ways:  In Moses' hand he puts his rod,  And cleaves the frighted seas.    4 He made the ebbing channel dry,  While Israel pass'd the flood;  There did the church begin their joy,  And triumph in their God.]    5 He rules by his resistless might:  Will rebel mortals dare  Provoke th' Eternal to the fight,  And tempt that dreadful war?    6 O bless our God and never cease;  Ye saints, fulfil his praise;  He keeps our life, maintains our peace,  And guides our doubtful ways.    7 Lord, thou hast prov'd our suffering souls,  To make our graces shine;  So silver bears the burning coals  The metal to refine.    8 Thro' watery deeps and fiery ways  We march at thy command,  Led to possess the promis'd place  By thine unerring hand.      Psalm 66:2. 13-20. Second Part.  Praise to God for hearing prayer.    1 Now shall my solemn vows be paid  To that Almighty power,  That heard the long requests I made  In my distressful hour.    2 My lips and cheerful heart prepare  To make his mercies known;  Come, ye that fear my God, and hear  The wonders he has done.    3 When on my head huge sorrows fell,  I sought his heavenly aid,  He sav'd my sinking soul from hell,  And death's eternal shade.    4 If sin lay cover'd in my heart,  While prayer employ'd my tongue,  The Lord had shewn me no regard,  Nor I his praises sung.      5 But God, (his Name be ever blest)  Hath set my spirit free,  Nor turn'd from him my poor request,  Nor turn'd his heart from me.      Psalm 67.  The nation's prosperity and the church's increase.    1 Shine, mighty God, on Britain shine  With beams of heavenly grace;  Reveal thy power thro' all our coasts,  And shew thy smiling face.    2 [Amidst our isle, exalted high,  Do thou our glory stand,  And like a wall of guardian fire  Surround the favourite land.]    3 When shall thy Name, from shore to shore,  Sound all the earth abroad,  And distant nations know and love  Their Saviour and their God?    4 Sing to the Lord, ye distant lands,  Sing loud with solemn voice;  While British tongues exalt his praise,  And British hearts rejoice.    5 He the great Lord, the sovereign Judge,  That sits enthron'd above,  Wisely commands the worlds he made  In justice and in love.    6 Earth shall obey her Maker's will,  And yield a full increase;  Our God will crown his chosen isle  With fruitfulness and peace.    7 God the Redeemer scatters round  His choicest favours here,  While the creation's utmost bound  Shall see, adore, and fear.      Psalm 68:1. 1-6 32-35. First Part.  The vengeance and compassion of God.    1 Let God arise in all his might,  And put the troops of hell to flight,  As smoke that sought to cloud the skies  Before the rising tempest flies.    2 [He comes array'd in burning flames;  Justice and vengeance are his names:  Behold his fainting foes expire  Like melting wax before the fire.]    3 He rides and thunders thro' the sky;  His name Jehovah sounds on high:  Sing to his Name, ye sons of grace;  Ye saints, rejoice before his face.    4 The widow and the fatherless  Fly to his aid in sharp distress;  In him the poor and helpless find  A Judge that's just, a Father kind.    5 He breaks the captive's heavy chain,  And prisoners see the light again;  But rebels that dispute his will,  Shall dwell in chains and darkness still.    PAUSE.    6 Kingdoms and thrones to God belong;  Crown him, ye nations, in your song;  His wondrous names and powers rehearse;  His honours shall enrich your verse.    7 He shakes the heavens with loud alarms;  How terrible is God in arms!  In Israel are his mercies known,  Israel is his peculiar throne.    8 Proclaim him King, pronounce him blest!  He's your defence, your joy, your rest:  When terrors rise and nations faint,  God is the strength of every saint.      Psalm 68:2. 17 18. Second Part.  Christ's ascension, and the gift of the Spirit.    1 Lord, when thou didst ascend on high,  Ten thousand angels fill'd the sky;  Those heavenly guards around thee wait,  Like chariots that attend thy state.    2 Not Sinai's mountain could appear  More glorious when the Lord was there;  While he pronounc'd his dreadful law,  And struck the chosen tribes with awe.    3 How bright the triumph none can tell,  When the rebellious powers of hell  That thousand souls had captive made,  Were all in chains like captives led.    4 Rais'd by his Father to the throne,  He sent the promis'd Spirit down,  With gifts and grace for rebel men,  That God might dwell on earth again.      Psalm 68:3. 19 9 20-2. Third Part.  Praise for temporal blessings; or,  Common and special mercies.    1 We bless the Lord, the just, the good,  Who fills our hearts with joy and food;  Who pours his blessings from the skies,  And loads our days with rich supplies.    2 He sends the sun his circuit round,  To cheer the fruits, to warm the ground;  He bids the clouds with plenteous rain  Refresh the thirsty earth again.    3 'Tis to his care we owe our breath,  And all our near escapes from death;  Safety and health to God belong;  He heals the weak, and guards the strong.    4 He makes the saint and sinner prove  The common blessings of his love;  But the wide difference that remains,  Is endless joy, or endless pains.    5 The Lord, that bruis'd the serpent's head,  On all the serpent's seed shall tread;  The stubborn sinner's hope confound,  And smite him with a lasting wound.    6 But his right hand his saints shall raise  From the deep earth, or deeper seas,  And bring them to his courts above,  There shall they taste his special love.      Psalm 69:1. 1-14. First Part. C. M.  The sufferings of Christ for our salvation.    1 \"Save me, O God, the swelling floods  \"Break in upon my soul:  \"I sink, and sorrows o'er my head  \"Like mighty waters roll.    2 \"I cry till all my voice be gone,  \"In tears I waste the day:  \"My God behold my longing eyes,  \"And shorten thy delay.    3 \"They hate my soul without a cause,  \"And still their number grows  \"More than the hairs around my head,  \"And mighty are my foes.    4 \"'Twas then I paid that dreadful debt  \"That men could never pay,  \"And gave those honours to thy law  \"Which sinners took away.\"    5 Thus in the great Messiah's name,  The royal prophet mourns;  Thus he awakes our hearts to grief,  And gives us joy by turns.    6 \"Now shall the saints rejoice and find  \"Salvation in my Name:  \"For I have borne their heavy load  Of sorrow, pain, and shame.      7 \"Grief, like a garment, cloth'd me round,  \"And sackcloth was my dress,  \"While I procur'd for naked souls  \"A robe of righteousness.    8 \"Amongst my brethren and the Jews  \"I like a stranger stood,  \"And bore their vile reproach to bring  \"The Gentiles near to God.    9 \"I came in sinful mortals' stead,  \"To do my Father's will;  \"Yet when I cleans'd my father's house  \"They scandaliz'd my zeal.    10 \"My fasting and my holy groans  \"Were made the drunkard's song;  \"But God, from his celestial throne,  \"Heard my complaining tongue.    11 \"He sav'd me from the dreadful deep,  \"Nor let my soul be drown'd;  \"He rais'd and fix'd my sinking feet  \"On well establish'd ground.    12 \"'Twas in a most accepted hour  \"My prayer arose on high,  \"And for my sake my God shall hear  \"The dying sinner's cry.\"      Psalm 69:2. 14-21 26 29 32. 2d Part. C. M.  The passion and exaltation of Christ.    1 Now let our lips with holy fear  And mournful pleasure sing  The sufferings of our great High-Priest,  The sorrows of our King.    2 He sinks in floods of deep distress:  How high the waters rise!
