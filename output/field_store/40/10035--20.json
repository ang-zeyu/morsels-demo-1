Several, suffering from extreme thirst, had become crazed,  slashing and biting throats, arms and legs to 'suck' the blood. Some  men actually had to fight off their neighbors with a shoe or a club to  keep from getting murdered. Several frenzied prisoners tried to climb  the ladders and were immediately shot by the guards. Perhaps this was  a blessed relief from their tormentors.\"    Our representative also told us, \"We are in a convoy of some seven  ships, a cruiser, destroyers and transports, loaded with troops  (probably sick and wounded). We were moving north along the Zambales  coast at about twenty knots.\"    About 0900 hours I heard planes; many of them; soon there were loud  blasts from the anti-aircraft guns on the deck above. The planes began  to dive. Faster and faster they whined. Then tremendous explosions!  They were attacking the other ships; they could knock us off at their  leisure.    Then bullets and shrapnel slashed and rattled through our hold- as  several food carriers were coming down the ladder with buckets of  rice.    One of these was my good friend, Chaplain Ed Nagel, a former  missionary in Baguio, shot through the thigh. With blood streaming  down his leg, he continued down the ladder carrying a bucket of rice.    \"U.S. Navy planes!\" he shouted.    There was no doubt now; our ship was the target, and we were sitting  on the bull's eye.    Motors continued to accelerate-then terrific concussions; the ship  quivered and was actually bouncing in the water. The air was full of  bomb dust and chips of rust; it was becoming difficult to breathe. We  tried to move toward the side of the hold and huddled close together.  My heart was pounding like a trip hammer in my parched throat; my ears  were ringing and my eyes were popping. I completely forgot how hungry  I was. Each prisoner was conversing with his God. I had quick visions  of my family they'll never know what happened to me. There'll be    no survivors to tell them. Will it ever stop?\"    Many men were bleeding badly! There was much confusion, much moving  around. Everyone was trying to get in a safer place, to get bandages,  to apply pressure to wounds it was hopeless; everything was covered  with dirt and dust.    The planes were diving again, spraying their deadly missiles. (I have  neither the will nor the talent to describe the gory details.) \"Would  this be the explosion that would blot out our existence?\" Then it was  over! Complete silence!    Stunned, we moved into the center of the hold to get better air to  breathe and to thank God for surviving. We bandaged the wounded and  moved them into positions of relative safety.    But our quiet didn't last long! More planes! More anti-aircraft  blasts! More explosions! More concussions! More dust and dirt!    As a doctor, I had seen many people die during the previous sixteen  years. I knew that nature was usually kind to dying persons, supplying  stupor and coma to ease any pain. But I wasn't ready to die-I wasn't  even forty, when life is supposed to begin. We had buckets of rice,  covered with dirt and rust chips, but no one could eat.    Fifteen more times that day planes returned to attack our ship. Five  times the gun crews on the deck were annihilated and replaced with  fresh crews. There had been no lack of bravery on the deck. Officers  continued to wave their sabers at the pilots. During the last bombing,  fragments of rock flew into the hold; our ship had been beached on the  Zambales coast to prevent its sinking.    As the sun went down, we could feel the ship backing off the shore. By  watching the shadows rotate around the mast, we could tell that we  were headed to the west, out to sea. We wondered if the ship was fit  for further voyage.       Our food carriers, returning from the kitchen above, reported,    \"All the other ships in the convoy are gone-probably sunk.\"       As we moved out to sea, we heard muffled explosions - depth charges  to keep submarines away.    After several hours the engines stopped and we drifted gently for some  time, and then the anchors were dropped. We could hear small boats  coming alongside. Wounded passengers were being taken off in the  darkness. A Japanese officer took several American doctors up on deck  to help the wounded. On returning, they reported, \"The decks, cabins  and dining rooms are littered with    dead and dying. We had only candle light no medicines, no bandages.  Actually there was nothing we could do.\"    That night held all of the horrors of the previous night: groaning,  cursing, praying, screaming, and shouting of the wounded and crazed:  \"Don't touch me! Oh! God, NO! Keep away from me! Don't kill me! Give  us air! Let us out! We need water!\" and on through the night. The  unloading continued through the night. No one slept.    Dec. 15, 1944: The bright sunrise rekindled our apprehensions-\" Are we  being left on board the ship to be bombed out of our miseries?\"       We didn't have to wait long planes again closer and closer.       They were diving! This time there were no gun crews on deck!    \"Now they can come in close for the kill!\"    Deadly showers of bullets ricocheted through the hold. Tremendous  explosions shook the ship. Planked flooring off the hold fell into the  bilge, dropping many prisoners into the bottom of the ship; some were  hopelessly pinned down.    I prayed to God and asked for mercy, but felt that I had a poor  connection! Maybe He wasn't listening! He probably .had more important  things to do! My feelings were of complete submission-\"What will be,  will be!\"    Our doctors were frustrated! Wounds were covered with dirt blood  bubbling through the filth. No water available! We tore up clothing  for bandages, and hoped a miracle might help.    Large fires were burning in the stern of the ship where a bomb had  made a direct hit. We couldn't understand why Admiral Halsey's pilots  had not been informed that American prisoners were aboard the Oryoku  Maru.    It was disturbing to be bombed by our own Navy aviators \"our friends.\"  Yet, I couldn't bear them any ill will. They obviously didn't know!    Mr. Wata, the diminutive and deformed Japanese interpreter, appeared  at the top of the hold, and shouted down, \"Abandon ship! Remove all  clothing! Wounded must come up first! All of you leave ship!\"    As the first fifty wounded reached the deck, back came the planes  strafing and bombing. Many of those reaching the deck were killed or  further wounded. In a few minutes we got a second opportunity to go up  the ladder. Knowing I would have to swim,    I removed my shoes and outer clothing; I discarded them with my  medical bag and \"our\" precious can of Spam. The rungs of the ladder  were very sharp and painful to my bare feet. By the time I had reached  the deck I was exhausted.    I was suddenly aware that three planes overhead were diving! I  believed I must get away from the ship and fast. I ran across the deck  toward the nearest shore and jumped off-just like in, the movies. Some  five decks below, I hit the water and descended about twenty feet; it  was a desperate struggle through oceans of green water to reach the  surface and God's good fresh air.    The planes were pulling out of their dives-they had dropped nothing.  They had spotted the waving prisoners in the water, circled around,  dipped their wings, and disappeared. I saw a piece of bamboo floating  in the water, pushing it; I slowly paddled toward shore, about  one-half mile away. Lt. Toshino and Mr. Wata, still on the ship, were  shooting prisoners possibly the \"coup de grace\" rather freely.    As we neared shore we were rounded up in a group in waist-deep water;  there we remained all day-shivering from cold and fright.    We were in Subic Bay, a large and beautiful harbor, and the site of a  large U.S. Naval base (Olangapo). We were surrounded with the jungles  and mountains of Bataan. Cy Delong and I decided we would climb up on  the sea wall and rest. As we were sitting there watching the group in  the water nearby, a Jap guard came out of the woods behind us, his  bayonet dripping with blood; he raised his rifle and put a shot  straight through Cy's heart, his chest spouting blood.       I wasted no time in jumping into the water and losing myself in the  group.    Twice during the afternoon, Navy planes returned and bombed the ship  with incendiaries-producing intense fires and many explosions.    Tennis Court: Toward evening, we were ordered to come ashore, each  four prisoners to carry a wounded man. Dripping wet, we were herded  through the forest for about one - half mile to a large tennis court  on the naval base.    A count showed 1,340 survivors. We had lost 286 men. Again, there was  not enough room on the court for everyone to sit down. As the sun went  down it became very chilly. There was nothing to eat all day.    Even though it was a great relief to be off the ill-fated Oryoku Maru,  nobody slept. The concrete surfaces became harder and harder as the  hours wore on. The mosquitoes became very enthusiastic about our bare  arms and legs.    Dee. 16, 1944: The warmth of the sun felt good. We improvised a  hospital at one end of the court. We tore up clothing for bandages and  broke up pieces of wood for splints. Many prisoners had serious burns:  faces were swollen and blistered, eyes were closed by edema, and lips  were puffed and cracked. Men who had swallowed oil were retching and  vomiting. Some had inhaled fumes and were coughing uncontrollably.  Fortunately the open air therapy was good for burns. Many survivors  were covered with oil; a very real problem.    My friend Ed, the chaplain, in spite of his painful wound, quickly  sized up the situation. He obtained a bar of soap, a safety razor and  some cloth and water. Ed spent the day washing faces and shaving  beards, trying to bring comfort to his patients."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8452"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 363, December 16, 1882 (#16)"],[1,"re-converted into  a fine violet by washing in abundance of water. When the shades are  very heavy, this grayish brown is almost of a violet-brown, so that the  violets might seem to be unaltered.    The action of hydrochloric acid distinguishes these colors better still  if the aid of ammonia is called in for two cases.    The acid turns logwood violet to a fine red, and equally reddens orchil  violet. But the two colors cannot be confounded, first, because the two  violet shades are very distinct, that of orchil being much the brighter;  and secondly, because ammonia has no action on logwood violet, while it  turns orchil violet, if at all reddish, to a blue shade. Hydrochloric  acid, whether dilute or concentrated, is without action on alkanet  violet. If the acid is dilute, it is equally without action on Perkin's  violet and dahlia. If it is strong, it turns them blue, and even green  if in excess. Hofmann's violet turns green even with dilute acid, but  prolonged washing restores the original violet shade. Dahlia gives a  more blue shade than Perkin's mauve. The action of acid is equally  characteristic for methyl violet. It becomes green, then yellow. Washing  in water re-converts it first to a green, and then to a violet.    The second group includes madder violet, cochineal violet, and the  compound violet of cochineal and extract of indigo. These three dyes are  thus distinguished: Hydrochloric acid turns the madder violet-orange,  slightly brownish, or a light brown, and it affords the characteristic  reaction of the madder colors described above under reds. Cochineal  violets are reddened. Sometimes they are decolorized, and become finally  yellow, but do not pass through a brown stage.    The compound violet of cochineal and extract of indigo presents this  characteristic reaction, that if boiled with very weak solution of  sodium carbonate the liquid becomes blue, rather greenish, while the  cloth becomes a vinous-red--_Moniteur Scientifique.--Chem. News._           *       *       *       *       *          CHEVALET'S CONDENSO-PURIFIER FOR GAS.      The condenso-purifier shown in the accompanying cut operates as  follows: Water is caused to flow over a metallic plate perforated with  innumerable holes of from one to three millimeters in diameter, and  then, under this disk, which is exactly horizontal, a current of gas is  introduced. Under these circumstances the liquid does not traverse the  holes in the plate, but is supported by the gas coming in an opposite  direction. Provided that the gas has sufficient pressure, it bubbles up  through the water and becomes so much the more divided in proportion as  the holes are smaller and more numerous.    The gas is washed by traversing the liquid, and freed from the tar and  coal-dust carried along with it; while, at the same time, the ammonia  that it contains dissolves in the water, and this, too, so much the  better the colder the latter is. This apparatus, then, permits of  obtaining two results: a mechanical one, consisting in the stoppage of  the solid matters, and a chemical one, consisting in the stoppage of the  soluble portions, such as ammonia, sulphureted hydrogen, and carbonic  acid.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--CONDENSO-PURIFIER FOR GAS. (Elevation.)]    The condenso-purifier consists of three perforated diaphragms, placed  one over the other in rectilinear cast-iron boxes. These diaphragms are  movable, and slide on projections running round the interior of the  boxes. In each of the latter there is an overflow pipe, g, that runs to  the box or compartment below, and an unperforated plate, f, that slides  over the diaphragm so as to cover or uncover as many of the holes as may  be necessary. A stream of common water runs in through the funnel, e,  over the upper diaphragm, while the gas enters the apparatus through the  pipe, a, and afterward takes the direction shown by the arrows.  Reaching the level of the overflow, the water escapes, fills the lower  compartment, covers the middle diaphragm, then passes through the second  overflow-pipe to cover the lower diaphragm, next runs through the  overflow-pipe of the third diaphragm on to the bottom of the purifier,  and lastly makes its exit, through a siphon. A pressure gauge, having an  inlet for the gas above and below, serves for regulating the pressure  absorbed for each diaphragm, and which should vary between 0.01 and  0.012 of a meter.    The effect of this purifier is visible when the operation is performed  with an apparatus made externally of glass. The gas is observed to enter  in the form of smoke under the first diaphragm, and the water to become  discolored and tarry. When the gas traverses the second diaphragm, it is  observed to issue from the water entirely colorless, while the latter  becomes slightly discolored, and finally, when it traverses the third  diaphragm, the water is left perfectly limpid.    Two diaphragms have been found sufficient to completely remove the solid  particles carried along by the gas, the third producing only a chemical  effect.    This apparatus may replace two of the systems employed in gas works: (1)  mechanical condensers, such as the systems of Pelouze & Audouin, and  of Servier; and (2) scrubbers of different kinds and coke columns.  Nevertheless, it is well to retain the last named, if the gas works have  them, but to modify their work.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--PLAN VIEW WITH BY-PASS.]    This purifier should always be placed directly after the condensers, and  is to be supplied with a stream of pure water at the rate of 50 liters  of water per 1,000 cubic meters of gas. Such water passes only once into  the purifier, and issues therefrom sufficiently rich in ammonia to be  treated.    If there are coke columns in the works, they are placed after the  purifier, filled with wood shavings or well washed gravel, and then  supplied with pure cold water in the proportion stated above. The water  that flows from the columns passes afterward into the condenso-purifier,  where it becomes charged with ammonia, and removes from the gas the tar  that the latter has carried along, and then makes its exit and goes to  the decanting cistern.    In operating thus, all the remaining ammonia that might have escaped the  condenso-purifier is removed, and the result is obtained without pumps  or motor, with apparatus that costs but little and does not occupy much  space. The advantages that are derived from this, as regards sulphate  of ammonia, are important; for, on treating ammoniacal waters with  condensers, scarcely more than four to five kilogrammes of the sulphate  are obtained per ton of coal distilled, while by washing the gas  perfectly with the small quantity of water indicated, four to five  kilogrammes more can be got per 1,000 kilogrammes of coal, or a total of  eight to ten kilogrammes per ton.    When the gas is not washed sufficiently, almost all of the ammonia  condenses in the purifying material.    The pressure absorbed by the condenso purifier is from ten to twelve  millimeters per washing-diaphragm. In works that are not provided with  an extractor, two diaphragms, or even a single one, are employed when it  is desired simply to catch the tar.    The apparatus under consideration was employed in the St. Quentin  gas works during the winter of 1881-1882, without giving rise to any  obstruction; and, besides, it was found that by its use there might be  avoided all choking up of the pipes at the works and the city mains  through naphthaline.    In cases of obstruction, it is very easy to take out the perforated  diaphragms; this being done by removing the bolts from the piece that  holds the register, f, and then removing the diaphragm and putting in  another. This operation takes about ten minutes. The advantages of such  a mounting of the diaphragms is that it allows the gas manufacturer to  employ (and easily change) the number of perforations that he finds best  suited to his needs.    These apparatus are constructed for productions of from 1,000 to 100,000  cubic meters of gas per twenty four hours. They have been applied  advantageously in the washing of smoke from potassa furnaces, in order  to collect the ammonia that escapes from the chimneys. In one of such  applications, the quantity of gas and steam washed reached a million  cubic meters per twenty-four hours.--_Revue Industrielle._           *       *       *       *       *          ARTIFICIAL IVORY.      It is said that artificial ivory of a pure white color and very durable  has been manufactured by dissolving shellac in ammonia, mixing the  solution with oxide of zinc, driving off ammonia by heating, powdering,  and strongly compressing in moulds.           *       *       *       *       *          CREOSOTE IMPURITIES.    [Footnote: Read at the meeting of the American Pharmaceutical  Association held at Niagara Falls. 1882.]    By Prof. P. W. BEDFORD.      The object of this query can be but one, namely, to inquire whether the  wood creosote offered for sale is a pure article, or not; and if not,  what is the impurity present?    The relative commercial value of the articles sold as coal tar creosote  and wood creosote disposes of the question as to the latter being  present in the former article, and we are quite certain that the cheap  variety is nothing more or less than a phenol or carbolic acid. Wood  creosote, it has been frequently stated, is adulterated with coal tar  creosote, or phenol. The object of my experiments has been to prove the  identity of wood creosote and its freedom from phenol. The following  tests are laid down in various works as conclusive evidence of its  purity, and each has been fully tried with the several samples of wood  creosote to prove their identity and purity, and also with phenol, sold  as commercial creosote or coal tar creosote, and for comparison with  mixtures of the two, that even small percentages of admixture might be "]]]
