If in addition to the temptations from within he has foes also  without in the form of companions who sneer at his desire for  improvement, controvert the statements made to him, and throw  temptation in his way, his chance of cure must be enormously  decreased. Of such cases I know nothing; for my experience lies solely  among boys who have, outside their own hearts, little to hinder and  very much to help. As I have dealt elsewhere with the question of aids  to chastity, I will make only a brief reference to it here.    The mind is so much influenced by the body that purity is impossible  when the body is unduly indulged. No man exists who could inhale the  vapour of chloroform without an irresistible desire to sleep. Under  these conditions the strongest will would not avail even if the victim  knew that by surrender he was sacrificing everything he reverenced and  held dear. The lad past the age of puberty who has much stimulating  food, who drinks alcohol, who sleeps in a warm and luxurious bed and  occupies it for some time before or after sleep, is certain, even if  he takes much exercise, to be tempted irresistibly. Dr. Dukes  considers that a heavy meat meal with alcohol shortly before bedtime  is in itself sufficient to ensure a lad's fall.    Meanwhile, no abstinence which it not unduly rigorous, can save a boy  from impurity if he gets into the habit of exchanging glances with  girls who are socially inferior, if he reads suggestive books, looks  at stimulating pictures and sights, and falls into the hopeless folly  of entertaining sexual thoughts even momentarily. He who has not the  strength to tread out a spark is little likely to subdue a  conflagration.    The best and most timely teaching will never make carelessness in  these matters justifiable, and a boy who has once been corrupted and  desires to master his lower nature has no chance of self-conquest  unless he gives them his constant and careful attention.    It is very important to fill a boy's leisure with congenial  occupation. Idleness and dullness make a boy specially susceptible to  temptation. On the other hand, the fond parent who satisfies a boy's  every whim and encourages the lad to think that his own enjoyment is  the chief thing in life does his utmost to destroy the lad's chance of  purity--or, indeed, of any virtue whatever.    Can anything be done for boys and young men who have become the slaves  of self-abuse to such an extent that they groan in the words of St.  Paul: \"The good that I would I do not, but the evil which I would not,  that I do.... I delight in the law of God after the inward man, but I  see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and  bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. O  wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this  death?\" Can anything be done for the lad who has become so defiled by  lustful thoughts that his utmost efforts fail to carry him forward,  and even leave him to sink deeper in the mire. There are many, many  such cases, alas! for as Dr. Acton says, \"The youth is a dreamer who  will open the floodgates of an ocean, and then attempt to prescribe at  will a limit to the inundation.\"    Yes there is a remedy--I believe a specific--which can rapidly and, I  think, finally restore strength to the enfeebled will and order the  unclean spirit to come out of the man. It is hypnotic suggestion. Let  not the reader, however, think that the matter is a simple one. In all  ages any great advance in the art of healing has, by the ignorant,  been attributed to the powers of darkness. The Divine Healer Himself  did not escape from the charge of casting out devils by the prince of  the devils, and, while hypnotic suggestion has long been used for  therapeutic purposes on the Continent and is now practised in  Government institutions there, the doctor or clergyman or teacher who  uses it in England runs great risks; for in this subject, as in all  others, it is those who are entirely without experience who are most  dogmatic.    In the case of the schoolmaster, its use in this connection is  practically excluded. If he applies to a parent for permission to use  it he probably runs his head against a blank wall of ignorance; for  hypnotism, to most people, means a dangerous power by which an  unscrupulous, strong-willed Svengali dominates an abnormally  weak-willed Trilby whose will continues to grow weaker until the  subject becomes a mere automaton; and most of us would rightly prefer  that a boy should be his own master--even if he were rushing to  headlong ruin--than that he should be the mere puppet of the most  saintly man living. The human will is sacred and inviolable, and we do  unwisely if we seek to control it or to remove those obstacles from  its way by which alone it can gain divine strength. Meanwhile the  stimulus by which the mind acquires self-mastery usually comes from  without in the form of spiritual inspiration; and to remove from a  boy's path an obstacle which blocks it and is entirely beyond his own  strength is equally desirable both in the physical and in the  spiritual realm. Those who think that without this obstacle a boy's  power of self-control is likely to receive insufficient exercise will,  of course, object to the instruction advocated in this book. If it is  unwise to remove this obstacle from a boy's path it is equally unwise  so to instruct him as to prevent the obstacle from arising. In  _trustworthy_ hands hypnotic suggestion is a beneficent power which  has no dangers and no drawbacks, and to decline to use it is to accept  a very serious responsibility.    For the teacher a further difficulty--not to mention that of time--is  that, without betraying a boy's confidence or inducing him to allow  his admissions to be passed on to his father, it is impossible to give  his parents an idea of the urgency of the case.    Altogether the time for hypnotic suggestion in education is not yet,  but the day must come when its use is recognised not only in physical  cases such as nocturnal emissions and constipation, but in all cases  in which the will-power is practically in abeyance, as it is in bad  cases of impurity.    For intelligent parents the difficulties are far less, and if any such  care to pursue the subject farther, I would refer them to the volume  on _Hypnotism_ in the People's Books series or to one of the larger  medical works on the subject, such as _Hypnotism and Suggestion_, by  Dr. Bernard Hollander.    To those who know boys well and love them much, there is something  intensely interesting and pathetic about the spiritual struggle  through which they have to pass. The path of self-indulgence seems so  obviously the path to happiness; self-denial is so hard and  self-control so difficult. \"The struggle of the instinct that enjoys  and the more noble instinct that aspires\" is ever there. The young  soul reaches out after good, but its grasp is weak. It needs much  enlightenment, much encouragement, much inspiration, much patient  tolerance of its faults, much hopeful sympathy with its strivings, if  it is ever to attain the good it seeks. In the past it has met,  without light or aid, unwarned and unprepared, the deadliest foe which  can assail the soul. An appetite which has in all ages debased the  weak, wrestled fiercely with the strong, and vanquished at times even  the noble, is let loose upon an unwarned, unarmed, defenceless child.  Oh, the utter, the utter folly of it!    For life after death the writer has no longing. Immortality, if  vouchsafed, appears to him to be a gift to be accepted trustfully and  humbly, not to be yearned after with a sort of transcendental egoism.  But to him the wish to--                    \"Join the choir invisible      Of those immortal dead who live again      In minds made better by their presence\"    grows ever stronger as the inevitable end draws nearer.    To save young lives from the needless struggles and failures of my  own, to secure healthy motherhood or maiden life to some whom lust  might otherwise destroy, to add, for some at least, new sanctity to  human passion--these have been my hopes in penning the foregoing  pages. It has been my privilege and joy, in my own quiet sphere, to  preserve boys from corruption and to restore the impure to cleanness  of heart. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity these pages afford  of extending this delightful work. When the hand which writes these  lines has long been cold in death, may the message which it speeds  this day breathe peace and strength into many an eager heart.          NOTE TO CORRESPONDENTS.    TO BOYS.      I warmly invite any boy who has read these pages to write to me if he  feels inclined to do so. Since this book was first published I have  received hundreds of letters from boys who have, without any definite  invitation, understood that it would please me much to hear from them.  Many boys feel all the better for frankly confessing their  difficulties to a man who fully understands and sympathises with them.  Some desire advice about their own case. Anyone who accepts this  invitation will do wisely to give me a full and frank history of his  difficulties. His confidences will, of course, be strictly respected.  He will also, I hope, remember that I am an extremely busy man with  many and urgent claims on my time, and that I cannot always reply as  quickly and as fully as I should like to do.      TO YOUNG MEN.    Before a young man marries he should always seek advice from a  trustworthy source with regard to his conduct as a husband. No  satisfactory book is, or perhaps could be, published on this subject;  and even if a young man can make up his mind to consult a doctor, it  is by no means every doctor who has the needful knowledge on this  subject or the best moral outlook. It has been my privilege to help  several in this "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1377"],[0,"The Talisman (#17)"],[1," might,  at another period, have been much amused by the mummery of these poor  effigies of humanity; but now their appearance, gesticulations, and  language broke the train of deep and solemn feeling with which he was  impressed, and he rejoiced in the disappearance of the unhappy objects.    A few minutes after they had retired, the door at which he had entered  opened slowly, and remaining ajar, discovered a faint light arising from  a lantern placed upon the threshold. Its doubtful and wavering gleam  showed a dark form reclined beside the entrance, but without its  precincts, which, on approaching it more nearly, he recognized to be the  hermit, crouching in the same humble posture in which he had at first  laid himself down, and which, doubtless, he had retained during the  whole time of his guest's continuing in the chapel.    \"All is over,\" said the hermit, as he heard the knight approaching, \"and  the most wretched of earthly sinners, with him who should think himself  most honoured and most happy among the race of humanity, must retire  from this place. Take the light, and guide me down the descent, for I  must not uncover my eyes until I am far from this hallowed spot.\"    The Scottish knight obeyed in silence, for a solemn and yet ecstatic  sense of what he had seen had silenced even the eager workings of  curiosity. He led the way, with considerable accuracy, through the  various secret passages and stairs by which they had ascended, until at  length they found themselves in the outward cell of the hermit's cavern.    \"The condemned criminal is restored to his dungeon, reprieved from one  miserable day to another, until his awful Judge shall at length appoint  the well-deserved sentence to be carried into execution.\"    As the hermit spoke these words, he laid aside the veil with which his  eyes had been bound, and looked at it with a suppressed and hollow sigh.  No sooner had he restored it to the crypt from which he had caused the  Scot to bring it, than he said hastily and sternly to his companion;  \"Begone, begone--to rest, to rest. You may sleep--you can sleep--I  neither can nor may.\"    Respecting the profound agitation with which this was spoken, the knight  retired into the inner cell; but casting back his eye as he left the  exterior grotto, he beheld the anchorite stripping his shoulders with  frantic haste of their shaggy mantle, and ere he could shut the frail  door which separated the two compartments of the cavern, he heard  the clang of the scourge and the groans of the penitent under his  self-inflicted penance. A cold shudder came over the knight as he  reflected what could be the foulness of the sin, what the depth of the  remorse, which, apparently, such severe penance could neither cleanse  nor assuage. He told his beads devoutly, and flung himself on his rude  couch, after a glance at the still sleeping Moslem, and, wearied by the  various scenes of the day and the night, soon slept as sound as infancy.  Upon his awaking in the morning, he held certain conferences with the  hermit upon matters of importance, and the result of their intercourse  induced him to remain for two days longer in the grotto. He was regular,  as became a pilgrim, in his devotional exercises, but was not again  admitted to the chapel in which he had seen such wonders.        CHAPTER VI.         Now change the scene--and let the trumpets sound,       For we must rouse the lion from his lair.  OLD PLAY.    The scene must change, as our programme has announced, from the mountain  wilderness of Jordan to the camp of King Richard of England, then  stationed betwixt Jean d'Acre and Ascalon, and containing that army with  which he of the lion heart had promised himself a triumphant march  to Jerusalem, and in which he would probably have succeeded, if not  hindered by the jealousies of the Christian princes engaged in the same  enterprise, and the offence taken by them at the uncurbed haughtiness  of the English monarch, and Richard's unveiled contempt for his brother  sovereigns, who, his equals in rank, were yet far his inferiors  in courage, hardihood, and military talents. Such discords, and  particularly those betwixt Richard and Philip of France, created  disputes and obstacles which impeded every active measure proposed by  the heroic though impetuous Richard, while the ranks of the Crusaders  were daily thinned, not only by the desertion of individuals, but of  entire bands, headed by their respective feudal leaders, who withdrew  from a contest in which they had ceased to hope for success.    The effects of the climate became, as usual, fatal to soldiers from  the north, and the more so that the dissolute license of the Crusaders,  forming a singular contrast to the principles and purpose of their  taking up arms, rendered them more easy victims to the insalubrious  influence of burning heat and chilling dews. To these discouraging  causes of loss was to be added the sword of the enemy. Saladin, than  whom no greater name is recorded in Eastern history, had learned, to  his fatal experience, that his light-armed followers were little able to  meet in close encounter with the iron-clad Franks, and had been taught,  at the same time, to apprehend and dread the adventurous character of  his antagonist Richard. But if his armies were more than once routed  with great slaughter, his numbers gave the Saracen the advantage in  those lighter skirmishes, of which many were inevitable.    As the army of his assailants decreased, the enterprises of the Sultan  became more numerous and more bold in this species of petty warfare. The  camp of the Crusaders was surrounded, and almost besieged, by clouds of  light cavalry, resembling swarms of wasps, easily crushed when they are  once grasped, but furnished with wings to elude superior strength, and  stings to inflict harm and mischief. There was perpetual warfare of  posts and foragers, in which many valuable lives were lost, without  any corresponding object being gained; convoys were intercepted, and  communications were cut off. The Crusaders had to purchase the means  of sustaining life, by life itself; and water, like that of the well of  Bethlehem, longed for by King David, one of its ancient monarchs, was  then, as before, only obtained by the expenditure of blood.    These evils were in a great measure counterbalanced by the stern  resolution and restless activity of King Richard, who, with some of his  best knights, was ever on horseback, ready to repair to any point where  danger occurred, and often not only bringing unexpected succour to the  Christians, but discomfiting the infidels when they seemed most secure  of victory. But even the iron frame of Coeur de Lion could not support  without injury the alternations of the unwholesome climate, joined to  ceaseless exertions of body and mind. He became afflicted with one of  those slow and wasting fevers peculiar to Asia, and in despite of his  great strength and still greater courage, grew first unfit to mount on  horseback, and then unable to attend the councils of war which were from  time to time held by the Crusaders. It was difficult to say whether this  state of personal inactivity was rendered more galling or more endurable  to the English monarch by the resolution of the council to engage in a  truce of thirty days with the Sultan Saladin; for on the one hand, if he  was incensed at the delay which this interposed to the progress of the  great enterprise, he was, on the other, somewhat consoled by knowing  that others were not acquiring laurels while he remained inactive upon a  sick-bed.    That, however, which Coeur de Lion could least excuse was the general  inactivity which prevailed in the camp of the Crusaders so soon as his  illness assumed a serious aspect; and the reports which he extracted  from his unwilling attendants gave him to understand that the hopes of  the host had abated in proportion to his illness, and that the interval  of truce was employed, not in recruiting their numbers, reanimating  their courage, fostering their spirit of conquest, and preparing for a  speedy and determined advance upon the Holy City, which was the  object of their expedition, but in securing the camp occupied by their  diminished followers with trenches, palisades, and other fortifications,  as if preparing rather to repel an attack from a powerful enemy so soon  as hostilities should recommence, than to assume the proud character of  conquerors and assailants.    The English king chafed under these reports, like the imprisoned lion  viewing his prey from the iron barriers of his cage. Naturally rash  and impetuous, the irritability of his temper preyed on itself. He was  dreaded by his attendants and even the medical assistants feared to  assume the necessary authority which a physician, to do justice to his  patient, must needs exercise over him. One faithful baron, who, perhaps,  from the congenial nature of his disposition, was devoutly attached to  the King's person, dared alone to come between the dragon and his wrath,  and quietly, but firmly, maintained a control which no other dared  assume over the dangerous invalid, and which Thomas de Multon only  exercised because he esteemed his sovereign's life and honour more than  he did the degree of favour which he might lose, or even the risk  which he might incur, in nursing a patient so intractable, and whose  displeasure was so perilous.    Sir Thomas was the Lord of Gilsland, in Cumberland, and in an age  when surnames and titles were not distinctly attached, as now, to the  individuals who bore them, he was called by the Normans the Lord de  Vaux; and in English by the Saxons, who clung to their native language,  and were proud of the share of Saxon blood in this renowned warrior's  veins, he was termed Thomas, or, more familiarly, Thom of the Gills,  or Narrow Valleys, from which his extensive domains derived their  well-known appellation.
