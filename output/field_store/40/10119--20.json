Washington, D.C., August 17, 1898.    Editor Colored American: The Star of this city published the following  dispatch in its issue of the 16th inst. The Washington Post next  morning published the same dispatch, omitting the last paragraph;  and yet the Post claims to publish the news, whether pleasing or  otherwise. The selection of the 8th Illinois colored regiment for  this important duty, to replace a disorderly white regiment, is a  sufficient refutation of a recent editorial in the Post, discrediting  colored troops with colored officers. The Eighth Illinois is a colored  regiment from Colonel down. The Generals at the front know the value  of Negro troops, whether the quill-drivers in the rear do or not.    CHARLES R. DOUGLASS.

IMMUNES MADE TROUBLE--GENERAL SHAFTER ORDERS THE SECOND REGIMENT  OUTSIDE THE CITY OF SANTIAGO--COLORED TROOPS FROM ILLINOIS ASSIGNED TO  THE DUTY OF PRESERVING ORDER AND PROPERTY.    Santiago de Cuba, Aug. 16.--General Shafter to-day ordered the Second  Volunteer Regiment of Immunes to leave the city and go into camp  outside.    The regiment had been placed here as a garrison, to preserve order and  protect property. There has been firing of arms inside of the town by  members of this regiment, without orders, so far as known. Some of  the men have indulged in liquor until they have verged upon acts of  license and disorder. The inhabitants in some quarters have alleged  loss of property by force and intimidation, and there has grown up a  feeling of uneasiness, if not alarm, concerning them. General Shafter  has, therefore, ordered this regiment into the hills, where discipline  can be more severely maintained.    In place of the Second Volunteer Immune Regiment, General Shafter  has ordered into the city the Eighth Illinois Volunteer Regiment of  colored troops, in whose sobriety and discipline he has confidence,  and of whose sturdy enforcement of order no doubt is felt by those in  command.           *       *       *       *       *    SKETCH OF SIXTH VIRGINIA VOLUNTEERS.    The Sixth Virginia Volunteer Infantry, U.S.V., consisted of two  battalions, first and second Battalion Infantry Virginia Volunteers  (State militia), commanded respectively by Maj. J.B. Johnson and Maj.  W.H. Johnson. In April, 1898, the war cloud was hanging over the land.  Governor J. Hoge Tyler, of Virginia, under instructions from the War  Department, sent to all Virginia volunteers inquiring how many men in  the respective commands were willing to enlist in the United States  volunteer service in the war against Spain.    How many would go in or out of the United States.           *       *       *       *       *    COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA,    Adjutant-General's Office, Richmond, Va., April 19th, 1898.    General Order No. 8.    I. Commanding officers of companies of Virginia Volunteers will,  immediately, upon the receipt by them of this order, assemble their  respective companies and proceed to ascertain and report direct to  this office, upon the form herewith sent and by letter, what officers  and enlisted men of their companies will volunteer for service in and  with the volunteer forces of the United States (not in the regular  army) with the distinct understanding that such volunteer forces, or  any portion thereof, may be ordered and required to perform service  either in or out of the United States, and that such officer or  enlisted man, so volunteering, agrees and binds himself to, without  question, promptly obey all orders emanating from the proper officers,  and to render such service as he may be required to perform, either  within or beyond the limits of the United States.    [Illustration: MAJOR JOHN R. LYNCH, PAYMASTER IN U.S. ARMY]    II. The Brigade Commander and the Regimental and Battalion Commanders  will, without delay, obtain like information and make, direct to this  office, similar reports, to those above required, with regard to  their respective field, staff and non-commissioned staff officers and  regimental or battalion bands, adopting the form herewith sent to the  regiments.    III. By reason of the necessity in this matter, this order is sent  direct, with copies to intermediate commanders.    By order of the Governor and Commander-in-Chief. WM. NALLE,  Adjutant-General.           *       *       *       *       *    The companies of the First Battalion of Richmond and Second Battalion  of Petersburg and Norfolk were the first to respond to the call and  express a readiness to go anywhere in or out of the States with their  own officers, upon these conditions they were immediately accepted,  and the following order was issued:      COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA, Adjutant-General's Office, Richmond, Va.,  April 23, 1898. General Orders No. 9.    The commanding officers of such companies as will volunteer for  service in the volunteer army of the United States will at once  proceed to recruit their respective companies to at least eighty-four  enlisted men. Any company volunteering as a body, for such service,  will be mustered in with its own officers.    By order of the Governor and Commander-in-Chief. (Signed) W. NALLE,  Adjutant-General.           *       *       *       *       *    Under date of June 1, 1898, S.O. 59, A.G.O., Richmond, Va., was  issued directly to the commanding officers of the First and Second  Battalion (colored), who had been specially designated by the  President in his call, ordering them to take the necessary steps to  recruit the companies of the respective battalions to eighty-three men  per company, directing that care be taken, to accept only men of good  repute and able-bodied, and that as soon as recruited the fact should  be reported by telegraph to the Adjutant-General of the State.    July 15th, 1898, Company \"A,\" Attucks Guard, was the first company to  arrive at Camp Corbin, Va., ten miles below Richmond. The company  had three officers; Capt. W.A. Hawkins, First Lieutenant J.C. Smith,  Lieutenant John Parham.    The other companies followed in rapid succession. Company \"B\" (Carney  Guard), Capt. C.B. Nicholas; First Lieutenant L.J. Wyche, Second  Lieutenant J.W. Gilpin. Company \"C\" (State Guard), Capt. B.A.  Graves; First Lieutenant S.B. Randolph, Second Lieutenant W.H.    Anderson. Company \"D\" (Langston Guard), Capt. E.W. Gould; First  Lieutenant Chas. H. Robinson, Second Lieutenant Geo. W. Foreman.  Company \"E\" (Petersburg Guard), Capt. J.E. Hill; First Lieutenant  J.H. Hill, Second Lieutenant Fred. E. Manggrum. Company \"F\"  (Petersburg), Capt. Pleasant Webb; First Lieutenant Jno. K. Rice,  Second Lieutenant Richard Hill. Company \"G,\" Capt. J.A. Stevens;  First Lieutenant E. Thomas Walker, Second Lieutenant David Worrell.  Company \"H,\" Capt. Peter Shepperd, Jr.; First Lieutenant Jas. M.  Collins, Second Lieutenant Geo. T. Wright. The regiment consisted of  only eight companies, two battalions, commanded respectively by Major  J.B. Johnson and Maj. W.H. Johnson, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel  Rich'd C. Croxton, of the First United States Infantry. First  Lieutenant Chas. R. Alexander was Surgeon. Second Lieutenant Allen J.  Black, Assist Subsistence.    Lieutenant W.H. Anderson, Company \"C,\" was detailed as Adjutant,  Ordinance Officer and Mustering Officer.    Lieutenant J.H. Gilpin, Company \"B,\" was detailed as Quartermaster  and Commissary of Subsistance.    On Monday, September 12, 1898, the command left Camp Corbin, Va., and  embarked for Knoxville, Tenn., about 10 o'clock, the men traveling in  day coaches and the officers in Pullman sleepers. The train was in  two sections. Upon arrival at Knoxville the command was sent to Camp  Poland, near the Fourteenth Michigan Regiment, who were soon mustered  out. A few days after the arrival of the Sixth Virginia the Third  North Carolina arrived, a full regiment with every officer a Negro.  While here in order to get to the city our officers, wagons and men  had to pass the camp of the First Georgia Regiment, and it was quite  annoying to have to suffer from unnecessary delays in stores and other  things to which the men were subject.    After the review by General Alger, Secretary of War, the Colonel of  the Sixth Virginia received permission from headquarters of Third  Brigade, Second Division, First Army Corps, General Rosser commanding,  to move the camp to a point nearer the city, which was granted. Soon  after the arrival of the Third North Carolina Regiment the First  Georgia seemed disposed to attack the colored soldiers, so on a  beautiful September evening some shots were fired into their camp by  the First Georgia men and received quick response. After the little  affair four Georgians were missing. The matter was investigated, the  First Georgia was placed under arrest.    After the removal to a new portion of Camp Poland orders were received  from the headquarters First Army Corps, Lexington, Ky., ordering a  board of examiners for the following officers of the Sixth Virginia:  Maj. W.H. Johnson; Second Battalion, Capt. C.B. Nicholas, Capt.  J.E. Hill, Capt. J.A.C. Stevens, Capt. E.W. Gould, Capt. Peter  Shepperd, Jr., Lieutenants S.B. Randolph, Geo. T. Wright and David  Worrell for examination September 20, 1898, each officer immediately  tendered his resignation, which was at once accepted by the Secretary  of War.    [Illustration: MAJOR R.R. WRIGHT, PAYMASTER IN U.S. ARMY.]    Under the rules governing the volunteer army, when vacancies occurred  by death, removal, resignation or otherwise, the Colonel of a regiment  had the power to recommend suitable officers or men to fill the  vacancies by promotions, and the Governor would make the appointment  with the approval of the Secretary of War. Many of the men had high  hopes of gaining a commission; many of the most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11114"],[0,"Debate on Woman Suffrage in the Senate of the United States, (#17)"],[1,"   have not gone back far enough; they have not touched the central      fact, to set it forth in its force and finality. The fact is      original and inherent, behind and at the root of the entire      matter, with all its complication and circumstance. We have to ask      a question to which it is the answer, and whose answer is that of      the whole doubt and dispute.        What is the law of woman-life?        What was she made woman for, and not man?        Shall we look back to that old third chapter of Genesis?        When mankind had taken the knowledge and power of good and evil      into their own hands through the mere earthly wisdom of the      serpent; when the woman had had her hasty outside way and lead,      according to the story, and woe had come of it, what was the      sentence? And was it a penance, or a setting right, or a promise,      or all three?        The serpent was first dealt with. The narrow policy, the keen      cunning, the little, immediate outlook, the expedient motive; all      that was impersonated of temporary shift and outward prudence      in mortal affairs, regardless of, or blind to, the everlasting      issues; all, in short, that represented material and temporal      interest as a rule and order--and is not man's external      administration upon the earth largely forced to be a legislation      upon these principles and economies?--was disposed of with the few      words, \"I will put enmity between thee and the woman.\"        Was this punishment--as reflected upon the woman--or the power of      a grand retrieval for her? Not to man, who had been led, and who      would be led again, by the woman, was the commission of holy      revenge intrusted; but henceforth, \"I will set the woman against      thee.\" Against the very principle and live prompting of evil, or      of mere earthly purpose and motive. \"Between thy seed and her      seed.\" Your struggle with her shall be in and for the very life of      the race. \"It,\" her life brought forth, \"shall bruise thy head,\"      thy whole power, and plan, and insidious cunning; \"and thou shall      bruise,\" shalt sting, torment, hinder, and trouble in the way      and daily going, \"his heel,\" his footstep. Thou, the subtle and      creeping thing of the ground, shalt lurk after and threaten with      crookedness and poison the ways of the men-children in their      earth-toiling; the woman, the mother, shall turn upon thee for and      in them and shall beat thee down!        Unto the woman He said, \"I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and      thy conception.\" The burden and the glory are set in one. The      pain of the world shall be in your heart; the trouble, the      contradiction of it, shall be against your love and insight. But      your pain shall be your power; you shall be the life-bearer;      you shall hold the motive; yours shall be the desire, and your      husband's the dominion. Therefore shall you bring your aspiration      to him, that he may fulfill it for you. \"Your desire shall be unto      him, and he shall rule.\"        And unto Adam He said, \"Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice      of thy wife\"--yes, and because thou wilt hearken--\"thy sorrow      shall be in the labor of the earth; the ground shall be cursed;\"      in all material things shall be cross and trouble, not against      you, but \"for your sake.\" \"In your sorrow you shall eat of it      all the days of your life.\" Your need and struggle shall be with      external things, and with the ruling of them. \"For your sake,\"      that you may learn your mastery, inherit your true power, carry      out with ease and understanding the desire and need of the race,      which woman represents, discerns afar, and pleads to you.        And Adam bowed before the Lord's judgment; we are not told that he      answered anything to that; but he turned to his wife, and in that      moment \"called her name Eve, because she was the mother of all      living.\" Then and there was the division made; and to which, can      we say, was the empire given? Both were set in conditions, hemmed      in to divine and special work: man, by the stress and sorrow of      the ground; woman, by the stress and sorrow of her maternity, and      of her spiritual conception, making her truly the \"mother of all      the living.\"        At the beginning of human history, or tradition, then, we get      the answer to our question: the law of woman-life is central,      interior, and from the heart of things; the law of the man's life      is circumferential, enfolding, shaping, bearing on and around,      outwardly; wheel within wheel is the constitution of human power.      It will be an evil day for the world when the nave shall leave its      place and contend for that of the felloe. Iron-rimmed for its busy      revolution and outward contact is the life and strength of man;      but the tempered steel is at the heart and within the soul of the      woman, that she may bear the silent pressure of the axle, and      quietly and invisibly originate and support the entire onward      movement. \"The spirit of the living creature is in the wheels,\"      and they can move no otherwise. \"When the living creatures went,      the wheels went by them; and when the living creatures were lifted      up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.\" That was what      Ezekiel saw in his vision.        There can he no going forward without a life and presence and      impulse at the center; and in the organization of humanity there      is where the place and power of woman have been put. For good or      for evil, for the serpent or for the redeeming Christ, she must      move, must influence, must achieve beforehand, and at the heart;      she must be the mother of the race; she must be the mother of the      Messiah. Not woman in her own person, but \"one born of woman,\" is      the Saviour. For everything that is formed of the Creator, from      the unorganized stone to the thought of righteousness in the heart      of the race, there must be a matrix; in the creation and in the      recreation of His human child God makes woman and the soul of      woman His blessed organ and instrument. When woman clears herself      of her own perversions, her self-imposed limitations, returns to      her spiritual power and place, and cries, \"Behold the handmaid of      the Lord; be it unto me according to Thy word,\" then shall the      spirit descend unto her; then shall come the redemption.        Take this for the starting-point; it is the key.        Within, behind, antecedent to all result in action, are the      place and office of the woman--by the law of woman-life. And all      question of her deed and duty should be brought to this test. Is      it of her own, interior, natural relation, putting her at her true      advantage, harmonious with the key to which her life is set? I      think this suffrage question must settle itself precisely upon      this ground-principle, and that all argument should range      conclusively around it. Judging so, we should find, I think, that      not at the polls, where the last utterance of a people's voice      is given--where the results of character, and conscience, and      intelligence are shown--is her best and rightful work: on the      contrary, that it is useless here, unless first done elsewhere.      But where little children learn to think and speak--where men love      and listen, and the word is forming--is the office she has to      fill, the errand she has to do. The question is, can she do both?      Is there need that she should do both? Does not the former and      greater include the latter and less?        Hers are indeed the primary meetings: in her nursery, her home,      and social circles; with other women, with young men, upon whose      tone and character in her maturity her womanhood and motherhood      join their beautiful and mighty influence; above all, among young      girls--the \"little women,\" to whom the ensign and commission are      descending--is her undisputed power. Purify politics? Purify the      sewers? But what if, first, the springs, and reservoirs, and      conduits could be watched, guarded, filtered, and then the using      be made clean and careful all through the homes; a better system      devised and carried out for separating, neutralizing, destroying      hurtful refuse? Then the poisonous gases might not be creeping      back upon us through our enforced economies, our makeshifts and      stop-gaps of outside legislation. For legislation is, after all,      but cut-off, curb, and patch; an external, troublesome, partial,      uncertain application of hindrance and remedy. What physician will      work with lotion and plaster when he can touch, and control, and      heal at the very seat of the disease?        It is the beginning of the fulfillment that women have waked to      the consciousness that they have not as yet filled their full      place in human life and affairs. Only has not the mistake been      made of contending with and grappling results, when causes were in      their hands? Have they not let go the mainsprings to run after      and effectually push with pins the refractory cogs upon the      wheel-rims?        Woman always deserts herself when she puts her life and motive      and influence in mere outsides. Outsides of fashion and place,      outsides of charm and apparel, outsides of work and ambition--she      must learn that these are not her true showing; she must go hack      and put herself where God has called her to be with Himself, at      the silent, holy inmost; then we shall feel, if not at once, yet      surely soon or some time, a new order beginning. He, the Father      of all, gives it to us to be the motherhood. That is the great      solving and upraising word; not limited to mere parentage, but the      law of woman-life. For good or for evil she"]]]
