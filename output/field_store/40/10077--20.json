A thick,  telltale bandage was wrapped about his breast. And Wu Chi, skillful in  such matters from a long experience, was sliding about the room in his  whispering slippers. The sheriff did not open his eyes when Elizabeth  tried his pulse. It was faint, but steady.    He had been shot through the body and the lungs grazed, for as he  breathed there was a faint bubble of blood that grew and swelled and  burst on his lips at every breath. But he lived, and he would live unless  there were an unnecessary change for the worse. They went softly out of  the room again. Elizabeth was grave. Mr. Gainor took her hand.    \"I think I know what people are saying now, and what they will say  hereafter. If Terry's father were any other than Hollis, this affair  would soon he forgotten, except as a credit to him. But even as it is, he  will live this matter down. I want to tell you again, Miss Cornish, that  you have reason to be proud of him. He is the sort of man I should be  proud to have in my own family. Madam, good-by. And if there is anything  in which I can be of service to you or to Terence, call on me at any time  and to any extent.\"    And he went down the hall with a little swagger. Mr. Gainor felt that he  had risen admirably to a great situation. As a matter of fact, he had.    Elizabeth turned to Vance.    \"I wish you'd find Terence,\" she said, \"and tell him that I'm waiting for  him in the library.\"        CHAPTER 16      Vance went gloomily to the room of Terry and called him out. The boy was  pale, but perfectly calm, and he looked older, much older.    \"There was a great deal of talk,\" said Vance--he must make doubly sure of  Terence now. \"And they even started a little lynching party. But we  stopped all that. Gainor made a very nice little speech about you. And  now Elizabeth is waiting for you in the library.\"    Terry bit his lip.    \"And she?\" he asked anxiously.    \"There's nothing to worry about,\" Vance assured him.    \"She'll probably read you a curtain lecture. But at heart she's proud of  you because of the way Gainor talked. You can't do anything wrong in my  sister's eyes.\"    Terry breathed a great sigh of relief.    \"But I'm not ashamed of what I've done. I'm really not, Uncle Vance. I'm  afraid that I'd do it over again, under the same circumstances.\"    \"Of course you would. Of course you would, my boy. But you don't have to  blurt that out to Elizabeth, do you? Let her think it was the  overwhelming passion of the moment; something like that. A woman likes to  be appealed to, not defied. Particularly Elizabeth. Take my advice.  She'll open her arms to you after she's been stern as the devil for a  moment.\"    The boy caught his hand and wrung it.    \"By the Lord, Uncle Vance,\" he said, \"I certainly appreciate this!\"    \"Tush, Terry, tush!\" said Vance. \"You'll find that I'm with you and  behind you in more ways than you'd ever guess.\"    He received a grateful glance as they went down the broad stairs  together. At the door to the library Vance turned away, but Elizabeth  called to him and asked him in. He entered behind Terence Hollis, and  found Elizabeth sitting in her father's big chair under the window,  looking extremely fragile and very erect and proud. Across her lap was a  legal-looking document.    Vance knew instantly that it was the will she had made up in favor of  Terence. He had been preparing himself for the worst, but at this his  heart sank. He lowered himself into a chair. Terence had gone straight to  Elizabeth.    \"I know I've done a thing that will cut you deeply, Aunt Elizabeth,\" he  said. \"I'm not going to ask you to see any justice on my side. I only  want to ask you to forgive me, because--\"    Elizabeth was staring straight at and through her protege.    \"Are you done, Terence?\"    This time Vance was shocked into wide-eyed attention. The voice of  Elizabeth was hard as iron. It brought a corresponding stiffening of  Terence.    \"I'm done,\" he said, with a certain ring to his voice that Vance was glad  to hear.    It brought a flush into the pale cheeks of Elizabeth.    \"It is easy to see that you're proud of what you have done, Terence.\"    \"Yes,\" he answered with sudden defiance, \"I am proud. It's the best thing  I've ever done. I regret only one part of it.\"    \"And that?\"    \"That my bullet didn't kill him!\"    Elizabeth looked down and tapped the folded paper against her fingertips.  Whether it was mere thoughtfulness or a desire to veil a profound emotion  from Terence, her brother could not tell. But he knew that something of  importance was in the air. He scented it as clearly as the smoke of a  forest fire.    \"I thought,\" she said in her new and icy manner, \"that that would be your  one regret.\"    She looked suddenly up at Terence.    \"Twenty-four years,\" she said, \"have passed since I took you into my  life. At that time I was told that I was doing a rash thing, a dangerous  thing--that before your twenty-fifth birthday the bad blood would out;  that you would, in short, have shot a man. And the prophecy has come  true. By an irony of chance it has happened on the very last day. And by  another irony you picked your victim from among the guests under my  roof!\"    \"Victim?\" cried Terry hoarsely. \"Victim, Aunt Elizabeth?\"    \"If you please,\" she said quietly, \"not that name again, Terence. I wish  you to know exactly what I have done. Up to this time I have given you a  place in my affections. I have tried to the best of my skill to bring you  up with a fitting education. I have given you what little wisdom and  advice I have to give. Today I had determined to do much more. I had a  will made out--this is it in my hands--and by the terms of this will I  made you my heir--the heir to the complete Cornish estate aside from a  comfortable annuity to Vance.\"    She looked him in the eye, ripped the will from end to end, and tossed  the fragments into the fire. There was a sharp cry from Vance, who sprang  to his feet. It was the thrill of an unexpected triumph, but his sister  took it for protest.    \"Vance, I haven't used you well, but from now on I'm going to change. As  for you, Terence, I don't want you near me any longer than may be  necessary. Understand that I expect to provide for you. I haven't raised  you merely to cast you down suddenly. I'm going to establish you in  business, see that you are comfortable, supply you with an income that's  respectable, and then let you drift where you will.    \"My own mind is made up about your end before you take a step across the  threshold of my house. But I'm still going to give you every chance. I  don't want to throw you out suddenly, however. Take your time. Make up  your mind what you want to do and where you are going. Take all the time  you wish for such a conclusion. It's important, and it needs time for  such a decision. When that decision is made, go your way. I never wish to  hear from you again. I want no letters, and I shall certainly refuse to  see you.\"    Every word she spoke seemed to be a heavier blow than the last, and  Terence bowed under the accumulated weight. Vance could see the boy  struggle, waver between fierce pride and desperate humiliation and  sorrow. To Vance it was clear that the stiff pride of Elizabeth as she  sat in the chair was a brittle strength, and one vital appeal would break  her to tears. But the boy did not see. Presently he straightened, bowed  to her in the best Colby fashion, and turned on his heel. He went out of  the room and left Vance and his sister facing one another, but not  meeting each other's glances.    \"Elizabeth,\" he said at last, faintly--he dared not persuade too much  lest she take him at his word. \"Elizabeth, you don't mean it. It was  twenty-four years ago that you passed your word to do this if things  turned out as they have. Forget your promise. My dear, you're still  wrapped up in Terry, no matter what you have said. Let me go and call him  back. Why should you torture yourself for the sake of your pride?\"    He even rose, not too swiftly, and still with his eyes upon her. When she  lifted her hand, he willingly sank back into his chair.    \"You're a very kind soul, Vance. I never knew it before. I'm appreciating  it now almost too late. But what I have done shall stand!\"    \"But, my dear, the pain--is it worth--\"    \"It means that my life is a wreck and a ruin, Vance. But I'll stand by  what I've done. I won't give way to the extent of a single scruple.\"    And the long, bitter silence which was to last so many days at the  Cornish ranch began. And still they did not look into one another's eyes.  As for Vance, he did not wish to. He was seeing a bright future. Not long  to wait; after this blow she would go swiftly to her grave.    He had barely reached that conclusion when the door opened again. Terry  stood before them in the old, loose, disreputable clothes of a cow-  puncher. The big sombrero swung in his hand. The heavy Colt dragged down  in its holster over his right hip. His tanned face was drawn and stern.    \"I won't keep you more than a moment,\" he said. \"I'm leaving. And I'm  leaving with nothing of yours. I've already taken too much. If I live to  be a hundred, I'll never forgive myself for taking your charity these  twenty-four years. For what you've spent maybe I can pay you back one of  these days, in money. But for all the time and--patience--you've spent on  me I can never repay you. I know that. At least, here's where I stop  piling up a debt. These clothes and this gun come out of the money I made  punching cows last year. Outside I've got El Sangre saddled with a saddle  I bought out of the same money. They're my start in life, the clothes  I've got on and the gun and the horse and the saddle. So I'm starting  clean--Miss Cornish!\"    Vance saw his sister wince under that name from the lips of Terry. But  she did not speak.    \"There'll be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9932"],[0,"The Last Trail (#16)"],[1,"Sheppard, followed in more leisurely  fashion. At a shout from some one they turned to see a dusty, bloody  figure, with ragged clothes, stagger up from the bluff.    \"There's that blamed sailor now,\" said Sheppard. \"He's a tough nut.  My! What a knock on the head Jonathan gave him. Strikes me, too, that  tomahawk came almost at the right time to save me a whole skin.\"    \"I was furious, but not at all alarmed,\" rejoined Colonel Zane.    \"I wondered what made you so quiet.\"    \"I was waiting. Jonathan never acts until the right moment, and  then--well, you saw him. The little villain deserved killing. I could  have shot him with pleasure. Do you know, Sheppard, Jonathan's  aversion to shedding blood is a singular thing. He'd never kill the  worst kind of a white man until driven to it.\"    \"That's commendable. How about Wetzel?\"    \"Well, Lew is different,\" replied Colonel Zane with a shudder. \"If I  told him to take an ax and clean out Metzar's place--God! what a wreck  he'd make of it. Maybe I'll have to tell him, and if I do, you'll see  something you can never forget.\"          CHAPTER IX    On Sunday morning under the bright, warm sun, the little hamlet of  Fort Henry lay peacefully quiet, as if no storms had ever rolled and  thundered overhead, no roistering ever disturbed its stillness, and no  Indian's yell ever horribly broke the quiet.    \"'Tis a fine morning,\" said Colonel Zane, joining his sister on the  porch. \"Well, how nice you look! All in white for the first time  since--well, you do look charming. You're going to church, of course.\"    \"Yes, I invited Helen and her cousin to go. I've persuaded her to  teach my Sunday-school class, and I'll take another of older  children,\" replied Betty.    \"That's well. The youngsters don't have much chance to learn out here.  But we've made one great stride. A church and a preacher means very  much to young people. Next shall come the village school.\"    \"Helen and I might teach our classes an hour or two every afternoon.\"    \"It would be a grand thing if you did! Fancy these tots growing up  unable to read or write. I hate to think of it; but the Lord knows  I've done my best. I've had my troubles in keeping them alive.\"    \"Helen suggested the day school. She takes the greatest interest in  everything and everybody. Her energy is remarkable. She simply must  move, must do something. She overflows with kindness and sympathy.  Yesterday she cried with happiness when Mabel told her Alex was eager  to be married very soon. I tell you, Eb, Helen is a fine character.\"    \"Yes, good as she is pretty, which is saying some,\" mused the colonel.  \"I wonder who'll be the lucky fellow to win her.\"    \"It's hard to say. Not that Englishman, surely. She hates him.  Jonathan might. You should see her eyes when he is mentioned.\"    \"Say, Betts, you don't mean it?\" eagerly asked her brother.    \"Yes, I do,\" returned Betty, nodding her head positively. \"I'm not  easily deceived about those things. Helen's completely fascinated with  Jack. She might be only a sixteen-year-old girl for the way she  betrays herself to me.\"    \"Betty, I have a beautiful plan.\"    \"No doubt; you're full of them.\"    \"We can do it, Betty, we can, you and I,\" he said, as he squeezed her  arm.    \"My dear old matchmaking brother,\" returned Betty, laughing, \"it takes  two to make a bargain. Jack must be considered.\"    \"Bosh!\" exclaimed the colonel, snapping his fingers. \"You needn't tell  me any young man--any man, could resist that glorious girl.\"    \"Perhaps not; I couldn't if I were a man. But Jack's not like other  people. He'd never realize that she cared for him. Besides, he's a  borderman.\"    \"I know, and that's the only serious obstacle. But he could scout  around the fort, even if he was married. These long, lonely, terrible  journeys taken by him and Wetzel are mostly unnecessary. A sweet wife  could soon make him see that. The border will be civilized in a few  years, and because of that he'd better give over hunting for Indians.  I'd like to see him married and settled down, like all the rest of us,  even Isaac. You know Jack's the last of the Zanes, that is, the old  Zanes. The difficulty arising from his extreme modesty and bashfulness  can easily be overcome.\"    \"How, most wonderful brother?\"    \"Easy as pie. Tell Jack that Helen is dying of love for him, and tell  her that Jack loves----\"    \"But, dear Eb, that latter part is not true,\" interposed Betty.    \"True, of course it's true, or would be in any man who wasn't as blind  as a bat. We'll tell her Jack cares for her; but he is a borderman  with stern ideas of duty, and so slow and backward he'd never tell his  love even if he had overcome his tricks of ranging. That would settle  it with any girl worth her salt, and this one will fetch Jack in ten  days, or less.\"    \"Eb, you're a devil,\" said Betty gaily, and then she added in a more  sober vein, \"I understand, Eb. Your idea is prompted by love of Jack,  and it's all right. I never see him go out of the clearing but I think  it may be for the last time, even as on that day so long ago when  brother Andrew waved his cap to us, and never came back. Jack is the  best man in the world, and I, too, want to see him happy, with a wife,  and babies, and a settled occupation in life. I think we might weave a  pretty little romance. Shall we try?\"    \"Try? We'll do it! Now, Betts, you explain it to both. You can do it  smoother than I, and telling them is really the finest point of our  little plot. I'll help the good work along afterwards. He'll be out  presently. Nail him at once.\"    Jonathan, all unconscious of the deep-laid scheme to make him happy,  soon came out on the porch, and stretched his long arms as he breathed  freely of the morning air.    \"Hello, Jack, where are you bound?\" asked Betty, clasping one of his  powerful, buckskin-clad knees with her arm.    \"I reckon I'll go over to the spring,\" he replied, patting her dark,  glossy head.    \"Do you know I want to tell you something, Jack, and it's quite  serious,\" she said, blushing a little at her guilt; but resolute to  carry out her part of the plot.    \"Well, dear?\" he asked as she hesitated.    \"Do you like Helen?\"    \"That is a question,\" Jonathan replied after a moment.    \"Never mind; tell me,\" she persisted.    He made no answer.    \"Well, Jack, she's--she's wildly in love with you.\"    The borderman stood very still for several moments. Then, with one  step he gained the lawn, and turned to confront her.    \"What's that you say?\"    Betty trembled a little. He spoke so sharply, his eyes were bent on  her so keenly, and he looked so strong, so forceful that she was  almost afraid. But remembering that she had said only what, to her  mind, was absolutely true, she raised her eyes and repeated the words:    \"Helen is wildly'in love with you.\"    \"Betty, you wouldn't joke about such a thing; you wouldn't lie to me,  I know you wouldn't.\"    \"No, Jack dear.\"    She saw his powerful frame tremble, even as she had seen more than one  man tremble, during the siege, under the impact of a bullet.    Without speaking, he walked rapidly down the path toward the spring.    Colonel Zane came out of his hiding-place behind the porch and, with a  face positively electrifying in its glowing pleasure, beamed upon  his sister.    \"Gee! Didn't he stalk off like an Indian chief!\" he said, chuckling  with satisfaction. \"By George! Betts, you must have got in a great  piece of work. I never in my life saw Jack look like that.\"    Colonel Zane sat down by Betty's side and laughed softly but heartily.    \"We'll fix him all right, the lonely hill-climber! Why, he hasn't a  ghost of a chance. Wait until she sees him after hearing your story! I  tell you, Betty--why--damme! you're crying!\"    He had turned to find her head lowered, while she shaded her face with  her hand.    \"Now, Betty, just a little innocent deceit like that--what harm?\" he  said, taking her hand. He was as tender as a woman.    \"Oh, Eb, it wasn't that. I didn't mind telling him. Only the flash in  his eyes reminded me of--of Alfred.\"    \"Surely it did. Why not? Almost everything brings up a tender memory  for some one we've loved and lost. But don't cry, Betty.\"    She laughed a little, and raised a face with its dark cheeks flushed  and tear-stained.    \"I'm silly, I suppose; but I can't help it. I cry at least once every  day.\"    \"Brace up. Here come Helen and Will. Don't let them see you grieved.  My! Helen in pure white, too! This is a conspiracy to ruin the peace  of the masculine portion of Fort Henry.\"    Betty went forward to meet her friends while Colonel Zane continued  talking, but now to himself. \"What a fatal beauty she has!\" His eyes  swept over Helen with the pleasure of an artist. The fair richness of  her skin, the perfect lips, the wavy, shiny hair, the wondrous  dark-blue, changing eyes, the tall figure, slender, but strong and  swelling with gracious womanhood, made a picture he delighted in and  loved to have near him. The girl did not possess for him any of that  magnetism, so commonly felt by most of her admirers; but he did feel  how subtly full she was of something, which for want of a better term  he described in Wetzel's characteristic expression, as \"chain-lightning.\"    He reflected that as he was so much older, that she, although always  winsome and earnest, showed nothing of the tormenting, bewildering  coquetry of her nature. Colonel Zane prided himself on his  discernment, and he had already observed that Helen had different  sides of character for different persons. To Betty, Mabel, Nell, and  the children, she was frank, girlish, full of fun and always lovable;  to her elders quiet and earnestly solicitous to please; to the young  men cold; but with a penetrating, mocking promise haunting that  coldness, and sometimes sweetly agreeable, often wilful, and  changeable as April winds. At last the colonel concluded that she  needed,"]]]
