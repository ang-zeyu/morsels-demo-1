Among the Northwestern regiments there would seem to have been more  than one which carried a living eagle as an added ensign. The bird  commemorated here was, according the the account, borne aloft on a perch  beside the standard; went through successive battles and campaigns; was  more than once under the surgeon's hands; and at the close of the  contest found honorable repose in the capital of Wisconsin, from which  state he had gone to the wars.    13. The late Major General McPherson, commanding the Army of the  Tennessee, a major of Ohio and a West Pointer, was one of the foremost  spirits of the war. Young, though a veteran; hardy, intrepid, sensitive  in honor, full of engaging qualities, with manly beauty; possessed of  genius, a favorite with the army, and with Grant and Sherman. Both  Generals have generously acknowledged their professional obligiations to  the able engineer and admirable soldier, their subordinate and junior.    In an informal account written by the Achilles to this Sarpedon, he  says: \"On that day we avenged his death. Near twenty-two hundred of the  enemy's dead remained on the ground when night closed upon the scene of  action.\"    It is significant of the scale on which the war was waged, that the  engagement thus written of goes solely (so far as can be learned) under  the vague designation of one of the battles before Atlanta.    14. The piece was written while yet the reports were coming North of  Sherman's homeward advance from Savannah. It is needless to point out  its purely dramatic character.    Though the sentiment ascribed in the beginning of the second stanza  must, in the present reading, suggest the historic tragedy of the 14th  of April, nevertheless, as intimated, it was written prior to that  event, and without any distinct application in the writer's mind. After  consideration, it is allowed to remain.    Few need be reminded that, by the less intelligent classes of the South,  Abraham Lincoln, by nature the most kindly of men, was regarded as a  monster wantonly warring upon liberty. He stood for the personification  of tyrannic power. Each Union soldier was called a Lincolnite.    Undoubtedly Sherman, in the desolation he inflicted after leaving  Atlanta, acted not in contravention of orders; and all, in a military  point of view, if by military judged deemed to have been expedient, and  nothing can abate General Sherman's shining renown; his claims to it  rest on no single campaign. Still, there are those who can not but  contrast some of the scenes enacted in Georgia and the Carolinas, and  also in the Shenandoah, with a circumstance in a great Civil War of  heathen antiquity. Plutarch relates that in a military council held by  Pompey and the chiefs of that party which stood for the Commonwealth, it  was decided that under no plea should any city be sacked that was  subject to the people of Rome. There was this difference, however,  between the Roman civil conflict and the American one. The war of Pompey  and Caesar divided the Roman people promiscuously; that of the North and  South ran a frontier line between what for the time were distinct  communities or nations. In this circumstance, possibly, and some others,  may be found both the cause and the justification of some of the  sweeping measures adopted.    15. At this period of excitement the thought was by some passionately  welcomed that the Presidential successor had been raised up by heaven to  wreak vengeance on the South. The idea originated in the remembrance  that Andrew Johnson by birth belonged to that class of Southern whites  who never cherished love for the dominant: that he was a citizen of  Tennessee, where the contest at times and in places had been close and  bitter as a Middle-Age feud; the himself and family had been hardly  treated by the Secessionists.    But the expectations build hereon (if, indeed, ever soberly  entertained), happily for the country, have not been verified.    Likely the feeling which would have held the entire South chargeable  with the crime of one exceptional assassin, this too has died away with  the natural excitement of the hour.    16. The incident on which this piece is based is narrated in a newspaper  account of the battle to be found in the \"Rebellion Record.\" During the  disaster to the national forces on the first day, a brigade on the  extreme left found itself isolated. The perils it encountered are given  in detail. Among others, the following sentences occur:    \"Under cover of the fire from the bluffs, the rebels rushed down,  crossed the ford, and in a moment were seen forming this side the creek  in open fields, and within close musket-range. Their color-bearers  stepped defiantly to the front as the engagement opened furiously; the  rebels pouring in sharp, quick volleys of musketry, and their batteries  above continuing to support them with a destructive fire. Our  sharpshooters wanted to pick off the audacious rebel color-bearers, but  Colonel Stuart interposed: 'No, no, they're too brave fellows to be  killed.'\"    17. According to a report of the Secretary of War, there were on the  first day of March, 1865, 965,000 men on the army pay-rolls. Of these,  some 200,000--artillery, cavalry, and infantry--made up from the larger  portion of the veterans of Grant and Sherman, marched by the President.  The total number of Union troops enlisted during the war was 2,668,000.    18. For a month or two after the completion of peace, some thousands of  released captives from the military prisons of the North, natives of all  parts of the South, passed through the city of New York, sometimes  waiting farther transportation for days, during which interval they  wandered penniless about the streets, or lay in their worn and patched  gray uniforms under the trees of Battery, near the barracks where they  were lodged and fed. They were transported and provided for at the  charge of government.    19. Shortly prior to the evacuation of Petersburg, the enemy, with a  view to ultimate repossession, interred some of his heavy guns in the  same field with his dead, and with every circumstance calculated to  deceive. Subsequently the negroes exposed the stratagem.    20. The records of Northern colleges attest what numbers of our noblest  youth went from them to the battle-field. Southern members of the same  classes arrayed themselves on the side of Secession; while Southern  seminaries contributed large quotas. Of all these, what numbers marched  who never returned except on the shield.    21. Written prior to the founding of the National Cemetery at  Andersonville, where 15,000 of the reinterred captives now sleep, each  beneath his personal head-board, inscribed from records found in the  prison-hospital. Some hundreds rest apart and without name. A glance at  the published pamphlet containing the list of the buried at  Andersonville conveys a feeling mournfully impressive. Seventy-four  large double-columned page in fine print. Looking through them is like  getting lost among the old turbaned head-stones and cypresses in the  interminable Black Forest of Scutari, over against Constantinople.    22. In one of Kilpatrick's earlier cavalry fights near Aldie, a Colonel  who, being under arrest, had been temporarily deprived of his sword,  nevertheless, unarmed, insisted upon charging at the head of his men,  which he did, and the onset proved victorious.    23. Certain of Mosby's followers, on the charge of being unlicensed  foragers or fighters, being hung by order of a Union cavalry commander,  the Partisan promptly retaliated in the woods. In turn, this also was  retaliated, it is said. To what extent such deplorable proceedings were  carried, it is not easy to learn.    South of the Potamac in Virginia, and within a gallop of the Long Bridge  at Washington, is the confine of a country, in some places wild, which  throughout the war it was unsafe for a Union man to traverse except with  an armed escort. This was the chase of Mosby, the scene of many of his  exploits or those of his men. In the heart of this region at least one  fortified camp was maintained by our cavalry, and from time to time  expeditions ended disastrously. Such results were helped by the  exceeding cunning of the enemy, born of his wood-craft, and, in some  instances, by undue confidence on the part of our men. A body of  cavalry, starting from camp with the view of breaking up a nest of  rangers, and absent say three days, would return with a number of their  own forces killed and wounded (ambushed), without being able to  retaliate farther than by foraging on the country, destroying a house or  two reported to be haunts of the guerrillas, or capturing non-combatants  accused of being secretly active in their behalf.    In the verse the name of Mosby is invested with some of those  associations with which the popular mind is familiar. But facts do not  warrant the belief that every clandestine attack of men who passed for  Mosby's was made under his eye or even by his knowledge.    In partisan warfare he proved himself shrewd, able, and enterprising,  and always a wary fighter. He stood well in the confidence of his  superior officers, and was empoyed by them at times in furtherance of  important movements. To our wounded on more than one occasion he showed  considerate kindness. Officers and civilians captured by forces under  his immediate command were, so long as remaining under his orders,  treated with civility. These things are well known to those personally  familiar with the irregular fighting in Virginia.    24. Among those summoned during the spring just passed to appear before  the Reconstruction Committee of Congress was Robert E. Lee. His  testimony is deeply interesting, both in itself and as coming from him.  After various questions had been put and briefly answered, these words  were addressed to him:    \"If there be any other matter about "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1239"],[0,"The Spirit of the Border: A Romance of the Early Settlers in the Ohio Valley (#17)"],[1,"Indian.    \"Mr. Wells, welcome to the Village of Peace!\" exclaimed Mr.  Zeisberger, wringing the old missionary's hand. \"The years have not  been so long but that I remember you.\"    \"Happy, indeed, am I to get here, after all these dark, dangerous  journeys,\" returned Mr. Wells. \"I have brought my nieces, Nell and  Kate, who were children when you left Williamsburg, and this young  man, James Downs, a minister of God, and earnest in his hope for our  work.\"    \"A glorious work it is! Welcome, young ladies, to our peaceful  village. And, young man, I greet you with heartfelt thankfulness. We  need young men. Come in, all of your, and share my cabin. I'll have  your luggage brought up. I have lived in this hut alone. With some  little labor, and the magic touch women bring to the making of a  home, we can be most comfortable here.\"    Mr. Zeisberger gave his own room to the girls, assuring them with a  smile that it was the most luxurious in the village. The apartment  contained a chair, a table, and a bed of Indian blankets and buffalo  robes. A few pegs driven in the chinks between the logs completed  the furnishings. Sparse as were the comforts, they appealed warmly  to the girls, who, weary from their voyage, lay down to rest.    \"I am not fatigued,\" said Mr. Wells, to his old friend. \"I want to  hear all about your work, what you have done, and what you hope to  do.\"    \"We have met with wonderful success, far beyond our wildest dreams,\"  responded Mr. Zeisberger. \"Certainly we have been blessed of God.\"    Then the missionary began a long, detailed account of the Moravian  Mission's efforts among the western tribes. The work lay chiefly  among the Delawares, a noble nation of redmen, intelligent, and  wonderfully susceptible to the teaching of the gospel. Among the  eastern Delawares, living on the other side of the Allegheny  Mountains, the missionaries had succeeded in converting many; and it  was chiefly through the western explorations of Frederick Post that  his Church decided the Indians of the west could as well be taught  to lead Christian lives. The first attempt to convert the western  redmen took place upon the upper Allegheny, where many Indians,  including Allemewi, a blind Delaware chief, accepted the faith. The  mission decided, however, it would be best to move farther west,  where the Delawares had migrated and were more numerous.    In April, 1770, more than ten years before, sixteen canoes, filled  with converted Indians and missionaries, drifted down the Allegheny  to Fort Pitt; thence down the Ohio to the Big Beaver; up that stream  and far into the Ohio wilderness.    Upon a tributary of the Muskingong, called the Tuscarwawas, a  settlement was founded. Near and far the news was circulated. Redmen  from all tribes came flocking to the new colony. Chiefs and  warriors, squaws and maidens, were attracted by the new doctrine of  the converted Indians. They were astonished at the missionaries'  teachings. Many doubted, some were converted, all listened. Great  excitement prevailed when old Glickhican, one of the wisest chiefs  of the Turtle tribe of the Delawares, became a convert to the  palefaces' religion.    The interest widened, and in a few years a beautiful, prosperous  town arose, which was called Village of Peace. The Indians of the  warlike tribes bestowed the appropriate name. The vast forests were  rich in every variety of game; the deep, swift streams were teeming  with fish. Meat and grain in abundance, buckskin for clothing, and  soft furs for winter garments were to be had for little labor. At  first only a few wigwams were erected. Soon a large log structure  was thrown up and used as a church. Then followed a school, a mill,  and a workshop. The verdant fields were cultivated and surrounded by  rail fences. Horses and cattle grazed with the timid deer on the  grassy plains.    The Village of Peace blossomed as a rose. The reports of the love  and happiness existing in this converted community spread from mouth  to mouth, from town to town, with the result that inquisitive  savages journeyed from all points to see this haven. Peaceful and  hostile Indians were alike amazed at the change in their brethren.  The good-fellowship and industry of the converts had a widespread  and wonderful influence. More, perhaps, than any other thing, the  great fields of waving corn, the hills covered with horses and  cattle, those evidences of abundance, impressed the visitors with  the well-being of the Christians. Bands of traveling Indians,  whether friendly or otherwise, were treated with hospitality, and  never sent away empty-handed. They were asked to partake of the  abundance and solicited to come again.    A feature by no means insignificant in the popularity of the village  was the church bell. The Indians loved music, and this bell charmed  them. On still nights the savages in distant towns could hear at  dusk the deep-toned, mellow notes of the bell summoning the  worshipers to the evening service. Its ringing clang, so strange, so  sweet, so solemn, breaking the vast dead wilderness quiet, haunted  the savage ear as though it were a call from a woodland god.    \"You have arrived most opportunely,\" continued Mr. Zeisberger. \"Mr.  Edwards and Mr. Young are working to establish other missionary  posts. Heckewelder is here now in the interest of this branching  out.\"    \"How long will it take me to learn the Delaware language?\" inquired  Jim.    \"Not long. You do not, however, need to speak the Indian tongue, for  we have excellent interpreters.\"    \"We heard much at Fort Pitt and Fort Henry about the danger, as well  as uselessness, of our venture,\" Jim continued. \"The frontiersmen  declared that every rod of the way was beset with savage foes, and  that, even in the unlikely event of our arriving safely at the  Village of Peace, we would then be hemmed in by fierce, vengeful  tribes.\"    \"Hostile savages abound here, of course; but we do not fear them. We  invite them. Our work is to convert the wicked, to teach them to  lead good, useful lives. We will succeed.\"    Jim could not help warming to the minister for his unswervable  faith, his earnest belief that the work of God could not fail;  nevertheless, while he felt no fear and intended to put all his  heart in the work, he remembered with disquietude Colonel Zane's  warnings. He thought of the wonderful precaution and eternal  vigilance of Jonathan and Wetzel--men of all men who most understood  Indian craft and cunning. It might well be possible that these good  missionaries, wrapped up in saving the souls of these children of  the forest, so full of God's teachings as to have little mind for  aught else, had no knowledge of the Indian nature beyond what the  narrow scope of their work invited. If what these frontiersmen  asserted was true, then the ministers' zeal had struck them blind.    Jim had a growing idea of the way in which the savages could be best  taught. He resolved to go slowly; to study the redmen's natures; not  to preach one word of the gospel to them until he had mastered their  language and could convey to their simple minds the real truth. He  would make Christianity as clear to them as were the deer-trails on  the moss and leaves of the forest.    \"Ah, here you are. I hope you have rested well,\" said Mr.  Zeisberger, when at the conclusion of this long recital Nell and  Kate came into the room.    \"Thank you, we feel much better,\" answered Kate. The girls certainly  looked refreshed. The substitution of clean gowns for their former  travel-stained garments made a change that called forth the  minister's surprise and admiration.    \"My! My! Won't Edwards and Young beg me to keep them here now!\" he  exclaimed, his pleased eyes resting on Nell's piquant beauty and  Kate's noble proportions and rich coloring. \"Come; I will show you  over the Village of Peace.\"    \"Are all these Indians Christians?\" asked Jim.    \"No, indeed. These Indians you see here, and out yonder under the  shade, though they are friendly, are not Christians. Our converts  employ themselves in the fields or shops. Come; take a peep in here.  This is where we preach in the evenings and during inclement  weather. On pleasant days we use the maple grove yonder.\"    Jim and the others looked in at the door of the large log structure.  They saw an immense room, the floor covered with benches, and a  raised platform at one end. A few windows let in the light. Spacious  and barn-like was this apartment; but undoubtedly, seen through the  beaming eyes of the missionary, it was a grand amphitheater for  worship. The hard-packed clay floor was velvet carpet; the rude  seats soft as eiderdown; the platform with its white-oak cross, an  altar of marble and gold.    \"This is one of our shops,\" said Mr. Zeisberger, leading them to a  cabin. \"Here we make brooms, harness for the horses, farming  implements--everything useful that we can. We have a forge here.  Behold an Indian blacksmith!\"    The interior of the large cabin presented a scene of bustling  activity. Twenty or more Indians bent their backs in earnest  employment. In one corner a savage stood holding a piece of red-hot  iron on an anvil, while a brawny brave wielded a sledge-hammer. The  sparks flew; the anvil rang. In another corner a circle of braves  sat around a pile of dried grass and flags. They were twisting and  fashioning these materials into baskets. At a bench three Indian  carpenters were pounding and sawing. Young braves ran back and  forth, carrying pails, rough-hewn boards and blocks of wood.    Instantly struck by two things, Jim voiced his curiosity:    \"Why do these Indians all wear long hair, smooth and shiny, without  adornment?\"    \"They are Christians. They wear neither headdress, war-bonnet, nor  scalp-lock,\" replied Mr. Zeisberger, with unconscious pride.    \"I did not expect to see a blacksmith's anvil out here in the  wilderness. Where did you procure these"]]]
