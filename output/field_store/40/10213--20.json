[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13486"],[0,"The Story of Sigurd the Volsung (#17)"],[1," was sinking fair:    A wide plain lay beneath him, and a river through it wound    Betwixt the lea and the acres, and the misty orchard ground;    But forth from the feet of the mountains a ridged hill there ran    That upreared at its hithermost ending a builded burg of man;    And Sigurd deemed in his heart as he looked on the burg from afar,    That the high Gods scarce might win it, if thereon they fell with war;    So many and great were the walls, so bore the towers on high    The threat of guarded battle, and the tale of victory.           *       *       *       *       *      For as waves on the iron river of the days whereof nothing is told    Stood up the many towers, so stark and sharp and cold;    But dark-red and worn and ancient as the midmost mountain-sides    Is the wall that goeth about them; and its mighty compass hides    Full many a dwelling of man whence the reek now goeth aloft,    And the voice of the house-abiders, the sharp sounds blent with the soft:    But one house in the midst is unhidden and high up o'er the wall it goes;    Aloft in the wind of the mountains its golden roof-ridge glows,    And down mid its buttressed feet is the wind's voice never still;    And the day and the night pass o'er it and it changes to their will,    And whiles is it glassy and dark, and whiles is it white and dead,    And whiles is it grey as the sea-mead, and whiles is it angry red;    And it shimmers under the sunshine and grows black to the threat of the         storm,    And dusk its gold roof glimmers when the rain-clouds over it swarm,    And bright in the first of the morning its flame doth it uplift,    When the light clouds rend before it and along its furrows drift.    Then Sigurd's heart was glad as he beheld the city, and after a while  he came to a gate-way set in the northern wall, and the gate was long  and dark as a sea-cave. But no man stayed him as he rode through the  dusk to the inner court-yard, and saw the lofty roof of the hall  before him, cold now and grey like a very cloud, for the sun was  fully set. But in the towers watch-men were calling one to another.  To them he cried, saying:--      \"Ho, men of this mighty burg, to what folk of the world am I come?    And who is the King of battles who dwells in this lordly home?    Or perchance are ye of the Elf-kin? are ye guest-fain, kind at the board,    Or murder-churls and destroyers to gain and die by the sword?\"    Then the spears in the forecourt glittered and the swords shone over the         wall,    But the song of smitten harp-strings came faint from the cloudy hall.    And he hearkened a voice and a crying: \"The house of Giuki the King,    And the Burg of the Niblung people and the heart of their warfaring.\"    There were many men about him, and the wind in the wall-nook sang,    And the spears of the Niblungs glittered, and the swords in the forecourt         rang.    But they looked on his face in the even, and they hushed their voices and         gazed,    For fear and great desire the hearts of men amazed.      Now cometh an earl to King Giuki as he sits in godlike wise    With his sons, the Kings of battle, and his wife of the glittering eyes,    And the King cries out at his coming to tell why the watch-horns blew;    But the earl saith: \"Lord of the people, choose now what thou wilt do;    For here is a strange new-comer, and he saith, to thee alone    Will he tell of his name and his kindred, and the deeds that his hand hath         done.\"           *       *       *       *       *      Then uprose the King of the Niblungs, and was clad in purple and pall,    And his sheathed sword lay in his hand, as he gat him adown the hall,    And abroad through the Niblung doorway; and a mighty man he was,    And wise and ancient of days: so there by the earls doth he pass,    And beholdeth the King on the war-steed and looketh up in his face:    But Sigurd smileth upon him in the Niblungs' fenced place,    As the King saith: \"Gold-bestrider, who into our garth wouldst ride,    Wilt thou tell thy name to a King, who biddeth thee here abide    And have all good at our hands? for unto the Niblungs' home    And the heart of a war-fain people from the weary road are ye come;    And I am Giuki the King: so now if thou nam'st thee a God,    Look not to see me tremble; for I know of such that have trod    Unfeared in the Burg of the Niblungs; nor worser, nor better at all    May fare the folk of the Gods than the Kings in Giuki's hall;    So I bid thee abide in my house, and when many days are o'er,    Thou shalt tell us at last of thine errand, if thou bear us peace or war.\"      Then all rejoiced at his word till the swords on the bucklers rang,    And adown from the red-gold Treasure the Son of Sigmund sprang,    And he took the hand of Giuki, and kissed him soft and sweet,    And spake: \"Hail, ancient of days! for thou biddest me things most meet,    And thou knowest the good from the evil: few days are over and gone    Since my father was old in the world ere the deed of my making was won;    But Sigmund the Volsung he was, full ripe of years and of fame;    And I, who have never beheld him, am Sigurd called of name;    Too young in the world am I waxen that a tale thereof should be told,    And yet have I slain the Serpent, and gotten the Ancient Gold,    And broken the bonds of the weary, and ridden the Wavering Fire.    But short is mine errand to tell, and the end of my desire:    For peace I bear unto thee, and to all the kings of the earth,    Who bear the sword aright, and are crowned with the crown of worth;    But unpeace to the lords of evil, and the battle and the death;    And the edge of the sword to the traitor, and the flame to the slanderous         breath:    And I would that the loving were loved, and I would that the weary should         sleep,    And that man should hearken to man, and that he that soweth should reap.    Now wide in the world would I fare, to seek the dwellings of Kings,    For with them would I do and undo, and be heart of their warfarings;    So I thank thee, lord, for thy bidding, and here in thine house will I bide,    And learn of thine ancient wisdom till forth to the field we ride.\"      Glad then was the murmur of folk, for the tidings had gone forth,    And its breath had been borne to the Niblungs, and the tale of Sigurd's         worth.      But the King said: \"Welcome, Sigurd, full fair of deed and of word!    And here mayst thou win thee fellows for the days of the peace and the         sword;    For not lone in the world have I lived, but sons from my loins have sprung,    Whose deeds with the rhyme are mingled, and their names with the people's         tongue.\"      Then he took his hand in his hand, and into the hall they passed,    And great shouts of salutation to the cloudy roof were cast;    And they rang from the glassy pillars, and the Gods on the hangings stirred,    And afar the clustering eagles on the golden roof-ridge heard,    And cried out on the Sword of the Branstock as they cried in the other days:    Then the harps rang out in the hall, and men sang in Sigurd's praise           *       *       *       *       *      But now on the dais he meeteth the kin of Giuki the wise:    Lo, here is the crowned Grimhild, the queen of the glittering eyes;    Lo, here is the goodly Gunnar with the face of a king's desire;    Lo, here is Hogni that holdeth the wisdom tried in the fire;    Lo, here is Guttorm the youngest, who longs for the meeting swords;    Lo, here, as a rose in the oak-boughs, amid the Niblung lords    Is the Maid of the Niblungs standing, the white-armed Giuki's child;    And all these looked long on Sigurd and their hearts upon him smiled.    Then all gave him greeting as one who should be their fellow in mighty  deeds, and the fair-armed Gudrun, Giuki's daughter, brought him a cup  of welcome, and that night the Niblungs feasted in gladness of heart.      _Of Sigurd's warfaring in the company of the Niblungs, and of his great  fame and glory._    So Sigurd abode with the Niblungs all through summer and harvest time  till with the stark midwinter came tidings of war. Then the earls of  Giuki donned dusky hauberks and led forth their bands from the  fortress, and the fair face and golden gear of Sigurd shone among  those swart-haired warriors.    They fell on the cities of the plains, but none might resist the  valour of Sigurd, and the Niblungs turned in triumph from the war,  bringing rich spoil. So all that winter Sigurd fared to war with them  and grew greater in glory and more beloved of all men, but ever the  thoughts of his heart turned to Lymdale and to Brynhild who awaited  him there.      Now sheathed is the Wrath of Sigurd; for as wax withstands the flame,    So the Kings of the land withstood him and the glory of his fame.    And before the grass is growing, or the kine have fared from the stall,    The song of the fair-speech-masters goes up in the Niblung hall,    And they sing of the golden Sigurd and the face without a foe,    And the lowly man exalted and the mighty brought alow:    And they say, when the sun of summer shall come aback to the land,    It shall shine on the fields of the tiller that fears no heavy hand;    That the sheaf shall be for the plougher, and the loaf for him that sowed,    Through every furrowed acre where the son of Sigmund rode.      Full dear was Sigurd the Volsung to all men most and least,    And now, as the spring drew onward, 'twas deemed a goodly feast    For the acre-biders' children by the Niblung Burg to wait,    If perchance the Son of Sigmund should ride abroad by the gate:    For whosoever feared him, no little-one, forsooth,    Would shrink from the shining eyes and the hand that clave out truth    From the heart of the wrack and the battle: it was then, as his gold gear         burned    O'er the balks of the bridge and the river, that oft the mother turned,    And spake to the laughing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13493"],[0,"The American Frugal Housewife (#17)"],[1,"in after you take  your coffee-pot off the fire, will _usually_ settle the coffee.    If you have not cream for coffee, it is a very great improvement to  boil your milk, and use it while hot.      CHOCOLATE.    Many people boil chocolate in a coffee-pot; but I think it is better  to boil it in a skillet, or something open. A piece of chocolate about  as big as a dollar is the usual quantity for a quart of water; but  some put in more, and some less. When it boils, pour in as much milk  as you like and let them boil together three or four minutes. It is  much richer with the milk boiled in it. Put the sugar in either before  or after, as you please. Nutmeg improves it. The chocolate should be  scraped fine before it is put into the water.      TEA.    Young Hyson is supposed to be a more profitable tea than Hyson;  but though the _quantity_ to a pound is greater, it has not so  much _strength_. In point of economy, therefore, there is not much  difference between them. Hyson tea and Souchong mixed together, half  and half, is a pleasant beverage, and is more healthy than green  tea alone. Be sure that water boils before it is poured upon tea. A  tea-spoonful to each person, and one extra thrown in, is a good rule.  Steep ten or fifteen minutes.      PICKLES.    Musk-melons should be picked for mangoes, when they are green and  hard. They should be cut open after they have been in salt water ten  days, the inside scraped out clean, and filled with mustard-seed,  allspice, horseradish, small onions, &c., and sewed up again. Scalding  vinegar poured upon them.    When walnuts are so ripe that a pin will go into them easily, they are  ready for pickling. They should be soaked twelve days in very strong  cold salt and water, which has been boiled and skimmed. A quantity  of vinegar, enough to cover them well, should be boiled with whole  pepper, mustard-seed, small onions, or garlic, cloves, ginger, and  horseradish; this should not be poured upon them till it is cold. They  should be pickled a few months before they are eaten. To be kept close  covered; for the air softens them. The liquor is an excellent catsup  to be eaten on fish.    Put peppers into strong salt and water, until they become yellow;  then turn them green by keeping them in warm salt and water, shifting  them every two days. Then drain them, and pour scalding vinegar over  them. A bag of mustard-seed is an improvement. If there is mother in  vinegar, scald and strain it.    Cucumbers should be in weak brine three or four days after they are  picked; then they should be put in a tin or wooden pail of clean  water, and kept slightly warm in the kitchen corner for two or  three days. Then take as much vinegar as you think your pickle jar  will hold; scald it with pepper, allspice, mustard-seed, flag-root,  horseradish, &c., if you happen to have them; half of them will spice  the pickles very well. Throw in a bit of alum as big as a walnut;  this serves to make pickles hard. Skim the vinegar clean, and pour  it scalding hot upon the cucumbers. Brass vessels are not healthy  for preparing anything acid. Red cabbages need no other pickling than  scalding, spiced vinegar poured upon them, and suffered to remain  eight or ten days before you eat them. Some people think it improves  them to keep them in salt and water twenty-four hours before they are  pickled.    If you find your pickles soft and insipid, it is owing to the weakness  of the vinegar. Throw away the vinegar, (or keep it to clean your  brass kettles,) then cover your pickles with strong, scalding vinegar,  into which a little allspice, ginger, horseradish and alum have been  thrown. By no means omit a pretty large bit of alum. Pickles attended  to in this way, will keep for years, and be better and better every  year.    Some people prefer pickled nasturtion-seed to capers. They should  be kept several days after they are gathered, and then covered with  boiling vinegar, and bottled when cold. They are not fit to be eaten  for some months.    Martinoes are prepared in nearly the same way as other pickles. The  salt and water in which they are put, two or three days previous to  pickling, should be changed every day; because martinoes are very  apt to become soft. No spice should be used but allspice, cloves,  and cinnamon. The martinoes and the spice should be scalded _in_ the  vinegar, instead of pouring the vinegar _over_ the martinoes.      BEER.    Beer is a good family drink. A handful of hops, to a pailful of  water, and a half-pint of molasses, makes good hop beer. Spruce mixed  with hops is pleasanter than hops alone. Boxberry, fever-bush, sweet  fern, and horseradish make a good and healthy diet-drink. The winter  evergreen, or rheumatism weed, thrown in, is very beneficial to  humors. Be careful and not mistake kill-lamb for winter-evergreen;  they resemble each other. Malt mixed with a few hops makes a weak kind  of beer; but it is cool and pleasant; it needs less molasses than hops  alone. The rule is about the same for all beer. Boil the ingredients  two or three hours, pour in a half-pint of molasses to a pailful,  while the beer is scalding hot. Strain the beer, and when about  lukewarm, put a pint of lively yeast to a barrel. Leave the bung loose  till the beer is done working; you can ascertain this by observing  when the froth subsides. If your family be large, and the beer will be  drank rapidly, it may as well remain in the barrel; but if your family  be small, fill what bottles you have with it; it keeps better bottled.  A raw potato or two, cut up and thrown in, while the ingredients are  boiling, is said to make beer spirited.    Ginger beer is made in the following proportions:--One cup of ginger,  one pint of molasses, one pail and a half of water, and a cup of  lively yeast. Most people scald the ginger in half a pail of water,  and then fill it up with a pailful of cold; but in very hot weather  some people stir it up cold. Yeast must not be put in till it is cold,  or nearly cold. If not to be drank within twenty-four hours, it must  be bottled as soon as it works.    Table beer should be drawn off into _stone_ jugs, with a lump of  white sugar in each, securely corked. It is brisk and pleasant, and  continues good several months.    Potato cheese is much sought after in various parts of Europe. I do  not know whether it is worth seeking after, or not. The following is  the receipt for making:--Select good white potatoes, boil them, and,  when cold, peel and reduce them to a pulp with a rasp or mortar; to  five pounds of this pulp, which must be very uniform and homogeneous,  add a pint of sour milk and the requisite portion of salt; knead the  whole well, cover it, and let it remain three or four days, according  to the season; then knead it afresh, and place the cheeses in small  baskets, when they will part with their superfluous moisture; dry them  in the shade, and place them in layers in large pots or kegs, where  they may remain a fortnight. The older they are, the finer they  become.    This cheese has the advantage of never engendering worms, and of being  preserved fresh for many years, provided it is kept in a dry place,  and in well closed vessels.           *       *       *       *       *          GENERAL MAXIMS FOR HEALTH.      Rise early. Eat simple food. Take plenty of exercise. Never fear a  little fatigue. Let not children be dressed in tight clothes; it is  necessary their limbs and muscles should have full play, if you wish  for either health or beauty.    Avoid the necessity of a physician, if you can, by careful attention  to your diet. Eat what best agrees with your system, and resolutely  abstain from what hurts you, however well you may like it. A few days'  abstinence, and cold water for a beverage, has driven off many an  approaching disease.    If you find yourself really ill, send for a good physician. Have  nothing to do with quacks; and do not tamper with quack medicines. You  do not know what they are; and what security have you that they know  what they are?    Wear shoes that are large enough. It not only produces corns, but  makes the feet misshapen, to cramp them.    Wash very often, and rub the skin thoroughly with a hard brush.    Let those who love to be invalids drink strong green tea, eat pickles,  preserves, and rich pastry. As far as possible, eat and sleep at  regular hours.    Wash the eyes thoroughly in cold water every morning. Do not read or  sew at twilight, or by too dazzling a light. If far-sighted, read with  rather less light, and with the book somewhat nearer to the eye, than  you desire. If nearsighted, read with a book as far off as possible.  Both these imperfections may be diminished in this way.    Clean teeth in pure water two or three times a day; but, above all, be  sure to have them clean before you go to bed.    Have your bed-chamber well aired; and have fresh bed linen every week.  Never have the wind blowing directly upon you from open windows during  the night. It is _not_ healthy to sleep in heated rooms.    Let children have their bread and milk before they have been long up.  Cold water and a run in the fresh air before breakfast.    Too frequent use of an ivory comb injures the hair. Thorough combing,  washing in suds, or N.E. rum, and thorough brushing, will keep it  in order; and the washing does not injure the hair, as is generally  supposed. Keep children's hair cut close until ten or twelve years  old; it is better for health and the beauty of the hair. Do not sleep  with hair frizzled, or braided. Do not make children cross-eyed, by  having hair hang about their foreheads, where they see it continually.           *       *       *       *       *          HINTS TO PERSONS OF MODERATE FORTUNE    [FIRST PUBLISHED IN THE MASSACHUSETTS JOURNAL.]           *       *       *       *       *    When clouds are seen, wise men put on their cloaks.--SHAKSPEARE.           *       *       * "]]]
