August and his two sons were close behind, and blocked the gate.  Silvermane's race was nearly run.    \"Hold here, boys,\" said August. \"I'll go in and drive him round and  round till he's done, then, when I yell, you stand aside and rope him as  he comes out.\"    Silvermane ran round the corral, tore at the steep scaly walls, fell  back and began his weary round again and yet again. Then as sense and  courage yielded gradually to unreasoning terror, he ran blindly; every  time he passed the guarded gateway his eyes were wilder, and his stride  more labored.    \"Now!\" yelled August Naab.    Mescal drew out of the opening, and Dave and Billy pulled away, one on  each side, their lassoes swinging loosely.    Silvermane sprang for the opening with something of his old speed. As he  went through, yellow loops flashed in the sun, circling, narrowing, and  he seemed to run straight into them. One loop whipped close round his  glossy neck; the other caught his head. Dave's mustang staggered under  the violent shock, went to his knees, struggled up and held firmly.  Bill's mount slid on his haunches and spilled his rider from the saddle.  Silvermane seemed to be climbing into the air. Then August Naab, darting  through the gate in a cloud of dust, shot his lasso, catching the right  foreleg. Silvermane landed hard, his hoofs striking fire from the  stones; and for an instant strained in convulsive struggle; then fell  heaving and groaning. In a twinkling Billy loosened his lasso over a  knot, making of it a halter, and tied the end to a cedar stump.    The Naabs stood back and gazed at their prize.    Silvermane was badly spent; he was wet with foam, but no fleck of blood  marred his mane; his superb coat showed scratches, but none cut into the  flesh. After a while he rose, panting heavily, and trembling in every  muscle. He was a beaten horse; the noble head was bowed; yet he showed  no viciousness, only the fear of a trapped animal. He eyed Black Bolly  and then the halter, as though he had divined the fatal connection  between them.          VIII. THE BREAKER OF WILD MUSTANGS    FOR a few days after the capture of Silvermane, a time full to the brim  of excitement for Hare, he had no word with Mescal, save for morning and  evening greetings. When he did come to seek her, with a purpose which  had grown more impelling since August Naab's arrival, he learned to his  bewilderment that she avoided him. She gave him no chance to speak with  her alone; her accustomed resting-place on the rim at sunset knew her no  more; early after supper she retired to her tent.    Hare nursed a grievance for forty-eight hours, and then, taking  advantage of Piute's absence on an errand down to the farm, and of the  Naabs' strenuous day with four vicious wild horses in the corral at one  time, he walked out to the pasture where Mescal shepherded the flock.    \"Mescal, why are you avoiding me?\" he asked. \"What has happened?\"    She looked tired and unhappy, and her gaze, instead of meeting his,  wandered to the crags.    \"Nothing,\" she replied.    \"But there must be something. You have given me no chance to talk to  you, and I wanted to know if you'd let me speak to Father Naab.\"    \"To Father Naab? Why--what about?\"    \"About you, of course--and me--that I love you and want to marry you.\"    She turned white. \"No--no!\"    Hare paused blankly, not so much at her refusal as at the unmistakable  fear in her face.    \"Why--not?\" he asked presently, with an odd sense of trouble. There was  more here than Mescal's habitual shyness.    \"Because he'll be terribly angry.\"    \"Angry--I don't understand. Why angry?\"    The girl did not answer, and looked so forlorn that Hare attempted to  take her in his arms. She resisted and broke from him.    \"You must never--never do that again.\"    Hare drew back sharply.    \"Why not? What's wrong? You must tell me, Mescal.\"    \"I remembered.\" She hung her head.    \"Remembered--what?\"    \"I am pledged to marry Father Naab's eldest son.\"    For a moment Hare did not understand. He stared at her unbelievingly.    \"What did you say?\" he asked, slowly.    Mescal repeated her words in a whisper.    \"But--but Mescal--I love you. You let me kiss you,\" said Hare stupidly,  as if he did not grasp her meaning. \"You let me kiss you,\" he repeated.    \"Oh, Jack, I forgot,\" she wailed. \"It was so new, so strange, to have  you up here. It was like a kind of dream. And after--after you kissed me  I--I found out--\"    \"What, Mescal?\"    Her silence answered him.    \"But, Mescal, if you really love me you can't marry any one else,\" said  Hare. It was the simple persistence of a simple swain.    \"Oh, you don't know, you don't know. It's impossible!\"    \"Impossible!\" Hare's anger flared up. \"You let me believe I had won you.  What kind of a girl are you? You were not true. Your actions were lies.\"    \"Not lies,\" she faltered, and turned her face from him.    With no gentle hand he grasped her arm and forced her to look at him.  But the misery in her eyes overcame him, and he roughly threw his arms  around her and held her close.    \"It can't be a lie. You do care for me--love me. Look at me.\" He drew  her head back from his breast. Her face was pale and drawn; her eyes  closed tight, with tears forcing a way out under the long lashes; her  lips were parted. He bowed to their sweet nearness; he kissed them again  and again, while the shade of the cedars seemed to whirl about him. \"I  love you, Mescal. You are mine--I will have you--I will keep you--I will  not let him have you!\"    She vibrated to that like a keen strung wire under a strong touch. All  in a flash the trembling, shame-stricken girl was transformed. She  leaned back in his arms, supple, pliant with quivering life, and for the  first time gave him wide-open level eyes, in which there were now no  tears, no shyness, no fear, but a dark smouldering fire.    \"You do love me, Mescal?\"    \"I--I couldn't help it.\"    There was a pause, tense with feeling.    \"Mescal, tell me--about your being pledged,\" he said, at last.    \"I gave him my promise because there was nothing else to do. I was  pledged to--to him in the church at White Sage. It can't be changed.  I've got to marry--Father Naab's eldest son.\"    \"Eldest son?\" echoed Jack, suddenly mindful of the implication. \"Why!  that's Snap Naab. Ah! I begin to see light. That--Mescal--\"    \"I hate him.\"    \"You hate him and you're pledged to marry him!... God! Mescal, I'd  utterly forgotten Snap Naab already has a wife.\"    \"You've also forgotten that we're Mormons.\"    \"Are you a Mormon?\" he queried bluntly.    \"I've been raised as one.\"    \"That's not an answer. Are you one? Do you believe any man under God's  sky ought to have more than one wife at a time?\"    \"No. But I've been taught that it gave woman greater glory in heaven.  There have been men here before you, men who talked to me, and I doubted  before I ever saw you. And afterward--I knew.\"    \"Would not Father Naab release you?\"    \"Release me? Why, he would have taken me as a wife for himself but for  Mother Mary. She hates me. So he pledged me to Snap.\"    \"Does August Naab love you?\"    \"Love me? No. Not in the way you mean--perhaps as a daughter. But  Mormons teach duty to church first, and say such love comes--to the  wives--afterward. But it doesn't--not in the women I've seen. There's  Mother Ruth--her heart is broken. She loves me, and I can tell.\"    \"When was this--this marriage to be?\"    \"I don't know. Father Naab promised me to his son when he came home from  the Navajo range. It would be soon if they found out that you and I--  Jack, Snap Naab would kill you!\"    The sudden thought startled the girl. Her eyes betrayed her terror.    \"I mightn't be so easy to kill,\" said Hare, darkly. The words came  unbidden, his first answer to the wild influences about him. \"Mescal,  I'm sorry--maybe I've brought you unhappiness.\"    \"No. No. To be with you has been like sitting there on the rim watching  the desert, the greatest happiness I have ever known. I used to love to  be with the children, but Mother Mary forbade. When I am down there,  which is seldom, I'm not allowed to play with the children any more.\"    \"What can I do?\" asked Hare, passionately.    \"Don't speak to Father Naab. Don't let him guess. Don't leave me here  alone,\" she answered low. It was not the Navajo speaking in her now.  Love had sounded depths hitherto unplumbed; a quick, soft impulsiveness  made the contrast sharp and vivid.    \"How can I help but leave you if he wants me on the cattle ranges?\"    \"I don't know. You must think. He has been so pleased with what you've  done. He's had Mormons up here, and two men not of his Church, and they  did nothing. You've been ill, besides you're different. He will keep me  with the sheep as long as he can, for two reasons--because I drive them  best, he says, and because Snap Naab's wife must be persuaded to welcome  me in her home.\"    \"I'll stay, if I have to get a relapse and go down on my back again,\"  declared Jack. \"I hate to deceive him, but Mescal, pledged or not--I  love you, and I won't give up hope.\"    Her hands flew to her face again and tried to hide the dark blush.    \"Mescal, there's one question I wish you'd answer. Does August Naab  think he'll make a Mormon of me? Is that the secret of his wonderful  kindness?\"    \"Of course he believes he'll make a Mormon of you. That's his religion.  He's felt that way over all the strangers who ever came out here. But  he'd be the same to them without his hopes. I don't know the secret of  his kindness, but I think he loves everybody and everything. And Jack,  he's so good. I owe him all my life. He would not let the Navajos take  me; he raised me, kept me, taught me. I can't break my promise to him.  He's been a father to me, and I love him.\"    \"I think I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12625"],[0,"Architecture and Democracy (#17)"],[1,"modern buildings perforce belong. This is by  reason of a necessity dictated by the materials that we employ, and by  our methods of construction. All modern buildings follow practically  one method of construction: a bony framework of steel--or of concrete  reinforced by steel--filled in and subdivided by concrete, brick,  hollow fire-clay, or some of its substitutes. To a construction of  this kind some sort of an outer encasement is not only aesthetically  desirable, but practically necessary. It usually takes the form of  stone, face-brick, terra-cotta, tile, stucco, or some combination of  two or more of these materials. Of the two types of architecture the  Incrusted type is therefore imposed by structural necessity.    The enormous importance of ceramics in its relation to architecture  thus becomes apparent. They minister to an architectural need instead  of gratifying an architectural whim. Ours is a period of Incrusted  architecture--one which demands the encasement, rather than the  exposure of structure, and therefore logically admits of the  enrichment of surfaces by means of \"veneers\" of materials more  precious and beautiful than those employed in the structure, which  becomes, as it were, the canvas of the picture, and not the picture  itself. For these purposes there are no materials more apt, more  adaptable, more enduring, richer in potentialities of beauty than the  products of ceramic art. They are easily and inexpensively produced of  any desired shape, color, texture; their hard, dense surface resists  the action of the elements, is not easily soiled, and is readily  cleaned; being fashioned by fire they are fire resistant.    So much then for the practical demands, in modern architecture, met by  the products of ceramic art. The aesthetic demand is not less admirably  met--or rather _might_ be.    When, in the sixteenth century, the Renaissance spread from south  to north, color was practically eliminated from architecture. The  Egyptians had had it, hot and bright as the sun on the desert; we  know that the Greeks made their Parian marble glow in rainbow tints;  Moorish architecture was nothing if not colorful, and the Venice  Ruskin loved was fairly iridescent--a thing of fire-opal and pearl.  In Italian Renaissance architecture up to its latest phase, the color  element was always present; but it was snuffed out under the leaden  colored northern skies. Paris is grey, London is brown, New York is  white, and Chicago the color of cinders. We have only to compare them  to yellow Rome, red Siena, and pearl-tinted Venice, to realize how  much we have lost in the elimination of color from architecture.  We are coming to realize it. Color played an important part in the  Pan-American Exposition, and again in the San Francisco Exposition,  where, wedded to light, it became the dominant note of the whole  architectural concert. Now these great expositions in which the  architects and artists are given a free hand, are in the nature of  preliminary studies in which these functionaries sketch in transitory  form the things they desire to do in more permanent form. They are  forecasts of the future, a future which in certain quarters is  already beginning to realize itself. It is therefore probable that  architectural art will become increasingly colorful.    The author remembers the day and the hour when this became his  personal conviction--his personal desire. It happened years ago in  the Albright Gallery in Buffalo--a building then newly completed, of a  severely classic type. In the central hall was a single doorway,  whose white marble architrave had been stained with different colored  pigments by Francis Bacon; after the manner of the Greeks. The effect  was so charming, and made the rest of the place seem by contrast so  cold and dun, that the author came then and there to the conclusion  that architecture without polychromy was architecture incomplete. Mr.  Bacon spent three years in Asia Minor, and elsewhere, studying  the remains of Greek architecture, and he found and brought home a  fragment of an antefix from the temple of Assos, in which the applied  color was still pure and strong. The Greeks were a joyous people. When  joy comes back into life, color will come back into architecture.    Ceramic products are ideal as a means to this end. The Greeks  themselves recognized their value for they used them widely and  wisely: it has been discovered that they even attached bands of  colored terra-cotta to the marble mouldings of their temples. How  different must have been such a temple's real appearance from  that imagined by the Classical Revivalists, whose tradition of the  inviolable cold Parian purity of Greek architecture has persisted,  even against archaeological evidence to the contrary, up to the present  day.    In one way we have an advantage over the Greek, if we only had the wit  to profit by it. His palette, like his musical scale, was more limited  than ours. Nearly the whole gamut of the spectrum is now available to  the architect who wishes to employ ceramics. The colors do not  change or fade, and possess a beautiful quality. Our craftsmen and  manufacturers of face-brick, terra-cotta, and colored tile, after much  costly experimentation, have succeeded in producing ceramics of a  high order of excellence and intrinsic beauty; they can do practically  anything demanded of them; but from that quarter where they  should reap the greatest commercial advantage--the field of  architecture--there is all too little demand. The architect who should  lead, teach and dictate in this field, is often through ignorance  obliged to learn and follow instead. This has led to an ignominious  situation--ignominious, that is, to the architect. He has come  to require of the manufacturer--when he requires anything at  all--assistance in the very matter in which he should assist: the  determination of color design. It is no wonder that the results are  often bad, and therefore discouraging. The manufacturers of ceramics  welcome co-operation and assistance on the part of the architect with  an eagerness which is almost pathetic, on those rare occasions when  assistance is offered.    But the architect is not really to blame: the reason for his failure  lies deep in his general predicament of having to know a little of  everything, and do a great deal more than he can possibly do well. To  cope with this, if his practice warrants the expenditure, he surrounds  himself with specialists in various fields, and assigns various  departments of his work to them. He cannot be expected to have on  his staff a specialist in ceramics, nor can he, with all his manifold  activities, be expected to become such a specialist himself. As a  result, he is usually content to let color problems alone, for they  are just another complication of his already too complicated life;  or he refers them to some one whom he thinks ought to know--a  manufacturer's designer--and approves almost anything submitted. Of  course the ideal architect would have time for every problem, and  solve it supremely well; but the real architect is all too human:  there are depressions on his cranium where bumps ought to be;  moreover, he wants a little time left to energize in other  directions than in the practice of his craft. One of the functions  of architecture is to reveal the inherent qualities and beauties of  different materials, by their appropriate use and tasteful display.  An onyx staircase on the one hand, and a portland cement high altar  on the other, alike violate this function of architecture; they  transgress that beautiful necessity which decrees that precious  materials should serve precious uses and common materials should  serve utilitarian ends. Now color is a precious thing, and its highest  beauties can be brought out only by contrast with broad neutral tinted  spaces. The interior walls of a mediaeval cathedral never competed  with its windows, and by the same token, a riot of polychromy all  over the side of a building is not as effective, even from a chromatic  point of view, as though it were confined, say, to an entrance and a  frieze. Gilbert's witty phrase is applicable here:      \"Where everybody's somebody, nobody's anybody.\"    Let us build our walls, then, of stone, or brick, or stucco,--for  their flat surfaces and neutral tints conduce to that repose so  essential to good architectural effect: but let us not rest content  with this, but grant to the eye the delight and contentment which it  craves, by color and pattern placed at those points to which it is  desirable to attract attention, for they serve the same aesthetic  purpose as a tiara on the brow of beauty, or a ring on a delicate  white hand. But just as jewelry is best when it is most individual,  so the ornament of a building should be in keeping with its general  character and complexion. A color scheme should not be chosen at  random, but dictated by the prevailing tone and texture of the wall  surfaces, with which it should harmonize as inevitably as the blossom  of a bush with its prevailing tone of stems and foliage. In a building  this prevailing tone will inevitably be either cold or warm, and the  color scheme just as inevitably should be either cold or warm; that  is, there should be a preponderance of cold colors over warm, or vice  versa. Otherwise the eye will suffer just that order of uneasiness  which comes from the contemplation of two equal masses, whereas it  experiences satisfaction in proportionate unequals.    Nothing will take the place of an instinctive colour-sense, but even  that needs the training of experience, if the field be new, and a few  general principles of all but universal application will not be amiss.    First of all it should be remembered that the intensity of color  should be carefully adjusted to its area. It is dangerous to try to  use high, pure colors, unrelieved and uncontrasted, in "]]]
