[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12436"],[0,"The Night Horseman (#17)"],[1,"FOR OLD NICK      A thought is like a spur. It lifts the head of a man as the spur makes  the horse toss his; and it quickens the pace with a subtle addition of  strength. Such a thought came to Buck Daniels as he stepped again on the  veranda of the hotel. It could not have been an altogether pleasant  inspiration, for it drained the colour from his face and made him clench  his broad hands; and next he loosened his revolver in its holster. A  thought of fighting--of some desperate chance he had once taken,  perhaps.    But also it was a thought which needed considerable thought. He slumped  into a wicker chair at one end of the porch and sat with his chin  resting on his chest while he smoked cigarette after cigarette and  tossed the butts idly over the rail. More than once he pressed his hand  against his lips as though there were sudden pains there. The colour did  not come back to his face; it continued as bloodless as ever, but there  was a ponderable light in his eyes, and his jaws became more and more  firmly set. It was not a pleasant face to watch at that moment, for he  seemed to sit with a growing resolve.    Long moments passed before he moved a muscle, but then he heard, far  away, thin, and clear, whistling from behind the hotel. It was no  recognisable tune. It was rather a strange improvisation, with singable  fragments here and there, and then wild, free runs and trills. It was as  if some bird of exquisite singing powers should be taken in a rapture of  song, so that it whistled snatches here and there of its usual melody,  but all between were great, whole-throated rhapsodies. As the sound of  this whistling came to him, Buck raised his head suddenly. And finally,  still listening, he rose to his feet and turned into the dining-room.    There he found the waitress he had met before, and he asked her for the  name of the doctor who took care of the wounded Jerry Strann.    \"There ain't no doc,\" said the waitress. \"It's Fatty Matthews, the  deputy marshal, who takes care of that Strann--bad luck to him! Fatty's  in the barroom now. But what's the matter? You seem like you was hearin'  something?\"    \"I am,\" replied Daniels enigmatically. \"I'm hearin' something that would  be music for the ears of Old Nick.\"    And he turned on his heel and strode for the barroom. There he found  Fatty in the very act of disposing of a stiff three-fingers of red-eye.  Daniels stepped to the bar, poured his own drink, and then stood toying  with the glass. For though the effect of red-eye may be pleasant enough,  it has an essence which appalls the stoutest heart and singes the most  leathery throat; it is to full-grown men what castor oil is to a child.  Why men drink it is a mystery whose secret is known only to the  profound soul of the mountain-desert. But while Daniels fingered his  glass he kept an eye upon the other man at the bar.    It was unquestionably the one he sought. The excess flesh of the deputy  marshal would have brought his nickname to the mind of an imbecile.  However, Fatty was humming softly to himself, and it is not the habit of  men who treat very sick patients to sing.    \"I'll hit it agin,\" said Fatty. \"I need it.\"    \"Have a bad time of it to-day?\" asked O'Brien sympathetically.    \"Bad time to-day? Yep, an' every day is the same. I tell you, O'Brien,  it takes a pile of nerve to stand around that room expectin' Jerry to  pass out any minute, and the eyes of that devil Mac Strann followin' you  every step you make. D'you know, if Jerry dies I figure Mac to go at my  throat like a bulldog.\"    \"You're wrong, Fatty,\" replied O'Brien. \"That ain't his way about it. He  takes his time killin' a man. Waits till he can get him in a public  place and make him start the picture. That's Mac Strann! Remember  Fitzpatrick? Mac Strann followed Fitz nigh onto two months, but Fitz  knew what was up and he never would make a move. He knowed that if he  made a wrong pass it would be his last. So he took everything and let it  pass by. But finally it got on his nerves. One time--it was right here  in my barroom, Fatty----\"    \"The hell you say!\"    \"Yep, that was before your time around these parts. But Fitz had a  couple of jolts of red-eye under his vest and felt pretty strong. Mac  Strann happened in and first thing you know they was at it. Well, Fitz  was a big man. I ain't small, but I had to look up when I talked to  Fitz. Scotch-Irish, and they got fightin' bred into their bone. Mac  Strann passed him a look and Fitz come back with a word. Soon as he got  started he couldn't stop. Wasn't a pretty thing to watch, either. You  could see in Fitz's face that he knew he was done for before he started,  but he wouldn't, let up. The booze had him going and he was too proud to  back down. Pretty soon he started cussing Mac Strann.    \"Well, by that time everybody had cleared out of the saloon, because  they knowed that them sort of words meant bullets comin'. But Mac Strann  jest stood there watchin', and grinnin' in his ugly way--damn his soul  black!--and never sayin' a word back. By God, Fatty, he looked sort of  hungry. When he grinned, his upper lip went up kind of slow and you  could see his big teeth. I expected to see him make a move to sink 'em  in the throat of Fitz. But he didn't. Nope, he didn't make a move, and  all the time Fitz ravin' and gettin' worse and worse. Finally Fitz made  the move. Yep, he pulled his gun and had it damned near clean on Mac  Strann before that devil would stir. But when he _did_, it was jest a  flash of light. Both them guns went off, but Mac's bullet hit Fitz's  hand and knocked the gun out of it--so of course his shot went wild.  But Fitz could see his own blood, and you know what that does to the  Scotch-Irish? Makes _some_ people quit cold to see their own blood. I  remember a kid at school that was a whale at fightin' till his nose got  to bleedin', or something, and then he'd quit cold. But you take a  Scotch-Irishman and it works just the other way. Show him his own colour  and he goes plumb crazy.    \"That's what happened to Fitz. When he saw the blood on his hand he made  a dive at Mac Strann. After that it wasn't the sort of thing that makes  a good story. Mac Strann got him around the ribs and I heard the bones  crack. God! And him still squeezin', and Fitz beatin' away at Mac's face  with his bleedin' hand.    \"Will you b'lieve that I stood here and was sort of froze? Yes, Fatty, I  couldn't make a move. And I was sort of sick and hollow inside the same  way I went one time when I was a kid and seen a big bull horn a  yearlin'.    \"Then I heard the breath of Fitz comin' hoarse, with a rattle in it--and  I heard Mac Strann whining like a dog that's tasted blood and is  starvin' for more. A thing to make your hair go up on end, like they say  in the story-books.    \"Then Fitz--he was plumb mad--tried to bite Mac Strann. And then Mac let  go of him and set his hands on the throat of Fitz. It happened like a  flash--I'm here to swear that I could hear the bones crunch. And then  Fitz's mouth sagged open and his eyes rolled up to the ceiling, and Mac  Strann threw him down on the floor. Just like that! Damn him! And then  he stood over poor dead Fitz and kicked him in those busted ribs and  turned over to the bar and says to me: 'Gimme!'    \"Like a damned beast! He wanted to drink right there with his dead man  beside him. And what was worse, I had to give him the bottle. There was  a sort of haze in front of my eyes. I wanted to pump that devil full of  lead, but I knowed it was plain suicide to try it.    \"So there he stood and ups with a glass that was brimmin' full, and  downs it at a swallow--gurglin'--like a hog! Fatty, how long will it be  before there's an end to Mac Strann?\"    But Fatty Matthews shrugged his thick shoulders and poured himself  another drink.    \"There ain't a hope for Jerry Strann?\" cut in Buck Daniels.    \"Not one in a million,\" coughed Fatty, disposing of another formidable  potion.    \"And when Jerry dies, Mac starts for this Barry?\"    \"Who's been tellin' you?\" queried O'Brien dryly. \"Maybe you been readin'  minds, stranger?\"    Buck Daniels regarded the bartender with a mild and steadfast interest.  He was smiling with the utmost good-humour, but there was that about him  which made big O'Brien flush and look down to his array of glasses  behind the bar.    \"I been wondering,\" went on Daniels, \"if Mac Strann mightn't come out  with Barry about the way Jerry did. Ain't it possible?\"    \"No,\" replied Fatty Matthews with calm decision. \"It ain't possible.  Well, I'm due back in my bear cage. Y'ought to look in on me, O'Brien,  and see the mountain-lion dyin' and the grizzly lookin' on.\"    \"Will it last long?\" queried O'Brien.    \"Somewhere's about this evening.\"    Here Daniels started violently and closed his hand hard around his  whiskey glass which he had not yet raised towards his lips.    \"Are you sure of that, marshal?\" he asked. \"If Jerry's held on this long  ain't there a chance that he'll hold on longer? Can you date him up for  to-night as sure as that?\"    \"I can,\" said the deputy marshal. \"It ain't hard when you seen as many  go west as I've seen. It ain't harder than it is to tell when the sand  will be out of an hour glass. When they begin going down the last hill  it ain't hard to tell when they'll reach the bottom.\"    \"Ain't you had anybody to spell you, Fatty?\" broke in O'Brien.    \"Yep. I got Haw-Haw Langley up there. But he ain't much help. Just sits  around with his hands folded. Kind of looks like Haw-Haw _wanted_ Jerry  to pass out.\"    And Matthews went humming through the swinging door.          CHAPTER XV    OLD GARY PETERS      For some moments after this Buck Daniels remained at the bar with his  hand clenched around his glass and his eyes fixed before him in the  peculiar second-sighted manner which had marked him when he sat so long  on the veranda.    \"Funny thing,\" began O'Brien, to make"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12473"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 06 (#17)"],[1,"through the dark-green of the firs. The roots  of the trees formed a natural stairway, and everywhere my feet  encountered swelling beds of moss, for the stones are here covered  foot-deep, as if with light-green velvet cushions. Everywhere a pleasant  freshness and the dreamy murmur of streams. Here and there we see water  rippling silver-clear amid the rocks, washing the bare roots and fibres  of trees. Bend down toward all this ceaseless activity and listen, and  you will hear, as it were, the mysterious history of the growth of the  plants, and the quiet pulsations of the heart of the mountain. In many  places the water jets strongly up amid rocks and roots, forming little  cascades. It is pleasant to sit in such places. There is such a  wonderful murmuring and rustling, the birds pour forth broken lovesick  strains, the trees whisper as if with a thousand maidens' tongues, the  odd mountain flowers peep up at us as if with a thousand maidens' eyes,  stretching out to us their curious, broad, drolly-scalloped leaves; the  sun-rays flash here and there in sport; the herbs, as though endowed  with reason, are telling one another their green legends; all seems  enchanted and it becomes more and more mysterious; an old, old dream is  realized--the loved one appears! Alas, that she so quickly vanishes!    The higher we ascend, so much the shorter and more dwarflike do the  fir-trees become, shrinking up, as it were, within themselves, until  finally only whortleberries, bilberries, and mountain herbs remain. It  is also sensibly colder. Here, for the first time, the granite boulders,  which are frequently of enormous size, become fully visible. These may  well have been the balls which evil spirits cast at one another on the  Walpurgis night, when the witches come riding hither on brooms and  pitchforks, when the mad, unhallowed revelry begins, as our credulous  nurses have told us, and as we may see it represented in the beautiful  Faust pictures of Master Retsch. Yes, a young poet, who, while  journeying from Berlin to Gottingen passed the Brocken on the first  evening in May, even noticed how certain ladies who cultivated  _belles-lettres_, were holding their esthetic tea-circle in a rocky  corner, how they comfortably read aloud the _Evening Journal_, how they  praised as universal geniuses their poetic billy-goats which hopped  bleating around their table, and how they passed a final judgment on all  the productions of German literature. But when they at last fell upon  _Ratcliff_ and _Almansor_, utterly denying to the author aught like  piety or Christianity, the hair of the youth rose on end, terror seized  him--I spurred my steed and rode onwards!    In fact, when we ascend the upper half of the Brocken, no one can well  help thinking of the amusing legends of the Blocksberg, and especially  of the great mystical German national tragedy of Doctor Faust. It ever  seemed to me that I could hear the cloven foot scrambling along behind,  and some one breathing humorously. And I verily believe that \"Mephisto\"  himself must breathe with difficulty when he climbs his favorite  mountain, for it is a road which is to the last degree exhausting, and I  was glad enough when I at last beheld the long-desired Brocken house.    [Illustration: \"THE WITCHES DANCING GROUND\"]    This house, as every one knows from numerous pictures, is situated on  the summit of the mountain, consists of a single story, and was erected  in the year 1800 by Count Stolberg-Wernigerode, in behalf of whom it is  managed as a tavern. On account of the wind and cold in winter its walls  are incredibly thick. The roof is low. From its midst rises a towerlike  observatory, and near the house lie two little out-buildings, one of  which in earlier times served as shelter to the Brocken visitors.    On entering the Brocken house, I experienced a somewhat unusual and  unreal sensation. After a long solitary journey amid rocks and pines,  the traveler suddenly finds himself in a house amid the clouds. Far  below lie cities, hills, and forests, while above he encounters a  curiously blended circle of strangers, by whom he is received, as is  usual in such assemblies, almost like an expected companion--half  inquisitively and half indifferently. I found the house full of guests,  and, as becomes a wise man, I first thought of the night, and of the  discomfort of sleeping on straw. With the voice of one dying I called  for tea, and the Brocken landlord was reasonable enough to perceive that  the sick gentleman must be provided with a decent bed. This he gave me  in a narrow room, where a young merchant--a long emetic in a brown  overcoat--had already established himself.    In the public room I found a full tide of bustle and animation. There  were students from different universities. Some of the newly arrived  were taking refreshments. Others, preparing for departure, buckled on  their knapsacks, wrote their names in the album, and received Brocken  bouquets from the housemaids. There was pinching of cheeks, singing,  springing, trilling; questions asked, answers given, fragments of  conversation such as--fine weather--footpath--_prosit_--luck be with  you!--Adieu! Some of those leaving were also partly drunk, and these  derived a twofold pleasure from the beautiful scenery, for a tipsy man  sees double.    After recruiting my strength I ascended the observatory, and there found  a little gentleman with two ladies, one of whom was young and the other  elderly. The young lady was very beautiful--a superb figure, flowing  locks, surmounted by a helm-like black satin _chapeau_, amid whose white  plumes the wind played; fine limbs, so closely enwrapped by a black silk  mantle that their exquisite form was made manifest, and great free eyes,  calmly looking down into the great free world.    When a boy I thought of naught save tales of magic and wonder, and every  fair lady who had ostrich feathers on her head I regarded as an elfin  queen. If I observed that the train of her dress was wet I believed at  once that she must be a water-fairy. Now I know better, having learned  from natural history that those symbolical feathers are found on the  most stupid of birds, and that the train of a lady's dress may become  wet in a very natural way. But if I had, with those boyish eyes, seen  the aforesaid young lady in the aforesaid position on the Brocken, I  would most assuredly have thought--\"that is the fairy of the mountain,  and she has just uttered the charm which has caused every thing down  there to appear so wonderful.\" Yes, at the first glance from the Brocken  everything appears in a high degree marvelous. New impressions throng in  on every side, and these, varied and often contradictory, unite in our  soul in an as yet undefined uncomprehended sensation. If we succeed in  grasping the sensation in its conception we shall comprehend the  character of the mountain. This character is entirely German as regards  not only its advantages but also its defects. The Brocken is a German.  With German thoroughness he points out to us--sharply and accurately  defined as in a panorama--the hundreds of cities, towns, and villages  which are principally situated to the north, and all the mountains,  forests, rivers, and plains which extend endlessly in all directions.  But for this very reason everything appears like a sharply designed and  perfectly colored map, and nowhere is the eye gratified by really  beautiful landscapes--just as we German compilers, owing to the  honorable exactness with which we attempt to give all and everything,  never appear to think of giving the details in a beautiful manner.    [Illustration: THE BROCKEN INN ABOUT 1830]    The mountain, in consequence, has a certain calm, German, intelligent,  tolerant character, simply because he can see things so distant yet so  distinctly. And when such a mountain opens his giant eyes, it may be  that he sees somewhat more than we dwarfs, who with our weak eyes climb  over him. Many indeed assert that the Blocksberg is very Philistian, and  Claudius once sang \"The Blocksberg is the lengthy Sir Philistine;\" but  that was an error. On account of his bald head, which he occasionally  covers with a cloud-cap, the Blocksberg has indeed a somewhat Philistian  aspect, but this with him, as with many other great Germans, is the  result of pure irony; for it is notorious that he has his wild student  and fantastic periods, as, for instance, on the first night of May. Then  he casts his cloud-cap uproariously and merrily into the air, and  becomes, like the rest of us, romantic mad, in real German fashion.    I soon sought to entrap the beauty into a conversation, for we begin to  fully enjoy the beauties of nature only when we talk about them on the  spot.           *       *       *       *       *    While we conversed twilight stole, the air grew colder, the sun sank  lower and lower, and the tower platform was filled with students,  traveling mechanics, and a few honest citizens with their spouses and  daughters, all of whom were desirous of witnessing the sunset. It is  truly a sublime spectacle, which tunes the soul to prayer. For a full  quarter of an hour all stood in solemn silence, gazing on the beautiful  fire-ball as it gradually sank in the west; our faces were bathed in the  rosy light; our hands were involuntarily folded; it seemed as if we, a  silent congregation, stood in the nave of a giant cathedral, that the  priest raised the body of the Lord, and the Palestrina's immortal hymns  poured forth from the organ.    As I stood thus, lost in devotion, I heard some one near me exclaim,  \"Ah, how beautiful Nature is, as a general thing!\" These words came from  the sentimental heart of my room-mate, the young merchant. They brought  me back to my week-day frame of mind, and I was now able to say a few  neat things to the ladies about the sunset and to accompany them, as  calmly as if"]]]
