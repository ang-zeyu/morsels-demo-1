[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11498"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 601, July 9, 1887 (#17)"],[1,"tration: FIG. 7.]    In Fig. 2, C is a coil traversed by alternating currents. B is a copper  case or tube surrounding it, but not exactly over its center. The copper  tube, B, is fairly massive and is the seat of heavy induced currents.  There is a preponderance of repulsive action, tending to force the two  conductors apart in an axial line. The part, B, may be replaced by  concentric tubes slid one in the other, or by a pile of flat rings, or  by a closed coil of coarse or fine wire insulated, or not. If the coil,  C, or primary coil, is provided with an iron core such as a bundle of  fine iron wires, the effects are greatly increased in intensity, and the  repulsion with a strong primary current may become quite vigorous, many  pounds of thrust being producible by apparatus of quite moderate size.    The forms and relations of the two parts, C and B, may be greatly  modified, with the general result of a preponderance of repulsive action  when the alternating currents circulate.    Fig. 3 shows the part, B, of an internally tapered or coned form, and C  of an externally coned form, wound on an iron wire bundle, I. The action  in Fig. 2 may be said to be analogous to that of a plain solenoid with  its core, except that repulsion, and not attraction, is produced, while  that of Fig. 3 is more like the action of tapered or conically wound  solenoids and taper cores. Of course, it is unnecessary that both be  tapered. The effect of such shaping is simply to modify the range of  action and the amount of repulsive effort existing at different parts of  the range.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.]    In Fig. 4 the arrangement is modified so that the coil, C, is outside,  and the closed band or circuit, B, inside and around the core, I.  Electro-inductive repulsion is produced as before.    It will be evident that the repulsive actions will not be mechanically  manifested by axial movement or effort when the electrical middles of  the coils or circuits are coincident. In cylindrical coils in which the  current is uniformly distributed through all the parts of the conductor  section, what I here term the electrical middle, or the center of  gravity of the ampere turns of the coils, will be the plane at right  angles to its axis at its middle, that of B and C, in Fig. 4, being  indicated by a dotted line. To repeat, then, when the centers or center  planes of the conductors, Fig. 4, coincide, no indication of  electro-inductive repulsion is given, because it is mutually balanced in  all directions; but when the coils are displaced, a repulsion is  manifested, which reaches a maximum at a position depending on the  peculiarities of proportion and distribution of current at any time in  the two circuits or conductors.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.]    It is not my purpose now to discuss the ways of determining the  distribution of currents and mechanical effects, as that would extend  the present paper much beyond its intended limit. The forms and relative  arrangement of the two conductors may be greatly varied. In Fig. 5 the  parts are of equal diameter, one, B, being a closed ring, and the other,  C, being an annular coil placed parallel thereto; and an iron core or  wire bundle placed in the common axis of the two coils increases the  repulsive action. B may be simply a disk or plate of any form, without  greatly affecting the nature of the action produced. It may also be  composed of a pile of copper washers or a coil of wire, as before  indicated.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.]    An arrangement of parts somewhat analogous to that of a horseshoe  electro magnet and armature is shown in Fig. 6. The alternating current  coils, C C', are wound upon an iron wire bundle bent into U form, and  opposite its poles is placed a pair of thick copper disks, B B', which  are attracted and repelled, but with an excess of repulsion depending on  their form, thickness, etc.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.]    If the iron core takes the form of that shown by I I, Fig. 7, such as a  cut ring with the coil, C, wound thereon, the insertion of a heavy  copper plate, B, into the slot or divided portion of the ring will be  opposed by a repulsive effort when alternating currents pass in C. This  was the first form of device in which I noticed the phenomenon of  repulsive preponderance in question. The tendency is to thrust the  plate, B, out of the slot in the ring excepting only when its center is  coincident with the magnetic axis joining the poles of the ring between  which B is placed.    If the axes of the conductors, Fig. 5, are not coincident, but  displaced, as in Fig. 8, then, besides a simple repulsion apart, there  is a lateral component or tendency, as indicated by the arrows. Akin to  this is the experiment illustrated in Fig. 9. Here the closed conductor,  B, is placed with its plane at right angles to that of C, wound on a  wire bundle. The part, B, tends to move toward the center of the coil,  C, so that its axis will be in the middle plane of C, transverse to the  core, as indicated by the dotted line. This leads us at once to another  class of actions, i.e., deflective actions.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.]    When one of the conductors, as B, Fig. 10, composed of a disk, or,  better, of a pile of thin copper disks, or of a closed coil of wire, is  mounted on an axis, X, transverse to the axis of coil, C, through which  coil the alternating current passes, a deflection of B to the position  indicated by dotted lines will take place, unless the plane of B is at  the start exactly coincident with that of C. If slightly inclined at the  start, deflection will be caused as stated. It matters not whether the  coil, C, incloses the part, B, or be inclosed by it, or whether the  coil, C, be pivoted and B fixed, or both be pivoted. In Fig. 11 the  coil, C, surrounds an iron wire core, and B is pivoted above it, as  shown. It is deflected, as before, to the position indicated in dotted  lines.    [Illustration: FIG. 13]    It is important to remark here that in cases where deflection is to be  obtained, as in Figs. 10 and 11, B had best be made of a pile of thin  washers or a closed coil of insulated wire instead of a solid ring. This  avoids the lessening of effect which would come from the induction of  currents in the ring, B, in other directions than parallel to its  circumference.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.]    We will now turn our attention to the explanation of the actions  exhibited, and afterward refer to their possible applications. It may be  stated as certainly true that were the induced currents in the closed  conductor unaffected by any self-induction, the only phenomena exhibited  would be alternate equal attractions and repulsions, because currents  would be induced in opposite directions to that of the primary current  when the latter current was changing from zero to maximum positive or  negative current, so producing repulsion; and would be induced in the  same direction when changing from maximum positive or negative value to  zero, so producing attraction.    This condition can be illustrated by a diagram, Fig. 12. Here the lines  of zero current are the horizontal straight lines. The wavy lines  represent the variations of current strength in each conductor, the  current in one direction being indicated by that portion of the curve  above the zero line, and in the other direction by that portion below  it. The vertical dotted lines simply mark off corresponding portions of  phase or succession of times.    [Illustration: FIG. 15]    Here it will be seen that in the positive primary current descending  from m, its maximum, to the zero line, the secondary current has risen  from its zero to m, its maximum. Attraction will therefore ensue, for  the currents are in the same direction in the two conductors. When the  primary current increases from zero to its negative maximum, n, the  positive current in the secondary closed circuit will be decreasing from  m, its positive maximum, to zero; but, as the currents are in opposite  directions, repulsion will occur. These actions of attraction and  repulsion will be reproduced continually, there being a repulsion, then  an attraction, then a repulsion, and again an attraction, during one  complete wave of the primary current. The letters, r, a, at the foot of  the diagram, Fig. 12, indicate this succession.    In reality, however, the effects of self-induction in causing a lag,  shift, or retardation of phase in the secondary current will  considerably modify the results, and especially so when the secondary  conductor is constructed so as to give to such self-induction a large  value. In other words, the maxima of the primary or inducing current  will no longer be found coincident with the zero points of the secondary  currents. The effect will be the same as if the line representing the  wave of the secondary current in Fig. 12 had been shifted forward to a  greater or less extent. This is indicated in diagram, Fig. 13. It gives  doubtless an exaggerated view of the action, though from the effects of  repulsion which I have produced, I should say it is by no means an  unrealizable condition.    [Illustration: Fig. 16.]    It will be noticed that the period during which the currents are  opposite, and during which repulsion can take place, is lengthened at  the expense of the period during which the currents are in the same  direction for attractive action. These differing periods are marked r,  a, etc., or the period during which _repulsion_ exists is from the zero  of the primary or inducing current to the succeeding zero of the  secondary or induced current; and the period during which _attraction_  exists is from the zero of the induced current to the zero of inducing  current.    But far more important still in giving prominence to the repulsive  effect than this difference of effective period is the fact that during  the period of repulsion both the inducing and induced"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1152"],[0,"The Story of the Volsungs (Volsunga Saga); with Excerpts from the Poetic Edda (#17)"],[1,"it me, then, thy dream,\" said the woman, \"for dreams oft forecast  but the weather.\"    Gudrun answers, \"Nay, nay, no weather is this; I dreamed that I had a  fair hawk on my wrist, feathered with feathers of gold.\"    Says the woman, \"Many have heard tell of thy beauty, thy wisdom, and thy  courtesy; some king's son abides thee, then.\"    Gudrun answers, \"I dreamed that naught was so dear to me as this hawk,  and all my wealth had I cast aside rather than him.\"    The woman said, \"Well, then, the man thou shalt have will be of the  goodliest, and well shalt thou love him.\"    Gudrun answered, \"It grieves me that I know not who he shall be; let us  go seek Brynhild, for she belike will wot thereof.\"    So they arrayed them in gold and many a fair thing, and she went with  her damsels till they came to the hall of Brynhild, and that hall was  dight with gold, and stood on a high hill; and whenas their goings were  seen, it was told Brynhild, that a company of women drove toward the  burg in gilded waggons.    \"That shall be Gudrun, Giuki's daughter,\" says she: \"I dreamed of her  last night; let us go meet her! No fairer woman may come to our house.\"    So they went abroad to meet them, and gave them good greeting, and they  went into the goodly hall together; fairly painted it was within, and  well adorned with silver vessel; cloths were spread under the feet of  them, and all folk served them, and in many wise they sported.    But Gudrun was somewhat silent.    Then said Brynhild, \"Ill to abash folk of their mirth; prithee do not  so; let us talk together for our disport of mighty kings and their great  deeds.\"    \"Good talk,\" says Gudrun, \"let us do even so; what kings deemest thou to  have been the first of all men?\"    Brynhild says, \"The sons of Haki, and Hagbard withal; they brought to  pass many a deed of fame in the warfare.\"    Gudrun answers, \"Great men certes, and of noble fame! Yet Sigar took  their one sister, and burned the other, house and all; and they may be  called slow to revenge the deed; why didst thou not name my brethren, who  are held to be the first of men as at this time?\"    Brynhild says, \"Men of good hope are they surely, though but little  proven hitherto; but one I know far before them, Sigurd, the son of  Sigmund the king; a youngling was he in the days when he slew the sons  of Hunding, and revenged his father, and Eylimi, his mother's father.\"    Said Gudrun, \"By what token tellest thou that?\"    Brynhild answered, \"His mother went amid the dead, and found Sigmund the  king sore wounded, and would bind up his hurts; but he said he grew over  old for war, and bade her lay this comfort to her heart, that she should  bear the most famed of sons; and wise was the wise man's word therein:  for after the death of King Sigmund, she went to King Alf, and there was  Sigurd nourished in great honour, and day by day he wrought some deed of  fame, and is the man most renowned of all the wide world.\"    Gudrun says, \"From love hast thou gained these tidings of him; but for  this cause came I here, to tell thee dreams of mine which have brought  me great grief.\"    Says Brynhild, \"Let not such matters sadden thee; abide with thy friends  who wish thee blithesome, all of them!\"    \"This I dreamed,\" said Gudrun, \"that we went, a many of us in company,  from the bower, and we saw an exceeding great hart, that far excelled  all other deer ever seen, and the hair of him was golden; and this  deer we were all fain to take, but I alone got him; and he seemed to me  better than all things else; but sithence thou, Byrnhild, didst shoot  and slay my deer even at my very knees, and such grief was that to  me that scarce might I bear it; and then afterwards thou gavest me a  wolf-cub, which besprinkled me with the blood of my brethren.\"    Brynhild answers, \"I will arede thy dream, even as things shall come  to pass hereafter; for Sigurd shall come to thee, even he whom I have  chosen for my well-beloved; and Grimhild shall give him mead mingled  with hurtful things, which shall cast us all into mighty strife. Him  shalt thou have, and him shalt thou quickly miss; and Atli the king  shalt thou wed; and thy brethren shalt thou lose, and slay Atli withal  in the end.\"    Gudrun answers, \"Grief and woe to know that such things shall be!\"    And therewith she and hers get them gone home to King Giuki.        CHAPTER XXVI. Sigurd comes to the Giukings and is wedded to Gudrun.    Now Sigurd goes his ways with all that great treasure, and in friendly  wise he departs from them; and on Grani he rides with all his war-gear  and the burden withal; and thus he rides until he comes to the hall  of King Giuki; there he rides into the burg, and that sees one of the  king's men, and he spake withal--    \"Sure it may be deemed that here is come one of the Gods, for his array  is all done with gold, and his horse is far mightier than other horses,  and the manner of his weapons is most exceeding goodly, and most of all  the man himself far excels all other men ever seen.\"    So the king goes out with his court and greets the man, and asks--    \"Who art thou who thus ridest into my burg, as none has durst hitherto  without the leave of my sons?\"    He answered, \"I am called Sigurd, son of King Sigmund.\"    Then said King Giuki, \"Be thou welcome here then, and take at our hands  whatso thou willest.\"    So he went into the king's hall, and all men seemed little beside him,  and all men served him, and there he abode in great joyance.    Now oft they all ride abroad together, Sigurd and Gunnar and Hogni,  and ever is Sigurd far the foremost of them, mighty men of their hands  though they were.    But Grimhild finds how heartily Sigurd loved Brynhild, and how oft he  talks of her; and she falls to thinking how well it were, if he might  abide there and wed the daughter of King Giuki, for she saw that none  might come anigh to his goodliness, and what faith and goodhelp there  was in him, and how that he had more wealth withal than folk might tell  of any man; and the king did to him even as unto his own sons, and they  for their parts held him of more worth than themselves.    So on a night as they sat at the drink, the queen arose, and went before  Sigurd, and said--    \"Great joy we have in thine abiding here, and all good things will  we put before thee to take of us; lo now, take this horn and drink  thereof.\"    So he took it and drank, and therewithal she said, \"Thy father shall be  Giuki the king, and I shall be thy mother, and Gunnar and Hogni shall be  thy brethren, and all this shall be sworn with oaths each to each; and  then surely shall the like of you never be found on earth.\"    Sigurd took her speech well, for with the drinking of that drink all  memory of Brynhild departed from him. So there he abode awhile.    And on a day went Grimhild to Giuki the king, and cast her arms about  his neck, and spake--    \"Behold, there has now come to us the greatest of great hearts that the  world holds; and needs must he be trusty and of great avail; give him  thy daughter then, with plenteous wealth, and as much of rule as he  will; perchance thereby he will be well content to abide here ever.\"    The king answered, \"Seldom does it befall that kings offer their  daughters to any; yet in higher wise will it be done to offer her to  this man, than to take lowly prayers for her from others.\"    On a night Gudrun pours out the drink, and Sigurd beholds her how fair  she is and how full of all courtesy.    Five seasons Sigurd abode there, and ever they passed their days  together in good honour and friendship.    And so it befell that the kings held talk together, and Giuki said --    \"Great good thou givest us, Sigurd, and with exceeding strength thou  strengthenest our realm.\"    Then Gunnar said, \"All things that may be will we do for thee, so thou  abidest here long; both dominion shalt thou have, and our sister freely  and unprayed for, whom another man would not get for all his prayers.\"    Sigurd says, \"Thanks have ye for this wherewith ye honour me, and  gladly will I take the same.\"    Therewith they swore brotherhood together, and to be even as if they  were children of one father and one mother; and a noble feast was  holden, and endured many days, and Sigurd drank at the wedding of him  and Gudrun; and there might men behold all manner of game and glee, and  each day the feast better and better.    Now fare these folk wide over the world, and do many great deeds, and  slay many kings' sons, and no man has ever done such works of prowess as  did they; then home they come again with much wealth won in war.    Sigurd gave of the serpent's heart to Gudrun, and she ate thereof, and  became greater-hearted, and wiser than ere before: and the son of these  twain was called Sigmund.    Now on a time went Grimhild to Gunnar her son, and spake--    \"Fair blooms the life and fortune of thee, but for one thing only, and  namely whereas thou art unwedded; go woo Brynhild; good rede is this,  and Sigurd will ride with thee.\"    Gunnar answered, \"Fair is she certes, and I am fain enow to win her;\"  and therewith he tells his father, and his brethren, and Sigurd, and  they all prick him on to that wooing.        CHAPTER XXVII. The Wooing of Brynhild.    Now they array them joyously for their journey, and ride over hill and  dale to the house of King Budli, and woo his daughter of him; in a good  wise he took their speech, if so be that she herself would not deny  them; but he said withal that so high-minded was she, that that man  only might wed her whom she would.    Then they ride to Hlymdale, and there Heimir gave them good welcome; so  Gunnar tells his errand; Heimir says, that she must needs wed but him  whom she herself chose freely; and tells them how her abode was but a  little way thence, and that he deemed that him only would she have who  should ride through the flaming fire that was drawn round about her  hall; "]]]
