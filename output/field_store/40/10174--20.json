Nor were the Uniackes and the Invernesses the bell-wethers of  the flock. Those august families had returned to London for the season;  but the taboo half-suggested by Mrs. Venables had begun and ended in her  own mind. Indeed, that potent and diplomatic dame, who was the undoubted  leader of society within a four-mile radius of Northborough town hall,  was the first to recognize the mistake that she had made, and to behave  as though she had never made it. Quite early in June, the Steels were  bidden to a dinner-party in their honor at Upthorpe Hall.    \"Mrs. Venables!\" cried Rachel, in dismay. \"Is that the gushing woman  with the quiet daughters who called last Thursday?\"    \"That is the lady,\" said Steel, a gleam of humor in his grim eyes. He  never expressed an opinion to his wife about any one of their  neighbors, but when she let fall an impression of her own, he would  look at her in this way, as though it was the very one that he had  formed for himself a year ago.    \"But need we go?\" asked Rachel, with open apprehension.    \"I think so,\" he said. \"Why not?\"    \"A dinner-party, of all things! There is no cover at the dinner-table;  you can't even wear a hat; you must sit there in a glare for hours and  hours!\" And Rachel shuddered. \"Oh, don't let us go!\" she urged; but her  tone was neither pathetic nor despairing; though free from the faintest  accent of affection, it was, nevertheless, the tone of a woman who has  not always been denied.    \"I am afraid we must go,\" he said firmly, but not unkindly. \"You see, it  is in our honor--as I happen to know; for Venables gave me a hint when I  met him in the town the other day. He will take you in himself.\"    \"And what is he like?\"    \"Fond of his dinner; he won't worry you,\" said Steel, reassuringly. \"Nor  need you really bother your head about all that any more. Nobody has  recognized you yet; nobody is in the least likely to do so down here.  Don't you see how delightfully provincial they are? There's a local  lawyer, a pillar of all the virtues, who has misappropriated his own  daughter-in-law's marriage portion and fled the country with the  principal boy in their last pantomime; there are a lot of smart young  fellows who are making a sporting thousand every other day out of iron  warrants; the district's looking up after thirty years' bad times; and  this is the sort of thing it's talking about. These are its heroes and  its villains. All you hear from London is what the last man spent when  he was up, and where he dined; and from all I can gather, the Tichborne  trial made less impression down here than that of a Delverton parson who  got into trouble about the same time.\"    \"They must have heard of my trial,\" said Rachel, in a low voice. They  were walking in the grounds after breakfast, but she looked round before  speaking at all.    \"They would glance at it,\" said Steel, with a shrug; \"an occasional  schoolboy might read it through; but even if you were guilty, and were  here on view, you would command much less attention than the local  malefactor in an infinitely smaller way. I am sorry I put it quite like  that,\" added Steel, as Rachel winced, \"but I feel convinced about it,  and only wish I could convince you.\"    And he did so, more or less; but the fear of recognition had increased  in Rachel, instead of abating, as time went on. It had increased  especially since the rapid ripening of her acquaintance with Morna  Woodgate into the intimacy which already subsisted between the two young  wives. Rachel had told her husband that she would not have Morna know  for anything; and he had appeared in his own dark way to sympathize with  a solicitude which was more actual than necessary; but that was perhaps  because he approved of Mrs. Woodgate on his own account. And so rare was  that approval, as a positive and known quantity, yet so marked in this  case, that he usually contrived to share Morna's society with his wife.    \"You shall not monopolize Mrs. Woodgate,\" he would say with all urbanity  as he joined them when least expected. \"I was first in the field, you  know!\"    And in the field he would remain. There were no commands, no wishes to  obey in the matter, no embargo upon the comings and goings between the  two new friends. But Mr. Steel invariably appeared upon the scene as  well. The good vicar attributed it to the elderly bridegroom's jealous  infatuation for his beautiful young bride; but Morna knew better from  the first.    \"Are you going?\" asked Rachel, eagerly, when she and Morna met again;  indeed, she had gone expressly to the Vicarage to ask the question; and  not until she had seen the Woodgates' invitation could Steel himself  induce her to answer theirs.    The Woodgates were going. Morna was already in alternate fits of despair  and of ideas about her dress.    \"I wish I might dress you!\" said Rachel, knowing her well enough already  to say that. \"I have wardrobes full of them, and yet my husband insists  upon taking me up to London to get something fit to wear!\"    \"But not necessarily on your back!\" cried Steel himself, appearing at  that moment in his usual way, warm, breathless, but only playfully put  out. \"My dear Mrs. Woodgate, I must have a special wire between your  house and ours. One thing, however, I always know where to find her! Did  she tell you we go by the 12:55 from Northborough?\"    It was something to wear upon her neck--a diamond necklet of superb  stones, gradually swelling to one of the first water at the throat; and  Rachel duly wore it at the dinner-party, with a rich gown of bridal  white, whose dazzling purity had perhaps the effect of cancelling the  bride's own pallor. But she was very pale. It was her first appearance  at a gathering of the kind, not only there in Delverton, but anywhere  at all since her second marriage. And the invitation had been of the  correct, most ample length; it had had time to wind itself about  Rachel's nerves.    Mr. Venables, who of course did take her in, by no means belied her  husband's description of him; he was a rotund man with a high  complexion, and his bulging eye was on the menu before his soft body had  sunk into his chair. His conversation proved limited, but strictly to  the point; he told Rachel what to eat, and once or twice what to avoid;  lavished impersonal praise upon one dish, impartial criticisms upon  another, and only spoke between the courses. It was a large  dinner-party; twenty-two sat down. Rachel was at last driven to glancing  at the other twenty.    To the man on her left she had not been introduced, but he had offered  one or two civil observations while Mr. Venables was better engaged;  and, after the second, Rachel had chanced to catch sight of the card  upon which his name had been inscribed. He was, it seemed, a Mr.  Langholm; and all at once Rachel leant back and looked at him. He was a  loose-limbed, round-shouldered man, with a fine open countenance, and a  great disorderly moustache; his hair might have been shorter, and his  dress-coat shone where it caught the light. Rachel put the screw upon  her courage.    \"These cards,\" she said, with a glimpse of her own colonial self, \"are  very handy when one hasn't been introduced. Your name is not very  common, is it?\"    \"Not very,\" he answered, \"spelt like that.\"    \"Yes it's spelt the same way as the Mr. Langholm who writes.\"    \"It is.\"    \"Then are you any relation?\"    \"I am the man himself,\" said Langholm, with quite a hearty laugh,  accompanied by a flush of pleasurable embarrassment. He was not a  particularly popular writer, and this did not happen to him every day.    \"I hoped you were,\" said Rachel, as she helped herself to the first  _entree_.    \"Then you haven't read my books,\" he chuckled, \"and you never must.\"    \"But I have,\" protested Rachel, quite flushed in her turn by the small  excitement. \"I read heaps of them in Tauchnitz when we were abroad. But  I had no idea that I should ever meet you in the flesh!\"    \"Really?\" he said. \"Then that's funnier still; but I suppose Mr. Steel  didn't want to frighten you. We saw quite a lot of each other last year;  he wrote to me from Florence before you came over; and I should have  paid my respects long ago, but I have been up in town, and only just  come back.\"    The flush had died out of Rachel's face. Her husband told her  nothing--nothing! In her indignation she was tempted to say so to the  stranger; she had to think a moment what to say instead. A falsehood of  any sort was always a peculiar difficulty to Rachel, a constitutional  aversion, and it cost her an effort to remark at last that it was very  stupid of her, she had quite forgotten, but now she remembered--of  course! And with that she turned to her host, who was offering an  observation across his empty plate.    \"Strange thing, Mrs. Steel, but you can't get the meat in the country  that you can in town. Those fillets, now--I wish you could taste 'em at  my club; but we give our chef a thousand a year, and he drives up every  day in his brougham.\"    The novels of Charles Langholm were chiefly remarkable for their  intricate plots, and for the hope of better things that breathed through  the cheap sensation of the best of them. But it was a hope that had been  deferred a good many years. His manner was better than his matter;  indeed, an incongruous polish was said by the literary to prevent  Langholm from being a first favorite either with the great public or the  little critics. As a maker of plots, however, he still had humble  points; and Rachel assured him that she had burnt her candle all night  in order to solve one of his ingenious mysteries.    \"What!\" he cried; \"you call yourself a lady, and you don't look at the  end before you reach it?\"    \"Not when it's a good book.\"    \"Well, you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1261"],[0,"Betty Zane (#17)"],[1," he bats his eyes,\" and she laughed gleefully  as she gingerly picked up the fish by the tail and dropped him into  the water. \"Now, Mr. Goggle-eye, if you are wise, in future you will  beware of tempting looking bugs.\"    For an hour they had splendid sport. The pool teemed with sunfish.  The bait would scarcely touch the water when the little orange  colored fellows would rush for it. Now and then a black bass darted  wickedly through the school of sunfish and stole the morsel from  them. Or a sharp-nosed fiery-eyed pickerel--vulture of the  water--rising to the surface, and, supreme in his indifference to  man or fish, would swim lazily round until he had discovered the  cause of all this commotion among the smaller fishes, and then,  opening wide his jaws would take the bait with one voracious snap.    Presently something took hold of Betty's line and moved out toward  the middle of the pool. She struck and the next instant her rod was  bent double and the tip under water.    \"Pull your rod up!\" shouted Alfred. \"Here, hand it to me.\"    But it was too late. A surge right and left, a vicious tug, and  Betty's line floated on the surface of the water.    \"Now, isn't that too bad? He has broken my line. Goodness, I never  before felt such a strong fish. What shall I do?\"    \"You should be thankful you were not pulled in. I have been in a  state of fear ever since we commenced fishing. You move round in  this canoe as though it were a raft. Let me paddle out to that  little ripple and try once there; then we will stop. I know you are  tired.\"    Near the center of the pool a half submerged rock checked the  current and caused a little ripple of the water. Several times  Alfred had seen the dark shadow of a large fish followed by a swirl  of the water, and the frantic leaping of little bright-sided minnows  in all directions. As his hook, baited with a lively shiner, floated  over the spot, a long, yellow object shot from out that shaded lair.  There was a splash, not unlike that made by the sharp edge of a  paddle impelled by a short, powerful stroke, the minnow disappeared,  and the broad tail of the fish flapped on the water. The instant  Alfred struck, the water boiled and the big fish leaped clear into  the air, shaking himself convulsively to get rid of the hook. He  made mad rushes up and down the pool, under the canoe, into the  swift current and against the rocks, but all to no avail. Steadily  Alfred increased the strain on the line and gradually it began to  tell, for the plunges of the fish became shorter and less frequent.  Once again, in a last magnificent effort, he leaped straight into  the air, and failing to get loose, gave up the struggle and was  drawn gasping and exhausted to the side of the canoe.    \"Are you afraid to touch him?\" asked Alfred.    \"Indeed I am not,\" answered Betty.    \"Then run your hand gently down the line, slip your fingers in under  his gills and lift him over the side carefully.\"    \"Five pounds,\" exclaimed Alfred, when the fish lay at his feet.  \"This is the largest black bass I ever caught. It is pity to take  such a beautiful fish out of his element.\"    \"Let him go, then. May I?\" said Betty.    \"No, you have allowed them all to go, even the pickerel which I  think ought to be killed. We will keep this fellow alive, and place  him in that nice clear pool over in the fort-yard.\"    \"I like to watch you play a fish,\" said Betty. \"Jonathan always  hauls them right out. You are so skillful. You let this fish run so  far and then you checked him. Then you gave him a line to go the  other way, and no doubt he felt free once more when you stopped him  again.\"    \"You are expressing a sentiment which has been, is, and always will  be particularly pleasing to the fair sex, I believe,\" observed  Alfred, smiling rather grimly as he wound up his line.    \"Would you mind being explicit?\" she questioned.    Alfred had laughed and was about to answer when the whip-like crack  of a rifle came from the hillside. The echoes of the shot  reverberated from hill to hill and were finally lost far down the  valley.    \"What can that be?\" exclaimed Alfred anxiously, recalling Colonel  Zane's odd manner when they were about to leave the house.    \"I am not sure, but I think that is my turkey, unless Lew Wetzel  happened to miss his aim,\" said Betty, laughing. \"And that is such  an unprecedented thing that it can hardly be considered. Turkeys are  scarce this season. Jonathan says the foxes and wolves ate up the  broods. Lew heard this turkey calling and he made little Harry  Bennet, who had started out with his gun, stay at home and went  after Mr. Gobbler himself.\"    \"Is that all? Well, that is nothing to get alarmed about, is it? I  actually had a feeling of fear, or a presentiment, we might say.\"    They beached the canoe and spread out the lunch in the shade near  the spring. Alfred threw himself at length upon the grass and Betty  sat leaning against the tree. She took a biscuit in one hand, a  pickle in the other, and began to chat volubly to Alfred of her  school life, and of Philadelphia, and the friends she had made  there. At length, remarking his abstraction, she said: \"You are not  listening to me.\"    \"I beg your pardon. My thoughts did wander. I was thinking of my  mother. Something about you reminds me of her. I do not know what,  unless it is that little mannerism you have of pursing up your lips  when you hesitate or stop to think.\"    \"Tell me of her,\" said Betty, seeing his softened mood.    \"My mother was very beautiful, and as good as she was lovely. I  never had a care until my father died. Then she married again, and  as I did not get on with my step-father I ran away from home. I have  not been in Virginia for four years.\"    \"Do you get homesick?\"    \"Indeed I do. While at Fort Pitt I used to have spells of the blues  which lasted for days. For a time I felt more contented here. But I  fear the old fever of restlessness will come over me again. I can  speak freely to you because I know you will understand, and I feel  sure of your sympathy. My father wanted me to be a minister. He sent  me to the theological seminary at Princeton, where for two years I  tried to study. Then my father died. I went home and looked after  things until my mother married again. That changed everything for  me. I ran away and have since been a wanderer. I feel that I am not  lazy, that I am not afraid of work, but four years have drifted by  and I have nothing to show for it. I am discouraged. Perhaps that is  wrong, but tell me how I can help it. I have not the stoicism of the  hunter, Wetzel, nor have I the philosophy of your brother. I could  not be content to sit on my doorstep and smoke my pipe and watch the  wheat and corn grow. And then, this life of the borderman, environed  as it is by untold dangers, leads me, fascinates me, and yet appalls  me with the fear that here I shall fall a victim to an Indian's  bullet or spear, and find a nameless grave.\"    A long silence ensued. Alfred had spoken quietly, but with an  undercurrent of bitterness that saddened Betty. For the first time  she saw a shadow of pain in his eyes. She looked away down the  valley, not seeing the brown and gold hills boldly defined against  the blue sky, nor the beauty of the river as the setting sun cast a  ruddy glow on the water. Her companion's words had touched an  unknown chord in her heart. When finally she turned to answer him a  beautiful light shone in her eyes, a light that shines not on land  or sea--the light of woman's hope.    \"Mr. Clarke,\" she said, and her voice was soft and low, \"I am only a  girl, but I can understand. You are unhappy. Try to rise above it.  Who knows what will befall this little settlement? It may be swept  away by the savages, and it may grow to be a mighty city. It must  take that chance. So must you, so must we all take chances. You are  here. Find your work and do it cheerfully, honestly, and let the  future take care of itself. And let me say--do not be  offended--beware of idleness and drink. They are as great a  danger--nay, greater than the Indians.\"    \"Miss Zane, if you were to ask me not to drink I would never touch a  drop again,\" said Alfred, earnestly.    \"I did not ask that,\" answered Betty, flushing slightly. \"But I  shall remember it as a promise and some day I may ask it of you.\"    He looked wonderingly at the girl beside him. He had spent most of  his life among educated and cultured people. He had passed several  years in the backwoods. But with all his experience with people he  had to confess that this young woman was as a revelation to him. She  could ride like an Indian and shoot like a hunter. He had heard that  she could run almost as swiftly as her brothers. Evidently she  feared nothing, for he had just seen an example of her courage in a  deed that had tried even his own nerve, and, withal, she was a  bright, happy girl, earnest and true, possessing all the softer  graces of his sisters, and that exquisite touch of feminine delicacy  and refinement which appeals more to men than any other virtue.    \"Have you not met Mr. Miller before he came here from Fort Pitt?\"  asked Betty.    \"Why do you ask?\"    \"I think he mentioned something of the kind.\"    \"What else did he say?\"    \"Why--Mr. Clarke, I hardly remember.\"    \"I see,\" said Alfred, his face darkening. \"He has talked about me. I  do not care what he said. I knew him at Fort Pitt, and we had  trouble there. I venture to say he has told no one about it. He  certainly would not shine in the story. But I am not a tattler.\"    \"It is not very difficult to see that you do not like him. Jonathan  does not, either. He says Mr. Miller was friendly with McKee, and  the notorious Simon Girty, the soldiers who deserted from Fort Pitt  and went to the Indians. The girls like him however.\"    \"Usually if a man is good looking and pleasant that is enough for  the girls. I noticed that he paid you a"]]]
