This  discouraging and alarming calamity was not the first that had overtaken  them. Since leaving the settlements, they had met with nothing but  misfortune. Some of their party had died; one man had been killed by the  Pawnees; and about a week before, they had been plundered by the Dakotas  of all their best horses, the wretched animals on which our visitors  were mounted being the only ones that were left. They had encamped, they  told us, near sunset, by the side of the Platte, and their oxen were  scattered over the meadow, while the band of horses were feeding a  little farther off. Suddenly the ridges of the hills were alive with a  swarm of mounted Indians, at least six hundred in number, who, with a  tremendous yell, came pouring down toward the camp, rushing up within a  few rods, to the great terror of the emigrants; but suddenly wheeling,  they swept around the band of horses, and in five minutes had  disappeared with their prey through the openings of the hills.    As these emigrants were telling their story, we saw four other  men approaching. They proved to be R. and his companions, who had  encountered no mischance of any kind, but had only wandered too far  in pursuit of the game. They said they had seen no Indians, but only  \"millions of buffalo\"; and both R. and Sorel had meat dangling behind  their saddles.    The emigrants re-crossed the river, and we prepared to follow. First  the heavy ox-wagons plunged down the bank, and dragged slowly over the  sand-beds; sometimes the hoofs of the oxen were scarcely wetted by the  thin sheet of water; and the next moment the river would be boiling  against their sides, and eddying fiercely around the wheels. Inch by  inch they receded from the shore, dwindling every moment, until at  length they seemed to be floating far in the very middle of the river.  A more critical experiment awaited us; for our little mule-cart was  but ill-fitted for the passage of so swift a stream. We watched it with  anxiety till it seemed to be a little motionless white speck in the  midst of the waters; and it WAS motionless, for it had stuck fast in a  quicksand. The little mules were losing their footing, the wheels were  sinking deeper and deeper, and the water began to rise through the  bottom and drench the goods within. All of us who had remained on the  hither bank galloped to the rescue; the men jumped into the water,  adding their strength to that of the mules, until by much effort the  cart was extricated, and conveyed in safety across.    As we gained the other bank, a rough group of men surrounded us. They  were not robust, nor large of frame, yet they had an aspect of hardy  endurance. Finding at home no scope for their fiery energies, they had  betaken themselves to the prairie; and in them seemed to be revived,  with redoubled force, that fierce spirit which impelled their ancestors,  scarce more lawless than themselves, from the German forests, to  inundate Europe and break to pieces the Roman empire. A fortnight  afterward this unfortunate party passed Fort Laramie, while we were  there. Not one of their missing oxen had been recovered, though they had  remained encamped a week in search of them; and they had been compelled  to abandon a great part of their baggage and provisions, and yoke cows  and heifers to their wagons to carry them forward upon their journey,  the most toilsome and hazardous part of which lay still before them.    It is worth noticing that on the Platte one may sometimes see the  shattered wrecks of ancient claw-footed tables, well waxed and rubbed,  or massive bureaus of carved oak. These, many of them no doubt  the relics of ancestral prosperity in the colonial time, must have  encountered strange vicissitudes. Imported, perhaps, originally from  England; then, with the declining fortunes of their owners, borne across  the Alleghenies to the remote wilderness of Ohio or Kentucky; then to  Illinois or Missouri; and now at last fondly stowed away in the family  wagon for the interminable journey to Oregon. But the stern privations  of the way are little anticipated. The cherished relic is soon flung out  to scorch and crack upon the hot prairie.    We resumed our journey; but we had gone scarcely a mile, when R. called  out from the rear:    \"We'll camp here.\"    \"Why do you want to camp? Look at the sun. It is not three o'clock yet.\"    \"We'll camp here!\"    This was the only reply vouchsafed. Delorier was in advance with his  cart. Seeing the mule-wagon wheeling from the track, he began to turn  his own team in the same direction.    \"Go on, Delorier,\" and the little cart advanced again. As we rode on, we  soon heard the wagon of our confederates creaking and jolting on behind  us, and the driver, Wright, discharging a furious volley of oaths  against his mules; no doubt venting upon them the wrath which he dared  not direct against a more appropriate object.    Something of this sort had frequently occurred. Our English friend was  by no means partial to us, and we thought we discovered in his conduct a  deliberate intention to thwart and annoy us, especially by retarding  the movements of the party, which he knew that we, being Yankees, were  anxious to quicken. Therefore, he would insist on encamping at all  unseasonable hours, saying that fifteen miles was a sufficient day's  journey. Finding our wishes systematically disregarded, we took the  direction of affairs into our own hands. Keeping always in advance, to  the inexpressible indignation of R., we encamped at what time and place  we thought proper, not much caring whether the rest chose to follow or  not. They always did so, however, pitching their tents near ours, with  sullen and wrathful countenances.    Traveling together on these agreeable terms did not suit our tastes; for  some time we had meditated a separation. The connection with this party  had cost us various delays and inconveniences; and the glaring want  of courtesy and good sense displayed by their virtual leader did not  dispose us to bear these annoyances with much patience. We resolved to  leave camp early in the morning, and push forward as rapidly as possible  for Fort Laramie, which we hoped to reach, by hard traveling, in four or  five days. The captain soon trotted up between us, and we explained our  intentions.    \"A very extraordinary proceeding, upon my word!\" he remarked. Then he  began to enlarge upon the enormity of the design. The most prominent  impression in his mind evidently was that we were acting a base and  treacherous part in deserting his party, in what he considered a very  dangerous stage of the journey. To palliate the atrocity of our conduct,  we ventured to suggest that we were only four in number while his party  still included sixteen men; and as, moreover, we were to go forward  and they were to follow, at least a full proportion of the perils he  apprehended would fall upon us. But the austerity of the captain's  features would not relax. \"A very extraordinary proceeding, gentlemen!\"  and repeating this, he rode off to confer with his principal.    By good luck, we found a meadow of fresh grass, and a large pool of  rain-water in the midst of it. We encamped here at sunset. Plenty of  buffalo skulls were lying around, bleaching in the sun; and sprinkled  thickly among the grass was a great variety of strange flowers. I had  nothing else to do, and so gathering a handful, I sat down on a buffalo  skull to study them. Although the offspring of a wilderness, their  texture was frail and delicate, and their colors extremely rich; pure  white, dark blue, and a transparent crimson. One traveling in this  country seldom has leisure to think of anything but the stern features  of the scenery and its accompaniments, or the practical details of each  day's journey. Like them, he and his thoughts grow hard and rough. But  now these flowers suddenly awakened a train of associations as alien to  the rude scene around me as they were themselves; and for the moment my  thoughts went back to New England. A throng of fair and well-remembered  faces rose, vividly as life, before me. \"There are good things,\" thought  I, \"in the savage life, but what can it offer to replace those powerful  and ennobling influences that can reach unimpaired over more than three  thousand miles of mountains, forests and deserts?\"    Before sunrise on the next morning our tent was down; we harnessed our  best horses to the cart and left the camp. But first we shook hands  with our friends the emigrants, who sincerely wished us a safe journey,  though some others of the party might easily have been consoled had we  encountered an Indian war party on the way. The captain and his brother  were standing on the top of a hill, wrapped in their plaids, like  spirits of the mist, keeping an anxious eye on the band of horses below.  We waved adieu to them as we rode off the ground. The captain replied  with a salutation of the utmost dignity, which Jack tried to imitate;  but being little practiced in the gestures of polite society, his effort  was not a very successful one.    In five minutes we had gained the foot of the hills, but here we came to  a stop. Old Hendrick was in the shafts, and being the very incarnation  of perverse and brutish obstinacy, he utterly refused to move. Delorier  lashed and swore till he was tired, but Hendrick stood like a rock,  grumbling to himself and looking askance at his enemy, until he saw a  favorable opportunity to take his revenge, when he struck out under the  shaft with such cool malignity of intention that Delorier only escaped  the blow by a sudden skip into the air, such as no one but a Frenchman  could achieve. Shaw and he then joined forces, and lashed on both sides  at once.

At the  time when these prescriptions acquired their definite form, Islam ruled an  important portion of the world; it considered the conquest of the rest  as being only a question of time; and, therefore, felt itself quite  independent in the development of its law. There was little reason indeed  for the Moslim canonists to take into serious account the interests of men  not subject to Mohammedan authority or to care for the opinion of devotees  of other religions. Islam might act, and did almost act, as if it were the  only power in the world; it did so in the way of a grand seigneur, showing  a great amount of generosity towards its subjugated enemies. The adherents  of other religions were or would become subjects of the Commander of the  Faithful; those subjects were given a full claim on Mohammedan protection  and justice; while the independent unbelievers were in general to be  treated as enemies until in submission. Their spiritual life deserved not  even so much attention as that of Islam received from Abbe Maracci or  Doctor Prideaux. The false doctrines of other peoples were of no interest  whatever in themselves; and, since there was no fear of Mohammedans being  tainted by them, polemics against the abrogated religions were more of a  pastime than an indispensable part of theology. The Mohammedan community  being in a sense Allah's army, with the conquest of the world as its  object, apostasy deserved the punishment of death in no lesser degree than  desertion in the holy war, nay more so; for the latter might be the effect  of cowardice, whereas the former was an act of inexcusable treachery.    In the attitude of Islam towards other religions there is hardly one  feature that has not its counterpart in the practice of Christian states  during the Middle Ages. The great difference is that the Mohammedan  community erected this medieval custom into a system unalterable like all  prescriptions based on its infallible \"Agreement\" (Ijma'). Here lay the  great difficulty when the nineteenth and twentieth centuries placed the  Moslim world face to face with a civilization that had sprung up outside  its borders and without its collaboration, that was from a spiritual point  of view by far its superior and at the same time possessed of sufficient  material power to thrust the Mohammedans aside wherever they seemed to be  an impediment in its way. A long series of the most painful experiences,  meaning as many encroachments upon the political independence of Mohammedan  territories, ended by teaching Islam that it had definitely to change its  lines of conduct. The times were gone when relations with the non-Musulman  world quite different from those foreseen by the mediaeval theory might  be considered as exceptions to the rule, as temporary concessions to  transitory necessities. In ever wider circles a thorough revision of the  system came to be considered as a requirement of the time. The fact that  the number of Mohammedans subject to foreign rule increased enormously, and  by far surpassed those of the citizens of independent Mohammedan states,  made the problem almost as interesting to Western nations as to the  Mohammedans themselves. Both parties are almost equally concerned in the  question, whether a way will be found to associate the Moslim world to  modern civilization, without obliging it to empty its spiritual treasury  altogether. Nobody can in earnest advocate the idea of leaving the solution  of the problem to rude force. The Moslim of yore, going through the world  with the Qoran in one hand, the sword in the other, giving unbelievers the  choice between conversion or death, is a creation of legendary fancy. We  can but hope that modern civilization will not be so fanatical against  Moslims, as the latter were unjustly said to have been during the period  of their power. If the modern world were only to offer the Mohammedans the  choice between giving up at once the traditions of their ancestors or being  treated as barbarians, there would be sure to ensue a struggle as bloody as  has ever been witnessed in the world. It is worth while indeed to examine  the system of Islam from this special point of view, and to try to find the  terms on which a durable _modus vivendi_ might be established between Islam  and modern thought.    The purely dogmatic part is not of great importance. Some of us may admire  the tenets of the Mohammedan doctrine, others may as heartily despise them;  to the participation of Mohammedans in the civilized life of our days they  are as innoxious as any other mediaeval dogmatic system that counts its  millions of adherents among ourselves. The details of Mohammedan dogmatics  have long ceased to interest other circles than those of professional  theologians; the chief points arouse no discussion and the deviations in  popular superstition as well as in philosophical thought which in practice  meet with toleration are almost unlimited. The Mohammedan Hell claims  the souls of all heterodox people, it is true; but this does not prevent  benevolent intercourse in this world, and more enlightened Moslims are  inclined to enlarge their definition of the word \"faithful\" so as to  include their non-Mohammedan friends. The faith in a Mahdi, who will come  to regenerate the world, is apt to give rise to revolutionary movements led  by skilful demagogues pretending to act as the \"Guided One,\" or, at least,  to prepare the way for his coming. Most of the European powers having  Mohammedan subjects have had their disagreeable experiences in this  respect. But Moslim chiefs of states have their obvious good reasons for  not liking such movements either; and even the majority of ordinary Moslims  look upon candidates for Mahdi-ship with suspicion. A contented prosperous  population offers such candidates little chance of success.    The ritual laws of Islam are a heavy burden to those who strictly observe  them; a man who has to perform worship five times a day in a state of  ritual purity and during a whole month in a year has to abstain from  food and drink and other enjoyments from daybreak until sunset, is at a  disadvantage when he has to enter into competition with non-Musulmans  for getting work of any kind. But since most of the Moslims have become  subjects of foreign powers and religious police has been practically  abolished in Mohammedan states, there is no external compulsion. The ever  smaller minority of strict practisers make use of a right which nobody can  contest.    Drinking wine or other intoxicating drinks, taking interest on money,  gambling--including even insurance contracts according to the stricter  interpretation--are things which a Moslim may abstain from without  hindering non-Mohammedans; or which in our days he may do, notwithstanding  the prohibition of divine law, even without losing his good name.    Those who want to accentuate the antithesis between Islam and modern  civilization point rightly to the personal law; here is indeed a great  stumbling-block. The allowance of polygamy up to a maximum of four wives  is represented by Mohammedan authors as a progress if compared with the  irregularity of pagan Arabia and even with the acknowledgment of unlimited  polygamy during certain periods of Biblical history. The following subtle  argument is to be found in some schoolbooks on Mohammedan law: The law of  Moses was exceedingly benevolent to males by permitting them to have an  unlimited number of wives; then came the law of Jesus, extreme on the other  side by prescribing monogamy; at last Mohammed restored the equilibrium by  conceding one wife to each of the four humours which make up the male's  constitution. This theory, which leaves the question what the woman is  to do with three of her four humours undecided, will hardly find fervent  advocates among the present canonists. At the same time, very few of them  would venture to pronounce their preference for monogamy in a general way,  polygamy forming a part of the law that is to prevail, according to the  infallible Agreement of the Community, until the Day of Resurrection.    On the other side polygamy, although _allowed_, is far from being  _recommended_ by the majority of theologians. Many of them even dissuade  men capable of mastering their passion from marriage in general, and  censure a man who takes two wives if he can live honestly with one. In some  Mohammedan countries social circumstances enforce practical monogamy. The  whole question lies in the education of women; when this has been raised to  a higher level, polygamy will necessarily come to an end. It is therefore  most satisfactory that among male Mohammedans the persuasion of the  necessity of a solid education for girls is daily gaining ground. This year  (1913), a young Egyptian took his doctor's degree at the Paris University  by sustaining a dissertation on the position of women in the Moslim world,  in which he told his co-religionists the full truth concerning this rather  delicate subject[1]. If social evolution takes the right course, the  practice of polygamy will be abolished; and the maintenance of its  lawfulness in canonical works will mainly be a survival of a bygone phase  of development.
