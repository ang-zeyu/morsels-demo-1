And further, the spirit of Jehovah came upon them,  as it did upon Deborah the prophetess, and as it did still more  remarkably upon Moses himself.    The last and greatest of these extemporized leaders called Judges, was  Samuel. In him the people learned to put their trust; and the national  assembly which he summoned was completely guided by him. No one of the  Judges, it would seem, had his seat of government in any central city,  but where he happened to live. So the residence of Samuel was at his  native town of Ramah, where he married. It would seem that he travelled  from city to city to administer justice, like the judges of England on  their circuits; but, unlike them, on his own supreme authority,--not  with power delegated by a king, but acknowledging no superior except God  himself, from whom he received his commission. We know not at what time  and whom he married; but his two sons, who in his old age shared power  with him, did not discharge their delegated functions more honorably  than the sons of Eli, who had been a disgrace to their office, to their  father, and to the nation. One of the greatest mysteries of human life  is the seeming inability of pious fathers to check the vices of their  children, who often go astray under an apparently irresistible impulse  or innate depravity, in spite of parental precept and example,--thus  seeming to show that neither virtue nor vice can be surely transmitted,  and that every human being stands on his individual responsibility, with  peculiar temptations to combat, and peculiar circumstances to influence  him. The son of a saint becomes mysteriously a drunkard or a fraud, and  the son of a sensualist becomes an ascetic. This does not uniformly  occur: in fact, the sons of good men are more likely to be an honor to  their families than the sons of the wicked; but why are exceptions so  common as to be proverbial?    It was no light work which was imposed on the shoulders of Samuel,--to  establish law and order among the demoralized tribes of the Jews, and to  prepare them for political independence; and it was a still greater  labor to effect a moral reformation and reintroduce the worship of  Jehovah. Both of these objects he seems to have accomplished; and his  success places him in the list of great reformers, like Mohammed and  Luther,--but greater and better than either, since he did not attempt,  like the former, to bring about a good end by bad means; nor was he  stained by personal defects, like the latter. \"It was his object to  re-enkindle the national life of the nation, so as to combat  successfully its enemies in the field, which could be attained by  rousing a common religious feeling;\" for he saw that there could be no  true enthusiasm without a sense of dependence on the God of battles, and  that heroism could be stimulated only by exalted sentiments, both of  patriotism and religion.    But how was Samuel to rekindle a fervent religious life among the  degenerate Israelites in such unsettled times? Only by rousing the  people by his teachings and his eloquence. He was a preacher of  righteousness, and in all probability went from city to city and village  to village,--as Saint Bernard did when he preached a crusade against the  infidels, as John the Baptist did when he preached repentance, as  Whitefield did when he sought to kindle religious enthusiasm in England.  So he set himself to educate his countrymen in the great truths which  appealed to the inner life,--to the heart and conscience. This he did,  first, by rousing the slumbering spirits of the elders of tribes when  they sought his counsel as a prophet, the like of whom had not appeared  since Moses, so gifted and so earnest; and secondly, by founding a  school for the education of young men who should go with his  instructions wherever he chose to send them, like the early  missionaries, to hamlets and villages which he was unable to visit in  person. The first \"school of the prophets\" was a seminary of  missionaries, animated by the spirit of a teacher whom they feared and  admired as no prophet had been revered in the whole history of the  nation since Moses.    Samuel communicated his own burning spirit wherever he went, and the  burden of his eloquence was zeal and loyalty for Jehovah. Before his  time the prophets had been known as seers; but Samuel superadded the  duties of a religious teacher,--the spokesman of the Almighty. The  number of his disciples, whom he doubtless commissioned as evangelists,  must have been very large. They lived in communities and ate in common,  like the primitive monks. They probably resembled the early Dominican  and Franciscan friars of the Middle Ages, who were kindled to enthusiasm  by such teachers as Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventura. Like them they were  ascetics in their habits and dress, wearing sheepskins, and living on  locusts and wild honey,--on the fruits which grew spontaneously in the  rich valleys of their well-watered country. It did not require much  learning to arouse the common people to new duties and a higher  religious life. The Bible does not inform us as to the details by which  Samuel made his influence felt, but there can be no doubt that by some  means he kindled a religious life before unknown among his countrymen.  He infused courage and hope into their despairing hearts, and laid the  foundation of military enthusiasm by combining with it religious ardor;  so that by the discipline of forty years,--the same period employed by  Moses in transmuting a horde of slaves into a national host of warriors;  a period long enough to drop out the corrupted elements and replace  them with the better trained rising generation,--the nation was prepared  for accomplishing the victories of Saul and David. But for Samuel no  great captains would have arisen to lead the scattered and dispirited  hosts of Israel against the Philistines and other enemies. He was thus a  political leader as well as a religious teacher, combining the offices  of judge and prophet. Everybody felt that he was directly commissioned  by God, and his words had the force of inspiration. He reigned with as  much power as a king over all the tribes, though clad in the garments of  humility. Who in all Israel was greater than he, even after he had  anointed Saul to the kingly office?    The great outward event in the life of Samuel was the transition of the  Israelites from a theocratic to a monarchical government. It was a  political revolution, and like all revolutions was fraught with both  good and evil, yet seemingly demanded by the spirit of the times,--in  one sense an advance in civilization, in another a retrogression in  primeval virtues. It resulted in a great progress in material arts,  culture, and power, but also in a decline in those simplicities that  favor a religious life, on which the strength of man is apparently  built,--that is, a state of society in which man in his ordinary life  draws nearest to his Maker, to his kindred, and his home; to which  luxury and demoralizing pleasures are unknown; a life free from  temptations and intellectual snares, from political ambition and social  unrest, from recognized injustice and stinging inequalities. The  historian with his theory of development might call this revolution the  change from national youth to manhood, the emerging from the dark ages  of Hebrew history to a period of national aggrandizement and growth in  civilization,--one of the necessary changes which must take place if a  nation would become strong, powerful, and cultivated. To the eye of the  contemplative, conservative, and God-fearing Samuel this change of  government seemed full of perils and dangers, for which the nation was  not fully prepared. He felt it to be a change which might wean the  Israelites from their new sense of dependence on God, the only hope of  nations, and which might favor another lapse to pagan idolatries and a  decline in household virtues, such as had been illustrated in the life  of Ruth and Boaz,--and hence might prove a mere exchange of that rugged  life which elevates the soul, for those gilded glories which adorn and  pamper the mortal body. He certainly foresaw and knew that the change in  government would produce tyranny, oppression, and injustice, from which  there could be no escape and for which there could be no redress, for he  told the people in detail just what they should suffer at the hands of  any king whom they might have; and these were in his eyes evils which  nothing could compensate,--the loss of liberty, the extinction of  personal independence, and a probable rebellion against the Supreme  Jehovah in the degrading worship of the gods of idolatrous nations.    When the people, therefore, under the guidance of so-called \"progressive  leaders,\" hankered for a government which would make them like other  nations, and demanded a king, the prophet was greatly moved and sore  displeased; and this displeasure was heightened by a bitter humiliation  when the elders reproached him because of the misgovernment of his own  sons. He could not at first say a word, in view of a demand apparently  justified by the conduct of the existing rulers. There was a just cause  of complaint. If his own sons would take bribes in rendering judgment,  who could be trusted? Civilization would say that there was needed a  stronger arm to punish crime and enforce the laws.    So Samuel, perplexed and disheartened, fearing that the political  changes would be evil rather than good, and yet feeling unable to combat  the popular voice, sought wisdom in prayer. \"And the Lord said, hearken  unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee, for they  have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10479"],[0,"Our Churches and Chapels: Their Parsons, Priests, & Congregations (#17)"],[1,"may be in embryo; several maybe hanging on the skirts of  conviction, ready for a goodly plunge into reality; but that is the  number of mortals at present associated with the \"New Church  signified by the New Jerusalem,\" in Preston. All of them are  earnest, the bulk are conscientious, and on that account entitled to  respect. About a quarter of a century ago, a few sincere  Swedenborgians met in an office down Cannon-street, which is now  used as a gilding room by a modern Revivalist. They pushed \"the  cause\" with a fair amount of energy, and increased, though by slow  degrees, the number of their members. During the period of their  spiritual exercises here, the late Mr. Hugh Becconsall, a calm,  benevolent-hearted man, got associated with them, and this was the  means of bringing into fuller life the principles of Swedenborg in  Preston. Mr. Becconsall's thoughts were quickened and changed by  them; he became a devoted and sincere believer in the new Church;  attended its meetings in Cannon-street; was impressed with the idea  that better accomodation was required for them; and finally decided  to build out of his own pocket, and endow from the same source, a  new church in Avenham-road. It was estimated that the cost of the  church would be 1000 pounds, which Mr. Becconsall willingly agreed  to pay; but religion has no aegis against \"extras\"--they will creep  in, are irrepressible; and, in accordance with this fatal  philosophy, the church in Avenham-road cost in the end nearly 2000  pounds, which he paid without even grumbling--a privilege all  Englishmen have the right to exercise freely after they have paid  the piper well. The foundation stone was laid in 1843, very soon  after which the Rev. James Bonwell, curate of Trinity Church,  Preston, made a virulent attack upon Swedenborgianism and its  followers. This gentleman, who was subsequently unrobed for  immorality, charged both the ministers of the New Church party and  all who listened to them, with the rebellion of Korah, Dathan, and  Abiram, and uttered language implying a wish that the earth would  open its mouth and swallow them up. The Rev. Augustus Clissold,  M.A., formerly collegian at Oxford, who is the only profound scholar  in England belonging to the New Church sect, ably answered him.  There are many smart polemics but very few great scholars in the  sect referred to. Twenty-five years ago New Jerusalem Church, in  Avenham-road, was opened, and the believers in it increased for some  time afterwards. Anything new is fashionable, and a new church  always gives an impetus to the number of its worshipers. Those  assembling at the church created much curiosity, and not a little  cynical criticism, at first. They even do so now. Ordinarily  orthodox people look down censoriously upon believers in \"the New  Jerusalem,\" and class them as a mysterious, visionary sect of  religionists, given up to dreams, pious eccentricity, and self-  righteousness. But they have, like other individuals, a reason for  their belief; if it is madness there is method in it; and they are  prepared to \"argue the point,\" and make a respectable disturbance if  their creed is assailed.    We shall not criticise their belief--neither praise nor condemn it--  but just give its chief points for the benefit of unknowing ones.  Here they are:  they believe in a trinity, not of persons but  essentials--love, wisdom, and power; they do not believe in the  doctrine of faith alone, but of faith conjoined with good works;  they do not believe in a vicarious atonement, but in a  reconciliation of man to God; they don't believe in a resurrection  of the material body, but a resuscitation of the spirit immediately  after physical death; they don't believe in a physical destruction  of the world by fire, but think that the world as it is now created  will continue to exist--for ever; they have no faith in the Noachian  deluge, and say that the sacred record of it refers to an inundation  of evil and not of water; finally they believe that there will be  marriages in heaven,--not wedding ring unions, not kissing,  courting, and quarrelling amalgamations, but conjunctions of  goodness with truth; and they have further an idea that there will  be \"prolifications\" in heaven, not of crying children with passions  for sucking bottles and sugar teats, but of truth and goodness.  Swedenborg, by whom they swear, believed in three heavens and three  hells; they have a similar idea, and fancy that common place  sinners, who think one heaven will meet all their requirements, and  that one hell will be too much for their nerves, are wrong.    New Jerusalem Church, in Preston, has a Sunday school beneath it--a  place obtained partly on the celestial and partly on the Irish  principle--by heightening the roof and lowering the foundations. The  school is pretty well managed; but its scholars are not numerous;  they number between 60 and 70, and there is no immediate prospect of  an increase. The endowment of the late Mr. Hugh Becconsall realises  100 pounds a-year for the minister--the Rev. E. D. Rendell, who has  been at the church ever since its opening; and the investment of a  sum of money by the late Mr. John Becconsall, of Ashton, who was a  great believer in Swedenborgianism, brings in on his behalf 50  pounds more. The minister once had a \"call\" to Accrington, where the  doctrines of the New Church obtain a very large number of admirers,  and in consequence of that call, which necessarily implied a better  salary, as well as a wider sphere of action, five 10 pounds notes  were added to his stipend here. He was appeased by those said notes.  Mr. Rendell also lives rent free in a house adjoining and belonging  to the church. Its situation renders the house very convenient; but  a position more distant would not have been very harrowing if  freedom from rent had accompanied its tenancy.    The Church is built of stone, and has a neat appearance, but the  approach to it is not very good. You have to mount a small flight of  steps to get to it, and their gradient is so acute that if you  should fall on them you would never proceed onward, nor lie still,  but wend your way in a rolling manner to the bottom. Internally the  church is one of the prettiest in Preston. It is not large; we don't  suppose it will accommodate more than about 250; but it is  peculiarly neat and pleasing. The walls are painted and slightly  ornamented; the windows are toned a little and bordered with  elegant, well-finished designs; the chancel is fronted with a gothic  arch painted in marble pattern and edged with gold; beyond there is  a circular window, stained in bright colours. At each end there is a  gallery--one which apparently contains nothing, whilst the other is  devoted to the choir. At one side of the chancel arch there is a  reading desk, which looks piously at a pulpit, made just like it, on  the opposite side. Few churches have windows in the roof; but this  has about four--at least they are circular lights, and, in  conjunction with the side windows, make the place very bright and  cheerful. At the bass of the chancel, beneath the gallery, and  behind the communion table, there are several paintings, some, if  not all, of which were executed by the minister, who has rather  vivid artistic conceptions. In the centre there is an open Bible,  and on each side the Decalogue, or something to that effect, for the  letters, although in gold, can't be seen very clearly at a distance.  Flanking these are sacred figures, which are too small to be  attractive at a greater distance than six yards. But in their  aggregate the representations look well, and they give a good finish  to the chancel. The seats are of various sizes; some will hold three  persons, others four, and a few about six.    The church is not well attended; hardly half of it is occupied  except upon special occasions. At present it appears to be a little  better patronised than formerly; but even now the congregation is  comparatively thin, and there will be no necessity for some time to  do anything in the shape of enlarging the building. If anything is  effected in this way during the present century one of two things  will certainly have to happen--either three times as many as those  now attending it will have to solicit admission, or those actually  visiting it will have to grow three times as stout in their  physiology. They are a quiet, pious-looking class of people who  frequent the church. They may, like their great apostle, have  seasons of inner rapture, and like him revel in the mysteries of the  Arcana Coelestia, but if so they keep the thing very subdued. They  never scream nor shout about anything, and would refuse to do so if  you asked them. Many of them are elderly people, with decorous  countenances; all of them, whether old or young, believe in good  suits; very few of them are wealthy; none of them seem very poor.  Calmness, with a disposition to find you a seat any time, and  provide you with books, characterises them. They have fixed  services, embracing prayers, lessons, psalms, hymns, and chants.  They have an excellent organ, which was given to the place by Mrs.  Becconsall; and their music is \"ever so fair.\" Their services, on  Sundays, are held in the morning and evening, and they can get to  the latter much easier and in much better time than to the former.    Once a month there is an afternoon instead of an evening service,  the minister having to officiate for a few of the followers of  Swedenborg at Blackburn, who can't afford to pay, or won't get, or  don't want, a regular expounder of their views. Mr. Rendell is a  rather learnedly-solemn kind of gentleman. Originally he was a  painter; but he had a greater passion for polemics than brushes, and  was eventually recommended to, and admitted into \"the Church\" as a  minister. He reads the scriptures and prays in black kid cloves, but  he shows the natural colour"]]]
