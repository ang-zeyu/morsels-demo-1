CHAPTER VIII    THE CONFERENCE OF JANUARY 10, 1919      It is with extreme reluctance, as the reader will understand, that I  make any reference to the conference which the President held with the  American Commissioners at the Hotel Crillon on January 10, because of  the personal nature of what occurred. It would be far more agreeable to  omit an account of this unpleasant episode. But without referring to it  I cannot satisfactorily explain the sudden decision I then reached to  take no further part in the preparation or revision of the text of the  Covenant of the League of Nations. Without explanation my subsequent  conduct would be, and not without reason, open to the charge of neglect  of duty and possibly of disloyalty. I do not feel called upon to rest  under that suspicion, or to remain silent when a brief statement of what  occurred at that conference will disclose the reason for the cessation  of my efforts to effect changes in the plan of world organization which  the President had prepared. In the circumstances there can be no  impropriety in disclosing the truth as to the cause for a course of  action when the course of action itself must be set forth to complete  the record and to explain an ignorance of the subsequent negotiations  regarding the League of Nations, an ignorance which has been the subject  of public comment. Certainly no one who participated in the conference  can object to the truth being known unless for personal reasons he  prefers that a false impression should go forth. After careful  consideration I can see no public reason for withholding the facts. At  this meeting, to which I refer, the President took up the provisions of  his original draft of a Covenant, which was at the time in typewritten  form, and indicated the features which he considered fundamental to the  proper organization of a League of Nations. I pointed out certain  provisions which appeared to me objectionable in principle or at least  of doubtful policy. Mr. Wilson, however, clearly indicated--at least so  I interpreted his words and manner--that he was not disposed to receive  these criticisms in good part and was unwilling to discuss them. He also  said with great candor and emphasis that he did not intend to have  lawyers drafting the treaty of peace. Although this declaration was  called forth by the statement that the legal advisers of the American  Commission had been, at my request, preparing an outline of a treaty, a  \"skeleton treaty\" in fact, the President's sweeping disapproval of  members of the legal profession participating in the treaty-making  seemed to be, and I believe was, intended to be notice to me that my  counsel was unwelcome. Being the only lawyer on the delegation I  naturally took this remark to myself, and I know that other American  Commissioners held the same view of its purpose. If my belief was  unjustified, I can only regret that I did not persevere in my criticisms  and suggestions, but I could not do so believing as I then did that a  lawyer's advice on any question not wholly legal in nature was  unacceptable to the President, a belief which, up to the present time, I  have had no reason to change.    It should be understood that this account of the conference of January  10 is given by way of explanation of my conduct subsequent to it and not  in any spirit of complaint or condemnation of Mr. Wilson's attitude. He  had a right to his own opinion of the worth of a lawyer's advice and a  right to act in accordance with that opinion. If there was any injustice  done, it was in his asking a lawyer to become a Peace Commissioner,  thereby giving the impression that he desired his counsel and advice as  to the negotiations in general, when in fact he did not. But,  disregarding the personal element, I consider that he was justified in  his course, as the entire constitutional responsibility for the  negotiation of a treaty was on his shoulders and he was, in the  performance of his duty, entitled to seek advice from those only in  whose judgment he had confidence.    In spite of this frank avowal of prejudice by the President there was no  outward change in the personal and official relations between him and  myself. The breach, however, regardless of appearances, was too wide and  too deep to be healed. While subsequent events bridged it temporarily,  it remained until my association with President Wilson came to an end in  February, 1920. I never forgot his words and always felt that in his  mind my opinions, even when he sought them, were tainted with legalism.          CHAPTER IX    A RESOLUTION INSTEAD OF THE COVENANT      As it seemed advisable, in view of the incident of January 10, to have  nothing to do with the drafting of the Covenant unless the entire theory  was changed, the fact that there prevailed at that time a general belief  that a preliminary treaty of peace would be negotiated in the near  future invited an effort to delay the consideration of a complete and  detailed charter of the League of Nations until the definitive treaty or  a separate treaty dealing with the League alone was considered. As delay  would furnish time to study and discuss the subject and prevent hasty  acceptance of an undesirable or defective plan, it seemed to me that the  advisable course to take was to limit reference to the organization in  the preliminary treaty to general principles.    The method that I had in mind in carrying out this policy was to secure  the adoption, by the Conference on the Preliminaries of Peace, of a  resolution embodying a series of declarations as to the creation, the  nature, and the purposes of a League of Nations, which declarations  could be included in the preliminary treaty of peace accompanied by an  article providing for the negotiation of a detailed plan based on these  declarations at the time of the negotiation of the definitive treaty or  else by an article providing for the summoning of a world congress, in  which all nations, neutrals as well as belligerents, would be  represented and have a voice in the drafting of a convention  establishing a League of Nations in accordance with the general  principles declared in the preliminary treaty. Personally I preferred a  separate treaty, but doubted the possibility of obtaining the assent of  the Conference to that plan because some of the delegates showed a  feeling of resentment toward certain neutral nations on account of their  attitude during the war, while the inclusion of the four powers which  had formed the Central Alliance seemed almost out of the question.    In addition to the advantage to be gained by postponing the  determination of the details of the organization until the theory, the  form, the purposes and the powers of the proposed League could be  thoroughly considered, it would make possible the speedy restoration of  a state of peace. There can be no doubt that peace at the earliest  possible moment was the supreme need of the world. The political and  social chaos in the Central Empires, due to the overthrow of their  strong autocratic governments and the prevailing want, suffering, and  despair, in which the war had left their peoples, offered a fertile  field for the pernicious doctrines of Bolshevism to take root and  thrive. A proletarian revolution seemed imminent. The Spartacists in  Germany, the Radical Socialists in Austria, and the Communists in  Hungary were the best organized and most vigorous of the political  groups in those countries and were conducting an active and seemingly  successful propaganda among the starving and hopeless masses, while the  Russian duumvirs, Lenine and Trotsky, were with funds and emissaries  aiding these movements against established authority and social order.  Eastern Europe seemed to be a volcano on the very point of eruption.  Unless something was speedily done to check the peril, it threatened to  spread to other countries and even to engulf the very foundations of  modern civilization.    A restoration of commercial relations and of normal industrial  conditions through the medium of a treaty of peace appeared to offer the  only practical means of resisting these movements and of saving Europe  from the horrors of a proletarian despotism which had brought the  Russian people to so low a state. This was the common judgment of those  who at that time watched with increasing impatience the slow progress of  the negotiations at Paris and with apprehension the political turmoil in  the defeated and distracted empires of Central Europe.    An immediate restoration of peace was, as I then saw it, of vital  importance to the world as it was the universal demand of all mankind.  To delay it for the purpose of completing the organization of a League  of Nations or for any other purpose than the formulation of terms  essential to peace seemed to me to be taking a risk as to the future  wholly unwarranted by the relative importance of the subjects. There is  no question, in the light of subsequent events, that the peoples of the  Central Empires possessed a greater power of resistance to the  temptations of lawlessness and disorder than was presumed in the winter  of 1918-19. And yet it was a critical time. Anything might have  happened. It would have taken very little to turn the scale. What  occurred later cannot excuse the delay in making peace. It was not wise  statesmanship and foresight that saved the world from a great  catastrophe but the fortunate circumstance that a people habituated to  obedience were not led astray by the enemies of the existing order.

Neither the sincere worship of ancestors, nor the ceremonies  and rites which they observed in honor of their innumerable divinities,  softened the severity of their character, or weakened their passion for  war and bloody sports. Their hard and rigid wills were rarely moved by  the cries of agony or the shrieks of despair. Their slavery was more  cruel than among any nation of antiquity. Butchery and legalized murder  were the delight of Romans in their conquering days, as were inhuman  sports in the days of their political decline. Where was the spirit of  religion, as it was even in India and Egypt, when women were debased;  when every man and woman held a human being in cruel bondage; when home  was abandoned for the circus and the amphitheatre; when the cry of the  mourner was unheard in shouts of victory; when women sold themselves as  wives to those who would pay the highest price, and men abstained from  marriage unless they could fatten on rich dowries; when utility was the  spring of every action, and demoralizing pleasure was the universal  pursuit; when feastings and banquets were riotous and expensive, and  violence and rapine were restrained only by the strong arm of law  dictated by instincts of self-preservation? Where was the ennobling  influence of the gods, when nobody of any position finally believed in  them? How powerless the gods, when the general depravity was so glaring  as to call out the terrible invective of Paul, the cosmopolitan  traveller, the shrewd observer, the pure-hearted Christian missionary,  indicting not a few, but a whole people: \"Who exchanged the truth of God  for a lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather than the  Creator, ... being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication,  wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife,  deceit, malignity; whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, insolent,  haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,  without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affections,  unmerciful.\" An awful picture, but sustained by the evidence of the  Roman writers of that day as certainly no worse than the  hideous reality.    If this was the outcome of the most exquisitely poetical and  art-inspiring mythology the world has ever known, what wonder that the  pure spirituality of Jesus the Christ, shining into that blackness of  darkness, should have been hailed by perishing millions as the \"light of  the world\"!           *       *       *       *       *    AUTHORITIES.

CONFUCIUS.      SAGE AND MORALIST.    550-478 B.C.    About one hundred years after the great religious movement in India  under Buddha, a man was born in China who inaugurated a somewhat similar  movement there, and who impressed his character and principles on three  hundred millions of people. It cannot be said that he was the founder of  a new religion, since he aimed only to revive what was ancient. To quote  his own words, he was \"a transmitter, and not a maker.\" But he was,  nevertheless, a very extraordinary character; and if greatness is to be  measured by results, I know of no heathen teacher whose work has been so  permanent. In genius, in creative power, he was inferior to many; but in  influence he has had no equal among the sages of the world.    \"Confucius\" is a Latin name given him by Jesuit missionaries in China;  his real name was K'ung-foo-tseu. He was born about 550 B.C., in the  province of Loo, and was the contemporary of Belshazzar, of Cyrus, of  Croesus, and of Pisistratus. It is claimed that Confucius was a  descendant of one of the early emperors of China, of the Chow dynasty,  1121 B.C.; but he was simply of an upper-class family of the State of  Loo, one of the provinces of the empire,--his father and grandfather  having been prime ministers to the reigning princes or dukes of Loo,  which State resembled a feudal province of France in the Middle Ages,  acknowledging only a nominal fealty to the Emperor.    We know but little of the early condition of China. The earliest record  of events which can be called history takes us back to about 2350 B.C.,  when Yaou was emperor,--an intelligent and benignant prince, uniting  under his sway the different States of China, which had even then  reached a considerable civilization, for the legendary or mythical  history of the country dates back about five thousand years. Yaou's son  Shun was an equally remarkable man, wise and accomplished, who lived  only to advance the happiness of his subjects. At that period the  religion of China was probably monotheistic. The supreme being was  called Shang-te, to whom sacrifices were made, a deity who exercised a  superintending care of the universe; but corruptions rapidly crept in,  and a worship of the powers of Nature and of the spirits of departed  ancestors, who were supposed to guard the welfare of their descendants,  became the prevailing religion. During the reigns of these good emperors  the standard of morality was high throughout the empire.    But morals declined,--the old story in all the States of the ancient  world. In addition to the decline in morals, there were political  discords and endless wars between the petty princes of the empire.    To remedy the political and moral evils of his time was the great desire  and endeavor of Confucius. The most marked feature in the religion of  the Chinese, before his time, was the worship of ancestors, and this  worship he did not seek to change. \"Confucius taught three thousand  disciples, of whom the more eminent became influential authors. Like  Plato and Xenophon, they recorded the sayings of their master, and his  maxims and arguments preserved in their works were afterward added to  the national collection of the sacred books called the 'Nim Classes.'\"    Confucius was a mere boy when his father died, and we know next to  nothing of his early years. At fifteen years of age, however, we are  told that he devoted himself to learning, pursuing his studies under  considerable difficulties, his family being poor. He married when he was  nineteen years of age; and in the following year was born his son Le,  his only child, of whose descendants eleven thousand males were living  one hundred and fifty years ago, constituting the only hereditary  nobility of China,--a class who for seventy generations were the  recipients of the highest honors and privileges. On the birth of Le, the  duke Ch'aou of Loo sent Confucius a present of a carp, which seems to  indicate that he was already distinguished for his attainments.    At twenty years of age Confucius entered upon political duties, being  the superintendent of cattle, from which, for his fidelity and ability,  he was promoted to the higher office of distributer of grain, having  attracted the attention of his sovereign. At twenty-two he began his  labors as a public teacher, and his house became the resort of  enthusiastic youth who wished to learn the doctrines of antiquity. These  were all that the sage undertook to teach,--not new and original  doctrines of morality or political economy, but only such as were  established from a remote antiquity, going back two thousand years  before he was born. There is no improbability in this alleged antiquity  of the Chinese Empire, for Egypt at this time was a flourishing State.    At twenty-nine years of age Confucius gave his attention to music, which  he studied under a famous master; and to this art he devoted no small  part of his life, writing books and treatises upon it. Six years  afterward, at thirty-five, he had a great desire to travel; and the  reigning duke, in whose service he was as a high officer of state, put  at his disposal a carriage and two horses, to visit the court of the  Emperor, whose sovereignty, however, was only nominal. It does not  appear that Confucius was received with much distinction, nor did he  have much intercourse with the court or the ministers. He was a mere  seeker of knowledge, an inquirer about the ceremonies and maxims of the  founder of the dynasty of Chow, an observer of customs, like Herodotus.  He wandered for eight years among the various provinces of China,  teaching as he went, but without making a great impression. Moreover, he  was regarded with jealousy by the different ministers of princes; one of  them, however, struck with his wisdom and knowledge, wished to retain  him in his service.    On the return of Confucius to Loo, he remained fifteen years without  official employment, his native province being in a state of anarchy.  But he was better employed than in serving princes, prosecuting his  researches into poetry, history, ceremonies, and music,--a born scholar,  with insatiable desire of knowledge. His great gifts and learning,  however, did not allow him to remain without public employment. He was  made governor of an important city. As chief magistrate of this city, he  made a marvellous change in the manners of the people. The duke,  surprised at what he saw, asked if his rules could be employed to  govern a whole State; and Confucius told him that they could be applied  to the government of the Empire. On this the duke appointed him  assistant superintendent of Public Works,--a great office, held only by  members of the ducal family. So many improvements did Confucius make in "]]]
