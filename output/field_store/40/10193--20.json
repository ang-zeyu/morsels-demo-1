This region of northern Virginia  had just been surveyed by the English, and was soon to be the site of  the first English colony in North America.[3]    [Footnote 1: Mentioned on p. 80.]    [Footnote 2: The Andastes were akin to the Iroquois, but did not  belong to their confederacy; they lived in Pennsylvania.]    [Footnote 3: The inaccurate statement has frequently been written  about Newfoundland being \"the first British American colony\".  Newfoundland was reached by the ship in which John Cabot sailed on his  1497 voyage of discovery, and a few years afterwards its shores were  sought by the English in common with the French and the Portuguese,  and later on the Spaniards and Basques, for the cod fishery. But no  definite British settlement, such as subsequently grew into an actual  colony, was founded in Newfoundland until the year 1624; the island  was not recognized as definitely British till 1713, and no governor  was appointed till 1728. The first permanent English colonial  settlement in America was founded at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607; and  in the Bermudas and Barbados (West Indies) soon afterwards.]    In attempting to return to the valley of the St. Lawrence in 1616,  with his Andaste guides, Brule lost his way, and to avoid starvation  surrendered himself to the Seneka Indians (the westernmost clan of the  Iroquois) against whom the recent warlike operations of the French  were being directed. Discovering his nationality, the Senekas decided  to torture him before burning him to death at the stake. As they tore  off his clothes they found that he was wearing an _Agnus Dei_ medal  next his skin. Brule told them to be careful, as it was a medicine of  great power which would certainly kill them. By a coincidence, at that  very moment a terrific thunderstorm burst from a sky which until  recently had been all sunshine. The Senekas were so scared by the  thunder and lightning that they believed Brule to be a person of  supernatural powers. They therefore released him, strove to heal such  slight wounds as he had incurred, and carried him off to their  principal town, where he became a great favourite. After a while they  gave him guides to take him north into the country of the Hurons.    His further adventures led him to discover Lake Superior and the way  thither through the Sault Ste. Marie, and to reach a place probably  not far from the south coast of Hudson Bay, in which there was a  copper mine. Then he explored the Montagnais country north of Quebec,  and even at one time (in 1629) entered the service of the English, who  had captured Quebec and Tadoussac from the French. When the English  left this region Brule travelled again to the west and joined the  Hurons once more.    His licentious conduct amongst his Indian friends seems to have  roused them to such a pitch of anger that in 1632 they murdered him,  then boiled and ate his body. But immediately afterwards misfortune  seemed to fall on the place. The Hurons were terrified at what they  had done, and thought they heard or saw in the sky the spirits of the  white relations of Brule--some said the sister, some the  uncle--threatening their town (Toanche), which they soon afterwards  burnt and deserted.    In 1615 Champlain, returning from France, had brought out with him  friars of the Recollet order.[4] These were the pioneer missionaries  of Canada, prominent amongst whom was FATHER LE CARON, and these  Recollets traversed the countries in the basin of the St. Lawrence  between Lake Huron and Cape Breton Island, preaching Christianity to  the Amerindians as well as ministering to the French colonists and fur  traders. One of these Recollet missionaries died of cold and hunger in  attempting to cross New Brunswick from the St. Lawrence to the Bay of  Fundy, and another--Nicholas Viel--was the first martyr in Canada in  the spread of Christianity, for when travelling down the Ottawa River  to Montreal he was thrown by the pagan Hurons (together with one of  his converts) into the waters of a rapid since christened Sault le  Recollet. Another Recollet, Father d'Aillon, prompted by Brule,  explored the richly fertile, beautiful country known then as the  territory of the Neutral nation, that group of Huron-Iroquois  Amerindians who strove to keep aloof from the fierce struggles between  the Algonkins and Hurons on the one hand and the eastern Iroquois  clans on the other. This region, which lies between the Lakes  Ontario, Erie, and Huron, is the most attractive portion of western  Canada. Lying in the southernmost parts of the Dominion, and nearly  surrounded by sheets of open water, it has a far milder climate than  the rest of eastern Canada.    [Footnote 4: The Recollet (properly Recollect) friars were a strict  branch of the Franciscan order that were sometimes called the  Observantines. They were also known as \"Recollects\" (pronounced in  French _recollet_) because they were required to be constantly keeping  guard over their thoughts. This development of the Franciscan order of  preaching missionary friars was originally a Spanish one, founded  early in the sixteenth century, and becoming well established in the  Spanish Netherlands. Many of them were Flemings or Walloons.]    In 1626 the Jesuit order supplanted the Recollets, and commenced a  campaign both of Christian propaganda and of geographical exploration  which has scarcely finished in the Canada of to-day.    In 1627 the war between the Iroquois Confederacy and the Huron and  Algonkin tribes recommenced, and this, together with the British  capture of Quebec and other portions of Canada, put a stop for several  years to the work of exploration. This was not resumed on an advanced  scale till 1634, when Champlain, unable himself, from failing health,  to carry out his original commission of seeking a direct passage to  China and India across the North-American continent, dispatched a  Norman Frenchman named JEAN NICOLLET to find a way to the Western Sea.  Nicollet, as a very young man, had lived for years amongst the  Amerindian tribes, especially amongst the Nipissings near the lake of  that name. Being charged, amongst other things, with the task of  making peace between the Hurons and the tribes dwelling to the west of  the great lakes, Nicollet discovered Lake Michigan. He was so  convinced of the possibility of arriving at the Pacific Ocean, and  thence making his way to China, that in the luggage which he carried  in his birch-bark canoe was a dress of ceremony made of Chinese damask  silk embroidered richly with birds and flowers. He was on his way to  discover the Winnebago Indians, or \"Men of the Sea\", of whom Champlain  had heard from the Hurons, with whom they were at war. But the great  water from which they derived their name was not in this instance a  sea, but the Mississippi River. The Winnebago Indians were totally  distinct from the Algonkins or the Iroquois, and belonged to the  Dakota stock, from which the great Siou confederation[5] was also  derived.    [Footnote 5: See p. 160.]    Nicollet advanced to meet the Winnebagos clad in his Chinese robe and  with a pistol in each hand. As he drew near he discharged his pistols,  and the women and children fled in terror, for all believed him to be  a supernatural being, a spirit wielding thunder and lightning.  However, when they recovered from their terror the Winnebagos gave him  a hearty welcome, and got up such lavish feasts in his honour, that  one chief alone cooked 120 beavers at a single banquet.    Nicollet certainly reached the water-parting between the systems  of the St. Lawrence and the Mississippi, and under that  name--Misi-sipi--\"great water\"--he heard through the Algonkin Indians  of a mighty river lying three days' journey westward from his last  camp. Winnebago (from which root is also derived the names of the  Lakes Winnipeg and Winnipegosis much farther to the north-west) meant  \"salt\" or \"foul\" water. Both terms might therefore be applied to the  sea, and also to the lakes and rivers which, in the minds of the  Amerindians, were equally vast in length or breadth.    From 1648 to 1653 the whole of the Canada known to the French settlers  and explorers was convulsed by the devastating warfare carried on by  the Iroquois, who during that period destroyed the greater part of the  Algonkin and Huron clans. The neutral nation of Lake Erie (the Erigas)  was scattered, and between the shores of Lakes Michigan and Huron and  Montreal the country was practically depopulated, except for the  handfuls of French settlers and traders who trembled behind their  fortifications. Then, to the relief and astonishment of the French,  one of the Iroquois clans--the Onondaga--proposed terms of peace,  probably because they had no more enemies to fight of their own  colour, and wished to trade with the French.    The fur trade of the Quebec province had attracted an increasing  number of French people (men bringing their wives) to such settlements  as Tadoussac and Three Rivers. Amongst these were the parents of  PIERRE ESPRIT RADISSON. This young man went hunting near Three Rivers  station and was captured in the woods by Mohawks (Iroquois) who  carried him off to one of their towns and intended to burn him alive.  Having bound him at a stake, they proceeded to tear out some of his  finger nails and shoot arrows at the less vital parts of his body. But  a Mohawk woman was looking on and was filled with pity at the  sufferings of this handsome boy. She announced her intention of  adopting him as a member of her family, and by sheer force of will she  compelled the men to release him. After staying for some time amongst  the Mohawks he escaped, but was again captured just as he was nearing  Three Rivers. Once more he was spared from torture at the intercession  of his adopted relations. He then made an even bolder bid"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13015"],[0,"Tales of Old Japan (#17)"],[1,"Zempachi, wiping away his blood, bound a kerchief round his head,  and fought again desperately. But at last the pain of his wound and  the loss of blood overcame him, and Tsunehei cut him down with a wound  in the shoulder and easily dispatched him.    Then Tsunehei went and reported the whole matter to the Governor of  Yedo, and was put in prison until an inquiry could be made. But the  Chief Priest of Bandzuin, who had heard of the affair, went and told  the governor all the bad deeds of Zempachi, and having procured  Tsunehei's pardon, took him home and employed him as porter in the  temple. So Tsunehei changed his name to Chobei, and earned much  respect in the neighbourhood, both for his talents and for his many  good works. If any man were in distress, he would help him, heedless  of his own advantage or danger, until men came to look up to him as to  a father, and many youths joined him and became his apprentices. So he  built a house at Hanakawado, in Asakusa, and lived there with his  apprentices, whom he farmed out as spearsmen and footmen to the  Daimios and Hatamotos, taking for himself the tithe of their earnings.  But if any of them were sick or in trouble, Chobei would nurse and  support them, and provide physicians and medicine. And the fame of his  goodness went abroad until his apprentices were more than two thousand  men, and were employed in every part of the city. But as for Chobei,  the more he prospered, the more he gave in charity, and all men  praised his good and generous heart.    This was the time when the Hatamotos had formed themselves into bands  of Otokodate,[21] of which Midzuno Jiurozayemon, Kondo Noborinosuke,  and Abe Shirogoro were the chiefs. And the leagues of the nobles  despised the leagues of the wardsmen, and treated them with scorn, and  tried to put to shame Chobei and his brave men; but the nobles'  weapons recoiled upon themselves, and, whenever they tried to bring  contempt upon Chobei, they themselves were brought to ridicule. So  there was great hatred on both sides.    [Footnote 21: See the story of Kazuma's Revenge.]    One day, that Chobei went to divert himself in a tea-house in the  Yoshiwara, he saw a felt carpet spread in an upper room, which had  been adorned as for some special occasion; and he asked the master of  the house what guest of distinction was expected. The landlord replied  that my Lord Jiurozayemon, the chief of the Otokodate of the  Hatamotos, was due there that afternoon. On hearing this, Chobei  replied that as he much wished to meet my Lord Jiurozayemon, he would  lie down and await his coming. The landlord was put out at this, and  knew not what to say; but yet he dare not thwart Chobei, the powerful  chief of the Otokodate. So Chobei took off his clothes and laid  himself down upon the carpet. After a while my Lord Jiurozayemon  arrived, and going upstairs found a man of large stature lying naked  upon the carpet which had been spread for him.    \"What low ruffian is this?\" shouted he angrily to the landlord.    \"My lord, it is Chobei, the chief of the Otokodate,\" answered the man,  trembling.    Jiurozayemon at once suspected that Chobei was doing this to insult  him; so he sat down by the side of the sleeping man, and lighting his  pipe began to smoke. When he had finished his pipe, he emptied the  burning ashes into Chobei's navel; but Chobei, patiently bearing the  pain, still feigned sleep. Ten times did Jiurozayemon fill his  pipe,[22] and ten times he shook out the burning ashes on to Chobei's  navel; but he neither stirred nor spoke. Then Jiurozayemon, astonished  at his fortitude, shook him, and roused him, saying--    \"Chobei! Chobei! wake up, man.\"    \"What is the matter?\" said Chobei, rubbing his eyes as though he were  awaking from a deep sleep; then seeing Jiurozayemon, he pretended to  be startled, and said, \"Oh, my lord, I know not who you are; but I  have been very rude to your lordship. I was overcome with wine, and  fell asleep: I pray your lordship to forgive me.\"    \"Is your name Chobei?\"    \"Yes, my lord, at your service. A poor wardsman, and ignorant of good  manners, I have been very rude; but I pray your lordship to excuse my  ill-breeding.\"    \"Nay, nay; we have all heard the fame of Chobei, of Bandzuin, and I  hold myself lucky to have met you this day. Let us be friends.\"    \"It is a great honour for a humble wardsman to meet a nobleman face to  face.\"    [Footnote 22: The tiny Japanese pipe contains but two or three whiffs;  and as the tobacco is rolled up tightly in the fingers before it is  inserted, the ash, when shaken out, is a little fire-ball from which a  second pipe is lighted.]    As they were speaking, the waitresses brought in fish and wine, and  Jiurozayemon pressed Chobei to feast with him; and thinking to annoy  Chobei, offered him a large wine-cup,[23] which, however, he drank  without shrinking, and then returned to his entertainer, who was by no  means so well able to bear the fumes of the wine. Then Jiurozayemon  hit upon another device for annoying Chobei, and, hoping to frighten  him, said--    \"Here, Chobei, let me offer you some fish;\" and with those words he  drew his sword, and, picking up a cake of baked fish upon the point of  it, thrust it towards the wardsman's mouth. Any ordinary man would  have been afraid to accept the morsel so roughly offered; but Chobei  simply opened his mouth, and taking the cake off the sword's point ate  it without wincing. Whilst Jiurozayemon was wondering in his heart  what manner of man this was, that nothing could daunt, Chobei said to  him--    \"This meeting with your lordship has been an auspicious occasion to  me, and I would fain ask leave to offer some humble gift to your  lordship in memory of it.[24] Is there anything which your lordship  would specially fancy?\"    \"I am very fond of cold macaroni.\"    [Footnote 23: It is an act of rudeness to offer a large wine-cup. As,  however, the same cup is returned to the person who has offered it,  the ill carries with it its own remedy. At a Japanese feast the same  cup is passed from hand to hand, each person rinsing it in a bowl of  water after using it, and before offering it to another.]      [Footnote 24: The giving of presents from inferiors to superiors is a  common custom.]    \"Then I shall have the honour of ordering some for your lordship;\" and  with this Chobei went downstairs, and calling one of his apprentices,  named Token Gombei,[25] who was waiting for him, gave him a hundred  riyos (about L28), and bade him collect all the cold macaroni to be  found in the neighbouring cook-shops and pile it up in front of the  tea-house. So Gombei went home, and, collecting Chobei's apprentices,  sent them out in all directions to buy the macaroni. Jiurozayemon all  this while was thinking of the pleasure he would have in laughing at  Chobei for offering him a mean and paltry present; but when, by  degrees, the macaroni began to be piled mountain-high around the  tea-house, he saw that he could not make a fool of Chobei, and went  home discomfited.    [Footnote 25: _Token_, a nickname given to Gombei, after a savage dog  that he killed. As a Chonin, or wardsman, he had no surname.]    It has already been told how Shirai Gompachi was befriended and helped  by Chobei.[26] His name will occur again in this story.    [Footnote 26: See the story of Gompachi and Komurasaki.]    At this time there lived in the province of Yamato a certain Daimio,  called Honda Dainaiki, who one day, when surrounded by several of his  retainers, produced a sword, and bade them look at it and say from  what smith's workshop the blade had come.    \"I think this must be a Masamune blade,\" said one Fuwa Banzayemon.    \"No,\" said Nagoya Sanza, after examining the weapon attentively, \"this  certainly is a Muramasa.\"[27]    [Footnote 27: The swords of Muramasa, although so finely tempered that  they are said to cut hard iron as though it were a melon, have the  reputation of being unlucky: they are supposed by the superstitious to  hunger after taking men's lives, and to be unable to repose in their  scabbards. The principal duty of a sword is to preserve tranquillity  in the world, by punishing the wicked and protecting the good. But the  bloodthirsty swords of Muramasa rather have the effect of maddening  their owners, so that they either kill others indiscriminately or  commit suicide. At the end of the sixteenth century Prince Tokugawa  Iyeyasu was in the habit of carrying a spear made by Muramasa, with  which he often scratched or cut himself by mistake. Hence the Tokugawa  family avoid girding on Muramasa blades, which are supposed to be  specially unlucky to their race. The murders of Gompachi, who wore a  sword by this maker, also contributed to give his weapons a bad name.    The swords of one Toshiro Yoshimitsu, on the other hand, are specially  auspicious to the Tokugawa family, for the following reason. After  Iyeyasu had been defeated by Taketa Katsuyori, at the battle of the  river Tenrin, he took refuge in the house of a village doctor,  intending to put an end to his existence by _hara-kiri,_ and drawing  his dirk, which was made by Yoshimitsu, tried to plunge it into his  belly, when, to his surprise, the blade turned. Thinking that the dirk  must be a bad one, he took up an iron mortar for grinding medicines  and tried it upon that, and the point entered and transfixed the  mortar. He was about to stab himself a second time, when his  followers, who had missed him, and had been searching for him  everywhere, came up, and seeing their master about to kill himself,  stayed his hand, and took away the dirk by force. Then they set him  upon his horse and compelled him to fly to his own province of Mikawa,  whilst they kept his pursuers at bay. After this, when, by the favour  of Heaven, Iyeyasu became Shogun, it was considered that of a surety  there must have been a good spirit in the blade that refused to"]]]
