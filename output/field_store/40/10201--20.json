Ammon  explained how that could easily be done. The money should be all turned  over to him, and none of the creditors would ever see it again. He did  not deem it necessary to suggest that neither would Miller. Accordingly  the two, the lawyer and the client, went to the office of Wells, Fargo &  Co., Ammon obligingly carrying the satchel containing the thirty  thousand five hundred dollars. Here Ammon deposited the contents to his  own account, as well as the certificate of deposit for one hundred  thousand dollars previously mentioned, and a check for ten thousand  dollars, representing the balance of Miller's loot. In addition to this  he received an order for forty thousand dollars United States Government  bonds, which were on deposit with Wells, Fargo & Co., and later, through  Miller's father, sixty-five thousand dollars in bonds of the New York  Central Railroad and the United States Government. Thus Ammon secured  from his dupe the sum of two hundred and forty-five thousand five  hundred dollars, the actual market value of the securities bringing the  amount up to two hundred and fifty thousand five hundred dollars,  besides whatever sums he had been paid by Miller for legal services,  which could not have been less than ten or fifteen thousand dollars. The  character of the gentleman is well illustrated by the fact that later  when paying Mrs. Miller her miserable pittance of five dollars per week,  he explained to her that \"he was giving her that out of his own money,  and that her husband _owed him_.\"    [Illustration: Ammon's deposit slips and a receipt signed by Mrs.  Ammon.]    There still remained, however, the chance of getting a few dollars more  and Ammon advised Miller \"to try to get Friday's receipts, which were  the heaviest day's business.\" Acting on this suggestion, Miller  returned to Floyd Street the next morning at about half past nine,  finding a great crowd of people waiting outside. About one o'clock he  started to go home, but discovering that he was being followed by a man  whom he took to be a detective, he boarded a street car, dodged through  a drug store and a Chinese laundry, finally made the elevated railroad,  with his pursuer at his heels, and eventually reached the lawyer's  office about two o'clock in the afternoon. Word was received almost  immediately over the telephone that Miller had been indicted in Kings  County for conspiracy to defraud, and Ammon stated that the one thing  for Miller to do was to go away. Miller replied that he did not want to  go unless he could take his wife and baby with him, but Ammon assured  him that he would send them to Canada later in charge of his own wife.  Under this promise Miller agreed to go, and Ammon procured a man named  Enright to take Miller to Canada, saying that \"he was an ex-detective  and could get him out of the way.\" Ammon further promised to forward to  Miller whatever money he might need to retain lawyers for him in  Montreal. Thereupon Miller exchanged hats with some one in Ammon's  office and started for Canada in the custody of the lawyer's  representative.    How the wily colonel must have chuckled as poor Miller trotted down the  stairs like a sheep leaving his fleece behind him. A golden fleece  indeed! Did ever a lawyer have such a piece of luck? Here was a little  fellow who had invented a brilliant scheme to get away with other  people's money and had carried it through successfully--more than  successfully, beyond the dreams of even the most avaricious criminal,  and then, richer than Midas, had handed over the whole jolly fortune to  another for the other's asking, without even taking a scrap of paper to  show for it. More than that, he had then voluntarily extinguished  himself. Had Ammon not chuckled he would not have been Bob Ammon. The  money was stolen, to be sure, but Ammon's skirts were clear. There was  nothing to show that the two hundred and forty-five thousand dollars he  had received was stolen money. There was only one man--a discredited  felon, who could hint that the money was even \"tainted,\" and _he_ was  safely over the border, in a foreign jurisdiction, not in the custody of  the police, but of Ammon himself, to be kept there (as Mr. Robert C.  Taylor so aptly phrased it in arguing Ammon's case on appeal) \"on  waiting orders. Ammon had Miller on a string, and as soon as Ammon (for  his own sake) was compelled either to produce Miller or to run the risk  of indictment, he pulled the string and brought Miller back into the  jurisdiction.\"    Needless to say great was the ado made over the disappearance of the  promoter of the Franklin Syndicate, and the authorities of King's County  speedily let it become known that justice required that some one should  be punished for the colossal fraud which had been perpetrated. The grand  jury of the county started a general investigation. Public indignation  was stirred to the point of ebullition. In the midst of the rumpus,  there came a knock on the office door of the Hon. John F. Clark,  District Attorney of King's County, and Col. Robert A. Ammon announced  himself. The two men were entire strangers to each other but this did  not prevent Ammon, with his inimitable assurance, from addressing the  District Attorney by his first name.    \"How are you, John?\" he inquired nonchalantly, \"what can I do for you?\"    Mr. Clark repressed his natural inclination to kick the insolent fellow  forcibly out of his office, invited him to be seated and rang for a  stenographer. Ammon asserted his anxiety to assist the District Attorney  by every means in his power, but denied knowing the whereabouts of  Miller, alleging that he was simply acting as his counsel. Mr. Clark  replied that in Miller's absence the grand jury might take the view  that Ammon himself was the principal. At this Ammon calmly assured his  host that as far as he was concerned he was ready to go before the grand  jury at any time.    \"That is just what I want,\" returned Mr. Clark, \"the grand jury is in  session. Come over.\"    Ammon arose with a smile and accompanied the District Attorney towards  the door of the grand jury room. Just outside he suddenly placed his  hand to his head as if recollecting something.    \"One moment,\" he exclaimed. \"I forgot that I have an engagement. I will  come over to-morrow.\"    \"Ah!\" retorted Mr. Clark, \"I do not think you will be here to-morrow.\"    Two weeks later Miller was safely ensconced without bail in Raymond  Street jail.    Schlessinger, who got away with one hundred and seventy-five thousand  dollars in cash, fled to Europe where he lived high, frequenting the  race tracks and gaming tables until he was called to his final account a  year or two ago. The money which he took has never been traced. Miller  was tried, convicted and sent to Sing Sing. The Appellate Division of  the Supreme Court then reversed his conviction, but later, on appeal to  the Court of Appeals, it was sustained.    Of the enormous sums turned over to Ammon Miller received nothing save  the money necessary for his support in Montreal, for the lawyers who  defended him, and five dollars per week for his wife and child up to the  time he turned State's evidence. It is interesting to note that among  the counsel representing Miller upon his trial was Ammon himself.  Miller's wife and child were not sent to Montreal by Ammon, nor did the  latter secure bail for his client at any time during his different  periods of incarceration. The colonel knew very well that it was a  choice between himself and Miller and took no steps which might  necessitate the election falling upon himself.    The conviction of Miller, with his sentence to ten years in State's  prison did not, however, prevent the indictment of Ammon for receiving  stolen money in New York County, although the chance that he would ever  have to suffer for his crime seemed small indeed. The reader must bear  in mind that up to the time of Ammon's trial Miller had never admitted  his guilt; that he was still absolutely, and apparently irrevocably,  under Ammon's sinister influence, keeping in constant communication with  him and implicitly obeying his instructions while in prison; and that  Miller's wife and child were dependent upon Ammon for their daily bread.  No wonder Ammon strode the streets confident that his creature would  never betray him.    \"Now, Billy, you don't want to be shooting off your mouth up here,\" was  his parting injunction to his dupe on his final visit to Sing Sing  before he became a guest there himself at the expense of the People.    Miller followed his orders to the letter, and the stipend was increased  to the munificent sum of forty dollars per month.    Meantime the case against Ammon languished and the District Attorney of  New York County was at his wits' end to devise a means to procure the  evidence to convict him. To do this it would be necessary to establish  affirmatively that the thirty thousand five hundred dollars received by  Ammon from Miller and deposited with Wells, Fargo & Co. was the  _identical_ money stolen by Miller from the victims of the Franklin  Syndicate. It was easy enough to prove that Miller stole hundreds of  thousands of dollars, that Ammon received hundreds of thousands, but you  had to prove that the same money stolen by Miller passed to the hands of  Ammon. Only one man in the world, as Ammon had foreseen, could supply  this last"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1319"],[0,"Increasing Human Efficiency in Business (#17)"],[1,"the more technical  positions. Where the system is applicable,  it acts as a powerful stimulus to the  men by adding to their present wages the  promise or possibility of better positions and  higher pay in the future. It gives assurance of  promotion for faithful service much greater  than in houses which fill the upper positions  from outside sources on the assumption that  they thus get ``new blood'' into the business.  The men secured from outside may be more  skilled or more productive of immediate results  than any available in the house organization.  By their importation, however, the  wages of all the men aspiring to the position  have been cheapened. Nor does the evil stop  there.    _The assumption is naturally drawn that the  same practice is likely to be followed in filling  other vacancies. The stimulus to initiative and  activity is thus weakened for men in every grade  and their wages are shrunk below par_.  <p 157>    The importance which some successful employers  attach to this principle of promotion  from the ranks is well illustrated by an incident  which recently occurred in a large manufacturing  establishment organized on a one-man  basis. During the president's absence it was  decided to open up a new zone of trade for a  new product. No one in the organization  knew the product and the field, so a new man  was put in charge. The work progressed  surprisingly well; the enterprise was in every  way successful.    When the real head returned, he called his  managers together and told them that the  new man must be removed and the most deserving  man in the regular organization appointed  in his place. He was met with the protest  that no employee was capable of taking up the  work and reminded that the new man had  already achieved great success. The president  answered that he was willing to lose money  in the department for the first year rather than  cheapen and disorganize the service by taking  away the certainty of promotion and by re-  <p 158>  moving the incentive to study and self-development  which had increased the efficiency of  every ambitious employee.    Innumerable examples of the same principle  in promotions could be gleaned from the  records of some of the oldest and most progressive  houses in the country. In one establishment  visited, the quality of whose wares  is strenuously guarded, it was discovered that  the chemist and metallurgist in charge of the  factory laboratory had been lifted out of one  of the departments and supplied with the  money to take a specialized course in physics,  chemistry, and metallurgy. The advertising  manager, the factory engineer, and two or three  of the foremen had been given leaves of absence  to study and fit themselves for the positions  to which their talents and inclinations  drew them. Even among the workmen there  was a fixed basis for advancement towards the  better jobs and the higher rates, dependent on  satisfactory service and output.    To these major considerations in increasing  the worth of wages, those companies which  <p 159>  have given the longest attention to the problem  add many other inducements.    _An efficient and contented employee has a  positive money value to any employer. To hold  him and keep him efficient, his personal comfort  and needs should be considered in every way  not detrimental to the company's interests_.    As nearly as possible, the ideal in factory  location and construction is approached. Some  industries have removed bodily to country  towns, less for the sake of a cheap site than  for the purpose of establishing themselves  where housing conditions for workers were  good, rents low, the cost of living cheaper, and  other factors tending to _*add value_ to every dollar  paid in wages were present. Direct appeal  was made to the intelligence of employees,  whose health is part of their capital, by making  and keeping working conditions as healthful  and sanitary, as little taxing on eyesight and  bodily vigor as circumstances and judicious  investment of capital allowed. Scores of  towns have been built outright, to benefit  employees.  <p 160>    In line with this policy are the systems of  benefit insurance for accident and sickness  maintained and partly supported by many  companies; the pension systems which have  been adopted within the last few years by  some of the greatest and most progressive  companies in America; the free medical service,  both in case of factory accidents and  sickness at home, which other firms provide  for employees; and various other activities  contributing to the welfare of workers, both  during working hours and afterwards.    Employers are coming more and more to  see that this is the case and to devote both  thought and money to the elimination of conditions  which cut wages below par.    _Whatever reduces hazard, discomfort, loss of  time, uncertainty, or the cost of living for workers  adds value to their wages and is a means of  influencing their attitude towards the company_.    Some employers are continually exercised  to keep the wages of their men from falling  below par. Others are equally solicitous that  their men may regard their wages as above  <p 161>  par. This classification is a real one and was  made plain by some of the interviews referred  to above. Thus in answer to the question,  ``What special method do you employ to make  men satisfied or pleased with their wages?''  one employer immediately put his own interpretation  on the question. To him it meant,  ``What method do you employ to keep your  men from being _*dissatisfied_ with their wages?''    His answer was: ``By paying them somewhere  near what they ask or expect. If we  don't,'' he added, ``they go out on strike and  we have to compromise.''    The majority of successful employers have  advanced beyond this negative, defensive  attitude and take a positive and aggressive  position in dealing with the problem.    _Instead of assuming their work accomplished  when the men are not dissatisfied or rebellious,  they do not rest until every dollar paid out in  wages is above par in its influence upon efficiency_.    Thus in innumerable ways the progressive  employer increases the value of all wages he  <p 162>  pays by making them appeal to the reason  and to the instincts of workers in a way un-  dreamed of by less enlightened men. The  purpose of wages is to produce a certain  psychological effect and to promote the most  favorable attitude on the part of the worker.  The methods of increasing the purchasing power  of money thus spent is one of the most interesting  and yet complex problems which the  business man has to face.    This chapter shows the psychological ground  for the following statements:--    Employees differ in their response to piecework  rates and to salaries. Some respond  more satisfactorily to one and some to the  other.    When the development of men for better  positions is of prime importance, the piecework  system is not to be adopted. If the  quantity of work per unit of wage is of greatest  importance, then some form of wage other  than fixed salary should be used.    An employee should not be dismissed as  hopelessly lazy till he has shown this attitude  <p 163>  in more than one department or has failed to  respond to different forms of stimulation.    Changes in wages may often be placed under  the authority of some person or committee  other than the immediate superiors of the  employees involved. This authority may be  vested in the direct representatives of the  executives or in such a committee as would  be formed by representatives of the executives  and also employees from the different departments  of the establishment.    _Payment of wages, so far as possible, should  be made to appeal to the instincts for social distinction  and for acquisition as well as to the instinct  for self-preservation_.    Wages should never be reduced without a  tactful and sincere attempt to convince the  men of the necessity of such an act.    Increase in wages may well be made a personal  matter. Some firms, however, are most  successful with a mechanical wage system in  which employees know exactly the conditions  necessary for an increase in wages.    All work should be thoroughly supervised  <p 164>  and inspected so that employees know that  good service will be recognized and rewarded.    The policy of filling all positions from the  ranks seems growing in favor, since it gives  certain hope for advancement and hence  greater satisfaction with the present wage.    The wage may well include a tacit insurance  for the future. Employees should be assured  that so long as they remain faithful to the  firm, their work and pay will continue, and  that in accident or old age they will be provided  for. Accepted thus, the wage secures  increased service.        CHAPTER VII    PLEASURE    AS A MEANS OF INCREASING HUMAN EFFICIENCY    TO prevent the usual ``summer slump''  in output, the manager of a factory  employing a hundred or more sewing  girls on piecework tried various methods.  He began with closer individual supervision  by the forewomen. He set up a bulletin  board and posted daily the names of the five  highest operators. He added small cash prizes  weekly. He adopted a modified bonus system  framed so as not to interfere with the  established average of winter tasks. With  each his success was only partial. Ten or a  dozen of the more energetic girls responded to  the stimulus; on the majority the effect was  slight.    The problem was serious. June, July, and  August comprised the season when his prod-  <p 165>  <p 166>  ucts were at a premium, when future orders  were frequently lost because partial deliveries  could not be made immediately. Studying  the question, he noted specifically, what he  already knew, that the output dropped as the  temperature rose.
