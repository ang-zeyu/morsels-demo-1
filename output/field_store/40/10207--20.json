I wrote that I was an \"_honorary_ member;\"  I don't know, however, whether this is correct; perhaps I ought to have  said, \"a corresponding member;\" neither knowing nor caring much about such  things. You had also better say something on the subject to _Bernardum non  sanctum_ (editor of the \"Vienna Zeitschrift\"). Make inquiries, too, from  Bernard about that knave Ruprecht; tell him of this queer business, and  find out from him how he can punish the villain.

Master flash in the pan, and wide of the mark! full of reasons, yet devoid  of reason!--Everything was ready yesterday for Glaeser (the copyist). As for  you, I shall expect you in Hetzendorf to dinner at half-past two o'clock.  If you come later, dinner shall be kept for you.      341.    TO SCHINDLER.    Hetzendorf, July 2, 1823.    WORTHY HERR V. SCHINDLER,--    The incessant insolence of my landlord from the hour I entered his house up  to the present moment compels me to apply for aid to the police; so I beg  you will do so for me at once. As to the double winter windows, the  housekeeper was desired to see about them, and especially to state if they  were not necessary after such a violent storm, in case of the rain having  penetrated into the room; but her report was that the rain had not come in,  and, moreover, that it could not possibly do so. In accordance with her  statement, I locked the door to prevent this rude man entering my room  during my absence (which he had threatened). Say also further what his  conduct to you was, and that he put up a placard of the lodgings being to  let, without giving me notice, which, besides, he has no right to do till  St. James's Day. He is equally unfair in refusing to give up the receipt  from St. George's Day till St. James's, as the enclosure shows; I am  charged, too, for lighting, of which I know nothing. This detestable  lodging,[1] without any open stove, and the principal flue truly  abominable, has cost me (for extra outlay, exclusive of the rent) 259  florins, in order merely to keep me alive while I was there during the  winter. It was a deliberate fraud, as I never was allowed to see the rooms  on the first floor, but only those on the second, that I might not become  aware of their many disagreeable drawbacks. I cannot understand how a flue  _so destructive to health can be tolerated by the Government_. You remember  the appearance of the walls of your room owing to smoke, and the large sum  it cost even to lessen in any degree this discomfort, although to do away  with it wholly was impossible. My chief anxiety at present is that he may  be ordered to take down his placard, and to give me a receipt for the  house-rent I have paid; but nothing will induce me to pay for the  abominable lighting, without which it cost me enough actually to preserve  my life in such a lodging. My eyes do not yet suffer me to encounter the  town atmosphere, or I would myself apply in person to the police.    Your attached    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: The Pfarrgasse, in the Laimgrube, where Schindler lived with  him.]      342.    TO SCHINDLER.    I must have an attested copy of all the writings; I send you 45 kreutzers.  How could you possibly accept such a proposal from our churlish landlord  when accompanied by a threat? Where was your good sense? Where it always  is.    To-morrow early I shall send for the Variations, copy and originals. It is  not certain whether the Pr. comes or not; so be so good as to stay at home  till eight o'clock. You can come to dinner either to-day or to-morrow; but  you must settle which you mean to do, as it is not easy _for me_ to provide  provisions. Not later than half-past two o'clock. The housekeeper will tell  you about a lodging in the Landstrasse. It is high time, truly! As soon as  you hear of anything to be had on the Bastei or the Landstrasse, you must  at once give me notice. We must find out what room the landlord uses on  account of the well.--_Vale!_      343.    TO SCHINDLER.[1]    Hetzendorf, 1823.    SAMOTHRACIAN VAGABOND!--    You were dispatched yesterday to the South Pole, whereas we went off to the  North Pole, a slight difference now equalized by Captain Parry. There were,  however, no mashed potatoes there.    Bach [his lawyer], to whom I beg my best regards, is requested to say what  the lodging in Baden is to cost; we must also try to arrange that Carl  should come to me once every fortnight there (but cheaply; good heavens!  poverty and economy!). I intrust this matter to you, as you have your  friends and admirers among the drivers and liverymen. If you get this in  time, you had better go to Bach to-day, so that I may receive his answer  to-morrow forenoon. It is almost too late now.    You might also take that rascal of a copyist by surprise; I don't expect  much good from him. He has now had the Variations for eight days.    Your [\"friend\" stroked out] _amicus_,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: He no doubt alludes to Captain Parry, the celebrated  traveller, who wrote an article in the _A.M. Zeitung_ on the music of the  Esquimaux.]      344.    TO SCHINDLER.[1]    June, 1823.    SAMOTHRACIAN!--    Don't trouble yourself to come here till you receive a _Hati Scherif_. I  must say you do not deserve the _golden_ cord. My fast-sailing frigate, the  worthy and well-born Frau Schnaps, will call every three or four days to  inquire after your health.    Farewell! Bring _no one whatever_ with you: farewell!    [Footnote 1: Schindler says in his _Biography_: \"These _Variations_ [Op.  120] were completed in June, 1823, and delivered to the publisher,  Diabelli, without the usual amount of time bestowed on giving them the  finishing touches; and now he set to work at once at the ninth Symphony,  some jottings of which were already written down. Forthwith all the gay  humor that had made him more sociable, and in every respect more  accessible, at once disappeared. All visits were declined,\" &c.]      345.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    Hetzendorf, July 15, 1823.    I trust that you are in the best possible health. As for my eyes, they are  improving, though slowly, and in six or seven days at most I hope to have  the good fortune to wait on Y.R.H. If I were not obliged to use spectacles,  I should get better sooner. It is a most distressing occurrence, and has  thrown me back in everything. What soothes my feelings, however, is Y.R.H.  being fully aware that I am always to be of service to you. I have another  favor to ask of Y.R.H., which I hope you will graciously accede. Will  Y.R.H. be so kind as to grant me a testimonial to the following effect:  \"That I wrote the Grand Mass expressly for Y.R.H.; that it has been for  some time in your possession; and that you have been pleased to permit me  to circulate it.\" This ought to have been the case, and being no untruth, I  hope I may claim this favor. Such a testimonial will be of great service to  me; for how could I have believed that my slight talents would have exposed  me to so much envy, persecution, and calumny. It has always been my  intention to ask Y.R.H.'s permission to circulate the Mass, but the  pressure of circumstances, and above all my inexperience in worldly  matters, as well as my feeble health, has caused this confusion.    If the Mass is engraved hereafter, I hope to dedicate it to Y.R.H. when  published,[1] and not till then will the limited list of royal subscribers  appear. I shall ever consider Y.R.H. as my most illustrious patron, and  make this known to the world whenever it is in my power. In conclusion, I  entreat you again not to refuse my request about the testimonial. It will  only cost Y.R.H. a few lines, and ensure the best results for me.    I will bring the Variations[2] of Y.R.H. with me. They require little  alteration, and cannot fail to become a very pretty pleasing work for all  lovers of music. I must indeed appear a most importunate suitor. I beg you  will kindly send me the testimonial as soon as possible, for I require it.    [K.]    [Footnote 1: The Grand Mass (_Op._ 123) was published in 1827.]    [Footnote 2: The _Variations_ composed by the Archduke Rudolph, mentioned  in the letters 345 and 351, are not the same as the published ones, and are  unknown.]      346.    TO F. RIES.    Hetzendorf, July 16, 1823.    MY DEAR RIES,--    I received your letter with much pleasure the day before yesterday. The  Variations have, no doubt, arrived by this time. I could not write the  dedication to your wife, not knowing her name; so I beg you will write it  yourself on the part of your wife's friend and your own; let it be a  surprise to her, for the fair sex like that.--_Entre nous_, surprise is  always the greatest charm of the beautiful! As for the _Allegri di  Bravura_, I must make allowance for yours. To tell you the truth, I am no  great friend to that kind of thing, as it is apt to entail too much mere  mechanism; at least, such is the case with those I know. I have not yet  looked at yours, but I shall ask ---- about them. I recommend you to be  cautious in your intercourse with him. Could I not be of use to you in many  ways here? These printers, or rather _misprinters_, as they ought to be  called to deserve their names, pirate your works, and give you nothing in  return; this, surely, might be differently managed. I mean to send you some  choruses shortly, even if obliged to compose some new ones, for this is my  favorite style.    Thanks for the proceeds of the _bagatelles_, with which I am quite  satisfied. Give nothing to the King of England. Pray accept anything you  can get for the Variations. I shall be perfectly contented.

The whole house from pit to galleries was soon filled, and  when the composer entered the orchestra, there was a roar of applause,  which it seemed would never end. As the performance proceeded, the  listeners became more charmed and carried away, and at the close there  was a wild scene of excitement. The success had been tremendous, and  the frequent repetitions demanded soon filled the treasury of the  theater. Everybody was happy, the composer most of all. The melodies  were played on every piano in Germany and whistled by every street  urchin. Its fame spread like lightning over Europe, and quickly  reached England. In London the whole atmosphere seemed to vibrate with  its melodies. In Paris, however, it did not please on first hearing,  perhaps because it was so thoroughly German. But somewhat later, when  renamed \"Robin des Bois,\"--\"Robin of the Forest,\"--it was performed  some three hundred and fifty times before being withdrawn.    Weber kept ever at work. Two years after the production of \"Der  Freischuetz\" the opera of \"Euryanthe\" was completed. The libretto was  the work of a half demented woman, Helmine von Chezy, but Weber set  out to produce the best opera he was capable of, and to this story he  has joined some wonderful music. It was his favorite work; he wrote  to his beloved wife two hours before the first performance: \"I rely  on God and my 'Euryanthe.'\" The opera was produced at the Kaernthnertor  Theater, in Vienna, on October 25, 1823. The composer, though weak and  ill, made the long journey to the great city, that he might personally  introduce his favorite to the Viennese. He wrote his wife after the  performance: \"Thank God, as I do, beloved wife, for the glorious  success of 'Euryanthe.' Weary as I am, I must still say a sweet good  night to my beloved Lina, and cry Victory! All the company seemed in  a state of ecstasy; singers, chorus, orchestra;--all were drunk, as it  were, with joy.\"    The title role was taken by Henrietta Sontag, a young girl, still in  her teens, though giving high promise of the great things she achieved  a few years later. Strange to say, a short time after its first  appearance, \"Euryanthe\" failed to draw. One reason might have been  laid to the poor libretto, another to the rumor, started, it is said,  by no less an authority than the great master Beethoven, that the  music of the opera was \"only a collection of diminished sevenths.\"    The composer lost no time in laying his score before Beethoven, who  said he should have visited him _before_, not _after_ the performance.  He advised him to do what he himself had done to \"Fidelio,\" cut out  nearly a third of the score. Weber took this advice, and remade parts  of the opera, where he deemed it necessary.    The strain of the production of \"Euryanthe\" told severely on the  composer's delicate health, and he returned to Dresden in an exhausted  state. There was no rest for him here, as official duties were  pressing. The malady afflicting his lungs had made rapid progress and  he began to fear he should not be long spared to his wife and little  ones.    He shook off the apathy and took up his pen once more. His fame  was known all over Europe and many tempting offers came in from all  directions. One of these was from Covent Garden Theater, London, in  the summer of 1824, which resulted in a visit to the English capital.  Charles Kemble, the director of Covent Garden, desired Weber to write  a new opera for production there. \"Oberon\" was the subject at last  decided upon; it was taken from an old French romance. Weber at once  set to work on the music of this fairy opera, and with the exception  of the overture, had finished the work in time to bring it to London  in 1826. He was ill and suffering at the time he left home, February  7, and it seemed as though he were bidding a final good-by to his wife  and little ones.    Arrived in London, Sir George Smart invited him to take up his  residence in his house. Here he had every comfort, a beautiful piano  too was placed at his disposal by one of the first makers in London.  \"No King could be served with greater love and affection in all  things,\" he wrote; \"I cannot be sufficiently grateful to heaven for  the blessings which surround me.\" Here he composed the beautiful  Overture to \"Oberon\" which was only completed a few days before the  first performance of the opera.    \"Oberon\" was given at Covent Garden on April 12. The house was packed  from pit to dome, and the success was tremendous. Next morning the  composer was in a highly nervous and exhausted state, but felt he must  keep his promise to Kemble and conduct the first twelve performances  of \"Oberon.\" He was to have a benefit concert, and hoped through this  to have a goodly sum to take back to his little family. Sad to relate,  on the evening chosen, May 26, a heavy rain fell and the hall was  nearly empty. After the concert he was so weak he had to be assisted  from the room. The physician ordered postponement of the journey home,  but he cried continually, \"I must go to my own--I must! Let me see  them once more and then God's will be done.\"    The next morning, when they came to call him, all was still in his  chamber; he had passed away peacefully in sleep.    Weber was buried in London. His last wish--to return home,--was  finally fulfilled. Eighteen years after, his remains were brought to  Dresden, and the composer was at last at home.          IX    FRANZ SCHUBERT      In the old Lichtenthal quarter of the city of Vienna, in the vicinity  of the fortifications, there still stands an old house. It is  evidently a public house, for there hangs the sign--\"At the Red Crab.\"  Beside this there is a marble tablet fastened above the doorway, which  says that Franz Schubert was born in this house. At the right of his  name is placed a lyre crowned with a star, and at the left a laurel  wreath within which is placed the date, January 31, 1797.    This then was the birthplace of the \"most poetical composer who ever  lived,\" as Liszt said of him; the man who created over six hundred  songs, eight symphonies, operas, masses, chamber works and much  beautiful piano music, and yet only lived to be thirty-one. It is  almost unbelievable. Let us get a nearer view of this remarkable  musician.    His father kept a school here; there were five children, four boys and  a girl to provide for, and as there was nothing to depend on but  the school-master's pay, it is easy to see the family was in poor  circumstances, though the wife managed most carefully to make ends  meet. They were a very devoted family altogether. Little Franz early  showed a decided fondness for music, and tried to pick out bits  of tunes of his own by ear on an old dilapidated piano the family  possessed. He made friends with a young apprentice who took him  sometimes to a piano wareroom in the city, where he was allowed to  play his little tunes on a fine piano.    When Franz was seven he began to have music lessons at home, the  father teaching him violin and his big brother Ignaz, the piano.  Franz, in his eagerness to learn soon outstripped his home teachers,  and told them he could go on alone. It was then decided he should go  to the parish choir master, Holzer, to learn piano, violin, organ,  singing and thorough bass. Soon Holzer was astonished at the boy's  progress. \"Whenever I begin to teach him anything I find he knows  it already; I never had such a pupil before.\" By the time Franz was  eleven, his voice had come out so well that he was given the place of  head soprano in the parish church, and played violin solos whenever  they occurred in the service. He had even begun at home to compose and  write down little piano pieces and songs. The parents considered that  this remarkable talent should be cultivated further, if possible, in  order that it might assist the slender purse of the family. There was  a choir school, called the Convict, which trained its boys for the  Imperial Chapel. If Franz could prove his ability to enter this  school, he would receive free education in return for his services.    One fine morning in October, 1808, Franz in his homespun grey suit,  spectacles shielding his bright, near-sighted eyes, his bushy  black hair covered by an old fashioned hat, presented himself for  examination by the Court Capellmeister and the singing master. The  other boys jeered at his odd appearance, but he kept his good humor.  When his turn came to sing, after solving all the problems given, his  singing of the trial pieces was so astonishing that he was passed in  at once, and ordered to put on the uniform of the imperial choristers.    The boy soon found plenty to fill his time and occupy his mind. There  was the school orchestra, in which he was able to take a prominent  place. There was daily practise, in which the boys learned the  overtures and symphonies of Mozart and Haydn, and even Beethoven. He  loved best Mozart's \"Symphony in G minor,\" in which he said he heard  angels singing. The leader of the orchestra was attracted to the  lad's playing the very first day he entered, for he played with such  precision and understanding. One day Franz mustered courage to talk  a little to the big conductor, whose name was Spaun, and confessed he  had composed quite a good deal already, adding he would like to do  it every day, only he could not afford to get the music paper. Spaun  received this burst of confidence with sympathy, and saw to it that  the boy was, in the future, supplied with the necessary music paper.    Franz had soon made such progress on the violin, that he began to take  the first violin parts and when the conductor was absent he was asked  to lead the orchestra. Indeed by his deep earnestness and sincerity,  as well as ability, the gifted boy had become a power in the school.  When he went home to see his people, which could only be on Sundays  and holidays, it was a happy reunion for all. If"]]]
