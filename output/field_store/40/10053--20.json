Among the riches which Rome possessed,  the French commissioners also, by their choice selection, have  manifested the depth of their knowledge, and the justness of their  discrimination.    The alterations and embellishments made in the different apartments  of the GALLERY OF ANTIQUES have been executed under the immediate  direction of their author, M. RAYMOND, member of the National  Institute, and architect to the NATIONAL PALACE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES.  In winter, the apartments are kept warm by means of flues, which  diffuse a genial vapour. Here, without the expense of a single  _liard_, the young draughtsman may form his taste by studying the  true antique models of Grecian sculpture; the more experienced artist  may consult them as he finds occasion in the composition of his  subjects; while the connoisseur, the amateur, or the simple observer  may spend many an agreeable hour in contemplating these master-pieces  which, for centuries, have inspired universal admiration.    These are the materials on which Genius ought to work, and without  which the most promising talent may be greatly misapplied, if not  entirely lost. It was by studying closely these correct models, that  the great MICHAEL ANGELO, the, sublime RAPHAEL, and other eminent  masters, acquired that idea of excellence which is the result of the  accumulated experience of successive ages. Here, in one visit, the  student may imbibe those principles to ascertain which many artists  have consumed the best part of their days; and penetrated by their  effect, he is spared the laborious investigation by which they came  to be known and established. It is unnecessary to expatiate on the  advantages which the fine arts may expect to derive from such a  repository of antiques in a capital so centrical as Paris. The  contemplation of them cannot fail to fire the genius of any artist of  taste, and prompt his efforts towards the attainment of that grand  style, which, disdaining the minute accidental particularities of  individual objects, improves partial representation by the general  and invariable ideas of nature.    A vast collection of antiquities of every description is still  expected from Italy, among which are the _Venus of Medicis_ and the  _Pallas of Veletri_, a finely-preserved statue, classed by artists  among those of the first rank, dug up at _Veletri_ in 1799, in  consequence of the researches made there by order of the French  commissioners. Upwards of five hundred cases were lying on the banks  of the Tiber, at Rome, ready to be sent off to France, when the  Neapolitans entered that city. They carried them all away: but by the  last article of the treaty of peace with the king of Naples, the  whole of them are to be restored to the French Republic. For the  purpose of verifying their condition, and taking measures for their  conveyance to Paris, two commissioners have been dispatched to Italy:  one is the son of CHAPTAL, Minister of the Interior, and the other is  DUFOURNY, the architect. On the arrival of these cases, even after  the fifteen departmental Museums have been supplied, it is asserted  that there will yet remain in the French capital, antiquities in  sufficient number to form a museum almost from Paris to Versailles.    The CENTRAL MUSEUM OF THE ARTS is open to the public in general on  the 8th, 9th, and 10th of each decade;[1] the other days are  appropriated to the study of young pupils; but a foreigner has only  to produce his _permis de séjour_ to gain admission _gratis_ every  day from the hour of ten o'clock to four. To the credit of the  nation, I must observe that this exception in favour of foreigners  excites no jealousy whatever.    It is no more than a justice due to the liberality of the French  republican government to add, that they set a noble example which is  worthy of being followed, not only in England, but in every other  country, where the arts and sciences are honoured, or the general  interests of mankind held in estimation. From persons visiting any  national establishment, whether museum, library, cabinet, or garden,  in this capital, no sort of fee or perquisite is now expected, or  allowed to be taken. Although it was not a public day when I paid my  first visit to the CENTRAL MUSEUM, no sooner did I shew my _permis de  séjour_, than the doors were thrown open; and from M. VISCONTI, and  other members of the Council, who happened to be present, I  experienced the most polite and obliging attention. As an Englishman,  I confess that I felt a degree of shame on reflecting to what pitiful  exaction a foreigner would be subject, who might casually visit any  public object of curiosity in our metropolis.    [Footnote 1: By a subsequent regulation, Saturday and Sunday are the  days on which the CENTRAL MUSEUM is open to public inspection.]        LETTER IX.    _Paris, October 31, 1801._    In answer to your question, I shall begin by informing you that I  have not set eyes on the _petit caporal_, as some affect to style the  Chief Consul. He spends much of his time, I am told, at _Malmaison_,  his country-seat; and seldom appears in public, except in his box at  the Opera, or at the French theatre; but at the grand monthly parade,  I shall be certain to behold him, on the 15th of the present month of  Brumaire, according to the republican calendar, which day answers to  the 6th of November. I have therefore to check my impatience for a  week longer.    However, if I have not yet seen BONAPARTE himself, I have at least  seen a person who has seen him, and will take care that I shall have  an opportunity of seeing him too: this person is no less than a  general--who accompanied him in his expedition to Egypt--who was  among the chosen few that returned with him from that country--who  there surveyed the mouths of the Nile--who served under him in the  famous campaign of Syria; and who at this day is one of the first  military engineers in Europe. In a word, it is General A----y, of the  artillery, at present Director of that scientific establishment,  called the DÉPÔT DE LA GUERRE. He invited me the day before yesterday  to breakfast, with a view of meeting some of his friends whom he had  purposely assembled.    I am not fond of breakfasting from home; _mais il faut vivre à Rome  comme à Rome_. Between ten and eleven o'clock I reached the _Dépôt_,  which is situated in the _Rue de l'Université_, _Faubourg St,  Germain_, at the _ci-devant Hôtel d'Harcourt_, formerly belonging to  the duke of that name. Passing through the gate-way, I was proceeding  boldly to the principal entrance of the hotel, when a sentinel  stopped me short by charging his bayonet. \"Citizen,\" said he  fiercely, at the same time pointing to the lodge on the right, \"you  must speak to the porter.\" I accordingly obeyed the mandate. \"What's  your business, citizen?\" inquired the porter gruffly.--\"My business,  citizen,\" replied I, \"is only to breakfast with the general.\"--\"Be so  good, citizen,\" rejoined he in a milder tone, \"as to take the trouble  to ascend the grand stair-case, and ring the bell on the  first-floor.\"    Being introduced into the general's apartments, I there found eight  or ten persons of very intelligent aspect, seated at a round table,  loaded with all sorts of good things, but, in my mind, better  calculated for dinner than breakfast. Among a great variety of  delicacies, were beef-steaks, or, as they are here termed, _bif-ticks  à l'Anglaise_. Oysters too were not forgotten: indeed, they compose  an essential part of a French breakfast; and the ladies seem  particularly partial to them, I suppose, because they are esteemed  strengthening to a delicate constitution.    Nothing could be more pleasant than this party. Most of the guests  were distinguished literati, or military men of no ordinary stamp.  One of the latter, a _chef de brigade_ of engineers, near whom I  considered myself fortunate in being placed, spoke to me in the  highest terms of Mr. SPENCER SMITH, Sir Sidney's brother, to whose  interference at _Constantinople_, he was indebted for his release  from a Turkish prison.    Notwithstanding the continual clatter of knives and forks, and the  occasional gingle of glasses, the conversation, which suffered no  interruption, was to me extremely interesting: I never heard any men  express opinions more liberal on every subject that was started. It  was particularly gratifying to my feelings, as an Englishman, to hear  a set of French gentlemen, some of whom had participated in the sort  of disgrace attached to the raising of the siege of _St. Jean  d'Acre_, generously bestow just encomiums on my brother-officer, to  whose heroism they owed their failure. Addison, I think, says,  somewhere in the Spectator, that national prejudice is a laudable  partiality; but, however laudable it may be to indulge such a  partiality, it ought not to render us blind to the merit of  individuals of a rival nation.    General A----y, being one of those whose talents have been found too  useful to the State to be suffered to remain in inaction, was obliged  to attend at the _Conseil des Mines_ soon after twelve o'clock, when  the party separated. Just as I was taking leave, he did me the favour  to put into my hand a copy of his _Histoire du Canal du Midi_, of  which I shall say more when I have had leisure to peruse it.    I do not know that a man in good health, who takes regular exercise,  is the worse for breakfasting on a beef-steak, in the long-exploded  style of Queen Bess; but I am no advocate for all the accessories of  a French _déjeûner à la fourchette_. The strong Mocha coffee which I  swallowed, could not check the more powerful effect of the Madeira  and _crème de rose_. I therefore determined on taking a long walk,  which, when saddle-horses are not to be procured, I have always found  the best remedy for the kind of restlessness created by such a  breakfast.    I accordingly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/90"],[0,"The Son of Tarzan (#16)"],[1,"his kind, was too wise to make  their presence known until the frenzy of the dance had passed.  After  the drum was quiet and the bellies of the tribe well-filled he would  hail them.  Then would come a parley, after which he and Korak would be  accepted into membership by the community.  There might be those who  would object; but such could be overcome by brute force, of which he  and the lad had an ample surplus.  For weeks, possibly months, their  presence might cause ever decreasing suspicion among others of the  tribe; but eventually they would become as born brothers to these  strange apes.    He hoped that they had been among those who had known Tarzan, for that  would help in the introduction of the lad and in the consummation of  Akut's dearest wish, that Korak should become king of the apes.  It was  with difficulty, however, that Akut kept the boy from rushing into the  midst of the dancing anthropoids--an act that would have meant the  instant extermination of them both, since the hysterical frenzy into  which the great apes work themselves during the performance of their  strange rites is of such a nature that even the most ferocious of the  carnivora give them a wide berth at such times.    As the moon declined slowly toward the lofty, foliaged horizon of the  amphitheater the booming of the drum decreased and lessened were the  exertions of the dancers, until, at last, the final note was struck and  the huge beasts turned to fall upon the feast they had dragged hither  for the orgy.    From what he had seen and heard Akut was able to explain to Korak that  the rites proclaimed the choosing of a new king, and he pointed out to  the boy the massive figure of the shaggy monarch, come into his  kingship, no doubt, as many human rulers have come into theirs--by the  murder of his predecessor.    When the apes had filled their bellies and many of them had sought the  bases of the trees to curl up in sleep Akut plucked Korak by the arm.    \"Come,\" he whispered.  \"Come slowly.  Follow me.  Do as Akut does.\"    Then he advanced slowly through the trees until he stood upon a bough  overhanging one side of the amphitheater.  Here he stood in silence for  a moment.  Then he uttered a low growl.  Instantly a score of apes  leaped to their feet.  Their savage little eyes sped quickly around the  periphery of the clearing.  The king ape was the first to see the two  figures upon the branch.  He gave voice to an ominous growl.  Then he  took a few lumbering steps in the direction of the intruders.  His hair  was bristling.  His legs were stiff, imparting a halting, jerky motion  to his gait.  Behind him pressed a number of bulls.    He stopped just a little before he came beneath the two--just far  enough to be beyond their spring.  Wary king!  Here he stood rocking  himself to and fro upon his short legs, baring his fangs in hideous  grinnings, rumbling out an ever increasing volume of growls, which were  slowly but steadily increasing to the proportions of roars.  Akut knew  that he was planning an attack upon them.  The old ape did not wish to  fight.  He had come with the boy to cast his lot with the tribe.    \"I am Akut,\" he said.  \"This is Korak.  Korak is the son of Tarzan who  was king of the apes.  I, too, was king of the apes who dwelt in the  midst of the great waters.  We have come to hunt with you, to fight  with you.  We are great hunters.  We are mighty fighters.  Let us come  in peace.\"    The king ceased his rocking.  He eyed the pair from beneath his  beetling brows.  His bloodshot eyes were savage and crafty.  His  kingship was very new and he was jealous of it.  He feared the  encroachments of two strange apes.  The sleek, brown, hairless body of  the lad spelled \"man,\" and man he feared and hated.    \"Go away!\" he growled.  \"Go away, or I will kill you.\"    The eager lad, standing behind the great Akut, had been pulsing with  anticipation and happiness.  He wanted to leap down among these hairy  monsters and show them that he was their friend, that he was one of  them.  He had expected that they would receive him with open arms, and  now the words of the king ape filled him with indignation and sorrow.  The blacks had set upon him and driven him away.  Then he had turned to  the white men--to those of his own kind--only to hear the ping of  bullets where he had expected words of cordial welcome.  The great apes  had remained his final hope.  To them he looked for the companionship  man had denied him.  Suddenly rage overwhelmed him.    The king ape was almost directly beneath him.  The others were formed  in a half circle several yards behind the king.  They were watching  events interestedly.  Before Akut could guess his intention, or  prevent, the boy leaped to the ground directly in the path of the king,  who had now succeeded in stimulating himself to a frenzy of fury.    \"I am Korak!\" shouted the boy.  \"I am the Killer.  I came to live among  you as a friend.  You want to drive me away.  Very well, then, I shall  go; but before I go I shall show you that the son of Tarzan is your  master, as his father was before him--that he is not afraid of your  king or you.\"    For an instant the king ape had stood motionless with surprise.  He had  expected no such rash action upon the part of either of the intruders.  Akut was equally surprised.  Now he shouted excitedly for Korak to come  back, for he knew that in the sacred arena the other bulls might be  expected to come to the assistance of their king against an outsider,  though there was small likelihood that the king would need assistance.  Once those mighty jaws closed upon the boy's soft neck the end would  come quickly.  To leap to his rescue would mean death for Akut, too;  but the brave old ape never hesitated.  Bristling and growling, he  dropped to the sward just as the king ape charged.    The beast's hands clutched for their hold as the animal sprang upon the  lad.  The fierce jaws were wide distended to bury the yellow fangs  deeply in the brown hide.  Korak, too, leaped forward to meet the  attack; but leaped crouching, beneath the outstretched arms.  At the  instant of contact the lad pivoted on one foot, and with all the weight  of his body and the strength of his trained muscles drove a clenched  fist into the bull's stomach.  With a gasping shriek the king ape  collapsed, clutching futilely for the agile, naked creature nimbly  sidestepping from his grasp.    Howls of rage and dismay broke from the bull apes behind the fallen  king, as with murder in their savage little hearts they rushed forward  upon Korak and Akut; but the old ape was too wise to court any such  unequal encounter.  To have counseled the boy to retreat now would have  been futile, and Akut knew it.  To delay even a second in argument  would have sealed the death warrants of them both.  There was but a  single hope and Akut seized it.  Grasping the lad around the waist he  lifted him bodily from the ground, and turning ran swiftly toward  another tree which swung low branches above the arena.  Close upon  their heels swarmed the hideous mob; but Akut, old though he was and  burdened by the weight of the struggling Korak, was still fleeter than  his pursuers.    With a bound he grasped a low limb, and with the agility of a little  monkey swung himself and the boy to temporary safety.  Nor did he  hesitate even here; but raced on through the jungle night, bearing his  burden to safety.  For a time the bulls pursued; but presently, as the  swifter outdistanced the slower and found themselves separated from  their fellows they abandoned the chase, standing roaring and screaming  until the jungle reverberated to their hideous noises.  Then they  turned and retraced their way to the amphitheater.    When Akut felt assured that they were no longer pursued he stopped and  released Korak.  The boy was furious.    \"Why did you drag me away?\" he cried.  \"I would have taught them!  I  would have taught them all!  Now they will think that I am afraid of  them.\"    \"What they think cannot harm you,\" said Akut.  \"You are alive.  If I  had not brought you away you would be dead now and so would I.  Do you  not know that even Numa slinks from the path of the great apes when  there are many of them and they are mad?\"          Chapter 9      It was an unhappy Korak who wandered aimlessly through the jungle the  day following his inhospitable reception by the great apes.  His heart  was heavy from disappointment.  Unsatisfied vengeance smoldered in his  breast.  He looked with hatred upon the denizens of his jungle world,  baring his fighting fangs and growling at those that came within  radius of his senses.  The mark of his father's early life was strong  upon him and enhanced by months of association with beasts, from whom  the imitative faculty of youth had absorbed a countless number of  little mannerisms of the predatory creatures of the wild.    He bared his fangs now as naturally and upon as slight provocation as  Sheeta, the panther, bared his.  He growled as ferociously as Akut  himself.  When he came suddenly upon another beast his quick crouch  bore a strange resemblance to the arching of a cat's back.  Korak, the  killer, was looking for trouble.  In his heart of hearts he hoped to  meet the king ape who had driven him from the amphitheater.  To this  end he insisted upon remaining in the vicinity; but the exigencies of  the perpetual search for food led them several miles further away  during day.    They were moving slowly down wind, and warily because the advantage was  with whatever beast might chance to be hunting ahead of them, where  their scent-spoor was being borne by the light breeze.  Suddenly the  two halted simultaneously.  Two heads were cocked upon one side.  Like  creatures hewn from solid rock they stood immovable, listening.  Not a  muscle quivered.  For several seconds they remained thus, then Korak  advanced cautiously a few yards and"]]]
