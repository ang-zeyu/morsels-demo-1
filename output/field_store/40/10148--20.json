Even far away from Paris, in the heart of the  provinces, the king's irregularities were known and dreaded.  In 1524,  some few weeks after the death [at Blois, July 20, 1524] of his wife,  Queen Claude, daughter of Louis XII., a virtuous and modest princess more  regretted by the people than by her husband, Francis made his entry into  Manosque, in Provence.  The burgesses had the keys of their town  presented to him by the most beautiful creature they could find within  their walls; it was the daughter of Antony Voland, one of themselves.  The virtuous young girl was so frightened at the king's glances and the  signs he made to his gentry, evidently alluding to her, that, on  returning home, she got some burning sulphur and placed herself for a  long while under the influence of its vapor, in order to destroy the  beauty which made her run the risk of being only too pleasing to the  king.  Francis, who was no great or able captain, could not resist the  temptations of war any more than those of the flesh.  When Bourbon and  the imperial army had evacuated Provence, the king loudly proclaimed his  purpose of pursuing them into Italy, and of once more going forth to the  conquest of Milaness, and perhaps also of the kingdom of Naples, that  incurable craze of French kings in the sixteenth century.  In vain did  his most experienced warriors, La Tremoille and Chabannes, exert  themselves to divert him from such a campaign, for which he was not  prepared; in vain did his mother herself write to him, begging him to  wait and see her, for that she had important matters to impart to him.  He answered by sending her the ordinance which conferred upon her the  regency during his absence; and, at the end of October, 1524, he had  crossed the Alps, anxious to go and risk in Milaness the stake he had  just won in Provence against Charles V.    Arriving speedily in front of Milan, he there found the imperial army  which had retired before him; there was a fight in one of the outskirts;  but Bourbon recognized the impossibility of maintaining a siege in a town  of which the fortifications were in ruins, and with disheartened troops.  On the line of march which they had pursued, from Lodi to Milan, there  was nothing to be seen but cuirasses, arquebuses tossed hither and  thither, dead horses, and men dying of fatigue and scarcely able to drag  themselves along.  Bourbon evacuated Milan, and, taking a resolution as  bold as it was singular, abruptly abandoned, so far as he was personally  concerned, that defeated and disorganized army, to go and seek for and  reorganize another at a distance.  Being informed that Charles III., Duke  of Savoy, hitherto favorable to France, was secretly inclining towards  the emperor, he went to Turin, made a great impression by his confidence  and his grand spirit in the midst of misfortune upon both the duke and  his wife, Beatrix of Portugal, and obtained from them not only a  flattering reception, but a secret gift of their money and their jewelry;  and, equipped with these resources, he passed into Germany to recruit  soldiers there.  The lanzknechts, who had formerly served under him in  France, rushed to him in shoals; he had received from nature the gifts  most calculated to gain the hearts of campaigners: kind, accessible,  affable and even familiar with the common soldier, he entered into the  details of his wants and alleviated them.  His famous bravery, his  frankness, and his generosity gained over those adventurers who were  weary of remaining idle; their affection consoled Bourbon and stood him  in stead of all: his army became his family and his camp his country.  Proscribed and condemned in France, without any position secured to him  in the dominions of Charles V., envied and crossed by that prince's  generals, he had found full need of all the strong tempering of his  character and of his warlike genius to keep him from giving way under so  many trials.  He was beginning to feel himself near recovery: he had an  army, an army of his own; he had chosen for it men inured to labor and  fatigue, accustomed to strict discipline; and thereto he added five  hundred horsemen from Franche-Comte for whose devotion and courage he  could answer: and he gave the second command in this army to George of  Freundsberg, an old captain of lanzknechts and commandant of the  emperor's guard, the same who, three years before, on seeing Luther  boldly enter Worms, said to him, with a slap on the shoulder, \"Little  monk, this is a daring step thou art going to take!  Nor I, nor any  captain of us, ever did the like.  If thy cause is good, and if thou have  faith in thy cause, forward! little monk, in God's name forward!\"  With  such comrades about him, Bourbon re-entered Milaness at the head of  twelve or thirteen thousand fighting men, three months after having left  it, alone and moneyless.  His rivals about the person of Charles V.,  Lannoy, Viceroy of Naples, and the Marquis of Pescara, could not help  admiring him, and he regained in the imperial camp an ascendency which  had but lately been very much shaken.    He found the fresh campaign begun in earnest.  Francis I.'s veteran  generals, Marshals La Tremoille and Chabannes, had advised him to pursue  without pause the beaten and disorganized imperial army, which was in  such plight that there was placarded on the statue of Pasquin at Rome,  \"Lost--an army--in the mountains of Genoa; if anybody knows what has  become of it, let him come forward and say: he shall be well rewarded.\"  If the King of France, it was said, drove back northward and forced into  the Venetian dominions the remnants of this army, the Spaniards would not  be able to hold their own in Milaness, and would have to retire within  the kingdom of Naples.  But Admiral Bonnivet, \"whose counsel the king  made use of more than of any other,\" says Du Bellay, pressed Francis I.  to make himself master, before everything, of the principal strong places  in Lombardy, especially of Pavia, the second city in the duchy of Milan.  Francis followed this counsel, and on the 26th of August, 1524, twenty  days after setting out from Aix in Provence, he appeared with his army in  front of Pavia.  On learning this resolution, Pescara joyously exclaimed,  \"We were vanquished; a little while and we shall be vanquishers.\"  Pavia  had for governor a Spanish veteran, Antony de Leyva, who had  distinguished himself at the battle of Ravenna, in 1512, by his vigilance  and indomitable tenacity: and he held out for nearly four months, first  against assaults, and then against investment by the French army.  Francis I. and his generals occasionally proceeded during this siege to  severities condemned by the laws and usages of war.  A small Spanish  garrison had obstinately defended a tower situated at the entrance of a  stone bridge which led from an island on the Ticino into Pavia.  Marshal  de Montmorency at last carried the tower, and had all the defenders  hanged \"for having dared,\" he said, \"to offer resistance to an army of  the king's in such a pigeon-hole.\"  Antony de Leyva had the bridge  forthwith broken down, and De Montmorency was stopped on the borders of  the Ticino.  In spite of the losses of its garrison in assaults and  sorties, and in spite of the sufferings of the inhabitants from famine  and from lack of resources of all sorts, Pavia continued to hold out.  There was a want of wood as well as of bread; and they knocked the houses  to pieces for fuel.  Antony de Leyva caused to be melted down the vessels  of the churches and the silvern chandeliers of the university, and even a  magnificent chain of gold which he habitually wore round his neck.  He  feared he would have to give in at last, for want of victuals and  ammunition, when, towards the end of January, 1525, he saw appearing, on  the northern side, the flags of the imperial army: it was Bourbon,  Lannoy, and Pescara, who were coming up with twenty thousand foot, seven  hundred men-at-arms, a troop of Spanish arquebusiers, and several pieces  of cannon.  Bourbon, whilst on the march, had written, on the 5th of  January, to Henry VIII., and, after telling him what he meant to do, had  added, \"I know through one of my servants that the French have said that  I retired from Provence shamefully.  I remained there a space of three  months and eight days, waiting for battle.  I hope to give the world to  know that I have no fear of King Francis, for, please God, we shall place  ourselves so close together that we shall have great trouble to get  disentangled without battle, and I shall so do that neither he nor they  who have held such talk about me shall say that I was afraid of being  there.\"  The situation was from that moment changed.  The French army  found themselves squeezed between the fortress which would not surrender  and the imperial army which was coming to relieve it.  Things, however,  remained stationary for three weeks.  Francis I. intrenched himself  strongly in his camp, which the Imperialists could not attack without  great risk of unsuccess.  \"Pavia is doomed to fall,\" wrote Francis to his  mother the regent on the 3d of February, \"if they do not reenforce it  somehow; and they are beating about to make it hold on to the last gasp,  which, I think, will not be long now, for it is more than a month since  those inside have had no wine to drink and neither meat nor cheese to  eat; they are short of powder even.\"  Antony de Leyva gave notice to the  Imperialists that the town was not in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11956"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 6 (#17)"],[1,"arrangement, about which their glory and the honor of  their monarchy would render them very sensitive.  I should thereby drive  them to union with Alberoni, whereas, if a war were necessary to carry  our point, we ought to be able to say what Count Grammont said to the  king: \"At the time when we served your Majesty against Cardinal Mazarin.  Then the Spaniards themselves would help us.\"  In the result, France and  England left Holland and Savoy free to accede to the treaty; but, if  Spain refused to do so voluntarily within a specified time, the allies  engaged to force her thereto by arms.    The Hollanders hesitated; the Spanish ambassador at the Hague had a medal  struck representing the quadruple alliance as a coach on the point of  falling, because it rested on only three wheels.  Certain advantages  secured to their commerce at last decided the States-general.  Victor  Amadeo regretfully acceded to the treaty which robbed him of Sicily; he  was promised one of the Regent's daughters for his son.    Alberoni refused persistently to accede to the great coalition brought  about by Dubois.  Lord Stanhope proposed to go over to Spain in order to  bring him round.  \"If my lord comes as a lawgiver,\" said the cardinal,  \"he may spare himself the journey.  If he comes as a mediator I will  receive him; but in any case I warn him that, at the first attack upon  our vessels by an English squadron, Spain has not an inch of ground on  which I would answer for his person.\"  Lord Stanhope, nevertheless, set  out for Spain, and had the good fortune to leave it in time, though  without any diplomatic success.  Admiral Byng, at the head of the English  fleet, had destroyed the Spanish squadron before Messina; the troops  which occupied Palermo found themselves blockaded without hope of relief,  and the nascent navy of Spain was strangled at the birth.  Alberoni, in  his fury, had the persons and goods seized of English residents settled  in Spain, drove out the consuls, and orders were given at Madrid that no  tongue should wag about the affairs of Sicily.  The hope of a sudden  surprise in England, on behalf of the Jacobites, had been destroyed by  the death of the King of Sweden, Charles XII., killed on the 12th of  December, 1718, at Freiderishalt, in Norway; the flotilla equipped by  Alberoni for Chevalier St. George, had been dispersed and beaten by the  elements; the Pretender henceforth was considered to cost Spain too dear;  he had just been sent away from her territory at the moment when the  conspiracy of Cellamare failed in France; in spite of the feverish  activity of his mind, and the frequently chimerical extent of his  machinations, Alberoni remained isolated in Europe, without ally and  without support.    The treaty of the quadruple alliance had at last come to be definitively  signed; Marshal d'Huxelles, head of the council of foreign affairs, an  enemy to Dubois, and displeased at not having been invited to take part  in the negotiations, at first refused his signature.  [_Memoires de St.  Simon,_ t. xix.  p. 365.]  \"At the first word the Regent spoke to him, he  received nothing but bows, and the marshal went home to sulk; caresses,  excuses, reasons, it was all of no use; Huxelles declared to the Marquis  of Effiat, who had been despatched to him, that he would have his hand  cut off rather than sign.  The Duke of Orleans grew impatient, and took a  resolution very foreign to his usual weakness; he sent D'Antin to Marshal  d'Huxelles, bidding him to make choice of this: either to sign or lose  his place, of which the Regent would immediately dispose in favor of  somebody who would not be so intractable (_farouclae_) as he.  O, mighty  power of orvietan (_a counterpoison_)!  This man so independent, this  great citizen, this courageous minister, had no sooner heard the threat,  and felt that it would be carried into effect, than he bowed his head  beneath his huge hat, which he always had on, and signed right off,  without a word.  He even read the treaty to the council of regency in a  low and trembling voice, and when the Regent asked his opinion, 'the  opinion of the treaty,' he answered, between his teeth, with a bow.\"  Some days later appeared, almost at the same time--the 17th of December,  1718, and the 9th of January, 1719--the manifestoes of England and  France, proclaiming the resolution of making war upon Spain, whilst  Philip V., by a declaration of December 25th, 1718, pronounced all  renunciations illusory, and proclaimed his right to the throne of France  in case of the death of Louis XV.  At the same time he made an appeal to  an assembly of the States-general against the tyranny of the Regent, \"who  was making alliances,\" he said, \"with the enemies of the two crowns.\"    For once, in a way, Alberoni indulged the feelings of the king his  master, and, in spite of the good will felt by a part of the grandees  towards France, Spain was, on the whole, with him; he no longer felt  himself to be threatened, as he had been a few months before, when the  king's illness had made him tremble for his greatness, and perhaps for  his life.  He kept the monarch shut up in his room, refusing entrance to  even the superior officers of the palace.  [_Memoires de St. Simon,_  t. xv.]  \"The Marquis of Villena, major-domo major, having presented  himself there one afternoon, one of the valets inside half opened the  door, and told him, with much embarrassment, that he was forbidden to let  him in.  'You are insolent, sir,' replied the marquis; 'that cannot be.'  He pushed; the door against the valet and went in.  The marquis, though  covered with glory, being very weak on his legs, thus advances with short  steps, leaning on his little stick.  The queen and the cardinal see him,  and look at one another.  The king was too ill to take notice of  anything, and his curtains were drawn.  The cardinal, seeing the marquis  approach, went up to him, and represented to him that the king wished to  be alone, and begged him to go away.  'That is not true,' said the  marquis.  'I kept my eye upon you, and the king never said a word to  you.'  The cardinal, insisting, took him by the arm to make him go out;  what with the heat of the moment, and what with the push, the marquis,  being feeble, fell into an arm-chair which happened to be by.  Wroth at  his fall, he raises his stick and brings it down with all his might,  hammer and tongs, about the cardinal's ears, calling him a little rascal,  a little hound, who deserved nothing short of the stirrup-leathers.  When  he did at last go out, the queen had looked on from her seat at this  adventure all through, without moving or saying a word, and so had the  few who were in the room, without daring to stir.  The curious thing is,  that the cardinal, mad as he was, but taken completely by surprise at the  blows, did not defend himself, and thought of nothing but getting clear.  The same evening the marquis was exiled to his estates, without ever  wanting to return from them, until the fall of Alberoni.\"  Alberoni has  sometimes been compared to the great cardinals who had governed France.  To say nothing of the terror with which Richelieu inspired the grandees,  who detested him, the Prince of Coude would not have dared to touch  Cardinal Mazarin with the tip of his cane, even when the latter \"kissed  his boots\" in the courtyard of the castle at Havre.    Alberoni had persuaded his master that the French were merely awaiting  the signal to rise in his favor; the most odious calumnies were  everywhere circulating against the Regent; he did not generally show that  he was at all disturbed or offended by them; however, when the poem of  the Philippics by La Grange appeared, he desired to see it; the Duke of  St. Simon took it to him.  \"'Read it to me,' said the Regent.  'That I  will never do, Monseigneur,' said I.  He then took it and read it quite  low, standing up in the window of his little winter-closet, where we  were.  All at once I saw him change countenance, and turn towards me,  tears in his eyes, and very near fainting.  'All,' said he to me, 'this  is too bad, this horrid thing is too much for me.'  He had lit upon the  passage where the scoundrel had represented the Duke of Orleans purposing  to poison the king, and all ready to commit his crime.  I have never seen  man so transfixed, so deeply moved, so overwhelmed by a calumny so  enormous and so continuous.  I had all the pains in the world to bring  him round a little.\"  King Louis XV., who had no love and scarcely any  remembrance, preserved all his life some affection for the Regent, and  sincere gratitude for the care which the latter had lavished upon him.  The Duke of Orleans had never desired the crown for himself, and the  attentions full of tender respect which he had shown the little king had  made upon the child an impression which was never effaced.    The preparations for war with Spain meanwhile continued; the Prince of  Conti was nominally at the head of the army, Marshal Berwick was  intrusted with the command.  He accepted it, in spite of his old  connections with Spain, the benefits which Philip V.  had heaped upon  him, and the presence of his eldest son, the Duke of Liria, in the  Spanish ranks.  There were others who attached more importance to  gratitude.  Berwick thought very highly of lieutenant-general Count  D'Asfeldt, and desired to have him in his army; the Duke of Orleans spoke  to him about it.  \"Monseigneur,\" answered D'Asfeldt, \"I am a Frenchman, I  owe you everything, I have nothing to expect save from you, but,\" taking  the Fleece in his hand and showing it, \"what would you have me do with  this, which I hold, with the king's permission, from the King of Spain,  if I were to serve against Spain, this being the greatest honor that I  could have received?\"  He phrased his repugnance so well, and softened it  down by so many expressions of attachment to the Duke of"]]]
