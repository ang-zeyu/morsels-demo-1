I had no time to lose, and,  moreover, should save my cloths by continuing on the line I was  travelling. For though I should have to cross the hills where they  were occupied by the Habr Gerhajis, in the new way my track would pass  so near to the Warsingali frontier, that that tribe would not have  strength enough to demand anything from me, and passport fees are only  given in such places to the extent to which they can be enforced.    The other people I met here were some Dulbahantas arming for the  fight. They said they were 4000 strong in cavalry, and were  slaughtering sheep wholesale for provision on the road. Each man  carried a junk of flesh, a skin of water, and a little hay, and was  then ready for a long campaign, for they were not soft like the  English (their general boast), who must have their daily food; they  were hardy enough to work without eating ten days in succession, if  the emergency required it. Here a second camel was on the point of  dying, when his flesh was saved from becoming carrion by a knife being  passed across his throat.    21st.--The Abban slipped away on the 19th, when I was out  specimen-hunting, and would not come again till to-day, and then even  returned to give his wife a last salute, permitting me to advance to a  watercourse called Hanfallal, whilst he would join me on the following  day. This day we accomplished ten miles, and made a kraal about four  miles north of our old line of march.    22d.--As the Abban did not keep his promise, and none of us knew the  road, I now tried to prevail on his mother Awado, who was tending her  flocks close by, to be my guide, which she readily consented to do, as  she was anxious herself to go to Bunder Gori. The water found here was  in a circular cleft of limestone, sixty feet below the surface, which  was so small, only one person at a time could descend to it; and the  supply was so limited, I was obliged to keep my men down there all  night, to be the first for drawing in the morning. Gazelles were very  abundant, and in the evening we were visited by a very singular-looking  canine animal, which unfortunately I could not get a shot at. It was a  little less in size than the Crocuta hyena, but inclined rather more,  in its general shape, to a wolf than a hyena. The body was a pure  black, like the black Tibet wolf, but the tail was tipped with white.  I am not aware that this animal has ever been described.    23d.--At the usual starting-hour the Abban arrived, with two ponies  belonging to his brother-in-law, Husayn Ali, but which he tried to  pass off as his own, being ever very anxious to make me believe he was  a large stock proprietor, to magnify his importance. But,  unfortunately for him, the interpreter, who was as treacherous a man  as any of the breed, although he often confounded me by his innate  deceit, also peached at times upon his brother Sumunter. The Abban, on  seeing his mother equipped and ready on her donkey to go with me,  scolded her heartily for presuming to undertake the journey without  his leave, and sent her home faster than she came. We now commenced  the march, and travelled five miles diagonally across some low spurs  of hills, and encamped in the evening in a broad, deep, dry nullah, at  a place called Dalmallé. We brought water with us, and fortunate it  was so, for none could be found anywhere near the camp.    24th.--We started early in the morning, ascending the hill-range by a  steep winding footpath up one of its ridges, which, in respect to its  barrenness and soil, resembled the descent I had from Yafir. After  completing eleven miles' march, the caravan crested the hill opposite  Ras[21] Galwéni, travelled a short way on the flat of the summit, and  encamped in the evening amongst some thick jungle on its north or  seaward side, at a kraal called Gobamiré.    Immediately on arriving, as we commenced to unload the camels, a  number of men who were occupying that district--the Urus Sagé section  of the Habr Gerhajis tribe--seized the camels by their heads, and  demanded their customary fees, at the same time boisterously  gesticulating that they would help themselves if their request was not  complied with. Farhan enjoyed the row in the boisterous characteristic  manner of a Seedi--began dancing frantically the negro war-dance,  cocking his gun, and pointing it at everybody by turns; whilst  Sumunter and the other Warsingali began thumping them with their  clubs, and swearing a fearful vengeance would be wrought upon them by  their tribe, who were living within an hour or two's call, should they  not desist. The fact was, my men knew their power here, and, guided  only by animal passions, enjoyed showing it. The poor discomfited Urus  Sagé now slunk off like defeated dogs, or schoolboys returning from a  fight, just wishing to know if they were only to be considered in the  light of women, who could not maintain their own right, and, snarling  and snapping, threatened they would return again in stronger force  before the morning.    We then unloaded, and lay-to for the night. Immediately on reaching  the top of this range, a most interesting and novel sight was  presented to our view. We stepped in one instant from constant  sunshine into constant clouds, and saw what accounted for the dense  verdure of the north, as well as the extreme barrenness of the south  side of the hills. For two months we had not seen the vestige of a  cloud, or felt a drop of rain, and now we were at once launched into  the middle of the \"Dairti\" or north-east monsoon, which had been  pouring for some time previously against the north face of the  mountain, and was arrested there by it. It reminded me at once of that  marked phenomenon with which all travellers in the Himalaya Mountains,  who spend their \"hot-weather\" season at Chini, on the banks of the  Sutlege river, to escape rain, must be acquainted, when the clouds of  the great Indian monsoon envelop all the mountain-range for months  together on the weather or south-west side, and hang suspended on the  top of a high hill in sight of that place, but never pass over,  looking as if the mountain was too high to be surmounted by them, when  trying to reach the dry plateaux of Tibet. The clouds were rolling in  thick successive volumes at our feet, and obscured the view below us.    25th.--We were detained until noon in consequence of the Abban's  ponies, which had gone astray, and until then could not be found. In  the meanwhile the Urus Sagé came again, and tried to prevent us  loading, on the same plea as yesterday, but without effect; but when  we were starting, a compromise was effected on condition they would  escort us down the hill and guide the way. The road was steep and very  slippery, so that the camels could hardly get along, and this was  further increased by the thick strong green jungle-bushes, as well as  rocks and other difficulties incidental to mountain travelling with  such large and ungainly animals as laden camels. At the fourth mile we  found a large roomy cave under a rock, and put up for the night. Sheep  had been kept here, and the place was so full of fleas that the ground  was literally browned with them. I never saw such an astonishing  quantity congregated in one place; but we soon disposed of them by  burning certain boughs, which the Somali justly said was a specific  remedy against them.    26th and 27th.--During these two days we descended by a tortuous  winding footpath under no mean difficulties, and finally arrived,  after twelve miles' marching, at a place called Hundurgal, situated in  the hollow of a watercourse which divides the Warsingali from the Habr  Gerhajis frontiers, and transmits its waters to the Gulf at Ras  Galwéni. During the journey the Somali pointed out some of their  richest gum-trees, of which the finest in order is a species of  frankincense, called by them Falafala, or Luban Maiti. The gum of this  tree is especially valued by the Somali women for fumigating purposes,  which they apply to their bodies by sitting over it, when ignited, in  the same manner as Cashmeres sit over their little charcoal-pots to  keep themselves warm when resting on their travels. They enshroud  themselves in a large wrapper, place a pot with the burning gum  between their legs, and allow the perfume to rise to every portion of  their body simultaneously. We gave our guides five cloths for escort,  and sent them away.    I was informed by my men that under lee of Ras Galwéni there is a  better harbour than any on the whole coast-line, having deep water  close in to the shore, but, being neutral ground, the Warsingali will  not allow anybody to occupy it. They do not allow the Habr Gerhajis to  do so, as they would monopolise the trade; and they will not take it  themselves, as their sultan sagely remarks it would draw all their  force to one side of their possessions, and thus leave the other  exposed to attack from the Mijjertaines. Now the Dulbahantas are  obliged to come to Bunder Gori if they want to traffic with outer  nations, but were the Habr Gerhajis at Galwéni, this custom would be  drawn from them.    28th.--The inexpressible delight I felt at snuffing the fresh sea-air,  and being comparatively free from the tyranny of my persecutor  Sumunter, was truly indescribable; and I felt so impatient to end this  useless journey, and join my friends for the larger and more promising  one, I could hardly restrain my spirits. I stepped out before the  caravan was ready, and began the journey alone, when presently a rapid  fire, the discharge of a six-barrel revolver, attracted my attention.  This was done by the Abban, who said that whilst travelling there his  life was in jeopardy from the Habr Gerhajis, in consequence of an old  feud he had contracted with them,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8419"],[0,"The Journals of Lewis and Clark, 1804-1806 (#16)"],[1,"Lower  Side, on this hill Several Artificial Mounds were raised, from the top  of the highest of those Mounds I had an extensive view of the  Serounding Plains, which afforded one of the most pleasing prospects I  ever beheld, under me a Butifull River of Clear water of about 80 yards  wide Meandering thro a leavel and extensive Meadow, as far as I could  See, the prospect Much enlivened by the fine Trees & Srubs which is  bordering the bank of the river, and the Creeks & runs falling into  it,-.
