[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/956"],[0,"Tik-Tok of Oz (#16)"],[1,"y, they've been conquered before, if I remember aright,\" answered  Kaliko with a grin. \"Once I saw you running from a little girl named  Dorothy, and her friends, as if you were really afraid.\"    \"Well, I _was_ afraid, that time,\" admitted the Nome King, with a deep  sigh, \"for Dorothy had a Yellow Hen that laid eggs!\"    The King shuddered as he said \"eggs,\" and Kaliko also shuddered, and so  did the Long-Eared Hearer; for eggs are the only things that the nomes  greatly dread. The reason for this is that eggs belong on the earth's  surface, where birds and fowl of all sorts live, and there is something  about a hen's egg, especially, that fills a nome with horror. If by  chance the inside of an egg touches one of these underground people, he  withers up and blows away and that is the end of him--unless he manages  quickly to speak a magical word which only a few of the nomes know.  Therefore Ruggedo and his followers had very good cause to shudder at  the mere mention of eggs.    \"But Dorothy,\" said the King, \"is not with this band of invaders; nor  is the Yellow Hen. As for Tititi-Hoochoo, he has no means of knowing  that we are afraid of eggs.\"    \"You mustn't be too sure of that,\" Kaliko warned him. \"Tititi-Hoochoo  knows a great many things, being a fairy, and his powers are far  superior to any we can boast.\"    Ruggedo shrugged impatiently and turned to the Hearer.    \"Listen,\" said he, \"and tell me if you hear any eggs coming through the  Tube.\"    The Long-Eared one listened and then shook his head. But Kaliko laughed  at the King.    \"No one can hear an egg, Your Majesty,\" said he. \"The only way to  discover the truth is to look through the Magic Spyglass.\"    \"That's it!\" cried the King. \"Why didn't I think of it before? Look at  once, Kaliko!\"    So Kaliko went to the Spyglass and by uttering a mumbled charm he  caused the other end of it to twist around, so that it pointed down the  opening of the Tube. Then he put his eye to the glass and was able to  gaze along all the turns and windings of the Magic Spyglass and then  deep into the Tube, to where our friends were at that time falling.    \"Dear me!\" he exclaimed. \"Here comes a dragon.\"    \"A big one?\" asked Ruggedo.    \"A monster. He has an electric light on the end of his tail, so I can  see him very plainly. And the other people are all riding upon his  back.\"    \"How about the eggs?\" inquired the King.    Kaliko looked again.    \"I can see no eggs at all,\" said he; \"but I imagine that the dragon is  as dangerous as eggs. Probably Tititi-Hoochoo has sent him here to  punish you for dropping those strangers into the Forbidden Tube. I  warned you not to do it, Your Majesty.\"    This news made the Nome King anxious. For a few minutes he paced up and  down, stroking his long beard and thinking with all his might. After  this he turned to Kaliko and said:    \"All the harm a dragon can do is to scratch with his claws and bite  with his teeth.\"    \"That is not all, but it's quite enough,\" returned Kaliko earnestly.  \"On the other hand, no one can hurt a dragon, because he's the toughest  creature alive. One flop of his huge tail could smash a hundred nomes  to pancakes, and with teeth and claws he could tear even you or me into  small bits, so that it would be almost impossible to put us together  again. Once, a few hundred years ago, while wandering through some  deserted caverns, I came upon a small piece of a nome lying on the  rocky floor. I asked the piece of nome what had happened to it.  Fortunately the mouth was a part of this piece--the mouth and the left  eye--so it was able to tell me that a fierce dragon was the cause. It  had attacked the poor nome and scattered him in every direction, and as  there was no friend near to collect his pieces and put him together,  they had been separated for a great many years. So you see, Your  Majesty, it is not in good taste to sneer at a dragon.\"    The King had listened attentively to Kaliko. Said he:    \"It will only be necessary to chain this dragon which Tititi-Hoochoo  has sent here, in order to prevent his reaching us with his claws and  teeth.\"    \"He also breathes flames,\" Kaliko reminded him.    \"My nomes are not afraid of fire, nor am I,\" said Ruggedo.    \"Well, how about the Army of Oogaboo?\"    \"Sixteen cowardly officers and Tik-Tok! Why, I could defeat them  single-handed; but I won't try to. I'll summon my army of nomes to  drive the invaders out of my territory, and if we catch any of them I  intend to stick needles into them until they hop with pain.\"    \"I hope you won't hurt any of the girls,\" said Kaliko.    \"I'll hurt 'em all!\" roared the angry Metal Monarch. \"And that braying  Mule I'll make into hoof-soup, and feed it to my nomes, that it may add  to their strength.\"    \"Why not be good to the strangers and release your prisoner, the Shaggy  Man's brother?\" suggested Kaliko.    \"Never!\"    \"It may save you a lot of annoyance. And you don't want the Ugly One.\"    \"I don't want him; that's true. But I won't allow anybody to order me  around. I'm King of the Nomes and I'm the Metal Monarch, and I shall do  as I please and what I please and when I please!\"    With this speech Ruggedo threw his sceptre at Kaliko's head, aiming it  so well that the Royal Chamberlain had to fall flat upon the floor in  order to escape it. But the Hearer did not see the sceptre coming and  it swept past his head so closely that it broke off the tip of one of  his long ears. He gave a dreadful yell that quite startled Ruggedo, and  the King was sorry for the accident because those long ears of the  Hearer were really valuable to him.    So the Nome King forgot to be angry with Kaliko and ordered his  Chamberlain to summon General Guph and the army of nomes and have them  properly armed. They were then to march to the mouth of the Tube, where  they could seize the travelers as soon as they appeared.          Chapter Fifteen    The Dragon Defies Danger      Although the journey through the Tube was longer, this time, than  before, it was so much more comfortable that none of our friends minded  it at all. They talked together most of the time and as they found the  dragon good-natured and fond of the sound of his own voice they soon  became well acquainted with him and accepted him as a companion.    \"You see,\" said Shaggy, in his frank way, \"Quox is on our side, and  therefore the dragon is a good fellow. If he happened to be an enemy,  instead of a friend, I am sure I should dislike him very much, for his  breath smells of brimstone, he is very conceited and he is so strong  and fierce that he would prove a dangerous foe.\"    \"Yes, indeed,\" returned Quox, who had listened to this speech with  pleasure; \"I suppose I am about as terrible as any living thing. I am  glad you find me conceited, for that proves I know my good qualities.  As for my breath smelling of brimstone, I really can't help it, and I  once met a man whose breath smelled of onions, which I consider far  worse.\"    \"I don't,\" said Betsy; \"I love onions.    \"And I love brimstone,\" declared the dragon, \"so don't let us quarrel  over one another's peculiarities.\"    Saying this, he breathed a long breath and shot a flame fifty feet from  his mouth. The brimstone made Betsy cough, but she remembered about the  onions and said nothing.    They had no idea how far they had gone through the center of the earth,  nor when to expect the trip to end. At one time the little girl  remarked:    \"I wonder when we'll reach the bottom of this hole. And isn't it funny,  Shaggy Man, that what is the bottom to us now, was the top when we fell  the other way?\"    \"What puzzles me,\" said Files, \"is that we are able to fall both ways.\"    \"That,\" announced Tik-Tok, \"is be-cause the world is round.\"    \"Exactly,\" responded Shaggy. \"The machinery in your head is in fine  working order, Tik-Tok. You know, Betsy, that there is such a thing as  the Attraction of Gravitation, which draws everything toward the center  of the earth. That is why we fall out of bed, and why everything clings  to the surface of the earth.\"    \"Then why doesn't everything go on down to the center of the earth?\"  inquired the little girl.    \"I was afraid you were going to ask me that,\" replied Shaggy in a sad  tone. \"The reason, my dear, is that the earth is so solid that other  solid things can't get through it. But when there's a hole, as there is  in this case, we drop right down to the center of the world.\"    \"Why don't we stop there?\" asked Betsy.    \"Because we go so fast that we acquire speed enough to carry us right  up to the other end.\"    \"I don't understand that, and it makes my head ache to try to figure it  out,\" she said after some thought. \"One thing draws us to the center  and another thing pushes us away from it. But--\"    \"Don't ask me why, please,\" interrupted the Shaggy Man. \"If you can't  understand it, let it go at that.\"    \"Do _you_ understand it?\" she inquired.    \"All the magic isn't in fairyland,\" he said gravely. \"There's lots of  magic in all Nature, and you may see it as well in the United States,  where you and I once lived, as you can here.\"    \"I never did,\" she replied.    \"Because you were so used to it all that you didn't realize it was  magic. Is anything more wonderful than to see a flower grow and  blossom, or to get light out of the electricity in the air? The cows  that manufacture milk for us must have machinery fully as remarkable as  that in Tik-Tok's copper body, and perhaps you've noticed that--\"    And then, before Shaggy could finish his speech, the strong light of  day suddenly broke upon them, grew brighter, and completely enveloped  them. The dragon's claws no longer scraped against the metal Tube, for  he shot into the open air a hundred feet or more and sailed so far away  from the slanting hole that when he landed it was on the peak of a  mountain and just over the entrance to the many underground caverns of  the Nome King.    Some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/957"],[0,"The Scarecrow of Oz (#16)"],[1,"to serve the Royal Sorceress.    Among the many wonderful things in Glinda's palace is the Great Book of  Records. In this book is inscribed everything that takes place in all  the world, just the instant it happens; so that by referring to its  pages Glinda knows what is taking place far and near, in every country  that exists. In this way she learns when and where she can help any in  distress or danger, and although her duties are confined to assisting  those who inhabit the Land of Oz, she is always interested in what  takes place in the unprotected outside world.    So it was that on a certain evening Glinda sat in her library,  surrounded by a bevy of her maids, who were engaged in spinning,  weaving and embroidery, when an attendant announced the arrival at the  palace of the Scarecrow.    This personage was one of the most famous and popular in all the Land  of Oz. His body was merely a suit of Munchkin clothes stuffed with  straw, but his head was a round sack filled with bran, with which the  Wizard of Oz had mixed some magic brains of a very superior sort. The  eyes, nose and mouth of the Scarecrow were painted upon the front of  the sack, as were his ears, and since this quaint being had been  endowed with life, the expression of his face was very interesting, if  somewhat comical.    The Scarecrow was good all through, even to his brains, and while he  was naturally awkward in his movements and lacked the neat symmetry of  other people, his disposition was so kind and considerate and he was so  obliging and honest, that all who knew him loved him, and there were  few people in Oz who had not met our Scarecrow and made his  acquaintance. He lived part of the time in Ozma's palace at the Emerald  City, part of the time in his own corncob castle in the Winkie Country,  and part of the time he traveled over all Oz, visiting with the people  and playing with the children, whom he dearly loved.    It was on one of his wandering journeys that the Scarecrow had arrived  at Glinda's palace, and the Sorceress at once made him welcome. As he  sat beside her, talking of his adventures, he asked:    \"What's new in the way of news?\"    Glinda opened her Great Book of Records and read some of the last pages.    \"Here is an item quite curious and interesting,\" she announced, an  accent of surprise in her voice. \"Three people from the big Outside  World have arrived in Jinxland.\"    \"Where is Jinxland?\" inquired the Scarecrow.    \"Very near here, a little to the east of us,\" she said. \"In fact,  Jinxland is a little slice taken off the Quadling Country, but  separated from it by a range of high mountains, at the foot of which  lies a wide, deep gulf that is supposed to be impassable.\"    \"Then Jinxland is really a part of the Land of Oz,\" said he.    \"Yes,\" returned Glinda, \"but Oz people know nothing of it, except what  is recorded here in my book.\"    \"What does the Book say about it?\" asked the Scarecrow.    \"It is ruled by a wicked man called King Krewl, although he has no  right to the title. Most of the people are good, but they are very  timid and live in constant fear of their fierce ruler. There are also  several Wicked Witches who keep the inhabitants of Jinxland in a state  of terror.\"    \"Do those witches have any magical powers?\" inquired the Scarecrow.    \"Yes, they seem to understand witchcraft in its most evil form, for one  of them has just transformed a respectable and honest old sailor--one  of the strangers who arrived there--into a grasshopper. This same  witch, Blinkie by name, is also planning to freeze the heart of a  beautiful Jinxland girl named Princess Gloria.\"    \"Why, that's a dreadful thing to do!\" exclaimed the Scarecrow.    Glinda's face was very grave. She read in her book how Trot and  Button-Bright were turned out of the King's castle, and how they found  refuge in the hut of Pon, the gardener's boy.    \"I'm afraid those helpless earth people will endure much suffering in  Jinxland, even if the wicked King and the witches permit them to live,\"  said the good Sorceress, thoughtfully. \"I wish I might help them.\"    \"Can I do anything?\" asked the Scarecrow, anxiously. \"If so, tell me  what to do, and I'll do it.\"    For a few moments Glinda did not reply, but sat musing over the  records. Then she said: \"I am going to send you to Jinxland, to protect  Trot and Button-Bright and Cap'n Bill.\"    \"All right,\" answered the Scarecrow in a cheerful voice. \"I know  Button-Bright already, for he has been in the Land of Oz before. You  remember he went away from the Land of Oz in one of our Wizard's big  bubbles.\"    \"Yes,\" said Glinda, \"I remember that.\" Then she carefully instructed  the Scarecrow what to do and gave him certain magical things which he  placed in the pockets of his ragged Munchkin coat.    \"As you have no need to sleep,\" said she, \"you may as well start at  once.\"    \"The night is the same as day to me,\" he replied, \"except that I cannot  see my way so well in the dark.\"    \"I will furnish a light to guide you,\" promised the Sorceress.    So the Scarecrow bade her good-bye and at once started on his journey.  By morning he had reached the mountains that separated the Quadling  Country from Jinxland. The sides of these mountains were too steep to  climb, but the Scarecrow took a small rope from his pocket and tossed  one end upward, into the air. The rope unwound itself for hundreds of  feet, until it caught upon a peak of rock at the very top of a  mountain, for it was a magic rope furnished him by Glinda. The  Scarecrow climbed the rope and, after pulling it up, let it down on the  other side of the mountain range. When he descended the rope on this  side he found himself in Jinxland, but at his feet yawned the Great  Gulf, which must be crossed before he could proceed any farther.    The Scarecrow knelt down and examined the ground carefully, and in a  moment he discovered a fuzzy brown spider that had rolled itself into a  ball. So he took two tiny pills from his pocket and laid them beside  the spider, which unrolled itself and quickly ate up the pills. Then  the Scarecrow said in a voice of command:    \"Spin!\" and the spider obeyed instantly.    In a few moments the little creature had spun two slender but strong  strands that reached way across the gulf, one being five or six feet  above the other. When these were completed the Scarecrow started across  the tiny bridge, walking upon one strand as a person walks upon a rope,  and holding to the upper strand with his hands to prevent him from  losing his balance and toppling over into the gulf. The tiny threads  held him safely, thanks to the strength given them by the magic pills.    Presently he was safe across and standing on the plains of Jinxland.  Far away he could see the towers of the King's castle and toward this  he at once began to walk.          Chapter Fourteen    The Frozen Heart      In the hut of Pon, the gardener's boy, Button-Bright was the first to  waken in the morning. Leaving his companions still asleep, he went out  into the fresh morning air and saw some blackberries growing on bushes  in a field not far away. Going to the bushes he found the berries ripe  and sweet, so he began eating them. More bushes were scattered over the  fields, so the boy wandered on, from bush to bush, without paying any  heed to where he was wandering. Then a butterfly fluttered by. He gave  chase to it and followed it a long way. When finally he paused to look  around him, Button-Bright could see no sign of Pon's house, nor had he  the slightest idea in which direction it lay.    \"Well, I'm lost again,\" he remarked to himself. \"But never mind; I've  been lost lots of times. Someone is sure to find me.\"    Trot was a little worried about Button-Bright when she awoke and found  him gone. Knowing how careless he was, she believed that he had strayed  away, but felt that he would come back in time, because he had a habit  of not staying lost. Pon got the little girl some food for her  breakfast and then together they went out of the hut and stood in the  sunshine.    Pon's house was some distance off the road, but they could see it from  where they stood and both gave a start of surprise when they discovered  two soldiers walking along the roadway and escorting Princess Gloria  between them. The poor girl had her hands bound together, to prevent  her from struggling, and the soldiers rudely dragged her forward when  her steps seemed to lag.    Behind this group came King Krewl, wearing his jeweled crown and  swinging in his hand a slender golden staff with a ball of clustered  gems at one end.    \"Where are they going?\" asked Trot. \"To the house of the Wicked Witch,  I fear,\" Pon replied. \"Come, let us follow them, for I am sure they  intend to harm my dear Gloria.\"    \"Won't they see us?\" she asked timidly.    \"We won't let them. I know a short cut through the trees to Blinkie's  house,\" said he.    So they hurried away through the trees and reached the house of the  witch ahead of the King and his soldiers. Hiding themselves in the  shrubbery, they watched the approach of poor Gloria and her escort, all  of whom passed so near to them that Pon could have put out a hand and  touched his sweetheart, had he dared to.    Blinkie's house had eight sides, with a door and a window in each side.  Smoke was coming out of the chimney and as the guards brought Gloria to  one of the doors it was opened by the old witch in person. She chuckled  with evil glee and rubbed her skinny hands together to show the delight  with which she greeted her victim, for Blinkie was pleased to be able  to perform her wicked rites on one so fair and sweet as the Princess.    Gloria struggled to resist when they bade her enter the house, so the  soldiers forced her through the doorway and even the King gave her a  shove as he followed close behind. Pon was so incensed at the cruelty  shown Gloria that he forgot all caution and rushed"]]]
