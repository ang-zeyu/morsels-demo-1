[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10065"],[0,"The Constitution of the United States (#17)"],[1,"present  revolt against the spirit of authority. Too little consideration has  been paid by the legal profession to questions of moral psychology.  These have been left to metaphysicians and ecclesiastics, and yet--to  paraphrase the saying of the Master--\"the laws were made for man and not  man for the laws,\" and if the science of the law ignores the study of  human nature and attempts to conform man to the laws, rather than the  laws to man, then its development is a very partial and imperfect one.    Let me first be sure of my premises. Is there in this day and  generation a spirit of lawlessness greater or different than that that  has always characterized human society? Such spirit of revolt against  authority has always existed, even when the penalty of death was visited  upon nearly all offences against life and property. Blackstone tells us  (Book IV, Chap. I) that in the eighteenth century it was a capital  offence to cut down a cherry tree in an orchard--a drastic penalty which  should increase our admiration for George Washington's courage and  veracity.    We are apt to see the past in a golden haze, which obscures our vision.  Thus, we think of William Penn's \"holy experiment\" on the banks of the  Delaware as the realization of Sir Thomas More's dream of Utopia; and  yet Pennsylvania was somewhat intemperately called in 1698 \"the greatest  refuge for pirates and rogues in America,\" and Penn himself wrote, about  that time, that he had heard of no place which was \"more overrun with  wickedness\" than his City of Brotherly Love, where things were so  \"openly committed in defiance of law and virtue--facts so foul that I am  forbid by common modesty to relate them.\"    Conceding that lawlessness is not a novel phenomenon, is not the present  time characterized by an exceptional revolt against the authority of  law? The statistics of our criminal courts show in recent years an  unprecedented growth in crimes. Thus, in the federal courts, pending  criminal indictments have increased from 9503 in the year 1912 to over  70,000 in the year 1921. While this abnormal increase is, in part, due  to sumptuary legislation--for approximately 30,000 cases now pending  arise under the prohibition statutes--yet, eliminating these, there yet  remains an increase in nine years of over 400 per cent, in the  comparatively narrow sphere of the federal criminal jurisdiction. I have  been unable to get the data from the State Courts; but the growth of  crimes can be measured by a few illustrative statistics. Thus, the  losses from burglaries which have been repaid by casualty companies have  grown in amount from $886,000 in 1914 to over $10,000,000 in 1920; and,  in a like period, embezzlements have increased five-fold. It is  notorious that the thefts from the mails and express companies and other  carriers have grown to enormous proportions. The hold-up of railroad  trains is now of frequent occurrence, and is not confined to the  unsettled sections of the country. Not only in the United States, but  even in Europe, such crimes of violence are of increasing frequency, and  a recent dispatch from Berne, under date of August 7, 1921, stated that  the famous International Expresses of Europe were now run under a  military guard.    The streets of our cities, once reasonably secure from crimes of  violence, have now become the field of operations for the foot-pad and  highwayman. The days of Dick Turpin and Jack Sheppard have returned,  with this serious difference--that the Turpins and Sheppards of our day  are not dependent upon the horse, but have the powerful automobile to  facilitate their crimes and make sure their escape.    Thus in Chicago alone, 5000 automobiles were stolen in a single year.  Once murder was an infrequent and abnormal crime. To-day in our large  cities it is of almost daily occurrence. In New York, in 1917, there  were 236 murders and only 67 convictions; in 1918, 221, and 77  convictions. In Chicago, in 1919, there were 336, and 44 convictions.    When the crime wave was at its height a year ago, the police authorities  in more than one American city confessed their impotence to impose  effective restraints. Life and property had seemingly become almost as  insecure as during the Middle Ages.[3]    [Footnote 3: The reader will bear in mind that these words were spoken  in August 1921. Unquestionably, the situation has greatly improved  during the present year(1922).]    As to the subtler and more insidious crimes against the political  state, it is enough to say that graft has become a science in city,  state and nation. Losses by such misapplication of public funds--piled  Pelion on Ossa--no longer run in the millions but the hundreds of  millions. Our city governments are, in many instances, foul cancers on  the body politic; and for us to boast of having solved the problem of  local self-government is as fatuous as for a strong man to exult in his  health when his body is covered with running sores. It has been  estimated that the annual profits from violations of the prohibition  laws have reached $300,000,000. Men who thus violate these laws for  sordid gain are not likely to obey other laws, and the respect for law  among all classes steadily diminishes as our people become familiar  with, and tolerant to, wholesale criminality. Whether the moral and  economic results of Prohibition overbalance this rising wave of crime,  time will tell.    _In limine_, let us note the significant fact that this spirit of  revolt against authority is not confined to the political state, and  therefore its causes lie beyond that sphere of human action.    Human life is governed by all manner of man-made laws--laws of art, of  social intercourse, of literature, music, business--all evolved by  custom and imposed by the collective will of society. Here we find the  same revolt against tradition and authority.    In music, its fundamental canons have been thrown aside and discord has  been substituted for harmony as its ideal. Its culmination--jazz--is a  musical crime. If the forms of dancing and music are symptomatic of an  age, what shall be said of the universal craze to indulge in crude and  clumsy dancing to the vile discords of so-called \"jazz\" music? The cry  of the time is:        \"On with the dance, let joy be\" unrefined.    In the plastic arts, the laws of form and the criteria of beauty have  been swept aside by the futurists, cubists, vorticists, tactilists, and  other aesthetic Bolsheviki.    In poetry, where beauty of rhythm, melody of sound and nobility of  thought were once regarded as the true tests, we now have in freak forms  of poetry the exaltation of the grotesque and brutal. Hundreds of poets  are feebly echoing the \"barbaric yawp\" of Walt Whitman, without the  redeeming merit of his occasional sublimity of thought.    In commerce, the revolt is against the purity of standards and the  integrity of business morals. Who can question that this is  pre-eminently the age of the sham and the counterfeit? Science is  prostituted to deceive the public by cloaking the increasing  deterioration in quality of merchandise. The blatant medium of  advertising has become so mendacious as to defeat its own purpose.    In the recent deflation in commodity values, there was widespread  \"welching\" among business men who had theretofore been classed as  reputable. Of course, I recognize that a far greater number kept their  contracts, even when it brought them to the verge of ruin. But when in  the history of American business was there such a volume of broken faith  as in the drastic deflation of 1920?    In the greater sphere of social life, we find the same revolt against  the institutions which have the sanction of the past. Social laws, which  mark the decent restraints of print, speech and dress, have in recent  decades been increasingly disregarded. The very foundations of the great  and primitive institutions of mankind--like the family, the Church, and  the State--have been shaken. Nature itself is defied. Thus, the  fundamental difference of sex is disregarded by social and political  movements which ignore the permanent differentiation of social function  ordained by Nature.    All these are but illustrations of the general revolt against the  authority of the past--a revolt that can be measured by the change in  the fundamental presumption of men with respect to the value of human  experience. In all former ages, all that was in the past was  presumptively true, and the burden was upon him who sought to change it.  To-day, the human mind apparently regards the lessons of the past as  presumptively false--and the burden is upon him who seeks to invoke  them.    Lest I be accused of undue pessimism, let me cite as a witness one who,  of all men, is probably best equipped to express an opinion upon the  moral state of the world. I refer to the venerable head of that  religious organization[4] which, with its trained representatives in  every part of the world, is probably better informed as to its spiritual  state than any other organization.    [Footnote 4: Reference is to the late Pope Benedict.]    Speaking last Christmas Eve, in an address to the College of Cardinals,  the venerable Pontiff gave expression to an estimate of present  conditions which should have attracted far greater attention than it  apparently did.    The Pope said that five plagues were now afflicting humanity.    The first was the unprecedented challenge to authority.    The second, an equally unprecedented hatred between man and man.    The third was the abnormal aversion to work.    The fourth, the excessive thirst for pleasure as the great aim of life.    The fifth, a gross materialism which denied the reality of the spiritual  in human life.    The accuracy of this indictment will commend itself to men who like  myself are not of Pope Benedict's communion.    I trust that I have already shown that the challenge to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10066"],[0,"Gunman's Reckoning (#17)"],[1," so pretentious an affair as the bar  in Lebrun's, but it was of a far higher class. Milligan had even managed  to bring in a few bottles of wine, and he had dispensed cheap claret at  two dollars a glass when the miners wished to celebrate a rare occasion.  There were complaints, not of the taste, but of the lack of strength. So  Milligan fortified his liquor with pure alcohol and after that the  claret went like a sweet song in The Corner. Among other things, he sold  mint juleps; and it was the memory of the big sign proclaiming this fact  that furnished Donnegan with his idea.    He had George Washington Green put on his town clothes--a riding suit in  which Godwin had had him dress for the sake of formal occasions.  Resplendent in black boots, yellow riding breeches, and blue silk shirt,  the big man came before Donnegan for instructions.    \"Go down to Milligan's,\" said the master. \"They don't allow colored  people to enter the door, but you go to the door and start for the bar.  They won't let you go very far. When they stop you, tell them you come  from Donnegan and that you have to get me some mint for a julep.  Insist. The bouncer will start to throw you out.\"    George showed his teeth.    \"No fighting back. Don't lift your hand. When you find that you can't  get in, come back here. Now, ride.\"    So George mounted the horse and went. Straight to Milligan's he rode and  dismounted; and half of The Corner's scant daytime population came into  the street to see the brilliant horseman pass.    Scar-faced Lewis met the big man at the door. And size meant little to  Andy, except an easier target.    \"Well, confound my soul,\" said Lewis, blocking the way. \"A Negro in  Milligan's? Get out!\"    Big George did not move.    \"I been sent, mister,\" he said mildly. \"I been sent for enough mint to  make a julep.\"    \"You been sent to the wrong place,\" declared Andy, hitching at his  cartridge belt. \"Ain't you seen that sign?\"    And he pointed to the one which eliminated colored patrons.    \"Signs don't mean nothin' to my boss,\" said George.    \"Who's he?\"    \"Donnegan.\"    \"And who's Donnegan?\"    It puzzled George. He scratched his head in bewilderment seeking for an  explanation. \"Donnegan is--Donnegan,\" he explained.    \"I heard Gloster talk about him,\" offered someone in the rapidly growing  group. \"He's the gent that rented the two places on the hill.\"    \"Tell him to come himse'f,\" said Andy Lewis. \"We don't play no favorites  at Milligan's.\"    \"Mister,\" said big George, \"I don't want to bring no trouble on this  heah place, but--don't make me go back and bring Donnegan.\"    Even Andy Lewis was staggered by this assurance.    \"Rules is rules,\" he finally decided. \"And out you go.\"    Big George stepped from the doorway and mounted his horse.    \"I call on all you gen'lemen,\" he said to the assembled group, \"to say  that I done tried my best to do this peaceable. It ain't me that's sent  for Donnegan; it's him!\"    He rode away, leaving Scar-faced Lewis biting his long mustaches in  anxiety. He was not exactly afraid, but he waited in the suspense which  comes before a battle. Moreover, an audience was gathering. The word  went about as only a rumor of mischief can travel. New men had gathered.  The few day gamblers tumbled out of Lebrun's across the street to watch  the fun. The storekeepers were in their doors. Lebrun himself, withered  and dark and yellow of eye, came to watch. And here and there through  the crowd there was a spot of color where the women of the town  appeared. And among others, Nelly Lebrun with Jack Landis beside her. On  the whole it was not a large crowd, but what it lacked in size it made  up in intense interest.    For though The Corner had had its share of troubles of fist and gun,  most of them were entirely impromptu affairs. Here was a fight in the  offing for which the stage was set, the actors set in full view of a  conveniently posted audience, and all the suspense of a curtain rising.  The waiting bore in upon Andy Lewis. Without a doubt he intended to kill  his man neatly and with dispatch, but the possibility of missing before  such a crowd as this sent a chill up and down his spine. If he failed  now his name would be a sign for laughter ever after in The Corner.    A hum passed down the street; it rose to a chuckle, and then fell away  to sudden silence, for Donnegan was coming.    He came on a prancing chestnut horse which sidled uneasily on a weaving  course, as though it wished to show off for the benefit of the rider and  the crowd at once. It was a hot afternoon and Donnegan's linen riding  suit shone an immaculate white. He came straight down the street, as  unaware of the audience which awaited him as though he rode in a park  where crowds were the common thing. Behind him came George Green, just a  careful length back. Rumor went before the two with a whisper on either  side.    \"That's Donnegan. There he comes!\"    \"Who's Donnegan?\"    \"Gloster's man. The one who bluffed out Gloster and three others.\"    \"He pulled his shooting iron and trimmed the whiskers of one of 'em with  a chunk of lead.\"    \"D'you mean that?\"    \"What's that kind of a gent doing in The Corner?\"    \"Come to buy, I guess. He looks like money.\"    \"Looks like a confounded dude.\"    \"We'll see his hand in a minute.\"    Donnegan was now opposite the dance hall, and Andy Lewis had his hand  touching the butt of his gun, but though Donnegan was looking straight  at him, he kept his reins in one hand and his heavy riding crop in the  other. And without a move toward his own gun, he rode straight up to the  door of the dance hall, with Andy in front of it. George drew rein  behind him and turned upon the crowd one broad, superior grin.    As who should say: \"I promised you lightning; now watch it strike!\"    If the crowd had been expectant before, it was now reduced to wire-drawn  tenseness.    \"Are you the fellow who turned back my man?\" asked Donnegan.    His quiet voice fell coldly upon the soul of Andy. He strove to warm  himself by an outbreak of temper.    \"They ain't any poor fool dude can call me a fellow!\" he shouted.    The crowd blinked; but when it opened its eyes the gunplay had not  occurred. The hand of Andy was relaxing from the butt of his gun and an  expression of astonishment and contempt was growing upon his face.    \"I haven't come to curse you,\" said the rider, still occupying his hands  with crop and reins. \"I've come to ask you a question and get an answer.  Are you the fellow who turned back my man?\"    \"I guess you ain't the kind I was expectin' to call on me,\" drawled  Andy, his fear gone, and he winked at the crowd. But the others were not  yet ready to laugh. Something about the calm face of Donnegan had  impressed them. \"Sure, I'm the one that kicked him out. He ain't allowed  in there.\"    \"It's the last of my thoughts to break in upon a convention in your  city,\" replied the grave rider, \"but my man was sent on an errand and  therefore he had a right to expect courtesy. George, get off your horse  and go into Milligan's place. I want that mint!\"    For a moment Andy was too stunned to answer. Then his voice came harshly  and he swayed from side to side, gathering and summoning his wrath.    \"Keep out boy! Keep out, or you're buzzard meat. I'm warnin'--\"    For the first time his glance left the rider to find George, and that  instant was fatal. The hand of Donnegan licked out as the snake's tongue  darts--the loaded quirt slipped over in his hand, and holding it by the  lash he brought the butt of it thudding on the head of Andy.    Even then the instinct to fight remained in the stunned man; while he  fell, he was drawing the revolver; he lay in a crumpling heap at the  feet of Donnegan's horse with the revolver shoved muzzle first into the  sand.    Donnegan's voice did not rise.    \"Go in and get that mint, George,\" he ordered. \"And hurry. This rascal  has kept me waiting until I'm thirsty.\"    Big George hesitated only one instant--it was to sweep the crowd for the  second time with his confident grin--and he strode through the door of  the dance hall. As for Donnegan, his only movement was to swing his  horse around and shift riding crop and reins into the grip of his left  hand. His other hand was dropped carelessly upon his hip. Now, both  these things were very simple maneuvers, but The Corner noted that his  change of face had enabled Donnegan to bring the crowd under his eye,  and that his right hand was now ready for a more serious bit of work if  need be. Moreover, he was probing faces with his glance. And every armed  man in that group felt that the eye of the rider was directed  particularly toward him.    There had been one brief murmur; then the silence lay heavily again, for  it was seen that Andy had been only slightly stunned--knocked out, as a  boxer might be. Now his sturdy brains were clearing. His body stiffened  into a human semblance once more; he fumbled, found the butt of his gun  with his first move. He pushed his hat straight: and so doing he raked  the welt which the blow had left on his head. The pain finished clearing  the mist from his mind; in an instant he was on his feet, maddened with  shame. He saw the semicircle of white faces, and the whole episode  flashed back on him. He had been knocked down like a dog.    For a moment he looked into the blank faces of the crowd; someone noted  that there was no gun strapped at the side of Donnegan. A voice shouted  a warning.    \"Stop, Lewis. The dude ain't got a gun. It's murder!\"    It was now that Lewis saw Donnegan sitting the saddle directly behind  him, and he whirled with a moan of fury. It was a twist of his body--in  his eagerness--rather than a turning upon his feet. And he was half  around before the rider moved. Then he conjured a gun from somewhere in  his clothes. There was the flash of the steel, an explosion, and  Scar-faced Lewis was on his knees with a scream of pain "]]]
