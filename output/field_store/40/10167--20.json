The Americans then retired to Valley  Forge--a strong place in the hills not far from Philadelphia.

To show condition of wood-engraving in the  Revolutionary era.]    [Sidenote: Baron Steuben.]    148. The Army at Valley Forge, 1777-78.--The sufferings of the  soldiers during the following winter can never be overstated. They  seldom had more than half enough to eat. Their clothes were in rags.  Many of them had no blankets. Many more had no shoes. Washington did all  he could do for them. But Congress had no money and could not get any.  At Valley Forge the soldiers were drilled by Baron Steuben, a Prussian  veteran. The army took the field in 1778, weak in numbers and poorly  clad. But what soldiers there were were as good as any soldiers to be  found anywhere in the world. During that winter, also, an attempt was  made to dismiss Washington from chief command, and to give his place to  General Gates. But this attempt ended in failure.

Burgoyne's March to Saratoga, 1777.--While Howe was marching  to Philadelphia, General Burgoyne was marching southward from Canada.  It had been intended that Burgoyne and Howe should seize the line of the  Hudson and cut New England off from the other states. But the orders  reached Howe too late, and he went southward to Philadelphia. Burgoyne,  on his part, was fairly successful at first, for the Americans abandoned  post after post. But when he reached the southern end of Lake Champlain,  and started on his march to the Hudson, his troubles began. The way ran  through a wilderness. General Schuyler had had trees cut down across its  woodland paths and had done his work so well that it took Burgoyne about  a day to march a mile and a half. This gave the Americans time to gather  from all quarters and bar his southward way. But many of the soldiers  had no faith in Schuyler and Congress gave the command to General  Horatio Gates.    [Sidenote: Battle of Bennington, 1777. _Hero Tales_, 59-67.]    150. Bennington, 1777.--Burgoyne had with him many cavalrymen. But  they had no horses. The army, too, was sadly in need of food. So  Burgoyne sent a force of dismounted dragoons to Bennington in southern  Vermont to seize horses and food. It happened, however, that General  Stark, with soldiers from New Hampshire, Vermont, and western  Massachusetts, was nearer Bennington than Burgoyne supposed. They killed  or captured all the British soldiers. They then drove back with great  loss a second party which Burgoyne had sent to support the first one.    [Sidenote: Battle of Oriskany, 1777.]    151. Oriskany, 1777.--Meantime St. Leger, with a large body of  Indians and Canadian frontiersmen, was marching to join Burgoyne by the  way of Lake Ontario and the Mohawk Valley. Near the site of the present  city of Rome in New York was Fort Schuyler, garrisoned by an American  force. St. Leger stopped to besiege this fort. The settlers on the  Mohawk marched to relieve the garrison and St. Leger defeated them at  Oriskany. But his Indians now grew tired of the siege, especially when  they heard that Arnold with a strong army was coming. St. Leger marched  back to Canada and left Burgoyne to his fate.

Saratoga, 1777.--Marching southward, on the western side of  the Hudson, Burgoyne and his army came upon the Americans in a forest  clearing called Freeman's Farm. Led by Daniel Morgan and Benedict  Arnold the Americans fought so hard that Burgoyne stopped where he was  and fortified the position. This was on September 19. The American army  posted itself near by on Bemis' Heights. For weeks the two armies faced  each other. Then, on October 7, the Americans attacked. Again Arnold led  his men to victory. They captured a fort in the centre of the British  line, and Burgoyne was obliged to retreat. But when he reached the  crossing place of the Hudson, to his dismay he found a strong body of  New Englanders with artillery on the opposite bank. Gates had followed  the retiring British, and soon Burgoyne was practically surrounded. His  men were starving, and on October 17 he surrendered.    [Sidenote: The Treaty of Alliance, 1778.]    153. The French Alliance, 1778.--Burgoyne's defeat made the French  think that the Americans would win their independence. So Dr. Franklin,  who was at Paris, was told that France would recognize the independence  of the United States, would make treaties with the new nation, and give  aid openly. Great Britain at once declared war on France. The French  lent large sums of money to the United States. They sent large armies  and splendid fleets to America. Their aid greatly shortened the struggle  for independence. But the Americans would probably have won without  French aid.    [Sidenote: The British leave Philadelphia 1778.]    [Sidenote: Battle of Monmouth, 1778.]    154. Monmouth, 1778.--The first result of the French alliance was  the retreat of the British from Philadelphia to New York. As Sir Henry  Clinton, the new British commander, led his army across the Jerseys,  Washington determined to strike it a blow. This he did near Monmouth.  The attack was a failure, owing to the treason of General Charles Lee,  who led the advance. Washington reached the front only in time to  prevent a dreadful disaster. But he could not bring about victory, and  Clinton seized the first moment to continue his march to New York. There  were other expeditions and battles in the North. But none of these had  any important effect on the outcome of the war.

Clark's Western Campaign, 1778-79.--The Virginians had long  taken great interest in the western country. Their hardy pioneers had  crossed the mountains and begun the settlement of Kentucky. The  Virginians now determined to conquer the British posts in the country  northwest of the Ohio. The command was given to George Rogers Clark.  Gathering a strong band of hardy frontiersmen he set out on his  dangerous expedition. He seized the posts in Illinois, and Vincennes  surrendered to him. Then the British governor of the Northwest came from  Detroit with a large force and recaptured Vincennes. Clark set out from  Illinois to surprise the British. It was the middle of the winter. In  some places the snow lay deep on the ground. Then came the early floods.  For days the Americans marched in water up to their waists. At night  they sought some little hill where they could sleep on dry ground. Then  on again through the flood. They surprised the British garrison at  Vincennes and forced it to surrender. That was the end of the contest  for the Northwest.

Arnold and Andre, 1780.--Of all the leaders under Washington  none was abler in battle than Benedict Arnold. Unhappily he was always  in trouble about money. He was distrusted by Congress and was not  promoted. At Saratoga he quarrelled with Gates and was dismissed from  his command. Later he became military governor of Philadelphia and was  censured by Washington for his doings there. He then secured the command  of West Point and offered to surrender the post to the British. Major  Andre, of Clinton's staff, met Arnold to arrange the final details. On  his return journey to New York Andre was arrested and taken before  Washington. The American commander asked his generals if Andre was a  spy. They replied that Andre was a spy, and he was hanged. Arnold  escaped to New York and became a general in the British army.          CHAPTER 16    INDEPENDENCE    [Sidenote: Invasion of the South.]    [Sidenote: Capture of Charleston, 1780.]    157. Fall of Charleston, 1780.--It seemed quite certain that  Clinton could not conquer the Northern states with the forces given him.  In the South there were many loyalists. Resistance might not be so stiff  there. At all events Clinton decided to attempt the conquest of the  South. Savannah was easily seized (1778), and the French and Americans  could not retake it (1779). In the spring of 1780, Clinton, with a large  army, landed on the coast between Savannah and Charleston. He marched  overland to Charleston and besieged it from the land side. The Americans  held out for a long time. But they were finally forced to surrender.  Clinton then sailed back to New York, and left to Lord Cornwallis the  further conquest of the Carolinas.    [Sidenote: Battle of Camden, 1780.]    158. Gates's Defeat at Camden, 1780.--Cornwallis had little trouble  in occupying the greater part of South Carolina. There was no one to  oppose him, for the American army had been captured with Charleston.  Another small army was got together in North Carolina and the command  given to Gates, the victor at Saratoga. One night both Gates and  Cornwallis set out to attack the other's camp. The two armies met at  daybreak, the British having the best position. But this really made  little difference, for Gates's Virginia militiamen ran away before the  British came within fighting distance. The North Carolina militia  followed the Virginians. Only the regulars from Maryland and Delaware  were left. They fought on like heroes until their leader, General John  De Kalb, fell with seventeen wounds. Then the survivors surrendered.  Gates himself had been carried far to the rear by the rush of the  fleeing militia.

You should never take a book from the library to your own room without  requesting permission to borrow it. When it is lent, you should take  every care that it sustains no injury while in your possession, and  should cover it, if necessary.    A guest should endeavour to amuse himself as much as possible, and  not be continually dependent on his hosts for entertainment. He should  remember that, however welcome he may be, he is not always wanted.  During the morning hours a gentleman visitor who neither shoots,  reads, writes letters, nor does anything but idle about the house and  chat with the ladies, is an intolerable nuisance. Sooner than become  the latter, he had better retire to the billiard-room and practise  cannons by himself, or pretend an engagement and walk about the  neighbourhood.    Those who receive \"staying visitors,\" as they are called, should  remember that the truest hospitality is that which places the visitor  most at his ease, and affords him the greatest opportunity for  enjoyment. They should also remember that different persons have  different ideas on the subject of enjoyment, and that the surest way  of making a guest happy is to find out what gives him pleasure; not to  impose that upon him which is pleasure to themselves.    A visitor should avoid giving unnecessary trouble to the servants of  the house, and should be liberal to them when he leaves.    The signal for retiring to rest is generally given by the appearance  of the servant with wine, water, and biscuits, where a late  dinner-hour is observed and suppers are not the custom. This is the  last refreshment of the evening, and the visitor will do well to  rise and wish good-night shortly after it has been partaken of by the  family.           *       *       *       *       *    XIII.--GENERAL HINTS.      In entering a morning exhibition, or public room, where ladies are  present, the gentleman should lift his hat.    In going upstairs the gentleman should precede the lady; in going  down, he should follow her.    If you accompany ladies to a theatre or concert-room, precede them to  clear the way and secure their seats.    Do not frequently repeat the name of the person with whom you are  conversing. It implies either the extreme of _hauteur_ or familiarity.  We have already cautioned you against the repetition of titles.  Deference can always be better expressed in the voice, manner, and  countenance than in any forms of words.    If when you are walking with a lady in any crowded thoroughfare you  are obliged to proceed singly, always precede her.    Always give the lady the wall; by doing so you interpose your own  person between her and the passers by, and assign her the cleanest  part of the pavement.    At public balls, theatres, &c., a gentleman should never permit the  lady to pay for refreshments, vehicles, and so forth. If she insists  on repaying him afterwards, he must of course defer to her wishes.    Never speak of absent persons by only their Christian or surnames; but  always as Mr. ---- or Mrs. ----. Above all, never name anybody by the  first letter of his name. Married people are sometimes guilty of this  flagrant offence against taste.    If you are smoking and meet a lady to whom you wish to speak,  immediately throw away your cigar.    Do not smoke shortly before entering the presence of ladies.    A young man who visits frequently at the house of a married friend may  be permitted to show his sense of the kindness which he receives by  the gift of a Christmas or New Year's volume to the wife or daughter  of his entertainer. The presentation of _Etrennes_ is now carried to  a ruinous and ludicrous height among our French neighbours; but it  should be remembered that, without either ostentation or folly, a  gift ought to be worth offering. It is better to give nothing than  too little. On the other hand, mere costliness does not constitute  the soul of a present; on the contrary, it has the commercial and  unflattering effect of repayment for value received.    A gift should be precious for something better than its price. It may  have been brought by the giver from some far or famous place; it may  be unique in its workmanship; it may be valuable only from association  with some great man or strange event. Autographic papers, foreign  curiosities, and the like, are elegant gifts. An author may offer his  book, or a painter a sketch, with grace and propriety. Offerings of  flowers and game are unexceptionable, and may be made even to those  whose position is superior to that of the giver.    If you present a book to a friend, do not write his or her name in  it, unless requested. You have no right to presume that it will be  rendered any the more valuable for that addition; and you ought not to  conclude beforehand that your gift will be accepted.    Never refuse a present unless under very exceptional circumstances.  However humble the giver, and however poor the gift, you should  appreciate the goodwill and intention, and accept it with kindness and  thanks. Never say \"I fear I rob you,\" or \"I am really ashamed to  take it,\" &c., &c. Such deprecatory phrases imply that you think the  bestower of the gift cannot spare or afford it.    Never undervalue the gift which you are yourself offering; you have no  business to offer it if it is valueless. Neither say that you do not  want it yourself, or that you should throw it away if it were not  accepted. Such apologies would be insults if true, and mean nothing if  false.    No compliment that bears insincerity on the face of it is a compliment  at all.    To yawn in the presence of others, to lounge, to put your feet on  a chair, to stand with your back to the fire, to take the most  comfortable seat in the room, to do anything which shows indifference,  selfishness, or disrespect, is unequivocally vulgar and inadmissible.    If a person of greater age or higher rank than yourself desires you  to step first into a carriage, or through a door, it is more polite to  bow and obey than to decline.    Compliance with, and deference to, the wishes of others is the finest  breeding.    When you cannot agree with the propositions advanced in general  conversation, be silent. If pressed for your opinion, give it with  modesty. Never defend your own views too warmly. When you find others  remain unconvinced, drop the subject, or lead to some other topic.    Look at those who address you.    Never boast of your birth, your money, your grand friends, or  anything that is yours. If you have travelled, do not introduce that  information into your conversation at every opportunity. Any one can  travel with money and leisure. The real distinction is to come home  with enlarged views, improved tastes, and a mind free from prejudice.    Give a foreigner his name in full, as Monsieur de Vigny--never as  _Monsieur_ only. In speaking of him, give him his title, if he has  one. Foreign noblemen are addressed _viva voce_ as Monsieur. In  speaking of a foreign nobleman before his face, say Monsieur le Comte,  or Monsieur le Marquis. In his absence, say Monsieur le Comte de  Vigny.    Converse with a foreigner in his own language. If not competent to do  so, apologize, and beg permission to speak English.          Ball-Room Guide.           *       *       *       *       *    I.--HOW TO ORGANISE A BALL.      As the number of guests at a dinner-party is regulated by the size of  the table, so should the number of invitations to a ball be limited by  the proportions of the ball-room. A prudent hostess will always  invite a few more guests than she really desires to entertain, in the  certainty that there will be some deserters when the appointed evening  comes round; but she will at the same time remember that to overcrowd  her room is to spoil the pleasure of those who love dancing, and  that a party of this kind when, too numerously attended is as great a  failure as one at which too few are present.    A room which is nearly square, yet a little longer than it is broad,  will be found the most favourable for a ball. It admits of two  quadrille parties, or two round dances, at the same time. In a  perfectly square room this arrangement is not so practicable or  pleasant. A very long and narrow room is obviously of the worst shape  for the purpose of dancing, and is fit only for quadrilles and country  dances.    The top of the ball-room is the part nearest the orchestra. In  a private room, the top is where it would be if the room were a  dining-room. It is generally at the farthest point from the door.  Dancers should be careful to ascertain the top of the room before  taking their places, as the top couples always lead the dances.    A good floor is of the last importance in a ball-room. In a private  house, nothing can be better than a smooth, well-stretched holland,  with the carpet beneath.    Abundance of light and free ventilation are indispensable to the  spirits and comfort of the dancers.    Good music is as necessary to the prosperity of a ball as good wine to  the excellence of a dinner. No hostess should tax her friends for  this part of the entertainment. It is the most injudicious economy  imaginable. Ladies who would prefer to dance are tied to the  pianoforte; and as few amateurs have been trained in the art of  playing dance music with that strict attention to time and accent  which is absolutely necessary to the comfort of the dancers, a total  and general discontent is sure to be the result. To play dance music  thoroughly well is a branch of the art which requires considerable  practice. It is as different from every other kind of playing as whale  fishing is from fly fishing. Those who give private balls will do well  ever to bear this in mind, and to provide skilled musicians for the  evening. For a small party, a piano and cornopean"]]]
