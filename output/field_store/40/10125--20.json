The Coptic lives of  saints and martyrs are full of allusions to the sufferings of the  damned, but whether the descriptions of these are due to imaginings of  the mind of the Christian Egyptian or to the bias of the scribe's  opinions cannot always be said. When we consider that the Coptic hell  was little more than a modified form of the ancient Egyptian Amenti, or  Amentet, it is difficult to believe that it was the name of the Egyptian  underworld only which was borrowed, and that the ideas and beliefs  concerning it which were held by the ancient Egyptians were not at the  same time absorbed. Some Christian writers are most minute in their  classification of the wicked in hell, as we may see from the following  extract from the life of Pisentios, [Footnote: Ed. Amelineau, Paris,  1887, p. 144 f.] Bishop of Keft, in the VIIth century of our era. The  holy man had taken refuge in a tomb wherein a number of mummies had been  piled up, and when he had read the list of the names of the people who  had been buried there he gave it to his disciple to replace. Then he  addressed his disciple and admonished him to do the work of God with  diligence, and warned him that every man must become even as were the  mummies which lay before them. \"And some,\" said he, \"whose sins have  been many are now in Amenti, others are in the outer darkness, others  are in pits and ditches filled with fire, and others are in the river of  fire: upon these last no one hath bestowed rest. And others, likewise,  are in a place of rest, by reason of their good works.\" When the  disciple had departed, the holy man began to talk to one of the mummies  who had been a native of the town of Erment, or Armant, and whose father  and mother had been called Agricolaos and Eustathia. He had been a  worshipper of Poseidon, and had never heard that Christ had come into  the world. \"And,\" said he \"woe, woe is me because I was born into the  world. Why did not my mother's womb become my tomb? When, it became  necessary for me to die, the Kosmokrator angels were the first to come  round about me, and they told me of all the sins which I had committed,  and they said unto me, 'Let him that can save thee from the torments  into which thou shalt be cast come hither.' And they had in their hands  iron knives, and pointed goads which were like unto sharp spears, and  they drove them into my sides and gnashed upon me with their teeth. When  a little time afterwards my eyes were opened I saw death hovering about  in the air in its manifold forms, and at that moment angels who were  without pity came and dragged my wretched soul from my body, and having  tied it under the form of a black horse they led me away to Amonti. Woe  be unto every sinner like unto myself who hath been born into the world!  O my master and father, I was then delivered into the hands of a  multitude of tormentors who were without pity and who had each a  different form. Oh, what a number of wild beasts did I see in the way!  Oh, what a number of powers were there that inflicted punishment upon  me! And it came to pass that when I had been cast into the outer  darkness, I saw a great ditch which was more than two hundred cubits  deep, and it was filled with reptiles; each reptile had seven heads, and  the body of each was like unto that of a scorpion. In this place also  lived the Great Worm, the mere sight of which terrified him that looked  thereat. In his mouth he had teeth like unto iron stakes, and one took  me and threw me to this Worm which never ceased to eat; then immediately  all the [other] beasts gathered together near him, and when he had  filled his mouth [with my flesh], all the beasts who were round about me  filled theirs.\" In answer to the question of the holy man as to whether  he had enjoyed any rest or period without suffering, the mummy replied:  \"Yea, O my father, pity is shown unto those who are in torment every  Saturday and every Sunday. As soon as Sunday is over we are cast into  the torments which we deserve, so that we may forget the years which we  have passed in the world; and as soon as we have forgotten the grief of  this torment we are cast into another which is still more grievous.\"    Now, it is easy to see from the above description of the torments which  the wicked were supposed to suffer, that the writer had in his mind some  of the pictures with which we are now familiar, thanks to the excavation  of tombs which has gone on in Egypt during the last few years; and it is  also easy to see that he, in common with many other Coptic writers,  misunderstood the purport of them. The outer darkness, _i.e._, the  blackest place of all in the underworld, the river of fire, the pits of  fire, the snake and the scorpion, and such like things, all have their  counterparts, or rather originals, in the scenes which accompany the  texts which describe the passage of the sun through the underworld  during the hours of the night. Having once misunderstood the general  meaning of such scenes, it was easy to convert the foes of R[=a], the  Sun-god, into the souls of the damned, and to look upon the burning up  of such foes--who were after all only certain powers of nature  personified--as the well-merited punishment of those who had done evil  upon the earth. How far the Copts reproduced unconsciously the views  which had been held by their ancestors for thousands of years cannot be  said, but even after much allowance has been made for this possibility,  there remains still to be explained a large number of beliefs and views  which seem to have been the peculiar product of the Egyptian Christian  imagination.    It has been said above that the idea of the judgment of the dead is of  very great antiquity in Egypt; indeed, it is so old that it is useless  to try to ascertain the date of the period when it first grew up. In the  earliest religious texts known to us, there are indications that the  Egyptians expected a judgment, but they are not sufficiently definite to  argue from; it is certainly doubtful if the judgment was thought to be  as thorough and as searching then as in the later period. As far back as  the reign of Men-kau-R[=a], the Mycerinus of the Greeks, about B.C.  3600, a religious text, which afterwards formed chapter 30B of the Book  of the Dead, was found inscribed on an iron slab; in the handwriting of  the god Thoth, by the royal son or prince Herut[=a]t[=a]f. [Footnote:  See _Chapters of Coming Forth by Day_, Translation, p. 80.] The original  purpose of the composition of this text cannot be said, but there is  little doubt that it was intended, to benefit the deceased in the  judgment, and, if we translate its title literally, it was intended to  prevent his heart from \"falling away from him in the underworld.\" In the  first part of it the deceased, after adjuring his heart, says, \"May  naught stand up to oppose me in the judgment; may there be no opposition  to me in the presence of the sovereign princes; may there be no parting  of thee from me in the presence of him that keepeth the Balance!... May  the officers of the court of Osiris (in Egyptian _Shenit_), who form the  conditions of the lives of men, not cause my name to stink! Let [the  judgment] be satisfactory unto me, let the hearing be satisfactory unto  me, and let me have joy of heart at the weighing of words. Let not that  which is false be uttered against me before the Great God, the Lord of  Amentet.\"    Now, although the papyrus upon, which this statement and prayer are  found was written about two thousand years after Men-kau-R[=a] reigned,  there is no doubt that they were copied from texts which were themselves  copied at a much earlier period, and that the story of the finding of  the text inscribed upon an iron slab is contemporary with its actual  discovery by Herut[=a]t[=a]f. It is not necessary to inquire here  whether the word \"find\" (in Egyptian _qem_) means a genuine discovery or  not, but it is clear that those who had the papyrus copied saw no  absurdity or impropriety in ascribing the text to the period of  Men-kau-R[=a]. Another text, which afterwards also became a chapter of  the Book of the Dead, under the title \"Chapter of not letting the heart  of the deceased be driven away from him in the underworld,\" was  inscribed on a coffin of the XIth dynasty, about B.C. 2500, and in it we  have the following petition: \"May naught stand up to oppose me in  judgment in the presence of the lords of the trial (literally, 'lords of  things'); let it not be said of me and of that which I have done, 'He  hath done deeds against that which is very right and true'; may naught  be against me in the presence of the Great God, the Lord of Amentet.\"  [Footnote: _Chapters of Coming Forth by Day_, p. 78.] From these  passages we are right in assuming that before the end of the IVth  dynasty the idea of being \"weighed in the balance\" was already evolved;  that the religious schools of Egypt had assigned to a god the duty of  watching the balance when cases were being tried; that this weighing in  the balance took place in the presence of the beings called _Shenit_,  who were believed to control the acts and deeds of men; that it was  thought that evidence unfavourable to the deceased might be produced by  his foes at the judgment; that the weighing took place in the presence  of the Great God, the Lord of Amentet; and that the heart of the  deceased might fail him either physically or morally. The deceased  addresses his heart, calling it is \"mother,\" and next identifies it with  his _ka_ or double, coupling the mention of the _ka_ with the name of  the god Khnemu: these facts"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11323"],[0,"Caleb Williams; Or, Things as They Are (#17)"],[1," times!\" she replied, a little mournfully. \"Do you  know, cousin, I wish I could wake, and find that the last month--only  about a month--was a dream?\"    \"What do you mean by that?\" said Mr. Tyrrel with an altered voice. \"Have  a care! Do not put me out of humour. Do not come with your romantic  notions now.\"    \"No, no: I have no romantic notions in my head. I speak of something  upon which the happiness of my life depends.\"    \"I see what you would be at. Be silent. You know it is to no purpose to  plague me with your stubbornness. You will not let me be in good humour  with you for a moment. What my mind is determined upon about Grimes, all  the world shall not move me to give up.\"    \"Dear, dear cousin! why, but consider now. Grimes is a rough rustic  lout, like Orson in the story-book. He wants a wife like himself. He  would be as uneasy and as much at a loss with me, as I with him. Why  should we both of us be forced to do what neither of us is inclined to?  I cannot think what could ever have put it into your head. But now, for  goodness' sake, give it up! Marriage is a serious thing. You should not  think of joining two people for a whim, who are neither of them fit for  one another in any respect in the world. We should feel mortified and  disappointed all our lives. Month would go after month, and year after  year, and I could never hope to be my own, but by the death of a person  I ought to love. I am sure, sir, you cannot mean me all this harm. What  have I done, that I should deserve to have you for an enemy?\"    \"I am not your enemy. I tell you that it is necessary to put you out of  harm's way. But, if I were your enemy, I could not be a worse torment to  you than you are to me. Are not you continually singing the praises of  Falkland? Are not you in love with Falkland? That man is a legion of  devils to me! I might as well have been a beggar! I might as well have  been a dwarf or a monster! Time was when I was thought entitled to  respect. But now, debauched by this Frenchified rascal, they call me  rude, surly, a tyrant! It is true that I cannot talk in finical phrases,  flatter people with hypocritical praise, or suppress the real feelings  of my mind. The scoundrel knows his pitiful advantages, and insults me  upon them without ceasing. He is my rival and my persecutor; and, at  last, as if all this were not enough, he has found means to spread the  pestilence in my own family. You, whom we took up out of charity, the  chance-born brat of a stolen marriage! you must turn upon your  benefactor, and wound me in the point that of all others I could least  bear. If I were your enemy, should not I have reason? Could I ever  inflict upon you such injuries as you have made me suffer? And who are  you? The lives of fifty such cannot atone for an hour of my uneasiness.  If you were to linger for twenty years upon the rack, you would never  feel what I have felt. But I am your friend. I see which way you are  going; and I am determined to save you from this thief, this  hypocritical destroyer of us all. Every moment that the mischief is left  to itself, it does but make bad worse; and I am determined to save you  out of hand.\"    The angry expostulations of Mr. Tyrrel suggested new ideas to the tender  mind of Miss Melville. He had never confessed the emotions of his soul  so explicitly before; but the tempest of his thoughts suffered him to be  no longer master of himself. She saw with astonishment that he was the  irreconcilable foe of Mr. Falkland, whom she had fondly imagined it was  the same thing to know and admire; and that he harboured a deep and  rooted resentment against herself. She recoiled, without well knowing  why, before the ferocious passions of her kinsman, and was convinced  that she had nothing to hope from his implacable temper. But her alarm  was the prelude of firmness, and not of cowardice.    \"No, sir,\" replied she, \"indeed I will not be driven any way that you  happen to like. I have been used to obey you, and, in all that is  reasonable, I will obey you still. But you urge me too far. What do you  tell me of Mr. Falkland? Have I ever done any thing to deserve your  unkind suspicions? I am innocent, and will continue innocent. Mr. Grimes  is well enough, and will no doubt find women that like him; but he is  not fit for me, and torture shall not force me to be his wife.\"    Mr. Tyrrel was not a little astonished at the spirit which Emily  displayed upon this occasion. He had calculated too securely upon the  general mildness and suavity of her disposition. He now endeavoured to  qualify the harshness of his former sentiments.    \"God damn my soul! And so you can scold, can you? You expect every body  to turn out of his way, and fetch and carry, just as you please? I could  find in my heart--But you know my mind. I insist upon it that you let  Grimes court you, and that you lay aside your sulks, and give him a fair  hearing. Will you do that? If then you persist in your wilfulness, why  there, I suppose, is an end of the matter. Do not think that any body is  going to marry you, whether you will or no. You are no such mighty  prize, I assure you. If you knew your own interest, you would be glad to  take the young fellow while he is willing.\"    Miss Melville rejoiced in the prospect, which the last words of her  kinsman afforded her, of a termination at no great distance to her  present persecutions. Mrs. Jakeman, to whom she communicated them,  congratulated Emily on the returning moderation and good sense of the  squire, and herself on her prudence in having urged the young lady to  this happy expostulation. But their mutual felicitations lasted not  long. Mr. Tyrrel informed Mrs. Jakeman of the necessity in which he  found himself of sending her to a distance, upon a business which would  not fail to detain her several weeks; and, though the errand by no means  wore an artificial or ambiguous face, the two friends drew a melancholy  presage from this ill-timed separation. Mrs. Jakeman, in the mean time,  exhorted her ward to persevere, reminded her of the compunction which  had already been manifested by her kinsman, and encouraged her to hope  every thing from her courage and good temper. Emily, on her part, though  grieved at the absence of her protector and counsellor at so interesting  a crisis, was unable to suspect Mr. Tyrrel of such a degree either of  malice or duplicity as could afford ground for serious alarm. She  congratulated herself upon her delivery from so alarming a persecution,  and drew a prognostic of future success from this happy termination of  the first serious affair of her life. She exchanged a state of fortitude  and alarm for her former pleasing dreams respecting Mr. Falkland. These  she bore without impatience. She was even taught by the uncertainty of  the event to desire to prolong, rather than abridge, a situation which  might be delusive, but which was not without its pleasures.          CHAPTER VIII.      Nothing could be further from Mr. Tyrrel's intention than to suffer his  project to be thus terminated. No sooner was he freed from the fear of  his housekeeper's interference, than he changed the whole system of his  conduct. He ordered Miss Melville to be closely confined to her  apartment, and deprived of all means of communicating her situation to  any one out of his own house. He placed over her a female servant, in  whose discretion he could confide, and who, having formerly been  honoured with the amorous notices of the squire, considered the  distinctions that were paid to Emily at Tyrrel Place as an usurpation  upon her more reasonable claims. The squire himself did every thing in  his power to blast the young lady's reputation, and represented to his  attendants these precautions as necessary, to prevent her from eloping  to his neighbour, and plunging herself in total ruin.    As soon as Miss Melville had been twenty-four hours in durance, and  there was some reason to suppose that her spirit might be subdued to the  emergency of her situation, Mr. Tyrrel thought proper to go to her, to  explain the grounds of her present treatment, and acquaint her with the  only means by which she could hope for a change. Emily no sooner saw  him, than she turned towards him with an air of greater firmness than  perhaps she had ever assumed in her life, and accosted him thus:--    \"Well, sir, is it you? I wanted to see you. It seems I am shut up here  by your orders. What does this mean? What right have you to make a  prisoner of me? What do I owe you? Your mother left me a hundred pounds:  have you ever offered to make any addition to my fortune? But, if you  had, I do not want it. I do not pretend to be better than the children  of other poor parents; I can maintain myself as they do. I prefer  liberty to wealth. I see you are surprised at the resolution I exert.  But ought I not to turn again, when I am trampled upon? I should have  left you before now, if Mrs. Jakeman had not over-persuaded me, and if I  had not thought better of you than by your present behaviour I find you  deserve. But now, sir, I intend to leave your house this moment, and  insist upon it, that you do not endeavour to prevent me.\"    Thus saying, she rose, and went towards the door, while Mr. Tyrrel stood  thunderstruck at her magnanimity. Seeing, however, that she was upon the  point of being out of the reach of his power, he recovered himself and  pulled her back.    \"What is in the wind now? Do you think, strumpet; that you shall get  the better of me by sheer impudence? Sit down! rest you satisfied!--So  you want to know by what right you are here, do you? By the right of  possession. This house is mine, and you are in my power. There is no  Mrs. Jakeman now to spirit you away; no, nor no Falkland to bully for  you. I have countermined you, damn me! and blown up your schemes. Do you  think I will be contradicted and opposed for nothing? When did you ever  know"]]]
