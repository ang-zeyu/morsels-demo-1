For, by another law, it was forbidden to any one to change his  residence without license. *73 He was settled for life.  The  Peruvian government prescribed to every man his local habitation,  his sphere of action, nay, the very nature and quality of that  action.  He ceased to be a free agent; it might be almost said,  that it relieved him of personal responsibility.    [Footnote 71: Ondegardo, Rel. Prim., Ms. - Fernandez, Hist. del  Peru, Parte 2, lib. 3, cap. 11.]    [Footnote 72: \"This regulation,\" says Father Acosta, \"the Incas  held to be of great importance to the order and right government  of the realm.\" lib. 6, cap. 16.]    [Footnote 73: Conq. i Pob. del Piru, Ms.]    In following out this singular arrangement, the Incas showed as  much regard for the comfort and convenience of the colonist as  was compatible with the execution of their design.  They were  careful that the mitimaes, as these emigrants were styled, should  be removed to climates most congenial with their own.  The  inhabitants of the cold countries were not transplanted to the  warm, nor the inhabitants of the warm countries to the cold. *74  Even their habitual occupations were consulted, and the fisherman  was settled in the neighbourhood of the ocean, or the great  lakes; while such lands were assigned to the husbandman as were  best adapted to the culture with which he was most familiar. *75  And, as migration by many, perhaps by most, would be regarded as  a calamity, the government was careful to show particular marks  of favor to the mitimaes, and, by various privileges and  immunities, to ameliorate their condition, and thus to reconcile  them, if possible, to their lot. *76    [Footnote 74: \"Trasmutaban de las tales Provincias la cantidad de  gente de que de ella parecia convenir que saliese, a los cuales  mandaban pasar a poblar otra tierra del temple y manera de donde  salian, si fria fria, si caliente caliente, en donde les daban  tierras, y campos, y casas, tanto, y mas como dejaron.\"  Sarmiento, Relacion, Ms., cap. 19.]    [Footnote 75: Ondegardo, Rel. Prim., Ms.]    [Footnote 76: The descendants of these mitimaes are still to be  found in Quito, or were so at the close of the last century,  according to Velasco, distinguished by this name from the rest of  the population.  Hist. de Quito, tom.l. p. 175.]    The Peruvian institutions, though they may have been modified and  matured under successive sovereigns, all bear the stamp of the  same original, - were all cast in the same mould.  The empire,  strengthening and enlarging at every successive epoch of its  history, was, in its latter days, but the development, on a great  scale, of what it was in miniature at its commencement, as the  infant germ is said to contain within itself all the  ramifications of the future monarch of the forest.  Each  succeeding Inca seemed desirous only to tread in the path, and  carry out the plans, of his predecessor.  Great enterprises,  commenced under one, were continued by another, and completed by  a third.  Thus, while all acted on a regular plan, without any of  the eccentric or retrograde movements which betray the agency of  different individuals, the state seemed to be under the direction  of a single hand, and steadily pursued, as if through one long  reign, its great career of civilization and of conquest.    The ultimate aim of its institutions was domestic quiet.  But it  seemed as if this were to be obtained only by foreign war.  Tranquillity in the heart of the monarchy, and war on its  borders, was the condition of Peru. By this war it gave  occupation to a part of its people, and, by the reduction and  civilization of its barbarous neighbours, gave security to all.  Every Inca sovereign, however mild and benevolent in his domestic  rule, was a warrior, and led his armies in person.  Each  successive reign extended still wider the boundaries of the  empire.  Year after year saw the victorious monarch return laden  with spoils, and followed by a throng of tributary chieftains to  his capital.  His reception there was a Roman triumph.  The whole  of its numerous population poured out to welcome him, dressed in  the gay and picturesque costumes of the different provinces, with  banners waving above their heads, and strewing branches and  flowers along the path of the conqueror.  The Inca, borne aloft  in his golden chair on the shoulders of his nobles, moved in  solemn procession, under the triumphal arches that were thrown  across the way, to the great temple of the Sun.  There, without  attendants, - for all but the monarch were excluded from the  hallowed precincts, - the victorious prince, stripped of his  royal insignia, barefooted, and with all humility, approached the  awful shrine, and offered up sacrifice and thanksgiving to the  glorious Deity who presided over the fortunes of the Incas.  This  ceremony concluded, the whole population gave itself up to  festivity; music, revelry, and dancing were heard in every  quarter of the capital, and illuminations and bonfires  commemorated the victorious campaign of the Inca, and the  accession of a new territory to his empire. *77    [Footnote 77: Sarmiento, Relacion, Ms., Parte 1, lib. 3, cap. 11,  17; lib. 6 cap. 55. - Garcilasso, Com. Real., cap. 16.]    In this celebration we see much of the character of a religious  festival. Indeed, the character of religion was impressed on all  the Peruvian wars.  The life of an Inca was one long crusade  against the infidel, to spread wide the worship of the Sun, to  reclaim the benighted nations from their brutish superstitions,  and impart to them the blessings of a well-regulated government.  This, in the favorite phrase of our day, was the \"mission\" of the  Inca.  It was also the mission of the Christian conqueror who  invaded the empire of this same Indian potentate.  Which of the  two executed his mission most faithfully, history must decide.    Yet the Peruvian monarchs did not show a childish impatience in  the acquisition of empire.  They paused after a campaign, and  allowed time for the settlement of one conquest before they  undertook another; and, in this interval, occupied themselves  with the quiet administration of their kingdom, and with the long  progresses, which brought them into nearer intercourse with their  people.  During this interval, also, their new vassals had begun  to accommodate themselves to the strange institutions of their  masters.  They learned to appreciate the value of a government  which raised them above the physical evils of a state of  barbarism, secured them protection of person, and a full  participation in all the privileges enjoyed by their conquerors;  and, as they became more familiar with the peculiar institutions  of the country, habit, that second nature, attached them the more  strongly to these institutions, from their very peculiarity.  Thus, by degrees, and without violence, arose the great fabric of  the Peruvian empire, composed of numerous independent and even  hostile tribes, yet, under the influence of a common religion,  common language, and common government, knit together as one  nation, animated by a spirit of love for its institutions and  devoted loyalty to its sovereign.  What a contrast to the  condition of the Aztec monarchy, on the neighbouring continent,  which, composed of the like heterogeneous materials, without any  internal principle of cohesion, was only held together by the  stern pressure, from without, of physical force! - Why the  Peruvian monarchy should have fared no better than its rival, in  its conflict with European civilization, will appear in the  following pages.            Chapter III    Peruvian Religion. - Deities. - Gorgeous Temples. - Festivals. -  Virgins Of The Sun. - Marriage.      It is a remarkable fact, that many, if not most, of the rude  tribes inhabiting the vast American continent, however disfigured  their creeds may have been in other respects by a childish  superstition, had attained to the sublime conception of one Great  Spirit, the Creator of the Universe, who, immaterial in his own  nature, was not to be dishonored by an attempt at visible  representation, and who, pervading all space, was not to be  circumscribed within the walls of a temple.  Yet these elevated  ideas, so far beyond the ordinary range of the untutored  intellect, do not seem to have led to the practical consequences  that might have been expected; and few of the American nations  have shown much solicitude for the maintenance of a religious  worship, or found in their faith a powerful spring of action.  But, with progress in civilization, ideas more akin to those of  civilized communities were gradually unfolded; a liberal  provision was made, and a separate order instituted, for the  services of religion, which were conducted with a minute and  magnificent ceremonial, that challenged comparison, in some  respects, with that of the most polished nations of Christendom.  This was the case with the nations inhabiting the table-land of  North America, and with the natives of Bogota, Quito, Peru, and  the other elevated regions on the great Southern continent.  It  was, above all, the case with the Peruvians, who claimed a divine  original for the founders of their empire, whose laws all rested  on a divine sanction, and whose domestic institutions and foreign  wars were alike directed to preserve and propagate their faith.  Religion was the basis of their polity, the very condition, as it  were, of their social existence.  The government of the Incas, in  its essential principles, was a theocracy.    Yet, though religion entered so largely into the fabric and  conduct of the political institutions of the people, their  mythology, that is, the traditionary"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13240"],[0,"A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature (#17)"],[1,"career, and was called to the Scottish Bar in 1800, and  to the English Bar in 1808. His chief forensic display was his defence of  Queen Caroline in 1822. In 1810 he entered Parliament, where his  versatility and eloquence soon raised him to a foremost place. The  questions on which he chiefly exerted himself were the slave trade,  commercial, legal, and parliamentary reform, and education, and in all of  these he rendered signal service. When, in 1830, the Whigs, with whom he  had always acted, attained power, B. was made Lord Chancellor; but his  arrogance, selfishness, and indiscretion rendered him a dangerous and  unreliable colleague, and he was never again admitted to office. He  turned fiercely against his former political associates, but continued  his efforts on behalf of reform in various directions. He was one of the  founders of London Univ. and of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful  Knowledge. In literature he has a place as one of the original projectors  of and most voluminous contributors to _The Edinburgh Review_, and as the  author of a prodigious number of treatises on science, philosophy, and  history, including _Dialogues on Instinct_, Lives of Statesmen,  Philosophers, and Men of Science of the Time of George III., Natural  Theology, etc., his last work being an autobiography written in his 84th  year, and _pub._ 1871. His writings were far too numerous and far too  diverse in subject to be of permanent value. His fame now rests chiefly  on his services to political and specially to legal reform, and to the  diffusion of useful literature, which are his lasting monuments.      BROUGHTON, JOHN CAM HOBHOUSE, 1ST LORD (1786-1869).--Eldest _s._ of Sir  Benjamin H., _b._ at Redland near Bristol, _ed._ at Westminster School  and at Camb., where he became intimate with Byron, and accompanied him in  his journeys in the Peninsula, Greece, and Turkey, and acted as his \"best  man.\" In 1816 he was with him after his separation from his wife, and  contributed notes to the fourth canto of _Childe Harold_, which was  dedicated to him. On his return he threw himself into politics with great  energy as an advanced Radical, and wrote various pamphlets, for one of  which he was in 1819 imprisoned in Newgate. In the following year he  entered Parliament, sitting for Westminster. After the attainment of  power by the Whigs he held various offices, including those of Sec. at  War, Chief Sec. for Ireland, and Pres. of the Board of Control. He _pub._  _Journey through Albania_ (1813), _Historical Illustrations of the Fourth  Canto of Childe Harold_ (1818), and _Recollections of a Long Life_  (1865), for private circulation, and he left in MS. _Diaries,  Correspondence, and Memoranda, etc., not to be opened till 1900_,  extracts from which were _pub._ by his _dau._, Lady Dorchester, also  under the title of _Recollections from a Long Life_ (1909).      BROWN, CHARLES BROCKDEN (1771-1810).--Novelist, _b._ in Philadelphia,  belonged to a Quaker family, became a lawyer, but exchanged law for  literature, and has the distinction of being the first American to adopt  a purely literary career. He wrote several novels, including _Wieland_  (1798), _Ormond_ (1799), _Arthur Mervyn_ (1800-1), and his last, _Jane  Talbot_ (1801). With a good deal of crudeness and sentimentality he has  occasional power, but dwells too much on the horrible and repulsive, the  result, perhaps, of the morbidity produced by the ill-health from which  he all his life suffered.      BROWN, GEORGE DOUGLAS (1869-1902).--Novelist, wrote _The House with the  Green Shutters_, which gives a strongly outlined picture of the harder  and less genial aspects of Scottish life and character. It may be  regarded as a useful supplement and corrective to the more roseate  presentations of the kail-yard school of J.M. Barrie and \"Ian Maclaren.\"  It made a considerable impression. The author _d._ almost immediately  after its publication. There is an ed. with a memoir by Mr. Andrew Lang.      BROWN, DR. JOHN (1810-1882).--Physician and essayist, _s._ of John B.,  D.D., a distinguished dissenting minister in Edin. _B._ at Biggar, he was  _ed._ at the High School and Univ. of Edin., where practically the whole  of his uneventful life was spent as a physician, and where he was revered  and beloved in no common degree, and he was the cherished friend of many  of his most distinguished contemporaries, including Thackeray. He wrote  comparatively little; but all he did write is good, some of it perfect,  of its kind. His essays, among which are _Rab and his Friends_, _Pet  Marjorie_, _Our Dogs_, _Minchmoor_, and _The Enterkine_, were collected  along with papers on art, and medical history and biography, in _Horae  Subsecivae_ (Leisure Hours), 3 vols. In the mingling of tenderness and  delicate humour he has much in common with Lamb; in his insight into  dog-nature he is unique. His later years were clouded with occasional  fits of depression.      BROWN, THOMAS (1778-1820).--Metaphysician, _s._ of the Rev. Samuel B.,  minister of Kirkinabreck, practised for some time as a physician in  Edin., but his tastes and talents lying in the direction of literature  and philosophy, he devoted himself to the cultivation of these, and  succeeded Dugald Stewart as Professor of Moral Philosophy in the Univ. of  Edin., in which position he had remarkable popularity as a lecturer. His  main contribution to literature is his _Lectures_, _pub._ after his  death. B. was a man of attractive character and considerable talents, but  as a philosopher he is now largely superseded. He also wrote poetry,  which, though graceful, lacked force, and is now forgotten.      BROWN, THOMAS EDWARD (1830-1897).--Poet, _b._ at Douglas, Isle of Man,  _s._ of a clergyman, and _ed._ there and at Oxf., entered the Church and  held various scholastic appointments, including a mastership at Clifton.  His later years were spent in his native island. He had a true lyrical  gift, and much of his poetry was written in Manx dialect. His poems  include _Fo'c'sle Yarns_ (1881), _The Doctor_ (1887), _The Manx Witch_  (1889), and _Old John_ (1893). He was also an admirable letter-writer,  and 2 vols. of his letters have been _pub._      BROWN, TOM (1663-1704).--Satirist, was _ed._ at Oxf., and there composed  the famous epigram on Dr. Fell. He was for a few years schoolmaster at  Kingston-on-Thames, but owing to his irregularities lost the appointment,  and went to London, where he wrote satires, epigrams, and miscellaneous  pieces, generally coarse and scurrilous.      BROWNE, CHARLES FARRAR (1834-1867).--Humorist (Artemus Ward), _b._ in  Maine, U.S., worked as a compositor and reporter, and became a highly  popular humorous writer, his books being _Artemus Ward his Book_, _A.W.  His Panorama_, _A.W. among the Mormons_, and _A.W. in England_.      BROWNE, ISAAC HAWKINS (1705-1760).--Is remembered as the author of some  clever imitations of contemporary poets on the theme of _A Pipe of  Tobacco_, somewhat analogous to the _Rejected Addresses_ of a later day.  He also wrote a Latin poem on the immortality of the soul. B., who was a  country gentleman and barrister, had great conversational powers. He was  a friend of Dr. Johnson.      BROWNE, SIR THOMAS (1605-1682).--Physician and miscellaneous and  metaphysical writer, _s._ of a London merchant, was _ed._ at Winchester  and Oxf., after which he studied medicine at various Continental univs.,  including Leyden, where he _grad._ He ultimately settled and practised at  Norwich. His first and perhaps best known work, _Religio Medici_ (the  Religion of a Physician) was _pub._ in 1642. Other books are _Pseudodoxia  Epidemica: Enquiries into Vulgar Errors_ (1646), _Hydriotaphia, or  Urn-burial_ (1658); and _The Garden of Cyrus_ in the same year. After his  death were _pub._ his _Letter to a Friend_ and _Christian Morals_. B. is  one of the most original writers in the English language. Though by no  means free from credulity, and dealing largely with trivial subjects of  inquiry, the freshness and ingenuity of his mind invest everything he  touches with interest; while on more important subjects his style, if  frequently rugged and pedantic, often rises to the highest pitch of grave  and stately eloquence. In the Civil War he sided with the King's party,  and was knighted in 1671 on the occasion of a Royal visit to Norwich. In  character he was simple, cheerful, and retiring. He has had a profound if  indirect influence on succeeding literature, mainly by impressing  master-minds such as Lamb, Coleridge, and Carlyle.    There is an ed. of B.'s works by S. Wilkin (4 vols., 1835-6), _Religio  Medici_ by Dr. Greenhill, 1881. _Life_ by Gosse in Men of Letters Series,  1903.      BROWNE, WILLIAM (1590?-1645?).--Poet, _b._ at Tavistock, _ed._ at Oxf.,  after which he entered the Inner Temple. His poems, which are mainly  descriptive, are rich and flowing, and true to the phenomena of nature,  but deficient in interest. Influenced by Spenser, he in turn had an  influence upon such poets as Milton and Keats. His chief works were  _Britannia's Pastorals_ (1613), and _The Shepheard's Pipe_ (1614).      BROWNING, ELIZABETH BARRETT (1806-1861).--Poetess, was the _dau._ of  Edward Barrett Moulton Barrett, who assumed the last name on succeeding  to the estates of his grandfather in Jamaica. She was _b._ at Coxhoe  Hall, Durham, but spent her youth at Hope End, near Great Malvern. While  still a child she showed her gift, and her _f._ _pub._ 50 copies of a  juvenile epic, on the Battle of Marathon. She was _ed._ at home, but owed  her profound knowledge of Greek and much mental stimulus to her early  friendship with the blind scholar, Hugh Stuart Boyd, who was a neighbour.  At the age of 15 she met with an injury to her spine which confined her  to a recumbent position for several years, and from the effects of which  she never fully recovered. In 1826 she _pub._ anonymously"]]]
