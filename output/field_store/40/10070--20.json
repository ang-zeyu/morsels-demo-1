But  whether innocent or guilty, your trial begins to-morrow, and the day  after you will be condemned. Matters are settled very quickly in these  times.\"    \"Well, and what do you conclude from all this?\"    \"I conclude that I am alone, that I am weak, that my father is lying in  a swoon, that the dog is muzzled, and that consequently there is nothing  to prevent your making your escape. Fly, then; that's what I mean.\"    \"What do you say?\"    \"I say that I was not able to save Mynheer Cornelius or Mynheer John  de Witt, and that I should like to save you. Only be quick; there, my  father is regaining his breath, one minute more, and he will open his  eyes, and it will be too late. Do you hesitate?\"    In fact, Cornelius stood immovable, looking at Rosa, yet looking at her  as if he did not hear her.    \"Don't you understand me?\" said the young girl, with some impatience.    \"Yes, I do,\" said Cornelius, \"but----\"    \"But?\"    \"I will not, they would accuse you.\"    \"Never mind,\" said Rosa, blushing, \"never mind that.\"    \"You are very good, my dear child,\" replied Cornelius, \"but I stay.\"    \"You stay, oh, sir! oh, sir! don't you understand that you will be  condemned to death, executed on the scaffold, perhaps assassinated  and torn to pieces, just like Mynheer John and Mynheer Cornelius. For  heaven's sake, don't think of me, but fly from this place, Take care, it  bears ill luck to the De Witts!\"    \"Halloa!\" cried the jailer, recovering his senses, \"who is talking of  those rogues, those wretches, those villains, the De Witts?\"    \"Don't be angry, my good man,\" said Cornelius, with his good-tempered  smile, \"the worst thing for a fracture is excitement, by which the blood  is heated.\"    Thereupon, he said in an undertone to Rosa--    \"My child, I am innocent, and I shall await my trial with tranquillity  and an easy mind.\"    \"Hush,\" said Rosa.    \"Why hush?\"    \"My father must not suppose that we have been talking to each other.\"    \"What harm would that do?\"    \"What harm? He would never allow me to come here any more,\" said Rosa.    Cornelius received this innocent confidence with a smile; he felt as if  a ray of good fortune were shining on his path.    \"Now, then, what are you chattering there together about?\" said Gryphus,  rising and supporting his right arm with his left.    \"Nothing,\" said Rosa; \"the doctor is explaining to me what diet you are  to keep.\"    \"Diet, diet for me? Well, my fine girl, I shall put you on diet too.\"    \"On what diet, my father?\"    \"Never to go to the cells of the prisoners, and, if ever you should  happen to go, to leave them as soon as possible. Come, off with me, lead  the way, and be quick.\"    Rosa and Cornelius exchanged glances.    That of Rosa tried to express,--    \"There, you see?\"    That of Cornelius said,--    \"Let it be as the Lord wills.\"          Chapter 11. Cornelius van Baerle's Will      Rosa had not been mistaken; the judges came on the following day to the  Buytenhof, and proceeded with the trial of Cornelius van Baerle. The  examination, however, did not last long, it having appeared on evidence  that Cornelius had kept at his house that fatal correspondence of the  brothers De Witt with France.    He did not deny it.    The only point about which there seemed any difficulty was whether this  correspondence had been intrusted to him by his godfather, Cornelius de  Witt.    But as, since the death of those two martyrs, Van Baerle had no longer  any reason for withholding the truth, he not only did not deny that the  parcel had been delivered to him by Cornelius de Witt himself, but he  also stated all the circumstances under which it was done.    This confession involved the godson in the crime of the godfather;  manifest complicity being considered to exist between Cornelius de Witt  and Cornelius van Baerle.    The honest doctor did not confine himself to this avowal, but told the  whole truth with regard to his own tastes, habits, and daily life. He  described his indifference to politics, his love of study, of the fine  arts, of science, and of flowers. He explained that, since the day when  Cornelius de Witt handed to him the parcel at Dort, he himself had never  touched, nor even noticed it.    To this it was objected, that in this respect he could not possibly be  speaking the truth, since the papers had been deposited in a press in  which both his hands and his eyes must have been engaged every day.    Cornelius answered that it was indeed so; that, however, he never put  his hand into the press but to ascertain whether his bulbs were dry,  and that he never looked into it but to see if they were beginning to  sprout.    To this again it was objected, that his pretended indifference  respecting this deposit was not to be reasonably entertained, as he  could not have received such papers from the hand of his godfather  without being made acquainted with their important character.    He replied that his godfather Cornelius loved him too well, and, above  all, that he was too considerate a man to have communicated to him  anything of the contents of the parcel, well knowing that such a  confidence would only have caused anxiety to him who received it.    To this it was objected that, if De Witt had wished to act in such  a way, he would have added to the parcel, in case of accidents, a  certificate setting forth that his godson was an entire stranger to the  nature of this correspondence, or at least he would during his  trial have written a letter to him, which might be produced as his  justification.    Cornelius replied that undoubtedly his godfather could not have thought  that there was any risk for the safety of his deposit, hidden as it  was in a press which was looked upon as sacred as the tabernacle by the  whole household of Van Baerle; and that consequently he had considered  the certificate as useless. As to a letter, he certainly had some  remembrance that some moments previous to his arrest, whilst he was  absorbed in the contemplation of one of the rarest of his bulbs, John de  Witt's servant entered his dry-room, and handed to him a paper, but the  whole was to him only like a vague dream; the servant had disappeared,  and as to the paper, perhaps it might be found if a proper search were  made.    As far as Craeke was concerned, it was impossible to find him, as he had  left Holland.    The paper also was not very likely to be found, and no one gave himself  the trouble to look for it.    Cornelius himself did not much press this point, since, even supposing  that the paper should turn up, it could not have any direct connection  with the correspondence which constituted the crime.    The judges wished to make it appear as though they wanted to urge  Cornelius to make a better defence; they displayed that benevolent  patience which is generally a sign of the magistrate's being interested  for the prisoner, or of a man's having so completely got the better of  his adversary that he needs no longer any oppressive means to ruin him.    Cornelius did not accept of this hypocritical protection, and in a last  answer, which he set forth with the noble bearing of a martyr and the  calm serenity of a righteous man, he said,--    \"You ask me things, gentlemen, to which I can answer only the exact  truth. Hear it. The parcel was put into my hands in the way I have  described; I vow before God that I was, and am still, ignorant of its  contents, and that it was not until my arrest that I learned that this  deposit was the correspondence of the Grand Pensionary with the Marquis  de Louvois. And lastly, I vow and protest that I do not understand how  any one should have known that this parcel was in my house; and,  above all, how I can be deemed criminal for having received what my  illustrious and unfortunate godfather brought to my house.\"    This was Van Baerle's whole defence; after which the judges began to  deliberate on the verdict.    They considered that every offshoot of civil discord is mischievous,  because it revives the contest which it is the interest of all to put  down.    One of them, who bore the character of a profound observer, laid down  as his opinion that this young man, so phlegmatic in appearance, must  in reality be very dangerous, as under this icy exterior he was sure to  conceal an ardent desire to avenge his friends, the De Witts.    Another observed that the love of tulips agreed perfectly well with that  of politics, and that it was proved in history that many very dangerous  men were engaged in gardening, just as if it had been their profession,  whilst really they occupied themselves with perfectly different  concerns; witness Tarquin the Elder, who grew poppies at Gabii, and the  Great Conde, who watered his carnations at the dungeon of Vincennes at  the very moment when the former meditated his return to Rome, and the  latter his escape from prison.    The judge summed up with the following dilemma:--    \"Either Cornelius van Baerle is a great lover of tulips, or a great  lover of politics; in either case, he has told us a falsehood; first,  because his having occupied himself with politics is proved by the  letters which were found at his house; and secondly, because his having  occupied himself with tulips is proved by the bulbs which leave no doubt  of the fact. And herein lies the enormity of the case. As Cornelius  van Baerle was concerned in the growing of tulips and in the pursuit of  politics at one and the same time, the prisoner is of hybrid"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9650"],[0,"Independent Bohemia (#16)"],[1,"being      consulted: all other states presented the declaration of war to their      parliaments for ratification, only the Viennese Government was afraid      to consult its peoples, because the majority of them would have      declared against the war. The representatives of the Czech nation would      have certainly protested with the greatest emphasis. That is why the      government did not consult a single Czech deputy or politician with      regard to taking so momentous a step.        \"The Czech nation has always in modern times defended a thoroughly Slav      programme. Also during this war, which has found our nation unprepared      like all other peaceful nations, the Czechs have since the very      beginning expressed their sympathies for Russia, Serbia and their      Allies, notwithstanding the unprecedented Austrian terrorism,      suppressing every manifestation of the real feelings of the people. The      pro-Austrian declarations are enforced by the government. To-day the      leading Czech politicians are in prison, the gallows have become the      favourite support of the incapable administration, and Czech regiments      have been decimated for acting spontaneously up to our national Czech      programme. The rights of the Czech language have been ruthlessly      violated during the war, and the absolutist military rule has reigned      throughout Bohemia and other non-German and non-Magyar parts of the      monarchy as in enemy countries. Every declaration in the Czech journals      is suppressed, while our national adversaries are not only allowed to      make propaganda against the Czech nation, but even the pan-German      orgies in the spirit of Lagarde, von Hartmann, Mommsen, and Treitschke      are supported by Vienna and Budapest.        \"Under these circumstances the Czech nation cannot continue to keep      silence. That is why the Czech and Slovak emigrants abroad deem it      their duty to inform foreign opinion about the true situation of      Bohemia, to interpret the aspirations of the Czecho-Slovak nation to      the Allied statesmen, politicians and journalists, and to defend the      Czecho-Slovak programme.        \"The Czech parties have hitherto striven for the independence of their      nation inside Austria-Hungary. _The course which this fratricidal war      has taken and the ruthless violence of Vienna make it necessary for all      of us to strive for independence without regard to Austria-Hungary. We      are struggling for an absolutely independent Czecho-Slovak State_.        \"The Czech nation has come to the conclusion that it must take its      destiny into its own hands. Austria was defeated not only by Russia,      but also by the small and despised Serbia, and became a dependency of      Germany. To-day it has recovered a little under the direction of      Berlin, but that desperate strain of forces does not deceive us: it is      only a proof of the abdication of Austria-Hungary. We have lost all      confidence in the vitality of Austria-Hungary, and we no more recognise      its right to existence. Through its incapability and dependence it has      proved to the whole world that the assumption of the necessity of      Austria has passed, and has through this war been proved to be wrong.      Those who have defended the possibility and necessity of      Austria-Hungary--and at one time it was Palacky himself--demanded a      confederated state of equal nations and lands. But the dualist      Austria-Hungary became the oppressor of non-German and non-Magyar      nationalities. It is the obstacle to peace in Europe and it has      degenerated into a mere tool for Germany's expansion to the East,      without a positive mission of its own, unable to create a state      organisation of equal nations, free and progressive in civilisation.      The dynasty, living in its absolutist traditions, maintains itself a      phantom of its former world empire, assisted in government by its      undemocratic partners, the barren aristocracy, the anti-national      bureaucracy, and the anti-national military staff.        \"To-day there is no doubt that Austria-Hungary wrongly used the      assassination at Sarajevo as a pretext against Serbia. Vienna and      Budapest did not hesitate to use forged documents manufactured by their      own embassy against the Yugoslavs, and in this policy of deceit Vienna      and Budapest have persisted during this war. To this deceit they have      now added revengeful spitefulness and cruelty truly barbarian against      the non-Germans and non-Magyars.        \"Germany shares the guilt with Austria-Hungary; it was in Germany's      power and it was her duty towards civilisation and humanity to prevent      the war and not to take advantage of the imperialist lust of Vienna and      Budapest.        \"Austria-Hungary and Germany are fighting with their Turkish and      Bulgarian Allies for a cause which is unjust and doomed.\"    Later on, when _Dr. Edward Benes_, lecturer at the Czech University of  Prague and author of several well-known studies in sociology, also escaped  abroad, the Czecho-Slovak National Council was formed, of which Professor  Masaryk became the president, _Dr. Stefanik_, a distinguished airman and  scientist, Hungarian Slovak by birth, the vice-president, and Dr. E. Benes  the general secretary. A French review was started in Paris (_La Nation  Tcheque_) in May, 1915, which became the official organ of the  Czecho-Slovak movement. Up to May, 1917, it was published under the  editorship of Professor Denis, and since then its editor has been Dr.  Benes. A Central Czech organ is also published in Paris called  _Samostatnost_ (\"Independence\"), edited by Dr. Sychrava, an eminent Czech  journalist.    The undisputed authority enjoyed by Professor Masaryk among all the  Czecho-Slovaks is undoubtedly the secret of the great strength and unity of  the movement. It is also the reason for the great diplomatic successes  achieved by the Czechs. The chief lieutenants of Professor Masaryk were Dr.  Benes, an untiring worker with rare political instinct and perspicacity,  and Dr. Milan Stefanik, who entered the French army as a private at the  beginning of the war, was gradually promoted, and in May, 1918, rose to the  rank of brigadier-general. He rendered valuable service to France as an  astronomist before the war, and as an airman during the war. He has  rendered still greater service to the Czecho-Slovak cause as a diplomat.  These three men, unanimously recognised by the two million Czecho-Slovaks  in the Allied countries as their leaders, were finally, in the summer of  1918, recognised also by the Allies as the _de facto_ provisional  government of the Czecho-Slovak State, with all rights and powers of a real  government. The central seat of the Czecho-Slovak Government is in Paris,  and official Czecho-Slovak representatives and legations are in all the  Allied capitals.    3. The first political success of the National Council was the Allies' Note  to President Wilson of January 10, 1917. The Czechs are especially grateful  to France for this first recognition of their claims.    In this Note, in which the Allies for the first time stated publicly and  explicitly their war aims, the Allies declared that these include:        \"The reorganisation of Europe guaranteed by a stable settlement, based      upon the principle of nationality, upon the right which all peoples,      whether small or great, have to the enjoyment of full security and free      economic development, and also upon territorial agreements and      international arrangements so framed as to guarantee land and sea      frontiers against unjust attacks; the restitution of provinces or      territories formerly torn from the Allies by force or contrary to the      wishes of their inhabitants; _the liberation of Italians, Slavs,      Rumanians and Czecho-Slovaks from foreign domination_; the liberation      of the peoples who now lie beneath the murderous tyranny of the Turks,      and the expulsion from Europe of the Ottoman Empire, which has proved      itself so radically alien to Western civilisation.\"    The greatest success of the Czecho-Slovak National Council, however, has  been the formal recognition by France of the formation of an autonomous  Czecho-Slovak army in France with the National Council at its head. By this  act France recognised:    (1) That the Czecho-Slovaks have a right to form an army of their own,  which right appertains only to a sovereign and independent nation;    (2) That the Czecho-Slovaks have a right to fight on the side of the  Entente, and therefore are to be considered as one of the Allies;    (3) That the political direction of the army is reserved to the  Czecho-Slovak National Council, which right is usually accorded only to the  government of an independent state.    The full text of this historic document, signed by the President of the  French Republic, M. Poincare, the French Premier, M. Clemenceau, and the  Foreign Secretary, M. Pichon, and dated December 19, 1917, reads  as follows:        \"1. The Czecho-Slovaks organised in an autonomous army and recognising,      from the military point of view, the superior authority of the French      high command, will fight under their own flag against the Central      Powers.        \"2. This national army is placed, from the political point of view,      under the direction of the Czecho-Slovak National Council whose      headquarters are in Paris.        \"3. The formation of the Czecho-Slovak army as well as its further work      are assured by the French Government.        \"4. The Czecho-Slovak army will be subject to the same dispositions as      regards organisation, hierarchy, administration and military discipline      as those in force in the French army.        \"5. The Czecho-Slovak army will be recruited from among:        (_a_) Czecho-Slovaks at present"]]]
