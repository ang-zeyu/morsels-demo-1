[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9793"],[0,"Josephus (#16)"],[1,"Josephus as man of letters was the history of the wars  of the Jews against the Romans, for which, according to his own  statement, he prepared from the time of his surrender by taking copious  notes of the events which he witnessed. He completed it in the fortieth  year of his life and dedicated it to Vespasian.[1] He seems originally  to have designed the record of the struggle for the purpose of  persuading his brethren in the East that it was useless to fight further  against the Romans. He desired to prove to them that God was on the side  of the big battalions, and that the Jews had forfeited His protection by  their manifold transgressions. The Zealots were as wicked as they were  misguided, and to follow them was to march to certain ruin. It is not  unlikely that Josephus was commissioned by Titus to compose his version  of the war for the \"Upper Barbarians,\" whose rising in alliance with the  Parthians might have troubled the conqueror of Jerusalem, as it  afterwards troubled Trajan. But, save that it was written in Aramaic, we  cannot tell the form of the original history, since it has entirely  disappeared.    [Footnote 1: B.J. VII. xv. 8.]    Josephus says in the preface to the extant Greek books that he  translated into Greek the account he had already written. But he  certainly did much more than translate. The whole trend of the narrative  and the purpose must have been changed when he came to present the  events for a Greco-Roman audience. He was concerned less to instill  respect for Rome in his countrymen than to inspire regard for his  countrymen in the Romans, and at the same time to show that the  Rebellion was not the deliberate work of the whole people, but due to  the instigation of a band of desperate, unscrupulous fanatics. He was  concerned also to show that God, the vanquished Jewish God, as the  Romans would regard Him, had allowed the ruin of His people, not because  He was powerless to preserve them, but because they had sinned against  His law. Lastly, he was anxious to emphasize the military virtue and the  magnanimity of his patrons Vespasian and Titus. He intersperses frequent  protests in various parts of the seven books, and repeats them in the  preface, to the effect that while his predecessors had written  \"sophistically,\" he was aiming only at the exact record of events. But  it is obvious that, in the _Wars_ as in his other works, he has a  definite purpose to serve, and he colors his account of events to suit  this purpose and to please his patrons.    He sets out to establish, in fact, that it was \"a sedition of our own  that destroyed Jerusalem, and that the tyrants among the Jews brought  upon us the Romans, who unwillingly attacked us, and occasioned the  burning of our Temple.\"[1] And he apologizes for the passion he shows  against the tyrants and Zealots, which, he admits, is not consistent  with the character of an historian; it was provoked because the  unparalleled calamities of the Jews were not caused by strangers but by  themselves, and \"this makes it impossible for me to contain my  lamentations.\"[2] The historian, therefore, in the work which has come  down to us, is dominated by the conviction, whether sincere or feigned,  that the war with Rome was a huge error, that those who fomented it were  wicked, self-seeking men, and that the Jews brought their ruin on  themselves. This being his temper, it is necessary to look very closely  at his representation of events and examine how far partisan feeling and  prejudices, and how far servility and the courtier spirit, have colored  it. We have also to consider how far his reflections represent his own  judgment, and how far they are the slavish adoption of opinions  expressed by the victorious enemies of his people.    [Footnote 1: B.J., Preface.]    [Footnote 2: B.J., Preface, 4.]    The alternative title of the work is _On the Destruction of the Temple_,  but its scope is larger than either name suggests. It is conjectured by  the German scholar Niese that the author called it _A History of the  Jewish State in Its Relations with the Romans_. It is in fact a history  of the Jews under the Romans, beginning, as Josephus says, \"where the  earlier writers on Jewish affairs and our prophets leave off.\" He  proposes to deal briefly with the events that preceded his own age, but  fully with the events of the wars of his time. The history starts,  accordingly, with the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, and, save that  he expatiates without any sense of proportion on the exploits of Herod  the Great, Josephus is generally faithful to his program in the  introductory portion of the work. For the Herodian period he found a  very full source, and the temptation was too powerful for him, so that  the greater part of the first book is taken up with the story of the  court intrigues and family murders of the king. Very brief indeed is his  treatment of the Maccabean brothers, and not very accurate. They are  dismissed in two chapters, and it is probable that the historian had not  before him either of the two good Jewish sources for the period, the  First and the Second Book of the Maccabees. In his later work, in which  he dealt with the same period at greater length, the account which he  had abstracted from a Greek source, probably Nicholas of Damascus, is  corrected by the Jewish work. The two records show a number of small  discrepancies. Thus, in the _Wars_ he states that Onias, the high priest  who drove out the Tobiades from Jerusalem, fled to Ptolemy in Egypt, and  founded a city resembling Jerusalem; whereas in the _Antiquities_ he  states that the Onias who fled to Egypt because Antiochus deprived him  of office was the son of the high priest. Again, in the _Wars_ he makes  Mattathias kill the Syrian governor Bacchides; whereas, in the  _Antiquities_, agreeing with the First Book of the Maccabees, he says  that the Syrian officer who was slain at Modin was Appelles.    Josephus in the _Wars_ follows his Hellenistic source for the history of  the Hasmonean monarchy without introducing any Jewish knowledge and  without criticism. His summary is of incidents, not of movements, and he  has a liking for romantic color. The piercing of the king's elephant by  the Maccabean Eleazar, the prediction by an Essene of the murder of  Antigonus, the brother of King Aristobulus I, are detailed. The inner  Jewish life is passed over in complete silence until he comes to the  reign of Alexander. Then he describes the Pharisees as a sect of Jews  that are held to be more religious than others and to interpret the laws  more accurately.[1] The description is clearly derived from a Greek  writer, who regards the Jewish people from the outside. It is quite out  of harmony with the standpoint which Josephus himself later adopts. In  this passage he presents the Pharisees as crafty politicians,  insinuating themselves into the favor of the queen, and then ordering  the country to suit their own ends. Without describing the other sects,  he continues the narration of intrigues and wars till he reaches the  intervention of Pompey in the affairs of Palestine.    [Footnote 1: B.J. I. v. 2.]    From this point the treatment is fuller. No doubt the Hellenistic  historians paid more attention to the Jews from the moment when they  came within the orbit of the Roman Empire; but while in the  _Antiquities_ Josephus refers several times to the statements of two or  three of the Greco-Roman writers, in the _Wars_ he quotes no authority.  From this it may be inferred that in the earlier work he is following  but one guide.    He gives an elaborate account of the rise of the Idumean family of  Antipater, and hence to the end of the book the history passes into a  biography of Herod. The first part of Herod's career, when he was  building up his power, is related in the most favorable light. His  activity in Galilee against the Zealots, his trial by the Sanhedrin, his  subsequent service to the Romans, his flight from Judea upon the  invasion of the Parthians, his reception by Antony, his triumphal return  to the kingdom that had been bestowed on him, his valiant exploits  against the Arabians of Perea and Nabatea, his capture of Jerusalem, his  splendid buildings, and his magnificence to foreigners--all these  incidents are set forth so as to enhance his greatness. The description  throughout has a Greek ring. There is scarcely a suggestion of a Jewish  point of view towards the semi-savage godless tyrant. And when Josephus  comes to the part of Herod's life which even an historian laureate could  not misrepresent to his credit, his family relations, he adopts a  fundamentally pagan outlook.    The foundation of the Greek drama was the idea that the fortunate  incurred the envy of the gods, and brought on themselves the \"nemesis,\"  the revenge, of the divine powers, which plunged them into ruin. This  conception, utterly opposed as it is to the Jewish doctrine of God's  goodness, is applied to Herod, on whom, says Josephus, fortune was  revenged for his external prosperity by raising him up domestic  troubles.[1] He introduces another pagan idea, when he suggests that  Antipater, the wicked son of the king, returned to Palestine, where he  was to meet his doom, at the instigation of the ghosts of his murdered  brothers, which stopped the mouths of those who would have warned him  against returning. The notion of the avenging spirits of the dead was  utterly opposed to Jewish teaching, but it was a commonplace of the  Hellenistic thought of the time.    [Footnote 1: B.J. I. xxii. 1.]    Of Hillel and Shammai, the great sages of the time, we have not a word;  but when he recounts how, in the last days of Herod, the people under  the lead of the Pharisees rose against the king in indignation at the  setting up of a golden eagle over the Temple gate, he speaks of the  sophists exhorting their followers, \"that it was a glorious thing to die"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9799"],[0,"It Happened in Egypt (#16)"],[1,"you are. Anyhow, they're prepared to believe it,  for you're a new broom--a broom with a fine handle. I'm only a poor  colonel with a few medals given by my country for services that were  appreciated. You're brother to a marquis.\"    \"You paint a lurid picture\" I said, when he stopped for breath.    \"I couldn't paint it lurider than it is. But you'll have to find out  for yourself. It won't be so bad while you're a novelty. Don't say I  haven't warned you. And oh, by the way, I've announced that you're to  be presented to the passengers at dinner to-night, on coming in, before  the soup is served.\"    \"As a sort of _hors d'oeuvre,_ I suppose,\" I murmured weakly.    Colonel Corkran stared, without a smile. \"As the titled conductor of  the Egypt tour,\" he explained to my dull intelligence, with a slight  sneer. \"So will you please be in the dining saloon just before the  bugle blows the beasts in? I have to introduce you, in a short speech.  It's all I can do, except say, God help you! But I don't see how He  can. I suppose your friend Sir Marcus told you that you would be  expected to deliver a lecture on Egypt, to-night at the dinner table?  After you've finished your dinner, of course. I hope the cracking and  crunching of nuts doesn't disturb you much? I confess I've found it  getting on my nerves.\"    I was aghast. My mind jumped to the wild thought of eating soap, in  order to froth at the mouth and simulate a fit. It seemed my only way  of escape, and after that, the Deluge. But my rival was so revelling in  the mental havoc he had wrought that I rallied, replying that, as Sir  Marcus had not broken the news to me, I didn't see how it would be  possible to deliver a lecture.    \"Aren't you up on Egypt?\" the colonel asked, pityingly. \"Neither am I,  though I've sweated over Baedeker with my head in wet towels, when I  wanted to be at bridge. But I thought that was the excuse for engaging  you? That, and your title, of course, which is going to make you  popular. As fast as I fag up the names of those beastly Egyptian gods  or kings and queens, they run out of my brains like water out of a  sieve. Or if I do contrive to remember any, by chance, together with  their dates, which is almost more than can be expected of the human  intellect, why, I find that I pronounce 'em wrong; or they're spelled  another way in the next book. But I suppose as you know Egypt, its d--d  history comes natural as breathing.\"    How I wished it did! And how different was this new programme from the  one outlined by Sir Marcus. Just to be genial, and flirt with the  girls. \"My recollections of Egypt are from some time ago,\" I admitted.  \"To give a lecture at half an hour's notice.----\"    \"In justice to yourself I'm afraid you'll have to,\" the colonel  persisted. \"It's been announced that you will give the lecture, and the  Egypt lot are looking forward to it as the animals in a zoo look  forward to their food. If they're defrauded, they'll think you a  slacker, and that you're presuming on your title.\"    \"I shouldn't like that!\" my anguish racked out of me.    \"I fancied you wouldn't. But what's to be done? Am I to announce, when  I introduce you, that your knowledge of Egypt isn't equal to the  strain?\"    I took an instant for reflection. I knew that he was hoping I might  throw myself on his mercy, or else that I would speak and fail; but I  determined to do neither. \"On second thoughts, I may be able to give  some kind of a pow-wow,\" I replied.    Colonel Corkran's face fell. \"That's all right, then!\" he exclaimed,  getting to his feet. \"Well, I must be off. Will you have a cocktail?\"    \"No, thanks,\" said I. \"I think I can get on without it.\"    He was at the door. \"Kind of hash of gods and goddesses with a  peppering of kings and queens, and mixed sauce of history and legend,  is what's needed,\" were his farewell words. Then he shut the door; and  I tore my watch from the pocket of my waistcoat. I had twenty-eight  minutes in which to prepare the said hash with its seasoning and sauce;  and the bugle was inviting my judges to dress for the inquisition.          CHAPTER VIII    FOXY DUFFING      \"I'll show you your place,\" Corkran volunteered, lying in wait for me  inside the saloon door, with a cocktail in his hand. \"Sorry you  wouldn't have one. You'll need it. But no time to change your mind.  I've put you at the head of the table that would be the captain's, if  he ate with us, which he doesn't--happy man! Place of honour. 'Twas  mine, 'tis yours. But I can't go on with the quotation unless I turn it  into 'You're slave to thousands.' Sixty odd can be as formidable as  thousands.\"    \"Are there sixty odd?\" I asked.    \"Yes, very 'odd.' The Egypt lot will be about twenty-five. But the  whole gang's yours for the present. I give them to you, with the seat  of honour.\"    \"Please don't put me in your place,\" I protested. \"I prefer------\"    \"My poor boy, it isn't a question of what you prefer, as you'll learn  if you stick this out. Of course if you funk it--but that's a joke!  This table's the only one where you can be heard. Do you see?\"    I did see; and accepted the situation, because the dinner bugle began  to sound, and I could not be scampering round the saloon like a  frightened rabbit as the Set and the Flock began dropping in to dinner.  As it happened, they did not drop--they poured into the room in a  steady stream, which phenomenon, whispered Corkran, was caused by  curiosity for a first sight of me. My heart counted each new arrival,  with a bump.    If Corkran had not represented \"Lark's Party\" as being a menagerie for  which I had inadvertently engaged as tamer, I should have thought they  looked a harmless crowd. But then, of course, I was not obliged to tame  anybody on the _Laconia,_ which makes a difference in one's point of  view. Miss Gilder needed taming, no doubt, but I hadn't tackled the  task. My thoughts flew to Cairo, as I stood struggling to look  pleasant; and I wished myself back where Anthony Fenton was now in the  taming business. I envied him, for there was only one Monny, whereas in  this terrible, bright dining saloon, the air was pink and white with  girls, dozens of girls, with eyes fixed on me, glittering eyes, which  appeared like the headlights of motor cars. I didn't suppose there  could be so many eyes in the world as these people of all ages and  every possible sex seemed to own. Sixty odd they were, according to  Corkran, but they looked like six hundred; a human miracle of loaves  and fishes.    Yes, the creatures might have appeared harmless enough had there been  no retired colonel. But there was a retired colonel, and so deftly had  he undermined my courage that almost any shock might cause it to  explode in a blue flame of funk. His speech of introduction was now to  come, and if I survived that, I might hope to live through my own  fireworks.    \"They've put on their best bibs and tuckers,\" Corkran mumbled in a  stage whisper, as the eight dwellers at our table began to sort  themselves for places. Then, in portentous silence he paused till  everybody everywhere was seated. Waiting still, until satisfied that  eyes and ears were focussed upon us, he rapped on the table with the  handle of a knife.    \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he roared, \"I have the pleasure of introducing  to you Sir Marcus Lark's Great Surprise, entitled Lord Ernest Borrow,  younger brother of the Marquis of Killeena, a peer, as Sir Marcus has  reminded us, of the oldest lineage in Ireland. Let me reassure you all  by saying that Lord Ernest's last name is as unsuited to his nature as  the first is true to it. If you'll pardon the pun it is Sir Marcus who  'Borrows' for your benefit, and he hasn't Borrowed Trouble, but a  Blessing--in disguise. I am now left free, as suits my superior age and  experience, to devote my attention to the serious minded ones among  you, who are to proceed with the Reverend Mr. Watts and myself to  Palestine. This young and gallant neophyte will 'lord' it over the  fleshpots of Egypt and those about to seek them. I hope you'll help him  as loyally as you have helped _me:_ and later we'll drink to his health  and success, in any beverage we happen to have signed for!\"    To have killed Corkran might have been butchery; no jury could have  brought in a verdict of murder or even manslaughter, had I stabbed him  with the knife he used to pound upon the table. I smiled the smile of a  skull in a doctor's waiting-room, and in a sickly voice bleated my  pleasure in meeting these new acquaintances. I hoped we might be--er  --friends as well as shipmates. Then like a mass of jelly out of its  mould I plopped onto my chair. The colonel had sneaked off to his own  table and I was left to recover myself as best I might among eight of  his enemies. They proved (in whispers) to be the most active of these,  and tacitly offered me allegiance which I accepted in the same manner.  There was a Sir John Biddell, who informed me in the first five minutes  that he had been Lord Mayor of London. He promised to show me a speech  he had made in the presence of King Edward which, in the form of a  newspaper cutting, he never travelled without. This, however, was his  first trip farther than Paris, and he had brought with him, not only  the speech, but his wife and twin daughters. The distinguished family  occupied one side of my table: the other was given up to a General  Harlow, his wife (both with high profiles and opinions of themselves),  a youngish newspaper proprietor from Manchester, evidently rich and a  \"catch,\" and a maiden lady doubtless of importance equal to her  proportions, as she was allowed to bring to the table a melancholy  marmoset. These people did their best to raise my spirits. The girls,  who copied royalties in their hair-dressing, looked alike, dressed  alike, talked and laughed alike, and entertained me with chat about  high society in London. They had red cheeks,"]]]
