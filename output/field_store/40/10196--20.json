God bless and keep you and the children.    Your most faithful v.B.    [Illustration: PRINCESS BISMARCK]      Frankfort, Ascension Day--Evening.    (Postmarked Berlin, June 1, '51.)    _My Heart_,--How good it is of you all that, directly after I had  mailed my complaint of lack of news, there arrives such a shower of  letters. A thousand thanks to your dear parents, and I shall answer  dad tomorrow, when I am less hurried than today, for on this dear  holiday, after a big dinner, I must still write some long despatches.  I was at the French church today, where at least there was more  congregation and devotion, and the minister was passable, too, but I  cannot talk French with my dear, faithful Lord and Saviour; it seems  to me ungrateful. For the rest, they sang pretty hymns, these insipid  Calvinists, almost in the sweet Catholic tune which you always  play. * * *    Your most faithful v.B.    Your letter had been opened again.      Frankfort, June 4, '51.    _My Darling_,--Were you not going to write to me any more? I was  resolved even yesterday not to put pen to paper until I should have a  letter from you, but, anyway, I will be good, and tell you that I am  well and love you, even if you let your little inkstand dry up. I long  exceedingly for you and the children, and for quiet, comfortable  domesticity at Schoenhausen or Reinfeld. As soon as I have finished my  hitherto rather unimportant occupations, my empty lodgings, and the  whole dreary world behind, face me, and I know not where to set my  foot, for there is nothing which particularly attracts me. Day before  yesterday I ate at Biberich, with the Duke of Nassau, the first fresh  herrings and the first strawberries and raspberries of the season. It  is certainly a delightful piece of earth along the Rhine, and I looked  pensively from the castle windows over to the red cathedral of  Mayence, which, almost four years ago, we both went to see very early  in the morning, in times for which we were not then sufficiently  grateful to God; I remembered how, on board the steamer, the blue  hills before us, we passed by the Duke's handsome castle, without  dreaming how and why I should stand there at the window this year, an  old wig of a Minister before me, who unravelled his views on national  polities, while I was thinking, with an occasional absent-minded  \"Quite so,\" of our trip of '47, and sought with my eyes the spot on  the Mayence bridge whence you, in your little Geneva coat, embarked on  the steamer; and then I thought of Geneva. * * * Countess Thun  unfortunately left on Sunday for Tetschen, to spend three months with  her father-in-law. She is a kindly lady, womanly and devout (Catholic,  very), attributes which do not grace the women here in general; her  husband gambles and flirts, I believe, more so than is agreeable to  her. I hardly believe that you will like her, but she is one of the  better specimens of women of the great world, even though that just  proves to me that a woman of that world would not have been suitable  for me; I like her to associate with, but not to marry. Perhaps, by  comparing her with the others of her sort, you will learn to  appreciate her. The gentlemen are unendurable. The moment I accost one  he assumes a diplomatic countenance, and thinks of what he can answer  without saying too much, and what he can write home concerning my  utterances. Those who are not so I find still less congenial; they  talk equivocally to the ladies, and the latter encourage them  shamefully. It makes a less morbid impression on me if a woman falls  thoroughly for once, but preserves a sense of shame at heart, than if  she takes pleasure in such chatter; and I value the Countess Thun,  because, despite the general fashion prevailing here, she knows how to  keep decidedly clear of all that sort of thing. * * * Your most  faithful v.B.      Frankfort, June 26, '51.    _My Darling_,--Today I have been suffering all day long from  homesickness. I received your letter of Sunday early, and then I sat  in the window and smelled the summer fragrance of roses and all sorts  of shrubs in the little garden, and while so doing I heard one of your  dear Beethoven pieces, played by an unknown hand on the piano, wafted  over from some window opposite, distantly and in snatches, and to me  it sounded prettier than any concert. I kept wondering why I must,  after all, be so far away, for a long time, from you and the children,  while so many people who do not love each other at all see one another  from morning till night. It is now seven months since I received at  Reinfeld the order to join the regiment; since then we have twice paid  each other a hasty visit, and it will be eight or nine months before  we shall be again united. It must, indeed, be the Lord's will, for I  have not sought it, and when I am sorrowful it is a consolation to me  that I did not speak a syllable in order to come here, and that  ambition for outward pomp was not what led me to this separation. We  are not in this world to be happy and to enjoy, but to do our duty;  and the less my condition is a self-made one, the more do I realize  that I am to perform the duties of the office in which I am placed.  And I certainly do not wish to be ungrateful, for I am, nevertheless,  happy in the knowledge of possessing so much that is dear, even if far  away from here, and in the hope of a happy reunion. On the arrival of  every letter from Reinfeld my first feeling is one of hearty gratitude  for the unmerited happiness that I still have you in this world, and  with every death of wife or child which I see in the newspaper the  consciousness of what I have to lose comes forcibly home to me, and of  what the merciful God has granted and thus far preserved to me. Would  that gratitude therefor might so dispose my obstinate and worldly  heart to receive the mercy of the Lord that it shall not be necessary  for Him to chastise me in what I love, for I have greater fear of that  than of any other evil. * * * In a few weeks it must be decided  whether I shall be made Envoy here or stay at Reinfeld. The Austrians  at Berlin are agitating against my appointment, because my  black-and-white is not sufficiently yellow for them; but I hardly  believe they will succeed, and you, my poor dear, will probably have  to jump into the cold water of diplomacy; and the boy, unlucky wight  that he is, will have a South-German accent added to his Berlin  nativity. * * * As far as can now be foreseen, I shall not be able to  get away from this galley for two or three weeks, for, including  Silesia, that amount of time would probably be necessary for it. But  much water will flow down the Main before then, and I am not worrying  before the time comes. How I should like to turn suddenly around the  bushy corner of the lawn and surprise all of you in the hall! I see  you so plainly, attending to the children, covering up Midget, with  sensible speeches, and father sitting at his desk smoking, the mayor  beside him, and mammy bolt-upright on her sofa, by wretched light, one  hand lying on the arm-rest, or holding _Musee Francais_ close before  her eyes. God grant that at this moment everything at Reinfeld is  going as smoothly as this. I have at last received a letter from Hans,  one that is very charming, and, contrary to his custom, mysterious, in  view of the post-office spies. You may imagine how Senfft writes to me  under these circumstances. I received an unsigned letter from him the  other day, out of which the most quick-witted letter-bandit would have  been at a loss to decipher what he was driving at. If you occasionally  come across some unintelligible notices at the tail end of the  _Observer_, they will thus seem to you more puzzling still, and to the  blockhead who breaks open this letter they will remain unintelligible,  even if I tell you that they are a part of my correspondence. Only  give me frequent tidings, my beloved heart, even if short ones, so  that I may have the assurance that you are alive and well. A have  picked the enclosed leaves for you in the garden of old Amschel  Rothschild, whom I like, because he is simply a haggling Jew, and does  not pretend to be anything else, and, at the same time, a strictly  orthodox Jew, who touches nothing at his dinners, and eats only  \"undefiled\" food. \"Johann dage vid you some bread for de deers,\" he  said his servant as he came out to show me his garden, in which there  were some tame fallow deer. \"Baron, dat blant costs me two thousand  guilders, honor bride, two thousand guilders gash; I vill let you have  it for one thousand or, if you vant it for nuddings, he shall bring id  to your house. God knows I abbrejiate you highly, Baron; you are a  nize man, a brave man.\" With that he is a little, thin gray imp of a  man, the patriarch of his tribe, but a poor man in his palace,  childless, a widower, cheated by his servants, and ill-treated by  aristocratically Frenchified and Anglicized nephews and nieces who  will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13058"],[0,"The Teeth of the Tiger (#17)"],[1,"' Leap.\"  And the answer:    \"Yes, but the body was never found. And, as it happens, we know that a  steamer picked up a man who was making signals to her and that this  steamer was on her way to Algiers. Well, a few days later, Don Luis  Perenna enlisted in the Foreign Legion at Sidi-bel-Abbes.\"    Of course, the controversy upon which the newspapers embarked on this  subject was carried on discreetly. Everybody was afraid of Lupin; and the  journalists maintained a certain reserve in their articles, confined  themselves to comparing dates and pointing out coincidences, and  refrained from speaking too positively of any Lupin that might lie hidden  under the mask of Perenna.    But, as regards the private in the Foreign Legion and his stay in  Morocco, they took their revenge and let themselves go freely.    Major d'Astrignac had spoken. Other officers, other comrades of  Perenna's, related what they had seen. The reports and daily orders  concerning him were published. And what became known as \"The Hero's  Idyll\" began to take the form of a sort of record each page of which  described the maddest and unlikeliest of facts.    At Mediouna, on the twenty-fourth of March, the adjutant, Captain Pollex,  awarded Private Perenna four days' cells on a charge of having broken out  of camp past two sentries after evening roll call, contrary to orders,  and being absent without leave until noon on the following day. Perenna,  the report went on to say, brought back the body of his sergeant, killed  in ambush. And in the margin was this note, in the colonel's hand:    \"The colonel commanding doubles Private Perenna's award, but mentions his  name in orders and congratulates and thanks him.\"    After the fight of Ber-Rechid, Lieutenant Fardet's detachment being  obliged to retreat before a band of four hundred Moors, Private Perenna  asked leave to cover the retreat by installing himself in a _kasbah_.    \"How many men do you want, Perenna?\"    \"None, sir.\"    \"What! Surely you don't propose to cover a retreat all by yourself?\"    \"What pleasure would there be in dying, sir, if others were to die as  well as I?\"    At his request, they left him a dozen rifles, and divided with him the  cartridges that remained. His share came to seventy-five.    The detachment got away without being further molested. Next day, when  they were able to return with reinforcements, they surprised the Moors  lying in wait around the _kasbah_, but afraid to approach. The ground was  covered with seventy-five of their killed.    Our men drove them off. They found Private Perenna stretched on the floor  of the _kasbah_. They thought him dead. He was asleep!    He had not a single cartridge left. But each of his seventy-five bullets  had gone home.    What struck the imagination of the public most, however, was Major Comte  d'Astrignac's story of the battle of Dar-Dbibarh. The major confessed  that this battle, which relieved Fez at the moment when we thought that  all was lost and which created such a sensation in France, was won before  it was fought and that it was won by Perenna, alone!    At daybreak, when the Moorish tribes were preparing for the attack,  Private Perenna lassoed an Arab horse that was galloping across the  plain, sprang on the animal, which had no saddle, bridle, nor any sort of  harness, and without jacket, cap, or arms, with his white shirt bulging  out and a cigarette between his teeth, charged, with his hands in his  trousers-pockets!    He charged straight toward the enemy, galloped through their camp, riding  in and out among the tents, and then left it by the same place by which  he had gone in.    This quite inconceivable death ride spread such consternation among the  Moors that their attack was half-hearted and the battle was won without  resistance.    This, together with numberless other feats of bravado, went to make up  the heroic legend of Perenna. It threw into relief the superhuman energy,  the marvellous recklessness, the bewildering fancy, the spirit of  adventure, the physical dexterity, and the coolness of a singularly  mysterious individual whom it was impossible not to take for Arsene  Lupin, but a new and greater Arsene Lupin, dignified, idealized, and  ennobled by his exploits.    One morning, a fortnight after the double murder in the Boulevard  Suchet, this extraordinary man, who aroused such eager interest and who  was spoken of on every side as a fabulous and more or less impossible  being: one morning, Don Luis Perenna dressed himself and went the rounds  of his house.    It was a comfortable and roomy eighteenth-century mansion, situated at  the entrance to the Faubourg Saint-Germain, on the little Place du  Palais-Bourbon. He had bought it, furnished, from a rich Hungarian, Count  Malonyi, keeping for his own use the horses, carriages, motor cars, and  taking over the eight servants and even the count's secretary, Mlle.  Levasseur, who undertook to manage the household and to receive and get  rid of the visitors--journalists, bores and curiosity-dealers--attracted  by the luxury of the house and the reputation of its new owner.    After finishing his inspection of the stables and garage, he walked  across the courtyard and went up to his study, pushed open one of the  windows and raised his head. Above him was a slanting mirror; and this  mirror reflected, beyond the courtyard and its surrounding wall, one  whole side of the Place du Palais-Bourbon.    \"Bother!\" he said. \"Those confounded detectives are still there. And this  has been going on for a fortnight. I'm getting tired of this spying.\"    He sat down, in a bad temper, to look through his letters, tearing up,  after he had read them, those which concerned him personally and making  notes on the others, such as applications for assistance and requests for  interviews. When he had finished, he rang the bell.    \"Ask Mlle. Levasseur to bring me the newspapers.\"    She had been the Hungarian count's reader as well as his secretary; and  Perenna had trained her to pick out in the newspapers anything that  referred to him, and to give him each morning an exact account of the  proceedings that were being taken against Mme. Fauville.    Always dressed in black, with a very elegant and graceful figure, she had  attracted him from the first. She had an air of great dignity and a grave  and thoughtful face which made it impossible to penetrate the secret of  her soul, and which would have seemed austere had it not been framed in a  cloud of fair curls, resisting all attempts at discipline and setting a  halo of light and gayety around her.    Her voice had a soft and musical tone which Perenna loved to hear; and,  himself a little perplexed by Mlle. Levasseur's attitude of reserve, he  wondered what she could think of him, of his mode of life, and of all  that the newspapers had to tell of his mysterious past.    \"Nothing new?\" he asked, as he glanced at the headings of the articles.    She read the reports relating to Mme. Fauville; and Don Luis could see  that the police investigations were making no headway. Marie Fauville  still kept to her first method, that of weeping, making a show of  indignation, and assuming entire ignorance of the facts upon which she  was being examined.    \"It's ridiculous,\" he said, aloud. \"I have never seen any one defend  herself so clumsily.\"    \"Still, if she's innocent?\"    It was the first time that Mlle. Levasseur had uttered an opinion or  rather a remark upon the case. Don Luis looked at her in great surprise.    \"So you think her innocent, Mademoiselle?\"    She seemed ready to reply and to explain the meaning of her  interruption. It was as though she were removing her impassive mask and  about to allow her face to adopt a more animated expression under the  impulse of her inner feelings. But she restrained herself with a visible  effort, and murmured:    \"I don't know. I have no views.\"    \"Possibly,\" he said, watching her with curiosity, \"but you have a doubt:  a doubt which would be permissible if it were not for the marks left by  Mme. Fauville's own teeth. Those marks, you see, are something more than  a signature, more than a confession of guilt. And, as long as she is  unable to give a satisfactory explanation of this point--\"    But Marie Fauville vouchsafed not the slightest explanation of this or of  anything else. She remained impenetrable. On the other hand, the police  failed to discover her accomplice or accomplices, or the man with the  ebony walking-stick and the tortoise-shell glasses whom the waiter at the  Cafe du Pont-Neuf had described to Mazeroux and who seemed to have played  a singularly suspicious part. In short, there was not a ray of light  thrown upon the subject.    Equally vain was all search for the traces of Victor, the Roussel  sister's first cousin, who would have inherited the Mornington bequest in  the absence of any direct heirs.    \"Is that all?\" asked Perenna.    \"No,\" said Mlle. Levasseur, \"there is an article in the _Echo de  France_--\"    \"Relating to me?\"    \"I presume so, Monsieur. It is called, 'Why Don't They Arrest Him?'\"    \"That concerns me,\" he said, with a laugh.    He took the newspaper and read:    \"Why do they not arrest him? Why go against logic and prolong an  unnatural situation which no decent man can understand? This is the  question which everybody is asking and to which our investigations enable  us to furnish a precise reply.    \"Two years ago, in other words, three years after the pretended death of  Arsene Lupin, the police, having discovered or believing they had  discovered that Arsene Lupin was really none other than one Floriani,  born at Blois and since lost to sight, caused the register to be  inscribed, on the page relating to this Floriani, with the word  'Deceased,' followed by the words 'Under the alias of Arsene Lupin.'    \"Consequently, to bring Arsene Lupin back to life, there would be wanted  something more than the undeniable "]]]
