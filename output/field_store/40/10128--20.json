Thus the officials of the  provinces were originally army officers but now, in the reorganization  of the whole realm, the distinction between civil and military  administration was abolished. At the head of the province were a civil  and also a military governor, and both were supervised by a controller  directly responsible to the emperor. Since there was naturally a  continual struggle for power between these three officials, none of them  was supreme and none could develop into a sort of feudal lord. In this  system we can see the essence of the later Chinese administration.    [Illustration: 3 Bronze plaque representing two horses fighting each  other. Ordos region, animal style. _From V. Griessmaier: Sammlung Baron  Eduard von der Heydt, Vienna_ 1936, _illustration No_. 6.]    [Illustration: 4 Hunting scene: detail from the reliefs in the tombs at  Wu-liang-tz'u. _From a print in the author's possession_.]    [Illustration: 5 Part of the 'Great Wall'. _Photo Eberhard_.]    Owing to the centuries of division into independent feudal states, the  various parts of the country had developed differently. Each province  spoke a different dialect which also contained many words borrowed from  the language of the indigenous population; and as these earlier  populations sometimes belonged to different races with different  languages, in each state different words had found their way into the  Chinese dialects. This caused divergences not only in the spoken but in  the written language, and even in the characters in use for writing.  There exist to this day dictionaries in which the borrowed words of that  time are indicated, and keys to the various old forms of writing also  exist. Thus difficulties arose if, for instance, a man from the old  territory of Ch'in was to be transferred as an official to the east: he  could not properly understand the language and could not read the  borrowed words, if he could read at all! For a large number of the  officials of that time, especially the officers who became military  governors, were certainly unable to read. The government therefore  ordered that the language of the whole country should be unified, and  that a definite style of writing should be generally adopted. The words  to be used were set out in lists, so that the first lexicography came  into existence simply through the needs of practical administration, as  had happened much earlier in Babylon. Thus, the few recently found  manuscripts from pre-Ch'in times still contain a high percentage of  Chinese characters which we cannot read because they were local  characters; but all words in texts after the Ch'in time can be read  because they belong to the standardized script. We know now that all  classical texts of pre-Ch'in time as we have them today, have been  re-written in this standardized script in the second century B.C.: we do  not know which words they actually contained at the time when they were  composed, nor how these words were actually pronounced, a fact which  makes the reconstruction of Chinese language before Ch'in very  difficult.    The next requirement for the carrying on of the administration was the  unification of weights and measures and, a surprising thing to us, of  the gauge of the tracks for wagons. In the various feudal states there  had been different weights and measures in use, and this had led to  great difficulties in the centralization of the collection of taxes. The  centre of administration, that is to say the new capital of Ch'in, had  grown through the transfer of nobles and through the enormous size of  the administrative staff into a thickly populated city with very large  requirements of food. The fields of the former state of Ch'in alone  could not feed the city; and the grain supplied in payment of taxation  had to be brought in from far around, partly by cart. The only roads  then existing consisted of deep cart-tracks. If the axles were not of  the same length for all carts, the roads were simply unusable for many  of them. Accordingly a fixed length was laid down for axles. The  advocates of all these reforms were also their beneficiaries, the  merchants.    The first principle of the Legalist school, a principle which had been  applied in Ch'in and which was to be extended to the whole realm, was  that of the training of the population in discipline and obedience, so  that it should become a convenient tool in the hands of the officials.  This requirement was best met by a people composed as far as possible  only of industrious, uneducated, and tax-paying peasants. Scholars and  philosophers were not wanted, in so far as they were not directly  engaged in work commissioned by the state. The Confucianist writings  came under special attack because they kept alive the memory of the old  feudal conditions, preaching the ethic of the old feudal class which had  just been destroyed and must not be allowed to rise again if the state  was not to suffer fresh dissolution or if the central administration was  not to be weakened. In 213 B.C. there took place the great holocaust of  books which destroyed the Confucianist writings with the exception of  one copy of each work for the State Library. Books on practical subjects  were not affected. In the fighting at the end of the Ch'in dynasty the  State Library was burnt down, so that many of the old works have only  come down to us in an imperfect state and with doubtful accuracy. The  real loss arose, however, from the fact that the new generation was  little interested in the Confucianist literature, so that when, fifty  years later, the effort was made to restore some texts from the oral  tradition, there no longer existed any scholars who really knew them by  heart, as had been customary in the past.    In 221 B.C. Shih Huang-ti had become emperor of all China. The judgments  passed on him vary greatly: the official Chinese historiography rejects  him entirely--naturally, for he tried to exterminate Confucianism, while  every later historian was himself a Confucian. Western scholars often  treat him as one of the greatest men in world history. Closer research  has shown that Shih Huang-ti was evidently an average man without any  great gifts, that he was superstitious, and shared the tendency of his  time to mystical and shamanistic notions. His own opinion was that he  was the first of a series of ten thousand emperors of his dynasty (Shih  Huang-ti means \"First Emperor\"), and this merely suggests megalomania.  The basic principles of his administration had been laid down long  before his time by the philosophers of the Legalist school, and were  given effect by his Chancellor Li Ss[)u]. Li Ss[)u] was the really great  personality of that period. The Legalists taught that the ruler must do  as little as possible himself. His Ministers were there to act for him.  He himself was to be regarded as a symbol of Heaven. In that capacity  Shih Huang-ti undertook periodical journeys into the various parts of  the empire, less for any practical purpose of inspection than for  purposes of public worship. They corresponded to the course of the sun,  and this indicates that Shih Huang-ti had adopted a notion derived from  the older northern culture of the nomad peoples.    He planned the capital in an ambitious style but, although there was  real need for extension of the city, his plans can scarcely be regarded  as of great service. His enormous palace, and also his mausoleum which  was built for him before his death, were constructed in accordance with  astral notions. Within the palace the emperor continually changed his  residential quarters, probably not only from fear of assassination but  also for astral reasons. His mausoleum formed a hemispherical dome, and  all the stars of the sky were painted on its interior.    3 _Frontier defence. Internal collapse_    When the empire had been unified by the destruction of the feudal  states, the central government became responsible for the protection of  the frontiers from attack from without. In the south there were only  peoples in a very low state of civilization, who could offer no serious  menace to the Chinese. The trading colonies that gradually extended to  Canton and still farther south served as Chinese administrative centres  for provinces and prefectures, with small but adequate armies of their  own, so that in case of need they could defend themselves. In the north  the position was much more difficult. In addition to their conquest  within China, the rulers of Ch'in had pushed their frontier far to the  north. The nomad tribes had been pressed back and deprived of their best  pasturage, namely the Ordos region. When the livelihood of nomad peoples  is affected, when they are threatened with starvation, their tribes  often collect round a tribal leader who promises new pasturage and  better conditions of life for all who take part in the common campaigns.  In this way the first great union of tribes in the north of China came  into existence in this period, forming the realm of the Hsiung-nu under  their first leader, T'ou-man. This first realm of the Hsiung-nu was not  yet extensive, but its ambitious and warlike attitude made it a danger  to Ch'in. It was therefore decided to maintain a large permanent army in  the north. In addition to this, the frontier walls already existing in  the mountains were rebuilt and made into a single great system. Thus  came into existence in 214 B.C., out of the blood and sweat of countless  pressed labourers, the famous Great Wall.    On one of his periodical journeys the emperor fell ill and died. His  death was the signal for the rising of many rebellious elements. Nobles  rose in order to regain power and influence; generals rose because they  objected to the permanent pressure from the central administration and  their supervision by controllers; men of the people rose as popular"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11385"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 446, July 19, 1884 (#17)"],[1,"head downward for days at a time, with their face  uncongested and their voice clear, counting their beads and mumbling  prayers.    One of the most remarkable peculiarities of fakirs is the faculty that  certain of them possess of remaining entirely buried in vaults and  boxes, and inclosed in bags, etc., for weeks and months, and, although  there is a certain deceit as regards the length of their absolute  abstinence, it nevertheless seems to be a demonstrated fact that, after  undergoing a peculiar treatment, they became plunged into a sort of  lethargy that allows them to remain for several days or weeks without  taking food. Certain fakirs that have been interred under such  conditions have, it appears, passed ten months or a year in their grave.    _Tortured Fakirs_.--Fakirs that submit themselves to tortures are very  numerous. Some of them perform exercises analogous to those of the  Aissaoua. Mr. Rousselet, in his voyage to the Indies, had an opportunity  of seeing some of these at Bhopal, and the following is the picturesque  description that he gives of them: \"I remarked some groups of religious  mendicants of a frightfully sinister character. They were Jogins, who,  stark naked and with dishevelled hair, were walking about, shouting, and  dancing a sort of weird dance. In the midst of their contortions they  brandished long, sharp poniards, of a special form, provided with steel  chains. From time to time, one of these hallucinated creatures would  drive the poniard into his body (principally into the sides of his  chest), into his arms, and into his legs, and would only desist when, in  order to calm his apparent fury, the idlers who were surrounding him  threw a sufficient number of pennies to him.\"    At the time of the feast of the Juggernaut one sees, or rather one _did_  see before the English somewhat humanized this ceremony, certain fakirs  suspended by their flesh from iron hooks placed along the sides of the  god's car. Others had their priests insert under their shoulder blades  two hooks, that were afterward fixed to a long pole capable of pivoting  upon a post. The fakirs were thus raised about thirty feet above ground,  and while being made to spin around very rapidly, smilingly threw  flowers to the faithful. Others, again, rolled over mattresses garnished  with nails, lance-points, poniards, and sabers, and naturally got up  bathed in blood. A large number cause 120 gashes (the sacred number) to  be made in their back and breast in honor of their god. Some pierce  their tongue with a long and narrow poniard, and remain thus exposed to  the admiration of the faithful. Finally, many of them are content to  pass points of iron or rods made of reed through folds in their skin. It  will be seen from this that fakirs are ingenious in their modes of  exciting the compassion and charity of the faithful.    Elsewhere, among a large number of savage tribes and half-civilized  peoples, we find aspirants to the priesthood of the fetiches undergoing,  under the direction of the members of the religious caste that they  desired to enter, ordeals that are extremely painful. Now, it has been  remarked for a long time that, among the neophytes, although all are  prepared by the same hands, some undergo these ordeals without  manifesting any suffering, while others cannot stand the pain, and so  run away with fright. It has been concluded from this that the object of  such ordeals is to permit the caste to make a selection from among their  recruits, and that, too, by means of anesthetics administered to the  chosen neophytes.    In France, during the last two centuries, when torturing the accused was  in vogue, some individuals were found to be insensible to the most  fearful tortures, and some even, who were plunged into a species of  somnolence or stupefaction, slept in the hands of the executioner.    What are the processes that permit of such results being reached?  Evidently, we cannot know them all. A certain number are caste, sect, or  family secrets. Many are known, however, at least in a general way. The  processes naturally vary, according to the object to be attained. Some  seem to consist only in an effort of the will. Thus, those fakirs who  remain immovable have no need of any special preparation to reach such a  result, and the same is the case with those who are interred up to the  neck, the will alone sufficing. Fakirs probably pass through the same  phases that invalids do who are forced to keep perfectly quiet through a  fracture or dislocation. During the first days the organism revolts  against such inaction, the constraint is great, the muscles contract by  starts, and then the patient gets used to it; the constraint becomes  less and less, the revolt of the muscles becomes less frequent, and the  patient becomes reconciled to his immobility. It is probable that after  passing several months or years in a state of immobility fakirs no  longer experience any desire to change their position, and even did they  so desire, it would be impossible owing to the atrophy of their muscles  and the anchylosis of their joints.    Those fakirs who remain with one or several limbs immovable and in an  abnormal position have to undergo a sort of preparation, a special  treatment; they have to enter and remain two or three mouths in a sort  of cage or frame of bamboo, the object of which is to keep the limb that  is to be immobilized in the position that it is to preserve. This  treatment, which is identical with the one employed by surgeons for  curing affections of the joints, has the effect of soldering or  anchylosing the articulation. When such a result is reached, the fakir  remains, in spite of himself and without fatigue, with outstretched  arms, and, in order to cause them to drop, he would have to undergo a  surgical operation.    As for those voluntary tortures that cause an effusion of blood, the  insensibility of those who are the victims of it is explainable when we  reflect that _India_ is _the_ country _par excellence_ of anaesthetic  plants. It produces, notably, Indian hemp and poppy, the first of which  yields hashish and the other opium. Now it is owing to these two  narcotics, taken in a proper dose, either alone or combined according to  a formula known to Hindoo fakirs and jugglers, but ignored by the lower  class, that the former are able to become absolutely insensible  themselves or make their adepts so.    [Illustration: INDIAN FAKIRS IN VARIOUS POSITIONS.]    There is, especially, a liquor known in the Indian pharmacopoeia under  the name of _bang_, that produces an exciting intoxication accompanied  with complete insensibility. Now the active part of bang consists of a  mixture of opium and hashish. It was an analogous liquor that the  Brahmins made Indian widows take before leading them to the funeral  pile. This liquor removed from the victims not only all consciousness of  the act that they were accomplishing, but also rendered them insensible  to the flames. Moreover, the dose of the anaesthetic was such that if, by  accident, the widow had escaped from the pile (something that more than  once happened, thanks to English protection), she would have died  through poisoning. Some travelers in Africa speak of an herb called  _rasch_, which is the base of anaesthetic preparations employed by  certain Arabian jugglers and sorcerers.    It was hashish that the Old Man of the Mountain, the chief of the sect  of Assassins, had recourse to for intoxicating his adepts, and it was,  it is thought, by the use of a virulent solanaceous plant--henbane,  thornapple, or belladonna--that he succeeded in rendering them  insensible. We have unfortunately lost the recipe for certain  anaesthetics that were known in ancient times, some of which, such as the  _Memphis stone_, appear to have been used in surgical operations. We are  also ignorant of what the wine of myrrh was that is spoken of in the  Bible.    We are likewise ignorant of the composition of the anaesthetic soap, the  use of which became so general in the 15th and 16th centuries that,  according to Taboureau, it was difficult to torture persons who were  accused. The stupefying recipe was known to all jailers, who, for a  consideration, communicated it to prisoners. It was this use of  anaesthetics that gave rise to the rule of jurisprudence according to  which partial or general insensibility was regarded as a certain sign of  sorcery. We may cite a certain number of preparations, which vary  according to the country, and to which is attributed the properly of  giving courage and rendering persons insensible to wounds inflicted by  the enemy. In most cases alcohol forms the base of such beverages,  although the _maslach_ that Turkish soldiers drink just before a battle  contains none of it, on account of a religious precept. It consists of  different plant-juices, and contains, especially, a little opium.  Cossacks and Tartars, just before battle, take a fermented beverage in  which has been infused a species of toadstool (_Agaricus muscarius_),  and which renders them courageous to a high degree.    As well known, the old soldiers of the First Empire taught the young  conscripts that in order to have courage and not feel the blows of the  enemy, it was only necessary to drink a glass of brandy into which  gunpowder had been poured.--_La Nature_.           *       *       *       *       *    [SCHOOL OF MINES QUARTERLY.]          THE DEPOSITION OF ORES.
