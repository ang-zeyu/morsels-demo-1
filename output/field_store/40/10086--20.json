There, whence at thy lady's hest  The Mantuan mov'd him, still was I debarr'd  This council, till the sun had made complete,  Four thousand and three hundred rounds and twice,  His annual journey; and, through every light  In his broad pathway, saw I him return,  Thousand save sev'nty times, the whilst I dwelt  Upon the earth.  The language I did use  Was worn away, or ever Nimrod's race  Their unaccomplishable work began.  For naught, that man inclines to, ere was lasting,  Left by his reason free, and variable,  As is the sky that sways him.  That he speaks,  Is nature's prompting: whether thus or thus,  She leaves to you, as ye do most affect it.  Ere I descended into hell's abyss,  El was the name on earth of the Chief Good,  Whose joy enfolds me: Eli then 't was call'd  And so beseemeth: for, in mortals, use  Is as the leaf upon the bough; that goes,  And other comes instead.  Upon the mount  Most high above the waters, all my life,  Both innocent and guilty, did but reach  From the first hour, to that which cometh next  (As the sun changes quarter), to the sixth.\"          CANTO XXVII    Then  \"Glory to the Father, to the Son,  And to the Holy Spirit,\" rang aloud  Throughout all Paradise, that with the song  My spirit reel'd, so passing sweet the strain:  And what I saw was equal ecstasy;  One universal smile it seem'd of all things,  Joy past compare, gladness unutterable,  Imperishable life of peace and love,  Exhaustless riches and unmeasur'd bliss.    Before mine eyes stood the four torches lit;  And that, which first had come, began to wax  In brightness, and in semblance such became,  As Jove might be, if he and Mars were birds,  And interchang'd their plumes.  Silence ensued,  Through the blest quire, by Him, who here appoints  Vicissitude of ministry, enjoin'd;  When thus I heard: \"Wonder not, if my hue  Be chang'd; for, while I speak, these shalt thou see  All in like manner change with me.  My place  He who usurps on earth (my place, ay, mine,  Which in the presence of the Son of God  Is void), the same hath made my cemetery  A common sewer of puddle and of blood:  The more below his triumph, who from hence  Malignant fell.\"  Such colour, as the sun,  At eve or morning, paints an adverse cloud,  Then saw I sprinkled over all the sky.  And as th' unblemish'd dame, who in herself  Secure of censure, yet at bare report  Of other's failing, shrinks with maiden fear;  So Beatrice in her semblance chang'd:  And such eclipse in heav'n methinks was seen,  When the Most Holy suffer'd.  Then the words  Proceeded, with voice, alter'd from itself  So clean, the semblance did not alter more.  \"Not to this end was Christ's spouse with my blood,  With that of Linus, and of Cletus fed:  That she might serve for purchase of base gold:  But for the purchase of this happy life  Did Sextus, Pius, and Callixtus bleed,  And Urban, they, whose doom was not without  Much weeping seal'd.  No purpose was of our  That on the right hand of our successors  Part of the Christian people should be set,  And part upon their left; nor that the keys,  Which were vouchsaf'd me, should for ensign serve  Unto the banners, that do levy war  On the baptiz'd: nor I, for sigil-mark  Set upon sold and lying privileges;  Which makes me oft to bicker and turn red.  In shepherd's clothing greedy wolves below  Range wide o'er all the pastures.  Arm of God!  Why longer sleepst thou?  Caorsines and Gascona  Prepare to quaff our blood.  O good beginning  To what a vile conclusion must thou stoop!  But the high providence, which did defend  Through Scipio the world's glory unto Rome,  Will not delay its succour: and thou, son,  Who through thy mortal weight shall yet again  Return below, open thy lips, nor hide  What is by me not hidden.\"  As a Hood  Of frozen vapours streams adown the air,  What time the she-goat with her skiey horn  Touches the sun; so saw I there stream wide  The vapours, who with us had linger'd late  And with glad triumph deck th' ethereal cope.  Onward my sight their semblances pursued;  So far pursued, as till the space between  From its reach sever'd them: whereat the guide  Celestial, marking me no more intent  On upward gazing, said, \"Look down and see  What circuit thou hast compass'd.\"  From the hour  When I before had cast my view beneath,  All the first region overpast I saw,  Which from the midmost to the bound'ry winds;  That onward thence from Gades I beheld  The unwise passage of Laertes' son,  And hitherward the shore, where thou, Europa!  Mad'st thee a joyful burden: and yet more  Of this dim spot had seen, but that the sun,  A constellation off and more, had ta'en  His progress in the zodiac underneath.    Then by the spirit, that doth never leave  Its amorous dalliance with my lady's looks,  Back with redoubled ardour were mine eyes  Led unto her: and from her radiant smiles,  Whenas I turn'd me, pleasure so divine  Did lighten on me, that whatever bait  Or art or nature in the human flesh,  Or in its limn'd resemblance, can combine  Through greedy eyes to take the soul withal,  Were to her beauty nothing.  Its boon influence  From the fair nest of Leda rapt me forth,  And wafted on into the swiftest heav'n.    What place for entrance Beatrice chose,  I may not say, so uniform was all,  Liveliest and loftiest.  She my secret wish  Divin'd; and with such gladness, that God's love  Seem'd from her visage shining, thus began:  \"Here is the goal, whence motion on his race  Starts; motionless the centre, and the rest  All mov'd around.  Except the soul divine,  Place in this heav'n is none, the soul divine,  Wherein the love, which ruleth o'er its orb,  Is kindled, and the virtue that it sheds;  One circle, light and love, enclasping it,  As this doth clasp the others; and to Him,  Who draws the bound, its limit only known.  Measur'd itself by none, it doth divide  Motion to all, counted unto them forth,  As by the fifth or half ye count forth ten.  The vase, wherein time's roots are plung'd, thou seest,  Look elsewhere for the leaves.  O mortal lust!  That canst not lift thy head above the waves  Which whelm and sink thee down!  The will in man  Bears goodly blossoms; but its ruddy promise  Is, by the dripping of perpetual rain,  Made mere abortion: faith and innocence  Are met with but in babes, each taking leave  Ere cheeks with down are sprinkled; he, that fasts,  While yet a stammerer, with his tongue let loose  Gluts every food alike in every moon.  One yet a babbler, loves and listens to  His mother; but no sooner hath free use  Of speech, than he doth wish her in her grave.  So suddenly doth the fair child of him,  Whose welcome is the morn and eve his parting,  To negro blackness change her virgin white.    \"Thou, to abate thy wonder, note that none  Bears rule in earth, and its frail family  Are therefore wand'rers.  Yet before the date,  When through the hundredth in his reck'ning drops  Pale January must be shor'd aside  From winter's calendar, these heav'nly spheres  Shall roar so loud, that fortune shall be fain  To turn the poop, where she hath now the prow;  So that the fleet run onward; and true fruit,  Expected long, shall crown at last the bloom!\"          CANTO XXVII    So she who doth imparadise my soul,  Had drawn the veil from off our pleasant life,  And bar'd the truth of poor mortality;  When lo! as one who, in a mirror, spies  The shining of a flambeau at his back,  Lit sudden ore he deem of its approach,  And turneth to resolve him, if the glass  Have told him true, and sees the record faithful  As note is to its metre; even thus,  I well remember, did befall to me,  Looking upon the beauteous eyes, whence love  Had made the leash to take me.  As I turn'd;  And that, which, in their circles, none who spies,  Can miss of, in itself apparent, struck  On mine; a point I saw, that darted light  So sharp, no lid, unclosing, may bear up  Against its keenness.  The least star we view  From hence, had seem'd a moon, set by its side,  As star by side of star.  And so far off,  Perchance, as is the halo from the light  Which paints it, when most dense the vapour spreads,  There wheel'd about the point a circle of fire,  More rapid than the motion, which first girds  The world.  Then, circle after circle, round  Enring'd each other; till the seventh reach'd  Circumference so ample, that its bow,  Within the span of Juno's messenger,  lied scarce been held entire. Beyond the sev'nth,  Follow'd yet other two.  And every one,  As more in number distant from the first,  Was tardier in motion; and that glow'd  With flame most pure, that to the sparkle' of truth  Was nearest, as partaking most, methinks,  Of its reality.  The guide belov'd  Saw me in anxious thought suspense, and spake:  \"Heav'n, and all nature, hangs upon that point.  The circle thereto most conjoin'd observe;  And know, that by intenser love its course  Is to this swiftness wing'd.\"  To whom I thus:  \"It were enough; nor should I further seek,  Had I but witness'd order, in the world  Appointed, such as in these wheels is seen.  But in the sensible world such diff'rence is,  That is each round shows more divinity,  As each is wider from the centre.  Hence,  If in this wondrous and angelic temple,  That hath for confine only light and love,  My wish may have completion I must know,  Wherefore such disagreement is between  Th' exemplar and its copy: for myself,  Contemplating, I fail to pierce the cause.\"    \"It is no marvel, if thy fingers foil'd  Do leave the knot untied: so hard 't is grown  For want of tenting.\"  Thus she said: \"But take,\"  She added, \"if thou wish thy cure, my words,  And entertain them subtly.  Every orb  Corporeal, doth proportion its extent  Unto the virtue through its parts diffus'd.  The greater blessedness preserves the more.  The greater is the body (if all parts  Share equally) the more is to preserve."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1008"],[0,"Divine Comedy, Cary's Translation, Complete (#17)"],[1," and still'd its light  To speak no more, and now pass'd on with leave  From the mild poet gain'd, when following came  Another, from whose top a sound confus'd,  Forth issuing, drew our eyes that way to look.       As the Sicilian bull, that rightfully  His cries first echoed, who had shap'd its mould,  Did so rebellow, with the voice of him  Tormented, that the brazen monster seem'd  Pierc'd through with pain; thus while no way they found  Nor avenue immediate through the flame,  Into its language turn'd the dismal words:  But soon as they had won their passage forth,  Up from the point, which vibrating obey'd  Their motion at the tongue, these sounds we heard:  \"O thou!  to whom I now direct my voice!  That lately didst exclaim in Lombard phrase,       Depart thou, I solicit thee no more,'  Though somewhat tardy I perchance arrive  Let it not irk thee here to pause awhile,  And with me parley:  lo! it irks not me  And yet I burn.  If but e'en now thou fall  into this blind world, from that pleasant land  Of Latium, whence I draw my sum of guilt,  Tell me if those, who in Romagna dwell,  Have peace or war.  For of the mountains there  Was I, betwixt Urbino and the height,  Whence Tyber first unlocks his mighty flood.\"       Leaning I listen'd yet with heedful ear,  When, as he touch'd my side, the leader thus:  \"Speak thou: he is a Latian.\"  My reply  Was ready, and I spake without delay:       \"O spirit!  who art hidden here below!  Never was thy Romagna without war  In her proud tyrants' bosoms, nor is now:  But open war there left I none.  The state,  Ravenna hath maintain'd this many a year,  Is steadfast.  There Polenta's eagle broods,  And in his broad circumference of plume  O'ershadows Cervia. The green talons grasp  The land, that stood erewhile the proof so long,  And pil'd in bloody heap the host of France.       \"The' old mastiff of Verruchio and the young,  That tore Montagna in their wrath, still make,  Where they are wont, an augre of their fangs.       \"Lamone's city and Santerno's range  Under the lion of the snowy lair.  Inconstant partisan! that changeth sides,  Or ever summer yields to winter's frost.  And she, whose flank is wash'd of Savio's wave,  As 'twixt the level and the steep she lies,  Lives so 'twixt tyrant power and liberty.       \"Now tell us, I entreat thee, who art thou?  Be not more hard than others.  In the world,  So may thy name still rear its forehead high.\"       Then roar'd awhile the fire, its sharpen'd point  On either side wav'd, and thus breath'd at last:  \"If I did think, my answer were to one,  Who ever could return unto the world,  This flame should rest unshaken.  But since ne'er,  If true be told me, any from this depth  Has found his upward way, I answer thee,  Nor fear lest infamy record the words.       \"A man of arms at first, I cloth'd me then  In good Saint Francis' girdle, hoping so  T' have made amends.  And certainly my hope  Had fail'd not, but that he, whom curses light on,  The' high priest again seduc'd me into sin.  And how and wherefore listen while I tell.  Long as this spirit mov'd the bones and pulp  My mother gave me, less my deeds bespake  The nature of the lion than the fox.  All ways of winding subtlety I knew,  And with such art conducted, that the sound  Reach'd the world's limit.  Soon as to that part  Of life I found me come, when each behoves  To lower sails and gather in the lines;  That which before had pleased me then I rued,  And to repentance and confession turn'd;  Wretch that I was! and well it had bested me!  The chief of the new Pharisees meantime,  Waging his warfare near the Lateran,  Not with the Saracens or Jews (his foes  All Christians were, nor against Acre one  Had fought, nor traffic'd in the Soldan's land),  He his great charge nor sacred ministry  In himself, rev'renc'd, nor in me that cord,  Which us'd to mark with leanness whom it girded.  As in Socrate, Constantine besought  To cure his leprosy Sylvester's aid,  So me to cure the fever of his pride  This man besought: my counsel to that end  He ask'd:  and I was silent:  for his words  Seem'd drunken:  but forthwith he thus resum'd:  \"From thy heart banish fear:  of all offence  I hitherto absolve thee.  In return,  Teach me my purpose so to execute,  That Penestrino cumber earth no more.  Heav'n, as thou knowest, I have power to shut  And open:  and the keys are therefore twain,  The which my predecessor meanly priz'd.\"       Then, yielding to the forceful arguments,  Of silence as more perilous I deem'd,  And answer'd:  \"Father! since thou washest me  Clear of that guilt wherein I now must fall,  Large promise with performance scant, be sure,  Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.\"       \"When I was number'd with the dead, then came  Saint Francis for me; but a cherub dark  He met, who cried: \"'Wrong me not; he is mine,  And must below to join the wretched crew,  For the deceitful counsel which he gave.  E'er since I watch'd him, hov'ring at his hair,  No power can the impenitent absolve;  Nor to repent and will at once consist,  By contradiction absolute forbid.\"  Oh mis'ry! how I shook myself, when he  Seiz'd me, and cried, \"Thou haply thought'st me not  A disputant in logic so exact.\"  To Minos down he bore me, and the judge  Twin'd eight times round his callous back the tail,  Which biting with excess of rage, he spake:  \"This is a guilty soul, that in the fire  Must vanish.'  Hence perdition-doom'd I rove  A prey to rankling sorrow in this garb.\"       When he had thus fulfill'd his words, the flame  In dolour parted, beating to and fro,  And writhing its sharp horn.  We onward went,  I and my leader, up along the rock,  Far as another arch, that overhangs  The foss, wherein the penalty is paid  Of those, who load them with committed sin.        CANTO XXVIII    WHO, e'en in words unfetter'd, might at full  Tell of the wounds and blood that now I saw,  Though he repeated oft the tale? No tongue  So vast a theme could equal, speech and thought  Both impotent alike.  If in one band  Collected, stood the people all, who e'er  Pour'd on Apulia's happy soil their blood,  Slain by the Trojans, and in that long war  When of the rings the measur'd booty made  A pile so high, as Rome's historian writes  Who errs not, with the multitude, that felt  The grinding force of Guiscard's Norman steel,  And those the rest, whose bones are gather'd yet  At Ceperano, there where treachery  Branded th' Apulian name, or where beyond  Thy walls, O Tagliacozzo, without arms  The old Alardo conquer'd; and his limbs  One were to show transpierc'd, another his  Clean lopt away; a spectacle like this  Were but a thing of nought, to the' hideous sight  Of the ninth chasm.  A rundlet, that hath lost  Its middle or side stave, gapes not so wide,  As one I mark'd, torn from the chin throughout  Down to the hinder passage: 'twixt the legs  Dangling his entrails hung, the midriff lay  Open to view, and wretched ventricle,  That turns th' englutted aliment to dross.       Whilst eagerly I fix on him my gaze,  He ey'd me, with his hands laid his breast bare,  And cried;  \"Now mark how I do rip me!  lo!  How is Mohammed mangled!  before me  Walks Ali weeping, from the chin his face  Cleft to the forelock; and the others all  Whom here thou seest, while they liv'd, did sow  Scandal and schism, and therefore thus are rent.  A fiend is here behind, who with his sword  Hacks us thus cruelly, slivering again  Each of this ream, when we have compast round  The dismal way, for first our gashes close  Ere we repass before him.  But say who  Art thou, that standest musing on the rock,  Haply so lingering to delay the pain  Sentenc'd upon thy crimes?\"--\"Him death not yet,\"  My guide rejoin'd, \"hath overta'en, nor sin  Conducts to torment; but, that he may make  Full trial of your state, I who am dead  Must through the depths of hell, from orb to orb,  Conduct him.  Trust my words, for they are true.\"       More than a hundred spirits, when that they heard,  Stood in the foss to mark me, through amazed,  Forgetful of their pangs.  \"Thou, who perchance  Shalt shortly view the sun, this warning thou  Bear to Dolcino:  bid him, if he wish not  Here soon to follow me, that with good store  Of food he arm him, lest impris'ning snows  Yield him a victim to Novara's power,  No easy conquest else.\"  With foot uprais'd  For stepping, spake Mohammed, on the ground  Then fix'd it to depart.  Another shade,  Pierc'd in the throat, his nostrils mutilate  E'en from beneath the eyebrows, and one ear  Lopt off, who with the rest through wonder stood  Gazing, before the rest advanc'd, and bar'd  His wind-pipe, that without was all o'ersmear'd  With crimson stain.  \"O thou!\" said 'he, \"whom sin  Condemns not, and whom erst (unless too near  Resemblance do deceive me) I aloft  Have seen on Latian ground, call thou to mind  Piero of Medicina, if again  Returning, thou behold'st the pleasant land  That from Vercelli slopes to Mercabo;  And there instruct the twain, whom Fano boasts  Her worthiest sons, Guido and Angelo,  That if 't is giv'n us here to scan aright  The future, they out of life's tenement  Shall be cast forth, and whelm'd under the waves  Near to Cattolica, through perfidy  Of a fell tyrant.  'Twixt the Cyprian isle  And Balearic, ne'er hath Neptune seen  An injury so foul, by pirates done  Or Argive crew of old.  That one-ey'd traitor  (Whose realm there is a spirit here were fain  His eye had still lack'd sight of) them shall bring  To conf'rence with him, then so shape his end,  That they shall need not 'gainst Focara's wind  Offer up vow nor pray'r.\"  I answering thus:       \"Declare, as thou dost wish that I above  May carry tidings of thee, who is he,  In whom that sight doth wake such sad remembrance?\"       Forthwith he laid his hand on the cheek-bone  Of one, his fellow-spirit, and his jaws  Expanding, cried:  \"Lo! this is he I wot of;  He speaks not for himself:  the outcast this  Who"]]]
