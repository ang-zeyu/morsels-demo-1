There was not a sign of any city, nothing but darkness and odd  noises and the wind singing in the trees. Curious little animals, such  as I had never smelt before, came creeping out of the bushes to look at  us. I would have chased them, but Peter's arm was round my neck and I  could not leave him. But when something that smelt like a rabbit came  so near that I could have reached out a paw and touched it, I turned my  head and snapped; and then they all scurried back into the bushes and  there were no more noises.    There was a long silence. Then Peter gave a great gulp.    'I'm not frightened,' he said. 'I'm not!'    I shoved my head closer against his chest. There was another silence  for a long time.    'I'm going to pretend we have been captured by brigands,' said Peter at  last. 'Are you listening? There were three of them, great big men with  beards, and they crept up behind me and snatched me up and took me out  here to their lair. This is their lair. One was called Dick, the  others' names were Ted and Alfred. They took hold of me and brought me  all the way through the wood till we got here, and then they went off,  meaning to come back soon. And while they were away, you missed me and  tracked me through the woods till you found me here. And then the  brigands came back, and they didn't know you were here, and you kept  quite quiet till Dick was quite near, and then you jumped out and bit  him and he ran away. And then you bit Ted and you bit Alfred, and they  ran away too. And so we were left all alone, and I was quite safe  because you were here to look after me. And then--And then--'    His voice died away, and the arm that was round my neck went limp, and  I could hear by his breathing that he was asleep. His head was resting  on my back, but I didn't move. I wriggled a little closer to make him  as comfortable as I could, and then I went to sleep myself.    I didn't sleep very well. I had funny dreams all the time, thinking  these little animals were creeping up close enough out of the bushes  for me to get a snap at them without disturbing Peter.    If I woke once, I woke a dozen times, but there was never anything  there. The wind sang in the trees and the bushes rustled, and far away  in the distance the frogs were calling.    And then I woke once more with the feeling that this time something  really was coming through the bushes. I lifted my head as far as I  could, and listened. For a little while nothing happened, and then,  straight in front of me, I saw lights. And there was a sound of  trampling in the undergrowth.    It was no time to think about not waking Peter. This was something  definite, something that had to be attended to quick. I was up with a  jump, yelling. Peter rolled off my back and woke up, and he sat there  listening, while I stood with my front paws on him and shouted at the  men. I was bristling all over. I didn't know who they were or what they  wanted, but the way I looked at it was that anything could happen in  those woods at that time of night, and, if anybody was coming along to  start something, he had got to reckon with me.    Somebody called, 'Peter! Are you there, Peter?'    There was a crashing in the bushes, the lights came nearer and nearer,  and then somebody said 'Here he is!' and there was a lot of shouting. I  stood where I was, ready to spring if necessary, for I was taking no  chances.    'Who are you?' I shouted. 'What do you want?' A light flashed in my  eyes.    'Why, it's that dog!'    Somebody came into the light, and I saw it was the boss. He was looking  very anxious and scared, and he scooped Peter up off the ground and  hugged him tight.    Peter was only half awake. He looked up at the boss drowsily, and began  to talk about brigands, and Dick and Ted and Alfred, the same as he had  said to me. There wasn't a sound till he had finished. Then the boss  spoke.    'Kidnappers! I thought as much. And the dog drove them away!'    For the first time in our acquaintance he actually patted me.    'Good old man!' he said.    'He's my dog,' said Peter sleepily, 'and he isn't to be shot.'    'He certainly isn't, my boy,' said the boss. 'From now on he's the  honoured guest. He shall wear a gold collar and order what he wants for  dinner. And now let's be getting home. It's time you were in bed.'           *       *       *       *       *    Mother used to say, 'If you're a good dog, you will be happy. If you're  not, you won't,' but it seems to me that in this world it is all a  matter of luck. When I did everything I could to please people, they  wanted to shoot me; and when I did nothing except run away, they  brought me back and treated me better than the most valuable  prize-winner in the kennels. It was puzzling at first, but one day I  heard the boss talking to a friend who had come down from the city.    The friend looked at me and said, 'What an ugly mongrel! Why on earth  do you have him about? I thought you were so particular about your  dogs?'    And the boss replied, 'He may be a mongrel, but he can have anything he  wants in this house. Didn't you hear how he saved Peter from being  kidnapped?'    And out it all came about the brigands.    'The kid called them brigands,' said the boss. 'I suppose that's how it  would strike a child of that age. But he kept mentioning the name Dick,  and that put the police on the scent. It seems there's a kidnapper well  known to the police all over the country as Dick the Snatcher. It was  almost certainly that scoundrel and his gang. How they spirited the  child away, goodness knows, but they managed it, and the dog tracked  them and scared them off. We found him and Peter together in the woods.  It was a narrow escape, and we have to thank this animal here for it.'    What could I say? It was no more use trying to put them right than it  had been when I mistook Toto for a rat. Peter had gone to sleep that  night pretending about the brigands to pass the time, and when he awoke  he still believed in them. He was that sort of child. There was nothing  that I could do about it.    Round the corner, as the boss was speaking, I saw the kennel-man coming  with a plate in his hand. It smelt fine, and he was headed straight for  me.    He put the plate down before me. It was liver, which I love.    'Yes,' went on the boss, 'if it hadn't been for him, Peter would have  been kidnapped and scared half to death, and I should be poorer, I  suppose, by whatever the scoundrels had chosen to hold me up for.'    I am an honest dog, and hate to obtain credit under false pretences,  but--liver is liver. I let it go at that.          CROWNED HEADS      Katie had never been more surprised in her life than when the serious  young man with the brown eyes and the Charles Dana Gibson profile  spirited her away from his friend and Genevieve. Till that moment she  had looked on herself as playing a sort of 'villager and retainer' part  to the brown-eyed young man's hero and Genevieve's heroine. She knew  she was not pretty, though somebody (unidentified) had once said that  she had nice eyes; whereas Genevieve was notoriously a beauty,  incessantly pestered, so report had it, by musical comedy managers to  go on the stage.    Genevieve was tall and blonde, a destroyer of masculine peace of mind.  She said 'harf' and 'rahther', and might easily have been taken for an  English duchess instead of a cloak-model at Macey's. You would have  said, in short, that, in the matter of personable young men, Genevieve  would have swept the board. Yet, here was this one deliberately  selecting her, Katie, for his companion. It was almost a miracle.    He had managed it with the utmost dexterity at the merry-go-round. With  winning politeness he had assisted Genevieve on her wooden steed, and  then, as the machinery began to work, had grasped Katie's arm and led  her at a rapid walk out into the sunlight. Katie's last glimpse of  Genevieve had been the sight of her amazed and offended face as it  whizzed round the corner, while the steam melodeon drowned protests  with a spirited plunge into 'Alexander's Ragtime Band'.    Katie felt shy. This young man was a perfect stranger. It was true she  had had a formal introduction to him, but only from Genevieve, who had  scraped acquaintance with him exactly two minutes previously. It had  happened on the ferry-boat on the way to Palisades Park. Genevieve's  bright eye, roving among the throng on the lower deck, had singled out  this young man and his companion as suitable cavaliers for the  expedition. The young man pleased her, and his friend, with the broken  nose and the face like a good-natured bulldog, was obviously suitable  for Katie.    Etiquette is not rigid on New York ferry-boats. Without fuss or delay  she proceeded to make their acquaintance--to Katie's concern, for she  could never get used to Genevieve's short way with strangers. The quiet  life she had led had made her almost prudish, and there were times when  Genevieve's conduct shocked her. Of course, she knew there was no harm  in Genevieve. As the latter herself had once put it, 'The feller that  tries to get gay with me is going to get a call-down that'll make him  holler for his winter overcoat.' But all the same she could not  approve. And the net result of her disapproval was to make her shy and  silent as she walked by this young man's side.    The young man seemed to divine her thoughts.    'Say, I'm on the level,' he observed. 'You want to get that. Right on  the square. See?'    'Oh, yes,' said Katie, relieved but yet embarrassed. It was awkward to  have one's thoughts read like this.    'You ain't like your friend. Don't think I don't see that.'    'Genevieve's a sweet girl,' said Katie, loyally.    'A darned sight too sweet. Somebody ought to tell her mother.'    'Why did you speak to her if you did not like her?'    'Wanted to get to know you,' said the young man"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7498"],[0,"Five Little Peppers Grown Up (#16)"],[1,"for you.\"    \"For me?\" cried Jasper, in surprise.    \"Yes. You've got to help me. I can't stand it, waiting around any  longer. It has almost killed me as it is.\" Pickering threw his head on  the chair-back and took savage pulls at the cigar between his teeth.    \"I help you?\" cried Jasper, too astonished to do much more than to  repeat the words. \"How in all this world can I do anything in the  matter?\" he demanded, as soon as he could find his voice.    \"Why, you can tell Polly how it is; you're her brother, or as good as  one; and she'll see it from you. And you must hurry about it, too, for I  expect that Loughead will turn up soon. He means mischief, he does.\"    \"See here, Pick,\" cried Jasper, getting out of his chair hastily to face  Pickering, \"you don't know what you are asking. Why, I couldn't do it.  The very idea; I never heard of such a thing! You--you must speak to  Polly yourself.\"    \"I can't,\" said Pickering, in a burst, and bringing up his head  suddenly. \"She won't give me the ghost of a chance. There's always those  girls around her; and she's been away an age at Mrs. Whitney's. And  everlastingly somebody is sick or getting hurt, and they won't have  anybody but Polly. You know how it is yourself, Jasper,\" and he turned  on him an injured countenance.    \"Well, don't come to me,\" cried Jasper, beginning to pace the floor  irritably. \"I couldn't ever speak on such a subject to Polly. Beside it  would be the very way to set her against you. It would any girl; can't  you see it, Pick?\" he added, brightening up.    \"Girls are queer,\" observed Pickering shrewdly, \"and the very thing you  think they won't like, they take to amazingly. Oh, you go along, Jasper,  and let her see how matters stand; how I feel, I mean.\"    \"You will do your own speaking,\" said Jasper, in his most crusty  fashion, and without turning his head.    \"I did; that is, I tried to last night after I met Crane,\" began  Pickering, in a shamefaced way, \"but I couldn't get even a chance to see  Polly.\"    \"How's that?\" asked Jasper, still marching up and down the floor;  \"wasn't she home?\"    \"Why, she sent Charlotte Chatterton down to see me,\" said Pickering,  very much aggrieved, \"and I hate that Chatterton girl.\"    \"Why couldn't Polly see you?\" went on Jasper, determined, since his  assistance was asked, to go to the root of the matter.    \"Oh, somebody in the establishment, I don't know who, had a finger-ache,  I suppose,\" said Pickering, carelessly throwing away his cigar end and  lighting a fresh one, \"and wanted Polly. Never mind why; she couldn't  come down, she sent word. So I gave up in despair. See here now, Jasper,  you must help me out.\"    \"I tell you I won't,\" declared Jasper, with rising irritation, \"not in  that way.\"    \"You won't?\"    \"No, I won't. I can't, my dear fellow.\"    \"Well, there's a great end of our friendship,\" exclaimed Pickering, red  with anger, and he jumped to his feet. \"Do you mean to say, Jasper King,  that you won't do such a simple thing for me as to say a word to your  sister Polly, when I tell you it's all up with me if you don't speak  that word--say?\"    \"You oughtn't to ask such a thing; it's despicable in you,\" cried  Jasper, aghast to find his anger rising at each word. \"And if you insist  in making such a request when I tell you that I cannot speak to Polly  for you, why, I shall be forced to repeat what I said at first, that I  won't have anything to do with it.\"    \"Do you mean it,\" Pickering put himself in front of Jasper's advancing  strides, \"that you will not speak to Polly for me?\"    \"I do.\"    \"I tell you,\" declared Pickering, now quite beside himself, \"it's  absolutely necessary for me to have your word with her, Jasper King.\"    \"And I tell you I can't give that word,\" said Jasper. Then he stopped  short, and looked into Pickering's face. \"I'm sorry, old chap,\" and he  put out his hand.    Pickering knocked it aside in a towering passion. \"You needn't 'old  chap' me,\" he cried. \"And there's an end to our friendship, King.\" He  seized his hat and dashed out of the room.    \"Miss Salisbury!\" Alexia Rhys, in real distress, threw herself against  her old teacher, who was hurrying through the long school-room.    \"Well, what is it?\" asked Miss Salisbury, settling her glasses for a  look at her former pupil. \"You mustn't hinder me; I'm on my way to the  recitation room,\" and her hand made a movement toward her watch.    \"Oh, don't think of time, Miss Salisbury!\" begged Alexia, just as  familiarly as in the old days, \"when Polly Pepper needs to be looked out  for.\"    \"If Polly Pepper needs me in any way, why, I must stop,\" said the  principal of the \"Young Ladies' Select Boarding and Day School,\" \"but I  don't see how she can need me, Alexia,\" she added in perplexity, \"Polly  is fully capable of taking care of herself.\"    \"Oh, no, she isn't,\" cried Alexia abruptly. \"Beg your pardon, but Polly  is a dear, sweet, dreadful idiot. Oh dear me! what do you suppose, Miss  Salisbury, she has gone and done?\"    \"I am quite at a loss to guess,\" said Miss Salisbury calmly, \"and I must  say, Alexia, I am very much pained by your failure to profit by my  instructions. To think that one of my young ladies, especially one on  whom I have spent so much care and attention as yourself, should be so  careless in speech and manner, as you are constantly. 'Gone and  done'--oh, Alexia!\" she exclaimed in a grieved way.    \"Oh, I know,\" cried Alexia imperturbably, \"you did your best, dear Miss  Salisbury, and it isn't your fault that I'm not fine. But oh, don't  waste the time, please, over me, when I want to tell you about Polly.\"    \"What is it about Polly?\" demanded Miss Salisbury, fingering her  watch-chain nervously. \"Really, Alexia, I think Polly would do very well  if you didn't try so hard to take possession of her. I quite pity her,\"  she added frankly.    Alexia burst into a laugh. \"It's the only way to catch a glimpse of her.  Miss Salisbury,\" she cried, \"for everybody is trying to take possession  of Polly Pepper. And now--oh, it's getting perfectly dreadful!\"    Miss Salisbury took an impatient step forward.    \"Oh, Miss Salisbury,\" cried Alexia in alarm, \"wait just a minute, do,  dear Miss Salisbury,\" she cried, throwing her arms around her, thereby  endangering the glasses set upon the fine Roman nose, \"there can't any  one help in this but just you.\"    \"It is very wrong,\" said Miss Salisbury, yet yielding to the embrace,  \"for me to stay and listen to you in this way, but--but I've always been  fond of you, Alexia, and\"--    \"I know it,\" cried Alexia penitently, \"you've just been a dear, always,  Miss Salisbury, to me. If you hadn't, why, I don't know what I should  have done, for I had nobody but aunt,\" with a little pathetic sniff, \"to  look after me.\"    \"My dear Alexia,\" cried Miss Salisbury, quite softened, \"don't feel so.  You are very dear to me. You always were,\" patting her hand. \"And so  what is it that you want to tell me now? Pray be quick, dear.\"    \"Well, then, will you promise to make Polly Pepper do what she ought to,  Miss Salisbury?\" cried Alexia, quite enchanted with her success thus  far.    Miss Salisbury turned a puzzled face at her. \"Will I make Polly Pepper  do as she ought to?\" she repeated. \"My dear Alexia, what a strange  request. Polly Pepper is always doing as she ought.\"    \"Well, Polly is just hateful to herself,\" declared Alexia, \"and if it  wasn't for us girls, she'd--oh, dear me! I don't know what would happen.  What do you suppose, Miss Salisbury, she's gone and--oh dear, I didn't  mean to--but what do you suppose Polly has just done?\"    [Illustration: \"MY DEAR ALEXIA,\" CRIED MISS SALISBURY, QUITE SOFTENED,  \"DON'T FEEL SO.\"]    Before Miss Salisbury could reply, Alexia rushed on frantically. \"If  you'll believe me, Polly has gone and asked that Charlotte Chatterton to  sing at her Recital; just think of that!\" exclaimed Alexia, quite gone  at the enormity of such a blunder.    \"Why, doesn't Charlotte Chatterton sing well?\" asked Miss Salisbury, in  surprise.    \"Oh, frightfully well,\" said Alexia, \"that's just the trouble. And now  Polly's Recital will all be part of that Chatterton girl's glory. And it  was to be so swell!\" And Alexia sank into a chair, and waved back and  forth in grief.    \"Swell! Oh, Alexia,\" exclaimed Miss Salisbury in consternation.    \"Oh, do excuse me,\" mumbled Alexia, \"but Polly really has spoiled that  elegant Recital. It won't be all Polly's, now. Oh, dear me!\"    Miss Salisbury drew a long breath. \"I'm very glad Polly has asked Miss  Chatterton to sing,\" she said at last. \"It was the right thing to do.\"    \"Very glad that Polly has asked that Chatterton girl to sing?\" almost  shrieked Alexia, starting out of her chair.    \"Yes,\" said Miss Salisbury decidedly. \"Very glad indeed, Alexia.\"    \"And now you won't make Polly see that Charlotte Chatterton ought not to  be stuck into that Recital?\" cried Alexia wildly. \"Oh, dear me! and you  are the only one that can bring Polly to her senses--oh, dear me!\"    \"Certainly not,\" said Miss Salisbury, with a little dignified laugh.  \"The Recital is Polly's, and she knows best how to manage it.\"    \"Well, we won't applaud, we girls won't,\" declared Alexia, stiffening  up, \"when that Charlotte Chatterton sings; but we'll all just look the  other way--every single one of us.\"    \"Alexia Rhys!\" slowly ejaculated Miss Salisbury in real sorrow.    \"Well, we can't; it wouldn't be right,\" gasped Alexia. \"Don't look so,  Miss Salisbury. Oh, dear me, why will Polly act so! Oh, dear me! I wish  Charlotte Chatterton was in the Red Sea.\"    Miss Salisbury gathered herself up in quiet disapproval; and with a  parting look prepared to leave the room.    \"Oh, Miss Salisbury,\" cried Alexia, flying after her, to pluck her gown,  \"do turn around. Oh, dear me!\" and she began to cry as hard as she  could.    \"When you have come to your better self, Alexia, I will talk with you,\"  said Miss"]]]
