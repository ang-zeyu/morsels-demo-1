His wit and humour was so  little laboured, that his most entertaining scenes seemed to be  no more than his common conversation committed to paper. As his  conceptions were so full of life and humour, it is not much to be  wondered at, if his muse should be sometimes too warm to wait the slow  pace of judgment, or to endure the drudgery of forming a regular Fable  to them.    That Sir John was capable of a great force of thinking, appears  abundantly clear from that scene between Aesop and a country  gentleman, who comes to complain of the bad conduct of those in power.  The dialogue is at once sensible and animated. Aesop shews him what  he reckoned the oppressions of the administration, flowed from the  prejudices of ignorance, contemplated through the medium of popular  discontent. In the interview between the Beau and the Philosopher,  there is the following pretty fable. The Beau observes to Aesop, 'It  is very well; it is very well, old spark; I say it is very well;  because I han't a pair of plod shoes, and a dirty shirt, you think  a woman won't venture upon me for husband.--Why now to shew you, old  father, how little you philosophers know the ladies.--I'll tell you an  adventure of a friend of mine.'        A Band, a Bob-wig and a Feather    Attack'd a lady's heart together,    The band in a most learned plea,    Made up of deep philosophy,    Told her, if she would please to wed    A reverend beard, and take instead        Of vigorous youth,        Old solemn truth,    With books, and morals into bed,       How happy she would be.        The Bob, he talk'd of management,    What wond'rous blessings Heav'n sent    On care, and pains, and industry;    And truly he must be so free,    To own he thought your airy beaux,    With powdered wigs, and dancing shoes,    Were good for nothing (mend his soul)    But prate and talk, and play the fool.        He said, 'twas wealth gave joy, and mirth,        And that to be the dearest wife,        Of one who laboured all his life,    To make a mine of gold his own,    And not spend sixpence when he'd done        Was Heaven upon earth.        When these two blades had done, d'ye see.    The Feather (as it might be me)    Steps out sir from behind the skreen.    With such an air and such a mien,    Look you, old gentleman, in short,    He quickly spoil'd the statesman's sport.        It prov'd such sunshine weather,    That you must know at the first beck    The lady leapt about his neck,      And off they went together.    The reputation which Sir John gained by his comedies was rewarded  with, greater advantages, than what arise from the usual profits of  writing for the stage. He was appointed Clarencieux King at Arms, a  place which he some time held, and at last disposed of. In August 1716  he was appointed surveyor of the works at Greenwich Hospital; he was  likewise made comptroller-general of his Majesty's works, and surveyor  of the gardens and waters, the profits of which places, collectively  considered, must amount to a very considerable sum. In some part  of our author's life (for we cannot justly ascertain the time) he  gratified an inclination of visiting France. As curiosity no doubt  induced him to pass over to that country, he lost no time in making  such observations as could enable him to discern the spirit, and  genius of that polite people. His taste for architecture excited him  to take a survey of the fortifications in that kingdom; but the ardour  of his curiosity drew him into a snare, out of which he found  great difficulty to escape. When he was one day surveying some  fortifications with the strictest attention, he was taken notice of  by an Engineer, secured by authority, and then carried prisoner to  the Bastile in Paris. The French were confirmed in suspicions of his  design, by several plans being found in his possession at the time  he was seized upon; but as the French, except in cases of Heresy,  use their prisoners with gentleness and humanity, Sir John found  his confinement so endurable, that he amus'd himself in drawing rude  draughts of some comedies. This circumstance raising curiosity in  Paris, several of the noblesse visited him in the Bastile, when Sir  John, who spoke their language with fluency and elegance, insinuated  himself into their favour by the vivacity of his wit, and the  peculiarity of his humour. He gained so much upon their affections,  that they represented him to the French King in an innocent light, and  by that means procured his liberty some days before the sollicitation  came from: England.    Sir John Vanbrugh formed a project of building a stately theatre  in the Hay-market, for which: he had interest enough, to raise  a subscription of thirty persons of quality at 100 l. each, in  consideration whereof, every subscriber for his own life, should be  admitted to whatever entertainments should be publickly performed  there, without farther payment for entrance.    On the first stone that was laid in this theatre, were inscribed the  words LITTLE WHIG, as a compliment to a lady of extraordinary beauty,  then the celebrated toast, and pride of that party. In the year 1706  when this house was finished, Mr. Betterton and his copartners put  themselves under the direction of Sir John Vanbrugh and Mr. Congreve;  imagining that the conduct of two such eminent authors would restore  their ruined affairs; but they found their expectations were too  sanguine, for though Sir John was an expeditious writer, yet Mr.  Congreve was too judicious to let any thing come unfinished out of his  hands; besides, every proper convenience of a good theatre had  been sacrificed to shew the audience a vast triumphal piece of  architecture, in which plays, by means of the spaciousness of the  dome, could not be successfully represented, because the actors could  not be distinctly heard.    Not long before this time the Italian Opera began to steal into  England, but in as rude a disguise, and as unlike itself as possible;  notwithstanding which the new monster pleaded, though it had neither  grace, melody, nor action to recommend it. To strike in therefore with  the prevailing fashion, Vanbrugh and Congreve opened their New Theatre  in the Hay-market, with a translated Opera, set to Italian music,  called The Triumph of Love, but it met with a cold reception, being  performed only three days, to thin houses.    Immediately upon the failure of the Opera, Vanbrugh produced his  comedy called The Confederacy, greatly improved from the Bourgois a la  mode of Dancour. The success of this play was not equal to its merit;  for it is written in, an uncommon vein of humour, and abounds with  the most lively strokes of raillery. The prospects of gain from this  theatre were so very unpromising, that Congreve, in a few months,  gave up his share and interest in the government wholly to Sir John  Vanbrugh; who being now sole proprietor of the house, was under a  necessity to exert himself in its support. As he had a happier talent  for throwing the English spirit into his translations of French plays,  than any former author who had borrowed from them, he, in the same  season, gave the public three more of that kind, viz.    1. The Cuckold in Conceit, from the Cocu imaginaire of Moliere.    2. Squire Treelooby, from his Monsieur de Pourceaugnac.    3. The Mistake, from the Depit Amoureux of the same Author[A].    However well executed these pieces were, yet they came to the ear in  the same undistinguished utterance, by which almost all their plays  had equally suffered; for as few could plainly hear, it was not likely  a great many would applaud.    In this situation it appears, that nothing but the union of the two  companies could restore the stage to its former reputation.    Sir John Vanbrugh therefore, tired of theatrical management, thought  of disposing of his whole farm to some industrious tenant, that might  put it into better condition. It was to Mr. Owen Swiny, that in the  exigence of his affairs, he made an offer of his actors under such  agreements of salary as might be made with them; and of his house,  cloaths, and scenes, with the Queen's license to employ them, upon  payment of the casual rent of five pounds every acting day, and not  to exceed 700 l. per annum. With this proposal Mr. Swiny complied, and  governed that stage till another great theatrical revolution.    There are two plays of our author not yet mentioned, viz. The False  Friend, a Comedy; acted in 1698, and A Journey to London, a Comedy;  which he left unfinished. This last piece was finished by Mr. Cibber  to a very great advantage, and now is one of the best comedies in our  language. Mr. Cibber, in his prologue, takes particular notice of our  author's virtuous intention in composing this piece, which, he says,  was to make some amends for those loose scenes, which in the fire of  his youth he had with more regard to applause, than virtue, exhibited  to the public: but this design will be best understood by inserting  the prologue.      PROLOGUE.        This play took birth from principles of truth,    To make amends for errors past, of youth.    A bard that's now no more, in riper days,    Conscious review'd the licence of his plays:    And tho' applause his wanton muse had fir'd,    Himself condemn'd what sensual minds admir'd.    At length he own'd that plays should let you see    Not only what you are, but ought to be:    Though vice was natural, 'twas never meant,    The stage should shew it, but for punishment!    Warm with that thought his muse once more took flame,    Resolv'd to bring licentious life to shame.

[Footnote 13: Memoires sur la reine Hortense, par le Baron van Schelten,  vol. i., p. 145.]    Now that Josephine was an empress, her daughter, the wife of the High  Constable of France, took the second position at the brilliant court of  the emperor. The daughter of the beheaded viscount was now a \"Princess  of France,\" an \"imperial highness,\" who must be approached with  reverence, who had her court and her maids of honor, and whose liberty  and personal inclinations, as was also the case with her mother, were  confined in the fetters of the strict etiquette which Napoleon required  to be observed at the new imperial court.    But neither Josephine nor Hortense allowed herself to be blinded by this  new splendor. A crown could confer upon Josephine no additional  happiness; glittering titles could neither enhance Hortense's youth and  beauty, nor alleviate her secret misery. She would have been contented  to live in retirement, at the side of a beloved husband; her proud  position could not indemnify her for her lost woman's happiness.    But Fate seemed to pity the noble, gentle being, who knew how to bear  misery and grandeur with the same smiling dignity, and offered her a  recompense for the overthrow of her first mother's hope--a new  hope--she promised to become a mother again.    Josephine received this intelligence with delight, for her daughter's  hope was a hope for her too. If Hortense should give birth to a son, the  gods might be reconciled, and misfortune be banished from the head of  the empress. With this son, the dynasty of the new imperial family would  be assured; this son could be the heir of the imperial crown, and  Napoleon could well adopt as his own the child who was at the same time  his nephew and his grandson.    Napoleon promised Josephine that he would do this; that he would rather  content himself with an adopted son, in whom the blood of the emperor  and of the empress was mixed, than be compelled to separate himself from  her, from his Josephine. Napoleon still loved his wife; he still  compared with all he thought good and beautiful, the woman who shed  around his grandeur the lustre of her grace and loveliness.    When the people greeted their new emperor with loud cries of joy and  thunders of applause, Napoleon, his countenance illumined with  exultation, exclaimed: \"How glorious a music is this! These acclamations  and greetings sound as sweet and soft as the voice of Josephine! How  proud and happy I am, to be loved by such a people[14]!\"    [Footnote 14: Bourrienne, vol. iv., p. 288.]    But his proud ambition was not yet sated. As he bad once said, upon  entering the Tuileries as first consul, \"It is not enough to _be_ in  the Tuileries; one must also _remain_ there\"--he now said: \"It is not  enough to have been made emperor by the French people; one must also  have received his consecration as emperor from the Pope of Rome.\"    And Napoleon was now mighty enough to give laws to the world; not only  to bend France, but also foreign sovereigns, to his will.    Napoleon desired for his crown the papal consecration; and the Pope left  the holy city and repaired to Paris, to give the new emperor the  blessing of the Church in the Cathedral of Notre-Dame. This was a new  halo around Napoleon's head--a new, an unbounded triumph, which he  celebrated over France, over the whole world and its prejudices, and  over all the dynasties by the \"grace of God.\" The Pope came to Paris to  crown the emperor. The German emperors had been compelled to make a  pilgrimage to Rome, to receive the papal benediction, and now the Pope  made a pilgrimage to Paris to crown the French emperor, and acknowledge  the son of the Revolution as the consecrated son of the Church. All  France was intoxicated with delight at this intelligence; all France  adored the hero, who made of the wonders of fiction a reality, and  converted even the holy chair at Rome into the footstool of his  grandeur. Napoleon's journey with Josephine through France, undertaken  while they awaited the Pope's coming, was, therefore, a single,  continuous triumph. It was not only the people who received him with  shouts of joy, but the Church also sang to him, everywhere, her  _sanctus, sanctus_, and the priests received him at the doors of their  churches with loud benedictions, extolling him as the savior of France.  Everywhere, the imperial couple was received with universal exultation,  with the ringing of bells, with triumphal arches, and solemn addresses  of welcome, the latter partaking sometimes of a transcendental nature.    \"God created Bonaparte,\" said the Prefect of Arras, in his enthusiastic  address to the emperor--\"God created Bonaparte, and then He rested.\"  And Count Louis of Narbonne, at that time not yet won over by the  emperor, and not yet grand-marshal of the imperial court, whispered,  quite audibly: \"God would have done better had He rested a  little sooner!\"    Finally, the intelligence overran all France, that the wonder, in which  they had not yet dared to believe, had become reality, and that Pope  Pius VII. had crossed the boundaries of France, and was now approaching  the capital. The Holy Father of the Church, that had now arisen  victoriously from the ruins of the revolution, was everywhere received  by the people and authorities with the greatest honor. The old royal  palace at Fontainebleau had, by order of the emperor, been refurnished  with imperial magnificence, and, as a peculiarly delicate attention, the  Pope's bedchamber had been arranged in exact imitation of his bedchamber  in the Quirinal at Home. The emperor, empress, and their suite, now  repaired to Fontainebleau, to receive Pope Pius VII. The whole ceremony  had, however, been previously arranged, and understanding had with the  Pope concerning the various questions of etiquette. In conformity with  this prearranged ceremony, when the couriers announced the approach of  the Pope, Napoleon rode out to the chase, to give himself the appearance  of meeting the Pope accidentally on his way. The equipages and the  imperial court had taken position in the forest of Nemours. Napoleon,  however, attired in hunting-dress, rode, with his suite, to the summit  of a little hill, which the Pope's carriage had just reached. The Pope  at once ordered a halt, and the emperor also brought his suite to a  stand with a gesture of his hand. A brief interval of profound silence  followed. All felt that a great historical event was taking place, and  the eyes of all were fastened in wondering expectation on the two chief  figures of this scene--on the emperor, who sat there on his horse, in  his simple huntsman's attire; and on the Pope, in his gold-embroidered  robes, leaning back in his equipage, drawn by six horses.    As Napoleon dismounted, the Pope hastened to descend from his carriage,  hesitating a moment, however, after he had already placed his foot on  the carriage-step; but Napoleon's foot had already touched the earth.  Pius could, therefore, no longer hesitate; he must make up his mind to  step, in his white, gold-embroidered satin slippers, on the wet soil,  softened by a shower of rain, that had fallen on the previous day. The  emperor's hunting-boots were certainly much better adapted to this  meeting in the mud than the Pope's white satin slippers.    Emperor and Pope approached and embraced each other tenderly; then,  through the inattention of the coachmen, seemingly, the imperial  equipage was set in motion, and, in its rapid advance, interrupted this  tender embrace. It seemed to be the merest accident that the emperor  stood on the right, and the Pope on the left side of the equipage, that  had now been brought to a stand again. The two doors of the carriage  were simultaneously thrown open by the lackeys; at the same time, the  Pope entered the carriage on the left, and the emperor on the right  side, both seating themselves side by side at the same time. This  settled the question of etiquette. Neither had preceded the other, but  the emperor occupied the seat of honor on the Pope's right.    The coronation of the imperial pair took place on the 2d of December,  1804, in the Cathedral of Notre-Dame. Not only all Paris, but all  France, was in motion on this day. An immense concourse of people surged  to and fro in the streets; the windows of all the houses were filled  with richly-adorned and beautiful women, the bells were ringing in all  the churches, and joyous music, intermixed with the shouts of the  people, was heard in every direction. For a moment, however, these  shouts were changed into laughter, and that was when the papal  procession approached, headed by an ass led by the halter, in accordance  with an ancient custom of Rome. While the Pope, with the high  dignitaries of the Church, repaired to the cathedral to await there the  coming of the imperial couple, Napoleon was putting on the imperial  insignia in the Tuileries, enveloping himself in the green velvet  mantle, bordered with ermine, and thickly studded with brilliants, and  arraying himself in the whole glittering paraphernalia of his new  dignity. When already on the point of leaving the Tuileries with his  wife, who stood at his side in her imperial attire, Bonaparte suddenly  gave the order that the notary Ragideau should be called to the palace,  as he desired to see him at once.    A messenger was at once sent, in an imperial equipage, to bring him from  his dwelling, and in a quarter of an hour the little notary Ragideau  entered the cabinet of the empress, in which the imperial pair"]]]
