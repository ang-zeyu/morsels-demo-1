And for all he sneezed, yet was he by this time so well-nigh  choked with the brimstone that he was like neither to sneeze nor to do  aught else again. As soon as he caught sight of him, Ercolano bawled  out:--'Now see I, Madam, why it was that a while ago, when we came here,  we were kept waiting so long at the gate before 'twas opened; but woe  betide me for the rest of my days, if I pay you not out.' Whereupon the  lady, perceiving that her offence was discovered, ventured no excuse, but  fled from the table, whither I know not. Ercolano, ignoring his wife's  flight, bade the sneezer again and again to come forth; but he, being by  this time fairly spent, budged not an inch for aught that Ercolano said.  Wherefore Ercolano caught him by one of his feet, and dragged him forth,  and ran off for a knife with intent to kill him; but I, standing in fear  of the Signory on my own account, got up and would not suffer him to kill  the fellow or do him any hurt, and for his better protection raised the  alarm, whereby some of the neighbours came up and took the lad, more dead  than alive, and bore him off, I know not whither. However, our supper  being thus rudely interrupted, not only have not gulped it, but I have  not so much as tasted it, as I said before!\"    Her husband's story shewed his wife that there were other ladies as  knowing as she, albeit misfortune might sometimes overtake them and  gladly would she have spoken out in defence of Ercolano's wife, but,  thinking that, by censuring another's sin, she would secure more scope  for her own, she launched out on this wise:--\"Fine doings indeed, a right  virtuous and saintly lady she must be: here is the loyalty of an honest  woman, and one to whom I had lief have confessed, so spiritual I deemed  her; and the worst of it is that, being no longer young, she sets a rare  example to those that are so. Curses on the hour that she came into the  world: curses upon her that she make not away with herself, basest, most  faithless of women that she must needs be, the reproach of her sex, the  opprobrium of all the ladies of this city, to cast aside all regard for  her honour, her marriage vow, her reputation before the world, and, lost  to all sense of shame, to scruple not to bring disgrace upon a man so  worthy, a citizen so honourable, a husband by whom she was so well  treated, ay, and upon herself to boot! By my hope of salvation no mercy  should be shewn to such women; they should pay the penalty with their  lives; to the fire with them while they yet live, and let them be burned  to ashes.\" Then, calling to mind the lover that she had close at hand in  the hen-coop, she fell to coaxing Pietro to get him to bed, for the hour  grew late. Pietro, who was more set on eating than sleeping, only asked  whether there was aught he might have by way of supper. \"Supper,  forsooth!\" replied the lady. \"Ay, of course 'tis our way to make much of  supper when thou art not at home. As if I were Ercolano's wife! Now,  wherefore tarry longer? Go, get thy night's rest: 'twere far better for  thee.\"    Now so it was that some of Pietro's husbandmen had come to the house that  evening with divers things from the farm, and had put up their asses in a  stable that adjoined the veranda, but had neglected to water them; and  one of the asses being exceeding thirsty, got his head out of the halter  and broke loose from the stable, and went about nosing everything, if  haply he might come by water: whereby he came upon the hen-coop, beneath  which was the boy; who, being constrained to stand on all fours, had the  fingers of one hand somewhat protruding from under the hen-coop; and so  as luck or rather ill-luck would have it, the ass trod on them; whereat,  being sorely hurt, he set up a great howling, much to the surprise of  Pietro, who perceived that 'twas within his house. So forth he came, and  hearing the boy still moaning and groaning, for the ass still kept his  hoof hard down on the fingers, called out:--\"Who is there?\" and ran to  the hen-coop and raised it, and espied the fellow, who, besides the pain  that the crushing of his fingers by the ass's hoof occasioned him,  trembled in every limb for fear that Pietro should do him a mischief. He  was one that Pietro had long been after for his foul purposes: so Pietro,  recognizing him, asked him:--\"What dost thou here?\" The boy making no  answer, save to beseech him for the love of God to do him no hurt, Pietro  continued:--\"Get up, have no fear that I shall hurt thee; but tell  me:--How, and for what cause comest thou to be here?\" The boy then  confessed everything. Whereupon Pietro, as elated by the discovery as his  wife was distressed, took him by the hand; and led him into the room  where the lady in the extremity of terror awaited him; and, having seated  himself directly in front of her, said:--\"'Twas but a moment ago that  thou didst curse Ercolano's wife, and averred that she ought to be  burned, and that she was the reproach of your sex: why saidst thou not,  of thyself? Or, if thou wast not minded to accuse thyself, how hadst thou  the effrontery to censure her, knowing that thou hadst done even as she?  Verily 'twas for no other reason than that ye are all fashioned thus, and  study to cover your own misdeeds with the delinquencies of others: would  that fire might fall from heaven and burn you all, brood of iniquity that  ye are!\"    The lady, marking that in the first flush of his wrath he had given her  nothing worse than hard words, and discerning, as she thought, that he  was secretly overjoyed to hold so beautiful a boy by the hand, took heart  of grace and said:--\"I doubt not indeed that thou wouldst be well pleased  that fire should fall from heaven and devour us all, seeing that thou art  as fond of us as a dog is of the stick, though by the Holy Rood thou wilt  be disappointed; but I would fain have a little argument with thee, to  know whereof thou complainest. Well indeed were it with me, didst thou  but place me on an equality with Ercolano's wife, who is an old  sanctimonious hypocrite, and has of him all that she wants, and is  cherished by him as a wife should be: but that is not my case. For,  granted that thou givest me garments and shoes to my mind, thou knowest  how otherwise ill bested I am, and how long it is since last thou didst  lie with me; and far liefer had I go barefoot and in rags, and have thy  benevolence abed, than have all that I have, and be treated as thou dost  treat me. Understand me, Pietro, be reasonable; consider that I am a  woman like other women, with the like craving; whereof if thou deny me  the gratification, 'tis no blame to me that I seek it elsewhere; and at  least I do thee so much honour as not forgather with stable-boys or  scurvy knaves.\"    Pietro perceived that she was like to continue in this vein the whole  night: wherefore, indifferent as he was to her, he said:--\"Now, Madam, no  more of this; in the matter of which thou speakest I will content thee;  but of thy great courtesy let us have something to eat by way of supper;  for, methinks, the boy, as well as I, has not yet supped.\" \"Ay, true  enough,\" said the lady, \"he has not supped; for we were but just sitting  down to table to sup, when, beshrew thee, thou madest thy appearance.\"  \"Go then,\" said Pietro, \"get us some supper; and by and by I will arrange  this affair in such a way that thou shalt have no more cause of  complaint.\" The lady, perceiving that her husband was now tranquil, rose,  and soon had the table laid again and spread with the supper which she  had ready; and so they made a jolly meal of it, the caitiff husband, the  lady and the boy. What after supper Pietro devised for their mutual  satisfaction has slipped from my memory. But so much as this I know, that  on the morrow as he wended his way to the piazza, the boy would have been  puzzled to say, whether of the twain, the wife or the husband, had had  the most of his company during the night. But this I would say to you,  dear my ladies, that whoso gives you tit, why, just give him tat; and if  you cannot do it at once, why, bear it in mind until you can, that even  as the ass gives, so he may receive.    Dioneo's story, whereat the ladies laughed the less for shamefastness  rather than for disrelish, being ended, the queen, taking note that the  term of her sovereignty was come, rose to her feet, and took off the  laurel wreath and set it graciously upon Elisa's head, saying:--\"Madam,  'tis now your turn to bear sway.\" The dignity accepted, Elisa followed in  all respects the example of her predecessors: she first conferred with  the seneschal, and directed him how meetly to order all things during the  time of her sovereignty; which done to the satisfaction of the  company:--\"Ofttimes,\" quoth she, \"have we heard how with bright sallies,  and ready retorts, and sudden devices, not a few have known how to repugn  with apt checks the bites of others, or to avert imminent perils; and  because 'tis an excellent argument, and may be profitable, I ordain that  to-morrow, God helping us, the following be the rule of our discourse; to  wit, that it be of such as by some sprightly sally have repulsed an  attack, or by some ready retort or device have avoided loss, peril or  scorn.\" The rule being heartily approved by all, the queen rose and  dismissed them till supper-time. So the honourable company, seeing the  queen risen, rose all likewise, and as their wont was, betook them to  their diversions as to each seemed best. But when the cicalas had hushed  their chirping, all were mustered again for supper; and having blithely  feasted, they all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13117"],[0,"The Nests and Eggs of Indian Birds, Volume 1 (#17)"],[1,"from Tenasserim, Major C.T. Bingham says:--\"Between the 25th  March and 28th April I found at least twenty nests of this bird. They  were broad, shallow cups of roots and twigs, lined with fine black  grass-roots, and placed at heights varying from 4 to 10 feet above  the ground, invariably in the forks of low bamboo. The number of eggs  varied from 3 to 5; blue in colour, and fairly glossy.\"    Numerous nests from Sikhim, Pegu, and Tenasserim are all of precisely  the same type as described by Mr. Gammie; but some are fully 7 inches  in external diameter, and in several the cavity is at least 4 inches  in diameter.    The eggs of this species obtained by Mr. Gammie vary very much in size  and shape, and somewhat in colour. Some are considerably elongated  ovals, with a marked pyriform tendency. Others are particularly broad  ovals for this class of egg. The shell is fine and compact, and as a  rule they seem to have a fine gloss; but one or two specimens almost  want this. In colour they are a pale, clear, slightly greenish blue,  unspotted and unmarked. In length they vary from 1.01 to 1.13, and in  breadth from 0.81 to 0.9, but the average of thirteen is 1.07 by 0.85.      76. Garrulax albigularis (Gould). _The White-throated  Laughing-Thrush_.    Garrulax albogularis (_Gould), Jerd. B. Ind._ ii, p, 38; _Hume, Rough  Draft N. & E._ no. 411.    The White-throated Laughing-Thrush breeds throughout the lower  southern ranges of the Himalayas from Assam to Afghanistan at  elevations of from 4000 to nearly 8000 feet. They lay from the  commencement of April to the end of June. The nest varies in shape  from a moderately deep cup to a broad shallow saucer, and from 5 to 7  or even 8 inches in external diameter, and from less than 2 to nearly  4 inches in depth internally. Coarse grass, flags, creepers, dead  leaves, moss, moss- and grass-roots, all at times enter more or less  largely into the composition of the nest, which, though sometimes  wholly unlined, is often neatly cushioned with red and black fern and  moss-roots. The nests are placed in small bushes, shrubs, or trees, at  heights of from 3 to 10 feet, sometimes in forks, but more often,  I think, on low horizontal branches, between two or three upright  shoots.    Three is, I think, the regular complement of eggs, and this is the  number I have always found when the eggs were much incubated. I have  not myself observed that this species breeds in company, nor can I  ever remember to have taken two nests within 100 yards of each other.    Captain Hutton remarks:--\"This is very common in Mussoorie at all  seasons, and congregates into large and noisy flocks, turning up the  dead leaves, and screaming and chattering together in most discordant  concert. It breeds in April and May, placing the nest in the forks of  young oaks and other trees, about 7 or 8 feet from the ground,  though sometimes higher, and fastening the sides of it firmly to the  supporting twigs by tendrils of climbing-plants. It is sometimes  composed externally almost entirely of such woody tendrils, intermixed  with a few other twigs, and lined with black hair-like fibres of  mosses and lichens; at other times it is externally composed of coarse  dry grasses and leaves of different kinds of orchids, and lined with  fibres, the materials varying with the locality. The eggs are of a  deep and beautiful green, shining as if recently varnished, and three  in number. In shape they taper somewhat suddenly to the smaller end,  which may almost be termed obtusely pointed. The size 1.19 by 0.87  inch. The usual number of eggs is three, though sometimes only one or  two are found; but only on one occasion out of more than a dozen nests  have I found four eggs. The old bird will remain on the nest until  within reach of the hand.\"    From Murree, Colonel C.H.T. Marshall writes:--\"This was the most  beautiful egg taken this season, being of a rich, deep, glossy,  greenish-blue colour. The nest is composed of fresh ivy-twigs, with  the leaves attached, tightly woven together. The birds breed on small  trees, not high up, at the end of a branch. While their nests were  being examined, they came round in flocks to see what was happening,  chattering and making that peculiar laughing note from which this  genus takes its name. They are even gregarious in the breeding-season,  and all the nests were found pretty near each other about 6000 feet  up.\"    The nest sent me by Colonel Marshall is a broad, shallow cup, or  saucer as I should perhaps call it, some 6 inches in diameter, with  a central depression of at most 1.5 inch, below which the nest is  an inch or 1.5 in thickness. It is very loosely put together, and  composed interiorly of moderately fine dry twigs and roots, but  exteriorly it is completely wound round with slender green ivy-twigs  to which the leaves are attached. It has no lining or pretence for  such.    Captain Cock says:--\"The White-throated Laughing-Thrush lays one of  the most lovely eggs with which I am acquainted. The nest is usually  low, never more than 10 feet or so from the ground; and of some  fifteen or more nests that I have taken, all were constructed of long  stalks of the ground-ivy, twisted round and round into a wreath. The  nest is not a deep cup; if anything it is rather shallow, but it  is very wide. I always found these nests in thick forest, at high  elevations from 6000 to 7000 feet. The birds used to sit close, and  when put off their nests would commence their outcries, and from all  parts they would assemble and flit about almost within reach of one's  hand, making an awful noise, and in the dark shade of the forest their  white gorgets had quite a ghostly look. The eggs are always three in  number, of a beautiful shining blue-green, sometimes of a very long  oval type. I have found the nests at Murree from the 3rd May to quite  the end of June.\"    Colonel G.F.L. Marshall writing of this species says:--\"A nest found  at Nynee Tal on Ayar Pata, about 7000 feet above the sea, contained  two fresh eggs on the 31st May. The eggs were of a rich deep greenish  blue, unspotted. The nest was a scanty and loosely-built structure,  composed of roots and stems of grass and creepers, cup-shaped, rather  shallow, and lined with a curious black creeper, very like coarse  hair. The birds were gregarious even though breeding, and were moving  about the underwood in parties of three to five. The nest was near the  top of an oak-sapling in a dense coppice, placed close against the  stem in a bunch of leaves at the top. The only difficulty in finding  it lay in the scantiness of the structure rather than in the  concealment by the foliage. The bird was on the nest and only moved  off about 3 feet, sitting close by and chattering indignantly during  my inspection. They are noisy birds, constantly on the move, and  their notes, though rather harsh, are very varied and quite  _conversational_.\"    The eggs are long, and pointed at the small end, to which they  sometimes taper much. They are very glossy, and vary from a deep dull  blue (the blue of a dark oil-paint, very much deeper than that of any  other of the Crateropodinae with which I am acquainted) to a deep  intense greenish blue. Possibly other as deeply coloured eggs occur  in this family, but I have seen none like them. They are of course  entirely unspotted.    In length they vary from 1.16 to 1.25, and in breadth from 0.8 to  0.86; but the average of some twenty eggs measured is 1.22 by 0.83.      78.

I know nothing personally of the nidification of the White-spotted  Laughing-Thrush, which breeds nowhere, so far as I know, west  of Nepal, but I had a nest with a couple of eggs and one of the  parent-birds sent me from Darjeeling. The nest was taken in May in one  of the low warm valleys leading to the Great Runjeet, and is said to  have been placed close to the ground in a thick clump of fern and  grass. The nest is chiefly composed of these, intermingled with moss  and roots, and is a large loose structure some 7 inches in diameter.    Mr. Blyth remarked in 'The Ibis' (1867) that this species was \"surely  a _Trochalopteron_ rather than a _Garrulax_,\" and the eggs seem to  confirm this view. These are long, cylindrical ovals, very obtuse even  at the smaller end. They are about the same size as those of _Garrulax  albigularis_, with a very delicate pale blue ground and little or no  gloss. One egg is spotless; the other has a few chocolate-brown specks  or spots towards the large end. They measure 1.18 by 0.86 and 1.25 by  0.85.      80.

Common as this species is about Simla, I have never yet secured the  nest, and know nothing certain about the eggs.    Captain Hutton says:--\"This species appears usually in pairs,  sometimes in a family of four or five. It breeds in May, in which  month I took a nest, at about 6500 feet elevation, in a retired and  wooded glen; it was composed of small twigs externally and lined with  the fine black fibres of lichens. The nest was placed on a horizontal  bough, about 7 feet from the ground, and contained three pure white  eggs. Size 1.12 by 0.69; shape ordinary. The stomach of the old bird  contained sand, seed, and the remains of wasps.\"    One egg that I possess of this species I owe to Captain Hutton, and  it is of the _Pomatorhinus_ type--a long oval, slightly pointed pure  white egg, with but little gloss, measuring 1.08 by 0.75.    From Sikhim a nest, said to belong to this species, has been recently  sent me. It was found below Darjeeling in July, and was placed in  a double fork of the branchlets of a medium-sized tree.
