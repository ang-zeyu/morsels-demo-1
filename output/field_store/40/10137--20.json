[Illustration: FIG. 1.--DAM ON THE RIBEIRAO INFERNO AT PORTATO DE FERRO.]    We only know the quantity of stones that were discovered during the period  when operations were directed by the Royale Extraccao, from 1772 to 1845,  and this was 269,870 grammes, or more than 1,300,000 carats. It should be  understood that what was taken by stealth does not enter into this total,  and it must be stated that during the latter years, when the Extraccao  existed only in name, smuggling must have been active.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--ARRANGEMENT OF THE MACHINERY AT THE PORTATO DE  FERRO DIAMOND DEPOSITS.]    Since that epoch the exploitation has been continued by lessees of the  diamondiferous grounds. It is almost impossible to estimate what the  territory has produced. The discovery of the Cape deposits has given it a  terrible blow. Although the Brazilian diamond is much more beautiful, and  for this reason is held at a much higher price, these new exploitations,  by annually throwing large quantities of stones upon the market, have led  to a great reduction in the price, and the Diamantina exploitations, which  have become long, difficult, and costly, have received a serious set-back.  So the annual production of this region, which was estimated for the years  preceding 1870 at 3,000 oitavas (about 52,000 carats), is now scarcely  500.    The rivers in the environs of Diamantina rim at the bottom of deep and  narrow gorges that have been scooped out to depths of 300 or 400 meters  through the denuded plateau in whose center stands the city of Diamantina.  In the bed of these rivers, in places where they have not yet been worked,  there may be found, underneath a stratum of modern sand, another of rocks,  and finally a diamondiferous deposit of rounded pebbles, mixed with sand.  This gravel, which is characterized in the first place by the fact that  all its elements are rounded, and next by the presence of a large number  of minerals (among which the most important are all the oxides of  titanium, different oxides of iron, tourmaline, and a whole series of  hydrated phosphates of complex composition), is called in the language of  the country _cascalho_. It is the matrix of the diamond, and the latter is  extracted from it by washing. It is arranged in roundish masses upon the  beds of the rivers, and is met with at depths ranging from a few  decimeters up to 25 and 30 meters.    The same material, with the same name, is also found deposited at all  heights upon small terraces at the sides of the valleys through which the  rivers flow. It is coarser and less rolled, and has very likely been  deposited by risings of the rivers during the period when the valleys were  being formed. These deposits bear the name of _gupiarras_. Finally, it is  found in a still coarser state, mixed with red earth and deposited in  horizontal strata upon the upper plateau. It is then called _gorgulho_.    Of these different deposits, the most important are those of the river  beds, the material here having undergone a true mechanical preparation and  being richer. These are the deposits that have been the object of the most  important exploitations.    The year is divided into two distinct seasons--the dry, from May to  September, during which rain is exceptional, and the rainy, from October  to April. As water is necessary for all the operations, no work can be  done upon the high plateaux except through rain water stored up in large  reservoirs. These beds form what are called the \"rainy season washings.\"  In the rivers the working of the beds requires a preliminary drying, which  is effected by diverting the river's course. Now in all this rocky and  denuded region the water that falls runs immediately to the river, and  causes terrible freshets therein; so operations capable of keeping the bed  dry would be out of proportion to the probable results of the  exploitation, whence it follows that the latter is only possible in dry  weather, and these deposits are therefore called \"dry season washings.\"    These deposits are still worked in our day as they were in the time of the  Portuguese. In order to dry the bed a dam is constructed, and the river is  either diverted into a plank flume supported by piles, or into a canal dug  along the shore, or by means of tight walls, according to the lay of the  place. The second process, which is preferable to the first, is in fact  impossible when the river runs, as is often the case, in a narrow, abrupt,  walled channel. These works are sometimes very important. In 1881, the  Acaba Mundo flume was 140 meters in length and 5.2 m. wide, and, with a  velocity of 2.25 m., discharged 4,500 liters per second; still longer ones  might be cited that discharged as much as 8,000 liters.    In the dry part of the river the extraction of the sand, stones, and  cascalho is done solely by hand. The men carry the sand upon their heads  in small wooden bowls called _carumbes,_ which hold about 15 kilogrammes,  and throw it somewhere where the deposit will not interfere with the  exploitation. Almost all of these men are negroes, who run with their load  upon their head over the white sand, singing some song of their country.  It, is very picturesque, but it is doubtful whether it is economical.    Since the century and a half that these rivers have been dug and redug, it  may be admitted that wherever the cascalho has been easy of access it has  been removed; and that wherever it has not been, little attempt has been  made to work it. How have these attempts, which have doubtless been made  at several periods, come out? This would at present be very difficult to  ascertain. The exploitations have been too numerous to allow us now to  estimate the value of a bed from the data furnished by geology, and local  tradition is too uncertain or exaggerated to allow us to place much  confidence in it.    We can, at the very most, say that if some points still remain intact it  must be because the exploitation of them was too difficult with the  processes that were employed, and this should be a reason, were it desired  to attempt new operations, for having recourse to entirely different modes  of work.    It would seem rational, as regards this, to try to put to profit the  hydraulic power that the flumes and canals render disposable for  mechanically extracting the sand. The field to be worked being naturally  long and narrow, it would be the proper thing to employ a series of  inclined planes distributed along the banks, actuated by water wheels, and  corresponding to so many small working points. The river often flows  through a genuine canon with nearly vertical walls, where space would be  absolutely wanting for installing wheels elsewhere than at the exit of the  canal, and if may become necessary to distribute the power of these wheels  along the works. In these regions of difficult access and few resources it  is necessary to dispense with complicated apparatus, and one might in such  a case, it would seem, try electric motors, whose installation would be  easy. An exploitation in accordance with these ideas was begun for the  first time in 1883 upon the Ribeirao de Inferno at Portao de Ferro. We  shall describe it.    Once established in the country, the first thing to do is to form roads so  as to secure communications with the neighboring villages and forests, and  afterward to cut down trees for building houses. These latter are usually  constructed, for these works, of untrimmed wood and mud, with thatched  roof. There were thus constructed at Portao de Ferro a few kilometers of  roads, then some houses for the engineers and special workmen, barracks  for 200 laborers, stores, kitchens, etc., a forge, and a shop with a lathe  and a saw run by a wheel at the side. It was afterward necessary to repair  the old lateral canal which had been dug out of the rock in the times of  the Royal Extraction, but which had been torn open for a considerable  length. This necessitated the erection of tight walls of dry stone, grass,  and mud, for a length of 200 meters, and with thicknesses of from 6 to 10  meters.    In order to divert the water into this canal, it was necessary to raise  its level 5 meters. The dam, then, had to support a strong pressure, and  it could not be built upon sand. It therefore became necessary to build a  temporary dam and to turn the river into a plank flume, so as to make it  possible to dig at the location of the permanent dam in order to reach a  solid bottom at a depth of nearly 4 meters. The permanent dam thus had a  total height of 10 meters, with a thickness of 15 at the base and 7 at the  top. It was constructed of dry stone, grass, and earth, with the addition  of strong wood-work. The rocks upon which it had to be built were full of  fissures, and when it was desired to close it great leakages of water  occurred, which came near ruining it and necessitated the construction of  a second wall behind it and a talus of earth in front. The dam as shown in  Fig. 1, when finished, had a thickness of 25 meters at the base. It was  closed on the second of July, and had a storage capacity of 55,000 cubic  meters.    The principal excavation was begun at the point where the bed was deepest,  and which consequently the older miners must have had most trouble in  reaching. Here were set up two Letestu pumps that were actuated by a  four-horse wheel.    These pumps lifted 50 cubic meters per hour. All except the pump chambers  and pipes was made of wood on the spot. The water that was lifted was  carried away from the works in a flume 160 meters in length, which  likewise removed the water from the motive wheels.    For the service of the same excavation two simple acting inclined planes  were installed that were moved by a four-horse wheel. Fig. 2 gives a  general view of the arrangement.

From the  _Journal_ of the Society.]    By WM. WEBSTER.      The term sewage many years ago was rightly applied to the excremental  refuse of towns, but it is a most difficult matter to define the liquid  that teems into our rivers under the name of sewage to-day; in most  towns \"chemical refuse\" is the best name for the complex fluid running  from the sewers.    It is now more than ten years since I first commenced a series of  experiments with a view of thoroughly testing various methods of  purifying sewage and water contaminated with putrefying organic matter.  It was while investigating the action of iron salts upon organic matter  in solution and splitting up the chlorides present by means of  electrolysis, that I first became aware of the importance of  precipitating the soluble organic matter in such manner that no chemical  solution should take the place of the precipitated organic matter. If  chemical matter is substituted for the organic compounds, the cure is  worse than the disease, as the resulting solution in most cases sets up  after precipitation in the river into which it flows.    My first electrolytical experiments were conducted with non-oxidizable  plates of platinum and carbon, but the cost of the first and the  impossibility of obtaining carbon plates that would stand long-continued  action of nascent chlorine and oxygen made it desirable that some  modification should be tried. I next tried the effect of electrolytic  action when iron salts were present, but did not think of using iron  electrodes until after trying aluminum. I found that the action of  non-oxidizable electrodes was most efficacious after the temperature of  the fluid acted upon rose 4 deg. or 5 deg.; but the cost of working made it  impossible on a large scale.    After a long series of experiments, iron plates were used as electrodes,  with remarkable results, for the compounds of iron formed not only  deodorized the samples of sewage acted on, but produced complete  precipitation of the matters in suspension, and also of the soluble  organic matter; the resulting effluents remaining perfectly free from  putrefaction. The first part of the process is well illustrated by the  small experiments now shown; the organic matter in suspension and in  solution separates into flocculent particles, which rise to the top of  the liquid and remain until the bubbles of hydrogen which have carried  them up escape, when the solid matter will precipitate. In the  arrangement adopted on a working scale, the separated particles  precipitate readily. As an illustration of the action upon organic  matter in solution I take a small quantity of dye, mix it with water,  and placing the connected iron electrodes in the mixture, the dye in  solution separates into flocculent particles. The electrolytical action  is of course easily understood, but the chemical changes that take place  need an explanation. At the positive pole, hypochlorite of iron seems to  be formed at first, but this is quickly changed into a protochloride,  and as at the negative pole an alkaline reaction takes place, the iron  salt is precipitated in the form of the ferrous hydrated oxide, together  with the organic matters in suspension and solution. Owing to the  carbonates that are always present in sewage, ferrous carbonate is also  formed.    The success of these laboratory experiments led me to a trial of the  process on a larger scale, for hitherto only a gallon at any one time  had been treated.    Small brick tanks were erected at my wharf at Peckham and iron  electrodes fitted to them.    Wrought iron plates were fixed about an inch apart, and connected in  parallel in the tanks, forming one big cell. Sewage to the amount of  about 200 gallons was run into the electrode tank and then treated, the  results being so satisfactory that larger works were erected, when a  supply of sewage equal to 20,000 gallons an hour could be obtained.    After a number of experiments had been carried out it was decided to run  the sewage as rapidly as possible through electrodes, six cells or two  rows in series fixed in a long channel or shoot, for experience showed  that the motion of the liquid acted on reduced the back E.M.F. and  hastened the formation of the precipitate.    A channel is kept at the bottom of the electrodes for the silt to  collect, with a culvert at side to flush it into, so as to prevent any  block occurring; the advantage of this is obvious. The plates in each  section may be from half an inch to an inch thick, and can be of any  length up to 6 ft. It may possibly be objected that a large number of  plates is required. This may be so, but the larger the number of plates,  the less the engine power required, and the longer they last. In each  section the electrodes are in parallel, and any one section is in series  with the other, the arrangement being exactly like that of a series of  primary battery cells.    By actual experience I have been able to prove that at least 25 sections  of electrodes should be in series and across any one of these sections  the potential difference need not be greater than 1.8 volts, the current  being of any desired amount, according to the surface of plates used.    The electrical measurements taken by Dr. John Hopkinson during these  experiments for the Electrical Purification Association, to whom I had  sold my patents, entirely corroborated my contentions as to E.H.P. used,  and agreed with the measurements of the managing electrician, Mr.  Octavius March.    The process was then thoroughly investigated by Sir Henry Roscoe, who  had control of the works for one month. He reports as follows:    \"The reduction of organic matter in solution is the crucial test of the  value of a purifying agent, for unless the organic matter is reduced,  the effluent will putrefy and rapidly become offensive.    \"I have not observed in any of the unfiltered effluents from this  process which I have examined any signs of putrefaction, but, on the  contrary, a tendency to oxidize. The absence of sulphureted hydrogen in  samples of unfiltered effluent, which have been kept for about six weeks  in stoppered bottles, is also a fact of importance. The settled sewage  was not in this condition, as it rapidly underwent putrefaction, even in  contact with air, in two or three days.    \"The results of this chemical investigation show that the chief  advantages of this system of putrefaction are:    \"First.--The active agent, hydrated ferrous oxide, is prepared within  the sewage itself as a flocculent precipitate. (It is scarcely necessary  to add that the inorganic salts in solution are not increased, as in the  case where chemicals in solution are added to the sewage.) Not only does  it act as a mechanical precipitant, but it possesses the property of  combining chemically with some of the soluble organic matter and  carrying it down in an insoluble form.    \"Second.--Hydrated ferrous oxide is a deodorizer.    \"Third.--By this process the soluble organic matter is reduced to a  condition favorable to the further and complete purification by natural  agencies.    \"Fourth.--The effluent is not liable to secondary putrefaction.\"    Mr. Alfred E. Fletcher also investigated the process subsequently, and  reports as follows:    \"The treatment causes a reduction in the oxidizable matter in the  sewage, varying from 60 to 80 per cent. The practical result of the  process is a very rapid and complete clarification of the sewage, which  enables the sludge to separate freely.    \"It was noticed that while the raw sewage filters very slowly, so that  500 c.c. required 96 hours to pass through a paper filter, the  electrically treated sewage settled well and filtered rapidly.    \"Samples of the raw sewage, having but little smell when fresh, stank  strongly on the third day. The treated samples, however, had no smell  originally, and remain sweet, without putrefactive change.    \"In producing this result two agencies are at work, there is the action  of electrolysis and the formation of a hydrated oxide of iron. It is not  possible, perhaps, to define the exact action, but as the formation of  an iron oxide is part of it, it seemed desirable to ascertain whether  the simple addition of a salt of iron with lime sufficient to neutralize  the acid of the salt would produce results similar to those attained by  Webster's process.    \"In order to make these experiments, samples of fresh raw sewage were  taken at Crossness at intervals of one hour during the day. As much as  10 grains of different salts of iron were added per gallon, plus 15.7  grains of lime in some cases and 125 grains of lime in another, and the  treated sewage was allowed to settle twenty-four hours; the results  obtained were not nearly as good as the electrical method.\"    During the present year a very searching investigation of the merits of  various processes of sewage treatment has been made by the corporation  of Salford; among others of my electrical process. As the matter is at  present under discussion by the council, I am not in a position to give  extracts from the reports of the engineers and chemists under whose  supervision and control the work was done, but I may go so far as to say  that the results of my system of electrical treatment have proved its  efficiency and applicability to sewages of even such a foul nature as  that of Salford and Pendleton. The system was controlled continuously  for the corporation by Mr. A. Jacob, B.A., C.E., the borough engineer;  Mr. J. Carter Bell, F.I.C.,"]]]
