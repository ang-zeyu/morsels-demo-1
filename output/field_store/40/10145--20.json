I  beheld thy body, effulgent as the sun, decked with sandal paste! Alas,  grief depriveth me of my senses in beholding thee now besmeared with mud  and dirt! I saw thee before, O king, dressed in silken clothes of pure  white! But I now behold thee dressed in rags! Formerly, O king, pure  food of every kind was carried from thy house on plates of gold for  Brahmanas by thousands! And, O king, food also of the best kind was  formerly given by thee unto ascetics both houseless and living in  domesticity! Formerly, living in thy mansion thou hadst ever filled with  food of every kind plates by thousands, and worshipped the Brahmanas  gratifying every wish of theirs! What peace, O king, can my heart know  in not beholding all this now? And, O great king, these thy brothers,  endued with youth and decked with ear-rings, were formerly fed by cook  with food of the sweet flavour and dressed with skill! Alas, O king, I  now behold them all, so undeserving of woe, living in the woods and upon  what the wood may yield! My heart, O King knoweth no peace! Thinking of  this Bhimasena living in sorrow in the woods, doth not thy anger blaze  up, even though it is time? Why doth not thy anger, O king, blaze up  upon beholding the illustrious Bhimasena who ever performeth everything  unaided, so fallen into distress, though deserving of every happiness?  Why, O king, doth not thy anger blaze up on beholding that Bhima living  in the woods who was formerly surrounded with numerous vehicles and  dressed in costly apparel? This exalted personage is ready to slay all  the Kurus in battle. He beareth, however, all this sorrow, only because  he waiteth for the fufilment of thy promise! This Arjuna, O king, though  possessed of two hands, is equal, for the lightness of his hand in  discharging shafts, to (Kaitavirya) Arjuna of a thousand arms! He is  even (to foes), like unto Yama himself at the end of the _Yuga_! It was  by the prowess of his weapons that all the kings of the earth were made  to wait upon the Brahmanas at thy sacrifice! Beholding that Arjuna that  tiger among men worshipped by both the celestials and the Danavas so  anxious, why, O king, dost thou not feel indignant? I grieve, O Bharata,  that thy wrath doth not blaze up at sight of that son of Pritha in  exile, that prince who deserveth not such distress and who hath been  brought up in every luxury! Why doth not thy wrath blaze up at sight of  that Arjuna in exile, who, on a single car, hath vanquished celestials  and men and serpents? Why, O king, doth not thy wrath blaze up at sight  of that Arjuna in exile who, honoured with offerings of cars and  vehicles of various forms and horses and elephants, forcibly took from  the kings of the earth their treasures, who is the chastiser of all  foes, and who at one impetus can throw full five hundred arrows? Why, O  king, doth not thy wrath blaze up at sight of Nakula, in exile, who so  fair and able-bodied and young, is the foremost of all swordsmen? Why, O  king, dost thou pardon the foe, O Yudhishthira, at sight of Madri's son,  the handsome and brave Sahadeva in exile? Why doth not thy anger blaze  up, O king, it sight of both Nakula and Sahadeva overwhelmed with grief,  though so undeserving of distress? Why also, O king, dost thou pardon  the foe at sight of myself in exile who, born in the race of Drupada  and, therefore, the sister of Dhrishtadyumna, am the daughter-in-law of  the illustrious Pandu and the devoted wife of heroes? Truly, O thou best  of the Bharatas, thou hast no anger, else why is it that thy mind is not  moved at sight of thy brothers and myself (in such distress)? It is said  that there is no Kshatriya in the world who is bereft of anger. I now  behold in thee, however, a refutation of the proverb! That Kshatriya, O  son of Pritha, who discovereth not his energy when the opportunity  cometh, is ever disregarded by all creatures! Therefore, O king, thou  shouldst not extend thy forgiveness to the foe. Indeed, with thy energy,  without doubt, thou mayst slay them all! So also, O king, that Kshatriya  who is not appeased when the time for forgiveness cometh, becometh  unpopular with every creature and meeteth with destruction both in this  and the other world!'\"      SECTION XXVIII    \"Draupadi continued, 'On this subject, the ancient story of the  conversation between Prahlada and Vali, the son of Virochana, is quoted  as an example. One day Vali asked his grand-father Prahlada, the chief  of the Asuras and the Danavas, possessed of great wisdom and well-versed  in the mysteries of the science of duty, saying, \"O sire, is forgiveness  meritorious or might and energy such? I am puzzled as regards this; O  sire, enlighten me who ask thee this! O thou conversant with all duties,  tell me truly which of these is meritorious? I will strictly obey  whatever thy command may be!\" Thus asked (by Vali), his wise  grandfather, conversant with every conclusion, replied upon the whole  subject unto his grand-son who had sought at his hands the resolution of  his doubts. And Prahlada said, \"Know, O child, these two truths with  certainty, viz., that might is not always meritorious and forgiveness  also is not always meritorious! He that forgiveth always suffereth many  evils. Servants and strangers and enemies always disregard him. No  creature ever bendeth down unto him. Therefore it is, O child, that the  learned applaud not a constant habit of forgiveness! The servants of an  ever-forgiving person always disregard him, and contract numerous  faults. These mean-minded men also seek to deprive him of his wealth.  Vile-souled servants also appropriate to themselves his vehicles and  clothes and ornaments and apparel and beds and seats and food and drink  and other articles of use. They do not also at the command of their  master, give unto others the things they are directed to give. Nor do  they even worship their master with that respect which is their master's  due. Disregard in this world is worse than death. O child, sons and  servants and attendants and even strangers speak harsh words unto the  man who always forgiveth. Persons, disregarding the man of an  ever-forgiving temper, even desire his wife, and his wife also, becometh  ready to act as she willeth. And servants also that are ever fond of  pleasure, if they do not receive even slight punishments from their  master, contract all sorts of vices, and the wicked ever injure such a  master. These and many other demerits attach to those that are  ever-forgiving!    \"'\"Listen now, O son of Virochana, to the demerits of those that are  never forgiving! The man of wrath who, surrounded by darkness, always  inflicteth, by help of his own energy, various kinds of punishment on  persons whether they deserve them or not, is necessarily separated from  his friends in consequence of that energy of his. Such a man is hated by  both relatives and strangers. Such a man, because he insulteth others,  suffereth loss of wealth and reapeth disregard and sorrow and hatred and  confusion and enemies. The man of wrath, in consequence of his ire,  inflicteth punishments on men and obtaineth (in return) harsh words. He  is divested of his prosperity soon and even of life, not to say, of  friends and relatives. He that putteth forth his might both upon his  benefactor and his foe, is an object of alarm to the world, like a snake  that hath taken shelter in a house, to the inmates thereof. What  prosperity can he have who is an object of alarm to the world? People  always do him an injury when they find a hole. Therefore, should men  never exhibit might in excess nor forgiveness on all occasions. One  should put forth his might and show his forgiveness on proper occasions.  He that becometh forgiving at the proper time and harsh and mighty also  at the proper time, obtaineth happiness both in this world and the  other.    \"'\"I shall now indicate the occasions in detail of forgiveness, as laid  down by the learned, and which should ever be observed by all. Hearken  unto me as I speak! He that hath done thee a service, even if he is  guilty of a grave wrong unto thee, recollecting his former service,  shouldst thou forgive that offender. Those also that have become  offenders from ignorance and folly should be forgiven for learning and  wisdom are not always easily attainable by man. They that having  offended thee knowingly, plead ignorance should be punished, even if  their offences be trivial. Such crooked men should never be pardoned.  The first offence of every creature should be forgiven. The second  offence, however, should be punished, even if it be trivial. If,  however, a person committeth an offence unwillingly, it hath been said  that examining his plea well by a judicious enquiry, he should be  pardoned. Humility may vanquish might, humility may vanquish weakness.  There is nothing that humility may not accomplish. Therefore, humility  is truly fiercer (than it seemeth)! One should act with reference to  place and time, taking note of his own might or weakness. Nothing can  succeed that hath been undertaken without reference to place and time.  Therefore, do thou ever wait for place and time! Sometimes offenders  should be forgiven from fear of the people. These have been declared to  be times of forgiveness. And it hath been said that on occasions besides  these, might should be put forth against transgressors.\"'    \"Draupadi continued, 'I, therefore, regard, O king, that the time hath  come for thee to put forth thy might! Unto those Kurus the covetous sons  of Dhritarashtra who injure us always, the present is not the time for  forgiveness! It behoveth thee to put forth thy might. The humble and  forgiving person is disregarded; while those that are fierce persecute  others. He, indeed, is a king who hath recourse to both, each according  to its time!'\"      SECTION XXIX    \"Yudhishthira said, 'Anger is the slayer of men and is again their  prosperor."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11924"],[0,"The Loves of Krishna in Indian Painting and Poetry (#17)"],[1," in  the story, we begin to approach the Krishna of Indian painting.    Such a change can hardly have come about without historical reasons and  although the exact circumstances must perhaps remain obscure, we can see  in this sharp reversal of roles a clear response to certain Indian needs.  From early times, romantic love had been keenly valued, Sanskrit poets  such as Kalidasa, Amaru and Bhartrihari celebrating the charms of womanly  physique and the raptures of sex. What, in fact, in other cultures had  been viewed with suspicion or disquiet was here invested with nobility and  grandeur. Although fidelity had been demanded in marriage, romantic  liaisons had not been entirely excluded and thus there was a sense in  which the love-poetry of the early Indian middle ages had been partly  paralleled by actual courtly or village practice. From the tenth century  onwards, however, a tightening of domestic morals had set in, a tightening  which was further intensified by the Muslim invasions of the twelfth and  thirteen centuries. Romance as an actual experience became more difficult  of attainment and this was exacerbated by standard views of marriage. In  early India, marriage had been regarded as a contract between families  and romantic love between husband and wife as an accidental, even an  unexpected product of what was basically a utilitarian agreement. With the  seclusion of women and the laying of even greater stress on wifely  chastity, romantic love was increasingly denied. Yet the need for romance  remained and we can see in the prevalence of love-poetry a substitute for  wishes repressed in actual life.[48] It is precisely this role which the  story of Krishna the cowherd lover now came to perform. Krishna, being  God, had been beyond morals and hence had practised conduct which, if  indulged in by men, might well have been wrong. He had given practical  expression to romantic longings and had behaved with all the passionate  freedom normally stifled by social duty, conjugal ethics and family  morals. From this point of view, Krishna the prince was a mere pillar of  boring respectability. Nothing in his conduct could arouse delight for  everything he did was correct and proper. Krishna the cowherd on the  other hand, was spontaneous, irresponsible and free. His love for the  cowgirls had had a lively freedom. The love between them was nothing if  not voluntary. His whole life among the cowherds was simple, natural and  pleasing and as their rapturous lover nothing was more obvious than that  the cowgirls should adore him. In dwelling, then, on Krishna, it was  natural that the worshipper should tend to disregard the prince and should  concentrate instead on the cowherd. The prince had revered Brahmans and  supported established institutions. The cowherd had shamed the Brahmans of  Mathura and discredited ceremonies and festivals. He had loved and been  loved and in his contemplation lay nothing but joy. The loves of Krishna,  in fact, were an intimate fulfilment of Indian desires, an exact  sublimation of intense romantic needs and while other factors must  certainly have played their part, this is perhaps the chief reason why,  at this juncture, they now enchanted village and courtly India.    The results of this new approach are apparent in two distinct ways. The  _Bhagavata Purana_ continues to be the chief chronicle of Krishna's  acts but the last half of Book Ten and all of Book Eleven fall into  neglect.[49] In their place, the story of Krishna's relations with the  cowgirls is given new poignancy and precision. Radha is constantly  mentioned and in all the incidents in the _Purana_ involving cowgirls,  it is she who is given pride of place. At the river Jumna, when Krishna  removes the cowgirls' clothes, Radha begs him to restore them. At the  circular dance in which he joins with all the cowgirls, Radha receives his  first attentions, dancing with him in the centre. When Krishna is about to  leave for Mathura, it is Radha who heads the cowgirls and strives to detain  him. She serves, in fact, as a symbol of all the cowgirls' love. At the  same time, she is very far from being merely their spokesman or leader and  while the later texts dwell constantly on her rapturous love-making with  Krishna, they also describe her jealousy when Krishna makes love to other  girls. Indeed the essence of their romance is that it includes a temporary  estrangement and only after Krishna has neglected Radha, flirted with  other cowgirls and then returned to her is their understanding complete.    The second result is the allegorical interpretation which Krishna's  romances now received. In Christian literature, the longing of the soul  for God was occasionally expressed in terms of sexual imagery--the works  of the Spanish mystic, St. John of the Cross, including 'songs of the  soul in rapture at having arrived at the height of perfection which is  union with God.'      Oh night that was my guide!    Oh darkness dearer than the morning's pride,    Oh night that joined the lover    To the beloved bride    Transfiguring them each into the other.      Within my flowering breast    Which only for himself entire I save    He sank into his rest    And all my gifts I gave    Lulled by the airs with which the cedars wave.[50]    This same approach was now to clarify Radha's romance with Krishna. Radha,  it was held, was the soul while Krishna was God. Radha's sexual passion  for Krishna symbolized the soul's intense longing and her willingness to  commit adultery expressed the utter priority which must be accorded to  love for God. If ultimate union was symbolized by romantic love, then  clearly nothing could approach such love in ultimate significance. In  deserting their husbands and homes and wilfully committing adultery, Radha  and the cowgirls were therefore illustrating a profound religious truth.  Not only was their adultery proof of Krishna's charm, it was vital to the  whole story. By worldly standards, they were committing the gravest of  offences but they were doing it for Krishna who was God himself. They were  therefore setting God above home and duty, they were leaving everything  for love of God and in surrendering their honour, were providing the most  potent symbol of what devotion meant. This approach explained other  details. Krishna's flute was the call of God which caused the souls of  men, the cowgirls, to forsake their worldly attachments and rush to love  him. In removing the clothes of the cowgirls and requiring them to come  before him naked, he was demonstrating the innocent purity with which the  soul should wait on God. In himself neglecting Radha and toying with the  cowgirls, he was proving, on one level, the power of worldly pleasures to  seduce the soul but on another level, the power of God to love every soul  irrespective of its character and status. From this point of view, the  cowgirls were as much the souls of men as Radha herself and to demonstrate  God's all-pervasive love, Krishna must therefore love not only Radha but  every cowgirl. Equally, in the circular dance, by inducing every cowgirl  to think that she and she alone was his partner, Krishna was proving how  God is available to all. Finally it was realized that even those portions  of the story which, at first sight, seemed cruel and callous were also  susceptible of religious interpretation. When Radha has been loved in the  forest and then is suddenly deserted, the reason is her pride--pride that  because Krishna has loved her, she can assert herself by asking to be  carried. Such assertiveness is incompatible with the kind of humble  adoration necessary for communion with God. To prove this, therefore,  Radha's pride must be destroyed and Krishna resorts to this seemingly  brusque desertion. Action, in fact, which by human standards would be  reprehensible is once again a means for imparting spiritual wisdom. In a  similar way, Krishna's departure for Mathura and final abandonment of the  cowgirls was accorded a religious interpretation. At one level, his  departure symbolized 'the dark night of the soul,' the experience which  comes to every devotee when, despite the most ardent longing, the vision  fades. At another level, it illustrated how life must be lived when God or  Vishnu was no longer on earth. If Krishna's love-making was intended to  symbolize the ultimate rapture, his physical absence corresponded to  conditions as they normally existed. In instructing the cowgirls to  meditate upon him in their minds, Krishna was only attuning them to life  as it must necessarily appear after he has left the human stage.    It was these conceptions which governed the cult of Krishna from the  twelfth century onwards and, as we shall shortly see, informed the poems  which were now to celebrate his love for Radha.    [Footnote 46: Note 15.]    [Footnote 47: Note 16.]    [Footnote 48: Note 17.]    [Footnote 49: I.e. the whole of Krishna's career after his destruction of  the tyrant.]    [Footnote 50: Roy Campbell, _The Poems of St. John of the Cross_ (London,  1951), 11-12.]        (ii) The Gita Govinda      The first poem to express this changed conception is the _Gita  Govinda_--the Song of the Cowherd--a Sanskrit poem written by the Bengali  poet, Jayadeva, towards the close of the twelfth century. Its subject is  the estrangement of Radha and Krishna caused by Krishna's love for other  cowgirls, Radha's anguish at Krishna's neglect and lastly the rapture  which attends their final reunion. Jayadeva describes Radha's longing and  Krishna's love-making with glowing sensuality yet the poem reverts  continually to praise of Krishna as God.      If in recalling Krishna to mind there is flavour    Or if there is interest in love's art    Then to this necklace of words--sweetness,      tenderness, brightness--    The words of Jayadeva, listen.
