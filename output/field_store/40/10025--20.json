Variation of the Compass 8 degrees 45 minutes West. Wind South-East,  variable, North-East; course South 2 degrees East; distance 72 miles;  latitude 5 degrees 38 minutes North, longitude 23 degrees 45 minutes  West; at noon, Bonavista, South-East point, North 5 degrees 15 minutes  East, 208 leagues.    Monday, 17th. Variable, light Airs and Calm clear weather. 1/2 past 1  p.m. took two Distances of the sun and moon, the first of which gave the  Longitude 23 degrees 45 minutes 56 seconds, and the last 23 degrees 44  minutes West, the difference being not quite two miles, which shows how  near to one another these observations can be made. Wind South,  South-East, variable; course South by West 1/2 West; distance 11 miles;  latitude 5 degrees 17 minutes North, longitude 23 degrees 47 minutes  West; at noon, Bonavista, South-East point, North 5 degrees 15 minutes  East, 212 leagues.    Tuesday, 18th. Sometimes little wind, sometimes Squally, with rain and  Lightning. Wind South to East-South-East; course South 48 degrees West;  distance 45 miles; latitude 4 degrees 47 Minutes North, longitude 24  degrees 23 minutes West; at noon, Bonavista, South-East point, North 12  degrees East, 229 leagues.    Wednesday, 19th. Fresh breezes and Cloudy weather. The Observed Latitude  to the Northward of that given by the Log 9 miles, which I suppose must  be owing to a Current. Wind South by East to South-East by South; course  South 42 degrees West; distance 88 miles; latitude 3 degrees 44 minutes  North, longitude 25 degrees 23 minutes West; at noon, Bonavista,  South-East point, North 14 degrees East, 253 leagues.    Thursday, 20th. A Genteel gale and Clear weather. At a little before 5  p.m. had an Observation of the sun and moon, which gave the Longitude 25  degrees 46 minutes West from Greenwich, which is more Westerly than that  by account carried on from the last Observation; and the Observed  latitude being again to the Northward shows that there must be a current  setting between the North and West. Wind South by East to South-East by  South; course South 52 degrees West; distance 48 miles; latitude 3  degrees 16 minutes North, longitude 26 degrees 20 minutes West; at noon,  Bonavista, North 18 degrees 30 minutes East, 270 leagues.    [Crossing Equator.]    Friday, 21st. A moderate breeze, and for the most part clear weather.  Longitude per the Mean of 2 Observations of the sun and moon made at 4  hours 45 minutes and at 4 hours 54 minutes p.m., 26 degrees 33 minutes  West. Variation of the Compass 4 degrees 7 minutes West, and the Observed  Latitude at Noon to the Northward of the Log 7 Miles. Wind South-East to  South-South-East; course South 58 degrees West; distance 57 miles;  latitude 2 degrees 46 minutes North, longitude 27 degrees 11 minutes  West; at noon, Bonavista South-East point, North 21 degrees East, 281  leagues.    Saturday, 22nd. Moderate breezes and fine, pleasant weather. Variation 3  degrees 17 minutes West. Wind South-East by South; course South 43  degrees 15 minutes West; distance 87 miles; latitude 1 degree 40 minutes  North, longitude 28 degrees 12 minutes West; at noon, Bonavista,  South-East point, North 23 degrees East, 312 leagues.    Sunday, 23rd. A moderate, Steady breeze and fine Clear weather. The Ship  by Observation at Noon is 8 Miles to the Northward of the Log. Wind  South-South-East; course South; distance 5 miles; latitude 1 degree 40  minutes North, longitude 28 degrees 12 West; at noon, Bonavista,  South-East point, North 23 degrees East, 312 leagues.    Monday, 24th. First part ditto weather; remainder fresh Breezes and  Cloudy, with some flying Showers of rain. Variation per Azimuth this  morning 3 degrees West. At Noon by Observation found the Ship 11 Miles  ahead of the Log. Wind South by East to South-East by South; course South  49 degrees West; distance 50 miles; latitude 1 degree 7 minutes North;  longitude 28 degrees 50 minutes West; at noon, Bonavista, South-East  point, North 25 degrees East, 328 leagues.    Tuesday, 25th. A Genteel breeze and Clear weather, with a Moist Air. Soon  after sunrise found the Variation of the Compass to be 2 degrees 24  minutes West, being the Mean result of several very good Azimuths. This  was just before we crossed the Line in the Longitude of 29 degrees 29  minutes West from Greenwich. We also try'd the Diping Needle belonging to  the Royal Society, and found the North point to Dip 26 degrees below the  Horizon; but this Instrument cannot be used at Sea to any great degree of  accuracy on account of the Motion of the Ship, which hinders the Needle  from resting. However, as the Ship was pretty steady, and by means of a  Swinging Table I had made for that purpose, we could be Certain of the  Dip to two Degrees at most. The Observed Latitude and that by account  nearly Agree. Wind South-East to South-East by East; course South 30  degrees West; distance 95 miles; latitude 0 degrees 15 minutes South,  longitude 29 degrees 30 minutes West; at noon, Bonavista, South-East  point, North 26 degrees East, 358 leagues.    Wednesday, 26th. First part light Airs and Cloudy weather, the remainder  a Moderate Breeze and Cloudy. After we had got an observation, and it was  no longer Doubted that we were to the Southward of the Line, the Ceremony  on this occasion practis'd by all Nations was not Omitted. Every one that  could not prove upon the Sea Chart that he had before Crossed the Line  was either to pay a Bottle of Rum or be Duck'd in the Sea, which former  case was the fate of by far the Greatest part on board; and as several of  the Men chose to be Duck'd, and the weather was favourable for that  purpose, this Ceremony was performed on about 20 or 30, to the no small  Diversion of the Rest. Wind South-East to South-South-East; course South  31 degrees West; distance 77 miles; latitude 1 degree 21 minutes South,  longitude 30 degrees 18 minutes West; at noon, Bonavista, South-East  point, North 25 degrees 30 minutes East, 385 leagues.    Thursday, 27th. Fresh Gales and Close Cloudy weather. Variation 2 degrees  48 minutes West. Wind South-South-East to South-East; course South 38  degrees 15 minutes West; distance 79 miles; latitude 2 degrees 23 minutes  South, longitude 31 degrees 7 minutes West; at noon, Bonavista,  South-East point, North 26 degrees East, 410 leagues.    Friday, 28th. Fresh Breeze and fine Clear weather. At a little past 1  a.m. Longitude in by the 3 following Observations--viz., by the Moon and  the star Arietis, 32 degrees 27 minutes; by the Moon and Pollux, 32  degrees 0 minutes 15 seconds; by ditto, 31 degrees 48 minutes 32 seconds;  the mean of the whole is 32 degrees 5 minutes 16 seconds West from  Greenwich, which is 31 minutes more Westerly than the longitude by  account carried on since the last Observation. The two first observations  were made and computed by Mr. Green, and the last by myself. The star  Arietis was on one side of the Moon and Pollux on the other. This day at  Noon, being nearly in the latitude of the Island Ferdinand Noronha, to  the Westward of it by some Charts and to the Eastward by others, was in  Expectation of seeing it or some of those Shoals that are laid down in  most Charts between it and the Main; but we saw neither one nor a Nother.  We certainly passed to the Eastward of the Island, and as to the Shoals,  I don't think they Exhist, grounding this my Opinion on the Journal of  some East India Ships I have seen who were detain'd by Contrary winds  between this Island and the Main, and being 5 or 6 Ships in Company,  doubtless must have seen some of them did they lay as Marked in the  Charts.* (* There is a very dangerous reef, As Rocas, 80 miles west of  Fernando Noronha. The Endeavour passed 60 miles east of latter.) Wind  South-East to South-East by East; course South 33 degrees West; distance  93 miles, latitude 3 degrees 41 minutes South, longitude 32 degrees 29  minutes West.    Saturday, 29th. Fresh Breezes and pleasant weather. Variation of the  Compass 2 degrees 25 minutes West. Wind East-South-East; course South by  West; distance 101 miles; latitude 5 degrees 25 minutes South, longitude  32 degrees 48\" West.    Sunday, 30th. A Steady breeze, and for the most part close cloudy  weather. Variation by several Azimuths 1 degree 31 minutes West. At noon  the observed latitude 7 miles southward of account. Wind East-South-East;  course South 3/4 West; distance 107 miles; latitude 7 degrees 8 minutes  South, longitude 33 degrees 4 minutes West.    Monday, 31st. A Fresh breeze and Clear weather. Variation 0 degrees 15  minutes West. Observed Latitude again to the Southward of the Log. Wind  East to East-South-East; course, South 1/2 West; distance 114 miles;  latitude 9 degrees 1 minute South, longitude 33 degrees 16 minutes West.    [November 1768. Between Equator and Rio.]    Tuesday, November 1st. Moderate breezes, for the most part Cloudy.  Variation by the mean of Several Azimuths 0 degrees 58 minutes West in  the Evening, and in the Morning found it to be 0 degrees 18 minutes West.  Wind East-South-East; course South 3/4 West; distance 98 miles; latitude  10 degrees 38 minutes South.    Wednesday, 2nd. A Steady breeze and fine pleasant weather. This  Afternoon, by the mean of Several Azimuths and the Amplitude, found the  Variation to be 0 degrees 34 minutes East, from which it appears that  about the aforegoing Noon we have Crossed the Line of no Variation in the  Latitude of 10 degrees 38 minutes South, and, according to the following  Observations, in 32 degrees 0 minutes West longitude from Greenwich. At 5  hours 5 minutes 0 seconds Apparent time a.m. the longitude of the Ship  and the Observation of the moon and the star Aldebaran was found to be 32  "]]]
