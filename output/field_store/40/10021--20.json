And sometimes stretching their arms and  sometimes drawing them close, and now raising them up and now dropping  them down, they began to seize each other. And striking neck against  neck and forehead against forehead, they caused fiery sparks to come  out like flashes of lightning. And grasping each other in various ways  by means of their arms, and kicking each other with such violence as to  affect the innermost nerves, they struck at each other's breasts with  clenched fists. With bare arms as their only weapons roaring like  clouds they grasped and struck each other like two mad elephants  encountering each other with their trunks. Incensed at each other's  blow, they fought on dragging and pushing each other and fiercely  looking at each other like two wrathful lions. And each striking every  limb of the other with his own and using his arms also against the  other, and catching hold of each other's waist, they hurled each other  to a distance. Accomplished in wrestling, the two heroes clasping each  other with their arms and each dragging the other unto himself, began  to press each other with great violence. The heroes then performed  those grandest of all feats in wrestling called Prishtabhanga, which  consisted in throwing each other down with face towards the earth and  maintaining the one knocked down in that position as long as possible.  And employing his arms, each also performed the feats called  Sampurna-murchcha and Purna-kumbha. At times they twisted each other's  arms and other limbs as if these were vegetable fibres that were to be  twisted into chords. And with clenched fists they struck each other at  times, pretending to aim at particular limbs while the blows descended  upon other parts of the body. It was thus that those heroes fought with  each other. The citizens consisting of thousands, of Brahmanas,  Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras, and even women and the aged, O tiger  among men, came out and gathered there to behold the fight. And the  crowd became so great that it was one solid mass of humanity with no  space between body and body. The sound the wrestlers made by the  slapping of their arms, the seizing of each other's necks for bringing  each other down, and the grasping of each other's legs for dashing each  other to the ground, became so loud that it resembled the roar of  thunder or of falling cliffs. Both of them were foremost of mighty men,  and both took great delight in such encounter. Desirous of vanquishing  the other, each was on the alert for taking advantage of the slightest  lapse of the other. And, O monarch, the mighty Bhima and Jarasandha  fought terribly on in those lists, driving the crowd at times by the  motions of their hands like Vritra and Vasava of old. Thus two heroes,  dragging each other forward and pressing each other backward and with  sudden jerks throwing each other face downward and sideways, mangled  each other dreadfully. And at times they struck each other with their  knee-joints. And addressing each other loudly in stinging speeches,  they struck each other with clenched fists, the blows descending like a  mass of stone upon each other. With broad shoulders and long arms and  both well-skilled in wrestling encounters, they struck each other with  those long arms of theirs that were like maces of iron. That encounter  of the heroes commenced on the first (lunar) day of the month of Kartic  (October) and the illustrious heroes fought on without intermission and  food, day and night, till the thirteenth lunar day. It was on the night  of the fourteenth of the lunar fortnight that the monarch of Magadha  desisted from fatigue. And O king, Janardana beholding the monarch  tired, addressed Bhima of terrible deeds, and as if to stimulate him  said,--'O son of Kunti, a foe that is fatigued cannot be pressed for if  pressed at such a time he may even die. Therefore, O son of Kunti, this  king should not be oppressed by thee. On the other hand, O bull of the  Bharata race, fight with him with thy arms, putting forth as much  strength only as thy antagonist hath now left!' Then that slayer of  hostile heroes, the son of Pandu, thus addressed by Krishna, understood  the plight of Jarasandha and forthwith resolved upon taking his life.  And that foremost of all men endued with strength, that prince of the  Kuru race, desirous of vanquishing the hitherto unvanquished  Jarasandha, mustered all his strength and courage.\"      SECTION XXIV    Vaisampayana said,--\"thus addressed, Bhima firmly resolved upon slaying  Jarasandha, replied unto Krishna of the Yadu race, saying,--'O tiger of  the Yadu race, O Krishna, this wretch that yet stayeth before me with  sufficient strength and bent upon fight, should not be forgiven by me.'  Hearing these words of Vrikodara (Bhima), that tiger among men,  Krishna, desiring to encourage that hero to accomplish the death of  Jarasandha without any delay, answered,--'O Bhima, exhibit today upon  Jarasandha the strength thou hast luckily derived, the might thou hast  obtained from (thy father), the god Maruta.' Thus addressed by Krishna,  Bhima, that slayer of foes, holding up in the air the powerful  Jarasandha, began to whirl him on high. And, O bull of the Bharata  race, having so whirled him in the air full hundred times, Bhima  pressed his knee against Jarasandha's backbone and broke his body in  twain. And having killed him thus, the mighty Vrikodara uttered a  terrible roar. And the roar of the Pandava mingling with that death  knell of Jarasandha, while he was being broken on Bhima's knee, caused  a loud uproar that struck fear into the heart of every creature. And  all the citizens of Magadha became dumb with terror and many women were  even prematurely delivered. And hearing those roars, the people of  Magadha thought that either the Himavat was tumbling down or the earth  itself was being rent asunder. And those oppressors of all foes then,  leaving the lifeless body of the king at the palace gate where he lay  as one asleep, went out of the town. And Krishna, causing Jarasandha's  car furnished with an excellent flagstaff to be made ready and making  the brothers (Bhima and Arjuna) ride in it, went in and released his  (imprisoned) relatives. And those kings rescued from terrible fate,  rich in the possession of jewels, approaching Krishna made presents  unto him of jewels and gems. And having vanquished his foe, Krishna  furnished with weapons and unwounded and accompanied by the kings (he  had released), came out of Girivraja riding in that celestial car (of  Jarasandha). And he also who could wield the bow with both hands  (Arjuna), who was incapable of being vanquished by any of the monarchs  on earth, who was exceedingly handsome in person and well-skilled in  the destruction of the foe, accompanied by the possessor of great  strength (Bhima), came out of that fort with Krishna driving the car  whereon he rode. And that best of cars, incapable of being vanquished  by any king, ridden in by those warriors Bhima and Arjuna, and driven  by Krishna, looked exceedingly handsome. Indeed, it was upon that car  that Indra and Vishnu had fought of old in the battle (with the Asuras)  in which Taraka (the wife of Vrihaspati) had become the immediate cause  of much slaughter. And riding upon that car Krishna now came out of the  hill-fort. Possessed of the splendour of heated gold, and decked with  rows of jingling bells and furnished with wheels whose clatter was like  the roar of clouds, and ever victorious in battle, and always  slaughtering the foe against whom it was driven, it was that very car  riding upon which Indra had slain ninety-nine Asuras of old. And those  bulls among men (the three cousins) having obtained that car became  exceedingly glad. The people of Magadha, behold the long-armed Krishna  along with the two brothers, seated in that car (of Jarasandha)  wondered much. O Bharata, that car, whereunto were yoked celestial  horses and which possessed the speed of the wind, thus ridden upon by  Krishna, looked exceedingly beautiful. And upon that best of cars was a  flag-staff without being visibly attached thereto, and which was the  product of celestial skill. And the handsome flag-staff, possessed of  the splendour of the rainbow, could be seen from the distance of a  yojana. And Krishna while coming out, thought of Garuda. And Garuda,  thought of by his master, came thither in no time, like a tree of vast  proportions standing in a village worshipped by all. Garuda of immense  weight of body and living upon snakes sat upon that excellent car along  with the numberless open-mouthed and frightfully-roaring creatures on  its flag-staff. And thereupon that best of cars became still more  dazzling with its splendour and was as incapable of being looked at by  created being as the midday sun surrounded by a thousand rays. And, O  king, such was that best of flag-staffs of celestial make that it never  struck against any tree nor could any weapon injure it at all even  though visible to men's eyes. And Achyuta, that tiger among men, riding  with the two sons of Pandu upon that celestial car, the clatter of  whose wheels was like the roar of the clouds, came out of Girivraja.  The car upon which Krishna rode had been obtained by king Vasu from  Vasava, and from Vasu by Vrihadratha, and from the latter in due course  by king Jarasandha. And he of long arms and eyes like lotus-petals and  possessed of illustrious reputation, coming out of Girivraja, stopped  (for some time) on a level plain outside the town. And, O king, all the  citizens then, with the Brahmanas at their head, hastened thither to  adore him with due religious rites. And the kings who had been released  from confinement worshipped the slayer of Madhu with reverence, and  addressing him"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7978"],[0,"Legends, Traditions, and Laws of the Iroquois, or Six Nations, and History of (#16)"],[1,"stock to range, or stock  actually ranging on the Indians' lands, shall, and are hereby declared,  to be liable and subject to the like penalties and forfeitures, and may  be proceeded against in the same manner, and subject to the same  recoveries, as by the law of this province stock driven or ranging upon  any white people's land are liable and subject to; and the said Indians  shall and may enjoy the benefit of the laws in that case made and  provided, in the same manner as the white people do or can, any law,  usage, or custom, to the contrary notwithstanding.\"    LAWS OF NORTH CAROLINA.
