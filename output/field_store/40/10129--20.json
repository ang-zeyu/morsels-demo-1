This cheerful prospect was in the mind of these men, for, when we  espied coming around a distant corner two gray-looking men on  horseback, they turned white as the chauffeur cried, \"Uhlans!\"    It is a question whether the car or our hearts came to a dead  standstill first. Our shock was unnecessary. They proved to be  Belgians, and assured us that the road was clear all the way to  Termonde; and, except for an occasional peasant tilling his fields,  the country-side was quite deserted until at Grembergen we came  upon an unending procession of refugees streaming down the  road. They were all coming out of Termonde. Termonde, after  being taken and retaken, bombarded and burned, was for the  moment neutral territory. A Belgian commandant had allowed the  refugees that morning to return and gather what they might from  among the ruins.    In the early morning, then, they had gone into the city, and now at  high noon they were pouring out, a great procession of the  dispossessed. They came tracking their way to where--God only  knows. All they knew was that in their hearts was set the fear of  Uhlans, and in the sky the smoke and flames of their burning  homesteads. They came laden with their lares and penates,--  mainly dogs, feather beds, and crayon portraits of their ancestors.    Women came carrying on their heads packs which looked like  their entire household paraphernalia. The men were more  unassuming, and, as a rule, carried a package considerably lighter  and comporting more with their superior masculine dignity. I recall  one little woman in particular. She was bearing a burden heavy  enough to send a strong American athlete staggering down to the  ground, while at her side majestically marched her faithful knight,  bearing a bird-cage, and there wasn't any bird in it, either.    Nothing could be more mirth-provoking than that sight; yet,  strangely enough, the most tear-compelling memory of the war is  connected with another bird-cage. Two children rummaging  through their ruined home dug it out of the debris. In it was their  little pet canary. While fire and smoke rolled through the house it  had beat its wings against the bars in vain. Its prison had become  its tomb. Its feathers were but slightly singed, yet it was dead with  that pathetic finality which attaches itself to only a dead bird--its  silver songs and flutterings, once the delight of the children, now  stilled forever.    The photographers had long looked for what they termed a first-  class sob-picture. Here it was par excellent. The larger child stood  stroking the feathers of her pet and murmuring over and over  \"Poor Annette,\" \"Poor Annette!\" Then the smaller one snuggling  the limp little thing against her neck wept inconsolably.    Instead of seizing their opportunity, the movie man was clearing  his throat while the free lance was busy on what he said was a  cinder in his eye. Yet this very man had brought back from the  Balkan War of 1907 a prime collection of horrors; corpses thrown  into the death-cart with arms and legs sticking out like so much  stubble; the death-cart creeping away with its ghastly load; and the  dumping together of bodies of men and beasts into a pit to be  eaten by the lime. This man who had gone through all this with  good nerve was now touched to tears by two children crying over  their pet canary. There are some things that are too much for the  heart of even a war-photographer.    To give the whole exodus the right tragic setting, one is tempted to  write that tears were streaming down all the faces of the refugees,  but on the contrary, indeed, most of them carried a smile and a  pipe, and trudged stolidly along, much as though bound for a fair.  Some of our pictures show laughing refugees. That may not be  fair, for man is so constituted that the muscles of his face  automatically relax to the click of the camera. But as I recall that  pitiful procession, there was in it very little outward expression of  sorrow.    Undoubtedly there was sadness enough in all their hearts, but  people in Europe have learned to live on short rations; they rarely  indulge in luxuries like weeping, but bear the most unwonted  afflictions as though they were the ordinary fortunes of life. War  has set a new standard for grief. So these victims passed along  the road, but not before the record of their passing was etched for  ever on our moving-picture films. The coming generation will not  have to reconstruct the scene from the colored accounts of the  journalist, but with their own eyes they can see the hegira of the  homeless as it really was.    The resignation of the peasant in the face of the great calamity  was a continual source of amazement to us. Zola in \"Le Debacle\"  puts into his picture of the battle of Sedan an old peasant plowing  on his farm in the valley. While shells go screaming overhead he  placidly drives his old white horse through the accustomed  furrows. One naturally presumed that this was a dramatic touch of  the great novelist. But similar incidents we saw in this Great War  over and over again.    We were with Consul van Hee one morning early before the  clinging veil of sleep had lifted from our spirits or the mists from the  low-lying meadows. Without warning our car shot through a bank  of fog into a spectacle of medieval splendor--a veritable Field of  the Cloth of Gold, spread out on the green plains of Flanders.    A thousand horses strained at their bridles while their thousand  riders in great fur busbies loomed up almost like giants. A  thousand pennons stirred in the morning air while the sun burning  through the mists glinted on the tips of as many lances. The crack  Belgian cavalry divisions had been gathered here just behind the  firing-lines in readiness for a sortie; the Lancers in their cherry and  green and the Guides in their blue and gold making a blaze of  color.    It was as if in a trance we had been carried back to a tourney of  ancient chivalry--this was before privations and the new drab  uniforms had taken all glamour out of the war. As we gazed upon  the glittering spectacle the order from the commander came to us:    \"Back, back out of danger!\"    \"Forward!\" was the charge to the Lancers.    The field-guns rumbled into line and each rider unslung his  carbine. Putting spurs to the horses, the whole line rode past  saluting our Stars and Stripes with a \"Vive L'Amerique.\" Bringing  up the rear two cassocked priests served to give this pageantry a  touch of prophetic grimness.    And yet as the cavalcade swept across the fields thrilling us with its  color and its action, the nearby peasants went on spreading  fertilizer quite as calm and unconcerned as we were exhilarated.    \"Stupid,\" \"Clods,\" \"Souls of oxen,\" we commented, yet a  protagonist of the peasant might point out that it was perhaps as  noble and certainly quite as useful to be held by a passion for the  soil as to be caught by the glamour of men riding out to slaughter.  And Zola puts this in the mind of his peasants.    \"Why should I lose a day? Soldiers must fight, but folks must live.  It is for me to keep the corn growing.\"    Deep down into the soil the peasant strikes his roots. Urban  people can never comprehend when these roots are cut away how  hopelessly-lost and adrift this European peasant in particular  becomes. Wicked as the Great War has seemed to us in its  bearing down upon these innocent folks, yet we can never  understand the cruelty that they have suffered in being uprooted  from the land and sent forth to become beggars and wanderers  upon the highroads of the world.          Chapter X    The Little Belgian Who Said, \"You Betcha\"        In the fighting around Termonde the bridge over the Scheldt had  been three times blown up and three times reconstructed. Wires  now led to explosives under the bridge on the Termonde side, and  on the side held by the Belgians they led to a table in the room of  the commanding officer. In this table was an electric button. By the  button stood an officer. The entrance of the Germans on that  bridge was the signal for the officer to push that button, and thus to  blow both bridge and Germans into bits.    But the Belgians were taking no chances. If by any mishap that  electric connection should fail them, it would devolve upon the  artillery lined upon the bank to rake the bridge with shrapnel. A  roofed-over trench ran along the river like a levee and bristled with  machine guns whose muzzles were also trained upon the bridge.  Full caissons of ammunition were standing alongside, ready to  feed the guns their death-dealing provender, and in the rear, all  harnessed, were the horses, ready to bring up more caissons.    Though in the full blaze of day, the gunners were standing or  crouching by their guns. The watchers of the night lay stretched  out upon the ground, sleeping in the warm sun after their long,  anxious vigil. Stumbling in among them, I was pulled back by one  of the photographers.    \"For heaven's sake,\" he cried, \"don't wake up those men!\"    \"Why?\" I asked.    \"Because this picture I'm taking here is to be labeled 'Dead Men in  the Termonde Trenches,' and you would have them starting up as  though the day of resurrection had arrived.\"    After taking these pictures we were ready to cross the bridge; but  the two sentries posted at this end were not ready to let us. They  were very small men, but very determined, and informed us that  their instructions were to allow no one to pass over without a  permit signed by the General. We produced scores of passes and  passports decorated with stamps and seals and covered with  myriad signatures.

ANGELA MESSENGER, heiress to Messenger's Brewery and an enormous  fortune. In order to know the people of the East End she lives among  them as a dressmaker. She sees their needs, and to supply these in  part, builds _The People's Palace_--or Palace of Delights.--_All Sorts  and Conditions of Men_, by Walter Besant (1889).    ANGEL'ICA, in Bojardo's _Orlando Innamorato_ (1495), is daughter of  Gal'aphron king of Cathay. She goes to Paris, and Orlando falls in  love with her, forgetful of wife, sovereign, country, and glory.  Angelica, on the other hand, disregards Orlando, but passionately  loves Rinaldo, who positively dislikes her. Angelica and Rinaldo drink  of certain fountains, when the opposite effects are produced in their  hearts, for then Rinaldo loves Angelica, while Angelica loses all love  for Rinaldo.    _Angelica_, in Ariosto's _Orlando Furioso_ (1516), is the same lady,  who marries Medoro, a young Moore, and returns to Cathay, where Medoro  succeeds to the crown. As for Orlando, he is driven mad by jealousy  and pride.      The fairest of her sex, Angelica,    ...Sought by many prowest knights,    Both painim and the peers of Charlemagne.

For a  time he is unwilling to declare himself because of his debts; but  Angelica gets possession of a bond for L4000, and tears it. The money  difficulty being adjusted, the marriage is arranged amicably.--W.  Congreve, _Love for Love_ (1695).    Mrs. Anne Bracegirdle equally delighted in melting tenderness and  playful coquetry, in \"Statira\" or \"Millamant;\" and even at an advanced  age, when she played \"Angelica.\"--C. Dibden.    _Angelica_, the troth-plight wife of Valere, \"the gamester.\" She  gives him a picture, and enjoins him not to part with it on pain of  forfeiting her hand. However, he loses it in play, and Angelica in  disguise is the winner of it. After much tribulation, Valere is  cured of his vice, and the two are happily united by marriage.--Mrs.  Centlivre, _The Gamester_ (1705).    ANGELI'NA, daughter of lord Lewis, in the comedy called _The Elder  Brother_, by Beaumont and Fletcher (1637).    _Angelina_, daughter of don Charino. Her father wanted her to marry  Clodio, a coxcomb, but she preferred his elder brother Carlos, a  bookworm, with whom she eloped. They were taken captives and carried  to Lisbon. Here in due time they met, the fathers who went in search  of them came to the same spot, and as Clodio had engaged himself to  Elvira of Lisbon, the testy old gentlemen agreed to the marriage of  Angelina with Carlos.--C. Cibber, _Love Makes a Man_.    Angelique' (3 _syl._), daughter of Argan the _malade imaginaire_. Her  lover is Cleante (2 _syl._). In order to prove whether his wife or  daughter loved him the better, Argan pretended to be dead, whereupon  the wife rejoiced greatly that she was relieved of a \"disgusting  creature,\" hated by every one; but the daughter grieved as if her  heart would break, rebuked herself for her shortcomings, and vowed  to devote the rest of her life in prayer for the repose of his soul.  Argan, being assured of his daughter's love, gave his free consent to  her marriage with Cleante.--Moliere, _Malade Imaginaire_ (1673).    _Angelique_, the aristocratic wife of George Dandin, a French  commoner. She has a liaison with a M. Clitandre, but always contrives  to turn the tables on her husband. George Dandin first hears of a  rendezvous from one Lubin, a foolish servant of Clitandre, and lays  the affair before M. and Mde. Sotenville, his wife's parents. The  baron with George Dandin call on the lover, who denies the accusation,  and George Dandin has to beg pardon. Subsequently, he catches his wife  and Clitandre together, and sends at once for M. and Mde. Sotenville;  but Angelique, aware of their presence, pretends to denounce her  lover, and even takes up a stick to beat him for the \"insult offered  to a virtuous wife;\" so again the parents declare their daughter to be  the very paragon of women. Lastly, George Dandin detects his wife and  Clitandre together at night-time, and succeeds in shutting his wife  out of her room; but Angelique now pretends to kill herself, and when  George goes for a light to look for the body, she rushes into her room  and shuts him out. At this crisis the parents arrive, when Angelique  accuses her husband of being out all night in a debauch; and he is  made to beg her pardon on his knees.--Moliere, _George Dandin_ (1668).

ANGELS (_Orders of_). According to Dionysius the Areop'agite, the  angels are divided into nine orders: Seraphim and Cherubim, in the  _first_ circle; Thrones and Dominions, in the _second_ circle;  Virtues, Powers, Principalities, Archangels, and Angels, in the  _third_ circle.      Novem angelorum ordines dicimus, quia videlicet    esse, testante sacro eloquio, scimus Angelos,    Archangelos, Virtutes, Potestates, Principatus,    Dominationes, Thronos, Cherubim, atque Seraphim.--St.    Gregory the Great, _Homily_ 34.    (See _Hymns Ancient and Modern_, No. 253, ver. 2, 3.)    ANGER ... THE ALPHABET. It was Athenodo'rus the Stoic who advised  Augustus to repeat the alphabet when he felt inclined to give way to  anger.      Un certain Grec disait a l'empereur Auguste,    Comme une instruction utile autant que juste,    Que, lorsqu' une aventure en colere nous met,    Nous devons, avant tout, dire notre alphabet,    Afin que dans ce temps la bile se tempere,    Et qu'on ne fasse rien que l'on ne doive faire.    Moliere, _L'Ecole des Femmes_, ii. 4 (1662).    ANGIOLI'NA (4 _syl_.), daughter of Loreda'no, and the young wife of  Mari'no Faliero, the doge of Venice. A patrician named Michel Steno,  having behaved indecently to some of the women assembled at the great  civic banquet given by the doge, was kicked out of the house by order  of the doge, and in revenge wrote some scurrilous lines against the  dogaressa. This insult was referred to \"The Forty,\" and Steno was  sentenced to two months' imprisonment, which the doge considered a  very inadequate punishment for the offence.--Byron, _Marino Faliero_.      The character of the calm, pure-spirited Angiolina    is developed most admirably. The great    difference between her temper and that of her    fiery husband is vividly portrayed, but not less    vividly touched is that strong bond of union    which exists in the common nobleness of their    deep natures. There is no spark of jealousy in    the old man's thoughts. He does not expect the    fervor of youthful passion in his young wife;    but he finds what is far better--the fearless confidence    of one so innocent that she can scarcely    believe in the existence of guilt.... She thinks    Steno's greatest punishment will be \"the blushes    of his privacy.\"--Lockhart.    ANGLAN'TE'S LORD, Orlando, who was lord of Anglante and knight of  Brava.--Ariosto, _Orlando Furioso_ (1516).    AN'GLIDES (3 _syl_.), wife of good prince Boud'wine (2 _syl_.),  brother to sir Mark king of Cornwall (\"the falsest traitor that ever  was born\"). When king Mark slew her husband, Anglides and her son  Alisaunder made their escape to Magounce (_i.e. Arundel_), where she  lived in peace, and brought up her son till he received the honor  of knighthood.--Sir T. Malory, _Hist, of Pr. Arthur_, ii. 117, 118  (1470).    AN'GUISANT, king of Erin (_Ireland_), subdued by king Arthur fighting  in behalf of Leod'ogran king of Cam'eliard (3 _syl_.).--Tennyson,  _Coming of King Arthur_.    ANGULE (_St._), bishop of London, put to death by Maximia'nus  Hercu'lius, Roman general in Britain in the reign of Diocletian.      St. Angule put to death, one of our holiest men,    At London, of that see the godly bishop then.    Drayton, _Polyolbion_, xxiv. (1622).    ANGURVA'DEL, Frithiof's sword, inscribed with Runic characters, which  blazed in time of war, but gleamed dimly in time of peace.
