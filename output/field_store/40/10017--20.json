The morning, however, brought clear weather and bright sunlight, and  all were in high spirits. The scenery for a time was of a pleasing and  picturesque character, and they pushed contentedly forward, until they  arrived at the ford of the Kansas, one hundred miles from the point  where it emptied into the Missouri.    The stream was found so swollen from recent rains that it could not be  forded. Accordingly several of the mounted men forced their animals into  the stream and swam them across to serve as guides for the rest. They  succeeded quite well, excepting the oxen, which, after floundering  awhile, landed on the same side from which they started. The following  morning they succeeded in crossing.    Among the useful articles with which Fremont had provided himself, was  an India rubber boat, twenty feet long and five feet wide. This was very  buoyant and the carts and baggage were carried over piecemeal in it,  with the exception of the last two carts. Laden with these the boat  left the shore but had not gone far when the man at the helm, who was  exceedingly nervous, managed to capsize the craft, with all its precious  cargo. The hunters were so dismayed over the prospect of losing their  stores that nearly all plunged into the stream and made frantic efforts  to save what they could. Several did not stop to remember that they  could not swim, so that the principal efforts of some of the others were  directed to saving them.    Most of the goods were recovered, but nearly all the sugar dissolved  and every grain of coffee was lost. It would be hard to imagine any  deprivation greater than that to which this misfortune condemned the  explorers. Carson and one of the others made such strenuous efforts in  the water that they were ill the next day, and Fremont remained in camp  for twenty-four hours with a view of giving them time to recruit.    The journey westward progressed without any special incident. A large  party of emigrants on their way to Oregon were several weeks in advance  of the explorers. Bad fortune seemed to have followed them from the  start, and numerous freshly made graves were seen. One of the emigrants  who had been peculiarly unfortunate, came into camp with a hunter on his  way home. He took charge of the letters which the explorers desired to  send to their families.    The party soon reached the Pawnee country where they were forced to  unusual vigilance, for those Indians have long been noted as most  persistent horse thieves. Game was abundant. Large flocks of wild  turkeys were found roosting in the trees along the streams; elk,  antelope and deer were plentiful, and as for bisons, they were beyond  all computation.    One day a member of the company happened to be riding at the rear  galloped up in hot haste, shouting, \"Indians!\" He declared that he had  seen them distinctly and counted twenty-seven. An immediate halt was  called, and Carson, leaping on one of the fleetest horses, crossed the  river and galloped over the prairie.    \"Mounted on a fine horse without a saddle,\" says Fremont, \"and scouring,  bareheaded, over the prairies, Kit was one of the finest pictures of  a horseman I have ever seen. He soon returned quite leisurely, and  informed them that the party of twenty-seven Indians had resolved itself  into a herd of six elk who, having discovered us, had scampered off at  full speed.\"        CHAPTER XIX.

Fremont and his party, after traveling something over three hundred  miles from the mouth of the Kansas reached the Platte river, where they  encamped in a charming place near Grand Island. The country was most  beautiful, though they suffered somewhat from the violent storms which  frequently broke over them.    The noon halt was made and all were lounging about the camp, when one  of the men on guard called an alarm. Everybody sprang to his feet and  grasped his rifle, expecting an attack from Indians. A strange wild  looking company were seen approaching, but, as they came closer, they  were discovered to be white men. They were a striking sight, numbering  fourteen, in the most ragged and woebegone condition imaginable. They  had been on a trapping expedition, but having met with nothing but  disasters from the beginning, were now straggling back to St. Louis on  foot.    The explorers proceeded at a leisurely pace that day and having gone  into camp, observed three Indians drawing near, one of whom was a boy  about a dozen years of age. They were Cheyennes that had been out  among the Pawnees to steal horses, but having met with no success, were  returning home. Catching sight of the white men, they unhesitatingly  entered camp, confident of being treated well, as of course proved to be  the case. After supper one of the warriors drew a rude but correct map  of the country around them, and gave it to Fremont.    On the first of July, while riding over a delightful prairie country,  on the right bank of the river, a herd of buffaloes, numbering nearly  a thousand, came up from the water and began slowly crossing the plain,  cropping the grass as they went. As the prairie was three miles broad  only, a fine opportunity was given the hunters to charge before the  animals could scatter among the hills.    The fleetest horses were quickly saddled and Carson, Fremont, and  Maxwell prepared for the chase. By that time the herd was a half mile  away and they did not notice the hunters until they were within three  hundred yards. Then followed an agitation of the animals, quickly  followed by their precipitate flight. The horses dashed after them. A  crowd of bulls brought up the rear, they having stationed themselves  there to defend the females. Every once in a while they would whirl  about and stare, snorting at the horsemen, as if they had made up their  minds to fight; but when the hunters came nigher, they turned about and  plunged after the herd. Describing the exciting incident, Fremont wrote;    \"In a few moments, during which we had been quickening our pace, we were  going over the ground like a hurricane. When at about thirty yards we  gave the usual shout and broke into the herd. We entered on the side,  the mass giving away in every direction in their heedless course. Many  of the bulls, less fleet than the cows, paying no heed to the ground,  and occupied solely with the hunters, were precipitated to the earth  with great force, rolling over and over with the violence of the shock,  and hardly distinguishable in the dust. We separated, on entering, each  singling out his game.    \"My horse was a trained hunter, famous in the west under the name of  Proveau, and with his eyes flashing and the foam flying from his mouth,  he sprang on after the cow like a tiger. In a few moments he brought me  alongside of her. Rising in the stirrups, I fired, at the distance of  a yard, the ball entering at the termination of the long hair, passing  near the heart. She fell headlong at the report of the gun. Checking my  horse, I looked around for my companions.    \"At a little distance Kit was on the ground engaged in tying his horse  to the horns of a cow, which he was preparing to cut up. Among the  scattered band at some distance, I caught a glimpse of Maxwell. While  I was looking, a light wreath of white smoke curled away from his gun,  from which I was too far to hear the report. Nearer, and between me and  the hills, toward which they were directing their course, was the body  of the herd. Giving my horse the rein, we dashed after them. A thick  cloud of dust hung upon their rear, which filled my mouth and eyes and  nearly smothered me. In the midst of this I could see nothing, and  the buffaloes were not distinguishable until within thirty feet. They  crowded together more densely still, as I came upon them, and rushed  along in such a compact body that I could not obtain an entrance, the  horse almost leaping upon them.    \"In a few moments the mass divided to the right and left, the horns  clattering with a noise heard above everything else, and my horse darted  into the opening. Five or six bulls charged on us as we dashed along the  line, but were left far behind. Singling out a cow, I gave her my fire  but struck too high. She gave a tremendous leap and scoured on swifter  than before. I reined up my horse, and the band swept on like a torrent,  and left the place quiet and clear. Our chase had led us into dangerous  ground. A prairie dog village, so thickly settled that there were three  or four holes in twenty yards square, occupied the whole bottom for  nearly two miles in length.\"    The stirring buffalo hunt ended, the company advanced over the prairie  for more than twenty miles, and encamped on the banks of a stream, where  they enjoyed a fine feast on choice bison steaks. While they were thus  employed, the wolves were attracted thither by the smell of broiling  meat and prowled around camp, licking their chops, impatient for the  time when they would be permitted to gorge themselves upon what should  be left.    For several days there was little variation in the experience of the  explorers, and no special incident took place. At the junction of the  north and south fork of the Platte, Fremont, who wished to explore the  south branch and to secure some astronomical observations, set out with  nine men intending to advance to St. Vrain's fort, where he was hopeful  of obtaining some mules. The rest of the party followed the north fork  to fort Laramie, where it was agreed they would wait for the others to  join them.    Fremont's experience in going up the south branch was in strong contrast  to the pleasant scenes of the previous. It was midsummer and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7885"],[0,"Celtic Fairy Tales (#16)"],[1,"it was  heated! Henceforth whenever I go up a hill, I shall have a scant in my  breath and a pain in my chest.\"    On the third day the knights returned once more to the palace, and  Yspathaden took the third dart and cast it at them.    But Kilhuch caught it and threw it vigorously, and wounded him through  the eyeball, so that the dart came out at the back of his head.    \"A cursed ungentle son-in-law, truly. As long as I remain alive my  eyesight will be the worse. Whenever I go against the wind my eyes will  water, and peradventure my head will burn, and I shall have a giddiness  every new moon. Cursed be the fire in which it was forged. Like the  bite of a mad dog is the stroke of this poisoned iron.\"    And they went to meat.    Said Yspathaden Penkawr, \"Is it thou that seekest my daughter?\"    \"It is I,\" answered Kilhuch.    \"I must have thy pledge that thou wilt not do towards me otherwise than  is just, and when I have gotten that which I shall name, my daughter  thou shalt have.\"    \"I promise thee that willingly,\" said Kilhuch, \"name what thou wilt.\"    \"I will do so,\" said he.    \"Throughout the world there is not a comb or scissors with which I can  arrange my hair, on, account of its rankness, except the comb and  scissors that are between the two ears of Turch Truith, the son of  Prince Tared. He will not give them of his own free will, and thou wilt  not be able to compel him.\"    \"It will be easy for me to compass this, although thou mayest think  that it will not be easy.\"    \"Though thou get this, there is yet that which thou wilt not get. It  will not be possible to hunt Turch Truith without Drudwyn the whelp of  Greid, the son of Eri, and know that throughout the world there is not  a huntsman who can hunt with this dog, except Mabon the son of Modron.  He was taken from his mother when three nights old, and it is not known  where he now is, nor whether he is living or dead.\"    \"It will be easy for me to compass this, although thou mayest think  that it will not be easy.\"    \"Though thou get this, there is yet that which thou wilt not get. Thou  wilt not get Mabon, for it is not known where he is, unless thou find  Eidoel, his kinsman in blood, the son of Aer. For it would be useless  to seek for him. He is his cousin.\"    \"It will be easy for me to compass this, although thou mayest think  that it will not be easy. Horses shall I have, and chivalry; and my  lord and kinsman Arthur will obtain for me all these things. And I  shall gain thy daughter, and thou shalt lose thy life.\"    \"Go forward. And thou shalt not be chargeable for food or raiment for  my daughter while thou art seeking these things; and when thou hast  compassed all these marvels, thou shalt have my daughter for wife.\"    Now, when they told Arthur how they had sped, Arthur said, \"Which of  these marvels will it be best for us to seek first?\"    \"It will be best,\" said they, \"to seek Mabon the son of Modron; and he  will not be found unless we first find Eidoel, the son of Aer, his  kinsman.\"    Then Arthur rose up, and the warriors of the Islands of Britain with  him, to seek for Eidoel; and they proceeded until they came before the  castle of Glivi, where Eidoel was imprisoned.    Glivi stood on the summit of his castle, and said, \"Arthur, what  requirest thou of me, since nothing remains to me in this fortress, and  I have neither joy nor pleasure in it; neither wheat nor oats?\"    Said Arthur, \"Not to injure thee came I hither, but to seek for the  prisoner that is with thee.\"    \"I will give thee my prisoner, though I had not thought to give him up  to any one; and therewith shalt thou have my support and my aid.\"    His followers then said unto Arthur, \"Lord, go thou home, thou canst  not proceed with thy host in quest of such small adventures as these.\"    Then said Arthur, \"It were well for thee, Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd,  to go upon this quest, for thou knowest all languages, and art familiar  with those of the birds and the beasts. Go, Eidoel, likewise with my  men in search of thy cousin. And as for you, Kay and Bedwyr, I have  hope of whatever adventure ye are in quest of, that ye will achieve it.  Achieve ye this adventure for me.\"    These went forward until they came to the Ousel of Cilgwri, and Gwrhyr  adjured her for the sake of Heaven, saying, \"Tell me if thou knowest  aught of Mabon, the son of Modron, who was taken when three nights old  from between his mother and the wall.\"    And the Ousel answered, \"When I first came here there was a smith's  anvil in this place, and I was then a young bird, and from that time no  work has been done upon it, save the pecking of my beak every evening,  and now there is not so much as the size of a nut remaining thereof;  yet the vengeance of Heaven be upon me if during all that time I have  ever heard of the man for whom you inquire. Nevertheless, there is a  race of animals who were formed before me, and I will be your guide to  them.\"    So they proceeded to the place where was the Stag of Redynvre.    \"Stag of Redynvre, behold we are come to thee, an embassy from Arthur,  for we have not heard of any animal older than thou. Say, knowest thou  aught of Mabon?\"    The stag said, \"When first I came hither there was a plain all around  me, without any trees save one oak sapling, which grew up to be an oak  with an hundred branches. And that oak has since perished, so that now  nothing remains of it but the withered stump; and from that day to this  I have been here, yet have I never heard of the man for whom you  inquire. Nevertheless, I will be your guide to the place where there is  an animal which was formed before I was.\"    So they proceeded to the place where was the Owl of Cwm Cawlwyd, to  inquire of him concerning Mabon.    And the owl said, \"If I knew I would tell you. When first I came  hither, the wide valley you see was a wooded glen. And a race of men  came and rooted it up. And there grew there a second wood, and this  wood is the third. My wings, are they not withered stumps? Yet all this  time, even until to-day, I have never heard of the man for whom you  inquire. Nevertheless, I will be the guide of Arthur's embassy until  you come to the place where is the oldest animal in this world, and the  one who has travelled most, the eagle of Gwern Abwy.\"    When they came to the eagle, Gwrhyr asked it the same question; but it  replied, \"I have been here for a great space of time, and when I first  came hither there was a rock here, from the top of which I pecked at  the stars every evening, and now it is not so much as a span high. From  that day to this I have been here, and I have never heard of the man  for whom you inquire, except once when I went in search of food as far  as Llyn Llyw.  And when I came there, I struck my talons into a salmon,  thinking he would serve me as food for a long time. But he drew me into  the deep, and I was scarcely able to escape from him. After that I went  with my whole kindred to attack him and to try to destroy him, but he  sent messengers and made peace with me, and came and besought me to  take fifty fish-spears out of his back. Unless he know something of him  whom you seek, I cannot tell you who may. However, I will guide you to  the place where he is.\"    So they went thither, and the eagle said, \"Salmon of Llyn Llyw, I have  come to thee with an embassy from Arthur to ask thee if thou knowest  aught concerning Mabon, the son of Modron, who was taken away at three  nights old from between his mother and the wall.\"    And the salmon answered, \"As much as I know I will tell thee. With  every tide I go along the river upwards, until I come near to the walls  of Gloucester, and there have I found such wrong as I never found  elsewhere; and to the end that ye may give credence thereto, let one of  you go thither upon each of my two shoulders.\"    So Kay and Gwrhyr went upon his shoulders, and they proceeded till they  came to the wall of the prison, and they heard a great wailing and  lamenting from the dungeon. Said Gwrhyr, \"Who is it that laments in  this house of stone?\"    And the voice replied, \"Alas, it is Mabon, the son of Modron, who is  here imprisoned!\"    Then they returned and told Arthur, who, summoning his warriors,  attacked the castle.    And whilst the fight was going on, Kay and Bedwyr, mounting on the  shoulders of the fish, broke into the dungeon, and brought away with  them Mabon, the son of Modron.    Then Arthur summoned unto him all the warriors that were in the three  islands of Britain and in the three islands adjacent; and he went as  far as Esgeir Ocrvel in Ireland where the Boar Truith was with his  seven young pigs. And the dogs were let loose upon him from all sides.  But he wasted the fifth part of Ireland, and then set forth through the  sea to Wales. Arthur and his hosts, and his horses, and his dogs  followed hard after him. But ever and awhile the boar made a stand, and  many a champion of Arthur's did he slay. Throughout all Wales did  Arthur follow him, and one by one the young pigs were killed. At  length, when he would fain have crossed the Severn and escaped into  Cornwall, Mabon the son of Modron came up with him, and Arthur fell  upon him together with the champions of Britain. On the one side Mabon  the son of Modron spurred his steed and snatched his razor from him,  whilst Kay came up with him on the other side and took from him the  scissors. But before they could obtain the comb he had regained the  ground with his feet, and from the moment that he reached the shore,  neither dog nor man nor horse could overtake him until he came to  Cornwall. There Arthur and his hosts followed in his track until they  overtook him in Cornwall. Hard had been their trouble before, but it  was child's play to what they met in seeking the comb. Win it they did,  and the Boar Truith they hunted into the deep sea, and it was never  known whither he went.    Then Kilhuch set"]]]
