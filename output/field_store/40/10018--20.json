It seemed impossible to follow him in the pitchy  darkness, on a mossy soil that muffled the sound of footsteps. Renine did  not make the attempt; but, at daybreak, he came with his chauffeur and  hunted through the park all the morning. Though the park, which covered  the side of a hill and was bounded below by the river, was not very large,  he found no clue which gave him any reason to suppose that Rose Andree was  imprisoned there.    He therefore went back to the village, with the firm intention of taking  action that evening and employing force:    \"This state of things cannot go on,\" he said to Hortense. \"I must rescue  Rose Andree at all costs and save her from that ruffian's clutches. He must  be made to speak. He must. Otherwise there's a danger that we may be too  late.\"    That day was Sunday; and Dalbreque did not go to work. He did not leave his  room except for lunch and went upstairs again immediately afterwards. But  at three o'clock Renine and Hortense, who were keeping a watch on him from  the inn, saw him come down the wooden staircase, with his bicycle on his  shoulder. Leaning it against the bottom step, he inflated the tires and  fastened to the handle-bar a rather bulky object wrapped in a newspaper.    \"By Jove!\" muttered Renine.    \"What's the matter?\"    In front of the cafe was a small terrace bordered on the right and left by  spindle-trees planted in boxes, which were connected by a paling. Behind  the shrubs, sitting on a bank but stooping forward so that they could see  Dalbreque through the branches, were four men.    \"Police!\" said Renine. \"What bad luck! If those fellows take a hand, they  will spoil everything.\"    \"Why? On the contrary, I should have thought....\"    \"Yes, they will. They will put Dalbreque out of the way ... and then? Will  that give us Rose Andree?\"    Dalbreque had finished his preparations. Just as he was mounting his  bicycle, the detectives rose in a body, ready to make a dash for him. But  Dalbreque, though quite unconscious of their presence, changed his mind and  went back to his room as though he had forgotten something.    \"Now's the time!\" said Renine. \"I'm going to risk it. But it's a difficult  situation and I've no great hopes.\"    He went out into the yard and, at a moment when the detectives were not  looking, ran up the staircase, as was only natural if he wished to give an  order to his chauffeur. But he had no sooner reached the rustic balcony at  the back of the house, which gave admission to the two bedrooms than he  stopped. Dalbreque's door was open. Renine walked in.    Dalbreque stepped back, at once assuming the defensive:    \"What do you want? Who said you could....\"    \"Silence!\" whispered Renine, with an imperious gesture. \"It's all up with  you!\"    \"What are you talking about?\" growled the man, angrily.    \"Lean out of your window. There are four men below on the watch for you to  leave, four detectives.\"    Dalbreque leant over the terrace and muttered an oath:    \"On the watch for me?\" he said, turning round. \"What do I care?\"    \"They have a warrant.\"    He folded his arms:    \"Shut up with your piffle! A warrant! What's that to me?\"    \"Listen,\" said Renine, \"and let us waste no time. It's urgent. Your name's  Dalbreque, or, at least, that's the name under which you acted in _The  Happy Princess_ and under which the police are looking for you as being  the murderer of Bourguet the jeweller, the man who stole a motor-car and  forty thousand francs from the World's Cinema Company and the man who  abducted a woman at Le Havre. All this is known and proved ... and here's  the upshot. Four men downstairs. Myself here, my chauffeur in the next  room. You're done for. Do you want me to save you?\"    Dalbreque gave his adversary a long look:    \"Who are you?\"    \"A friend of Rose Andree's,\" said Renine.    The other started and, to some extent dropping his mask, retorted:    \"What are your conditions?\"    \"Rose Andree, whom you have abducted and tormented, is dying in some hole  or corner. Where is she?\"    A strange thing occurred and impressed Renine. Dalbreque's face, usually so  common, was lit up by a smile that made it almost attractive. But this was  only a flashing vision: the man immediately resumed his hard and impassive  expression.    \"And suppose I refuse to speak?\" he said.    \"So much the worse for you. It means your arrest.\"    \"I dare say; but it means the death of Rose Andree. Who will release her?\"    \"You. You will speak now, or in an hour, or two hours hence at least. You  will never have the heart to keep silent and let her die.\"    Dalbreque shrugged his shoulders. Then, raising his hand, he said:    \"I swear on my life that, if they arrest me, not a word will leave my  lips.\"    \"What then?\"    \"Then save me. We will meet this evening at the entrance to the Parc des  Landes and say what we have to say.\"    \"Why not at once?\"    \"I have spoken.\"    \"Will you be there?\"    \"I shall be there.\"    Renine reflected. There was something in all this that he failed to grasp.  In any case, the frightful danger that threatened Rose Andree dominated the  whole situation; and Renine was not the man to despise this threat and to  persist out of vanity in a perilous course. Rose Andree's life came before  everything.    He struck several blows on the wall of the next bedroom and called his  chauffeur.    \"Adolphe, is the car ready?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Set her going and pull her up in front of the terrace outside the cafe,  right against the boxes so as to block the exit. As for you,\" he continued,  addressing Dalbreque, \"you're to jump on your machine and, instead of  making off along the road, cross the yard. At the end of the yard is a  passage leading into a lane. There you will be free. But no hesitation and  no blundering ... else you'll get yourself nabbed. Good luck to you.\"    He waited till the car was drawn up in accordance with his instructions  and, when he reached it, he began to question his chauffeur, in order to  attract the detectives' attention.    One of them, however, having cast a glance through the spindle-trees,  caught sight of Dalbreque just as he reached the bottom of the staircase.  He gave the alarm and darted forward, followed by his comrades, but had  to run round the car and bumped into the chauffeur, which gave Dalbreque  time to mount his bicycle and cross the yard unimpeded. He thus had some  seconds' start. Unfortunately for him as he was about to enter the passage  at the back, a troop of boys and girls appeared, returning from vespers. On  hearing the shouts of the detectives, they spread their arms in front of  the fugitive, who gave two or three lurches and ended by falling.    Cries of triumph were raised:    \"Lay hold of him! Stop him!\" roared the detectives as they rushed forward.    Renine, seeing that the game was up, ran after the others and called out:    \"Stop him!\"    He came up with them just as Dalbreque, after regaining his feet, knocked  one of the policemen down and levelled his revolver. Renine snatched it out  of his hands. But the two other detectives, startled, had also produced  their weapons. They fired. Dalbreque, hit in the leg and the chest, pitched  forward and fell.    \"Thank you, sir,\" said the inspector to Renine introducing himself. \"We owe  a lot to you.\"    \"It seems to me that you've done for the fellow,\" said Renine. \"Who is he?\"    \"One Dalbreque, a scoundrel for whom we were looking.\"    Renine was beside himself. Hortense had joined him by this time; and he  growled:    \"The silly fools! Now they've killed him!\"    \"Oh, it isn't possible!\"    \"We shall see. But, whether he's dead or alive, it's death to Rose Andree.  How are we to trace her? And what chance have we of finding the place--some  inaccessible retreat--where the poor thing is dying of misery and  starvation?\"    The detectives and peasants had moved away, bearing Dalbreque with them on  an improvised stretcher. Renine, who had at first followed them, in order  to find out what was going to happen, changed his mind and was now standing  with his eyes fixed on the ground. The fall of the bicycle had unfastened  the parcel which Dalbreque had tied to the handle-bar; and the newspaper  had burst, revealing its contents, a tin saucepan, rusty, dented, battered  and useless.    \"What's the meaning of this?\" he muttered. \"What was the idea?...\"    He picked it up examined it. Then he gave a grin and a click of the tongue  and chuckled, slowly:    \"Don't move an eyelash, my dear. Let all these people clear off. All this  is no business of ours, is it? The troubles of police don't concern us. We  are two motorists travelling for our pleasure and collecting old saucepans  if we feel so inclined.\"    He called his chauffeur:    \"Adolphe, take us to the Parc des Landes by a roundabout road.\"    Half an hour later they reached the sunken track and began to scramble down  it on foot beside the wooded slopes. The Seine, which was very low at this  time of day, was lapping against a little jetty near which lay a  worm-eaten, mouldering boat, full of puddles of water.    Renine stepped into the boat and at once began to bale out the puddles with  his saucepan. He then drew the boat alongside of the jetty, helped Hortense  in and used the one oar which he shipped in a gap in the stern to work her  into midstream:    \"I believe I'm there!\" he said, with a laugh. \"The worst that can happen  to us is to get our feet wet, for our craft leaks a trifle. But haven't we  a saucepan? Oh, blessings on that useful utensil! Almost as soon as I set  eyes upon it, I remembered that people use those articles to bale out the  bottoms of leaky boats. Why, there was bound to be a boat in the Landes  woods! How was it I never thought of that? But of course Dalbreque made use  of her to cross the Seine! And, as she made water, he brought a saucepan.\"   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/792"],[0,"Wieland; Or, The Transformation: An American Tale (#16)"],[1,"heightened by these tokens; but,  strange as it may seem, I found, in the present state of my mind, no  relief but in the persuasion that Pleyel was unhappy.    That unhappiness, indeed, depended, for its value in my eyes, on the  cause that produced it. It did not arise from the death of the Saxon  lady: it was not a contagious emanation from the countenances of Wieland  or Carwin. There was but one other source whence it could flow. A  nameless ecstacy thrilled through my frame when any new proof occurred  that the ambiguousness of my behaviour was the cause.        Chapter IX      My brother had received a new book from Germany. It was a tragedy, and  the first attempt of a Saxon poet, of whom my brother had been taught to  entertain the highest expectations. The exploits of Zisca, the Bohemian  hero, were woven into a dramatic series and connection. According to  German custom, it was minute and diffuse, and dictated by an adventurous  and lawless fancy. It was a chain of audacious acts, and unheard-of  disasters. The moated fortress, and the thicket; the ambush and the  battle; and the conflict of headlong passions, were pourtrayed in  wild numbers, and with terrific energy. An afternoon was set apart to  rehearse this performance. The language was familiar to all of us but  Carwin, whose company, therefore, was tacitly dispensed with.    The morning previous to this intended rehearsal, I spent at home. My  mind was occupied with reflections relative to my own situation. The  sentiment which lived with chief energy in my heart, was connected  with the image of Pleyel. In the midst of my anguish, I had not been  destitute of consolation. His late deportment had given spring to my  hopes. Was not the hour at hand, which should render me the happiest  of human creatures? He suspected that I looked with favorable eyes upon  Carwin. Hence arose disquietudes, which he struggled in vain to conceal.  He loved me, but was hopeless that his love would be compensated. Is it  not time, said I, to rectify this error? But by what means is this to be  effected? It can only be done by a change of deportment in me; but how  must I demean myself for this purpose?    I must not speak. Neither eyes, nor lips, must impart the information.  He must not be assured that my heart is his, previous to the tender of  his own; but he must be convinced that it has not been given to another;  he must be supplied with space whereon to build a doubt as to the true  state of my affections; he must be prompted to avow himself. The line  of delicate propriety; how hard it is, not to fall short, and not to  overleap it!    This afternoon we shall meet at the temple. We shall not separate till  late. It will be his province to accompany me home. The airy expanse is  without a speck. This breeze is usually stedfast, and its promise of  a bland and cloudless evening, may be trusted. The moon will rise at  eleven, and at that hour, we shall wind along this bank. Possibly that  hour may decide my fate. If suitable encouragement be given, Pleyel will  reveal his soul to me; and I, ere I reach this threshold, will be made  the happiest of beings. And is this good to be mine? Add wings to thy  speed, sweet evening; and thou, moon, I charge thee, shroud thy beams at  the moment when my Pleyel whispers love. I would not for the world, that  the burning blushes, and the mounting raptures of that moment, should be  visible.    But what encouragement is wanting? I must be regardful of insurmountable  limits. Yet when minds are imbued with a genuine sympathy, are not words  and looks superfluous? Are not motion and touch sufficient to impart  feelings such as mine? Has he not eyed me at moments, when the pressure  of his hand has thrown me into tumults, and was it possible that he  mistook the impetuosities of love, for the eloquence of indignation?    But the hastening evening will decide. Would it were come! And yet I  shudder at its near approach. An interview that must thus terminate, is  surely to be wished for by me; and yet it is not without its terrors.  Would to heaven it were come and gone!    I feel no reluctance, my friends to be thus explicit. Time was, when  these emotions would be hidden with immeasurable solicitude, from every  human eye. Alas! these airy and fleeting impulses of shame are gone. My  scruples were preposterous and criminal. They are bred in all hearts, by  a perverse and vicious education, and they would still have maintained  their place in my heart, had not my portion been set in misery. My  errors have taught me thus much wisdom; that those sentiments which we  ought not to disclose, it is criminal to harbour.    It was proposed to begin the rehearsal at four o'clock; I counted the  minutes as they passed; their flight was at once too rapid and too slow;  my sensations were of an excruciating kind; I could taste no food, nor  apply to any task, nor enjoy a moment's repose: when the hour arrived, I  hastened to my brother's.    Pleyel was not there. He had not yet come. On ordinary occasions, he was  eminent for punctuality. He had testified great eagerness to share  in the pleasures of this rehearsal. He was to divide the task with my  brother, and, in tasks like these, he always engaged with peculiar  zeal. His elocution was less sweet than sonorous; and, therefore,  better adapted than the mellifluences of his friend, to the outrageous  vehemence of this drama.    What could detain him? Perhaps he lingered through forgetfulness. Yet  this was incredible. Never had his memory been known to fail upon even  more trivial occasions. Not less impossible was it, that the scheme had  lost its attractions, and that he staid, because his coming would afford  him no gratification. But why should we expect him to adhere to the  minute?    An half hour elapsed, but Pleyel was still at a distance. Perhaps he had  misunderstood the hour which had been proposed. Perhaps he had conceived  that to-morrow, and not to-day, had been selected for this purpose:  but no. A review of preceding circumstances demonstrated that such  misapprehension was impossible; for he had himself proposed this day,  and this hour. This day, his attention would not otherwise be occupied;  but to-morrow, an indispensible engagement was foreseen, by which all  his time would be engrossed: his detention, therefore, must be owing  to some unforeseen and extraordinary event. Our conjectures were vague,  tumultuous, and sometimes fearful. His sickness and his death might  possibly have detained him.    Tortured with suspense, we sat gazing at each other, and at the path  which led from the road. Every horseman that passed was, for a moment,  imagined to be him. Hour succeeded hour, and the sun, gradually  declining, at length, disappeared. Every signal of his coming proved  fallacious, and our hopes were at length dismissed. His absence affected  my friends in no insupportable degree. They should be obliged, they  said, to defer this undertaking till the morrow; and, perhaps, their  impatient curiosity would compel them to dispense entirely with his  presence. No doubt, some harmless occurrence had diverted him from  his purpose; and they trusted that they should receive a satisfactory  account of him in the morning.    It may be supposed that this disappointment affected me in a very  different manner. I turned aside my head to conceal my tears. I fled  into solitude, to give vent to my reproaches, without interruption  or restraint. My heart was ready to burst with indignation and grief.  Pleyel was not the only object of my keen but unjust upbraiding. Deeply  did I execrate my own folly. Thus fallen into ruins was the gay fabric  which I had reared! Thus had my golden vision melted into air!    How fondly did I dream that Pleyel was a lover! If he were, would he  have suffered any obstacle to hinder his coming? Blind and infatuated  man! I exclaimed. Thou sportest with happiness. The good that is  offered thee, thou hast the insolence and folly to refuse. Well, I will  henceforth intrust my felicity to no one's keeping but my own.    The first agonies of this disappointment would not allow me to be  reasonable or just. Every ground on which I had built the persuasion  that Pleyel was not unimpressed in my favor, appeared to vanish. It  seemed as if I had been misled into this opinion, by the most palpable  illusions.    I made some trifling excuse, and returned, much earlier than I expected,  to my own house. I retired early to my chamber, without designing to  sleep. I placed myself at a window, and gave the reins to reflection.    The hateful and degrading impulses which had lately controuled me were,  in some degree, removed. New dejection succeeded, but was now produced  by contemplating my late behaviour. Surely that passion is worthy to  be abhorred which obscures our understanding, and urges us to the  commission of injustice. What right had I to expect his attendance?  Had I not demeaned myself like one indifferent to his happiness, and as  having bestowed my regards upon another? His absence might be prompted  by the love which I considered his absence as a proof that he wanted.  He came not because the sight of me, the spectacle of my coldness or  aversion, contributed to his despair. Why should I prolong, by hypocrisy  or silence, his misery as well as my own? Why not deal with him  explicitly, and assure him of the truth?    You will hardly believe that, in obedience to this suggestion, I rose  for the purpose of ordering a light, that I might instantly make this  confession in a letter. A second thought shewed me the rashness of this  scheme, and I wondered by what infirmity of mind I could be betrayed  into a momentary approbation of it. I saw with the utmost clearness that  a confession like that would be the most remediless and unpardonable  outrage upon the dignity of my sex, and utterly unworthy of that passion  which controuled me.
