The three principal orders of Greek  architecture are named from the style of the column used that characterized  them, viz., the Corinthian, the Doric, the Ionic. Of these the Doric is the  simplest and the Corinthian the most elaborate.    For harmony of proportions, elegance of form, and simplicity of detail,  Greek architecture and ornament has probably never been surpassed. These  qualities are admirably displayed in the Parthenon, a temple in Athens,  dedicated to Venus. Though in ruins, it is still one of the greatest  attractions to travelers in Greece. A very fine collection of fragments  taken from it is to be seen in the British Museum. They are known as the  Elgin marbles.    The most flourishing period of Greek art, as will be found in the history  of almost all nations, was identical with the most flourishing period of  its literature and general welfare.    3. _Roman Art._--In the 6th century B.C. the Greeks, already on the  decline, were conquered by the Romans, a nation hardier and more powerful,  though ruder and less civilized than themselves. The conquerors recognized  this, and immediately set to work to copy or steal from their vanquished  foes everything that might enhance the beauty and splendor of their own  city. Greek artists were transported to Rome and placed in charge of the  most important public works. Roman art is, consequently, but a development  or adaptation of the Greek. It is noticeable, however, that it almost  completely ignored the most characteristic and popular of the Greek  forms--for example, the anthemion--and adapted those, such as the acanthus  and the scroll, which had been considered of minor importance among the  Greeks. They added another to the three orders of the Greek architecture,  viz., the Composite, the most elaborate of all, being a combination of the  Ionic and the Corinthian. This leads us to consider the leading features of  Roman ornament--richness and profusion. With the acanthus and scroll as  their principal units of design, they elaborated and enriched every form  that would admit of it. The most elaborate Greek example cannot compare in  this respect to the simplest Roman. The Roman style of architecture was  very similar to the Greek, though more massive in its proportions, probably  on account of the larger number of people to be accommodated. The details  were also bolder and the curves fuller. They used the round arch to a great  extent. The column of Trajan and the Forum are fine examples of their  architecture.      II. MEDIAEVAL ART.    The Roman empire, after having reigned as mistress of the world for upward  of five centuries, commenced to show signs of decay. Its people had  gradually lost the sturdy spirit of independence, endurance, and courage  which had characterized their forefathers, and had degenerated into a race  of effeminate slaves and cowards. Ostentation became the feature of their  art; immorality and luxury, of their mode of living. They thus fell an easy  prey to the rude but vigorous barbarians of the North. The latter, rude and  uncivilized as they were, extended the contempt they had for the nation  they had conquered to their works of art as well, and mutilated or  destroyed them whenever they could lay hands on them.    This spirit of antagonism was strengthened upon their conversion to  Christianity, and everything that savored of paganism in art or literature  was severely proscribed. For the heathen forms, whose only aim and object  was beauty, were substituted religious symbols, the cross and other  implements of the passion, the lily, the fish, the aureole, etc., whose  object was to recall to the faithful the mysteries of religion. Gradually,  however, as the artistic feelings of the new people became awakened,  principles of beauty commenced to be regarded, and, while symbolism  remained an important feature of European art until the period of the  Renaissance, and even then was not entirely superseded, magnificent  artistic results were obtained.    1. _Byzantine Art._--The principal of the early mediaeval art developments  was the Byzantine. It flourished principally in the eastern part of Europe.  In the west it was known, with a few variations, as the Lombard and the  Norman. All three are often included under the term Romanesque.    Byzantine art was essentially Christian in its spirit and motives. It used  religious symbols extensively, but incorporated in its ornament a few pagan  elements, such as the acanthus and the scroll. Natural forms were always  conventionally treated. Its coloring was rich and gorgeous. The principal  features of its architecture were the dome and round arch. The plan of the  churches was often in the form of a Greek or Latin cross, with the dome  placed over the intersection of the two arms. The church of St. Sophia, in  Constantinople, is the most magnificent example of Byzantine architecture  and ornament. Although now a Mohammedan mosque, it is, probably, in the  motive and spirit that actuated its construction, the most Christian  building in the world.    2. _Saracenic Art._--Developed from the Byzantine by the Moors and the  Saracens. It differs from it, however, in one important respect. While the  Byzantine makes use of numerous conventionalized plant and animal forms,  the Saracens and Moors were forbidden by their religion, the Mohammedan, to  copy in any manner the form of any living thing, animal or vegetable. They  were thus limited entirely to geometric forms, which, however, often fall  insensibly into flower and leaf forms. Interlacing bands and curves of  intricate pattern, and exhibiting the peculiar Moorish curve, are very  characteristic of Saracenic ornament. Inscriptions were frequently  interwoven in this tracery.    The coloring was gorgeous, consisting principally of blue, red, and gold.    The principal arches used were the pointed and the horseshoe arch. The  Alhambra Palace in Spain is the most famous example of Saracenic ornament  and architecture.    3. _Gothic Art._--Gothic art grew out of the Byzantine, all the symbolic  elements being retained. It is divided into many different varieties.    In the earliest the round arch was used, but the later and more perfect  styles having employed the pointed arch almost exclusively, the latter  became characteristic of Gothic art generally. It is a style of  architecture and ornament usually applied to churches, and well adapted to  moist and cold climates on account of the sloping roof. Clustered columns,  the spire or belfry, the arched roof, and the division of the interior into  nave, transept, and choir, are leading features. Natural as well as  conventional treatment of plants is another important characteristic.    [Illustration]    The Gothic style flourished principally in England, France, and parts of  Germany. Nearly all the principal cathedrals and churches in these  countries, and many in our own, are built after this style. The most  beautiful example in this country is St. Patrick's Cathedral, in New York.  The finest specimen in the world is probably the Cathedral of Cologne,  which was commenced in the 14th century, but was not completed until many  years later.      III. MODERN ART.    In the 15th century a remarkable revival occurred in literature and the  fine arts, showing a decided tendency to return to the old classic ideas of  the Greeks and Romans. After an almost complete neglect, which lasted for  centuries, artists and men of letters turned their attention to the long  neglected relics of pagan civilization as worthy of study for their  intrinsic beauty alone. Symbolism was relegated to a minor position, and  beauty was once more cultivated for its own sake. This epoch is termed the  Renaissance--which literally means a rebirth or revival.    1. _Renaissance Style._--The term Renaissance is also applied to one of the  early styles which came into vogue at this time. It flourished principally  in southern Europe. It is not a pure style, but marks a transition period  from the old popular Gothic and Saracenic forms to the revivified classic.  It naturally exhibits a queer mixture of conflicting elements--classic and  mediaeval thrown together without much regard to propriety or fitness. It  still showed traces of symbolism.    2. _The Cinquecento Style._--The Renaissance reached its most perfect  development in the Cinquecento or the 15th century style. It followed the  Quatrocento or 14th century style. Entirely untrammeled by symbolism, and  with the whole field of classic and mediaeval ornament to glean from, its  aim was to develop a perfect style of ornament. The best examples of this  period are founded on the soundest principles of ornamental art. Nothing  that could be turned into an element of beauty was neglected. Animals, real  and fictitious, flowers, leaves, fruit, the human form, etc., were  conventionalized and made to contribute their part to enhance the beauty of  the whole. Some of the principal characteristics of the Cinquecento style  are the delicate arabesque scroll work, the profusion and beauty of the  curves, its admirable variations of standard classic ornaments, such as the  anthemion and scroll. The coloring, also, was one of its most pleasing  features. This style flourished principally in Italy and France. Farnese  Palace and the tombs of the Medicis are noted examples.    3. _The Louis Quatorze._--This style succeeded the Cinquecento, but was  far inferior to it. It arose in Italy, and while preserving generally the  materials of the style that preceded it, it added as characteristic  features the scroll and the shell. Its principal object was to create  brilliant and startling effects in light and shade. Color was, in  consequence, decidedly secondary, gilding being used everywhere. The Palace  of Versailles, near Paris, is a gorgeous example of this style. Everything  in it is glittering and sparkling.

It was as if I felt myself under the spell of some  invisible influence that like the eye of a basilisk, held me enchained.  I remember turning my head towards a certain quarter of the wall as if  I half expected to encounter there the bewildering glance of a serpent.  Yet far from being apprehensive of any danger, I only wondered over the  weakness of mind that made such fancies possible.    \"An extra loud swirl of the foliage without, accompanied by a quick  vibration of the house, aroused me at last. If I was to lose the sense  of this furious storm careering over my head, I must court sleep at  once. Rising, I drew off my coat, unloosened my vest and was about to  throw it off, when I bethought me of a certain wallet it contained.  Going to the door in some unconscious impulse of precaution I suppose, I  locked myself in, and then drawing out my wallet, took from it a roll of  bills which I put into a small side pocket, returning the wallet to its  old place.    \"Why I did this I can scarcely say. As I have before intimated, I  was under no special apprehension. I was at that time anything but a  suspicious man, and the manner and appearance of the men below struck me  as unpleasantly disagreeable but nothing more. But I not only did what I  have related, but allowed the lamp to remain lighted, lying down finally  in my clothes; an almost unprecedented act on my part, warranted however  as I said to myself, by the fury of the gale which at that time seemed  as if it would tumble the roof over our heads.    \"How long I lay listening to the creakings and groanings of the rickety  old house, I cannot say, nor how long I remained in the doze which  finally seized me as I became accustomed to the sounds around and over  me. Enough that before the storm had passed its height, I awoke as if at  the touch of a hand, and leaping with a bound out of the bed, beheld  to my incredible amazement, the alert, nervous form of Luttra standing  before me. She had my coat in her hand, and it was her touch that had  evidently awakened me.    \"'I want you to put this on,' said she in a low thrilling tone totally  new in my experience, 'and come with me. The house is unsafe for you to  remain in. Hear how it cracks and trembles. Another blast like that and  we shall be roofless.'    \"She was moving toward the door, which to my amazement stood ajar, but  my hesitation stopped her.    \"'Won't you come?' she whispered, turning her face towards me with a  look of such potent determination, I followed in spite of myself 'I dare  not let you stay here, your blood will be upon my head.'    \"'You exaggerate,' I replied, shrinking back with a longing look at the  comfortable bed I had just left. 'These old houses are always strong.  It will take many such a gust as that you hear, to overturn it, I assure  you.'    \"'I exaggerate!' she returned with a look of scorn impossible to  describe. 'Hark!' she said, 'hear that.'    \"I did hear, and I must acknowledge that it seemed is if we were about  to be swept from our foundations.    \"'Yes,' said I, 'but it is a fearful night to be out in.'    \"'I shall go with you,' said she.    \"'In that case--' I began with an ill-advised attempt at gallantry which  she cut short with a gesture.    \"'Here is your hat,' remarked she, 'and here is your bag. The  fishing-pole must remain, you cannot carry it.'    \"'But,--' I expostulated.    \"'Hush!' said she with her ear turned towards the depths of the  staircase at the top of which we stood. 'My father and brother will  think as you do that it is folly to leave the shelter of a roof for the  uncertainties of the road on such a night as this, but you must not heed  them. I tell you shelter this night is danger, and that the only safety  to be found is on the stormy highway.'    \"And without waiting for my reply, she passed rapidly down stairs,  pushed open a door at the bottom, and stepped at once into the room we  had left an hour or so before.    \"What was there in that room that for the first time struck an ominous  chill as of distinct peril through my veins? Nothing at first sight,  everything at the second. The fire which had not been allowed to die  out, still burned brightly on the ruddy hearthstone, but it was not that  which awakened my apprehension. Nor was it the loud ticking clock on the  mantel-piece with its hand pointing silently to the hour of eleven. Nor  yet the heavy quiet of the scantily-furnished room with its one lamp  burning on the deal table against the side of the wall. It was the sight  of those two powerful men drawn up in grim silence, the one against the  door leading to the front hall, the other against that opening into the  kitchen.    \"A glance at Luttra standing silent and undismayed at my side, however,  instantly reassured me. With that will exercised in my favor, I could  not but win through whatever it was that menaced me. Slinging my bag  over my shoulder, I made a move towards the door and the silent figure  of my host. But with a quick outreaching of her hand, she drew me back.    \"'Stand still!' said she. 'Karl,' she went on, turning her face towards  the more sullen but less intent countenance of her brother, 'open the  door and let this gentleman pass. He finds the house unsafe in such a  gale and desires to leave it. At once!' she continued as her brother  settled himself more determinedly against the lock: 'I don't often ask  favors.'    \"'The man is a fool that wants to go out in a night like this,' quoth  the fellow with a dogged move; 'and so are you to encourage it. I think  too much of your health to allow it.'    \"She did not seem to hear. 'Will you open the door?' she went on, not  advancing a step from the fire, before which she had placed herself and  me.'    \"'No, I won't,' was the brutal reply. 'Its been locked for the night and  its not me nor one like me, that will open it.'    \"With a sudden whitening of her already pale face, she turned towards  her father. He was not even looking at her.    \"'Some one must open the house,' said she, glancing back at her brother.  'This gentleman purposes to leave and his whim must be humored. Will you  unlock that door or shall I?'    \"An angry snarl interrupted her. Her father had bounded from the door  where he stood and was striding hastily towards her. In my apprehension  I put up my arm for a shield, for he looked ready to murder her, but  I let it drop again as l caught her glance which was like white flame  undisturbed by the least breeze of personal terror.    \"'You will stop there,' said she, pointing to a spot a few feet from  where she stood. 'Another step and I let that for which I have heard  you declare you would peril your very soul, fall into the heart of the  flames.' And drawing from her breast a roll of bills, she stretched them  out above the fire before which she was standing.    \"'You -----' broke from the gray-bearded lips of the old man, but he  stopped where he was, eyeing those bills as if fascinated.    \"'I am not a girl of many words, as you know,' continued she in a lofty  tone inexpressibly commanding. 'You may strangle me, you may kill me,  it matters little; but this gentleman leaves the house this night, or I  destroy the money with a gesture.'    \"'You -----' again broke from those quivering lips, but the old man did  not move.    \"Not so the younger. With a rush he left his post and in another instant  would have had his powerful arms about her slender form, only that I  met him half way with a blow that laid him on the floor at her feet.  She said nothing, but one of the bills immediately left her hand and  fluttered into the fire where it instantly shrivelled into nothing.    \"With the yell of a mad beast wounded in his most vulnerable spot, the  old man before us stamped with his heel upon the floor.    \"'Stop!' cried he; and going rapidly to the front door he opened it.  'There!' shrieked he, 'if you will be fools, go! and may the lightning  blast you. But first give me the money.'    \"'Come from the door,' said she, reaching out her left hand for the  lantern hanging at the side of the fireplace, 'and let Karl light this  and keep himself out of the way.'    \"It was all done. In less time than I can tell it, the old man had  stepped from the door, the younger one had lit the lantern and we were  in readiness to depart.    \"'Now do you proceed,' said she to me, 'I will follow.'    \"'No,' said I, 'we will go together.'    \"'But the money?' growled the heavy voice of my host over my shoulder.    \"'I will give it to you on my return,' said the girl.\"        CHAPTER XII. A WOMAN'S LOVE      \"Shall I ever forget the blast of driving rain that struck our faces and  enveloped us in a cloud of wet, as the door swung on its hinges and let  us forth into the night; or the electric thrill that shot through me as  that slender girl grasped my hand and drew me away through the blinding  darkness. It was not that I was so much affected by her beauty as  influenced by her power and energy. The fury of the gale seemed to bend  to her will, the wind lend wings to her feet. I began to realize what  intellect was. Arrived at the roadside, she paused and looked back. The  two burly forms of the men we had left behind us were standing in the  door of the inn; in another moment they had plunged forth and towards  us. With a low cry the young girl leaped towards a tree where to  my unbounded astonishment I beheld my horse standing ready saddled.  Dragging the mare from her fastenings, she hung the lantern, burning as  it was, on the pommel of the saddle, struck the panting creature a smart  blow upon the flank, and drew back with a leap to my side.    \"The startled horse snorted, gave a plunge of dismay and started away  from us down the road.    \"'We will wait,' said Luttra.
