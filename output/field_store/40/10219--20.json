I want to get a thirty-mile range if I can.\"    \"It isn't possible, Tom.\"    \"Bless my tape measure! I should say not!\" cried Mr. Damon.    \"We'll see,\" replied Tom, quietly. \"Put in the primer, Ned; and, Koku,  close the breech and slot it home.\"    In a few seconds the great gun was ready for firing.    \"Now,\" said Tom, \"this thing may be all right, and it may not.  The  only thing that can cause an accident will be a flaw in the steel. No  one can guard against that. So, in order to be on the safe side, we  will all go into the bomb-proof, and I will fire the gun from there.  The wires are long enough.\"    They all agreed that this was good advice, and soon the steel men and  Tom's friends were gathered in a sort of cave that had been hollowed  out in the side of the hill, and at an angle from the big gun.    \"If it does burst--which I hope it won't,\" said Tom, \"the pieces will  fly in straight lines, so we will be safe enough here. Ned, are you are  ready at the instruments?\"    \"Yes, Tom.\"    \"I want you to note the registered muzzle velocity. Mr. Damon, you will  please read the pressure gauge. After I press the button I'm going to  watch the landing of the projectile through the telescope.\"    The gun had been pointed, as I have said, at the farthest target--one  thirty miles away, telescope sights on the giant cannon making this  possible.    \"All ready!\" cried Tom.    \"All ready,\" answered Ned.    There was a tense moment; Tom's thumb pressed home the electric button,  and then came the explosion.    It seemed for a moment as if everyone was lifted from his feet.  They  had all stood on their tiptoes, and opened their mouths to lessen the  shock, but even then it was terrific. The very ground shook--from the  roof of their cave small stones and gravel rattled down on their heads.  Their ear-drums were numbed from the shock. And the noise that filled  the valley seemed like a thousand thunderbolts merged into one.    Tom rushed from the bombproof, dropping the electric button. He caught  sight of his gun, resting undisturbed on the improvised carriage.    \"Hurray!\" he cried in delight. \"She stood the charge all right.  And  look! look!\" he cried, as he pointed the glasses toward the distant  hillside. \"There goes my projectile as straight as an arrow. There! By  Caesar, Ned! It landed within three feet of the target! Oh, you  beauty!\" he yelled at his giant cannon. \"You did all I hoped you would!  Thirty miles, Ned! Think of that! A two-ton projectile being shot  thirty miles!\"    \"It's great, Tom!\" yelled his chum, clapping him on the back, and  capering about. \"It's the longest shot on record.\"    \"It certainly is,\" declared the foreman of the steel workers, who had  helped in casting many big guns. \"No cannon ever made can equal it. You  win, Tom Swift!\"    \"Bless my armor plate!\" gasped Mr. Damon. \"What attacking ship against  the Panama Canal could float after a shot like that.\"    \"Not one,\" declared Tom; \"especially after I put a bursting charge into  the projectile. We'll try that next.\"    By means of compressed air the gases and some particles of the  unexploded powder were blown out of the big cannon. Then it was loaded  again, the projectile this time carrying a bursting charge of another  explosive that would be set off by concussion.    Once more they retired to the bombproof, and again the great gun was  fired. Once more the ground shook, and they were nearly deafened by the  shock.    Then, as they looked toward the distant hillside, they saw a shower of  earth and great rocks rise up. It was like a sand geyser. Then, when  this settled back again, there was left a gaping hole in the side of  the mountain.    \"That does the business!\" cried Tom. \"My cannon is a success!\"    The last shot did not go quite as far as the first, but it was because  a different kind of projectile was used. Tom was perfectly satisfied,  however. Several more trials were given the gun, and each one confirmed  the young inventor in his belief that he had made a wonderful weapon.    \"If that doesn't fortify the Panama Canal nothing will,\" declared Ned.    \"Well, I hope I can convince Uncle Sam of that,\" spoke Tom, simply.    The muzzle velocity and the pressure were equal to Tom's highest hopes.  He knew, now, that he had hit on just the right mixture of powder, and  that his gun was correctly proportioned.  It showed not the slightest  strain.    \"Now we'll try another bursting shell,\" he said, after a rest, during  which some records were made. \"Then we'll call it a day's work. Koku,  bring up some more powder. I'll use a little heavier charge this time.\"    It was while the gun was being loaded that a horseman was seen riding  wildly down the valley. He was waving a red flag in his hand.    \"Bless my watch chain!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"What's that?\"    \"It looks as though he was coming to give us a warning,\" suggested the  steel foreman.    \"Maybe someone has kicked about our shooting,\" remarked Ned.    \"I hope not,\" murmured Tom.    He looked at the horseman anxiously. The rider came nearer and nearer,  wildly waving his flag. He seemed to be shouting something, but his  words could not be made out. Finally he came near enough to be heard.    \"The dam! The dam!\" he cried. \"It's bursting. Your shots have hastened  it. The cracks are widening. You'd better get away!\" And he galloped on.    \"Bless my toilet soap!\" gasped Mr. Damon.    \"I was afraid of this!\" murmured Tom. \"But, since our shots have  hastened the disaster, maybe we can avert it.\"    \"How?\" demanded Ned.    \"I'll show you. All hands come here and we'll shift this gun. I want it  to point at that big white stone!\" and he indicated an immense boulder,  well up the valley, near the place where the two great gulches joined.          CHAPTER XVIII    THE DOPED POWDER      \"What are you going to do, Tom?\" cried Ned, as he, with the others,  worked the hand gear that shifted the big gun. When it was permanently  mounted electricity would accomplish this work.  \"What's your game,  Tom?\"    \"Don't you remember, Ned? When we were talking about the chance of the  dam bursting, I said if the current of suddenly released water could be  turned into the other valley, the people below us would be saved.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to fire a bursting shell  at the point where the two valleys come together.  I'll break down the  barrier of rock and stone between them.\"    \"Bless my shovel and hoe!\" cried Mr. Damon.    \"If we can turn enough of the water into the other valley, where no one  lives, and where it can escape into the big river there, the amount  that will flow down this valley will be so small that only a little  damage will be done.\"    \"That's right!\" declared the steel foreman, as he caught Tom's idea.  \"It's the only way it could be done, too, for there won't be time to  make the necessary excavation any other way. Is the gun swung around  far enough, Mr. Swift?\"    \"No, a little more toward me,\" answered Tom, as he peered through the  telescope sights. \"There, that will do. Now to get the proper  elevation,\" and he began to work the other apparatus, having estimated  the range as well as he could.    In a few seconds the giant cannon was properly trained on the white  rock. Meanwhile the horseman, with his red flag, had continued on down  the valley. In spite of his warning of the night before, it developed  that a number had disregarded it, and had remained in their homes. Most  of the inhabitants, however, had fled to the hills, to stay in tents,  or with such neighbors as could accommodate them. Some lingered to move  their household goods, while others fled with what they could carry.    It was to see that the town was deserted by these late-stayers that the  messenger rode, crying his warning as did the messenger at the bursting  of the Johnstown dam twenty-odd years ago.    \"The projectile!\" cried Tom, as he saw that all was in readiness.  \"Lively now! I can see the top of the dam beginning to crumble,\" and he  laid aside the telescope he had been using.    The projectile, with a heavy charge of bursting powder, was slung into  the breech of the gun.    \"Now the powder, Koku!\" called Tom. \"Be quick; but not so fast that you  drop any of it.\"    \"Me fetch,\" responded the giant, as he hastened toward the small cave  where the explosive was kept. As the big man brought the first lot, and  Ned was about to insert it in the breech of the gun, behind the  projectile, Tom exclaimed:    \"Just let me have a look at that. It's some that I first made, and I  want to be sure it hasn't gone stale.\"    Critically he looked at the powerful explosive. As he did so a change  came over his face.    \"Here, Koku!\" the young inventor said. \"Where did you get this?\"    \"In cave, Master.\"    \"Is there any more left?\"    \"Only enough for this one shoot.\"    \"By Jove!\" muttered Tom. \"There's been some trick played here!\" and he  set off on a run toward the bomb-proof.    \"What's the matter?\" cried Ned, as he noticed the agitation of his chum.    \"The powder has been doped!\" yelled Tom. \"Something has been put in it  to make it nonexplosive. It's no good. It wouldn't send that shell a  thousand yards, and it's got to go five miles to do any good. My plan  won't work.\"    \"Doped the powder?\" gasped Ned. \"Who could have done it?\"    \"I don't know. There must have been some spy at work. Quick, run and  ask the foreman if any of his men are missing. I'll see if there's  enough of the good powder left to break down the barrier!\"    Ned was away like a shot, while the others, not knowing what to make of  the strange conduct of the two lads, looked on in wonder.  Tom raced  toward the cave where"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13610"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 1 (#17)"],[1,"of the more modest sex, and in modesty generally. Our Venuses, as  Lucretius long since remarked and Montaigne after him, are careful to  conceal from their lovers the _vita postscenia_, and that fantastic fate  which placed so near together the supreme foci of physical attraction and  physical repugnance, has immensely contributed to build up all the  subtlest coquetries of courtship. Whatever stimulates self-confidence and  lulls the fear of evoking disgust--whether it is the presence of a beloved  person in whose good opinion complete confidence is felt, or whether it is  merely the grosser narcotizing influence of a slight degree of  intoxication--always automatically lulls the emotion of modesty.[34]  Together with the animal factor of sexual refusal, this social fear of  evoking disgust seems to me the most fundamental element in modesty.    It is, of course, impossible to argue that the fact of the sacro-pubic  region of the body being the chief focus of concealment proves the  importance of this factor of modesty. But it may fairly be argued that it  owes this position not merely to being the sexual centre, but also as  being the excretory centre. Even among many lower mammals, as well as  among birds and insects, there is a well-marked horror of dirt, somewhat  disguised by the varying ways in which an animal may be said to define  \"dirt.\" Many animals spend more time and energy in the duties of  cleanliness than human beings, and they often show well-marked anxiety to  remove their own excrement, or to keep away from it.[35] Thus this element  of modesty also may be said to have an animal basis.    It is on this animal basis that the human and social fear of arousing  disgust has developed. Its probably wide extension is indicated not only  by the strong feeling attached to the constant presence of clothing on  this part of the body,--such constant presence being quite uncalled for if  the garment or ornament is merely a sort of sexual war-paint,--but by the  repugnance felt by many savages very low down in the scale to the public  satisfaction of natural needs, and to their more than civilized  cleanliness in this connection;[36] it is further of interest to note that  in some parts of the world the covering is not in front, but behind;  though of this fact there are probably other explanations. Among civilized  people, also, it may be added, the final and invincible seat of modesty is  sometimes not around the pubes, but the anus; that is to say, that in such  cases the fear of arousing disgust is the ultimate and most fundamental  element of modesty.[37]        The concentration of modesty around the anus is sometimes very      marked. Many women feel so high a degree of shame and reserve      with regard to this region, that they are comparatively      indifferent to an anterior examination of the sexual organs. A      similar feeling is not seldom found in men. \"I would permit of an      examination of my genitals by a medical man, without any feeling      of discomfort,\" a correspondent writes, \"but I think I would      rather die than submit to any rectal examination.\" Even      physicians have been known to endure painful rectal disorders for      years, rather than undergo examination.        \"Among ordinary English girls,\" a medical correspondent writes,      \"I have often noticed that the dislike and shame of allowing a      man to have sexual intercourse with them, when newly married, is      simply due to the fact that the sexual aperture is so closely      apposed to the anus and bladder. If the vulva and vagina were      situated between a woman's shoulder blades, and a man had a      separate instrument for coitus, not used for any excretory      purpose, I do not think women would feel about intercourse as      they sometimes do. Again, in their ignorance of anatomy, women      often look upon the vagina and womb as part of the bowel and its      exit of discharge, and sometimes say, for instance,      'inflammation of the _bowel_', when they mean _womb_. Again,      many, perhaps most, women believe that they pass water through      the vagina, and are ignorant of the existence of the separate      urethral orifice. Again, women associate the vulva with the anus,      and so feel ashamed of it; even when speaking to their husbands,      or to a doctor, or among themselves; they have absolutely no name      for the vulva (I mean among the upper classes, and people of      gentle birth), but speak of it as 'down below,' 'low down,' etc.\"        Even though this feeling is largely based on wrong and ignorant      ideas, it must still be recognized that it is to some extent      natural and inevitable. \"How much is risked,\" exclaims Dugas, \"in      the privacies of love! The results may be disillusion, disgust,      the consciousness of physical imperfection, of brutality or      coldness, of aesthetic disenchantment, of a sentimental shock,      seen or divined. To be without modesty, that is to say, to have      no fear of the ordeals of love, one must be sure of one's self,      of one's grace, of one's physical emotions, of one's feelings,      and be sure, moreover, of the effect of all these on the nerves,      the imagination, and the heart of another person. Let us suppose      modesty reduced to aesthetic discomfort, to a woman's fear of      displeasing, or of not seeming beautiful enough. Even thus      defined, how can modesty avoid being always awake and restless?      What woman could repeat, without risk, the tranquil action of      Phryne? And even in that action, who knows how much may not have      been due to mere professional insolence!\" (Dugas, \"La Pudeur,\"      _Revue Philosophique_, November, 1903.) \"Men and Women,\" Schurtz      points out (_Altersklassen und Maennerbuende_, pp. 41-51), \"have      certainly the capacity mutually to supplement and enrich each      other; but when this completion fails, or is not sought, the      difference may easily become a strong antipathy;\" and he proceeds      to develop the wide-reaching significance of this psychic fact.    I have emphasized the proximity of the excretory centres to the sexual  focus in discussing this important factor of modesty, because, in  analyzing so complex and elusive an emotion as modesty it is desirable to  keep as near as possible to the essential and fundamental facts on which  it is based. It is scarcely necessary to point out that, in ordinary  civilized society, these fundamental facts are not usually present at the  surface of consciousness and may even be absent altogether; on the  foundation of them may arise all sorts of idealized fears, of delicate  reserves, of aesthetic refinements, as the emotions of love become more  complex and more subtle, and the crude simplicity of the basis on which  they finally rest becomes inevitably concealed.    Another factor of modesty, which reaches a high development in savagery,  is the ritual element, especially the idea of ceremonial uncleanness,  based on a dread of the supernatural influences which the sexual organs  and functions are supposed to exert. It may be to some extent rooted in  the elements already referred to, and it leads us into a much wider field  than that of modesty, so that it is only necessary to touch slightly on it  here; it has been exhaustively studied by Frazer and by Crawley. Offences  against the ritual rendered necessary by this mysterious dread, though  more serious than offences against sexual reticence or the fear of causing  disgust, are so obviously allied that they all reinforce one another and  cannot easily be disentangled.    Nearly everywhere all over the world at a primitive stage of thought, and  even to some extent in the highest civilization, the sight of the sexual  organs or of the sexual act, the image or even the names of the sexual  parts of either man or woman, are believed to have a curiously potent  influence, sometimes beneficent, but quite as often maleficent. The two  kinds of influence may even be combined, and Riedel, quoted by Ploss and  Bartels,[38] states that the Ambon islanders carve a schematic  representation of the vulva on their fruit trees, in part to promote the  productiveness of the trees, and in part to scare any unauthorized person  who might be tempted to steal the fruit. The precautions prescribed as  regards coitus at Loango[39] are evidently associated with religious  fears. In Ceylon, again (as a medical correspondent there informs me),  where the penis is worshipped and held sacred, a native never allows it to  be seen, except under compulsion, by a doctor, and even a wife must  neither see it nor touch it nor ask for coitus, though she must grant as  much as the husband desires. All savage and barbarous peoples who have  attained any high degree of ceremonialism have included the functions not  only of sex, but also of excretion, more or less stringently within the  bounds of that ceremonialism.[40] It is only necessary to refer to the  Jewish ritual books of the Old Testament, to Hesiod, and to the customs  prevalent among Mohammedan peoples. Modesty in eating, also, has its roots  by no means only in the fear of causing disgust, but very largely in this  kind of ritual, and Crawley has shown how numerous and frequent among  primitive peoples are the religious implications of eating and  drinking.[41] So profound is this dread of the sacred mystery of sex, and  so widespread is the ritual based upon it, that some have imagined that  here alone we may find the complete explanation of modesty, and Salomon  Reinach declares that \"at the origin of the emotion of modesty lies a  taboo.\"[42]        Durkheim (\"La Prohibition de l'Inceste,\" _L'Annee Sociologique_,      1898, p. 50), arguing that whatever sense of repugnance women may      inspire must necessarily reach the highest point around the womb,      which is hence subjected to the most stringent taboo,"]]]
