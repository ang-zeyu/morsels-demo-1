[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11952"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 2 (#17)"],[1,"lustration: The Battle of Bouvines----81]    It is difficult to determine, from the evidence of contemporaries, which  was the more rejoiced at and proud of this victory, king or people.  \"The  same day, when evening approached,\" says William the Breton, \"the army  returned laden with spoils to the camp; and the king, with a heart full  of joy and gratitude, offered a thousand thanksgivings to the Supreme  King, who had vouchsaved to him a triumph over so many enemies.  And in  order that posterity might preserve forever a memorial of so great a  success, the Bishop of Senlis founded, outside the walls of that town, a  chapel, which he named Victory, and which, endowed with great possessions  and having a government according to canonical rule, enjoyed the honor of  possessing an abbot and a holy convent.  .  .  .  Who can recount,  imagine, or set down with a pen, on parchment or tablets, the cheers of  joy, the hymns of triumph, and the numberless dances of the people; the  sweet chants of the clergy; the harmonious sounds of warlike instruments;  the solemn decorations of the churches, inside and out; the streets, the  houses, the roads of all the castles and towns, hung with curtains and  tapestry of silk and covered with flowers, shrubs and green branches; all  the inhabitants of every sort, sex, and age running from every quarter to  see so grand a triumph; peasants and harvesters breaking off their work,  hanging round their necks their sickles and hoes (for it was the season  of harvest), and throwing themselves in a throng upon the roads to see in  irons that Count of Flanders, that Fernand whose arms they had formerly  dreaded!\"    It was no groundless joy on the part of the people, and a spontaneous  instinct gave them a forecast of the importance of that triumph which  elicited their cheers.  The battle of Bouvines was not the victory of  Philip Augustus, alone, over a coalition of foreign princes; the victory  was the work of king and people, barons, knights, burghers, and peasants  of Ile-de-France, of Orleanness, of Picardy, of Normandy, of Champagne,  and of Burgundy.  And this union of different classes and different  populations in a sentiment, a contest, and a triumph shared in common was  a decisive step in the organization and unity of France.  The victory of  Bouvines marked the commencement of the time at which men might speak,  and indeed did speak, by one single name, of the French.  The nation in  France and the kingship in France on that day rose out of and above the  feudal system.    Philip Augustus was about the same time apprised of his son Louis's  success on the banks of the Loire.  The incapacity and swaggering  insolence of King John had made all his Poitevine allies disgusted with  him; he had been obliged to abandon his attack upon the King of France in  the provinces, and the insurrection, growing daily more serious, of the  English barons and clergy for the purpose of obtaining Magna Charta was  preparing for him other reverses.  He had ceased to be a dangerous rival  to Philip.    No period has had better reason than our own to know how successes and  conquests can intoxicate warlike kings; but Philip, whose valor, on  occasion, was second to none, had no actual inclination towards war or  towards conquest for the sole pleasure of extending his dominion.  \"Liking better, according to his custom,\" says William the Breton, \"to  conquer by peace than by war,\" he hasted to put an end by treaties,  truces, or contracts to his quarrels with King John, the Count of  Flanders, and the principal lords made prisoners at Bouvines; discretion,  in his case, was proof against the temptations of circumstances, or the  promptings of passion, and he took care not to overtly compromise his  power, his responsibility, and the honor of his name by enterprises which  did not naturally come in his way, or which he considered without chances  of success.  Whilst still a youth, he had given, in 1191, a sure proof of  that self-command which is so rare amongst ambitious princes by  withdrawing from the crusade in which he had been engaged with Richard  Coeur de Lion; and it was still more apparent in two great events at the  latter end of his reign--the crusade against the Albigensians and his son  Louis's expedition in England, the crown of which had, in 1215, been  offered to him by the barons at war with King John in defence of Magna  Charta.    The organization of the kingdom, the nation, and the kingship in France  was not the only great event and the only great achievement of that  epoch.  At the same time that this political movement was going on in the  State, a religious and intellectual ferment was making head in the Church  and in men's minds.  After the conquest of the Gauls by the Franks, the  Christian clergy, sole depositaries of all lights to lighten their age,  and sole possessors of any idea of opposing the conquerors with arguments  other than those of brute force, or of employing towards the vanquished  any instrument of subjection other than violence, became the connecting  link between the nation of the conquerors and the nation of the  conquered, and, in the name of one and the same divine law, enjoined  obedience on the subjects, and, in the case of the masters, moderated the  transports of power.  But in the course of this active and salutary  participation in the affairs of the world, the Christian clergy lost  somewhat of their primitive and proper character; religion in their hands  was a means of power as well as of civilization; and its principal  members became rich, and frequently substituted material weapons for the  spiritual authority which had originally been their only reliance.  When  they were in a condition to hold their own against powerful laymen, they  frequently adopted the powerful laymen's morals and shared their  ignorance; and in the seventh and eighth centuries the barbarism which  held the world in its clutches had made inroads upon the Church.  Charlemagne essayed to resuscitate dying civilization, and sought amongst  the clergy his chief means of success; he founded schools, filled them  with students to whom promises of ecclesiastical preferments were held  out as rewards of their merit, and, in fine, exerted himself with all his  might to restore to the Christian Church her dignity and her influence.  When Charlemagne was dead, nearly all his great achievements disappeared  in the chaos which came after him; his schools alone survived and  preserved certain centres of intellectual activity.  When the feudal  system had become established, and had introduced some rule into social  relations, when the fate of mankind appeared no longer entirely left to  the risks of force, intellect once more found some sort of employment,  and once more assumed some sort of sway.  Active and educated minds once  more began to watch with some sort of independence the social facts  before their eyes, to stigmatize vices and to seek for remedies.  The  spectacle afforded by their age could not fail to strike them.  Society,  after having made some few strides away from physical chaos, seemed in  danger of falling into moral chaos; morals had sunk far below the laws,  and religion was in deplorable contrast to morals.  It was not laymen  only who abandoned themselves with impunity to every excess of violence  and licentiousness; scandals were frequent amongst the clergy themselves;  bishoprics and other ecclesiastical benefices, publicly sold or left by  will, passed down through families from father to son, and from husband  to wife, and the possessions of the Church served for dowry to the  daughters of bishops.  Absolution was at a low quotation in the market,  and redemption for sins of the greatest enormity cost scarcely the price  of founding a church or a monastery.  Horror-stricken at the sight of  such corruption in the only things they at that time recognized as holy,  men no longer knew where to find the rule of life or the safeguard of  conscience.  But it is the peculiar and glorious characteristic of  Christianity that it is unable to bear for long, without making an effort  to check them, the vices it has been unable to prevent, and that it  always carries in its womb the vigorous germ of human regeneration.  In  the midst of their irregularities, the eleventh and twelfth centuries saw  the outbreak of a grand religious, moral, and intellectual fermentation,  and it was the Church herself that had the honor and the power of taking  the initiative in the reformation.  Under the influence of Gregory VII.  the rigor of the popes began to declare itself against the scandals of  the episcopate, the traffic in ecclesiastical benefices, and the bad  morals of the secular clergy.  At the same time, austere men exerted  themselves to rekindle the fervor of monastic life, re-established rigid  rules in the cloister, and refilled the monasteries by their preaching  and example.  St. Robert of Moleme founded the order of Citeaux; St.  Norbert that of Premontre; St. Bernard detached Clairvaux from Meaux,  which he considered too worldly; St. Bruno built Chartreuse; St. Hugo,  St. Gerard, and others besides gave the Abbey of Cluni its renown; and  ecclesiastical reform extended everywhere.  Hereupon rich and powerful  laymen, filled with ardor for their faith or fear for their eternal  welfare, went seeking after solitude, and devoted themselves to prayer in  the monasteries they had founded or enriched with their wealth; whole  families were dispersed amongst various religious houses; and all the  severities of penance hardly sufficed to quiet imaginations scared at the  perils of living in the world or at the vices of their age.  And, at the  same time, in addition to this outburst of piety, ignorance was decried  and stigmatized as the source of the prevailing evils; the function of  teaching was included amongst the duties of the religious estate; and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11953"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 3 (#17)"],[1," sufficient ceremony.  \"Isle-Adam,\" said he, \"is that the robe of a  marshal of France?\"  \"Sir, I had this whity-gray robe made to come hither  by water aboard of Seine-boats.\"  \"Ha!\" said the king, \"look you a prince  in the face when you speak to him?\"  \"Sir, it is the custom in France,  that when one man speaks to another, of whatever rank and puissance that  other may be, he passes for a sorry fellow, and but little honorable, if  he dares not look him in the face.\"  \"It is not our fashion,\" said the  king; and the subject dropped there.  A popular poet of the time, Alan  Chattier, constituted himself censor of the moral corruption and  interpreter of the patriotic paroxysms caused by the cold and harsh  supremacy of this unbending foreigner, who set himself up for king of  France, and had not one feeling in sympathy with the French.  Alan  Chartier's _Quadriloge invectif_ is a lively and sometimes eloquent  allegory, in which France personified implores her three children, the  clergy, the chivalry, and the people, to forget their own quarrels and  unite to save their mother whilst saving themselves; and this political  pamphlet getting spread about amongst the provinces did good service to  the national cause against the foreign conqueror.  An event more powerful  than any human eloquence occurred to give the _dauphin_ and his partisans  earlier hopes.  Towards the end of August, 1422, Henry V.  fell ill; and,  too stout-hearted to delude himself as to his condition, he thought no  longer of anything but preparing himself for death.  He had himself  removed to Vincennes, called his councillors about him, and gave them his  last royal instructions.  \"I leave you the government of France,\" said he  to his brother, the Duke of Bedford, \"unless our brother of Burgundy have  a mind to undertake it; for, above all things, I conjure you not to have  any dissension with him.  If that should happen God preserve you from it!  --the affairs of this kingdom, which seem well advanced for us, would  become bad.\"  As soon as he had done with politics he bade his doctors  tell him how long he had still to live.  One of them knelt down before  his bed and said, \"Sir, be thinking of your soul; it seemeth to us that,  saving the divine mercy, you have not more than two hours.\"  The king  summoned his confessor with the priests, and asked to have recited to him  the penitential psalms.  When they came to the twentieth versicle of the  _Miserere,--Ut oedificentur muri Hierusalem_ (that the walls of Jerusalem  may be built up),--He made them stop.  \"Ah!\" said he, \"if God had been  pleased to let me live out my time, I would, after putting an end to the  war in France, reducing the _dauphin_ to submission or driving him out of  the kingdom in which I would have established a sound peace, have gone to  conquer Jerusalem.  The wars I have undertaken have had the approval of  all the proper men and of the most holy personages; I commenced them and  have prosecuted them without offence to God or peril to my soul.\"  These  were his last words.  The chanting of the psalms was resumed around him,  and he expired on the 31st of August, 1422, at the age of thirty-four.  A  great soul and a great king; but a great example also of the boundless  errors which may be fallen into by the greatest men when they pursue with  arrogant confidence their own views, forgetting the laws of justice and  the rights of other men.    On the 22d of October, 1422, less than two months after the death of  Henry V., Charles VI., King of France, died at Paris in the forty-third  year of his reign.  As soon as he had been buried at St. Denis, the Duke  of Bedford, regent of France according to the will of Henry V., caused a  herald to proclaim, \"Long live Henry of Lancaster, King of England and of  France!\"  The people's voice made very different proclamation.  It had  always been said that the public evils proceeded from the state of  illness into which the unhappy King Charles had fallen.  The goodness he  had given glimpses of in his lucid intervals had made him an object of  tender pity.  Some weeks yet before his death, when he had entered Paris  again, the inhabitants, in the midst of their sufferings and under the  harsh government of the English, had seen with joy their poor mad king  coming back amongst them, and had greeted him with thousand-fold shouts  of \"Noel!\"  His body lay in state for three days, with the face  uncovered, in a hall of the hostel of St. Paul, and the multitude went  thither to pray for him, saying, \"Ah! dear prince, never shall we have  any so good as thou Wert; never shall we see thee more.  Accursed be thy  death!  Since thou dost leave us, we shall never have aught but wars and  troubles.  As for thee, thou goest to thy rest; as for us, we remain in  tribulation and sorrow.  We seem made to fall into the same distress as  the children of Israel during the captivity in Babylon.\"    [Illustration: The Body of Charles VI. lying in State----84]    The people's instinct was at the same time right and wrong.  France had  yet many evil days to go through and cruel trials to endure; she was,  however, to be saved at last; Charles VI. was to be followed by Charles  VII. and Joan of Arc.          CHAPTER XXIV.----THE HUNDRED YEARS' WAR.--CHARLES VII. AND JOAN  OF ARC.  1422-1461.    [Illustration: PORTRAIT OF JOAN OF ARC----85]    Whilst Charles VI. was dying at Paris, his son Charles, the _dauphin_,  was on his way back from Saintonge to Berry, where he usually resided.  On the 24th of October, 1422, at Mehun-sur-Yevre, he heard of his  father's death.  For six days longer, from the 24th to the 29th of  October, he took no style but that of regent, as if he were waiting to  see what was going to happen elsewhere in respect of the succession to  the throne.  It was only when he knew that, on the 27th of October, the  parliament of Paris had, not without some little hesitation and  ambiguity, recognized \"as King of England and of France, Henry VI., son  of Henry V. lately deceased,\" that the _dauphin_ Charles assumed on the  30th of October, in his castle of Mehun-sur-Yevre, the title of king, and  repaired to Bourges to inaugurate in the cathedral of that city his reign  as Charles VII.    [Illustration: The Shepherdess of Domremy----90]    He was twenty years old, and had as yet done nothing to gain for himself,  not to say anything of glory, the confidence and hopes of the people.  He  passed for an indolent and frivolous prince, abandoned to his pleasures  only; one whose capacity there was nothing to foreshadow, and of whom  France, outside of his own court, scarcely ever thought at all.  Some  days before his accession he had all but lost his life at Rochelle by the  sudden breaking down of the room in the episcopal palace where he was  staying; and so little did the country know of what happened to him that,  a short time after the accident, messengers sent by some of his partisans  had arrived at Bourges to inquire if the prince were still living.  At a  time when not only the crown of the kingdom, but the existence and  independence of the nation, were at stake, Charles had not given any  signs of being strongly moved by patriotic feelings.  \"He was, in person,  a handsome prince, and handsome in speech with all persons, and  compassionate towards poor folks,\" says his contemporary Monstrelet; \"but  he did not readily put on his harness, and he had no heart for war if he  could do without it.\"  On ascending the throne, this young prince, so  little of the politician and so little of the knight, encountered at the  head of his enemies the most able amongst the politicians and warriors of  the day in the Duke of Bedford, whom his brother Henry V. had appointed  regent of France, and had charged to defend on behalf of his nephew,  Henry VI., a child in the cradle, the crown of France, already more than  half won.  Never did struggle appear more unequal or native king more  inferior to foreign pretender.    Sagacious observers, however, would have easily discerned in the cause  which appeared the stronger and the better supported many seeds of  weakness and danger.  When Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, heard at  Arras, that Charles VI. was dead, it occurred to him immediately that if  he attended the obsequies of the English King of France he would be  obliged, French prince as he was, and cousin-german of Charles VI., to  yield precedence to John, Duke of Bedford, regent of France, and uncle of  the new king, Henry VI.  He resolved to hold aloof, and contented himself  with sending to Paris chamberlains to make his excuses and supply his  place with the regent.  On the 11th of November, 1422, the Duke of  Bedford followed alone at the funeral of the late king of France, and  alone made offering at the mass.  Alone he went, but with the sword of  state borne before him as regent.  The people of Paris cast down their  eyes with restrained wrath.  \"They wept,\" says a contemporary, \"and not  without cause, for they knew not whether for a long, long while they  would have any king in France.\"  But they did not for long confine  themselves to tears.  Two poets, partly in Latin and partly in French,  Robert Blondel, and Alan Chartier, whilst deploring the public woes,  excited the popular feeling.  Conspiracies soon followed the songs.  One  was set on foot at Paris to deliver the city to king Charles VII., but it  was stifled ruthlessly; several burgesses were beheaded, and one woman  was burned.  In several great provincial cities, at Troyes and at Rheims,  the same ferment showed itself, and drew down the same severity.  William  Prieuse, superior of the Carmelites, was accused of propagating  sentiments favorable to the _dauphin_, as the English called Charles VII.  Being brought, in spite of the privileges of his gown, before John  Cauchon, lieutenant of the captain of Rheims [related probably to Peter  Cauchon, Bishop of"]]]
