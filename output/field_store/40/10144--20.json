In emotional, as in other matters,  Oolanga was distinctly a utilitarian, and as he could not understand  anyone feeling grief except for his own suffering, pain, or for the loss  of money, he could not understand anyone simulating such an emotion  except for show intended to deceive.  He thought that she had come to  Castra Regis again for the opportunity of stealing something, and was  determined that on this occasion the chance of pressing his advantage  over her should not pass.  He felt, therefore, that the occasion was one  for extra carefulness in the watching of all that went on.  Ever since he  had come to the conclusion that Lady Arabella was trying to steal the  treasure-chest, he suspected nearly everyone of the same design, and made  it a point to watch all suspicious persons and places.  As Adam was  engaged on his own researches regarding Lady Arabella, it was only  natural that there should be some crossing of each other's tracks.  This  is what did actually happen.    Adam had gone for an early morning survey of the place in which he was  interested, taking with him the mongoose in its box.  He arrived at the  gate of Diana's Grove just as Lady Arabella was preparing to set out for  Castra Regis on what she considered her mission of comfort.  Seeing Adam  from her window going through the shadows of the trees round the gate,  she thought that he must be engaged on some purpose similar to her own.  So, quickly making her toilet, she quietly left the house, and, taking  advantage of every shadow and substance which could hide her, followed  him on his walk.    Oolanga, the experienced tracker, followed her, but succeeded in hiding  his movements better than she did.  He saw that Adam had on his shoulder  a mysterious box, which he took to contain something valuable.  Seeing  that Lady Arabella was secretly following Adam, he was confirmed in this  idea.  His mind--such as it was--was fixed on her trying to steal, and he  credited her at once with making use of this new opportunity.    In his walk, Adam went into the grounds of Castra Regis, and Oolanga saw  her follow him with great secrecy.  He feared to go closer, as now on  both sides of him were enemies who might make discovery.  When he  realised that Lady Arabella was bound for the Castle, he devoted himself  to following her with singleness of purpose.  He therefore missed seeing  that Adam branched off the track and returned to the high road.    That night Edgar Caswall had slept badly.  The tragic occurrence of the  day was on his mind, and he kept waking and thinking of it.  After an  early breakfast, he sat at the open window watching the kite and thinking  of many things.  From his room he could see all round the neighbourhood,  but the two places that interested him most were Mercy Farm and Diana's  Grove.  At first the movements about those spots were of a humble  kind--those that belong to domestic service or agricultural needs--the  opening of doors and windows, the sweeping and brushing, and generally  the restoration of habitual order.    From his high window--whose height made it a screen from the observation  of others--he saw the chain of watchers move into his own grounds, and  then presently break up--Adam Salton going one way, and Lady Arabella,  followed by the nigger, another.  Then Oolanga disappeared amongst the  trees; but Caswall could see that he was still watching.  Lady Arabella,  after looking around her, slipped in by the open door, and he could, of  course, see her no longer.    Presently, however, he heard a light tap at his door, then the door  opened slowly, and he could see the flash of Lady Arabella's white dress  through the opening.          CHAPTER XVI--A VISIT OF SYMPATHY      Caswall was genuinely surprised when he saw Lady Arabella, though he need  not have been, after what had already occurred in the same way.  The look  of surprise on his face was so much greater than Lady Arabella had  expected--though she thought she was prepared to meet anything that might  occur--that she stood still, in sheer amazement.  Cold-blooded as she was  and ready for all social emergencies, she was nonplussed how to go on.  She was plucky, however, and began to speak at once, although she had not  the slightest idea what she was going to say.    \"I came to offer you my very warm sympathy with the grief you have so  lately experienced.\"    \"My grief?  I'm afraid I must be very dull; but I really do not  understand.\"    Already she felt at a disadvantage, and hesitated.    \"I mean about the old man who died so suddenly--your old . . . retainer.\"    Caswall's face relaxed something of its puzzled concentration.    \"Oh, he was only a servant; and he had over-stayed his three-score and  ten years by something like twenty years.  He must have been ninety!\"    \"Still, as an old servant . . . \"    Caswall's words were not so cold as their inflection.    \"I never interfere with servants.  He was kept on here merely because he  had been so long on the premises.  I suppose the steward thought it might  make him unpopular if the old fellow had been dismissed.\"    How on earth was she to proceed on such a task as hers if this was the  utmost geniality she could expect?  So she at once tried another  tack--this time a personal one.    \"I am sorry I disturbed you.  I am really not unconventional--though  certainly no slave to convention.  Still there are limits . . . it is bad  enough to intrude in this way, and I do not know what you can say or  think of the time selected, for the intrusion.\"    After all, Edgar Caswall was a gentleman by custom and habit, so he rose  to the occasion.    \"I can only say, Lady Arabella, that you are always welcome at any time  you may deign to honour my house with your presence.\"    She smiled at him sweetly.    \"Thank you _so_ much.  You _do_ put one at ease.  My breach of convention  makes me glad rather than sorry.  I feel that I can open my heart to you  about anything.\"    Forthwith she proceeded to tell him about Oolanga and his strange  suspicions of her honesty.  Caswall laughed and made her explain all the  details.  His final comment was enlightening.    \"Let me give you a word of advice: If you have the slightest fault to  find with that infernal nigger, shoot him at sight.  A swelled-headed  nigger, with a bee in his bonnet, is one of the worst difficulties in the  world to deal with.  So better make a clean job of it, and wipe him out  at once!\"    \"But what about the law, Mr. Caswall?\"    \"Oh, the law doesn't concern itself much about dead niggers.  A few more  or less do not matter.  To my mind it's rather a relief!\"    \"I'm afraid of you,\" was her only comment, made with a sweet smile and in  a soft voice.    \"All right,\" he said, \"let us leave it at that.  Anyhow, we shall be rid  of one of them!\"    \"I don't love niggers any more than you do,\" she replied, \"and I suppose  one mustn't be too particular where that sort of cleaning up is  concerned.\"  Then she changed in voice and manner, and asked genially:  \"And now tell me, am I forgiven?\"    \"You are, dear lady--if there is anything to forgive.\"    As he spoke, seeing that she had moved to go, he came to the door with  her, and in the most natural way accompanied her downstairs.  He passed  through the hall with her and down the avenue.  As he went back to the  house, she smiled to herself.    \"Well, that is all right.  I don't think the morning has been altogether  thrown away.\"    And she walked slowly back to Diana's Grove.    Adam Salton followed the line of the Brow, and refreshed his memory as to  the various localities.  He got home to Lesser Hill just as Sir Nathaniel  was beginning lunch.  Mr. Salton had gone to Walsall to keep an early  appointment; so he was all alone.  When the meal was over--seeing in  Adam's face that he had something to speak about--he followed into the  study and shut the door.    When the two men had lighted their pipes, Sir Nathaniel began.    \"I have remembered an interesting fact about Diana's Grove--there is, I  have long understood, some strange mystery about that house.  It may be  of some interest, or it may be trivial, in such a tangled skein as we are  trying to unravel.\"    \"Please tell me all you know or suspect.  To begin, then, of what sort  is the mystery--physical, mental, moral, historical, scientific, occult?  Any kind of hint will help me.\"    \"Quite right.  I shall try to tell you what I think; but I have not put  my thoughts on the subject in sequence, so you must forgive me if due  order is not observed in my narration.  I suppose you have seen the house  at Diana's Grove?\"    \"The outside of it; but I have that in my mind's eye, and I can fit into  my memory whatever you may mention.\"    \"The house is very old--probably the first house of some sort that stood  there was in the time of the Romans.  This was probably renewed--perhaps  several times at later periods.  The house stands, or, rather, used to  stand here when Mercia was a kingdom--I do not suppose that the basement  can be later than the Norman Conquest.  Some years ago, when I was  President of the Mercian Archaeological Society, I went all over it very  carefully.  This was when it was purchased by Captain March.  The house  had then been done up, so as to be suitable for the bride.  The basement  is very strong,--almost as strong and as heavy as if it had been intended  as a fortress.  There are a whole series of rooms deep underground.  One  of them in particular struck me.  The room itself is of considerable  size, but the masonry is more than massive.  In the middle of the room is  a sunk well, built up to floor level and evidently going deep  underground.  There is no windlass nor any trace of there ever having  been any--no rope--nothing.

Tut, tut! Caroline is only a small part of it. He has done  more than that--far more, this poacher out of the West!\"    He turned and went swiftly through the door. The moment it was closed  the girl buried her face in her hands.          Chapter Fifteen      _The Girl Thief_    Before that death sentence had been passed on him Ronicky Doone stood  before the door of his room, with the trembling girl beside him.    \"Wait here,\" he whispered to her. \"Wait here while I go in and wake him  up. It's going to be the greatest moment in his life! Poor Bill Gregg is  going to turn into the richest man in New York City--all in one moment!\"    \"But I don't dare go in. It will mean--\"    \"It will mean everything, but it's too late to turn back now. Besides,  in your heart of hearts, you don't want to turn back, you know!\"    Quickly he passed into the room and hurried to the bed of Bill Gregg.  Under the biting grip of Doone's hand Bill Gregg writhed to a sitting  posture, with a groan. Still he was in the throes of his dream and only  half awakened.    \"I've lost her,\" he whispered.    \"You're wrong, idiot,\" said Ronicky softly, \"you're wrong. You've won  her. She's at the door now, waiting to come in.\"    \"Ronicky,\" said Bill Gregg, suddenly awake, \"you've been the finest  friend a man ever had, but, if you make a joke out of her, I'll wring  your neck!\"    \"Sure you would. But, before you do that, jump into your clothes and  open the door.\"    Sleep was still thick enough in the brain of Bill Gregg to make him obey  automatically. He stumbled into his clothes and then shambled dizzily to  the door and opened it. As the light from the room struck down the hall  Ronicky saw his friend stiffen to his full height and strike a hand  across his face.    \"Stars and Stripes!\" exclaimed Bill Gregg. \"The days of the miracles  ain't over!\"    Ronicky Doone turned his back and went to the window. Across the street  rose the forbidding face of the house of John Mark, and it threatened  Ronicky Doone like a clenched hand, brandished against him. The shadow  under the upper gable was like the shadow under a frowning brow. In that  house worked the mind of John Mark. Certainly Ronicky Doone had won the  first stage of the battle between them, but there was more to come--much  more of that battle--and who would win in the end was an open question.  He made up his mind grimly that, whatever happened, he would first ship  Bill Gregg and the girl out of the city, then act as the rear guard to  cover their retreat.    When he returned they had closed the door and were standing back from  one another, with such shining eyes that the heart of Ronicky Doone  leaped. If, for a moment, doubt of his work came to him, it was  banished, as they glanced toward him.    \"I dunno how he did it,\" Bill Gregg was stammering, \"but here it  is--done! Bless you, Ronicky.\"    \"A minute ago,\" said Ronicky, \"it looked to me like the lady didn't know  her own mind, but that seems to be over.\"    \"I found my own mind the moment I saw him,\" said the girl.    Ronicky studied her in wonder. There was no embarrassment, no shame to  have confessed herself. She had the clear brow of a child. Suddenly, it  seemed to Ronicky that he had become an old man, and these were two  children under his protection. He struck into the heart of the problem  at once.    \"The main point,\" he said, \"is to get you two out of town, as quick as  we can. Out West in Bill's country he can take care of you, but back  here this John Mark is a devil and has the strength to stop us. How  quick can you go, Caroline?\"    \"I can never go,\" she said, \"as long as John Mark is alive.\"    \"Then he's as good as dead,\" said Bill Gregg. \"We both got guns, and, no  matter how husky John Mark may be, we'll get at him!\"    The girl shook her head. All the joy had gone out of her face and left  her wistful and misty eyed. \"You don't understand, and I can't tell you.  You can never harm John Mark.\"    \"Why not?\" asked Bill Gregg. \"Has he got a thousand men around him all  the time? Even if he has they's ways of getting at him.\"    \"Not a thousand men,\" said the girl, \"but, you see, he doesn't need  help. He's never failed. That's what they say of him: 'John Mark, the  man who has never lost!'\"    \"Listen to me,\" said Ronicky angrily. \"Seems to me that everybody stands  around and gapes at this gent with the sneer a terrible lot, without a  pile of good reasons behind 'em. Never failed? Why, lady, here's one  night when he's failed and failed bad. He's lost you!\"    \"No,\" said Caroline.    \"Not lost you?\" asked Bill Gregg. \"Say, you ain't figuring on going back  to him?\"    \"I have to go back.\"    \"Why?\" demanded Gregg.    \"It's because of you,\" interpreted Ronicky Doone. \"She knows that, if  she leaves you, Mark will start on your trail. Mark is the name of the  gent with the sneer, Bill.\"    \"He's got to die, then, Ronicky.\"    \"I been figuring on the same thing for a long time, but he'll die hard,  Bill.\"    \"Don't you see?\" asked the girl. \"Both of you are strong men and brave,  but against John Mark I know that you're helpless. It isn't the first  time people have hated him. Hated? Who does anything but hate him? But  that doesn't make any difference. He wins, he always wins, and that's  why I've come to you.\"    She turned to Bill Gregg, but such a sad resignation held her eyes that  Ronicky Doone bowed his head.    \"I've come to tell you that I love you, that I have always loved you,  since I first began writing to you. All of yourself showed through your  letters, plain and strong and simple and true. I've come tonight to tell  you that I love you, but that we can never marry. Not that I fear him  for myself, but for you.\"    \"Listen here,\" said Bill Gregg, \"ain't there police in this town?\"    \"What could they do? In all of the things which he has done no one has  been able to accuse him of a single illegal act--at least no one has  ever been able to prove a thing. And yet he lives by crime. Does that  give you an idea of the sort of man he is?\"    \"A low hound,\" said Bill Gregg bitterly, \"that's what he shows to be.\"    \"Tell me straight,\" said Ronicky, \"what sort of a hold has he got over  you? Can you tell us?\"    \"I have to tell you,\" said the girl gravely, \"if you insist, but won't  you take my word for it and ask no more?\"    \"We have a right to know,\" said Ronicky. \"Bill has a right, and, me  being Bill's friend, I have a right, too.\"    She nodded.    \"First off, what's the way John Mark uses you?\"    She clenched her hands. \"If I tell you that, you will both despise me.\"    \"Try us,\" said Ronicky. \"And you can lay to this, lady, that, when a  gent out of the West says 'partner' to a girl or a man, he means it.  What you do may be bad; what you are is all right. We both know it. The  inside of you is right, lady, no matter what John Mark makes you do. But  tell us straight, what is it?\"    \"He has made me,\" said the girl, her head falling, \"a thief!\"    Ronicky saw Bill Gregg wince, as if someone had struck him in the face.  And he himself waited, curious to see what the big fellow would do. He  had not long to wait. Gregg went straight to the girl and took her  hands.    \"D'you think that makes any difference?\" he asked. \"Not to me, and not  to my friend Ronicky. There's something behind it. Tell us that!\"    \"There is something behind it,\" said the girl, \"and I can't say how  grateful I am to you both for still trusting me. I have a brother. He  came to New York to work, found it was easy to spend money--and spent  it. Finally he began sending home for money. We are not rich, but we  gave him what we could. It went on like that for some time. Then, one  day, a stranger called at our house, and it was John Mark. He wanted to  see me, and, when we talked together, he told me that my brother had  done a terrible thing--what it was I can't tell even you.    \"I wouldn't believe at first, though he showed me what looked like  proofs. At last I believed enough to agree to go to New York and see for  myself. I came here, and saw my brother and made him confess. What it  was I can't tell you. I can only say that his life is in the hand of  John Mark. John Mark has only to say ten words, and my brother is dead.  He told me that. He showed me the hold that Mark had over him, and  begged me to do what I could for him. I didn't see how I could be of use  to him, but John Mark showed me. He taught me to steal, and I have  stolen. He taught me to lie, and I have lied. And he has me still in the  hollow of his hand, do you see? And that's why I say that it's hopeless.  Even if you could fight against John Mark, which no one can, you  couldn't help me. The moment you strike him he strikes my brother.\"    \"Curse him!\" exclaimed Ronicky. \"Curse the hound!\" Then he added:  \"They's just one thing to do, first of all. You got to go back to John  Mark. Tell him that you came over here. Tell him that you seen Bill  Gregg, but you only came to say good-by to him, and to ask him to leave  town and go West. Then, tomorrow, we'll move out, and he may think that  we've gone. Meantime the thing you do is to give me the name of your  brother and tell me where I can find him. I'll hunt him up. Maybe  something can be done for him. I dunno, but that's where we've got to  try.\"    \"But--\" she began.    \"Do what he says,\" whispered Bill Gregg. \"I've doubted Ronicky before,  but look at all that he's done? Do what he says, Caroline.\"    \"It means putting him in your power,\" she said at last, \"just as he was  put in the power of John Mark, but I trust you. Give me a slip of paper,  and I'll write on it what you want.\"          Chapter Sixteen      _Disarming Suspicion_    From the house across the street Caroline Smith slipped out upon the  pavement and glanced warily about her.
