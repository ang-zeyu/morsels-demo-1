In his struggles  Kazan sprung the remaining two traps. One of them missed. The fifth, and  last, caught him by a hindfoot.    This was a little past midnight. From then until morning the earth and  snow under the windfall were torn up by the struggles of the wolf, the  dog and the lynx to regain their freedom. And when morning came, all  three were exhausted, and lay on their sides, panting and with bleeding  jaws, waiting for the coming of man--and death.    Henri and Weyman were out early. When they struck off the main line  toward the windfall, Henri pointed to the tracks of Kazan and Gray Wolf,  and his dark face lighted up with pleasure and excitement. When they  reached the shelter under the mass of fallen timber, both stood  speechless for a moment, astounded by what they saw. Even Henri had seen  nothing like this before--two wolves and a lynx, all in traps, and  almost within reach of one another's fangs. But surprise could not long  delay the business of Henri's hunter's instinct. The wolves lay first in  his path, and he was raising his rifle to put a steel-capped bullet  through the base of Kazan's brain, when Weyman caught him eagerly by the  arm. Weyman was staring. His fingers dug into Henri's flesh. His eyes  had caught a glimpse of the steel-studded collar about Kazan's neck.    \"Wait!\" he cried. \"It's not a wolf. It's a dog!\"    Henri lowered his rifle, staring at the collar. Weyman's eyes shot to  Gray Wolf. She was facing them, snarling, her white fangs bared to the  foes she could not see. Her blind eyes were closed. Where there should  have been eyes there was only hair, and an exclamation broke from  Weyman's lips.    \"Look!\" he commanded of Henri. \"What in the name of heaven--\"    \"One is dog--wild dog that has run to the wolves,\" said Henri. \"And the  other is--wolf.\"    \"And _blind_!\" gasped Weyman.    \"_Oui_, blind, m'sieur,\" added Henri, falling partly into French in his  amazement. He was raising his rifle again. Weyman seized it firmly.    [Illustration: \"Wait! it's not a wolf!\"]    \"Don't kill them, Henri,\" he said. \"Give them to me--alive. Figure up  the value of the lynx they have destroyed, and add to that the wolf  bounty, and I will pay. Alive, they are worth to me a great deal. My  God, a dog--and a blind wolf--_mates_!\"    He still held Henri's rifle, and Henri was staring at him, as if he did  not yet quite understand.    Weyman continued speaking, his eyes and face blazing.    \"A dog--and a blind wolf--_mates_!\" he repeated. \"It is wonderful,  Henri. Down there, they will say I have gone beyond _reason_, when my  book comes out. But I shall have proof. I shall take twenty photographs  here, before you kill the lynx. I shall keep the dog and the wolf alive.  And I shall pay you, Henri, a hundred dollars apiece for the two. May I  have them?\"    Henri nodded. He held his rifle in readiness, while Weyman unpacked his  camera and got to work. Snarling fangs greeted the click of the  camera-shutter--the fangs of wolf and lynx. But Kazan lay cringing, not  through fear, but because he still recognized the mastery of man. And  when he had finished with his pictures, Weyman approached almost within  reach of him, and spoke even more kindly to him than the man who had  lived back in the deserted cabin.    Henri shot the lynx, and when Kazan understood this, he tore at the end  of his trap-chains and snarled at the writhing body of his forest enemy.  By means of a pole and a babiche noose, Kazan was brought out from under  the windfall and taken to Henri's cabin. The two men then returned with  a thick sack and more babiche, and blind Gray Wolf, still fettered by  the traps, was made prisoner. All the rest of that day Weyman and Henri  worked to build a stout cage of saplings, and when it was finished, the  two prisoners were placed in it.    Before the dog was put in with Gray Wolf, Weyman closely examined the  worn and tooth-marked collar about his neck.    On the brass plate he found engraved the one word, \"Kazan,\" and with a  strange thrill made note of it in his diary.    After this Weyman often remained at the cabin when Henri went out on the  trap-line. After the second day he dared to put his hand between the  sapling bars and touch Kazan, and the next day Kazan accepted a piece of  raw moose meat from his hand. But at his approach, Gray Wolf would  always hide under the pile of balsam in the corner of their prison. The  instinct of generations and perhaps of centuries had taught her that man  was her deadliest enemy. And yet, this man did not hurt her, and Kazan  was not afraid of him. She was frightened at first; then puzzled, and a  growing curiosity followed that. Occasionally, after the third day, she  would thrust her blind face out of the balsam and sniff the air when  Weyman was at the cage, making friends with Kazan. But she would not  eat. Weyman noted that, and each day he tempted her with the choicest  morsels of deer and moose fat. Five days--six--seven passed, and she had  not taken a mouthful. Weyman could count her ribs.    \"She die,\" Henri told him on the seventh night. \"She starve before she  eat in that cage. She want the forest, the wild kill, the fresh blood.  She two--t'ree year old--too old to make civilize.\"    Henri went to bed at the usual hour, but Weyman was troubled, and sat  up late. He wrote a long letter to the sweet-faced girl at North  Battleford, and then he turned out the light, and painted visions of her  in the red glow of the fire. He saw her again for that first time when  he camped in the little shack where the fifth city of Saskatchewan now  stood--with her blue eyes, the big shining braid, and the fresh glow of  the prairies in her cheeks. She had hated him--yes, actually hated him,  because he loved to kill. He laughed softly as he thought of that. She  had changed him--wonderfully.    He rose, opened the door, softly, and went out. Instinctively his eyes  turned westward. The sky was a blaze of stars. In their light he could  see the cage, and he stood, watching and listening. A sound came to him.  It was Gray Wolf gnawing at the sapling bars of her prison. A moment  later there came a low sobbing whine, and he knew that it was Kazan  crying for his freedom.    Leaning against the side of the cabin was an ax. Weyman seized it, and  his lips smiled silently. He was thrilled by a strange happiness, and a  thousand miles away in that city on the Saskatchewan he could feel  another spirit rejoicing with him. He moved toward the cage. A dozen  blows, and two of the sapling bars were knocked out. Then Weyman drew  back. Gray Wolf found the opening first, and she slipped out into the  starlight like a shadow. But she did not flee. Out in the open space she  waited for Kazan, and for a moment the two stood there, looking at the  cabin. Then they set off into freedom, Gray Wolf's shoulder at Kazan's  flank.    Weyman breathed deeply.    \"Two by two--always two by two, until death finds one of them,\" he  whispered.          CHAPTER XII    THE RED DEATH      Kazan and Gray Wolf wandered northward into the Fond du Lac country, and  were there when Jacques, a Hudson Bay Company's runner, came up to the  post from the south with the first authentic news of the dread  plague--the smallpox. For weeks there had been rumors on all sides. And  rumor grew into rumor. From the east, the south and the west they  multiplied, until on all sides the Paul Reveres of the wilderness were  carrying word that _La Mort Rouge_--the Red Death--was at their heels,  and the chill of a great fear swept like a shivering wind from the edge  of civilization to the bay. Nineteen years before these same rumors had  come up from the south, and the Red Terror had followed. The horror of  it still remained with the forest people, for a thousand unmarked  graves, shunned like a pestilence, and scattered from the lower waters  of James Bay to the lake country of the Athabasca, gave evidence of the  toll it demanded.    Now and then in their wanderings Kazan and Gray Wolf had come upon the  little mounds that covered the dead. Instinct--something that was  infinitely beyond the comprehension of man--made them _feel_ the  presence of death about them, perhaps smell it in the air. Gray Wolf's  wild blood and her blindness gave her an immense advantage over Kazan  when it came to detecting those mysteries of the air and the earth which  the eyes were not made to see. Each day that had followed that terrible  moonlit night on the Sun Rock, when the lynx had blinded her, had added  to the infallibility of her two chief senses--hearing and scent. And it  was she who discovered the presence of the plague first, just as she had  scented the great forest fire hours before Kazan had found it in the  air.    Kazan had lured her back to a trap-line. The trail they found was old.  It had not been traveled for many days. In a trap they found a rabbit,  but it had been dead a long time. In another there was the carcass of a  fox, torn into bits by the owls. Most of the traps were sprung. Others  were covered with snow. Kazan, with his three-quarters strain of dog,  ran over the trail from trap to trap, intent only on something  alive--meat to devour. Gray Wolf, in her blindness, scented _death_. It  shivered in the tree-tops above her. She found it in every trap-house  they came to--death--_man death_. It grew stronger and stronger, and  she whined, and nipped Kazan's flank. And Kazan went on. Gray Wolf  followed him to the edge of the clearing in which Loti's cabin stood,  and then she sat back on her haunches, raised her blind face to the gray  sky, and gave a long and wailing cry. In that moment the bristles began  to stand up along Kazan's spine. Once, long ago, he had howled before  the tepee of a master who was newly dead, and he settled back on his  haunches, and gave the death-cry with Gray Wolf. He,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10114"],[0,"The Great Events (#17)"],[1,"truth, I do not believe that they would even be able to effect a  disembarkation. Let us, therefore, set at naught these reports as  altogether of home manufacture; and be sure that if any enemy does come,  the state will know how to defend itself in a manner worthy of the  national honor.\"    Such assertions pleased the Syracusan assembly; but the invaders of  Syracuse came, made good their landing in Sicily; and if they had  promptly attacked the city itself, instead of wasting nearly a year in  desultory operations in other parts of Sicily, the Syracusans must have  paid the penalty of their self-sufficient carelessness in submission to  the Athenian yoke. But, of the three generals who led the Athenian  expedition, two only were men of ability, and one was most weak and  incompetent. Fortunately for Syracuse, Alcibiades, the most skilful of  the three, was soon deposed from his command by a factious and fanatic  vote of his fellow-countrymen, and the other competent one, Lamachus,  fell early in a skirmish; while, more fortunately still for her, the  feeble and vacillating Nicias remained unrecalled and unhurt, to assume  the undivided leadership of the Athenian army and fleet, and to mar, by  alternate over-caution and over-carelessness, every chance of success  which the early part of the operations offered. Still, even under him,  the Athenians nearly won the town. They defeated the raw levies of the  Syracusans, cooped them within the walls, and, as before mentioned,  almost effected a continuous fortification from bay to bay over  Epipolae, the completion of which would certainly have been followed by  a capitulation.    Alcibiades--the most complete example of genius without principle that  history produces; the Bolingbroke of antiquity, but with high military  talents superadded to diplomatic and oratorical powers--on being  summoned home from his command in Sicily to take his trial before the  Athenian tribunal, had escaped to Sparta, and had exerted himself there  with all the selfish rancor of a renegade to renew the war with Athens  and to send instant assistance to Syracuse.    When we read his words in the pages of Thucydides--who was himself an  exile from Athens at this period, and may probably have been at Sparta,  and heard Alcibiades speak--we are at a loss whether most to admire or  abhor his subtle counsels. After an artful exordium, in which he tried  to disarm the suspicions which he felt must be entertained of him, and  to point out to the Spartans how completely his interests and theirs  were identified, through hatred of the Athenian democracy, he thus  proceeded:    \"Hear me, at any rate, on the matters which require your grave  attention, and which I, from the personal knowledge that I have of them,  can and ought to bring before you. We Athenians sailed to Sicily with  the design of subduing, first the Greek cities there, and next those in  Italy. Then we intended to make an attempt on the dominions of Carthage,  and on Carthage itself.[24] If all these projects succeeded--nor did we  limit ourselves to them in these quarters--we intended to increase our  fleet with the inexhaustible supplies of ship timber which Italy  affords, to put in requisition the whole military force of the conquered  Greek states, and also to hire large armies of the barbarians, of the  Iberians,[25] and others in those regions, who are allowed to make the  best possible soldiers. _Then_, when we had done all this, we intended  to assail Peloponnesus with our collected force. Our fleets would  blockade you by sea and desolate your coasts, our armies would be landed  at different points and assail your cities. Some of these we expected to  storm,[26] and others we meant to take by surrounding them with  fortified lines. We thought that it would thus be an easy matter  thoroughly to war you down; and then we should become the masters of the  whole Greek race. As for expense, we reckoned that each conquered state  would give us supplies of money and provisions sufficient to pay for its  own conquest, and furnish the means for the conquest of its neighbors.\"    [Footnote 24: Arnold, in his notes on this passage, well reminds the  reader that Agathocles, with a Greek force far inferior to that of the  Athenians at this period, did, some years afterward, very nearly conquer  Carthage.]    [Footnote 25: It will be remembered that Spanish infantry were the  staple of the Carthaginian armies. Doubtless Alcibiades and other  leading Athenians had made themselves acquainted with the Carthaginian  system of carrying on war, and meant to adopt it. With the marvellous  powers which Alcibiades possessed of ingratiating himself with men of  every class and every nation, and his high military genius, he would  have been as formidable a chief of an army of _condottieri_ as Hannibal  afterward was.]    [Footnote 26: Alcibiades here alluded to Sparta itself, which was  unfortified. His Spartan hearers must have glanced round them at these  words with mixed alarm and indignation.]    \"Such are the designs of the present Athenian expedition to Sicily, and  you have heard them from the lips of the man who, of all men living, is  most accurately acquainted with them. The other Athenian generals, who  remain with the expedition, will endeavor to carry out these plans. And  be sure that without your speedy interference they will all be  accomplished. The Sicilian Greeks are deficient in military training;  but still, if they could at once be brought to combine in an organized  resistance to Athens, they might even now be saved. But as for the  Syracusans resisting Athens by themselves, they have already, with the  whole strength of their population, fought a battle and been beaten;  they cannot face the Athenians at sea; and it is quite impossible for  them to hold out against the force of their invaders. And if this city  falls into the hands of the Athenians, all Sicily is theirs, and  presently Italy also; and the danger, which I warned you of from that  quarter, will soon fall upon yourselves. You must, therefore, in Sicily,  fight for the safety of Peloponnesus. Send some galleys thither  instantly. Put men on board who can work their own way over, and who, as  soon as they land, can do duty as regular troops. But, above all, let  one of yourselves, let a man of Sparta, go over to take the chief  command, to bring into order and effective discipline the forces that  are in Syracuse, and urge those who at present hang back to come forward  and aid the Syracusans. The presence of a Spartan general at this crisis  will do more to save the city than a whole army.\"    The renegade then proceeded to urge on them the necessity of encouraging  their friends in Sicily, by showing that they themselves were in earnest  in hostility to Athens. He exhorted them not only to march their armies  into Attica again, but to take up a permanent fortified position in the  country; and he gave them in detail information of all that the  Athenians most dreaded, and how his country might receive the most  distressing and enduring injury at their hands.    The Spartans resolved to act on his advice, and appointed Gylippus to  the Sicilian command. Gylippus was a man who, to the national bravery  and military skill of a Spartan united political sagacity that was  worthy of his great fellow-countryman Brasidas; but his merits were  debased by mean and sordid vices; and his is one of the cases in which  history has been austerely just, and where little or no fame has been  accorded to the successful but venal soldier. But for the purpose for  which he was required in Sicily, an abler man could not have been found  in Lacedaemon. His country gave him neither men nor money, but she gave  him her authority; and the influence of her name and of his own talents  was speedily seen in the zeal with which the Corinthians and other  Peloponnesian Greeks began to equip a squadron to act under him for the  rescue of Sicily. As soon as four galleys were ready, he hurried over  with them to the southern coast of Italy, and there, though he received  such evil tidings of the state of Syracuse that he abandoned all hope of  saving that city, he determined to remain on the coast, and do what he  could in preserving the Italian cities from the Athenians.    So nearly, indeed, had Nicias completed his beleaguering lines, and so  utterly desperate had the state of Syracuse seemingly become, that an  assembly of the Syracusans was actually convened, and they were  discussing the terms on which they should offer to capitulate, when a  galley was seen dashing into the great harbor, and making her way toward  the town with all the speed which her rowers could supply. From her  shunning the part of the harbor where the Athenian fleet lay, and making  straight for the Syracusan side, it was clear that she was a friend; the  enemy's cruisers, careless through confidence of success, made no  attempt to cut her off; she touched the beach, and a Corinthian captain,  springing on shore from her, was eagerly conducted to the assembly of  the Syracusan people just in time to prevent the fatal vote being put  for a surrender.    Providentially for Syracuse, Gongylus, the commander of the galley, had  been prevented by an Athenian squadron from following Gylippus to South  Italy, and he had been obliged to push direct for Syracuse from Greece.    The sight of actual succor, and the promise of more, revived the  drooping spirits of the Syracusans. They felt that they were not left  desolate to perish, and the tidings that a Spartan was coming to command  them confirmed their resolution to continue their resistance. Gylippus  was already near the city. He had learned at Locri that the first report  which had reached him of the state of Syracuse was exaggerated, and that  there was unfinished space in the besiegers' lines through which it was  barely possible to introduce"]]]
