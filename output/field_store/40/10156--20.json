[Illustration: Dish-Towel Rack.]    KITCHEN BRUSHES.--These useful little articles can be put to such a  variety of uses that they are among the chiefest of household  conveniences. They are also so inexpensive, costing but five cents  apiece without handles and seven cents with handles, that no housewife  can afford to be without a supply of them. For the washing of dishes  with handles, the outside of iron kettles, and other cooking utensils  made of iron, they are especially serviceable. The smaller sizes are  likewise excellent for cleaning cut glass ware, Majolica ware,--in fact,  any kind of ware with raised figures or corrugated surfaces. For  cleaning a grater, nothing is superior to one of these little brushes.  Such a brush is also most serviceable for washing celery, as the  corrugated surface of the stalk makes a thorough cleaning with the hands  a difficult operation. Then if one uses a brush with handle, ice water,  which adds to the crispness of the celery, may be used for the cleaning,  as there will be no necessity for putting the hands in the water. A  small whisk broom is also valuable for the same purpose. Such vegetables  as potatoes, turnips, etc., are best cleaned with a brush. It makes the  work less disagreeable, as the hands need not be soiled by the process,  and in no other way can the cleaning be so well and thoroughly done.    [Illustration: Vegetable Brush.]    All brushes after being used should be carefully scalded and placed  brush downward in a wire sponge basket, or hung up on hooks. If left  around carelessly, they soon acquire the musty smell of a neglected  dishcloth.          TABLE TOPICS.        The kitchen is a chemical laboratory, in which are conducted a      number of chemical processes by which our food is converted from its      crudest state to condition more suitable for digestion and      nutrition, and made more agreeable to the palate.--_Prof. Matthew      Williams._        Half the trouble between mistresses and maids arises from the      disagreeable surroundings to which servants are confined. There is      no place more dismal than the ordinary kitchen in city dwellings. It      is half underground, ill-lighted, and unwholesome. What wonder,      then, in the absence of sunlight, there is a lack of sunny temper      and cheerful service? An ill-lighted kitchen is almost sure to be a      dirty one, where germs will thrive and multiply. Let sanitary      kitchens be provided, and we shall have more patient mistresses and      more willing servants.--_Sel._        A sluggish housemaid exclaimed, when scolded for the uncleanliness      of her kitchen, \"I'm sure the room would be clean enough if it were      not for the nasty sun, which is always showing the dirty      corners.\"--_Sel._        If we would look for ready hands and willing hearts in our kitchens,      we should make them pleasant and inviting for those who literally      bear the \"burden and heat of the day\" in this department of our      homes, where, emphatically, \"woman's work is never done.\" We should      no longer be satisfied to locate our kitchens in the most      undesirable corner of the house. We should demand ample      light,--sunshine if possible,--and justly too; for the very light      itself is inspiring to the worker. It will stir up cheer and breed      content in the minds of those whose lot is cast in this work-a-day      room.--_Sel._        Any invention on the part of the housekeeper intended to be a      substitute for watchfulness, will prove a delusion and a      snare.--_Sel._        \"The first wealth is health,\" says Emerson.        A knowledge of sanitary principles should be regarded as an      essential part of every woman's education, and obedience to sanitary      laws should be ranked, as it was in the Mosaic code, as a religious      duty.--_Sel._        Much of the air of the house comes from the cellar. A heated house      acts like a chimney. A German experimenter states that one half of      the cellar air makes its way into the first story, one third into      the second, and one fifth into the third.          CEREALS AND THEIR PREPARATION FOR THE TABLE    Cereal is the name given to those seeds used as food (wheat, rye, oats,  barley, corn, rice, etc.), which are produced by plants belonging to the  vast order known as the grass family. They are used for food both in the  unground state and in various forms of mill products.    The grains are pre-eminently nutritious, and when well prepared, easily  digested foods. In composition they are all similar, but variations in  their constituent elements and the relative amounts of these various  elements, give them different degrees of alimentary value. They each  contain one or more of the nitrogenous elements,--gluten, albumen,  caseine, and fibrin,--together with starch, dextrine, sugar, and fatty  matter, and also mineral elements and woody matter, or cellulose. The  combined nutritive value of the grain foods is nearly three times that  of beef, mutton, or poultry. As regards the proportion of the food  elements necessary to meet the various requirements of the system,  grains approach more nearly the proper standard than most other foods;  indeed, wheat contains exactly the correct proportion of the food  elements.    Being thus in themselves so nearly perfect foods, and when properly  prepared, exceedingly palatable and easy of digestion, it is a matter of  surprise that they are not more generally used; yet scarcely one family  in fifty makes any use of the grains, save in the form of flour, or an  occasional dish of rice or oatmeal. This use of grains is far too meager  to adequately represent their value as an article of diet. Variety in  the use of grains is as necessary as in the use of other food material,  and the numerous grain preparations now to be found in market render it  quite possible to make this class of foods a staple article of diet, if  so desired, without their becoming at all monotonous.    In olden times the grains were largely depended upon as a staple food,  and it is a fact well authenticated by history that the highest  condition of man has always been associated with wheat-consuming  nations. The ancient Spartans, whose powers of endurance are proverbial,  were fed on a grain diet, and the Roman soldiers who under Caesar  conquered the world, carried each a bag of parched grain in his pocket  as his daily ration.    Other nationalities at the present time make extensive use of the  various grains. Rice used in connection with some of the leguminous  seeds, forms the staple article of diet for a large proportion of the  human race. Rice, unlike the other grain foods, is deficient in the  nitrogenous elements, and for this reason its use needs to be  supplemented by other articles containing an excess of the nitrogenous  material. It is for this reason, doubtless, that the Hindoos use  lentils, and the Chinese eat peas and beans in connection with rice.    We frequently meet people who say they cannot use the grains,--that they  do not agree with them. With all deference to the opinion of such  people, it may be stated that the difficulty often lies in the fact that  the grain was either not properly cooked, not properly eaten, or not  properly accompanied. A grain, simply because it is a grain, is by no  means warranted to faithfully fulfil its mission unless properly  treated. Like many another good thing excellent in itself, if found in  bad company, it is prone to create mischief, and in many cases the root  of the whole difficulty may be found in the excessive amount of sugar  used with the grain.    Sugar is not needed with grains to increase their alimentary value. The  starch which constitutes a large proportion of their food elements must  itself be converted into sugar by the digestive processes before  assimilation, hence the addition of cane sugar only increases the burden  of the digestive organs, for the pleasure of the palate. The Asiatics,  who subsist largely upon rice, use no sugar upon it, and why should it  be considered requisite for the enjoyment of wheat, rye, oatmeal,  barley, and other grains, any more than it is for our enjoyment of bread  or other articles made from these same grains? Undoubtedly the use of  grains would become more universal if they were served with less or no  sugar. The continued use of sugar upon grains has a tendency to cloy the  appetite, just as the constant use of cake or sweetened bread in the  place of ordinary bread would do. Plenty of nice, sweet cream or fruit  juice, is a sufficient dressing, and there are few persons who after a  short trial would not come to enjoy the grains without sugar, and would  then as soon think of dispensing with a meal altogether as to dispense  with the grains.    Even when served without sugar, the grains may not prove altogether  healthful unless they are properly eaten. Because they are made soft by  the process of cooking and on this account do not require masticating to  break them up, the first process of digestion or insalivation is usually  overlooked. But it must be remembered that grains are largely composed  of starch, and that starch must be mixed with the saliva, or it will  remain undigested in the stomach, since the gastric juice only digests  the nitrogenous elements. For this reason it is desirable to eat the  grains in connection with some hard food. Whole-wheat wafers, nicely  toasted to make them crisp and tender, toasted rolls, and unfermented  zwieback, are excellent for this purpose. Break two or three wafers into  rather small pieces over each individual dish before pouring on the  cream. In this way, a morsel of the hard food may be taken with each  spoonful of the grains. The combination of foods thus secured, is most  pleasing."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12242"],[0,"Poems (#17)"],[1,"rose!            XII.    High from the earth I heard a bird;    He trod upon the trees  As he esteemed them trifles,    And then he spied a breeze,  And situated softly    Upon a pile of wind  Which in a perturbation    Nature had left behind.  A joyous-going fellow    I gathered from his talk,  Which both of benediction    And badinage partook,  Without apparent burden,    I learned, in leafy wood  He was the faithful father    Of a dependent brood;  And this untoward transport    His remedy for care, --  A contrast to our respites.    How different we are!            XIII.    COBWEBS.    The spider as an artist    Has never been employed  Though his surpassing merit    Is freely certified    By every broom and Bridget    Throughout a Christian land.  Neglected son of genius,    I take thee by the hand.            XIV.    A WELL.    What mystery pervades a well!    The water lives so far,  Like neighbor from another world    Residing in a jar.    The grass does not appear afraid;    I often wonder he  Can stand so close and look so bold    At what is dread to me.    Related somehow they may be, --    The sedge stands next the sea,  Where he is floorless, yet of fear    No evidence gives he.    But nature is a stranger yet;    The ones that cite her most  Have never passed her haunted house,    Nor simplified her ghost.    To pity those that know her not    Is helped by the regret  That those who know her, know her less    The nearer her they get.            XV.    To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, --  One clover, and a bee,  And revery.  The revery alone will do  If bees are few.            XVI.    THE WIND.    It's like the light, --    A fashionless delight  It's like the bee, --    A dateless melody.    It's like the woods,    Private like breeze,  Phraseless, yet it stirs    The proudest trees.    It's like the morning, --    Best when it's done, --  The everlasting clocks    Chime noon.            XVII.    A dew sufficed itself    And satisfied a leaf,  And felt, 'how vast a destiny!    How trivial is life!'    The sun went out to work,    The day went out to play,  But not again that dew was seen    By physiognomy.    Whether by day abducted,    Or emptied by the sun  Into the sea, in passing,    Eternally unknown.            XVIII.    THE WOODPECKER.    His bill an auger is,    His head, a cap and frill.  He laboreth at every tree, --    A worm his utmost goal.            XIX.    A SNAKE.    Sweet is the swamp with its secrets,    Until we meet a snake;  'T is then we sigh for houses,    And our departure take  At that enthralling gallop    That only childhood knows.  A snake is summer's treason,    And guile is where it goes.            XX.    Could I but ride indefinite,    As doth the meadow-bee,  And visit only where I liked,    And no man visit me,    And flirt all day with buttercups,    And marry whom I may,  And dwell a little everywhere,    Or better, run away    With no police to follow,    Or chase me if I do,  Till I should jump peninsulas    To get away from you, --    I said, but just to be a bee    Upon a raft of air,  And row in nowhere all day long,    And anchor off the bar,--  What liberty! So captives deem    Who tight in dungeons are.            XXI.    THE MOON.    The moon was but a chin of gold    A night or two ago,  And now she turns her perfect face    Upon the world below.    Her forehead is of amplest blond;    Her cheek like beryl stone;  Her eye unto the summer dew    The likest I have known.    Her lips of amber never part;    But what must be the smile  Upon her friend she could bestow    Were such her silver will!    And what a privilege to be    But the remotest star!  For certainly her way might pass    Beside your twinkling door.    Her bonnet is the firmament,    The universe her shoe,  The stars the trinkets at her belt,    Her dimities of blue.            XXII.    THE BAT.    The bat is dun with wrinkled wings    Like fallow article,  And not a song pervades his lips,    Or none perceptible.    His small umbrella, quaintly halved,    Describing in the air  An arc alike inscrutable, --    Elate philosopher!    Deputed from what firmament    Of what astute abode,  Empowered with what malevolence    Auspiciously withheld.    To his adroit Creator    Ascribe no less the praise;  Beneficent, believe me,    His eccentricities.            XXIII.    THE BALLOON.    You've seen balloons set, haven't you?    So stately they ascend  It is as swans discarded you    For duties diamond.    Their liquid feet go softly out    Upon a sea of blond;  They spurn the air as 't were too mean    For creatures so renowned.    Their ribbons just beyond the eye,    They struggle some for breath,  And yet the crowd applauds below;    They would not encore death.    The gilded creature strains and spins,    Trips frantic in a tree,  Tears open her imperial veins    And tumbles in the sea.    The crowd retire with an oath    The dust in streets goes down,  And clerks in counting-rooms observe,    ''T was only a balloon.'            XXIV.    EVENING.    The cricket sang,  And set the sun,  And workmen finished, one by one,    Their seam the day upon.    The low grass loaded with the dew,  The twilight stood as strangers do  With hat in hand, polite and new,    To stay as if, or go.    A vastness, as a neighbor, came, --  A wisdom without face or name,  A peace, as hemispheres at home, --    And so the night became.            XXV.    COCOON.    Drab habitation of whom?  Tabernacle or tomb,  Or dome of worm,  Or porch of gnome,  Or some elf's catacomb?          XXVI.    SUNSET.    A sloop of amber slips away    Upon an ether sea,  And wrecks in peace a purple tar,    The son of ecstasy.            XXVII.    AURORA.    Of bronze and blaze    The north, to-night!    So adequate its forms,  So preconcerted with itself,    So distant to alarms, --  An unconcern so sovereign    To universe, or me,  It paints my simple spirit    With tints of majesty,  Till I take vaster attitudes,    And strut upon my stem,  Disdaining men and oxygen,    For arrogance of them.    My splendors are menagerie;    But their competeless show  Will entertain the centuries    When I am, long ago,  An island in dishonored grass,    Whom none but daisies know.            XXVIII.    THE COMING OF NIGHT.    How the old mountains drip with sunset,    And the brake of dun!  How the hemlocks are tipped in tinsel    By the wizard sun!    How the old steeples hand the scarlet,    Till the ball is full, --  Have I the lip of the flamingo    That I dare to tell?    Then, how the fire ebbs like billows,    Touching all the grass  With a departing, sapphire feature,    As if a duchess pass!    How a small dusk crawls on the village    Till the houses blot;  And the odd flambeaux no men carry    Glimmer on the spot!    Now it is night in nest and kennel,    And where was the wood,  Just a dome of abyss is nodding    Into solitude! --    These are the visions baffled Guido;    Titian never told;  Domenichino dropped the pencil,    Powerless to unfold.            XXIX.    AFTERMATH.    The murmuring of bees has ceased;    But murmuring of some  Posterior, prophetic,    Has simultaneous come, --    The lower metres of the year,    When nature's laugh is done, --  The Revelations of the book    Whose Genesis is June.              IV. TIME AND ETERNITY.    I.    This world is not conclusion;    A sequel stands beyond,  Invisible, as music,    But positive, as sound.  It beckons and it baffles;    Philosophies don't know,  And through a riddle, at the last,    Sagacity must go.  To guess it puzzles scholars;    To gain it, men have shown  Contempt of generations,    And crucifixion known.            II.    We learn in the retreating    How vast an one  Was recently among us.    A perished sun    Endears in the departure    How doubly more  Than all the golden presence    It was before!            III.    They say that 'time assuages,' --    Time never did assuage;  An actual suffering strengthens,    As sinews do, with age.    Time is a test of trouble,    But not a remedy.  If such it prove, it prove too    There was no malady.            IV.    We cover thee, sweet face.    Not that we tire of thee,  But that thyself fatigue of us;    Remember, as thou flee,  We follow thee until    Thou notice us no more,  And then, reluctant, turn away    To con thee o'er and o'er,  And blame the scanty love    We were content to show,  Augmented, sweet, a hundred fold    If thou would'st take it now.            V.    ENDING.    That is solemn we have ended, --    Be it but a play,  Or a glee among the garrets,    Or a holiday,    Or a leaving home; or later,    Parting with a world  We have understood, for better    Still it be unfurled.            VI.    The stimulus, beyond the grave    His countenance to see,  Supports me like imperial drams    Afforded royally.            VII.    Given in marriage unto thee,    Oh, thou celestial host!  Bride of the Father and the Son,    Bride of the Holy Ghost!    Other betrothal shall dissolve,    Wedlock of will decay;  Only the keeper of this seal    Conquers mortality.              VIII.    That such have died enables us    The tranquiller to die;  That such have lived, certificate    For immortality.            IX.    They won't frown always, -- some sweet day    When I forget to tease,  They'll recollect how cold I looked,    And how I just said 'please.'    Then they will hasten to the door    To call the little child,  Who cannot thank them, for the ice    That on her lisping piled.            X.    IMMORTALITY.    It is an honorable thought,    And makes one lift one's hat,  As one encountered gentlefolk    Upon a daily street,    That we've immortal place,    Though pyramids decay,  And kingdoms, like the orchard,    Flit russetly away.            XI.    The distance that the dead have gone    Does not at first appear;  Their coming back seems possible    For many an ardent year.    And"]]]
