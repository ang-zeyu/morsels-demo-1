Hymn 2:30.  Heavenly joy on earth.    1 [Come, we that love the Lord,  And let our joys be known;  Join in a song with sweet accord,  And thus surround the throne.    2 The sorrows of the mind  Be banish'd from the place!  Religion never was design'd  To make our pleasures less.]    3 Let those refuse to sing  That never knew our God,  But favourites of the heavenly King  May speak their joys abroad.    4 [The God that rules on high,  And thunders when he please,  That rides upon the stormy sky  And manages the seas.]    5 This awful God is ours,  Our Father and our love,  He shall send down his heavenly powers  To carry us above.    6 There we shall see his face,  And never, never sin;  There from the rivers of his grace  Drink endless pleasures in.    7 Yes, and before we rise  To that immortal state,  The thoughts of such amazing bliss  Should constant joys create.    8 [The men of grace have found  Glory begun below,  Celestial fruits on earthly ground  From faith and hope may grow.]    9 The hill of Sion yields  A thousand sacred sweets,  Before we reach the heavenly fields,  Or walk the golden streets.    10 Then let our songs abound,  And every tear be dry;  We're marching thro' Immanuel's ground  To fairer worlds on high.      Hymn 2:31.  Christ's presence makes death easy.    1 Why should we start and fear to die?  What timorous worms we mortals are!  Death is the gate of endless joy,  And yet we dread to enter there.    2 The pains, the groans, and dying strife,  Fright our approaching souls away;  Still we shrink back again to life,  Fond of our prison and our clay.    3 O, if my Lord would come and meet,  My soul should stretch her wings in haste,  Fly fearless thro' death's iron gate,  Nor feel the terrors as she pass'd.    4 Jesus can make a dying bed  Feel soft as downy pillows are,  While on his breast I lean my head,  And breathe my life out sweetly there.      Hymn 2:32.  Frailty and Folly.    1 How short and hasty is our life!  How vast our souls' affairs!  Yet senseless mortals vainly strive  To lavish out their years.    2 Our days run thoughtlessly along,  Without a moment's stay;  Just like a story or a song  We pass our lives away.    3 God from on high invites us home,  But we march heedless on,  And ever hastening to the tomb,  Stoop downwards as we run.    4 How we deserve the deepest hell  That slight the joys above!  What chains of vengeance should we feel  That break such cords of love!    5 Draw us, O God, with sovereign grace,  And lift our thoughts on high,  That we may end this mortal race  And see salvation nigh.      Hymn 2:33.  The blessed society in heaven.    1 Raise thee, my soul, fly up, and run  Thro' every heavenly street,  And say, there's nought below the sun  That's worthy of thy feet.    2 [Thus will we mount on sacred wings,  And tread the courts above;  Nor earth, nor all her mightiest things  Shall tempt our meanest love.]    3 There on a high majestic throne  Th' Almighty Father reigns,  And sheds his glorious goodness down  On all the blissful plains.    4 Bright like a sun the Saviour sits,  And spreads eternal noon,  No evenings there, nor gloomy nights,  To want the feeble moon.    5 Amidst those ever-shining skies  Behold the sacred Dove,  While banish'd sin and sorrow flies  From all the realms of love.    6 The glorious tenants of the place  Stand bending round the throne;  And saints and seraphs sing and praise  The infinite Three One.    7 [But O what beams of heavenly grace  Transport them all the while!  Ten thousand smiles from Jesus' face,  And love in every smile!]    8 [Jesus, and when shall that dear day,  That joyful hour appear,  When I shall leave this house of clay  To dwell amongst them there?]      Hymn 2:34.  Breathing after the Holy Spirit;  or, Fervency of devotion desired.    1 Come, holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,  With all thy quickening powers,  Kindle a flame of sacred love,  In these cold hearts of ours.    2 Look, how we grovel here below,  Fond of these trifling toys;  Our souls can neither fly nor go  To reach eternal joys.    3 In vain we tune our formal songs,  In vain we strive to rise;  Hosannas languish on our tongues,  And our devotion dies.    4 Dear Lord! and shall we ever lie  At this poor dying rate?  Our love so faint, so cold to thee,  And thine to us so great?    5 Come holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,  With all thy quickening powers;  Come shed abroad a Saviour's love,  And that shall kindle ours.      Hymn 2:35.  Praise to God for creation and redemption.    1 Let them neglect thy glory, Lord,  Who never knew thy grace,  But our loud songs shall still record  The wonders of thy praise.    2 We raise our shouts, O God, to thee,  And send them to thy throne,  All glory to th' united Three,  The undivided One.    3 'Twas he (and we'll adore his Name)  That form'd us by a word,  'Tis he restores our ruin'd frame;  Salvation to the Lord.    4 Hosanna! let the earth and skies  Repeat the joyful sound,  Rocks, hills, and vales, reflect the voice  In one eternal round.      Hymn 2:36.  Christ's intercession.    1 Well, the Redeemer's gone  T' appear before our God,  To sprinkle o'er the flaming throne  With his atoning blood.    2 No fiery vengeance now,  Nor burning wrath comes down;  If justice call for sinners' blood,  The Saviour shews his own.    3 Before his Father's eye  Our humble suit he moves,  The Father lays his thunder by,  And looks, and smiles, and loves.    4 Now may our joyful tongues  Our Maker's honour sing,  Jesus the priest receives our songs,  And bears them to the King.    5 [We bow before his face,  And sound his glories high,  \"Hosanna to the God of grace  \"That lays his thunder by.]    6 \"On earth thy mercy reigns,  \"And triumphs all above;\"  But, Lord how weak are mortal strains  To speak immortal love!    7 [How jarring and how low  Are all the notes we sing!  Sweet Saviour, tune our songs anew,  And they shall please the King.]      Hymn 2:37.  The same.    1 Lift up your eyes to th' heavenly seats  Where your Redeemer stays;  Kind intercessor, there he sits,  And loves, and pleads, and prays.    2 'Twas well, my soul he dy'd for thee,  And shed his vital blood,  Appeas'd stern justice on the tree,  And then arose to God.    3 Petitions now and praise may rise,  And saints their offerings bring,  The priest with his own sacrifice  Presents them to the King.    4 [Let Papists trust what names they please,  Their saints and angels boast;  We've no such advocates as these,  Nor pray to th' heavenly host.]    6 Jesus alone shall bear my cries  Up to his Father's throne,  He, dearest Lord! perfumes my sighs,  And sweetens every groan.    6 [Ten thousand praises to the King,  Hosanna in the highest;  Ten thousand thanks our spirits bring  To God and to his Christ.]      Hymn 2:38.  Love to God.    1 Happy the heart where graces reign,  Where love inspires the breast;  Love is the brightest of the train,  And strengthens all the rest.    9 Knowledge, alas! 'Tis all in vain,  And all in vain our fear,  Our stubborn sins will fight and reign  If love be absent there.      3 'Tis love that makes our cheerful feet  In swift obedience move,  The devils know and tremble too,  But Satan cannot love.    4 This is the grace that lives and sings  When faith and hope shall cease,  'Tis this shall strike our joyful strings  In the sweet realms of bliss.    5 Before we quite forsake our clay,  Or leave this dark abode,  The wings of love bear us away  To see our smiling God.      Hymn 2:39.  The shortness and misery of life.    1 Our days, alas! our mortal days  Are short and wretched too;  \"Evil and few,\" the patriarch says, [1]  And well the patriarch knew.    2 'Tis but at best a narrow bound  That heaven allows to men,  And pains and sins run thro' the round  Of threescore years and ten.    3 Well, if ye must be sad and few,  Run on, my days, in haste;  Moments of sin, and months of woe,  Ye cannot fly too fast.    4 Let heavenly love prepare my soul,  And call her to the skies,  Where years of long salvation roll,  And glory never dies.    [1] Genesis 47:9.      Hymn 2:40.  Our comfort in the covenant made with Christ.    1 Our God, how firm his promise stands,  E'en when he hides his face!  He trusts in our Redeemer's hands  His glory and his grace.    2 Then why, my soul, these sad complaints,  Since Christ and we are one;  Thy God is faithful to his saints,  Is faithful to his Son.    3 Beneath his smiles my heart has liv'd,  And part of heaven possess'd;  I praise his Name for grace receiv'd,  And trust him for the rest.      Hymn 2:41.  A sight of God mortifies us to the world.    1 [Up to the fields where angels lie,  And living waters gently roll,  Fain would my thoughts leap out and fly,  But sin hangs heavy on my soul.    2 Thy wondrous blood, dear dying Christ,  Can make this load of guilt remove;  And thou canst bear me where thou fly'st,  On thy kind wings, celestial Dove!]    3 O might I once mount up and see  The glories of th' eternal skies,  What little things these worlds would be!  How despicable to my eyes!    4 Had I a glance of thee, my God,  Kingdoms and men would vanish soon,  Vanish, as tho' I saw them not,  As a dim candle dies at noon.    5 Then they might fight, and rage, and rave,  I should perceive the noise no more  Than we can hear a shaking leaf,  While rattling thunders round us roar.    6 Great All in All, eternal King,  Let me but view thy lovely face,  And all my powers shall bow and sing  Thine endless grandeur and thy grace.      Hymn 2:42.  Delight in God.    1 My God, what endless pleasures dwell  Above at thy right-hand!  The courts below, how amiable,  Where all thy graces stand!    2 The swallow near thy temple"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13376"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage, King AEthelbert, 596 to King George III, 1775 (#17)"],[1,"were chambers  for the guards. Arrows could be shot through slits in the  enclosing walls. Inside the enclosed area might be stables, a  granary, barracks for the soldiers, and workshops. The only winter  feed was hay, for which the horses, breeding animals, milkcow,  and workoxen had a priority over other animals. The bulk of the  cattle were usually slaughtered and salted.    The castle building typically was entered by an outer wood  staircase to the guard room on the second floor. The first  [ground] floor had a well and was used as a storehouse and/or  dungeons for prisoners. The second floor had a two-storied great  hall, with small rooms and aisles around it within the thick  walls. There was also a chapel area on the second floor. There  were small areas of the third floor which could be used for  sleeping. The floors were wood and were reached by a spiral stone  staircase in one corner of the building. Sometimes there was a  reservoir of water on an upper level with pipes carrying the water  to floors below. Each floor had a fireplace with a slanted flue  going through the wall to the outside. There were latrines in the  corner walls with a pit or shaft down the exterior of the wall,  sometimes to the moat. Furs and wool clothes were hung on the  walls there in the summer to deter the moths. The first floor had  only arrow slits in the walls, but the higher floors had small  windows.    Some curtain-wall castles did not have a central building. In  these, the hall was built along the inside of the walls, as were  other continuous buildings. The kitchens and chapels were in the  towers. Lodgings were in buildings along the curtain-walls, or on  several floors of the towers.    The great hall was the main room of the castle. The hall was used for  meals and meetings at which the lord received homages, recovered fees,  and held the view of frankpledge [free pledge in Latin], in which  freemen agreed to be sureties for each other. At the main table, the  lord and his lady sat on benches with backs or chairs. The table was  covered first with a wool cloth that reached to the floor, and then by a  smaller white linen cloth. Everyone else sat on benches at trestle  tables, which consisted of planks on trestles and could be dismantled,  e.g. at night. Over the main door were the family arms. On the walls  were swords ready for instant use. On the upper parts of the walls could  be fox skins and perhaps a polecat skin, and keepers' and huntsmen's  poles. There were often hawk perches overhead. At the midday dinner,  courses were ceremonially brought in to music, and ritual bows were made  to the lord. The food at the head table was often tasted first by a  servant as a precaution against poison.  Hounds, spaniels, and terriers  lay near the hearth and cats, often with litters, nestled nearby. They  might share in dinner, but the lord may keep a short stick near him to  defend morsels he meant for himself. Hunting, dove cotes, and carp pools  provided fresh meat.  Fish was compulsory eating on Fridays, on fast  days, and during Lent.  Cooking was done outside on an open fire,  roasting on spits and boiling in pots. Some spits were mechanized with a  cogged wheel and a weight at the end of a string. Other spits were  turned by a long handle, or a small boy shielded from the heat by a wet  blanket, or by dogs on a treadmill. Underneath the spit was a dripping  pan to hold the falling juices and fat. Mutton fat was used for candles.  Bread, pies, and pastry dishes were baked in an oven: a hole in a  fireproof stone wall fitted with an iron door, in which wood was first  burnt to heat the oven walls. It could also be used for drying fruit or  melting tallow. Fruits were also preserved in honey. Salt was stored in  a niche in the wall near the hearth and put on the table in a salt  cellar which became more elaborate over the years.  Salt was very  valuable and gave rise to the praise of a man as the salt of the  earth. Costly imported spices such as cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, ginger,  pepper, and a small quantity of sugar were kept in chests. Pepper was  always on the table to disguise the taste of tainted meat. Spices were  tried for medicinal use. Drinks included wine, ale, cider from apples,  perry from pears, and mead. People carried and used their own knives.  There were no forks. Spoons were of silver or wood. People also ate with  their fingers and washed their hands before and after meals. It was  impolite to dig into the salt bowl with a knife not previously wiped on  bread or napkin, which was linen. It was unmannerly to wipe one's knife  or one's greasy fingers on the tablecloth or, to use the tablecloth to  blow one's nose. Feasts were stately occasions with costly tables and  splendid apparel.  There were practical jokes, innocent frolics, and  witty verbal debating with repartee. They played chess, checkers, and  various games with cards and dice. Most people could sing and some could  play the lute.    Lighting of the hall at night was by oil lamps or candles on  stands or on wall fixtures. For outside activities, a lantern [a  candle shielded by a metal cage with panels of finely shaved horn:  lant horn] was used. The residence of the lord's family and guests  was at a screened off area at the extreme end of the hall or on a  higher floor. Chests stored garments and jewels. Iron keys and  locks were used for chests and doors. The great bed had a wooden  frame and springs made of interlaced rope or strips of leather. It  was covered with a feather mattress, sheets, quilts, fur covers,  and pillows. Drapery around the bed kept out cold drafts and  provided privacy. There was a water bowl for washing in the  morning. A chamber pot was kept under the bed for nighttime use.  Hay was used as toilet paper. The lord's personal servants slept  nearby on benches or trundle beds. Most of the gentlemen servants  slept communally in a \"knight's chamber\". The floor of the hall  was strewn with straw, on which common folk could sleep at night.  There were stools on which to sit. Cup boards (boards on which to  store cups) and chests stored spices and plate. One-piece iron  shears were available to cut cloth. Handheld spindles were used  for weaving; one hand held the spindle [a small stick weighted at  one end] while the other hand alternately formed the thread and  wound it around the spindle. On the roofs there were rampart walks  for sentry patrols and parapets from which to shoot arrows or  throw things at besiegers. Each tenant of the demesne of the king  where he had a castle had to perform a certain amount of castle  guard duty for its continuing defense. These knights performing  castle-guard duty slept at their posts. Bathing was done in a  wooden tub located in the garden in the summer and indoors near  the fire in winter. The great bed and tub for bathing were taken  on trips with the lord. The entire household was of men, except  for the lord's lady with a few lady companions; otherwise the  entire household was of men. The ladies rode pillion [on a cushion  behind the saddle] or in litters suspended between two horses.    Markets grew up outside castle walls. Any trade on a lord's land  was subject to \"passage\", a payment on goods passing through,  \"stallage\", a payment for setting up a stall or booth in a market,  and \"pontage\", a payment for taking goods across a bridge.    The Norman man was clean shaven on his face and around his ears  and at the nape of the neck. His hair was short. He wore a long-  sleeved under-tunic of linen or wool that reached to his ankles.  Over this the Norman noble wore a tunic without sleeves, open at  the sides, and fastened with a belt. Over one shoulder was his  cloak, which was fastened on the opposite shoulder by being drawn  through a ring brooch and knotted. He wore tight thick cloth  stockings to protect him from the mud and leather shoes. Common  men wore durable, but drab, wool tunics to the knee so as not to  impede them in their work. They could roll up their stockings when  working in the fields. A lady also wore a high-necked, long-  sleeved linen or wool tunic fitted at the waist and laced at the  side, but full in the skirt, which reached to her toes. She wore a  jeweled belt, passed twice around her waist and knotted in front.  Her hair was often in two long braids, and her head and ears  covered with a white round cloth held in place by a metal circlet  like a small crown. Its ends were wound around her neck. In  winter, she wore over her tunic a cloak edged or lined with fur  and fastened at the front with a cord. Clothes of both men and  ladies were brightly colored by dyes or embroidery. The Norman  knight wore an over-tunic of leather or heavy linen on which were  sewn flat rings of iron and a conical iron helmet with nose cover.  He wore a sword at his waist and a metal shield on his back, or he  wore his sword and his accompanying retainers carried spear and  shield.    Norman customs were adopted by the nation. As a whole, Anglo-Saxon  men shaved their beards and whiskers from their faces, but they  kept their custom of long hair flowing from their heads. But a few  kept their whiskers and beards in protest of the Normans. Everyone  had a permanent surname indicating parentage, place of birth, or  residence, such as Field, Pitt, Lane, Bridge, Ford, Stone, Burn,  Church, Hill, Brook, Green. Other names came from occupations such  as Shepherd, Carter, Parker, Fowler, Hunter, Forester, Smith.  Still other came from personal characteristics such as Black,  Brown, and White, Short, Round, and Long. Some took their names  from animals such as Wolf, Fox, Lamb, Bull, Hogg, Sparrow, Crow,  and Swan. Others were called after the men they served, such as  King, Bishop, Abbot, Prior, Knight. A man's surname was passed on  to his son.    Those few coerls whose land was not taken by a baron remained free  and held their land \"in socage\" and became known as "]]]
