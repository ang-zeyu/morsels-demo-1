But where--how--they  must have been in the place after all, then? What a fool I have been!\"    Hewitt shook his head. \"I'm afraid you're not quite so lucky as you think,  Mr. Dixon,\" he said. \"These drawings have most certainly been out of the  house for a little while. Never mind how--we'll talk of that after. There  is no time to lose. Tell me--how long would it take a good draughtsman to  copy them?\"    \"They couldn't possibly be traced over properly in less than two or two  and a half long days of very hard work,\" Dixon replied with eagerness.    \"Ah! then it is as I feared. These tracings have been photographed, Mr.  Dixon, and our task is one of every possible difficulty. If they had been  copied in the ordinary way, one might hope to get hold of the copy. But  photography upsets everything. Copies can be multiplied with such amazing  facility that, once the thief gets a decent start, it is almost hopeless  to checkmate him. The only chance is to get at the negatives before copies  are taken. I must act at once; and I fear, between ourselves, it may be  necessary for me to step very distinctly over the line of the law in the  matter. You see, to get at those negatives may involve something very like  house-breaking. There must be no delay, no waiting for legal procedure, or  the mischief is done. Indeed, I very much question whether you have any  legal remedy, strictly speaking.\"    \"Mr. Hewitt, I implore you, do what you can. I need not say that all I  have is at your disposal. I will guarantee to hold you harmless for  anything that may happen. But do, I entreat you, do everything possible.  Think of what the consequences may be!\"    \"Well, yes, so I do,\" Hewitt remarked, with a smile. \"The consequences to  me, if I were charged with house-breaking, might be something that no  amount of guarantee could mitigate. However, I will do what I can, if only  from patriotic motives. Now, I must see your tracer, Ritter. He is the  traitor in the camp.\"    \"Ritter? But how?\"    \"Never mind that now. You are upset and agitated, and had better not know  more than is necessary for a little while, in case you say or do something  unguarded. With Ritter I must take a deep course; what I don't know I must  appear to know, and that will seem more likely to him if I disclaim  acquaintance with what I do know. But first put these tracings safely away  out of sight.\"    Dixon slipped them behind his book-case.    \"Now,\" Hewitt pursued, \"call Mr. Worsfold and give him something to do  that will keep him in the inner office across the way, and tell him to  send Ritter here.\"    Mr. Dixon called his chief draughtsman and requested him to put in order  the drawings in the drawers of the inner room that had been disarranged by  the search, and to send Ritter, as Hewitt had suggested.    Ritter walked into the private room with an air of respectful attention.  He was a puffy-faced, unhealthy-looking young man, with very small eyes  and a loose, mobile mouth.    \"Sit down, Mr. Ritter,\" Hewitt said, in a stern voice. \"Your recent  transactions with your friend Mr. Hunter are well known both to Mr. Dixon  and myself.\"    Ritter, who had at first leaned easily back in his chair, started forward  at this, and paled.    \"You are surprised, I observe; but you should be more careful in your  movements out of doors if you do not wish your acquaintances to be known.  Mr. Hunter, I believe, has the drawings which Mr. Dixon has lost, and, if  so, I am certain that you have given them to him. That, you know, is  theft, for which the law provides a severe penalty.\"    Ritter broke down completely and turned appealingly to Mr. Dixon.    \"Oh, sir,\" he pleaded, \"it isn't so bad, I assure you. I was tempted, I  confess, and hid the drawings; but they are still in the office, and I can  give them to you--really, I can.\"    \"Indeed?\" Hewitt went on. \"Then, in that case, perhaps you'd better get  them at once. Just go and fetch them in; we won't trouble to observe your  hiding-place. I'll only keep this door open, to be sure you don't lose  your way, you know--down the stairs, for instance.\"    The wretched Ritter, with hanging head, slunk into the office opposite.  Presently he reappeared, looking, if possible, ghastlier than before. He  looked irresolutely down the corridor, as if meditating a run for it, but  Hewitt stepped toward him and motioned him back to the private room.    \"You mustn't try any more of that sort of humbug,\" Hewitt said with  increased severity. \"The drawings are gone, and you have stolen them; you  know that well enough. Now attend to me. If you received your deserts, Mr.  Dixon would send for a policeman this moment, and have you hauled off to  the jail that is your proper place. But, unfortunately, your accomplice,  who calls himself Hunter--but who has other names besides that--as I  happen to know--has the drawings, and it is absolutely necessary that  these should be recovered. I am afraid that it will be necessary,  therefore, to come to some arrangement with this scoundrel--to square him,  in fact. Now, just take that pen and paper, and write to your confederate  as I dictate. You know the alternative if you cause any difficulty.\"    Ritter reached tremblingly for the pen.    \"Address him in your usual way,\" Hewitt proceeded. \"Say this: 'There has  been an alteration in the plans.' Have you got that? 'There has been an  alteration in the plans. I shall be alone here at six o'clock. Please  come, without fail.' Have you got it? Very well; sign it, and address the  envelope. He must come here, and then we may arrange matters. In the  meantime, you will remain in the inner office opposite.\"    The note was written, and Martin Hewitt, without glancing at the address,  thrust it into his pocket. When Ritter was safely in the inner office,  however, he drew it out and read the address. \"I see,\" he observed, \"he  uses the same name, Hunter; 27 Little Carton Street, Westminster, is the  address, and there I shall go at once with the note. If the man comes  here, I think you had better lock him in with Ritter, and send for a  policeman--it may at least frighten him. My object is, of course, to get  the man away, and then, if possible, to invade his house, in some way or  another, and steal or smash his negatives if they are there and to be  found. Stay here, in any case, till I return. And don't forget to lock up  those tracings.\"     *       *       *       *       *    It was about six o'clock when Hewitt returned, alone, but with a smiling  face that told of good fortune at first sight.    \"First, Mr. Dixon,\" he said, as he dropped into an easy chair in the  private room, \"let me ease your mind by the information that I have been  most extraordinarily lucky; in fact, I think you have no further cause for  anxiety. Here are the negatives. They were not all quite dry when I--well,  what?--stole them, I suppose I must say; so that they have stuck together  a bit, and probably the films are damaged. But you don't mind that, I  suppose?\"    He laid a small parcel, wrapped in a newspaper, on the table. The engineer  hastily tore away the paper and took up five or six glass photographic  negatives, of a half-plate size, which were damp, and stuck together by  the gelatine films in couples. He held them, one after another, up to the  light of the window, and glanced through them. Then, with a great sigh of  relief, he placed them on the hearth and pounded them to dust and  fragments with the poker.    For a few seconds neither spoke. Then Dixon, flinging himself into a  chair, said:    \"Mr. Hewitt, I can't express my obligation to you. What would have  happened if you had failed, I prefer not to think of. But what shall we do  with Ritter now? The other man hasn't been here yet, by the by.\"    \"No; the fact is I didn't deliver the letter. The worthy gentleman saved  me a world of trouble by taking himself out of the way.\" Hewitt laughed.  \"I'm afraid he has rather got himself into a mess by trying two kinds of  theft at once, and you may not be sorry to hear that his attempt on your  torpedo plans is likely to bring him a dose of penal servitude for  something else. I'll tell you what has happened.    \"Little Carton Street, Westminster, I found to be a seedy sort of  place--one of those old streets that have seen much better days. A good  many people seem to live in each house--they are fairly large houses, by  the way--and there is quite a company of bell-handles on each doorpost,  all down the side like organ-stops. A barber had possession of the ground  floor front of No. 27 for trade purposes, so to him I went. 'Can you tell  me,' I said, 'where in this house I can find Mr. Hunter?' He looked  doubtful, so I went on: 'His friend will do, you know--I can't think of  his name; foreign gentleman, dark, with a bushy beard.'    \"The barber understood at once. 'Oh, that's Mirsky, I expect,' he said.  'Now, I come to think of it, he has had letters addressed to Hunter once  or twice; I've took 'em in. Top floor back.'    \"This was good so far. I had got at 'Mr. Hunter's' other alias. So, by way  of possessing him with the idea that I knew all about him, I determined to  ask for him as Mirsky before handing over the letter addressed to him as  Hunter. A little bluff of that sort is invaluable at the right time. At  the top floor back I stopped at the door and tried to open it at once, but  it was locked. I could hear somebody scuttling about within, as though  carrying things about, and I knocked again. In a little while the door  opened about a foot, and there stood Mr. Hunter--or Mirsky, as you  like--the man who, in the character of a traveler in steam-packing, came  here twice to-day.

The white folks had fine  goose feather beds. We had no idle days. Had a long time at dinner to  rest and rest and water the teams. Sometimes we fed them. Old mistress  had two peafowls roosted in the Colonial poplar trees. She had a pigeon  house and a turkey house. I recken chicken and goose house, too. When  company come you take em to see the farm, the garden, the new leather  things jes' made and to see the little ducks, calves, and colts. Folks  don't care bout seeing that now.    \"The girls went to Florence to school. All I can recollect is them going  off to school and I knowed it was Florence.    \"The Yankees burned the big house. It was a fine house. Old mistress  moved in the overseer's house. He was a white man. He moved somewhere  else. The Yankees made raids and took 15 or 20 calves from her at one  time. They set the tater house afire. They took the corn. Old mistress  cried more on one time. The Yankees starved out more black faces than  white at their stealing. After that war it was hard for the slaves to  have a shelter and enough eatin' that winter. They died in piles bout  after that August I tole you bout. Joe Innes was our overseer when the  house burned.    \"The Ku Klux come to my house twice. They couldn't get filled up wid  water. They scared us to death.

Interviewer: Miss Irene Robertson  Person interviewed: Emma Barr, Madison, Arkansas  Age: 65      \"My parents belong to two people. Mama was born in Mississippi I think  and papa come from North Carolina. Papa's master was Lark Hickerson.  Mama was sold from Dr. Ware to Dr. Pope. She was grown when she was  sold. She was the mother of twenty-seven children. She had twins three  times.    \"During the Civil War she was run from the Yankees and had twins on the  road. They died or was born dead and she nearly died. They was buried  between twin trees close to Hernando, Mississippi. Her last owner was  Dr. Pope, ten miles south of Augusta, Arkansas. I was born there and  raised up three miles south of Augusta, Arkansas.    \"When mama was sold she left her people in Mississippi but after freedom  her sisters, Aunt Mariah and Aunt Mary, come here to mama. Aunt Mariah  had no children. Aunt Mary had four boys, two girls. She brought her  children. Mama said her husband when Dr. Ware owned her was Maxwell but  she married my papa after Dr. Pope bought her.    \"Dr. Ware had a fine man he bred his colored house women to. They didn't  plough and do heavy work. He was hostler, looked after the stock and got  in wood. The women hated him, and the men on the place done as well.  They hated him too. My papa was a Hickerson. He was a shoemaker and  waited on Dr. Pope. Dr. Pope and Miss Marie was good to my parents and  to my auntees when they come out here.    \"I am the onliest one of mama's children living. Mama was sold on the  block and cried off I heard them say when they lived at Wares in  Mississippi. Mama was a house girl, Aunt Mary cooked and my oldest  sister put fire on the skillet and oven lids. That was her job.    \"Mama was lighter than I am. She had Indian blood in her. One auntee was  half white. She was lighter than I am, had straight hair; the other  auntee was real dark. She spun and wove and knit socks. Mama said they  had plenty to eat at both homes. Dr. Pope was good to her. Mama went to  the white folks church to look after the babies. They took the babies  and all the little children to church in them days.    \"Mama said the preachers told the slaves to be good and bedient. The  colored folks would meet up wid one another at preaching same as the  white folks. I heard my auntees say when the Yankees come to the house  the mistress would run give the house women their money and jewelry and  soon as the Yankees leave they would come get it. That was at Wares in  Mississippi.    \"I heard them talk about slipping off and going to some house on the  place and other places too and pray for freedom during the War. They  turned an iron pot upside down in the room. When some mens' slaves was  caught on another man's place he was allowed to whoop them and send them  home and they would git another whooping. Some men wouldn't allow that;  they said they would tend to their own slaves. So many men had to leave  home to go to war times got slack.    \"It was Judge Martin that owned my papa before he was freed. He lived  close to Augusta, Arkansas. When he was freed he lived at Dr. Pope's. He  was sold in North Carolina. Dr. Pope and Judge Martin told them they was  free. Mama stayed on with Dr. Pope and he paid her. He never did whoop  her. Mama told me all this. She died a few years ago. She was old. I  never heard much about the Ku Klux. Mama was a good speller. I was a  good speller at school and she learned with us. I spelled in Webster's  Blue Back Speller.    \"We children stayed around home till we married off. I nursed nearly all  my life. Me and my husband farmed ten years. He died. I don't have a  child. I wish I did have a girl. My cousin married us in the church. His  name was Andrew Baccus.    \"After my husband died I went to Coffeeville, Kansas and nursed an old  invalid white woman three years, till she died. I come back here where I  was knowed.

Taylor  Person interviewed: Robert Barr                      3108 West 18th St.                      Little Rock, Ark.  Age: 73  Occupation: Preaching      [HW: A Preacher Tells His Story]    \"I am a minister of the Gospel. I have been preaching for the last  thirty years. I am batching here. A man does better to live by himself.  Young people got the devil in them now a days. Your own children don't  want you around.    \"I got one grand-daughter that ain't never stood on the floor. Her  husband kicked her and hit her and she ain't never been able to stand up  since. I got another daughter that ain't thinking about marrying. She  just goes from one man to the other.    \"The government gives me a pension. The white folks help me all along.  Before I preached, I fiddled, danced, shot craps, did anything.    \"My mother was born in Chickasaw, Mississippi. She was born a slave. Old  man Barr was her master. She was a Lucy Appelin and she married a Barr.  I don't know whether she stood on the floor and married them as they do  now or not. They tell me that they just gave them to them in those days.  My mother said that they didn't know anything about marriage then. They  had some sort of a way of doing. Ol' Massa would call them up and say,  'You take that man, and go ahead. You are man and wife.' I don't care  whether you liked it or didn't. You had to go ahead. I heard em say:  'Nigger ain't no more'n a horse or cow,' But they got out from under  that now. The world is growing more and more civilized. But when a  nigger thinks he is something, he ain't nothin'. White folks got all the  laws and regulations in their hands and they can do as they please. You  surrender under em and go along and you are all right. If they told a  woman to go to a man and she didn't, they would whip her. You didn't  have your own way. They would make you do what they wanted. They'd give  you a good beating too.    \"My father was born in Mississippi. His name was Simon Barr. My mother  and father both lived on the same plantation. In all groups of people  they went by their master's name. Before she married, my mother's master  and mistress were Appelins. When she got married--got ready to  marry--the white folks agreed to let them go together. Old Man Barr must  have paid something for her. According to my mother and father, that's  the way it was. She had to leave her master and go with her husband's  master.    \"According to my old father and mother, the Patteroles went and got the  niggers when they did something wrong. They lived during slave time.  They had a rule and government over the colored and there you are. When  they caught niggers out, they would beat them. If you'd run away, they'd  go and get you and beat you and put you back. When they'd get on a  nigger and beat him, the colored folks would holler, 'I pray, Massa.'  They had to have a great war over it, before they freed the nigger. The  Bible says there is a time for all things.    \"My mother and father said they got a certain amount when they was  freed. I don't know how much it was. It was only a small amount. After a  short time it broke up and they didn't get any more. I get ten dollars  pension now and that is more than they got then.    \"I heard Old Brother Page in Mississippi say that the slaves had heard  em say they were going to be free. His young mistress heard em say he  was going to be free and she walked up and hocked and spit in his face.  When freedom came, old Massa came out and told them.    \"I have heard folks talk of buried treasure. I'll bet there's more money  under the ground than there is on it. They didn't have banks then, and  they put their money under the ground. For hundreds of years, there has  been money put under the ground.  "]]]
