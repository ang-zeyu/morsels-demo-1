He arrived at illusion of the senses, regarded as a high  attainment in art,--as in the instance recorded of his grapes, at which  the birds pecked. He belonged to the Asiatic school, whose headquarters  were at Ephesus,--the peculiarities of which were accuracy of imitation,  the exhibition of sensuous charms, and the gratification of sensual  tastes. He went to Athens about the time that the sculpture of Phidias  was completed, which modified his style. His marvellous powers were  displayed in the contrast of light and shade, which he learned from  Apollodorus. He gave ideal beauty to his figures, but it was in form  rather than in expression. He taught the true method of grouping, by  making each figure the perfect representation of the class to which it  belonged. His works were deficient in those qualities which elevate the  feelings and the character. He was the Euripides rather than the Homer  of his art. He exactly imitated natural objects, which are incapable of  ideal representation. His works were not so numerous as they were  perfect in their way, in some of which, as in the Infant Hercules  strangling the Serpent, he displayed great dramatic power. Lucian highly  praises his Female Centaur as one of the most remarkable paintings of  the world, in which he showed great ingenuity of contrasts. His Jupiter  Enthroned is also extolled by Pliny, as one of his finest works. Zeuxis  acquired a great fortune, and lived ostentatiously.    Contemporaneous with Zeuxis, and equal in fame, was Parrhasius, a native  of Ephesus, whose skill lay in accuracy of drawing and power of  expression. He gave to painting true proportion, and attended to minute  details of the countenance and the hair. In his gods and heroes, he did  for painting what Phidias did in sculpture. His outlines were so perfect  as to indicate those parts of the figure which they did not express. He  established a rule of proportion which was followed by all succeeding  artists. While many of his pieces were of a lofty character, some were  demoralizing. Zeuxis yielded the palm to him, since Parrhasius painted a  curtain which deceived his rival, whereas the grapes of Zeuxis had  deceived only birds. Parrhasius was exceedingly arrogant and luxurious,  and boasted of having reached the utmost limits of his art. He combined  the magic tone of Apollodorus with the exquisite design of Zeuxis and  the classic expression of Polygnotus.    Many were the eminent painters that adorned the fifth century before  Christ, not only in Athens, but in the Ionian cities of Asia. Timanthes  of Sicyon was distinguished for invention, and Eupompus of the same  city founded a school. His advice to Lysippus is memorable: \"Let Nature,  not an artist, be your model.\" Protogenes was celebrated for his high  finish. His Talissus took him seven years to complete. Pamphilus was  celebrated for composition, Antiphilus for facility, Theon of Samos for  prolific fancy, Apelles for grace, Pausias for his chiaro-oscuro,  Nicomachus for his bold and rapid pencil, Aristides for depth of  expression.    The art probably culminated in Apelles, who was at once a rich colorist  and portrayer of sensuous charm and a scientific artist, while he added  a peculiar grace of his own, which distinguished him above both his  predecessors and contemporaries. He was contemporaneous with Alexander,  and was alone allowed to paint the picture of the great conqueror.  Apelles was a native of Ephesus, studied under Pamphilus of Amphipolis,  and when he had gained reputation he went to Sicyon and took lessons  from Melanthius. He spent the best part of his life at the court of  Philip and Alexander, and painted many portraits of these great men and  of their generals. He excelled in portraits, and labored so assiduously  to perfect himself in drawing that he never spent a day without  practising. He made great improvement in the mechanical part of his art,  inventing some colors, and being the first to varnish pictures. By the  general consent of ancient authors, Apelles stands at the head of all  the painters of their world. His greatest work was his Venus Anadyomene,  or Venus rising out of the sea, in which female grace was personified;  the falling drops of water from her hair gave the appearance of a  transparent silver veil over her form. This picture cost one hundred  talents, was painted for the Temple of Aesculapius at Cos, and afterward  placed by Augustus in the temple which he dedicated to Julius Caesar.  The lower part of it becoming injured, no one could be found to repair  it; nor was there an artist who could complete an unfinished picture  which Apelles left. He feared no criticism, and was unenvious of the  fame of rivals.    After Apelles, the art of painting declined, although great painters  occasionally appeared, especially from the school of Sicyon, which was  renowned for nearly two hundred years. The destruction of Corinth by  Mummius, 146 B.C., gave a severe blow to Grecian art. This general  destroyed, or carried to Rome, more works than all his predecessors  combined. Sulla, when he spoiled Athens, inflicted a still greater  injury; and from that time artists resorted to Rome and Alexandria and  other flourishing cities for patronage and remuneration. The  masterpieces of famous artists brought enormous prices, and Greece and  Asia were ransacked for old pictures. The paintings which Aemilius  Paulus brought from Greece required two hundred and fifty wagons to  carry them in the triumphal procession. With the spoliation of Greece,  the migration of artists began; and this spoliation of Greece, Asia, and  Sicily continued for two centuries. We have already said that such was  the wealth of Rhodes in works of art that three thousand statues were  found there by the conquerors; nor could there have been less at Athens,  Olympia, and Delphi. Scaurus had all the public pictures of Sicyon  transported to Rome. Verres plundered every temple and public building  in Sicily.    Thus Rome was possessed of the finest paintings in the world, without  the slightest claim to the advancement of the art. And if the opinion of  Sir Joshua Reynolds is correct, art could advance no higher in the realm  of painting, as well as of statuary, than the Greeks had already borne  it. Yet the Romans learned to place as high value on the works of  Grecian genius as the English do on the paintings of the old masters of  Italy and Flanders. And if they did not add to the art, they gave such  encouragement that under the emperors it may be said to have been  flourishing. Varro had a gallery of seven hundred portraits of eminent  men. The portraits as well as the statues of the great were placed in  the temples, libraries, and public buildings. The baths especially were  filled with paintings.    The great masterpieces of the Greeks were either historical or  mythological. Paintings of gods and heroes, groups of men and women, in  which character and passion could be delineated, were the most highly  prized. It was in the expression given to the human figure--in beauty of  form and countenance, in which all the emotions of the soul, as well as  the graces of the body were portrayed--that the Greek artists sought to  reach the ideal, and to gain immortality. And they painted for a people  who had both a natural and a cultivated taste and sensibility.    Among the Romans portrait, decorative, and scene painting engrossed the  art, much to the regret of such critics as Pliny and Vitruvius. Nothing  could be in more execrable taste than a colossal painting of Nero, one  hundred and twenty feet high. From the time of Augustus landscape  decorations were common, and were carried out with every species of  license. Among the Greeks we do not read of landscape painting. This has  been reserved for our age, and is much admired, as it was at Rome in the  latter days of the empire. Mosaic work, of inlaid stones or composition  of varying shades and colors, gradually superseded painting in Rome; it  was first used for floors, and finally walls and ceilings were  ornamented with it. It is true, the ancients could show no such  exquisite perfection of colors, tints, and shades as may be seen to-day  in the wonderful reproductions of world-renowned paintings on the walls  of St. Peter's at Rome; but many ancient mosaics have been preserved  which attest beauty of design of the highest character,--like the Battle  of Issus, lately discovered at Pompeii; and this brilliant art had its  origin and a splendid development at the hands of the old Romans.    Thus in all those arts of which modern civilization is proudest, and in  which the genius of man has soared to the loftiest heights, the ancients  were not merely our equals,--they were our superiors. It is greater to  originate than to copy. In architecture, in sculpture, and perhaps in  painting, the Greeks attained absolute perfection. Any architect of our  time, who should build an edifice in different proportions from those  that were recognized in the great cities of antiquity, would make a  mistake. Who can improve upon the Doric columns of the Parthenon, or  upon the Corinthian capitals of the Temple of Jupiter? Indeed, it is in  proportion as we accurately copy the faultless models of the age of  Pericles that excellence with us is attained and recognized; when we  differ from them we furnish grounds of just criticism. So in  sculpture,--the finest modern works are inspired by antique models. It  is only when the artist seeks to bring out the purest and loftiest  sentiments of the soul, such as only Christianity can inspire, that he  may hope to surpass the sculpture of antiquity in one department of that  art alone,--in expression, rather than in beauty of form, on which no  improvement can be made. And if we possessed the painted Venus of  Apelles, as we can boast of having the sculptured Venus of Cleomenes, we  should probably discover"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10542"],[0,"The Boats of the \"Glen Carrig\" (#17)"],[1,"in strange lands and seas, and so could not by  any means contain ourselves in patience until those aboard the hulk  should choose to discover themselves to us.    And so, at last, being wearied with watching, we made it up together to  shout when the bo'sun should give us the signal, by this means making a  good volume of sound which we conceived the wind might carry down to the  vessel. Yet though we raised many shouts, making as it seemed to us a  very great noise, there came no response from the ship, and at last we  were fain to cease from our calling, and ponder some other way of  bringing ourselves to the notice of those within the hulk.    For a while we talked, some proposing one thing, and some another; but  none of them seeming like to achieve our purpose. And after that we fell  to marveling that the fire which we had lit in the valley had not  awakened them to the fact that some of their fellow creatures were upon  the island; for, had it, we could not suppose but that they would have  kept a perpetual watch upon the island until such time as they should  have been able to attract our notice. Nay! more than this, it was scarce  credible that they should not have made an answering fire, or set some of  their bunting above the superstructure, so that our gaze should be  arrested upon the instant we chanced to glance towards the hulk. But so  far from this, there appeared even a purpose to shun our attention; for  that light which we had viewed in the past night was more in the way of  an accident, than of the nature of a purposeful exhibition.    And so, presently, we went to breakfast, eating heartily; our night of  wakefulness having given us mighty appetites; but, for all that, we were  so engrossed by the mystery of the lonesome craft, that I doubt if any of  us knew what manner of food it was with which we filled our bellies. For  first one view of the matter would be raised, and when this had been  combated, another would be broached, and in this wise it came up finally  that some of the men were falling in doubt whether the ship was inhabited  by anything human, saying rather that it might be held by some demoniac  creature of the great weed-continent. At this proposition, there came  among us a very uncomfortable silence; for not only did it chill the  warmth of our hopes; but seemed like to provide us with a fresh terror,  who were already acquainted with too much. Then the bo'sun spoke,  laughing with a hearty contempt at our sudden fears, and pointed out  that it was just as like that they aboard the ship had been put in fear  by the great blaze from the valley, as that they should take it for a  sign that fellow creatures and friends were at hand. For, as he put it to  us, who of us could say what fell brutes and demons the weed-continent  did hold, and if we had reason to know that there were very dread things  among the weed, how much the more must they, who had, for all that we  knew, been many years beset around by such. And so, as he went on to make  clear, we might suppose that they were very well aware there had come  some creatures to the island; yet, maybe, they desired not to make  themselves known until they had been given sight of them, and because of  this, we must wait until they chose to discover themselves to us.    Now when the bo'sun had made an end, we felt each one of us greatly  cheered; for his discourse seemed very reasonable. Yet still there were  many matters that troubled our company; for, as one put it, was it not  mightily strange that we had not had previous sight of their light, or,  in the day, of the smoke from their galley fire? But to this the bo'sun  replied that our camp hitherto had lain in a place where we had not  sight, even of the great world of weed, leaving alone any view of the  derelict. And more, that at such times as we had crossed to the opposite  beach, we had been occupied too sincerely to have much thought to watch  the hulk, which, indeed, from that position showed only her great  superstructure. Further, that, until the preceding day, we had but once  climbed to any height; and that from our present camp the derelict could  not be viewed, and to do so, we had to go near to the leeward edge of  the hill-top.    And so, breakfast being ended, we went all of us to see if there were yet  any signs of life in the hulk; but when an hour had gone, we were no  wiser. Therefore, it being folly to waste further time, the bo'sun left  one man to watch from the brow of the hill, charging him very strictly to  keep in such position that he could be seen by any aboard the silent  craft, and so took the rest down to assist him in the repairing of the  boat. And from thence on, during the day, he gave the men a turn each at  watching, telling them to wave to him should there come any sign from the  hulk. Yet, excepting the watch, he kept every man so busy as might be,  some bringing weed to keep up a fire which he had lit near the boat; one  to help him turn and hold the batten upon which he labored; and two he  sent across to the wreck of the mast, to detach one of the futtock  shrouds, which (as is most rare) were made of iron rods. This, when they  brought it, he bade me heat in the fire, and afterwards beat out straight  at one end, and when this was done, he set me to burn holes with it  through the keel of the boat, at such places as he had marked, these  being for the bolts with which he had determined to fasten on the batten.    In the meanwhile, he continued to shape the batten until it was a very  good and true fit according to his liking. And all the while he cried out  to this man and to that one to do this or that; and so I perceived that,  apart from the necessity of getting the boat into a seaworthy condition,  he was desirous to keep the men busied; for they were become so excited  at the thought of fellow creatures almost within hail, that he could not  hope to keep them sufficiently in hand without some matter upon which to  employ them.    Now, it must not be supposed that the bo'sun had no share of our  excitement; for I noticed that he gave ever and anon a glance to the  crown of the far hill, perchance the watchman had some news for us. Yet  the morning went by, and no signal came to tell us that the people in the  ship had design to show themselves to the man upon watch, and so we came  to dinner. At this meal, as might be supposed, we had a second  discussion upon the strangeness of the behavior of those aboard the hulk;  yet none could give any more reasonable explanation than the bo'sun had  given in the morning, and so we left it at that.    Presently, when we had smoked and rested very comfortably, for the bo'sun  was no tyrant, we rose at his bidding to descend once more to the beach.  But at this moment, one of the men having run to the edge of the hill to  take a short look at the hulk, cried out that a part of the great  superstructure over the quarter had been removed, or pushed back, and  that there was a figure there, seeming, so far as his unaided sight could  tell, to be looking through a spy-glass at the island. Now it would be  difficult to tell of all our excitement at this news, and we ran eagerly  to see for ourselves if it could be as he informed us. And so it was; for  we could see the person very clearly; though remote and small because of  the distance. That he had seen us, we discovered in a moment; for he  began suddenly to wave something, which I judged to be the spy-glass, in  a very wild manner, seeming also to be jumping up and down. Yet, I doubt  not but that we were as much excited; for suddenly I discovered myself to  be shouting with the rest in a most insane fashion, and more-over I was  waving my hands and running to and fro upon the brow of the hill. Then, I  observed that the figure on the hulk had disappeared; but it was for no  more than a moment, and then it was back and there were near a dozen with  it, and it seemed to me that some of them were females; but the distance  was over great for surety. Now these, all of them, seeing us upon the  brow of the hill, where we must have shown up plain against the sky,  began at once to wave in a very frantic way, and we, replying in like  manner, shouted ourselves hoarse with vain greetings. But soon we grew  wearied of the unsatisfactoriness of this method of showing our  excitement, and one took a piece of the square canvas, and let it stream  out into the wind, waving it to them, and another took a second piece and  did likewise, while a third man rolled up a short bit into a cone and  made use of it as a speaking trumpet; though I doubt if his voice carried  any the further because of it. For my part, I had seized one of the long  bamboo-like reeds which were lying about near the fire, and with this I  was making a very brave show. And so it may be seen how very great and  genuine was our exaltation upon our discovery of these poor people shut  off from the world within that lonesome craft.    Then, suddenly, it seemed to come to us to realize that _they_ were among  the weed, and _we_ upon the hilltop, and that we had no means of bridging  that which lay between. And at this we faced one another to discuss what  we should do to effect the rescue of those within the hulk. Yet it was  little that we could even suggest; for though one spoke of how he had  seen a rope cast by means of a mortar to a ship that lay off shore, yet  this helped us not, for we had no mortar; but here the same man cried out  that they in the ship might have such a thing, so that they would be able  to shoot the rope to us, and at this we thought more upon his saying; for  if they had such a weapon, then might our difficulties be solved. Yet we  were greatly at a loss to know how we should discover whether they were  possessed of one, and further to explain our design to them. But here the  bo'sun came to our help, and bade one man go quickly and char some of the  "]]]
