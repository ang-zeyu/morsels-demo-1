Nor, in going      to my room at an earlier hour than usual--about half-past ten--was I      conscious of anything that I could call a noise. It so happened that      I had told John to come to my room for the letter to the bishop which      I wished to have delivered early in the morning at the Palace. He was      to sit up, therefore, and come for it when he heard me retire. This I      had for the moment forgotten, though I had remembered to carry the      letter with me to my room. But when, as I was winding up my watch, I      heard a light tap at the door, and a low voice saying, 'May I come      in?' (which I most undoubtedly did hear), I recollected the fact, and      took up the letter from my dressing-table, saying, 'Certainly: come      in.' No one, however, answered my summons, and it was now that, as I      strongly suspect, I committed an error: for I opened the door and      held the letter out. There was certainly no one at that moment in the      passage, but, in the instant of my standing there, the door at the      end opened and John appeared carrying a candle. I asked him whether      he had come to the door earlier; but am satisfied that he had not. I      do not like the situation; but although my senses were very much on      the alert, and though it was some time before I could sleep, I must      allow that I perceived nothing further of an untoward character.    With the return of spring, when his sister came to live with him for some  months, Dr Haynes's entries become more cheerful, and, indeed, no symptom  of depression is discernible until the early part of September, when he  was again left alone. And now, indeed, there is evidence that he was  incommoded again, and that more pressingly. To this matter I will return  in a moment, but I digress to put in a document which, rightly or  wrongly, I believe to have a bearing on the thread of the story.    The account-books of Dr Haynes, preserved along with his other papers,  show, from a date but little later than that of his institution as  archdeacon, a quarterly payment of L25 to J. L. Nothing could have been  made of this, had it stood by itself. But I connect with it a very dirty  and ill-written letter, which, like another that I have quoted, was in a  pocket in the cover of a diary. Of date or postmark there is no vestige,  and the decipherment was not easy. It appears to run:        Dr Sr.        I have bin expctin to her off you theis last wicks, and not Haveing      done so must supose you have not got mine witch was saying how me and      my man had met in with bad times this season all seems to go cross      with us on the farm and which way to look for the rent we have no      knowledge of it this been the sad case with us if you would have the      great [liberality _probably, but the exact spelling defies      reproduction_] to send fourty pounds otherwise steps will have to be      took which I should not wish. Has you was the Means of me losing my      place with Dr Pulteney I think it is only just what I am asking and      you know best what I could say if I was Put to it but I do not wish      anything of that unpleasant Nature being one that always wish to have      everything Pleasant about me.        Your obedt Servt,        Jane Lee.    About the time at which I suppose this letter to have been written there  is, in fact, a payment of L40 to J.L.    We return to the diary:        _Oct. 22_--At evening prayers, during the Psalms, I had that same      experience which I recollect from last year. I was resting my hand on      one of the carved figures, as before (I usually avoid that of the cat      now), and--I was going to have said--a change came over it, but that      seems attributing too much importance to what must, after all, be due      to some physical affection in myself: at any rate, the wood seemed to      become chilly and soft as if made of wet linen. I can assign the      moment at which I became sensible of this. The choir were singing the      words (_Set thou an ungodly man to be ruler over him and let Satan      stand at his right hand_.)        The whispering in my house was more persistent tonight. I seemed not      to be rid of it in my room. I have not noticed this before. A nervous      man, which I am not, and hope I am not becoming, would have been much      annoyed, if not alarmed, by it. The cat was on the stairs tonight. I      think it sits there always. There _is_ no kitchen cat.        _Nov. 15_--Here again I must note a matter I do not understand. I am      much troubled in sleep. No definite image presented itself, but I was      pursued by the very vivid impression that wet lips were whispering      into my ear with great rapidity and emphasis for some time together.      After this, I suppose, I fell asleep, but was awakened with a start      by a feeling as if a hand were laid on my shoulder. To my intense      alarm I found myself standing at the top of the lowest flight of the      first staircase. The moon was shining brightly enough through the      large window to let me see that there was a large cat on the second      or third step. I can make no comment. I crept up to bed again, I do      not know how. Yes, mine is a heavy burden. [Then follows a line or      two which has been scratched out. I fancy I read something like      'acted for the best'.]    Not long after this it is evident to me that the archdeacon's firmness  began to give way under the pressure of these phenomena. I omit as  unnecessarily painful and distressing the ejaculations and prayers which,  in the months of December and January, appear for the first time and  become increasingly frequent. Throughout this time, however, he is  obstinate in clinging to his post. Why he did not plead ill-health and  take refuge at Bath or Brighton I cannot tell; my impression is that it  would have done him no good; that he was a man who, if he had confessed  himself beaten by the annoyances, would have succumbed at once, and that  he was conscious of this. He did seek to palliate them by inviting  visitors to his house. The result he has noted in this fashion:        _Jan. 7_--I have prevailed on my cousin Allen to give me a few days,      and he is to occupy the chamber next to mine.        _Jan. 8_--A still night. Allen slept well, but complained of the      wind. My own experiences were as before: still whispering and      whispering: what is it that he wants to say?        _Jan. 9_--Allen thinks this a very noisy house. He thinks, too, that      my cat is an unusually large and fine specimen, but very wild.        _Jan. 10_--Allen and I in the library until 11. He left me twice to      see what the maids were doing in the hall: returning the second time      he told me he had seen one of them passing through the door at the      end of the passage, and said if his wife were here she would soon get      them into better order. I asked him what coloured dress the maid      wore; he said grey or white. I supposed it would be so.        _Jan. 11_--Allen left me today. I must be firm.    These words, _I must be firm_, occur again and again on subsequent days;  sometimes they are the only entry. In these cases they are in an  unusually large hand, and dug into the paper in a way which must have  broken the pen that wrote them.    Apparently the archdeacon's friends did not remark any change in his  behaviour, and this gives me a high idea of his courage and  determination. The diary tells us nothing more than I have indicated of  the last days of his life. The end of it all must be told in the polished  language of the obituary notice:        The morning of the 26th of February was cold and tempestuous. At an      early hour the servants had occasion to go into the front hall of the      residence occupied by the lamented subject of these lines. What was      their horror upon observing the form of their beloved and respected      master lying upon the landing of the principal staircase in an      attitude which inspired the gravest fears. Assistance was procured,      and an universal consternation was experienced upon the discovery      that he had been the object of a brutal and a murderous attack. The      vertebral column was fractured in more than one place. This might      have been the result of a fall: it appeared that the stair-carpet was      loosened at one point. But, in addition to this, there were injuries      inflicted upon the eyes, nose and mouth, as if by the agency of some      savage animal, which, dreadful to relate, rendered those features      unrecognizable. The vital spark was, it is needless to add,      completely extinct, and had been so, upon the testimony of      respectable medical authorities, for several hours. The author or      authors of this mysterious outrage are alike buried in mystery, and      the most active conjecture has hitherto failed to suggest a solution      of the melancholy problem afforded by this appalling occurrence.    The writer goes on to reflect upon the probability that the writings of  Mr Shelley, Lord Byron, and M. Voltaire may have been instrumental in  bringing about the disaster, and concludes by hoping, somewhat vaguely,  that this event may 'operate as an example to the rising generation'; but  this portion of his remarks need not be quoted in full.    I had already formed the conclusion that Dr Haynes was responsible for  the death of Dr Pulteney. But the incident connected with the carved  figure of death upon the archdeacon's stall was a very perplexing  feature. The conjecture that it had been cut out of the wood of the  Hanging Oak was not difficult, but seemed impossible to substantiate.  However, I paid a visit to Barchester, partly with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/964"],[0,"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (#16)"],[1,"very service for  me. I will go with thee, and that right gladly. Give me thy palm, sweet  fellow, and I will be thine own companion from henceforth. What may be  thy name, lad?\"    \"Men do call me Little John, good fellow.\"    \"How? And art thou indeed Little John, and Robin Hood's own right-hand  man? Many a time and oft I heard of thee, but never did I hope to set  eyes upon thee. And thou art indeed the famous Little John!\" And the  Cook seemed lost in amazement, and looked upon his companion with open  eyes.    \"I am Little John, indeed, and I will bring to Robin Hood this day a  right stout fellow to join his merry band. But ere we go, good friend,  it seemeth to me to be a vast pity that, as we have had so much of the  Sheriff's food, we should not also carry off some of his silver plate to  Robin Hood, as a present from his worship.\"    \"Ay, marry is it,\" said the Cook. And so they began hunting about, and  took as much silver as they could lay hands upon, clapping it into  a bag, and when they had filled the sack they set forth to Sherwood  Forest.    Plunging into the woods, they came at last to the greenwood tree, where  they found Robin Hood and threescore of his merry men lying upon the  fresh green grass. When Robin and his men saw who it was that came, they  leaped to their feet. \"Now welcome!\" cried Robin Hood. \"Now welcome,  Little John! For long hath it been since we have heard from thee, though  we all knew that thou hadst joined the Sheriff's service. And how hast  thou fared all these long days?\"    \"Right merrily have I lived at the Lord Sheriff's,\" answered Little  John, \"and I have come straight thence. See, good master! I have brought  thee his cook, and even his silver plate.\" Thereupon he told Robin Hood  and his merry men that were there, all that had befallen him since he  had left them to go to the Fair at Nottingham Town. Then all shouted  with laughter, except Robin Hood; but he looked grave.    \"Nay, Little John,\" said he, \"thou art a brave blade and a trusty  fellow. I am glad thou hast brought thyself back to us, and with such a  good companion as the Cook, whom we all welcome to Sherwood. But I like  not so well that thou hast stolen the Sheriff's plate like some paltry  thief. The Sheriff hath been punished by us, and hath lost three hundred  pounds, even as he sought to despoil another; but he hath done nought  that we should steal his household plate from him.\"    Though Little John was vexed with this, he strove to pass it off with a  jest. \"Nay, good master,\" quoth he, \"if thou thinkest the Sheriff gave  us not the plate, I will fetch him, that he may tell us with his own  lips he giveth it all to us.\" So saying he leaped to his feet, and was  gone before Robin could call him back.    Little John ran for full five miles till he came to where the Sheriff of  Nottingham and a gay company were hunting near the forest. When Little  John came to the Sheriff he doffed his cap and bent his knee. \"God save  thee, good master,\" quoth he.    \"Why, Reynold Greenleaf!\" cried the Sheriff, \"whence comest thou and  where hast thou been?\"    \"I have been in the forest,\" answered Little John, speaking amazedly,  \"and there I saw a sight such as ne'er before man's eyes beheld! Yonder  I saw a young hart all in green from top to toe, and about him was a  herd of threescore deer, and they, too, were all of green from head to  foot. Yet I dared not shoot, good master, for fear lest they should slay  me.\"    \"Why, how now, Reynold Greenleaf,\" cried the Sheriff, \"art thou dreaming  or art thou mad, that thou dost bring me such, a tale?\"    \"Nay, I am not dreaming nor am I mad,\" said Little John, \"and if thou  wilt come with me, I will show thee this fair sight, for I have seen  it with mine own eyes. But thou must come alone, good master, lest the  others frighten them and they get away.\"    So the party all rode forward, and Little John led them downward into  the forest.    \"Now, good master,\" quoth he at last, \"we are nigh where I saw this  herd.\"    Then the Sheriff descended from his horse and bade them wait for him  until he should return; and Little John led him forward through a close  copse until suddenly they came to a great open glade, at the end of  which Robin Hood sat beneath the shade of the great oak tree, with his  merry men all about him. \"See, good Master Sheriff,\" quoth Little John,  \"yonder is the hart of which I spake to thee.\"    At this the Sheriff turned to Little John and said bitterly, \"Long ago  I thought I remembered thy face, but now I know thee. Woe betide thee,  Little John, for thou hast betrayed me this day.\"    In the meantime Robin Hood had come to them. \"Now welcome, Master  Sheriff,\" said he. \"Hast thou come today to take another feast with me?\"    \"Nay, Heaven forbid!\" said the Sheriff in tones of deep earnest. \"I care  for no feast and have no hunger today.\"    \"Nevertheless,\" quoth Robin, \"if thou hast no hunger, maybe thou hast  thirst, and well I know thou wilt take a cup of sack with me. But I am  grieved that thou wilt not feast with me, for thou couldst have victuals  to thy liking, for there stands thy Cook.\"    Then he led the Sheriff, willy-nilly, to the seat he knew so well  beneath the greenwood tree.    \"Ho, lads!\" cried Robin, \"fill our good friend the Sheriff a right  brimming cup of sack and fetch it hither, for he is faint and weary.\"    Then one of the band brought the Sheriff a cup of sack, bowing low as he  handed it to him; but the Sheriff could not touch the wine, for he saw  it served in one of his own silver flagons, on one of his own silver  plates.    \"How now,\" quoth Robin, \"dost thou not like our new silver service? We  have gotten a bag of it this day.\" So saying, he held up the sack of  silver that Little John and the Cook had brought with them.    Then the Sheriff's heart was bitter within him; but, not daring to say  anything, he only gazed upon the ground. Robin looked keenly at him for  a time before he spoke again. Then said he, \"Now, Master Sheriff, the  last time thou camest to Sherwood Forest thou didst come seeking to  despoil a poor spendthrift, and thou wert despoiled thine own self;  but now thou comest seeking to do no harm, nor do I know that thou hast  despoiled any man. I take my tithes from fat priests and lordly squires,  to help those that they despoil and to raise up those that they bow  down; but I know not that thou hast tenants of thine own whom thou hast  wronged in any way. Therefore, take thou thine own again, nor will I  dispossess thee today of so much as one farthing. Come with me, and I  will lead thee from the forest back to thine own party again.\"    Then, slinging the bag upon his shoulder, he turned away, the Sheriff  following him, all too perplexed in mind to speak. So they went forward  until they came to within a furlong of the spot where the Sheriff's  companions were waiting for him. Then Robin Hood gave the sack of silver  back to the Sheriff. \"Take thou thine own again,\" he said, \"and hearken  to me, good Sheriff, take thou a piece of advice with it. Try thy  servants well ere thou dost engage them again so readily.\" Then,  turning, he left the other standing bewildered, with the sack in his  hands.    The company that waited for the Sheriff were all amazed to see him come  out of the forest bearing a heavy sack upon his shoulders; but though  they questioned him, he answered never a word, acting like one who walks  in a dream. Without a word, he placed the bag across his nag's back and  then, mounting, rode away, all following him; but all the time there  was a great turmoil of thoughts within his head, tumbling one over the  other. And thus ends the merry tale of Little John and how he entered  the Sheriff's service.          Little John and the Tanner of Blyth    ONE FINE DAY, not long after Little John had left abiding with the  Sheriff and had come back, with his worship's cook, to the merry  greenwood, as has just been told, Robin Hood and a few chosen fellows of  his band lay upon the soft sward beneath the greenwood tree where they  dwelled. The day was warm and sultry, so that while most of the band  were scattered through the forest upon this mission and upon that, these  few stout fellows lay lazily beneath the shade of the tree, in the soft  afternoon, passing jests among themselves and telling merry stories,  with laughter and mirth.    All the air was laden with the bitter fragrance of the May, and all  the bosky shades of the woodlands beyond rang with the sweet song of  birds--the throstle cock, the cuckoo, and the wood pigeon--and with the  song of birds mingled the cool sound of the gurgling brook that leaped  out of the forest shades, and ran fretting amid its rough, gray stones  across the sunlit open glade before the trysting tree. And a fair sight  was that halfscore of tall, stout yeomen, all clad in Lincoln green,  lying beneath the broad-spreading branches of the great oak tree, amid  the quivering leaves of which the sunlight shivered and fell in dancing  patches upon the grass.    Suddenly Robin Hood smote his knee.    \"By Saint Dunstan,\" quoth he, \"I had nigh forgot that quarter-day cometh  on apace, and yet no cloth of Lincoln green in all our store. It must be  looked to, and that in quick season. Come, busk thee, Little John! Stir  those lazy bones of thine, for thou must get thee straightway to our  good gossip, the draper Hugh Longshanks of Ancaster. Bid him send us  straightway twenty-score yards of fair cloth of Lincoln green; and mayhap  the journey may take some of the fat from off thy bones, that thou hast  gotten from lazy living at our dear Sheriff's.\"    \"Nay,\" muttered Little John (for he had heard so much upon this score  that he was sore upon the point), \"nay, truly, mayhap I have more flesh  upon my joints than I once had, yet, flesh or no flesh, I doubt not that  I could still hold my place and footing upon a narrow bridge against  e'e"]]]
