At the same moment a blind was drawn down over an  upper room; the second tree disappeared into the surrounding darkness.    It was, of course, this chance light that had brought it into the field  of vision, but when the black shutter dropped over it, hiding it from  view, the manner of its vanishing produced the queer effect that it had  slipped into its companion--almost that it had been an emanation of the  one I so disliked, and not really a tree at all! In this way the garden  turned vehicle for expressing what lay behind it all ...!    The behavior of the doors, the little, ordinary doors, seems scarcely  worth mention at all, their queer way of opening and shutting of their  own accord; for this was accountable in a hundred natural ways, and to  tell the truth, I never caught one in the act of moving. Indeed, only  after frequent repetitions did the detail force itself upon me, when,  having noticed one, I noticed all. It produced, however, the unpleasant  impression of a continual coming and going in the house, as though,  screened cleverly and purposely from actual sight, some one in the  building held constant invisible intercourse with--others.    Upon detailed descriptions of these uncertain incidents I do not  venture, individually so trivial, but taken all together so impressive  and so insolent. But the episode of the children, mentioned above, was  different. And I give it because it showed how vividly the intuitive  child-mind received the impression--one impression, at any rate--of what  was in the air. It may be told in a very few words. I believe they were  the coachman's children, and that the man had been in Mr. Franklyn's  service; but of neither point am I quite positive.    I heard screaming in the rose-garden that runs along the stable walls--  it was one afternoon not far from the tea-hour--and on hurrying up I  found a little girl of nine or ten fastened with ropes to a rustic seat,  and two other children--boys, one about twelve and one much younger--  gathering sticks beneath the climbing rose trees. The girl was white and  frightened, but the others were laughing and talking among themselves so  busily while they picked that they did not notice my abrupt arrival.  Some game, I understood, was in progress, but a game that had become too  serious for the happiness of the prisoner, for there was a fear in the  girl's eyes that was a very genuine fear indeed. I unfastened her at  once; the ropes were so loosely and clumsily knotted that they had not  hurt her skin; it was not that which made her pale. She collapsed a  moment upon the bench, then picked up her tiny skirts and dived away at  full speed into the safety of the stable-yard.    There was no response to my brief comforting, but she ran as though for  her life, and I divined that some horrid boys' cruelty had been afoot.  It was probably mere thoughtlessness, as cruelty with children usually  is, but something in me decided to discover exactly what it was.    And the boys, not one whit alarmed at my intervention, merely laughed  shyly when I explained that their prisoner had escaped, and told me  frankly what their \"gime\" had been. There was no vestige of shame in  them, nor any idea, of course, that they aped a monstrous reality.    That it was mere pretence was neither here nor there. To them, though  make-believe, it was a make-believe of something that was right and  natural and in no sense cruel. Grown-ups did it too. It was necessary  for her good.    \"We was going to burn her up, sir,\" the older one informed me, answering  my \"Why?\" with the explanation, \"Because she wouldn't believe what we  wanted 'er to believe.\"    And, game though it was, the feeling of reality about the little episode  was so arresting, so terrific in some way, that only with difficulty did  I confine my admonitions on this occasion to mere words. The boys slunk  off, frightened in their turn, yet not, I felt, convinced that they had  erred in principle. It was their inheritance. They had breathed it in  with the atmosphere of their bringing-up. They would renew the salutary  torture when they could--till she \"believed\" as they did.    I went back into the house, afflicted with a passion of mingled pity and  distress impossible to describe, yet on my short way across the garden  was attacked by other moods in turn, each more real and bitter than its  predecessor. I received the whole series, as it were, at once. I felt  like a diver rising to the surface through layers of water at different  temperatures, though here the natural order was reversed, and the cooler  strata were uppermost, the heated ones below. Thus, I was caught by the  goblin touch of the willows that fringed the field; by the sensuous  curving of the twisted ash that formed a gateway to the little grove of  sapling oaks where fauns and satyrs lurked to play in the moonlight  before Pagan altars; and by the cloaking darkness, next, of the copse of  stunted pines, close gathered each to each, where hooded figures stalked  behind an awful cross. The episode with the children seemed to have  opened me like a knife. The whole Place rushed at me.    I suspect this synthesis of many moods produced in me that climax of  loathing and disgust which made me feel the limit of bearable emotion  had been reached, so that I made straight to find Frances in order to  convince her that at any rate I must leave. For, although this was our  last day in the house, and we had arranged to go next day, the dread was  in me that she would still find some persuasive reason for staying on.  And an unexpected incident then made my dread unnecessary. The front  door was open and a cab stood in the drive; a tall, elderly man was  gravely talking in the hall with the parlor maid we called the  Grenadier. He held a piece of paper in his hand. \"I have called to see  the house,\" I heard him say, as I ran up the stairs to Frances, who was  peering like an inquisitive child over the banisters....    \"Yes,\" she told me with a sigh, I know not whether of resignation or  relief, \"the house is to be let or sold. Mabel has decided. Some Society  or other, I believe--\"    I was overjoyed: this made our leaving right and possible. \"You never  told me, Frances!\"    \"Mabel only heard of it a few days ago. She told me herself this  morning. It is a chance, she says. Alone she cannot get it 'straight'.    \"Defeat?\" I asked, watching her closely.    \"She thinks she has found a way out. It's not a family, you see, it's a  Society, a sort of Community--they go in for thought--\"    \"A Community!\" I gasped. \"You mean religious?\"    She shook her head. \"Not exactly,\" she said smiling, \"but some kind of  association of men and women who want a headquarters in the country--a  place where they can write and meditate--think--mature their plans and  all the rest--I don't know exactly what.\"    \"Utopian dreamers?\" I asked, yet feeling an immense relief come over me  as I heard. But I asked in ignorance, not cynically. Frances would know.  She knew all this kind of thing.    \"No, not that exactly,\" she smiled. \"Their teachings are grand and  simple--old as the world too, really--the basis of every religion before  men's minds perverted them with their manufactured creeds--\"    Footsteps on the stairs, and the sound of voices, interrupted our odd  impromptu conversation, as the Grenadier came up, followed by the tall,  grave gentleman who was being shown over the house. My sister drew me  along the corridor towards her room, where she went in and closed the  door behind me, yet not before I had stolen a good look at the caller--  long enough, at least, for his face and general appearance to have made  a definite impression on me. For something strong and peaceful emanated  from his presence; he moved with such quiet dignity; the glance of his  eyes was so steady and reassuring, that my mind labeled him instantly as  a type of man one would turn to in an emergency and not be disappointed.  I had seen him but for a passing moment, but I had seen him twice, and  the way he walked down the passage, looking competently about him,  conveyed the same impression as when I saw him standing at the door--  fearless, tolerant, wise. \"A sincere and kindly character,\" I judged  instantly, \"a man whom some big kind of love has trained in sweetness  towards the world; no hate in him anywhere.\" A great deal, no doubt, to  read in so brief a glance! Yet his voice confirmed my intuition, a deep  and very gentle voice, great firmness in it too.    \"Have I become suddenly sensitive to people's atmospheres in this  extraordinary fashion?\" I asked myself, smiling, as I stood in the room  and heard the door close behind me. \"Have I developed some clairvoyant  faculty here?\" At any other time I should have mocked.    And I sat down and faced my sister, feeling strangely comforted and at  peace for the first time since I had stepped beneath The Towers' roof a  month ago. Frances, I then saw, was smiling a little as she watched me.    \"You know him?\" I asked.    \"You felt it too?\" was her question in reply. \"No,\" she added, \"I don't  know him--beyond the fact that he is a leader in the Movement and has  devoted years and money to its objects. Mabel felt the same thing in him  that you have felt--and jumped at it.\"    \"But you've seen him before?\" I urged, for the certainty was in me that  he was no stranger to her.    She shook her head. \"He called one day early this week, when you were  out. Mabel saw him. I believe--\" she hesitated a moment, as though  expecting me to stop her with my usual impatience of such subjects--\"I  believe he has explained everything to her--the beliefs he embodies, she  declares, are her salvation--might be, rather, if she could adopt them.\"    \"Conversion again!\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11093"],[0,"Trailin'!

For the information which Nash had given seemed to remove all  his distrust of the moment before and he became instantly genial,  pleasant. In fact, he voiced this sentiment with a disarming frankness  immediately.    \"Perhaps I've seemed to be carrying a chip on my shoulder, Mr. Nash. You  see, I'm not long in the West, and the people I've met seem to be ready  to fight first and ask questions afterward. So I've caught the habit, I  suppose.\"    \"Which a habit like that ain't uncommon. The graveyards are full of  fellers that had that habit and they're going to be fuller still of the  same kind.\"    Here Sally entered, carrying the meal of the cowpuncher, arranged it,  and then sat on the edge of Bard's table, turning from one to the other  as a bird on a spray of leaves turns from sunlight to shadow and cannot  make a choice.    \"Bard,\" stated Nash, \"is going out to the ranch with me to-night.\"    \"Long ride for to-night, isn't it?\"    \"Yes, but we'll bunk on the way and finish up early in the morning.\"    \"Then you'll have a chance to teach him Western manners on the way,  Steve.\"    \"Manners?\" queried the Easterner, smiling up to the girl.    She turned, caught him beneath the chin with one hand, tilting his face,  and raised the lessoning forefinger of the other while she stared down  at him with a half frown and a half smile like a schoolteacher about to  discipline a recalcitrant boy.    \"Western manners,\" she said, \"mean first not to doubt a man till he  tries to double-cross you, and not to trust him till he saves your life;  to keep your gun inside the leather till you're backed up against the  wall, and then to start shootin' as soon as the muzzle is past the  holster. Then the thing to remember is that the fast shootin' is fine,  but sure shootin' is a lot better. D'you get me?\"    \"That's a fine sermon,\" smiled Bard, \"but you're too young to make a  convincing preacher, Miss Fortune.\"    \"Misfortune,\" said the girl quickly, \"don't have to be old to do a lot  of teachin'.\"    She sat back and regarded him with something of a frown and with folded  arms.    He said with a sudden earnestness: \"You seem to take it for granted that  I'm due for a lot of trouble.\"    But she shook her head gloomily.    \"I know what you're due for; I can see it in your eyes; I can hear it in  your way of talkin'. If you was to ride the range with a sheriff on one  side of you and a marshal on the other you couldn't help fallin' into  trouble.\"    \"As a fortune-teller,\" remarked Nash, \"you'd make a good undertaker,  Sally.\"    \"Shut up, Steve. I've seen this bird in action and I know what I'm  talking about. When you coming back this way, Bard?\"    He said thoughtfully: \"Perhaps to-morrow night--perhaps--\"    \"It ought to be to-morrow night,\" she said pointedly, her eyes on Nash.    The latter had pushed his chair back a trifle and sat now with downward  head and his right hand resting lightly on his thigh. Only the place in  which they sat was illumined by the two lamps, and the forward part of  the room, nearer the street, was a sea of shadows, wavering when the  wind stirred the flame in one of the lamps or sent it smoking up the  chimney. Sally and Bard sat with their backs to the door, and Nash half  facing it.    \"Steve,\" she said, with a sudden low tenseness of voice that sent a  chill up Bard's spinal cord, \"Steve, what's wrong?\"    \"This,\" answered the cowboy calmly, and whirling in his chair, his gun  flashed and exploded.    They sprang up in time to see the bulky form of Butch Conklin rise out  of the shadows in the front part of the room with outstretched arms,  from one of which a revolver dropped clattering to the floor. Backward  he reeled as though a hand were pulling him from behind, and then  measured his length with a crash on the floor.    Bard, standing erect, quite forgot to touch his weapon, but Sally had  produced a ponderous forty-five with mysterious speed and now crouched  behind a table with the gun poised. Nash, bending low, ran forward to  the fallen man.    \"Nicked, but not done for,\" he called.    \"Thank God!\" cried Sally, and the two joined Nash about the prostrate  body.    That bullet had had very certain intentions, but by a freak of chance  it had been deflected on the angle of the skull and merely ploughed a  bloody furrow through the mat of hair from forehead to the back of the  skull. He was stunned, but hardly more seriously hurt than if he had  been knocked down by a club.    \"I've an idea,\" said the Easterner calmly, \"that I owe my life to you,  Mr. Nash.\"    \"Let that drop,\" answered the other.    \"A quarter of an inch lower,\" said the girl, who was examining the  wound, \"and Butch would have kissed the world good-bye.\"    Not till then did the full horror of the thing dawn on Bard. The girl  was no more excited than one of her Eastern cousins would have been over  a game of bridge, and the man in the most matter-of-fact manner, was  slipping another cartridge into the cylinder of the revolver, which he  then restored to the holster.    It still seemed incredible that the man could have drawn his gun and  fired it in that flash of time. He recalled his adventure with Butch  earlier that evening and with Sandy Ferguson before; for the first time  he realized what he had done and a cold horror possessed him like the  man who has nerves to walk the tight rope across the chasm and faints  when he looks back on the gorge from the safety of the other side. The  girl took command.    \"Steve, run down to the marshal's office; Deputy Glendin is there.\"    She took the wet cloth and made a deft bandage for the head of Conklin.  With his shaggy hair covered, and all his face sagging with lines of  weariness, the gun-fighter seemed no more than a middle-aged man asleep,  worn out by trouble.    \"Is there a doctor?\" asked Bard anxiously.    \"That ain't a case for a doctor--look here; you're in a blue faint. What  is the matter?\"    \"I don't know; I'm thinking of that quarter of an inch which would have  meant the difference to poor Conklin.\"    \"'Poor' Conklin? Why, you fish, he was sneakin' in here to try his hand  on you. He found out he couldn't get his gang into town, so he slipped  in by himself. He'll get ten years for this--and a thousand if they hold  him up for the other things he's done.\"    \"I know--and this fellow Nash was as quiet as the strike of a snake. If  he'd been a fraction of a second slower I might be where Conklin is now.  I'll never forget Nash for this.\"    She said pointedly: \"No, he's a bad one to forget; keep an eye on him.  You spoke of a snake--that's how smooth Steve is.\"    \"Remember your own motto, Miss Fortune. He saved my life; therefore I  must trust him.\"    She answered sullenly: \"You're your own boss.\"    \"What's wrong with Nash?\"    \"Find out for yourself.\"    \"Are all these fellows something other than they seem?\"    \"What about yourself?\"    \"How do you mean that?\"    \"What trail are you on, Bard? Don't look so innocent. Oh, I seen you was  after something a long time ago.\"    \"I am. After excitement, you know.\"    \"Ain't you finding enough?\"    \"I've got two things ahead of me.\"    \"Well?\"    \"This trip, and when I come back I think making love to you would be  more exciting than gun-plays.\"    They regarded each other with bantering smiles.    \"A tenderfoot like you make love to me? That would be exciting, all  right, if it wasn't so funny.\"    \"As for the competition,\" he said serenely, \"that would be simply a good  background.\"    \"Hate yourself, don't you, Bard?\" she grinned.    \"The rest of these boys are all very well, but they don't see that what  you want is the velvet touch.\"    \"What's that?\"    She was as frankly curious as some boy hearing a new game described.    \"You've only been loved in one way. These rough-handed fellows come in  and throw an arm around you and ask you to marry them; isn't that it?  What you really need, is an old, simple, but very effective method.\"    Though her eyes were shining, she yawned.    \"It don't interest me, Bard.\"    \"On the contrary, you're getting quite excited.\"    \"So does a horse before it gets ready to buck.\"    \"Exactly. If I thought it would be easy I wouldn't be tempted.\"    \"Well, if you like fighting you've sure mapped out a nice sizeable  quarrel with me, Bud.\"    \"Good. I'm certainly coming back to Eldara. Now about this method of  mine--\"    \"Throwing your cards on the table, eh? What you got, Bard, a royal  flush?\"    \"Right again. It's a very simple method but you couldn't beat it.\"    \"Bud, you ain't half old enough to kid me.\"    \"What you need,\" he persisted calmly, \"is someone who would sit down  and simply talk good, plain English to you.\"    \"Let 'er go.\"    \"In the first place I will call attention to your method of dressing.\"    \"Anything wrong with it?\"    \"I knew you'd be interested.\"    She slipped into a chair and sat cross-legged in it, her elbows on her  knees and her chin cupped in both her hands.    \"Sure I'm interested. If there's a new way fixin' ham-and, serve it  out.\"    \"I would begin,\" he went on judiciously, \"by saying that you dressed in  five minutes in the dark.\"    \"It's generally dark at 5 a.m.,\" she admitted.    \"You look, on the whole, as if you'd fallen into your clothes.\"    The wounded man stirred and groaned faintly.    She called: \"Lie down, Butch; I'm busy. Go on, Bard.\"    \"If you keep a mirror it's a wall decoration--not for personal use.\"    \"Maybe this is an old method, Bard; but around this place it'd be a  quick way of gettin' shot.\"    \"Angry?\"    \"You'd peeve a mule.\"    \"This was only an introduction. The next thing is to sit close beside  you and shift the lamp so that the light would shine on your face; then  take your hand--\"    He suited his action to his word.    \"Let go my hand, "]]]
