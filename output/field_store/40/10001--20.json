[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7300"],[0,"Woman and the Republic (#16)"],[1,"of the 'Liberator.' August 3,  the abolitionists of Andover Theological Seminary issued a similar appeal.  Among the complaints were some against 'speculations that lead inevitably  to disorganization, anarchy, unsettling the domestic economy, removing the  landmarks of society, and unhinging the machinery of government.' A new  Anti-slavery society in Bangor passed the following resolution: 'That,  while we admit the right of full and free discussion of all subjects, yet,  in our judgment, individuals rejecting the authority of civil and parental  governments ought not to be employed as agents and lecturers in promoting  the cause of emancipation.'\"    In his Autobiography, speaking of this time, Frederick Douglass says: \"I  believe my first offence against our Anti-slavery Israel was committed  during these Syracuse meetings. It was in this wise: Our general agent,  John A. Collins, had recently returned from England full of communistic  ideas, which ideas would do away with individual property and have all  things in common. He had arranged a corps of speakers of his communistic  persuasion, consisting of John O. Wattles, Nathaniel Whiting, and John  Orvis, to follow our Anti-slavery conventions, and while our meeting was  in progress in Syracuse Mr. Collins came in with his new friends and  doctrines and proposed to adjourn our Anti-slavery discussions and take up  the subject of communism. To this I ventured to object. I held that it was  imposing an additional burden of unpopularity on our cause, and an act of  bad faith with the people who paid the salary of Mr. Collins and were  responsible for these hundred conventions. Strange to say, my course in  this matter did not meet the approval of Mrs. Maria W. Chapman, an  influential member of the board of managers of the Massachusetts Anti-  slavery society, and called out a sharp reprimand from her, for  insubordination to my superiors.\" John O. Wattles labored hard to  introduce Woman Suffrage into the State Constitution of Kansas. Mr.  Collins worked for it in California in the early days. Mrs. Chapman, who  had embraced Mr. Collins's doctrines, was one of the first pillars of the  Suffrage movement.    Later, when Mr. Douglass determined to establish a newspaper and become  its editor, he was obliged to leave New England, \"for the sake of peace,\"  he says, as his Anti-slavery friends opposed it, saying that it was absurd  to think of a wood-sawyer offering himself as an editor. In Rochester, N.  Y., he established \"The North Star.\" He says, \"I was then a faithful  disciple of William L. Garrison, and fully committed to his doctrine  touching the pro-slavery character of the Constitution of the United  States, also the non-voting principle, of which he was the known and  distinguished advocate. With him, I held it to be the first duty of the  non-slaveholding States to dissolve the union with the slaveholding  States, and hence my cry, like his, was 'No union with slaveholders.'  After a time, a careful reconsideration of the subject convinced me that  there was no necessity for 'dissolving the union between the northern and  southern States;' that to seek this dissolution was no part of my duty as  an abolitionist; that to abstain from voting was to refuse to exercise a  legitimate and powerful means for abolishing slavery; and that the  Constitution of the United States not only contained no guarantees in  favor of slavery, but, on the contrary, was in its letter and spirit an  Anti-slavery instrument, demanding the abolition of slavery as a condition  of its own existence as the supreme law of the land. This radical change  in my opinions produced a corresponding change in my action. Those who  could not see any honest reasons for changing their views, as I had done,  could not easily see any such reasons for my change, and the common  punishment of apostates was mine. ... Among friends who had been devoted  to my cause were Isaac and Amy Post, William and Mary Hallowell, Asa and  Hulda Anthony, and indeed all the committee of the Western New York Anti-  Slavery Society. They held festivals and fairs to raise money, and  assisted me in every other possible way to keep my paper in circulation  while I was a non-voting abolitionist, but withdrew from me when I became  a voting abolitionist.\"    The Posts, the Hallowells, and the Anthonys were among the first to attach  themselves to the Suffrage movement.    The Grimk√© sisters, who were intensely interested in the abolition  agitation, followed Garrison to the extreme, and adopted the socialistic  ideas with which his wing became to a large extent identified. They were  also early in the Suffrage cause. In August, 1837, Whittier wrote to them  as follows: \"I am anxious to hold a long conversation with you on the  subject of war, human government, and church and family government. The  more I reflect upon the subject the more difficulty I find, and the more  decidedly am I of opinion that we ought to hold all these matters aloof  from the cause of abolition. Our good friend, H. C. Wright, with the best  intentions in the world, is doing great injury by a different course. He  is making the Anti-slavery party responsible in a great degree for his, to  say the least, startling opinions.... But let him keep them distinct from  the cause of emancipation. To employ an agent who devotes half his time  and talents to the propagation of 'no-human or no-family government'  doctrines in connection, _intimate_ connection, with the doctrines of  abolition, is a fraud upon the patrons of the cause. Brother Garrison  errs, I think, in this respect. He takes the 'no-church and no-government'  ground.\"    Mr. Garrison wrote to the American Anti-slavery Society of his desire to  crush the \"dissenters,\" and Maria W. Chapman wrote: \"Why will they think  they can cut away from Garrison without becoming an abomination? ... If  this defection should drink the cup and end all, we of Massachusetts will  turn and abolish them as readily as we would the colonization society.\"  Henry B. Stanton wrote to William Goodell: \"I am glad to see that you have  criticised Brother H. C. Wright. I have just returned from a few months'  tour in eastern Massachusetts, and he has done immense hurt there.\" A. A.  Phelps, agent of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery society, wrote: \"I write  you this in great grief, and yet I feel constrained to do it. The cause of  abolition here was never in so dangerous and critical a position before.  Mutual jealousies on the part of the laity and clergy are rampant; indeed,  so much so that, let a clerical brother do what he will, it is resolved as  a matter of course into a sinister motive! ... Of this stamp, more than  ever before, is friend Garrison. And Mrs. Chapman remarked to me the other  day that she sometimes doubted which needed abolition most, slavery or the  black-hearted ministry. For this cause alone we are on the brink of a  general split in our ranks.... And as if to make a bad matter worse,  Garrison insists on yoking perfectionism, no-governmentism, and woman-  preaching with abolition, as part and parcel of the same lump.\"    In 1840, Emerson, in his Amory Hall lecture, said: \"The Church or  religious party is falling from the Church nominal, and is appearing in  Temperance and non-resistant societies, in movements of abolitionists and  socialists, and in very significant assemblies called Sabbath and Bible  conventions, composed of ultraists, of seekers, of all the soul and  soldiery of dissent, and meeting to call in question the authority of the  Sabbath, of the priesthood, of the Church. In these movements nothing was  more remarkable than the discontent they begot in the movers.... They  defied each other like a congress of kings, each of whom had a realm to  rule, and a way of his own that made concert unprofitable.\"    These ideas blossomed, in due course of time, into Socialistic  communities. There was a distinctly Anti-slavery one at Hopedale,  Massachusetts. The founder, Adin Ballou, published a tract setting forth  the objects of the community, from which I make the following extracts:  \"No precise theological dogmas, ordinances, or ceremonies are prescribed  or prohibited. In such matters all the members are free, with mutual love  and toleration, to follow their own highest convictions of truth and  religious duty, answerable only to the great Head of the Church Universal.  It enjoins total abstinence from all God-contemning words and deeds; all  unchastity; all intoxicating beverages; all oath-taking; all slave-holding  and pro-slavery compromises; all war and preparations for war; all capital  and other vindictive punishments; all insurrectionary, seditious,  mobocratic, and personal violence against any government, society, family,  or individual; all voluntary participation in any anti-Christian  government, under promise of unqualified support, whether by doing  military service, commencing actions at law, holding office, voting,  petitioning for penal laws, or asking public interference for protection  which can only be given by such force. It is the seedling of the true  democratic and social Republic, wherein neither caste, color, sex, nor age  stands prescribed. It is a moral-suasion temperance society on the  teetotal basis. It is a moral-power Anti-slavery society, radical and  without compromise. It is a peace society on the only impregnable  foundation, that of Christian non-resistance. It is a sound theoretical  and practical Woman's Rights Association.\" Among other Suffragists, Abby  Kelly Foster was resident at Hopedale. Another community, at Northampton,  was sometimes described as \"Nothingarian.\"    Of the state of things at this time in the Anti-slavery societies, General  Birney says, \"The no-government men made up in activity what they lacked  in numbers. While refusing for themselves to vote at the ballot-box, they  voted in conventions and formed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7335"],[0,"Jack Harkaway and His Son's Escape from the Brigands of Greece (#16)"],[1,"to begin, and as it is of a  scientific natur dat asks for all your attention, I must ax them to go  at once who don't wish to stay and see it all through, so as not to  interrupt me.\"    \"No one wishes to go.\"    The most eager person to remain was Mr. Mole.    Poor old Mole.    Monday went on--    \"The first that I'se gwine to show you, ladies and gentlemen, is some  speciminks of what is known as the occult art, that is, the black art,  or magic.\"    Mole winced.    \"Go on.\"    \"Hear, hear!\" said Dick.    \"Bravo, Monday,\" from Jack Harkaway.    Mole was silent.    He had not another \"bravo\" in him, so to speak.    Monday bowed in acknowledgment of the plaudits.    \"In the first place, den, ladies and gentlemen,\" he went on to say, \"I  mean to show you my magic mirror.\"    Mole glanced nervously at Dick, and from him to Jack Harkaway.    But both looked as stolid as Dutchmen.    Monday drew back the curtain from the easel, disclosing a frame, on  which was fitted a plain black board.    \"In this frame,\" said the professor of the black art, \"I can show you  any persons you may ask for, dat is, persons who are known to you.\"    Mr. Mole had heard enough to convince him that he was in danger of  being once more sacrificed to the insatiable passion of his two old  pupils for chaffing and practical joking.    \"Well, sar,\" said Monday, \"just you try um.\"    \"We will,\" said Dick.    \"Well, then, sar, who shall be the first person I must bring before  you?\"    No reply.    \"Well, Mr. Mole, name somebody,\" said Monday, in his most insinuating  manner.    Mole's only reply was a dissenting growl.    \"No.\"    \"Will you, Mr. Harkaway, sar?\" he said.    \"Well, I will if you like--suppose that we call upon your friend,  Sunday?\"    \"Very good, sar.\"    And then he set to work.    A walking stick served him as a wand, and this he waved three times  slowly and majestically, while he repeated in solemn tones this  singular legend--                   \"Hokus-pokus, popalorum,                  Stickstun, stickstun, cockalorum jig.\"    Thereupon the curtain went back, and lo! Sunday appeared sitting upon a  throne of state, robed in a long crimson mantle, which made him look  like an emperor.    It was a most dignified tableau, or it would have been, but for the  long clay pipe the darkey held in his mouth and the pewter pot he  carried in his hand.    \"Ladies and gemmen,\" said Monday, \"dat is our ole friend, dressed as de  Empyroar Charleymane.\"    \"Bravo, bravo!\"    Even Mr. Mole laughed.    The curtain closed over this dignified and historical representation.    \"Now,\" said Dick Harvey, \"let us see some of our live Stock.\"    \"Yes, yes,\" said young Jack; \"show us Nero.\"    \"And Mike.\"    Monday bowed.    Then back went the curtain, and there sat Nero, the monkey, on the  throne just vacated by the emperor \"Charleymane,\" and at his feet stood  the bold poodle Mike wagging his tail.    Nero appeared to understand what was required of him, and he sat  motionless as a statue for a while, but before long the peculiar  nervous irritation to which monkeys appear to be subject attacked him,  and he began a series of spasmodic researches in natural history all  over his ribs.    \"Nero's making up for lost time,\" said young Jack; \"look how he is  getting to work.\"    Nero was indeed scratching away furiously.    \"There's diligence,\" laughed young Jack; \"now he's busy.\"    And then he broke off into the following appropriate snatch--                 \"He'll catch the flee--he'll catch the flee--                He'll catch the fleeting hour.\"    Down went the curtain.    There was a general laugh at this.    \"When we asked you to show us the live stock,\" said Dick Harvey, \"you  took us too literally, Monday.\"    \"Yah, yah!\"    \"You must learn to draw the line somewhere.\"    Monday here rapped the ground with his wand to secure attention.    Silence having been gained, he addressed them thus--    \"Before we leave dis part of de entertainment,\" he said, \"I conclude de  exhibition of one more animal. For reasons dat I need not mention, I  shall leave you to guess at de name of dis animal. It is a small animal  dat lives on wums.\"    \"Wums?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"What are they?\"    \"On wums, scriggley wums and insects, and burrows in the earth.\"    \"Why, dear me,\" said young Jack, innocently, \"that must be a mole.\"    Before a word could be said, back went the curtain, and Nero was  discovered walking upon a pair of wooden stilts.    He staggered about like a man in liquor, and made everyone yell again  at the quaint manner in which he had hit off Mr. Mole's movements.    \"Whatever has he got on his head?\" said someone.    Mole shivered.    He guessed.    Guessed; alas, he was but too sure.    Nero put all his doubts at rest by making a graceful bow and removing  his wig instead of a hat.    The wig!    Yea; the identical wig which Mr. Mole had left behind him in his  precipitate flight from the conjuror's.    This was too much.    Losing his dignity completely, Mr. Mole jumped up and burst through the  group of spectators, dashing out of the place in a perfect fury, young  Jack's voice ringing in his ears as he shouted--    \"A wig! a wig! My kingdom for a wig!\"          CHAPTER XIII.    THE BRIGANDS' CAMP--A MOUNTAIN BIVOUAC--AN ALARM--THE SOLDIERS--A  CHALLENGE--THE BRIGANDS' WIDOW--FATAL NEWS.      We change the scene.    And now we find ourselves in a mountain pass, where a number of  rough-looking men are grouped about a camp fire.    A short distance from this group stands a tall man, leaning moodily  upon the muzzle of his musket, while he watches the zig-zag paths up  the mountain side.    Upon this man one can see the whole safety of the party depends.    He is on sentry.    A prolonged silence was suddenly broken by the sentinel looking up and  grasping his musket nervously, while he turned a warning gesture to the  camp.    \"What is it?\" exclaimed one of the party, jumping up.    \"Hush!\"    The sentry turned with his finger on his lips, and motioned him to  silence.    At a sign from one of the men--evidently a superior--the whole party  sprang to their feet.    A hurried examination of their musket-locks and arms generally showed  that they expected danger, and only waited a word from the sentinel to  be \"up and doing.\"    The leader stepped up to the sentry, drawn sword in hand.    \"What is it?\"    \"The patrol.\"    \"Soldiers?\"    The sentry nodded.    \"The Carbonari?\"    \"Yes.\"    The leader grasped his sword nervously, and made a step forward as  though he would have dashed through the ravine and charge the military  alone and unaided.    But if such were his intentions, he speedily altered his mind. \"Perish  them!\" he muttered; \"and curse their spying!\"    \"We could pick them all off from here,\" said one of the men--a huge,  burly fellow, who had climbed up to a projecting rock commanding an  extensive view. \"All down to the last man.\"    And as he spoke, he brought his gun up to his shoulder with an ominous  gesture.    \"Hold, Toro!\" ejaculated an English voice. \"Your hasty imprudence will  spoil us.\"    \"Bah!\" said Toro, replying in the same tongue. \"You are over prudent,  Hunston. Why should we not destroy them while they are in our power?\"    \"What if one escapes?\"    \"One should not,\" retorted the Italian savagely; \"no, nor half a one.\"    \"And where is the good if we succeeded, as you say?\"    \"Good!\" reiterated Toro, passionately. \"Are they not our sworn foes?  Are they not here in pursuit of us? Good!--why, will it not lessen the  number of our enemies by their number at least?\"    \"Yes, perhaps,\" replied Hunston. \"And if successful, it would so  thoroughly alarm the country, that it would cause a whole army to be  sent after us, and make the end a mere question of time. Let one escape  to tell the tale and it would bring them down to this spot, our safest  place in the mountains, and hitherto undiscovered by our enemies.\"    Toro grumbled.    Yet there was so much truth in what Hunston said that he could urge  nothing further in favour of violent measures.    The sentry, who was still on the watch at the fissure in the rocks,  here turned round and motioned them to silence.    \"Not so loud,\" he exclaimed, in a whisper; \"they can hear something;  they are looking our way.\"    \"Hah!\"    In fact, the military were so near, that they could be heard plainly  enough giving their words of command.    \"Halt! Ground arms!\"    The rattle of their rifles was heard distinctly.    The officer then could be seen taking observations through a short  telescope which he carried suspended by a strap to his side.    He glanced all about the place and fixed for some little time upon the  fissures and rocky passes, resting longer below the very one at which  the sentry was posted than elsewhere.    But although it would seem to have aroused his suspicions, it was  evident that he could see nothing, for, after a few minutes, he lowered  his glass and shut it up.    The reason of this was, that where the sentry stood was completely  shadowed by the overhanging rocks, so that he was invisible to them,  although they could be distinctly seen by the sentry.    The scrutiny appeared to satisfy the officer.    \"Shoulder arms! Left wheel! March!\"    The measured tramp of the soldiers was distinctly heard.    Fainter and fainter it grew until it died away.    The sentry watched them in silence for several minutes before he spoke.    Presently he turned round to his comrades and nodded.    \"Safe,\" he said. \"They have turned by the crossroads; the last man is  out of sight.\"    \"That's prime,\" said our old friend Tomaso. \"Then now to dinner.\"    The sentry was not lost sight of--indeed, he was not the man to allow  himself to be forgotten, for before the meal had been long in progress  he reminded them that he had such a thing as an appetite about him by a  very rough address.    \"Gluttons,\" he said to the party generally, \"do you think only of"]]]
