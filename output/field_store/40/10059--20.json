[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9368"],[0,"Welsh Fairy Tales (#16)"],[1," old friend the harper.\"    Now such a thing as inquiring into each other's ages was not common in  Fairy Land. Very few ever asked such a question, for it was not  thought to be polite. For, though we hear of ugly fairy brats being  put into the cradles, in place of pretty children, no one ever heard,  either of fairies being born or of dying, or having clocks, or  watches, or looking to see what time it was. Nor did doctors, or the  census clerks, or directory people ever trouble the fairy ladies, to  ask their age.    Occasionally, however, there was one fairy, so wise, so learned, and  so able to tell what was going to happen to-morrow, or next year, that  the other fairies looked up to such an one with respect and awe.    Yet these honorables would hardly know what you were talking about, if  you asked any of them how old they might be, or spoke of \"old\" or  \"young.\" If, by any chance, a fairy did use the world \"old\" in talking  of their number, it would be for honor or dignity, and they would mean  it for a compliment.    The fact was, that many of the most lively fairies showed their  frivolous disposition at once. These were of the kind, that, like  kittens, cubs, or babies, wanted to play all the time, yes, every  moment. Already, hundreds of them were tripping from flower to flower,  riding on the backs of fireflies, or harnessing night moths, or any  winged creatures they could saddle, for flight through the air. Or,  they were waltzing with glow worms, or playing \"ring around a rosy,\"  or dancing in circles. They could not keep still, one moment.    In fact, when a great crowd of the frolicsome creatures got singing  together, they made such a noise, that a squad of fairy policemen,  dressed in club moss and armed with pistils, was sent to warn them not  to raise their voices too high; lest the farmers, especially those  that were kind to the fairies, should be awakened, and feel in bad  humor.    So the knot of learned fairies had a quiet time to talk, and, when  able to hear their own words, the harper, who was very learned,  answered their questions about Queen Mab as follows:    \"Well, you know the famous children's story book, in which mortals  read about us, and which they say they enjoy so much, is named  Mabinogion, that is, The Young Folks' Treasury of Cymric Stories.\"    \"It is well named,\" said another fairy savant, \"since Queen Mab is the  only fairy that waits on men. She inspires their dreams, when these  are born in their brains.\"    The talk now turned on Puck, who was to be the president of the  meeting. They were expected to show much dignity in his presence, but  some feared he would, as usual, play his pranks. Before he arrived in  his chariot, which was drawn by dragon flies, some of his neighbors  that lived in the valley near by chatted about him, until the gossip  became quite personal. Just for the fun of it, and the amusement of  the crowd, they wanted Puck to give an exhibition, off-hand, of all  his very varied accomplishments for he could beat all rivals in his  special variety, or as musicians say, his repertoire.    \"No. 'Twould be too much like a Merry Andrew's or a Buffoon's  sideshow, where the freaks of all sorts are gathered, such as they  have at those county fairs, which the mortals get up, to which are  gathered great crowds. The charge of admission is a sixpence. I vote  'no.'\"    \"Well, for the very reason that Puck can beat the rest of us at spells  and transformations, I should like to see him do for us as many stunts  as he can. I've heard from a mortal, named Shakespeare, that, in one  performance, Puck could be a horse, a hound, a hog, a bear without any  head, and even kindle himself into a fire; while his vocal powers, as  we know, are endless. He can neigh, bark, grunt, roar, and even burn  up things. Now, I should like to see the fairy that could beat him at  tricks. It was Puck himself, who told the world that he was in the  habit of doing all these things, and I want to see whether he was  boasting.\"    \"Tut, tut, don't talk that way, about our king,\" said a fourth fairy.    All this was only chaff and fun, for all the fairies were in good  humor. They were only talking, to fill up the interval until the music  began.    Now the canny Welsh fairies had learned the trick of catching  farthings, pennies and sixpences from the folks who have more  curiosity in them than even fairies do. These human beings, cunning  fellows that they are, let the curtain fall on a show, just at the  most interesting part. Then they tell you to come next day and find  out what is to happen. Or, as they say in a story paper, \"to be  continued in our next.\"    Or, worse than all, the story teller stops, at some very exciting  episode, and then passes the hat or collection-box around, to get the  copper or silver of his listeners, before he will go on.    This time, however, it was Puck himself who came forward and declared  that, unless everyone of the fairies would promise to attend the next  meeting, there should be no music. Now a meeting of the Welshery,  whether fairies or human, without music was a thing not to be thought  of. So, although at first some fairies grumbled and held back, and  were quite sulky about it, even muttering other grumpy words, they at  last all agreed, and Puck sent for the fiddler to make music for the  dance.          XVI      KING ARTHUR'S CAVE      In our time, every boy and girl knows about the nuts and blossoms, the  twigs and the hedges, the roots and the leaf of the common hazel bush,  and everybody has heard of the witch hazel. In old days they made use  of the forked branches of the hazel as a divining rod. With this, they  believed that they could divine, or find out the presence of treasures  of gold and silver, deep down in the earth, and hidden from human  eyes.    And, what boy or girl has never played the game, and sung the ditty,  \"London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down,\" even  though nobody now living ever saw it fall?    Now, our story is about a hazel rod, a Welshman on London Bridge,  treasures in a cave, and what happened because of these.    It was in the days when London Bridge was not, as we see it to-day, a  massive structure of stone and iron, able to bear up hundreds of cars,  wagons, horses and people, and lighted at night with electric bulbs.  No, when this Welshman visited London, the bridge had a line of shops  on both sides of the passage way, and reaching from end to end.    Taffy was the name of this fellow from Denbigh, in Wales, and he was a  drover. He had brought, all the way from one of the richest of the  Welsh provinces, a great drove of Black Welsh cattle, such as were in  steady demand by Englishmen, who have always been lovers of roast  beef. Escaping all the risks of cattle thieves, rustlers, and  highwaymen, he had sold his beeves at a good price; so that his  pockets were now fairly bulging out with gold coins, and yet this  fellow wanted more. But first, before going home, he would see the  sights of the great city, which then contained about a hundred  thousand people.    While he was handling some things in a shop, to decide what he should  take home to his wife, his three daughters and his two little boys, he  noticed a man looking intently, not at him, but at his stick. After a  while, the stranger came up to him and asked him where he came from.    Now Taffy was not very refined in his manners, and he thought it none  of the fellow's business. He was very surly and made reply in a gruff  voice.    \"I come from my own country.\"    The stranger did not get angry, but in a polite tone made answer:    \"Don't be offended at my question. Tell me where you cut that hazel  stick, and I'll make it to your advantage, if you will take my  advice.\"    Even yet Taffy was gruff and suspicious.    \"What business is it of yours, where I cut my hazel stick?\" he  answered.    \"Well it may matter a good deal to you, if you will tell me. For, if  you remember the place, and can lead me to it, I'll make you a rich  man, for near that spot lies a great treasure.\"    Taffy was not much of a thinker, apart from matters concerning cattle,  and his brain worked slowly! He was sorely puzzled. Here was a wizard,  who could make him rich, and he did so love to jingle gold in his  pockets. But then he was superstitious. He feared that this sorcerer  derived all his uncanny knowledge from demons, and Taffy, being rather  much of a sinner, feared these very much. Meanwhile, his new  acquaintance kept on persuading him.    Finally Taffy yielded and the two went on together to Wales.    Now in this country, there are many stones placed in position, showing  they were not there by accident, but were reared by men, to mark some  old battle, or famous event. And for this, rough stone work, no  country, unless it be Korea or China, is more famous than Wales.    On reaching one called the Fortress Rock, Taffy pointed to an old  hazel root, and said to his companion:    \"There! From that stock, I cut my hazel stick. I am sure of it.\"    The sorcerer looked at Taffy to read his face, and to be certain that  he was telling the truth. Then he said:    \"Bring shovels and we'll both dig.\"    These having been brought, the two began to work until the  perspiration stood out in drops on their foreheads. First the sod and  rooty stuff, and then down around the gravelly mass below, they plied  their digging tools. Taffy was not used to such toil, and his muscles  were soon weary. But, urged on by visions of gold, he kept bravely at  his task.    At last, when ready to drop from fatigue, he heard his companion say:    \"We've struck it!\"    A few shovelfuls more laid bare a broad flat stone. This they pried  up, but it required all their strength to lift and stand it on edge.  Just below, they saw a flight of steps. They were slippery with wet  and they looked very old, as if worn, ages ago, by many feet passing  up"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9380"],[0,"A Nonsense Anthology (#16)"],[1,"     And half the time she's broke.\"           *       *       *       *       *      That evening on the beach I lay        Behind a lonely dune,    And as she rose above the bay        I buttonholed the Moon.      \"Tell me about that gold,\" said I.        I saw her features fall.    \"You see, it's useless to deny;        The Sun has told me all.\"      \"Sir!\" she exclaimed, \"how _can_ you try        An honest Moon this way?    As for the gold, I put it by        Against a rainy day.\"      I smiled and shook my head. \"All right,        If you _must_ know,\" said she,    \"I change it into silver bright        Wherewith to tip the Sea.\"      \"He is so faithful and so good,        A most deserving case;    If he should leave, I fear it would        Be hard to fill his place.\"           *       *       *       *       *      When asked if they accepted tips,        The waves became so rough;    I thought of those at sea in ships,        And felt I'd said enough.

THE SINGULAR SANGFROID OF BABY BUNTING      Bartholomew Benjamin Bunting        Had only three passions in life,    And one of the trio was hunting,        The others his babe and his wife.    And always, so rigid his habits,        He frolicked at home until two,    And then started hunting for rabbits,        And hunted till fall of the dew.      Belinda Bellonia Bunting,        Thus widowed for half of the day,    Her duty maternal confronting,        With baby would patiently play.    When thus was her energy wasted,        A patented food she'd dispense.    (She had bought it the day that they pasted        The posters all over her fence.)      But Bonaparte Buckingham Bunting,        The infant thus blindly adored,    Replied to her worship by grunting,        Which showed he was brutally bored.    'Twas little he cared for the troubles        Of life. Like a crab on the sands,    From his sweet little mouth he blew bubbles,        And threatened the air with his hands.      Bartholomew Benjamin Bunting        One night, as his wife let him in,    Produced as the fruit of his hunting        A cottontail's velvety skin,    Which, seeing young Bonaparte wriggle,        He gave him without a demur,    And the babe with an aqueous giggle        He swallowed the whole of the fur!      Belinda Bellonia Bunting        Behaved like a consummate loon:    Her offspring in frenzy confronting        She screamed herself mottled maroon:    She felt of his vertebrae spinal,        Expecting he'd surely succumb,    And gave him one vigorous, final,        Hard prod in the pit of his tum.      But Bonaparte Buckingham Bunting,        At first but a trifle perplexed,    By a change in his manner of grunting        Soon showed he was horribly vexed.    He displayed not a sign of repentance        But spoke, in a dignified tone,    The only consecutive sentence        He uttered. 'Twas: \"Lemme alone.\"      The Moral: The parent that uses        Precaution his folly regrets:    An infant gets all that he chooses,        An infant chews all that he gets.      And colics? He constantly has 'em        So long as his food is the best,    But he'll swallow with never a spasm        What ostriches couldn't digest.                              _Guy Wetmore Carryl_.          FAITHLESS NELLY GRAY      Ben Battle was a soldier bold,        And used to war's alarms:    But a cannon-ball took off his legs,        So he laid down his arms!      Now, as they bore him off the field,        Said he, \"Let others shoot,    For here I leave my second leg,        And the Forty-second Foot!\"      The army surgeons made him limbs:        Said he, \"They're only pegs;    But there's as wooden members quite,        As represent my legs!\"      Now Ben he loved a pretty maid,        Her name was Nelly Gray;    So he went to pay her his devours        When he'd devoured his pay!      But when he called on Nelly Gray,        She made him quite a scoff;    And when she saw his wooden legs,        Began to take them off!      \"O Nelly Gray! O Nelly Gray!        Is this your love so warm?    The love that loves a scarlet coat,        Should be more uniform!\"      Said she, \"I loved a soldier once,        For he was blithe and brave;    But I will never have a man        With both legs in the grave!\"      \"Before you had those timber toes,        Your love I did allow,    But then you know, you stand upon        Another footing now!\"      \"O Nelly Gray! O Nelly Gray!        For all your jeering speeches,    At duty's call I left my legs        In Badajos's breaches!\"      \"Why, then,\" said she, \"you've lost the feet        Of legs in war's alarms,    And now you cannot wear your shoes        Upon your feats of arms!\"      \"Oh, false and fickle Nelly Gray;        I know why you refuse:    Though I've no feet--some other man        Is standing in my shoes!\"      \"I wish I ne'er had seen your face;        But now a long farewell!    For you will be my death--alas!        You will not be my Nell!\"      Now, when he went from Nelly Gray,        His heart so heavy got--    And life was such a burden grown,        It made him take a knot!      So round his melancholy neck        A rope he did entwine,    And, for his second time in life        Enlisted in the Line!      One end he tied around a beam,        And then removed his pegs,    And as his legs were off,--of course,        He soon was off his legs!      And there he hung till he was dead        As any nail in town,--    For though distress had cut him up,        It could not cut him down!      A dozen men sat on his corpse,        To find out why he died--    And they buried Ben in four cross-roads,        With a stake in his inside!                              _Thomas Hood_.          THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN      By the side of a murmuring stream an elderly gentleman sat.    On the top of his head was a wig, and a-top of his wig was his hat.      The wind it blew high and blew strong, as the elderly gentleman sat;    And bore from his head in a trice, and plunged in the river his hat.      The gentleman then took his cane which lay by his side as he sat;    And he dropped in the river his wig, in attempting to get out his         hat.      His breast it grew cold with despair, and full in his eye madness         sat;    So he flung in the river his cane to swim with his wig, and his hat.      Cool reflection at last came across while this elderly gentleman         sat;    So he thought he would follow the stream and look for his cane, wig,         and hat.      His head being thicker than common, o'er-balanced the rest of his         fat;    And in plumped this son of a woman to follow his wig, cane, and hat.                              _George Canning_.          MALUM OPUS      Prope ripam fluvii solus        A senex silently sat;    Super capitum ecce his wig,        Et wig super, ecce his hat.      Blew Zephyrus alte, acerbus,        Dum elderly gentleman sat;    Et a capite took up quite torve        Et in rivum projecit his hat.      Tunc soft maledixit the old man,        Tunc stooped from the bank where he sat    Et cum scipio poked in the water,        Conatus servare his hat.      Blew Zephyrus alte, acerbus,        The moment it saw him at that;    Et whisked his novum scratch wig        In flumen, along with his hat.      Ab imo pectore damnavit        In coeruleus eye dolor sat;    Tunc despairingly threw in his cane        Nare cum his wig and his hat.
