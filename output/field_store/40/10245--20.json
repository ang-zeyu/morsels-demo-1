When he learned that I was not  German, but English, he told me they did not say _Anglais_ there, but  _Gaudin_,--I was a _Gaudin_. This he repeated persistently many times,  with an air worthy of General Cyrus Choke, and half convinced me that  there was something in it, and that I might after all be a Gaudin. It  was not till some hours after, that I remembered the indelible  impression made by the piety of speech of recent generations of  Englishmen upon the French nation at large, and thus was enabled to  trace the origin of the name _Gaudin_. The old man evidently believed  that it was the proper thing to call an Englishman by that name; thus  reminding me of a story told of a French soldier in the Austrian service  during the long early wars with Switzerland. The Austrians called the  Swiss, in derision, Kuehmelkers--a term more opprobrious than _bouviers_;  and it is said that, after the battle of Frastens--one of the battles of  the Suabian war,--a Frenchman threw himself at the feet of some Grisons  soldiers, and innocently prayed thus for quarter; '_Tres-chers,  tres-honorables, et tres-dignes Kuehmelkers! au nom de Dieu, ne me tuez  pas_!'    The town of Besancon seems to spend its Sunday in fishing, and is  apparently well contented with that very limited success which is wont  to attend a Frenchman's efforts in this branch of _le sport_. There is a  proverb in the patois of Vaud which says '_Kan on vau dau pesson, se fo  molli_;'[39] and on this the Bisuntians act, standing patiently half-way  up the thigh in the river, as the Swiss on the Lake of Geneva and other  lakes may be seen to do. It is all very well to wade for a good salmon  cast, or to spend some hours in a swift-foot[40] Scotch stream for the  sake of a lively basket of trout; but to stand in a Sunday coat and hat,  and 2-1/2 feet of water, watching a large bung hopelessly unmoved on the  surface, is a thing reserved for a Frenchman indulging in a weekly  intoxication of Sabbatical sport, under the delirious form of the  _chasse aux goujons_.    Clean as the town within the circuit of the river is, the houses which  overhang the water on the other side are picturesque and dirty in the  extreme, story rising above story, and balcony above balcony. It does  not increase their beauty, and to a fastidious nose it must militate  against their eligibility as places of residence, that there is  apparently but one drain, an external one, which follows the course of  the pillars supporting the various balconies: nevertheless, from the  opposite side of the river, and when the wind sets the other way, they  are sufficiently attractive. In this quarter is found the finest church,  the Madeleine, with a very effective piece of sculpture at the east end.  The sculpture is arranged on the bottom and farther side of a sort of  cage, which is hung outside the church, but is visible from the inside  through a corresponding opening in the east wall. The subject of the  sculpture is 'The Sepulchre,' and the ends of the cage or box are  composed of rich yellow glass, through which the external light streams  into the cave of the Sepulchre; and when the church itself is becoming  dark, the effect produced by the light from the evening sky, passing  through the deep-toned glass, and softly illuminating the Sepulchre, is  indescribably solemn.    [Illustration: BATH IN THE DOUBS, AT BESANCON.]    When Besancon was supplied by the aqueduct with the waters of Arcier,  there was a great abundance of baths, as the remains discovered in  digging new foundations show; but in the present state of the town such  things are not easily met with. The floating baths on the river are  appropriated to the other sex, and the only thing approaching to a male  bath was of a nature entirely new to me, being constructed as  follows:--There is a water-mill in the town, with a low weir stretching  across the river, down which the water rushes with no very great  violence. At the foot of this weir a row of sentry-boxes is placed,  approached by planks, and in these boxes the adventurer finds his  bath.[41] A stout piece of wood-work is fixed horizontally along the  face of the weir, and has the effect of throwing the downward water out  of its natural direction, and causing it to describe an arch, so that it  descends with much force on to the weir at a point below the wood-work.  Here two planks are placed, forming a seat and a support for the back,  and a little lower still another plank for the feet to rest upon,  without which the bather would have a good chance of being washed away.  The water boils noisily and violently on all sides and in all  directions, coming down upon the subject's shoulders with a heavy thud,  which calls to mind the tender years when something softer than a cane  was used, and sends him forth like a fresh-boiled lobster. All this,  with towels, is not dear at fourpence.    The citadel is the great sight of Besancon, and the polite  Colonel-commandant attends at his office at convenient hours to give  passes. What it might be to storm the position under the excitement of  the sport of war, I cannot say; but certainly it is a most trying affair  on a hot Sunday's afternoon, even when all is made smooth, and the gates  are opened, by a comprehensive pass. The wall mentioned by Caesar as a  great feature of the place cut the site of the citadel off from the  town, and many signs of it were found when the cathedral of S. Stephen  was built, the unfortunate church which went down before the exigencies  of a siege under Louis XIV. The barrack-master proved to be a most  interesting man, knowing many details of Caesar's life and campaigns  which I suspect were not known to that captain himself. He had served in  Algeria, and assented to the proposition that more soldiers died there  of absinthe than of Arabs, stating his conviction that three-fourths of  the whole deaths are caused by that pernicious extract of wormwood, and  that he ought himself to have died of it long ago. He pointed out the  difference between the massive masonry of the period of the Spanish  occupation and the less impressive work of more recent times, and showed  the dungeon from which Marshal Bourmont bought his escape, in the time  of the first Napoleon.    The floor of one of the little look-out towers is composed of a  tombstone, representing a priest in full ecclesiastical dress, and my  question as to how it came there elicited the following story:--When  Louis XIV. was besieging the citadel, he placed his head-quarters, and a  strong battery, on the summit of the Mont Chaudane,[42] which commands  the citadel on one side as the Bregille does on the other. Among the  besieged was a monk named Schmidt, probably one of the Low-country men  to whom the Franche Comte was then a sort of home, as forming part of  the dominions of Spain; and this monk was the most active supporter of  the defence, against the large party within the walls which was anxious  to render the town. He was also an admirable shot; and on one of the  last days of the siege, as he stood in the little tower where the  tombstone now lies, the King and his staff rode to the front of the  plateau on the Mont Chaudane to survey the citadel; whereupon some one  pointed out to Schmidt that now he had a fair chance of putting an end  at once to the siege and the invasion. Accordingly, he took a musket  from a soldier and aimed at the King; but before firing he changed his  aim, remarking, that he, a priest, ought not to destroy the life of a  man, and so he only killed the horse, giving the Majesty of France a  roll in the mud. When the town was taken, the King enquired for the man  who killed his horse, and asked the priest whether he could have killed  the rider instead, had he wished to do so. 'Certainly,' Schmidt replied,  and related the facts of the case. Louis informed him, that had he been  a soldier, he should have been decorated for his skill and his impulse  of mercy; but, being a priest, he should be hung. The sentence was  carried out, and the priest's body was buried in the floor of the tower  from which he had spared the King's life. If this be true, it was one of  the most unkingly deeds ever done.[43]    This siege took place in the second invasion or conquest of the Franche  Comte by Louis XIV., when Besancon held out for nine days against Vauban  and the King: on the first occasion it had surrendered to Conde after  one day's siege, making the single stipulation that the Holy Shroud  should not be removed from the town.[44] The _Saincte Suaire_ was the  richest ecclesiastical treasure of the Bisuntians, being one of the two  most genuine of the many Suaires, the other being that of Turin, which  was supported by Papal Infallibility. Both were brought from the  Crusades; and the one was presented to Besancon in 1206, the other to  Turin in 1353. Bede tells a story of the proving of a Shroud by fire in  the eighth century, by one of the caliphs; and as its dimensions were 8  feet by 4, like that of Besancon, while the Shroud of Turin measured 12  feet by 3, the people of Besancon claimed that theirs was the one spoken  of by Bede.    The Cathedral of Besancon is no longer S. Stephen, since the destruction  of that church by Louis XIV. The small Church of the Citadel is now  dedicated to that saint, an inscription on the wall stating that it  takes the place of the larger church, _ex urbis obsidio anno 1674  lapsae_, and offering an indulgence of 100 days for every visit paid to  it, with the sensible proviso _una duntaxat vice per diem._ Soldiers not  being generally made of the confessing sex, or of confessing material,  there is only one confessional provided for the 6,000 souls which the  citadel can accommodate.    The Cavalry Barracks are in the lower part of the town, and near them is  a large building with evident traces of ecclesiastical architecture on  the outside. It is, in fact, a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14020"],[0,"The Works of Horace (#17)"],[1," art of language.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE IX.    TO MAECENAS.      When, O happy Maecenas, shall I, overjoyed at Caesar's being victorious,  drink with you under the stately dome (for so it pleases Jove) the  Caecuban reserved for festal entertainments, while the lyre plays a  tune, accompanied with flutes, that in the Doric, these in the Phrygian  measure? As lately, when the Neptunian admiral, driven from the sea,  and his navy burned, fled, after having menaced those chains to Rome,  which, like a friend, he had taken off from perfidious slaves. The Roman  soldiers (alas! ye, our posterity, will deny the fact), enslaved to a  woman, carry palisadoes and arms, and can be subservient to haggard  eunuchs; and among the military standards, oh shame! the sun beholds an  [Egyptian] canopy. Indignant at this the Gauls turned two thousand of  their cavalry, proclaiming Caesar; and the ships of the hostile navy,  going off to the left, lie by in port. Hail, god of triumph! Dost thou  delay the golden chariots and untouched heifers? Hail, god of triumph!  You neither brought back a general equal [to Caesar] from the Jugurthine  war; nor from the African [war, him], whose valor raised him a monument  over Carthage. Our enemy, overthrown both by land and sea, has changed  his purple vestments for mourning. He either seeks Crete, famous for her  hundred cities, ready to sail with unfavorable winds; or the Syrtes,  harassed by the south; or else is driven by the uncertain sea. Bring  hither, boy, larger bowls, and the Chian or Lesbian wine; or, what may  correct this rising qualm of mine, fill me out the Caecuban. It is my  pleasure to dissipate care and anxiety for Caesar's danger with  delicious wine.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE X.    AGAINST MAEVIUS.      The vessel that carries the loathsome Maevius, makes her departure under  an unlucky omen. Be mindful, O south wind, that you buffet it about with  horrible billows. May the gloomy east, turning up the sea, disperse its  cables and broken oars. Let the north arise as mighty as when be rives  the quivering oaks on the lofty mountains; nor let a friendly star  appear through the murky night, in which the baleful Orion sets: nor let  him be conveyed in a calmer sea, than was the Grecian band of  conquerors, when Pallas turned her rage from burned Troy to the ship of  impious Ajax. Oh what a sweat is coming upon your sailors, and what a  sallow paleness upon you, and that effeminate wailing, and those prayers  to unregarding Jupiter; when the Ionian bay, roaring with the  tempestuous south-west, shall break your keel. But if, extended along  the winding shore, you shall delight the cormorants as a dainty prey, a  lascivious he-goat and an ewe-lamb shall be sacrificed to the Tempests.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XI.    TO PECTIUS.      It by no means, O Pectius, delights me as heretofore to write Lyric  verses, being smitten with cruel love: with love, who takes pleasure to  inflame me beyond others, either youths or maidens. This is the third  December that has shaken the [leafy] honors from the woods, since I  ceased to be mad for Inachia. Ah me! (for I am ashamed of so great a  misfortune) what a subject of talk was I throughout the city! I repent  too of the entertainments, at which both a languishing and silence and  sighs, heaved from the bottom of my breast, discovered the lover. As  soon as the indelicate god [Bacchus] by the glowing wine had removed, as  I grew warm, the secrets of [my heart] from their repository, I made my  complaints, lamenting to you, \"Has the fairest genius of a poor man no  weight against wealthy lucre? Wherefore, if a generous indignation boil  in my breast, insomuch as to disperse to the winds these disagreeable  applications, that give no ease to the desperate wound; the shame [of  being overcome] ending, shall cease to contest with rivals of such a  sort.\" When I, with great gravity, had applauded these resolutions in  your presence, being ordered to go home, I was carried with a wandering  foot to posts, alas! to me not friendly, and alas! obdurate gates,  against which I bruised my loins and side. Now my affections for the  delicate Lyciscus engross all my time; from them neither the unreserved  admonitions, nor the serious reprehensions of other friends can recall  me [to my former taste for poetry]; but, perhaps, either a new flame for  some fair damsel, or for some graceful youth who binds his long hair in  a knot, [may do so].           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XII.    TO A WOMAN WHOSE CHARMS WERE OVER.      What would you be at, you woman fitter for the swarthy monsters? Why do  you send tokens, why billet-doux to me, and not to some vigorous youth,  and of a taste not nice? For I am one who discerns a polypus, or fetid  ramminess, however concealed, more quickly than the keenest dog the  covert of the boar. What sweatiness, and how rank an odor every where  rises from her withered limbs! when she strives to lay her furious rage  with impossibilities; now she has no longer the advantage of moist  cosmetics, and her color appears as if stained with crocodile's ordure;  and now, in wild impetuosity, she tears her bed, bedding, and all she  has. She attacks even my loathings in the most angry terms:--\"You are  always less dull with Inachia than me: in her company you are threefold  complaisance; but you are ever unprepared to oblige me in a single  instance. Lesbia, who first recommended you--so unfit a help in time of  need--may she come to an ill end! when Coan Amyntas paid me his  addresses; who is ever as constant in his fair one's service, as the  young tree to the hill it grows on. For whom were labored the fleeces of  the richest Tyrian dye? For you? Even so that there was not one in  company, among gentlemen of your own rank, whom his own wife admired  preferably to you: oh, unhappy me, whom you fly, as the lamb dreads the  fierce wolves, or the she-goats the lions!\"           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XIII.    TO A FRIEND.      A horrible tempest has condensed the sky, and showers and snows bring  down the atmosphere: now the sea, now the woods bellow with the Thracian  North wind. Let us, my friends, take occasion from the day; and while  our knees are vigorous, and it becomes us, let old age with his  contracted forehead become smooth. Do you produce the wine, that was  pressed in the consulship of my Torquatus. Forbear to talk of any other  matters. The deity, perhaps, will reduce these [present evils], to your  former [happy] state by a propitious change. Now it is fitting both to  be bedewed with Persian perfume, and to relieve our breasts of dire  vexations by the lyre, sacred to Mercury. Like as the noble Centaur,  [Chiron,] sung to his mighty pupil: \"Invincible mortal, son of the  goddess Thetis, the land of Assaracus awaits you, which the cold  currents of little Scamander and swift-gliding Simois divide: whence the  fatal sisters have broken off your return, by a thread that cannot be  altered: nor shall your azure mother convey you back to your home. There  [then] by wine and music, sweet consolations, drive away every symptom  of hideous melancholy.\"           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XIV.    TO MAECENAS.      You kill me, my courteous Maecenas, by frequently inquiring, why a  soothing indolence has diffused as great a degree of forgetfulness on my  inmost senses, as if I had imbibed with a thirsty throat the cups that  bring on Lethean slumbers. For the god, the god prohibits me from  bringing to a conclusion the verses I promised [you, namely those]  iambics which I had begun. In the same manner they report that Anacreon  of Teios burned for the Samian Bathyllus; who often lamented his love to  an inaccurate measure on a hollow lyre. You are violently in love  yourself; but if a fairer flame did not burn besieged Troy, rejoice in  your lot. Phryne, a freed-woman, and not content with a single admirer,  consumes me.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XV.    TO NEAERA.      It was night, and the moon shone in a serene sky among the lesser stars;  when you, about to violate the divinity of the great gods, swore [to be  true] to my requests, embracing me with your pliant arms more closely  than the lofty oak is clasped by the ivy; that while the wolf should  remain an enemy to the flock, and Orion, unpropitious to the sailors,  should trouble the wintery sea, and while the air should fan the  unshorn locks of Apollo, [so long you vowed] that this love should be  mutual. O Neaera, who shall one day greatly grieve on account of my  merit: for, if there is any thing of manhood in Horace, he will not  endure that you should dedicate your nights continually to another, whom  you prefer; and exasperated, he will look out for one who will return  his love; and though an unfeigned sorrow should take possession of you,  yet my firmness shall not give way to that beauty which has once given  me disgust. But as for you, whoever you be who are more successful [than  me], and now strut proud of my misfortune; though you be rich in flocks  and abundance of land, and Pactolus flow for you, nor the mysteries of  Pythagoras, born again, escape you, and you excel Nireus in beauty;  alas! you shall [hereafter] bewail her love transferred elsewhere; but I  shall laugh in my turn.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XVI.    TO THE ROMAN PEOPLE.      Now is another age worn away by civil wars, and Rome herself falls by  her own strength. Whom neither the bordering Marsi could destroy, nor  the Etrurian band of the menacing Porsena, nor the rival valor of Capua,  nor the bold Spartacus, and the Gauls perfideous with their innovations;  nor did the fierce Germany subdue with its blue-eyed youth, nor Annibal,  detested by parents; but we, an impious race,"]]]
