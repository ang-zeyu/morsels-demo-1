The rent of a house, it has been said, should not exceed one-eighth of  the whole income of its occupier; and, as a general rule, we are  disposed to assent to this estimate, although there may be many  circumstances which would not admit of its being considered infallible.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER II.      THE HOUSEKEEPER.    55. AS SECOND IN COMMAND IN THE HOUSE, except in large establishments,  where there is a house steward, the housekeeper must consider herself as  the immediate representative of her mistress, and bring, to the  management of the household, all those qualities of honesty, industry,  and vigilance, in the same degree as if she were at the head of her  _own_ family. Constantly on the watch to detect any wrong-doing on the  part of any of the domestics, she will overlook all that goes on in the  house, and will see that every department is thoroughly attended to, and  that the servants are comfortable, at the same time that their various  duties are properly performed.        Cleanliness, punctuality, order, and method, are essentials in      the character of a good housekeeper. Without the first, no      household can be said to be well managed. The second is equally      all-important; for those who are under the housekeeper will take      their \"cue\" from her; and in the same proportion as punctuality      governs her movements, so will it theirs. Order, again, is      indispensable; for by it we wish to be understood that \"there      should be a place for everything, and everything in its place.\"      Method, too, is most necessary; for when the work is properly      contrived, and each part arranged in regular succession, it will      be done more quickly and more effectually.    56. A NECESSARY QUALIFICATION FOR A HOUSEKEEPER is, that she should  thoroughly understand accounts. She will have to write in her books an  accurate registry of all sums paid for any and every purpose, all the  current expenses of the house, tradesmen's bills, and other extraneous  matter. As we have mentioned under the head of the Mistress (_see_ 16),  a housekeeper's accounts should be periodically balanced, and examined  by the head of the house. Nothing tends more to the satisfaction of both  employer and employed, than this arrangement. \"Short reckonings make  long friends,\" stands good in this case, as in others.        It will be found an excellent plan to take an account of every      article which comes into the house connected with housekeeping,      and is not paid for at the time. The book containing these      entries can then be compared with the bills sent in by the      various tradesmen, so that any discrepancy can be inquired into      and set right. An intelligent housekeeper will, by this means,      too, be better able to judge of the average consumption of each      article by the household; and if that quantity be, at any time,      exceeded, the cause may be discovered and rectified, if it      proceed from waste or carelessness.    57. ALTHOUGH IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE COOK, the housekeeper does not  generally much interfere, yet it is necessary that she should possess a  good knowledge of the culinary art, as, in many instances, it may be  requisite for her to take the superintendence of the kitchen. As a rule,  it may be stated, that the housekeeper, in those establishments where  there is no house steward or man cook, undertakes the preparation of the  confectionary, attends to the preserving and pickling of fruits and  vegetables; and, in a general way, to the more difficult branches of the  art of cookery.        Much of these arrangements will depend, however, on the      qualifications of the cook; for instance, if she be an able      artiste, there will be but little necessity for the housekeeper      to interfere, except in the already noticed articles of      confectionary, &c. On the contrary, if the cook be not so clever      an adept in her art, then it will be requisite for the      housekeeper to give more of her attention to the business of the      kitchen, than in the former case. It will be one of the duties      of the housekeeper to attend to the marketing, in the absence of      either a house steward or man cook.    58. THE DAILY DUTIES OF A HOUSEKEEPER are regulated, in a great measure,  by the extent of the establishment she superintends. She should,  however, rise early, and see that all the domestics are duly performing  their work, and that everything is progressing satisfactorily for the  preparation of the breakfast for the household and family. After  breakfast, which, in large establishments, she will take in the  \"housekeeper's room\" with the lady's-maid, butler, and valet, and where  they will be waited on by the still-room maid, she will, on various days  set apart for each purpose, carefully examine the household linen, with  a view to its being repaired, or to a further quantity being put in hand  to be made; she will also see that the furniture throughout the house is  well rubbed and polished; and will, besides, attend to all the necessary  details of marketing and ordering goods from the tradesmen.        The housekeeper's room is generally made use of by the      lady's-maid, butler, and valet, who take there their breakfast,      tea, and supper. The lady's-maid will also use this apartment as      a sitting-room, when not engaged with her lady, or with some      other duties, which would call her elsewhere. In different      establishments, according to their size and the rank of the      family, different rules of course prevail. For instance, in the      mansions of those of very high rank, and where there is a house      steward, there are two distinct tables kept, one in the      steward's room for the principal members of the household, the      other in the servants' hall, for the other domestics. At the      steward's dinner-table, the steward and housekeeper preside; and      here, also, are present the lady's-maid, butler, valet, and head      gardener. Should any visitors be staying with the family, their      servants, generally the valet and lady's-maid, will be admitted      to the steward's table.    59. AFTER DINNER, the housekeeper, having seen that all the members of  the establishment have regularly returned to their various duties, and  that all the departments of the household are in proper working order,  will have many important matters claiming her attention. She will,  possibly, have to give the finishing touch to some article of  confectionary, or be occupied with some of the more elaborate processes  of the still-room. There may also be the dessert to arrange, ice-creams  to make; and all these employments call for no ordinary degree of care,  taste, and attention.        The still-room was formerly much more in vogue than at present;      for in days of \"auld lang syne,\" the still was in constant      requisition for the supply of sweet-flavoured waters for the      purposes of cookery, scents and aromatic substances used in the      preparation of the toilet, and cordials in cases of accidents      and illness. There are some establishments, however, in which      distillation is still carried on, and in these, the still-room      maid has her old duties to perform. In a general way, however,      this domestic is immediately concerned with the housekeeper. For      the latter she lights the fire, dusts her room, prepares the      breakfast-table, and waits at the different meals taken in the      housekeeper's room (_see_ 58). A still-room maid may learn a      very great deal of useful knowledge from her intimate connection      with the housekeeper, and if she be active and intelligent, may      soon fit herself for a better position in the household.    60. IN THE EVENING, the housekeeper will often busy herself with the  necessary preparations for the next day's duties. Numberless small, but  still important arrangements, will have to be made, so that everything  may move smoothly. At times, perhaps, attention will have to be paid to  the breaking of lump-sugar, the stoning of raisins, the washing,  cleansing, and drying of currants, &c. The evening, too, is the best  time for setting right her account of the expenditure, and duly writing  a statement of moneys received and paid, and also for making memoranda  of any articles she may require for her storeroom or other departments.        Periodically, at some convenient time,--for instance, quarterly      or half-yearly, it is a good plan for the housekeeper to make an      inventory of everything she has under her care, and compare this      with the lists of a former period; she will then be able to      furnish a statement, if necessary, of the articles which, on      account of time, breakage, loss, or other causes, it has been      necessary to replace or replenish.    61. IN CONCLUDING THESE REMARKS on the duties of the housekeeper, we  will briefly refer to the very great responsibility which attaches to  her position. Like \"Caesar's wife,\" she should be \"above suspicion,\" and  her honesty and sobriety unquestionable; for there are many temptations  to which she is exposed. In a physical point of view, a housekeeper  should be healthy and strong, and be particularly clean in her person,  and her hands, although they may show a degree of roughness, from the  nature of some of her employments, yet should have a nice inviting  appearance. In her dealings with the various tradesmen, and in her  behaviour to the domestics under her, the demeanour and conduct of the  housekeeper should be such as, in neither case, to diminish, by an undue  familiarity, her authority or influence.    _Note_.--It will be useful for the mistress and housekeeper to know the  best seasons for various occupations connected with Household  Management; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10148"],[0,"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (#17)"],[1,"up, and all looked at Robin  Hood, for each man knew that Little John spake of a certain fight that  happened between their master and himself, through which they first  became acquainted.    \"Nay,\" quoth Robin Hood, laughing louder than all.  \"Heaven forbid that  I should doubt thee, for I care for no taste of thy staff myself, Little  John.  I must needs own that there are those of my band can handle a  seven-foot staff more deftly than I; yet no man in all Nottinghamshire  can draw gray goose shaft with my fingers. Nevertheless, a journey to  Ancaster may not be ill for thee; so go thou, as I bid, and thou hadst  best go this very evening, for since thou hast abided at the Sheriff's  many know thy face, and if thou goest in broad daylight, thou mayst get  thyself into a coil with some of his worship's men-at-arms. Bide thou  here till I bring thee money to pay our good Hugh.  I warrant he hath no  better customers in all Nottinghamshire than we.\" So saying, Robin left  them and entered the forest.    Not far from the trysting tree was a great rock in which a chamber had  been hewn, the entrance being barred by a massive oaken door two palms'-  breadth in thickness, studded about with spikes, and fastened with a  great padlock. This was the treasure house of the band, and thither  Robin Hood went and, unlocking the door, entered the chamber, from which  he brought forth a bag of gold which he gave to Little John, to pay Hugh  Longshanks withal, for the cloth of Lincoln green.    Then up got Little John, and, taking the bag of gold, which he thrust  into his bosom, he strapped a girdle about his loins, took a stout  pikestaff full seven feet long in his hand, and set forth upon his  journey.    So he strode whistling along the leafy forest path that led to Fosse  Way, turning neither to the right hand nor the left, until at last he  came to where the path branched, leading on the one hand onward to Fosse  Way, and on the other, as well Little John knew, to the merry Blue Boar  Inn.  Here Little John suddenly ceased whistling and stopped in the  middle of the path. First he looked up and then he looked down, and  then, tilting his cap over one eye, he slowly scratched the back part of  his head. For thus it was:  at the sight of these two roads, two voices  began to alarum within him, the one crying, \"There lies the road to the  Blue Boar Inn, a can of brown October, and a merry night with sweet  companions such as thou mayst find there\"; the other, \"There lies the  way to Ancaster and the duty thou art sent upon.\" Now the first of these  two voices was far the louder, for Little John had grown passing fond of  good living through abiding at the Sheriff's house; so, presently,  looking up into the blue sky, across which bright clouds were sailing  like silver boats, and swallows skimming in circling flight, quoth he,  \"I fear me it will rain this evening, so I'll e'en stop at the Blue Boar  till it passes by, for I know my good master would not have me wet to  the skin.\"  So, without more ado, off he strode down the path that lay  the way of his likings. Now there was no sign of any foul weather, but  when one wishes to do a thing, as Little John did, one finds no lack of  reasons for the doing.    Four merry wags were at the Blue Boar Inn; a butcher, a beggar, and two  barefoot friars.  Little John heard them singing from afar, as he walked  through the hush of the mellow twilight that was now falling over hill  and dale.  Right glad were they to welcome such a merry blade as Little  John.  Fresh cans of ale were brought, and with jest and song and merry  tales the hours slipped away on fleeting wings. None thought of time or  tide till the night was so far gone that Little John put by the thought  of setting forth upon his journey again that night, and so bided at the  Blue Boar Inn until the morrow.    Now it was an ill piece of luck for Little John that he left his duty  for his pleasure, and he paid a great score for it, as we are all apt to  do in the same case, as you shall see.    Up he rose at the dawn of the next day, and, taking his stout pikestaff  in his hand, he set forth upon his journey once more, as though he would  make up for lost time.    In the good town of Blyth there lived a stout tanner, celebrated far and  near for feats of strength and many tough bouts at wrestling and the  quarterstaff. For five years he had held the mid-country champion belt  for wrestling, till the great Adam o' Lincoln cast him in the ring and  broke one of his ribs; but at quarterstaff he had never yet met his  match in all the country about. Besides all this, he dearly loved the  longbow, and a sly jaunt in the forest when the moon was full and the  dun deer in season; so that the King's rangers kept a shrewd eye upon  him and his doings, for Arthur a Bland's house was apt to have aplenty  of meat in it that was more like venison than the law allowed.    Now Arthur had been to Nottingham Town the day before Little John set  forth on his errand, there to sell a halfscore of tanned cowhides. At  the dawn of the same day that Little John left the inn, he started from  Nottingham, homeward for Blyth.  His way led, all in the dewy morn, past  the verge of Sherwood Forest, where the birds were welcoming the lovely  day with a great and merry jubilee. Across the Tanner's shoulders was  slung his stout quarterstaff, ever near enough to him to be gripped  quickly, and on his head was a cap of doubled cowhide, so tough that it  could hardly be cloven even by a broadsword.    \"Now,\" quoth Arthur a Bland to himself, when he had come to that part of  the road that cut through a corner of the forest, \"no doubt at this time  of year the dun deer are coming from the forest depths nigher to the  open meadow lands. Mayhap I may chance to catch a sight of the dainty  brown darlings thus early in the morn.\"  For there was nothing he loved  better than to look upon a tripping herd of deer, even when he could not  tickle their ribs with a clothyard shaft. Accordingly, quitting the  path, he went peeping this way and that through the underbrush, spying  now here and now there, with all the wiles of a master of woodcraft, and  of one who had more than once donned a doublet of Lincoln green.    Now as Little John stepped blithely along, thinking of nothing but of  such things as the sweetness of the hawthorn buds that bedecked the  hedgerows, or gazing upward at the lark, that, springing from the dewy  grass, hung aloft on quivering wings in the yellow sunlight, pouring  forth its song that fell like a falling star from the sky, his luck led  him away from the highway, not far from the spot where Arthur a Bland  was peeping this way and that through the leaves of the thickets.  Hearing a rustling of the branches, Little John stopped and presently  caught sight of the brown cowhide cap of the Tanner moving among the  bushes.    \"I do much wonder,\" quoth Little John to himself, \"what yon knave is  after, that he should go thus peeping and peering about I verily believe  that yon scurvy varlet is no better than a thief, and cometh here after  our own and the good King's dun deer.\" For by much roving in the forest,  Little John had come to look upon all the deer in Sherwood as belonging  to Robin Hood and his band as much as to good King Harry.  \"Nay,\" quoth  he again, after a time, \"this matter must e'en be looked into.\"  So,  quitting the highroad, he also entered the thickets, and began spying  around after stout Arthur a Bland.    So for a long time they both of them went hunting about, Little John  after the Tanner, and the Tanner after the deer. At last Little John  trod upon a stick, which snapped under his foot, whereupon, hearing the  noise, the Tanner turned quickly and caught sight of the yeoman.  Seeing  that the Tanner had spied him out, Little John put a bold face upon the  matter.    \"Hilloa,\" quoth he, \"what art thou doing here, thou naughty fellow? Who  art thou that comest ranging Sherwood's paths? In very sooth thou hast  an evil cast of countenance, and I do think, truly, that thou art no  better than a thief, and comest after our good King's deer.\"    \"Nay,\" quoth the Tanner boldly--for, though taken by surprise, he was  not a man to be frightened by big words--\"thou liest in thy teeth. I am  no thief, but an honest craftsman.  As for my countenance, it is what it  is; and, for the matter of that, thine own is none too pretty, thou  saucy fellow.\"    \"Ha!\" quoth Little John in a great loud voice, \"wouldst thou give me  backtalk?  Now I have a great part of a mind to crack thy pate for thee.  I would have thee know, fellow, that I am, as it were, one of the King's  foresters.  Leastwise,\" muttered he to himself, \"I and my friends do  take good care of our good sovereign's deer.\"    \"I care not who thou art,\" answered the bold Tanner, \"and unless thou  hast many more of thy kind by thee, thou canst never make Arthur a Bland  cry 'A mercy.'\"    \"Is it so?\" cried Little John in a rage.  \"Now, by my faith, thou saucy  rogue, thy tongue hath led thee into a pit thou wilt have a sorry time  getting out of; for I will give thee such a drubbing as ne'er hast thou  had in all thy life before. Take thy staff in thy hand, fellow, for I  will not smite an unarmed man.    \"Marry come up with a murrain!\" cried the Tanner, for he, too, had  talked himself into a fume.  \"Big words ne'er killed so much as a mouse.  Who art thou that talkest so freely of cracking the head of Arthur a  Bland?  If I do not tan thy hide this day as ne'er I tanned a calf's  hide in all my life before, split my staff into skewers for lamb's flesh  and call me no more brave man! Now look to thyself, fellow!\"    \"Stay!\" said Little John.  \"Let us first measure our cudgels. I do  reckon my staff longer than thine, and I would not take vantage of thee  by even so much as an inch.\"    \"Nay, I pass not for length,\" answered the Tanner.  \"My staff is long"]]]
