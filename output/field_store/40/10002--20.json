In  vain the midshipmen and their followers fought desperately. Harry was  felled by a blow with a war club, Dick cut down with a kris; half the  seamen were killed, the others jumped overboard and swam back to their  vessel. Lieutenant Hopkins shouted to the men to take to the boats, and  the two cutters were speedily manned. One, however, was in a sinking  condition; but Lieutenant Hopkins with the other started in pursuit of  the prahu, whose crew had already got their oars out, and in spite of  the efforts of the sailors, soon left them behind. Pursuit was evidently  hopeless, and reluctantly the lieutenant ordered the men to row back. On  returning to the scene of combat, they saw sunk near the bank the  fourth of the prahus. \"The spy was so far right,\" the second lieutenant  muttered--\"this fellow did sink; now we must see that she does no more  mischief.\" He brought the captured prahu alongside the others, whose  decks were but a foot or two below the water, and fired several shots  through their bottoms. Then he set the captured craft on fire and took  to the boats, which with great difficulty forced their way under the  fallen tree and rowed back to the ship.    The third lieutenant had been shot dead, twelve men had been killed,  ten of the midshipmen's party were missing, and of the rest but few had  escaped without wounds more or less serious.    Harry was the first to recover his senses, being roughly brought to by  a bucket of water being dashed over him. He looked round the deck. Of  those who had sprung on board with him, none were visible save Dick  Balderson, who was lying near him, with a cloth tightly bound round his  shoulder.    As he rose into a sitting position a murmur of satisfaction broke from  some Malays standing near. It was some time before he could rally his  senses.    \"I suppose,\" he thought at last, \"they are either keeping us for torture  or as hostages. The rajah may have given orders that any officers  captured were to be spared and brought to him. I don't know what his  expectations are,\" he muttered to himself; \"but if he expects to be  reinstated as rajah, and perhaps compensated for the loss of his palace,  he is likely to be mistaken; and in that case it will go mighty hard  with us, for there is no shadow of doubt that he is a savage and cruel  brute.\"    He had now shaken off the numbness caused by the blow that he had  received, and he managed to stagger to where Dick was lying, and knelt  beside him and begged the Malays to bring water. They had evidently  received orders to do all they could to revive the two young officers,  and one at once brought half a gourd full. Harry had already assured  himself that his friend's heart still beat. He began by pouring some  water between his lips. It was not necessary to pour any over his head,  for he had already received the same treatment as himself.    \"Dick, old chap,\" he said sharply and earnestly.    The sound was evidently heard and understood, for Dick started slightly,  opened his eyes and murmured, \"It's not time to turn out yet?\"    \"You are not in your hammock, Dick; you have been wounded, and we are  both prisoners in the hands of these Malays. Try and pull yourself  together, but don't move; they have put a sort of bandage round your  shoulder, and I am going to try and improve it.\"    \"What is the matter with my shoulder?\" Dick murmured.    \"Chopped with a kris, old man. Now I am going to turn you on your side,  and then cut the sleeve off the jacket. Take another drink of water;  then we will set about it.\"    Dick did as he was ordered, and was evidently coming back to  consciousness, for he looked round, and then said, \"Where are the other  fellows?\"    \"I don't know what has become of them. I think I went down before you  did. However, here we are alone. Now I am going to begin.\"    He cut off the sleeve of the jacket and shirt at the shoulder, ripped  open the seam to the neck, first taking off the rough bandage.    \"It's a nasty cut, old man,\" he said, \"but nothing dangerous, I should  say. I fancy it has gone clean through the shoulder bone, and there is  no doubt that it will knit again, as Hassan's did, if they do but give  you time.\"    He rolled the shirt sleeve into a pad, saturated it with water, and laid  it on the wound.    \"You see I know all about it, Dick,\" he said cheerily, \"from having  watched the doctor at work on Hassan. Now I will tear this cloth into  strips.\"    He first placed a strip of the cloth over the shoulder, crossed it under  the arm, and then took the ends of the bandage across the chest and  back, and tied them under his other arm. He repeated this process with  half a dozen other strips; then he placed Dick's hand upon his chest,  tied some of the other strips together, and bound them tightly round the  arm and body, so that no movement of the limb was possible. One of the  Malay's knelt down and gave him his assistance, and nodded approvingly  when he had finished; then he helped Harry raise him into a sitting  position against the bulwark.    \"That is better,\" Dick said, \"as far as it goes. How was it these  fellows did not kill us at once?\"    \"I expect the rajah has ordered that all officers who may fall into  their hands are to be kept as hostages, so that he can open negotiations  with the skipper. If he gets what he wants, he hands us back; if not,  there is no manner of doubt that he will put us out of the way without  compunction.\"    The men were still working at the oars, and for four hours rowed without  intermission through a labyrinth of creeks. At last they stopped before  a small village, tied the prahu up to a tree, and then the man who  seemed to be the captain went ashore with two or three others. The lads  heard a loud outburst of anger, and a voice which they recognized as  that of the rajah storming and raging for some time; then the hubbub  ceased. An hour later the rajah himself came on board with two or three  attendants, and a man whom they recognized as speaking a certain amount  of English. The rajah scowled at them, and from the manner in which he  kept fingering his kris they saw that it needed a great effort on his  part to abstain from killing them at once. He spoke for some time in his  own language, and the interpreter translated it.    \"You are dogs--you and all your countrymen. The rajah is sending a  message to your captain to tell him that he must build up his palace  again, pay him for the warships that he has destroyed, and provide him  with a guard against his enemies until a fresh fleet has been built. If  he refuses to do this, you will both be killed.\"    \"Tell him,\" Harry said, \"that if we are dogs, anyhow we have shown him  that we can bite. As to what he says, it is for the captain to answer;  but I do not think that he will grant the terms, though possibly he may  consent to spare the rajah's life, and to go away with his ship, if we  are sent back to him without injury.\"    The rajah uttered a scornful exclamation. \"I have six thousand men,\"  he said, \"and I do not need to beg my life; for were there twenty ships  instead of one they could never find me, and not a man who landed and  tried to come through the country would return alive. I have given your  captain the chance. If, at the end of three days, an answer does not  come granting my command, you will be krised. Keep a strict watch upon  them, Captain, and kill them at once if they try to escape.\"    \"I will guard them safely, Rajah,\" the captain, who, from the rich  materials of his sarong and jacket, was evidently himself a chief, said  quietly; \"but as to escape, where could they go? They could but wander  in the jungle until they died.\"    By night both lads felt more themselves. They had been well supplied  with food, and though Harry's head ached until, as he said, it was  splitting, and Dick's wound smarted severely, they were able to discuss  their position. They at once agreed that escape was impossible, and  would be even were they well and strong and could manage to obtain  possession of a sampan, for they would but lose themselves in the  labyrinth of creeks, and would, moreover, be certain to be overtaken by  the native boats that would be sent off in all directions after them.    \"There is nothing to do but to wait for the captain's answer,\" Dick said  at last.    \"We know what that will be,\" Harry said. \"He will tell the chief that it  would be impossible for him to grant his commands, but that he is ready  to pay a certain sum for our release; that if harm comes to us, he  will make peace with the chiefs who have assisted Sehi against us, on  condition of their hunting him down and sending him alive or dead to the  ships. But the rascal knows that he could hide himself in these swamps  for a month, and he will proceed to chop off our heads without a  moment's delay. We must keep our eyes open tomorrow, and endeavor to get  hold of a couple of weapons. It is a deal better to die fighting than it  is to have our throats cut like sheep.\"        CHAPTER X.      The next two days passed quietly. The lads were both a great deal  better, and agreed that if--which would almost certainly not be the  case--a means of escape should present itself, they would seize the  chance, however hopeless it might be, for that at worst they could but  be cut down in attempting it. No chance, however, presented itself.  Two Malays always squatted near them, and their eyes followed every  movement.    \"Some time tomorrow the messenger will return,\" Harry said. \"It is clear  to me that our only chance is to escape before morning. Those fellows  will be watchful till the night is nearly over. Now, I propose that,  just before the first gleam of daylight, we throw ourselves upon them  suddenly, seize their krises, and cut them down, then leap on shore,  and dash into the jungle.

To those with whom I am in sympathy in this matter, who love to listen  to and are yearly invigorated by the skylark's music, and whose souls  are yearly sickened at the slaughter of their loved songsters, I would  humbly suggest that there is a simpler, more practical means of ending  this dispute, which has surely lasted long enough. It goes without  saying that this bird's music is eminently pleasing to most persons,  that even as the sunshine is sweet and pleasant to behold, its silvery  aerial sounds rained down so abundantly from heaven are delightful and  exhilarating to all of us, or at all events, to so large a majority that  the minority are not entitled to consideration. One person in five  thousand, or perhaps in ten thousand, might be found to say that the  lark singing in blue heaven affords him no pleasure. This being so, and  ours being a democratic country in which the will or desire of the many  is or may be made the law of the land, it is surely only right and  reasonable that lovers of lark's flesh should be prevented from  gratifying their taste at the cost of the destruction of so loved a  bird, that they should be made to content themselves with woodcock, and  snipe on toast, and golden plover, and grouse and blackcock, and any  other bird of delicate flavor which does not, living, appeal so strongly  to the aesthetic feelings in us and is not so universal a favourite.    This, too, will doubtless come in time. Speaking for myself, and going  back to the former subject, little as I like to see men feeding on  larks, rather would I see larks killed and eaten than thrust into cages.  For in captivity they do not \"sweeten\" my life, as the Maidenhead  guidebook writer would say, with their shrill, piercing cries for  liberty, but they \"sing me mad.\" Just as in some minds this bird's  music--a sound which above all others typifies the exuberant life and  joy of nature to the soul--cannot be separated from the cooked and  dished-up melodist, so that they turn with horror from such meat, so I  cannot separate this bird, nor any bird, from the bird's wild life of  liberty, and the marvellous faculty of flight which is the bird's  attribute. To see so wild and aerial a creature in a cage jars my whole  system, and is a sight hateful and unnatural, an outrage on our  universal mother.    This feeling about birds in captivity, which I have attempted to  describe, and which, I repeat, is not sentimentality, as that word is  ordinarily understood, has been so vividly rendered in an ode to \"The  Skylarks\" by Sir Rennell Rodd, that the reader will probably feel  grateful to me for quoting a portion of it in this place, especially as  the volume in which it appears--_Feda, with Other Poems_--is, I imagine,  not very widely known:        \"Oh, the sky, the sky, the open sky,      For the home of a song-bird's heart!      And why, and why, and for ever why,      Do they stifle here in the mart:      Cages of agony, rows on rows,      Torture that only a wild thing knows:      Is it nothing to you to see      That head thrust out through the hopeless wire,      And the tiny life, and the mad desire      To be free, to be free, to be free?      Oh, the sky, the sky, the blue, wide sky,      For the beat of a song-bird's wings!        * * *        Straight and close are the cramping bars      From the dawn of mist to the chill of stars,      And yet it must sing or die!      Will its marred harsh voice in the city street      Make any heart of you glad?      It will only beat with its wings and beat,      It will only sing you mad.        * * *        If it does not go to your heart to see      The helpless pity of those bruised wings,      The tireless effort to which it clings      To the strain and the will to be free,      I know not how I shall set in words      The meaning of God in this,      For the loveliest thing in this world of His      Are the ways and the songs of birds.      But the sky, the sky, the wide, free sky,      For the home of the song-bird's heart!\"      How falsely does that man see Nature, how grossly ignorant must he be of  its most elemental truths, who looks upon it as a chamber of torture, a  physiological laboratory on a very vast scale, a scene of endless strife  and trepidation, of hunger and cold, and every form of pain and  misery--and who, holding this doctrine of      \"Oh, the sky, the sky, the open sky is the home of a song-bird's heart,\"    Nature's cruelty, keeps a few captive birds in cages, and is accustomed  to say of them, \"These, at any rate, are safe, rescued from subjection  to ruthless conditions, sheltered from the inclement weather and from  enemies, and all their small wants abundantly satisfied;\" who once or  twice every day looks at his little captives, presents them with a lump  of sugar, whistles and chuckles to provoke them to sing, then goes about  his business, flattering himself that he is a lover of birds, a being of  a sweet and kindly nature. It is all a delusion--a distortion and  inversion of the truth--so absurd that it would be laughable were it  not so sad, and the cause of so much unconscious cruelty. The truth is,  that if birds be capable of misery, it is only in the unnatural  conditions of a caged life that they experience it; and that if they are  capable of happiness in a cage, such happiness or contentment is but a  poor, pale emotion compared with the wild exuberant gladness they have  in freedom, where all their instincts have full play, and where the  perils that surround them do but brighten their many splendid faculties.  The little bird twitters and sings in its cage, and among ourselves the  blind man and the cripple whistle and sing, too, feeling at times a  lower kind of contentment and cheerfulness. The chaffinch in East  London, with its eyeballs seared by red-hot needles, sings, too, in its  prison, when it has grown accustomed to its darkened existence, and is  in health, and the agreeable sensations that accompany health prompt it  at intervals to melody, but no person, not even the dullest ruffian  among the baser sort of bird-fanciers would maintain for a moment that  the happiness of the little sightless captive, whether vocal or silent,  is at all comparable in degree to that of the chaffinch singing in April  \"on the orchard bough,\" vividly seeing the wide sunlit world, blue above  and green below, possessing the will and the power, when its lyric ends,  to transport itself swiftly through the crystal fields of air to other  trees and other woods.    I take it that in the lower animals misery can result from two causes  only--restraint and disease; consequently, that animals in a state of  nature are not miserable. They are not hindered nor held back. Whether  the animal is migrating, or burying himself in his hibernating nest or  den; or flying from some rapacious enemy, which he may, or may not, be  able to escape; or feeding, or sleeping, or fighting, or courting, or  incubating, however many days or weeks this process may last--in all  things he is obeying the impulse that is strongest in him at the  time--he is doing what he wants to do--the one thing that makes him  happy.    As to disease, it is so rare in wild animals, or in a large majority of  cases so quickly proves fatal, that, compared with what we call disease  in our own species it is practically non-existent. The \"struggle for  existence,\" in so far as animals in a state of nature are concerned, is  a metaphorical struggle; and the strife, short and sharp, which is so  common in nature, is not misery, although it results in pain, since it  is pain that kills or is soon outlived. Fear there is, just as in fine  weather there are clouds in the sky; and just as the shadow of the cloud  passes, so does fear pass from the wild creature when the object that  excited it has vanished from sight. And when death comes, it comes  unexpectedly, and is not the death that we know, even before we taste of  it, thinking of it with apprehension all our lives long, but a sudden  blow that takes away consciousness--the touch of something that numbs  the nerves--merely the prick of a needle.  In whatever way the animal  perishes, whether by violence, or excessive cold, or decay, his death is  a comparatively easy one. So long as he is fighting with or struggling  to escape from an enemy, wounds are not felt as wounds, and scarcely  hurt him--as we know from our own experience; and when overcome, if  death be not practically instantaneous, as in the case of a small bird  seized by a cat, the disabling grip or blow is itself a kind of anodyne,  producing insensibility to pain. This, too, is a matter of human  experience. To say nothing of those who fall in battle, men have often  been struck down and fearfully lacerated by lions, tigers, jaguars, and  other savage beasts; and after having been rescued by their companions,  have recounted this strange thing. Even when there was no loss of  consciousness, when they saw and knew that the animal was rending their  flesh, they seemed not to feel it, and were, at the time, indifferent to  the fate that had overtaken them.    It is the same in death from cold. The strong, well-nourished man,  overtaken by a snowstorm on some pathless, uninhabited waste, may  experience some exceedingly bitter moments, or even hours, before he  gives up the struggle. The physical pain is simply nothing: the whole  bitterness is in the thought that he must die. The horror at the thought  of annihilation, the remembrance of all the happiness he is now about to  lose, of dear friends, of those whose lives will be dimmed with grief  for his loss, of all his cherished dreams of the future--the sting"]]]
