How many \"old maids\" take this high stand we cannot say: it is an  unhappy fact that too many who have come before the eye are gossips  rather, and not always good-natured gossips. But if these abuse, and  none make the best of their vocation, yet it has not failed to produce  some good results. It has been seen by others, if not by themselves,  that beings, likely to be left alone, need to be fortified and  furnished within themselves; and education and thought have tended  more and more to regard these beings as related to absolute Being, as  well as to others. It has been seen that, as the breaking of no bond  ought to destroy a man, so ought the missing of none to hinder him  from growing. And thus a circumstance of the time, which springs  rather from its luxury than its purity, has helped to place women on  the true platform.    Perhaps the next generation, looking deeper into this matter, will  find that contempt is put upon old maids, or old women, at all, merely  because they do not use the elixir which would keep them always young.  Under its influence, a gem brightens yearly which is only seen to more  advantage through the fissures Time makes in the casket. [Footnote:  Appendix F.] No one thinks of Michael Angelo's Persican Sibyl, or St.  Theresa, or Tasso's Leonora, or the Greek Electra, as an old maid,  more than of Michael Angelo or Canova as old bachelors, though all had  reached the period in life's course appointed to take that degree.    See a common woman at forty; scarcely has she the remains of beauty,  of any soft poetic grace which gave her attraction as Woman, which  kindled the hearts of those who looked on her to sparkling thoughts,  or diffused round her a roseate air of gentle love. See her, who was,  indeed, a lovely girl, in the coarse, full-blown dahlia flower of what  is commonly matron-beauty, \"fat, fair, and forty,\" showily dressed,  and with manners as broad and full as her frill or satin cloak. People  observe, \"How well she is preserved!\" \"She is a fine woman still,\"  they say. This woman, whether as a duchess in diamonds, or one of our  city dames in mosaics, charms the poet's heart no more, and would look  much out of place kneeling before the Madonna. She \"does well the  honors of her house,\"--\"leads society,\"--is, in short, always spoken  and thought of upholstery-wise.    Or see that care-worn face, from which every soft line is  blotted,--those faded eyes, from which lonely tears have driven the  flashes of fancy, the mild white beam of a tender enthusiasm. This  woman is not so ornamental to a tea-party; yet she would please  better, in picture. Yet surely she, no more than the other, looks as a  human being should at the end of forty years. Forty years! have they  bound those brows with no garland? shed in the lamp no drop of  ambrosial oil?    Not so looked the Iphigenia in Aulis. Her forty years had seen her in  anguish, in sacrifice, in utter loneliness. But those pains were borne  for her father and her country; the sacrifice she had made pure for  herself and those around her. Wandering alone at night in the vestal  solitude of her imprisoning grove, she has looked up through its  \"living summits\" to the stars, which shed down into her aspect their  own lofty melody. At forty she would not misbecome the marble.    Not so looks the Persica. She is withered; she is faded; the drapery  that enfolds her has in its dignity an angularity, too, that tells of  age, of sorrow, of a stern resignation to the _must_. But her  eye, that torch of the soul, is untamed, and, in the intensity of her  reading, we see a soul invincibly young in faith and hope. Her age is  her charm, for it is the night of the past that gives this beacon-fire  leave to shine. Wither more and more, black Chrysalid! thou dost but  give the winged beauty time to mature its splendors!    Not so looked Victoria Colonna, after her life of a great hope, and of  true conjugal fidelity. She had been, not merely a bride, but a wife,  and each hour had helped to plume the noble bird. A coronet of pearls  will not shame her brow; it is white and ample, a worthy altar for  love and thought.    Even among the North American Indians, a race of men as completely  engaged in mere instinctive life as almost any in the world, and where  each chief, keeping many wives as useful servants, of course looks  with no kind eye on celibacy in Woman, it was excused in the following  instance mentioned by Mrs. Jameson. A woman dreamt in youth that she  was betrothed to the Sun. She built her a wigwam apart, filled it with  emblems of her alliance, and means of on independent life. There she  passed her days, sustained by her own exertions, and true to her  supposed engagement.    In any tribe, we believe, a woman, who lived as if she was betrothed  to the Sun, would be tolerated, and the rays which made her youth  blossom sweetly, would crown her with a halo in age.    There is, on this subject, a nobler view than heretofore, if not the  noblest, and improvement here must coincide with that in the view  taken of marriage. \"We must have units before we can have union,\" says  one of the ripe thinkers of the times.    If larger intellectual resources begin to be deemed needful to Woman,  still more is a spiritual dignity in her, or even the mere assumption  of it, looked upon with respect. Joanna Southcote and Mother Anne Lee  are sure of a band of disciples; Ecstatica, Dolorosa, of enraptured  believers who will visit them in their lowly huts, and wait for days  to revere them in their trances. The foreign noble traverses land and  sea to hear a few words from the lips of the lowly peasant girl, whom  he believes especially visited by the Most High. Very beautiful, in  this way, was the influence of the invalid of St. Petersburg, as  described by De Maistre.    Mysticism, which may be defined as the brooding soul of the world,  cannot fail of its oracular promise as to Woman. \"The mothers,\" \"The  mother of all things,\" are expressions of thought which lead the mind  towards this side of universal growth. Whenever a mystical whisper was  heard, from Behmen down to St. Simon, sprang up the thought, that, if  it be true, as the legend says, that Humanity withers through a fault  committed by and a curse laid upon Woman, through her pure child, or  influence, shall the new Adam, the redemption, arise. Innocence is to  be replaced by virtue, dependence by a willing submission, in the  heart of the Virgin-Mother of the new race.    The spiritual tendency is toward the elevation of Woman, but the  intellectual by itself is not so. Plato sometimes seems penetrated by  that high idea of love, which considers Man and Woman as the two-fold  expression of one thought. This the angel of Swedenborg, the angel of  the coming age, cannot surpass, but only explain more fully. But then  again Plato, the man of intellect, treats Woman in the Republic as  property, and, in the Timaeus, says that Man, if he misuse the  privileges of one life, shall be degraded into the form of Woman; and  then, if ho do not redeem himself, into that of a bird. This, as I  said above, expresses most happily how antipoetical is this state of  mind. For the poet, contemplating the world of things, selects various  birds as the symbols of his most gracious and ethereal thoughts, just  as he calls upon his genius as muse rather than as God. But the  intellect, cold, is ever more masculine than feminine; warmed by  emotion, it rushes toward mother-earth, and puts on the forms of  beauty.    The electrical, the magnetic element in Woman has not been fairly  brought out at any period. Everything might be expected from it; she  has far more of it than Man. This is commonly expressed by saying that  her intuitions are more rapid and more correct. You will often see men  of high intellect absolutely stupid in regard to the atmospheric  changes, the fine invisible links which connect the forms of life  around them, while common women, if pure and modest, so that a vulgar  self do not overshadow the mental eye, will seize and delineate these  with unerring discrimination.    Women who combine this organization with creative genius are very  commonly unhappy at present. They see too much to act in conformity  with those around them, and their quick impulses seem folly to those  who do not discern the motives. This is an usual effect of the  apparition of genius, whether in Man or Woman, but is more frequent  with regard to the latter, because a harmony, an obvious order and  self-restraining decorum, is most expected from her.    Then women of genius, even more than men, are likely to be enslaved by  an impassioned sensibility. The world repels them more rudely, and  they are of weaker bodily frame.    Those who seem overladen with electricity frighten those around them.  \"When she merely enters the room, I am what the French call  _herisse_,\" said a man of petty feelings and worldly character of  such a woman, whose depth of eye and powerful motion announced the  conductor of the mysterious fluid.    Woe to such a woman who finds herself linked to such a man in bonds  too close! It is the crudest of errors. He will detest her with all  the bitterness of wounded self-love. He will take the whole prejudice  of manhood upon himself, and, to the utmost of his power, imprison and  torture her by its imperious rigors.    Yet, allow room enough, and the electric fluid will be found to  invigorate and embellish, not destroy life. Such women are the great  actresses, the songsters. Such traits we read in a late searching,  though too French, analysis of the character of Mademoiselle Rachel,  by a modern, La Rochefeucault. The Greeks thus represent the muses;  they have not the golden serenity of Apollo; they are overflowed with  thought;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8649"],[0,"Indian Tales (#16)"],[1,"drenched with the rain, stood at the pit-mouth  calling down the shaft for Kundoo. They had swung the cages clear of the  mouth, and her only answer was the murmur of the flood in the pit's eye  two hundred and sixty feet below.    \"Look after that woman! She'll chuck herself down the shaft in a minute,\"  shouted the Manager.    But he need not have troubled; Unda was afraid of Death. She wanted  Kundoo. The Assistant was watching the flood and seeing how far he could  wade into it. There was a lull in the water, and the whirlpool had  slackened. The mine was full, and the people at the pit-bank howled.    \"My faith, we shall be lucky if we have five hundred hands on the place  to-morrow!\" said the Manager. \"There's some chance yet of running a  temporary dam across that water. Shove in anything--tubs and bullock-carts  if you haven't enough bricks. Make them work _now_ if they never worked  before. Hi! you gangers, make them work.\"    Little by little the crowd was broken into detachments, and pushed toward  the water with promises of overtime. The dam-making began, and when it was  fairly under way, the Manager thought that the hour had come for the  pumps. There was no fresh inrush into the mine. The tall, red,  iron-clamped pump-beam rose and fell, and the pumps snored and guttered  and shrieked as the first water poured out of the pipe.    \"We must run her all to-night,\" said the Manager, wearily, \"but there's no  hope for the poor devils down below. Look here, Gur Sahai, if you are  proud of your engines, show me what they can do now.\"    Gur Sahai grinned and nodded, with his right hand upon the lever and an  oil-can in his left. He could do no more than he was doing, but he could  keep that up till the dawn. Were the Company's pumps to be beaten by the  vagaries of that troublesome Tarachunda River? Never, never! And the pumps  sobbed and panted: \"Never, never!\" The Manager sat in the shelter of the  pit-bank roofing, trying to dry himself by the pump-boiler fire, and, in  the dreary dusk, he saw the crowds on the dam scatter and fly.    \"That's the end,\" he groaned. \"'Twill take us six weeks to persuade 'em  that we haven't tried to drown their mates on purpose. Oh, for a decent,  rational Geordie!\"    But the flight had no panic in it. Men had run over from Five with  astounding news, and the foremen could not hold their gangs together.  Presently, surrounded by a clamorous crew, Gangs Rahim, Mogul, and Janki,  and ten basket-women, walked up to report themselves, and pretty little  Unda stole away to Janki's hut to prepare his evening meal.    \"Alone I found the way,\" explained Janki Meah, \"and now will the Company  give me pension?\"    The simple pit-folk shouted and leaped and went back to the dam, reassured  in their old belief that, whatever happened, so great was the power of the  Company whose salt they ate, none of them could be killed. But Gur Sahai  only bared his white teeth and kept his hand upon the lever and proved his  pumps to the uttermost.             *         *         *         *         *    \"I say,\" said the Assistant to the Manager, a week later, \"do you  recollect _Germinal?_\"    \"Yes. 'Queer thing, I thought of it In the cage when that balk went by.  Why?\"    \"Oh, this business seems to be _Germinal_ upside down. Janki was in my  veranda all this morning, telling me that Kundoo had eloped with his  wife--Unda or Anda, I think her name was.\"    \"Hillo! And those were the cattle that you risked your life to clear out  of Twenty-Two!\"    \"No--I was thinking of the Company's props, not the Company's men.\"    \"Sounds better to say so _now_; but I don't believe you, old fellow.\"        THE COURTING OF DINAH SHADD      What did the colonel's lady think?       Nobody never knew.     Somebody asked the sergeant's wife       An' she told 'em true.     When you git to a man in the case       They're like a row o' pins,     For the colonel's lady an' Judy O'Grady       Are sisters under their skins.        _Barrack Room Ballad._    All day I had followed at the heels of a pursuing army engaged on one of  the finest battles that ever camp of exercise beheld. Thirty thousand  troops had by the wisdom of the Government of India been turned loose over  a few thousand square miles of country to practice in peace what they  would never attempt in war. Consequently cavalry charged unshaken infantry  at the trot. Infantry captured artillery by frontal attacks delivered in  line of quarter columns, and mounted infantry skirmished up to the wheels  of an armored train which carried nothing more deadly than a twenty-five  pounder Armstrong, two Nordenfeldts, and a few score volunteers all cased  in three-eighths-inch boiler-plate. Yet it was a very lifelike camp.  Operations did not cease at sundown; nobody knew the country and nobody  spared man or horse. There was unending cavalry scouting and almost  unending forced work over broken ground. The Army of the South had finally  pierced the centre of the Army of the North, and was pouring through the  gap hot-foot to capture a city of strategic importance. Its front extended  fanwise, the sticks being represented by regiments strung out along the  line of route backward to the divisional transport columns and all the  lumber that trails behind an army on the move. On its right the broken  left of the Army of the North was flying in mass, chased by the Southern  horse and hammered by the Southern guns till these had been pushed far  beyond the limits of their last support. Then the flying sat down to rest,  while the elated commandant of the pursuing force telegraphed that he held  all in check and observation.    Unluckily he did not observe that three miles to his right flank a flying  column of Northern horse with a detachment of Ghoorkhas and British troops  had been pushed round, as fast as the failing light allowed, to cut across  the entire rear of the Southern Army, to break, as it were, all the ribs  of the fan where they converged by striking at the transport, reserve  ammunition, and artillery supplies. Their instructions were to go in,  avoiding the few scouts who might not have been drawn off by the pursuit,  and create sufficient excitement to impress the Southern Army with the  wisdom of guarding their own flank and rear before they captured cities.  It was a pretty manoeuvre, neatly carried out.    Speaking for the second division of the Southern Army, our first  intimation of the attack was at twilight, when the artillery were laboring  in deep sand, most of the escort were trying to help them out, and the  main body of the infantry had gone on. A Noah's Ark of elephants, camels,  and the mixed menagerie of an Indian transport-train bubbled and squealed  behind the guns, when there appeared from nowhere in particular British  infantry to the extent of three companies, who sprang to the heads of the  gun-horses and brought all to a standstill amid oaths and cheers.    \"How's that, umpire?\" said the major commanding the attack, and with one  voice the drivers and limber gunners answered \"Hout!\" while the colonel of  artillery sputtered.    \"All your scouts are charging our main body,\" said the major. \"Your flanks  are unprotected for two miles. I think we've broken the back of this  division. And listen,--there go the Ghoorkhas!\"    A weak fire broke from the rear-guard more than a mile away, and was  answered by cheerful howlings. The Ghoorkhas, who should have swung clear  of the second division, had stepped on its tail in the dark, but drawing  off hastened to reach the next line of attack, which lay almost parallel  to us five or six miles away.    Our column swayed and surged irresolutely,--three batteries, the  divisional ammunition reserve, the baggage, and a section of the hospital  and bearer corps. The commandant ruefully promised to report himself \"cut  up\" to the nearest umpires and commending his cavalry and all other  cavalry to the special care of Eblis, toiled on to resume touch with the  rest of the division.    \"We'll bivouac here to-night,\" said the major, \"I have a notion that the  Ghoorkhas will get caught. They may want us to re-form on. Stand easy till  the transport gets away,\"    A hand caught my beast's bridle and led him out of the choking dust; a  larger hand deftly canted me out of the saddle; and two of the hugest  hands in the world received me sliding. Pleasant is the lot of the special  correspondent who falls into such hands as those of Privates Mulvaney,  Ortheris, and Learoyd.    \"An' that's all right,\" said the Irishman, calmly. \"We thought we'd find  you somewheres here by. Is there anything av yours in the transport?  Orth'ris 'll fetch ut out.\"    Ortheris did \"fetch ut out,\" from under the trunk of an elephant, in the  shape of a servant and an animal both laden with medical comforts. The  little man's eyes sparkled.    \"If the brutil an' licentious soldiery av these parts gets sight av the  thruck,\" said Mulvaney, making practiced investigation, \"they'll loot  ev'rything. They're bein' fed on iron-filin's an' dog-biscuit these days,  but glory's no compensation for a belly-ache. Praise be, we're here to  protect you, sorr.

Wolseley was quite wrong about special correspondents: they are  the soldier's best friends. Come and take pot-luck with us to-night.\"    And so it happened amid laughter and shoutings that my well-considered  commissariat melted away to reappear later at the mess-table, which was a  waterproof sheet spread on the"]]]
