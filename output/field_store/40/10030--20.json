The difference is subtle but well  marked.\"    It struck me that there was another difference that was subtle but  well marked, and that was the difference between the Edwin I'd left  messing about over his family history a week before and the jovial  rounder who was blowing smoke in my face now.    \"As a matter of fact,\" he said, \"the library would be all the better  for a little of this sort of thing. It's too conservative. That's  what's the trouble with the library. What's the matter with having a  cross-talk team and a few performing dogs there? It would brighten the  place up and attract custom. Reggie, you're looking fatigued. I've  heard there's a place somewhere in this city, if you can only find it,  expressly designed for supplying first-aid to the fatigued. Let's go  and look for it.\"    I'm not given to thinking much as a rule, but I couldn't help  pondering over this meeting with Edwin. It's hard to make you see the  remarkableness of the whole thing, for, of course, if you look at it,  in one way, there's nothing so record-breaking in smoking a cigar and  drinking a highball. But then you have never seen Edwin. There are  degrees in everything, don't you know. For Edwin to behave as he did  with me that night was simply nothing more nor less than a frightful  outburst, and it disturbed me. Not that I cared what Edwin did, as a  rule, but I couldn't help feeling a sort of what-d'you-call-it--a  presentiment, that somehow, in some way I didn't understand, I was  mixed up in it, or was soon going to be. I think the whole fearful  family had got on my nerves to such an extent that the mere sight of  any of them made me jumpy.    And, by George, I was perfectly right, don't you know. In a day or two  along came the usual telegram from Florence, telling me to come to  Madison Avenue.    The mere idea of Madison Avenue was beginning to give me that tired  feeling, and I made up my mind I wouldn't go near the place. But of  course I did. When it came to the point, I simply hadn't the common  manly courage to keep away.    Florence was there as before.    \"Reginald,\" she said, \"I think I shall go raving mad.\"    This struck me as a mighty happy solution of everybody's troubles, but  I felt it was too good to be true.    \"Over a week ago,\" she went on, \"my brother Edwin came up to New York  to consult a book at the library. I anticipated that this would occupy  perhaps an afternoon, and was expecting him back by an early train  next day. He did not arrive. He sent an incoherent telegram. But even  then I suspected nothing.\" She paused. \"Yesterday morning,\" she said,  \"I had a letter from my aunt Augusta.\"    She paused again. She seemed to think I ought to be impressed.    Her eyes tied a bowknot in my spine.    \"Let me read you her letter. No, I will tell you its contents. Aunt  Augusta had seen Edwin lunching at the Waldorf with a creature.\"    \"A what?\"    \"My aunt described her. Her hair was of a curious dull bronze tint.\"    \"Your aunt's?\"    \"The woman's. It was then that I began to suspect. How many women with  dull bronze hair does Edwin know?\"    \"Great Scott! Why ask me?\"    I had got used to being treated as a sort of \"Hey, Bill!\" by Florence,  but I was darned if I was going to be expected to be an encyclopedia  as well.    \"One,\" she said. \"That appalling Darrell woman.\"    She drew a deep breath.    \"Yesterday evening,\" she said, \"I saw them together in a taximeter  cab. They were obviously on their way to some theatre.\"    She fixed me with her eye.    \"Reginald,\" she said, \"you must go and see her the first thing  to-morrow.\"    \"What!\" I cried. \"Me? Why? Why me?\"    \"Because you are responsible for the whole affair. You introduced  Douglas to her. You suggested that he should bring her home. Go to her  to-morrow and ascertain her intentions.\"    \"But----\"    \"The very first thing.\"    \"But wouldn't it be better to have a talk with Edwin?\"    \"I have made every endeavour to see Edwin, but he deliberately avoids  me. His answers to my telegrams are willfully evasive.\"    There was no doubt that Edwin had effected a thorough bolt. He was  having quite a pleasant little vacation: Two Weeks in Sunny New York.  And from what I'd seen of him, he seemed to be thriving on it. I  didn't wonder Florence had got rather anxious. She'd have been more  anxious if she had seen him when I did. He'd got a sort of  \"New-York-is-so-bracing\" look about him, which meant a whole heap of  trouble before he trotted back to the fold.    Well, I started off to interview Mrs. Darrell, and, believe me, I  didn't like the prospect. I think they ought to train A. D. T.  messengers to do this sort of thing. I found her alone. The rush hour  of clients hadn't begun.    \"How do you do, Mr. Pepper?\" she said. \"How nice of you to call.\"    Very friendly, and all that. It made the situation darned difficult  for a fellow, if you see what I mean.    \"Say,\" I said. \"What about it, don't you know?\"    \"I certainly don't,\" she said. \"What ought I to know about what?\"    \"Well, about Edwin--Edwin Craye,\" I said.    She smiled.    \"Oh! So you're an ambassador, Mr. Pepper?\"    \"Well, as a matter of fact, I did come to see if I could find out how  things were running. What's going to happen?\"    \"Are you consulting me professionally? If so, you must show me your  hand. Or perhaps you would rather I showed you mine?\"    It was subtle, but I got on to it after a bit.    \"Yes,\" I said, \"I wish you would.\"    \"Very well. Do you remember a conversation we had, Mr. Pepper, my last  afternoon at the Crayes'? We came to the conclusion that I was rather  a vindictive woman.\"    \"By George! You're stringing old Edwin so as to put one over on  Florence?\"    She flushed a little.    \"How very direct you are, Mr. Pepper! How do you know I'm not very  fond of Mr. Craye? At any rate, I'm very sorry for him.\"    \"He's such a chump.\"    \"But he's improving every day. Have you seen him? You must notice the  difference?\"    \"There is a difference.\"    \"He only wanted taking out of himself. I think he found his sister  Florence's influence a little oppressive sometimes.\"    \"No, but see here,\" I said, \"are you going to marry him?\"    \"I'm only a palmist. I don't pretend to be a clairvoyant. A marriage  may be indicated in Mr. Craye's hand, but I couldn't say without  looking at it.\"    \"But I shall have to tell her something definite, or she won't give me  a moment's peace.\"    \"Tell her her brother is of age. Surely that's definite enough?\"    And I couldn't get any more out of her. I went back to Florence and  reported. She got pretty excited about it.    \"Oh, if I were a man!\" she said.    I didn't see how that would have helped. I said so.    \"I'd go straight to Edwin and _drag_ him away. He is staying at  his club. If I were a man I could go in and find him----\"    \"Not if you weren't a member,\" I said.    \"--And tell him what I thought of his conduct. As I'm only a woman, I  have to wait in the hall while a deceitful small boy pretends to go  and look for him.\"    It had never struck me before what a splendid institution a club was.  Only a few days back I'd been thinking that the subscription to mine  was a bit steep. But now I saw that the place earned every cent of the  money.    \"Have you no influence with him, Reginald?\"    I said I didn't think I had. She called me something. Invertebrate, or  something. I didn't catch it.    \"Then there's only one thing to do. You must find my father and tell  him all. Perhaps you may rouse him to a sense of what is right. You  may make him remember that he has duties as a parent.\"    I thought it far more likely that I should make him remember that he  had a foot. I hadn't a very vivid recollection of old man Craye. I was  quite a kid when he made his great speech on the Egg Question and beat  it for Europe--but what I did recollect didn't encourage me to go and  chat with him about the duties of a parent.    As I remember him, he was a rather large man with elephantiasis of the  temper. I distinctly recalled one occasion when I was spending a  school vacation at his home, and he found me trying to shave old  Duggie, then a kid of fourteen, with his razor.    \"I shouldn't be able to find him,\" I said.    \"You can get his address from his lawyers.\"    \"He may be at the North Pole.\"    \"Then you must go to the North Pole.\"    \"But say----!\"    \"Reginald!\"    \"Oh, all right.\"    I knew just what would happen. Parbury and Stevens, the lawyers,  simply looked at me as if I had been caught snatching bags. At least,  Stevens did. And Parbury would have done it, too, only he had been  dead a good time. Finally, after drinking me in for about a quarter of  an hour, Stevens said that if I desired to address a communication to  his client, care of this office, it would be duly forwarded. Good  morning. Good morning. Anything further? No, thanks. Good morning.  Good morning.    I handed the glad news on to Florence and left her to do what she  liked about it. She went down and interviewed Stevens. I suppose he'd  had experience of her. At any rate, he didn't argue. He yielded up the  address in level time. Old man Craye was living in Paris, but was to  arrive in New York that night, and would doubtless be at his club.    It was the same club where Edwin was hiding from Florence. I pointed  this out to her.    \"There's no need for me to butt in after all,\" I said. \"He'll meet  Edwin there, and they can fight it out in the smoking room. You've  only to drop him a line explaining the facts.\"    \"I shall certainly communicate with him in writing, but, nevertheless,  you must see him. I cannot explain everything in a letter.\"    \"But doesn't it strike you that he may think it pretty bad  gall--impertinence, don't you know, for a comparative stranger like me  to be tackling a delicate family affair like this?\"    \"You will explain that you are acting for me.\"    \"It wouldn't be better if old Duggie went along"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8220"],[0,"Remarks (#16)"],[1,"eating-house at that point, and the one odd characteristic  which he has, makes him well known all through three or four States. I  could not illustrate his eccentricity any better than by relating a  circumstance that occurred to me at the Junction last week. I had just  eaten breakfast there and paid for it. I stepped up to the cigar case and  asked this man if he had \"a rattling good cigar.\"    [Illustration: THE ANTIQUE LUNCH.]    Without knowing it I had struck the very point upon which this man seems  to be a crank, if you will allow me that expression, though it doesn't fit  very well in this place. He looked at me in a sad and subdued manner and  said, \"No, sir; I haven't a rattling good cigar in the house. I have some  cigars there that I bought for Havana fillers, but they are mostly filled  with pieces of Colorado Maduro overalls. There's a box over yonder that I  bought for good, straight ten cent cigars, but they are only a chaos of  hay and Flora, Fino and Damfino, all socked into a Wisconsin wrapper. Over  in the other end of the case is a brand of cigars that were to knock the  tar out of all other kinds of weeds, according to the urbane rustler who  sold them to me, and then drew on me before I could light one of them.  Well, instead of being a fine Colorado Claro with a high-priced wrapper,  they are common Mexicano stinkaros in a Mother Hubbard wrapper. The  commercial tourist who sold me those cigars and then drew on me at sight  was a good deal better on the draw than his cigars are. If you will  notice, you will see that each cigar has a spinal column to it, and this  outer debris is wrapped around it. One man bought a cigar out of that box  last week. I told him, though, just as I am telling you, that they were no  good, and if he bought one he would regret it. But he took one and went  out on the veranda to smoke it. Then he stepped on a melon rind and fell  with great force on his side. When we picked him up he gasped once or  twice and expired. We opened his vest hurriedly and found that, in  falling, this bouquet de Gluefactoro cigar, with the spinal column, had  been driven through his breast bone and had penetrated his heart. The  wrapper of the cigar never so much as cracked.\"    \"But doesn't it impair your trade to run on in this wild, reckless way  about your cigars?\"    \"It may at first, but not after awhile. I always tell people what my  cigars are made of, and then they can't blame me; so, after awhile they  get to believe what I say about them. I often wonder that no cigar man  ever tried this way before. I do just the same way about my lunch counter.  If a man steps up and wants a fresh ham sandwich I give it to him if I've  got it, and if I haven't it I tell him so. If you turn my sandwiches over,  you will find the date of its publication on every one. If they are not  fresh, and I have no fresh ones, I tell the customer that they are not so  blamed fresh as the young man with the gauze moustache, but that I can  remember very well when they were fresh, and if his artificial teeth fit  him pretty well he can try one.    \"It's just the same with boiled eggs. I have a rubber dating stamp, and as  soon as the eggs are turned over to me by the hen for inspection, I date  them. Then they are boiled and another date in red is stamped on them. If  one of my clerks should date an egg ahead, I would fire him too quick.    \"On this account, people who know me will skip a meal at Missouri  Junction, in order to come here and eat things that are not clouded with  mystery. I do not keep any poor stuff when I can help it, but if I do, I  don't conceal the horrible fact.    \"Of course a new cook will sometimes smuggle a late date onto a mediaeval  egg and sell it, but he has to change his name and flee.    \"I suppose that if every eating-house should date everything, and be  square with the public, it would be an old story and wouldn't pay; but as  it is, no one trying to compete with me, I do well out of it, and people  come here out of curiosity a good deal.    \"The reason I try to do right and win the public esteem is that the  general public never did me any harm and the majority of people who travel  are a kind that I may meet in a future state. I should hate to have a  thousand traveling men holding nuggets of rancid ham sandwiches under my  nose through all eternity, and know that I had lied about it. It's an  honest fact, if I knew I'd got to stand up and apologize for my hand-made,  all-around, seamless pies, and quarantine cigars, Heaven would be no  object.\"          Insomnia in Domestic Animals.    If there be one thing above another that I revel in, it is science. I have  devoted much of my life to scientific research, and though it hasn't made  much stir in the scientific world so far, I am positive that when I am  gone the scientists of our day will miss me, and the red-nosed theorist  will come and shed the scalding tear over my humble tomb.    My attention was first attracted to insomnia as the foe of the domestic  animal, by the strange appearance of a favorite dog named Lucretia Borgia.  I did not name this animal Lucretia Borgia. He was named when I purchased  him. In his eccentric and abnormal thirst for blood he favored Lucretia,  but in sex he did not. I got him partly because he loved children. The  owner said Lucretia Borgia was an ardent lover of children, and I found  that he was. He seemed to love them best in the spring of the year, when  they were tender. He would have eaten up a favorite child of mine, if the  youngster hadn't left a rubber ball in his pocket which clogged the  glottis of Lucretia till I could get there and disengage what was left of  the child.    Lucretia soon after this began to be restless. He would come to my  casement and lift up his voice, and howl into the bosom of the silent  night. At first I thought that he had found some one in distress, or  wanted to get me out of doors and save my life. I went out several nights  in a weird costume that I had made up of garments belonging to different  members of my family. I dressed carefully in the dark and stole out to  kill the assassin referred to by Lucretia, but he was not there. Then the  faithful animal would run up to me and with almost human, pleading eyes,  bark and run away toward a distant alley. I immediately decided that some  one was suffering there. I had read in books about dogs that led their  masters away to the suffering and saved people's lives; so, when Lucretia  came to me with his great, honest eyes and took little mementoes out of  the calf of my leg, and then galloped off seven or eight blocks, I  followed him in the chill air of night and my Mosaic clothes. I wandered  away to where the dog stopped behind a livery stable, and there, lying in  a shuddering heap on the frosty ground, lay the still, white features of a  soup bone that had outlived its usefulness.    On the way back, I met a physician who had been up town to swear in an  American citizen who would vote twenty-one years later, if he lived. The  physician stopped me and was going to take me to the home of the  friendless, when he discovered who I was.    [Illustration: EXCITING PUBLIC CURIOSITY.]    You wrap a tall man, with a William H. Seward nose, in a flannel robe, cut  plain, and then put a plug hat and a sealskin sacque and Arctic overshoes  on him, and put him out in the street, under the gaslight, with his trim,  purple ankles just revealing themselves as he madly gallops after a  hydrophobia infested dog, and it is not, after all, surprising that  people's curiosity should be a little bit excited.    After I had introduced myself to the physician and asked him for a cigar,  explaining that I could not find any in the clothes I had on, I asked him  about Lucretia Borgia. I told the doctor how Lucretia seemed restless  nights and nervous and irritable days, and how he seemed to be almost a  mental wreck, and asked him what the trouble was.    He said it was undoubtedly \"insomnia.\" He said that it was a bad case of  it, too. I told him I thought so myself. I said I didn't mind the insomnia  that Lucretia had so much as I did my own. I was getting more insomnia on  my hands than I could use.    He gave me something to administer to Lucretia. He said I must put it in a  link of sausage and leave the sausage where it would appear that I didn't  want the dog to get it, and then Lucretia would eat it greedily.    I did so. It worked well so far as the administration of the remedy was  concerned, but it was fatal to my little, high strung, yearnful dog. It  must have contained something of a deleterious character, for the next  morning a coarse man took Lucretia Borgia by the tail and laid him where  the violets blow. Malignant insomnia is fast becoming the great foe to the  modern American dog.          Along Lake Superior.    I have just returned from a brief visit to Duluth. After strolling along  the Bay of Naples and watching old Vesuvius vomit red-hot mud, vapor and  other campaign documents, Duluth is quite a change. The ice in the bay at  Duluth was thirty-eight inches in depth when I left there the last week in  March, and we rode across it with the utmost impunity. By the time these  lines fall beneath the eye of the genial, courteous and urbane reader, the  new railroad bridge across the bay, over a mile and a half long, will have  been completed, so that you may ride from Chicago to Duluth over the  Northwestern and Omaha railroads with great comfort. I would be glad to  digress here and tell about the beauty of the summer scenery along the  Omaha road, and the shy and beautiful troutlet, and the dark and silent  Chippewa squawlet and her little bleached out pappooselet, were it not for  the unkind and cruel thrusts that I would invoke from the scenery cynic  who believes that a newspaper man's opinions may be largely warped with a  pass.    Duluth has been joked a good deal, but she"]]]
