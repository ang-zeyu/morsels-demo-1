The mere rivalry of their authorship is no subject of concern; but it  is enough for any ingenuous man to have toiled for years in solitude to  complete a work of public utility, without entering a warfare for life to  defend and preserve it. Accidental coincidences in books are unfrequent,  and not often such as to excite the suspicion of the most sensitive. But,  though the criteria of plagiarism are neither obscure nor disputable, it is  not easy, in this beaten track of literature, for persons of little reading  to know what is, or is not, original. Dates must be accurately observed;  and a multitude of minute things must be minutely compared. And who will  undertake such a task but he that is personally interested? Of the  thousands who are forced into the paths of learning, few ever care to know,  by what pioneer, or with what labour, their way was cast up for them. And  even of those who are honestly engaged in teaching, not many are adequate  judges of the comparative merits of the great number of books on this  subject. The common notions of mankind conform more easily to fashion than  to truth; and even of some things within their reach, the majority seem  contend to take their opinions upon trust. Hence, it is vain to expect that  that which is intrinsically best, will be everywhere preferred; or that  which is meritoriously elaborate, adequately appreciated. But common sense  might dictate, that learning is not encouraged or respected by those who,  for the making of books, prefer a pair of scissors to the pen.    27. The fortune of a grammar is not always an accurate test of its merits.  The goddess of the plenteous horn stands blindfold yet upon the floating  prow; and, under her capricious favour, any pirate-craft, ill stowed with  plunder, may sometimes speed as well, as barges richly laden from the  golden mines of science. Far more are now afloat, and more are stranded on  dry shelves, than can be here reported. But what this work contains, is  candidly designed to qualify the reader to be himself a judge of what it  _should_ contain; and I will hope, so ample a report as this, being thought  sufficient, will also meet his approbation. The favour of one discerning  mind that comprehends my subject, is worth intrinsically more than that of  half the nation: I mean, of course, the half of whom my gentle reader is  not one.       \"They praise and they admire they know not what,      And know not whom, but as one leads the other.\"--_Milton_.          CHAPTER III.    OF GRAMMATICAL SUCCESS AND FAME.    \"Non is ego sum, cui aut jucundum, aut adeo opus sit, de aliis detrahere,  et hac via ad famara contendere. Melioribus artibus laudem parare didici.  Itaque non libenter dico, quod praesens institutum dicere cogit.\"--Jo.  AUGUSTI ERNESTI _Praef. ad Graecum Lexicon_, p. vii.      1. The real history of grammar is little known; and many erroneous  impressions are entertained concerning it: because the story of the systems  most generally received has never been fully told; and that of a multitude  now gone to oblivion was never worth telling. In the distribution of  grammatical fame, which has chiefly been made by the hand of interest, we  have had a strange illustration of the saying: \"Unto every one that hath  shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but from him that hath not,  shall be taken away even that which he hath.\" Some whom fortune has made  popular, have been greatly overrated, if learning and talent are to be  taken into the account; since it is manifest, that with no extraordinary  claims to either, they have taken the very foremost rank among grammarians,  and thrown the learning and talents of others into the shade, or made them  tributary to their own success and popularity.    2. It is an ungrateful task to correct public opinion by showing the  injustice of praise. Fame, though it may have been both unexpected and  undeserved, is apt to be claimed and valued as part and parcel of a man's  good name; and the dissenting critic, though ever-so candid, is liable to  be thought an envious detractor. It would seem in general most prudent to  leave mankind to find out for themselves how far any commendation bestowed  on individuals is inconsistent with truth. But, be it remembered, that  celebrity is not a virtue; nor, on the other hand, is experience the  cheapest of teachers. A good man may not have done all things ably and  well; and it is certainly no small mistake to estimate his character by the  current value of his copy-rights. Criticism may destroy the reputation of a  book, and not be inconsistent with a cordial respect for the private worth  of its author. The reader will not be likely to be displeased with what is  to be stated in this chapter, if he can believe, that no man's merit as a  writer, may well be enhanced by ascribing to him that which he himself, for  the protection of his own honour, has been constrained to disclaim. He  cannot suppose that too much is alleged, if he will admit that a  grammarian's fame should be thought safe enough in his _own keeping_. Are  authors apt to undervalue their own performances? Or because proprietors  and publishers may profit by the credit of a book, shall it be thought  illiberal to criticise it? Is the author himself to be disbelieved, that  the extravagant praises bestowed upon him may be justified? \"Superlative  commendation,\" says Dillwyn, \"is near akin to _detraction_.\" (See his  _Reflections_, p. 22.) Let him, therefore, who will charge detraction upon  me, first understand wherein it consists. I shall criticise, freely, both  the works of the living, and the doctrines of those who, to us, live only  in their works; and if any man dislike this freedom, let him rebuke it,  showing wherein it is wrong or unfair. The amiable author just quoted, says  again: \"Praise has so often proved an _impostor_, that it would be well,  wherever we meet with it, to treat it as a vagrant.\"--_Ib._, p. 100. I go  not so far as this; but that eulogy which one knows to be false, he cannot  but reckon impertinent.    3. Few writers on grammar have been more noted than WILLIAM LILY and  LINDLEY MURRAY. Others have left better monuments of their learning and  talents, but none perhaps have had greater success and fame. The Latin  grammar which was for a long time most popular in England, has commonly  been ascribed to the one; and what the Imperial Review, in 1805, pronounced  \"the best English grammar, beyond all comparison, that has yet appeared,\"  was compiled by the other. And doubtless they have both been rightly judged  to excel the generality of those which they were intended to supersede; and  both, in their day, may have been highly serviceable to the cause of  learning. For all excellence is but comparative; and to grant them this  superiority, is neither to prefer them now, nor to justify the praise which  has been bestowed upon their authorship. As the science of grammar can  never be taught without a book, or properly taught by any book which is not  itself grammatical, it is of some importance both to teachers and to  students, to make choice of the best. Knowledge will not advance where  grammars hold rank by prescription. Yet it is possible that many, in  learning to write and speak, may have derived no inconsiderable benefit  from a book that is neither accurate nor complete.    4. With respect to time, these two grammarians were three centuries apart;  during which period, the English language received its most classical  refinement, and the relative estimation of the two studies, Latin and  English grammar, became in a great measure reversed. Lily was an  Englishman, born at Odiham,[6] in Hampshire, in 1466. When he had arrived  at manhood, he went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem; and while abroad studied  some time at Rome, and also at Paris. On his return he was thought one of  the most accomplished scholars in England. In 1510, Dr. John Colet, dean of  St. Paul's church, in London, appointed him the first high master of St.  Paul's School, then recently founded by this gentleman's munificence. In  this situation, Lily appears to have taught with great credit to himself  till 1522, when he died of the plague, at the age of 56. For the use of  this school, he wrote and published certain parts of the grammar which has  since borne his name. Of the authorship of this work many curious  particulars are stated in the preface by John Ward, which may be seen in  the edition of 1793. Lily had able rivals, as well as learned coadjutors  and friends. By the aid of the latter, he took precedence of the former;  and his publications, though not voluminous, soon gained a general  popularity. So that when an arbitrary king saw fit to silence competition  among the philologists, by becoming himself, as Sir Thomas Elliott says,  \"the chiefe authour and setter-forth of an introduction into grammar, for  the childrene of his lovynge subjects,\" Lily's Grammar was preferred for  the basis of the standard. Hence, after the publishing of it became a  privilege patented by the crown, the book appears to have been honoured  with a royal title, and to have been familiarly called King Henry's  Grammar.    5. Prefixed to this book, there appears a very ancient epistle to the  reader, which while it shows the reasons for this royal interference with  grammar, shows also, what is worthy of remembrance, that guarded and  maintained as it was, even royal interference was here ineffectual to its  purpose. It neither produced uniformity in the methods of teaching, nor,  even for instruction in a dead language, entirely prevented the old manual  from becoming diverse in its different editions. The style also may serve  to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11620"],[0,"My Brilliant Career (#17)"],[1," man can live a life of bestiality and then be considered a  fit husband for the youngest and purest girl! It is shameful! Frank  Hawden is not wild, he hasn't got enough in him to be so. I hate him.  No, he hasn't enough in him to hate. I loathe and despise him. I would  not marry him or any one like him though he were King of England. The  idea of marriage even with the best man in the world seems to me a  lowering thing,\" I raged; \"but with him it would be pollution--the  lowest degradation that could be heaped upon me! I will never come down  to marry any one--\" here I fell a victim to a flood of excited tears.    I felt there was no good in the world, especially in men--the hateful  creatures!--and never would be while it was not expected of them, even  by rigidly pure, true Christians such as my grandmother. Grannie, dear  old grannie, thought I should marry any man who, from a financial point  of view, was a good match for me. That is where the sting came in. No, I  would never marry. I would procure some occupation in which I could  tread my life out, independent of the degradation of marriage.    \"Dear me, child,\" said grannie, concernedly, \"there is no need to  distress yourself so. I remember you were always fearfully passionate.  When I had you with me as a tiny toddler, you would fret a whole day  about a thing an ordinary child would forget inside an hour. I will tell  Hawden to go about his business. I would not want you to consider  marriage for an instant with anyone distasteful to you. But tell me  truly, have you ever flirted with him? I will take your word, for I  thank God you have never yet told me a falsehood!\"    \"Grannie,\" I exclaimed emphatically, \"I have discouraged him all I  could. I would scorn to flirt with any man.\"    \"Well, well, that is all I want to hear about it. Wash your eyes, and we  will get our horses and go over to see Mrs Hickey and her baby, and take  her something good to eat.\"    I did not encounter Frank Hawden again till the afternoon, when he  leered at me in a very triumphant manner. I stiffened myself and drew  out of his way as though he had been some vile animal. At this treatment  he whined, so I agreed to talk the matter over with him and have done  with it once and for all.    He was on his way to water some dogs, so I accompanied him out to the  stables near the kennels, to be out of hearing of the household.    I opened fire without any beating about the bush.    \"I ask you, Mr Hawden, if you have any sense of manliness, from this  hour to cease persecuting me with your idiotic professions of love. I  have two sentiments regarding it, and in either you disgust me.  Sometimes I don't believe there is such a thing as love at all--that is,  love between men and women. While in this frame of mind I would not  listen to professions of love from an angel. Other times I believe in  love, and look upon it as a sacred and solemn thing. When in that  humour, it seems to me a desecration to hear you twaddling about the  holy theme, for you are only a boy, and don't know how to feel. I would  not have spoken thus harshly to you, but by your unmanly conduct you  have brought it upon yourself. I have told you straight all that I will  ever deign to tell you on the subject, and take much pleasure in wishing  you good afternoon.\"    I walked away quickly, heedless of his expostulations.    My appeal to his manliness had no effect. Did I go for a ride, or a walk  in the afternoon to enjoy the glory of the sunset, or a stroll to drink  in the pleasures of the old garden, there would I find Frank Hawden by  my side, yah, yah, yahing about the way I treated him, until I wished  him at the bottom of the Red Sea.    However, in those glorious spring days the sense of life was too  pleasant to be much clouded by the trifling annoyance Frank Hawden  occasioned me. The graceful wild clematis festooned the shrubbery along  the creeks with great wreaths of magnificent white bloom, which loaded  every breeze with perfume; the pretty bright green senna shrubs along  the river-banks were decked in blossoms which rivalled the deep blue of  the sky in brilliance; the magpies built their nests in the tall  gum-trees, and savagely attacked unwary travellers who ventured too near  their domain; the horses were rolling fat, and invited one to get on  their satin backs and have a gallop; the cry of the leather-heads was  heard in the orchard as the cherry season approached. Oh, it was good to  be alive!    At Caddagat I was as much out of the full flood of life for which I  craved as at Possum Gully, but here there were sufficient pleasant  little ripples on the stream of existence to act as a stop-gap for the  present.          CHAPTER THIRTEEN    He      Here goes for a full account of my first, my last, my only _real_  sweetheart, for I considered the professions of that pestiferous  jackeroo as merely a grotesque caricature on the genuine article.    On making my first appearance before my lover, I looked quite the  reverse of a heroine. My lovely hair was not conveniently escaping from  the comb at the right moment to catch him hard in the eye, neither was  my thrillingly low sweet voice floating out on the scented air in a  manner which went straight to his heart, like the girls I had read of.  On the contrary, I much resembled a female clown. It was on a day  towards the end of September, and I had been up the creek making a  collection of ferns. I had on a pair of men's boots with which to walk  in the water, and was garbed in a most dilapidated old dress, which I  had borrowed from one of the servants for the purpose. A pair of gloves  made of basil, and a big hat, much torn in struggling through the  undergrowth, completed my make-up. My hair was most unbecomingly screwed  up, the short ends sticking out like a hurrah's nest.    It was late in the day when, returning from my ramble, I was met on the  doorstep by aunt Helen.    \"While you are in that trim, I wish you would pluck some lemons for me.  I'm sure there is no danger of you ruining your turn-out. A sketch of  you would make a good item for the _Bulletin_,\" she said.    I went readily to do her bidding, and fetching a ladder with rungs about  two feet six apart, placed it against a lemon-tree at the back of the  house, and climbed up.    Holding a number of lemons in my skirt, I was making a most ungraceful  descent, when I heard an unknown footstep approaching towards my back.    People came to Caddagat at all hours of the day, so I was not in the  least disconcerted. Only a tramp, an agent, or a hawker, I bet, I  thought, as I reached my big boot down for another rung of the ladder  without turning my head to see whom it might be.    A pair of strong brown hands encircled my waist, I was tossed up a foot  or so and then deposited lightly on the ground, a masculine voice  saying, \"You're a mighty well-shaped young filly--'a waist rather small,  but a quarter superb'.\"    \"How dare anyone speak to me like that,\" I thought, as I faced about to  see who was parodying Gordon. There stood a man I had never before set  eyes on, smiling mischievously at me. He was a young man--a very young  man, a bushman tremendously tall and big and sunburnt, with an open  pleasant face and chestnut moustache--not at all an awe-inspiring  fellow, in spite of his unusual, though well-proportioned and carried,  height. I knew it must be Harold Beecham, of Five-Bob Downs, as I had  heard he stood six feet three and a half in his socks.    I hurriedly let down my dress, the lemons rolling in a dozen directions,  and turned to flee, but that well-formed figure bounded before me with  the agility of a cat and barred my way.    \"Now, not a step do you go, my fine young blood, until you pick up every  jolly lemon and put them away tidily, or I'll tell the missus on you as  sure as eggs.\"    It dawned on me that he had mistaken me for one of the servant-girls.  That wasn't bad fun. I determined not to undeceive but to have a lark  with him. I summed him up as conceited, but not with the disgusting  conceit with which some are afflicted, or perhaps blessed. It was rather  an air of  I-have-always-got-what-I-desire-and-believe,-if-people-fail-it-is-all-their-own-fault,  which surrounded him.    \"If you please, sir,\" I said humbly, \"I've gathered them all up, will  you let me go now.\"    \"Yes, when you've given me a kiss.\"    \"Oh, sir, I couldn't do that!\"    \"Go on, I won't poison you. Come now, I'll make you.\"    \"Oh, the missus might catch me.\"    \"No jolly fear; I'll take all the blame if she does.\"    \"Oh don't, sir; let me go, please,\" I said in such unfeigned distress,  for I feared he was going to execute his threat, that he laughed and  said:    \"Don't be frightened, sissy, I never kiss girls, and I'm not going to  start at this time of day, and against their will to boot. You haven't  been long here, have you? I haven't seen you before. Stand out there  till I see if you've got any grit in you, and then I am done with you.\"    I stood in the middle of the yard, the spot he indicated, while he  uncurled his long heavy stock-whip with its big lash and scented myall  handle. He cracked it round and round my head and arms, but I did not  feel the least afraid, as I saw at a glance that he was exceedingly  dexterous in the bushman's art of handling a stock-whip, and knew, if I  kept perfectly still, I was quite safe. It was thanks to uncle Jay-Jay  that I was able to bear the operation with unruffled equanimity, as he  was in the habit of testing my nerves in this way.    \"Well, I never! Not so much as blinked an eyelash! Thoroughbred!\" He  said after a minute or so, \"Where's the boss?\"    \"In Gool-Gool. He won't be home till late.\"    \"Is Mrs Bossier in?\"    \"No, she's not, but Mrs Bell is somewhere around in front.\"    \"Thanks.\"    I watched him as he walked away with an easy swinging stride, which  spoke of many long, long days in the saddle."]]]
