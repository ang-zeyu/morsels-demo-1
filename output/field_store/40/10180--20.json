See the Rev. JOHN PARKER'S translation  of _The Works of_ DIONYSIUS _the Areopagite_, vol. ii. (1889), pp. 24,  25, 31, 32, and 36.    (2) The book, which first saw the light three centuries after its  alleged author's death, was translated into English by ROBERT TURNER,  and published in 1655 in a volume containing the spurious _Fourth  Book of Occult Philosophy_, attributed to CORNELIUS AGRIPPA, and other  magical works. It is from this edition that I quote.    (1b) _Op. cit_., pp. 90, 92, and 94.      Concerning the evil planetary spirits, the spurious _Fourth Book of  Occult Philosophy_, attributed to CORNELIUS AGRIPPA, informs us that  the spirits of Saturn \"appear for the most part with a tall, lean, and  slender body, with an angry countenance, having four faces; one in the  hinder part of the head, one on the former part of the head, and on each  side nosed or beaked: there likewise appeareth a face on each knee, of  a black shining colour: their motion is the moving of the wince, with a  kinde of earthquake: their signe is white earth, whiter than any Snow.\"  The writer adds that their \"particular forms are,--         A King having a beard, riding on a Dragon.       An Old man with a beard.       An Old woman leaning on a staffe.       A Hog.       A Dragon.       An Owl.       A black Garment.       A Hooke or Sickle.       A Juniper-tree.\"    Concerning the spirits of Jupiter, he says that they \"appear with a body  sanguine and cholerick, of a middle stature, with a horrible fearful  motion; but with a milde countenance, a gentle speech, and of the colour  of Iron. The motion of them is flashings of Lightning and Thunder; their  signe is, there will appear men about the circle, who shall seem to be  devoured of Lions,\" their particular forms being--         \"A King with a Sword drawn, riding on a Stag.       A Man wearing a Mitre in long rayment.       A Maid with a Laurel-Crown adorned with Flowers.       A Bull.       A Stag.       A Peacock.       An azure Garment.       A Sword.       A Box-tree.\"    As to the Martian spirits, we learn that \"they appear in a tall body,  cholerick, a filthy countenance, of colour brown, swarthy or red, having  horns like Harts horns, and Griphins claws, bellowing like wilde Bulls.  Their Motion is like fire burning; their signe Thunder and Lightning  about the Circle. Their particular shapes are,--         A King armed riding upon a Wolf.       A Man armed.       A Woman holding a buckler on her thigh.       A Hee-goat.       A Horse.       A Stag.       A red Garment.       Wool.       A Cheeslip.\"(1)      (1) _Op. cit_., pp. 43-45.    The rest are described in equally fantastic terms.    I do not think I shall be accused of being unduly sceptical if I say  that such beings as these could not have been evoked by any magical  rites, because such beings do not and did not exist, save in the  magician's own imagination. The proviso, however, is important, for,  inasmuch as these fantastic beings did exist in the imagination of the  credulous, therein they may, indeed, have been evoked. The whole of  magic ritual was well devised to produce hallucination. A firm faith  in the ritual employed, and a strong effort of will to bring about the  desired result, were usually insisted upon as essential to the success  of the operation.(2) A period of fasting prior to the experiment was  also frequently prescribed as necessary, which, by weakening the body,  must have been conducive to hallucination. Furthermore, abstention  from the gratification of the sexual appetite was stipulated in certain  cases, and this, no doubt, had a similar effect, especially as concerns  magical evocations directed to the satisfaction of the sexual impulse.  Add to these factors the details of the ritual itself, the nocturnal  conditions under which it was carried out, and particularly the  suffumigations employed, which, most frequently, were of a narcotic  nature, and it is not difficult to believe that almost any type of  hallucination may have occurred. Such, as we have seen, was ELIPHAS  LEVI'S view of ceremonial magic; and whatever may be said as concerns  his own experiment therein (for one would have thought that the  essential element of faith was lacking in this case), it is undoubtedly  the true view as concerns the ceremonial magic of the past. As this  author well says: \"Witchcraft, properly so-called, that is ceremonial  operation with intent to bewitch, acts only on the operator, and serves  to fix and confirm his will, by formulating it with persistence and  labour, the two conditions which make volition efficacious.\"(1b)      (2) \"MAGICAL AXIOM. In the circle of its action, every word creates that  which it affirms.    DIRECT CONSEQUENCE. He who affirms the devil, creates or makes the  devil.    \"_Conditions of Success in Infernal Evocations_. 1, Invincible  obstinacy; 2, a conscience at once hardened to crime and most subject  to remorse and fear; 3, affected or natural ignorance; 4, blind faith  in all that is incredible, 5, a completely false idea of God. (ELIPHAS  LEVI: _Op. cit_., pp. 297 and 298.)    (1b) ELIPHAS LEVI: _Op. cit_., pp. 130 and 131.      EMANUEL SWEDENBORG in one place writes: \"Magic is nothing but the  perversion of order; it is especially the abuse of correspondences.\"(2)  A study of the ceremonial magic of the Middle Ages and the following  century or two certainly justifies SWEDENBORG in writing of magic as  something evil. The distinction, rigid enough in theory, between white  and black, legitimate and illegitimate, magic, was, as I have indicated,  extremely indefinite in practice. As Mr A. E. WAITE justly remarks:  \"Much that passed current in the west as White (_i.e_. permissible)  Magic was only a disguised goeticism, and many of the resplendent angels  invoked with divine rites reveal their cloven hoofs. It is not too much  to say that a large majority of past psychological experiments were  conducted to establish communication with demons, and that for unlawful  purposes. The popular conceptions concerning the diabolical spheres,  which have been all accredited by magic, may have been gross  exaggerations of fact concerning rudimentary and perverse intelligences,  but the wilful viciousness of the communicants is substantially  untouched thereby.\"(1b)      (2) EMANUEL SWEDENBORG: _Arcana Caelestia_, SE 6692.    (1b) ARTHUR EDWARD WAITE: _The Occult Sciences_ (1891), p. 51.      These \"psychological experiments\" were not, save, perhaps, in rare  cases, carried out in the spirit of modern psychical research, with the  high aim of the man of science. It was, indeed, far otherwise; selfish  motives were at the root of most of them; and, apart from what may be  termed \"medicinal magic,\" it was for the satisfaction of greed, lust,  revenge, that men and women had recourse to magical arts. The history of  goeticism and witchcraft is one of the most horrible of all histories.  The \"Grimoires,\" witnesses to the superstitious folly of the past, are  full of disgusting, absurd, and even criminal rites for the satisfaction  of unlawful desires and passions. The Church was certainly justified in  attempting to put down the practice of magic, but the means adopted in  this design and the results to which they led were even more abominable  than witchcraft itself. The methods of detecting witches and the  tortures to which suspected persons were subjected to force them to  confess to imaginary crimes, employed in so-called civilised England and  Scotland and also in America, to say nothing of countries in which the  \"Holy\" Inquisition held undisputed sway, are almost too horrible to  describe. For details the reader may be referred to Sir WALTER SCOTT'S  _Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft_ (1830), and (as concerns America)  COTTON MATHER'S The _Wonders of the Invisible World_ (1692). The  credulous Church and the credulous people were terribly afraid of the  power of witchcraft, and, as always, fear destroyed their mental balance  and made them totally disregard the demands of justice. The result may  be well illustrated by what almost inevitably happens when a country  goes to war; for war, as the Hon. BERTRAND RUSSELL has well shown,  is fear's offspring. Fear of the enemy causes the military party to  persecute in an insensate manner, without the least regard to justice,  all those of their fellow-men whom they consider are not heart and soul  with them in their cause; similarly the Church relentlessly persecuted  its supposed enemies, of whom it was so afraid. No doubt some of the  poor wretches that were tortured and killed on the charge of witchcraft  really believed themselves to have made a pact with the devil, and were  thus morally depraved, though, generally speaking, they were no more  responsible for their actions than any other madmen. But the majority  of the persons persecuted as witches and wizards were innocent even of  this.    However, it would, I think, be unwise to disregard the existence of  another side to the question of the validity and ethical value of  magic, and to use the word only to stand for something essentially evil.  SWEDENBORG, we may note, in the course of a long passage from the work  from which I have already quoted, says that by \"magic\" is signified \"the  science of spiritual things\"(1) His position appears to be that there is  a genuine magic, or science of spiritual things, and a false magic, that  science perverted: a view of the matter which I propose here to adopt.  The word \"magic\" itself is derived"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12753"],[0,"The Legends of King Arthur and His Knights (#17)"],[1,"fast that they outsped their  company, and left them many miles behind; but riding still as rapidly as  they could go, at length their horses fell dead under them. Then being all  three on foot, and seeing the stag not far before them, very weary and  nigh spent--\"What shall we do,\" said King Arthur, \"for we are hard  bested?\" \"Let us go on afoot,\" said King Urience, \"till we can find some  lodging.\" At that they saw the stag lying upon the bank of a great lake,  with a hound springing at his throat, and many other hounds trooping  towards him. So, running forward, Arthur blew the death-note on his horn,  and slew the hart. Then lifting up his eyes he saw before him on the lake  a barge, all draped down to the water's edge, with silken folds and  curtains, which swiftly came towards him, and touched upon the sands; but  when he went up close and looked in, he saw no earthly creature. Then he  cried out to his companions, \"Sirs, come ye hither, and let us see what  there is in this ship.\" So they all three went in, and found it everywhere  throughout furnished, and hung with rich draperies of silk and gold.    By this time eventide had come, when suddenly a hundred torches were set  up on all sides of the barge, and gave a dazzling light, and at the same  time came forth twelve fair damsels, and saluted King Arthur by his name,  kneeling on their knees, and telling him that he was welcome, and should  have their noblest cheer, for which the king thanked them courteously.  Then did they lead him and his fellows to a splendid chamber, where was a  table spread with all the richest furniture, and costliest wines and  viands; and there they served them with all kinds of wines and meats, till  Arthur wondered at the splendour of the feast, declaring he had never in  his life supped better, or more royally. After supper they led him to  another chamber, than which he had never beheld a richer, where he was  left to rest. King Urience, also, and Sir Accolon were each conducted into  rooms of like magnificence. And so they all three fell asleep, and being  very weary slept deeply all that night.    [Illustration: Came forth twelve fair damsels, and saluted King Arthur by  his name.]    But when the morning broke, King Urience found himself in his own house in  Camelot, he knew not how; and Arthur awaking found himself in a dark  dungeon, and heard around him nothing but the groans of woful knights,  prisoners like himself. Then said King Arthur, \"Who are ye, thus groaning  and complaining?\" And some one answered him, \"Alas, we be all prisoners,  even twenty good knights, and some of us have lain here seven years--some  more--nor seen the light of day for all that time.\" \"For what cause?\" said  King Arthur. \"Know ye not then yourself?\" they answered--\"we will soon  tell you. The lord of this strong castle is Sir Damas, and is the falsest  and most traitorous knight that liveth; and he hath a younger brother, a  good and noble knight, whose name is Outzlake. This traitor Damas,  although passing rich, will give his brother nothing of his wealth, and  save what Outzlake keepeth to himself by force, he hath no share of the  inheritance. He owneth, nevertheless, one fair rich manor, whereupon he  liveth, loved of all men far and near. But Damas is as altogether hated as  his brother is beloved, for he is merciless and cowardly: and now for many  years there hath been war between these brothers, and Sir Outzlake  evermore defieth Damas to come forth and fight with him, body to body, for  the inheritance; and if he be too cowardly, to find some champion knight  that will fight for him. And Damas hath agreed to find some champion, but  never yet hath found a knight to take his evil cause in hand, or wager  battle for him. So with a strong band of men-at-arms he lieth ever in  ambush, and taketh captive every passing knight who may unwarily go near,  and bringeth him into this castle, and desireth him either to fight Sir  Outzlake, or to lie for evermore in durance. And thus hath he dealt with  all of us, for we all scorned to take up such a cause for such a false  foul knight--but rather one by one came here, where many a good knight  hath died of hunger and disease. But if one of us would fight, Sir Damas  would deliver all the rest.\"    \"God of his mercy send you deliverance,\" said King Arthur, and sat  turning in his mind how all these things should end, and how he might  himself gain freedom for so many noble hearts.    Anon there came a damsel to the king, saying, \"Sir if thou wilt fight for  my lord thou shalt be delivered out of prison, but else nevermore shalt  thou escape with thy life.\" \"Nay,\" said King Arthur, \"that is but a hard  choice, yet had I rather fight than die in prison, and if I may deliver  not myself alone, but all these others, I will do the battle.\" \"Yea,\" said  the damsel, \"it shall be even so.\" \"Then,\" said King Arthur, \"I am ready  now, if but I had a horse and armour.\" \"Fear not,\" said she, \"that shalt  thou have presently, and shalt lack nothing proper for the fight.\" \"Have I  not seen thee,\" said the king, \"at King Arthur's court? for it seemeth  that thy face is known to me.\" \"Nay,\" said the damsel, \"I was never there;  I am Sir Damas' daughter, and have never been but a day's journey from  this castle.\" But she spoke falsely, for she was one of the damsels of  Morgan le Fay, the great enchantress, who was King Arthur's half-sister.    When Sir Damas knew that there had been at length a knight found who would  fight for him, he sent for Arthur, and finding him a man so tall and  strong, and straight of limb, he was passingly well pleased, and made a  covenant with him, that he should fight unto the uttermost for his cause,  and that all the other knights should be delivered. And when they were  sworn to each other on the holy gospels, all those imprisoned knights were  straightway led forth and delivered, but abode there one and all to see  the battle.    In the meanwhile there had happened to Sir Accolon of Gaul a strange  adventure; for when he awoke from his deep sleep upon the silken barge, he  found himself upon the edge of a deep well, and in instant peril of  falling thereinto. Whereat, leaping up in great affright, he crossed  himself and cried aloud, \"May God preserve my lord King Arthur and King  Urience, for those damsels in the ship have betrayed us, and were  doubtless devils and no women; and if I may escape this misadventure, I  will certainly destroy them wheresoever I may find them.\" With that there  came to him a dwarf with a great mouth, and a flat nose, and saluted him,  saying that he came from Queen Morgan le Fay. \"And she greeteth you well,\"  said he, \"and biddeth you be strong of heart, for to-morrow you shall do  battle with a strange knight, and therefore she hath sent you here  Excalibur, King Arthur's sword, and the scabbard likewise. And she  desireth you as you do love her to fight this battle to the uttermost, and  without any mercy, as you have promised her you would fight when she  should require it of you; and she will make a rich queen for ever of any  damsel that shall bring her that knight's head with whom you are to  fight.\"    \"Well,\" said Sir Accolon, \"tell you my lady Queen Morgan, that I shall  hold to that I promised her, now that I have this sword--and,\" said he, \"I  suppose it was to bring about this battle that she made all these  enchantments by her craft.\" \"You have guessed rightly,\" said the dwarf,  and therewithal he left him.    Then came a knight and lady, and six squires, to Sir Accolon, and took him  to a manor house hard by, and gave him noble cheer; and the house belonged  to Sir Outzlake, the brother of Sir Damas, for so had Morgan le Fay  contrived with her enchantments. Now Sir Outzlake himself was at that time  sorely wounded and disabled, having been pierced through both his thighs  by a spear-thrust. When, therefore, Sir Damas sent down messengers to his  brother, bidding him make ready by to-morrow morning, and be in the field  to fight with a good knight, for that he had found a champion ready to do  battle at all points, Sir Outzlake was sorely annoyed and distressed, for  he knew he had small chance of victory, while yet he was disabled by his  wounds; notwithstanding, he determined to take the battle in hand,  although he was so weak that he must needs be lifted to his saddle. But  when Sir Accolon of Gaul heard this, he sent a message to Sir Outzlake  offering to take the battle in his stead, which cheered Sir Outzlake  mightily, who thanked Sir Accolon with all his heart, and joyfully  accepted him.    So, on the morrow, King Arthur was armed and well horsed, and asked Sir  Damas, \"When shall we go to the field?\" \"Sir,\" said Sir Damas, \"you shall  first hear mass.\" And when mass was done, there came a squire on a great  horse, and asked Sir Damas if his knight were ready, \"for our knight is  already in the field.\" Then King Arthur mounted on horseback, and there  around were all the knights, and barons, and people of the country; and  twelve of them were chosen to wait upon the two knights who were about to  fight. And as King Arthur sat on horseback, there came a damsel from  Morgan le Fay, and brought to him a sword, made like Excalibur, and a  scabbard also, and said to him, \"Morgan le Fay sendeth you here your sword  for her great love's sake.\" And the king thanked her, and believed it to  be as she said; but she traitorously deceived him, for both sword and  scabbard were counterfeit, brittle, and false, and the true sword  Excalibur was in the hands of Sir Accolon. Then, at the sound of a  trumpet, the champions set themselves on opposite sides of the field, and  giving rein and spur to their horses urged them to so great a speed that  each smiting the other in the middle of the shield, rolled his opponent to  the ground, both horse and man. Then starting up immediately, both drew  their swords and rushed swiftly"]]]
