There were  street riots. A party of thugs was hired to kill the popular Tribune.  Tiberius Gracchus was attacked when he entered the assembly and was  beaten to death. Ten years later his brother Gaius tried the experiment  of reforming a nation against the expressed wishes of a strong  privileged class. He passed a \"poor law\" which was meant to help the  destitute farmers. Eventually it made the greater part of the Roman  citizens into professional beggars.    He established colonies of destitute people in distant parts of the  empire, but these settlements failed to attract the right sort of  people. Before Gaius Gracchus could do more harm he too was murdered and  his followers were either killed or exiled. The first two reformers had  been gentlemen. The two who came after were of a very different stamp.  They were professional soldiers. One was called Marius. The name of the  other was Sulla. Both enjoyed a large personal following.    Sulla was the leader of the landowners. Marius, the victor in a great  battle at the foot of the Alps when the Teutons and the Cimbri had been  annihilated, was the popular hero of the disinherited freemen.    Now it happened in the year 88 B.C. that the Senate of Rome was greatly  disturbed by rumours that came from Asia. Mithridates, king of a country  along the shores of the Black Sea, and a Greek on his mother's side,  had seen the possibility of establishing a second Alexandrian Empire.  He began his campaign for world-domination with the murder of all Roman  citizens who happened to be in Asia Minor, men, women and children.  Such an act, of course, meant war. The Senate equipped an army to march  against the King of Pontus and punish him for his crime. But who was to  be commander-in-chief? \"Sulla,\" said the Senate, \"because he is Consul.\"  \"Marius,\" said the mob, \"because he has been Consul five times and  because he is the champion of our rights.\"    Possession is nine points of the law. Sulla happened to be in actual  command of the army. He went west to defeat Mithridates and Marius fled  to Africa. There he waited until he heard that Sulla had crossed into  Asia. He then returned to Italy, gathered a motley crew of malcontents,  marched on Rome and entered the city with his professional highwaymen,  spent five days and five nights, slaughtering the enemies of the  Senatorial party, got himself elected Consul and promptly died from the  excitement of the last fortnight.    There followed four years of disorder. Then Sulla, having defeated  Mithridates, announced that he was ready to return to Rome and settle  a few old scores of his own. He was as good as his word. For weeks his  soldiers were busy executing those of their fellow citizens who were  suspected of democratic sympathies. One day they got hold of a young  fellow who had been often seen in the company of Marius. They were going  to hang him when some one interfered. \"The boy is too young,\" he said,  and they let him go. His name was Julius Caesar. You shall meet him  again on the next page.    As for Sulla, he became \"Dictator,\" which meant sole and supreme ruler  of all the Roman possessions. He ruled Rome for four years, and he died  quietly in his bed, having spent the last year of his life tenderly  raising his cabbages, as was the custom of so many Romans who had spent  a lifetime killing their fellow-men.    But conditions did not grow better. On the contrary, they grew worse.  Another general, Gnaeus Pompeius, or Pompey, a close friend of Sulla,  went east to renew the war against the ever troublesome Mithridates. He  drove that energetic potentate into the mountains where Mithridates took  poison and killed himself, well knowing what fate awaited him as a  Roman captive. Next he re-established the authority of Rome over Syria,  destroyed Jerusalem, roamed through western Asia, trying to revive the  myth of Alexander the Great, and at last (in the year 62) returned to  Rome with a dozen ship-loads of defeated Kings and Princes and Generals,  all of whom were forced to march in the triumphal procession of this  enormously popular Roman who presented his city with the sum of forty  million dollars in plunder.    It was necessary that the government of Rome be placed in the hands of  a strong man. Only a few months before, the town had almost fallen  into the hands of a good-for-nothing young aristocrat by the name of  Catiline, who had gambled away his money and hoped to reimburse himself  for his losses by a little plundering. Cicero, a public-spirited lawyer,  had discovered the plot, had warned the Senate, and had forced Catiline  to flee. But there were other young men with similar ambitions and it  was no time for idle talk.    Pompey organised a triumvirate which was to take charge of affairs. He  became the leader of this Vigilante Committee. Gaius Julius Caesar, who  had made a reputation for himself as governor of Spain, was the second  in command. The third was an indifferent sort of person by the name of  Crassus. He had been elected because he was incredibly rich, having been  a successful contractor of war supplies. He soon went upon an expedition  against the Parthians and was killed.    As for Caesar, who was by far the ablest of the three, he decided that  he needed a little more military glory to become a popular hero. He  crossed the Alps and conquered that part of the world which is now  called France. Then he hammered a solid wooden bridge across the Rhine  and invaded the land of the wild Teutons. Finally he took ship and  visited England. Heaven knows where he might have ended if he had not  been forced to return to Italy. Pompey, so he was informed, had been  appointed dictator for life. This of course meant that Caesar was to  be placed on the list of the \"retired officers,\" and the idea did not  appeal to him. He remembered that he had begun life as a follower of  Marius. He decided to teach the Senators and their \"dictator\" another  lesson. He crossed the Rubicon River which separated the province of  Cis-alpine Gaul from Italy. Everywhere he was received as the \"friend of  the people.\" Without difficulty Caesar entered Rome and Pompey fled to  Greece Caesar followed him and defeated his followers near Pharsalus.  Pompey sailed across the Mediterranean and escaped to Egypt. When he  landed he was murdered by order of young king Ptolemy. A few days later  Caesar arrived. He found himself caught in a trap. Both the Egyptians  and the Roman garrison which had remained faithful to Pompey, attacked  his camp.    Fortune was with Caesar. He succeeded in setting fire to the Egyptian  fleet. Incidentally the sparks of the burning vessels fell on the  roof of the famous library of Alexandria (which was just off the water  front,) and destroyed it. Next he attacked the Egyptian army, drove  the soldiers into the Nile, drowned Ptolemy, and established a new  government under Cleopatra, the sister of the late king. Just then word  reached him that Pharnaces, the son and heir of Mithridates, had gone  on the war-path. Caesar marched northward, defeated Pharnaces in a war  which lasted five days, sent word of his victory to Rome in the famous  sentence \"veni, vidi, vici,\" which is Latin for \"I came, I saw, I  conquered,\" and returned to Egypt where he fell desperately in love with  Cleopatra, who followed him to Rome when he returned to take charge of  the government, in the year 46. He marched at the head of not less than  four different victory-parades, having won four different campaigns.    Then Caesar appeared in the Senate to report upon his adventures, and  the grateful Senate made him \"dictator\" for ten years. It was a fatal  step.    The new dictator made serious attempts to reform the Roman state.  He made it possible for freemen to become members of the Senate. He  conferred the rights of citizenship upon distant communities as had been  done in the early days of Roman history. He permitted \"foreigners\" to  exercise influence upon the government. He reformed the administration  of the distant provinces which certain aristocratic families had come to  regard as their private possessions. In short he did many things for  the good of the majority of the people but which made him thoroughly  unpopular with the most powerful men in the state. Half a hundred young  aristocrats formed a plot \"to save the Republic.\" On the Ides of March  (the fifteenth of March according to that new calendar which Caesar had  brought with him from Egypt) Caesar was murdered when he entered the  Senate. Once more Rome was without a master.    There were two men who tried to continue the tradition of Caesar's  glory. One was Antony, his former secretary. The other was Octavian,  Caesar's grand-nephew and heir to his estate. Octavian remained in  Rome, but Antony went to Egypt to be near Cleopatra with whom he too had  fallen in love, as seems to have been the habit of Roman generals.    A war broke out between the two. In the battle of Actium, Octavian  defeated Antony. Antony killed himself and Cleopatra was left alone to  face the enemy. She tried very hard to make Octavian her third Roman  conquest. When she saw that she could make no impression upon this very  proud aristocrat, she killed herself, and Egypt became a Roman province.    As for Octavian, he was a very wise young man and he did not repeat the  mistake of his famous uncle. He knew how people will shy at words. He  was very modest in his demands when he returned to Rome. He did not want  to be a \"dictator.\" He would be entirely satisfied with the title of  \"the Honourable.\" But when the Senate, a few years later, addressed him  as Augustus--the Illustrious--he did not object and a few years later  the man in the street called him Caesar, or Kaiser, while the soldiers,  accustomed to regard Octavian as their Commander-in-chief"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/766"],[0,"David Copperfield (#16)"],[1," was, who than rang a bell, and called  out, 'William! show the coffee-room!' upon which a waiter came running  out of a kitchen on the opposite side of the yard to show it, and seemed  a good deal surprised when he was only to show it to me.    It was a large long room with some large maps in it. I doubt if I could  have felt much stranger if the maps had been real foreign countries, and  I cast away in the middle of them. I felt it was taking a liberty to  sit down, with my cap in my hand, on the corner of the chair nearest the  door; and when the waiter laid a cloth on purpose for me, and put a set  of castors on it, I think I must have turned red all over with modesty.    He brought me some chops, and vegetables, and took the covers off in  such a bouncing manner that I was afraid I must have given him some  offence. But he greatly relieved my mind by putting a chair for me at  the table, and saying, very affably, 'Now, six-foot! come on!'    I thanked him, and took my seat at the board; but found it extremely  difficult to handle my knife and fork with anything like dexterity,  or to avoid splashing myself with the gravy, while he was standing  opposite, staring so hard, and making me blush in the most dreadful  manner every time I caught his eye. After watching me into the second  chop, he said:    'There's half a pint of ale for you. Will you have it now?'    I thanked him and said, 'Yes.' Upon which he poured it out of a jug  into a large tumbler, and held it up against the light, and made it look  beautiful.    'My eye!' he said. 'It seems a good deal, don't it?'    'It does seem a good deal,' I answered with a smile. For it was quite  delightful to me, to find him so pleasant. He was a twinkling-eyed,  pimple-faced man, with his hair standing upright all over his head; and  as he stood with one arm a-kimbo, holding up the glass to the light with  the other hand, he looked quite friendly.    'There was a gentleman here, yesterday,' he said--'a stout gentleman, by  the name of Topsawyer--perhaps you know him?'    'No,' I said, 'I don't think--'    'In breeches and gaiters, broad-brimmed hat, grey coat, speckled  choker,' said the waiter.    'No,' I said bashfully, 'I haven't the pleasure--'    'He came in here,' said the waiter, looking at the light through the  tumbler, 'ordered a glass of this ale--WOULD order it--I told him  not--drank it, and fell dead. It was too old for him. It oughtn't to be  drawn; that's the fact.'    I was very much shocked to hear of this melancholy accident, and said I  thought I had better have some water.    'Why you see,' said the waiter, still looking at the light through the  tumbler, with one of his eyes shut up, 'our people don't like things  being ordered and left. It offends 'em. But I'll drink it, if you like.  I'm used to it, and use is everything. I don't think it'll hurt me, if I  throw my head back, and take it off quick. Shall I?'    I replied that he would much oblige me by drinking it, if he thought  he could do it safely, but by no means otherwise. When he did throw his  head back, and take it off quick, I had a horrible fear, I confess,  of seeing him meet the fate of the lamented Mr. Topsawyer, and fall  lifeless on the carpet. But it didn't hurt him. On the contrary, I  thought he seemed the fresher for it.    'What have we got here?' he said, putting a fork into my dish. 'Not  chops?'    'Chops,' I said.    'Lord bless my soul!' he exclaimed, 'I didn't know they were chops. Why,  a chop's the very thing to take off the bad effects of that beer! Ain't  it lucky?'    So he took a chop by the bone in one hand, and a potato in the other,  and ate away with a very good appetite, to my extreme satisfaction.  He afterwards took another chop, and another potato; and after that,  another chop and another potato. When we had done, he brought me a  pudding, and having set it before me, seemed to ruminate, and to become  absent in his mind for some moments.    'How's the pie?' he said, rousing himself.    'It's a pudding,' I made answer.    'Pudding!' he exclaimed. 'Why, bless me, so it is! What!' looking at it  nearer. 'You don't mean to say it's a batter-pudding!'    'Yes, it is indeed.'    'Why, a batter-pudding,' he said, taking up a table-spoon, 'is my  favourite pudding! Ain't that lucky? Come on, little 'un, and let's see  who'll get most.'    The waiter certainly got most. He entreated me more than once to come in  and win, but what with his table-spoon to my tea-spoon, his dispatch to  my dispatch, and his appetite to my appetite, I was left far behind at  the first mouthful, and had no chance with him. I never saw anyone enjoy  a pudding so much, I think; and he laughed, when it was all gone, as if  his enjoyment of it lasted still.    Finding him so very friendly and companionable, it was then that I asked  for the pen and ink and paper, to write to Peggotty. He not only brought  it immediately, but was good enough to look over me while I wrote the  letter. When I had finished it, he asked me where I was going to school.    I said, 'Near London,' which was all I knew.    'Oh! my eye!' he said, looking very low-spirited, 'I am sorry for that.'    'Why?' I asked him.    'Oh, Lord!' he said, shaking his head, 'that's the school where they  broke the boy's ribs--two ribs--a little boy he was. I should say he  was--let me see--how old are you, about?'    I told him between eight and nine.    'That's just his age,' he said. 'He was eight years and six months old  when they broke his first rib; eight years and eight months old when  they broke his second, and did for him.'    I could not disguise from myself, or from the waiter, that this was an  uncomfortable coincidence, and inquired how it was done. His answer was  not cheering to my spirits, for it consisted of two dismal words, 'With  whopping.'    The blowing of the coach-horn in the yard was a seasonable diversion,  which made me get up and hesitatingly inquire, in the mingled pride and  diffidence of having a purse (which I took out of my pocket), if there  were anything to pay.    'There's a sheet of letter-paper,' he returned. 'Did you ever buy a  sheet of letter-paper?'    I could not remember that I ever had.    'It's dear,' he said, 'on account of the duty. Threepence. That's  the way we're taxed in this country. There's nothing else, except the  waiter. Never mind the ink. I lose by that.'    'What should you--what should I--how much ought I to--what would it be  right to pay the waiter, if you please?' I stammered, blushing.    'If I hadn't a family, and that family hadn't the cowpock,' said the  waiter, 'I wouldn't take a sixpence. If I didn't support a aged pairint,  and a lovely sister,'--here the waiter was greatly agitated--'I wouldn't  take a farthing. If I had a good place, and was treated well here, I  should beg acceptance of a trifle, instead of taking of it. But I live  on broken wittles--and I sleep on the coals'--here the waiter burst into  tears.    I was very much concerned for his misfortunes, and felt that any  recognition short of ninepence would be mere brutality and hardness of  heart. Therefore I gave him one of my three bright shillings, which he  received with much humility and veneration, and spun up with his thumb,  directly afterwards, to try the goodness of.    It was a little disconcerting to me, to find, when I was being helped  up behind the coach, that I was supposed to have eaten all the dinner  without any assistance. I discovered this, from overhearing the lady in  the bow-window say to the guard, 'Take care of that child, George, or  he'll burst!' and from observing that the women-servants who were about  the place came out to look and giggle at me as a young phenomenon. My  unfortunate friend the waiter, who had quite recovered his spirits, did  not appear to be disturbed by this, but joined in the general admiration  without being at all confused. If I had any doubt of him, I suppose  this half awakened it; but I am inclined to believe that with the simple  confidence of a child, and the natural reliance of a child upon superior  years (qualities I am very sorry any children should prematurely change  for worldly wisdom), I had no serious mistrust of him on the whole, even  then.    I felt it rather hard, I must own, to be made, without deserving it, the  subject of jokes between the coachman and guard as to the coach drawing  heavy behind, on account of my sitting there, and as to the greater  expediency of my travelling by waggon. The story of my supposed appetite  getting wind among the outside passengers, they were merry upon it  likewise; and asked me whether I was going to be paid for, at school,  as two brothers or three, and whether I was contracted for, or went upon  the regular terms; with other pleasant questions. But the worst of  it was, that I knew I should be ashamed to eat anything, when an  opportunity offered, and that, after a rather light dinner, I should  remain hungry all night--for I had left my cakes behind, at the hotel,  in my hurry. My apprehensions were realized. When we stopped for supper  I couldn't muster courage to take any, though I should have liked it  very much, but sat by the fire and said I didn't want anything. This did  not save me from more jokes, either; for a husky-voiced gentleman with  a rough face, who had been eating out of a sandwich-box nearly all the  way, except when he had been drinking out of a bottle, said I was like  a boa-constrictor who took enough at one meal to last him a long time;  after which, he actually brought a rash out upon himself with boiled  beef.    We had started from Yarmouth at three o'clock in the afternoon, and we  were due in London about eight next morning. It was Mid-summer weather,  and the evening was very pleasant. When we passed through a village, I  pictured to myself what the insides of the houses were like, and what  the inhabitants were about; and when boys came running"]]]
