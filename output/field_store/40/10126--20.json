According to all  observations, it is certain that the cause of this phenomenon is not a  single etiological condition, but that it is the sum of a number of  influences which act upon the human race and produce their travages in  the mental and moral life of our patients. The conditions which give  rise to this increase of insanity may be looked for in the manner in  which modern civilization influences mankind, in its development and  culture, in the family and in the school-room, in its views of life and  habits; also in the manner in which civilization forces a man to fight a  heavier and harder battle for pleasure and possessions, power and  knowledge, and causes him to go even beyond his powers of endurance.    More than even civilization itself, are at fault those pernicious  abnormities, rare monstrosities, which are transmitted from generation  to generation, or are also often newly developed and appear to belong to  our civilization. If we want to prevent the increase of insanity, we  must endeavor to do away with these monstrosities and eccentricities  from our social life which remove mankind more and more, in a pernicious  manner, from its natural development and from the normal conditions of  moral and physical life; we must endeavor to kill these poisonous  offshoots of pseudo civilization, which are the enemies of the normal  existence of man. It is necessary to liberate the individual, as well as  the entire society of modern times, from the potentiated egotism which  spurs man on in overhaste, and in all departments of mental and physical  life, to a feverish activity, and then leads to an early senile decay of  both body and mind; from that terrible materialism which causes the  modern individual in every class of society to find satisfaction in over  excited taste and ingenious luxury. It is necessary to strengthen more  than has been done heretofore the young, by means of their education, in  their physical development, and at the same time to diminish, in proper  proportion, the amount of mental over-exertion; and finally it is  necessary to fight against, to do away with, those habits of modern  society-life which have a pernicious influence upon the physical as well  as the mental and moral organization of man. And of these latter, there  is none so lasting in its effects, none so harmful to the physical as  well as moral life, as the abuse of intoxicating liquors.    Intemperance is an inexhaustible source of the development and increase  of insanity. It demands our undivided attention, not only on account of  its existing relation, but particularly because intemperance, among all  the factors which aid in the increase of insanity, can best be  diminished, and its influence weakened, through the will of the single  individual, as well as of society as a whole. The relation between  intemperance and insanity is so definite and clear, that it is not  necessary to adduce proofs of this fact. I will not refer to the  writings of the older authors, such as Rush, in America; Hutchison,  Macnish, Carpenter, and others, in England; Huss and Dahl, in Sweden;  Ramaer, in Holland; Esquirol, Pinel Brierre de Boismont, Morel, and  others, in France; Flemming, Jameson, Roller, Griesinger, and others, in  Germany. I could name a much larger number of the greatest modern  authorities on insanity, who are all unanimous in their opinion that the  increase of intemperance (alcoholism) produces a corresponding increase  of insanity. Of especial interest is this fact in those countries in  which the consumption of concentrated alcohol, and particularly in the  form of whiskies distilled from potatoes and corn, has only in later  years become general. Thus Lunier has shown the number of alcoholic  insane increased by ten per cent. in those departments in which more  whisky and less wine is consumed.    In Italy a similar result has been reached by investigation; and in that  country (according to Kanti, Sormani, Vesay, Rareri, Castiglione, Ferri,  and others) the frequency of insanity caused by the abuse of alcohol  stands in an unmistakable relation to the consumption of alcohol in  certain provinces of Italy.    In a discussion at one of the meetings (1876) of the London  Medico-Psychological Society, the general opinion of the members was,  that intemperance is the most fruitful source of the increase of  insanity, even when no other etiological element could be found, and  alcohol had to be looked upon as the sole cause of the mental disease.  Maudsley laid especial stress upon the observation, that intemperance,  without hereditary predisposition, was one of the most powerful agencies  in the production of aberration of the mind. Even Beckwith, who could  not coincide with others as to the great importance of intemperance as  an etiological element, says distinctly, that intemperance was, by far,  the most potent of all removable causes of mental disease.    In comparing the number of drinking saloons in the different provinces  of the kingdom of Prussia with the number of insane, both in public  institutions and in private families, as gleaned from the census report  of 1871, I was enabled to show conclusively, that everywhere, where the  number of drinking places, i.e., the consumption of alcohol, was  greatest, the number of insane was also largest. Without doubt, to my  mind it is in alcohol that we must look for and will find the most  potent cause of the development and spread of mental diseases.    As is well known, alcohol acts as a disturbing element upon the nerve  centers, even if it has only once been imbibed in excessive quantity. In  consequence of the acute disturbance of circulation and nutrition an  acute intoxication takes place, which may range from a slight excitation  to a complete loss of consciousness. After habitual abuse of alcohol,  the functional disturbances of the brain and spinal cord became constant  and disappear the less, as in the central organs degenerative processes  are more and more developed, processes which lead to congestions and  hemorrhagic effusions in the meninges and in the brain itself, to  softening or hardening, and finally to disappearance of the brain  substance. These degenerations of the nervous system give rise to a  progressive decay of all intellectual and also, more especially, of the  ethical functions, a decay which presents the phenomena of feeble  mindedness, complicated with a large number of sensational and motor  disturbances, and gradually ends in complete idiocy.    The number of those mental disturbances which are caused by alcohol  intoxication is a very considerable one. We do not err if we assert that  from 20 to 25 per cent. of all mental diseases stand in a direct or  indirect relation to the evil consequences of intemperance in the use of  intoxicating liquors. This is the opinion of a large number of  authorities on mental diseases in all countries. Habitual intemperance  leads to severe (psychical?) lesions (of the nervous system) which may  show themselves in the different forms of insanity, but express  themselves chiefly as mental weakness, not only in persons whose nervous  system was weakened through inherited or acquired defects, but also in  those whose mental organization was intact. In many other cases we see  less complete forms of insanity and more indistinct psychological  disturbances and neuroses, and among the latter epilepsy demands  particular attention.    An investigation among the patients in the insane department of the  Berlin Charite Hospital, in charge of Prof. Westfahl, which was lately  carried on by Dr. T. Galle (Uber die Beziehunger des Alcoholismus zur  Epilepsie. Inaug. Dissert. 1881, Berlin), showed that among 607 patients  who had entered the ward as epileptics or epileptic insane, 150 = 24.7  per cent. had been addicted to drink; 133 before, and 17 after the  disease had shown itself; further, that of 1572 patients with delirium  tremens, alcoholism, alcoholic dementia, and ebrietas, 243, or 15.4 per  cent., were epileptic; and that in 221 intemperance was present before  the outbreak of epilepsy; finally, that among 2679 patients which  entered the department in six and a half years, 393, or 18 per cent.,  were inebriates and epileptics. Among 128 epileptics which I had  occasion to note in the receiving institute, Plotseurie, 21 per cent.  were drunkards and 20 per cent. were the offspring of intemperate  parents.    If the list of injuries which intemperance, as we have seen, does  directly to the mental life of man is a very considerable one, the  baneful effect which is produced indirectly, by the intemperance of  parents, upon the mental constitution of their progeny is surely just as  great and disastrous. The children of intemperate parents frequently  become drunkards themselves; they have inherited a degeneration of the  vitiated constitution, and carry the stamp of this degeneration within  themselves. The offspring of drunkards are not only weakly and sickly,  and die early, especially of diseases of the brain, but, as Dahl, Morel,  Howe, Beach, and others have shown, they are frequently born idiotic, or  show early signs of insanity. Under the influence of alcohol, the  individual constitution of the drinker becomes lowered and depraved,  and, according to the law of inheritance, is transmitted through the  progeny to the race.    Prof. Bollinger, the latest writer on inheritance of disease (Stuttgart,  1882--Cotta--Uber Dererbung von Krankheiten), names alcoholism among the  transient abnormal conditions which, during conception, exert their  influence, so that children of intemperate parents acquire pathological,  and especially neuro-pathological, dispositions. Intemperance, says this  author, in its acute, as well as in its chronic form, causes frequently  pathological changes in the nervous system, and thus may the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11352"],[0,"Germany and the Next War (#17)"],[1," cannot yet be determined  whether we can keep off this vast flood by pacific precautions. It is  not improbable that the question of Germanic or Slavonic supremacy will  be once more decided by the sword. The probability of such a conflict  grows stronger as we become more lax in pacific measures of defence, and  show less determination to protect the German soil at all costs.    The further duty of supporting the Germans in foreign countries in their  struggle for existence and of thus keeping them loyal to their  nationality, is one from which, in our direct interests, we cannot  withdraw. The isolated groups of Germans abroad greatly benefit our  trade, since by preference they obtain their goods from Germany; but  they may also be useful to us politically, as we discover in America.  The American-Germans have formed a political alliance with the Irish,  and thus united, constitute a power in the State, with which the  Government must reckon.    Finally, from the point of view of civilization, it is imperative to  preserve the German spirit, and by so doing to establish _foci_ of  universal culture.    Even if we succeed in guarding our possessions in the East and West, and  in preserving the German nationality in its present form throughout the  world, we shall not be able to maintain our present position, powerful  as it is, in the great competition with the other Powers, if we are  contented to restrict ourselves to our present sphere of power, while  the surrounding countries are busily extending their dominions. If we  wish to compete further with them, a policy which our population and our  civilization both entitle and compel us to adopt, we must not hold back  in the hard struggle for the sovereignty of the world.    Lord Rosebery, speaking at the Royal Colonial Institute on March 1,  1893, expressed himself as follows: \"It is said that our Empire is  already large enough and does not need expansion.... We shall have to  consider not what we want now, but what we want in the future.... We  have to remember that it is part of our responsibility and heritage to  take care that the world, so far as it can be moulded by us, should  receive the Anglo-Saxon and not another character.\" [D]    [Footnote D: This passage is quoted in the book of the French ex-Minister  Hanotaux, \"Fashoda et le partage de l'Afrique.\"]    That is a great and proud thought which the Englishman then expressed.    If we count the nations who speak English at the present day, and if we  survey the countries which acknowledge the rule of England, we must  admit that he is justified from the English point of view. He does not  here contemplate an actual world-sovereignty, but the predominance of  the English spirit is proclaimed in plain language.    England has certainly done a great work of civilization, especially from  the material aspect; but her work is one-sided. All the colonies which  are directly subject to English rule are primarily exploited in the  interest of English industries and English capital. The work of  civilization, which England undeniably has carried out among them, has  always been subordinated to this idea; she has never justified her  sovereignty by training up a free and independent population, and by  transmitting to the subject peoples the blessings of an independent  culture of their own. With regard to those colonies which enjoy  self-government, and are therefore more or less free republics, as  Canada, Australia, South Africa, it is very questionable whether they  will permanently retain any trace of the English spirit. They are not  only growing States, but growing nations, and it seems uncertain at the  present time whether England will be able to include them permanently in  the Empire, to make them serviceable to English industries, or even to  secure that the national character is English. Nevertheless, it is a  great and proud ambition that is expressed in Lord Rosebery's words, and  it testifies to a supreme national self-confidence.    The French regard with no less justifiable satisfaction the work done by  them in the last forty years. In 1909 the former French Minister,  Hanotaux, gave expression to this pride in the following words: \"Ten  years ago the work of founding our colonial Empire was finished. France  has claimed her rank among the four great Powers. She is at home in  every quarter of the globe. French is spoken, and will continue to be  spoken, in Africa, Asia, America, Oceania. Seeds of sovereignty are sown  in all parts of the world. They will prosper under the protection of  Heaven.\" [E]    [Footnote E: Hanotaux, \"Fashoda et le partage de l'Afrique.\"]    The same statesman criticized, with ill-concealed hatred, the German  policy: \"It will be for history to decide what has been the leading  thought of Germany and her Government during the complicated disputes  under which the partition of Africa and the last phase of French  colonial policy were ended. We may assume that at first the adherents to  Bismarck's policy saw with satisfaction how France embarked on distant  and difficult undertakings, which would fully occupy the attention of  the country and its Government for long years to come. Nevertheless, it  is not certain that this calculation has proved right in the long-run,  since Germany ultimately trod the same road, and, somewhat late, indeed,  tried to make up for lost time. If that country deliberately abandoned  colonial enterprise to others, it cannot be surprised if these have  obtained the best shares.\"    This French criticism is not altogether unfair. It must be admitted with  mortification and envy that the nation vanquished in 1870, whose vital  powers seemed exhausted, which possessed no qualification for  colonization from want of men to colonize, as is best seen in Algeria,  has yet created the second largest colonial Empire in the world, and  prides herself on being a World Power, while the conqueror of Gravelotte  and Sedan in this respect lags far behind her, and only recently, in the  Morocco controversy, yielded to the unjustifiable pretensions of France  in a way which, according to universal popular sentiment, was unworthy  alike of the dignity and the interests of Germany.    The openly declared claims of England and France are the more worthy of  attention since an _entente_ prevails between the two countries. In the  face of these claims the German nation, from the standpoint of its  importance to civilization, is fully entitled not only to demand a place  in the sun, as Prince Buelow used modestly to express it, but to aspire  to an adequate share in the sovereignty of the world far beyond the  limits of its present sphere of influence. But we can only reach this  goal, by so amply securing our position in Europe, that it can never  again be questioned. Then only we need no longer fear that we shall be  opposed by stronger opponents whenever we take part in international  politics. We shall then be able to exercise our forces freely in fair  rivalry with the other World Powers, and secure to German nationality  and German spirit throughout the globe that high esteem which is due to  them.    Such an expansion of power, befitting our importance, is not merely a  fanciful scheme--it will soon appear as a political necessity.    The fact has already been mentioned that, owing to political union and  improved economic conditions during the last forty years, an era of  great prosperity has set in, and that German industries have been widely  extended and German trade has kept pace with them. The extraordinary  capacity of the German nation for trade and navigation has once more  brilliantly asserted itself. The days of the Hanseatic League have  returned. The labour resources of our nation increase continuously. The  increase of the population in the German Empire alone amounts yearly to  a million souls, and these have, to a large extent, found remunerative  industrial occupation.    There is, however, a reverse side to this picture of splendid  development. We are absolutely dependent on foreign countries for the  import of raw materials, and to a considerable extent also for the sale  of our own manufactures. We even obtain a part of our necessaries of  life from abroad. Then, again, we have not the assured markets which  England possesses in her colonies. Our own colonies are unable to take  much of our products, and the great foreign economic spheres try to  close their doors to outsiders, especially Germans, in order to  encourage their own industries, and to make themselves independent of  other countries. The livelihood of our working classes directly depends  on the maintenance and expansion of our export trade. It is a question  of life and death for us to keep open our oversea commerce. We shall  very soon see ourselves compelled to find for our growing population  means of life other than industrial employment. It is out of the  question that this latter can keep pace permanently with the increase of  population. Agriculture will employ a small part of this increase, and  home settlements may afford some relief. But no remunerative occupation  will ever be found within the borders of the existing German Empire for  the whole population, however favourable our international relations. We  shall soon, therefore, be faced by the question, whether we wish to  surrender the coming generations to foreign countries, as formerly in  the hour of our decline, or whether we wish to take steps to find them a  home in our own German colonies, and so retain them for the fatherland.  There is no possible doubt how this question must be answered. If the  unfortunate course of our history has hitherto prevented us from  building a colonial Empire, it is our duty to make up for lost time, and  at once to construct a fleet which, in defiance of all hostile Powers,  may keep our sea communications open.    We have long underestimated the importance of"]]]
