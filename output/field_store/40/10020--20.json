It was with more  brevity that he commended Drusus, and his address in quelling the  sedition of Illyricum, but more cordially withal, and in language  altogether sincere; and even to the Pannonian legions he extended all  the concessions made by Germanicus to his own.    There was this year an admission of new rites, by the establishment  of another College of Priests, one sacred to the deity of Augustus; as  formerly Titus Tatius, to preserve the religious rites of the Sabines,  had founded the fraternity of Titian Priests. To fill the society,  one-and-twenty, the most considerable Romans were drawn by lot, and  to them added Tiberius, Drusus, Claudius, and Germanicus. The games in  honour of Augustus began then first to be embroiled by emulation among  the players, and the strife of parties in their behalf. Augustus had  countenanced these players and their art, in complaisance to Maecenas,  who was mad in love with Bathyllus the comedian; nor to such favourite  amusements of the populace had he any aversion himself; he rather judged  it an acceptable courtesy to mingle with the multitude in these their  popular pleasures. Different was the temper of Tiberius, different  his politics: to severer manners, however, he durst not yet reduce the  people, so many years indulged in licentious gaieties.    In the consulship of Drusus Caesar and Caius Norbanus, a triumph was  decreed to Germanicus, while the war still subsisted. He was preparing  with all diligence to prosecute it the following summer; but began much  sooner by a sudden irruption early in the spring into the territories of  the Cattans: an anticipation of the campaign, which proceeded from the  hopes given him of dissension amongst the enemy, caused by the opposite  parties of Arminius and Segestes; two men signally known to the Romans  upon different accounts; the last for his firm faith, the first for  faith violated. Arminius was the incendiary of Germany; but by Segestes  had been given repeated warnings of an intended revolt, particularly  during the festival immediately preceding the insurrection: he had even  advised Varus \"to secure himself and Arminius, and all the other chiefs;  for that the multitude, thus bereft of their leaders, would dare to  attempt nothing; and Varus have time to distinguish crimes and such  as committed none.\" But by his own fate, and the sudden violence of  Arminius, Varus fell. Segestes, though by the weight and unanimity of  his nation he was forced into the war, yet remained at constant variance  with Arminius: a domestic quarrel too heightened their hate, as Arminius  had carried away the daughter of Segestes, already betrothed to another;  and the same relations, which amongst friends prove bonds of tenderness,  were fresh stimulations of wrath to an obnoxious son and an offended  father.    Upon these encouragements, Germanicus to the command of Caecina  committed four legions, five thousand auxiliaries, and some bands of  Germans, dwellers on this side the Rhine, drawn suddenly together;  he led himself as many legions with double the number of allies, and  erecting a fort in Mount Taunus, [Footnote: Near Homburg.] upon the old  foundations of one raised by his father, rushed full march against the  Cattans; having behind him left Lucius Apronius, to secure the ways from  the fury of inundations: for as the roads were then dry and the rivers  low, events in that climate exceeding rare, he had without check  expedited his march; but against his return apprehended the violence of  rains and floods. Upon the Cattans he fell with such surprise, that all  the weak through sex or age were instantly taken or slaughtered: their  youth, by swimming over the Adrana, [Footnote: Eder.] escaped, and  attempted to force the Romans from building a bridge to follow them, but  by dint of arrows and engines were repulsed; and then, having in vain  tried to gain terms of peace, some submitted to Germanicus; the rest  abandoned their villages and dwellings, and dispersed themselves in the  woods. Mattium, [Footnote: Maden.] the capital of the nation, he burnt,  ravaged all the open country, and bent his march to the Rhine; nor durst  the enemy harass his rear, an usual practice of theirs, when sometimes  they fly more through craft than affright. The Cheruscans indeed were  addicted to assist the Cattans, but terrified from attempting it by  Caecina, who moved about with his forces from place to place; and by  routing the Marsians who had dared to engage him, restrained all their  efforts.    Soon after arrived deputies from Segestes, praying relief against  the combination and violence of his countrymen, by whom he was held  besieged; as more powerful amongst them than his was the credit of  Arminius, since it was he who had advised the war. The genius this of  barbarians, to judge that men are to be trusted in proportion as they  are fierce, and in public commotions ever to prefer the most resolute.  To the other deputies Segestes had added Segimundus, his son; but the  young man faltered a while, as his own heart accused him; for that  the year when Germany revolted, he, who had been by the Romans created  Priest of the altar of the Ubians, rent the sacerdotal tiara and fled to  the revolters: yet, encouraged by the Roman clemency, he undertook the  execution of his father's orders, was himself graciously received, and  then conducted with a guard to the frontiers of Gaul. Germanicus led  back his army to the relief of Segestes, and was rewarded with success.  He fought the besiegers, and rescued him with a great train of his  relations and followers; amongst them too were ladies of illustrious  rank, particularly the wife of Arminius, the same who was the daughter  of Segestes: a lady more of the spirit of her husband than that of her  father; a spirit so unsubdued, that from her eyes captivity forced not  a tear, nor from her lips a breath in the style of a supplicant: not a  motion of her hands, nor a look escaped her; but, fast across her breast  she held her arms, and upon her heavy womb her eyes were immovably  fixed. There were likewise carried Roman spoils taken at the slaughter  of Varus and his army, and then divided as prey amongst many of those  who were now prisoners: at the same time appeared Segestes, of superior  stature; and from a confidence in his good understanding with the  Romans, undaunted. In this manner he spoke:    \"It is not the first day this, that to the Roman People I have approved  my faith and adherence: from the moment I was by the deified Augustus  presented with the freedom of the city, I have continued by your  interest to choose my friends, by your interest to denominate my  enemies; from no hate of mine to my native country (for odious are  traitors even to the party they embrace), but because the same measures  were equally conducing to the benefit of the Romans and of the Germans;  and I was rather for peace than war. For this reason to Varus, the then  General, I applied, with an accusation against Arminius, who from me had  ravished my daughter, and with you violated the faith of leagues: but  growing impatient with the slowness and inactivity of Varus, and well  apprised how little security was to be hoped from the laws, I pressed  him to seize myself, and Arminius, and his accomplices: witness that  fatal night, to me I wish it had been the last! more to be lamented than  defended are the sad events which followed. I moreover cast Arminius  into irons, and was myself cast into irons by his faction; and as soon  as to you, Caesar, I could apply, you see I prefer old engagements to  present violence, and tranquillity to combustions, with no view of  my own to interest or reward, but to banish from me the imputation  of perfidiousness. For the German nation, too, I would thus become a  mediator, if peradventure they will choose rather to repent than be  destroyed: for my son, I intreat you, have mercy upon his youth, and  pardon his error; that my daughter is your prisoner by force I own: in  your breast it wholly lies under which character you will treat her,  whether as one by Arminius impregnated, or by me begotten.\" The answer  of Germanicus was gracious: he promised indemnity to his children and  kindred, and to himself a safe retreat in one of the old provinces; then  returned with his army, and by the direction of Tiberius, received the  title of _Imperator_. The wife of Arminius brought forth a male child,  and the boy was brought up at Ravenna; his unhappy conflicts afterwards,  with the contumelious insults of fortune, will be remembered in their  place.    The desertion of Segestes being divulged, with his gracious reception  from Germanicus, affected his countrymen variously; with hope or  anguish, as they were prone or averse to the war. Naturally violent was  the spirit of Arminius, and now, by the captivity of his wife, by the  fate of his child doomed to bondage though yet unborn, enraged even to  distraction: he flew about amongst the Cheruscans, calling them to arms;  to arm against Segestes, to arm against Germanicus. Invectives followed  his fury; \"A blessed father this Segestes,\" he cried! \"a mighty general  this Germanicus! invincible warriors these Romans! so many troops have  made prisoner of a woman. It is not thus that I conquer; before me three  legions fell, and three lieutenant-generals. Open and honourable is my  method of war, nor waged with big-bellied women, but against men and  arms; and treason is none of my weapons. Still to be seen are the Roman  standards in the German groves, there by me hung up and devoted to our  country Gods. Let Segestes live a slave in a conquered province; let him  to his son recover a foreign priesthood: with the German nations he can  never obliterate his reproach, that through him they have seen between  the Elbe and Rhine rods"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7960"],[0,"Early European History (#16)"],[1,"was to have his own plucked out; but if the injury was  done to a poor man, the culprit had only to pay a fine.    [Illustration: BABYLONIAN CONTRACT TABLET  The actual tablet is on the right, on the left is a hollow clay case or  envelope.]    IMPORTANCE OF HAMMURABI'S CODE    Hammurabi's laws thus present a vivid picture of Oriental society two  thousand years before Christ. They always remained the basis of the  Babylonian and Assyrian legal system. They were destined, also, to exert  considerable influence upon Hebrew legislation. Centuries after Hammurabi  the enactments of the old Babylonian king were reproduced in some of the  familiar regulations of the laws of Moses. In this way they became the  heritage of the Hebrews and, through them, of our modern world.    THE MOSAIC CODE    The laws which we find in the earlier books of the Bible were ascribed by  the Hebrews to Moses. These laws covered a wide range of topics. They  fixed all religious ceremonies, required the observance every seventh day  of the Sabbath, dealt with marriage and the family, stated the penalties  for wrongdoing, gave elaborate rules for sacrifices, and even indicated  what foods must be avoided as \"unclean.\" No other ancient people possessed  so elaborate a code. The Jews throughout the world obey, to this day, its  precepts. And modern Christendom still recites the Ten Commandments, the  noblest summary of the rules of right living that has come down to us from  the ancient world.      17. RELIGION    NATURE WORSHIP    Oriental ideas of religion, even more than of law and morality, were the  gradual outgrowth of beliefs held by the Asiatic peoples in prehistoric  times. Everywhere nature worship prevailed. The vault of heaven, earth and  ocean, sun, moon, and stars were all regarded either as themselves divine  or as the abode of divinities. The sun was an object of especial  adoration. We find a sun god, under different names, in every Oriental  country.    BABYLONIAN BELIEF IN EVIL SPIRITS    Another inheritance from prehistoric times was the belief in evil spirits.  In Babylonia and Assyria this superstition became a prominent feature of  the popular religion. Men supposed themselves to be constantly surrounded  by a host of demons which caused insanity, sickness, disease, and death--  all the ills of life. People lived in constant fear of offending these  malignant beings.    MAGIC    To cope with evil spirits the Babylonian used magic. He put up a small  image of a protecting god at the entrance to his house and wore charms  upon his person. If he felt ill, he went to a priest, who recited a long  incantation supposed to drive out the \"devil\" afflicting the patient. The  reputation of the Babylonian priests was so widespread that in time the  name \"Chaldean\" [12] came to mean one who is a magician. Some of their  magical rites were borrowed by the Jews, and later by the Romans, from  whom they entered Christian Europe. Another Babylonian practice which  spread westward was that of divination, particularly by inspecting the  entrails of animals slain in sacrifice. This was a very common method of  divination among the Greeks and Romans. [13]    [Illustration: EGYPTIAN SCARAB  The beetle, as a symbol of birth and resurrection, and hence of  immortality, enjoyed much reverence in ancient Egypt. A scarab, or image  of the beetle, was often worn as a charm and was placed in the mummy as an  artificial heart.]    ASTROLOGY    Astrology received much attention. It was believed that the five planets,  comets, and eclipses of the sun and moon exerted an influence for good or  evil on the life of man. Babylonian astrology likewise extended to western  lands and became popular among the Greeks and Romans. Some of it survives  to the present time. When we name the days Saturday, Sunday, and Monday,  we are unconscious astrologers, for in old belief the first day belonged  to the planet Saturn, the second to the sun, and the third to the moon.  [14] Superstitious people who try to read their fate in the stars are  really practicing an art of Babylonian origin.    EGYPTIAN ANIMAL WORSHIP    Less influential in later times was the animal worship of the Egyptians.  This, too, formed a heritage from the prehistoric past. Many common  animals of Egypt--the cat, hawk, the jackal, the bull, the ram, the  crocodile--were highly reverenced. Some received worship because deities  were supposed to dwell in them. The larger number, however, were not  worshiped for themselves, but as symbols of different gods.    MONOTHEISM IN PERSIA    In the midst of such an assemblage of nature deities, spirits, and sacred  animals, it was remarkable that the belief in one god should ever have  arisen. The Medes and Persians accepted the teachings of Zoroaster, a  great prophet who lived perhaps as early as 1000 B.C. According to  Zoroaster, Ahuramazda, the heaven-deity, is the maker and upholder of the  universe. He is a god of light and order, of truth and purity. Against him  stands Ahriman, the personification of darkness and evil. Ahuramazda in  the end will overcome Ahriman and will reign supreme in a righteous world.  Zoroastrianism was the only monotheistic religion developed by an Indo-  European people. [15]    [Illustration: AMENHOTEP IV  A striking likeness of an Egyptian king (reigned about 1375-1358 B.C.) who  endeavored to introduce monotheism in Egypt by abolishing the worship of  all gods except the sun god. This religious revolution ended in failure  for after the king's death the old deities were restored to honor.]    HEBREW MONOTHEISM    The Hebrews, alone among the Semitic peoples of antiquity, were to develop  the worship of their god, Jehovah, into a lasting monotheism. This was a  long and gradual process Jehovah was at first regarded as the peculiar  divinity of the Hebrews. His worshipers did not deny the existence of the  gods of other nations. From the eighth century onward this narrow  conception of Jehovah was transformed by the labors of the Hebrew  prophets. They taught that Jehovah was the creator and ruler of the world  and the loving father of all mankind. On Hebrew monotheism two world  religions have been founded--Mohammedanism and Christianity.    EGYPTIAN IDEAS OF THE FUTURE LIFE    We do not find among the early Hebrews or any other Oriental people very  clear ideas about the life after death. The Egyptians long believed that  the soul of the dead man resided in or near the tomb, closely associated  with the body. This notion seems to have first led to the practice of  embalming the corpse, so that it might never suffer decay. If the body was  not preserved, the soul might die, or it might become a wandering ghost,  restless and dangerous to the living. Later Egyptian thought regarded the  future state as a place of rewards and punishments. One of the chapters of  the work called the _Book of the Dead_ describes the judgment of the soul  in the spirit world. If a man in the earthly life had not murdered,  stolen, coveted the property of others, blasphemed the gods, borne false  witness, ill treated his parents, or committed certain other wrongs, his  soul would enjoy a blissful immortality.    [Illustration: MUMMY AND COVER OF COFFIN (U.S. National Museum,  Washington)]    BABYLONIAN AND HEBREW IDEAS OF THE FUTURE LIFE    Some Oriental peoples kept the primitive belief that after death all men,  good and bad alike, suffered the same fate. The Babylonians supposed that  the souls of the departed passed a cheerless existence in a gloomy and  Hebrew underworld. The early Hebrew idea of Sheol, \"the land of darkness  and the shadow of death,\" [16] was very similar. Such thoughts of the  future life left nothing for either fear or hope. In later times, however,  the Hebrews came to believe in the resurrection of the dead and the last  judgment, conceptions afterwards adopted by Christianity.      18. LITERATURE AND ART    THE EGYPTIAN BOOK OF THE DEAD    Religion inspired the largest part of ancient literature. Each Oriental  people possessed sacred writings. The Egyptian _Book of the Dead_ was  already venerable in 3000 B.C. It was a collection of hymns, prayers, and  magical phrases to be recited by the soul on its journey beyond the grave  and in the spirit world. A chapter from this work usually covered the  inner side of the mummy case.    [Illustration: THE JUDGMENT OF THE DEAD  From a papyrus containing the _Book of the Dead_. The illustration shows a  man and his wife (at the left) entering the hall in the spirit world,  where sits the god of the dead with forty two jurors (seen above) as his  assistants. The heart of the man, symbolized by a jar, is being weighed in  balances by a jackal-headed god against a feather, the symbol of truth.  The monster in the right hand corner stands ready to devour the soul, if  the heart is found lighter than the feather.]    THE BABYLONIAN EPICS    Much more interesting are the two Babylonian epics, fragments of which  were found on clay tablets in a royal library at Nineveh. The epic of the  Creation tells how the god Marduk overcame a terrible dragon, the symbol  of primeval chaos, and thus established order in the universe. Then with  half the body of the dead dragon he made a covering for the heavens and  set therein the stars. Next he caused the new moon to shine and made it  the ruler of the night. His last work was the creation of man, in order  that the service and worship of the gods might be established forever. The  second epic contains an account of a flood, sent by the gods to punish  sinful men. The rain fell for six days and nights and covered the entire  earth. All men were drowned except the Babylonian Noah, his family, and  his relatives, who safely rode the waters in an ark. This ancient  narrative so closely resembles the Bible story in _Genesis_ that we must  trace them both to a common source.    [Illustration: THE DELUGE TABLET (British Museum London)"]]]
