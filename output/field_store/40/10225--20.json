Under certain  circumstances there may be, at times, a slight odor as of guano mixed  with earth, but this is so trifling and so local that a commode arranged  on this plan may, without the least annoyance, be kept in use in any  room.\"    The \"dry earth closet\" of the philanthropic clergyman was found to work  well, and was acceptable to his parishioners. One reason why it was so  was because dry earth was ready to hand, or could be easily procured in  a country district where labor was cheap. But where labor was dear and  dry earth scarce, those who had to pay for the carting of the earth and  the removal of the deodorized increment found it both expensive and  troublesome.    But a modification of this dry earth closet, the joint contrivance of an  English church clergyman and his brother, \"the doctor,\" residents of a  Canadian country town, who had heard of Moule's invention, is a good  substitute, and is within the reach of all. This will be briefly  described.    The vault was dug as for an ordinary closet, about fifteen feet deep,  and a rough wooden shell fitted in. About four feet below the surface of  this wooden shell a stout wide ledge was firmly fastened all around.  Upon this ledge a substantially made wooden box was placed, just as we  place a well fitting tray into our trunks. About three feet of the back  of the wooden shell was then taken out, leaving the back of the box  exposed. From the center of the back of the box a square was cut out and  a trap door fitted in and hasped down.    The tiny building, on which pains, paint, and inventive genius had not  been spared to make it snug, comfortable, well lighted and well  ventilated, was placed securely on this vault.    After stones had been embedded in the earth at the back of the vault, to  keep it from falling upon the trap door, two or three heavy planks were  laid across the hollow close to the closet. These were first covered  with a barrowful of earth and then with a heap of brushwood.    Within the closet, in the left hand corner, a tall wooden box was  placed, about two-thirds full of dry, well sifted wood ashes. The box  also contained a small long-handled fire shovel. When about six inches  of the ashes had been strewn into the vault the closet was ready for  use. No; not quite; for squares of suitable paper had to be cut, looped  together with twine, and hung within convenient reaching distance of the  right hand; also a little to the left of this pad of paper, and above  the range of sight when seated, a ten pound paper bag of the toughest  texture had to be hung by a loop on a nail driven into the corner.    At first the rector thought that his guests would be \"quick-witted  enough to understand the arrangement,\" but when he found that the  majority of them were, as the Scotch say, \"dull in the uptak,\" he had to  think of some plan to enforce his rules and regulations. As  by-word-of-mouth instructions would have been rather embarrassing to  both sides, he tacked up explicit written orders, which must have  provoked many a smile. Above the bin of sifted ashes he nailed a card  which instructed \"Those who use this closet must strew two shovelfuls of  ashes into the vault.\" Above the pad of clean paper he tacked the  thrifty proverb: \"Waste not, want not;\" and above the paper bag he  suspended a card bearing this warning: \"All refuse paper must be put  into this bag; not a scrap of clean or unclean paper must be thrown into  the vault.\"    This had the desired effect. Some complacently united to humor their  host's whim, as they called it, and others, immediately recognizing its  utility and decency, took notes with a view to modifying their own  closet arrangements.    Sarah, the maid of all work, caused a good deal of amusement in the  family circle by writing her instructions in blue pencil on the front of  the ash bin. These were: \"Strew two shuffefuls of ashes into the volt,  but don't spill two shuffefuls onto the floor. By order of the Gurl who  has to sweap up.\" This order was emphatically approved of by those  fastidious ones who didn't have to \"sweep up.\"    This closet opened off the woodshed, and besides being snugly  weatherproof in itself, was sheltered on one side by the shed and on  another by a high board fence. The other two sides were screened from  observation by lattice work, outside of which evergreens were planted to  give added seclusion and shade. A ventilator in the roof and two sunny  little windows, screened at will from within by tiny Venetian shutters,  gave ample light and currents of fresh air. For winter use, the rector's  wife and daughters made \"hooked\" mats for floor and for foot support.  These were hung up every night in the shed to air and put back first  thing in the morning. For the greater protection and comfort of  invalids, an old-fashioned foot warmer, with a handle like a basket, was  always at hand ready to be filled with live coals and carried out.    The little place was always kept as exquisitely clean as the dainty,  old-fashioned drawing room, and so vigilant was the overseeing care  bestowed on every detail, that the most delicate and acute sense of  smell could not detect the slightest abiding unpleasant odor. The paper  bag was frequently changed, and every night the accumulated contents  were burned; out of doors in the summer, and in the kitchen stove--after  a strong draught had been secured--in the winter.    At stated times the deodorized mass of solid increment--in which there  was not or ought not to have been any refuse paper to add useless  bulk--was spaded, through the trap door, out of the box in the upper  part of the vault, into a wheelbarrow, thrown upon the garden soil, and  thoroughly incorporated with it. In this cleansing out process there was  little to offend, so well had the ashes done their concealing  deodorizing work.    In using this modified form of Moule's invention, it is not necessary to  dig a deep vault. The rector, given to forecasting, thought that some  day his property might be bought by those who preferred the old style,  but his brother, the doctor, not troubling about what might be, simply  fitted his well made, four feet deep box, with its trap door, into a  smoothly dug hole that exactly held it, and set the closet over it. In  all other respects it was a model of his brother's.    This last is within the reach of all, even those who live in other  people's houses; for, when they find themselves in possession of an  unspeakably foul closet, they can cover up the old vault and set the  well cleaned, repaired, fumigated closet upon a vault fashioned after  the doctor's plan. A stout drygoods box, which can be bought for a  trifle, answers well for this purpose, after a little \"tinkering\" to  form a trap door.    Of course, dry earth is by far the best deodorizer and absorbent, but  when it cannot be easily and cheaply procured, well sifted wood or coal  ashes--wood preferred--is a good substitute. The ashes must be kept dry.  If they are not, they lose their absorbing, deodorizing powers. They  must also be well sifted. If they are not, the cinders add a useless and  very heavy bulk to the increment.    An ash sifter can be made by knocking the bottom out of a shallow box,  studding the edge all round with tacks, and using them to cross and  recross with odd lengths of stovepipe wire to form a sieve.--_The  Sanitarian_.           *       *       *       *       *          THE HYGIENIC TREATMENT OF OBESITY.[1]    [Footnote 1: Translated by Mr. Jos. Helfman, Detroit, Mich.]    BY DR. PAUL CHERON.      In order to properly regulate the regimen of the obese, it is first  necessary to determine the source of the superfluous adipose of the  organism, since either the albuminoids or the hydrocarbons may furnish  fat.    Alimentary fat becomes fixed in the tissues, as has been proved by  Lebede, who fed dogs, emaciated by long fast, with meat wholly deprived  of fat, and substituted for the latter linseed oil, when he was able to  recover the oil in each instance from the animal; parallel experiments  with mutton fat, _in lieu_ of oil, afforded like results.    Hoffman also deprived dogs of fat for a month, causing them to lose as  high as twenty-two pounds weight, then began nourishing with bacon fat  with but little lean; the quantity of fat formed in five days, in the  dog that lost twenty-two pounds, was more than three pounds, which could  have been derived only from the bacon fat.    It has been stated, however, that alimentary fat seems to preserve from  destruction the fat of the organism which arises from other sources. Be  this as it may, it is a fact that the pre-existence of fat furthers the  accumulation of more adipose; or in other words, fat induces fattening!    That adipose may be formed through the transformation of albuminous  matters (meat) is an extremely important corollary, one established  beyond cavil by Pettinkofer and Voit, in an indirect way, by first  estimating the nitrogen and carbon ingested, and second the amount  eliminated. Giving a dog meat that was wholly deprived of fat, they  found it impossible to recover more than a portion of the contained  carbon; hence some must necessarily have been utilized in the organism,  and this would be possible only by the transformation of the carbon into  fat! It goes without saying, however, that the amount of adipose thus  deposited is meager."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13642"],[0,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 1, January 1916 (#17)"],[1," to settle church affairs, all freely. I have one of the chosen men, whom  I baptized, a deacon of the church, and a native of this country, who  keeps the regulations of church matters; and I promoted a _free school_  for the instruction of the children, both free and slaves, and he is  the schoolmaster.    \"I cannot justly tell what is my age, as I have no account of the time  of my birth, but I suppose I am about forty years old. I have a wife and  four children. My wife was baptized by me in Savannah, at Brunton land,  and I have every satisfaction in life from her. She is much the same age  as myself. My eldest son is nineteen years, my next son seventeen, the  third fourteen, and the last child, a girl of eleven years; they are all  members of the church. My occupation is a farmer, but as the seasons in  this part of the country, are uncertain, I also keep a team of horses,  and waggons for the carrying goods from one place to another, which I  attend to myself, with the assistance of my sons; and by this way of  life have gained the good will of the public, who recommend me to  business, and to some very principal work for government.    \"I have a few books, some good old authors and sermons, and one large  bible that was given to me by a gentleman; a good many of our members  can read, and are all desirous to learn; they will be very thankful for  a few books to read on Sundays and other days.    \"The last accounts I had from Savannah were, that the Gospel had taken  very great effect both there and in South Carolina. Brother Andrew  Bryan, a black minister at Savannah, has TWO HUNDRED MEMBERS, in full  fellowship and had certificates from their owners of ONE HUNDRED MORE,  who had given in their experiences and were ready to be baptized. Also I  received accounts from Nova Scotia of a black Baptist preacher, Brother  David George, who was a member of the church at Savannah; he had the  permission of the Governor to preach in three provinces; his members in  full communion were then _sixty_, white and black, the Gospel spreading.  Brother Amos is at Providence, he writes me that the Gospel has taken  good effect, and is spreading greatly; he has about THREE HUNDRED  MEMBERS. Brother Jessy Gaulsing, another black minister, preaches near  Augusta, in South Carolina, at a place where I used to preach; he was a  member of the church at Savannah, and has _sixty members_; and a great  work is going on there.    \"I agree to election, redemption, the fall of Adam, regeneration, and  perseverance, knowing the promise is to all who endure, in grace, faith,  and good works, to the end, shall be saved.    \"There is no Baptist church in this country but ours.

Several gentlemen, members of the house of assembly, and other  gentlemen, have subscribed towards the building about 40 l. The chief  part of our congregation are SLAVES, and their owners allow them, in  common, but three or four bits per week[4] for allowance to feed  themselves; and out of so small a sum we cannot expect any thing that  can be of service from them; if we did it would soon bring a scandal  upon religion; and the FREE PEOPLE in our society are but poor, but they  are all willing, both free and slaves, to do what they can.

Mr. John Rippon    Kingston In Jamaica, Nov. 26, 1791.    _Reverend Sir_,    The perusal of your letter of the 15th July last, gave me much  pleasure--to find that you had interested yourself to serve the glorious  cause Mr. Liele is engaged in. He has been for a considerable time past  very zealous in the ministry; but his congregation being chiefly slaves,  they had it not in their power to support him, therefore he has been  obliged to do it from his own industry; this has taken a considerable  part of his time and much of his attention from his labours in the  ministry; however, I am led to believe that it has been of essential  service to the cause of GOD, for his industry has set a good example to  his flock, and has put it out of the power of enemies to religion to  say, that he has been eating the bread of idleness, or lived upon the  poor slaves. The idea that too much prevails here amongst the masters of  slaves is, that if their minds are considerably enlightened by religion  or otherwise, that it would be attended with the most dangerous  consequences; and this has been the only cause why the Methodist  ministers and Mr. Liele have not made a greater progress in the ministry  amongst the slaves. Alas! how much is it to be lamented, that a full  QUARTER OF A MILLION of poor souls should so long remain in a state of  nature; and that masters should be so blind to their own interest as not  to know the difference between obedience inforced by the lash of the  whip and that which flows from religious principles. Although I much  admire the _general doctrine_ preached in the Methodist church, yet I by  no means approve of their discipline set up by Mr. Wesley, that reverend  man of God. I very early saw into the impropriety of admitting slaves  into their societies _without permission of their owners_, and told them  the consequences that would attend it; but they rejected my advice; and  it has not only prevented the increase of their church, but has raised  them many enemies. Mr. Liele has very wisely acted a different part. He  has, I believe, admitted no slaves into society but those who had  obtained permission from their owners, by which he has made many  friends; and I think the Almighty is now opening a way for another  church in the capital, where the Methodists could not gain any ground: a  short time will determine it, of which I shall advise you.--I really  have not time to enter so fully on this subject as I wish, being very  much engaged in my own temporal affairs, and at present having no  clerk.--The love I bear to the cause of God, and the desire I have of  being any ways instrumental to the establishing of it in this land of  darkness, has led me to write this: but before I conclude, I have some  very interesting particulars to lay before you:--Mr. Liele has by the  aid of the congregation and the assistance of some few people, raised  the walls of a church ready to receive the roof, but has not the means  to lay it on and finish it; nor do I see any prospect of its going  further, without he receives the aid of some religious institution from  home. One hundred and fifty pounds, I think, would complete it; and if  this sum could be raised, it would greatly serve the cause of GOD, and  might be the means of bringing many hundred souls, who are now in a  state of darkness, to the knowledge of our great Redeemer. If this could  be raised the sooner the better. Our family contributed towards the  purchase of the Methodist chapel; nor shall our mite be wanting to  forward this work if it meets with any encouragement from home.--I am a  stranger to you, but you may know my character from Daniel Shea, "]]]
