Then the heron flew over  and around her, shrieking and protesting, and at last dropped its gaunt  legs only a few yards from her. But, strangest of all, a pretty white  bird, larger than a dove--like a pelican, but not a pelican--circled  around and around her. At last it lit upon a rootlet of the tree, quite  over her shoulder. She put out her hand and stroked its beautiful white  neck, and it never appeared to move. It stayed there so long that she  thought she would lift up the baby to see it, and try to attract her  attention. But when she did so, the child was so chilled and cold, and  had such a blue look under the little lashes which it didn't raise at  all, that she screamed aloud, and the bird flew away, and she fainted.    Well, that was the worst of it, and perhaps it was not so much, after  all, to any but herself. For when she recovered her senses it was bright  sunlight, and dead low water. There was a confused noise of guttural  voices about her, and an old squaw, singing an Indian \"hushaby,\" and  rocking herself from side to side before a fire built on the marsh,  before which she, the recovered wife and mother, lay weak and weary. Her  first thought was for her baby, and she was about to speak, when a young  squaw, who must have been a mother herself, fathomed her thought and  brought her the \"mowitch,\" pale but living, in such a queer little  willow cradle all bound up, just like the squaw's own young one, that  she laughed and cried together, and the young squaw and the old squaw  showed their big white teeth and glinted their black eyes and said,  \"Plenty get well, skeena mowitch,\" \"wagee man come plenty soon,\" and she  could have kissed their brown faces in her joy. And then she found that  they had been gathering berries on the marsh in their queer, comical  baskets, and saw the skirt of her gown fluttering on the tree from afar,  and the old squaw couldn't resist the temptation of procuring a new  garment, and came down and discovered the \"wagee\" woman and child. And  of course she gave the garment to the old squaw, as you may imagine, and  when HE came at last and rushed up to her, looking about ten years older  in his anxiety, she felt so faint again that they had to carry her to  the canoe. For, you see, he knew nothing about the flood until he met  the Indians at Utopia, and knew by the signs that the poor woman was  his wife. And at the next high tide he towed the tree away back home,  although it wasn't worth the trouble, and built another house, using the  old tree for the foundation and props, and called it after her, \"Mary's  Ark!\" But you may guess the next house was built above high-water mark.  And that's all.    Not much, perhaps, considering the malevolent capacity of the Dedlow  Marsh. But you must tramp over it at low water, or paddle over it at  high tide, or get lost upon it once or twice in the fog, as I have,  to understand properly Mary's adventure, or to appreciate duly the  blessings of living beyond High-Water Mark.          A LONELY RIDE      As I stepped into the Slumgullion stage I saw that it was a dark night,  a lonely road, and that I was the only passenger. Let me assure the  reader that I have no ulterior design in making this assertion. A  long course of light reading has forewarned me what every experienced  intelligence must confidently look for from such a statement. The  storyteller who willfully tempts Fate by such obvious beginnings; who is  to the expectant reader in danger of being robbed or half-murdered, or  frightened by an escaped lunatic, or introduced to his ladylove for the  first time, deserves to be detected. I am relieved to say that none of  these things occurred to me. The road from Wingdam to Slumgullion knew  no other banditti than the regularly licensed hotelkeepers; lunatics had  not yet reached such depth of imbecility as to ride of their own free  will in California stages; and my Laura, amiable and long-suffering as  she always is, could not, I fear, have borne up against these depressing  circumstances long enough to have made the slightest impression on me.    I stood with my shawl and carpetbag in hand, gazing doubtingly on the  vehicle. Even in the darkness the red dust of Wingdam was visible on its  roof and sides, and the red slime of Slumgullion clung tenaciously to  its wheels. I opened the door; the stage creaked easily, and in the  gloomy abyss the swaying straps beckoned me, like ghostly hands, to come  in now and have my sufferings out at once.    I must not omit to mention the occurrence of a circumstance which struck  me as appalling and mysterious. A lounger on the steps of the hotel,  who I had reason to suppose was not in any way connected with the stage  company, gravely descended, and walking toward the conveyance, tried  the handle of the door, opened it, expectorated in the carriage, and  returned to the hotel with a serious demeanor. Hardly had he resumed  his position when another individual, equally disinterested, impassively  walked down the steps, proceeded to the back of the stage, lifted it,  expectorated carefully on the axle, and returned slowly and pensively to  the hotel. A third spectator wearily disengaged himself from one of  the Ionic columns of the portico and walked to the box, remained for a  moment in serious and expectorative contemplation of the boot, and then  returned to his column. There was something so weird in this baptism  that I grew quite nervous.    Perhaps I was out of spirits. A number of infinitesimal annoyances,  winding up with the resolute persistency of the clerk at the stage  office to enter my name misspelt on the waybill, had not predisposed  me to cheerfulness. The inmates of the Eureka House, from a social  viewpoint, were not attractive. There was the prevailing opinion--so  common to many honest people--that a serious style of deportment and  conduct toward a stranger indicates high gentility and elevated station.  Obeying this principle, all hilarity ceased on my entrance to supper,  and general remark merged into the safer and uncompromising chronicle of  several bad cases of diphtheria, then epidemic at Wingdam. When I left  the dining-room, with an odd feeling that I had been supping exclusively  on mustard and tea leaves, I stopped a moment at the parlor door. A  piano, harmoniously related to the dinner bell, tinkled responsive to  a diffident and uncertain touch. On the white wall the shadow of an  old and sharp profile was bending over several symmetrical and shadowy  curls. \"I sez to Mariar, Mariar, sez I, 'Praise to the face is open  disgrace.'\" I heard no more. Dreading some susceptibility to sincere  expression on the subject of female loveliness, I walked away, checking  the compliment that otherwise might have risen unbidden to my lips, and  have brought shame and sorrow to the household.    It was with the memory of these experiences resting heavily upon me that  I stood hesitatingly before the stage door. The driver, about to mount,  was for a moment illuminated by the open door of the hotel. He had  the wearied look which was the distinguishing expression of Wingdam.  Satisfied that I was properly waybilled and receipted for, he took no  further notice of me. I looked longingly at the box seat, but he did  not respond to the appeal. I flung my carpetbag into the chasm, dived  recklessly after it, and--before I was fairly seated--with a great  sigh, a creaking of unwilling springs, complaining bolts, and harshly  expostulating axle, we moved away. Rather the hotel door slipped behind,  the sound of the piano sank to rest, and the night and its shadows moved  solemnly upon us.    To say it was dark expressed but faintly the pitchy obscurity  that encompassed the vehicle. The roadside trees were scarcely  distinguishable as deeper masses of shadow; I knew them only by the  peculiar sodden odor that from time to time sluggishly flowed in at the  open window as we rolled by. We proceeded slowly; so leisurely that,  leaning from the carriage, I more than once detected the fragrant sigh  of some astonished cow, whose ruminating repose upon the highway we  had ruthlessly disturbed. But in the darkness our progress, more the  guidance of some mysterious instinct than any apparent volition of  our own, gave an indefinable charm of security to our journey that a  moment's hesitation or indecision on the part of the driver would have  destroyed.    I had indulged a hope that in the empty vehicle I might obtain that rest  so often denied me in its crowded condition. It was a weak delusion.  When I stretched out my limbs it was only to find that the ordinary  conveniences for making several people distinctly uncomfortable were  distributed throughout my individual frame. At last, resting my arms  on the straps, by dint of much gymnastic effort I became sufficiently  composed to be aware of a more refined species of torture. The springs  of the stage, rising and falling regularly, produced a rhythmical beat  which began to absorb my attention painfully. Slowly this thumping  merged into a senseless echo of the mysterious female of  the hotel parlor, and shaped itself into this awful and  benumbing axiom--\"Praise-to-the-face-is-open-disgrace.  Praise-to-the-face-is-open-disgrace.\" Inequalities of the road only  quickened its utterance or drawled it to an exasperating length.    It was of no use to consider the statement seriously. It was of no  use to except to it indignantly. It was of no use to recall the many  instances where praise to the face had redounded to the everlasting  honor of praiser and bepraised; of no use to dwell sentimentally  on modest genius and courage lifted up and strengthened by open  commendation; of no use to except to the mysterious female, to picture  her as rearing a thin-blooded generation on selfish and mechanically"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13121"],[0,"A Voyage to Terra Australis — Volume 2 (#17)"],[1,"20 SEPTEMBER 1802] before we anchored at the south end of Long  Island, in 3 fathoms, and about one mile from the low mangrove shore. At  the south end of the island was a small hill, bearing S. 55 deg. E. one mile  and a half from the ship, where I landed with a party of the gentlemen;  it forms the west point of the inner entrance to Thirsty Sound, as some  low red cliffs, one mile and a half distant, do the east point; but a  shoal, dry at low water, lies in the middle, and the channels on each  side are not calculated for a ship. The small hill was found to be on a  detached islet one mile long, the greater part of which is mud covered  with mangroves; the hill is partly excavated by an arched way running  through it, and the stone is of a mixed red and white colour, and of an  ochry consistence. From the highest top, I set:      Upper Head, bearing S. 28 deg. 22' W.  Double Mount.       S. 53  20  E.  Pine Mount,         S. 61   5  E.      These bearings place the inner end of Thirsty Sound in latitude 22 deg. 16';  and curtail the distance of thirty miles from Pier Head in captain Cook's  chart, to twelve miles and a half.    TUESDAY 21 SEPTEMBER 1802    On the 21st, the botanical gentlemen went over in the launch to the east  side of Thirsty Sound, the main land having been always found more  productive in the objects of their pursuit, than any island however  large. I went to examine along the west side of Long Island; but had not  proceeded two miles before an opening presented itself amongst the  mangroves. It led to the eastward, and then separated into two branches;  and in following that which trended north-east I came into Thirsty Sound,  and landed five miles above the inner entrance, at an islet in  mid-channel, which had been set from Pier Head and is laid down by  captain Cook.    No less than five different pieces of land were found to be cut off from  the south end of Long Island, by winding channels amongst the mangroves;  and I now saw the prospect of a passage through the middle, leading out  at the bight between the north point and Pier Head. A woody and rather  elevated islet obscures the inner end of the opening, and seems to have  prevented captain Cook's observing this separation when going up Thirsty  Sound in his boat. I found in it a good bottom, with 3 to 5 fathoms  water, and room for a ship to swing, or sail through as far as the outer  opening to sea; but another island lies in the outlet, the bottom is  rocky, and the regular depth at low water is not so much as 3 fathoms on  either side.    Having taken a second set of angles, and passed out by the new opening, I  steered northward along the east side of Long Island; but although the  land be high and rather steep, there was seldom so much as 3 fathoms at a  mile distance. I landed at the north end of the island, to ascertain  better the forms and positions of the North-point Isles; and then,  steering southward along the west side, entered a cove where the form of  the surrounding land gave a hope of finding fresh water for the ship; but  the borders were covered with mangroves, and we could not get  sufficiently far up to know whether any part of the stream running  through them were fresh. Another set of angles was taken from a hill on  the south side of the cove; and the sun being then set, our tent was  pitched for the night.    WEDNESDAY 22 SEPTEMBER 1802    Next morning I steered onward along the west side of Long Island, landing  occasionally to examine the gullies made by the rains; but at this time  they were all dry. As far to the south as Westside Islet, the shore is  tolerably high and the water deep; and near to the inner end of the  islet, where I landed to take angles, there was no bottom with 10  fathoms; but the shore from thence to the ship was low and covered with  mangroves, and even the rocky points cannot be approached within half a  mile, except by boats.    Not a single Indian was seen during this excursion round Long Island; nor  from the length of the grass and appearance of their fire places, do I  think they had been there for some months.    THURSDAY 23 SEPTEMBER 1802    Next day I made a further examination of the winding channels at the  south end of Long Island; and also went to an inlet on the east side of  Broad Sound, the entrance of which is so much obstructed by shoals, that  it was difficult to find a sufficient depth, even for the boat. I landed  with the naturalist at a low, cliffy head on the north side of the  entrance; but not without wading a quarter of a mile in the mud. We saw  from thence, that this inlet, though presenting the appearance of a  respectable river when the tide was in, had no perceptible breadth at  five miles within the land, that it was almost wholly dry at low water,  and that the shores were covered with mangroves to a great extent; even  the cliffy head where we stood, was surrounded with mangroves, and  appeared to be insulated at spring tides.    FRIDAY 24 SEPTEMBER 1802    In the morning of the 24th, we got under way to return to Upper Head; and  having the same difficulties to encounter amongst the shoals as before,  did not reach our former anchorage until next day [SATURDAY 25 SEPTEMBER  1802]. On landing at the tents, I found, to my no less surprise than  regret, that the time keepers had again been let down; and no more than  one day's rates had been since obtained. Twenty-five sets of distances of  the sun and moon had been taken to correspond with an equal number on the  opposite side; and it appeared that lieutenant Flinders being intent upon  these, had forgotten to wind up the time keepers on the 22nd at noon.    This fresh difficulty was very embarrassing. To go away for Torres'  Strait and the Gulph of Carpentaria without good rates, was to cripple  the accuracy of all our longitudes; and on the other hand, the expected  approach of the contrary monsoon on the North Coast admitted of no longer  delay in Broad Sound. On comparing the last day's rates with those of the  four days previously obtained, the letting down did not appear to have  produced any material alteration; and I therefore determined to combine  the whole together, and to sail immediately.    SUNDAY 26 SEPTEMBER 1802    The following day was occupied in completing the holds with wood, taking  on board our shore establishment, and preparing for sea; and next morning  [MONDAY 27 SEPTEMBER 1802] we steered down Broad Sound, with the Lady  Nelson in company, keeping near the western side to avoid the middle  shoals. On a sea breeze coming in at north, we tacked towards the  North-point Isles; and at sunset, the flood tide having then made,  anchored in 8 fathoms, upon a bottom of sand and rock, the  north-westernmost isle bearing N. 6 deg. E., two leagues. In the morning we  passed round the North-point Isles, with a breeze from the south-east;  and thus quitted Broad Sound, steering off for the outermost and largest  of the Northumberland Islands.    There remains little to be said upon the navigation of Broad Sound, more  than what has been related of our courses in it, and what will be found  in the chart. The western channel, between the Flat Isles and the main,  is not to be recommended; but after steering up the middle of the Sound  and passing these isles, the western shore should be kept nearest a-bord.  A ship may then reach Upper Head without difficulty, and lie there in  perfect safety from all winds, at two-thirds of a mile off; but cannot go  higher up the sound without risk of grounding on the banks. From half  flood to half ebb, landing is easy at Upper Head, and it is perhaps the  sole place on the main possessing that advantage; every where else the  shore is very low, fronted with mud banks, and covered, in some places  miles deep, with interwoven mangroves, amongst which the tide flows at  high water.    The stone of Upper Head, and apparently of all the hills in its  neighbourhood, is granitic; whilst that of Long Island and West Hill  approach nearer to porphyry. At the inner entrance of Thirsty Sound the  points are mostly composed of an earth, which is not heavy, is sometimes  red, but more frequently white, or mixed; and of a consistence not harder  than ochre.    Long Island, though covered with grass and wood, is stony and incapable  of ordinary cultivation. On the main land, the low parts between the  mangroves and the hills seemed to be of a tolerably good soil; and  according to the report of some of the gentlemen, who made an excursion  at the back of Upper Head, the vallies there produce good grass and  appeared fertile. There seems, indeed, to be a considerable extent of  land about Broad Sound and on the peninsula between it and Shoal-water  Bay, which, if not calculated to give a rich return to the cultivator of  wheat, would support much cattle, and produce maize, sugar, and tobacco;  and cotton and coffee would grow upon the more rocky sides of the hills,  and probably even upon Long Island. Should it ever be in contemplation to  make an establishment in New South Wales within the tropic, in aid of  Port Jackson and the colonies to the southward, this neighbourhood would  probably be chosen; and the great rise of tide presents advantages which  might be some time turned to account in ship building. On the west side  of the sound, near the Flat Isles, the rise at spring tides is not less  than thirty, and perhaps reaches to thirty-five feet. At Upper Head it is  from twenty at the neaps, to thirty or more at the springs; but the  bottom rises so much towards the top of the sound, that the tide there  never seems to exceed twelve feet. The time of high water is nearly  _eleven hours after_ the moon's passage over and under the meridian;  though the flood runs up near an hour on the west side of the sound,  after it is high water by the shore.    The places best calculated for the construction of docks, appear to be at  the uppermost or 4th Flat "]]]
