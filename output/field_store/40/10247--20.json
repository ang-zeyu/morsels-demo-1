Lepere has  started some publications for this purpose; he has had pupils of great  merit, and he must be considered the master of the whole generation of  modern wood-engravers, just as Cheret is the undisputed master of the  poster. Lepere's ruling quality is strength. He seems to have  rediscovered the mediaeval limners' secrets of cutting the wood, giving  the necessary richness to the ink, creating a whole scale of half-tones,  and specially of adapting the design to typographic printing, and making  of it, so to say, an ornament and a decorative extension for the type.  Lepere is a wood-engraver with whom none of his contemporaries can be  compared; as regards his imagination, it is that of an altogether  curious artist. He excels in composing and expressing the life, the  animation, the soul of the streets and the picturesque side of the  populace. Herein he is much inspired by Manet and, if we go back to the  real tradition, by Guys, Debucourt, the younger Moreau and by Gabriel de  Saint-Aubin. He is decidedly a Realist of French lineage, who owes  nothing to the Academy and its formulas.    It would be evidently unreasonable to attach to Impressionism all that  is ante-academical, and between the two extremes there is room for a  crowd of interesting artists. We shall not succumb to the prejudice of  the School by declaring, in our turn, that there is no salvation outside  Impressionism, and we have been careful to state repeatedly that, if  Impressionism has a certain number of principles as kernel, its  applications and its influence have a radiation which it is difficult to  limit. What can be absolutely demonstrated is, that this movement has  had the greatest influence on modern illustration, sometimes through its  colouring, sometimes simply through the great freedom of its ideas. Some  have found in it a direct lesson, others an example to be followed.  Some have met in it technical methods which pleased them, others have  only taken some suggestions from it. That is the case, for instance,  with Legrand, with Steinlen, and with Renouard; and it is also the case  with the lithographer Odilon Redon, who applies the values of Manet and,  in his strange pastels, the harmonies of Degas and Renoir, placing them  at the service of dreams and hallucinations and of a symbolism which is  absolutely removed from the realism of these painters. It is, finally,  the case with the water-colour painter Henri Riviere, who is misjudged  as to his merit, and who is one of the most perfect of those who have  applied Impressionist ideas to decorative engraving. He has realised  images in colours destined to decorate inexpensively the rooms of the  people and recalling the grand aspects of landscapes with a broad  simplification which is derived, curiously enough, from Puvis de  Chavannes's large decorative landscapes and from the small and precise  colour prints of Japan. Riviere, who is a skilful and personal poetic  landscapist, is not exactly an Impressionist, in so far as he does not  divide the tones, but rather blends them in subtle mixtures in the  manner of the Japanese. Yet, seeing his work, one cannot help thinking  of all the surprise and freedom introduced into modern art by  Impressionism.    Everybody, even the ignorant, can perceive, on looking through an  illustrated paper or a modern volume, that thirty years ago this manner  of placing the figures, of noting familiar gestures, and of seizing  fugitive life with spirit and clearness was unknown. This mass of  engravings and of sketches resembles in no way what had been seen  formerly. They no longer have the solemn air of classic composition, by  which the drawings had been affected. A current of bold spontaneity has  passed through here. In modern English illustration, it can be stated  indisputably that nothing would be such as it can now be seen, if  Morris, Rossetti and Crane had not imposed their vision, and yet many  talented Englishmen resemble these initiators only very remotely. It is  exactly in this sense that we shall have credited Impressionism with the  talents who have drawn their inspiration less from its principles, than  from its vigorous protest against mechanical formulas, and who have  been able to find the energy, necessary for their success, in the  example it set by fighting during twenty years against the ideas of  routine which seemed indestructible. Even with the painters who are far  removed from the vision and the colouring of Manet and Degas, of Monet  and Renoir, one can find a very precise tendency: that of returning to  the subjects and the style of the real national tradition; and herein  lies one of the most serious benefits bestowed by Impressionism upon an  art which had stopped at the notion of a canonical beauty, until it had  almost become sterile in its timidity.          IX    NEO-IMPRESSIONISM--GAUGUIN, DENIS, THEO VAN RYSSELBERGHE--THE THEORY OF  POINTILLISM--SEURAT, SIGNAC AND THE THEORIES OF SCIENTIFIC  CHROMATISM--FAULTS AND QUALITIES OF THE IMPRESSIONIST MOVEMENT, WHAT WE  OWE TO IT, ITS PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF THE FRENCH SCHOOL--SOME WORDS ON  ITS INFLUENCE ABROAD      The beginnings of the movement designated under the name of  Neo-Impressionism can be traced back to about 1880. The movement is a  direct offshoot of the first Impressionism, originated by a group of  young painters who admired it and thought of pushing further still its  chromatic principles. The flourishing of Impressionism coincided, as a  matter of fact, with certain scientific labours concerning optics.  Helmholtz had just published his works on the perception of colours and  sounds by means of waves. Chevreul had continued on this path by  establishing his beautiful theories on the analysis of the solar  spectrum. M. Charles Henry, an original and remarkable spirit, occupied  himself in his turn with these delicate problems by applying them  directly to aesthetics, which Helmholtz and Chevreul had not thought of  doing. M. Charles Henry had the idea of creating relations between this  branch of science and the laws of painting. As a friend of several young  painters he had a real influence over them, showing them that the new  vision due to the instinct of Monet and of Manet might perhaps be  scientifically verified, and might establish fixed principles in a  sphere where hitherto the laws of colouring had been the effects of  individual conception. At that moment the criticism which resulted from  Taine's theories tried to effect a _rapprochement_ of the artistic and  scientific domains in criticism and in the psychologic novel. The  painters, too, gave way to this longing for precision which seems to  have been the great preoccupation of intellects from 1880 to about 1889.    Their researches had a special bearing on the theory of complementary  colours and on the means of establishing some laws concerning the  reaction of tones in such manner as to draw up a kind of tabula. Georges  Seurat and Paul Signac were the promoters of this research. Seurat died  very young, and one cannot but regret this death of an artist who would  have been very interesting and capable of beautiful works. Those which  he has left us bear witness to a spirit very receptive to theories, and  leaving nothing to chance. The silhouettes are reduced to almost  rigorously geometrical principles, the tones are decomposed  systematically. These canvases are more reasoned examples than works of  intuition and spontaneous vision. They show Seurat's curious desire to  give a scientific and classic basis to Impressionism. The same idea  rules in all the work of Paul Signac, who has painted some portraits and  numerous landscapes. To these two painters is due the method of  _Pointillism_, _i.e._ the division of tones, not only by touches, as in  Monet's pictures, but by very small touches of equal size, causing the  spheric shape to act equally upon the retina. The accumulation of these  luminous points is carried out over the entire surface of the canvas  without thick daubs of paint, and with regularity, whilst with Manet the  paint is more or less dense. The theory of complementary colours is  systematically applied. On a sketch, made from nature, the painter notes  the principal relations of tones, then systematises them on his picture  and connects them by different shades which should be their logical  result. Neo-Impressionism believes in obtaining thus a greater exactness  than that which results from the individual temperament of the painter  who simply relies on his own perception. And it is true, in theory, that  such a conception is more exact. But it reduces the picture to a kind of  theorem, which excludes all that constitutes the value and charm of an  art, that is to say: caprice, fancy, and the spontaneity of personal  inspiration. The works of Seurat, Signac, and of the few men who have  strictly followed the rules of Pointillism are lacking in life, in  surprise, and make a somewhat tiring impression upon one's eyes. The  uniformity of the points does not succeed in giving an impression of  cohesion, and even less a suggestion of different textures, even if the  values are correct. Manet seems to have attained perfection in using the  method which consists in directing the touches in accordance with each  of the planes, and this is evidently the most natural method. Scientific  Chromatism constitutes an _ensemble_ of propositions, of which art will  be able to make use, though indirectly, as information useful for a  better understanding of the laws of light in presence of nature. What  Pointillism has been able to give us, is a method which would be very  appreciable for decorative paintings seen from a great distance--friezes  or ceilings in spacious buildings. It would in this case return to the  principle of mosaic, which is the principle _par excellence_ of mural  art.    The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14060"],[0,"Mr. Britling Sees It Through (#17)"],[1,"the way to the goal was barred only by the dust-cloak lady and Mr.  Lawrence Carmine. He made as if to shoot to Mr. Carmine's left and then  smacked the ball, with the swiftness of a serpent's stroke, to his  right.    He'd done it! Mr. Carmine's stick and feet were a yard away.    Then hard on this wild triumph came a flash of horror. One can't see  everything. His eye following the ball's trajectory....    Directly in its line of flight was the perambulator.    The ball missed the legs of the lady with the noble nose by a kind of  miracle, hit and glanced off the wheel of the perambulator, and went  spinning into a border of antirrhinums.    \"Good!\" cried Cecily. \"Splendid shot!\"    He'd shot a goal. He'd done it well. The perambulator it seemed didn't  matter. Though apparently the impact had awakened the baby. In the  margin of his consciousness was the figure of Mr. Britling remarking:  \"Aunty. You really mustn't wheel the perambulator--_just_ there.\"    \"I thought,\" said the aunt, indicating the goal posts by a facial  movement, \"that those two sticks would be a sort of protection.... Aah!  _Did_ they then?\"    Never mind that.    \"That's _game!_\" said one of the junior Britlings to Mr. Direck with a  note of high appreciation, and the whole party, relaxing and crumpling  like a lowered flag, moved towards the house and tea.      Section 5    \"We'll play some more after tea,\" said Cecily. \"It will be cooler then.\"    \"My word, I'm beginning to like it,\" said Mr. Direck.    \"You're going to play very well,\" she said.    And such is the magic of a game that Mr. Direck was humbly proud and  grateful for her praise, and trotted along by the side of this creature  who had revealed herself so swift and resolute and decisive, full to  overflowing of the mere pleasure of just trotting along by her side. And  after tea, which was a large confused affair, enlivened by wonderful and  entirely untruthful reminiscences of the afternoon by Mr. Raeburn, they  played again, with fewer inefficients and greater skill and swiftness,  and Mr. Direck did such quick and intelligent things that everybody  declared that he was a hockey player straight from heaven. The dusk,  which at last made the position of the ball too speculative for play,  came all too soon for him. He had played in six games, and he knew he  would be as stiff as a Dutch doll in the morning. But he was very, very  happy.    The rest of the Sunday evening was essentially a sequel to the hockey.    Mr. Direck changed again, and after using some embrocation that Mrs.  Britling recommended very strongly, came down in a black jacket and a  cheerfully ample black tie. He had a sense of physical well-being such  as he had not experienced since he came aboard the liner at New York.  The curious thing was that it was not quite the same sense of physical  well-being that one had in America. That is bright and clear and a  little dry, this was--humid. His mind quivered contentedly, like sunset  midges over a lake--it had no hard bright flashes--and his body wanted  to sit about. His sense of intimacy with Cecily increased each time he  looked at her. When she met his eyes she smiled. He'd caught her style  now, he felt; he attempted no more compliments and was frankly her  pupil at hockey and Badminton. After supper Mr. Britling renewed his  suggestion of an automobile excursion on the Monday.    \"There's nothing to take you back to London,\" said Mr. Britling, \"and we  could just hunt about the district with the little old car and see  everything you want to see....\"    Mr. Direck did not hesitate three seconds. He thought of Gladys; he  thought of Miss Cecily Corner.    \"Well, indeed,\" he said, \"if it isn't burthening you, if I'm not being  any sort of inconvenience here for another night, I'd be really very  glad indeed of the opportunity of going around and seeing all these  ancient places....\"      Section 6    The newspapers came next morning at nine, and were full of the Sarajevo  Murders. Mr. Direck got the _Daily Chronicle_ and found quite animated  headlines for a British paper.    \"Who's this Archduke,\" he asked, \"anyhow? And where is this Bosnia? I  thought it was a part of Turkey.\"    \"It's in Austria,\" said Teddy.    \"It's in the middle ages,\" said Mr. Britling. \"What an odd, pertinaceous  business it seems to have been. First one bomb, then another; then  finally the man with the pistol. While we were strolling about the rose  garden. It's like something out of 'The Prisoner of Zenda.'\"    \"Please,\" said Herr Heinrich.    Mr. Britling assumed an attentive expression.    \"Will not this generally affect European politics?\"    \"I don't know. Perhaps it will.\"    \"It says in the paper that Serbia has sent those bombs to Sarajevo.\"    \"It's like another world,\" said Mr. Britling, over his paper.  \"Assassination as a political method. Can you imagine anything of the  sort happening nowadays west of the Adriatic? Imagine some one  assassinating the American Vice-President, and the bombs being at once  ascribed to the arsenal at Toronto!... We take our politics more sadly  in the West.... Won't you have another egg, Direck?\"    \"Please! Might this not lead to a war?\"    \"I don't think so. Austria may threaten Serbia, but she doesn't want to  provoke a conflict with Russia. It would be going too near the powder  magazine. But it's all an extraordinary business.\"    \"But if she did?\" Herr Heinrich persisted.    \"She won't.... Some years ago I used to believe in the inevitable  European war,\" Mr. Britling explained to Mr. Direck, \"but it's been  threatened so long that at last I've lost all belief in it. The Powers  wrangle and threaten. They're far too cautious and civilised to let the  guns go off. If there was going to be a war it would have happened two  years ago when the Balkan League fell upon Turkey. Or when Bulgaria  attacked Serbia....\"    Herr Heinrich reflected, and received these conclusions with an  expression of respectful edification.    \"I am naturally anxious,\" he said, \"because I am taking tickets for my  holidays at an Esperanto Conference at Boulogne.\"      Section 7    \"There is only one way to master such a thing as driving an automobile,\"  said Mr. Britling outside his front door, as he took his place in the  driver's seat, \"and that is to resolve that from the first you will take  no risks. Be slow if you like. Stop and think when you are in doubt. But  do nothing rashly, permit no mistakes.\"    It seemed to Mr. Direck as he took his seat beside his host that this  was admirable doctrine.    They started out of the gates with an extreme deliberation. Indeed twice  they stopped dead in the act of turning into the road, and the engine  had to be restarted.    \"You will laugh at me,\" said Mr. Britling; \"but I'm resolved to have no  blunders this time.\"    \"I don't laugh at you. It's excellent,\" said Mr. Direck.    \"It's the right way,\" said Mr. Britling. \"Care--oh damn! I've stopped  the engine again. Ugh!--ah!--_so!_--Care, I was saying--and calm.\"    \"Don't think I want to hurry you,\" said Mr. Direck. \"I don't....\"    They passed through the tillage at a slow, agreeable pace, tooting  loudly at every corner, and whenever a pedestrian was approached. Mr.  Direck was reminded that he had still to broach the lecture project to  Mr. Britling. So much had happened--    The car halted abruptly and the engine stopped.    \"I thought that confounded hen was thinking of crossing the road,\" said  Mr. Britling. \"Instead of which she's gone through the hedge. She  certainly looked this way.... Perhaps I'm a little fussy this  morning.... I'll warm up to the work presently.\"    \"I'm convinced you can't be too careful,\" said Mr. Direck. \"And this  sort of thing enables one to see the country better....\"    Beyond the village Mr. Britling seemed to gather confidence. The pace  quickened. But whenever other traffic or any indication of a side way  appeared discretion returned. Mr. Britling stalked his sign posts,  crawling towards them on the belly of the lowest gear; he drove all the  morning like a man who is flushing ambuscades. And yet accident overtook  him. For God demands more from us than mere righteousness.    He cut through the hills to Market Saffron along a lane-road with which  he was unfamiliar. It began to go up hill. He explained to Mr. Direck  how admirably his engine would climb hills on the top gear.    They took a curve and the hill grew steeper, and Mr. Direck opened the  throttle.    They rounded another corner, and still more steeply the hill rose before  them.    The engine began to make a chinking sound, and the car lost pace. And  then Mr. Britling saw a pleading little white board with the inscription  \"Concealed Turning.\" For the moment he thought a turning might be  concealed anywhere. He threw out his clutch and clapped on his brake.  Then he repented of what he had done. But the engine, after three  Herculean throbs, ceased to work. Mr. Britling with a convulsive clutch  at his steering wheel set the electric hooter snarling, while one foot  released the clutch again and the other, on the accelerator, sought in  vain for help. Mr. Direck felt they were going back, back, in spite of  all this vocalisation. He clutched at the emergency brake. But he was  too late to avoid misfortune. With a feeling like sitting gently in  butter, the car sank down sideways and stopped with two wheels in the  ditch.    Mr. Britling said they were in the ditch--said it with quite unnecessary  violence....    This time two cart horses and a retinue of five men were necessary to  restore Gladys to her self-respect....    After that they drove on to Market Saffron, and got there in time for  lunch, and after lunch Mr. Direck explored the church and the churchyard  and the parish register....    After lunch Mr. Britling became more cheerful about his driving. The  road from Market Saffron to Blandish, whence one turns off to Matching's  Easy, is "]]]
