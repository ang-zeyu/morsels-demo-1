It was nearly calm  the whole day, and the thermometer exposed to the sun about the middle of  the day rose to a degree of heat we have not before met with.\"    In the report published in the Philosophical Transactions he also refers  to the heat:    \"Every wished-for favourable circumstance attended the whole of the day,  without one single impediment excepting the heat, which was intolerable;  the thermometer which hung by the clock and was exposed to the sun, as we  were, was one time as high as 119 degrees.\"    This report is accompanied by diagrams illustrating the different  contacts and the effects of the penumbra, which Cook believed was better  seen by Solander than by himself or Green. It was estimated at about  seven-eighths of the diameter of the planet, and was visible to Cook  throughout the whole Transit.    The times taken by Green were:    The first external contact: 9 hours 25 minutes 42 seconds A.M.  The first internal contact: 9 hours 44 minutes 4 seconds A.M.  The second internal contact: 3 hours 14 minutes 8 seconds P.M.  The second external contact: 3 hours 22 minutes 10 seconds P.M.    The other two parties were equally successful, and at times Banks was  able to employ himself in trading with the natives, with whom he soon got  on friendly terms; in fact, he had to decline further purchases as he had  as much as they could take away with them. He was also successful in his  botanical enquiries, obtaining several plants he had not seen in  Otaheite.    Whilst the observations were being taken some of the crew broke into the  store and stole a quantity of the large nails that were used as a medium  of trade with the islanders. One man was found with seven in his  possession, and after careful enquiry was sentenced to two dozen lashes,  which seems to have been the severest sentence meted out by Cook during  the voyage. The sentence was carried out, and though it was well known  that more than one was implicated, he refused to name any one else, but  suffered in silence.    A DOG DINNER.    The King's Birthday being on 5th June, Cook entertained several of the  chiefs at dinner, and the health of Kilnargo was toasted so many times by  some of them that the result was disastrous. One of the presents received  from a chief was a dog, which they were informed was good to eat. After  some discussion it was handed to a native named Tupia, who had made  himself very useful, and afterwards accompanied them on the voyage; and  he having smothered it with his hands, and drawn it, wrapped it in leaves  and baked it in a native oven. With some hesitation it was tasted, and  met with general approval. Cook says: \"Therefore we resolved for the  future never to despise dog flesh\"; and in another place he says they put  dog's flesh \"next only to English lamb.\" These dogs were bred for eating,  and lived entirely on vegetable food.    The main object of their stay at Otaheite having been attained, steps  were taken for further prosecution of the voyage; the ship was careened,  her bottom scraped and found free from worm, but the boats had suffered,  particularly the long-boat, which had to have a new bottom. She had been  varnished only; the other boats, painted with white lead, had not  suffered so much. The stores were overhauled, and the ship was fitted for  sea. Whilst these preparations were being made, Cook and Banks made a  circuit of the island in the pinnace to examine the coast. Several good  anchorages were found, with from sixteen to twenty-four fathoms and good  holding ground. The south-east portion was almost cut off from the  mainland by a narrow, marshy isthmus about two miles wide, over which the  natives dragged their canoes with little difficulty. On the south coast  one of the large burying-places was seen; by far the most extensive one  on the island. It is described as:    \"a long square of stonework built pyramidically; its base is 267 feet by  87 feet; at the Top it is 250 feet by 8 feet. It is built in the same  manner as we do steps leading up to a sun-dial or fountain erected in the  middle of a square, where there is a flite of steps on each side. In this  building there are 11 of such steps; each step is about 4 feet in height,  and the breadth 4 feet 7 inches, but they decreased both in height and  breadth from the bottom to the Top. On the middle of the Top stood the  image of a Bird carved in wood, near it lay the broken one of a Fish,  carved in stone. There was no hollow or cavity in the inside, the whole  being filled up with stones. The outside was faced partly with hewn  stones, and partly with others, and these were placed in such a manner as  to look very agreeable to the eye. Some of the hewn stones were 4 feet 7  inches by 2 feet 4 inches, and 15 inches thick, and had been squared and  polished with some sort of an edge tool. On the east side was, enclosed  with a stone wall, a piece of ground in form of a square, 360 feet by  354, in this was growing several cypress trees and plantains. Round about  this Morie were several smaller ones, all going to decay, and on the  Beach, between them and the sea, lay scattered up and down, a great  quantity of human bones. Not far from the Great Morie, was 2 or 3 pretty  large altars, where lay the scull bones of some Hogs and Dogs. This  monument stands on the south side of Opooreanoo, upon a low point of land  about 100 yards from the sea. It appeared to have been built many years  and was in a state of decay, as most of their Mories are. \"    They were quite unable to gain information as to the history of these  remains, nor of the religious belief of the islander, though they  appeared to have some vague notions of a future life.    AN EXCURSION INLAND.    When the party returned to Point Venus, they found the refitting nearly  complete, but the anchor stocks all had to be renewed owing to the  ravages of the sea worms, so Banks and Monkhouse made an excursion up the  river on which the camp was situated. In about nine miles the precipitous  banks had completely closed them in, and further advance was blocked by a  cliff, at least 100 feet high, over which the river fell. The natives  with them said they had never been further, so the expedition returned.  Charles Darwin, in 1835, made an attempt to ascend the same river, and  though he penetrated some distance further, he describes the country as  extremely difficult; he saw several places where two or three determined  men could easily hold at bay many times their own number.    Gardens had been laid out during their stay, and European seeds were  planted which were very fairly successful; except some brought out by  Cook in carefully sealed bottles, none of which turned out well.    Some of the sailors were either enticed away, or attempted to desert, so  Cook seized one or two of the chiefs as hostages, and the runaways were  quickly returned. Some of the natives were anxious to go away with them,  and Banks persuaded Cook to let him take Tupia, a man supposed to be of  priestly rank, who had proved himself very useful on several occasions,  and he was allowed to take with him a boy as servant. Cook records, on  leaving, that during the three months' stay they had been on very good  terms with the natives, and the few misunderstandings that did occur rose  either from the difficulty of explaining matters to each other, or else  from the inveterate habits of theft on the part of the natives--iron in  any shape being simply irresistible.    On 13th July the Endeavour sailed for Huaheine, anchoring inside the reef  on the north-west, on the 17th. Banks, Solander, Monkhouse, and Tupia at  once accompanied Cook ashore, where a ceremony, presumed to be a sort of  treaty of peace, was gone through, and then they were permitted to go  where they liked. On this ceremonial Cook says:    \"It further appear'd that the things which Tupia gave away, was for the  God of this people, as they gave us a hog and some coconuts for our God,  and thus they have certainly drawn us in to commit sacrilege, for the Hog  hath already received sentence of Death and is to be dissected tomorrow.\"    A CAREFUL PILOT.    A market was organised by Monkhouse, and as soon as the natives  understood that the stay of the ship would be very short, they managed to  produce a fairly good supply of fruits and vegetables. The people were  found to be rather lighter complexioned, and certainly not so addicted to  thieving as the Otaheitans. As a memorial of the visit, Cook gave the  chief a plate with the inscription, \"His Britannick Majesty's Ship,  Endeavour, Lieutenant Cook, Commander, 16th July, 1769, Huaheine.\" He  also added \"some medals, or counters of the English coins, struck in  1761, and other presents,\" and the recipient promised he would never part  with them. From this place they went on to Ulietea (Raiatea), landing on  the 21st; and after another ceremonial the English \"Jack\" was hoisted,  and possession taken of the whole group in the name of King George. Tupia  proved himself an excellent pilot, with great knowledge of the  localities, and, having sent down a diver at Huaheine to ascertain the  exact draught of the ship, he was very careful she never went into less  than five fathoms of water. He had evidently had great experience in  navigating these seas in canoes, boats of whose construction and sailing  qualities Cook speaks in the highest terms. Banks at this time remarks,  \"we have now seen 17 islands in these seas, and have landed on five of  the most important; the language, manners and customs agreed most  exactly.\"    Detained by adverse wind off Ataha, and finding the water coming badly  into the fore sail-room and powder-room, Cook put into the west side to  repair and take in ballast, as the ship was getting too light to carry  sail on a wind. He took the opportunity to survey to the north with Banks  and Solander.

Consequently, the number of  methods which were tried and rejected for a given setting varies from  two to five. Setting 2 proved a fairly simple one, and after the  inhibition of the tendency to choose the first box at the left, the only  definite tendency to appear was that of choosing the first box at the  right, and then the one next to it. After one hundred and thirty trials,  this method suddenly gave place to direct choice of the right box, and  during the following twenty-eight series, no error occurred for this  setting. Setting 4, on the contrary, proved extremely difficult, and a  variety of methods is more or less definitely indicated by the records.    It is needless to lengthen the description by analyzing the data for  each setting, since the reader by carefully scanning the columns of data  in table 5 may observe for himself the various tendencies and their  mutual relations.    Sobke's curve of learning (figure 19) in problem 2, is extremely  irregular, as was that of Skirrl. Similar irregularities appear in the  daily ratios of right to wrong first choices presented in the last  column of table 5. Most of these irregularities were due, I have  discovered, to unfavorable external conditions. Thus, dark rainy days  and disturbing noises outside the laboratory were obviously conditions  of poor work.    On the day following the final and correct series for problem 2, a  control series was given. In this Sobke seemed greatly surprised by the  new situations which presented themselves. Repeatedly he exhibited  impulses to enter the box which would have been the correct one in the  regular series of settings. He frequently inhibited such impulses and  chose correctly, but at other times he reacted quickly and made  mistakes. It was evident from his behavior that he was not guided by  anything like a definite idea of the relation of the right box to the  other members of the group.    In a second control series given on the following day, June 12,  confusion appeared, but less markedly. For the first setting, a correct  choice was made with deliberation. For the second setting, box 3 was  immediately chosen, as should have been the case in the regular series  of settings. Sobke seemed confused when he emerged from this box and had  difficulty in locating the right one. Then followed direct correct  choices for settings 3, 4, and 5. For setting 6, there is recorded a  deliberately made wrong choice, and so on throughout the series, the  choices being characterized by deliberateness and definite search for  the right box. Uncertainty was plainly indicated, and in this the  behavior of the animal differed markedly from that in the concluding  series of the regular experiment.    It seems safe to conclude from the results of these control series that  Sobke has no free idea of the relation of secondness from the right and  is chiefly dependent upon memory of the particular settings for cues  which lead to correct choice.      _Problem 3. Alternately First at Left and First at Right_    For four successive days after the last control series in connection  with problem 2, Sobke was merely fed in the apparatus according to  previous description (p. 43). He exhibited a wonderfully keen appetite  and was well fed during this interval between problems.    The method of experimentation chosen for problem 3 in the light of  previous experience was that of confining the monkey for a short time,  ten to fifteen seconds, in the wrong box, in each of the first ten  mistakes for a given trial, and of then aiding him to find the right box  by the slight and momentary raising of the exit door. Aid proved  necessary in a few of the trials during the first four days. Then he  worked independently. As work progressed it was found possible and also  desirable to increase the period of confinement, and in the end, sixty  seconds proved satisfactory. It was also thought desirable to increase  the number of trials per day from a single series during the early days  to two or even three series from June 29 on. Often three series could be  given in succession without difficulty. During the early trials on this  problem Sobke worked remarkably well, but later his willingness  diminished, evidently because of his failure readily to solve the  problem, and it became extremely difficult to coax him into the  apparatus. On days when he entered only reluctantly and as it seemed  against his will, he was likely to be nervous, erratic, and often slow  in making his choices, but above all he tended to waste time by not  returning to the starting point, preferring rather to loiter in the  alleyways or run back and forth.
