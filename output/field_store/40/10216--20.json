If they want the spirit and fleetness of some of our  high-bred blood-horses, they make up in gentleness, strength, and  patience. This renders them most truly valuable, as they will travel in  such places that no British horse would, with equal safety to their  drivers. Nor are the Canadian horses, when well fed and groomed, at all  deficient in beauty of colour, size, or form. They are not very often  used in logging; the ox is preferred in all rough and heavy labour of  this kind.    Just as the increasing gloom of the forest began to warn us of the  approach of evening, and I was getting weary and hungry, our driver, in  some confusion, avowed his belief that, somehow or other, he had missed  the track, though how, he could not tell, seeing there was but one road.  We were nearly two miles from the last settlement, and he said we ought  to be within sight of the lake if we were on the right road. The only  plan, we agreed, was for him to go forward and leave the team, and  endeavour to ascertain if he were near the water, and if otherwise, to  return to the house we had passed and inquire the way.    After running full half a mile ahead he returned with a dejected  countenance, saying we must be wrong, for he saw no appearance of water,  and the road we were on appeared to end in a cedar swamp, as the farther  he went the thicker the hemlocks and cedars became; so, as we had no  desire to commence our settlement by a night's lodging in a swamp--  where, to use the expression of our driver, the cedars grew as thick as  hairs on a cat's back,--we agreed to retrace our steps.    After some difficulty the lumbering machine was turned, and slowly we  began our backward march. We had not gone more than a mile when a boy  came along, who told us we might just go back again, as there was no  other road to the lake; and added, with a knowing nod of his head,  \"Master, I guess if you had known the bush as well as I, you would never  have been _fule_ enough to turn when you were going just right. Why, any  body knows that _them_ cedars and himlocks grow thickest near the water;  so you may just go back for your pains.\"    It was dark, save that the stars came forth with more than usual  brilliancy, when we suddenly emerged from the depth of the gloomy forest  to the shores of a beautiful little lake, that gleamed the more brightly  from the contrast of the dark masses of foliage that hung over it, and  the towering pine-woods that girt its banks.    Here, seated on a huge block of limestone, which was covered with a soft  cushion of moss, beneath the shade of the cedars that skirt the lake,  surrounded with trunks, boxes, and packages of various descriptions,  which the driver had hastily thrown from the waggon, sat your child, in  anxious expectation of some answering voice to my husband's long and  repeated halloo.    But when the echo of his voice had died away we heard only the gurgling  of the waters at the head of the rapids, and the distant and hoarse  murmur of a waterfall some half mile below them.    We could see no sign of any habitation, no gleam of light from the shore  to cheer us. In vain we strained our ears for the plash of the oar, or  welcome sound of the human voice, or bark of some household dog, that  might assure us we were not doomed to pass the night in the lone wood.    We began now to apprehend we had really lost the way. To attempt  returning through the deepening darkness of the forest in search of any  one to guide us was quite out of the question, the road being so ill  defined that we should soon have been lost in the mazes of the woods.  The last sound of the waggon wheels had died away in the distance; to  have overtaken it would have been impossible. Bidding me remain quietly  where I was, my husband forced his way through the tangled underwood  along the bank, in hope of discovering some sign of the house we sought,  which we had every reason to suppose must be near, though probably  hidden by the dense mass of trees from our sight.    As I sat in the wood in silence and in darkness, my thoughts gradually  wandered back across the Atlantic to my dear mother and to my old home;  and I thought what would have been your feelings could you at that  moment have beheld me as I sat on the cold mossy stone in the profound  stillness of that vast leafy wilderness, thousands of miles from all  those holy ties of kindred and early associations that make home in all  countries a hallowed spot. It was a moment to press upon my mind the  importance of the step I had taken, in voluntarily sharing the lot of  the emigrant--in leaving the land of my birth, to which, in all  probability, I might never again return. Great as was the sacrifice,  even at that moment, strange as was my situation, I felt no painful  regret or fearful misgiving depress my mind. A holy and tranquil peace  came down upon me, soothing and softening my spirits into a calmness  that seemed as unruffled as was the bosom of the water that lay  stretched out before my feet.    My reverie was broken by the light plash of a paddle, and a bright line  of light showed a canoe dancing over the lake: in a few minutes a well-  known and friendly voice greeted me as the little bark was moored among  the cedars at my feet. My husband having gained a projecting angle of  the shore, had discovered the welcome blaze of the wood fire in the log-  house, and, after some difficulty, had succeeded in rousing the  attention of its inhabitants. Our coming that day had long been given  up, and our first call had been mistaken for the sound of the ox-bells  in the wood: this had caused the delay that had so embarrassed us.    We soon forgot our weary wanderings beside the bright fire that blazed  on the hearth of the log-house, in which we found S------ comfortably  domiciled with his wife. To the lady I was duly introduced; and, in  spite of all remonstrances from the affectionate and careful mother,  three fair sleeping children were successively handed out of their cribs  to be shown me by the proud and delighted father.    Our welcome was given with that unaffected cordiality that is so  grateful to the heart: it was as sincere as it was kind. All means were  adopted to soften the roughness of our accommodation, which, if they  lacked that elegance and convenience to which we had been accustomed in  England, were not devoid of rustic comfort; at all events they were such  as many settlers of the first respectability have been glad to content  themselves with, and many have not been half so well lodged as we now  are.    We may indeed consider ourselves fortunate in not being obliged to go at  once into the rude shanty that I described to you as the only habitation  on our land. This test of our fortitude was kindly spared us by S------,  who insisted on our remaining beneath his hospitable roof till such time  as we should have put up a house on our own lot. Here then we are for  the present _fixed_, as the Canadians say; and if I miss many of the  little comforts and luxuries of life, I enjoy excellent health and  spirits, and am very happy in the society of those around me.    The children are already very fond of me. They have discovered my  passion for flowers, which they diligently search for among the stumps  and along the lake shore. I have begun collecting, and though the season  is far advanced, my hortus siccus boasts of several elegant specimens of  fern; the yellow Canadian violet, which blooms twice in the year, in the  spring and fall, as the autumnal season is expressively termed; two  sorts of Michaelmas daisies, as we call the shrubby asters, of which the  varieties here are truly elegant; and a wreath of the festoon pine, a  pretty evergreen with creeping stalks, that run along the ground three  or four yards in length, sending up, at the distance of five or six  inches, erect, stiff, green stems, resembling some of our heaths in the  dark, shining, green, chaffy leaves. The Americans ornament their  chimney-glasses with garlands of this plant, mixed with the dried  blossoms of the life-everlasting (the pretty white and yellow flowers we  call love-everlasting): this plant is also called festoon-pine. In my  rambles in the wood near the house I have discovered a trailing plant  bearing a near resemblance to the cedar, which I consider has, with  equal propriety, a claim to the name of ground or creeping cedar.    As much of the botany of these unsettled portions of the country are  unknown to the naturalist, and the plants are quite nameless, I take the  liberty of bestowing names upon them according to inclination or fancy.  But while I am writing about flowers I am forgetting that you will be  more interested in hearing what steps we are taking on our land.    My husband has hired people to log up (that is, to draw the chopped  timbers into heaps for burning) and clear a space for building our house  upon. He has also entered into an agreement with a young settler in our  vicinity to complete it for a certain sum within and without, according  to a given plan. We are, however, to call the \"bee,\" and provide every  thing necessary for the entertainment of our worthy _hive_. Now you know  that a \"bee,\" in American language, or rather phraseology, signifies  those friendly meetings of neighbours who assemble at your summons to  raise the walls of your house, shanty, barn, or any other building: this  is termed a \"raising bee.\" Then there are logging-bees, husking-bees,  chopping-bees, and quilting-bees. The nature of the work to be done  gives the name to the bee. In the more populous and long-settled  districts this practice is much discontinued, but it is highly useful,  and almost indispensable to the new settlers in the remote townships,  where the price of labour is proportionably high, and workmen difficult  to be procured.    Imagine the situation of an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13575"],[0,"How to Observe in Archaeology (#17)"],[1,"period); alabaster pots; straight-  sided cylinder seals (see XIV, Fig. 6); Syrian conical seals of  steatite (XIV, Fig. 7); small and rude clay figures of deities, such  as Ishtar or Papsukal (the guardian of buildings), and animals, such  as horses, sheep, doves, ducks, &c.; bronze pins, often with birds on  the heads; baked clay tablets of the fine Kuyunjik type (see XV, Fig.  12; script, Fig. 17); pottery lamps with long protruding curved  nozzles; pottery vases simple and undecorated save by incised lines,  as for many centuries past (for types see XIV, Figs. 9 a b c d);  light-blue glazed ware introduced from Egypt towards end of period;  polychrome glazed ware with designs of rosettes, chevrons) &c.,  somewhat earlier; large pots without feet common for storage of grain  and oil, sometimes for tablets: mouth often closed with a brick.  Stone pithoi are also found. Vertical drains or sinks, made of a  number of pottery cylindrical drums, fitting on top of or into one  another, are found everywhere on town-mounds of this period; visitors  should avoid tumbling into them, as they are often open or only  covered by a very thin crust of earth. Usually they are perforated to  allow of soaking into the surrounding earth, and are, when excavated  whole, generally found capped by, a beehive-shaped perforated cover.  Sometimes these drains were made of old pots with their lower parts  broken off, and fitted into one another. Secular buildings were of  burnt brick; sacred buildings usually of crude brick, from religious  conservatism. Crude bricks nearly always oblong; burnt bricks square  (14 ins.) or oblong (9x6x3 ins.). The burnt brick of Nebuchadnezzar's  time is extraordinarily fine and hard, and the bitumen-mortar so  finely spread as to be almost invisible (Babylon). Walls of this  reign have a rock-like solidity and tenacity that should make them  easily recognizable. Those of immediately preceding reigns show the  bitumen far more clearly, and the bricks are usually not as finely  made as Nebuchadnezzar's; at Babylon the latter's work is thus at  once distinguishable from that of Nabopolassar. A typical brick-  inscription of Nebuchadnezzar is illustrated above, XV, Fig. 11. It  is in the revived archaic script, always used for this purpose by the  late Babylonian kings. Use of coloured glazed brick is characteristic  of period; often relief figures of animals are made up of glazed  bricks each specially moulded for its proper position and numbered  (Ishtar Gate, Babylon). Royal palaces were often decorated with  reliefs depicting conquests, &c., carved on slabs of alabastrine  marble placed along the brick walls, with great statues of human-  headed bulls (_Cherubim_), &c. (Nimrud [CALAH], Kuyunjik [NINEVEH],  Khorsabad. _Brit. Mus._ and _Louvre_.) Burials usually in drab clay  pot-coffins (larnakes) with covers; bodies still contracted; funerary  furniture scanty, consisting chiefly of pins, beads, an occasional  cylinder-seal, and a few pots (XIV, Figs. 9 a b c d). Ribbed pots  with blue (weathered green) glaze, often pitched both within and  without, were also employed towards the end of the period, inverted  over the bodies. Also anthropoid pottery sarcophagi, an idea imported  from Egypt. Child burials in bowls. Iron objects sometimes buried  with the dead; often found in palace-ruins (weapons, horse-furniture,  &c.). Bronze commonly used for gates, door, bolts, &c. (Gates of  Shalmaneser's palace; _Brit. Mus._).    2. Persian (Achaemenian) period: c. 540-330 B.C.    This period is distinguished from the former by the less frequent use  of bronze, the introduction of coinage, and the development of the  simplified Persian cuneiform writing (never on tablets, only on stone  monuments; see XV, Fig. 18). Bitumen ceased to be used as mortar in  buildings. Persian walls (e. g. the Apadana at Babylon) are easily  distinguished by the use of clay mortar, and the unusual thickness of  the mortar-courses between the bricks. Burials in shallow trough-like  pottery coffins, with the bodies at full length, but with the knees  slightly flexed (these continued during the next period).      VI. MIDDLE IRON AGE:  1. Greek and Parthian periods; c. 330 B.C.-220 A.D.    Characteristics. Sudden degeneration and disappearance of the ancient  native civilization and art; imitation of Greek culture, Greek  buildings (theatre at Babylon), and inscriptions; Greek legends on  Parthian coins; Parthian kings call themselves 'Philhellenes';  Graeco-Roman architecture imitated (Hatra). Graeco-Roman terra-  cottas, pottery lamps, pilgrim-flasks and bone-carvings; classical  seal gems; Roman glass; fragments of imitation of classical sculpture  in marble (the material being adopted as well as the style); and, of  course, coins--these are characteristic remains found on mounds of  this period. About l00 B.C. the use of cuneiform was given up; clay  tablets were no longer used. Aramaic became the usual form of  writing; ink used on sherds; wax tablets. Small bowls often found  with ink-written incantations in Judaeo-Aramaic (see XV, Fig. 19).  Mounds of this period are perhaps most easily recognized by the  quantities of deep-blue glazed sherds found lying about on them. The  glaze is rather thin, laid on a coarse drab ware, and is often  cracked. The blue is very fine, rivalling the old Egyptian. Burials  of this period are often found in (besides the shallow pottery  coffins mentioned above) rectangular oblong boxes of thin coarse ware  with light friable blue glaze (Babylon), or (later) in slipper-shaped  coffins (possibly Sassanian) of the same ware, rudely decorated with  human figures (warriors) in relief, on panels (Warka). The blue glaze  has often changed to a dark green, especially in the case of the  Warka slipper-coffins. The lids are cemented to the coffins.  Internments are now full length, the old custom of contraction having  been entirely abandoned [1]. Gold ornaments and pieces of gold leaf,  gold fillets, &c., are not unfrequently found with the bodies,  besides armlets, toe and finger rings, &c., of silver and bronze, the  finger-rings usually of ordinary Roman types; pottery, lamps, and  glass vessels. These coffins are often in brick vaults, usually  placed haphazard in the ground, as in earlier times. Bricks small,  hard, and yellow.    [1] The western custom of cremation was never adopted, in spite of  the Hellenization of culture. It offended both Babylonian and Iranian  sentiment, although the Parthians were never very orthodox followers  of Ahuramazda, and venerated (at least platonically) the most popular  deities of the Greek pantheon.      2. Sassanian Period; c. 220-650 A.D.    Characteristics. Reaction towards Oriental motives in art: a typical  _antika_ of the period is the Sassanian seal of cornelian,  chalcedony, or haematite, in shape sometimes a ring, more often a  flat sphere with one-third cut off to form a seal-base, perforated  for stringing (see XIV, Fig. 8), and inscribed in Pehlevi (see XV,  Fig. 20) a script that to the unitiated looks very like Cufie Arabic:  the language is Old-Persian, which was spoken by the court officials  at Ctesiphon, the language of the people being Aramaic. Sculpture  barbarized, but with a picturesque character of its own (Nakhsh-i-  Rustam, Tak-i-Bostan), sometimes reminiscent of Indian work.  Architecture: Parthian-Roman traditions (Ctesiphon). Pottery usually  glazed blue (thicker glaze). Unglazed bowls with Hebrew and Mandaitic  magical inscriptions. Bronze no longer used except for coins. Objects  from mounds very like those of preceding age, but less of Roman  origin. Not much known of burials; the Warka slipper-coffins usually  regarded as Parthian may possibly be of early Sassanian age.      VII. LATER IRON AGE:  Muhammadan Period; c. 650-1500 A.D.[1]    Characteristics. Development of art under Persian influence till  Tartar conquest in thirteenth century: the destruction and  depopulation of the country at that time brought all real artistic  development to an end. Flourishing period: the 'Abbasid Khalifate:  ninth century: Harun al-Rashid. Ruins of the ancient city and palaces  of Samarra: halls with modelled and painted plaster-decorations, not  only geometrical but also (Persian heterodox influence) representing  trees, birds, &c. No more sculpture in round or relief of human  figures or animals. The only survival of classical tradition would  appear to be to some extent in architecture: Greek architects.    Coins: thin gold, and silver, with Cufic inscriptions only (see XV,  Fig. 21). Mounds of this period may be known by fragments of marble-  carving with Cufic inscriptions, plasterwork, Arab and Persian vase  and tile fragments in thick blue, green, yellow, or brown glaze,  metallic lustre-glaze, &c., variegated glass bangles, and rings; bits  of cloudy white glass (from lamps); fragments of wood, carved and  inlaid with bone, nacre, &c., in geometrical patterns; textile  fragments, (which are naturally not commonly found in older mounds),  &c.    Nothing is said with regard to burials as these may not be touched.    [1] The limit of age which constitutes an 'antiquity' for legal  purposes is fixed in most antiquity-laws at 1500 A.D.          APPENDIX    LAWS OF ANTIQUITIES     The following brief notes on the Laws of Antiquities in force in the  various territories with which this book is concerned must not be  taken as absolving the traveller from the necessity of consulting the  full text of the laws. At the time of going to press, the Turkish Law  presumably prevails in such parts of the Turkish Empire as are not  occupied by the troops of the Entente; in the remainder, temporary  regulations are in force which will doubtless be modified when the  new governments are established; and it is possible that the Turkish  Law itself may be brought into greater harmony with modern ideas.
