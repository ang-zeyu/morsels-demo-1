The  lawe commaunded that as many as would steale, should entre their names with  the chief Prieste: and what so euer was stollen, incontinente to cary the  same vnto hym. Likewise, he that was robbed was bounde to entre with the  saied Chiefe Priest, the daie, time and houre, when he was robbed. By this  meanes the thefte being easely founde out, he that was robbed, loste the  fourths parte and receiued the residue, the whiche fourthe was giuen to the  thiefe. For the Lawe maker (seeing it was impossible vtterly to be withoute  thieues) thought it moche bettre by this meanes that men bare the losse of  a piece then to be spoiled of the whole.    The ordre of Mariage emong the Egiptians is not vniforme, for the priest  might marry but one onely wife. All other haue as many as they wille,  acordyng to their substaunce. Ther is no child emong them, though it be  borne of a bought woman slaue, that is compted illegitimate. For they onely  compte the father to be the authour of his kynde, and the mother onely but  to geue place and nourishement to the childe. When their children be borne  they bring them vp with so lytle coste, as a man would skantly belieue.  They fiede them with the rootes of mererushes, and other rootes, rosted in  the embries, and with marshe Caubois, and colewortes which partly they  seathe, and partly they roste, and parte giue them rawe. They go for the  moste parte withoute hosen or shoes, all naked, the contry is so temperate.  All the coste that the Parentes bestowe on their children til they be of  age to shift for themselues, surmounteth not the somme of a noble.  [Footnote: Equal to six shillings and eight pence.]    The priestes bring vp the children, both in the doctrine of their holye  scriptures, and also in the other kindes of learning necessary for the  commune life, and chiefly in Geometry and Arithmetique. As for the roughe  exercises of wrasteling, ronning, daunsing, playeng at weapons, throwyng  the barre or suche like, they train not their youth in, supposyng that the  daily exercise of suche, shoulde be to roughe, and daungerous for them, and  that they should be an empeiryng of strength. Musique they doe not onely  compte vnprofitable, but also hurteful: as making mens courages altogether  womanlyke. When they are sicke, they heale themselues, eyther with fasting  or vomiting: and that either euery eche other daye, or euery third daye, or  fourthe. For they are of opinion that all diseases growe of superfluite of  meate, and that kinde of cure therfore to be beste, that riddeth the  grounde of the griefe. Men goyng to the warres, or traueillyng the  countrie, are healed of free cost. For the Phisicens and Chirurgiens, haue  a stipende allowed them of ordenary at the charge of the communes.    In curing, they are bounde to folowe the preceptes of the auncient and  allowed writers, regestred in their holy scripture. Yf a man folowing the  prescripte of the scriptures can not so heale the sicke, he is not blamed  for that: But yf he fortune to heale him by any other meanes then is in the  scripture appoincted, he dieth for it. For the lawe giuer thoughte that it  was harde to finde a bettre waye of curyng, then that the which of suche  antiquitie was by longe practise founde oute and allowed, and deliuered  vnto them by suche a continuaunce. The Egiptians do worship aboue measure  certeine beastes, not onely whilest they be onliue, [Footnote: I have never  met with this form of the word.] but also when they are dead. As the Catte,  the Icneumon the dogge, the hauke, the woulfe, the Cocodrille, and many  other like. They are not onely not ashamed to professe the worship of these  openly, but setting them selues out in the honouring of them to the  vttermoste: they compte it asmuch praise and glory to them selues, as yf  they bestowed the like on the Goddes. And they go about on procession with  the propre Images of them, from citie, to citie, and from place, to place;  holding them vp and shewing them a farre of vnto other, which fall on their  knees, and euery one worship them. When any one of them dieth, they couer  it with Sarcenet, and houling, and crieng, and beating of their breastes  they all to bestrawe the carckesse with salte. And after they haue embalmed  it with the licour of the Cedre and other fragraunt oyntmentes, and oyles,  to preserue it the longer: thei bewrye it in holy sepulture. If a man haue  slayne any of these beastes willingly: he is codempned to death. But yf he  haue slaine an catte or a snyte, [Footnote: A snipe, from the Saxon snyta.  \"Greene-plover, snyte, / Partridge, larke, cocke, and phessant.\" _Heyw.  Engl. Trav_., Act i., Scene ii.] willingly or vnwillingly: the people  ronneth vpon him vppon heapes, and withoute all ordre of Iustice or lawe,  in moste miserable wise torment him to death. Vpon feare of the which  daungier who soeuer espieth one of those lyeng dead: standing a farre, he  howleth and crieth professing that he is not giltie of the death. These  beastes with great attendaunce and chardge are kept vp aboute the cloistres  of the Temple, by men of no meane reputation: whiche fiede them with floure  and otemeale, and diuers deinties, sopped and stieped in milke. And they  set euery daie before them goose, bothe sodden and rosted. And before those  that delight al in raw meate they sette birdes and rawe foules. Finally as  I said they kiepe them all with great diligence and coste. They lament  their death asmoche as the death of their owne children, and bury them more  sumptuously then their substance doth stretch. In so moche that Ptolomeus  Lagus reigning in Egipt, when there chaunced a cowe to die in Memphis for  very age: he that had taken charge of the kepyng of her, bestowed vpon the  buriall of her (beside a greate some of mony that was giuen him for the  keping) fiftie talentes of siluer, that he borowed of Ptolome.

Joseph C. Ives was at the Moki Pueblo of Mooskahneh  [Mi-shong-i-ni-vi]. \"The town is nearly square,\" he remarks,  \"and surrounded by a stone wall fifteen feet high, the top of which  forms a landing extending around the whole. Flights of stone steps  lead from the first to a second landing, upon which the doors of the  houses open. Mounting the stairway opposite to the ladder, the chief  crossed to the nearest door and ushered us into a low apartment,  from which two or three others opened towards the interior of the  dwelling. Our host courteously asked us to be seated upon some skins  spread along the floor against the wall and presently his wife  brought in a vase of water and a tray filled with a singular  substance that looked more like sheets of thin blue wrapping paper  rolled up into bundles than anything else that I have ever seen. I  learned afterwards that it was made of corn meal, ground very fine,  made into a gruel, and poured over a heated stone to be baked. When  dry it has a surface slightly polished like paper. The sheets are  folded and rolled together, and form the staple article of food with  the Moki Indians. As the dish was intended for our entertainment,  and looked clean, we all partook of it. It had a delicate  fresh-bread flavor, and was not at all unpalatable, particularly  when eaten with salt.\" [Footnote: Report upon Colorado River of the  West, Lieut. Ives, p. 121.]    Lieutenant-Colonel (now General) Emory visited the Pima villages on  the Gila River in 1846. \"I rode leisurely in the rear through the  thatched huts of the Pimas. Each abode consisted of a dome-shaped  wicker-work about six feet high, and from twenty to fifty feet in  diameter, thatched with straw or cornstalks. In front is usually a  large arbor, on top of which is piled the cotton on the pod for  drying. In the houses were stowed watermelons, pumpkins, beans, corn,  and wheat, the three last articles generally in large baskets.  Sometimes the corn was in baskets, covered with earth, and placed on  the tops of the domes. A few chickens and dogs were seen, but no  other domestic animals except horses, mules, and oxen.... Several  acquaintances formed in our camp yesterday, were recognized, and  they received me cordially, made signs to dismount, and when I did  so offered watermelons and pinole. Pinole is the heart of Indian corn,  baked, ground up, and mixed with sugar. When dissolved in water it  affords a delicious beverage; it quenches thirst, and is very  nutritious.... The population of the Pimas and Maricopas together is  estimated variously at from three to ten thousand. The first is  evidently too low. This peaceful and industrious race are in  possession of a beautiful and fertile basin. Living remote from the  civilized world they are seldom visited by whites, and then only by  those in distress, to whom they generously furnish horses and food.\"  [Footnote: Military Reconnaissance in New Mexico, pp. 85, 86.]    In this case and in those stated by Lieutenant Ives and Dr.  Tenbroeck we find a repetition of the Iroquois rule to set food  before the guest when he first enters the house.    With respect to the Village Indians of Mexico, Central and South  America, our information is, in the main, limited to the hospitality  extended to the Spaniards; but it is sufficient to show that it was  a part of their plan of life, and, as it must be supposed, a  repetition of their usages in respect to each other. In every part  of America that they visited, the Spaniards, although often in  numbers as a military force, were assigned quarters in Indian houses,  emptied of their inhabitants for that purpose, and freely supplied  with provisions. Thus at Zempoala \"the lord came out, attended by  ancient men, two persons of note supporting him by the arms, because  it was the custom among them to come out in that manner when one  great man received another. This meeting was with much courtesy and  abundance of compliments, and people were already appointed to find  the Spaniards quarters and furnish provisions\" [Footnote: Herrera's  History of America, ii, 212.]    When near Tlascala the Tlascallans \"sent three hundred turkeys, two  hundred baskets of cakes of teutli, which they call tamales, being  about two hundred arrobas; that is, fifty hundred weight of bread,  which was an extraordinary supply for the Spaniards, considering the  distress they were in;\" and when at Tlascala, Cortes and his men  \"were generously treated, and supplied with all necessaries.\"  [Footnote: ib., ii. 261, 279.]    \"They entered Cholula and went to a house where they lodged  altogether, and their Indians with them, although upon their guard,  being for the present plentifully supplied with provisions.\"  [Footnote: ib., ii, 311]    Although the Spaniards numbered about four hundred, and their allied  Indians about a thousand, they found accommodations in a single  joint tenement house of the Aboriginal American model. Attention is  called to this fact, because we shall find the Village Indians, as a  rule, living in large houses, each containing many apartments, and  accommodating five hundred or more persons. The household of several  families of the northern Indians reappears in the southern tribes in  a much greater household of a hundred or more families in a single  joint tenement house, but not unlikely broken up into several  household groups. The pueblo consisted sometimes of one, sometimes  of two or three, and sometimes of a greater number of such houses.  The plan of life within these houses is not well understood, but it  can still be seen in New Mexico, and it is to be hoped it will  attract investigation.    Speaking of the Maya Indians of Yucatan, Herrera remarks that  \"they are still generous and free-hearted, so that they will make  everybody eat that comes into their houses, which is everywhere  practiced in traveling.\" [Footnote: Herrera's History of America,  iv, 117.]    This is a fair statement of the Iroquois law of hospitality found  among the Mayas, practiced among themselves and towards strangers  from other tribes. When Grijalva, about 1517, discovered the Tabasco  River, he held friendly intercourse with some of the tribes of  Yucatan. \"They immediately sent thirty Indians loaded with roasted  fish, hens, several sorts of fruit, and bread made of Indian wheat.\"  [Footnote: ib., ii, 126]    When Cortes, in 1525, made his celebrated expedition to Honduras, he  passed near the pueblo of Palenque and near that of Copan without  being aware of either, and visited the shore of Lake Peten.  \"Being well received in the city of Apoxpalan, Cortes and all the  Spaniards, with their horses, were quartered in one house, the  Mexicans being dispersed into others, and all of them plentifully  supplied with provisions during their stay.\" [Footnote: ib., iii, 359.]    They numbered one hundred and fifty Spanish horse and several  hundred Aztecs. It was at this place, according to Herrera, that  Quatemozin, who accompanied Cortes as a prisoner, was barbarously  executed by his command. [Footnote: ib., iii, 361.] Cortes next  visited an island in Lake Peten, where he was sumptuously  entertained by Canec, the chief of the tribe, where they \"sat down  to dinner in stately manner, and Canec ordered fowls, fish cakes,  honey, and fruit.\" [Footnote: ib., iii, 362.]    In South America the same account of the hospitality of the Indian  tribes is given by the early explorers. About the year 1500  Christopher Guerra made a voyage to the coast of Venezuela:  \"They came to an anchor before a town called Curiana, where the  Indians entreated them to go ashore, but the Spaniards being no more  than thirty-three in all durst not venture.... At length, being  convinced of their sincerity, the Spaniards went ashore, and being  courteously entertained, staid there twenty days. They plentifully  supplied them for food with venison, rabbits, geese, ducks, parrots,  fish, bread made of maize or Indian wheat, and other things, and  brought them all the game they would ask for.... They perceived  that they kept markets or fairs, and that they made use of jars,  pitchers, pots, dishes, and porringers, besides other vessels of  several shapes.\" [Footnote: Herrera's Hist. America, iv, 248.]    Pizarro found the same custom among the Peruvians and other tribes  of the coast. At the time of his first visit to the coast of Peru he  found a female chief by whom he was entertained. \"The lady came out  to meet them with a great retinue, in good order, holding green  boughs and ears of Indian wheat, having made an arbor where were  seats for the Spaniards, and for the Indians at some distance. They  gave them to eat fish and flesh dressed in several ways, much fruit,  and such bread and liquor as the country afforded.\" [Footnote: ib.,  i, 229.]    When on the coast of Tumbez, and before landing, \"ten or twelve  floats were immediately sent out with a plenty of provisions, fruits,  pots of water, and of chica, which is their liquor, as also a lamb.\"  [Footnote: ib., iv, 3.]    After entering Peru, on his second visit to the coast, \"Atahuallpa's  messengers came and presented the governor with ten of their sheep  from the Inca, and some other things of small value, telling him  very courteously that Atahuallpa had commanded them to inquire what  day he intended to be at Caxamalca, that he might have provisions on  the way.\" [Footnote: ib., iii, 399.]           *       *       *       *       *    \"The next day more messengers came from Atahuallpa with provisions,  which he received with thanks.\". [Footnote: ib., iv, 244.]    The native historian, Garcilasso de la Viga, remarks: \"Nor were the  Incas, among their other charities,"]]]
