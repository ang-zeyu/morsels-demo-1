Then the otter and  the rat said to the cat \"Now it is your turn: we have both recovered  the ring once, but we cannot go into the house of these humans. They  will let you go near them easily enough; the ring is in the fish's  stomach, you must watch whether they throw away the stomach or clean  it, and find an opportunity for carrying off the ring.\"    So the cat ran after the women and when they began to cut up the  fish, it kept mewing round them. They threw one or two scraps to it,  but it only sniffed at them and would not eat them; then they began  to wonder what on earth the cat wanted, and at last they threw the  stomach to it. This it seized on gladly and carried it off and tore  it open and found the ring and ran off with it to where the otter  and the rat were waiting. Then the three friends travelled hard for  a day and a night and reached the prison in which Lita was confined.    When Lita got the ring he begged his jailer to get him a _seer_  of milk and when it was brought he dropped the ring in it, and said  \"I wish the bed on which my faithless wife and her lover are sleeping  to be brought here with them in it this very night\" and before morning  the bed was brought to the prison. Then the magistrate was called and  when he saw that the wife was alive he released Lita, and the lover  who had run away with her had to pay Lita double the expenditure  which had been incurred on his marriage, and was fined beside.    But Lita married another wife and lived happily with her. And some  time afterwards he called the otter and the cat and the rat to him  and said that he purposed to let them go and before they parted he  would give them anything they wished for. They said that he owed them  nothing, and they made Lita promise to let them know if ever he lost  the ring or fell into trouble, and he promised to help them if ever  their lives were in danger, and one morning he took them to a bazar,  near which was a tank full of fish, and he turned the otter into  the tank and left the cat and the rat to support themselves in the  bazar. The next day he went to see them and the otter came out of  the tank and gave him a fish which it had caught, and the cat brought  him some milk it had stolen, and that was the last he saw of them.          XXIII. The Boy Who Found His Father.    There was once a boy who used always to cheat when playing _Kati_  (pitch and toss) and for this the village boys with whom he played used  to quarrel with him, saying \"Fatherless orphan, why do you cheat?\" So  one day he asked his mother why they called him that name and whether  his father was really dead. \"He is alive\" said she \"but a long time  ago a rhinoceros carried him off on its horn.\" Then the boy vowed  that he would go in search of his father and made his mother put him  up provisions for the journey; and he started off taking with him an  iron bow and a big bundle of arrows.    He journeyed on all day and at nightfall he came to a village; there he  went up to the house of an old woman to ask for a bed. He stood at the  threshhold and called out to her \"Grannie, grannie, open the door.\" \"I  have no son, and no grandchildren to call me grannie,\" grumbled the  old woman and went to open the door to see who was there, and when she  opened the door and saw him, she said \"Ho, you are my grandson.\" \"Yes,\"  answered he, \"I am your grandchild.\" So she called him inside and gave  him a bed to sleep on. The old woman was called Hutibudi; and she and  the boy sat up late talking together and then they lay down to sleep;  but in the middle of the night he heard the old woman crunching away  trying to bite his bow to pieces. He asked her what she was eating:  \"Some pulse I got from the village headman,\" \"Give me a little to  try\" he begged. \"I am sorry my child, I have finished it all.\" But  really she had none to give, however she only hurt her jaws biting  so that she began to groan with pain: \"What are you groaning for,  Grannie?\" said the boy; \"Because I have toothache\" she answered: and  in truth her cheeks were badly swollen. Then he told her that a good  cure for toothache was to bite on a white stone and she believed him  and the next morning got a piece of white quartz and began to bite on  it; but this only broke her teeth and made her mouth bleed so that the  pain was worse than before: then the boy jeered at her and said. \"Did  you think, Grannie, that you could bite my iron bow and arrows?\"    So saying he left her and continued the search for his father and  his road led him to a dense jungle which seemed to have no end, and  in the middle of the jungle he came to a lake and he sat down by it  to eat what was left of the provisions he had brought: as he sat,  he suddenly saw some cow-bison coming down to the lake: at this he  caught up his bow and arrows in a hurry and climbed up a tall _sal_  tree: from the tree he watched the bison go down to the water to drink  and then go back into the jungle. And after them tigers and bears  came down to the water: the sight of them frightened him and he sang:--          \"Drink your fill, tiger,      I shall not shoot you.      I shall shoot the giant rhinceros.\"      and they drank and went away. Then various kinds of birds came and  after them a great herd of rhinceroses and among them was one which  had the dried up body of the boy's father stuck on its horn. The boy  was rather frightened and sang          \"Drink your fill, rhinceroses,      I shall not shoot you      I shall shoot the giant rhinceros.\"      and when the giant rhinceros with the body of his father stooped its  head to drink from the lake, he put an arrow through it and it turned  a somersault and fell over dead: while all the other rhinceroses  turned tail and ran away. Then the boy climbed down from the tree and  pulled the dead body of his father off the horn of the dead animal and  laid it down at the foot of a tree and began to weep over it. As he  wept a man suddenly stood before him and asked what was the matter,  and when he heard, said \"Cry no more: take a cloth and wet it in the  lake and cover your father's body with it: and then whip the body  with a _meral_ twig and he will come to life.\" So saying the stranger  suddenly disappeared; and the boy obeyed his instructions and behold  his father sat up alive and rubbing his eyes said \"I must have been  asleep a very long time.\" Then his son explained to him all that had  happened and gave him some food and took him home.          XXIV. The Oilman's Bullock.    There was once a poor but industrious oilman; he got a log of wood  and carved out an oil mill and, borrowing some money as capital,  he bought mustard and sesame seed and set to work to press it; as he  had no bullock he had to turn the mill himself. He was so industrious  that he soon began to prosper and was able to buy a bullock for his  mill. By and bye he got so rich that he was able to buy some land and  a cart and pair of bullocks and was quite a considerable man in the  village. One day one of his cart bullocks died and this loss was a  sad blow to the oilman. However he tied up the surviving bullock in  the stable along with the old oil mill bullock and fed them well. One  night it chanced that one of the villagers passed by the stable and  hear the two animals talking and this is what he heard.    The young bullock said \"You came to this house first, friend; what  sort of treatment does one get here?\"    \"Why do you ask me?\" said the other. \"Oh, I see your shoulder is  galled and your neck shows mark of the yoke.\" The old bullock answered  \"Whether my master treats me well or ill I owe him money and have to  stay here until I have paid him off. When I have paid him five hundred  rupees I shall go.\" \"How will you ever pay back such a sum?\" \"If  my master would only match me to fight the Raja's elephant for five  hundred rupees I should win the fight and my debt would be cleared;  and if he does not do that I shall probably have to work for him all  my life. How long do you intend to stay?\" \"My debt will be cleared  if I work for him two years\" answered the new comer.    The man who overheard this conversation was much astonished and  went off to the oilman and told him all about it. Next day the whole  village had heard of it and they were all anxious for the oilman to  match his bullock against the Raja's elephant; but the oilman was  very frightened, for he feared that if he sent such a challenge, the  Raja would be angry with him and drive him out of the country. But  the leading villagers urged him and undertook to find the money if he  lost, and to persuade the Raja that the oilman was mad, if he became  angry with him. At last the oilman consented, provided that some of  the villagers went to the Raja and proposed the match; he was too  frightened to go himself. So two of the village elders went to the  Raja and asked him to match his elephant against the oilman's bullock  for five hundred rupees; the Raja was very much amused and at once  fixed a day for the fight. So they returned and told the oilman to  be ready and raised a subscription of five hundred rupees.    The evening before the contest the oilman gave the bullock a big feed  of meal and oilcake; and on the eventful morning the villagers all  collected and watched him oiling its horns and tying a bell round its  neck. Then the oilman gave the bullock a slap on its back and said  \"Take care: you are going to fight an elephant; if you owe me so much  money you will win, and if not, then you will be defeated.\" When  he said this the bullock pawed the ground and snorted and put down  its head.    Then they all set out with the five hundred rupees to a level field  near the Raja's palace; a great crowd collected to see the fun and  the Raja went there expecting easily to win five hundred rupees. The  elephant was brought forward with vermilion on its cheeks, and a  pad on its back, and a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11951"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 1 (#17)"],[1,"tive, called together at Lyons  delegates from the sixty Gallic cityships, to take part (B.C.12 or 10) in  the inauguration of a magnificent monument raised, at the confluence of  the Rhone and Saone, in honor of Rome and Augustus as the tutelary  deities of Gaul.  In the middle of a vast enclosure was placed a huge  altar of white marble, on which were engraved the names of the sixty  cityships \"of the long hair.\"  A colossal statue of the Gauls and sixty  statues of the Gallic cityships occupied the enclosure.  Two columns of  granite, twenty-five feet high, stood close by the altar, and were  surmounted by two colossal Victories, in white marble, ten feet high.  Solemn festivals, gymnastic games, and oratorical and literary  exercitations accompanied the inauguration; and during the ceremony it  was announced, amidst popular acclamation, that a son had just been born  to Drusus at Lyons itself, in the palace of the emperor, where the  child's mother, Antonia, daughter of Marc Antony and Octavia (sister of  Augustus), had been staying for some months.  This child was one day to  be the emperor Claudius.    [Illustration: FROM LA CROIX ROUSSE----86]    The administrative energy of Augustus was not confined to the erection of  monuments and to festivals; he applied himself to the development in Gaul  of the material elements of civilization and social order.  His most  intimate and able adviser, Agrippa, being settled at Lyons as governor of  the Gauls, caused to be opened four great roads, starting from a  milestone placed in the middle of the Lyonnese forum, and going, one  centrewards to Saintes and the ocean, another southwards to Narbonne and  the Pyrenees, the third north-westwards and towards the Channel by Amiens  and Boulogne, and the fourth north-westwards and towards the Rhine.  Agrippa founded several colonies, amongst others Cologne, which bore his  name; and he admitted to Gallic territory bands of Germans who asked for  an establishment there.  Thanks to public security, Romans became  proprietors in the Gallic provinces and introduced to them Italian  cultivation.  The Gallic chieftains, on their side, began to cultivate  lands which had become their personal property.  Towns were built or grew  apace and became encircled by ramparts, under protection of which the  populations came and placed themselves.  The most learned and attentive  observer of nature and Roman society, Pliny the Elder, attests that under  Augustus Gallic agriculture and industry made vast progress.    But side by side with this work in the cause of civilization and  organization, Augustus and his Roman agents were pursuing a work of quite  a contrary tendency.  They labored to extirpate from Gaul the spirit of  nationality, independence, and freedom; they took every pains to efface  everywhere Gallic memories and sentiments.  Gallic towns were losing  their old and receiving Roman names: Augustonemetum, Augusta, and  Augustodunum took the place of Gergovia, Noviodunum, and Bibracte.  The  national Gallic religion, which was Druidism, was attacked as well as the  Gallic fatherland, with the same design and by the same means; at one  time Augustus prohibited this worship amongst the Gauls converted into  Roman citizens, as being contrary to Roman belief; at another Roman  Paganism and Gallic Druidism were fused together in the same temples and  at the same altars, as if to fuse them in the same common indifference;  Roman and Gallic names became applied to the same religious  personification of such and such a fact or such and such an idea; Mars  and Camul were equally the god of war; Belen and Apollo the god of light  and healing; Diana and Arduinna the goddess of the chase.  Everywhere,  whether it was a question of the terrestrial fatherland or of religious  faith, the old moral machinery of the Gauls was broken up or condemned to  rust, and no new moral machinery was allowed to replace it; it was  everywhere Roman and imperial authority that was substituted for the  free, national action of the Gauls.    It is incredible that this hostility on the part of the powers that be  towards moral sentiments, and this absence of freedom, should not have  gravely compromised the material interest of the Gallic population.  Public administration, however extensive its organization and energy, if  it be not under the superintendence and restraint of public freedom and  morality, soon falls into monstrous abuses, which itself is either  ignorant of or wittingly suffers.  Examples of this evil, inherent in  despotism, abound even under the intelligent and watchful sway of  Augustus.  Here is a case in point.  He had appointed as procurator, that  is, financial commissioner, in \"long-haired\" Gaul, a native who, having  been originally a slave and afterwards set free by Julius Caesar, had  taken the Roman name of Licinius.  This man gave himself up, during his  administration, to a course of the most shameless extortion.  The taxes  were collected monthly; and so, taking advantage of the change of name  which flattery had caused in the two months of July and August, sacred to  Julius Caesar and Augustus respectively, he made his year consist of  fourteen months, so that he might squeeze out fourteen contributions  instead of twelve.  \"December,\" said he, \"is surely, as its name  indicates, the tenth month of the year,\" and he added thereto, in honor  of the emperor, two others which he called the eleventh and twelfth.  During one of the trips which Augustus made into Gaul, strong complaints  were made against Licinius, and his robberies were denounced to the  emperor.  Augustus dared not support him, and seemed upon the point of  deciding to bring him to justice, when Licinius conducted him to the  place where was deposited all the treasure he had extorted, and, \"See, my  lord,\" said he, \"what I have laid up for thee and for the Roman people,  for fear lest the Gauls possessing so much gold should employ it against  you both; for thee I have kept it, and to thee I deliver it.\"  (Thierry,  _Histoire des Gaulois,_ t. iii.  p. 295; Clerjon, _Histoire de Lyon,_  t. i.  p. 178-180.) Augustus accepted the treasure, and Licinius remained  unpunished.  In the case of financial abuses or other acts, absolute  power seldom resists such temptations.    We may hear it said, and we may read in the writings of certain modern  philosophers and scholars, that the victorious despotism of the Roman  empire was a necessary and salutary step in advance, and that it brought  about the unity and enfranchisement of the human race.  Believe it not.  There is mingled good and evil in all the events and governments of this  world, and good often arises side by side with or in the wake of evil,  but it is never from the evil that the good comes; injustice and tyranny  have never produced good fruits.  Be assured that whenever they have the  dominion, whenever the moral rights and personal liberties of men are  trodden under foot by material force, be it barbaric or be it scientific,  there can result only prolonged evils and deplorable obstacles to the  return of moral right and moral force, which, God be thanked, can never  he obliterated from the nature and the history of man.  The despotic  imperial administration upheld for a long while the Roman empire, and not  without renown; but it corrupted, enervated, and impoverished the Roman  populations, and left them, after five centuries, as incapable of  defending themselves as they were of governing.    Tiberius pursued in Gaul, but with less energy and less care for the  provincial administration, the pacific and moderate policy of Augustus.  He had to extinguish in Belgica, and even in the Lyonnese province, two  insurrections kindled by the sparks that remained of national and Druidic  spirit.  He repressed them effectually, and without any violent display  of vengeance.  He made a trip to Gaul, took measures, quite insufficient,  however, for defending the Rhine frontier from the incessantly repeated  incursions of the Germans, and hastened back to Italy to resume the  course of suspicion, perfidy, and cruelty which he pursued against the  republican pride and moral dignity remaining amongst a few remnants of  the Roman senate.  He was succeeded by Germanicus' unworthy son,  Caligula.  After a few days of hypocrisy on the part of the emperor, and  credulous hope on that of the people, they found a madman let loose to  take the place of an unfathomable and gloomy tyrant.  Caligula was much  taken up with Gaul, plundering it and giving free rein in it to his  frenzies, by turns disgusting or ridiculous.  In a short and fruitless  campaign on the banks of the Rhine, he had made too few prisoners for the  pomp of a triumph; he therefore took some Gauls, the tallest he could  find, of triumphal size, as he said, put them in German clothes, made  them learn some Teutonic words, and sent them away to Rome to await in  prison his return and his ovation.  Lyons, where he staid some time, was  the scene of his extortions and strangest freaks.  He was playing at dice  one day with some of his courtiers, and lost; he rose, sent for the  tax-list of the province, marked down for death and confiscation some of  those who were most highly rated, and said to the company, \"You people,  you play for a few drachmas; but as for me, I have just won by a single  throw one hundred and fifty millions.\"  At the rumor of a plot hatched  against him in Italy, by some Roman nobles, he sent for and sold,  publicly, their furniture, jewels, and slaves.  As the sale was a  success, he extended it to the old furniture of his own palaces in Italy:  \"I wish to fit out the Gauls,\" said he; \"it is a mark of friendship I owe  to the brave performed the part Roman people.\"  He himself, at these  sales, performed the part of salesman and auctioneer, telling the history  of each article to enhance the price.  \"This belonged to my father,"]]]
