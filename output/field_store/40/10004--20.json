There was no one else in the room, but she heard a sweet voice sing  these words close to her ear:--      \"Now hark, little May,      If you want to do right,    Under your pillow      Just look every night.    If you have been good      All through the day,    A gift you will find,      Useful or gay;    But if you have been      Cross, selfish, or wild,    A bad thing will come      For the naughty child.    So try, little dear,      And soon you will see    How easy and sweet      To grow good it will be.\"    May was very much surprised at this, and looked everywhere to see who  spoke, but could find no one.    \"I guess I dreamed it; but my eyes are wide open, and I can't make up  poetry, asleep or awake.\"    As she said that, some one laughed; and the same voice sang again,--      \"Ha, ha, you can't see,      Although I am here;    But listen to what      I say in your ear.    Tell no one of this.      Because, if you do,    My fun will be spoilt,      And so will yours too.    But if you are good,      And patient, and gay,    A real fairy will come      To see little May.\"    \"Oh, how splendid that will be! I'll try hard, and be as good as an  angel if I can only get one peep at a live fairy. I always said there  were such people, and now I shall know how they look,\" cried the little  girl, so pleased that she danced all about the room, clapping her hands.    Something bright darted out of the window from among the flowers that  stood there, and no more songs were heard; so May knew that the elf had  gone.    \"I've got a fine secret all to myself, and I'll keep it carefully. I  wonder what present will come to-night,\" she said, thinking this a very  interesting play.    She was very good all day, and made no fuss about going to bed, though  usually she fretted, and wanted to play, and called for water, and  plagued poor Nursey in many ways. She got safely into her little nest,  and then was in such a hurry to see what was under her pillow that she  forgot, and called out crossly,--    \"Do hurry and go away. Don't wait to hang up my clothes, you slow old  thing! Go, go!\"    That hurt Nurse's feelings, and she went away without her good-night  kiss. But May didn't care, and felt under her pillow the minute the door  was shut. A lamp was always left burning; so she could see the little  gold box she drew out.    \"How pretty! I hope there is some candy in it,\" she said, opening it  very carefully.    Oh, dear! what _do_ you think happened? A wasp flew out and stung her  lips; then both wasp and box vanished, and May was left to cry alone,  with a sharp pain in the lips that said the unkind words.    \"What a dreadful present! I don't like that spiteful fairy who sends  such horrid things,\" she sobbed.    Then she lay still and thought about it; for she dared not call any one,  because nobody must guess the secret. She knew in her own little heart  that the cross words hurt Nursey as the sting did her lips, and she felt  sorry. At once the smart got better, and by the time she had resolved to  ask the good old woman to forgive her, it was all gone.    Next morning she kissed Nursey and begged pardon, and tried hard to be  good till tea-time; then she ran to see what nice things they were  going to have to eat, though she had often been told not to go into  the dining-room. No one was there; and on the table stood a dish of  delicious little cakes, all white like snowballs.    \"I must have just a taste, and I'll tell mamma afterward,\" she said; and  before she knew it one little cake was eaten all up.    \"Nobody will miss it, and I can have another at tea. Now, a lump of  sugar and a sip of cream before mamma comes, I so like to pick round.\"    Having done one wrong thing, May felt like going on; so she nibbled and  meddled with all sorts of forbidden things till she heard a step, then  she ran away; and by and by, when the bell rang, came in with the rest  as prim and proper as if she did not know how to play pranks. No one  missed the cake, and her mother gave her another, saying,--    \"There, dear, is a nice plummy one for my good child.\"    May turned red, and wanted to tell what she had done, but was ashamed  because there was company; and people thought she blushed like a modest  little girl at being praised.    But when she went to bed she was almost afraid to look under the pillow,  knowing that she had done wrong. At last she slowly drew out the box,  and slowly opened it, expecting something to fly at her. All she saw  was a tiny black bag, that began at once to grow larger, till it was  big enough to hold her two hands. Then it tied itself tight round her  wrists, as if to keep these meddlesome hands out of mischief.    \"Well, this is very queer, but not so dreadful as the wasp. I hope  no one will see it when I'm asleep. I do wish I'd let those cakes and  things alone,\" sighed May, looking at the black bag, and vainly trying  to get her hands free.    She cried herself to sleep, and when she woke the bag was gone. No one  had seen it; but she told her mamma about the cake, and promised not to  do so any more.    \"Now this shall be a _truly_ good day, every bit of it,\" she said, as  she skipped away, feeling as light as a feather after she had confessed  her little sins.    But, alas! it is so easy to forget and do wrong, that May spoilt her day  before dinner by going to the river and playing with the boats, in spite  of many orders not to do it. She did not tell of it, and went to a  party in the afternoon, where she was so merry she never remembered the  naughty thing till she was in bed and opened the fairy box. A little  chain appeared, which in a flash grew long and large, and fastened round  her ankles as if she were a prisoner. May liked to tumble about, and was  much disgusted to be chained in this way; but there was no help for it,  so she lay very still and had plenty of time to be sorry.    \"It is a good punishment for me, and I deserve it. I won't cry, but I  will--I _will_ remember.\" And May said her prayers very soberly, really  meaning to keep her word this time.    All the next day she was very careful to keep her lips from cross words,  her hands from forbidden things, and her feet from going wrong. Nothing  spoilt this day, she watched so well; and when mamma gave the good-night  kiss, she said,--    \"What shall I give my good little daughter, who has been gentle,  obedient, and busy all day?\"    \"I want a white kitty, with blue eyes, and a pink ribbon on its neck,\"  answered May.    \"I'll try and find one. Now go to bed, deary, and happy dreams!\" said  mamma, with many kisses on the rosy cheeks, and the smile that was a  reward.    May was so busy thinking about the kitty and the good day that she  forgot the box till she heard a little \"Mew, mew!\" under her pillow.    \"Mercy me! what's that?\" And she popped up her head to see.    Out came the box; off flew the lid, and there, on a red cushion, lay a  white kit about two inches long. May couldn't believe that it was alive  till it jumped out of its nest, stretched itself, and grew all at once  just the right size to play with and be pretty. Its eyes were blue, its  tail like a white plume, and a sweet pink bow was on its neck. It danced  all over the bed, ran up the curtains, hid under the clothes, nipped  May's toes, licked her face, patted her nose with its soft paw, and  winked at her in such a funny way that she laughed for joy at having  such a dear kitty. Presently, as if it knew that bed was the place to  lie quiet in, puss cuddled down in a little bunch and purred May to  sleep.    \"I suppose that darling kit will be gone like all the other things,\"  said May, as she waked up and looked round for her first pretty gift.    No; there was the lovely thing sitting in the sun among the flower-pots,  washing her face and getting ready for play. What a fine frolic they  had; and how surprised every one was to see just the pussy May wanted!  They supposed it came as kitties often come; and May never told them it  was a fairy present, because she had promised not to. She was so happy  with little puss that she was good all day; and when she went to bed she  thought,--    \"I wish I had a dog to play with darling Snowdrop, and run with me when  I go to walk.\"    \"Bow, wow, wow!\" came from under the pillow; and out of the box trotted  a curly black dog, with long ears, a silver collar, and such bright,  kind eyes May was not a bit afraid of him, but loved him at once, and  named him Floss, he was so soft and silky. Pussy liked him too; and when  May was sleepy they both snuggled down in the same basket like two good  babies, and went to by-low.    \"Well, I never! What shall we find next?\" said Nurse, when she saw the  dog in the morning.    \"Perhaps it will be an elephant, to fill the whole house, and scare you  out of your wits,\" laughed May, dancing about with Snowdrop chasing her  bare toes, while Floss shook and growled over her shoes as if they were  rats.    \"If your cousin John wants to give you any more animals, I wish he'd  send a pony to take you to school, and save my old legs the pain of  trotting after you,\" said Nurse; for May did have a rich cousin who was  very fond of her, and often gave her nice things.    \"Perhaps he will,\" laughed May, much tickled with the idea that it was  a fairy, and not Cousin John, who sent the cunning little creatures to  her.    But she didn't get the pony that night; for in the afternoon her mother  told her not to sit on the lawn, because it was damp, and May did not  mind, being busy with a nice story. So when she took up her box, a loud  sneeze seemed to blow the lid off, and all she saw was a bit of red  flannel.    \"What is this for?\" she asked, much disappointed; and as if to answer,  the strip"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7439"],[0,"English Fairy Tales (#16)"],[1,"  Burd Ellen,\" said the Warlock Merlin, \"must have been carried off by the  fairies, because she went round the church 'wider shins'--the opposite  way to the sun. She is now in the Dark Tower of the King of Elfland; it  would take the boldest knight in Christendom to bring her back.\"    \"If it is possible to bring her back,\" said her brother, \"I'll do it, or  perish in the attempt.\"    \"Possible it is,\" said the Warlock Merlin, \"but woe to the man or  mother's son that attempts it, if he is not well taught beforehand what  he is to do.\"    The eldest brother of Burd Ellen was not to be put off, by any fear of  danger, from attempting to get her back, so he begged the Warlock Merlin  to tell him what he should do, and what he should not do, in going to  seek his sister. And after he had been taught, and had repeated his  lesson, he set out for Elfland.      But long they waited, and longer still,      With doubt and muckle pain,    But woe were the hearts of his brethren,      For he came not back again.    Then the second brother got tired and sick of waiting, and he went to  the Warlock Merlin and asked him the same as his brother. So he set out  to find Burd Ellen.      But long they waited, and longer still,      With muckle doubt and pain,    And woe were his mother's and brother's heart,      For he came not back again.    And when they had waited and waited a good long time, Childe Rowland,  the youngest of Burd Ellen's brothers, wished to go, and went to his  mother, the good queen, to ask her to let him go. But she would not at  first, for he was the last of her children she now had, and if he was  lost, all would be lost. But he begged, and he begged, till at last the  good queen let him go, and gave him his father's good brand that never  struck in vain. And as she girt it round his waist, she said the spell  that would give it victory.    So Childe Rowland said good-bye to the good queen, his mother, and went  to the cave of the Warlock Merlin. \"Once more, and but once more,\" he  said to the Warlock, \"tell how man or mother's son may rescue Burd Ellen  and her brothers twain.\"    \"Well, my son,\" said the Warlock Merlin, \"there are but two things,  simple they may seem, but hard they are to do. One thing to do, and one  thing not to do. And the thing to do is this: after you have entered the  land of Fairy, whoever speaks to you, till you meet the Burd Ellen,  you must out with your father's brand and off with their head. And what  you've not to do is this: bite no bit, and drink no drop, however hungry  or thirsty you be; drink a drop, or bite a bit, while in Elfland you be  and never will you see Middle Earth again.\"    So Childe Rowland said the two things over and over again, till he knew  them by heart, and he thanked the Warlock Merlin and went on his way.  And he went along, and along, and along, and still further along, till  he came to the horse-herd of the King of Elfland feeding his horses.  These he knew by their fiery eyes, and knew that he was at last in  the land of Fairy. \"Canst thou tell me,\" said Childe Rowland to the  horse-herd, \"where the King of Elfland's Dark Tower is?\" \"I cannot tell  thee,\" said the horse-herd, \"but go on a little further and thou wilt  come to the cow-herd, and he, maybe, can tell thee.\"    Then, without a word more, Childe Rowland drew the good brand that never  struck in vain, and off went the horse-herd's head, and Childe Rowland  went on further, till he came to the cow-herd, and asked him the same  question. \"I can't tell thee,\" said he, \"but go on a little farther, and  thou wilt come to the hen-wife, and she is sure to know.\" Then Childe  Rowland out with his good brand, that never struck in vain, and off went  the cow-herd's head. And he went on a little further, till he came to an  old woman in a grey cloak, and he asked her if she knew where the Dark  Tower of the King of Elfland was. \"Go on a little further,\" said  the hen-wife, \"till you come to a round green hill, surrounded with  terrace-rings, from the bottom to the top; go round it three times,  widershins, and each time say:      Open, door! open, door!    And let me come in.    and the third time the door will open, and you may go in.\" And Childe  Rowland was just going on, when he remembered what he had to do; so he  out with the good brand, that never struck in vain, and off went the  hen-wife's head.    Then he went on, and on, and on, till he came to the round green hill  with the terrace-rings from top to bottom, and he went round it three  times, widershins, saying each time:      Open, door! open, door!    And let me come in.    And the third time the door did open, and he went in, and it closed with  a click, and Childe Rowland was left in the dark.    It was not exactly dark, but a kind of twilight or gloaming. There  were neither windows nor candles, and he could not make out where the  twilight came from, if not through the walls and roof. These were rough  arches made of a transparent rock, incrusted with sheepsilver and rock  spar, and other bright stones. But though it was rock, the air was quite  warm, as it always is in Elfland. So he went through this passage till  at last he came to two wide and high folding-doors which stood ajar. And  when he opened them, there he saw a most wonderful and glorious sight.  A large and spacious hall, so large that it seemed to be as long, and as  broad, as the green hill itself. The roof was supported by fine pillars,  so large and lofty, that the pillars of a cathedral were as nothing to  them. They were all of gold and silver, with fretted work, and between  them and around them, wreaths of flowers, composed of what do you think?  Why, of diamonds and emeralds, and all manner of precious stones. And  the very key-stones of the arches had for ornaments clusters of diamonds  and rubies, and pearls, and other precious stones. And all these arches  met in the middle of the roof, and just there, hung by a gold chain,  an immense lamp made out of one big pearl hollowed out and quite  transparent. And in the middle of this was a big, huge carbuncle, which  kept spinning round and round, and this was what gave light by its rays  to the whole hall, which seemed as if the setting sun was shining on it.    The hall was furnished in a manner equally grand, and at one end of  it was a glorious couch of velvet, silk and gold, and there sate Burd  Ellen, combing her golden hair with a silver comb. And when she saw  Childe Rowland she stood up and said:      \"God pity ye, poor luckless fool,    What have ye here to do?      \"Hear ye this, my youngest brother,    Why didn't ye bide at home?    Had you a hundred thousand lives    Ye couldn't spare any a one.      \"But sit ye down; but woe, O, woe,    That ever ye were born,    For come the King of Elfland in,    Your fortune is forlorn.\"    Then they sate down together, and Childe Rowland told her all that he  had done, and she told him how their two brothers had reached the Dark  Tower, but had been enchanted by the King of Elfland, and lay there  entombed as if dead. And then after they had talked a little longer  Childe Rowland began to feel hungry from his long travels, and told his  sister Burd Ellen how hungry he was and asked for some food, forgetting  all about the Warlock Merlin's warning.    Burd Ellen looked at Childe Rowland sadly, and shook her head, but she  was under a spell, and could not warn him. So she rose up, and went  out, and soon brought back a golden basin full of bread and milk. Childe  Rowland was just going to raise it to his lips, when he looked at his  sister and remembered why he had come all that way. So he dashed the  bowl to the ground, and said: \"Not a sup will I swallow, nor a bit will  I bite, till Burd Ellen is set free.\"    Just at that moment they heard the noise of some one approaching, and a  loud voice was heard saying:      \"Fee, fi, fo, fum,    I smell the blood of a Christian man,    Be he dead, be he living, with my brand,    I'll dash his brains from his brain-pan.\"    And then the folding-doors of the hall were burst open, and the King of  Elfland rushed in.    \"Strike then, Bogle, if thou darest,\" shouted out Childe Rowland, and  rushed to meet him with his good brand that never yet did fail. They  fought, and they fought, and they fought, till Childe Rowland beat the  King of Elfland down on to his knees, and caused him to yield and beg  for mercy. \"I grant thee mercy,\" said Childe Rowland, \"release my sister  from thy spells and raise my brothers to life, and let us all go free,  and thou shalt be spared.\" \"I agree,\" said the Elfin King, and rising  up he went to a chest from which he took a phial filled with a blood-red  liquor. With this he anointed the ears, eyelids, nostrils, lips, and  finger-tips, of the two brothers, and they sprang at once into life, and  declared that their souls had been away, but had now returned. The Elfin  king then said some words to Burd Ellen, and she was disenchanted, and  they all four passed out of the hall, through the long passage, and  turned their back on the Dark Tower, never to return again. And they  reached home, and the good queen, their mother, and Burd Ellen never  went round a church widershins again.          MOLLY WHUPPIE    Once upon a time there was a man and a wife had too many children, and  they could not get meat for them, so they took the three youngest and  left them in a wood. They travelled and travelled and could see never  a house. It began to be dark, and they were hungry. At last they saw a  light and made for it; it turned out to be a house. They knocked at the  door, and a woman came to it, who said: \"What do you want?\" They said:  \"Please let us in and give us something to eat.\" The woman said: \"I  can't do that, as my man is a giant, and he would kill you if he comes  home.\" They begged hard. \"Let us stop for a little while,\" said they,  \"and we will go away before he comes.\" So she"]]]
