We must, then, on our road again, and I hope from my  heart that you may train these two young goshawks here until they are  ready for a cast even at such a quarry as you speak of.\"    Leaving the thumbless archer and his brood, the wayfarers struck through  the scattered huts of Emery Down, and out on to the broad rolling heath  covered deep in ferns and in heather, where droves of the half-wild  black forest pigs were rooting about amongst the hillocks. The woods  about this point fall away to the left and the right, while the road  curves upwards and the wind sweeps keenly over the swelling uplands. The  broad strips of bracken glowed red and yellow against the black peaty  soil, and a queenly doe who grazed among them turned her white front  and her great questioning eyes towards the wayfarers. Alleyne gazed  in admiration at the supple beauty of the creature; but the archer's  fingers played with his quiver, and his eyes glistened with the fell  instinct which urges a man to slaughter.    \"Tete Dieu!\" he growled, \"were this France, or even Guienne, we should  have a fresh haunch for our none-meat. Law or no law, I have a mind to  loose a bolt at her.\"    \"I would break your stave across my knee first,\" cried John, laying his  great hand upon the bow. \"What! man, I am forest-born, and I know what  comes of it. In our own township of Hordle two have lost their eyes and  one his skin for this very thing. On my troth, I felt no great love when  I first saw you, but since then I have conceived over much regard for  you to wish to see the verderer's flayer at work upon you.\"    \"It is my trade to risk my skin,\" growled the archer; but none the less  he thrust his quiver over his hip again and turned his face for the  west.    As they advanced, the path still tended upwards, running from heath into  copses of holly and yew, and so back into heath again. It was joyful to  hear the merry whistle of blackbirds as they darted from one clump  of greenery to the other. Now and again a peaty amber colored stream  rippled across their way, with ferny over-grown banks, where the blue  kingfisher flitted busily from side to side, or the gray and pensive  heron, swollen with trout and dignity, stood ankle-deep among the  sedges. Chattering jays and loud wood-pigeons flapped thickly overhead,  while ever and anon the measured tapping of Nature's carpenter, the  great green woodpecker, sounded from each wayside grove. On either side,  as the path mounted, the long sweep of country broadened and expanded,  sloping down on the one side through yellow forest and brown moor to  the distant smoke of Lymington and the blue misty channel which lay  alongside the sky-line, while to the north the woods rolled away, grove  topping grove, to where in the furthest distance the white spire of  Salisbury stood out hard and clear against the cloudless sky. To Alleyne  whose days had been spent in the low-lying coastland, the eager upland  air and the wide free country-side gave a sense of life and of the joy  of living which made his young blood tingle in his veins. Even the  heavy John was not unmoved by the beauty of their road, while the bowman  whistled lustily or sang snatches of French love songs in a voice which  might have scared the most stout-hearted maiden that ever hearkened to  serenade.    \"I have a liking for that north countryman,\" he remarked presently. \"He  hath good power of hatred. Couldst see by his cheek and eye that he is  as bitter as verjuice. I warm to a man who hath some gall in his liver.\"    \"Ah me!\" sighed Alleyne. \"Would it not be better if he had some love in  his heart?\"    \"I would not say nay to that. By my hilt! I shall never be said to be  traitor to the little king. Let a man love the sex. Pasques Dieu! they  are made to be loved, les petites, from whimple down to shoe-string! I  am right glad, mon garcon, to see that the good monks have trained thee  so wisely and so well.\"    \"Nay, I meant not worldly love, but rather that his heart should soften  towards those who have wronged him.\"    The archer shook his head. \"A man should love those of his own breed,\"  said he. \"But it is not nature that an English-born man should love  a Scot or a Frenchman. Ma foi! you have not seen a drove of Nithsdale  raiders on their Galloway nags, or you would not speak of loving them. I  would as soon take Beelzebub himself to my arms. I fear, mon gar., that  they have taught thee but badly at Beaulieu, for surely a bishop knows  more of what is right and what is ill than an abbot can do, and I myself  with these very eyes saw the Bishop of Lincoln hew into a Scottish  hobeler with a battle-axe, which was a passing strange way of showing  him that he loved him.\"    Alleyne scarce saw his way to argue in the face of so decided an opinion  on the part of a high dignitary of the Church. \"You have borne arms  against the Scots, then?\" he asked.    \"Why, man, I first loosed string in battle when I was but a lad, younger  by two years than you, at Neville's Cross, under the Lord Mowbray.  Later, I served under the Warden of Berwick, that very John Copeland of  whom our friend spake, the same who held the King of Scots to ransom. Ma  foi! it is rough soldiering, and a good school for one who would learn  to be hardy and war-wise.\"    \"I have heard that the Scots are good men of war,\" said Hordle John.    \"For axemen and for spearmen I have not seen their match,\" the archer  answered. \"They can travel, too, with bag of meal and gridiron slung  to their sword-belt, so that it is ill to follow them. There are scant  crops and few beeves in the borderland, where a man must reap his grain  with sickle in one fist and brown bill in the other. On the other hand,  they are the sorriest archers that I have ever seen, and cannot so much  as aim with the arbalest, to say nought of the long-bow. Again, they are  mostly poor folk, even the nobles among them, so that there are few who  can buy as good a brigandine of chain-mail as that which I am wearing,  and it is ill for them to stand up against our own knights, who carry  the price of five Scotch farms upon their chest and shoulders. Man for  man, with equal weapons, they are as worthy and valiant men as could be  found in the whole of Christendom.\"    \"And the French?\" asked Alleyne, to whom the archer's light gossip had  all the relish that the words of the man of action have for the recluse.    \"The French are also very worthy men. We have had great good fortune in  France, and it hath led to much bobance and camp-fire talk, but I have  ever noticed that those who know the most have the least to say about  it. I have seen Frenchmen fight both in open field, in the intaking and  the defending of towns or castlewicks, in escalados, camisades, night  forays, bushments, sallies, outfalls, and knightly spear-runnings. Their  knights and squires, lad, are every whit as good as ours, and I could  pick out a score of those who ride behind Du Guesclin who would hold the  lists with sharpened lances against the best men in the army of England.  On the other hand, their common folk are so crushed down with gabelle,  and poll-tax, and every manner of cursed tallage, that the spirit has  passed right out of them. It is a fool's plan to teach a man to be a  cur in peace, and think that he will be a lion in war. Fleece them like  sheep and sheep they will remain. If the nobles had not conquered  the poor folk it is like enough that we should not have conquered the  nobles.\"    \"But they must be sorry folk to bow down to the rich in such a fashion,\"  said big John. \"I am but a poor commoner of England myself, and yet I  know something of charters, liberties, franchises, usages, privileges,  customs, and the like. If these be broken, then all men know that it is  time to buy arrow-heads.\"    \"Aye, but the men of the law are strong in France as well as the men  of war. By my hilt! I hold that a man has more to fear there from the  ink-pot of the one than from the iron of the other. There is ever some  cursed sheepskin in their strong boxes to prove that the rich man should  be richer and the poor man poorer. It would scarce pass in England, but  they are quiet folk over the water.\"    \"And what other nations have you seen in your travels, good sir?\" asked  Alleyne Edricson. His young mind hungered for plain facts of life, after  the long course of speculation and of mysticism on which he had been  trained.    \"I have seen the low countryman in arms, and I have nought to say  against him. Heavy and slow is he by nature, and is not to be brought  into battle for the sake of a lady's eyelash or the twang of a  minstrel's string, like the hotter blood of the south. But ma foi! lay  hand on his wool-bales, or trifle with his velvet of Bruges, and out  buzzes every stout burgher, like bees from the tee-hole, ready to lay on  as though it were his one business in life. By our lady! they have shown  the French at Courtrai and elsewhere that they are as deft in wielding  steel as in welding it.\"    \"And the men of Spain?\"    \"They too are very hardy soldiers, the more so as for many hundred years  they have had to fight hard against the cursed followers of the black  Mahound, who have pressed upon them from the south, and still, as I  understand, hold the fairer half of the country. I had a turn with them  upon the sea when they came over to Winchelsea and the good queen with  her ladies sat upon the cliffs looking down at us, as if it had been  joust or tourney. By my hilt! it was a sight that was worth the seeing,  for all that was best in England was out on the water that day. We went  forth in little ships and came back in great galleys--for of fifty tall  ships of Spain, over two score flew the Cross of St. George ere the sun  had set. But now, youngster, I have answered you freely, and I trow it  is time that you answered me. Let things be plat and plain"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9069"],[0,"Saint Augustin (#16)"],[1,"e, the comradeship, now grave now gay, the differences that left  no sting, as of a man differing with himself, the spice of disagreement  which seasoned the monotony of consent. Each by turns would instruct or  listen; impatiently we missed the absent friend, and savoured the joy of  his return. We loved each other with all our hearts, and such tokens of  friendship springing from the heart and displayed by a word, a glance, an  expression, by a thousand pretty complaisances, supply the heat which welds  souls together, and of many make one.\"    It is easily understood that such ties as these had given Augustin a  permanent disgust for his rowdy comrades of a former time: he went no more  with \"The Wreckers.\" The small circle he took pleasure in was quiet and  cheerful. Its merriment was controlled by the African gravity. He and his  friends come before my eyes, a little like those students of theology, or  those cultivated young Arabs, who discuss poetry, lolling indolently upon  the cushions of a divan, while they roll between their fingers the amber  beads of their rosary, or walking slowly under the arcades of a mosque,  draped in their white-silk simars, with a serious and meditative air,  gestures elegant and measured, courteous and harmonious speech, and  something discreet, polite, and already clerical in their tone and manners.    In fact, the life which Augustin was at that time relishing was the pagan  life on its best and gentlest side. The subtle network of habits and daily  occupations enveloped him little by little. There was some risk of his  growing torpid in this soft kind of life, when suddenly a rude shock roused  him.... It was a chance, but in his eyes a providential chance, which put  the _Hortensius_ of Cicero between his hands. Augustin was about nineteen,  still a student; according to the order which prevailed in the schools,  the time had come for him to read and explain this philosophical dialogue.  He had no curiosity about the book. He took it from his sense of duty as  a student, because it figured on the schedule. He unrolled the book, and  began it, doubtless with calm indifference. All of a sudden, a great  unexpected light shone between the lines. His heart throbbed. His whole  soul sprang towards these phrases, so dazzling and revealing. He awoke  from his long drowsiness. Before him shone a marvellous vision.... As this  dialogue is lost, we can hardly to-day account for such enthusiasm, and  we hold that the Roman orator was a very middling philosopher. We know,  however, through Augustin himself, that the book contained an eloquent  praise of wisdom. And then, words are naught without the soul of the  reader; all this, falling into Augustin's soul, rendered a prolonged and  magnificent sound. It is evident, too, that just at the moment when he  unrolled the book he was in a condition to receive this uplifting summons.  In such minutes, when the heart, ignorant of itself, swells like the sea  before a storm, when all the inner riches of the being overflow, the  slightest glimmer is enough to reveal all these imprisoned forces, and the  least shock to set them free.    He has at least preserved for us, in pious and faithful gratitude, some  phrases of this dialogue which moved him so deeply. Especially does he  admire this passage, wherein the author, after a long discussion, ends in  these terms: \"If, as pretend the philosophers of old time, who are also  the greatest and most illustrious, we have a soul immortal and divine, it  behoves us to think, that the more it has persevered in its way, that is to  say, in reason, love, and the pursuit of truth, and the less it has been  intermingled and stained in human error and passion, the easier will it be  for it to raise itself and soar again to the skies.\"    Such phrases, read in a certain state of mind, might well overwhelm this  young man, who was ere long to yearn for the cloister and was destined to  be the founder of African monasticism. To give his whole life to the study  of wisdom, to compel himself towards the contemplation of God, to live  here below an almost divine life--this ideal, impossible to pagan wisdom,  Augustin was called to realize in the name of Christ. That had dawned on  him, all at once, while he was reading the _Hortensius_. And this ideal  appeared to him so beautiful, so well worth the sacrifice of all he had  hitherto loved, that nothing else counted for him any more. He despised  rhetoric, the vain studies it compelled him to pursue, the honour and glory  it promised him. What was all that to the prize of wisdom? For wisdom he  felt himself ready to give up the world.... But these heroic outbursts  do not, as a rule, keep up very long in natures so changeable and  impressionable as Augustin's. Yet they are not entirely thrown away.  Thus, in early youth, come dim revelations of the future. There comes a  presentiment of the port to which one will some day be sailing; a glimpse  of the task to fulfil, the work to build up; and all this rises before the  eyes in an entrancement of the whole being. Though the bright image be  eclipsed, perhaps for years, the remembrance of it persists amid the worst  degradations or the worst mediocrities. He who one single time has seen it  pass, can never afterwards live quite like other people.    This fever calmed, Augustin set himself to reflect. The ancient  philosophers promised him wisdom. But Christ also promised it! Was it not  possible to reconcile them? And was not the Gospel ideal essentially more  human than that of the pagan philosophers? Suppose he tried to submit to  that, to bring the faith of his childhood into line with his ambitions as a  young man of intellect? To be good after the manner of his mother, of his  grandparents, of the good Thagaste servants, of all the humble Christian  souls whose virtues he had been taught to respect, and at the same time to  rival a Plato by the strength of thought--what a dream! Was it possible?...  He tells us himself that the illusion was brief, and that he grew cool  about the _Hortensius_ because he did not find the name of Christ in it. He  deceives himself, probably. At this time he was not so Christian. He yields  to the temptation of a fine phrase: when he wrote his _Confessions_ he had  not yet entirely lost this habit.    But what remains true is, that feeling the inadequateness of pagan  philosophy, he returned for a moment towards Christianity. The Ciceronian  dialogue, by disappointing his thirst for the truth, gave him the idea of  knocking at the door of the Church and trying to find out if on that side  there might not be a practicable road for him. This is why the reading  of _Hortensius_ is in Augustin's eyes one of the great dates of his life.  Although he fell back in his errors, he takes credit for his effort.  He recognizes in it the first sign, and, as it were, a promise of his  conversion. \"Thenceforth, my God, began my upward way, and my return  towards Thee.\"    He began then to study the Holy Scriptures with a more or less serious  intention to instruct himself in them. But to go to the Bible by way of  Cicero was to take the worst road. Augustin got lost there. This direct  popular style, which only cares about saying things, and not about how they  are said, could only repel the pupil of Carthage rhetoricians, the imitator  of the harmonious Ciceronian sentences. Not only had he much too spoiled  a taste in literature, but there was also too much literature in this  pose of a young man who starts off one fine morning to conquer wisdom. He  was punished for his lack of sincerity, and especially of humility. He  understood nothing of the Scripture, and \"I found it,\" he says, \"a thing  not known to the proud, nor yet laid open to children, but poor in  appearance, lofty in operation, and veiled in mysteries. At that time, I  was not the man to bow my head so as to pass in at its door.\"...    He grew tired very quickly. He turned his back on the Bible, as he  had thrown aside _Hortensius_, and he went to find pasture elsewhere.  Nevertheless, his mind had been set in motion. Nevermore was he to know  repose, till he had found truth. He demanded this truth from all the sects  and all the churches. So it was, that in despair he flung himself into  Manicheeism.    Some have professed amazement that this honest and practical mind should  have stuck fast in a doctrine so tortuous, so equivocal, contaminated by  fancies so grossly absurd. But perhaps it is forgotten that there was  everything in Manicheeism. The leaders of the sect did not deliver the bulk  of the doctrine all at once to their catechumens; the entire initiation was  a matter of several degrees. Now Augustin never went higher than a simple  _auditor_ in the Manichean Church. What attracted specially fine minds to  the Manichees, was that they began by declaring themselves rationalists.  To reconcile faith with natural science and philosophy has been the fad  of heresiarchs and free-thinkers in all ages. The Manicheans bragged that  they had succeeded. They went everywhere, crying out: \"Truth, Truth!\" That  suited Augustin very well: it was just what he was looking for. He hastened  to the preachings of these humbugs, impatient to receive at last this  \"truth,\" so noisily announced. From what they said, it was contained in  several large books written by their prophet under the guidance of the Holy  Ghost. There was quite a library of them. By way of bamboozling the crowd,  they produced some of them which looked very important, ponderous as  Tables of the Law, richly bound in vellum, and embellished with striking  illuminations. How was it possible to doubt that the entire revelation was  contained in such beautiful books? One felt at once full of respect for a  religion which was able to produce in its favour the testimony of such a  mass of writings.    However, the priests did not open them.
