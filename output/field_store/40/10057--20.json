Many are extinct and many perhaps made but once and only hint  things we can not apprehend. Later the rehearsals are fuller, and  their significance more intelligible, and in boyhood and youth the  correspondences are plain to all who have eyes to see. Pleasure is  always exactly proportional to the directness and force of the current  of heredity, and in play we feel most fully and intensely ancestral  joys. The pain of toil died with our forebears; its vestiges in our  play give pure delight. Its variety prompts to diversity that enlarges  our life. Primitive men and animals played, and that too has left its  traces in us. Some urge that work was evolved or degenerated from  play; but the play field broadens with succeeding generations youth is  prolonged, for play is always and everywhere the best synonym of  youth. All are young at play and only in play, and the best possible  characterization of old age is the absence of the soul and body of  play. Only senile and overspecialized tissues of brain, heart, and  muscles know it not.    Gulick[1] has urged that what makes certain exercises more interesting  than others is to be found in the phylon. The power to throw with  accuracy and speed was once pivotal for survival, and non-throwers  were eliminated. Those who could throw unusually well best overcame  enemies, killed game, and sheltered family. The nervous and muscular  systems are organized with certain definite tendencies and have back  of them a racial setting. So running and dodging with speed and  endurance, and hitting with a club, were also basal to hunting and  fighting. Now that the need of these is leas urgent for utilitarian  purposes, they are still necessary for perfecting the organism. This  makes, for instance, baseball racially familiar, because it represents  activities that were once and for a long time necessary for survival.  We inherit tendencies of muscular coordination that have been of great  racial utility. The best athletic sports and games a composed of these  racially old elements, so that phylogenetic muscular history is of  great importance. Why is it, this writer asks, that a city man so  loves to sit all day and fish! It is because this interest dates back  to time immemorial. We are the sons of fishermen, and early life was  by the water's side, and this is our food supply. This explains why  certain exercises are more interesting than others. It is because they  touch and revive the deep basic emotions of the race. Thus we see that  play is not doing things to be useful later, but it is rehearsing  racial history. Plays and games change only in their external form,  but the underlying neuro-muscular activities, and also the psychic  content of them, are the same. Just as psychic states must be lived  out up through the grades, so the physical activities most be played  off, each in its own time.    The best exercise for the young should thus be more directed to  develop the basal powers old to the race than those peculiar to the  individual, and it should enforce those psycho-neural and muscular  forms which race habit has banded down rather than insist upon those  arbitrarily designed to develop our ideas of symmetry regardless of  heredity. The best guide to the former is _interest_, zest, and  spontaneity. Hereditary moment, really determine, too, the order in  which nerve centers come into function. The oldest, racial parts come  first, and those which are higher and represent volition come in much  later.[2] As Hughlings Jackson has well shown, speech uses most of the  same organs as does eating, but those concerned with the former are  controlled from a higher level of nerve-cells. By right mastication,  deglutition, etc., we are thus developing speech organs. Thus not only  the kind but the time of forms and degrees of exercise is best  prescribed by heredity. All growth is more or less rhythmic. There are  seasons of rapid increment followed by rest and then perhaps succeeded  by a period of augmentation, and this may occur several times.  Roberts's fifth parliamentary report shows that systematic gymnastics,  which, if applied at the right age, produce such immediate and often  surprising development of lung capacity, utterly fail with boys of  twelve, because this nascent period has not yet come. Donaldson showed  that if the eyelid of a young kitten be forced open prematurely at  birth and stimulated with light, medullation was premature and  imperfect; so, too, if proper exercise is deferred too long, we know  that little result is achieved. The sequence in which the maturation  of levels, nerve areas, and bundles of fibers develop may be, as  Flechsig thinks, causal; or, according to Cajal, energy, originally  employed in growth by cell division, later passes to fiber extension  and the development of latent cells; or as in young children, the  nascent period of finger movements may stimulate that of the thumb  which comes later, and the independent movement of the two eyes, their  subsequent coordination, and so on to perhaps a third and yet higher  level. Thus exercise ought to develop nature's first intention and  fulfil the law of nascent periods, or else not only no good but great  harm may be done. Hence every determination of these periods is of  great practical as well as scientific importance. The following are  the chief attempts yet made to fix them, which show the significance  of adolescence.    The doll curve reaches its point of highest intensity between eight  and nine,[3] and it is nearly ended at fifteen, although it may  persist. Children can give no better reason why they stop playing with  dolls than because other things are liked better, or they are too old,  ashamed, love real babies, etc. The Roman girl, when ripe for  marriage, hung up her childhood doll as a votive offering to Venus.  Mrs. Carlyle, who was compelled to stop, made sumptuous dresses and a  four-post bed, and made her doll die upon a funeral pyre like Dido,  after speaking her last farewell and stabbing herself with a penknife  by way of Tyrian sword. At thirteen or fourteen it is more distinctly  realized that dolls are not real, because they have no inner life or  feeling, yet many continue to play with them with great pleasure, in  secret, till well on in the teens or twenties. Occasionally single  women or married women with no children, and in rare cases even those  who have children, play dolls all their lives. Gales's[4] student  concluded that the girls who played with dolls up to or into pubescent  years were usually those who had the fewest number, that they played  with them in the most realistic manner, kept them because actually  most fond of them, and were likely to be more scientific, steady, and  less sentimental than those who dropped them early. But the instinct  that \"dollifies\" new or most unfit things is gone, as also the subtle  points of contact between doll play and idolatry. Before puberty dolls  are more likely to be adults; after puberty they are almost always  children or babies. There is no longer a struggle between doubt and  reality in the doll cosmos, no more abandon to the doll illusion; but  where it lingers it is a more atavistic rudiment, and just as at the  height of the fever dolls are only in small part representatives of  future children, the saying that the first child is the last doll is  probably false. Nor are doll and child comparable to first and second  dentition, and it is doubtful if children who play with dolls as  children with too great abandonment are those who make the best  mothers later, or if it has any value as a preliminary practise of  motherhood. The number of motor activities that are both inspired and  unified by this form of play and that can always be given wholesome  direction is almost incredible, and has been too long neglected both  by psychologists and teachers. Few purer types of the rehearsal by the  individual of the history of the race can probably be found even  though we can not yet analyze the many elements involved and assign to  each its phyletic correlate.    In an interesting paper Dr. Gulick[5] divides play into three childish  periods, separated by the ages three and seven, and attempts to  characterize the plays of early adolescence from twelve to seventeen and  of later adolescence from seventeen to twenty-three. Of the first two  periods he says, children before seven rarely play games spontaneously,  but often do so under the stimulus of older persons. From seven to  twelve, games are almost exclusively individualistic and competitive,  but in early adolescence \"two elements predominate--first, the plays are  predominantly team games, in which the individual is more or less  sacrificed for the whole, in which there is obedience to a captain, in  which there is cooperation among a number for a given end, in which play  has a program and an end. The second characteristic of the period is  with reference to its plays, and there seems to be all of savage  out-of-door life--hunting, fishing, stealing, swimming, rowing, sailing,  fighting, hero-worship, adventure, love of animals, etc. This  characteristic obtains more with boys than with girls.\" \"The plays of  adolescence are socialistic, demanding the heathen virtues of courage,  endurance, self-control, bravery, loyalty, enthusiasm.\"    Croswell[6] found that among 2,000 children familiar with 700 kinds of  amusements, those involving physical exercises predominated over all  others, and that \"at every age after the eighth year they were  represented as almost two to one and in the sixteenth year rose among  boys as four to one.\" The age of the greatest number of different  amusements is from ten to eleven, nearly fifteen being mentioned, but  for the next eight or nine years there is a steady decline of number,  and progressive specialisation occurs.
