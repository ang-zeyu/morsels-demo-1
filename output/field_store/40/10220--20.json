However  important inversion may be as a psychological key to Whitman's  personality, it plays but a small part in Whitman's work, and for many who  care for that work a negligible part. (I may be allowed to refer to my own  essay on Whitman, in _The New Spirit_, written nearly thirty years ago.)    [96] I may add that Symonds (in his book on Whitman) accepted this letter  as a candid and final statement showing that Whitman was absolutely  hostile to sexual inversion, that he had not even taken its phenomena into  account, and that he had \"omitted to perceive that there are inevitable  points of contact between sexual inversion and his doctrine of  friendship.\" He recalls, however, Whitman's own lines at the end of  \"Calamus\" in the Camden edition of 1876:--        \"Here my last words, and the most baffling,      Here the frailest leaves of me, and yet my strongest-lasting,      Here I shade down and hide my thoughts--I do not expose them,      And yet they expose me more than all my other poems.\"    [97] Whitman's letters to Peter Doyle, an uncultured young tram-conductor  deeply loved by the poet, have been edited by Dr. Bucke, and published at  Boston: _Calamus: A Series of Letters_, 1897.    [98] Whitman acknowledged, however (as in the letter to Symonds already  referred to), that he had had six children; they appear to have been born  in the earlier part of his life when he lived in the South. (See a chapter  on Walt Whitman's children in Edward Carpenter's interesting book, _Days  with Walt Whitman_, 1906.) Yet his brother George Whitman said: \"I never  knew Walt to fall in love with young girls, or even to show them marked  attention.\" And Doyle, who knew him intimately during ten years of late  life, said: \"Women in that sense never came into his head.\" The early  heterosexual relationship seems to have been an exception in his life.  With regard to the number of children I am informed that, in the opinion  of a lady who knew Whitman in the South, there can be no reasonable doubt  as to the existence of one child, but that when enumerating six he  possibly included grandchildren.    [99] While the homosexual strain in Walt Whitman has been more or less  definitely admitted by various writers, the most vigorous attempts to  present the homosexual character of his personality and work are due to  Eduard Bertz in Germany, and to Dr. W.C. Rivers in England. Bertz has  issued three publications on Whitman: see especially his _Der  Yankee-Heiland_, 1906, and _Whitman-Mysterien_, 1907. The arguments of  Rivers are concisely stated in a pamphlet entitled _Walt Whitman's  Anomaly_ (London: George Allen, 1913). Both Bertz and Rivers emphasize the  feminine traits in Whitman. An interesting independent picture of Whitman,  at about the date of the letter to Symonds, accompanied by the author's  excellent original photographs, is furnished by Dr. John Johnston, _A  Visit to Walt Whitman_, 1898. It may be added that, probably, both the  extent and the significance of the feminine traits in Whitman have been  overestimated by some writers. Most artists and men of genius have some  feminine traits; they do not prove the existence of inversion, nor does  their absence disprove it. Dr. Clark Bell writes to me in reference to the  little book by Dr. Rivers: \"I knew Walt Whitman personally. To me Mr.  Whitman was one of the most robust and virile of men, extraordinarily so.  He was from my standpoint not feminine at all, but physically masculine  and robust. The difficulty is that a virile and strong man who is poetic  in temperament, ardent and tender, may have phases and moods of passion  and emotion which are apt to be misinterpreted.\" A somewhat similar view,  in opposition to Bertz and Rivers, has been vigorously set forth by  Bazalgette (who has written a very thorough study of Whitman in French),  especially in the _Mercure de France_ for 1st July, 1st Oct., and 15th  Nov., 1913.    [100] Lepelletier, in what may be regarded as the official biography of  Verlaine (_Paul Verlaine_, 1907) seeks to minimize or explain away the  homosexual aspect of the poet's life. So also Berrichon, Rimbaud's  brother-in-law, _Mercure de France_, 16 July, 1911 and 1 Feb., 1912. P.  Escoube, in a judicious essay (included in _Preferences_, 1913), presents  a more reasonable view of this aspect of Verlaine's temperament. Even  apart altogether from the evidence as to the poet's tendency to passionate  friendship, there can be no appeal from the poems themselves, which  clearly possess an absolute and unquestionable sincerity.    [101] Sir Richard Burton, who helped to popularize this view, regarded the  phenomenon as \"geographical and climatic, not racial,\" and held that  within what he called the Sotadic Zone \"the vice is popular and endemic,  held at the worst to be a mere peccadillo, while the races to the north  and south of the limits here defined practice it only sporadically, amid  the opprobrium of their fellows, who, as a rule, are physically incapable  of performing the operation, and look upon it with the liveliest disgust.\"  He adds: \"The only physical cause for the practice which suggests itself  to me, and that must be owned to be purely conjectural, is that within the  Sotadic Zone there is a blending of the masculine and feminine  temperaments, a crasis which elsewhere only occurs sporadically\" (_Arabian  Nights_, 1885, vol. x, pp. 205-254). The theory of the Sotadic Zone fails  to account for the custom among the Normans, Celts, Scythians, Bulgars,  and Tartars, and, moreover, in various of these regions different views  have prevailed at different periods. Burton was wholly unacquainted with  the psychological investigations into sexual inversion which had, indeed,  scarcely begun in his day.    [102] Spectator (_Anthropophyteia_, vol. vii, 1910), referring especially  to the neighborhood of Sorrento, states that the southern Italians regard  passive _pedicatio_ as disgraceful, but attach little or no shame to  active _pedicatio_. This indifference enables them to exploit the  homosexual foreigners who are specially attracted to southern Italy in the  development of a flourishing homosexual industry.    [103] It is true that in the solitude of great modern cities it is  possible for small homosexual coteries to form, in a certain sense, an  environment of their own, favorable to their abnormality; yet this fact  hardly modifies the general statement made in the text.    [104] See especially Hirschfeld, _Die Homosexualitaet_, chs. xxiv and xxv.    [105] Ulrichs, in his _Argonauticus_, in 1869, estimated the number as  only 25,000, but admitted that this was probably a decided underestimate.  Bloch (_Die Prostitution_, Bd. i, p. 792) has found reason to believe that  in Cologne in the fifteenth century the percentage was nearly as high as  Hirschfeld finds it today. A few years earlier Bloch had believed  (_Beitraege_, part i, p. 215, 1902) that Hirschfeld's estimate of 2 per  cent, was \"sheer nonsense.\"    [106] Hirschfeld mentions the case of two men, artists, one of them  married, who were intimate friends for a great many years before each  discovered that the other was an invert.    [107] See articles by Numa Praetorius and Fernan, maintaining that  homosexuality is at least as frequent in France (_Sexual-Probleme_, March  and December, 1909).    [108] Dr. Laupts, _L'Homosexualite_, 1910, pp. 413, 420.    [109] Naecke, _Zeitschrift fuer Sexualwissenschaft_, 1908, Heft 6.    [110] It is a fact significant of the French attitude toward homosexuality  that the psychologist, Dr. Saint-Paul, when writing a book on this  subject, though in a completely normal and correct manner, thought it  desirable to adopt a pseudonym.    [111] A well-informed series of papers dealing with English  homosexuality generally, and especially with London (L. Pavia, \"Die  maennliche Homosexualitaet in England,\" _Vierteljahrsberichte des  wissenschaftlich-humanitaeren Komitees_, 1909-1911) will be found  instructive even by those who are familiar with London. And see also  Hirschfeld, _Die Homosexualitaet_, ch. xxvi. Much information of historical  nature concerning homosexuality in England will be found in Eugen Duehren  (Iwan Bloch), _Das Geschlechtsleben in England_.    [112] This: is doubtless the reason why so many English inverts establish  themselves outside England. Paris, Florence, Nice, Naples, Cairo, and  other places, are said to swarm with homosexual Englishmen.          CHAPTER II.    THE STUDY OF SEXUAL INVERSION.    Westphal--Hoessli--Casper--Ulrichs--Krafft-Ebing--Moll--Fere--Kiernan--  Lydston--Raffalovich--Edward Carpenter--Hirschfeld.      Westphal, an eminent professor of psychiatry at Berlin, may be said to be  the first to put the study of sexual inversion on an assured scientific  basis. In 1870 he published, in the _Archiv fuer Psychiatrie_, of which he  was for many years editor, the detailed history of a young woman who, from  her earliest years, differed from other girls: she liked to dress as a  boy, only cared for boys' games, and as she grew up was sexually attracted  only to women, with whom she formed a series of tender relationships, in  which the friends obtained sexual gratification by mutual caresses; while  she blushed and was shy in the presence of women, more especially the girl  with whom she chanced to be in love, she was always absolutely indifferent  in the presence of men. Westphal--a pupil, it may be noted, of Griesinger,  who had already called attention to the high character sometimes shown by  subjects of this perversion--combined keen scientific insight with a rare  degree of personal sympathy for those who came under his care, and it was  this combination of qualities which enabled him to grasp the true nature  of a case such as this, which by most medical "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13612"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 3 (#17)"],[1,"incontinence of urine, as well as \"stammering\" of  the bladder, are all specially liable to begin or to cease at puberty. In  men and even infants, distention of the bladder favors tumescence by  producing venous congestion, though at the same time it acts as a physical  hindrance to sexual detumescence[49]; in women--probably not from pressure  alone, but from reflex nervous action--a full bladder increases both  sexual excitement and pleasure, and I have been informed by several women  that they have independently discovered this fact for themselves and  acted in accordance with it. Conversely, sexual excitement increases the  explosive force of the bladder, the desire to urinate is aroused, and in  women the sexual orgasm, when very acute and occurring with a full  bladder, is occasionally accompanied, alike in savage and civilized life,  by an involuntary and sometimes full and forcible expulsion of urine.[50]  The desire to urinate may possibly be, as has been said, the normal  accompaniment of sexual excitement in women (just as it is said to be in  mares; so that the Arabs judge that the mare is ready for the stallion  when she urinates immediately on hearing him neigh). The association may  even form the basis of sexual obsessions.[51] I have elsewhere shown that,  of all the influences which increase the expulsive force of the bladder,  sexual excitement is the most powerful.[52] It may also have a reverse  influence and inhibit contraction of the bladder, sometimes in association  with shyness, but also independently of shyness. There is also reason to  suppose that the nervous energy expended in an explosion of the tension  of the sexual organs may sometimes relieve the bladder; it is well  recognized that a full bladder is a factor in producing sexual emissions  during sleep, the explosive energy of the bladder being inhibited and  passing over into the sexual sphere. Conversely, it appears that explosion  of the bladder relieves sexual tension. An explosion of the nervous  centers connected with the contraction of the bladder will relieve nervous  tension generally; there are forms of epilepsy in which the act of  urination constitutes the climax, and Gowers, in dealing with minor  epilepsy, emphasizes the frequency of micturition, which \"may occur with  spasmodic energy when there is only the slightest general stiffness,\"  especially in women. He adds the significant remark that it \"sometimes  seems to relieve the cerebral tension,\"[53] and gives the case of a girl  in whom the aura consisted mainly of a desire to urinate; if she could  satisfy this the fit was arrested; if not she lost consciousness and a  severe fit followed.    If micturition may thus relieve nervous tension generally, it is not  surprising that it should relieve the tension of the centers with which it  is most intimately connected. Serieux records the case of a girl of 12,  possessed by an impulse to masturbation which she was unable to control,  although anxious to conquer it, who only found relief in the act of  urination; this soothed her and to some extent satisfied the sexual  excitement; when the impulse to masturbate was restrained the impulse to  urinate became imperative; she would rise four or five times in the night  for this purpose, and even urinate in bed or in her clothes to obtain the  desired sexual relief.[54] I am acquainted with a lady who had a similar,  but less intense, experience during childhood. Sometimes, especially in  children, the act of urination becomes an act of gratification at the  climax of sexual pleasure, the imitative symbol of detumescence. Thus  Schultze-Malkowsky describes a little girl of 7 who would bribe her girl  companions with little presents to play the part of horses on all fours  while she would ride on their necks with naked thighs in order to obtain  the pleasurable sensation of close contact. With one special friend she  would ride facing backward, and leaning forward to embrace her body  impulsively, and at the same time pressing the neck closely between her  thighs, would urinate.[55] Fere has recorded the interesting case of a man  who, having all his life after puberty been subject to monthly attacks of  sexual excitement, after the age of 45 completely lost the liability to  these manifestations, but found himself subject, in place of them, to  monthly attacks of frequent and copious urination, accompanied by sexual  day-dreams, but by no genital excitement.[56] Such a case admirably  illustrates the compensatory relation of sexual and vesical excitation.  This mutual interaction is easily comprehensible when we recall the very  close nervous connection which exists between the mechanisms of the sexual  organs and the bladder.    Nor are such relationships found to be confined to these two centers; in a  lesser degree the more remote explosive centers are also affected; all  motor influences may spread to related muscles; the convulsion of  laughter, for instance, seems to be often in relation with the sexual  center, and Groos has suggested that the laughter which, especially in the  sexually minded, often follows allusions to the genital sphere is merely  an effort to dispel nascent sexual excitement by liberating an explosion  of nervous energy in another direction.[57] Nervous discharges tend to  spread, or to act vicariously, because the motor centers are more or less  connected.[58] Of all the physiological motor explosions, the sexual  orgasm, or detumescence, is the most massive, powerful, and overwhelming.  So volcanic is it that to the ancient Greek philosophers it seemed to be a  minor kind of epilepsy. The relief of detumescence is not merely the  relief of an evacuation; it is the discharge, by the most powerful  apparatus for nervous explosion in the body, of the energy accumulated and  stored up in the slow process of tumescence, and that discharge  reverberates through all the nervous centers in the organism.        \"The sophist of Abdera said that coitus is a slight fit of      epilepsy, judging it to be an incurable disease.\" (Clement of      Alexandria, _Paedagogus_, bk. ii, chapter x.) And Coelius      Aurelianus, one of the chief physicians of antiquity, said that      \"coitus is a brief epilepsy.\" Fere has pointed out that both      these forms of nervous storm are sometimes accompanied by similar      phenomena, by subjective sensations of sight or smell, for      example; and that the two kinds of discharge may even be      combined. (Fere, _Les Epileptiques_, pp. 283-84; also \"Exces      Veneriens et Epilepsie,\" _Comptes-rendus de la Societe de      Biologie_, April 3, 1897, and the same author's _Instinct      Sexuel_, pp. 209, 221, and his \"Priapisme Epileptique,\" _La      Medecine Moderne_, February 4, 1899.) The epileptic convulsion in      some cases involves the sexual mechanism, and it is noteworthy      that epilepsy tends to appear at puberty. In modern times even so      great a physician as Boerhaave said that coitus is a \"true      epilepsy,\" and more recently Roubaud, Hammond, and Kowalevsky      have emphasized the resemblance between coitus and epilepsy,      though without identifying the two states. Some authorities have      considered that coitus is a cause of epilepsy, but this is denied      by Christian, Struempell, and Loewenfeld. (Loewenfeld, _Sexualleben      und Nervenleiden_, 1899, p. 68.) Fere has recorded the case of a      youth in whom the adoption of the practice of masturbation,      several times a day, was followed by epileptic attacks which      ceased when masturbation was abandoned. (Fere, _Comptes-rendus de      la Socitete de Biologie_, April 3, 1897.)    It seems unprofitable at present to attempt any more fundamental analysis  of the sexual impulse. Beaunis, in the work already quoted, vaguely  suggests that we ought possibly to connect the sexual excitation which  leads the male to seek the female with chemical action, either exercised  directly on the protoplasm of the organism or indirectly by the  intermediary of the nervous system, and especially by smell in the higher  animals. Clevenger, Spitzka, Kiernan, and others have also regarded the  sexual impulse as protoplasmic hunger, tracing it back to the presexual  times when one protozoal form absorbed another. In the same way Joanny  Roux, insisting that the sexual need is a need of the whole organism, and  that \"we love with the whole of our body,\" compares the sexual instinct to  hunger, and distinguishes between \"sexual hunger\" affecting the whole  system and \"sexual appetite\" as a more localized desire; he concludes that  the sexual need is an aspect of the nutritive need.[59] Useful as these  views are as a protest against too crude and narrow a conception of the  part played by the sexual impulse, they carry us into a speculative region  where proof is difficult.    We are now, however, at all events, in a better position to define the  contents of the sexual impulse. We see that there are certainly, as Moll  has indicated, two constituents in that impulse; but, instead of being  unrelated, or only distantly related, we see that they are really so  intimately connected as to form two distinct stages in the same process: a  first stage, in which--usually under the parallel influence of internal  and external stimuli--images, desires, and ideals grow up within the mind,  while the organism generally is charged with energy and the sexual  apparatus congested with blood; and a second stage, in which the sexual  apparatus is discharged amid profound sexual excitement, followed by deep  organic relief. By the first process is constituted the tension which the  second process relieves. It seems best to call the first impulse the  _process of tumescence_; the second the _process of detumescence_.[60] The  first, taking on usually a more active form in the male, has the double  object of bringing the male himself into the condition in which "]]]
