Our prior  is a kindly man and very gentle with the faults of others.\"    \"We are Saxons, father. We were wrecked four days since near St.  Valery, and are now bound on an errand of high importance to Duke  William, to whom it is urgent we should arrive as soon as possible.  We have run sore peril on the way, and have been stripped of our  money and valuables.\"    \"Is your mission of importance to the duke as well as to yourselves?\"  the monk asked gravely.    \"It is of great importance to him. I am sure that he would consider  that any one who assisted us on our way had done him good service.\"    The monk look earnestly at them. \"I will speak to the prior,\" he  said. He returned in a few minutes and bade them follow him.    The prior was a tall, gentle old man. \"I have heard your story from  brother Gregory,\" he said, \"and I wished to see you that I might  judge for myself whether so strange a tale, as that two shipwrecked  boys should have important business with our duke, could be believed,  before I did aught to help you forward. You look to me honest of  purpose and of gentle blood, and not, I am sure, belonging to the  class of wayfarer who will trump up any story for the purpose of  gaining alms. Whether your errand with the duke is of the importance  you deem it I cannot say, but if you give me your word that you  consider it an urgent matter, I will aid you to proceed at once.\"    \"We do indeed consider it most urgent, father, and we are sure that  the duke will so regard it. We should not have walked well-nigh a  hundred miles in two days and nights, and that almost without food,  had we not deemed it so.\"    \"Brother Gregory,\" the prior said, \"bid lay-brother Philip at once  prepare three palfreys, and tell him he is to ride himself with  these two Saxon youths to Rouen. The distance is thirty miles,\" he  went on as the monk left the room. \"It is not yet six o'clock, and  though our palfreys are not accustomed to travel at rapid speed,  you will be there this afternoon in time to have audience with the  duke.\"    The lads returned their warm thanks to the prior. \"We would gladly  tell you the purport of our mission,\" Beorn said, \"but we are only  the bearers of news, and the duke might be displeased did he know  that we had confided to any before it reached his own ear.\"    \"I wish not to learn it, my son. It is sufficient for me that you  have a mission to our duke, and that I am possibly furthering his  interest by aiding you to reach him. But, in sooth, I am more moved  by the desire to aid two stranger youths, whom the sea and man alike  seem to have treated hardly. Is it long since you left England?\"    \"We have well-nigh lost account of time, father, so much has taken  place in a few days. 'Tis but a week since we were sailing along  the English coast with a large company in three ships, when a sudden  tempest arose, carried away our sail, blew us off the shore, and  then increasing in fury drove us before it until we were wrecked  on the coast of Ponthieu, near St. Valery. Since then we have been  prisoners, have escaped, and have journeyed here on foot.\"    \"Truly a bad week's work for you,\" the prior said. \"Were all your  ships wrecked?\"    \"No; our two consorts, being lighter and more easily rowed, regained  the land when we were blown off it.\"    \"Conrad of Ponthieu is an evil man,\" the prior said. \"Had you come  ashore twenty miles farther south you would have been beyond his  jurisdiction. I fear that all the seacoast people view the goods  obtained from vessels cast ashore as a lawful prey, but your company  would assuredly have received fair hospitality if cast on the shores  of Normandy itself. But now methinks I hear the patter of the  palfreys' hoofs. Farewell, my sons, and may God who has protected  you through these dangers give you his blessing.\"    The lads knelt before him as he placed his hands on their heads and  gave them his benediction. As they rose brother Gregory entered to  say that the horses were ready, and with renewed thanks to the prior  they followed him to the courtyard, mounted, and rode off with the  lay-brother, glad indeed to find their journey on foot thus abridged.  Impatient as they were to reach Rouen, the gentle pace at which the  palfreys ambled along fretted them very much. Brother Philip kept  up a constant string of talk on the monastery, its estates, the  kindness of the prior, the strictness of the subprior, and other  matters of great interest to himself, but of none to the boys, whose  thoughts were with Harold, chained and in prison. The palfreys,  however, made very fair progress, and it was but three o'clock when  they rode into the streets of Rouen, whose size and grandeur would  at any other time have impressed them much, for it was an incomparably  finer city than London.    \"That is the duke's palace,\" brother Philip said, as they approached  a stately building. \"I will put up the horses at the convent at the  farther corner of this square, and will then go with you to the  palace, as I have orders to tell any officer who may make a difficulty  about you entering, that I am bid by the prior of Forges to say  that you are here on urgent business with the duke, and to pray  that you may have immediate audience with him.\"    In those days great men were easy accessible, and one of the ushers,  on receiving the message from the prior, at once led the boys to  an apartment in which the duke was sitting. He looked up in some  surprise on seeing the two lads standing bareheaded at the door,  while the usher repeated the message he had received.    \"Advance,\" he said. \"What is this business of which the prior of  Forges has sent me word?\"    The two boys advanced and knelt before the duke. He was a man of  about the same age as Harold, with dark hair and complexion, less  tall than the earl, but of a powerful figure, and a stern, resolute  face. The boys had discussed among themselves which should be the  speaker. Wulf had desired that Beorn, being the elder, should deliver  the message, but Beorn insisted that as Wulf himself had received  it from Harold, it was he who should be the one to deliver it to  the duke.    \"My Lord Duke,\" Wulf said, \"we are Saxons, pages of Earl Harold,  and we bring you by his orders the news that the vessel in which  he was sailing along his coast had been blown off by a tempest and  cast on the shore of Ponthieu, near St. Valery, and that he and  his companions have been villainously ill-treated by Conrad, Count  of Ponthieu, who has seized them and cast them into dungeons in his  fortress of Beaurain, Harold and his companions being fettered like  malefactors.\"    The duke was astounded at the news. No greater piece of good fortune  could have befallen him, for he had it in his power to lay his great  rival under an obligation to him, to show himself a generous prince,  and at the same time to obtain substantial benefits. He rose at  once to his feet.    \"By the Host,\" he exclaimed, \"but this is foul treatment indeed of  the noble earl, and brings disgrace alike upon the Count of Ponthieu  and upon me, his liege lord. This wrong shall be remedied, and  speedily. You shall see that I waste no moment in rescuing your  lord from this unmannerly count.\" He struck his hand on the table,  and an attendant entered, \"Pray the knights Fitz-Osberne and Warren  to come hither at once. And how is it, boys,\" he went on, as the  attendant hurried away, \"that you were enabled to bear this message  to me?\"    \"While Harold and his thanes were cast into prison,\" Wulf said, \"the  count kept us to wait upon him; not for our services, but that he  might flout and ill-treat us. We obtained possession of a rope, and  let ourselves down at night from the battlements, and made our way  on foot as far as Forges, where the good prior, learning from us  that we had a message of importance to you, though nothing of its  import, sent us forward on palfreys, so that no time might be lost.\"    \"When did you leave Beaurain?\"    \"It will be three days come midnight,\" Wulf said.    \"And how did you live by the way?\"    \"We took a piece of bread with us, and once obtained food at a  shepherd's hut, and this morning we were well entertained at the  convent of Forges.\"    \"You have proved yourselves good and trusty messengers,\" the duke  said. \"Would I were always as well served. As you are the earl's  pages you are of course of gentle blood?\"    \"We are both his wards, my lord, and shall be thanes when we come  of age.\"    \"And how is it that you, young sir, who seem to be younger than  your companion, are the spokesman?\"    \"It happened thus,\" Wulf said modestly. \"Some fishermen came up  just after we had gained the shore with the loss of many of our  company. I marked that one of them started on seeing Earl Harold,  and whispered to a companion, and feeling sure that he had recognized  my lord, I told the earl of it as we walked towards St. Valery. He  then charged me if he was taken prisoner by the count to endeavour  to bear the news to you, and to give the same orders to my comrade  Beorn, saying it was likely that we might not be so strictly watched  as the men of the company, and might therefore succeed in slipping  away, as indeed turned out to be the case. I was desirous that Beorn  should tell you the tale, being older and more accustomed to the  speech of the court than I was, but he held that the message, being  first given to me, it was I who should deliver it.\"    \"He judged rightly,\" the duke said, \"and deserves credit for thus  standing aside.\"    At this moment two knights entered. \"Fitz-Osberne, Warren,\" the  duke said, \"a foul wrong has been done by Conrad of Ponthieu to  Earl Harold of Wessex, the foremost of Englishmen next to the king  himself, who has, with a company of his thanes, been cast ashore  near St. Valery. Instead of receiving honourable treatment, as was  his due, he has been most foully seized,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8770"],[0,"Milton (#16)"],[1,"name. All artists have intervals of  non-productiveness, usually caused by exhaustion. This was not  Milton's case. His genius was not his master, nor could it pass, like  that of Leonardo da Vinci, unmoved through the most tragic scenes. He  deliberately suspended it at the call of what he believed to be duty  to his country. His unrivalled power of expression was placed at the  service of a passionate political conviction. This prostitution of  faculty avenged itself; for when he did turn to poetry, his strength  was gone from him. The period is chiefly marked, by sonnets, not many,  one in a year, or thereabouts. That _On the religious memory of Mrs.  Catherine Thomson_, in 1646, is the lowest point touched by Milton in  poetry, for his metrical psalms do not deserve the name.    The sonnet, or Elegy on Mrs. Catherine Thomson in the form of a  sonnet, though in poetical merit not distinguishable from the  average religious verse of the Caroline age, has an interest for the  biographer. It breathes a holy calm that is in sharp contrast with the  angry virulence of the pamphlets, which were being written at this  very time by the same pen. Amid his intemperate denunciations of  his political and ecclesiastical foes, it seems that Milton did not  inwardly forfeit the peace which passeth all understanding. He had  formerly said himself (_Doctrine and Disc._), \"nothing more than  disturbance of mind suspends us from approaching to God.\" Now, out of  all the clamour and the bitterness of the battle of the sects, he can  retire and be alone with his heavenly aspirations, which have lost  none of their ardour by having laid aside all their sectarianism. His  genius has forsaken him, but his soul still glows with the fervour  of devotion. And even of this sonnet we may say what Ellis says of  Catullus, that Milton never ceases to be a poet, even when his words  are most prosaic.    The sonnet (xv.) _On the Lord-General Fairfax, at the siege of  Colchester_, written in 1648, is again a manifesto of the writer's  political feelings, nobly uttered, and investing party with a  patriotic dignity not unworthy of the man, Milton. It is a hortatory  lyric, a trumpet-call to his party in the moment of victory to  remember the duties which that victory imposed upon them. It is not  without the splendid resonance of the Italian canzone. But it can  scarcely be called poetry, expressing, as it does, facts directly, and  not indirectly through their imaginative equivalents. Fairfax was,  doubtless, well worthy that Milton should have commemorated him in a  higher strain. Of Fairfax's eminent qualities the sonnet only dwells  on two, his personal valour, which had been tried in many fights--he  had been three times dangerously wounded in the Yorkshire  campaign--and his superiority to sordid interests. Of his generalship,  in which he was second to Cromwell only, and of his love of arts and  learning, nothing is said, though the last was the passion of his  life, for which at forty he renounced ambition. Perhaps in 1648  Milton, who lived a very retired life, did not know of these tastes,  and had not heard that it was by Fairfax's care that the Bodleian  library was saved from wreck on the surrender of Oxford in 1646. And  it was not till later, years after the sonnet was written, that the  same Fairfax, \"whose name in arms through Europe rings,\" became a  competitor of Milton in the attempt to paraphrase the Psalms in metre.    Milton's paraphrase of the Psalms belongs to history, but to the  history of psalmody, not that of poetry. At St. Paul's School, at  fifteen, the boy had turned two psalms, the 114th and the 136th, by  way of exercise. That in his day of plenary inspiration, Milton, who  disdained Dryden as \"a rhymist but no poet,\" and has recorded his own  impatience with the \"drawling versifiers,\" should have undertaken  to grind down the noble antistrophic lyrics of the Hebrew bard  into ballad rhymes for the use of Puritan worship, would have been  impossible. But the idea of being useful to his country had acquired  exclusive possession of his mind. Even his faculty of verse should  be employed in the good cause. If Parliament had set him the task,  doubtless he would have willingly undertaken it, as Corneille, in the  blindness of Catholic obedience, versified the _Imitatio Christi_ at  the command of the Jesuits. Milton was not officially employed, but  voluntarily took up the work. The Puritans were bent upon substituting  a new version of the Davidic Psalms for that of Sternhold and Hopkins,  for no other reason than that the latter formed part of the hated Book  of Common Prayer. The Commons had pronounced in favour of a version by  one of their own members, the staunch Puritan M.P. for Truro, Francis  Rouse. The Lords favoured a rival book, and numerous other claimants  were before the public. Dissatisfied with any of these attempts,  Milton would essay himself. In 1648 he turned nine psalms, and  recurring to the task in 1653, \"did into verse\" eight more. He thought  these specimens worth preserving, and annexing to the volume of his  poems which he published himself in 1673. As this doggerel continues  to encumber each succeeding edition of the _Poetical Works_, it is as  well that Milton did not persevere with his experiment and produce a  complete Psalter. He prudently abandoned a task in which success is  impossible. A metrical psalm, being a compromise between the psalm and  the hymn, like other compromises, misses, rather than combines, the  distinctive excellences of the things united. That Milton should ever  have attempted what poetry forbids, is only another proof how entirely  at this period more absorbing motives had possession of his mind, and  overbore his poetical judgment. It is a coincidence worth remembering  that Milton's contemporary, Lord Clarendon, was at this very time  solacing his exile at Madrid by composing, not a version but a  commentary upon the Psalms, \"applying those devotions to the troubles  of this time.\"    Yet all the while that he was thus unfaithful in practice to his art,  it was poetry that possessed his real affections, and the reputation  of a poet which formed his ambition. It was a temporary separation,  and not a divorce, which he designed. In each successive pamphlet he  reiterates his undertaking to redeem his pledge of a great work, as  soon as liberty shall be consolidated in the realm. Meanwhile, as an  earnest of what should be hereafter, he permitted the publication of a  collection of his early poems.    This little volume of some 200 pages, rude in execution as it is,  ranks among the highest prizes of the book collector, very few copies  being extant, and those mostly in public libraries. It appeared in  1645, and owed its appearance, not to the vanity of the author, but  to the zeal of a publisher. Humphrey Moseley, at the sign, of the  Prince's Arms, in St. Paul's Churchyard, suggested the collection to  Milton, and undertook the risk of it, though knowing, as he says  in the prefixed address of The Stationer to the Reader, that \"the  slightest pamphlet is nowadays more vendible than the works of  learnedest men.\" It may create some surprise that, in 1645, there  should have been any public in England for a volume of verse. Naseby  had been fought in June, Philiphaugh in September, Fairfax and  Cromwell were continuing their victorious career in the west, Chester,  Worcester, and the stronghold of Oxford, alone holding out for the  King. It was clear that the conflict was decided in favour of the  Parliament, but men's minds must have been strung to a pitch of  intense expectation as to what kind of settlement was to come. Yet, at  the very crisis of the civil strife, we find a London publisher able  to bring out the Poems of Waller (1644), and sufficiently encouraged  by their reception to follow them up, in the next year, with the Poems  of Mr. John Milton. Are we warranted in inferring that a finer public  was beginning to loathe the dreary theological polemic of which it had  had a surfeit, and turned to a book of poetry as that which was  most unlike the daily garbage, just as a later public absorbed five  thousand copies of Scott's _Lay of the Last Minstrel_ in the year of  Austerlitz? One would like to know who were the purchasers of  Milton and Waller, when the cavalier families were being ruined by  confiscations and compositions, and Puritan families would turn with  pious horror from the very name of a Mask.    Milton was himself editor of his own volume, and prefixed to it, again  out of Virgil's Eclogues, the characteristic motto, \"Baccare frontem  Cingite, ne vati noceat mala lingua _futuro_,\" indicating that his  poetry was all to come.          CHAPTER VIII.    THE LATIN SECRETARYSHIP.      The Crown having fallen on January 30, 1649, and the House of Lords by  the vote of February 6 following, the sovereign power in England was  for the moment in the hands of that fragment of the Long Parliament,  which remained after the various purges and expulsions to which it had  been subjected. Some of the excluded members were allowed to return,  and by occasional new elections in safe boroughs the number of members  was raised to one hundred and fifty, securing an average attendance of  about seventy. The future government of the nation was declared to be  by way of a republic, and the writs ran in the name of the Keepers  of the Liberty of England, by authority of Parliament. But the real  centre of power was the Council of State, a body of forty-one members,  nominated for a period of twelve months, according to a plan of  constitution devised by the army leaders. In the hands of this  republican Council was concentrated a combination of power such as had  never been wielded by any English monarch. But, though its attribution  of authority was great, its exercise of the powers lodged with it was  hampered by differences among its members, "]]]
