Although the Babylonian account may have had some foundation in fact,  from a tradition of a prior revelation, it plainly bears the marks of  error. \"The Babylonian stories of creation are full of grotesque and  polytheistic ideas, while those of the Bible speak only of the one  living and true God.\" \"All things,\" the Babylonian legend says, \"were  produced at the first from Tiamat.\" \"The gods came into being in long  succession, but, at length, enmity arose between them and Tiamat, who  created monsters to oppose them. Merodach, a solar deity, vanquished  Tiamat, cut her body in two, and with one-half of it made a firmament  supporting the upper waters in the sky, etc., etc.\" The Babylonian  gods, like even those of the classics, were criminals fit only for  prison or death.    Alfred Russell Wallace, who, with Darwin, devised the evolution  theory, says: \"There must have been three interpositions of a Divine  and supernatural power to account for things as they are: _the  agreement of science with Genesis is very striking_: There is a  gulf between matter and nothing; one between life and the non-living;  and a third between man and the lower creation; and science can not  bridge them!\"    This \"striking agreement\" between science and Genesis I, is shown by  the fact that at least 11 great events are enumerated in the same  order as claimed by modern science: 1. The earth was \"waste and void\";  2. \"Darkness was upon the face of the deep\"; 3. Light appears; 4. A  clearing expanse, or firmament; 5. The elevation of the land and the  formation of the seas; 6. Grass, herbs and fruit trees appear; 7. The  sun, moon and stars _appear_; 8. Marine animals were created;  9. \"Winged fowls\" were created; 10. Land animals were created; 11. Man  was created.    The chance of guessing the exact order of these 11 great events is  ascertained by the law of permutations-the product of the numbers from  1 to 11, which is 39,916,800.  Therefore, Moses had one chance out of  39,916,800 to guess the correct order of these 11 great events, as  revealed both by science and revelation. If, for example, the first 11  letters of the alphabet were arranged in some unknown miscellaneous  order, any one would have but one chance out of 39,916,800 to guess  the order. If Moses did not have the order revealed to him, he never  could have guessed it. Therefore, he was inspired and was told the  order.    This mathematical demonstration annihilates the contradicting theory  of evolution. At once it proves that the account was divinely  inspired, and man came by special creation and not by evolution. The  fact that the language of Genesis is in remarkable harmony with all  proven modern scientific theories, and manifestly confirmed by them,  is a proof in favor of the creation story, decisive and final.    This harmony is manifest whether the Heb. _yom_, day, be taken to  mean a long period, as advocated by many biblical scholars, or a  literal day of 24 hours, followed, it may be, by years or ages of  continuance of the work, before the next day's work of 24 hours began.    Believing that this interpretation does no violence to the text, and  that it is especially in harmony with the statements in the fourth  commandment and elsewhere in the Bible, it is here briefly presented  as one interpretation, showing the marvelous harmony between  revelation and the proven, and even the generally accepted, scientific  theories. The stately procession of events is the same, no matter  which interpretation is accepted, and doubtless will remain, even if  both must yield to another and better interpretation. This majestic  divine order, in harmony with both science and revelation, removes all  doubt of special creation.    Another interpretation, advocated by many scholars, is that all  geologic ages may have intervened during the time indicated between  the 1st and 2nd verses of Gen. I.    The following is a possible, and, it would seem, a probable  interpretation of the inspired creation story. The words of Scripture,  whether from the American Revision, or marginal rendering of the  original Hebrew, or other translation, are put in quotation marks:--      THE CREATION--GENERAL STATEMENT    \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth,\" including  the sun, moon and stars, and all other matter in any form.      DETAILED STATEMENT OF THE ORDER OF CREATION    \"And the earth was waste and void,\" literally \"desolation and  emptiness.\" And, on account of the thick vapors in the hot atmosphere,  \"darkness was upon the face of the deep,\" and doubtless had been for  ages.    \"And the Spirit of God was brooding upon the face of the waters,\" and  _perhaps_ was calling into being the lowest forms of marine life.      The First Day's Work. Light Appears.    \"And God said, 'Let the light appear',\" through the thick vapors. And  the light appeared, so that the day could now be distinguished from  the night. \"And there was evening, and there was morning, one day.\"  This day did not need to be an age or even 24 hours for God's  work. How long did it take light to appear? Many years, and even ages,  may have followed between each day's work as the \"days\" were not  necessarily consecutive, and it is not so stated.      Second Day's Work. A Clearing Expanse.    \"And God said, 'Let there be a clearing expanse (called heaven)  dividing the waters which were on the earth from the waters in the  thick clouds above, firmly suspended in the air'.\" This may have  continued a long time, though begun in 24 hours.      Third Day's Work. Land, sea and vegetation appear.    \"And God said, 'Let the waters under the expanse be gathered together  into one place (seas and oceans), and let the dry land appear'.\" The  contraction of the cooling earth caused the elevation of the land, and  the draining of the waters into the seas. The geologist Lyell says,  \"All land has been under water.\" Hitchcock says, \"The surface of the  globe has been a shoreless ocean.\" \"And the earth brought forth grass,  herb yielding seed after its kind, and tree bearing fruit, wherein is  the seed thereof, after its kind.\" Though the sun was not yet visible  on account of dense clouds and vapors, the warm, humid atmosphere was  suitable for the grass, herbs, and fruit trees,--three great classes  which represented the vegetable kingdom. Ages may have again  intervened.      The Fourth Day's Work. Sun, moon and stars made visible.    \"And God said, 'Let lights be seen in the open expanse of heaven, to  divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for  seasons, and for days and years'.\" \"And God made the two great lights  to _appear_,\" since neither had been seen through the thick  clouds, \"the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to  rule the night. He made the stars also to _appear_.\" Though  created first, the stars would appear last. Ages more may have  intervened.      The Fifth Day's Work. Animal life in sea and air.    \"And God said, 'Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures,  and let birds fly above the earth upon the face of the expanse of the  heaven'.\" \"And God created great sea monsters, and every living  creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly, after  their kinds, and every winged fowl after its kind.\"  Geology and Moses  alike testify that swarms of animals filled the seas. The ages rolled  on while they \"filled the waters of the seas and fowl multiplied on  the earth.\"      The Sixth Day's Work. The creation of land-animals and man.    \"And God said, 'Let the earth bring forth the living creature after  its kind, cattle and creeping things, and beast of the earth after its  kind'.\" The fifth day animals began to _swarm_ the seas; the  sixth day, to cover the land.  \"And God said, 'Let us make man in our  image, after our likeness',\" in \"knowledge after the image of him that  created him,\" (Col. 3:10) and \"in righteousness and true holiness,\"  (Eph. 4:24). Yet a professor in a great university was so dense as to  insist that the Scriptures taught that the likeness was not in  \"knowledge, righteousness and true holiness,\" but in the bodily  form. \"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God  created he him.\" The last of all creation as both revelation and  science testify. The image is mental and moral and spiritual. No such  image in any other species.    The body chosen was higher and better than the form of any animal. It  resembles the bodies of mammals of the highest type. Why should it  not? The vast number of animal species, of almost every conceivable  size and shape, could not furnish a form so well adapted to the use of  man as that which the Creator gave him.  Would it have been better if  man had been created in the form of a fish, a lizard, a serpent, a  dog, or a horse, or a bird? How could the body have been created  without bearing resemblance to some form of the million species of  animals? A resemblance can be traced through the whole creation, the  material as well as the animal, but it does not follow that one  species is descended from another, but that there was one general  plan, and one God. The existence of man, who can not be otherwise  accounted for, proves the existence of the Creator.        25. ANALOGY; MATHEMATICS, LAWS      Analogy raises a presumption against evolution. Analogy is not a  demonstration. It is an illustration that strengthens and confirms  other arguments. Both the science of mathematics and all physical laws  must have come into being in an instant of time. Evolution is not  God's usual method of creation.    1. MATHEMATICS.--There is no evolution in the science of  mathematics. There is no change or growth or development. God is the  author of all mathematical principles.

(3) The more specialized the adjustment of response and stimulus to each  other (for, taking the sequence of activities into account, the stimuli  are adapted to reactions as well as reactions to stimuli) the more rigid  and the less generally available is the training secured. In equivalent  language, less intellectual or educative quality attaches to the  training. The usual way of stating this fact is that the more  specialized the reaction, the less is the skill acquired in practicing  and perfecting it transferable to other modes of behavior. According  to the orthodox theory of formal discipline, a pupil in studying his  spelling lesson acquires, besides ability to spell those particular  words, an increase of power of observation, attention, and recollection  which may be employed whenever these powers are needed. As matter of  fact, the more he confines himself to noticing and fixating the forms of  words, irrespective of connection with other things (such as the  meaning of the words, the context in which they are habitually used, the  derivation and classification of the verbal form, etc.) the less likely  is he to acquire an ability which can be used for anything except the  mere noting of verbal visual forms. He may not even be increasing his  ability to make accurate distinctions among geometrical forms, to say  nothing of ability to observe in general. He is merely selecting the  stimuli supplied by the forms of the letters and the motor reactions  of oral or written reproduction. The scope of coordination (to use  our prior terminology) is extremely limited. The connections which are  employed in other observations and recollections (or reproductions) are  deliberately eliminated when the pupil is exercised merely upon forms  of letters and words. Having been excluded, they cannot be restored when  needed. The ability secured to observe and to recall verbal forms is  not available for perceiving and recalling other things. In the ordinary  phraseology, it is not transferable. But the wider the context--that is  to say, the more varied the stimuli and responses coordinated--the more  the ability acquired is available for the effective performance of  other acts; not, strictly speaking, because there is any \"transfer,\"  but because the wide range of factors employed in the specific act is  equivalent to a broad range of activity, to a flexible, instead of to a  narrow and rigid, coordination. (4) Going to the root of the matter, the  fundamental fallacy of the theory is its dualism; that is to say, its  separation of activities and capacities from subject matter. There is no  such thing as an ability to see or hear or remember in general; there  is only the ability to see or hear or remember something. To talk about  training a power, mental or physical, in general, apart from the subject  matter involved in its exercise, is nonsense. Exercise may react  upon circulation, breathing, and nutrition so as to develop vigor or  strength, but this reservoir is available for specific ends only by use  in connection with the material means which accomplish them. Vigor will  enable a man to play tennis or golf or to sail a boat better than he  would if he were weak. But only by employing ball and racket, ball and  club, sail and tiller, in definite ways does he become expert in any one  of them; and expertness in one secures expertness in another only so far  as it is either a sign of aptitude for fine muscular coordinations or as  the same kind of coordination is involved in all of them. Moreover, the  difference between the training of ability to spell which comes from  taking visual forms in a narrow context and one which takes them in  connection with the activities required to grasp meaning, such  as context, affiliations of descent, etc., may be compared to the  difference between exercises in the gymnasium with pulley weights to  \"develop\" certain muscles, and a game or sport. The former is uniform  and mechanical; it is rigidly specialized. The latter is varied from  moment to moment; no two acts are quite alike; novel emergencies have to  be met; the coordinations forming have to be kept flexible and elastic.  Consequently, the training is much more \"general\"; that is to say, it  covers a wider territory and includes more factors. Exactly the same  thing holds of special and general education of the mind.    A monotonously uniform exercise may by practice give great skill in one  special act; but the skill is limited to that act, be it bookkeeping or  calculations in logarithms or experiments in hydrocarbons. One may be  an authority in a particular field and yet of more than usually poor  judgment in matters not closely allied, unless the training in the  special field has been of a kind to ramify into the subject matter  of the other fields. (5) Consequently, such powers as observation,  recollection, judgment, esthetic taste, represent organized results of  the occupation of native active tendencies with certain subject matters.  A man does not observe closely and fully by pressing a button for  the observing faculty to get to work (in other words by \"willing\"  to observe); but if he has something to do which can be accomplished  successfully only through intensive and extensive use of eye and hand,  he naturally observes. Observation is an outcome, a consequence, of  the interaction of sense organ and subject matter. It will vary,  accordingly, with the subject matter employed.    It is consequently futile to set up even the ulterior development of  faculties of observation, memory, etc., unless we have first determined  what sort of subject matter we wish the pupil to become expert in  observing and recalling and for what purpose. And it is only repeating  in another form what has already been said, to declare that the  criterion here must be social. We want the person to note and recall and  judge those things which make him an effective competent member of the  group in which he is associated with others. Otherwise we might as well  set the pupil to observing carefully cracks on the wall and set him to  memorizing meaningless lists of words in an unknown tongue--which is  about what we do in fact when we give way to the doctrine of formal  discipline. If the observing habits of a botanist or chemist or engineer  are better habits than those which are thus formed, it is because  they deal with subject matter which is more significant in life. In  concluding this portion of the discussion, we note that the distinction  between special and general education has nothing to do with the  transferability of function or power. In the literal sense, any transfer  is miraculous and impossible. But some activities are broad; they  involve a coordination of many factors. Their development demands  continuous alternation and readjustment. As conditions change, certain  factors are subordinated, and others which had been of minor importance  come to the front. There is constant redistribution of the focus of the  action, as is seen in the illustration of a game as over against pulling  a fixed weight by a series of uniform motions. Thus there is practice in  prompt making of new combinations with the focus of activity shifted to  meet change in subject matter. Wherever an activity is broad in  scope (that is, involves the coordinating of a large variety of  sub-activities), and is constantly and unexpectedly obliged to change  direction in its progressive development, general education is bound  to result. For this is what \"general\" means; broad and flexible. In  practice, education meets these conditions, and hence is general, in the  degree in which it takes account of social relationships. A person may  become expert in technical philosophy, or philology, or mathematics or  engineering or financiering, and be inept and ill-advised in his action  and judgment outside of his specialty. If however his concern with  these technical subject matters has been connected with human activities  having social breadth, the range of active responses called into play  and flexibly integrated is much wider. Isolation of subject matter  from a social context is the chief obstruction in current practice to  securing a general training of mind. Literature, art, religion, when  thus dissociated, are just as narrowing as the technical things which  the professional upholders of general education strenuously oppose.    Summary. The conception that the result of the educative process is  capacity for further education stands in contrast with some other  ideas which have profoundly influenced practice. The first contrasting  conception considered is that of preparing or getting ready for some  future duty or privilege. Specific evil effects were pointed out which  result from the fact that this aim diverts attention of both teacher  and taught from the only point to which it may be fruitfully  directed--namely, taking advantage of the needs and possibilities of the  immediate present. Consequently it defeats its own professed purpose.  The notion that education is an unfolding from within appears to have  more likeness to the conception of growth which has been set forth. But  as worked out in the theories of Froebel and Hegel, it involves  ignoring the interaction of present organic tendencies with the present  environment, just as much as the notion of preparation. Some implicit  whole is regarded as given ready-made and the significance of growth  is merely transitory; it is not an end in itself, but simply a means  of making explicit what is already implicit. Since that which is not  explicit cannot be made definite use of, something has to be found to  represent it. According to Froebel, the mystic symbolic value of certain"]]]
