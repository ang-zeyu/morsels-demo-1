Of course every eye was at first fixed upon this dome, where Ozma and  Dorothy and the Skeezers were still fast prisoners. But soon their  attention was caught by a more brilliant sight, for here was the  Diamond Swan swimming just before them, its long neck arched proudly,  the amethyst eyes gleaming and all the diamond-sprinkled feathers  glistening splendidly under the rays of the sun.    \"That,\" said Glinda, \"is the transformation of Queen Coo-ce-oh, the  haughty and wicked witch who betrayed the three Adepts at Magic and  treated her people like slaves.\"    \"She's wonderfully beautiful now,\" remarked the Frogman.    \"It doesn't seem like much of a punishment,\" said Trot. \"The Flathead  Su-dic ought to have made her a toad.\"    \"I am sure Coo-ee-oh is punished,\" said Glinda, \"for she has lost all  her magic power and her grand palace and can no longer misrule the poor  Skeezers.\"    \"Let us call to her, and hear what she has to say,\" proposed the Wizard.    So Glinda beckoned the Diamond Swan, which swam gracefully to a  position near them. Before anyone could speak Coo-ee-oh called to them  in a rasping voice--for the voice of a swan is always harsh and  unpleasant--and said with much pride:    \"Admire me, Strangers!  Admire the lovely Coo-ee-oh, the handsomest  creature in all Oz. Admire me!\"    \"Handsome is as handsome does,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"Are your deeds  lovely, Coo-ce-oh?\"    \"Deeds?  What deeds can a swan do but swim around and give pleasure to  all beholders?\" said the sparkling bird.    \"Have you forgotten your former life? Have you forgotten your magic and  witchcraft?\" inquired the Wizard.    \"Magic--witchcraft? Pshaw, who cares for such silly things?\" retorted  Coo-ee-oh. \"As for my past life, it seems like an unpleasant dream. I  wouldn't go back to it if I could. Don't you admire my beauty,  Strangers?\"    \"Tell us, Coo-ee-oh,\" said Glinda earnestly, \"if you can recall enough  of your witchcraft to enable us to raise the sunken island to the  surface of the lake. Tell us that and I'll give you a string of pearls  to wear around your neck and add to your beauty.\"    \"Nothing can add to my beauty, for I'm the most beautiful creature  anywhere in the whole world.\"    \"But how can we raise the island?\"    \"I don't know and I don't care. If ever I knew I've forgotten, and I'm  glad of it,\" was the response. \"Just watch me circle around and see me  glitter!    \"It's no use,\" said Button Bright; \"the old Swan is too much in love  with herself to think of anything else.\"    \"That's a fact,\" agreed Betsy with a sigh; \"but we've got to get Ozma  and Dorothy out of that lake, somehow or other.\"    \"And we must do it in our own way,\" added the Scarecrow.    \"But how?\" asked Uncle Henry in a grave voice, for he could not bear to  think of his dear niece Dorothy being out there under water; \"how shall  we do it?\"    \"Leave that to Glinda,\" advised the Wizard, realizing he was helpless  to do it himself.    \"If it were just an ordinary sunken island,\" said the powerful  sorceress, \"there would be several ways by which I might bring it to  the surface again. But this is a Magic Isle, and by some curious art of  witchcraft, unknown to any but Queen Coo-ce-oh, it obeys certain  commands of magic and will not respond to any other. I do not despair  in the least, but it will require some deep study to solve this  difficult problem. If the Swan could only remember the witchcraft that  she invented and knew as a woman, I could force her to tell me the  secret, but all her former knowledge is now forgotten.\"    \"It seems to me,\" said the Wizard after a brief silence had followed  Glinda's speech, \"that there are three fishes in this lake that used to  be Adepts at Magic and from whom Coo-ee-oh stole much of her knowledge.  If we could find those fishes and return them to their former shapes,  they could doubtless tell us what to do to bring the sunken island to  the surface.\"    \"I have thought of those fishes,\" replied Glinda, \"but among so many  fishes as this lake contains how are we to single them out?\"    You will understand, of course, that had Glinda been at home in her  castle, where the Great Book of Records was, she would have known that  Ervic the Skeezer already had taken the gold and silver and bronze  fishes from the lake. But that act had been recorded in the Book after  Glinda had set out on this journey, so it was all unknown to her.    \"I think I see a boat yonder on the shore,\" said Ojo the Munchkin boy,  pointing to a place around the edge of the lake. \"If we could get that  boat and row all over the lake, calling to the magic fishes, we might  be able to find them.\"    \"Let us go to the boat,\" said the Wizard.    They walked around the lake to where the boat was stranded upon the  beach, but found it empty. It was a mere shell of blackened steel, with  a collapsible roof that, when in position, made the submarine  watertight, but at present the roof rested in slots on either side of  the magic craft. There were no oars or sails, no machinery to make the  boat go, and although Glinda promptly realized it was meant to be  operated by witchcraft, she was not acquainted with that sort of magic.    \"However,\" said she, \"the boat is merely a boat, and I believe I can  make it obey a command of sorcery, as well as it did the command of  witchcraft. After I have given a little thought to the matter, the boat  will take us wherever we desire to go.\"    \"Not all of us,\" returned the Wizard, \"for it won't hold so many. But,  most noble Sorceress, provided you can make the boat go, of what use  will it be to us?\"    \"Can't we use it to catch the three fishes?\" asked Button Bright.    \"It will not be necessary to use the boat for that purpose,\" replied  Glinda. \"Wherever in the lake the enchanted fishes may be, they will  answer to my call. What I am trying to discover is how the boat came to  be on this shore, while the island on which it belongs is under water  yonder. Did Coo-ee-oh come here in the boat to meet the Flatheads  before the island was sunk, or afterward?\"    No one could answer that question, of course; but while they pondered  the matter three young men advanced from the line of trees, and rather  timidly bowed to the strangers.    \"Who are you, and where did you come from?\" inquired the Wizard.    \"We are Skeezers,\" answered one of them, \"and our home is on the Magic  Isle of the Lake. We ran away when we saw you coming, and hid behind  the trees, but as you are Strangers and seem to be friendly we decided  to meet you, for we are in great trouble and need assistance.\"    \"If you belong on the island, why are you here?\" demanded Glinda.    So they told her all the story: How the Queen had defied the Flatheads  and submerged the whole island so that her enemies could not get to it  or destroy it; how, when the Flatheads came to the shore, Coo-ee-oh had  commanded them, together with their friend Ervic, to go with her in the  submarine to conquer the Su-dic, and how the boat had shot out from the  basement of the sunken isle, obeying a magic word, and risen to the  surface, where it opened and floated upon the water.    Then followed the account of how the Su-dic had transformed Coo-ee-oh  into a swan, after which she had forgotten all the witchcraft she ever  knew. The young men told how, in the night when they were asleep, their  comrade Ervic had mysteriously disappeared, while the boat in some  strange manner had floated to the shore and stranded upon the beach.    That was all they knew. They had searched in vain for three days for  Ervic. As their island was under water and they could not get back to  it, the three Skeezers had no place to go, and so had waited patiently  beside their boat for something to happen.    Being questioned by Glinda and the Wizard, they told all they knew  about Ozma and Dorothy and declared the two girls were still in the  village under the Great Dome. They were quite safe and would be well  cared for by Lady Aurex, now that the Queen who opposed them was out of  the way.    When they had gleaned all the information they could from these  Skeezers, the Wizard said to Glinda:    \"If you find you can make this boat obey your sorcery, you could have  it return to the island, submerge itself, and enter the door in the  basement from which it came. But I cannot see that our going to the  sunken island would enable our friends to escape. We would only Join  them as prisoners.\"    \"Not so, friend Wizard,\" replied Glinda. \"If the boat would obey my  commands to enter the basement door, it would also obey my commands to  come out again, and I could bring Ozma and Dorothy back with me.\"    \"And leave all of our people still imprisoned?\" asked one of the  Skeezers reproachfully.    \"By making several trips in the boat, Glinda could fetch all your  people to the shore,\" replied the Wizard.    \"But what could they do then?\" inquired another Skeezer. \"They would  have no homes and no place to go, and would be at the mercy of their  enemies, the Flatheads.\"    \"That is true,\" said Glinda the Good. \"And as these people are Ozma's  subjects, I think she would refuse to escape with Dorothy and leave the  others behind, or to abandon the island which is the lawful home of the  Skeezers. I believe the best plan will be to summon the three fishes  and learn from them how to raise the island.\"    The little Wizard seemed to think that this was rather a forlorn hope.    \"How will you summon them,\" he asked the lovely Sorceress, \"and how can  they hear you?\"    \"That is something we must consider carefully,\" responded stately  Glinda, with a serene smile.  \"I think I can find a way.\"    All of Ozma's counsellors applauded this sentiment, for they knew well  the powers of the Sorceress.    \"Very well,\" agreed the Wizard. \"Summon them, most noble Glinda.\"          Chapter Eighteen    The Cleverness of Ervic      We must now return to Ervic the Skeezer,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9612"],[0,"The Botanic Garden (#16)"],[1,"of dry wood, which by producing a white flame renders all the  other colours visible in a moment.]    [_With golden purples_. l. 288.

[_Etruria! next_. l. 291. Etruria may perhaps vie with China itself in  the antiquity of its arts. The times of its greatest splendour were  prior to the foundations of Rome, and the reign of one of its best  princes, Janus, was the oldest epoch the Romans knew. The earliest  historians speak of the Etruscans as being then of high antiquity, most  probably a colony from Phoenicia, to which a Pelasgian colony acceded,  and was united soon after Deucalion's flood. The peculiar character of  their earthern vases consists in the admirable beauty, simplicity, and  diversity of forms, which continue the best models of taste to the  artists of the present times; and in a species of non-vitreous encaustic  painting, which was reckoned, even in the time of Pliny, among the lost  arts of antiquity, but which has lately been recovered by the ingenuity  and industry of Mr. Wedgwood. It is supposed that the principal  manufactories were about Nola, at the foot of Vesuvius; for it is in  that neighbourhood that the greatest quantities of antique vases have  been found; and it is said that the general taste of the inhabitants is  apparently influenced by them; insomuch that strangers coming to Naples,  are commonly struck with the diversity and elegance even of the most  ordinary vases for common uses.

Coal has probably all been sublimed more  or less from the clay, with which it was at first formed in decomposing  morasses; the petroleum seems to have been separated and condensed again  in superior strata, and a still finer kind of oil, as naphtha, has  probably had the same origin. Some of these liquid oils have again lost  their more volatile parts, and become cannel-coal, asphaltum, jet, and  amber, according to the purity of the original fossil oil. Dr. Priestley  has shewn, that essential oils long exposed to the atmosphere absorb  both the vital and phlogistic part of it; whence it is probable their  becoming solid may in great measure depend, as well as by the exhalation  of their more volatile parts. On distillation with volatile alcaly all  these fossil oils are shewn to contain the acid of amber, which evinces  the identity of their origin. If a piece of amber be rubbed it attracts  straws and hairs, whence the discovery of electricity, and whence its  name, from electron the Greek word for amber.]    [_Immortal Franklin_. l. 356.
