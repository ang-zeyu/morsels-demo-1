He inquired if the family  were at home, hired a guide, and arrived at length by a rugged path  which wound itself round steep rocks, to the summit of them, and  finally to the castle, which was perched there like an eagle's nest.  The tinkling of the bells on Edward's sledge attracted the attention  of the inmates; the door was opened with prompt hospitality; servants  appeared with torches; Edward was assisted to emerge from under the  frozen apron of his carriage, out of his heavy pelisse, stiff with  hoar-frost, and up a comfortable staircase into a long saloon of  simple construction, where a genial warmth appeared to welcome him  from a huge stove in the corner. The servants here placed two large  burning candles in massive silver sconces, and went out to announce  the stranger.    The fitting-up of the room, or rather saloon, was perfectly simple.  Family portraits, in heavy frames, hung round the walls, diversified  by some maps. Magnificent stags' horns were arranged between; and  the taste of the master of the house was easily detected in the  hunting-knives, powder-flasks, carbines, smoking-bags, and sportsmen's  pouches, which were arranged, not without taste, as trophies of the  chase. The ceiling was supported by large beams, dingy with smoke  and age; and on the sides of the room were long benches, covered and  padded with dark cloth, and studded with large brass nails; while  round the dinner-table were placed several arm-chairs, also of  ancient date. All bore the aspect of the good old times, of a simple,  patriarchal life with affluence. Edward felt as if there were a  kind welcome in the inanimate objects which surrounded him, when the  inner-door opened, and the master of the house entered, preceded by a  servant, and welcomed his guest with courteous cordiality.    Some apologies which Edward offered on account of his intrusion, were  silenced in a moment.    \"Come, now, Lieutenant,\" said the Baron, \"I must introduce you to my  family. You are not such a stranger to us, as you fancy.\"    With these words he took Edward by the arm, and, lighted by the  servant, they passed through several lofty rooms, which were very  handsomely furnished, although in an old-fashioned style, with faded  Flemish carpets, large chandeliers, and high-backed chairs: everything  in keeping with what the youth had already seen in the castle. Here  were the ladies of the house. At the other end of the room, by the  side of an immense stove, ornamented with a large shield of the family  arms, richly emblazoned, and crowned by a gigantic Turk, in a most  comfortable attitude of repose sat the lady of the house, an elderly  matron of tolerable circumference, in a gown of dark red satin, with  a black mantle and a snow-white cap. She appeared to be playing cards  with the chaplain, who sat opposite to her at the table, and the Baron  Friedenberg to have made the third hand at ombre, till he was called  away to welcome his guest. On the other side of the room were two  young ladies, an elder person, who might be a governess, and a couple  of children, very much engrossed by a game at lotto.    As Edward entered, the ladies rose to greet him, a chair was placed  for him near the mistress of the house, and very soon a cup of  chocolate and a bottle of tokay were served on a rich silver salver,  to restore the traveler after the cold and discomfort of his drive:  in fact it was easy for him to feel that these \"far away\" people were  by no means displeased at his arrival. An agreeable conversation  soon began among all parties. His travels, the shooting-match, the  neighborhood, agriculture, all afforded subjects, and in a quarter  of an hour Edward felt as if he had long been domesticated with these  simple but truly well-informed people.    Two hours flew swiftly by, and then a bell sounded for supper; the  servants returned with lights, announced that the supper was on the  table, and lighted the company into the dining-room--the same into  which Edward had first been ushered. Here, in the background, some  other characters appeared on the scene--the agent, a couple of his  subalterns, and the physician. The guests ranged themselves round the  table. Edward's place was between the Baron and his wife. The chaplain  said a short grace, when the Baroness, with an uneasy look, glanced at  her husband over Edward's shoulder, and said, in a low whisper--    \"My love, we are thirteen--that will never do.\"    The Baron smiled, beckoned to the youngest of the clerks, and  whispered to him. The youth bowed, and withdrew. The servant took the  cover away, and served his supper in the next room.    \"My wife,\" said Friedenberg, \"is superstitious, as all mountaineers  are. She thinks it unlucky to dine thirteen. It certainly has happened  twice (whether from chance or not who can tell?) that we have had to  mourn the death of an acquaintance who had, a short time before, made  the thirteenth at our table.\"    \"This idea is not confined to the mountains. I know many people in the  capital who think with the Baroness,\" said Edward. \"Although in a town  such ideas, which belong more especially to the olden time, are more  likely to be lost in the whirl and bustle which usually silences  everything that is not essentially matter of fact.\"    \"Ah, yes, Lieutenant,\" replied the Baron, smiling good-humoredly,  \"we keep up old customs better in the mountains. You see that by our  furniture. People in the capital would call this sadly old-fashioned.\"    \"That which is really good and beautiful can never appear out of  date,\" rejoined Edward courteously; \"and here, if I mistake not,  presides a spirit that is ever striving after both. I must confess,  Baron, that when I first entered your house, it was this very aspect  of the olden time that enchanted me beyond measure.\"    \"That is always the effect which simplicity has on every unspoiled  mind,\" answered Friedenberg: \"but townspeople have seldom a taste for  such things.\"    \"I was partly educated on my father's estate,\" said Edward, \"which was  situated in the Highlands; and it appears to me as if, when I entered  your house, I were visiting a neighbor of my father's, for the general  aspect is quite the same here as with us.\"    \"Yes,\" said the chaplain, \"mountainous districts have all a family  likeness: the same necessities, the same struggles with nature, the  same seclusion, all produce the same way of life among mountaineers.\"    \"On that account the prejudice against the number thirteen was  especially familiar to me,\" replied Edward. \"We also dislike it;  and we retain a consideration for many supernatural, or at  least inexplicable things, which I have met with again in this  neighborhood.\"    \"Yes, here, almost more than anywhere else,\" continued the chaplain,  \"I think we excel all other mountaineers in the number and variety of  our legends and ghost stories. I assure you that there is not a cave  or a church, or, above all, a castle, for miles round about, of which  we could not relate something supernatural.\"    The Baroness, who perceived the turn which the conversation was likely  to take, thought it better to send the children to bed; and when they  were gone, the priest continued, \"Even here, in this castle--\"    \"Here!\" inquired Edward, \"in this very castle?\"    \"Yes, yes! Lieutenant,\" interposed the Baron, \"this house has the  reputation of being haunted; and the most extraordinary thing is, that  the matter cannot be denied by the skeptical, or accounted for by the  reasonable.\"    \"And yet,\" said Edward, \"the castle looks so cheerful, so habitable.\"    \"Yes, this part which we live in,\" answered the Baron; \"but it  consists of only a few apartments sufficient for my family and these  gentlemen; the other portion of the building is half in ruins, and  dates from the period when men established themselves on the mountains  for greater safety.\"    \"There are some who maintain,\" said the physician, \"that a part of the  walls of the stern tower itself are of Roman origin; but that would  surely be difficult to prove.\"    \"But, gentlemen,\" observed the Baroness, \"you are losing yourselves in  learned descriptions as to the erection of the castle, and our guest  is kept in ignorance of what he is anxious to hear.\"    \"Indeed, madam,\" replied the chaplain, \"this is not entirely foreign  to the subject, since in the most ancient part of the building lies  the chamber in question.\"    \"Where apparitions have been seen?\" inquired Edward, eagerly.    \"Not exactly,\" replied the Baroness; \"there is nothing fearful to be  seen.\"    \"Come, let us tell him at once,\" interrupted the Baron. \"The fact is,  that every guest who sleeps for the first time in this room (and it  has fallen to the lot of many, in turn, to do so,) is visited by some  important, significant dream or vision, or whatever I ought to call  it, in which some future event is prefigured to him, or some past  mystery cleared up, which he had vainly striven to comprehend before.\"    \"Then,\" interposed Edward, \"it must be something like what is known  in the Highlands, under the name of second sight, a privilege, as some  consider it, which several persons and several families enjoy.\"    \"Just so,\" said the physician, \"the cases are very similar; yet the  most mysterious part of this affair is, that it does not appear to  originate with the individual, or his organization, or his sympathy  with beings of the invisible world; no, the individual has nothing to  say to it--the locality does it all. Every one who sleeps there has  his mysterious dream, and the result proves its truth.\"    \"At least, in most instances,\" continued the Baron, \"when we have had  an opportunity of hearing the cases confirmed. I remember once, in  particular. You may recollect, Lieutenant, that when you first came  in, I had the honor of telling you you were not quite a stranger to  me.\"    \"Certainly, Baron; and I have been wishing for a long "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13650"],[0,"Nonsense Books (#17)"],[1,"      In a hollow rounded space it ended          With a luminous Lamp within suspended,              All fenced about              With a bandage stout              To prevent the wind from blowing it out;          And with holes all round to send the light          In gleaming rays on the dismal night        And now each night, and all night long,      Over those plains still roams the Dong;      And above the wail of the Chimp and Snipe      You may hear the squeak of his plaintive pipe,      While ever he seeks, but seeks in vain,      To meet with his Jumbly Girl again;      Lonely and wild, all night he goes,--      The Dong with a luminous Nose!      And all who watch at the midnight hour,      From Hall or Terrace or lofty Tower,      Cry, as they trace the Meteor bright,      Moving along through the dreary night,--         \"This is the hour when forth he goes,          The Dong with a luminous Nose!          Yonder, over the plain he goes,--              He goes!              He goes,--          The Dong with a luminous Nose!\"          THE TWO OLD BACHELORS.    [Illustration]    Two old Bachelors were living in one house;  One caught a Muffin, the other caught a Mouse.  Said he who caught the Muffin to him who caught the Mouse,--  \"This happens just in time! For we've nothing in the house,  Save a tiny slice of lemon and a teaspoonful of honey,  And what to do for dinner--since we haven't any money?  And what can we expect if we haven't any dinner,  But to lose our teeth and eyelashes and keep on growing thinner?\"    Said he who caught the Mouse to him who caught the Muffin,--  \"We might cook this little Mouse, if we only had some Stuffin'!  If we had but Sage and Onion we could do extremely well;  But how to get that Stuffin' it is difficult to tell!\"    Those two old Bachelors ran quickly to the town  And asked for Sage and Onion as they wandered up and down;  They borrowed two large Onions, but no Sage was to be found  In the Shops, or in the Market, or in all the Gardens round.    But some one said, \"A hill there is, a little to the north,  And to its purpledicular top a narrow way leads forth;  And there among the rugged rocks abides an ancient Sage,--  An earnest Man, who reads all day a most perplexing page.  Climb up, and seize him by the toes,--all studious as he sits,--  And pull him down, and chop him into endless little bits!  Then mix him with your Onion (cut up likewise into Scraps),--  When your Stuffin' will be ready, and very good--perhaps.\"    Those two old Bachelors without loss of time  The nearly purpledicular crags at once began to climb;  And at the top, among the rocks, all seated in a nook,  They saw that Sage a-reading of a most enormous book.    \"You earnest Sage!\" aloud they cried, \"your book you've read enough in!  We wish to chop you into bits to mix you into Stuffin'!\"    But that old Sage looked calmly up, and with his awful book,  At those two Bachelors' bald heads a certain aim he took;  And over Crag and precipice they rolled promiscuous down,--  At once they rolled, and never stopped in lane or field or town;  And when they reached their house, they found (besides their want                                                            of Stuffin'),  The Mouse had fled--and, previously, had eaten up the Muffin.    They left their home in silence by the once convivial door;  And from that hour those Bachelors were never heard of more.      [Illustration: Sheet Music--The Pelicans]      [Illustration]      THE PELICAN CHORUS.        King and Queen of the Pelicans we;       No other Birds so grand we see!      None but we have feet like fins!      With lovely leathery throats and chins!          Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!          We think no Birds so happy as we!          Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican Jill!          We think so then, and we thought so still        We live on the Nile. The Nile we love.      By night we sleep on the cliffs above;      By day we fish, and at eve we stand      On long bare islands of yellow sand.      And when the sun sinks slowly down,      And the great rock walls grow dark and brown,        Where the purple river rolls fast and dim      And the Ivory Ibis starlike skim,      Wing to wing we dance around,      Stamping our feet with a flumpy sound,      Opening our mouths as Pelicans ought;      And this is the song we nightly snort,--          Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!          We think no Birds so happy as we!          Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill!          We think so then, and we thought so still!        Last year came out our Daughter Dell,      And all the Birds received her well.      To do her honor a feast we made      For every bird that can swim or wade,--      Herons and Gulls, and Cormorants black,      Cranes, and Flamingoes with scarlet back,      Plovers and Storks, and Geese in clouds,      Swans and Dilberry Ducks in crowds:      Thousands of Birds in wondrous flight!      They ate and drank and danced all night,      And echoing back from the rocks you heard      Multitude-echoes from Bird and Bird,--          Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!          We think no Birds so happy as we!          Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill!          We think so then, and we thought so still!        Yes, they came; and among the rest      The King of the Cranes all grandly dressed.      Such a lovely tail! Its feathers float      Between the ends of his blue dress-coat;      With pea-green trowsers all so neat,      And a delicate frill to hide his feet      (For though no one speaks of it, every one knows      He has got no webs between his toes).        As soon as he saw our Daughter Dell,      In violent love that Crane King fell,--      On seeing her waddling form so fair,      With a wreath of shrimps in her short white hair.      And before the end of the next long day      Our Dell had given her heart away;      For the King of the Cranes had won that heart      With a Crocodile's egg and a large fish-tart.      She vowed to marry the King of the Cranes,      Leaving the Nile for stranger plains;      And away they flew in a gathering crowd      Of endless birds in a lengthening cloud.          Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!          We think no Birds so happy as we!          Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill!          We think so then, and we thought so still!        And far away in the twilight sky      We heard them singing a lessening cry,--      Farther and farther, till out of sight,      And we stood alone in the silent night!      Often since, in the nights of June,      We sit on the sand and watch the moon,--        She has gone to the great Gromboolian Plain,      And we probably never shall meet again!      Oft, in the long still nights of June,      We sit on the rocks and watch the moon,--      She dwells by the streams of the Chankly Bore.      And we probably never shall see her more.          Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!          We think no Birds so happy as we!          Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill!          We think so then, and we thought so still!

[Illustration]                        I.        On the Coast of Coromandel          Where the early pumpkins blow,            In the middle of the woods        Lived the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.      Two old chairs, and half a candle,      One old jug without a handle,--            These were all his worldly goods:            In the middle of the woods,            These were all the worldly goods        Of the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo,        Of the Yonghy-Bonghy Bo.                          II.        Once, among the Bong-trees walking          Where the early pumpkins blow,            To a little heap of stones        Came the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.      There he heard a Lady talking,      To some milk-white Hens of Dorking,--          \"'Tis the Lady Jingly Jones!            On that little heap of stones            Sits the Lady Jingly Jones!\"        Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo,        Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.                          III.       \"Lady Jingly! Lady Jingly!           Sitting where the pumpkins blow,             Will you come and be my wife?\"         Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.     \"I am tired of living singly--      On this coast so wild and shingly,--            I'm a-weary of my life;            If you'll come and be my wife,            Quite serene would be my life!\"        Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo,        Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.                          IV.        \"On this Coast of Coromandel           Shrimps and watercresses grow,             Prawns are plentiful and cheap,\"         Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.     \"You shall have my chairs and candle,      And my jug without a handle!            Gaze upon the rolling deep           (Fish is plentiful and cheap);            As the sea, my love is deep!\"        Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo,        Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.                          V.        Lady Jingly answered sadly,           And her tears began to flow,--            \"Your proposal comes too late,         Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo!      I would be your wife most gladly!\"      (Here she twirled her fingers madly,)           \"But in England I've a mate!            Yes! you've asked me far too late,            For in England I've a mate,        Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo!        Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo!                          VI.       \"Mr. Jones (his name is Handel,--           Handel Jones, Esquire, & Co.)             Dorking fowls delights to send,         Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo!      Keep, oh, keep your chairs and candle,      And your jug without a handle,--            I can merely be your friend!            Should my Jones more Dorkings send,            I will give you"]]]
