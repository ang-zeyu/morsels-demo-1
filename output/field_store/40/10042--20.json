[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8567"],[0,"The Iroquois Book of Rites (#16)"],[1,"of the Iroquois,  who, as Mr. Parkman well observes, is an \"Indian of the Indians,\"  represents him as a sanguinary, treacherous and vindictive being,  somewhat cold in his affections, haughty and reserved toward his  friends, merciless to his enemies, fond of strife, and averse to  industry and the pursuits of peace. Some magnanimous traits are  occasionally allowed to him; and poetry and romance have sometimes  thrown a glamour about his character, which popular opinion, not without  reason, energetically repudiates and resents. The truth is that the  circumstances under which the red and white races have encountered in  North America have been such as necessarily to give rise to a wholly  false impression in regard to the character of the aborigines. The  European colonists, superior in civilization and in the arts of war,  landed on the coast with the deliberate intention of taking possession  of the country and displacing the natives. The Indians were at once  thrown on the defensive. From the very beginning they fought, not merely  for their land, but for their lives; for it was from their land that  they drew the means of living. All wars between the whites and the  Indians, whatever the color or pretence on either side, have been on  both sides wars of extermination. They have been carried on as such wars  always have been and always will be carried on. On the side of the  stronger there have been constant encroachments, effected now by menace  and now by cajolery, but always prefaced by the display and the  insolence of superior power. On the side of the weaker there have been  alternations of sullen acquiescence and of fierce and fruitless  resistance. It is not surprising that under such circumstances the  character of each party has been presented to the other in the most  forbidding light.    The Indians must be judged, like every other people, not by the traits  which they display in the fury of a desperate warfare, but by their  ordinary demeanor in time of peace, and especially by the character of  their social and domestic life. On this point the testimony of  missionaries and of other competent observers who have lived among them  is uniform. At home the Indians are the most kindly and generous of men.  Constant good humor, unfailing courtesy, ready sympathy with distress,  and a truly lavish liberality, mark their intercourse with one another.  The Jesuit missionaries among the Hurons knew them before intercourse  with the whites and the use of ardent spirits had embittered and debased  them. The testimony which they have left on record is very remarkable.  The missionary Brebeuf, protesting against the ignorant prejudice which  would place the Indians on a level with the brutes, gives the result of  his observation in emphatic terms. \"In my opinion,\" he writes, \"it is no  small matter to say of them that they live united in towns, sometimes of  fifty, sixty, or a hundred dwellings, that is, of three or four hundred  households; that they cultivate the fields, from which they derive their  food for the whole year; and that they maintain peace and friendship  with one another.\" He doubts \"if there is another nation under heaven  more commendable in this respect\" than the Huron \"nation of the Bear,\"  among whom he resided. \"They have,\" he declares, \"a gentleness and an  affability almost incredible for barbarians.\" They keep up \"this perfect  goodwill,\" as he terms it, \"by frequent visits, by the aid which they  give one another in sickness, and by their festivals and social  gatherings, whenever they are not occupied by their fields and  fisheries, or in hunting or trade.\" \"They are,\" he continues, \"less in  their own cabins than in those of their friends. If any one falls sick,  and wants something which may benefit him, everybody is eager to furnish  it. Whenever one of them has something specially good to eat, he invites  his friends and makes a feast. Indeed, they hardly ever eat alone.\"  [Footnote: _Relation_ for 1636, p. 117.]    The Iroquois, who had seemed little better than demons to the  missionaries while they knew them only as enemies to the French or their  Huron allies, astonished them, on a nearer acquaintance, by the  development of similar traits of natural goodness. \"You will find in  them,\" declares one of these fair-minded and cultivated observers,  \"virtues which might well put to blush the majority of Christians. There  is no need of hospitals among them, because there are no beggars among  them, and indeed, none who are poor, so long as any of them are rich.  Their kindness, humanity and courtesy not merely make them liberal in  giving, but almost lead them to live as though everything they possess  were held in common. No one can want food while there is corn anywhere  in the town.\" It is true that the missionaries often accuse the Iroquois  of cruelty and perfidy; but the narrative shows that these qualities  were only displayed in their wars, and apparently only against enemies  whose cruelty and perfidy they had experienced.    We can now see that the plan of universal federation and general peace  which Hiawatha devised had nothing in itself so surprising as to excite  our incredulity. It was, indeed, entirely in accordance with the genius  of his people. Its essence was the extension to all nations of the  methods of social and civil life which prevailed in his own nation. If  the people of a town of four hundred families could live in constant  \"peace and friendship,\" why should not all the tribes of men dwell  together in the same manner? The idea is one which might readily have  occurred to any man of benevolent feelings and thoughtful temperament.  The project in itself is not so remarkable as the energy and skill with  which it was carried into effect. It is deserving of notice, however,  that according to the Indian tradition, Hiawatha was impelled to action  mainly by experience of the mischiefs which were caused in his own  nation through a departure from their ordinary system of social life.  The missionaries, in describing the general harmony which prevailed  among the Hurons, admit that it was sometimes disturbed. There were \"bad  spirits\" among them, as everywhere else, who could not always be  controlled. [Footnote: _Relation of 1636_, p. 118: \"Ostez quelques  mauvais esprits, qui se rencontrent quasi partout,\" etc.] Atotarho,  among the Onondagas, was one of these bad spirits; and in his case,  unfortunately, an evil disposition was reinforced by a keen intellect  and a powerful will. His history for a time offered a rare instance of  something approaching to despotism, or the Greek \"tyranny,\" exercised in  an Indian tribe. A fact so strange, and conduct so extraordinary, seemed  in after-times to require explanation. A legend is preserved among the  Onondagas, which was apparently devised to account for a prodigy so far  out of the common order of events. I give it in the words in which it is  recorded in my journal. [Footnote: This story was related to me in  March, 1882, by my intelligent friend, Chief John Buck, who was inclined  to give it credence,--sharing in this, as in other things, the  sentiments of the best among his people.]    \"Another legend, of which I have not before heard, professed to give the  origin both of the abnormal ferocity and of the preterhuman powers of  Atotarho. He was already noted as a chief and a warrior, when he had the  misfortune to kill a peculiar bird, resembling a sea-gull, which is  reputed to possess poisonous qualities of singular virulence. By his  contact with the dead bird his mind was affected. He became morose and  cruel, and at the same time obtained the power of destroying men and  other creatures at a distance. Three sons of Hiawatha were among his  victims. He attended the Councils which were held, and made confusion in  them, and brought all the people into disturbance and terror. His bodily  appearance was changed at the same time, and his aspect became so  terrible that the story spread, and was believed, that his head was  encircled by living snakes.\"    The only importance of this story is in the evidence it affords that  conduct so anti-social as that of Atotarho was deemed to be the result  of a disordered mind. In his case, as in that of the Scottish tyrant and  murderer, \"the insane root that took the reason prisoner,\" was doubtless  an unbridled ambition. It is interesting to remark that even his fierce  temper and determined will were forced to yield at last to the pressure  of public opinion, which compelled him to range himself on the side of  peace and union. In the whimsical imagery of the narrative, which some  of the story-tellers, after their usual fashion, have converted from a  metaphor to a fact, Hiawatha \"combed the snakes out of the head\" of his  great antagonist, and presented him to the Council changed and restored  to his right mind.          CHAPTER IX.    THE IROQUOIS POLICY.      Few popular notions, it may be affirmed, are so far from the truth as  that which makes the Iroquois a band of treacherous and ferocious  ravagers, whose career was marked everywhere by cruelty and devastation.  The clear and positive evidence of historical facts leads to a widely  different conclusion. It is not going too far to assert that among all  uncivilized races the Iroquois have shown themselves to be the most  faithful of allies, the most placable of enemies, and the most clement  of conquerors. It will be proper, in justice to them, as well as in the  interest of political and social science, to present briefly the  principles and methods which guided them in their intercourse with other  communities. Their system, as finally developed, comprised four distinct  forms of connection with other nations, all tending directly to the  establishment of universal peace.    1. As has been already said, the primary object of the founders of their  League was the creation of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8599"],[0,"Fairy Tales from the Arabian Nights (#16)"],[1,"recovery  of the princess his niece, whom he loved as if she had been his own  daughter, and who had been given over by the physicians. After the  usual compliments, the princes presented each the curiosity which  he had brought: Prince Houssain his carpet, which he had taken care  not to leave behind him in the princess's chamber; Prince Ali his  ivory tube, and Prince Ahmed the artificial apple; and after each  had commended his present, when they put it into the sultan's  hands, they begged him to pronounce their fate, and declare to  which of them he would give the Princess Nouronnihar for a wife,  according to his promise.    The Sultan of the Indies having kindly heard all that the princes  had to say, without interrupting them, and being well informed of  what had happened in relation to the Princess Nouronnihar's cure,  remained some time silent, as if he were thinking what answer he  should make. At last he broke silence, and said to them in terms  full of wisdom, 'I would declare for one of you, my children, with  a great deal of pleasure, if I could do so with justice; but  consider whether I can. It is true, Prince Ahmed, the princess my  niece is obliged to your artificial apple for her cure, but let me  ask you, whether you could have been so serviceable to her if you  had not known by Prince Ali's tube the danger she was in, and if  Prince Houssain's carpet had not brought you to her so soon?    'Your tube, Prince Ali, informed you and your brothers that you  were likely to lose the princess your cousin, and so far she is  greatly obliged to you. You must also grant that that knowledge  would have been of no service without the artificial apple and the  carpet.    'And for you, Prince Houssain, consider that it would have been of  little use if you had not been acquainted with the princess's  illness by Prince Ali's tube, and Prince Ahmed had not applied his  artificial apple. Therefore, as neither the carpet, the ivory tube,  nor the artificial apple has the least preference one over the  other, but, on the contrary, there is a perfect equality, I cannot  grant the princess to any one of you, and the only fruit you have  reaped from your travels is the glory of having equally contributed  to restore her to health.    'If this be true,' added the sultan, 'you see that I must have  recourse to other means to determine with certainty in the choice I  ought to make among you, and as there is time enough between this  and night, I will do it to-day. Go, and get each of you a bow and  arrow, and repair to the great plain outside the city, where the  horses are exercised. I will soon come to you, and I declare I will  give the Princess Nouronnihar to him that shoots the farthest.    'I do not, however, forget to thank you all in general, and each in  particular, for the presents you brought me. I have a great many  rarities in my museum already, but nothing that comes up to the  carpet, the ivory tube, and the artificial apple, which shall have  the first place among them, and shall be preserved carefully, not  only for show, but to make an advantageous use of them upon all  occasions.'    The three princes had nothing to say against the decision of the  sultan. When they were out of his presence, they each provided  themselves with a bow and arrow, which they delivered to one of  their officers, and went to the plain appointed, followed by a  great concourse of people.    The sultan did not make them wait long; and as soon as he arrived,  Prince Houssain, as the eldest, took his bow and arrow, and shot  first. Prince Ali shot next, and much beyond him; and Prince Ahmed  last of all; but it so happened, that nobody could see where his  arrow fell; and, notwithstanding all the search of himself and  everybody else, it was not to be found far or near. And though it  was believed that he shot the farthest, and that he therefore  deserved the Princess Nouronnihar, it was necessary that his arrow  should be found, to make the matter evident and certain; so,  notwithstanding his remonstrances, the sultan determined in favour  of Prince Ali, and gave orders for preparations to be made for the  wedding, which was celebrated a few days afterwards with great  magnificence.                                PRINCE AHMED AND THE FAIRY.        Prince Houssain would not honour the feast with his presence; he  could scarcely endure to see the princess in the arms of Prince  Ali, who, he said, did not deserve her better or love her more than  himself. He left the court, and, renouncing all right of succession  to the crown, turned dervish, and put himself under the discipline  of a famous sheik, who had gained a reputation for his exemplary  life, and had taken up his abode, together with his disciples,  whose number was great, in an agreeable solitude.    Prince Ahmed did not assist at Prince Ali's and the Princess  Nouronnihar's wedding, any more than his brother Houssain, but did  not renounce the world as he had done. He could not imagine what  had become of his arrow, so he stole away from his attendants, and  resolved to search for it, that he might not have anything to  reproach himself with. With this intention, he went to the place  where the Princes Houssain's and Ali's were gathered up, and going  straight forward from thence, looked carefully on both sides of  him. He went so far, that at last he began to think his labour was  in vain; yet he could not help going forwards, till he came to some  steep, craggy rocks, which would have obliged him to return, had he  been ever so anxious to proceed. They were situated in a barren  country, about four leagues distant from whence he set out. When  Prince Ahmed came near these rocks, he perceived an arrow, which he  picked up, looked earnestly at it, and was in the greatest  astonishment to find it was the same he shot. 'Certainly,' said he  to himself, 'neither I nor any man living could shoot an arrow so  far'; and finding it laid flat, not sticking into the ground, he  judged that it had rebounded from the rock. 'There must be some  mystery in this,' said he to himself again, 'and it may be to my  advantage. Perhaps fortune, to make me amends for depriving me of  what I thought the greatest happiness of my life, may have reserved  a greater blessing for my comfort.' As these rocks were full of  sharp points and crevices between them, the prince, full of these  thoughts, entered a cavity, and looking about, cast his eyes on an  iron door, which seemed to have no lock. He feared it was fastened;  but pushing against it, it opened, and discovered an easy descent,  but no steps. He walked down with his arrow in his hand. At first  he thought he was going into a dark place, but presently a quite  different light succeeded that which he had come out of. Coming  upon a spacious square, fifty or sixty paces distant, he perceived  a magnificent palace; but he had not time to look at it, for at the  same moment a lady of majestic air, and of a beauty to which the  richness of her clothes and the jewels which adorned her person  added nothing, advanced as far as the porch, attended by a troop of  ladies, of whom it was difficult to distinguish which was the  mistress.    As soon as Prince Ahmed perceived the lady, he hastened to pay his  respects; and the lady, on her part, seeing him coming, was  beforehand with him. Raising her voice, she said, 'Come near,  Prince Ahmed; you are welcome.'    It was no small surprise to the prince to hear himself named in a  palace he had never heard of, though so near his father's capital,  and he could not comprehend how he should be known to a lady who  was a stranger to him. At last he returned the lady's salutation,  by throwing himself at her feet, and rising up again, said to her,  'Madam, I return you a thousand thanks for welcoming me to a place  where I had reason to believe my imprudent curiosity had made me  penetrate too far. But, madam, may I, without being guilty of  rudeness, presume to ask you how you know me? and why you, who live  in the same neighbourhood should be so little known by me?'    'Prince,' said the lady, 'let us go into the hall; there I will  gratify your request.'    After these words, the lady led Prince Ahmed into the hall, the  noble structure of which, and the gold and azure which embellished  the dome, and the inestimable richness of the furniture, appeared  to him so wonderful that he had never in his life beheld anything  like it, and believed that nothing was to be compared to it. 'I can  assure you,' replied the lady, 'that this is but a small part of my  palace, and you will say so when you have seen all the apartments.'  Then she sat down on a sofa; and when the prince at her entreaty  had seated himself, she said, 'You are surprised, you say, that I  should know you, and not be known by you; but you will no longer be  surprised when I inform you who I am. You cannot be ignorant that  the world is inhabited by genies as well as men: I am the daughter  of one of the most powerful and distinguished of these genies, and  my name is Pari Banou: therefore I know you, the sultan your  father, the princes your brothers, and the Princess Nouronnihar. I  am no stranger to your love or your travels, of which I could tell  you all the circumstances, since it was I myself who exposed for  sale the artificial apple which you bought at Samarcand, the carpet  which Prince Houssain met with at Bisnagar, and the tube which  Prince Ali brought from Schiraz. This is sufficient to let you know  that I am not unacquainted with anything that relates to you. The  only thing I have to add is, that you seemed to me worthy of a  still better fortune than that of marrying the Princess  Nouronnihar. I was present when you drew your arrow, and foresaw it  would not go beyond Prince Houssain's. I took it in the air, and  made it strike against the rocks near which you found it. It is in  your power to avail yourself"]]]
