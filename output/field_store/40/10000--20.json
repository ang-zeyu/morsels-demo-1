Let us consider the point. What is negatived in that judgment  is not the knowing 'I' itself, but merely the distinctions of caste,  condition of life, &c. which belong to the 'I' at the time of waking. We  must distinguish the objects of the several parts of the judgment under  discussion. The object of the '(me) myself' is the 'I' distinguished by  class characteristics as it presents itself in the waking state; the  object of the word 'I' (in the judgment) is that 'I' which consists of a  uniform flow of self-consciousness which persists in sleep also, but is  then not quite distinct. The judgment 'I did not know myself' therefore  means that the sleeper was not conscious of the place where he slept, of  his special characteristics, and so on.--It is, moreover, your own view  that in deep sleep the Self occupies the position of a witnessing  principle with regard to Nescience. But by a witness (sâkshin) we  understand some one who knows about something by personal observation  (sâkshât); a person who does not know cannot be a witness. Accordingly,  in scripture as well as in ordinary language a knowing subject only, not  mere knowledge, is spoken of as a witness; and with this the Reverend  Pânini also agrees when teaching that the word 'sâkshin' means one who  knows in person (Pâ. Sû. V, 2, 91). Now this witness is nothing else but  the 'I' which is apprehended in the judgment 'I know'; and how then  should this 'I' not be apprehended in the state of sleep? That which  itself appears to the Self appears as the 'I,' and it thus follows that  also in deep sleep and similar states the Self which then shines forth  appears as the 'I.'    [FOOTNOTE 68:1. I. e. the reflection as to the perception of pleasure  refers to the past state of sleep only, not to the present moment of  reflection.]          The conscious subject persists in the state of release.    To maintain that the consciousness of the 'I' does not persist in the  state of final release is again altogether inappropriate. It in fact  amounts to the doctrine--only expressed in somewhat different words--  that final release is the annihilation of the Self. The 'I' is not a  mere attribute of the Self so that even after its destruction the  essential nature of the Self might persist--as it persists on the  cessation of ignorance; but it constitutes the very nature of the Self.  Such judgments as 'I know', 'Knowledge has arisen in me', show, on the  other hand, that we are conscious of knowledge as a mere attribute of  the Self.--Moreover, a man who suffering pain, mental or of other kind--  whether such pain be real or due to error only--puts himself in relation  to pain--'I am suffering pain'--naturally begins to reflect how he may  once for all free himself from all these manifold afflictions and enjoy  a state of untroubled ease; the desire of final release thus having  arisen in him he at once sets to work to accomplish it. If, on the other  hand, he were to realise that the effect of such activity would be the  loss of personal existence, he surely would turn away as soon as  somebody began to tell him about 'release'. And the result of this would  be that, in the absence of willing and qualified pupils, the whole  scriptural teaching as to final release would lose its authoritative  character.--Nor must you maintain against this that even in the state of  release there persists pure consciousness; for this by no means improves  your case. No sensible person exerts himself under the influence of the  idea that after he himself has perished there will remain some entity  termed 'pure light!'--What constitutes the 'inward' Self thus is the 'I',  the knowing subject.    This 'inward' Self shines forth in the state of final release also as an  'I'; for it appears to itself. The general principle is that whatever  being appears to itself appears as an 'I'; both parties in the present  dispute establish the existence of the transmigrating Self on such  appearance. On the contrary, whatever does not appear as an 'I', does  not appear to itself; as jars and the like. Now the emancipated Self  does thus appear to itself, and therefore it appears as an 'I'. Nor does  this appearance as an 'I' imply in any way that the released Self is  subject to Nescience and implicated in the Samsâra; for this would  contradict the nature of final release, and moreover the consciousness  of the 'I' cannot be the cause of Nescience and so on. Nescience  (ignorance) is either ignorance as to essential nature, or the cognition  of something under an aspect different from the real one (as when a  person suffering from jaundice sees all things yellow); or cognition of  what is altogether opposite in nature (as when mother o' pearl is  mistaken for silver). Now the 'I' constitutes the essential nature of  the Self; how then can the consciousness of the 'I,' i.e. the  consciousness of its own true nature, implicate the released Self in  Nescience, or, in the Samsâra? The fact rather is that such  consciousness destroys Nescience, and so on, because it is essentially  opposed to them. In agreement with this we observe that persons like the  rishi Vâmadeva, in whom the intuition of their identity with Brahman had  totally destroyed all Nescience, enjoyed the consciousness of the  personal 'I'; for scripture says, 'Seeing this the rishi Vâmadeva  understood,_I_ was Manu and the Sun' (Bri. Up. I, 4, 10). And the  highest Brahman also, which is opposed to all other forms of Nescience  and denoted and conceived as pure Being, is spoken of in an analogous  way; cp. 'Let me make each of these three deities,' &c. (Ch. Up. VI, 3,  3); 'May I be many, may I grow forth' (Ch. Up. VI, 2, 3); 'He thought,  shall I send forth worlds?' (Ait. Âr. II, 4, 1, 1); and again, 'Since I  transcend the Destructible, and am higher also than the Indestructible,  therefore I am proclaimed in the world and in the Veda as the highest  Person' (Bha. Gî. XV, 18); 'I am the Self, O Gûdâkesa.' (Bha. Gî. X, 20);  'Never was I not' (Bha. Gî. II, 12); 'I am the source and the  destruction of the whole world' (Bha. Gî. VII, 6); 'I am the source of  all; from me proceeds everything' (Bha. Gî. X, 8); 'I am he who raises  them from the ocean of the world of death' (Bha. Gî. XII, 7); 'I am the  giver of seed, the father' (Bha. Gî. XIV, 4); 'I know the things past'  (Bha. Gî. VII, 26).--But if the 'I' (aham) constitutes the essential  nature of the Self, how is it that the Holy One teaches the principle of  egoity (ahamkâra) to belong to the sphere of objects, 'The great  elements, the ahamkâra, the understanding (buddhi), and the Unevolved'  (Bha. Gî. XIII, 5)?--As in all passages, we reply, which give  information about the true nature of the Self it is spoken of as the 'I',  we conclude that the 'I' constitutes the essential nature of the inward  Self. Where, on the other hand, the Holy One declares the ahamkâra--a  special effect of the Unevolved--to be comprised within the sphere of  the Objective, he means that principle which is called ahamkâra, because  it causes the assumption of Egoity on the part of the body which belongs  to the Not-self. Such egoity constitutes the ahamkâra also designated as  pride or arrogance, which causes men to slight persons superior to  themselves, and is referred to by scripture in many places as something  evil. Such consciousness of the 'I' therefore as is not sublated by  anything else has the Self for its object; while, on the other hand,  such consciousness of the 'I' as has the body for its object is mere  Nescience. In agreement with this the Reverend Parâsara has said, 'Hear  from me the essential nature of Nescience; it is the attribution of  Selfhood to what is not the Self.' If the Self were pure consciousness  then pure consciousness only, and not the quality of being a knowing  subject, would present itself in the body also, which is a Not-self  wrongly imagined to be a Self. The conclusion therefore remains that the  Self is nothing but the knowing 'I'. Thus it has been said, 'As is  proved by perception, and as also results from reasoning and tradition,  and from its connexion with ignorance, the Self presents itself as a  knowing 'I'. And again,'That which is different from body, senses, mind,  and vital airs; which does not depend on other means; which is permanent,  pervading, divided according to bodies-that is the Self blessed in  itself.' Here 'not dependent on other means' means 'self-luminous'; and  'pervading' means 'being of such a nature as to enter, owing to  excessive minuteness, into all non-sentient things.'          In cases of Scripture conflicting with Perception, Scripture is not  stronger. The True cannot be known through the Untrue.    With reference to the assertion (p. 24 ff.) that Perception, which  depends on the view of plurality, is based on some defect and hence  admits of being otherwise accounted for--whence it follows that it is  sublated by Scripture; we ask you to point out what defect it is on  which Perception is based and may hence be accounted for otherwise.--'  The beginningless imagination of difference' we expect you to reply.--  But, we ask in return, have you then come to know by some other means  that this beginningless imagination of difference, acting in a manner  analogous to that of certain defects of vision, is really the cause of  an altogether perverse view of things?--If you reply that this is known  just from the fact that Perception is in conflict with Scripture, we  point out that you are reasoning in a circle: you prove the  defectiveness of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/73"],[0,"The Red Badge of Courage: An Episode of the American Civil War (#16)"],[1,"ghtin'.  Awful time.  I  don't see how I could a' got separated from th' reg'ment.  I got shot,  too.\"    His friend had stepped forward quickly.  \"What?  Got shot?  Why didn't  yeh say so first?  Poor ol' boy, we must--hol' on a minnit; what am I  doin'.  I'll call Simpson.\"    Another figure at that moment loomed in the gloom.  They could see that  it was the corporal.  \"Who yeh talkin' to, Wilson?\" he demanded.  His  voice was anger-toned.  \"Who yeh talkin' to?  Yeh th' derndest  sentinel--why--hello, Henry, you here?  Why, I thought you was dead  four hours ago!  Great Jerusalem, they keep turnin' up every ten  minutes or so!  We thought we'd lost forty-two men by straight count,  but if they keep on a-comin' this way, we'll git th' comp'ny all back  by mornin' yit.  Where was yeh?\"    \"Over on th' right.  I got separated\"--began the youth with  considerable glibness.    But his friend had interrupted hastily.  \"Yes, an' he got shot in th'  head an' he's in a fix, an' we must see t' him right away.\" He rested  his rifle in the hollow of his left arm and his right around the  youth's shoulder.    \"Gee, it must hurt like thunder!\" he said.    The youth leaned heavily upon his friend.  \"Yes, it hurts--hurts a good  deal,\" he replied.  There was a faltering in his voice.    \"Oh,\" said the corporal.  He linked his arm in the youth's and drew him  forward.  \"Come on, Henry.  I'll take keer 'a yeh.\"    As they went on together the loud private called out after them: \"Put  'im t' sleep in my blanket, Simpson.  An'--hol' on a minnit--here's my  canteen.  It's full 'a coffee.  Look at his head by th' fire an' see  how it looks.  Maybe it's a pretty bad un.  When I git relieved in a  couple 'a minnits, I'll be over an' see t' him.\"    The youth's senses were so deadened that his friend's voice sounded  from afar and he could scarcely feel the pressure of the corporal's  arm.  He submitted passively to the latter's directing strength.  His  head was in the old manner hanging forward upon his breast.  His knees  wobbled.    The corporal led him into the glare of the fire.  \"Now, Henry,\" he  said, \"let's have look at yer ol' head.\"    The youth sat obediently and the corporal, laying aside his rifle,  began to fumble in the bushy hair of his comrade.  He was obliged to  turn the other's head so that the full flush of the fire light would  beam upon it.  He puckered his mouth with a critical air.  He drew back  his lips and whistled through his teeth when his fingers came in  contact with the splashed blood and the rare wound.    \"Ah, here we are!\" he said.  He awkwardly made further investigations.  \"Jest as I thought,\" he added, presently.  \"Yeh've been grazed by a  ball.  It's raised a queer lump jest as if some feller had lammed yeh  on th' head with a club.  It stopped a-bleedin' long time ago.  Th'  most about it is that in th' mornin' yeh'll fell that a number ten hat  wouldn't fit yeh.  An' your head'll be all het up an' feel as dry as  burnt pork.  An' yeh may git a lot 'a other sicknesses, too, by  mornin'.  Yeh can't never tell.  Still, I don't much think so.  It's  jest a damn' good belt on th' head, an' nothin' more.  Now, you jest  sit here an' don't move, while I go rout out th' relief.  Then I'll  send Wilson t' take keer 'a yeh.\"    The corporal went away.  The youth remained on the ground like a  parcel.  He stared with a vacant look into the fire.    After a time he aroused, for some part, and the things about him began  to take form.  He saw that the ground in the deep shadows was cluttered  with men, sprawling in every conceivable posture.  Glancing narrowly  into the more distant darkness, he caught occasional glimpses of  visages that loomed pallid and ghostly, lit with a phosphorescent glow.  These faces expressed in their lines the deep stupor of the tired  soldiers.  They made them appear like men drunk with wine.  This bit of  forest might have appeared to an ethereal wanderer as a scene of the  result of some frightful debauch.    On the other side of the fire the youth observed an officer asleep,  seated bolt upright, with his back against a tree.  There was something  perilous in his position.  Badgered by dreams, perhaps, he swayed with  little bounces and starts, like an old, toddy-stricken grandfather in a  chimney corner.  Dust and stains were upon his face.  His lower jaw  hung down as if lacking strength to assume its normal position.  He was  the picture of an exhausted soldier after a feast of war.    He had evidently gone to sleep with his sword in his arms.  These two  had slumbered in an embrace, but the weapon had been allowed in time to  fall unheeded to the ground.  The brass-mounted hilt lay in contact  with some parts of the fire.    Within the gleam of rose and orange light from the burning sticks were  other soldiers, snoring and heaving, or lying deathlike in slumber.  A  few pairs of legs were stuck forth, rigid and straight.  The shoes  displayed the mud or dust of marches and bits of rounded trousers,  protruding from the blankets, showed rents and tears from hurried  pitchings through the dense brambles.    The fire cackled musically.  From it swelled light smoke.  Overhead the  foliage moved softly.  The leaves, with their faces turned toward the  blaze, were colored shifting hues of silver, often edged with red.  Far  off to the right, through a window in the forest could be seen a  handful of stars lying, like glittering pebbles, on the black level of  the night.    Occasionally, in this low-arched hall, a soldier would arouse and turn  his body to a new position, the experience of his sleep having taught  him of uneven and objectionable places upon the ground under him.  Or,  perhaps, he would lift himself to a sitting posture, blink at the fire  for an unintelligent moment, throw a swift glance at his prostrate  companion, and then cuddle down again with a grunt of sleepy content.    The youth sat in a forlorn heap until his friend the loud young soldier  came, swinging two canteens by their light strings.  \"Well, now, Henry,  ol' boy,\" said the latter, \"we'll have yeh fixed up in jest about a  minnit.\"    He had the bustling ways of an amateur nurse.  He fussed around the  fire and stirred the sticks to brilliant exertions.  He made his  patient drink largely from the canteen that contained the coffee.  It  was to the youth a delicious draught.  He tilted his head afar back and  held the canteen long to his lips.  The cool mixture went caressingly  down his blistered throat.  Having finished, he sighed with comfortable  delight.    The loud young soldier watched his comrade with an air of satisfaction.  He later produced an extensive handkerchief from his pocket.  He folded  it into a manner of bandage and soused water from the other canteen  upon the middle of it.  This crude arrangement he bound over the  youth's head, tying the ends in a queer knot at the back of the neck.    \"There,\" he said, moving off and surveying his deed, \"yeh look like th'  devil, but I bet yeh feel better.\"    The youth contemplated his friend with grateful eyes.  Upon his aching  and swelling head the cold cloth was like a tender woman's hand.    \"Yeh don't holler ner say nothin',\" remarked his friend approvingly.  \"I know I'm a blacksmith at takin' keer 'a sick folks, an' yeh never  squeaked.  Yer a good un, Henry.  Most 'a men would a' been in th'  hospital long ago.  A shot in th' head ain't foolin' business.\"    The youth made no reply, but began to fumble with the buttons of his  jacket.    \"Well, come, now,\" continued his friend, \"come on.  I must put yeh t'  bed an' see that yeh git a good night's rest.\"    The other got carefully erect, and the loud young soldier led him among  the sleeping forms lying in groups and rows.  Presently he stooped and  picked up his blankets.  He spread the rubber one upon the ground and  placed the woolen one about the youth's shoulders.    \"There now,\" he said, \"lie down an' git some sleep.\"    The youth, with his manner of doglike obedience, got carefully down  like a crone stooping.  He stretched out with a murmur of relief and  comfort.  The ground felt like the softest couch.    But of a sudden he ejaculated:  \"Hol' on a minnit!  Where you goin' t'  sleep?\"    His friend waved his hand impatiently.  \"Right down there by yeh.\"    \"Well, but hol' on a minnit,\" continued the youth.  \"What yeh goin' t'  sleep in?  I've got your--\"    The loud young soldier snarled:  \"Shet up an' go on t' sleep.  Don't be  makin' a damn' fool 'a yerself,\" he said severely.    After the reproof the youth said no more.  An exquisite drowsiness had  spread through him.  The warm comfort of the blanket enveloped him and  made a gentle langour.  His head fell forward on his crooked arm and  his weighted lids went softly down over his eyes.  Hearing a splatter  of musketry from the distance, he wondered indifferently if those men  sometimes slept.  He gave a long sigh, snuggled down into his blanket,  and in a moment was like his comrades.          Chapter 14      When the youth awoke it seemed to him that he had been asleep for a  thousand years, and he felt sure that he opened his eyes upon an  unexpected world.  Gray mists were slowly shifting before the first  efforts of the sun rays.  An impending splendor could be seen in the  eastern sky.  An icy dew had chilled his face, and immediately upon  arousing he curled farther down into his blanket.  He stared for a  while at the leaves overhead, moving in a heraldic wind of the day.    The distance was splintering and blaring with the noise of fighting.  There was in the sound an expression of a deadly persistency, as if it  had not began and was not to cease.    About him were the rows and groups of men that he had dimly seen the  previous night.  They were getting a last draught of sleep before the  awakening.  The gaunt, careworn features and dusty figures were made  plain by this quaint light at the dawning, but "]]]
