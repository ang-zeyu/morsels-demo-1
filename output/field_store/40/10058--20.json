No intimation of danger assailed the dormant  faculties of the ape-man--he saw no crouching hairy figures upon the  ground beneath him nor the three apes that swung quietly into the  tree  beside him.    The first intimation of danger that came to Tarzan was the impact of  three bodies as the three apes leaped upon him and hurled him to the  ground, where he alighted half stunned beneath their combined weight  and was immediately set upon by the fifty hairy men or as many of them  as could swarm upon his person.  Instantly the ape-man became the  center of a whirling, striking, biting maelstrom of horror.  He fought  nobly but the odds against him were too great.  Slowly they overcame  him though there was scarce one of them that did not feel the weight of  his mighty fist or the rending of his fangs.          13    Condemned To Torture and Death      La had followed her company and when she saw them clawing and biting at  Tarzan, she raised her voice and cautioned them not to kill him.  She  saw that he was weakening and that soon the greater numbers would  prevail over him, nor had she long to wait before the mighty jungle  creature lay helpless and bound at her feet.    \"Bring him to the place at which we stopped,\" she commanded and they  carried Tarzan back to the little clearing and threw him down beneath a  tree.    \"Build me a shelter!\" ordered La.  \"We shall stop here tonight and  tomorrow in the face of the Flaming God, La will offer up the heart of  this defiler of the temple.  Where is the sacred knife?  Who took it  from him?\"    But no one had seen it and each was positive in his assurance that the  sacrificial weapon had not been upon Tarzan's person when they captured  him.  The ape-man looked upon the menacing creatures which surrounded  him and snarled his defiance.  He looked upon La and smiled.  In the  face of death he was unafraid.    \"Where is the knife?\" La asked him.    \"I do not know,\" replied Tarzan.  \"The man took it with him when he  slipped away during the night.  Since you are so desirous for its  return I would look for him and get it back for you, did you not hold  me prisoner; but now that I am to die I cannot get it back.  Of what  good was your knife, anyway?  You can make another.  Did you follow us  all this way for nothing more than a knife?  Let me go and find him and  I will bring it back to you.\"    La laughed a bitter laugh, for in her heart she knew that Tarzan's sin  was greater than the purloining of the sacrificial knife of Opar; yet  as she looked at him lying bound and helpless before her, tears rose to  her eyes so that she had to turn away to hide them; but she remained  inflexible in her determination to make him pay in frightful suffering  and in eventual death for daring to spurn the love of La.    When the shelter was completed La had Tarzan transferred to it.  \"All  night I shall torture him,\" she muttered to her priests, \"and at the  first streak of dawn you may prepare the flaming altar upon which his  heart shall be offered up to the Flaming God.  Gather wood well filled  with pitch, lay it in the form and size of the altar at Opar in the  center of the clearing that the Flaming God may look down upon our  handiwork and be pleased.\"    During the balance of the day the priests of Opar were busy erecting an  altar in the center of the clearing, and while they worked they chanted  weird hymns in the ancient tongue of that lost continent that lies at  the bottom of the Atlantic.  They knew not the meanings of the words  they mouthed; they but repeated the ritual that had been handed down  from preceptor to neophyte since that long-gone day when the ancestors  of the Piltdown man still swung by their tails in the humid jungles  that are England now.    And in the shelter of the hut, La paced to and fro beside the stoic  ape-man.  Resigned to his fate was Tarzan.  No hope of succor gleamed  through the dead black of the death sentence hanging over him.  He knew  that his giant muscles could not part the many strands that bound his  wrists and ankles, for he had strained often, but ineffectually for  release.  He had no hope of outside help and only enemies surrounded  him within the camp, and yet he smiled at La as she paced nervously  back and forth the length of the shelter.    And La?  She fingered her knife and looked down upon her captive.  She  glared and muttered but she did not strike.  \"Tonight!\" she thought.  \"Tonight, when it is dark I will torture him.\" She looked upon his  perfect, godlike figure and upon his handsome, smiling face and then  she steeled her heart again by thoughts of her love spurned; by  religious thoughts that damned the infidel who had desecrated the holy  of holies; who had taken from the blood-stained altar of Opar the  offering to the Flaming God--and not once but thrice.  Three times had  Tarzan cheated the god of her fathers.  At the thought La paused and  knelt at his side.  In her hand was a sharp knife.  She placed its  point against the ape-man's side and pressed upon the hilt; but Tarzan  only smiled and shrugged his shoulders.    How beautiful he was!  La bent low over him, looking into his eyes.  How perfect was his figure.  She compared it with those of the knurled  and knotted men from whom she must choose a mate, and La shuddered at  the thought.  Dusk came and after dusk came night.  A great fire blazed  within the little thorn boma about the camp.  The flames played upon  the new altar erected in the center of the clearing, arousing in the  mind of the High Priestess of the Flaming God a picture of the event of  the coming dawn.  She saw this giant and perfect form writhing amid the  flames of the burning pyre.  She saw those smiling lips, burned and  blackened, falling away from the strong, white teeth.  She saw the  shock of black hair tousled upon Tarzan's well-shaped head disappear in  a spurt of flame.  She saw these and many other frightful pictures as  she stood with closed eyes and clenched fists above the object of her  hate--ah!  was it hate that La of Opar felt?    The darkness of the jungle night had settled down upon the camp,  relieved only by the fitful flarings of the fire that was kept up to  warn off the man-eaters.  Tarzan lay quietly in his bonds.  He suffered  from thirst and from the cutting of the tight strands about his wrists  and ankles; but he made no complaint.  A jungle beast was Tarzan with  the stoicism of the beast and the intelligence of man.  He knew that  his doom was sealed--that no supplications would avail to temper the  severity of his end and so he wasted no breath in pleadings; but waited  patiently in the firm conviction that his sufferings could not endure  forever.    In the darkness La stooped above him.  In her hand was a sharp knife  and in her mind the determination to initiate his torture without  further delay.  The knife was pressed against his side and La's face  was close to his when a sudden burst of flame from new branches thrown  upon the fire without, lighted up the interior of the shelter.  Close  beneath her lips La saw the perfect features of the forest god and into  her woman's heart welled all the great love she had felt for Tarzan  since first she had seen him, and all the accumulated passion of the  years that she had dreamed of him.    Dagger in hand, La, the High Priestess, towered above the helpless  creature that had dared to violate the sanctuary of her deity.  There  should be no torture--there should be instant death.  No longer should  the defiler of the temple pollute the sight of the lord god almighty.  A single stroke of the heavy blade and then the corpse to the flaming  pyre without.  The knife arm stiffened ready for the downward plunge,  and then La, the woman, collapsed weakly upon the body of the man she  loved.    She ran her hands in mute caress over his naked flesh; she covered his  forehead, his eyes, his lips with hot kisses; she covered him with her  body as though to protect him from the hideous fate she had ordained  for him, and in trembling, piteous tones she begged him for his love.  For hours the frenzy of her passion possessed the burning hand-maiden  of the Flaming God, until at last sleep overpowered her and she lapsed  into unconsciousness beside the man she had sworn to torture and to  slay.  And Tarzan, untroubled by thoughts of the future, slept  peacefully in La's embrace.    At the first hint of dawn the chanting of the priests of Opar brought  Tarzan to wakefulness.  Initiated in low and subdued tones, the sound  soon rose in volume to the open diapason of barbaric blood lust.  La  stirred.  Her perfect arm pressed Tarzan closer to her--a smile parted  her lips and then she awoke, and slowly the smile faded and her eyes  went wide in horror as the significance of the death chant impinged  upon her understanding.    \"Love me, Tarzan!\" she cried.  \"Love me, and you shall be saved.\"    Tarzan's bonds hurt him.  He was suffering the tortures of  long-restricted circulation.  With an angry growl he rolled over with  his back toward La.  That was her answer!  The High Priestess leaped to  her feet.  A hot flush of shame mantled her cheek and then she went  dead white and stepped to the shelter's entrance.    \"Come, Priests of the Flaming God!\" she cried, \"and make ready the  sacrifice.\"    The warped things advanced and entered the shelter.  They laid hands  upon Tarzan and bore him forth, and as they chanted they kept time with  their crooked bodies, swaying to and fro to the rhythm of their song of  blood and death.  Behind them came La, swaying too; but not in unison  with the chanted cadence.  White and drawn was the face of the High  Priestess--white and drawn with unrequited love and hideous terror of  the moments to come.  Yet stern in her resolve was La.  The infidel  should die!  The scorner of her love should pay the price upon the  fiery altar.  She saw them lay the perfect body there upon "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/926"],[0,"Ten Thousand Dreams Interpreted; Or, What's in a Dream (#16)"],[1,"up hill, signifies bright prospects.
