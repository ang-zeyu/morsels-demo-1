[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12327"],[0,"The Jewish Manual (#17)"],[1,"made by mixing with the cream any kind of small  preserved fruit.           *       *       *       *       *    RICE SOUFLES.    Boil well some fine picked rice, in pure fresh milk, sweeten and  flavour with a bay leaf, lemon peel, and a stick of cinnamon, all  which must be taken out when the rice is done, then line with it  a round dish, or soufle dish, have ready apples previously boiled,  sweetened, and beat up smoothly, place the apple lightly in the centre  rather higher in the middle than at the sides, beat up the whites of  eggs to a froth, sweeten and flavour with lemon, or noyau essence;  place it in small heaps tastefully on the apple and rice, and brown  delicately with a salamander. This soufle may have stewed cherries or  any _other_ kind of fruit, instead of the apples if preferred.           *       *       *       *       *    BOILED CUSTARD.    Take a pint of milk, let it simmer in a very clean saucepan, flavor  it with lemon-peel and a bay leaf, and sweeten to taste; while gently  boiling, add the beaten yolks of four eggs, and the whites of two,  continue stirring until the custard thickens, when it must be removed  from the fire, but it is requisite to stir it until it cools. It is  necessary to strain the milk before the eggs are added, and also to  pass the eggs through a sieve. Custards are flavoured sometimes  with essence of almonds; a little cream added to the milk is a great  improvement. The above mixture may be baked in small cups; they  require a quarter of an hour to bake.           *       *       *       *       *    CALF'S FEET JELLY.    Boil two feet in two quarts, or five pints of water, till the water  has half wasted; strain, and when cold, take off the fat, then put it  in the saucepan with lump sugar, lemon juice, and white wine to taste,  also a little lemon peel; when simmered a few minutes, throw in the  whites of two eggs, and their shells broken, which will have the  effect of clarifying the jelly; let it boil about ten minutes after  the scum rises, then pour it through a flannel bag or thick cloth,  dipping the bag or cloth first into hot water; pass the jelly through  it until clear, then pour it into moulds and put them in a cool place  to set. One calf's foot and one cow heel will be more economical than  two calfs feet. If fruit is desired to be in the jelly, it must be put  in when the jelly begins to stiffen in the mould.           *       *       *       *       *    ORANGE JELLY.    This can be made with calf's feet or without. One quart of water will  require one ounce of isinglass, simmer the isinglass in the water,  and add the peel of one lemon and one orange; when the isinglass is  dissolved, add the juice of a lemon and six fine oranges; although the  quantity must vary according to the season for them, sweeten with half  a pound of white sugar; a Seville orange is added if there should not  be much flavor in the others.    Lemon jelly is made in the same way; the peel of a Seville orange and  of a lemon is used, with the juice of five lemons; rather more sugar  will be required with this jelly than with the former.    Punch jelly is made in the same way. An equal quantity of brandy  and rum, with the juice of two or three lemons is mixed with the  isinglass, which is dissolved in one pint of water, the other pint of  liquid being made up by the lemon juice and spirits.    The essence of noyeau is reckoned to give an exquisite flavor, in this  case it requires to be coloured with a few drops of cochineal.           *       *       *       *       *    AN EASY TRIFLE.    Soak three sponge cakes and half a pound of macaroons and ratafias  in one wine glass of brandy and three of white wine, lay them at the  bottom of the trifle dish, and pour over nearly a pint of thick rich  custard, made of equal portions of milk and cream, with seven eggs,  according to directions for \"Custards;\" before the custard is added,  jam and sweetmeats are sometimes spread over the cakes; a fine light  froth is prepared with cream and the whites of two eggs, flavored with  wine and sugar, heap it over the trifle lightly.           *       *       *       *       *    A STILL MORE SIMPLE ONE, AND QUICKLY MADE.    Soak ratafia cakes in wine, with a little brandy; pour over a thick  custard, and cover with a froth of the white of eggs, flavored with  wine and sweetened with white sugar.           *       *       *       *       *    BLANCMANGE.    To a quart of milk add half an ounce of fine isinglass, a handful  of beaten almonds, and two or three bitter almonds, a couple of bay  leaves, and a piece of lemon peel; when the isinglass is dissolved,  strain the milk into a basin; sweeten with four ounces of white sugar,  and pour into a mould.    The juice of fresh strawberries is a fine addition to blancmange.           *       *       *       *       *    A JUDITHA.    Put some gooseberries into a saucepan with very little water, when  they are soft, pulp them through a sieve, and add several well-beaten  yolks of eggs, and sweeten with white sugar; have ready a shape of  biscuit ice, or any other cream ice that may be preferred, take off a  thick slice of the ice from the top carefully, and without breaking,  so that it may be replaced on the ice. Scoop out a large portion of  the ice which may be mixed with the gooseberry cream, and fill the  hollow with it. Cover the shape with the piece that was removed and  serve. This is an elegant dish, the ice should be prepared in a round  mould--brown-bread ice is particularly well adapted to a Juditha.           *       *       *       *       *    TOURTE A LA CREME.    This is a fashionable and delicate description of tart. A couple of  round cutters about the size of a pie plate are required for it, one  of the cutters must be about two inches smaller than the other, if  they are fluted the tourte will have a better appearance.    Roll out some very rich puff paste to the thickness of one inch, and  cut two pieces with the larger tin cutter, then press the smaller  cutter through one of these pieces, and remove the border which will  be formed round it; this must be laid very evenly upon the other piece  of paste, and slightly pressed to make it adhere; place the tourte in  an oven to bake for about twenty minutes, then let it become cool, but  not cold, and fill it with a fine custard or with any rich preserves;  if the latter, a well whipped cream may be laid lightly over; the  pastry may be glazed if approved.           *       *       *       *       *    THE GROSVENOR PUDDING.    Beat half a pound of butter with the same quantity of white sugar  until it is like cream, then beat up five eggs and add them with half  a pound of flour, a quarter of a pound of currants, two ounces of  candied orange and lemon peel cut in thin slices, and a few drops  of lemon essence; when these ingredients are well mixed and beaten,  butter a pudding tin, pour in the mixture, and bake in a moderately  quick oven.           *       *       *       *       *    CITRON PUDDING.    Cut in slices two ounces of citron, the same quantity of candied  orange and lemon peel, add to them four ounces of loaf sugar, and four  of fresh butter; line a dish with fine puff paste, and beat up to a  froth the yolks of four eggs and the whites of two, fill the dish with  these ingredients and bake half an hour. The dish should be shallow.           *       *       *       *       *    STEWED PEARS.    Peel, core, and quarter a dozen fine large baking pears, put them into  a stewpan with half a pound of white sugar and sufficient cold water  to cover them; with a small quantity of the peelings, a few cloves,  and a little cochineal tied up in a muslin bag, let them stew gently,  and closely covered until tender.           *       *       *       *       *    BAKED PEARS.    Peel them and stick a couple of cloves in each pear, place them in a  deep dish, with half a pound of brown sugar and a little water, let  them bake till quite tender.           *       *       *       *       *    STEWED PIPPINS.    Peel the pippins and stew them gently with a little water, white  sugar, and a little lemon peel; preserve is usually used to ornament  the top of each apple; they should, when done, look white and rather  transparent.           *       *       *       *       *    SIESTA CAKE.    Take one pound of butter, warm it over the fire with a little milk,  put it into a pan with a pound of flour, six eggs, a quarter of a  pound of sweet almonds finely pounded, and two table-spoonsful of  yeast; beat these ingredients well together into a light paste, and  set it before the fire to rise, butter the inside of a pan, and fill  it with alternate layers of the paste, and of pounded almonds, sugar,  citron, and cinnamon; when baked, and while hot, make holes through  the siesta with a small silver skewer, taking care not to break it,  and pour over clarified sugar till it is perfectly soaked through.           *       *       *       *       *    A PLAIN BOLA.    Take three quarters of a pound of white sugar, three quarters of a  pound of fresh butter, two eggs, one pound and a half of flour, three  spoonsful of yeast, a little milk, and two ounces of citron cut thin,  and mix into a light paste; bake in a tin, and strew powdered sugar  and cinnamon over it before baking.    The above ingredients are often baked in small tins or cups.           *       *       *       *       *    ALMOND TEA-CAKES.    Take half-a-pound of flour, three ounces of which are to be put aside  for rolling out the cakes, the other five ounces, with a quarter of  a pound of fresh butter, are to be set before the fire for a few  minutes; after which mix with it half a pound of sugar, a quarter of a  pound of sweet almonds, chopped fine, and a couple of eggs; make these  ingredients into thin cakes, and strew over them ground almonds and  white sugar, and bake in a brisk oven.           *       *     "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1233"],[0,"The Origin and Nature of the Emotions; Miscellaneous Papers (#17)"],[1," Darwin, has opened the way to the study of man on a different basis.  Psychologists, physicians, and priests are now joining hands as never  before in the great world-wide movement for the betterment of man.  The new science of sociology is combining the functions of all three,  for priest, physician, and psychologist have come to see that man  is in large measure the product of his environment.    My thesis to-night, however, will go beyond this common agreement,  for I shall maintain, not that man is in _*large measure_ the product  of his environment, but that environment has been the actual CREATOR  of man; that the old division between body, soul, and spirit  is non-existent; that man is a unified mechanism responding in every  part to the adequate stimuli given it from without by the environment  of the present and from within by the environment of the past,  the record of which is stored in part in cells throughout  the mechanism, but especially in its central battery--the brain.  I postulate further that the human body mechanism is equipped, first,  for such conflict with environment as will tend to the preservation  of the individual; and, second, for the propagation of the species,  both of these functions when most efficiently carried out tending  to the upbuilding and perfection of the race.    Through the long ages of evolution the human mechanism has been  slowly developed by the constant changes and growth of its parts  which have resulted from its continual adaptation to its environment.  In some animals the protection from too rough contact with  surroundings was secured by the development of an outside armor;  in others noxious secretions served the purposes of defense,  but such devices as these were not suitable for the higher animals  nor for the diverse and important functions of the human race.  The safety of the higher animals and of man had to be preserved  by some mechanism by means of which they could become adapted  to a much wider and more complex environment, the dominance over  which alone gives them their right to be called \"superior beings.\"  The mechanism by the progressive development of which living  beings have been able to react more and more effectually to their  environment is the central nervous system, which is seen in one  of its simplest forms in motor plants, such as the sensitive  plant and the Venus fly-trap, and in its highest development only  in the sanest, healthiest, happiest, and most useful men.    The essential function of the nervous system was primarily to secure  some form of motor activity, first as a means of securing food,  and later as a means of escaping from enemies and to promote procreation.  Activities for the preservation of the individual and of the species  were and are the only purposes for which the body energy is expended.  The central nervous system hag accordingly been developed for the purpose  of securing such motor activities as will best adapt the individuals  of a species for their self-preservative conflict with environment.    It is easy to appreciate that the simplest expressions of nerve response--  the reflexes--are motor in character, but it is difficult to understand  how such intangible reactions as love, hate, poetic fancy, or moral  inhibition can be also the result of the adaptation to environment  of a distinctively motor mechanism.  We expect, however, to prove  that so-called \"psychic\" states as well as the reflexes are products  of adaptation; that they occur automatically in response to adequate  stimuli in the environment; that, like the reflexes, they are  expressions of motor activity, which, although intangible and unseen,  in turn incite to activity the units of the motor mechanism of the body;  and finally, that any \"psychic\" condition results in a definite depletion  of the potential energy in the brain-cells which is proportionate  to the muscular exertion of which it is the representative.    That this nerve mechanism may effectively carry out its  twofold function, first, of self-adaptation to meet adequately  the increasingly complicated stimuli of environment; and second,  of adapting the motor mechanism to respond adequately to its demands,  there have been implanted in the body numerous nerve ceptors--  some for the transmission of stimuli harmful to the mechanism--  nociceptors some of a beneficial character--beneceptors; and still  others more highly specialized, which partake of the nature of both  bene- and nociceptors--the distance ceptors, or special senses.    A convincing proof that environment has been the creator  of man is seen in the absolute adaptation of the nociceptors  as manifested in their specific response to adequate stimuli,  and in their presence in only those parts of the body which throughout  the history of the race have been most exposed to harmful contacts.  We find they are most numerous in the face, the neck, the abdomen,  the hands, and the feet; while in the back they are few in number,  and within the bony cavities they are lacking.    Instances of the specific responses made by the nociceptors might be  multiplied indefinitely.  Sneezing, for example, is a specific response  made by the motor mechanism to stimulation of nociceptors in the nose,  while stimulation of the larynx does not produce a sneeze, but a cough;  stimulation of the nociceptors of the stomach does not produce cough,  but vomiting; stimulation of the nociceptors of the intestine  does not produce vomiting, but increased peristaltic action.  There are no nociceptors misplaced; none wasted; none that do not  make an adequate response to adequate stimulation.    Another most significant proof that the environment of the past  has been the creator of the man of to-day is seen in the fact  that man has added to his environment certain factors to which  adaptation has not as yet been made.  For example, heat is  a stimulus which has existed since the days of prehistoric man,  while the _x_-ray is a discovery of to-day; to heat, the nociceptors  produce an adequate response; to the _x_-ray there is no response.  There was no weapon in the prehistoric ages which could move at  the speed of a bullet from the modern rifle, therefore, while slow  penetration of the tissues produces great pain and muscular response,  there is no response to the swiftly moving bullet.    The response to contact stimuli then depends always on the presence  of nociceptors in the affected part of the body and to the type  of the contact.  Powerful response is made to crushing injury by  environmental forces; to such injuring contacts as resemble the impacts  of fighting; to such tearing injuries as resemble those made by teeth  and claws (Fig. 9). On the other hand, the sharp division of tissue  by cutting produces no adaptive response; indeed, one might imagine  that the body could be cut to pieces by a superlatively sharp knife  applied at tremendous speed without material adaptive response.    These examples indicate how the history of the phylogenetic experiences  of the human race may be learned by a study of the position  and the action of the nociceptors, just as truly as the study  of the arrangement and variations in the strata of the earth's  crust discloses to us geologic history.    These adaptive responses to stimuli are the result of the action  of the brain-cells, which are thus continually played upon by  the stimuli of environment.  The energy stored in the brain-cells  in turn activates the various organs and parts of the body.  If the environmental impacts are repeated with such frequency that  the brain-cells have no time for restoration between them, the energy  of the cells becomes exhausted and a condition of shock results.  Every action of the body may thus be analyzed into a stimulation  of ceptors, a consequent discharge of brain-cell energy,  and a final adaptive activation of the appropriate part.  Walking, running, and their modifications constitute an adaptation  of wonderful perfection, for, as Sherrington has shown,  the adaptation of locomotion consists of a series of reflexes--  ceptors in the joints, in the limb, and in the foot being stimulated  by variations in pressure.    As we have shown, the bene- and nociceptors orientate man to all  forms of physical contact--the former GUIDE HIM TO the acquisition  of food and to sexual contact; the latter DIRECT HIM FROM contacts  of a harmful nature.  The distance ceptors, on the other hand,  adapt man to his distant environment by means of communication  through unseen forces--ethereal vibrations produce sight; air waves  produce sound; microscopic particles of matter produce smell.  The advantage of the distance ceptors is that they allow time  for orientation, and because of this great advantage the majority  of man's actions are responses to their adequate stimuli.  As Sherrington has stated, the greater part of the brain has been  developed by means of stimuli received through the special senses,  especially through the light ceptors, the optic nerves.    We have just stated that by means of the distance ceptors animals  and man orientate themselves to their distant environment.  As a result of the stimulation of the special senses chase and escape  are effected, fight is conducted, food is secured, and mates are found.  It is obvious, therefore, that the distance ceptors are the primary  cause of continuous and exhausting expenditures of energy.  On the other hand, stimuli applied to contact ceptors lead to short,  quick discharges of nervous energy.  The child puts his hand  in the fire and there is an immediate and complete response  to the injuring contact; he sees a pot of jam on the pantry shelf  and a long train of continued activities are set in motion,  leading to the acquisition of the desired object.    The contact ceptors do not at all promote the expenditure of energy  in the chase or in fight, in the search for food or for mates."]]]
