Chassidism  replaced Talmudic ratiocination by exalted religious sentiment. By the  force of enthusiasm for faith, it drew its adherents together into a  firmly welded unit in contrast with Rabbinism, which sought the same  goal by the aid of the formal law. Scenting danger, the rabbinical  hierarchy declared war upon the Kabbala. Emden opposed Eibeschuetz, the  Polish Sabbatians and Frankists were fought to the death, the Wilna  Gaon organized a campaign against the Chassidim. Too late! Rabbinism  was too old, too arid, to tone down the impulsive outbreaks of passion  among the people. In their religious exaltation the masses were  looking for an elixir. They were languishing, not for light to  illumine the reason, but for warmth to set the heart aglow. They  desired to lose themselves in ecstatic self-renunciation. Chassidism  and its necessary dependence upon the Zaddik offered the masses the  means of this forgetfulness of self through faith. They were the  medium through which the people saw the world in a rosy light, and the  consequences following upon their prevalence were seen in a marked  intensification of Jewish exclusiveness.    The same aloofness characterizes the Jews of the rest of the  eighteenth century diaspora. Wherever, as in Germany, Austria, and  Italy, Jews were settled in considerable numbers, they were separated  from their surroundings by forbidding Ghetto walls. On the whole, no  difference is noticeable between conditions affecting Jews in one  country and those in another. Everywhere they were merely tolerated,  everywhere oppressed and humiliated. The bloody persecutions of the  middle ages were replaced by the burden of the exceptional laws, which  in practice degraded the Jews socially to an inferior race, to  citizens of a subordinate degree. The consequences were uniformly the  same in all countries: spiritual isolation and a morbid religious  mood. During the first half of the \"century of reason,\" Jewry  presented the appearance of an exhausted wanderer, heavily dragging  himself on his way, his consciousness clouded, his trend of thought  obviously anti-rationalistic. At the very moment in which Europe was  beginning to realize its medieval errors and repent of them, and the  era of universal ideals of humanity was dawning, Judaism raised  barricades between itself and the world at large. Elijah Gaon and  Israel Besht were the contemporaries of Voltaire and Rousseau.  Apparently there was no possibility of establishing communication  between these two diametrically opposed worlds. But history is a  magician. Not far from the Poland enveloped in medieval darkness, the  morning light of a new life was breaking upon slumbering Jewry in  German lands. New voices made themselves heard, reverberating like an  echo to the appeal issued by the \"great century\" in behalf of a  spiritual and social regeneration of mankind.          XI    THE MODERN PERIOD OF ENLIGHTENMENT (THE NINETEENTH CENTURY)      Two phenomena signalized the beginning of the latest period in Jewish  history: the lofty activity of Mendelssohn and the occurrence of the  great French Revolution. The man stands for the spiritual emancipation  of the Jews, the movement for their political emancipation. At bottom,  these two phenomena were by no means the ultimate causes of the social  and spiritual regeneration of the Jewish people. They were only the  products of the more general causes that had effected a similar  regeneration in all the peoples of Western Europe. The new currents,  the abandonment of effete intellectual and social forms, the  substitution of juster and more energetic principles, the protest  against superstition and despotism--all these traits had a common  origin, the resuscitation of reason and free thought, which dominated  all minds without asking whether they belonged to Jew or to Christian.  It might seem that the rejuvenation of the Jews had been consummated  more rapidly than the rejuvenation of the other peoples. The latter  had had two centuries, the period elapsing since the middle ages, that  is, the period between the Reformation and the great Revolution, in  which to prepare for a more rational and a more humane conduct of  life. As for the Jews, their middle ages began much later, and ended  later, almost on the eve of 1789, so that the revolution in their  minds and their mode of life had to accomplish itself hastily, under  the urgence of swiftly crowding events, by the omission of  intermediate stages. But it must be taken into consideration that long  before, in the Judeo-Hellenic and in the Arabic-Spanish period, the  Jews had passed through their \"century of reason.\" In spite of the  intervening ages of suffering and gloom, the faculty of assimilating  new principles had survived. For the descendants of Philo and  Maimonides the rationalistic movement of the eighteenth century was in  part a repetition of a well-known historical process. They had had the  benefit of a similar course of studies before, and, therefore, had no  need to cram on the eve of the final examination.    In point of fact, the transformation in the life of the Jews did take  place with extraordinary swiftness. It was hastened in France by the  principles of the Revolution and the proclamation of the civil  equality of Jews with the other citizens. In Germany, however, it  advanced upon purely spiritual lines. Mendelssohn and Lessing, the  heralds of spiritual reform, who exposed old prejudices, carried on  their labors at a time in which the Jews still stood beyond the pale  of the law, a condition which it did not occur to Frederick II, \"the  philosopher upon the throne,\" to improve. A whole generation was  destined to pass before the civil emancipation of the German Jews was  accomplished. Meantime their spiritual emancipation proceeded apace,  without help from the ruling powers. A time so early as the end of the  eighteenth century found the German Jews in a position to keep step  with their Christian fellow-citizens in cultural progress. Enlightened  Jews formed close connections with enlightened Christians, and joined  them in the universal concerns of mankind as confederates espousing  the same fundamental principles. If they renounced some of their  religious and national traditions, it was by no means out of  complaisance for their neighbors. They were guided solely and alone by  those universal principles that forced non-Jews as well as Jews to  reject many traditions as incompatible with reason and conscience.  Non-Jews and Jews alike yielded themselves up to the fresh inspiration  of the time, and permitted themselves to be carried along by the  universal transforming movement. Mendelssohn himself, circumspect and  wise, did not move off from religious national ground. But the  generation after him abandoned his position for that of universal  humanity, or, better, German nationality. His successors intoxicated  themselves with deep draughts of the marvelous poetry created by the  magic of Goethe and Schiller. They permitted themselves to be rushed  along by the liberty doctrines of 1789, they plunged head over heels  into the vortex of romanticism, and took an active part in the  conspicuous movements of Europe, political, social, and literary, as  witness Borne, Heine, and their fellow-combatants.    The excitement soon evaporated. When the noise of the liberty  love-feasts had subsided, when the cruel reaction (after 1814) had  settled heavily upon the Europe of the nineteenth century, and God's  earth had again become the arena of those agents of darkness whom  dreamers had thought buried forever beneath the ruins of the old  order, then the German Jews, or such of them as thought, came to their  senses. The more intelligent Jewish circles realized that, in devotion  to the German national movement, they had completely neglected their  own people. Yet their people, too, had needs, practical or spiritual,  had its peculiar national sphere of activity, circumscribed, indeed,  by the larger sphere of mankind's activities as by a concentric  circle, but by no means merged into it. To atone for their sin,  thinking Jews retraced their steps. They took in hand the transforming  of Jewish inner life, the simplification of the extremely complicated  Jewish ritual, the remodeling of pedagogic methods, and, above all,  the cultivation of the extended fields of Jewish science, whose head  and front is Jewish historical research in all its vastness and  detail. Heine's friend, Zunz, laid the cornerstone of Jewish science  in the second decade of the nineteenth century. His work was taken up  by a goodly company of zealous and able builders occupied for half a  century with the task of rearing the proud edifice of a scientific  historical literature, in which national self-consciousness was  sheltered and fostered. At the very height of this reforming and  literary activity, German Jewry was overwhelmed by the civil  emancipation of 1848. Again a stirring movement drew them into  sympathy with a great general cause, but this time without drawing  them away from Jewish national interests. Cultural and civil  assimilation was accomplished as an inner compelling necessity, as a  natural outcome of living. But spiritual assimilation, in the sense of  a merging of Judaism in foreign elements, was earnestly repudiated by  the noblest representatives of Judaism. It was their ideal that  universal activity and national activity should be pursued to the  prejudice of neither, certainly not to the exclusion of one or the  other, but in perfect harmony with each other. In point of fact, it  may be asserted that, in spite of a frequent tendency to go to the one  or the other extreme, the two currents, the universal and the  national, co-exist within German Jewry, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7847"],[0,"Jack North's Treasure Hunt; Or, Daring Adventures in South America (#16)"],[1,"the scene which he realized he might never  look upon again, but his narrow orbit allowed of nothing more than what he  had described.    The cannons were still thundering forth their loud-voiced peals of war,  half drowned by the incessant rattle of the smaller arms in the hands of  the town's defenders.    In a moment Plum descended to the floor in a heap.    \"Get on your feet if you can,\" said Jack a moment later.    By resting against the wall, as his companion was doing, Plum Plucky soon  stood beside him.    \"I should like to know what we are to do in this condition. We are sure to  be killed.\"    \"Hark! do you hear anything of the sentry now?\"    \"No; he went out to join the soldiers. I see him.\"    \"Then our way is clear. Now, Plum, I want you to brace yourself as best  you can, and when I give the word throw all your weight against the door  with me.\"    \"Going to try and break it down?\"    \"Yes; ready?\"    \"Ready.\"    \"Now then, together!\"    The old door shook and creaked beneath their combined efforts, but it  withstood the shock.    \"Again--together!\"    This time the whole building trembled, and the door creaked and groaned,  but still defied them.    \"Still again--together!\"    But the third attempt, nor yet the fourth nor fifth cleared their pathway,  though when both the boys were bruised from head to feet the rusty hinges  suddenly gave away and they went headlong into the narrow hallway.    Jack struck upon top, and he was the first to gain his knees, as near an  erect position as he could easily gain, and he began to crawl toward the  open air, saying:    \"Follow me, Plum.\"    On the outer threshold they paused to take a hasty survey of the  surroundings, soon satisfying themselves that a terrific battle was being  waged at the upper end of the town.    \"The quicker we get away the better,\" said Jack, begining to move  laboriously toward the grand plaza, with Plum close behind him.    In that slow, tedious way the two crossed the yard in front of the town  house, and then steering for the cover of a line of shrubbery bordering on  the west side of the plaza, they crawled as fast as they could in that  direction.    The sound of the cannon was not heard so constant now, but the storm of  the musketry had not seemed to cease to any extent.    What meant infinitely more to them, the firing was rapidly drawing nearer.  The fire, too, of the burning town was growing brighter and brighter, even  the plaza showing plainly under its vivid glare.    Upon reaching the shrubbery they stopped for a brief respite.    \"Look, Jack!\" exclaimed Plum, in a shrill whisper, \"our prison is on fire!  We didn't get out any too soon.\"    Jack had made the same discovery. He made no reply, his thoughts being  busy in another direction.    An incendiary had kindled a fire at one end of the building and so fast  did the flames increase and spread that while they watched them they  sprang up and enveloped one whole side in a crimson sheet.    \"We must get away from this place,\" said Jack. \"The two factions of war  are coming this way on a run. It must be the captors of the town have met  more than their match this time.\"    Again the escaping couple began their slow retreat, now under cover of a  dense growth reaching they knew not how far. Nor did that matter so long  as it afford them shelter from their enemies.    Once, having gained a little summit from which they could look down on the  exciting scene, they stopped to gaze back, their curiosity aroused by the  wild medley of cries.    The town house was now all ablaze, the lurid fire feeding upon its walls  lighting far the night scene, while throwing a weird glamor over the  contending factions of war-crazed men, who had now both reached the  further side of the plaza and temporally suspended hostilities.    There was a reason for this last, too, as explained by Jack's words, as he  analyzed the situation:    \"They are Chilians on both sides, Plum!\"    \"Do you mean, Jack, that this attack on the Chilians of the town has been  made by some of their own countrymen?\"    \"Yes; there has been some mistake made, which has cost many needless  lives. What a painful surprise it must be to them!\"    Jack afterwards learned that he had been right in his conjectures, and  that through some unexplainable blunder one division of the Chilian army  had been sent to capture the town already in possession of another  portion.    Santa Rosilla was in the possession of the Chilians sure enough now!    But Jack and Plum dared not stop to see the outcome of this singular  meeting between the armed forces, but improved every moment to get away  from the ill-fated town.          Chapter XX    Preparations for Departure        Three days later, having actually worn off the bonds on their lower limbs  by their long, painful journey on their hands and knees through the dense  growth, until a friendly Peruvian lad finished their liberation, Jack and  Plum entered de la Pama, two sorry-looking youths but still full of  courage. Almost the first news they learned was that the St. Resa railroad  was again without the men to run the train, which had been stalled for  weeks. In fact, the engineer and his helper who had succeeded them, had  not made one complete trip, the fireman having blown out the boiler soon  after leaving De la Pama.    In this dilemma the officials hailed the appearance of the boys with  unfeigned delight. But Jack was sorry to learn that it had been decided  not to pay over thirty pistoles a month for his services.    \"We might as well let the cars stand idle as to pay out all we can get for  help. Then, too, the business is not going to be very good while this war  lasts, senor.\"    The pay was still big for that country, and Jack resolved to accept,  though before doing so he asked: \"What will you pay my fireman?\"    \"Twenty pistoles, senor. That is the best we can do. We can get plenty of  men for that price.\" \"It doesn't look so. But what do you say, Plum? That  will bring you seventy-two dollars a month, if I reckon right. I will try  it for awhile if you will go with me.\"    \"I'm with you.\"    Most unexpected to them at the time they began, the \"awhile\" proved for a  year. Jack had not dreamed he should stay so long, but his previous  experience had left him penniless, and with his fixed determination to try  again, he knew he would not be able to find so good an opportunity to earn  the needed money to begin renewed operations. During those days Jack sent  several letters to his folks and to Jenny. In return he received a letter  from his father, stating that all was now going fairly well with the  family and if he wanted to stay in South America he could do so. Mr. North  also sent the information that Fowler & Company had gone into the hands of  a receiver and there was no telling whether the business would be  continued or not, and Jack need not expect any back pay from the concern.    From Jenny Jack heard not a word, much to his anxiety and dismay. The fact  was that Jenny's folks had moved to another town and she had not received  Jack's letters, and consequently did not know exactly where he was.    \"I suppose she has forgotten all about me,\" he thought, with a sigh.  \"Well, I suppose I ought to go back, but I hate to do it before I've  managed to get some money together. There's a fortune in that nitrate and  I know it, and some day I'll get hold of it.\"    Very much to Jack's surprise they were not molested very much by the  bush-raiders, whose power seemed to have been checked by the advance of  the opposing armies, for the war was still carried on, though in a sort of  desultory manner, as if each side was afraid of the others. Jack could  foresee that the Chilians were pretty sure to secure that portion of the  country before they got through. Plum Plucky had stood by his friend all  of this time, and they had met with some thrilling experiences, but come  out of them safely.    Jack saved his money like a miser, and with undimmed faith in his ultimate  success bought five more nitrate beds, to be laughed at by his friend.    \"Should think you would want to look after 'em loads you have got over on  the Andes,\" Plum would frequently say.    Each time Jack remained silent.    \"Say, Jack,\" Plum would then invariably say, \"don't yeou s'pose 'em oxen  are getting hungry by this time?\"    Still the other held his peace.    Jack had not forgotten the mysterious island in the equally mysterious  lake amid the Andes, and twice during the year his memory had been  refreshed by startling accounts given of the place by different parties  that had visited the valley. These men had given it the name of the  \"Devil's Waters,\" not very inappropriately.    At the end of the year, it now being certain that the Peruvians were  losing their hold on the province which comprised the territory in which  they were located, Jack said to his companion:    \"I am almost sorry to say that I shall make my last trip to-morrow, Plum.\"    \"Going back to nitrates?\" asked the other, showing but little surprise.    \"Yes. I must get a cargo to America as soon as possible.\"    \"Should think you would want to. Guess I will stick to the old gal here a  little longer. When I have got enough money to get out of this swamp in  the way I want to I shall go back to old New England.    \"I tell you there is no place like the Old Bay State. Yeou won't think me  a sneak for deserting yeou now, Jack?\" dropping back into his old-time  nasal drawl.    \"Oh, no, of course not. In fact, I think you are doing just as I should if  I were in your place. I will speak a good word for you to get my position  as engineer. You can run the engine as well as I now.\"    \"Good for you, Jack. Now, how do you think of getting that stuff to the  States?\"    \"About the same way I tried first, only I shall not try to go behind that  spur of the Andes, as I did before.    \"I can see my mistake now, though I believe that "]]]
