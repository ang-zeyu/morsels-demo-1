[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12809"],[0,"Quiet Talks about Jesus (#17)"],[1,"the necessity of dying. Through Jesus dying there is  for such a man _life_. That is the statement Jesus makes.    In five distinct sentences He attempts to make His meaning simple and  clear. The first sentence puts the _negative_ side: there is no life  without Jesus being taken into one's being. Then the positive side:  through this sort of eating there is _life_. And with this is coupled the  inferential statement that they are not to be spared _bodily_ death,  because they are to be _raised up_. The third sentence, that Jesus is the  one true food of real life. The fourth sentence gives a parallel or  interchangeable phrase for eating and drinking, _i.e._, \"_abideth_ in me  and I in Him.\" A mutual abiding in each other. The food abides in the man  eating it. The man abides in the strength of the food He has taken in.  Eating My flesh means abiding in Me. The last sentence gives an  illustration. This living in Jesus, having Him live in us as closely as  though actually eaten, is the same as Jesus' own life on earth being lived  in His Father, dependent upon the Father. And when the crowds take His  words literally and complain that none can understand such statements, He  at once explains that, of course, He does not mean literal eating--\"The  flesh profiteth nothing\" (even if you did eat it): \"it is the _Spirit_  that gives life:\" \"the _words_ ... are _Spirit_ and _life_.\" The taking  of Jesus through His words into one's life to dominate--that is the  meaning.    A few months later, in Jerusalem, He speaks again of His purpose, in  John's tenth chapter, \"The good shepherd layeth down His life for the  sheep.\" \"I lay down my life for the sheep.\" The death was for others  because of threatening danger. \"Other sheep I have which are not of this  fold: them also I must lead.\" Here is clear foresight of the wide sweep of  influence through His death. \"I lay down my life that I may take it  again.\" The death was _one step_ in a plan. There is something beyond. \"I  lay it down of myself. I have the right to lay it down, and I have the  right to take it again. This commandment I received from my Father.\" The  dying was voluntary and was agreed to between the Father and Himself. To  the disciples He speaks of the need of taking up a \"cross\" in order to be  followers, and to the critical Pharisee asking a sign, He alludes to  Jonah's three days and nights in the belly of the sea monster. Neither of  these allusions conveyed any definite idea to those listening.    Then the last week when the Greeks came; \"Except a grain of wheat fall  into the earth and die, it abideth by itself alone; but if it die, it  beareth much fruit.\" The dying was to have great influence upon others.  \"And I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto myself.\"  The dying was to be _for others_, and to exert tremendous influence upon  the whole race.    In that last long talk with the eleven, \"that the world may know that I  love the Father and as the Father gave me commandment even so I do.\" The  dying was in obedience to His Father's wish, and was to let men know of  the great love between Father and Son. \"Greater love hath no man than  this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\" This dying was for  these friends. And in that great prayer that lays His heart bare, \"for  their sakes I sanctify myself that they also may be sanctified in truth.\"  The dying is _for others_, and is for the securing in these others of a  certain spirit or character. The reference to the dying being in accord  with the Father's wish comes out again at the arrest, \"The cup that the  Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?\"    To these quotations from Jesus' lips may be added a significant one from  the man who stood closest to Jesus. Referring to a statement about Jesus  made by Caiaphas, John adds: \"being high priest that year he prophesied  that Jesus should die for the nation; and not for the nation only, but  that He might gather together into one the children of God that are  scattered abroad.\" As John understood the matter, the death was not simply  for others, but for the _Jewish nation_ as a nation, and beyond that for a  gathering into one of _all_ of God's children. Jesus was to be God's  magnet for attracting together all that belong to Him. The death was to be  a roadway through to something beyond.    From His own words, then, Jesus saw a _necessity_ for His dying. He  \"must\" be lifted up. That \"must\" spells out the desperateness of the need  and the strength of His love. Sin contains in itself death for man as a  logical result. And by death is not meant the passing of life out of the  body. That is a mere incident of death. Death is separation from God. It  is gradual until finally complete. Love would plan nothing less radical  than a death that would be for man the death of death. His death was to be  _for others_, it was purely _voluntary_, it was by agreement with His  Father, in obedience to His wishes, and an evidence of His filial love.  The death is a step in a plan. There is something beyond, growing out of  the death.    Jesus plans not merely a transfer of the death item, but a _new_ life, a  new _sort_ of life, in its place. The dying is but a step. It is a great  step, tremendously great, indispensable, the step that sets the pace. Yet  but one step of a number. Beyond the dying is the _living_, living a _new_  life. He works out in Himself the plan for them--a dying, and after that a  new life, and a new sort of life. Then according to His other teaching  there is the sending of some One else to men to work out in His name in  each of them this plan. That plan is to be worked out in each man choosing  to receive Him into his life. He will send down His other self, the Holy  Spirit, to work this out in each one. Jesus' death released His life to be  re-lived in us. Jesus plans to get rid of the sin in a man, and put in  something else in its place. The sin must be gotten out, first washed  out, then burned out. Then a new seed put in that will bear life. What a  chemist and artist in one is this Jesus! He uses bright red, to get a pure  white out of a dead black.    In addition to the plan for man individually, the dying is to produce the  same result in the Jewish nation. There is to be a national new-birth. A  new Jewish people. And then the dying is to have a tremendous influence  upon all men. On the cross Jesus would suffer the birth-pains of a new  life for man and for the world. Such, in brief, seems to be the grouping  of Jesus' own thought about His dying. Its whole influence is manward.    The value of Jesus' dying lies wholly in its being _voluntary_. Of  deliberate purpose He _allowed_ them to put Him to death. Otherwise they  could not, as is fully proven by their repeated failures. And the purpose  as well as the value of the death lies entirely in His _motive_ in  yielding. If they could have taken His life without His consent, then that  death would have been an expression of their hate, and only that. But as  it is, it forever stands an expression of two things. On their part of the  intensest, hottest hate; on His part of the finest, strongest love. It  makes new records for both hate and love. Sin put Jesus to death. In  yielding to these men Jesus was yielding to sin, for they personified sin.  And sin yielded to quickly brought death, its logical outcome.    Jesus' dying being His own act, controlled entirely by His own intention,  makes it _sacrificial_. There are certain necessary elements in such a  sacrifice. It must be voluntary. It must involve pain or suffering of some  sort. The suffering must be _undeserved_, that is, in no way or degree a  result of one's own act, else it is not sacrifice, but logical result. It  must be for others. And the suffering must be of a sort that would not  come save for this voluntary act. It must be supposed to bring benefit to  the others. Each of these elements must be in to make up fully a  sacrifice. There are elements of sacrifice in much noble suffering by man.  But in no one do all of these elements perfectly combine and blend, save  in Jesus.    To this agree the words of the philosopher of the New Testament writers.  It would be so, of course, for the Spirit of Jesus swayed Paul. The  epistle to the Romans contains a brief packed summary of his understanding  of the gospel plan. There is in it one remarkable statement of the  _Father's_, purpose in Jesus' death. In the third chapter, verse  twenty-six, freely translated, \"that He might be reckoned righteous in  reckoning righteous the man who has faith.\" \"That He might be reckoned  righteous\"--that is, in His attitude toward sin. That in allowing things  to go on as they were, in holding back sin's logical judgment, He was not  careless or indifferent about sin or making light of it. He was controlled  by a great purpose.    God's great difficulty was to make clear at once both His love and His  hate: His love for man: His hate for the sin that man had grained in so  deep that they were as one. For the man's sake He must show His love to  win and change him. For man's sake He must show His hate of sin that man,  too, might know its hatefulness and learn to hate it with intensest hate.  His love for man is to be the measure of man's hate for sin. The death of  Jesus was God's master-stroke. At one stroke He told man His estimate of  man and His estimate of man's sin; His love and His hate. It was the  measureless measure of His hate for sin, and His love for man. It was a  master-stroke too, in that He took sin's worst--the cross--and in it  revealed His own best. Out of what was meant for God's defeat, came sin's  defeat, and God's greatest victory.    And the one simple thing that transfers to a man all that Jesus has worked  out for him is what is commonly called \"faith.\" That is, trusting God,  turning the heart Godward, yielding to the inward upward tug, letting the  pleasing of God"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12814"],[0,"Philippine Folk Tales (#17)"],[1,"forward with his sword, though he  could see no enemy. Then the spirit which had spoken to him made him  sleep for a short time. When he awoke the rage was spent.    Again the spirit appeared, and it said: \"The seven men whom you killed  were sent to kill you by the spirit of the great stone, for he looked  in your hand and saw that you were to marry the orphan girl whom  he himself wished to wed. But you have conquered. Your enemies are  dead. Go home now and prepare a great quantity of wine, for I shall  bring your enemies to life again, and you will all live in peace.\"    So the widow's son went home, and his mother, who had believed him  dead, was filled with joy at his coming, and all the people in the town  came out to welcome him. When he had told them his story, they hastened  to get wine, and all day they bore jarsful to the widow's house.    That night there was a great feast, and the spirit of the great stone,  his seven warriors, the friendly spirit, and the giant all came. The  widow's son married the orphan girl, while another beautiful woman  became the wife of the spirit of the stone.            MORO        Introduction      About the year 1400 something happened which changed the beliefs and  customs of many of the tribes of the southern Philippines and made  of them a powerful and dreaded people.    It was about this time that Arabian traders and missionaries began  to establish themselves in the Islands, and soon these were followed  by hordes of Mohammedan converts from the islands to the south. Among  the newcomers were men who became powerful rulers, and they, in time,  brought together many of the settlements which formerly had been  hostile to each other and united them under the faith of Islam. Those  who accepted the new faith adopted the dress and many of the customs  of their teachers and came to be known as Moro.    With the possession of firearms, which were introduced by the  newcomers, the Moro grew very daring and were greatly feared by the  other natives. And soon they began to make long trips on the sea  to the north and south, carrying on trade and making many surprise  attacks for loot and slaves.    At the time the Spaniards discovered the Philippines, the Moro  were a terror to the other inhabitants, and they continued to be so  until very recent years. They became ferocious pirates infesting the  southern seas and preying upon the rich trade which the Spaniards  carried on with Mexico. Stone walls and watch towers were built at  advantageous points to guard against them, but bays and creeks which  afforded opportunities for lurking, surprise, and attack continued  to be frequented by the treacherous warriors.    Since American occupation the waters have been made practically  free from their ravages, but on land they have continued to give  trouble. The greater part of the Moro now live in the Sulu Archipelago  and on the Island of Mindanao. They range in degree of civilization  from sea \"gypsies,\" who wander from place to place, living for months  in their rude outrigger boats, to settled communities which live by  fishing and farming, and even by manufacturing some cloth, brass, and  steel. Their villages are near the coast, along rivers, or about the  shores of the interior lakes, the houses being raised high on poles  near or over the water, for they live largely on food from the sea.    Their folk-lore, as will be seen from the following tales, shows  decided influence from Arabia and India, which has filtered in through  the islands to the south. [140]        Mythology of Mindanao [141]    _Moro_      A long, long time ago Mindanao was covered with water, and the sea  extended over all the lowlands so that nothing could be seen but  mountains. Then there were many people living in the country, and all  the highlands were dotted with villages and settlements. For many years  the people prospered, living in peace and contentment. Suddenly there  appeared in the land four horrible monsters which, in a short time,  had devoured every human being they could find.    Kurita, a terrible creature with many limbs, lived partly on land and  partly in the sea, but its favorite haunt was the mountain where the  rattan grew; and here it brought utter destruction on every living  thing. The second monster, Tarabusaw, an ugly creature in the form  of a man, lived on Mt. Matutun, and far and wide from that place he  devoured the people, laying waste the land. The third, an enormous  bird called Pah, [142] was so large that when on the wing it covered  the sun and brought darkness to the earth. Its egg was as large as a  house. Mt. Bita was its haunt, and there the only people who escaped  its voracity were those who hid in caves in the mountains. The fourth  monster was a dreadful bird also, having seven heads and the power  to see in all directions at the same time. Mt. Gurayn was its home  and like the others it wrought havoc in its region.    So great was the death and destruction caused by these terrible animals  that at length the news spread even to the most distant lands, and  all nations were grieved to hear of the sad fate of Mindanao.    Now far across the sea in the land of the golden sunset was a city  so great that to look at its many people would injure the eyes of  man. When tidings of these great disasters reached this distant city,  the heart of the king Indarapatra [143] was filled with compassion,  and he called his brother, Sulayman, [144] begging him to save the  land of Mindanao from the monsters.    Sulayman listened to the story, and as he heard he was moved with pity.    \"I will go,\" said he, zeal and enthusiasm adding to his strength,  \"and the land shall be avenged.\"    King Indarapatra, proud of his brother's courage, gave him a ring and  a sword as he wished him success and safety. Then he placed a young  sapling by his window [145] and said to Sulayman:    \"By this tree I shall know your fate from the time you depart from  here, for if you live, it will live; but if you die, it will die also.\"    So Sulayman departed for Mindanao, and he neither walked nor used a  boat, but he went through the air and landed on the mountain where  the rattan grew. There he stood on the summit and gazed about on all  sides. He looked on the land and the villages, but he could see no  living thing. And he was very sorrowful and cried out:    \"Alas, how pitiful and dreadful is this devastation!\"    No sooner had Sulayman uttered these words than the whole mountain  began to move, and then shook. Suddenly out of the ground came the  horrible creature, Kurita. It sprang at the man and sank its claws  into his flesh. But Sulayman, knowing at once that this was the  scourge of the land, drew his sword and cut the Kurita to pieces.    Encouraged by his first success, Sulayman went on to Mt. Matutun  where conditions were even worse. As he stood on the heights viewing  the great devastation  there was a noise in the forest and a movement  in the trees. With a loud yell, forth leaped Tarabusaw. For a moment  they looked at each other, neither showing any fear. Then Tarabusaw  threatened to devour the man, and Sulayman declared that he would kill  the monster. At that the animal broke large branches off the trees  and began striking at Sulayman who, in turn, fought back. For a long  time the battle continued until at last the monster fell exhausted  to the ground and then Sulayman killed him with his sword.    The next place visited by Sulayman was Mt. Bita. Here havoc was present  everywhere, and though he passed by many homes, not a single soul  was left. As he walked along, growing sadder at each moment, a sudden  darkness which startled him fell over the land. As he looked toward  the sky he beheld a great bird descending upon him. Immediately he  struck at it, cutting off its wing with his sword, and the bird fell  dead at his feet; but the wing fell on Sulayman, and he was crushed.    Now at this very time King Indarapatra was sitting at his window,  and looking out he saw the little tree wither and dry up.    \"Alas!\" he cried, \"my brother is dead\"; and he wept bitterly.    Then although he was very sad, he was filled with a desire for revenge,  and putting on his sword and belt he started for Mindanao in search  of his brother.    He, too, traveled through the air with great speed until he came to  the mountain where the rattan grew. There he looked about, awed at  the great destruction, and when he saw the bones of Kurita he knew  that his brother had been there and gone. He went on till he came to  Matutun, and when he saw the bones of Tarabusaw he knew that this,  too, was the work of Sulayman.    Still searching for his brother, he arrived at Mt. Bita where the  dead bird lay on the ground, and as he lifted the severed wing he  beheld the bones of Sulayman with his sword by his side. His grief  now so overwhelmed Indarapatra that he wept for some time. Upon  looking up he beheld a small jar of water by his side. This he knew  had been sent from heaven, and he poured the water over the bones,  and Sulayman came to life again. They greeted each other and talked  long together. Sulayman declared that he had not been dead but asleep,  and their hearts were full of joy.    After some time Sulayman returned to his distant home, but Indarapatra  continued his journey to Mt. Gurayn where he killed the dreadful bird  with the seven heads. After these monsters had all been destroyed  and peace and safety had been restored to the land, Indarapatra began  searching everywhere to see if some of the people might not be hidden  in the earth still alive.    One day during his search he caught sight of a beautiful woman at a  distance. When he hastened toward her she disappeared through a hole  in the ground where she was standing. Disappointed and tired, he sat  down on a rock to rest, when, looking about, he saw near him a pot  of uncooked rice with a big fire on the ground in"]]]
