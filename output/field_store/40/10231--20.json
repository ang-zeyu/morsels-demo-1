WHILE the Astorians were busily occupied in completing their factory and  fort, a report was brought to them by an Indian from the upper part of  the river, that a party of thirty white men had appeared on the banks  of the Columbia, and were actually building houses at the second rapids.  This information caused much disquiet. We have already mentioned that  the Northwest Company had established posts to the west of the Rocky  Mountains, in a district called by them New Caledonia, which extended  from lat. 52 to 55 deg north, being within the British territories. It  was now apprehended that they were advancing within the American limits,  and were endeavoring to seize upon the upper part of the river and  forestall the American Fur Company in the surrounding trade; in which  case bloody feuds might be anticipated, such as had prevailed between  the rival fur companies in former days.    A reconnoitring party was sent up the river to ascertain the truth of  the report. They ascended to the foot of the first rapid, about two  hundred miles, but could hear nothing of any white men being in the  neighborhood.    Not long after their return, however, further accounts were received,  by two wandering Indians, which established the fact that the Northwest  Company had actually erected a trading house on the Spokane River, which  falls into the north branch of the Columbia.    What rendered this intelligence the more disquieting was the inability  of the Astorians, in their present reduced state as to numbers, and  the exigencies of their new establishment, to furnish detachments  to penetrate the country in different directions, and fix the posts  necessary to secure the interior trade.    It was resolved, however, at any rate, to advance a countercheck to this  post on the Spokan, and one of the partners, Mr. David Stuart, prepared  to set out for the purpose with eight men and a small assortment of  goods. He was to be guided by the two Indians, who knew the country and  promised to take him to a place not far from the Spokan River, and in a  neighborhood abounding with beaver. Here he was to establish himself and  to remain for a time, provided he found the situation advantageous and  the natives friendly.    On the 15th of July, when Mr. Stuart was nearly ready to embark, a canoe  made its appearance, standing for the harbor, and manned by nine white  men. Much speculation took place who these strangers could be, for it  was too soon to expect their own people, under Mr. Hunt, who were to  cross the continent. As the canoe drew near, the British standard was  distinguished: on coming to land, one of the crew stepped on shore, and  announced himself as Mr. David Thompson, astronomer, and partner of  the Northwest Company. According to his account, he had set out in the  preceding year with a tolerably strong party, and a supply of Indian  goods, to cross the Rocky Mountains. A part of his people, however, had  deserted him on the eastern side, and returned with the goods to the  nearest Northwest post. He had persisted in crossing the mountains  with eight men, who remained true to him. They had traversed the higher  regions, and ventured near the source of the Columbia, where, in the  spring, they had constructed a cedar canoe, the same in which they had  reached Astoria.    This, in fact, was the party despatched by the Northwest Company to  anticipate Mr. Astor in his intention of effecting a settlement at the  mouth of the Columbia River. It appears, from information subsequently  derived from other sources, that Mr. Thompson had pushed on his course  with great haste, calling at all the Indian villages in his march,  presenting them with British flags, and even planting them at the forks  of the rivers, proclaiming formally that he took possession of the  country in the name of the king of Great Britain for the Northwest  Company. As his original plan was defeated by the desertion of  his people, it is probable that he descended the river simply to  reconnoitre, and ascertain whether an American settlement had been  commenced.    Mr. Thompson was, no doubt, the first white man who descended the  northern branch of the Columbia from so near its source. Lewis and  Clarke struck the main body of the river at the forks, about four  hundred miles from its mouth. They entered it from Lewis River, its  southern branch, and thence descended.    Though Mr. Thompson could be considered as little better than a spy in  the camp, he was received with great cordiality by Mr. M'Dougal, who  had a lurking feeling of companionship and good-will for all of the  Northwest Company. He invited him to head-quarters, where he and his  people were hospitably entertained. Nay, further, being somewhat in  extremity, he was furnished by Mr. M'Dougal with goods and provisions  for his journey back across the mountains, much against the wishes Of  Mr. David Stuart, who did not think the object of his visit entitled him  to any favor.    On the 23rd of July, Mr. Stuart set out upon his expedition to the  interior. His party consisted of four of the clerks, Messrs. Pillet,  Ross, M'Lennon, and Montigny, two Canadian voyageurs, and two natives of  the Sandwich Islands. They had three canoes well laden with provisions,  and with goods and necessities for a trading establishment.    Mr. Thompson and his party set out in company with them, it being  his intention to proceed direct to Montreal. The partners at Astoria  forwarded by him a short letter to Mr. Astor, informing him of their  safe arrival at the mouth of the Columbia, and that they had not  yet heard of Mr. Hunt. The little squadron of canoes set sail with a  favorable breeze, and soon passed Tongue Point, a long, high, and rocky  promontory, covered with trees, and stretching far into the river.  Opposite to this, on the northern shore, is a deep bay, where the  Columbia anchored at the time of the discovery, and which is still  called Gray's Bay, from the name of her commander.    From hence, the general course of the river for about seventy miles  was nearly southeast; varying in breadth according to its bays and  indentations, and navigable for vessels of three hundred tons. The  shores were in some places high and rocky, with low marshy islands at  their feet, subject to inundation, and covered with willows, poplars,  and other trees that love an alluvial soil. Sometimes the mountains  receded, and gave place to beautiful plains and noble forests. While  the river margin was richly fringed with trees of deciduous foliage, the  rough uplands were crowned by majestic pines, and firs of gigantic size,  some towering to the height of between two and three hundred feet, with  proportionate circumference. Out of these the Indians wrought their  great canoes and pirogues.    At one part of the river, they passed, on the northern side, an isolated  rock, about one hundred and fifty feet high, rising from a low marshy  soil, and totally disconnected with the adjacent mountains. This was  held in great reverence by the neighboring Indians, being one of their  principal places of sepulture. The same provident care for the deceased  that prevails among the hunting tribes of the prairies is observable  among the piscatory tribes of the rivers and sea-coast. Among the  former, the favorite horse of the hunter is buried with him in the same  funereal mound, and his bow and arrows are laid by his side, that he  may be perfectly equipped for the \"happy hunting grounds\" of the land of  spirits. Among the latter, the Indian is wrapped in his mantle of  skins, laid in his canoe, with his paddle, his fishing spear, and other  implements beside him, and placed aloft on some rock or other eminence  overlooking the river, or bay, or lake, that he has frequented. He is  thus fitted out to launch away upon those placid streams and sunny lakes  stocked with all kinds of fish and waterfowl, which are prepared in the  next world for those who have acquitted themselves as good sons, good  fathers, good husbands, and, above all, good fishermen, during their  mortal sojourn.    The isolated rock in question presented a spectacle of the kind,  numerous dead bodies being deposited in canoes on its summit; while on  poles around were trophies, or, rather, funeral offerings of trinkets,  garments, baskets of roots, and other articles for the use of the  deceased. A reverential feeling protects these sacred spots from robbery  or insult. The friends of the deceased, especially the women, repair  here at sunrise and sunset for some time after his death, singing his  funeral dirge, and uttering loud wailings and lamentations.    From the number of dead bodies in canoes observed upon this rock by  the first explorers of the river, it received the name of Mount Coffin,  which it continues to bear.    Beyond this rock they passed the mouth of a river on the right bank  of the Columbia, which appeared to take its rise in a distant mountain  covered with snow. The Indian name of this river was the Cowleskee. Some  miles further on they came to the great Columbian Valley, so called by  Lewis and Clarke. It is sixty miles in width, and extends far to the  southeast between parallel ridges of mountains, which bound it on the  east and west. Through the centre of this valley flowed a large and  beautiful stream, called the Wallamot, which came wandering for several  miles, through a yet unexplored wilderness. The sheltered situation of  this immense valley had an obvious effect upon the climate. It was a  region of great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13711"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#17)"],[1,"manner, and stood laughing,  one or two on either side, when any lions came after their comrades to  examine pieces of skin or bones which they were dragging away. I had  lain watching this banquet for about three hours, in the strong hope  that, when the lions had feasted, they would come and drink. Two black  and two white rhinoceroses had made their appearance, but, scared by  the smell of the blood, they had made off. At length the lions seemed  satisfied. They all walked about with their heads up, and seemed to  be thinking about the water; and in two minutes one of them turned his  face toward me, and came on; he was immediately followed by a second  lion, and in half a minute by the remaining four. It was a decided  and general move, they were all coming to drink right bang in my face,  within fifteen yards of me.\"    The hunters were presently discovered. \"An old lioness, who seemed to  take the lead, had detected me, and, with her head high and her eyes  fixed full upon me she was coming slowly round the corner of the  little vley to cultivate further my acquaintance! This unfortunate  coincidence put a stop at once to all further contemplation. I  thought; in my haste, that it was perhaps most prudent to shoot  this lioness, especially as none of the others had noticed me. I  accordingly moved my arm and covered her; she saw me move and halted,  exposing a full broadside. I fired; the ball entered one shoulder, and  passed out behind the other. She bounded forward with repeated growls,  and was followed by her five comrades all enveloped in a cloud of  dust; nor did they atop until they had reached the cover behind  me, except one old gentleman, who halted and looked back for a few  seconds, when I fired, but the ball went high. I listened anxiously  for some sound to denote the approaching end of the lioness; nor  listened in vain. I heard her growling and stationary, as if dying. In  one minute her comrades crossed the vley a little below me, and made  toward the rhinoceros. I then slipped Wolf and Boxer on her scent,  and, following them into the cover, I found her lying dead.\"    Mr. Cumming's adventures with elephants are no less thrilling. He had  selected for the aim of his murderous rifle two huge female elephants  from a herd. \"Two of the troop had walked slowly past at about sixty  yards, and the one which I had selected was feeding with two others  on a thorny tree before me. My hand was now as steady as the rock on  which it rested, so, taking a deliberate aim, I let fly at her head, a  little behind the eye. She got it hard and sharp, just where I aimed,  but it did not seem to affect her much. Uttering a loud cry, she  wheeled about, when I gave her the second ball, close behind the  shoulder. All the elephants uttered a strange rumbling noise, and made  off in a line to the northward at a brisk ambling pace, their huge  fanlike ears flapping in the ratio of their speed. I did not wait to  load, but ran back to the hillock to obtain a view. On gaining its  summit, the guides pointed out the elephants; they were standing in  a grove of shady trees, but the wounded one was some distance behind  with another elephant, doubtless its particular friend, who was  endeavoring to assist it. These elephants had probably never before  heard the report of a gun; and having neither seen nor smelt me, they  were unaware of the presence of man, and did not seem inclined to go  any further. Presently my men hove in sight, bringing the dogs; and  when these came up, I waited some time before commencing the attack,  that the dogs and horses might recover their wind. We then rode slowly  toward the elephants, and had advanced within two hundred yards of  them, when, the ground being open, they observed us, and made off  in an easterly direction; but the wounded one immediately dropped  astern, and next moment she was surrounded by the dogs, which, barking  angrily, seemed to engross her attention. Having placed myself between  her and the retreating troop, I dismounted to fire, within forty  yards of her, in open ground. Colesberg was extremely afraid of the  elephants, and gave me much trouble, jerking my arm when I tried to  fire. At length I let fly; but, on endeavoring to regain my saddle.  Colesberg declined to allow me to mount; and when I tried to lead him,  and run for it, he only backed toward the wounded elephant. At this  moment I heard another elephant close behind: and on looking about I  beheld the 'friend,' with uplifted trunk, charging down upon me at top  speed, shrilly trumpeting, and following an old black pointer named  Schwart, that was perfectly deaf, and trotted along before the enraged  elephant quite unaware of what was behind him. I felt certain that  she would have either me or my horse. I, however, determined not to  relinquish my steed, but to hold on by the bridle. My men, who of  course kept at a safe distance, stood aghast with their mouths open,  and for a few seconds my position was certainly not an enviable  one. Fortunately, however, the dogs took off the attention of the  elephants; and, just us they were upon me I managed to spring into the  saddle, where I was safe. As I turned my back to mount, the elephants  were so very near, that I really expected to feel one of their  trunks lay hold of me. I rode up to Kleinboy for my double-barrelled  two-grooved rifle; he and Isaac were pale and almost speechless with  fright. Returning to the charge, I was soon once more alongside,  and, firing from the saddle, I sent another brace of bullets into the  wounded elephant. Colesberg was extremely unsteady, and destroyed the  correctness of my aim. The 'friend' now seemed resolved to do some  mischief, and charged me furiously, pursuing me to a distance of  several hundred yards. I therefore deemed it proper to give her  a gentle hint to act less officiously, and so, having loaded, I  approached within thirty yards, and gave it her sharp, right and left,  behind the shoulder; upon which she at once made off with drooping  trunk, evidently with a mortal wound. Two more shots finished her; on  receiving them she tossed her trunk up and down two or three times,  and falling on her broadside against a thorny tree, which yielded like  grass before her enormous weight, she uttered a deep hoarse cry and  expired.\"    Mr. Cumming's exploits in the water are no less exciting than his land  adventures. Here is an account of his victory over a hippopotamus, on  the banks of the Limpopo river, near the northernmost extremity of his  journeyings.    \"There were four of them, three cows and an old bull; they stood in  the middle of the river, and though alarmed, did not appear aware of  the extent of the impending danger. I took the sea-cow next me, and  with my first ball I gave her a mortal wound, knocking loose a great  plate on the top of her skull. She at once commenced plunging round  and round, and then occasionally remained still, sitting for a few  minutes on the same spot. On hearing the report of my rifle two of  the others took up stream, and the fourth dashed down the river; they  trotted along, like oxen, at a smart pace as long as the water was  shallow. I was now in a state of very great anxiety about my wounded  sea-cow, for I feared that she would get down into deep water, and  be lost like the last one; her struggles were still carrying her  down stream, and the water was becoming deeper. To settle the matter  I accordingly fired a second shot from the bank, which, entering  the roof of her skull, passed out through her eye; she then, kept  continually splashing round and round in a circle in the middle of the  river. I had great fears of the crocodiles, and I did not know that  the sea-cow might not attack me. My anxiety to secure her, however,  overcame all hesitation; so, divesting myself of my leathers, and  armed with a sharp knife. I dashed into the water, which at first took  me up to my arm-pits, but in the middle was shallower. As I approached  Behemoth her eye looked very wicked. I halted for a moment, ready to  dive under the water if she attacked me, but she was stunned, and did  not know what she was doing; so, running in upon her, and seizing  her short tail, I attempted to incline her course to land. It was  extraordinary what enormous strength she still had in the water. I  could not guide her in the slightest, and she continued to splash, and  plunge, and blow, and make her circular course, carrying me along with  her as if I was a fly on her tail. Finding her tail gave me but a poor  hold, as the only means of securing my prey, I took out my knife, and  cutting two deep parallel incisions through the skin on her rump, and  lifting this skin from the flesh, so that I could get in my two hands,  I made use of this as a handle; and after some desperate hard work,  sometimes pushing and sometimes pulling, the sea-cow continuing her  circular course all the time and I holding on at her rump like grim  Death, eventually I succeeded in bringing this gigantic and most  powerful animal to the bank. Here the Bushman, quickly brought me a  stout buffalo-rheim from my horse's neck, which I passed through the  opening in the thick skin, and moored Behemoth to a tree. I then took  my rifle, and sent a ball through the center of her head, and she was  numbered with the dead.\" There is nothing in \"Waterton's Wanderings,\"  or in the \"Adventures of Baron Munchausen\" more startling than this  \"Waltz with a Hippopotamus!\"    In the all-wise disposition of events, it is perhaps ordained that  wild animals should be subdued by man to his use at the expense  of such tortures as those described in the work before us. Mere  amusement, therefore, is too light a motive for dealing such wounds  and death Mr. Cumming owns to; but he had other motives,--besides a  considerable profit he has reaped in trophies, ivory, fur, &c., he has  made in his book some valuable"]]]
