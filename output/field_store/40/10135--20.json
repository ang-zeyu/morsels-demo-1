Utter stupidity and dogged courage  are the outstanding characteristics of this type. But fear of the law is  strong within them.    \"Don't arrest me,\" she said. \"I'll tell you.\"    \"Good. In the first place, then, where were you going when I came here?\"    \"To meet my boy at Vauxhall Station.\"    \"What is his name?\"    \"I'm not going to tell you. What's he done?\"    \"He has done murder. What is his name?\"    \"My God!\" whispered the girl, and her face blanched swiftly. \"Murder!  I--I can't tell you his name--\"    \"You mean you won't?\"    She did not answer.    \"He is a very dark man,\" continued Harley \"with black eyes. He is a  Hindu.\"    The girl stared straight before her, dumbly.    \"Answer me!\" shouted Harley.    \"Yes--yes! He is a foreigner.\"    \"A Hindu?\"    \"I think so.\"    \"He was here five minutes ago?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Where was he going to take you?\"    \"I don't know. He said he could put me in a good job out of London. We  had only ten minutes to catch the train. He's gone to get the tickets.\"    \"Where did you meet him?\"    \"In the Green Park.\"    \"When?\"    \"About a month ago.\"    \"Was he going to marry you?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"What did you do to the serviettes on the night Sir Charles died?\"    \"Oh, my God! I didn't do anything to hurt him--I didn't do anything to  hurt him!\"    \"Answer me.\"    \"Sidney--\"    \"Oh, he called himself Sidney, did he? It isn't his name. But go on.\"    \"He asked me to get one of the serviettes, with the ring, and to lend it  to him.\"    \"You did this?\"    \"Yes. But he brought it back.\"    \"When?\"    \"The afternoon--\"    \"Before Sir Charles's death? Yes. Go on. What did he tell you to do with  this serviette?\"    \"It--was in a box. He said I was not to open the box until I put the  serviette on the table, and that it had to be put by Sir Charles's  plate. It had to be put there just before the meal began.\"    \"What else?\"    \"I had to burn the box.\"    \"Well?\"    \"That night I couldn't see how it was to be done. Benson had laid the  dinner table and Mrs. Howett was pottering about. Then, when I thought  I had my chance, Sir Charles sat down in the dining room and began to  read. He was still there and I had the box hidden in the hall stand, all  ready, when Sidney--rang up.\"    \"Rang you up?\"    \"Yes. We had arranged it. He said he was my brother. I had to tell him I  couldn't do it.\"    \"Yes!\"    \"He said: 'You must.' I told him Sir Charles was in the dining room, and  he said: 'I'll get him away. Directly he goes, don't fail to do what I  told you.'\"    \"And then?\"    \"Another 'phone call came--for Sir Charles. I knew who it was, because I  had told Sidney about the case Sir Charles was attending in the square.  When Sir Charles went out I changed the serviettes. Mrs. Howett found me  in the dining room and played hell. But afterward I managed to burn the  box in the kitchen. That's all I know. What harm was there?\"    \"Harm enough!\" said Harley, grimly. \"And now--what was it that 'Sidney'  stole from Sir Charles's bureau in the study?\"    The girl started and bit her lip convulsively. \"It wasn't stealing,\" she  muttered. \"It wasn't worth anything.\"    \"Answer me. What did he take?\"    \"He took nothing.\"    \"For the last time: answer.\"    \"It wasn't Sidney who took it. I took it.\"    \"You took what?\"    \"A paper.\"    \"You mean that you stole Sir Charles's keys and opened his bureau?\"    \"There was no stealing. He was out and they were lying on his dressing  table. Sidney had told me to do it the first time I got a chance.\"    \"What had he told you to do?\"    \"To search through Sir Charles's papers and see if there was anything  with the word 'Fire-Tongue' in it!\"    \"Ah!\" exclaimed Harley, a note of suppressed triumph in his voice. \"Go  on.\"    \"There was only one paper about it,\" continued the girl, now speaking  rapidly, \"or only one that I could find. I put the bureau straight again  and took this paper to Sidney.\"    \"But you must have read the paper?\"    \"Only a bit of it. When I came to the word 'Fire-Tongue,' I didn't read  any more.\"    \"What was it about--the part you did read?\"    \"The beginning was all about India. I couldn't understand it. I jumped  a whole lot. I hadn't much time and I was afraid Mrs. Howett would find  me. Then, further on, I came to 'Fire-Tongue'.\"    \"But what did it say about 'Fire-Tongue'?\"    \"I couldn't make it out, sir. Oh, indeed I'm telling you the truth! It  seemed to me that Fire-Tongue was some sort of mark.\"    \"Mark?\"    \"Yes--a mark Sir Charles had seen in India, and then again in London--\"    \"In London! Where in London?\"    \"On someone's arm.\"    \"What! Tell me the name of this person!\"    \"I can't remember, sir! Oh, truly I can't.\"    \"Was the name mentioned?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Was it Armand?\"    \"No.\"    \"Ormond?\"    \"No.\"    \"Anything like Ormond?\"    The girl shook her head.    \"It was not Ormuz Khan?\"    \"No. I am sure it wasn't.\"    Paul Harley's expression underwent a sudden change. \"Was it Brown?\" he  asked.    She hesitated. \"I believe it did begin with a B,\" she admitted.    \"Was it Brunn?\"    \"No! I remember, sir. It was Brinn!\"    \"Good God!\" muttered Harley. \"Are you sure?\"    \"Quite sure.\"    \"Do you know any one of that name?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"And is this positively all you remember?\"    \"On my oath, it is.\"    \"How often have you seen Sidney since your dismissal?\"    \"I saw him on the morning I left.\"    \"And then not again until to-day?\"    \"No.\"    \"Does he live in London?\"    \"No. He is a valet to a gentleman who lives in the country.\"    \"How do you know?\"    \"He told me.\"    \"What is the name of the place?\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"Once again--what is the name of the place?\"    The girl bit her lip.    \"Answer!\" shouted Harley.    \"I swear, sir,\" cried the girl, beginning suddenly to sob, \"that I don't  know! Oh, please let me go! I swear I have told you all I know!\"    \"Good!\"    Paul Harley glanced at his watch, crossed the room, and opened the door.  He turned. \"You can go now,\" he said. \"But I don't think you will find  Sidney waiting!\"    It wanted only three minutes to midnight, and Innes, rather haggard and  anxious-eyed, was pacing Paul Harley's private office when the 'phone  bell rang. Eagerly he took up the receiver.    \"Hullo!\" came a voice. \"That you, Innes?\"    \"Mr. Harley!\" cried Innes. \"Thank God you are safe! I was growing  desperately anxious!\"    \"I am by no means safe, Innes! I am in one of the tightest corners of  my life! Listen: Get Wessex! If he's off duty, get Burton. Tell him to  bring--\"    The voice ceased.    \"Hullo!--Mr. Harley!\" called Innes. \"Mr. Harley!\"    A faint cry answered him. He distinctly heard the sound of a fall. Then  the other receiver was replaced on the hook.    \"Merciful Heavens!\" whispered Innes. \"What has happened? Where was he  speaking from? What can I do?\"        CHAPTER XIII. NICOL BRINN HAS A VISITOR    It was close upon noon, but Nicol Brinn had not yet left his chambers.  From that large window which overlooked Piccadilly he surveyed the  prospect with dull, lack-lustre eyes. His morning attire was at least as  tightly fitting as that which he favoured in the evening, and now, hands  clasped behind his back and an unlighted cigar held firmly in the left  corner of his mouth, he gazed across the park with a dreamy and vacant  regard. One very familiar with this strange and taciturn man might have  observed that his sallow features looked even more gaunt than usual.  But for any trace of emotion in that stoic face the most expert  physiognomist must have sought in vain.    Behind the motionless figure the Alaskan ermine and Manchurian leopards  stared glassily across the room. The flying lemur continued apparently  to contemplate the idea of swooping upon the head of the tigress where  she crouched upon her near-by pedestal. The death masks grinned; the  Egyptian priestess smiled. And Nicol Brinn, expressionless, watched the  traffic in Piccadilly.    There came a knock at the door.    \"In,\" said Nicol Brinn.    Hoskins, his manservant, entered: \"Detective Inspector Wessex would like  to see you, sir.\"    Nicol Brinn did not turn around. \"In,\" he repeated.    Silently Hoskins retired, and, following a short interval, ushered into  the room a typical detective officer, a Scotland Yard man of the best  type. For Detective Inspector Wessex no less an authority than Paul  Harley had predicted a brilliant future, and since he had attained to  his present rank while still a comparatively young man, the prophecy  of the celebrated private investigator was likely to be realized. Nicol  Brinn turned and bowed in the direction of a large armchair.    \"Pray sit down, Inspector,\" he said.    The high, monotonous voice expressed neither surprise nor welcome, nor  any other sentiment whatever.    Detective Inspector Wessex returned the bow, placed his bowler hat upon  the carpet, and sat down in the armchair. Nicol Brinn seated himself  upon a settee over which was draped a very fine piece of Persian  tapestry, and stared at his visitor with eyes which expressed nothing  but a sort of philosophic stupidity, but which, as a matter of fact,  photographed the personality of the man indelibly upon that keen brain.    Detective Inspector Wessex cleared his throat and did not appear to be  quite at ease.    \"What is it?\" inquired Nicol Brinn, and proceeded to light his cigar.    \"Well, sir,\" said the detective, frankly, \"it's a mighty awkward  business, and I don't know just how to approach it.\"    \"Shortest way,\" drawled Nicol Brinn. \"Don't study me.\"    \"Thanks,\" said Wessex, \"I'll do my best. It's like this\"--he stared  frankly at the impassive face: \"Where is Mr. Paul Harley?\"    Nicol Brinn gazed at the lighted end of his cigar meditatively for a  moment and then replaced it in the right and not in the left corner of  his mouth. Even to the trained eye of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11602"],[0,"The World of Ice (#17)"],[1,"besides, she was ill provided  with the supplies that men deem absolutely indispensable for a winter in  the Arctic Regions, where the cold is so bitterly intense that, after a  prolonged sojourn, men's minds become almost entirely engrossed by two  clamant demands of nature--food and heat. They had only a small quantity  of coal on board, and nothing except a few extra spars that could be  used as a substitute, while the bleak shores afforded neither shrub nor  tree of any kind. Meanwhile, they had a sufficiency of everything they  required for at least two or three months to come, and for the rest, as  Grim said, they had \"stout hearts and strong arms.\"    As soon as it became apparent that they were to winter in the bay, which  the captain named the Bay of Mercy, all further attempt to extricate the  ship was abandoned, and every preparation for spending the winter was  begun and carried out vigorously. It was now that Captain Guy's  qualities as a leader began to be displayed. He knew, from long  experience and observation, that in order to keep up the _morale_ of  any body of men it was absolutely necessary to maintain the strictest  discipline. Indeed, this rule is so universal in its application, that  many men find it advantageous to impose strict rules on themselves in  the regulation of their time and affairs, in order to keep their own  spirits under command. One of the captain's first resolves therefore  was, to call the men together and address them on this subject; and he  seized the occasion of the first Sabbath morning they spent in the Bay  of Mercy, when the crew were assembled for prayers on the quarter-deck,  to speak to them.    Hitherto we have not mentioned the Sabbath day in this story, because,  while at sea, and while struggling with the ice, there was little to  mark it from other days, except the cessation of unnecessary labour, and  the reading of prayers to those who chose to attend; but as necessary  labour preponderated at all times, and the reading of prayers occupied  scarce half-an-hour, there was little _perceptible_ difference between  the Sabbath and any other day. We would not be understood to speak  lightly of this difference. Little though it was in point of time and  appearance, it was immeasurably great in _fact_, as it involved the  great principle that the day of rest ought to be observed, and that the  Creator should be honoured in a special manner on that day.    On the Sabbath in question--and it was an exceedingly bright, peaceful  one--Captain Guy, having read part of the Church of England service as  usual, stood up, and in an earnest, firm tone said:--    \"My lads, I consider it my duty to say a few plain words to you in  reference to our present situation and prospects. I feel that the  responsibility of having brought you here rests very much upon myself,  and I deem it my solemn duty, in more than the ordinary sense, to do all  I can to get you out of the ice again. You know as well as I do that  this is impossible at the present time, and that we are compelled to  spend a winter here. Some of you know what that means, but the most of  you know it only by hearsay, and that's much the same as knowing nothing  about it at all. Before the winter is done your energies and endurance  will probably be taxed to the uttermost. I think it right to be candid  with you. The life before you will not be child's play, but I assure you  that it may be mingled with much that will be pleasant and hearty if you  choose to set about it in the right way. Well, then, to be short about  it. There is no chance whatever of our getting through the winter in  this ship comfortably, or even safely, unless the strictest discipline  is maintained aboard. I know, for I've been in similar circumstances  before, that when cold and hunger, and, it may be, sickness press upon  us--should it please the Almighty to send these on us in great  severity--you will feel duty to be irksome, and you'll think it useless,  and perhaps be tempted to mutiny. Now, I ask you solemnly, while your  minds are clear from all prejudices, each individually to sign a written  code of laws, and a written promise that you will obey the same, and  help me to enforce them even with the punishment of _death_, if need  be. Now, lads, will you agree to that?\"    \"Agreed! agreed!\" cried the men at once, and in a tone of prompt  decision that convinced their leader he had their entire confidence--a  matter of the highest importance in the critical circumstances in which  they were placed.    \"Well, then, I'll read the rules. They are few, but sufficiently  comprehensive:--    \"1st. Prayers shall be read every morning before breakfast, unless  circumstances render it impossible to do so.\"    The captain laid down the paper, and looked earnestly at the men.    \"My lads, I have never felt so strongly as I now do the absolute need we  have of the blessing and guidance of the Almighty, and I am persuaded  that it is our duty as well as our interest to begin, not only the  Sabbath, but _every_ day with prayer.    \"2nd. The ordinary duties of the ship shall be carried on, the watches  regularly set and relieved, regular hours observed, and the details of  duty attended to in the usual way, as when in harbour.    \"3rd. The officers shall take watch and watch about as heretofore,  except when required to do otherwise. The log-books, and meteorological  observations, etc., shall be carried on as usual.    \"4th. The captain shall have supreme and absolute command as when at  sea; but he, on his part, promises that, should any peculiar  circumstance arise in which the safety of the crew or ship shall be  implicated, he will, if the men are so disposed, call a council of the  whole crew, in which case the decision of the majority shall become law,  but the minority, in that event, shall have it in their option to  separate from the majority and carry along with them their share of the  general provisions.    \"5th. Disobedience to orders shall be punishable according to the  decision of a council to be appointed specially for the purpose of  framing a criminal code, hereafter to be submitted for the approval of  the crew.\"    The rules above laid down were signed by every man in the ship. Several  of them could not write, but these affixed a cross (x) at the foot of  the page, against which their names were written by the captain in  presence of witnesses, which answered the same purpose. And from that  time, until events occurred which rendered all such rules unnecessary,  the work of the ship went on pleasantly and well.        CHAPTER X.    _Beginning of winter--Meetuck effects a remarkable change in the men's  appearance--Mossing, and working, and plans for a winter campaign_.      In August the first frost came and formed \"young ice\" on the sea, but  this lasted only for a brief hour or two, and was broken up by the tide  and melted. By the 10th of September the young ice cemented the floes of  last year's ice together, and soon rendered the ice round the ship  immovable. Hummocks clustered round several rocky islets in the  neighbourhood, and the rising and falling of the tide covered the sides  of the rocks with bright crystals. All the feathered tribes took their  departure for less rigorous climes, with the exception of a small white  bird about the size of a sparrow, called the snow-bird, which is the  last to leave the icy North. Then a tremendous storm arose, and the sea  became choked up with icebergs and floes, which the frost soon locked  together into a solid mass. Towards the close of the storm snow fell in  great abundance, and when the mariners ventured again to put their heads  up the opened hatchways, the decks were knee-deep, the drift to windward  was almost level with the bulwarks, every yard was edged with white,  every rope and cord had a light side and a dark, every point and truck  had a white button on it, and every hole, corner, crack, and crevice was  choked up.    The land and the sea were also clothed with this spotless garment, which  is indeed a strikingly appropriate emblem of purity, and the only dark  objects visible in the landscape were those precipices which were too  steep for the snow to lie on, the towering form of the giant flagstaff,  and the leaden clouds that rolled angrily across the sky. But these  leaden clouds soon rolled off, leaving a blue wintry sky and a bright  sun behind.    The storm blew itself out early in the morning, and at breakfast-time on  that day, when the sun was just struggling with the last of the clouds,  Captain Guy remarked to his friends who were seated round the cabin  table, \"Well, gentlemen, we must begin hard work to-day.\"    \"Hard work, captain!\" exclaimed Fred Ellice, pausing for a second or two  in the hard work of chewing a piece of hard salt junk; \"why, what do you  call the work we've been engaged in for the last few weeks?\"    \"Play, my lad; that was only play--just to bring our hands in, before  setting to work in earnest!--What do you think of the health of the men,  doctor?\"    \"Never was better; but I fear the hospital will soon fill if you carry  out your threat in regard to work.\"    \"No fear,\" remarked the second mate; \"the more work the better health  is my experience. Busy men have no time to git seek.\"    \"No doubt of it, sir,\" said the first mate, bolting a large mouthful of  pork. \"Nothing so good for 'em as work.\"    \"There are two against you, doctor,\" said the captain.    \"Then it's two to two,\" cried Fred, as he finished breakfast; \"for I  quite agree with Tom, and with that excellent proverb which says, 'All  work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.'\"    The captain shook his head as he said, \"Of all the nuisances I ever met  with in a ship a semi-passenger is the worst. I think, Fred, I must get  you bound apprentice and give you regular work to do, you  good-for-nothing.\"    We need scarcely say that the captain jested, for "]]]
