But it is evident he could practise very generous  self-denial; and probably the married portion of his existence, supposing  Alessandra's sweet countenance not to have belied her, was happy on both  sides. He was beloved by his family, which is never the case with the  unamiable. Among his friends were most Of the great names of the age,  including a world of ladies, and the whole graceful court of Guidobaldo  da Montefeltro, duke of Urbino, for which Catiglione wrote his book of  the _Gentleman (Il Cortegiano)_. Raphael addressed him a sonnet, and  Titian painted his likeness. He knew Vittoria Colonna, and Veronica da  Gambera, and Giulia Gonzaga (whom the Turks would have run away with),  and Ippolita Sforza, the beautiful blue-stocking, who set Bandello on  writing his novels, and Bembo, and Flaminio, and Berni, and Molza, and  Sannazzaro, and the Medici family, and Vida, and Macchiavelli; and nobody  doubts that he might have shone at the court of Leo the brightest of the  bright. But he thought it \"better to enjoy a little in peace, than seek  after much with trouble.\"[31] He cared for none of the pleasures of the  great, except building, and that he was content to satisfy in Cowley's  fashion, with \"a small house in a large garden.\" He was plain in his  diet, disliked ceremony, and was frequently absorbed in thought. His  indignation was roused by mean and brutal vices; but he took a large and  liberal view of human nature in general; and, if he was somewhat free in  his life, must be pardoned for the custom of the times, for his charity  to others, and for the genial disposition which made him an enchanting  poet. Above all, he was an affectionate son; lived like a friend with his  children; and, in spite of his tendency to pleasure, supplied the place  of an anxious and careful father to his brothers and sisters, who  idolized him.      \"Ornabat pietas et grata modestia vatem,\"    wrote his brother Gabriel,      \"Sancta fides, dictique memor, munitaque recto    Justitia, et nullo patientia victa labore,    Et constans virtus animi, et elementia mitis,    Ambitione procul pulsa fastusque tumore;    Credere uti posses natum felicibus horis,    Felici fulgente astro Jovis atque Diones.\"[32]      Devoted tenderness adorn'd the bard,    And grateful modesty, and grave regard    To his least word, and justice arm'd with right,    And patience counting every labour light,    And constancy of soul, and meekness too,    That neither pride nor worldly wishes knew.    You might have thought him born when there concur    The sweet star and the strong, Venus and Jupiter.    His son Virginio, and others, have left a variety of anecdotes  corroborating points in his character. I shall give them all, for they  put us into his company. It is recorded, as an instance of his reputation  for honesty, that an old kinsman, a clergyman, who was afraid of being  poisoned for his possessions, would trust himself in no other hands; but  the clergyman was his own grand-uncle and namesake, probably godfather;  so that the compliment is not so very great.    In his youth he underwent a long rebuke one day from his father without  saying a word, though a satisfactory answer was in his power; on which  his brother Gabriel expressing his surprise, he said that he was thinking  all the time of a scene in a comedy he was writing, for which the  paternal lecture afforded an excellent study.    He loved gardening better than he understood it; was always shifting  his plants, and destroying the seeds, out of impatience to see them  germinate. He was rejoicing once on the coming up of some \"capers,\" which  he had been visiting every day to see how they got on, when it turned out  that his capers were elder-trees!    He was perpetually altering his verses. His manuscripts are full of  corrections. He wrote the exordium of the _Orlando_ over and over again;  and at last could only be satisfied with it in proportion as it was not  his own; that is to say, in proportion as it came nearer to the beautiful  passage in Dante from which his ear and his feelings had caught it.[33]    He, however, discovered that correction was not always improvement. He  used to say, it was with verses as with trees. A plant naturally well  growing might be made perfect by a little delicate treatment; but  over-cultivation destroyed its native grace. In like manner, you might  perfect a happily-inspired verse by taking away any little fault of  expression; but too great a polish deprived it of the charm of the first  conception. It was like over-training a naturally graceful child. If it  be wondered how he who corrected so much should succeed so well, even to  an appearance of happy negligence, it is to be considered that the most  impulsive writers often put down their thoughts too hastily, then correct  and re-correct them in the same impatient manner; and so have to bring  them round, by as many steps, to the feeling which they really had at  first, though they were too hasty to do it justice.    Ariosto would have altered his house as often as his verses, but did not  find it so convenient. Somebody wondering that he contented himself with  so small an abode, when he built such magnificent mansions in his poetry,  he said it was easier to put words together than blocks of stone.[34]    He liked Virgil; commended the style of Tibullus; did not care for  Propertius; but expressed high approbation of Catullus and Horace. I  suspect his favourite to have been Ovid. His son says he did not study  much, nor look after books; but this may have been in his decline, or  when Virginio first took to observing him. A different conclusion as to  study is to be drawn from the corrected state of his manuscripts, and the  variety of his knowledge; and with regard to books, he not only mentions  the library of the Vatican as one of his greatest temptations to visit  Rome, but describes himself, with all the gusto of a book-worm, as  enjoying them in his chimney-corner.[35]    To intimate his secrecy in love-matters, he had an inkstand with a  Cupid on it, holding a finger on his lips. I believe it is still in  existence.[36] He did not disclose his mistresses' names, as Dante did,  for the purpose of treating them with contempt; nor, on the other hand,  does he appear to have been so indiscriminately gallant as to be fond of  goitres.[37] The only mistress of whom he complained he concealed in a  Latin appellation; and of her he did not complain with scorn. He had  loved, besides Alessandra Benucci, a lady of the name of Ginevra; the  mother of one of his children is recorded as a certain Orsolina; and that  of the other was named Maria, and is understood to have been a governess  in his father's family.[38]    He ate fast, and of whatever was next him, often beginning with the bread  on the table before the dishes came; and he would finish his dinner with  another bit of bread. \"Appetiva le rape,\" says his good son; videlicet,  he was fond of turnips. In his fourth Satire, he mentions as a favourite  dish, turnips seasoned with vinegar and boiled _must_ (sapa), which  seems, not unjustifiably, to startle Mr. Panizzi.[39] He cared so little  for good eating, that he said of himself, he should have done very well  in the days when people lived on acorns.    A stranger coming in one day at the dinner-hour, he ate up what was  provided for both; saying afterwards, when told of it, that the gentleman  should have taken care of himself. This does not look very polite; but of  course it was said in jest. His son attributed this carelessness at table  to absorption in his studies.    He carried this absence of mind so far, and was at the same time so good  a pedestrian, that Virginio tells us he once walked all the way from  Carpi to Ferrara in his slippers, owing to his having strolled out of  doors in that direction.    The same biographers who describe him as a brave soldier, add, that he  was a timid horseman and seaman; and indeed he appears to have eschewed  every kind of unnecessary danger. It was a maxim of his, to be the last  in going out of a boat. I know not what Orlando would have said to this;  but there is no doubt that the good son and brother avoided no pain in  pursuit of his duty. He more than once risked his life in the service of  government from the perils of travelling among war-makers and banditti.  Imagination finds something worthy of itself on great occasions, but is  apt to discover the absurdity of staking existence on small ones. Ariosto  did not care to travel out of Italy. He preferred, he says, going round  the earth in a map; visiting countries without having to pay innkeepers,  and ploughing harmless seas without thunder and lightning[40].    His outward religion, like the one he ascribed to his friend Cardinal  Bembo, was \"that of other people.\" He did not think it of use to disturb  their belief; yet excused rather than blamed Luther, attributing his  heresy to the necessary consequences of mooting points too subtle for  human apprehension[41]. He found it impossible, however, to restrain his  contempt of bigotry; and, like most great writers in Catholic countries,  was a derider of the pretensions of devotees, and the discords and  hypocrisies of the convent. He evidently laughed at Dante's figments  about the other world; not at the poetry of them, for that he admired,  and sometimes imitated, but at the superstition and presumption. He  turned the Florentine's moon into a depository of non-sense; and found no  hell so bad as the hearts of tyrants. The only other people he put into  the infernal regions are ladies who were cruel to their lovers! He had  a noble confidence in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10657"],[0,"\"De Bello Gallico\" and Other Commentaries (#17)"],[1,"passes, but also as a constant possession.    III.--Having received these tidings, Galba, since the works of the  winter quarters and the fortifications were not fully completed, nor was  sufficient preparation made with regard to corn and other provisions  (since, as a surrender had been made, and hostages received, he had  thought he need entertain no apprehension of a war), speedily summoning  a council, began to anxiously inquire their opinions. In which council,  since so much sudden danger had happened contrary to the general  expectation, and almost all the higher places were seen already covered  with a multitude of armed men, nor could [either] troops come to their  relief, or provisions be brought in, as the passes were blocked up [by  the enemy]; safety being now nearly despaired of, some opinions of this  sort were delivered; that, \"leaving their baggage, and making a sally,  they should hasten away for safety by the same routes by which they had  come thither.\" To the greater part, however, it seemed best, reserving  that measure to the last, to await the issue of the matter, and to  defend the camp.    IV.--A short time only having elapsed, so that time was scarcely given  for arranging and executing those things which they had determined on,  the enemy, upon the signal being given, rushed down [upon our men] from  all parts, and discharged stones and darts upon our rampart. Our men at  first, while their strength was fresh, resisted bravely, nor did they  cast any weapon ineffectually from their higher station. As soon as any  part of the camp, being destitute of defenders, seemed to be hard  pressed, thither they ran, and brought assistance. But they were  over-matched in this, that the enemy when wearied by the long continuance  of the battle, went out of the action, and others with fresh strength  came in their place; none of which things could be done by our men, owing  to the smallness of their number; and not only was permission not given  to the wearied [Roman] to retire from the fight, but not even to the  wounded [was liberty granted] to quit the post where he had been  stationed, and recover.    V.--When they had now been fighting for more than six hours, without  cessation, and not only strength, but even weapons were failing our men,  and the enemy were pressing on more rigorously, and had begun to  demolish the rampart and to fill up the trench, while our men were  becoming exhausted, and the matter was now brought to the last  extremity, P. Sextius Baculus, a centurion of the first rank, whom we  have related to have been disabled by severe wounds in the engagement  with the Nervii, and also C. Volusenus, a tribune of the soldiers, a man  of great skill and valour, hasten to Galba, and assure him that the only  hope of safety lay in making a sally, and trying the last resource.  Whereupon, assembling the centurions, he quickly gives orders to the  soldiers to discontinue the fight a short time, and only collect the  weapons flung [at them], and recruit themselves after their fatigue, and  afterwards, upon the signal being given, sally forth from the camp, and  place in their valour all their hope of safety.    VI.--They do what they were ordered; and, making a sudden sally from all  the gates [of the camp], leave the enemy the means neither of knowing  what was taking place, nor of collecting themselves. Fortune thus taking  a turn, [our men] surround on every side, and slay those who had  entertained the hope of gaining the camp, and having killed more than  the third part of an army of more than 30,000 men (which number of the  barbarians it appeared certain had come up to our camp), put to flight  the rest when panic-stricken, and do not suffer them to halt even upon  the higher grounds. All the forces of the enemy being thus routed, and  stripped of their arms, [our men] betake themselves to their camp and  fortifications. Which battle being finished, inasmuch as Galba was  unwilling to tempt fortune again, and remembered that he had come into  winter quarters with one design, and saw that he had met with a  different state of affairs; chiefly however urged by the want of corn  and provision, having the next day burned all the buildings of that  village, he hastens to return into the province; and as no enemy opposed  or hindered his march, he brought the legion safe into the [country of  the] Nantuates, thence into [that of] the Allobroges, and there  wintered.    VII.--These things being achieved, while Caesar had every reason to  suppose that Gaul was reduced to a state of tranquillity, the Belgae  being overcome, the Germans expelled, the Seduni among the Alps  defeated, and when he had, therefore, in the beginning of winter, set  out for Illyricum, as he wished to visit those nations, and acquire a  knowledge of their countries, a sudden war sprang up in Gaul. The  occasion of that war was this: P. Crassus, a young man, had taken up his  winter quarters with the seventh legion among the Andes, who border upon  the [Atlantic] ocean. He, as there was a scarcity of corn in those  parts, sent out some officers of cavalry and several military tribunes  amongst the neighbouring states, for the purpose of procuring corn and  provision; in which number T. Terrasidius was sent amongst the Esubii;  M. Trebius Gallus amongst the Curiosolitae; Q. Velanius, with T. Silius,  amongst the Veneti.    VIII.--The influence of this state is by far the most considerable of  any of the countries on the whole sea coast, because the Veneti both  have a very great number of ships, with which they have been accustomed  to sail to Britain, and [thus] excel the rest in their knowledge and  experience of nautical affairs; and as only a few ports lie scattered  along that stormy and open sea, of which they are in possession, they  hold as tributaries almost all those who are accustomed to traffic in  that sea. With them arose the beginning [of the revolt] by their  detaining Silius and Velanius; for they thought that they should recover  by their means the hostages which they had given to Crassus. The  neighbouring people, led on by their influence (as the measures of the  Gauls are sudden and hasty), detain Trebius and Terrasidius for the same  motive; and quickly sending ambassadors, by means of their leading men,  they enter into a mutual compact to do nothing except by general  consent, and abide the same issue of fortune; and they solicit the other  states to choose rather to continue in that liberty which they had  received from their ancestors, than endure slavery under the Romans. All  the sea coast being quickly brought over to their sentiments, they send  a common embassy to P. Crassus [to say], \"If he wished to receive back  his officers, let him send back to them their hostages.\"    IX.--Caesar, being informed of these things by Crassus, since he was so  far distant himself, orders ships of war to be built in the meantime on  the river Loire, which flows into the ocean; rowers to be raised from  the province; sailors and pilots to be provided. These matters being  quickly executed, he himself, as soon as the season of the year permits,  hastens to the army. The Veneti, and the other states also, being  informed of Caesar's arrival, when they reflected how great a crime they  had committed, in that the ambassadors (a character which had amongst  all nations ever been sacred and inviolable) had by them been detained  and thrown into prison, resolve to prepare for a war in proportion to  the greatness of their danger, and especially to provide those things  which appertain to the service of a navy; with the greater confidence,  inasmuch as they greatly relied on the nature of their situation. They  knew that the passes by land were cut off by estuaries, that the  approach by sea was most difficult, by reason of our ignorance of the  localities, [and] the small number of the harbours, and they trusted  that our army would not be able to stay very long among them, on account  of the insufficiency of corn; and again, even if all these things should  turn out contrary to their expectation, yet they were very powerful in  their navy. They, well understood that the Romans neither had any number  of ships, nor were acquainted with the shallows, the harbours, or the  islands of those parts where they would have to carry on the war; and  that navigation was very different in a narrow sea from what it was in  the vast and open ocean. Having come to this resolution, they fortify  their towns, convey corn into them from the country parts, bring  together as many ships as possible to Venetia, where it appeared Caesar  would at first carry on the war. They unite to themselves as allies for  that war, the Osismii, the Lexovii, the Nannetes, the Ambiliati, the  Morini, the Diablintes, and the Menapii; and send for auxiliaries from  Britain, which is situated over against those regions.    X.--There were these difficulties which we have mentioned above, in  carrying on the war, but many things, nevertheless, urged Caesar to that  war; the open insult offered to the state in the detention of the Roman  knights, the rebellion raised after surrendering, the revolt after  hostages were given, the confederacy of so many states, but principally,  lest if [the conduct of] this part was overlooked, the other nations  should think that the same thing was permitted them. Wherefore, since he  reflected that almost all the Gauls were fond of revolution, and easily  and quickly excited to war; that all men likewise, by nature, love  liberty and hate the condition of slavery, he thought he ought to divide  and more widely distribute his army, before more states should join the  confederation.    XI.--He therefore sends T. Labienus, his lieutenant, with the cavalry to  the Treviri, who are nearest to the river Rhine. He charges him to visit  the Remi and the other Belgians, and to keep them in their allegiance  and"]]]
