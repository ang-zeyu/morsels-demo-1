Does this clearing out have to be done on a Sunday?\"  K. did not look up  at Mrs. Grubach, but he saw nonetheless that she seemed to feel some  relief as she breathed in.  Even sharp questions like this from Mr. K.  she perceived as forgiveness, or as the beginning of forgiveness.  \"We're not clearing anything out, Mr. K.,\" she said, \"it's just that  Miss Montag is moving in with Miss Buerstner and is moving her things  across.\"  She said nothing more, but just waited to see how K. would  take it and whether he would allow her to carry on speaking.  But K.  kept her in uncertainty, took the spoon and pensively stirred his coffee  while he remained silent.  Then he looked up at her and said, \"What  about the suspicions you had earlier about Miss Buerstner, have you given  them up?\"  \"Mr. K.,\" called Mrs. Grubach, who had been waiting for this  very question, as she put her hands together and held them out towards  him.  \"I just made a chance remark and you took it so badly.  I didn't  have the slightest intention of offending anyone, not you or anyone  else.  You've known me for long enough, Mr. K., I'm sure you're  convinced of that.  You don't know how I've been suffering for the past  few days!  That I should tell lies about my tenants!  And you, Mr. K.,  you believed it!  And said I should give you notice!  Give you notice!\"  At this last outcry, Mrs. Grubach was already choking back her tears,  she raised her apron to her face and blubbered out loud.            \"Oh, don't cry Mrs. Grubach,\" said K., looking out the window, he  was thinking only of Miss Buerstner and how she was accepting an unknown  girl into her room.  \"Now don't cry,\" he said again as he turned his  look back into the room where Mrs. Grubach was still crying.  \"I meant  no harm either when I said that.  It was simply a misunderstanding  between us.  That can happen even between old friends sometimes.\"  Mrs.  Grubach pulled her apron down to below her eyes to see whether K. really  was attempting a reconciliation.  \"Well, yes, that's how it is,\" said  K., and as Mrs. Grubach's behaviour indicated that the captain had said  nothing he dared to add, \"Do you really think, then, that I'd want to  make an enemy of you for the sake of a girl we hardly know?\" \"Yes,  you're quite right, Mr. K.,\" said Mrs. Grubach, and then, to her  misfortune, as soon as she felt just a little freer to speak, she added  something rather inept.  \"I kept asking myself why it was that Mr. K.  took such an interest in Miss Buerstner.  Why does he quarrel with me  over her when he knows that any cross word from him and I can't sleep  that night?  And I didn't say anything about Miss Buerstner that I hadn't  seen with my own eyes.\"  K. said nothing in reply, he should have chased  her from the room as soon as she had opened her mouth, and he didn't  want to do that.  He contented himself with merely drinking his coffee  and letting Mrs. Grubach feel that she was superfluous.  Outside, the  dragging steps of Miss Montag could still be heard as she went from one  side of the hallway to the other.  \"Do you hear that?\" asked K. pointing  his hand at the door.  \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Grubach with a sigh, \"I wanted  to give her some help and I wanted the maid to help her too but she's  stubborn, she wants to move everything in herself.  I wonder at Miss  Buerstner.  I often feel it's a burden for me to have Miss Montag as a  tenant but Miss Buerstner accepts her into her room with herself.\"  \"There's nothing there for you to worry about\" said K., crushing the  remains of a sugar lump in his cup.  \"Does she cause you any trouble?\"  \"No,\" said Mrs. Grubach, \"in itself it's very good to have her there, it  makes another room free for me and I can let my nephew, the captain,  occupy it.  I began to worry he might be disturbing you when I had to  let him live in the living room next to you over the last few days.  He's not very considerate.\"  \"What an idea!\" said K. standing up,  \"there's no question of that.  You seem to think that because I can't  stand this to-ing and fro-ing of Miss Montag that I'm over-sensitive -  and there she goes back again.\"  Mrs. Grubach appeared quite powerless.  \"Should I tell her to leave moving the rest of her things over till  later, then, Mr. K.?  If that's what you want I'll do it immediately.\"  \"But she has to move in with Miss Buerstner!\" said K.  \"Yes,\" said Mrs.  Grubach, without quite understanding what K. meant.  \"So she has to take  her things over there.\"  Mrs. Grubach just nodded.  K. was irritated all  the more by this dumb helplessness which, seen from the outside, could  have seemed like a kind of defiance on her part.  He began to walk up  and down the room between the window and the door, thus depriving Mrs.  Grubach of the chance to leave, which she otherwise probably would have  done.            Just as K. once more reached the door, someone knocked at it.  It  was the maid, to say that Miss Montag would like to have a few words  with Mr. K., and therefore requested that he come to the dining room  where she was waiting for him.  K. heard the maid out thoughtfully, and  then looked back at the shocked Mrs. Grubach in a way that was almost  contemptuous.  His look seemed to be saying that K. had been expecting  this invitation for Miss Montag for a long time, and that it was  confirmation of the suffering he had been made to endure that Sunday  morning from Mrs. Grubach's tenants.  He sent the maid back with the  reply that he was on his way, then he went to the wardrobe to change his  coat, and in answer to Mrs. Grubach's gentle whining about the nuisance  Miss Montag was causing merely asked her to clear away the breakfast  things.  \"But you've hardly touched it,\" said Mrs. Grubach.  \"Oh just  take it away!\" shouted K.  It seemed to him that Miss Montag was mixed  up in everything and made it repulsive to him.            As he went through the hallway he looked at the closed door of  Miss Buerstner's room.  But it wasn't there that he was invited, but the  dining room, to which he yanked the door open without knocking.            The room was long but narrow with one window.  There was only  enough space available to put two cupboards at an angle in the corner by  the door, and the rest of the room was entirely taken up with the long  dining table which started by the door and reached all the way to the  great window, which was thus made almost inaccessible.  The table was  already laid for a large number of people, as on Sundays almost all the  tenants ate their dinner here at midday.            When K. entered, Miss Montag came towards him from the window  along one side of the table.  They greeted each other in silence.  Then  Miss Montag, her head unusually erect as always, said, \"I'm not sure  whether you know me.\"  K. looked at her with a frown.  \"Of course I do,\"  he said, \"you've been living here with Mrs. Grubach for quite some time  now.\"  \"But I get the impression you don't pay much attention to what's  going on in the lodging house,\"  said Miss Montag.  \"No,\" said K.  \"Would you not like to sit down?\" said Miss Montag.  In silence, the two  of them drew chairs out from the farthest end of the table and sat down  facing each other.  But Miss Montag stood straight up again as she had  left her handbag on the window sill and went to fetch it; she shuffled  down the whole length of the room.  When she came back, the handbag  lightly swinging, she said, \"I'd like just to have a few words with you  on behalf of my friend.  She would have come herself, but she's feeling  a little unwell today.  Perhaps you'll be kind enough to forgive her and  listen to me instead.  There's anyway nothing that she could have said  that I won't.  On the contrary, in fact, I think I can say even more  than her because I'm relatively impartial.  Would you not agree?\"  \"What  is there to say, then?\" answered K., who was tired of Miss Montag  continuously watching his lips.  In that way she took control of what he  wanted to say before he said it.  \"Miss Buerstner clearly refuses to  grant me the personal meeting that I asked her for.\"  \"That's how it  is,\" said Miss Montag, \"or rather, that's not at all how it is, the way  you put it is remarkably severe.  Generally speaking, meetings are  neither granted nor the opposite.  But it can be that meetings are  considered unnecessary, and that's how it is here.  Now, after your  comment, I can speak openly.  You asked my friend, verbally or in  writing, for the chance to speak with her.  Now my friend is aware of  your reasons for asking for this meeting - or at least I suppose she is  - and so, for reasons I know nothing about, she is quite sure that it  would be of no benefit to anyone if this meeting actually took place.  Moreover, it was only yesterday, and only very briefly, that she made it  clear to me that such a meeting could be of no benefit for yourself  either, she feels that it can only have been a matter of chance that  such an idea came to you, and that even without any explanations from  her, you will very soon come to realise yourself, if you have not done  so already, the futility of your idea.  My answer to that is that  although it may be quite right, I consider it advantageous, if the  matter is to be made perfectly clear, to give you an explicit answer.  I  offered my services in taking on the task, and after some hesitation my  friend conceded.  I hope, however, also to have acted in your interests,  as even the slightest uncertainty in the least significant of matters  will always remain a cause of suffering and if, as in this case, it can  be removed without substantial effort, then it is better if that is done"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7853"],[0,"Quentin Durward (#16)"],[1,"young Durward  still farther insight into the duties of humanity towards others;  and considering the ignorance of the period, the general prejudices  entertained in favour of a military life, and the manner in which he  himself had been bred, the youth was disposed to feel more accurately  the moral duties incumbent on his station than was usual at the time.    He reflected on his interview with his uncle with a sense of  embarrassment and disappointment. His hopes had been high; for although  intercourse by letters was out of the question, yet a pilgrim, or an  adventurous trafficker, or a crippled soldier sometimes brought Lesly's  name to Glen Houlakin, and all united in praising his undaunted courage,  and his success in many petty enterprises which his master had intrusted  to him. Quentin's imagination had filled up the sketch in his own way,  and assimilated his successful and adventurous uncle (whose exploits  probably lost nothing in the telling) to some of the champions and  knights errant of whom minstrels sung and who won crowns and kings'  daughters by dint of sword and lance. He was now compelled to rank his  kinsman greatly lower in the scale of chivalry; but, blinded by the high  respect paid to parents and those who approach that character--moved  by every early prejudice in his favour--inexperienced besides, and  passionately attached to his mother's memory, he saw not, in the only  brother of that dear relation, the character he truly held, which was  that of an ordinary mercenary soldier, neither much worse nor greatly  better than many of the same profession whose presence added to the  distracted state of France.    Without being wantonly cruel, Le Balafre was, from habit, indifferent  to human life and human suffering; he was profoundly ignorant, greedy of  booty, unscrupulous how he acquired it, and profuse in expending it on  the gratification of his passions. The habit of attending exclusively  to his own wants and interests had converted him into one of the most  selfish animals in the world; so that he was seldom able, as the reader  may have remarked, to proceed far in any subject without considering  how it applied to himself, or, as it is called, making the case his own,  though not upon feelings connected with the golden rule, but such as  were very different. To this must be added that the narrow round of  his duties and his pleasures had gradually circumscribed his thoughts,  hopes, and wishes, and quenched in a great measure the wild spirit of  honour, and desire of distinction in arms, by which his youth had been  once animated.    Balafre was, in short, a keen soldier, hardened, selfish, and narrow  minded; active and bold in the discharge of his duty, but acknowledging  few objects beyond it, except the formal observance of a careless  devotion, relieved by an occasional debauch with brother Boniface, his  comrade and confessor. Had his genius been of a more extended character,  he would probably have been promoted to some important command, for the  King, who knew every soldier of his bodyguard personally, reposed much  confidence in Balafre's courage and fidelity; and besides, the Scot had  either wisdom or cunning enough perfectly to understand, and ably  to humour, the peculiarities of that sovereign. Still, however, his  capacity was too much limited to admit of his rising to higher rank,  and though smiled on and favoured by Louis on many occasions, Balafre  continued a mere Life Guardsman, or Scottish Archer.    Without seeing the full scope of his uncle's character, Quentin felt  shocked at his indifference to the disastrous extirpation of his brother  in law's whole family, and could not help being surprised, moreover,  that so near a relative had not offered him the assistance of his purse,  which, but for the generosity of Maitre Pierre, he would have been  under the necessity of directly craving from him. He wronged his uncle,  however, in supposing that this want of attention to his probable  necessities was owing to avarice. Not precisely needing money himself at  that moment, it had not occurred to Balafre that his nephew might be in  exigencies; otherwise, he held a near kinsman so much a part of himself,  that he would have provided for the weal of the living nephew, as he  endeavoured to do for that of his deceased sister and her husband. But  whatever was the motive, the neglect was very unsatisfactory to young  Durward, and he wished more than once he had taken service with the Duke  of Burgundy before he quarrelled with his forester. \"Whatever had then  become of me,\" he thought to himself, \"I should always have been able to  keep up my spirits with the reflection that I had, in case of the worst,  a stout back friend in this uncle of mine. But now I have seen him, and,  woe worth him, there has been more help in a mere mechanical stranger,  than I have found in my own mother's brother, my countryman and a  cavalier! One would think the slash, that has carved all comeliness out  of his face, had let at the same time every drop of gentle blood out of  his body.\"    Durward now regretted he had not had an opportunity to mention Maitre  Pierre to Le Balafre, in the hope of obtaining some farther account  of that personage; but his uncle's questions had followed fast on each  other, and the summons of the great bell of Saint Martin of Tours had  broken off their conference rather suddenly. That old man, he thought  to himself, was crabbed and dogged in appearance, sharp and scornful in  language, but generous and liberal in his actions; and such a stranger  is worth a cold kinsman.    \"What says our old Scottish proverb?--'Better kind fremit, than fremit  kindred.' ['Better kind strangers than estranged kindred.' The motto is  engraved on a dirk, belonging to a person who had but too much reason to  choose such a device. It was left by him to my father. The weapon is now  in my possession. S.] I will find out that man, which, methinks, should  be no difficult task, since he is so wealthy as mine host bespeaks him.  He will give me good advice for my governance, at least; and if he goes  to strange countries, as many such do, I know not but his may be as  adventurous a service as that of those Guards of Louis.\"    As Quentin framed this thought, a whisper from those recesses of the  heart in which lies much that the owner does not know of, or will  not acknowledge willingly, suggested that, perchance, the lady of the  turret, she of the veil and lute, might share that adventurous journey.  As the Scottish youth made these reflections, he met two grave looking  men, apparently citizens of Tours, whom, doffing his cap with the  reverence due from youth to age, he respectfully asked to direct him to  the house of Maitre Pierre.    \"The house of whom, my fair son?\" said one of the passengers.    \"Of Maitre Pierre, the great silk merchant, who planted all the mulberry  trees in the park yonder,\" said Durward.    \"Young man,\" said one of them who was nearest to him, \"you have taken up  an idle trade a little too early.\"    \"And have chosen wrong subjects to practise your fooleries upon,\"  said the farther one, still more gruffly. \"The Syndic of Tours is  not accustomed to be thus talked to by strolling jesters from foreign  parts.\"    Quentin was so much surprised at the causeless offence which these two  decent looking persons had taken at a very simple and civil question,  that he forgot to be angry at the rudeness of their reply, and stood  staring after them as they walked on with amended pace, often looking  back at him, as if they were desirous to get as soon as possible out of  his reach.    He next met a party of vine dressers, and addressed to them the same  question; and in reply, they demanded to know whether he wanted Maitre  Pierre, the schoolmaster? or Maitre Pierre, the carpenter? or Maitre  Pierre, the beadle? or half a dozen of Maitre Pierres besides. When none  of these corresponded with the description of the person after whom he  inquired, the peasants accused him of jesting with them impertinently,  and threatened to fall upon him and beat him, in guerdon of his  raillery. The oldest amongst them, who had some influence over the rest,  prevailed on them to desist from violence.    \"You see by his speech and his fool's cap,\" said he, \"that he is one  of the foreign mountebanks who are come into the country, and whom some  call magicians and soothsayers, and some jugglers, and the like, and  there is no knowing what tricks they have amongst them. I have heard of  such a one's paying a liard [a small copper coin worth a quarter of a  cent, current in France in the fifteenth century.] to eat his bellyfull  of grapes in a poor man's vineyard; and he ate as many as would have  loaded a wain, and never undid a button of his jerkin--and so let him  pass quietly, and keep his way, as we will keep ours.--And you, friend,  if you would shun worse, walk quietly on, in the name of God, our Lady  of Marmoutier, and Saint Martin of Tours, and trouble us no more about  your Maitre Pierre, which may be another name for the devil, for aught  we know.\"    The Scot finding himself much the weaker party, judged it his Wisest  course to walk on without reply; but the peasants, who at first shrunk  from him in horror, at his supposed talents for sorcery and grape  devouring, took heart of grace as he got to a distance, and having  uttered a few cries and curses, finally gave them emphasis with a shower  of stones, although at such a distance as to do little or no harm to the  object of their displeasure. Quentin, as he pursued his walk, began to  think, in his turn, either that he himself lay under a spell, or that  the people of Touraine were the most stupid, brutal, and inhospitable of  the French peasants. The next incident which came under his observation  did not tend to diminish this opinion.    On a slight eminence, rising above the rapid and"]]]
