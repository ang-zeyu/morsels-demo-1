It was impossible for me to accept  the abrupt conclusion of the adventure, and, in spite of myself, I  mused with some melancholy on the sad fate of certain men who appear  and disappear in this world like the grass of the field, without  leaving the least memory or the least regret.    \"Cousin,\" I resumed, \"how far may it be from here to the ruins of  Geierstein?\"    \"Twenty minutes' walk at the most. Why?\"    \"Because I should like to see them.\"    \"You know that we have a meeting of the municipal council, and that I  can't accompany you.\"    \"Oh! I can find them by myself.\"    \"No, the rural guard will show you the way; he has nothing better to  do.\"    And my worthy cousin, having rapped on his glass, called his servant:    \"Katel, go and find Hans Goerner--let him hurry, and get here by two  o'clock. I must be going.\"    The servant went out and the rural guard was not tardy in coming.    He was directed to take me to the ruins.    While the burgomaster proceeded gravely toward the hall of the  municipal council, we were already climbing the hill. Hans Goerner,  with a wave of the hand, indicated the remains of the aqueduct. At the  same moment the rocky ribs of the plateau, the blue distances of  Hundsrueck, the sad crumbling walls covered with somber ivy, the tolling  of the Hirschwiller bell summoning the notables to the council, the  rural guardsman panting and catching at the brambles--assumed in my  eyes a sad and severe tinge, for which I could not account: it was the  story of the hanged man which took the color out of the prospect.    The cistern staircase struck me as being exceedingly curious, with its  elegant spiral. The bushes bristling in the fissures at every step, the  deserted aspect of its surroundings, all harmonized with my sadness. We  descended, and soon the luminous point of the opening, which seemed to  contract more and more, and to take the shape of a star with curved  rays, alone sent us its pale light. When we attained the very bottom of  the cistern, we found a superb sight was to be had of all those steps,  lighted from above and cutting off their shadows with marvelous  precision. I then heard the hum of which I have already spoken: the  immense granite conch had as many echoes as stones!    \"Has nobody been down here since the little man?\" I asked the rural  guardsman.    \"No, sir. The peasants are afraid. They imagine that the hanged man  will return.\"    \"And you?\"    \"I--oh, I'm not curious.\"    \"But the justice of the peace? His duty was to--\"    \"Ha! What could he have come to the _Owl's Ear_ for?\"    \"They call this the _Owl's Ear_?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"That's pretty near it,\" said I, raising my eyes. \"This reversed vault  forms the _pavilion_ well enough; the under side of the steps makes the  covering of the _tympanum_, and the winding of the staircase the  _cochlea_, the _labyrinth_, and _vestibule_ of the ear. That is the  cause of the murmur which we hear: we are at the back of a colossal  ear.\"    \"It's very likely,\" said Hans Goerner, who did not seem to have  understood my observations.    We started up again, and I had ascended the first steps when I felt  something crush under my foot; I stopped to see what it could be, and  at that moment perceived a white object before me. It was a torn sheet  of paper. As for the hard object, which I had felt grinding up, I  recognized it as a sort of glazed earthenware jug.    \"Aha!\" I said to myself; \"this may clear up the burgomaster's story.\"    I rejoined Hans Goerner, who was now waiting for me at the edge of the  pit.    \"Now, sir,\" cried he, \"where would you like to go?\"    \"First, let's sit down for a while. We shall see presently.\"    I sat down on a large stone, while the rural guard cast his falcon  eyes over the village to see if there chanced to be any trespassers in  the gardens. I carefully examined the glazed vase, of which nothing  but splinters remained. These fragments presented the appearance of a  funnel, lined with wool. It was impossible for me to perceive its  purpose. I then read the piece of a letter, written in an easy running  and firm hand. I transcribe it here below, word for word. It seems to  follow the other half of the sheet, for which I looked vainly all  about the ruins:    \"My _micracoustic_ ear trumpet thus has the double advantage of  infinitely multiplying the intensity of sounds, and of introducing  them into the ear without causing the observer the least discomfort.  You would never have imagined, dear master, the charm which one feels  in perceiving these thousands of imperceptible sounds which are  confounded, on a fine summer day, in an immense murmuring. The  bumble-bee has his song as well as the nightingale, the honey-bee is  the warbler of the mosses, the cricket is the lark of the tall grass,  the maggot is the wren--it has only a sigh, but the sigh is melodious!    \"This discovery, from the point of view of sentiment, which makes us  live in the universal life, surpasses in its importance all that I  could say on the matter.    \"After so much suffering, privations, and weariness, how happy it makes  one to reap the rewards of all his labors! How the soul soars toward  the divine Author of all these microscopic worlds, the magnificence of  which is revealed to us! Where now are the long hours of anguish,  hunger, contempt, which overwhelmed us before? Gone, sir, gone! Tears  of gratitude moisten our eyes. One is proud to have achieved, through  suffering, new joys for humanity and to have contributed to its mental  development. But howsoever vast, howsoever admirable may be the first  fruits of my _micracoustic_ ear trumpet, these do not delimit its  advantages. There are more positive ones, more material, and ones which  may be expressed in figures.    \"Just as the telescope brought the discovery of myriads of worlds  performing their harmonious revolutions in infinite space--so also will  my _micracoustic_ ear trumpet extend the sense of the unbearable beyond  all possible bounds. Thus, sir, the circulation of the blood and the  fluids of the body will not give me pause; you shall hear them flow  with the impetuosity of cataracts; you shall perceive them so  distinctly as to startle you; the slightest irregularity of the pulse,  the least obstacle, is striking, and produces the same effect as a rock  against which the waves of a torrent are dashing!    \"It is doubtless an immense conquest in the development of our  knowledge of physiology and pathology, but this is not the point on  which I would emphasize. Upon applying your ear to the ground, sir, you  may hear the mineral waters springing up at immeasurable depths; you  may judge of their volume, their currents, and the obstacles which they  meet!    \"Do you wish to go further? Enter a subterranean vault which is so  constructed as to gather a quantity of loud sounds; then at night when  the world sleeps, when nothing will be confused with the interior  noises of our globe--listen!    \"Sir, all that it is possible for me to tell you at the present  moment--for in the midst of my profound misery, of my privations, and  often of my despair, I am left only a few lucid instants to pursue my  geological observations--all that I can affirm is that the seething of  glow worms, the explosions of boiling fluids, is something terrifying  and sublime, which can only be compared to the impression of the  astronomer whose glass fathoms depths of limitless extent.    \"Nevertheless, I must avow that these impressions should be studied  further and classified in a methodical manner, in order that definite  conclusions may be derived therefrom. Likewise, as soon as you shall  have deigned, dear and noble master, to transmit the little sum for use  at Neustadt as I asked, to supply my first needs, we shall see our way  to an understanding in regard to the establishment of three great  subterranean observatories, one in the valley of Catania, another in  Iceland, then a third in Capac-Uren, Songay, or Cayembe-Uren, the  deepest of the Cordilleras, and consequently--\"    Here the letter stopped.    I let my hands fall in stupefaction. Had I read the conceptions of an  idiot--or the inspirations of a genius which had been realized? What am  I to say? to think? So this man, this miserable creature, living at the  bottom of a burrow like a fox, dying of hunger, had had perhaps one of  those inspirations which the Supreme Being sends on earth to enlighten  future generations!    And this man had hanged himself in disgust, despair! No one had  answered his prayer, though he asked only for a crust of bread in  exchange for his discovery. It was horrible. Long, long I sat there  dreaming, thanking Heaven for having limited my intelligence to the  needs of ordinary life--for not having desired to make me a superior  man in the community of martyrs. At length the rural guardsman, seeing  me with fixed gaze and mouth agape, made so bold as to touch me on the  shoulder.    \"Mr. Christian,\" said he, \"see--it's getting late--the burgomaster must  have come back from the council.\"    \"Ha! That's a fact,\" cried I, crumpling up the paper, \"come on.\"    We descended the hill.    My worthy cousin met me, with a smiling face, at the threshold of his  house.    \"Well! well! Christian, so you've found no trace of the imbecile who  hanged himself?\"    \"No.\"    \"I thought as much. He was some lunatic who escaped from Stefansfeld or  somewhere--Faith, he did well to hang himself. When one is good for  nothing, that's the simplest way for it.\"    The following day I left Hirschwiller. I shall never return.        _The Invisible Eye_      About this time (said Christian), poor as a church mouse, I took refuge  in the roof of an old house in Minnesaenger Street, Nuremberg, and made  my nest in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12774"],[0,"Dave Darrin's First Year at Annapolis (#17)"],[1,"kel, was Mr. Darrin's bed turned down and in its present  disordered state when you entered the room?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"You declare this on your honor as a midshipman and gentleman?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" lied the unabashed Henkel.    \"Was Mr. Darrin's washbowl in its present untidy state?\"    \"I don't know, sir.  I didn't notice that.\"    \"Very good, Mr. Henkel.  Go to your room and remain there in close  arrest.  Do not leave your room, except by orders or proper permission,  sir.\"    \"Very good, sir,\" replied Henkel, saluting.  Then, his face still  a ghastly hue, he turned and marched from the room, not venturing,  under the eyes of the O.C., to look at either Farley or Page.    When the sections came marching back from math.  Lieutenant Nettleson  stood outside the door of his office.    \"Mr. Darrin!\" called the O.C.  And, a moment later, \"Mr. Dalzell!\"    Both wondering midshipmen approached the officer in charge for the  day at Bancroft Hall, and saluted.    \"Mr. Darrin,\" stated Lieutenant Nettleson, \"you and your roommate  may go to your room to leave your books.  In the room you will  find some evidences of disorder.  Do not attempt to set them straight.  As soon as you have left your books return to me.\"    \"And I also, sir?\" queried Dan, saluting.    \"You, also, Mr. Dalzell,\" replied the officer.    \"Now, has this thing broken loose again?\" groaned Dave Darrin, as the  two chums hurried below.    \"It seems as if it ought to stop some time,\" gasped Dalzell.    \"It will, and soon,\" gritted Darrin.  \"In a very short time, now,  I shall certainly have the full course of two hundred demerits.  Great--Scott!\"    For now the two chums were in their room, and saw the full extent of  the mischief there.  \"I guess I may as well wire home to Gridley for  the price of my return ticket,\" hinted Dave bitterly.    \"Don't do anything of the sort,\" urged Dan, though with but little  hope in his voice.  \"You may still have a margin of ten or fifteen  dems. left to hold you on.\"    \"We're under orders, Danny boy, to report back to the O.C.\"    \"O.K.\"    \"Come along, then.\"    In the office of the officer in charge stood Midshipmen Farley and  Page.  Just after Dave and Dan entered Henkel came in, accompanied  Midshipman Hawkins, the cadet officer of day.    It was an actually ferocious gaze that Henkel turned upon Darrin.  In that same instant Dave believed that a great light had broken in  upon his mind.    \"Mr. Hawkins,\" requested the O.C., \"ascertain whether the commandant  of midshipmen can see us now.\"    Saluting, the cadet officer of the day passed out of the room, very  prim and erect, his white gloves of duty a very conspicuous part of  his uniform.    In a few moments, he returned, raising his right, white-gloved hand  to the visor of his cap.    \"The commandant of midshipmen is ready, sir.\"    \"Come with me, then,\" directed Lieutenant Nettleson, who had already  risen to receive the cadet officer's report.    The O.C. led the way into the office of Commander Jephson, U.S. Navy,  the commandant of midshipmen.    \"This, Mr. Nettleson, I understand, relates to Mr. Darrin's late  apparent course in matters of discipline?\" inquired Commander  Jephson.    The commandant of midshipmen, who was middle-aged and slightly  bald, removed his eye-glasses, holding them poised in his right  hand while he gazed calmly at Mr. Nettleson.    \"Yes, sir.  This is the matter,\" replied the O.C., saluting his  superior.    Commander Jephson had, usually, a manner of slow and gentle speech.  He impressed one, at first sight, as being a man lacking in \"ginger,\"  which was a great mistake, as many a midshipman had found to his  cost.    The commandant of cadets, however, did not believe in becoming  excited or excitable until the occasion arose.    \"Be good enough to make your statement, Mr. Nettleson,\" requested  Commander Jephson.    Consulting a slip of paper that he held in his left hand the younger  Naval officer recounted the previous instances in which Midshipman  Darrin, fourth class, U.S. Naval Academy, had been found delinquent  in that he had slighted the care of his equipment or of his room.    Having made this preliminary statement, the officer in charge now  came down to the doings of the present day.    Midshipman Henkel kept his gaze fixed on Lieutenant Nettleson's face.  Henkel's bearing was almost arrogant.  He had fully decided upon  his course of lying himself out of his serious scrape.          CHAPTER XV    AIR \"THE ROGUE'S MARCH\"      \"It is already, sir,\" spoke Lieutenant Nettleson, \"a matter of  knowledge with you that Mr. Darrin denied his responsibility in  each case of disorder among his personal belongings.  It is also  a matter within your knowledge, sir, that Mr. Darrin, finally,  in his desperation, informed you that he believed that some enemy  in the brigade of midshipmen was responsible for all the bad appearances  against him.    \"The reply of this department, sir, to Mr. Darrin, was to the effect  that, while there was a possibility of his claim being correct, yet  it was nearly inconceivable.  Mr. Darrin was given permission to  bring forward any evidence he could secure in support of his view.  As time passed, and he confessed himself unable to secure any such  evidence, one set of demerits after another accumulated against  Mr. Darrin.    \"Yesterday, sir, so I am informed, Mr. Farley and Mr. Page approached  you, stating that they believed they had good reason for suspecting  a member of the brigade of seeking to injure Mr. Darrin.  Midshipmen  Farley and Page also stated to you that they believed the offender  to be a member of the half of the fourth class which does not  recite in mathematics the same time as does the half of the class  to which Mr. Darrin and his roommate belong.    \"As Midshipmen Farley and Page belong to the half of the class  that recites during the same periods as do Mr. Darrin and Dalzell,  Midshipmen Farley and Page requested permission to remain in their  room during the time when they would otherwise be reciting in  mathematics.  They were thus to remain for two mornings, and other  members of the fourth class were then willing to stay on watch  for two mornings more, and so on, until the offender against Mr.  Darrin, if there was one, could be caught in the act.\"    What a baleful glare Midshipman Henkel shot at Farley and Page!  Then Henkel saw the eye of the commandant of midshipmen fixed  curiously on him, and glanced down at the floor.    \"This very unusual permission, sir, you finally agreed to seek  from the head of the Department of Mathematics.  So, this morning,  Mr. Farley and Mr. Page did not march off to recitation in mathematics,  but remained in their room.  Presently Mr. Page reported to me,  in great haste, that a midshipman other than Mr. Darrin, or Mr.  Dalzell had just entered their room.  I thereupon went down to  that room, knocked, waited a moment, and then entered, accompanied  by the cadet officer of the day.  The condition of things that  I found in the room you already, sir, know from my written report.  While in the room I detected a pair of feet showing under the  bottom of Mr. Darrin's uniform equipment hanging in his cupboard.  I pretended, however not to see the feet, and turned to leave  the room when Mr. Farley, as prearranged, stepped forward and  informed me that he had seen some one enter the room a while before.  I then turned and compelled the prowler to step forth.  That  prowler was Mr. Henkel.\"    \"You questioned Mr. Henkel as to his reason for being in the room?\"  asked Commander Jephson.    \"I did, sir.\"    \"Did he deny guilty intention in being there?\"    \"He did, sir, other than admitting that he had broken the regulations  by entering another midshipman's room in that midshipman's absence.\"    Tapping his right temple with the eye-glasses that he held in  his hand, the commandant of midshipmen turned to look more directly  at the startled culprit.    \"Mr. Henkel, did you arrange any or all of the disorder which  Lieutenant Nettleson reported having found in Mr. Darrin's room?\"    \"I did not, sir.\"    Henkel's voice was clear, firm--almost convincing.    \"Have you, at any time, committed any offense in Mr. Darrin's room,  by tampering with his equipment or belongings, or with the furniture  of the room?\"    \"Never, sir,\" declared Midshipman Henkel positively.    \"You are aware that Mr. Darrin has been punished by the imposition  of a great many demerits for untidiness in the care of his equipment?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"But you were not responsible for any of these seeming delinquencies  on Mr. Darrin's part?\"    \"Never, sir.\"    \"You did not turn down, disarrange and soil his bed this forenoon,  or create the appearance of untidiness in connection with Mr.  Darrin washbowl?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"You make these denials on your word of honor, as a midshipman  and gentleman?\" persisted Commander Jephson.    \"I do, sir, and most earnestly and solemnly, sir,\" replied Midshipman  Henkel.    \"One word, more, Mr. Henkel,\" went on the commandant of midshipmen.  \"When you improperly entered Mr. Darrin's room this morning,  did you then observe the signs of disorder which Lieutenant Nettleson  subsequently discovered and reported?\"    \"I did, sir, as to the bed.  The washbowl I did not notice.\"    \"That will do, for the present, Mr. Henkel.  Mr. Farley, will you  now state just what you saw, while watching this forenoon?\"    Midshipmen Farley told, simply, how he and Page had commenced  their watch.    \"In the first place, sir,\" declared Farley, \"as soon as Mr. Darrin  and Mr. Dalzell had left their room, and the corridor was empty,  Mr. Page and I, acting by permission and direction of this office,  went at once to Mr. Darrin's room.  We made an inspection.  At  that time there were no such signs of disorder as those which  Lieutenant Nettleson subsequently found.  Then, sir, Mr. Page  and I went back to our room.  I held our door very"]]]
