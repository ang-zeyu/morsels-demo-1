[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14080"],[0,"Custom and Myth (#17)"],[1,"  present, to examine the case of the Sacred Mice.  Among races which are  still in the totemistic stage, which still claim descent from animals and  from other objects, a peculiar marriage law generally exists, or can be  shown to have existed.  No man may marry a woman who is descended from  the same ancestral animal, and who bears the same totem-name, and carries  the same badge or family crest, as himself.  A man descended from the  Crane, and whose family name is Crane, cannot marry a woman whose family  name is Crane.  He must marry a woman of the Wolf, or Turtle, or Swan, or  other name, and her children keep her family title, not his.  Thus, if a  Crane man marries a Swan woman, the children are Swans, and none of them  may marry a Swan; they must marry Turtles, Wolves, or what not, and  _their_ children, again, are Turtles, or Wolves.  Thus there is  necessarily an eternal come and go of all the animal names known in a  district.  As civilisation advances these rules grow obsolete.  People  take their names from the father, as among ourselves.  Finally the  dwellers in a given district, having become united into a local tribe,  are apt to drop the various animal titles and to adopt, as the name of  the whole tribe, the name of the chief, or of the predominating family.  Let us imagine a district of some twenty miles in which there are Crane,  Wolf, Turtle, and Swan families.  Long residence together, and common  interests, have welded them into a local tribe.  The chief is of the Wolf  family, and the tribe, sinking family differences and family names, calls  itself 'the Wolves.'  Such tribes were probably, in the beginning, the  inhabitants of the various Egyptian towns which severally worshipped the  wolf, or the sheep, or the crocodile, and abstained religiously (except  on certain sacrificial occasions) from the flesh of the animal that gave  them its name. {107}    * * * * *    It has taken us long to reach the Sacred Mice of Greek religion, but we  are now in a position to approach their august divinity.  We have seen  that the sun-worship superseded, without abolishing, the tribal  pacarissas in Peru, and that the huacas, or images, of the sacred animals  were admitted under the roof of the temple of the Sun.  Now it is  recognised that the temples of the Sminthian Apollo contained images of  sacred mice among other animals, and our argument is that here, perhaps,  we have another example of the Peruvian religious evolution.  Just as, in  Peru, the tribes adored 'vile and filthy' animals, just as the solar  worship of the Incas subordinated these, just as the huacas of the beasts  remained in the temples of the Peruvian Sun; so, we believe, the tribes  along the Mediterranean coasts had, at some very remote prehistoric  period, their animal pacarissas; these were subordinated to the religion  (to some extent solar) of Apollo; and the huacas, or animal idols,  survived in Apollo's temples.    * * * * *    If this theory be correct, we shall probably find the mouse, for example,  revered as a sacred animal in many places.  This would necessarily  follow, if the marriage customs which we have described ever prevailed on  Greek soil, and scattered the mouse-name far and wide. {108a}  Traces of  the Mouse families, and of adoration, if adoration there was of the  mouse, would linger on in the following shapes:--(1) Places would be  named from mice, and mice would be actually held sacred in themselves.  (2) The mouse-name would be given locally to the god who superseded the  mouse.  (3) The figure of the mouse would be associated with the god, and  used as a badge, or a kind of crest, or local mark, in places where the  mouse has been a venerated animal.  (4) Finally, myths would be told to  account for the sacredness of a creature so undignified.    Let us take these considerations in their order:--    (1) If there were local mice tribes, deriving their name from the  worshipful mouse, certain towns settled by these tribes would retain a  reverence for mice.    In Chrysa, a town of the Troad, according to Heraclides Ponticus, mice  were held sacred, the local name for mouse being [Greek].  Many places  bore this mouse-name, according to Strabo. {108b}  This is precisely what  would have occurred had the Mouse totem, and the Mouse stock, been widely  distributed. {108c}  The Scholiast {109a} mentions Sminthus as a place in  the Troad.  Strabo speaks of two places deriving their name from  Sminthus, or mouse, near the Sminthian temple, and others near Larissa.  In Rhodes and Lindus, the mouse place-name recurs, 'and in many other  districts' ([Greek]).  Strabo (x. 486) names Caressus, and Poeessa, in  Ceos, among the other places which had Sminthian temples, and,  presumably, were once centres of tribes named after the mouse.    Here, then, are a number of localities in which the Mouse Apollo was  adored, and where the old mouse-name lingered.  That the mice were  actually held sacred in their proper persons we learn from AElian.  'The  dwellers in Hamaxitus of the Troad worship mice,' says AElian.  'In the  temple of Apollo Smintheus, mice are nourished, and food is offered to  them, at the public expense, and white mice dwell beneath the altar.'  {109b}  In the same way we found that the Peruvians fed their sacred  beasts on what they usually saw them eat.    (2) The second point in our argument has already been sufficiently  demonstrated.  The mouse-name 'Smintheus' was given to Apollo in all the  places mentioned by Strabo, 'and many others.'    (3) The figure of the mouse will be associated with the god, and used as  a badge, or crest, or local mark, in places where the mouse has been a  venerated animal.    The passage already quoted from AElian informs us that there stood 'an  effigy of the mouse beside the tripod of Apollo.'  In Chrysa, according  to Strabo (xiii. 604), the statue of Apollo Smintheus had a mouse beneath  his foot.  The mouse on the tripod of Apollo is represented on a  bas-relief illustrating the plague, and the offerings of the Greeks to  Apollo Smintheus, as described in the first book of the 'Iliad.' {110a}    * * * * *    The mouse is a not uncommon local badge or crest in Greece.  The animals  whose figures are stamped on coins, like the Athenian owl, are the most  ancient marks of cities.  It is a plausible conjecture that, just as the  Iroquois when they signed treaties with the Europeans used their  totems--bear, wolf, and turtle--as seals, {110b} so the animals on  archaic Greek city coins represented crests or badges which, at some far  more remote period, had been totems.    The Argives, according to Pollux, {110c} stamped the mouse on their  coins. {110d}  As there was a temple of Apollo Smintheus in Tenedos, we  naturally hear of a mouse on the coins of the island. {111a}  Golzio has  published one of these mouse coins.  The people of Metapontum stamped  their money with a mouse gnawing an ear of corn.  The people of Cumae  employed a mouse dormant.  Paoli fancied that certain mice on Roman  medals might be connected with the family of Mus, but this is rather  guesswork. {111b}    We have now shown traces, at least, of various ways in which an early  tribal religion of the mouse--the mouse pacarissa, as the Peruvians  said--may have been perpetuated.  When we consider that the superseding  of the mouse by Apollo must have occurred, if it did occur, long before  Homer, we may rather wonder that the mouse left his mark on Greek  religion so long.  We have seen mice revered, a god with a mouse-name,  the mouse-name recurring in many places, the huaca, or idol, of the mouse  preserved in the temples of the god, and the mouse-badge used in several  widely severed localities.  It remains (4) to examine the myths about  mice.  These, in our opinion, were probably told to account for the  presence of the huaca of the mouse in temples, and for the occurrence of  the animal in religion, and his connection with Apollo.    A singular mouse-myth, narrated by Herodotus, is worth examining for  reasons which will appear later, though the events are said to have  happened on Egyptian soil. {111c}  According to Herodotus, one Sethos, a  priest of Hephaestus (Ptah), was king of Egypt.  He had disgraced the  military class, and he found himself without an army when Sennacherib  invaded his country.  Sethos fell asleep in the temple, and the god,  appearing to him in a vision, told him that divine succour would come to  the Egyptians. {112a}  In the night before the battle, field-mice gnawed  the quivers and shield-handles of the foe, who fled on finding themselves  thus disarmed.  'And now,' says Herodotus, 'there standeth a stone image  of this king in the temple of Hephaestus, and in the hand of the image a  mouse, and there is this inscription, \"Let whoso looketh on me be  pious.\"'    Prof. Sayce {112b} holds that there was no such person as Sethos, but  that the legend 'is evidently Egyptian, not Greek, and the name of  Sennacherib, as well as the fact of the Assyrian attack, is correct.'  The  legend also, though Egyptian, is 'an echo of the biblical account of the  destruction of the Assyrian army,' an account which omits the mice.  'As  to the mice, here,' says Prof. Sayce, 'we have to do again with the Greek  dragomen (sic).  The story of Sethos was attached to the statue of some  deity which was supposed to hold a mouse in its hand.'  It must have been  easy to verify this supposition; but Mr. Sayce adds, 'mice were not  sacred in Egypt, nor were they used as symbols, or found on the  monuments.'  To this remark we may suggest some exceptions.  Apparently  this one mouse _was_ found on the monuments.  Wilkinson (iii. 264) says  mice do occur in the sculptures, but they were not sacred.  Rats,  however, were certainly sacred, and as little distinction is taken, in  myth, between rats and mice as between rabbits and hares.  The rat was  sacred to Ra, the Sun-god, and (like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14091"],[0,"Barkham Burroughs' Encyclopaedia of Astounding Facts and Useful Information, (#17)"],[1,"COLORS.

Retail merchants, in buying goods by wholesale, buy a great many  articles by the dozen, such as boots and shoes, hats and caps, and  notions of various kinds; now the merchant, in buying, for instance,  a dozen hats, knows exactly what one of these hats will retail for in  the market where he deals; and unless he is a good accountant, it  will often take him some time to determine whether he can afford to  purchase the dozen hats and make a living profit by selling them by  the single hat; and in buying his goods by auction, as the merchant  often does, he has not time to make the calculation before the goods  are bid off. He therefore loses the chance of making good bargains by  being afraid to bid at random, or if he bids, and the goods are cried  off, he may have made a poor bargain by bidding thus at a venture.  It then becomes a useful and practical problem to determine instantly  what per cent. he would gain if he retailed the hat at a certain  price, to tell what an article should retail for to make a profit of  20 per cent.    _Rule.--Divide what the articles cost per dozen by 10. which is done  by removing the decimal point one place to the left._    For instance, if hats cost $17.50 per dozen, remove the decimal point  one place to the left, making $1.75, what they should be sold for  apiece to gain 20 per cent, on the cost. If they cost $31.00 per  dozen, they should be sold at $3.10 apiece, etc.      THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD.    Pyramids of Egypt.    Tower, Walls and Terrace Hanging Gardens of Babylon.

SOLUBLE GLASS FOR FLOORS.    Instead of the old-fashioned method of using wax for polishing floors,  etc., soluble glass is now employed to great advantage. For this  purpose the floor is first well cleaned, and then the cracks well  filled up with a cement of water-glass and powdered chalk or gypsum.  Afterward, a water-glass of 60  to 65 , of the thickness of syrup, is  applied by means of a stiff brush. Any desired color may be imparted  to the floor in a second coat of the water-glass, and additional coats  are to be given until the requisite polish is obtained. A still higher  finish may be given by pummicing off the last layer, and then putting  on a coating of oil.      DURABILITY OF A HORSE.    A horse will travel 400 yards in 4-1/2 minutes at a walk, 400 yards  in 2 minutes at a trot, and 400 yards in minute at a gallop. The usual  work of a horse is taken at 22,500 lbs. raised 1 foot per minute, for  8 hours per day. A horse will carry 250 lbs. 25 miles per day of 8  hours. An average draught-horse will draw 1600 lbs. 23 miles per day  on a level road, weight of wagon included. The average weight of a  horse is 1000 lbs.; his strength is equal to that of 5 men. In a horse  mill moving at 3 feet per second, track 25 feet diameter, he exerts  with the machine the power of 4-1/2 horses. The greatest amount a  horse can pull in a horizontal line is 900 lbs.; but he can only do  this momentarily, in continued exertion, probably half of this is  the limit. He attains his growth in 5 years, will live 25, average 16  years. A horse will live 25 days on water, without solid food, 17 days  without eating or drinking, but only 5 days on solid food, without  drinking.    A cart drawn by horses over an ordinary road will travel 1.1 miles  per hour of trip. A 4-horse team will haul from 25 to 30 cubic feet  of lime stone at each load. The time expended in loading, unloading,  etc., including delavs, averages 35 minutes per trip. The cost of  loading and unloading a cart, using a horse cram at the quarry, and  unloading by hand, when labor is $1.25 per day, and a horse 75 cents,  is 25 cents per perch--24.75 cubic feet. The work done by an animal is  greatest when the velocity with which he moves is 1/8 of the greatest  with which he can move when not impeded, and the force then exerted  .45 of the utmost force the animal can exert at a dead pull.      COMPARATIVE COST OF FREIGHT BY WATER AND RAIL.    It has been proved by actual test that a single tow-boat can transport  at one trip from the Ohio to New Orleans 29,000 tons of coal, loaded  in barges. Estimating in this way the boat and its tow, worked by a  few men, carries as much freight to its destination as 3,000 cars and  100 locomotives, manned by 600 men, could transport.      HINTS TO YOUNG HOUSEWIVES.    Glycerine does not agree with a dry skin.    If you use powder always wash it off before going to bed.    When you give your cellar its spring cleaning, add a little copperas  water and salt to the whitewash.    A little ammonia and borax in the water when washing blankets keeps  them soft and prevents shrinkage.    Sprinkling salt on the top and at the bottom of garden walls is said  to keep snails from climbing up or down.    For relief from heartburn or dyspepsia, drink a little cold water in  which has been dissolved a teaspoonful of salt.    For hoarseness, beat a fresh egg and thicken it with fine white sugar.  Eat of it freely and the hoarseness will soon be relieved.    If quilts are folded or rolled tightly after washing, then beaten with  a rolling pin or potato masher, it lightens up the cotton and makes  them seem soft and new.    Chemists say that it takes more than twice as much sugar to sweeten  preserves, sauce, etc., if put in when they begin to cook as it does  to sweeten after the fruit is cooked.    Tar may be removed from the hands by rubbing with the outside of  fresh, orange or lemon peel and drying immediately. The volatile oils  dissolve the tar so that it can be rubbed off.    Moths or any summer flying insects may be enticed to destruction by a  bright tin pan half filled with kerosene set in a dark corner of the  room. Attracted by the bright pan, the moth will meet his death in the  kerosene.    It may be worth knowing that water in which three or four onions have  been boiled, applied with a gilding brush to the frames of pictures  and chimney glasses, will prevent flies from lighting on them and will  not injure the frames.
