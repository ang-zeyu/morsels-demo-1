Just as night fell we cleared the belt of bamboos, and at once formed  our camp, exhausted by the interminable day.    Early next morning we were again afoot, and found that the character of  the country had changed once again.  Behind us was the wall of bamboo,  as definite as if it marked the course of a river.  In front was an  open plain, sloping slightly upwards and dotted with clumps of  tree-ferns, the whole curving before us until it ended in a long,  whale-backed ridge.  This we reached about midday, only to find a  shallow valley beyond, rising once again into a gentle incline which  led to a low, rounded sky-line.  It was here, while we crossed the  first of these hills, that an incident occurred which may or may not  have been important.    Professor Challenger, who with the two local Indians was in the van of  the party, stopped suddenly and pointed excitedly to the right.  As he  did so we saw, at the distance of a mile or so, something which  appeared to be a huge gray bird flap slowly up from the ground and skim  smoothly off, flying very low and straight, until it was lost among the  tree-ferns.    \"Did you see it?\" cried Challenger, in exultation.  \"Summerlee, did you  see it?\"    His colleague was staring at the spot where the creature had  disappeared.    \"What do you claim that it was?\" he asked.    \"To the best of my belief, a pterodactyl.\"    Summerlee burst into derisive laughter \"A pter-fiddlestick!\" said he.  \"It was a stork, if ever I saw one.\"    Challenger was too furious to speak.  He simply swung his pack upon his  back and continued upon his march.  Lord John came abreast of me,  however, and his face was more grave than was his wont.  He had his  Zeiss glasses in his hand.    \"I focused it before it got over the trees,\" said he. \"I won't  undertake to say what it was, but I'll risk my reputation as a  sportsman that it wasn't any bird that ever I clapped eyes on in my  life.\"    So there the matter stands.  Are we really just at the edge of the  unknown, encountering the outlying pickets of this lost world of which  our leader speaks?  I give you the incident as it occurred and you will  know as much as I do.  It stands alone, for we saw nothing more which  could be called remarkable.    And now, my readers, if ever I have any, I have brought you up the  broad river, and through the screen of rushes, and down the green  tunnel, and up the long slope of palm trees, and through the bamboo  brake, and across the plain of tree-ferns.  At last our destination lay  in full sight of us.  When we had crossed the second ridge we saw  before us an irregular, palm-studded plain, and then the line of high  red cliffs which I have seen in the picture.  There it lies, even as I  write, and there can be no question that it is the same.  At the  nearest point it is about seven miles from our present camp, and it  curves away, stretching as far as I can see.  Challenger struts about  like a prize peacock, and Summerlee is silent, but still sceptical.  Another day should bring some of our doubts to an end.  Meanwhile, as  Jose, whose arm was pierced by a broken bamboo, insists upon returning,  I send this letter back in his charge, and only hope that it may  eventually come to hand.  I will write again as the occasion serves.  I  have enclosed with this a rough chart of our journey, which may have  the effect of making the account rather easier to understand.                                      CHAPTER IX                      \"Who could have Foreseen it?\"    A dreadful thing has happened to us.  Who could have foreseen it?  I  cannot foresee any end to our troubles.  It may be that we are  condemned to spend our whole lives in this strange, inaccessible place.  I am still so confused that I can hardly think clearly of the facts of  the present or of the chances of the future.  To my astounded senses  the one seems most terrible and the other as black as night.    No men have ever found themselves in a worse position; nor is there any  use in disclosing to you our exact geographical situation and asking  our friends for a relief party.  Even if they could send one, our fate  will in all human probability be decided long before it could arrive in  South America.    We are, in truth, as far from any human aid as if we were in the moon.  If we are to win through, it is only our own qualities which can save  us.  I have as companions three remarkable men, men of great  brain-power and of unshaken courage.  There lies our one and only hope.  It is only when I look upon the untroubled faces of my comrades that I  see some glimmer through the darkness.  Outwardly I trust that I appear  as unconcerned as they.  Inwardly I am filled with apprehension.    Let me give you, with as much detail as I can, the sequence of events  which have led us to this catastrophe.    When I finished my last letter I stated that we were within seven miles  from an enormous line of ruddy cliffs, which encircled, beyond all  doubt, the plateau of which Professor Challenger spoke.  Their height,  as we approached them, seemed to me in some places to be greater than  he had stated--running up in parts to at least a thousand feet--and  they were curiously striated, in a manner which is, I believe,  characteristic of basaltic upheavals.  Something of the sort is to be  seen in Salisbury Crags at Edinburgh.  The summit showed every sign of  a luxuriant vegetation, with bushes near the edge, and farther back  many high trees.  There was no indication of any life that we could see.    That night we pitched our camp immediately under the cliff--a most wild  and desolate spot.  The crags above us were not merely perpendicular,  but curved outwards at the top, so that ascent was out of the question.  Close to us was the high thin pinnacle of rock which I believe I  mentioned earlier in this narrative.  It is like a broad red church  spire, the top of it being level with the plateau, but a great chasm  gaping between.  On the summit of it there grew one high tree.  Both  pinnacle and cliff were comparatively low--some five or six hundred  feet, I should think.    \"It was on that,\" said Professor Challenger, pointing to this tree,  \"that the pterodactyl was perched.  I climbed half-way up the rock  before I shot him.  I am inclined to think that a good mountaineer like  myself could ascend the rock to the top, though he would, of course, be  no nearer to the plateau when he had done so.\"    As Challenger spoke of his pterodactyl I glanced at Professor  Summerlee, and for the first time I seemed to see some signs of a  dawning credulity and repentance.  There was no sneer upon his thin  lips, but, on the contrary, a gray, drawn look of excitement and  amazement.  Challenger saw it, too, and reveled in the first taste of  victory.    \"Of course,\" said he,  with his clumsy and ponderous sarcasm,  \"Professor Summerlee will understand that when I speak of a pterodactyl  I mean a stork--only it is the kind of stork which has no feathers, a  leathery skin, membranous wings, and teeth in its jaws.\"  He grinned  and blinked and bowed until his colleague turned and walked away.    In the morning, after a frugal breakfast of coffee and manioc--we had  to be economical of our stores--we held a council of war as to the best  method of ascending to the plateau above us.    Challenger presided with a solemnity as if he were the Lord Chief  Justice on the Bench.  Picture him seated upon a rock, his absurd  boyish straw hat tilted on the back of his head, his supercilious eyes  dominating us from under his drooping lids, his great black beard  wagging as he slowly defined our present situation and our future  movements.    Beneath him you might have seen the three of us--myself, sunburnt,  young, and vigorous after our open-air tramp; Summerlee, solemn but  still critical, behind his eternal pipe; Lord John, as keen as a  razor-edge, with his supple, alert figure leaning upon his rifle, and  his eager eyes fixed eagerly upon the speaker.  Behind us were grouped  the two swarthy half-breeds and the little knot of Indians, while in  front and above us towered those huge, ruddy ribs of rocks which kept  us from our goal.    \"I need not say,\" said our leader, \"that on the occasion of my last  visit I exhausted every means of climbing the cliff, and where I failed  I do not think that anyone else is likely to succeed, for I am  something of a mountaineer.  I had none of the appliances of a  rock-climber with me, but I have taken the precaution to bring them  now.  With their aid I am positive I could climb that detached pinnacle  to the summit; but so long as the main cliff overhangs, it is vain to  attempt ascending that.  I was hurried upon my last visit by the  approach of the rainy season and by the exhaustion of my supplies.  These considerations limited my time, and I can only claim that I have  surveyed about six miles of the cliff to the east of us, finding no  possible way up.  What, then, shall we now do?\"    \"There seems to be only one reasonable course,\" said Professor  Summerlee.  \"If you have explored the east, we should travel along the  base of the cliff to the west, and seek for a practicable point for our  ascent.\"    \"That's it,\" said Lord John.  \"The odds are that this plateau is of no  great size, and we shall travel round it until we either find an easy  way up it, or come back to the point from which we started.\"    \"I have already explained to our young friend here,\" said Challenger  (he has a way of alluding to me as if I were a school child ten years  old), \"that it is quite impossible that there should be an easy way up  anywhere, for the simple reason that if there were the summit would not  be isolated, and those conditions would not obtain which have effected  so singular an interference with the general laws of survival."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1390"],[0,"The Jimmyjohn Boss, and Other Stories (#17)"],[1,"buckles.    \"Yo-hanny, you're lookin' jaded under Colonel Safetypin.\" said Casey.  \"Have something?\"    \"Safetypin is my treat,\" said Schmoll; \"und very apt.\"    But Augustus found leisure to pervade the post with his modernity. He  set himself military problems, and solved them; he wrote an essay on  \"The Contact Squadron\"; he corrected Bainbridge for saying \"throw back  the left flank\" instead of \"refuse the left flank\"; he had reading-room  ideas, canteen' ideas, ideas for the Indians and the Agency, and  recruit-drill ideas, which he presented to Sergeant Casey. Casey gave  him, in exchange, the name of Napoleon Shave-Tail, and had his whiskey  again paid for by the sympathetic Schmoll.    \"But bless his educated heart,\" said Casey, \"he don't learn me nothing  that'll soil my innercence!\"    Thus did the sunny-humored Sergeant take it, but not thus the mess.  Had Augustus seen himself as they saw him, could he have heard Mrs.  Starr--But he did not; the youth was impervious, and to remove his  complacency would require (so Mrs. Starr said) an operation, probably  fatal. The commanding officer held always aloof from gibing, yet often  when Augustus passed him his gray eye would dwell upon the Lieutenant's  back, and his voiceless laugh would possess him. That is the picture I  retain of these days--the unending golden sun, the wide, gentle-colored  plain, the splendid mountains, the Indians ambling through the flat,  clear distance; and here, close along the parade-ground, eye-glassed  Augustus, neatly hastening, with the Captain on his porch, asleep you  might suppose.    One early morning the agent, with two Indian chiefs, waited on the  commanding officer, and after their departure his wife found him  breakfasting in solitary mirth.    \"Without me,\" she chided, sitting down. \"And I know you've had some good  news.\"    \"The best, my love. Providence has been tempted at last. The wholesome  irony of life is about to function.\"    \"Frank, don't tease so! And where are you rushing now before the cakes?\"    \"To set our Augustus a little military problem, dearest. Plain living  for to-day, and high thinking be jolly well--\"    \"Frank, you're going to swear, and I must know!\"    But Frank had sworn and hurried out to the right to the Adjutant's  office, while his Catherine flew to the left to the fence.    \"Ella!\" she cried. \"Oh, Ella!\"    Mrs. Bainbridge, instantly on the other side of the fence, brought  scanty light. A telegram had come, she knew, from the Crow Agency in  Montana. Her husband had admitted this three nights ago; and Captain  Duane (she knew) had given him some orders about something; and could  it be the Crows? \"Ella, I don't know,\" said Catherine. \"Frank talked all  about Providence in his incurable way, and it may be anything.\" So the  two ladies wondered together over the fence, until Mrs. Duane, seeing  the Captain return, ran to him and asked, were the Crows on the  war-path? Then her Frank told her yes, and that he had detailed  Albumblatt to vanquish them and escort them to Carlisle School to learn  German and Beethoven's sonatas.    \"Stuff, stuff, stuff! Why, there he does go!\" cried the unsettled  Catherine. \"It's something at the Agency!\" But Captain Duane was gone  into the house for a cigar.    Albumblatt, with Sergeant Casey and a detail of six men, was in truth  hastening over that broad mile which opens between Fort Brown and the  Agency. On either side of them the level plain stretched, gray with  its sage, buff with intervening grass, hay-cocked with the smoky,  mellow-stained, meerschaum-like canvas tepees of the Indians, quiet as a  painting; far eastward lay long, low, rose-red hills, half dissolved in  the trembling mystery of sun and distance; and westward, close at hand  and high, shone the great pale-blue serene mountains through the vaster  serenity of the air. The sounding hoofs of the troops brought the  Indians out of their tepees to see. When Albumblatt reached the Agency,  there waited the agent and his two chiefs, who pointed to one lodge  standing apart some three hundred yards, and said, \"He is there.\" So  then Augustus beheld his problem, the military duty fallen to him from  Providence and Captain Duane.    It seems elementary for him who has written of \"The Contact Squadron.\"  It was to arrest one Indian. This man, Ute Jack, had done a murder among  the Crows, and fled south for shelter. The telegram heralded him, but  with boundless miles for hiding he had stolen in under the cover of  night. No welcome met him. These Fort Brown Indians were not his friends  at any time, and less so now, when he arrived wild drunk among their  families. Hounded out, he sought this empty lodge, and here he was,  at bay, his hand against every man's, counting his own life worthless  except for destroying others before he must himself die.    \"Is he armed?\" Albumblatt inquired, and was told yes.    Augustus considered the peaked cone tent. The opening was on this side,  but a canvas drop closed it. Not much of a problem--one man inside a  sack with eight outside to catch him! But the books gave no rule for  this combination, and Augustus had met with nothing of the sort in  Germany. He considered at some length. Smoke began to rise through the  meeting poles of the tepee, leisurely and natural, and one of the chiefs  said:    \"Maybe Ute Jack cooking. He hungry.\"    \"This is not a laughing matter,\" said Augustus to the by-standers, who  were swiftly gathering. \"Tell him that I command him to surrender,\" he  added to the agent, who shouted this forthwith; and silence followed.    \"Tell him I say he must come out at once,\" said Augustus then; and  received further silence.    \"He eat now,\" observed the chief. \"Can't talk much.\"    \"Sergeant Casey,\" bellowed Albumblatt, \"go over there and take him out!\"    \"The Lootenant understands,\" said Casey, slowly, \"that Ute Jack has got  the drop on us, and there ain't no getting any drop on him.\"    \"Sergeant, you will execute your orders without further comment.\"    At this amazing step the silence fell cold indeed; but Augustus was in  command.    \"Shall I take any men along, sir?\" said Casey in his soldier's machine  voice.    \"Er--yes. Er--no. Er--do as you please.\"    The six troopers stepped forward to go, for they loved Casey; but he  ordered them sharply to fall back. Then, looking in their eyes, he  whispered, \"Good-bye, boys, if it's to be that way,\" and walked to the  lodge, lifted the flap, and fell, shot instantly dead through the heart.  \"Two bullets into him,\" muttered a trooper, heavily breathing as the  sounds rang. \"He's down,\" another spoke to himself with fixed eyes; and  a sigh they did not know of passed among them. The two chiefs looked at  Augustus and grunted short talk together; and one, with a sweeping lift  of his hand out towards the tepee and the dead man by it, said, \"Maybe  Ute Jack only got three--four--cartridges--so!\" (his fingers counted  it). \"After he kill three--four--men, you get him pretty good.\" The  Indian took the white man's death thus; but the white men could not yet  be even saturnine.    \"This will require reinforcement,\" said Augustus to the audience. \"The  place must be attacked by a front and flank movement. It must be knocked  down. I tell you I must have it knocked down. How are you to see where  he is, I'd like to know, if it's not knocked down?\" Augustus's voice was  getting high.    \"I want the howitzer,\" he screeched generally.    A soldier saluted, and Augustus chattered at him.    \"The howitzer, the mountain howitzer, I tell you. Don't you hear me? To  knock the cursed thing he's in down. Go to Captain Duane and give him my  compliments, and--no, I'll go myself. Where's my horse? My horse, I tell  you! It's got to be knocked down.\"    \"If you please, Lieutenant,\" said the trooper, \"may we have the Red  Cross ambulance?\"    \"Red Cross? What's that for? What's that?\"    \"Sergeant Casey, sir. He's a-lyin' there.\"    \"Ambulance? Certainly. The howitzer--perhaps they're only flesh wounds.  I hope they are only flesh wounds. I must have more men--you'll come  with me.\"    From his porch Duane viewed both Augustus approach and the man stop  at the hospital, and having expected a bungle, sat to hear; but at  Albumblatt's mottled face he stood up quickly and said, \"What's the  matter?\" And hearing, burst out: \"Casey! Why, he was worth fifty of--Go  on, Mr. Albumblatt. What next did you achieve, sir?\" And as the tale was  told he cooled, bitter, but official.    \"Reinforcements is it, Mr. Albumblatt?\"    \"The howitzer, Captain.\"    \"Good. And G troop?\"    \"For my double flank movement I--\"    \"Perhaps you'd like H troop as reserve?\"    \"Not reserve, Captain. I should establish--\"    \"This is your duty, Mr. Albumblatt. Perform it as you can, with what  force you need.\"    \"Thank you, sir. It is not exactly a battle, but with a, so-to-speak,  intrenched--\"    \"Take your troops and go, sir, and report to me when you have arrested  your man.\"    Then Duane went to the hospital, and out with the ambulance, hoping that  the soldier might not be dead. But the wholesome irony of life reckons  beyond our calculations; and the unreproachful, sunny face of his  Sergeant evoked in Duane's memory many marches through long heat and  cold, back in the rough, good times.    \"Hit twice, I thought they told me,\" said he; and the steward surmised  that one had missed.    \"Perhaps,\" mused Duane. \"And perhaps it went as intended, too. What's  all that fuss?\"    He turned sharply, having lost Augustus among his sadder thoughts; and  here were the operations going briskly. Powder-smoke in three directions  at once! Here were pickets far out-lying, and a double line of  skirmishers deployed in extended order, and a mounted reserve, and men  standing to horse--a command of near a hundred, a pudding of pompous,  incompetent, callow bosh, with Augustus by his howitzer, scientifically  raising and lowering it to"]]]
