For a conversazione, under which head are included \"Receptions\"  and \"At Homes,\" invitations should be sent out a week beforehand.  Conversation is, as the name implies, the principal occupation for  the time, and where literary people are gathered together, or  those engrossed in scientific matters, the sole one. For parties  of young people, however, the conversazione admits of music and  impromptu dances.    For all small evening parties, the host and hostess remain near  the door during the early part of the evening, to receive their  guests. Late comers, however, must not expect to find them still  nailed to this one spot, as, after the majority of the guests are  assembled, their duty is to circulate round the room and entertain  them. They should, however, be quick to observe any late arrivals,  and advance to welcome them as soon as possible. As the guests  enter the room, the hostess should advance a step or two towards  them, speaking a few words of cordial welcome, to the elder ladies  first, then to the younger ones, and finally to the gentlemen. If  the new comers are strangers to the rest of the guests, she must  introduce them at once to those present; if, however, there are  mutual friends present, it is their duty to leave the hostess  after a few minutes, that she may be free to receive her other  friends.    The hostess must remain constantly amongst her guests. For her to  fidget in and out constantly, as if cooking the supper, or  training the waiters, is a mark of low breeding. The most  perfectly well-bred hostess is the one who seems to have no  thought beyond the circle of her guests.    As many rooms as possible should be thrown open and supplied with  objects of interest in the arts and sciences. People of some  public note, whether for travel, art, learning, science, or any  attainment, are often placed upon exhibition at the conversazione.  If such a lion is invited, it is well to have others, even if of  lesser magnitude, to prevent too much attention being concentrated  upon one guest.    If a hostess sees that a _tete-a-tete_ conversation is becoming  dull, she must make it a trio by the introduction of some  sprightly third, or change the duet by substituting another  partner and carrying off one to introduce elsewhere. If, however,  any conversation seems to be animated and giving pleasure, neither  of the parties so engaged will thank the hostess for interruption.    If dancing is introduced, the etiquette of the ball-room is also  the etiquette for the evening party. It is best for the hostess to  provide a pianist, if she does not herself preside at the piano,  as it is excessively ill-bred to expect part of the guests to play  for the remainder to dance. Many good-natured people find  themselves thus victimized--invited \"because they are always so  willing to play for dancing.\" It is a good plan in a dancing party  to have ices alone handed round once or even twice during the  evening, and a hot supper later, if at all. Ices, lemonade, cake,  confectionery, and fruits are, however, quite sufficient  refreshment for small parties.    If the evening of a party is stormy, the hostess should have a  waiter at the door, with a _large_ umbrella, to escort the guests  from the carriages to the house, or, better still, have an awning  stretched across the sidewalk.    If a party is mixed-conversation, music, and dancing, all forming  a portion of the evening's entertainment-it is the part of the  hostess to invite guests to sing and play, and she must be careful  not to overlook any amateurs in her invitations. If a guest  declines, it is in bad taste to urge the performance. If the lady  of the house is herself a good performer, she must play or sing  but once, and then after all others have been first invited. A  guest should only be invited to play once, unless at a generally  expressed desire of the remainder of the company.    It is best for amateur performers to learn a few pieces of music  without depending upon their notes, as, if they send or carry  notes, it is a hint that they expect to be invited to play; if  they do not, they are obliged to decline when invited.    It is excessively rude to converse loudly when any one is playing  or singing. If your companion does not cease talking, to listen,  converse in a very low tone, and withdraw from the immediate  vicinity of the performer. On the other hand, if you are invited  to play, do not wait for quiet in the room, nor exhibit any  annoyance if your most exquisite passages are drowned in the buzz  of conversation.    A gentleman who is a good pianist may, with perfect propriety,  offer his services to the hostess as orchestra for impromptu  dancing, or may offer to relieve any lady so engaged, to allow her  to dance. If, however, there are more ladies than gentlemen, and  he is needed to fill up a set, he must not insist upon playing,  but go where he is most needed.    Never offer to turn the leaves for any one playing unless you can  read music rapidly; otherwise you may confuse the performer by  turning too soon or too late.    Never offer to sing a second unless invited by the lady who is to  sing also. The hostess may wish her friends to hear a duet, which  will be disagreeable to the performers.    Members of the same family, cousins or other relatives, should not  keep together in general society. They can see each other on other  occasions, and the object of parties is to promote sociality, not  exclusiveness.    If you are asked to play an accompaniment, do not seek to display  your own talent, but play so as to afford the best support  possible for the voice singing. The same rule applies to a second  in any instrumental  duet, which is never intended to drown the  sound of the leading instrument.    When the lady of the house invites any lady guest to sing or play,  the gentleman standing nearest to her should offer his arm to  escort her to the piano or harp. He should stand near her during  the performance of the music, and, if competent, turn the leaves  of her music. She may also request him to hold her gloves, bouquet  and fan. When she rises, he should conduct her to a seat, and  thank her for the pleasure she has given him and others.    It is ill-bred to comment upon the piano, even if shockingly out  of tune or worn out. To look at a six-octave piano and decline  playing because all your music is written for seven octaves, is  positively insulting to a hostess. If it is true, decline upon  some other pretext.    Private concerts and theatricals ought to be very good to be  successful. Professional singers should be secured for the former,  and if amateurs sing, they must be very confident of their own  powers before making the attempt to appear before an audience,  even of personal friends. Between the parts, conversation may  flow, but is rude in the extreme during the performances. The best  hours are from two to six or from eight to eleven P.M. The rooms  should be arranged so as to allow a clear space at one end for the  performers; the guests should be seated, and a general silence  prevail excepting during the intervals of the performance. If the  concert is divided into two parts, it is quite permissible to rise  during the intermission, promenade if agreeable, meet friends, and  change seats, being careful to be seated again when the  performance re-commences.    For private theatricals, only the best amateurs should be  retained. It is very rude to talk during the acts, and while  applause should not be too boisterous, disapproval by hissing or  otherwise is a thing unheard of. Ices and light refreshments  should be handed round between the acts. Where there is no  arrangement for a private theatre, and where the curtain is hung,  as is most common, between the folding-doors, the audience-room  must be filled with chairs or benches in rows, and, if possible,  the back rows raised higher than the others. These are often  removed at the close of the performance, and the guests then  converse or dance.    To beat time or hum the air at a concert is in extremely bad  taste.    It is the part of the hostess at a private concert and private  theatricals--which latter include charades, tableaux, proverbs,  and dramatic readings--to arrange the programmes and apportion the  parts, unless she appoints a stage-manager amongst her guests. The  performers should seek to aid her by perfect good-nature in  accepting her arrangements, and by willingness to accept any  allotted part, even if distasteful or obscure. All cannot be  first, and the performer who good-naturedly accepts a small part,  and performs it _well_, will probably be invited to a more  conspicuous position on the next occasion. The hostess or host  must never take conspicuous parts, unless they are solicited to do  so by all the rest of the _corps dramatique_.    Nothing but the most absolute necessity, or an excuse from some  very grave cause, should prevent the attendance of any one who has  undertaken a part. It is a positive insult to the rest of the  party to inconvenience them by remaining away upon some trivial  excuse, for the smallest part must be filled by somebody, and it  is not easy to furnish substitutes upon such occasions.    The hostess should consult each performer before allotting to them  a part, and endeavor to suit each one.    Private concerts and private theatricals should be followed by a  supper, as they are fatiguing for the performers, and oftentimes  as much so to the audience.    If a party are invited to an informal dramatic reading, it is not  necessary to divide the room, excepting by a large table, upon  which the books are placed. The host or hostess, while endeavoring  to give to each guest the most favorable opportunity to display  their own powers, should still, if they are good readers, be ready  to oblige their guests"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8492"],[0,"The King in Yellow (#16)"],[1,"her that  she might better have loved Ed Burke and worn a plain gold ring, but she  would not hear of it, and I thought perhaps as long as she had decided to  love somebody she could not marry, it had better be me. I, at least,  could treat her with an intelligent affection, and whenever she became  tired of her infatuation she could go none the worse for it. For I was  decided on that point although I knew how hard it would be. I remembered  the usual termination of Platonic liaisons, and thought how disgusted I  had been whenever I heard of one. I knew I was undertaking a great deal  for so unscrupulous a man as I was, and I dreamed the future, but never  for one moment did I doubt that she was safe with me. Had it been anybody  but Tessie I should not have bothered my head about scruples. For it did  not occur to me to sacrifice Tessie as I would have sacrificed a woman of  the world. I looked the future squarely in the face and saw the several  probable endings to the affair. She would either tire of the whole thing,  or become so unhappy that I should have either to marry her or go away.  If I married her we would be unhappy. I with a wife unsuited to me, and  she with a husband unsuitable for any woman. For my past life could  scarcely entitle me to marry. If I went away she might either fall ill,  recover, and marry some Eddie Burke, or she might recklessly or  deliberately go and do something foolish. On the other hand, if she tired  of me, then her whole life would be before her with beautiful vistas of  Eddie Burkes and marriage rings and twins and Harlem flats and Heaven  knows what. As I strolled along through the trees by the Washington Arch,  I decided that she should find a substantial friend in me, anyway, and  the future could take care of itself. Then I went into the house and put  on my evening dress, for the little faintly-perfumed note on my dresser  said, \"Have a cab at the stage door at eleven,\" and the note was signed  \"Edith Carmichel, Metropolitan Theatre.\"    I took supper that night, or rather we took supper, Miss Carmichel and I,  at Solari's, and the dawn was just beginning to gild the cross on the  Memorial Church as I entered Washington Square after leaving Edith at the  Brunswick. There was not a soul in the park as I passed along the trees  and took the walk which leads from the Garibaldi statue to the Hamilton  Apartment House, but as I passed the churchyard I saw a figure sitting on  the stone steps. In spite of myself a chill crept over me at the sight of  the white puffy face, and I hastened to pass. Then he said something  which might have been addressed to me or might merely have been a mutter  to himself, but a sudden furious anger flamed up within me that such a  creature should address me. For an instant I felt like wheeling about and  smashing my stick over his head, but I walked on, and entering the  Hamilton went to my apartment. For some time I tossed about the bed  trying to get the sound of his voice out of my ears, but could not. It  filled my head, that muttering sound, like thick oily smoke from a  fat-rendering vat or an odour of noisome decay. And as I lay and tossed  about, the voice in my ears seemed more distinct, and I began to  understand the words he had muttered. They came to me slowly as if I had  forgotten them, and at last I could make some sense out of the sounds. It  was this:    \"Have you found the Yellow Sign?\"    \"Have you found the Yellow Sign?\"    \"Have you found the Yellow Sign?\"    I was furious. What did he mean by that? Then with a curse upon him and  his I rolled over and went to sleep, but when I awoke later I looked pale  and haggard, for I had dreamed the dream of the night before, and it  troubled me more than I cared to think.    I dressed and went down into my studio. Tessie sat by the window, but as  I came in she rose and put both arms around my neck for an innocent kiss.  She looked so sweet and dainty that I kissed her again and then sat down  before the easel.    \"Hello! Where's the study I began yesterday?\" I asked.    Tessie looked conscious, but did not answer. I began to hunt among the  piles of canvases, saying, \"Hurry up, Tess, and get ready; we must take  advantage of the morning light.\"    When at last I gave up the search among the other canvases and turned to  look around the room for the missing study I noticed Tessie standing by  the screen with her clothes still on.    \"What's the matter,\" I asked, \"don't you feel well?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then hurry.\"    \"Do you want me to pose as--as I have always posed?\"    Then I understood. Here was a new complication. I had lost, of course,  the best nude model I had ever seen. I looked at Tessie. Her face was  scarlet. Alas! Alas! We had eaten of the tree of knowledge, and Eden and  native innocence were dreams of the past--I mean for her.    I suppose she noticed the disappointment on my face, for she said: \"I  will pose if you wish. The study is behind the screen here where I put  it.\"    \"No,\" I said, \"we will begin something new;\" and I went into my wardrobe  and picked out a Moorish costume which fairly blazed with tinsel. It was  a genuine costume, and Tessie retired to the screen with it enchanted.  When she came forth again I was astonished. Her long black hair was bound  above her forehead with a circlet of turquoises, and the ends, curled  about her glittering girdle. Her feet were encased in the embroidered  pointed slippers and the skirt of her costume, curiously wrought with  arabesques in silver, fell to her ankles. The deep metallic blue vest  embroidered with silver and the short Mauresque jacket spangled and sewn  with turquoises became her wonderfully. She came up to me and held up her  face smiling. I slipped my hand into my pocket, and drawing out a gold  chain with a cross attached, dropped it over her head.    \"It's yours, Tessie.\"    \"Mine?\" she faltered.    \"Yours. Now go and pose,\" Then with a radiant smile she ran behind the  screen and presently reappeared with a little box on which was written my  name.    \"I had intended to give it to you when I went home to-night,\" she said,  \"but I can't wait now.\"    I opened the box. On the pink cotton inside lay a clasp of black onyx, on  which was inlaid a curious symbol or letter in gold. It was neither  Arabic nor Chinese, nor, as I found afterwards, did it belong to any  human script.    \"It's all I had to give you for a keepsake,\" she said timidly.    I was annoyed, but I told her how much I should prize it, and promised to  wear it always. She fastened it on my coat beneath the lapel.    \"How foolish, Tess, to go and buy me such a beautiful thing as this,\" I  said.    \"I did not buy it,\" she laughed.    \"Where did you get it?\"    Then she told me how she had found it one day while coming from the  Aquarium in the Battery, how she had advertised it and watched the  papers, but at last gave up all hopes of finding the owner.    \"That was last winter,\" she said, \"the very day I had the first horrid  dream about the hearse.\"    I remembered my dream of the previous night but said nothing, and  presently my charcoal was flying over a new canvas, and Tessie stood  motionless on the model-stand.          III    The day following was a disastrous one for me. While moving a framed  canvas from one easel to another my foot slipped on the polished floor,  and I fell heavily on both wrists. They were so badly sprained that it  was useless to attempt to hold a brush, and I was obliged to wander about  the studio, glaring at unfinished drawings and sketches, until despair  seized me and I sat down to smoke and twiddle my thumbs with rage. The  rain blew against the windows and rattled on the roof of the church,  driving me into a nervous fit with its interminable patter. Tessie sat  sewing by the window, and every now and then raised her head and looked  at me with such innocent compassion that I began to feel ashamed of my  irritation and looked about for something to occupy me. I had read all  the papers and all the books in the library, but for the sake of  something to do I went to the bookcases and shoved them open with my  elbow. I knew every volume by its colour and examined them all, passing  slowly around the library and whistling to keep up my spirits. I was  turning to go into the dining-room when my eye fell upon a book bound in  serpent skin, standing in a corner of the top shelf of the last bookcase.  I did not remember it, and from the floor could not decipher the pale  lettering on the back, so I went to the smoking-room and called Tessie.  She came in from the studio and climbed up to reach the book.    \"What is it?\" I asked.    \"_The King in Yellow._\"    I was dumfounded. Who had placed it there? How came it in my rooms? I had  long ago decided that I should never open that book, and nothing on earth  could have persuaded me to buy it. Fearful lest curiosity might tempt me  to open it, I had never even looked at it in book-stores. If I ever had  had any curiosity to read it, the awful tragedy of young Castaigne, whom  I knew, prevented me from exploring its wicked pages. I had always  refused to listen to any description of it, and indeed, nobody ever  ventured to discuss the second part aloud, so I had absolutely no  knowledge of what those leaves might reveal. I stared at the poisonous  mottled binding as I would at a snake.    \"Don't touch it, Tessie,\" I said; \"come down.\"    Of course my admonition was enough to arouse her curiosity, and before I  could prevent it she took the book and, laughing, danced off into the  studio with it. I called to her, but she slipped away with a tormenting  smile at my helpless hands, and I followed her with some impatience.    \"Tessie!\" I cried, entering the library, \"listen, I am serious. Put that  book away. I do not wish you to open it!\" The library was empty. I went  into both drawing-rooms, then into the bedrooms, laundry, kitchen, and  finally"]]]
