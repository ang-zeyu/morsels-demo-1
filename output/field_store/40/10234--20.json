I have seen many dying  men, but never so much obstinacy, never such infatuated belief in the  duration of life.\"    \"Then you think he really _is_ dying,\" asked Ramin; and, in spite of  the melancholy accent he endeavored to assume, there was something so  peculiar in his tone, that the priest looked at him very fixedly as he  slowly replied,    \"Yes, air, I think he is.\"    \"Ah!\" was all Monsieur Ramin said; and as the clergyman had now  relaxed his hold of the button, Ramin passed in spite of the  remonstrances of Marguerite, who rushed after the priest. He found  Monsieur Bonelle in bed and in a towering rage.    \"Oh! Ramin, my friend,\" he groaned, \"never take a housekeeper,  and never let her know you have any property. They are harpies,  Ramin,--harpies! such a day as I have had; first, the lawyer, who  comes to write down 'my last testamentary dispositions,' as he calls  them; then the priest, who gently hints that I am a dying man. Oh,  what a day!\"    \"And _did_ you make your will, my excellent friend?\" softly asked  Monsieur Ramin, with a keen look.    \"Make my will?\" indignantly exclaimed the old man; \"make my will? what  do you mean, sir? do you mean to say I am dying?\"    \"Heaven forbid!\" piously ejaculated Ramin.    \"Then why do you ask me if I had been making my will?\" angrily resumed  the old man. He then began to be extremely abusive.    When money was in the way, Monsieur Ramin, though otherwise of a  violent temper, had the meekness of a lamb. He bore the treatment  of his host with the meekest patience, and having first locked the  door so as to make sure that Marguerite would not interrupt them, he  watched Monsieur Bonelle attentively, and satisfied himself that the  Excellent Opportunity he had been ardently longing for had arrived:  \"He is going fast,\" he thought; \"and unless I settle the agreement  to-night, and get it drawn up and signed to-morrow, it will be too  late.\"    \"My dear friend,\" he at length said aloud, on perceiving that the old  gentleman had fairly exhausted himself and was lying panting on his  back, \"you are indeed a lamentable instance of the lengths to which  the greedy lust of lucre will carry our poor human nature. It is  really distressing to see Marguerite, a faithful, attached servant,  suddenly converted into a tormenting harpy by the prospect of a  legacy! Lawyers and priests flock around you like birds of prey,  drawn hither by the scent of gold! Oh, the miseries of having delicate  health combined with a sound constitution and large property!\"    \"Ramin,\" groaned the old man, looking inquiringly into his visitor's  face, \"you are again going to talk to me about that annuity--I know  you are!\"    \"My excellent friend, it is merely to deliver you from a painful  position.\"    \"I am sure, Ramin, you think in your soul I am dying,\" whimpered  Monsieur Bonelle.    \"Absurd, my dear sir. Dying? I will prove to you that you have never  been in better health. In the first place you feel no pain.\"    \"Excepting from rheumatism,\" groaned Monsieur Bonelle.    \"Rheumatism! who ever died of rheumatism? and if that be all--\"    \"No, it is not all,\" interrupted the old man with great irritability;  \"what would you say to the gout getting higher and higher up every  day?\"    \"The gout is rather disagreeable, but if there is nothing else--\"    \"Yes, there is something else,\" sharply said Monsieur Bonelle. \"There  is an asthma that will scarcely let me breathe, and a racking pain in  my head that does not allow me a moment's ease. But if you think I am  dying, Ramin, you are quite mistaken.\"    \"No doubt, my dear friend, no doubt; but in the meanwhile suppose we  talk of this annuity. Shall we say one thousand francs a year.\"    \"What!\" asked Bonelle, looking at him very fixedly.    \"My dear friend, I mistook; I meant two thousand francs per annum,\"  hurriedly rejoined Ramin.    Monsieur Bonelle closed his eyes, and appeared to fall into a gentle  slumber. The mercer coughed; the sick man never moved.    \"Monsieur Bonelle.\"    No reply.    \"My excellent friend.\"    Utter silence.    \"Are you asleep?\"    A long pause.    \"Well, then, what do you say to three thousand?\"    Monsieur Bonelle opened his eyes.    \"Ramin,\" said he, sententiously, \"you are a fool; the house brings me  in four thousand as it is.\"    This was quite false, and the mercer knew it; but he had his own  reasons for wishing to seem to believe it true.    \"Good Heavens!\" said he, with an air of great innocence, \"who could  have thought it, and the lodgers constantly running away. Four  thousand? Well, then, you shall have four thousand.\"    Monsieur Bonelle shut his eyes once more, and murmured \"The mere  rental--nonsense!\" He then folded his hands on his breast, and  appeared to compose himself to sleep.    \"Oh, what a sharp man of business he is!\" Ramin said, admiringly:  but for once omnipotent flattery failed in its effect: \"So acute!\"  continued he, with a stealthy glance at the old man, who remained  perfectly unmoved.    \"I see you will insist upon making it the other five hundred francs.\"    Monsieur Ramin said this as if five thousand five hundred francs had  already been mentioned, and was the very summit of Monsieur Bonelle's  ambition. But the ruse failed in its effect; the sick man never so  much as stirred.    \"But, my dear friend,\" urged Monsieur Ramin in a tone of feeling  remonstrance, \"there is such a thing as being too sharp, too acute.  How can you expect that I shall give you more when your constitution  is so good, and you are to be such a long liver?\"    \"Yes, but I may be carried off one of these days,\" quietly observed  the old man, evidently wishing to turn the chance of his own death to  account.    \"Indeed, and I hope so,\" muttered the mercer, who was getting very  ill-tempered.    \"You see,\" soothingly continued Bonelle, \"you are so good a man of  business, Ramin, that you will double the actual value of the house  in no time. I am a quiet, easy person, indifferent to money; otherwise  this house would now bring me in eight thousand at the very least.\"    \"Eight thousand!\" indignantly exclaimed the mercer. \"Monsieur Bonelle,  you have no conscience. Come now, my dear friend, do be reasonable.  Six thousand francs a year (I don't mind saying six) is really a very  handsome income for a man of your quiet habits. Come, be reasonable.\"  But Monsieur Bonelle turned a deaf ear to reason, and closed his eyes  once more. What between opening and shutting them for the next quarter  of an hour, he at length induced Monsieur Ramin to offer him seven  thousand francs.    \"Very well, Ramin, agreed,\" he quietly said; \"you have made an  unconscionable bargain.\" To this succeeded a violent fit of coughing.    As Ramin unlocked the door to leave, he found old Marguerite, who had  been listening all the time, ready to assail him with a torrent of  whispered abuse for duping her \"poor dear innocent old master into  such a bargain.\" The mercer bore it all very patiently: he could make  all allowances for her excited feelings, and only rubbed his hands and  bade her a jovial good evening.    The agreement was signed on the following day, to the indignation of  old Marguerite, and the mutual satisfaction of the parties concerned.    Every one admired the luck and shrewdness of Ramin, for the old man  every day was reported worse; and it was clear to all that the first  quarter of the annuity would never be paid. Marguerite, in her wrath,  told the story as a grievance to every one; people listened, shook  their heads, and pronounced Monsieur Ramin to be a deuced clever  fellow.    A month elapsed. As Ramin was coming down one morning from the attics,  where he had been giving notice to a poor widow who had failed in  paying her rent, he heard a light step on the stairs. Presently a  sprightly gentleman, in buoyant health and spirits, wearing the form  of Monsieur Bonelle, appeared. Ramin stood aghast.    \"Well, Ramin,\" gaily said the old man, \"how are you getting on? Have  you been tormenting the poor widow up stairs? Why, man, we must live  and let live!\"    \"Monsieur Bonelle,\" said the mercer, in a hollow tone; \"may I ask  where are your rheumatics?\"    \"Gone, my dear friend,--gone.\"    \"And the gout that was creeping higher and higher every day,\"  exclaimed Monsieur Ramin, in a voice of anguish.    \"It went lower and lower, till it disappeared altogether,\" composedly  replied Bonelle.    \"And your asthma--\"    \"The asthma remains, but asthmatic people are proverbially long-lived.  It is, I have been told, the only complaint that Methusalah was  troubled with.\" With this Bonelle opened his door, shut it, and  disappeared.    Ramin was transfixed on the stairs; petrified with intense  disappointment, and a powerful sense of having been duped. When he  was discovered, he stared vacantly, and raved about an Excellent  Opportunity of taking his revenge.    The wonderful cure was the talk of the neighborhood, whenever Monsieur  Bonelle appeared in the streets, jauntily flourishing his cane. In the  first frenzy of his despair, Ramin refused to pay; he accused every  one of having been in a plot to deceive him; he turned off Catharine  and expelled his porter: he publicly accused the lawyer and priest of  conspiracy; brought an action against the doctor and lost it. He had  another brought against him for violently assaulting Marguerite, in  which he was cast in heavy damages. Monsieur Bonelle did not trouble  himself with useless remonstrances, but when his annuity was refused,  employed such good legal arguments, as the exasperated mercer could  not possibly resist."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13797"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#17)"],[1,"Ferdinand's illness, and awful  sudden death.\"    \"I can tell you all about it, as well as any one, for I was one of the  guests at that melancholy wedding. Your friend, and I, and many others  were invited. Hallberg had some idea of not going; he was unwell, with  violent headache and giddiness. But we persuaded him, and he consented  to go with us. The first day he felt tolerably well. We hunted in  the open field; we were all on horseback, the day hot. Hallberg felt  worse. The second day he had a great deal of fever; he could not  stay up. The physician (for fortunately there was one in the company)  ordered rest, cooling medicine, neither of which seemed to do him  good. The rest of the men dispersed, to amuse themselves in various  ways. Only D'Effernay remained at home; he was never very fond of  large societies, and we voted that he was discontented and out of  humor because his betrothed bride was not with him. His room was next  to the sick man's, to whom he gave all possible care and attention,  for poor Hallberg, besides being ill, was in despair at giving so  much trouble in a strange house. D'Effernay tried to calm him on  this point; he nursed him, amused him with conversation, mixed his  medicines, and, in fact, showed more kindness and tenderness, than any  of us would have given him credit for. Before I went to bed I visited  Hallberg, and found him much better, and more cheerful; the doctor  had promised that he should leave his bed next day. So I left him and  retired with the rest of the world, rather late, and very tired, to  rest. The next morning I was awoke by the fatal tidings. I did not  wait to dress, I ran to his room, it was full of people.\"    \"And how, how was the death first discovered?\" inquired Edward, in  breathless eagerness.    \"The servant, who came in to attend on him, thought he was asleep, for  he lay in his usual position, his head upon his hand. He went away  and waited for some time; but hours passed, and he thought he ought to  wake his master to give him his medicine. Then the awful discovery was  made. He must have died peacefully, for his countenance was so calm,  his limbs undisturbed. A fit of apoplexy had terminated his life, but  in the most tranquil manner.\"    \"Incomprehensible,\" said Edward, with a deep sigh. \"Did they take no  measures to restore animation?\"    \"Certainly; all that could be done was done, bleeding, fomentation,  friction; the physician superintended, but there was no hope, it was  all too late. He must have been dead some hours, for he was already  cold and stiff. If there had been a spark of life in him he would have  been saved. It was all over; I had lost my good lieutenant, and the  regiment one of its finest officers.\"    He was silent, and appeared lost in thought. Edward, for his part,  felt overwhelmed by terrible suspicions and sad memories. After a long  pause he recovered himself: \"and where was D'Effernay?\" he inquired.    \"D'Effernay,\" answered the Captain, rather surprised at the question;  \"oh! he was not in the Castle when we made the dreadful discovery: he  had gone out for an early walk, and when he came back late, not before  noon, he learned the truth, and was like one out of his senses. It  seemed so awful to him, because he had been so much, the very day  before, with poor Hallberg.\"    \"Aye,\" answered Edward, whose suspicions were being more and more  confirmed every moment. \"And did he see the corpse, did he go into the  chamber of death?\"    \"No,\" replied the captain; \"he assured us it was out of his power to  do so; he could not bear the sight; and I believe it. People with such  uncontrolled feelings as this D'Effernay, are incapable of performing  those duties which others think it necessary and incumbent on them to  fulfill.\"    \"And where was Hallberg buried?\"    \"Not far from the castle where the mournful event took place.  To-morrow, if we go to the iron foundry, we shall be near the spot.\"    \"I am glad of it,\" cried Edward eagerly, while a host of projects rose  up in his mind. \"But now, captain, I will not trespass any longer on  your kindness. It is late, and we must be up betimes to-morrow. How  far have we to go?\"    \"Not less than four leagues certainly. D'Effernay has arranged that we  shall drive there, and see it all at our leisure: then we shall return  in the evening. Good night, Wensleben.\"    They separated: Edward hurried to his room; his heart overflowed.  Sorrow on the one hand, horror and even hatred on the other, agitated  him by turns. It was long before he could sleep. For the third time  the vision haunted him; but now it was clearer than before; now he  saw plainly the features of him who lay in bed, and of him who stood  beside the bed--they were those of Hallberg and of D'Effernay.    This third apparition, the exact counterpart of the two former (only  more vivid), all that he had gathered from conversations on the  subject, and the contents of Emily's letter, left scarcely the shadow  of a doubt remaining as to how his friend had left the world.    D'Effernay's jealous and passionate nature seemed to allow of the  possibility of such a crime, and it could scarcely be wondered at, if  Edward regarded him with a feeling akin to hatred. Indeed the desire  of visiting Hallberg's grave, in order to place the ring in the  coffin, could alone reconcile Wensleben to the idea of remaining any  longer beneath the roof of a man whom he now considered the murderer  of his friend. His mind was a prey to conflicting doubts; detestation  for the culprit, and grief for the victim, pointed out one line of  conduct, while the difficulty of proving D'Effernay's guilt, and still  more, pity and consideration for Emily, determined him at length to  let the matter rest, and to leave the murderer, if such he really  were, to the retribution which his own conscience and the justice of  God would award him. He would seek his friend's grave, and then he  would separate from D'Effernay, and never see him more. In the midst  of these reflections the servant came to tell him that the carriage  was ready. A shudder passed over his frame as D'Effernay greeted him;  but he commanded himself, and they started on their expedition.    Edward spoke but little, and that only when it was necessary, and  the conversation was kept up by his two companions; he had made every  inquiry, before he set out, respecting the place of his friend's  interment, the exact situation of the tomb, the name of the village,  and its distance from the main road. On their way home, he requested  that D'Effernay would give orders to the coachman to make a round of  a mile or two as far as the village of ----, with whose rector he  was particularly desirous to speak. A momentary cloud gathered on  D'Effernay's brow, yet it seemed no more than his usual expression  of vexation at any delay or hindrance; and he was so anxious to  propitiate his rich visitor, who appeared likely to take the estate  off his hands, that he complied with all possible courtesy. The  coachman was directed to turn down a by-road, and a very bad one it  was. The captain stood up in the carriage and pointed out the village  to him, at some distance off; it lay in a deep ravine at the foot of  the mountains.    They arrived in the course of time, and inquired for the clergyman's  house, which, as well as the church, was situated on rising ground.  The three companions alighted from the carriage, which they left at  the bottom of the hill, and walked up together in the direction of the  rectory. Edward knocked at the door and was admitted, while the two  others sat on a bench outside. He had promised to return speedily,  but to D'Effernay's restless spirit, one-quarter of an hour appeared  interminable.    He turned to the captain and said, in a tone of impatience, \"M. de  Wensleben must have a great deal of business with the rector: we have  been here an immense time, and he does not seem inclined to make his  appearance.    \"Oh, I dare say he will come soon. The matter cannot detain him long.\"    \"What on earth can he have to do here?\"    \"Perhaps you would call it a mere fancy--the enthusiasm of youth.\"    \"It has a name, I suppose?\"    \"Certainly, but--\"    \"Is it sufficiently important, think you, to make us run the risk of  being benighted on such roads as these?\"    \"Why, it is quite early in the day.\"    \"But we have more than two leagues to go. Why will you not  speak?--there cannot any great mystery.\"    \"Well, perhaps not a mystery, exactly, but just one of those subjects  on which we are usually reserved with others.\"    \"So! so!\" rejoined D'Effernay, with a little sneer. \"Some love affair;  some girl or another who pursues him, that he wants to get rid of.\"    \"Nothing of the kind, I can assure you,\" replied the captain drily.  \"It could scarcely be more innocent. He wishes, in fact, to visit his  friend's grave.\"    The listener's expression was one of scorn and anger. \"It is worth the  trouble certainly,\" he exclaimed, with a mocking laugh. \"A charming  sentimental pilgrimage, truly; and pray who is this beloved  friend, over whose resting-place he must shed a tear and plant a  forget-me-not? He told me he had never been in the neighborhood  before.\"    \"No more he had; neither did he know where poor Hallberg was buried  until I told him.\"    \"Hallberg!\" echoed the other in a tone that startled the captain,  and caused him to turn and look fixedly in the speaker's face. It was  deadly pale, and the captain observed the effort which D'Effernay made  to recover his composure.    \"Hallberg!\" he repeated again, in a calmer tone, \"and was Wensleben a  friend of his?\"    \"His bosom friend from childhood. They were brought up together at the  academy. Hallberg left it a year earlier than his friend.\"    \"Indeed!\" said D'Effernay, scowling as he spoke, and working himself  up into a passion. \"And this lieutenant came here on this account,  then, and the"]]]
