And this Bohemian land for which we fight--  [Loves not the master whom the chance of war,  Not its own choice or will, hath given to it.  Men murmur at the oppression of their conscience,  And power hath only awed but not appeased them;  A glowing and avenging mem'ry lives  Of cruel deeds committed on these plains;  How can the son forget that here his father  Was hunted by the blood-hound to the mass?  A people thus oppress'd must still be feared,  Whether they suffer or avenge their wrongs.]    WRANGEL.    But then the Nobles and the Officers?  Such a desertion, such a felony,  It is without example, my Lord Duke,  In the world's history.    WALLENSTEIN.                            They are all mine--  Mine unconditionally--mine on all terms.  Not me, your own eyes you must trust.    [_He gives him the paper containing the written oath._  WRANGEL _reads it through, and, having read it, lays it on  the table, remaining silent_.]                                So then?  Now comprehend you?    WRANGEL.                   Comprehend who can!  My Lord Duke, I will let the mask drop--yes!  I've full powers for a final settlement.  The Rhinegrave stands but four days' march from here  With fifteen thousand men, and only waits  For orders to proceed and join your army.  Those orders _I_ give out, immediately  We're compromised.    WALLENSTEIN.                    What asks the Chancellor?    WRANGEL (_considerately_).    Twelve regiments, every man a Swede--my head  The warranty--and all might prove at last  Only false play--    WALLENSTEIN (_starting_).                                Sir Swede!    WRANGEL (_calmly proceeding_).                         Am therefore forced  T' insist thereon, that he do formally,  Irrevocably break with the Emperor,  Else not a Swede is trusted to Duke Friedland.    WALLENST.    Come, brief, and open! What is the demand?    WRANGEL.    That he forthwith disarm the Spanish regiments  Attached to the Emp'ror, that he seize on Prague,  And to the Swedes give up that city, with  The strong pass Egra.    WALLENSTEIN.                           That is much indeed!  Prague!--Egra's granted--but--but Prague!--'T won't do.  I give you every security  Which you may ask of me in common reason--  But Prague--Bohemia--these, Sir General,  I can myself protect.    WRANGEL.                            We doubt it not.  But 'tis not the protection that is now  Our sole concern. We want security  That we shall not expend our men and money  All to no purpose.    WALLENSTEIN.                        'Tis but reasonable.    WRANGEL.    And till we are indemnified, so long  Stays Prague in pledge.    WALLENSTEIN.                    Then trust you us so little?    WRANGEL (_rising_).    The Swede, if he would treat well with the German,  Must keep a sharp look-out. We have been call'd  Over the Baltic, we have saved the empire  From ruin--with our best blood have we sealed  The liberty of faith and gospel truth.  But now already is the benefaction  No longer felt, the load alone is felt.  Ye look askance with evil eye upon us,  As foreigners, intruders in the empire,  And would fain send us, with some paltry sum  Of money, home again to our old forests.  No, no! my Lord Duke! no!--it never was  For Judas' pay, for chinking gold and silver,  That we did leave our King by the Great Stone[24]  No, not for gold and silver have there bled  So many of our Swedish Nobles--neither  Will we, with empty laurels for our payment,  Hoist sail for our own country. _Citizens_  Will we remain upon the soil, the which  Our Monarch conquer'd for himself, and died.    WALLENST.    Help to keep down the common enemy,  And the fair border land must needs be yours.    WRANGEL.    But when the common enemy lies vanquish'd,  Who knits together our new friendship then?  We know, Duke Friedland! though perhaps the Swede  Ought not to have known it, that you carry on  Secret negotiations with the Saxons.  Who is our warranty, that _we_ are not  The sacrifices in those articles  Which 'tis thought needful to conceal from us?    WALLENSTEIN (_rises_).    Think you of something better, Gustave Wrangel!  Of Prague no more.    WRANGEL.                         Here my commission ends.    WALLENST.    Surrender up to you my capital!  Far liever would I face about, and step  Back to my Emperor.    WRANGEL.                        If time yet permits--    WALLENST.    That lies with me, even now, at any hour.    WRANGEL.    Some days ago, perhaps. Today, no longer;  No longer since Sesina's been a prisoner.               [WALLENSTEIN _is struck, and silenced_.]    My Lord Duke, hear me--We believe that you  At present do mean honorably by us.  Since _yesterday_ we're sure of that--and now  This paper warrants for the troops, there's nothing  Stands in the way of our full confidence.  Prague shall not part us. Hear! The Chancellor  Contents himself with Altstadt; to your Grace  He gives up Ratschin and the narrow side.  But Egra above all must open to us,  Ere we can think of any junction.    WALLENSTEIN.                                  You,  You therefore must I trust, and not you me?  I will consider of your proposition.    WRANGEL.    I must entreat that your consideration  Occupy not too long a time. Already  Has this negotiation, my Lord Duke,  Crept on into the second year! If nothing  Is settled this time, will the Chancellor  Consider it as broken off for ever.    WALLENST.    Ye press me hard. A measure such as this,  Ought to be _thought_ of.    WRANGEL.                     Ay! but think of this too,  That sudden action only can procure it  Success--think first of this, your Highness.                               [_Exit_ WRANGEL.]      SCENE VI      WALLENSTEIN, TERZKY, _and_ ILLO (_re-enter_)    ILLO.        It's all right?    TERZKY.                   Are you compromised?    ILLO.                                This Swede  Went smiling from you. Yes! you're compromised.    WALLENST.    As yet is nothing settled: and (well weighed)  I feel myself inclined to leave it so.    TERZKY.    How? What is that?    WALLENSTEIN.                   Come on me what will come,  The doing evil to avoid an evil  Cannot be good!    TERZKY.                   Nay, but bethink you, Duke.    WALLENST.    To live upon the mercy of these Swedes!  Of these proud-hearted Swedes!--I could not bear it.    ILLO.    Goest thou as fugitive, as mendicant?  Bringest thou not more to them than thou receivest?    WALLENST.    How fared it with the brave and royal Bourbon  Who sold himself unto his country's foes,  And pierced the bosom of his father-land?  Curses were his reward, and men's abhorrence  Avenged th' unnatural and revolting deed.    ILLO.    Is that thy case?    WALLENSTEIN.                   True faith, I tell thee,  Must ever be the dearest friend of man:  His nature prompts him to assert its rights.  The enmity of sects, the rage of parties,  Long cherish'd envy, jealousy, unite;  And all the struggling elements of evil  Suspend their conflict, and together league  In one alliance 'gainst their common foe--  The savage beast that breaks into the fold,  Where men repose in confidence and peace.  For vain were man's own prudence to protect him.  'Tis only in the forehead nature plants  The watchful eye--the back, without defence,  Must find its shield in man's fidelity.    TERZKY.    Think not more meanly of thyself than do  Thy foes, who stretch their hands with joy to greet thee;  Less scrupulous far was the Imperial Charles,  The powerful head of this illustrious house;  With open arms he gave the Bourbon welcome;  For still by policy the world is ruled.      SCENE VII    _To these enter the_ COUNTESS TERZKY    WALLENST.    Who sent for you? There is no business here  For women.    COUNTESS.                      I am come to bid you joy.    WALLENST.    Use thy authority, Terzky; bid her go.    COUNTESS.    Come I perhaps too early? I hope not.    WALLENST.    Set not this tongue upon me, I entreat you:  You know it is the weapon that destroys me.  I am routed, if a woman but attack me:  I cannot traffic in the trade of words  With that unreasoning sex.    COUNTESS.                              I had already  Given the Bohemians a king.    WALLENSTEIN (_sarcastically_).                            They have one,  In consequence, no doubt.    COUNTESS (_to the others_).                        Ha! what new scruple?    TERZKY.    The Duke will not.    COUNTESS.                      He _will not_ what he _must_!    ILLO.    It lies with you now. Try. For I am silenced  When folks begin to talk to me of conscience  And of fidelity.    COUNTESS.                           How? then, when all  Lay in the far-off distance, when the road  Stretch'd out before thine eyes interminably,  Then hadst thou courage and resolve; and now,  Now that the dream is being realized,  The purpose ripe, the issue ascertain'd,  Dost thou begin to play the dastard now?  Plann'd merely, 'tis a common felony;  Accomplish'd, an immortal undertaking:  And with success comes pardon hand in hand,  For all event is God's arbitrament.    SERVANT (_enters_).    The Colonel Piccolomini.    COUNTESS (_hastily_).    Must wait.    WALLENST.    I cannot see him now. Another time.    SERVANT.    But for two minutes he entreats an audience:  Of the most urgent nature is his business.    WALLENST.    Who knows what he may bring us! I will hear him.    COUNTESS (_laughs_).    Urgent for him, no doubt? but thou may'st wait.    WALLENST.    What is it?    COUNTESS.                 Thou shalt be inform'd hereafter.  First let the Swede and thee be compromised.    [_Exit_ SERVANT.]    WALLENST.    If there were yet a choice! if yet some milder  Way of escape were possible--I still  Will choose it, and avoid the last extreme.    COUNTESS.

After this disaster the unity of the Serbian state was completely  destroyed, and it has never since been restored in the same measure.    That part of the country to the south of Skoplje fell completely under  Turkish control; it was here that the famous national hero, Marko  Kraljevi['c] (or King's son), renowned for his prowess, ruled as a vassal  prince and mercenary soldier of the Turks; his father was one of the rebel  princes who fell at the battle of the river Maritsa in 1371. North of  Skoplje, Serbia, with Kru[)s]evac as a new political centre, continued to  lead an independent but precarious existence, much reduced in size and  glory, under a native ruler, Prince Lazar; all the conquests of Stephen  Du[)s]an were lost, and the important coastal province of Zeta, which  later developed into Montenegro, had broken away and proclaimed its  autonomy directly after the death of Tsar Uro[)s].    In 1375 a formal reconciliation was effected with the Patriarch of  Constantinople; the ban placed on the Serbian Church in 1352 was removed  and the independence of the Serbian Patriarchate of Pe['c] (Ipek)  recognised. Meanwhile neither Greeks, Bulgars, nor Serbs were allowed any  peace by the Turks.    In 1389 was fought the great battle of Kosovo Polje, or the Field of  Blackbirds, a large plain in Old Serbia, at the southern end of which is  Skoplje. At this battle Serbian armies from all the Serb lands, including  Bosnia, joined together in defence of their country for the last time. The  issue of the battle was for some time in doubt, but was decided by the  treachery and flight at the critical moment of one of the Serb leaders,  Vuk Brankovi['c], son-in-law of Prince Lazar, with a large number of  troops. Another dramatic incident was the murder of Sultan Murad in his  tent by another Serbian leader, Milo[)s] Obili['c], who, accused of  treachery by his own countrymen, vowed he would prove his good faith, went  over to the Turks and, pretending to be a traitor, gained admission to the  Sultan's presence and proved his patriotism by killing him. The momentary  dismay was put an end to by the energetic conduct of Bayezid, son of  Murad, who rallied the Turkish troops and ultimately inflicted total  defeat on the Serbians. From the effects of this battle Serbia never  recovered; Prince Lazar was captured and executed; his wife, Princess  Milica, had to give her daughter to Bayezid in marriage, whose son thus  ultimately claimed possession of Serbia by right of inheritance. Princess  Milica and her son Stephen continued to live at Kru[)s]evac, but Serbia  was already a tributary of Turkey. In the north, Hungary profited by the  course of events and occupied Belgrade and all northern Serbia, but in  1396 the Turks defeated the Magyars severely at the battle of Nikopolis,  on the Danube, making the Serbs under Stephen fight on the Turkish side.  Stephen also had to help Sultan Bajazet against the Tartars, and fought at  the battle of Angora, in 1402, when Tamerlane captured Bayezid.    After Stephen returned to Serbia he made an alliance with Hungary, which  gave him back Belgrade and northern Serbia; it was at this time (1403)  that Belgrade first became the capital, the political centre having in the  course of fifty years moved from the Vardar to the Danube. The disorders  which followed the defeat of Bayezid gave some respite to the Serbs, but  Sultan Murad II (1421-51) again took up arms against him, and invaded  Serbia as far as Kru[)s]evac.    At the death of Stephen (Lazarevi['c]), in 1427, he was succeeded as  _Despot_ by his nephew, George Brankovi['c]; but the Sultan, claiming  Serbia as his own, immediately declared war on him. The Serbian ruler had  to abandon Belgrade to the Magyars, and Nish and Kru[)s]evac to the Turks.  He then built and fortified the town of Smederevo (or Semendria) lower  down on the Danube, in 1428, and made this his capital. He gave his  daughter in marriage to the Sultan, but in spite of this war soon broke  out again, and in 1441 the Turks were masters of nearly the whole of  Serbia. Later George Brankovi['c] made another alliance with Hungary, and  in 1444, with the help of John Hunyadi, defeated the Turks and liberated  the whole of Serbia as far as the Adriatic, though he remained a tributary  of the Sultan. The same year, however, the Magyars broke the treaty of  peace just concluded with the Turks, and marched against them under their  Polish king, Ladislas; this ended in the disastrous battle of Varna, on  the Black Sea, where the king lost his life. In 1451 Sultan Murad II died  and was succeeded by the Sultan Mohammed. In 1453 this sultan captured  Constantinople (Adrianople had until then been the Turkish capital); in  1456 his armies were besieging Belgrade, but were defeated by John  Hunyadi, who, unfortunately for the Serbs, died of the plague shortly  afterwards. George Brankovi['c] died the same year, and at his death  general disorder spread over the country. The Turks profited by this,  overran the whole of Serbia, and in 1459 captured Smederevo, the last  Serbian stronghold.    Meanwhile Bosnia had been for nearly a hundred years enjoying a false  security as an independent Serb kingdom. Its rulers had hitherto been  known by the title of _Ban_, and were all vassals of the King of Hungary;  but in 1377 Ban Tvrtko profited by the embarrassments of his suzerain in  Poland and proclaimed himself king, the neighbouring kingdom of Serbia  having, after 1371, ceased to exist, and was duly crowned in Saint Sava's  monastery of Mile[)s]evo. The internal history of the kingdom was even  more turbulent than had been that of Serbia. To the endemic troubles of  succession and alternating alliances and wars with foreign powers were  added those of confession. Bosnia was always a no man's land as regards  religion; it was where the Eastern and Western Churches met, and  consequently the rivalry between them there was always, as it is now,  intense and bitter. The Bogomil heresy, too, early took root in Bosnia and  became extremely popular; it was the obvious refuge for those who did not  care to become involved in the strife of the Churches. One of the kings of  Bosnia, Stephen Thomas, who reigned from 1444 till 1461, was himself a  Bogomil, and when at the insistence of the Pope and of the King of  Hungary, whose friendship he was anxious to retain, he renounced his  heresy, became ostensibly a Roman Catholic, and began to persecute the  Bogomils, he brought about a revolution. The rebels fled to the south of  Bosnia, to the lands of one Stephen, who sheltered them, proclaimed his  independence of Bosnia, and on the strength of the fact that Saint Sava's  monastery of Mile[)s]evo was in his territory, announced himself Herzog,  or Duke (in Serbian Herceg, though the real Serb equivalent is _Vojvoda_)  of Saint Sava, ever since when (1448) that territory has been called  Hercegovina. In spite of many promises, neither the Pope nor the King of  Hungary did anything to help Bosnia when the Turks began to invade the  country after their final subjection of Serbia in 1459. In 1463 they  invaded Bosnia and pursued, captured, and slew the last king; their  conquest of the country was complete and rapid. A great exodus of the Serb  population took place to the south, west, and north; but large numbers,  especially of the landowning class, embraced the faith of their conquerors  in order to retain possession of their property. In 1482 a similar fate  befell Hercegovina. Albania had already been conquered after stubborn  resistance in 1478. There remained only the mountainous coastal province  of Zeta, which had been an independent principality ever since 1371. Just  as inland Serbia had perished between the Turkish hammer and the Hungarian  anvil, so maritime Serbia was crushed between Turkey and Venice, only its  insignificance and inaccessibility giving it a longer lease of independent  life. Ivan Crnojevi['c], one of the last independent rulers of Zeta, who  had to fly to Italy in 1480, abandoning his capital, [)Z]abljak, to the  Turks, returned in 1481, when the death of Sultan Mohammed temporarily  raised the hopes of the mountaineers, and founded Cetinje and made it his  capital. His son George, who succeeded him and ruled from 1490 till 1496,  is famous as having set up the first Serbian printing-press there. Its  activities were naturally not encouraged by the Turkish conquest, but it  was of great importance to the national Serbian Church, for which books  were printed with it.    In 1496, Venice having wisely made peace with the Sultan some years  previously, this last independent scrap of Serb territory was finally  incorporated in the Turkish dominions. At the end of the fifteenth century  the Turks were masters of all the Serb lands except Croatia, Slavonia, and  parts of Dalmatia, which belonged to Hungary, and the Dalmatian coast and  islands, which were Venetian. The Turkish conquest of Serbia, which began  in 1371 at the battle of the Maritsa, and was rendered inevitable by the  battle of Kosovo Polje, in 1389, thus took a hundred and twenty-five years  to complete.        16    _The Turkish Dominion_, 1496-1796    The lot of the Serbs under Turkish rule was different from that of their  neighbours the Bulgars; and though it was certainly not enviable, it was  undoubtedly better. The Turks for various reasons never succeeded in  subduing Serbia and the various Serb lands as completely as they had  subdued, or rather annihilated, Bulgaria. The Serbs were spread over a far  larger extent of territory than were the Bulgars, they were further  removed from the Turkish centre, and the wooded and mountainous nature of  their country facilitated even more than in the case of Bulgaria the"]]]
