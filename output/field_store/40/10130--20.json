The trip was  little short of wonderful for its bumpiness. We got to Camaguey sore and  bruised but, as far as we could discover, physically intact, and, having  arrived, may now return to its history and description. May no \"gentle  reader\" who scans these pages repeat our experience in getting there. It  is supposed that here, or immediately here-about, was the place of \"fifty  houses and a thousand people\" encountered by the messengers of Columbus,  when he sent them inland to deliver official letters of introduction to the  gorgeous ruler of the country in which he thought he was. Different writers  tell different stories about the settlement of the place, but there is no  doubt that it was among the earliest to be settled. Columbus gave to a  harbor in that vicinity, in all probability the Bay of Nuevitas, the name  Puerto del Principe, or Port of the Prince. He called the islands of the  neighborhood the Gardens of the King. On that bay, about 1514, Diego  Velasquez founded a city, probably the present Nuevitas, which he is said  to have called Santa Maria. Somewhere from two to ten years later, an  inland settlement was made. This developed into the city that was afterward  given the name of Santa Maria del Puerto del Principe, now very properly  changed to the old Indian name of Camaguey.    If the idea of an inland location was, as it is said to have been,  protection against pirates and buccaneers, it was not altogether a  success. The distinguished pirate, Mr. Henry Morgan, raided the place very  effectively in 1668, securing much loot. In his book, published in 1871,  Mr. Hazard says: \"Puerto Principe (the present Camaguey) is, probably, the  oldest, quaintest town on the island,--in fact, it may be said to be a  finished town, as the world has gone on so fast that the place seems a  million years old, and from its style of dress, a visitor might think he  was put back almost to the days of Columbus.\" There have been changes  since that time, but the old charm is still there, the narrow and crooked  streets, forming almost a labyrinth, the old buildings, and much else that  I earnestly hope may never be changed. There is now an up-to-date hotel,  connected with the railway company, but if I were to go there again and the  old hotel was habitable, I know I should go where I first stayed, and where  we occupied a huge barrack-like room charged on our bill as \"_habitaciones  preferentes_,\" the state chamber. It had a dirty tiled floor, and was the  home of many fleas, but there was something about it that I liked. I do not  mean to say that all of Camaguey, \"the city of the plain,\" is lovely, or  picturesque or even interesting. No more is all of Paris, or Budapest,  or Amsterdam, or Washington. They are only so in some of their component  parts, but it is those parts that remain in the memory. The country around  the city is a vast plain, for many years, and still, a grazing country, a  land of horses and cattle. The charm is in the city itself. If I could see  only one place outside of Havana, I would see Camaguey. A little less than  fifty miles to the north is Nuevitas, reached by one of the first railways  built in Cuba, now if ever little more than the port city for its larger  neighbor. Columbus became somewhat ecstatic over the region. Perhaps it was  then more charming, or the season more favorable, than when I saw it. I  do not recall any feeling of special enthusiasm about its scenic charms.  Perhaps I should have discovered them had I stayed longer. Perhaps I should  have been more impressed had it not been for the impressions of Camaguey. I  saw Nuevitas only briefly on my way eastward on that memorable excursion by  construction train and saddle. The only route then available was by boat  along the north shore, and it was there that we caught the steamer for  Santiago.    That sail along the coast would have afforded greater pleasure had it  lacked the noisy presence of an itinerant opera company whose members  persisted, day and night, in exercising their lungs to the accompaniment of  an alleged piano in the cabin. I have a far more pleasant recollection, or  rather a memory because it stays with me, of music in those waters. The  transport on which I went to Porto Rico, in the summer of 1898, carried,  among other troops, a battery of light artillery. It had an unusually good  bugler, and his sounding of \"taps\" on those soft, starlit nights remains  with me as one of the sweetest sounds I have ever heard. The shrieks,  squalls, and roars of those opera people were in a wholly different class.  About seventy-five miles east of Nuevitas is Gibara, merely a shipping port  for the inland city of Holguin. The former is only one of a number of such  places found along the coast. Most of them are attractive in point of  surrounding scenery, but little or not at all attractive in themselves,  being mere groups of uninteresting structures of the conventional type.  Holguin is perhaps two hundred years old, quite pleasantly situated, but  affording no special points of interest for the tourist. The city is now  easily reached by a branch of the Cuba Railway. It is worth the visit of  those who \"want to see it all.\" Beyond Gibara is Nipe Bay, not improbably  the first Cuban harbor entered by Columbus. Nipe Bay and its near neighbor,  Banes Bay, are the centres of what is now the greatest industrial activity  of any part of the island. Here, recent American investment is measured in  scores of millions of dollars. Here, in the immediate neighborhood, are  some of the largest sugar plantations and mills on the island, the Boston  and the Preston. A little to the west of Gibara are two others, Chaparra  and Delicias. Hitherto, the western half of the island has been, the great  producing district, but present indications point to a not distant time  when the eastern district will rival and, it may be, outstrip the section  of older development. The foundation is already laid for an extensive  enterprise. Nature has afforded one of the finest land-locked harbors in  the world at Nipe, and another, though smaller, a few miles away, at Banes.  The region now has railroad connection with practically all parts of the  island. Around those bays are sugar lands, tobacco lands, fruit lands, and  a few miles inland are the vast iron ore beds that, as they are developed,  will afford employment for an army of workmen. Nipe Bay is the natural  commercial outlet for a vast area of richly productive soil. At present,  the region affords nothing of special interest except its industrial  activities, its miles and miles of sugar cane, its huge mills, and the  villages built to house its thousands of workmen.    Seventy-five miles or so eastward of Nipe, lies one of the most charming  and interesting spots on the island. This is old Baracoa, the oldest  settlement on the island, now to be reached only by water or by the  roughest of journeys over mountain trails. The town itself does not amount  to much, but the bay is a gem, a little, circular basin, forest-shaded to  its border, its waters clear as crystal. Behind it rise the forest-clad  hills, step on step, culminating in _el Yunque_, \"the anvil,\" with an  elevation of about eighteen hundred feet. Baracoa is supposed to be the  place about which Columbus wrote one of his most glowing and extravagant  eulogies. Whether it is really worth the time and the discomfort of a  special trip to see it, is perhaps somewhat doubtful. It is a place of  scenery and sentiment, and little else. There is an old fort on a hilltop,  not particularly picturesque, and an old church in which is a cross quite  doubtfully reported as having been furnished by Columbus. Sometime, years  hence, there will be easier communication, and the fertile hillsides and  still more fertile valleys will supply various produces for consumption in  the United States. About twenty-five miles east of Baracoa is the end of  the island, Cape Maisi. Swinging around that, the coasting steamers turn  due west along the shore to Santiago, passing the harbor of Guantanamo,  with its United States naval station. That place is reached by rail from  Santiago, a highly picturesque route through the Guantanamo valley. Besides  the naval station, the place is a shipping port, affording nothing of  special interest to the traveller who has seen other and more easily  accessible cities of its type. It always seems to me that Santiago, or more  properly Santiago de Cuba, would be more engaging if we could forget the  more recent history of this city, known to most Cubans as Cuba (pronounced  Cooba). No doubt, it is a much better place in which to live than it was  twenty years ago, and much of its old charm remains. Its setting cannot  be changed. It is itself a hillside town, surrounded by hills, with real  mountains on its horizon. The old cathedral, a dominant structure, has  been quite a little patched up in recent years, and shows the patches. The  houses, big and little, are still painted in nearly all the shades of the  spectrum. But there is a seeming change, doubtless psychological rather  than physical. One sees, in imagination, Cervera's squadron \"bottled up\" in  the beautiful harbor, while Sampson's ships lie outside waiting for it to  come out. It is difficult to forget San Juan Hill and El Caney, a few  miles behind the city, and remember only its older stories. A good deal of  history has been made here in the last four hundred years. Its pages  show such names as Velasquez, Grijalva, Hernan Cortes, and Narvaez, and  centuries later, Cespedes, Marti, and Palma. Here was enacted the grim  tragedy of the _Virginius_, and here was the conflict that terminated  Spain's once vast dominion in the western world. My own impression is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1149"],[0,"From London to Land's End (#17)"],[1,"we set foot on in the county of Cornwall.  The  Tamar here is very wide, and the ferry-boats bad; so that I thought  myself well escaped when I got safe on shore in Cornwall.    Saltash seems to be the ruins of a larger place; and we saw many houses,  as it were, falling down, and I doubt not but the mice and rats have  abandoned many more, as they say they will when they are likely to fall.  Yet this town is governed by a mayor and aldermen, has many privileges,  sends members to Parliament, takes toll of all vessels that pass the  river, and have the sole oyster-fishing in the whole river, which is  considerable.  Mr. Carew, author of the \"Survey of Cornwall,\" tells us a  strange story of a dog in this town, of whom it was observed that if they  gave him any large bone or piece of meat, he immediately went out of  doors with it, and after having disappeared for some time would return  again; upon which, after some time, they watched him, when, to their  great surprise, they found that the poor charitable creature carried what  he so got to an old decrepit mastiff, which lay in a nest that he had  made among the brakes a little way out of the town, and was blind, so  that he could not help himself; and there this creature fed him.  He adds  also that on Sundays or holidays, when he found they made good cheer in  the house where he lived, he would go out and bring this old blind dog to  the door, and feed him there till he had enough, and then go with him  back to his habitation in the country again, and see him safe in.  If  this story is true, it is very remarkable indeed; and I thought it worth  telling, because the author was a person who, they say, might be  credited.    This town has a kind of jurisdiction upon the River Tamar down to the  mouth of the port, so that they claim anchorage of all small ships that  enter the river; their coroner sits upon all dead bodies that are found  drowned in the river and the like, but they make not much profit of them.  There is a good market here, and that is the best thing to be said of the  town; it is also very much increased since the number of the inhabitants  are increased at the new town, as I mentioned as near the dock at the  mouth of Hamoaze, for those people choose rather to go to Saltash to  market by water than to walk to Plymouth by land for their provisions.  Because, first, as they go in the town boat, the same boat brings home  what they buy, so that it is much less trouble; second, because  provisions are bought much cheaper at Saltash than at Plymouth.  This, I  say, is like to be a very great advantage to the town of Saltash, and may  in time put a new face of wealth upon the place.    They talk of some merchants beginning to trade here, and they have some  ships that use the Newfoundland fishery; but I could not hear of anything  considerable they do in it.  There is no other considerable town up the  Tamar till we come to Launceston, the county town, which I shall take in  my return; so I turned west, keeping the south shore of the county to the  Land's End.    From Saltash I went to Liskeard, about seven miles.  This is a  considerable town, well built; has people of fashion in it, and a very  great market; it also sends two members to Parliament, and is one of the  five towns called Stannary Towns--that is to say, where the blocks of tin  are brought to the coinage; of which, by itself, this coinage of tin is  an article very much to the advantage of the towns where it is settled,  though the money paid goes another way.    This town of Liskeard was once eminent, had a good castle, and a large  house, where the ancient Dukes of Cornwall kept their court in those  days; also it enjoyed several privileges, especially by the favour of the  Black Prince, who as Prince of Wales and Duke of Cornwall resided here.  And in return they say this town and the country round it raised a great  body of stout young fellows, who entered into his service and followed  his fortunes in his wars in France, as also in Spain.  But these  buildings are so decayed that there are now scarce any of the ruins of  the castle or of the prince's court remaining.    The only public edifices they have now to show are the guild or town  hall, on which there is a turret with a fine clock; a very good free  school, well provided; a very fine conduit in the market-place; an  ancient large church; and, which is something rare for the county of  Cornwall, a large, new-built meeting-house for the Dissenters, which I  name because they assured me there was but three more, and those very  inconsiderable, in all the county of Cornwall; whereas in Devonshire,  which is the next county, there are reckoned about seventy, some of which  are exceeding large and fine.    This town is also remarkable for a very great trade in all manufactures  of leather, such as boots, shoes, gloves, purses, breaches, &c.; and some  spinning of late years is set up here, encouraged by the woollen  manufacturers of Devonshire.    Between these two towns of Saltash and Liskeard is St. Germans, now a  village, decayed, and without any market, but the largest parish in the  whole county--in the bounds of which is contained, as they report,  seventeen villages, and the town of Saltash among them; for Saltash has  no parish church, it seems, of itself, but as a chapel-of-ease to St.  Germans.  In the neighbourhood of these towns are many pleasant seats of  the Cornish gentry, who are indeed very numerous, though their estates  may not be so large as is usual in England; yet neither are they  despicable in that part; and in particular this may be said of them--that  as they generally live cheap, and are more at home than in other  counties, so they live more like gentlemen, and keep more within bounds  of their estates than the English generally do, take them all together.    Add to this that they are the most sociable, generous, and to one another  the kindest, neighbours that are to be found; and as they generally live,  as we may say, together (for they are almost always at one another's  houses), so they generally intermarry among themselves, the gentlemen  seldom going out of the county for a wife, or the ladies for a husband;  from whence they say that proverb upon them was raised, viz., \"That all  the Cornish gentlemen are cousins.\"    On the hills north of Liskeard, and in the way between Liskeard and  Launceston, there are many tin-mines.  And, as they told us, some of the  richest veins of that metal are found there that are in the whole  county--the metal, when cast at the blowing houses into blocks, being, as  above, carried to Liskeard to be coined.    From Liskeard, in our course west, we are necessarily carried to the sea-  coast, because of the River Fowey or Fowath, which empties itself into  the sea at a very large mouth.  And hereby this river rising in the  middle of the breadth of the county and running south, and the River  Camel rising not far from it and running north, with a like large  channel, the land from Bodmin to the western part of the county is almost  made an island and in a manner cut off from the eastern part--the  peninsula, or neck of land between, being not above twelve miles over.    On this south side we came to Foy or Fowey, an ancient town, and formerly  very large--nay, not large only, but powerful and potent; for the Foyens,  as they were then called, were able to fit out large fleets, not only for  merchants' ships, but even of men-of-war; and with these not only fought  with, but several times vanquished and routed, the squadron of the Cinque  Ports men, who in those days were thought very powerful.    Mr. Camden observes that the town of Foy quarters some part of the arms  of every one of those Cinque Ports with their own, intimating that they  had at several times trampled over them all.  Certain it is they did  often beat them, and took their ships, and brought them as good prizes  into their haven of Foy; and carried it so high that they fitted out  their fleets against the French, and took several of their men-of-war  when they were at war with England, and enriched their town by the spoil  of their enemies.    Edward IV. favoured them much; and because the French threatened them to  come up their river with a powerful navy to burn their town, he caused  two forts to be built at the public charge for security of the town and  river, which forts--at least, some show of them--remain there still.  But  the same King Edward was some time after so disgusted at the townsmen for  officiously falling upon the French, after a truce was made and  proclaimed, that he effectually disarmed them, took away their whole  fleet, ships, tackle, apparel, and furniture; and since that time we do  not read of any of their naval exploits, nor that they ever recovered or  attempted to recover their strength at sea.  However, Foy at this time is  a very fair town; it lies extended on the east side of the river for  above a mile, the buildings fair.  And there are a great many flourishing  merchants in it, who have a great share in the fishing trade, especially  for pilchards, of which they take a great quantity hereabouts.  In this  town is also a coinage for the tin, of which a great quantity is dug up  in the country north and west of the town.    The River Fowey, which is very broad and deep here, was formerly  navigable by ships of good burthen as high as Lostwithiel--an ancient and  once a flourishing but now a decayed town; and as to trade and  navigation, quite destitute; which is occasioned by the river being  filled up with sands, which, some say, the tides drive up in stormy  weather from the sea; others say it is by sands washed from the  lead-mines in the hills; the last of which, by the way, I take to be a  mistake, the sand from the hills being not of quantity sufficient to fill  up the channel of a navigable river, and, if it had, might easily have  been stopped by"]]]
