Early in the morning of January the 10th, Mr. Park and his company  left Tesee, and about midday came in sight of the hills in the  vicinity of Kooniakary. Having slept at a small village, the next  morning they crossed a narrow but deep stream, called Krisko, a  branch of the Senegal. Proceeding eastward, about two o'clock they  came in sight of the native town of Jambo, the blacksmith, from which  he had been absent about four years. He was received with the  greatest affection by his relations, but he declared that he would  not quit Mr. Park during his stay at Kooniakary, and they set out for  that place in the morning of the 14th January. About the middle of  the day, they arrived at Soolo, a small village about three miles to  the south of it, where Mr. Park went to visit a slatee, named Salim  Daucari, who had entrusted him with effects to the value of five  slaves, and had given Mr. Park an order for the whole of the debt.  The slatee received his visitors with great kindness. It was,  however, remarkable that the king of Kasson was by some means  apprised of the motions of Mr. Park, for he had not been many hours  at Soolo, when Sambo Sego, the second son of the king of Kasson, came  thither with a party of horse, to inquire what had prevented him from  proceeding to Kooniakary, and waiting upon the king, who he said was  impatient to see him. Salim Daucari apologised for Mr. Park, and  promised to accompany him to Kooniakary. They accordingly departed  from Soolo at sunset, and in about an hour entered Kooniakary, but as  the king had gone to sleep, the interview was deferred till the next  morning, and the travellers slept in the hut of Sambo Sego.        CHAPTER VI.    On the ensuing morning Mr. Park went to have an audience of King  Demba Sego Jalla, but the crowd of people that were assembled to see  him was so great, that he could scarcely gain admittance; he at  length arrived in the presence of the monarch, whom he found sitting  upon a mat in a large hut: he appeared to be about sixty years of  age. He surveyed Mr. Park with great attention, and on being made  acquainted with the object of his journey, the good old king was  perfectly satisfied, and promised him every assistance in his power.  He said that he had seen Major Houghton, and presented him with a  white horse, but that after passing the kingdom of Kaarta, he had  lost his life among the moors, but in what manner he was utterly  ignorant. The audience being ended, Mr. Park returned to his lodging,  where he made up a small present for the king, who sent him in return  a large white bullock.    Although the king was well disposed towards Mr. Park, the latter soon  discovered that very great and unexpected obstacles were likely to  impede his progress. A war was on the eve of breaking out between  Kasson and Kajaaga; the kingdom of Kaarta, through which his route  lay, being involved in the issue, and was also threatened with  hostilities by Bambarra. Taking these circumstances into  consideration, the king advised Mr. Park to remain in the vicinity of  Kooniakary, till some decisive information could be obtained of the  state of the belligerents, which was expected to be received in four  or live days. Mr. Park readily submitted to this proposal, and  returned to Soolo, where he received from Salim Daucari, on Dr.  Laidley's account, the value of three slaves, chiefly in gold dust.    Being anxious to proceed as soon as possible, Mr. Park begged Daucari  to use his interest with the king, to procure him a guide by the way  of Foolado, as it was reported that the war had commenced. Daucari  accordingly set out for Kooniakary on the morning of the 20th, and  the same evening returned with an answer from the king, stating that  his majesty had made an agreement with the king of Kaarta, to send  all merchants and travellers through his dominions, but if Mr. Park  wished to take the route of Foolado, the king gave him permission to  do so, though he could not consistently with his agreement send him a  guide. In consequence of this answer, Mr. Park determined to wait  till he could pass through Kaarta without danger.    In the interim, however, it was whispered abroad, that the white man  had received abundance of gold from Salim Daucari, and on the morning  of the 23rd, Sambo Sego paid Mr. Park a visit, attended by a party of  horsemen, and insisted upon knowing the exact amount of the money  which he had received, declaring at the same time, that one half of  it must go to the king; that he himself must have a handsome present,  as being the king's son, and his attendants, as being the king's  relations. Mr. Park was preparing to submit to this arbitrary  exaction, when Salim Daucari interposed, and at last prevailed upon  Sambo to accept sixteen bars of European merchandize, and some powder  and ball, as a complete payment of every demand that could be made in  the kingdom of Kasson.    Mr. Park resided at Soolo for several days, occasionally visiting  surrounding country, and he reports that the number of towns and  villages, and the extensive cultivation around them, surpassed every  thing he had yet seen in Africa.    The king of Kasson having now obtained information, that the war had  not yet commenced between Bambarra and Kaarta, and that Mr. Park  might probably pass through the latter country before the Bambarra  army invaded it, sent two guides early on the morning of the 3rd of  February, to conduct him to the frontiers. He accordingly took leave  of Salim Daucari, and Jambo the blacksmith, and about ten o'clock  departed from Soolo. In the afternoon of the 4th, they reached Kimo,  a large village, the residence of Madi Konko, governor of the hilly  country of Kasson, which is called Soromma.    At Kimo, the guides, appointed by the king of Kasson, left Mr. Park,  and he waited at this place till the 7th, when he departed, with Madi  Konko's son as a guide. On the 8th of February they travelled over a  rough stony country, and, having passed a number of villages, arrived  at Lackarago, a small village standing upon the ridge of hills that  separates Kasson from Kaarta. The following morning they left  Lackarago, and soon perceived, towards the south-east, the mountains  of Fooladoo. Proceeding with great difficulty down a stony and abrupt  precipice, they continued their way in a dry bed of a river, where  the trees, meeting over head, made the place dark and cool. About ten  o'clock they reached the sandy plains of Kaarta, and at noon came to  a watering place, where a few strings of beads purchased as much milk  and corn meal as they could eat. Provisions were here so plentiful,  that the shepherds seldom asked any return for the refreshment a  traveller required. At sunset the travellers reached Feesurah, where  they rested.    Mr. Park and his attendants remained at Feesurah, during the whole of  the following day, for the purpose of learning more exactly the  situation of affairs, before they ventured further. Their landlord  asked so exorbitant a sum for their lodging, that Mr. Park refused to  submit to his demand, but his attendants, frightened at the reports  of approaching war, would not proceed unless he was satisfied, and  persuaded him to accompany them to Kemmoo for their protection on the  road. This Mr. Park accomplished by presenting his host with a  blanket to which he had taken a liking.    Matters being thus amicably adjusted, our travellers again set out on  the 11th, preceded by their landlord of Feesurah on horseback. This  man was one of those negroes who observe the ceremonial part of  Mahometanism, but retain all their pagan superstitions, and even  drink strong liquors; they are called Johars or Jowers, and are very  numerous in Kaarta. When the travellers had got into a lonely wood,  he made a sign for them to stop, and taking hold of a hollow niece of  bamboo, that hung as an amulet round his neck, whistled very loudly  three times. Mr. Park began to suspect it was a signal for some of  his associates to attack the travellers, but the man assured him it  was done to ascertain the successful event of their journey. He then  dismounted, laid his spear across the road and having said several  short prayers, again gave three loud whistles; after which he  listened, as if expecting an answer, but receiving none, said they  might proceed without fear, for no danger actually existed.    On the morning of the 12th, they departed from Karan Kalla, and it  being but a short day's journey to Kemmoo, they travelled slower than  usual, and amused themselves by collecting eatable fruits near the  road side. Thus engaged, Mr. Park had wandered a short distance from  his people, when two negro horsemen, armed with muskets, came  galloping from the thickets. On seeing them, he made a full stop; the  horsemen did the same, and all three seemed equally surprised and  confounded. As he approached them, their fears increased, and one  casting upon him a look of horror, rode off at full speed; while the  other, in a panic of fear, put his hand over his eyes, and continued  muttering prayers, till his horse, apparently without his knowledge,  slowly conveyed him after his companion. About a mile to the westward  they fell in with Mr. Park's attendants, to whom they related a  frightful story: their fears had dressed him in the flowing robes of  a tremendous spirit, and one of them affirmed, that a blast of wind,  cold as water, poured down upon him from the sky, while he beheld the  dreadful apparition.    About two o'clock, Mr. Park entered the capital of Kaarta, which is  situate in the midst of an open plain, the country for two miles  round being cleared of wood. They immediately proceeded to the king's  residence, and Mr. Park, being surrounded by the astonished  multitude, did not attempt to dismount, but sent in the landlord of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12668"],[0,"An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales, Volume 2 (#17)"],[1,"they were  found.    On the morning of Christmas Day, the governor was informed that two  seamen belonging to the _Reliance_ had discovered the body of a  soldier (who had been for two days missing from the look-out post on the  South Head, where he was on duty), lying in a mangled state, the head and  hands being cut off. Some words having passed between him and a soldier,  who had been also heard to threaten him, he was suspected of having  committed the murder, and on the 30th was put on his trial for the same.  Nothing, however, appeared before the court that could substantiate the  charge of murder against him; neither was it clearly ascertained that  violent hands had been laid on the deceased. As it had been foreseen that  direct proof would be wanting, it was deemed expedient to obtain what  might be, though not positive, yet of a nature to be nearly as  satisfactory. With this view, the suspected person was directed to handle  and bury the body, which he did without any apparent emotion; nor did the  body bleed at his touch, or exhibit any sign that superstition or  ignorance could turn into an accusation against him; he observing at the  same time, that, as he had never had any quarrel with the deceased, he  could have no objection to perform this last friendly office for him.    At this court a settler was fined the sum of 40 shillings, and ordered to  labour for six weeks, being convicted of disobeying the public orders of  the colony.    The commander of the wrecked ship, _Sydney Cove_, having solicited  the governor to spare him the Colonial schooner for the purpose of  visiting the wreck of his ship, and the six men whom he had left upon the  island in charge of what had been landed; though he could very ill part  with the services of the vessel at this time, yet, in consideration of  the melancholy situation of the people, and the chance that there might  be of saving something for the benefit of the underwriters, he consented;  and about the latter end of the month the _Francis_ sailed with  Captain Hamilton to the southward.    The weather was now becoming exceedingly hot; and as, at this season of  the year, the heat of the sun was so intense that every substance became  a combustible, and a single spark, if exposed to the air, in a moment  became a flame, much evil was to be dreaded from fire. On the east side  of the town of Sydney, a fire, the effect of intoxication or  carelessness, broke out among the convicts' houses, when three of them  were quickly destroyed; and three miles from the town another house was  burnt by some run-away wretches, who, being displeased with the owner,  took this diabolical method of showing it.    The public labour of the month at Sydney comprised the covering of the  new store-house; finishing the church tower; constructing another  wind-mill, of which the beams of the second floor were laid; completing  the barracks of the assistant surgeons, with necessary offices; digging  the foundation of a house for the master boat-builder; and taking down  one of the old marine barracks, on the site of which the governor  proposed to erect a granary.    At Parramatta and Toongabbie the wheat was nearly all got in and secured.  At the latter of these places, a capital barn had been erected for its  reception, 90 feet in length, with a complete floor, on which eight or  nine pairs of thrashers could be employed without any inconvenience.    In order to mark the annual* increase, it may be proper to insert in this  place an account of the live-stock and land in cultivation at the close  of the year, belonging to government, the civil and military officers,  the settlers, and others.

In addition to their natural vicious propensities, they conceived  an opinion that there was a colony of white people, which had been  discovered in this country, situated to the SW of the settlement, from  which it was distant between three and four hundred miles, and in which  they were assured of finding all the comforts of life, without the  necessity of labouring for them.    It was discovered, that, in consequence of this extraordinary rumour, a  plan had been formed, by means of a correspondence carried on between  these people, from one district to another, of escaping from the colony;  which was to be put in execution so soon as they had completed a  sufficient stock of provisions. The place of general rendezvous was fixed  upon, and they were furnished with a paper of written instructions for  their guidance to this fancied paradise, or to China; in addition to  which, they had been supplied with the figure of a compass drawn upon  paper.    Having received early information of the intentions of this party, the  governor wrote to a magistrate at Parramatta, desiring that he would go  to Toongabbie, where the principal part of the malcontents were employed,  and point out to them the danger to which so ill-advised a step would  expose them; but, as to attempt to reason with ignorance and obstinacy  was only to waste time, he was to acquaint them, that the governor would  allow any four of them whom they should select from their number, and who  they might think capable of travelling over steep and rocky mountains,  through thick and extensive woods, and fording deep and rapid streams, to  proceed as far as they should find themselves able with such provisions  as they could carry. That further, for the preservation of the lives of  those four men, he would order three other people, who were accustomed to  the woods of this country, and well acquainted with the savages of the  mountains, to accompany and lead them in the direction pointed out in  their written instructions,    On conversing with these infatuated people, it appeared, that the history  of the supposed settlement had its rise from some strange and  unintelligible account which one of these men, who had left his work, and  resided for some time with the natives, had collected from the mountain  savages.    A very few days demonstrated the effect of the governor's address to  these ignorant people. He received information, that considerable numbers  of them were assembling for the purpose of proceeding in quest of the new  settlement. He, therefore, directed a party of armed constables, to  waylay and secure as many as they were able; which was effected, and  sixteen were taken and put into confinement. On speaking to them the  following day, they appeared to be totally ignorant whither they were  going; but, observing in them as much obstinacy as ignorance, the  governor justly conceived that he could not use an argument more likely  to convince them of their misconduct, than by ordering a severe corporal  punishment to be inflicted at Sydney on those who appeared to be the  principals in this business; which was accordingly put in execution;  seven of them receiving each two hundred lashes; the remainder, after  being punished at Parramatta, were sent to hard labour and strictly  looked after.    On enquiry it appeared, that this party was composed of several who were  present when the magistrate addressed them by order of the governor; and  that others had assembled from different farms, which were situated at a  considerable distance from each other. The trouble taken to collect and  mislead these people proved to him that it was the work of some wicked  incendiary, who designed by this means to embarrass the public concerns  of the colony, and thereby throw obstacles in the way of his government.    Being, on further consideration of the necessity of checking this spirit  of emigration, determined to convince them, by their own experience, of  the danger and difficulties which attended it, the governor caused four  of the strongest and hardiest among them to be chosen by themselves, and  properly prepared for a journey of discovery. They were to be accompanied  by three men, upon whom the governor knew he could depend, and who were  to lead them back, when fatigued and exhausted with their journey, over  the very worst and most dangerous part of the country. This plan was no  sooner settled, than the governor received information on which he could  rely, that a party of these miscreants had concerted with the four  deputies to meet them at a certain place, where they were to murder the  persons intended to be their guides, possess themselves of their arms and  provisions, and then pursue their own route. This diabolical scheme was  counter-acted by the addition of four soldiers to the guides; and on the  14th they set off from Parramatta.    On the 24th the soldiers returned with three of the deputies, who, having  gained the foot of the first mountains,"]]]
