About five leaves grow on each  bough, and, instinctively, you consider them the fingers of the arms.    It was only three leagues to the Bolivian town of Piedra Blanca, but  the \"Bahia do Marengo\" took three hours to steam the short distance,  for five times we had to stop on the way, owing to the bearings  becoming heated. These the Brazilian engineer cooled with pails of  water.    In the beautiful Bay of Caceres, much of which was grown over with  lotus and Victoria Regia, we finally anchored. This Bolivian village is  about eighteen days' sail up the river from Montevideo on the seacoast.    Chartering the \"General Pando,\" a steamer of 25 h.p. and 70 ft. long,  we there completed our preparations, and finally steamed away up the  Alto Paraguay, proudly flying the Bolivian flag of red, yellow, and  green. As a correct plan of the river had to be drawn, the steamer only  travelled by day, when we were able to admire the grandeur of the  scenery, which daily grew wilder as the mountains vied with each other  in lifting their rugged peaks toward heaven. From time to time we  passed one of the numerous islands the Paraguay is noted for. These are  clothed with such luxuriant vegetation that nothing less than an army  of men with axes could penetrate them. The land is one great, wild,  untidy, luxuriant hot-house, \"built by nature for herself.\" The puma,  jaguar and wildcat are here at home, besides the anaconda and boa  constrictor, which grow to enormous lengths. The Yaci Reta, or Island  of the Moon, is the ideal haunt of the jaguar, and as we passed it a  pair of those royal beasts were playing on the shore like two enormous  cats. As they caught sight of us, one leapt into the mangrove swamp,  out of sight, and the other took a plunge into the river, only to rise  a few yards distant and receive an explosive bullet in his head. The  mangrove tree, with its twisting limbs and bright green foliage, grows  in the warm water and foetid mud of tropical countries. It is a type of  death, for pestilence hangs round it like a cloud. At early morning  this cloud is a very visible one. The peculiarity of the tree is that  its hanging branches themselves take root, and, nourished by such  putrid exhalations, it quickly spreads.    There were also many floating islands of fantastic shape, on which  birds rested in graceful pose. We saw the _garza blanca_, the aigrets  of which are esteemed by royalty and commoner alike, along with other  birds new and strange. To several on board who had looked for years on  nothing but the flat Argentine pampas, this change of scenery was most  exhilarating, and when one morning the sun rose behind the \"Golden  Mountains,\" and illuminated peak after peak, the effect was glorious.  So startlingly grand were some of the colors that our artist more than  once said he dare not paint them, as the world would think that his  coloring was not true to nature.    Many were the strange sights we saw on the shore. Once we were amused  at the ludicrous spectacle of a large bird of the stork family, which  had built its nest in a tree almost overhanging the river. The nest was  a collection of reeds and feathers, having two holes in the bottom,  through which the legs of the bird were hanging. The feet, suspended  quite a yard below the nest, made one wonder how the bird could rise  from its sitting position.    Every sight the traveller sees, however, is not so amusing. As darkness  creeps over earth and sky, and the pale moonbeams shed a fitful light,  it is most pathetic to see on the shore the dead trunk and limbs of a  tree, in the branches of which has been constructed a rude platform, on  which some dark-minded Indian has reverently lifted the dead body of  his comrade. The night wind, stirring the dry bones and whistling  through the empty skull, makes weird music!    The banks of the stream had gradually come nearer and nearer to us, and  the great river, stretching one hundred and fifty miles in width where  it pours its volume of millions of tons of water into the sea at  Montevideo, was here a silver ribbon, not half a mile across.    Far be it from me to convey the idea that life in those latitudes is  Eden. The mosquitos and other insects almost drive one mad. The country  may truly be called a naturalists' paradise, for butterflies, beetles,  and creeping things are multitudinous, but the climate, with its damp,  sickly heat, is wholly unsuited to the Anglo-Saxon. Day after day the  sun in all his remorseless strength blazes upon the earth, is if  desirous of setting the whole world on fire. The thermometer in the  shade registered 110, 112 and 114 degrees Fahrenheit, and on one or two  memorable days 118 degrees. The heat in our little saloon at times rose  as high as 130 degrees, and the perspiration poured down in streams on  our almost naked bodies. We seemed to be running right into the brazen  sun itself.    One morning the man on the look-out descried deer on the starboard bow,  and arms were quickly brought out, ready for use. Our French hunter was  just taking aim when it struck me that the deer moved in a strange way.  I immediately asked him to desist. Those dark forms in the long grass  seemed, to my somewhat trained eyes, naked Indians, and as we drew  nearer to them so it proved, and the man was thankful he had withheld  his fire.    After steaming for some distance up the river several dug-outs, filled  with Guatos Indians, paddled alongside us. An early traveller in those  head-waters wrotes of these: \"Some of the smaller tribes were but a  little removed from the wild brutes of their own jungles. The lowest in  the scale, perhaps, were the Guatos, who dwell to the north of the Rio  Apa. This tribe consisted of less than one hundred persons, and they  were as unapproachable as wild beasts. No other person, Indian or  foreigner, could ever come near but they would fly and hide in  impenetrable jungles. They had no written language of their own, and  lived like unreasoning animals, without laws or religion.\"    The Guato Indian seems now to be a tame and inoffensive creature, but  well able to strike a bargain in the sale of his dug-out canoes,  home-made guitars and other curios. In the wrobbling canoe they are  very dexterous, as also in the use of their long bows and arrows; the  latter have points of sharpened bone. When hungry, they hunt or fish.  When thirsty, they drink from the river; and if they wish clothing,  wild cotton grows in abundance.    These Indians, living, as they do, along the banks of the river and  streams, have recently been frequently visited by the white man on his  passage along those natural highways. It is, therefore superfluous for  me to add that they are now correspondingly demoralized. It is a most  humiliating fact that just in proportion as the paleface advances into  lands hitherto given up to the Indian so those races sink. This  degeneration showed itself strikingly among the Guatos in their  inordinate desire for _cachaca_, or \"firewater.\" Although extremely  cautious and wary in their exchanges to us, refusing to barter a bow  and arrows for a shirt, yet, for a bottle of cachaca, they would gladly  have given even one of their canoes. These _ketchiveyos_, twenty or  twenty-five feet long by about twenty inches wide, they hollow from the  trunk of the cedar, or _lapacho_ tree. This is done with great labor  and skill; yet, as I have said, they were boisterously eager to  exchange this week's work for that which they knew would lead them to  fight and kill one another.    As a mark of special favor, the chief invited me to their little  village, a few miles distant. Stepping into one of their canoes--a  large, very narrow boat, made of one tree-trunk hollowed out by fire--I  was quickly paddled by three naked Indians up a narrow creek, which was  almost covered with lotus. The savages, standing in the canoe, worked  the paddles with a grace and elegance which the civilized man would  fail to acquire, and the narrow craft shot through the water at great  speed. The chief sat in silence at the stern. I occupied a palm-fibre  mat spread for me amidships. The very few words of Portuguese my  companions spoke or understood rendered conversation difficult, so the  stillness was broken only by the gentle splash of the paddles. On each  side the dense forest seemed absolutely impenetrable, but we at last  arrived at an opening. As we drew ashore I noticed that an Indian path  led directly inland.    Leaving our dug-out moored with a fibre rope to a large mangrove tree,  we started to thread our way through the forest, and finally reached a  clearing. Here we came upon a crowd of almost naked and extremely  dejected-looking women. Many of these, catching sight of me, sped into  the jungle like frightened deer. The chief's wife, however, at a word  from him, received me kindly, and after accepting a brass necklace with  evident pleasure, showed herself very affable. Poor lost Guatos! Their  dejected countenances, miserable grass huts, alive with vermin, and  their extreme poverty, were most touching. Inhabiting, as they do, one  of the hottest and dampest places on the earth's surface, where  mosquitos are numberless, the wonder is that they exist at all. Truly,  man is a strange being, who can adapt himself to equatorial heat or  polar frigidity. The Guatos' chief business in life seemed to consist  in sitting on fibre mats spread on the ground, and driving away the  bloodthirsty mosquitos from their bare backs. For this they use a fan  of their own manufacture, made from wild cotton, which there seems to  abound. Writing of mosquitos, let me say these Indian specimens were a  terror to us all. What numbers we killed! I could write this account in  their blood. It was _my_ blood, though--before they got it! Men who  hunt the tiger in cool bravery boiled with indignation before these  awful pests, which stabbed and stung with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7506"],[0,"The Huge Hunter; Or, The Steam Man of the Prairies (#16)"],[1,"camping ground possessed another advantage  which, during the discussion, had been altogether overlooked.    During the afternoon they had shot a fine-looking antelope, cooking a  portion at the time upon the prairie. A goodly portion was left, and  they now had an opportunity of kindling their fire without the  liability of its being seen, as would have been the case had they  encamped in any other place.    This being agreed to, the fire was speedily kindled, and the trapper  himself began the culinary performance. It was executed with the  characteristic excellence of the hunter, and a luscious meal was thus  provided for all. At its conclusion, all stretched themselves upon the  ground for the purpose of smoking and chatting, as was their usual  custom at such times.    The evening whiled pleasantly away, and when it had considerably  advanced, the question of who should act as sentinel was discussed. Up  to this, young Brainerd had never once performed that duty at night,  although he had frequently solicited the privilege. He now-asked  permission to try his hand. After considerable talk it was agreed that  he might do. The trapper had lost so much sleep, that he was anxious  to secure a good night's rest, and the careful scrutiny which he had  taken of the surrounding prairie convinced him that no danger  threatened. So he felt little apprehension in acceding to the wish of  the boy.    At a late hour the two men stretched themselves upon the ground, with  their blankets gathered about them, and they were soon wrapped in  profound slumber, while Johnny, filled with the importance and  responsibility of his duty, felt as though he should never need  another hour's sleep. He was sure of being able to keep up an  unintermitting watch several days and nights, should it become  necessary.    Following the usual custom of sentinels, he shouldered his gun and  paced back and forth before the smoldering camp-fire, glancing in  every direction, so as to make sure that no enemy stole upon him  unawares.    It formed a curious picture, the small fire burning in the  valley, motionless forms stretched out before it, the huge steam man  silent and grim standing near, the dwarfed boy, pacing slowly back and  forth, and, above all, the moon shining down upon the silent prairie.  The moon was quite faint, so that only an indistinct view of objects  could be seen. Occasionally Johnny clambered up the bank and took a  survey of the surrounding plains; bat seeing nothing at all  suspicious, he soon grew weary of this, and confined his walks to the  immediate vicinity of the camp-fire, passing back and forth between  the narrow breadth of the valley.    As the hours dragged slowly by, the boy gradually fell into a reverie,  which made him almost unconscious of external things. And it was while  walking thus that he did not observe a large wolf advance to the edge  of the gully, look down, and then whisk back out of sight before the  sentinel wheeled in his walk and faced him.    Three separate times was this repeated, the wolf looking down in such  an earnest, searching way that it certainly would have excited the  remark and curiosity of any one observing it. The third glance  apparently satisfied the wolf; for it lasted for a few seconds, when  he withdrew, and lumbered away at an awkward rate, until a rod or two  had been passed, when the supposed wolf suddenly rose on its hind  legs, the skin and head were shifted to the arms of the Indian, and he  continued on at a leisurely gait until he joined fully fifty comrades,  who were huddled together in a grove, several hundred yards away.    In the meantime young Brainerd, with his rifle slung over his  shoulder, was pacing back and forth in the same deliberate manner, his  mind busily engaged on an 'improvement' upon the steam man, by which  he was to walk backward as well as forward, although he couldn't  satisfactorily determine how he was to go up and down hill with  safety.    Still occupied in the study of the subject, he took a seat by the  half-extinguished camp-fire and gazed dreamily into the embers. It had  been a habit with him, when at home, to sit thus for hours, on the  long winter evenings, while his mind was so busily at work that he was  totally oblivious to whatever was passing around him.    It must have been that the boy seated himself without any thought of  the inevitable result of doing so; for none knew better than he that  such a thing was fatal to the faithful performance of a sentinel's  duty: and the thought that his three companions, in one sense, had put  their safety in his hands, would have prevented anything like a  forgetfulness of duty.    Be that as it may, the boy had sat thus less than half an hour when a  drowsiness began stealing over him. Once he raised his head and  fancied he saw a large wolf glaring down upon him from the bank above,  but the head was withdrawn so quickly that he was sure it was only a  phantom of his brain.    So he did not rise from his seat, but sitting still he gradually sunk  lower, until in a short time he was sleeping as soundly as either of  the three around him.    Another hour wore away, and the fire smoldered lower and all was  still.    Then numerous heads peered over the edge of the ravine for a few  seconds, and as suddenly withdrew.    A few minutes later a curious sight might have been seen, a sight  somewhat resembling that of a parcel of school-boys making their  gigantic snow-balls. The fifty Indians, the greater portion of whom  had patiently waited in the adjoining grove, while their horses were  securely fastened near, issued like a swarm of locusts and began  rolling huge bowlders toward the valley. Some of them were so large  that half a dozen only succeeded in moving them with the greatest  difficulty.    But they persevered, working with a strange persistency and silence,  that gave them the appearance of so many phantoms engaged at their  ghostly labor. Not a word was exchanged, even in the most guarded of  tones, for each understood his part.    In time half a dozen of these immense stones reached the edge of the  ravine. They were ranged side by side, a few feet apart, so as not to  be in each other's way, and the Indians stood near, waiting until  their work should be completed.    Some signal was then made, and then one of these bowlders rolled down  in the ravine. Even this scarcely made any perceptible noise, the  yielding ground receiving it like a cushion, as it came to a halt near  the center of the valley.    When this was done a second followed suit, being so guided that it did  not grate against its companion, but came to rest very near it.    Then another followed, and then another and another, in the same  stealthy manner, until over a dozen were in the valley below.    This completed, the phantom-like figures descended like so many  shadows, and began tugging again at the bowlders.    Not a word was exchanged, for each knew what was required of him.  Fully an hour more was occupied, by which time the labor was finished.    The bowlders were arranged in the form of an impassable wall across  the narrow valley, and the steam man was so thoroughly imprisoned that  no human aid could ever extricate him.                       CHAPTER XX. THE CONCLUDING CATASTROPHE.    BALDY BICKNELL, the trapper, was the first to discover the peril of  himself and party.    When the Indians had completed their work it lacked only an hour of  daylight. Having done all that was necessary, the savages took their  stations behind the wall, lying flat upon the ground, where they were  invisible to the whites, but where every motion of theirs could be  watched and checkmated.    When the trapper opened his eyes he did not stir a limb, a way into  which he had got during his long experience on the frontiers. He  merely moved his head from side to side, so as to see anything that  was to be seen.    The first object that met his eye was the boy Brainerd, sound asleep.  Apprehensive then that something had occurred, he turned his startled  gaze in different directions, scanning everything as well as it could  be done in the pale moonlight.    When he caught sight of the wall stretched across the valley, he  rubbed his eyes, and looked at it again and again, scarcely able to  credit his senses. He was sure it was not there a few hours before,  and he could not comprehend what it could mean; but it was a verity,  and his experience told him that it could be the work of no one except  the Indians, who had outwitted him at last.    His first feeling was that of indignation toward the boy who had  permitted this to take place while he was asleep, but his mind quickly  turned upon the more important matter of meeting the peril, which,  beyond all doubt, was of the most serious character.    As yet he had not stirred his body, and looking toward the prison  wall, he caught a glimpse of the phantom-like figures, as they  occasionally flitted about, securing the best possible position,  before the whites should awake.    This glimpse made everything plain to the practical mind of Baldy  Bicknell. He comprehended that the red-skins had laid a plan to entrap  the steam man.  More than to entrap themselves, and that, so far as he  could judge, they had succeeded completely.    It was the tightest fix in which he had ever been caught, and his  mind, fertile as it was in expedients at such crises, could see no way  of meeting the danger.    He knew the Indians had horses somewhere at command, while neither he  nor his comrades had a single one. The steam man would be unable to  pass that formidable wall, as it was not to be supposed that he had  been taught the art of leaping.    Whatever plan of escape was determined upon, it was evident that the  steamer would have to be abandoned; and this necessitated, as an  inevitable consequence, that the whites would have to depend upon  their legs.
