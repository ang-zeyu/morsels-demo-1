Such is the faithful history of one hundred and fifty persons, who were  left upon the raft; only fifteen of whom were saved; and five of that  number were so reduced, that they died of fatigue, shortly after arriving  at St. Louis; those who still exist are covered with scars, and the cruel  sufferings which they have endured have greatly impaired their  constitution.    In terminating this recital of the unparalelled sufferings, to which we  were a prey for thirteen days, we beg leave to name those who shared them  with us:    _Alive when we were saved._              _Notice of their subsequent fate_.  Messrs.  Dupont, Captain of Foot;                  In Senegal.  L'Heureux, Lieutenant;                    In Senegal.  Lozach, Sub-Lieutenant;                   Dead.  Clairet, Sub-Lieutenant;                  Dead.  Griffon du Bellay, Ex-Clerk of the Navy;  Out of employment.  Coudin, _eleve de marine_;                Midshipman.  Charlot, Serjeant Major (of Toulon);      In Senegal.  Courtade, Master Gunner;                  Dead.  Lavillette.                               In France.  Coste, Sailor;                            In France.  Thomas, Pilot;                            In France.  Francois, Hospital Keeper;                In the Indies.  Jean Charles, black Soldier;              Dead.  Correard, Engineer Geographer;            Without employment.  Savigny, Surgeon.                         Resigned.    The governor having been apprised of our arrival, sent a large-decked  vessel to convey us ashore. This vessel also brought us wine and some  refreshments; the master, thinking the tide sufficiently high to enable him  to pass the bar of sand, which lies at the mouth of the river, resolved to  land us at once upon the island. Those who were the most feeble among us,  were placed below deck, together with a few of the least skilful of the  negroes, who composed the crew, and the hatches closed upon us, to prevent  the sea from coming in between decks, while the dangers occasioned by the  surf running over the bar, was passed. The wretched condition to which we  were reduced, was such as to awaken a feeling of sympathy, even among the  blacks, who shed tears of compassion for our misfortunes; during this time,  the most profound silence reigned on board; the voice of the master alone  was heard; as soon as we were out of danger, the negroes recommenced their  songs, which did not cease till we arrived at St. Louis.    We were received in the most brilliant manner; the governor, several  officers, both English and French, came to meet us, and one of the officers  in this numerous train, held out to us a hand, which a fortnight before,  had, as it were, plunged us in the depth of despair by loosening the  tow-rope which made our raft fast to the boat. But such is the effect  produced by the sight of wretches who have just been miraculously  delivered, that there was not a single person, either English or French,  who did not shed tears of compassion on seeing the deplorable condition to  which we were reduced; all seemed truly affected by our distress, and by  the intrepidity which we had shewn on the raft. Yet we could not contain  our indignation, at the sight of some persons in this train.    Some of us were received by two French merchants, who bestowed on us every  attention, and rendered every assistance in their power. Messrs. Valentin  and Lasalle stimulated by that natural impulse which incites man to assist  a fellow creature in distress, is, on that account, entitled to the highest  praise. We are extremely sorry to say that they were the only colonists who  gave assistance to the shipwrecked people belonging to the raft.    Before we proceed to the second part of our work, in which we shall include  the history of the Camp of Daccard and of the unfortunate persons  shipwrecked in the Medusa, who remained in the hospitals of St. Louis, let  us cast our eyes back, and examine what were the operations of the boats  after the tow-lines had been loosened, and the raft abandoned.    The long-boat was the last which we lost sight of. It descried the land and  the Isles of Arguin, the same evening before sun-set: the other boats must,  therefore, necessarily, have seen it some time before, which proves, we  think, that when we were abandoned, we were at a very small distance from  the coast. Two boats succeeded in reaching Senegal without accident; they  were those in; which were the governor and the commander of the frigate.  During the bad weather, which forced the other boats to make the land,  these two had a great deal of difficulty to resist a heavy sea and an  extremely high wind. Two young seamen gave proofs of courage and coolness  in these critical moments, in the barge. Mr. Barbotin, _eleve_ of the  marine: and in the captain's barge, Mr. Rang,[32] also an _eleve_ of the  marine, as deserving of praise for his knowledge, as for the courage he  displayed on this occasion; both of them, as long as the bad weather  lasted, remained at the helm, and guided the boats. One Thomas, steersman,  and one Lange, the boatswain's mate, also shewed great courage, and all the  experience of old seamen. These two boats, reached the _Echo_ corvette, on  the 9th, at 10 o'clock in the evening, which had been at anchor for some  days, in the road of St. Louis. A council was held, and the most prompt and  certain measures adopted to assist those who were left on board the boats  and the raft.    The Argus brig was appointed for this mission. The commander of this  vessel, burning with eagerness to fly to the assistance of his unfortunate  countrymen, wanted to set sail that very moment; but causes, respecting  which we shall be silent, fettered his zeal; however, this distinguished  officer executed the orders which he received with uncommon activity.    Let us return to the history of the four other boats; and first, that of  the principal, which was the long-boat. As soon as it descried the land, it  tacked and stood out in the open sea; because it was on the shallows, and  it would have been imprudent to pass the night in one metre, or one metre  30 centimetres of water; it had already grounded two or three times. On the  6th, about four o'clock in the morning, finding itself too far from the  coast, and the sea very hollow, it tacked, and in a few hours saw the coast  for the second time. At eight o'clock, they were extremely near, and the  men ardently desiring to get on shore, sixty-three of the most resolute  were landed; arms were given them, and as much biscuit as could be spared;  they set out in search of Senegal, following the sea-coast. This landing  was effected to the North of Cape Meric, eighty or ninety leagues from the  Isle of St. Louis.[B7] This vessel then stood out to sea. We will leave,  for the present, these sixty-three poor people who have been landed on the  sands of Cape Meric; and shall return to them in the sequel.    We will now proceed to describe the motions and fate of the other vessels.  At noon, after having proceeded some miles, the long-boat saw the other  vessels, and endeavoured to fall in with them; but every one distrusted the  other: the long-boat did its utmost to rally them; but they employed all  the means they could to avoid the meeting; even the officers assisted in  working them, because some persons had asserted that the crew of the  long-boat had mutinied, and had even threatened to fire on the other  boats.[33] The long-boat, on the other hand, which had just landed a part  of its people, advanced to inform the other boats that it was able to  relieve them, in case they were too much loaded. The captain's boat and the  _pirogue_, were the only ones that came within hail: at five o'clock in the  afternoon the sea became hollow, and the wind very high, when the pirogue,  unable to hold out against it, asked the assistance of the long-boat, which  tacked and took on board the fifteen persons which that frail boat  contained. At two o'clock in the afternoon, of the 8th,[B8] the men,  tormented by a burning thirst, and a violent hunger which they could not  appease, obliged the officer, by their reiterated importunities, to make  the land, which was done the same evening. His intention was to proceed to  Senegal: he would doubtless have succeeded; but the cries of the soldiers  and sailors, who murmured loudly, induced the measure that was taken, and  the crew landed about forty leagues from the Island of St. Louis. The  great-boat, which had approached very near the coast, and had not been able  to resist the violence of the weather, being besides, destitute of  provisions, had also been obliged to make the land on the 8th: the first,  at five in the afternoon; the second, at eleven in the morning.[B9] The  officers joined their crews, ranged them in order, and proceeded towards  Senegal; but they were in distress, destitute of resources of every kind:  without a guide, on a coast inhabited by barbarians: hunger and thirst  cruelly tormented them; the beams of a scorching sun, reflected from the  immense sandy plains, aggravated their sufferings. In the day, oppressed by  excessive heat, they could scarcely move a step: it was only in the cool of  the morning and the evening, that they could pursue their painful march.  Having, after infinite pains, crossed the downs, they met with vast plains,  where they had the good fortune to find water, by digging holes in the  sand: this refreshing beverage gave them fresh life and hope.    This manner of procuring water is mentioned by many travellers, and  practised in various countries. All along the coasts of Senegambia, and for  some distance in land, they find, by digging in the sand"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1182"],[0,"Dope (#17)"],[1,". Sin. Rita appreciated the fitness of her presence,  and experienced no surprise, only a mild curiosity. This curiosity was  not concerned with Mrs. Sin herself, but with the nature of the burden  which she bore upon her head.    She was dressed in a manner which Rita dreamily thought would have been  inadequate in England, or even in Cuba, but which was appropriate in the  Great Sahara. How exquisitely she carried herself, mused the dreamer;  no doubt this fine carriage was due in part to her wearing golden shoes  with heels like stilts, and in part to her having been trained to bear  heavy burdens upon her head. Rita remembered that Sir Lucien had once  described to her the elegant deportment of the Arab women, ascribing it  to their custom of carrying water-jars in that way.    The appearance of the speck on the horizon had marked the height of her  trance. Her recognition of Mrs. Sin had signalized the decline of the  chandu influence. Now, the intrusion of a definite, uncontorted memory  was evidence of returning cerebral activity.    Rita had no recollection of the sunset; indeed, she had failed to  perceive any change in the form and position of the shadow cast by the  foliage. It had spread, an ebony patch, equally about the bole of the  tree, so that the sun must have been immediately overhead. But, of  course, she had lain watching the parrakeets for several hours, and now  night had fallen. The desert mounds were touched with silver, the sky  was a nest of diamonds, and the moon cast a shadow of the palm like a  bar of ebony right across the prospect to the rim of the sky dome.    Mrs. Sin stood before her, one half of her lithe body concealed by this  strange black shadow and the other half gleaming in the moonlight so  that she resembled a beautiful ivory statue which some iconoclast had  cut in two.    Placing her burden upon the ground, Mrs. Sin knelt down before Rita  and reverently kissed her hand, whispering: \"I am your slave, my poppy  queen.\"    She spoke in a strange language, no doubt some African tongue, but one  which Rita understood perfectly. Then she laid one hand upon the object  which she had carried on her head, and which now proved to be a large  lacquered casket covered with Chinese figures and bound by three hoops  of gold. It had a very curious shape.    \"Do you command that the chest be opened?\" she asked.    \"Yes,\" answered Rita languidly.    Mrs. Sin threw up the lid, and from the interior of the casket which,  because of the glare of the moon light, seemed every moment to assume a  new form, drew out a bronze lamp.    \"The sacred lamp,\" she whispered, and placed it on the sand. \"Do you  command that it be lighted?\"    Rita inclined her head.    The lamp became lighted; in what manner she did not observe, nor was  she curious to learn. Next from the large casket Mrs. Sin took another  smaller casket and a very long, tapering silver bodkin. The first casket  had perceptibly increased in size. It was certainly much larger than  Rita had supposed; for now out from its shadowy interior Mrs. Sin began  to take pipes--long pipes and short pipes, pipes of gold and pipes of  silver, pipes of ivory and pipes of jade. Some were carved to represent  the heads of demons, some had the bodies of serpents wreathed about  them; others were encrusted with precious gems, and filled the night  with the venomous sheen of emeralds, the blood-rays of rubies and golden  glow of topaz, while the spear-points of diamonds flashed a challenge to  the stars.    \"Do you command that the pipes be lighted?\" asked the harsh voice.    Rita desired to answer, \"No,\" but heard herself saying, \"Yes.\"    Thereupon, from a thousand bowls, linking that lonely palm to the remote  horizon, a thousand elfin fires arose--blue-tongued and spirituous. Grey  pencilings of smoke stole straightly upward to the sky, so that look  where she would Rita could discern nothing but these countless thin,  faintly wavering, vertical lines of vapor.    The dimensions of the lacquered casket had increased so vastly as to  conceal the kneeling figure of Mrs. Sin, and staring at it wonderingly,  Rita suddenly perceived that it was not an ordinary casket. She knew at  last why its shape had struck her as being unusual.    It was a Chinese coffin.    The smell of the burning opium was stifling her. Those remorseless  threads of smoke were closing in, twining themselves about her throat.  It was becoming cold, too, and the moonlight was growing dim. The  position of the moon had changed, of course, as the night had stolen on  towards morning, and now it hung dimly before her. The smoke obscured  it.    But was this smoke obscuring the moon? Rita moved her hands for the  first time since she had found herself under the palm tree, weakly  fending off those vaporous tentacles which were seeking to entwine  themselves about her throat. Of course, it was not smoke obscuring the  moon, she decided; it was a lamp, upheld by an ivory figure--a lamp with  a Chinese shade.    A subdued roaring sound became audible; and this was occasioned by the  gas fire, burning behind the Japanese screen on which gaily plumaged  birds sported in the branches of golden palms. Rita raised her hands to  her eyes. Mist obscured her sight. Swiftly, now, reality was asserting  itself and banishing the phantasmagoria conjured up by chandu.    In her dim, cushioned corner Mollie Gretna lay back against the wall,  her face pale and her weak mouth foolishly agape. Cyrus Kilfane was  indistinguishable from the pile of rugs amid which he sprawled by  the table, and of Sir Lucien Pyne nothing was to be seen but the  outstretched legs and feet which projected grotesquely from a recess.  Seated, oriental fashion, upon an improvised divan near the grand piano  and propped up by a number of garish cushions, Rita beheld Mrs. Sin. The  long bamboo pipe had fallen from her listless fingers. Her face wore an  expression of mystic rapture like that characterizing the features of  some Chinese Buddhas.    Fear, unaccountable but uncontrollable, suddenly seized upon Rita. She  felt weak and dizzy, but she struggled partly upright.    \"Lucy!\" she whispered.    Her voice was not under control, and once more she strove to call to  Pyne.    \"Lucy!\" came the hoarse whisper again.    The fire continued its muted roaring, but no other sound answered to  the appeal. A horror of the companionship in which she found herself  thereupon took possession of the girl. She must escape from these  sleepers, whose spirits had been expelled by the potent necromancer,  opium, from these empty tenements whose occupants had fled. The idea of  the cool night air in the open streets was delicious.    She staggered to her feet, swaying drunkenly, but determined to reach  the door. She shuddered, because of a feeling of internal chill which  assailed her, but step by step crept across the room, opened the door,  and tottered out into the hallway. There was no sound in the flat.  Presumably Kilfane's man had retired, or perhaps he, too, was a devotee.    Rita's fur coat hung upon the rack, and although her fingers appeared to  have lost all their strength and her arm to have become weak as that  of an infant, she succeeded in detaching the coat from the hook. Not  pausing to put it on, she opened the door and stumbled out on to the  darkened landing. Whereas her first impulse had been to awaken someone,  preferably Sir Lucien, now her sole desire was to escape undetected.    She began to feel less dizzy, and having paused for a moment on the  landing, she succeeded in getting her coat on. Then she closed the door  as quietly as possible, and clutching the handrail began to grope her  way downstairs. There was only one flight, she remembered, and a short  passage leading to the street door. She reached the passage without  mishap, and saw a faint light ahead.    The fastenings gave her some trouble, but finally her efforts were  successful, and she found herself standing in deserted Duke Street.  There was no moon, but the sky was cloudless. She had no idea of the  time, but because of the stillness of the surrounding streets she knew  that it must be very late. She set out for her flat, walking slowly and  wondering what explanation she should offer if a constable observed her.    Oxford Street showed deserted as far as the eye could reach, and her  light footsteps seemed to awaken a hundred echoes. Having proceeded for  some distance without meeting anyone, she observed--and experienced a  childish alarm--the head-lights of an approaching car. Instantly the  idea of hiding presented itself to her, but so rapidly did the big  automobile speed along the empty thoroughfare that Rita was just passing  a street lamp as the car raced by, and she must therefore have been  clearly visible to the occupants.    Never for a moment glancing aside, Rita pressed on as quickly as she  could. Then her vague alarm became actual terror. She heard the brakes  being applied to the car, and heard the gritty sound of the tires upon  the roadway as the vehicle's headlong progress was suddenly checked. She  had been seen--perhaps recognized, and whoever was in the car proposed  to return to speak to her.    If her strength had allowed she would have run, but now it threatened to  desert her altogether and she tottered weakly. A pattering of footsteps  came from behind. Someone was running back to overtake her. Recognizing  escape to be impossible, Rita turned just as the runner came up with  her.    \"Rita!\" he cried, rather breathlessly. \"Miss Dresden!\"    She stood very still, looking at the speaker.    It was Monte Irvin.        CHAPTER XV. METAMORPHOSIS    As Irvin seized her hands and looked at her eagerly, half-fearfully,  Rita achieved sufficient composure to speak.    \"Oh, Mr. Irvin,\" she said, and found that her voice was not entirely  normal, \"what must you think--\"    He continued to hold her hands, and:    \"I think you"]]]
