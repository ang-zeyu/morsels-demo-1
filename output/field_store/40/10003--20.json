But if you would like to know the song  I shall be only too glad to teach it to you. The words are in Italian,  but I can translate them.\"    \"The words?\" she said absently.    \"The words of the song,\" I said.    \"I do not know what you mean by the words of a song. Do not speak to me  now, Smith.\"    \"Oh, very well,\" said I, thinking it all very strange, and sitting down  I divided my attention between my beautiful hose and Yoletta, still  slowly pacing the floor with that absent look on her face.    At length the curious mood changed, but I did not venture to talk any  more about music, and before very long we repaired to the eating-room,  where, for the next two or three hours, we occupied ourselves very  agreeably with those processes which, some new theorist informs us,  constitute our chief pleasure in life.    That evening I overheard a curious little dialogue. The father of the  house, as I had now grown accustomed to call our head, after rising from  his seat, stood for a few minutes talking near me, while Yoletta, with  her hand on his arm, waited for him to finish. When he had done  speaking, and turned to her, she said in a low voice, which I, however,  overheard: \"Father, I shall lead to-night.\"    He put his hand on her head, and, looking down, studied her upturned  face. \"Ah, my daughter,\" he said with a smile, \"shall I guess what has  inspired you to-day? You have been listening to the passage birds. I  also heard them this morning passing in flocks. And you have been  following them in thought far away into those sun-bright lands where  winter never comes.\"    \"No, father,\" she returned, \"I have only been a little way from home in  thought--only to that spot where the grass has not yet grown to hide the  ashes and loose mold.\" He stooped and kissed her forehead, and then left  the room; and she, never noticing the hungry look with which I witnessed  the tender caress, also went away.    That some person was supposed to lead the singing every evening I knew,  but it was impossible for me ever to discover who the leader was; now,  however, after overhearing this conversation, I knew that on this  particular occasion it would be Yoletta, and in spite of the very poor  opinion she had expressed of my musical abilities, I was prepared to  admire the performance more than I had ever done before.    It commenced in the usual mysterious and indefinable manner; but after  a time, when it began to shape itself into melodies, the idea possessed  me that I was listening to strains once familiar, but long unheard and  forgotten. At length I discovered that this was Campana's music, only  not as I had ever heard it sung; for the melody of _M'appar sulla  tomba_ had been so transmuted and etherealized, as it were, that the  composer himself would have listened in wondering ecstasy to the  mournful strains, which had passed through the alembic of their more  delicately organized minds. Listening, I remembered with an  unaccountable feeling of sadness, that poor Campana had recently died in  London; and almost at the same moment there came to me a remembrance of  my beloved mother, whose early death was my first great grief in  boyhood. All the songs I had ever heard her sing came back to me,  ringing in my mind with a wonderful joy, but ever ending in a strange,  funereal sadness. And not only my mother, but many a dear one besides  returned \"in beauty from the dust\" appeared to be present--white-haired  old men who had spoken treasured words to me in bygone years;  schoolfellows and other boyish friends and companions; and men, too, in  the prime of life, of whose premature death in this or that far-off  region of the world-wide English empire I had heard from time to time.  They came back to me, until the whole room seemed filled with a pale,  shadowy procession, moving past me to the sound of that mysterious  melody. Through all the evening it came back, in a hundred bewildering  disguises, filling me with a melancholy infinitely precious, which was  yet almost more than my heart could bear. Again and yet again that  despairing _Ah-i-me_ fell like a long shuddering sob from the  revolving globes, and from voices far and near, to be taken up and borne  yet further away by far-off, dying sounds, yet again responded to by  nearer, clearer voices, in tones which seemed wrung \"from the depths of  some divine despair\"; then to pass away, but not wholly pass, for all  the hidden cells were stirred, and the vibrating air, like mysterious,  invisible hands, swept the suspended strings, until the exquisite bliss  and pain of it made me tremble and shed tears, as I sat there in the  dark, wondering, as men will wonder at such moments, what this tempest  of the soul which music wakes in us can mean: whether it is merely a  growth of this our earth-life, or a something added, a divine hunger of  the heart which is part of our immortality.              Chapter 11    It seemed to me now that I had never really lived before so sweet was  this new life--so healthy, and free from care and regret. The old life,  which I had lived in cities, was less in my thoughts on each succeeding  day; it came to me now like the memory of a repulsive dream, which I was  only too glad to forget. How I had ever found that listless, worn-out,  luxurious, do-nothing existence endurable, seemed a greater mystery  every morning, when I went forth to my appointed task in the fields or  the workhouse, so natural and so pleasant did it now seem to labor with  my own hands, and to eat my bread in the sweat of my face. If there was  one kind of work I preferred above all others, it was wood-cutting, and  as a great deal of timber was required at this season, I was allowed to  follow my own inclination. In the forest, a couple of miles from the  house, several tough old giants--chiefly oak, chestnut, elm, and  beech--had been marked out for destruction: in some cases because they  had been scorched and riven by lightnings, and were an eyesore; in  others, because time had robbed them of their glory, withering their  long, desolate arms, and bestowing on their crowns that lusterless,  scanty foliage which has a mournful meaning, like the thin white hairs  on the bowed head of a very old man. At this distance from the house I  could freely indulge my propensity for singing, albeit in that coarser  tone which had failed to win favor with my new friends.    Among the grand trees, out of earshot of them all, I could shout aloud  to my heart's content, rejoicing in the boisterous old English ballads,  which, like John Peele's view-hallo,      _\"Might awaken the dead    Or the fox from his lair in the morning.\"_      Meanwhile, with the frantic energy of a Gladstone out of office, I plied  my ax, its echoing strokes making fit accompaniment to my strains, until  for many yards about me the ground was littered with white and yellow  chips; then, exhausted with my efforts, I would sit down to rest and eat  my simple midday fare, to admire myself in my deep-green and chocolate  working-dress, and, above everything, to think and dream of Yoletta.    * * * * *    In my walks to and from the forest I cast many a wistful look at a  solitary flat-topped hill, almost a mountain in height, which stood two  or three miles from the house, north of it, on the other side of the  river. From its summit I felt sure that a very extensive view of the  surrounding country might be had, and I often wished to pay this hill a  visit. One afternoon, while taking my lesson in reading, I mentioned  this desire to Yoletta.    \"Come, then, let us go there now,\" said she, laying the tablets aside.    I joyfully agreed: I had never walked alone with her, nor, in fact, with  her at all, since that first day when she had placed her hand in mine;  and now we were so much nearer in heart to each other.    She led me to a point, half a mile from the house, where the stream  rushed noisily over its stony bed and formed numerous deep channels  between the rocks, and one could cross over by jumping from rock to  rock. Yoletta led the way, leaping airily from stone to stone, while I,  anxious to escape a wetting, followed her with caution; but when I was  safe over, and thought our delightful walk was about to begin, she  suddenly started off towards the hill at a swift pace, which quickly  left me far behind. Finding that I could not overtake her, I shouted to  her to wait for me; then she stood still until I was within three or  four yards Of her, when off she fled like the wind once more. At length  she reached the foot of the hill, and sat down there until I joined her.    \"For goodness sake, Yoletta, let us behave like rational beings and walk  quietly,\" I was beginning, when away she went again, dancing up the  mountain-side with a tireless energy that amazed as well as exasperated  me. \"Wait for me just once more,\" I screamed after her; then, half-way  up the side, she stopped and sat down on a stone.    \"Now my chance has come,\" thought I, ready to make up for insufficient  speed and wind by superior cunning, which would make us equal. \"I will  go quietly up and catch her napping, and hold her fast by the arm until  the walk is finished. So far it has been nothing but a mad chase.\"    Slowly I toiled on, and then, when I got near her and was just about to  execute my plan, she started nimbly away, with a merry laugh, and never  paused again until the summit was reached. Thoroughly tired and beaten,  I sat down to rest; but presently looking up I saw her at the top,  standing motionless on a stone, looking like a statue outlined against  the clear blue sky. Once more I got up and pressed on until I reached  her, and then sank down on the grass, overcome with fatigue.    \"When you ask me to walk again, Yoletta,\" I panted, \"I shall not move  unless I have a rope"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7423"],[0,"Mike (#16)"],[1,"third eleven, as the star, supported by some small change. Mike  pounded it vigorously. To one who had been brought up on Saunders,  Raikes possessed few subtleties. He had made seventeen, and was  thoroughly set, when the Gazeka, who had the bowling, hit one in the  direction of cover-point. With a certain type of batsman a single is a  thing to take big risks for. And the Gazeka badly wanted that single.    \"Come on,\" he shouted, prancing down the pitch.    Mike, who had remained in his crease with the idea that nobody even  moderately sane would attempt a run for a hit like that, moved forward  in a startled and irresolute manner. Firby-Smith arrived, shouting  \"Run!\" and, cover having thrown the ball in, the wicket-keeper removed  the bails.    These are solemn moments.    The only possible way of smoothing over an episode of this kind is for  the guilty man to grovel.    Firby-Smith did not grovel.    \"Easy run there, you know,\" he said reprovingly.    The world swam before Mike's eyes. Through the red mist he could see  Firby-Smith's face. The sun glinted on his rather prominent teeth. To  Mike's distorted vision it seemed that the criminal was amused.    \"Don't _laugh_, you grinning ape!\" he cried. \"It isn't funny.\"    [Illustration: \"DON'T _LAUGH_, YOU GRINNING APE\"]    He then made for the trees where the rest of the team were sitting.    Now Firby-Smith not only possessed rather prominent teeth; he was also  sensitive on the subject. Mike's shaft sank in deeply. The fact that  emotion caused him to swipe at a straight half-volley, miss it, and be  bowled next ball made the wound rankle.    He avoided Mike on his return to the trees. And Mike, feeling now a  little apprehensive, avoided him.    The Gazeka brooded apart for the rest of the afternoon, chewing the  insult. At close of play he sought Burgess.    Burgess, besides being captain of the eleven, was also head of the  school. He was the man who arranged prefects' meetings. And only a  prefects' meeting, thought Firby-Smith, could adequately avenge his  lacerated dignity.    \"I want to speak to you, Burgess,\" he said.    \"What's up?\" said Burgess.    \"You know young Jackson in our house.\"    \"What about him?\"    \"He's been frightfully insolent.\"    \"Cheeked you?\" said Burgess, a man of simple speech.    \"I want you to call a prefects' meeting, and lick him.\"    Burgess looked incredulous.    \"Rather a large order, a prefects' meeting,\" he said. \"It has to be a  pretty serious sort of thing for that.\"    \"Frightful cheek to a school prefect is a serious thing,\" said  Firby-Smith, with the air of one uttering an epigram.    \"Well, I suppose--What did he say to you?\"    Firby-Smith related the painful details.    Burgess started to laugh, but turned the laugh into a cough.    \"Yes,\" he said meditatively. \"Rather thick. Still, I mean--A prefects'  meeting. Rather like crushing a thingummy with a what-d'you-call-it.  Besides, he's a decent kid.\"    \"He's frightfully conceited.\"    \"Oh, well--Well, anyhow, look here, I'll think it over, and let you  know to-morrow. It's not the sort of thing to rush through without  thinking about it.\"    And the matter was left temporarily at that.          CHAPTER XV    MIKE CREATES A VACANCY      Burgess walked off the ground feeling that fate was not using him  well.    Here was he, a well-meaning youth who wanted to be on good terms with  all the world, being jockeyed into slaughtering a kid whose batting he  admired and whom personally he liked. And the worst of it was that he  sympathised with Mike. He knew what it felt like to be run out just  when one had got set, and he knew exactly how maddening the Gazeka's  manner would be on such an occasion. On the other hand, officially he  was bound to support the head of Wain's. Prefects must stand together  or chaos will come.    He thought he would talk it over with somebody. Bob occurred to him.  It was only fair that Bob should be told, as the nearest of kin.    And here was another grievance against fate. Bob was a person he did  not particularly wish to see just then. For that morning he had posted  up the list of the team to play for the school against Geddington, one  of the four schools which Wrykyn met at cricket; and Bob's name did  not appear on that list. Several things had contributed to that  melancholy omission. In the first place, Geddington, to judge from the  weekly reports in the _Sportsman_ and _Field_, were strong this  year at batting. In the second place, the results of the last few  matches, and particularly the M.C.C. match, had given Burgess the  idea that Wrykyn was weak at bowling. It became necessary, therefore,  to drop a batsman out of the team in favour of a bowler. And either  Mike or Bob must be the man.    Burgess was as rigidly conscientious as the captain of a school eleven  should be. Bob was one of his best friends, and he would have given  much to be able to put him in the team; but he thought the thing over,  and put the temptation sturdily behind him. At batting there was not  much to choose between the two, but in fielding there was a great deal.  Mike was good. Bob was bad. So out Bob had gone, and Neville-Smith, a  fair fast bowler at all times and on his day dangerous, took his place.    These clashings of public duty with private inclination are the  drawbacks to the despotic position of captain of cricket at a public  school. It is awkward having to meet your best friend after you have  dropped him from the team, and it is difficult to talk to him as if  nothing had happened.    Burgess felt very self-conscious as he entered Bob's study, and was  rather glad that he had a topic of conversation ready to hand.    \"Busy, Bob?\" he asked.    \"Hullo,\" said Bob, with a cheerfulness rather over-done in his anxiety  to show Burgess, the man, that he did not hold him responsible in  any way for the distressing acts of Burgess, the captain. \"Take a  pew. Don't these studies get beastly hot this weather. There's some  ginger-beer in the cupboard. Have some?\"    \"No, thanks. I say, Bob, look here, I want to see you.\"    \"Well, you can, can't you? This is me, sitting over here. The tall,  dark, handsome chap.\"    \"It's awfully awkward, you know,\" continued Burgess gloomily; \"that  ass of a young brother of yours--Sorry, but he _is_ an ass,  though he's your brother----\"    \"Thanks for the 'though,' Billy. You know how to put a thing nicely.  What's Mike been up to?\"    \"It's that old fool the Gazeka. He came to me frothing with rage, and  wanted me to call a prefects' meeting and touch young Mike up.\"    Bob displayed interest and excitement for the first time.    \"Prefects' meeting! What the dickens is up? What's he been doing?  Smith must be drunk. What's all the row about?\"    Burgess repeated the main facts of the case as he had them from  Firby-Smith.    \"Personally, I sympathise with the kid,\" he added, \"Still, the Gazeka  _is_ a prefect----\"    Bob gnawed a pen-holder morosely.    \"Silly young idiot,\" he said.    \"Sickening thing being run out,\" suggested Burgess.    \"Still----\"    \"I know. It's rather hard to see what to do. I suppose if the Gazeka  insists, one's bound to support him.\"    \"I suppose so.\"    \"Awful rot. Prefects' lickings aren't meant for that sort of thing.  They're supposed to be for kids who steal buns at the shop or muck  about generally. Not for a chap who curses a fellow who runs him out.  I tell you what, there's just a chance Firby-Smith won't press the  thing. He hadn't had time to get over it when he saw me. By now he'll  have simmered down a bit. Look here, you're a pal of his, aren't you?  Well, go and ask him to drop the business. Say you'll curse your  brother and make him apologise, and that I'll kick him out of the team  for the Geddington match.\"    It was a difficult moment for Bob. One cannot help one's thoughts, and  for an instant the idea of going to Geddington with the team, as he  would certainly do if Mike did not play, made him waver. But he  recovered himself.    \"Don't do that,\" he said. \"I don't see there's a need for anything of  that sort. You must play the best side you've got. I can easily talk  the old Gazeka over. He gets all right in a second if he's treated the  right way. I'll go and do it now.\"    Burgess looked miserable.    \"I say, Bob,\" he said.    \"Yes?\"    \"Oh, nothing--I mean, you're not a bad sort.\" With which glowing  eulogy he dashed out of the room, thanking his stars that he had won  through a confoundedly awkward business.    Bob went across to Wain's to interview and soothe Firby-Smith.    He found that outraged hero sitting moodily in his study like Achilles  in his tent.    Seeing Bob, he became all animation.    \"Look here,\" he said, \"I wanted to see you. You know, that frightful  young brother of yours----\"    \"I know, I know,\" said Bob. \"Burgess was telling me. He wants  kicking.\"    \"He wants a frightful licking from the prefects,\" emended the  aggrieved party.    \"Well, I don't know, you know. Not much good lugging the prefects into  it, is there? I mean, apart from everything else, not much of a catch  for me, would it be, having to sit there and look on. I'm a prefect,  too, you know.\"    Firby-Smith looked a little blank at this. He had a great admiration  for Bob.    \"I didn't think of you,\" he said.    \"I thought you hadn't,\" said Bob. \"You see it now, though, don't you?\"    Firby-Smith returned to the original grievance.    \"Well, you know, it was frightful cheek.\"    \"Of course it was. Still, I think if I saw him and cursed him, and  sent him up to you to apologise--How would that do?\"    \"All right. After all, I did run him out.\"    \"Yes, there's that, of course. Mike's all right, really. It isn't as  if he did that sort of thing as a habit.\"    \"No. All right then.\"    \"Thanks,\" said Bob, and went to find Mike.           *       *       *       *       *    The lecture on deportment which he read that future All-England  batsman in a"]]]
