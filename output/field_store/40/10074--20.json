It was like the blare of bugles in a  dubious cause; one's blood responded before one's brain; and but for  Raffles, little as his friends were to me, and much as I repudiated his  sacrifices on their behalf, that very minute I might have led the first  assault on their oppressor. In a sudden fury the savage had hurled his  empty tumbler into the fireplace, and followed the crash with such a  volley of abuse as I have seldom heard from human brute.    \"I'm surprised at you, Mr. Levy,\" said Raffles, contemptuously; \"if we  copied your tactics we should throw you through that open window!\"    And I stood by for my share in the deed.    \"Yes! I know it'd pay you to break my neck,\" retorted Levy. \"You'd rather  swing than do time, wouldn't you?\"    \"And you prefer the other alternative,\" said Raffles, \"to loosing your  grip upon a man who's done you no harm whatever! In interest alone he's  almost repaid all you lent him in the first instance; you've first-class  security for the rest; yet you must ruin him to revenge yourself upon us.  On us, mark you! It's against us you've got your grievance, not against  old Garland or his son. You've lost sight of that fact. That little trick  this morning was our doing entirely. Why don't you take it out of us? Why  refuse a fair offer to spite people who have done you no harm?\"    \"It's not a fair offer,\" growled Levy. \"I made you the fair offer.\"    But his rage had moderated; he was beginning to listen to Raffles and to  reason, with however ill a grace. It was the very moment which Raffles  was the very man to improve.    \"Mr. Levy,\" said he, \"do you suppose I care whether you hold your tongue  or not on a matter of mere suspicion, which you can't support by a grain  of evidence? You lose a piece of jewellery abroad; you recover it intact;  and after many days you get the bright idea that I'm the culprit because  I happen to have been staying in your hotel at the time. It never  occurred to you there or then, though you interviewed the gentleman face  to face, as you were constantly interviewing me. But as soon as I borrow  some money from you, here in London in the ordinary way, you say I must  be the man who borrowed Mrs. Levy's necklace in that extraordinary way at  Carlsbad! I should say it to the marines, Mr. Levy, if I were you;  they're the only force that are likely to listen to you.\"    \"I do say it, all the same; and what's more you don't deny it. If you  weren't the man you wouldn't be so ready for another game like it now.\"    \"Ready for it?\" cried Raffles, more than ready for an undeniable point.  \"I'm always your man for a new sensation, Mr. Levy, and for years I've  taken an academic interest in the very fine art of burglary; isn't that  so, Bunny?\"    \"I've often heard you say so,\" I replied without mishap.    \"In these piping times,\" continued Raffles, \"it's about the one exciting  and romantic career open to us. If it were not so infernally dishonest I  should have half a mind to follow it myself. And here you come and put  up a crib for me to crack in the best interests of equity and justice;  not to enrich the wicked cracksman, but to restore his rightful property  to the honest financier; a sort of teetotal felony--the very ginger-ale  of crime! Is that a beverage to refuse--a chance to miss--a temptation to  resist? Yet the risks are just as great as if it were a fine old fruity  felony; you can't expect me to run them for nothing, or even for their  own exciting sake. You know my terms, Mr. Levy; if you don't accept them,  it's already two in the morning, and I should like to get to bed before  it's light.\"    \"And if I did accept them?\" said Levy, after a considerable pause.    \"The letter to which you attach such importance would most probably be in  your possession by the beginning of next week.\"    \"And I should have to take my hands off a nice little property that has  tumbled into them?\"    \"Only for a time,\" said Raffles. \"On the other hand, you would be  permanently out of danger of figuring in the dock on a charge of  blackmail. And you know your profession isn't popular in the courts, Mr.  Levy; it's in nearly as bad odour as the crime of blackmail!\"    A singular docility had descended like a mantle upon Daniel Levy: no  uncommon reaction in the case of very passionate men, and yet in this  case ominous, sinister, and completely unconvincing so far as I  personally was concerned. I longed to tell Raffles what I thought, to put  him on his guard against his obvious superior in low cunning. But Raffles  would not even catch my eye. And already he looked insanely pleased with  himself and his apparent advantage.    \"Will you give me until to-morrow morning?\" said Levy, taking up his hat.    \"If you mean the morning; by eleven I must be at Lord's.\"    \"Say ten o'clock in Jermyn Street?\"    \"It's a strange bargain, Mr. Levy. I should prefer to clinch it out of  earshot of your clerks.\"    \"Then I will come here.\"    \"I shall be ready for you at ten.\"    \"And alone?\"    There was a sidelong glance at me with the proviso.    \"You shall search the premises yourself and seal up all the doors.\"    \"Meanwhile,\" said Levy, putting on his hat, \"I shall think about it, but  that's all. I haven't agreed yet, Mr. Raffles; don't you make too sure  that I ever shall. I shall think about it--but don't you make too sure.\"    He was gone like a lamb, this wild beast of five minutes back. Raffles  showed him out, and down into the courtyard, and out again into  Piccadilly. There was no question but that he was gone for good; back  came Raffles, rubbing his hands for joy.    \"A fine night, Bunny! A finer day to follow! But a nice, slow,  wicket-keeper's wicket if ever Teddy had one in his life!\"    I came to my point with all vehemence.    \"Confound Teddy!\" I cried from my heart. \"I should have thought you had  run risks enough for his sake as it was!\"    \"How do you know it's for his sake--or anybody's?\" asked Raffles, quite  hotly. \"Do you suppose I want to be beaten by a brute like Levy, Garlands  or no Garlands? Besides, there's far less risk in what I mean to do than  in what I've been doing; at all events it's in my line.\"    \"It's not in your line,\" I retorted, \"to strike a bargain with a swine  who won't dream of keeping his side.\"    \"I shall make him,\" said Raffles. \"If he won't do what I want he shan't  have what he wants.\"    \"But how could you trust him to keep his word?\"    \"His word!\" cried Raffles, in ironical echo. \"We shall have to carry  matters far beyond his word, of course; deeds, not words, Bunny, and the  deeds properly prepared by solicitors and executed by Dan Levy before he  lays a finger on his own blackmailing letter. You remember old Mother  Hubbard in our house at school? He's a little solicitor somewhere in the  City; he'll throw the whole thing into legal shape for us, and ask no  questions and tell no tales. You leave Mr. Shylock to me and Mother, and  we'll bring him up to the scratch as he ought to go.\"    There was no arguing with Raffles in such a mood; argue I did, but he  paid no attention to what I said. He had unlocked a drawer in the bureau,  and taken out a map that I had never seen before. I looked over his  shoulder as he spread it out in the light of his reading-lamp. And it was  a map of London capriciously sprinkled with wheels and asterisks of red  ink; there was a finished wheel in Bond Street, another in Half-Moon  Street, one on the site of Thornaby House, Park Lane, and others as  remote as St. John's Wood and Peter Street, Campden Hill; the asterisks  were fewer, and I have less reason to remember their latitude and  longitude.    \"What's this, A.J.?\" I asked. \"It looks exactly like a war-map.\"    \"It is one, Bunny,\" said he; \"it's the map of one man's war against the  ordered forces of society. The spokes are only the scenes of future  operations, but each finished wheel marks the field of some past  engagement, in which you have usually been the one man's one and only  accomplice.\"    And he stooped and drew the neatest of blood-red asterisks at the  southern extremity of Gray's Inn Square.          CHAPTER X    \"My Raffles Right or Wrong\"      The historic sward had just been cleared for action when Raffles and I  met at Lord's next day. I blush to own I had been knave and fool enough  to suggest that he should smuggle me into the pavilion; but perhaps the  only laws of man that Raffles really respected were those of the M.C.C.,  and it was in Block B. that he joined me a minute or so before eleven.  The sun was as strong and the sky as blue as though the disastrous day  before had been just such another. But its tropical shower-bath had left  the London air as cleanly and as clear as crystal; the neutral tints of  every day were splashes of vivid colour, the waiting umpires animated  snow-men, the heap of sawdust at either end a pyramid of powdered gold  upon an emerald ground. And in the expectant hush before the appearance  of the fielding side, I still recall the Yorkshire accent of the Surrey  Poet, hawking his latest lyric on some \"Great Stand by Mr. Webbe and Mr.  Stoddart,\" and incidentally assuring the crowd that Cambridge was going  to win because everybody said Oxford would.    \"Just"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9845"],[0,"The Spy (#16)"],[1,"seen, notwithstanding the distance. Her  color changed, and for an instant, as she saw the youth throw himself  from the saddle, she was compelled to seek relief for her trembling  limbs in a chair.    The officer gave a few hasty orders to his second in command, walked  rapidly into the lawn, and approached the cottage. Frances rose from her  seat, and vanished from the apartment. The dragoon ascended the steps of  the piazza, and had barely time to touch the outer door, when it opened  to his admission.    The youth of Frances, when she left the city, had prevented her  sacrificing, in conformity to the customs of that day, all her native  beauties on the altar of fashion. Her hair, which was of a golden  richness of color, was left, untortured, to fall in the natural ringlets  of infancy, and it shaded a face which was glowing with the united  charms of health, youth, and artlessness; her eyes spoke volumes, but  her tongue was silent; her hands were interlocked before her, and, aided  by her taper form, bending forward in an attitude of expectation, gave a  loveliness and an interest to her appearance, that for a moment chained  her lover in silence to the spot.    Frances silently led the way into a vacant parlor, opposite to the one  in which the family were assembled, and turning to the soldier frankly,  placing both her hands in his own, exclaimed,--    \"Ah, Dunwoodie! how happy, on many accounts, I am to see you! I have  brought you in here, to prepare you to meet an unexpected friend in the  opposite room.\"    \"To whatever cause it may be owing,\" cried the youth, pressing her hands  to his lips, \"I, too, am happy in being able to see you alone. Frances,  the probation you have decreed is cruel; war and distance may separate  us forever.\"    \"We must submit to the necessity which governs us. But it is not love  speeches I would hear now; I have other and more important matter for  your attention.\"    \"What can be of more importance than to make you mine by a tie that will  be indissoluble! Frances, you are cold to me--me--from whose mind, days  of service and nights of alarm have never been able to banish your image  for a single moment.\"    \"Dear Dunwoodie,\" said Frances, softening nearly to tears, and again  extending her hand to him, as the richness of her color gradually  returned, \"you know my sentiments--this war once ended, and you may  take that hand forever--but I can never consent to tie myself to you by  any closer union than already exists, so long as you are arrayed in arms  against my only brother. Even now, that brother is awaiting your  decision to restore him to liberty, or to conduct him to a  probable death.\"    \"Your brother!\" cried Dunwoodie, starting and turning pale; \"your  brother! explain yourself--what dreadful meaning is concealed in  your words?\"    \"Has not Captain Lawton told you of the arrest of Henry by himself this  very morning?\" continued Frances, in a voice barely audible, and fixing  on her lover a look of the deepest concern.    \"He told me of arresting a captain of the 60th in disguise, but without  mentioning where or whom,\" replied the major in a similar tone; and  dropping his head between his hands, he endeavored to conceal his  feelings from his companion.    \"Dunwoodie! Dunwoodie!\" exclaimed Frances, losing all her former  confidence in the most fearful apprehensions, \"what means this  agitation?\" As the major slowly raised his face, in which was pictured  the most expressive concern, she continued, \"Surely, surely, you will  not betray your friend--my brother--your brother--to an  ignominious death.\"    \"Frances!\" exclaimed the young man in agony, \"what can I do?\"    \"Do!\" she repeated, gazing at him wildly. \"Would Major Dunwoodie yield  his friend to his enemies--the brother of his betrothed wife?\"    \"Oh, speak not so unkindly to me, dearest Miss Wharton--my own  Frances. I would this moment die for you--for Henry--but I cannot forget  my duty--cannot forfeit my honor; you yourself would be the first to  despise me if I did.\"    \"Peyton Dunwoodie!\" said Frances, solemnly, and with a face of ashy  paleness, \"you have told me--you have sworn, that you love me----\"    \"I do,\" interrupted the soldier, with fervor; but motioning for silence  she continued, in a voice that trembled with her fears,--    \"Do you think I can throw myself into the arms of a man whose hands are  stained with the blood of my only brother!\"    \"Frances, you wring my very heart!\" Then pausing, to struggle with his  feelings, he endeavored to force a smile, as he added, \"But, after all,  we may be torturing ourselves with unnecessary fears, and Henry, when I  know the circumstances, may be nothing more than a prisoner of war; in  which case, I can liberate him on parole.\"    There is no more delusive passion than hope; and it seems to be the  happy privilege of youth to cull all the pleasures that can be gathered  from its indulgence. It is when we are most worthy of confidence  ourselves, that we are least apt to distrust others; and what we think  ought to be, we are prone to think will be.    The half-formed expectations of the young soldier were communicated to  the desponding sister, more by the eye than the voice, and the blood  rushed again to her cheek, as she cried,--    \"Oh, there can be no just grounds to doubt it. I know--I  knew--Dunwoodie, you would never desert us in the hour of our greatest  need!\" The violence of her feelings prevailed, and the agitated girl  found relief in a flood of tears.    The office of consoling those we love is one of the dearest prerogatives  of affection; and Major Dunwoodie, although but little encouraged by his  own momentary suggestion of relief, could not undeceive the lovely girl,  who leaned on his shoulder, as he wiped the traces of her feeling from  her face, with a trembling, but reviving confidence in the safety of her  brother, and the protection of her lover.    Frances, having sufficiently recovered her recollection to command  herself, now eagerly led the way to the opposite room, to communicate to  her family the pleasing intelligence which she already conceived  so certain,    Dunwoodie followed her reluctantly, and with forebodings of the result;  but a few moments brought him into the presence of his relatives, and he  summoned all his resolution to meet the trial with firmness.    The salutations of the young men were cordial and frank, and, on the  part of Henry Wharton, as collected as if nothing had occurred to  disturb his self-possession.    The abhorrence of being, in any manner, auxiliary to the arrest of his  friend; the danger to the life of Captain Wharton; and the  heart-breaking declarations of Frances, had, however, created an  uneasiness in the bosom of Major Dunwoodie, which all his efforts could  not conceal. His reception by the rest of the family was kind and  sincere, both from old regard, and a remembrance of former obligations,  heightened by the anticipations they could not fail to read in the  expressive eyes of the blushing girl by his side. After exchanging  greetings with every member of the family, Major Dunwoodie beckoned to  the sentinel, whom the wary prudence of Captain Lawton had left in  charge of the prisoner, to leave the room. Turning to Captain Wharton,  he inquired mildly,--    \"Tell me, Henry, the circumstances of this disguise, in which Captain  Lawton reports you to have been found, and remember--remember--Captain  Wharton--your answers are entirely voluntary.\"    \"The disguise was used by me, Major Dunwoodie,\" replied the English  officer, gravely, \"to enable me to visit my friends, without incurring  the danger of becoming a prisoner of war.\"    \"But you did not wear it, until you saw the troop of Lawton  approaching?\"    \"Oh! no,\" interrupted Frances, eagerly, forgetting all the circumstances  in her anxiety for her brother. \"Sarah and myself placed them on him  when the dragoons appeared; and it was our awkwardness that has led to  the discovery.\"    The countenance of Dunwoodie brightened, as turning his eyes in fondness  on the speaker, he listened to her explanation.    \"Probably some articles of your own,\" he continued, \"which were at hand,  and were used on the spur of the moment.\"    \"No,\" said Wharton, with dignity, \"the clothes were worn by me from the  city; they were procured for the purpose to which they were applied, and  I intended to use them in my return this very day.\"    The appalled Frances shrank back from between her brother and lover,  where her ardent feelings had carried her, as the whole truth glanced  over her mind, and she sank into a seat, gazing wildly on the young men.    \"But the pickets--the party at the Plains?\" added Dunwoodie, turning  pale.    \"I passed them, too, in disguise. I made use of this pass, for which I  paid; and, as it bears the name of Washington, I presume it is forged.\"    Dunwoodie caught the paper from his hand, eagerly, and stood gazing on  the signature for some time in silence, during which the soldier  gradually prevailed over the man; when he turned to the prisoner, with a  searching look, as he asked,--    \"Captain Wharton, whence did you procure this paper?\"    \"This is a question, I conceive, Major Dunwoodie has no right to ask.\"    \"Your pardon, sir; my feelings may have led me into an impropriety.\"    Mr. Wharton, who had been a deeply interested auditor, now so far  conquered his feelings as to say, \"Surely, Major Dunwoodie, the paper  cannot be material; such artifices are used daily in war.\"    \"This name is no counterfeit,\" said the dragoon, studying the  characters, and speaking in a low voice; \"is treason yet among us  undiscovered? The confidence of Washington has been abused, for the  fictitious name is in a different hand from the pass. Captain Wharton,  my duty will not suffer me to grant you a parole; you must accompany me  to the Highlands.\"    \"I did not expect otherwise, Major Dunwoodie.\""]]]
