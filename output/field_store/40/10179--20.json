[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1268"],[0,"The Mysterious Island (#17)"],[1,"some places the sulphur had formed crystals among other substances, such  as whitish cinders made of an infinity of little feldspar crystals.    In approaching the first plateau formed by the truncating of the lower  cone, the difficulties of the ascent were very great. Towards four  o'clock the extreme zone of the trees had been passed. There only  remained here and there a few twisted, stunted pines, which must have  had a hard life in resisting at this altitude the high winds from the  open sea. Happily for the engineer and his companions the weather was  beautiful, the atmosphere tranquil; for a high breeze at an elevation of  three thousand feet would have hindered their proceedings. The purity  of the sky at the zenith was felt through the transparent air. A perfect  calm reigned around them. They could not see the sun, then hid by the  vast screen of the upper cone, which masked the half-horizon of the  west, and whose enormous shadow stretching to the shore increased as  the radiant luminary sank in its diurnal course. Vapor--mist rather than  clouds--began to appear in the east, and assume all the prismatic colors  under the influence of the solar rays.    Five hundred feet only separated the explorers from the plateau, which  they wished to reach so as to establish there an encampment for the  night, but these five hundred feet were increased to more than two miles  by the zigzags which they had to describe. The soil, as it were, slid  under their feet.    The slope often presented such an angle that they slipped when the  stones worn by the air did not give a sufficient support. Evening  came on by degrees, and it was almost night when Cyrus Harding and his  companions, much fatigued by an ascent of seven hours, arrived at  the plateau of the first cone. It was then necessary to prepare an  encampment, and to restore their strength by eating first and sleeping  afterwards. This second stage of the mountain rose on a base of rocks,  among which it would be easy to find a retreat. Fuel was not abundant.  However, a fire could be made by means of the moss and dry brushwood,  which covered certain parts of the plateau. While the sailor was  preparing his hearth with stones which he put to this use, Neb and  Herbert occupied themselves with getting a supply of fuel. They soon  returned with a load of brushwood. The steel was struck, the burnt linen  caught the sparks of flint, and, under Neb's breath, a crackling fire  showed itself in a few minutes under the shelter of the rocks. Their  object in lighting a fire was only to enable them to withstand the cold  temperature of the night, as it was not employed in cooking the bird,  which Neb kept for the next day. The remains of the capybara and  some dozens of the stone-pine almonds formed their supper. It was not  half-past six when all was finished.    Cyrus Harding then thought of exploring in the half-light the large  circular layer which supported the upper cone of the mountain. Before  taking any rest, he wished to know if it was possible to get round the  base of the cone in the case of its sides being too steep and its summit  being inaccessible. This question preoccupied him, for it was possible  that from the way the hat inclined, that is to say, towards the north,  the plateau was not practicable. Also, if the summit of the mountain  could not be reached on one side, and if, on the other, they could not  get round the base of the cone, it would be impossible to survey the  western part of the country, and their object in making the ascent would  in part be altogether unattained.    The engineer, accordingly, regardless of fatigue, leaving Pencroft and  Neb to arrange the beds, and Gideon Spilett to note the incidents of the  day, began to follow the edge of the plateau, going towards the north.  Herbert accompanied him.    The night was beautiful and still, the darkness was not yet deep. Cyrus  Harding and the boy walked near each other, without speaking. In  some places the plateau opened before them, and they passed without  hindrance. In others, obstructed by rocks, there was only a narrow path,  in which two persons could not walk abreast. After a walk of twenty  minutes, Cyrus Harding and Herbert were obliged to stop. From this point  the slope of the two cones became one. No shoulder here separated the  two parts of the mountain. The slope, being inclined almost seventy  degrees, the path became impracticable.    But if the engineer and the boy were obliged to give up thoughts of  following a circular direction, in return an opportunity was given for  ascending the cone.    In fact, before them opened a deep hollow. It was the rugged mouth  of the crater, by which the eruptive liquid matter had escaped at  the periods when the volcano was still in activity. Hardened lava and  crusted scoria formed a sort of natural staircase of large steps, which  would greatly facilitate the ascent to the summit of the mountain.    Harding took all this in at a glance, and without hesitating, followed  by the lad, he entered the enormous chasm in the midst of an increasing  obscurity.    There was still a height of a thousand feet to overcome. Would the  interior acclivities of the crater be practicable? It would soon be  seen. The persevering engineer resolved to continue his ascent until  he was stopped. Happily these acclivities wound up the interior of the  volcano and favored their ascent.    As to the volcano itself, it could not be doubted that it was completely  extinct. No smoke escaped from its sides; not a flame could be seen in  the dark hollows; not a roar, not a mutter, no trembling even issued  from this black well, which perhaps reached far into the bowels of the  earth. The atmosphere inside the crater was filled with no sulphurous  vapor. It was more than the sleep of a volcano; it was its complete  extinction. Cyrus Harding's attempt would succeed.    Little by little, Herbert and he climbing up the sides of the interior,  saw the crater widen above their heads. The radius of this circular  portion of the sky, framed by the edge of the cone, increased obviously.  At each step, as it were, that the explorers made, fresh stars entered  the field of their vision. The magnificent constellations of the  southern sky shone resplendently. At the zenith glittered the splendid  Antares in the Scorpion, and not far was Alpha Centauri, which is  believed to be the nearest star to the terrestrial globe. Then, as the  crater widened, appeared Fomalhaut of the Fish, the Southern Triangle,  and lastly, nearly at the Antarctic Pole, the glittering Southern Cross,  which replaces the Polar Star of the Northern Hemisphere.    It was nearly eight o'clock when Cyrus Harding and Herbert set foot on  the highest ridge of the mountain at the summit of the cone.    It was then perfectly dark, and their gaze could not extend over a  radius of two miles. Did the sea surround this unknown land, or was it  connected in the west with some continent of the Pacific? It could not  yet be made out. Towards the west, a cloudy belt, clearly visible at the  horizon, increased the gloom, and the eye could not discover if the sky  and water were blended together in the same circular line.    But at one point of the horizon a vague light suddenly appeared, which  descended slowly in proportion as the cloud mounted to the zenith.    It was the slender crescent moon, already almost disappearing; but its  light was sufficient to show clearly the horizontal line, then detached  from the cloud, and the engineer could see its reflection trembling for  an instant on a liquid surface. Cyrus Harding seized the lad's hand, and  in a grave voice,--    \"An island!\" said he, at the moment when the lunar crescent disappeared  beneath the waves.        Chapter 11    Half an hour later Cyrus Harding and Herbert had returned to the  encampment. The engineer merely told his companions that the land upon  which fate had thrown them was an island, and that the next day they  would consult. Then each settled himself as well as he could to sleep,  and in that rocky hole, at a height of two thousand five hundred feet  above the level of the sea, through a peaceful night, the islanders  enjoyed profound repose.    The next day, the 30th of March, after a hasty breakfast, which  consisted solely of the roasted tragopan, the engineer wished to climb  again to the summit of the volcano, so as more attentively to survey  the island upon which he and his companions were imprisoned for life  perhaps, should the island be situated at a great distance from any  land, or if it was out of the course of vessels which visited the  archipelagoes of the Pacific Ocean. This time his companions followed  him in the new exploration. They also wished to see the island, on the  productions of which they must depend for the supply of all their wants.    It was about seven o'clock in the morning when Cyrus Harding, Herbert,  Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Neb quitted the encampment. No one  appeared to be anxious about their situation. They had faith in  themselves, doubtless, but it must be observed that the basis of this  faith was not the same with Harding as with his companions. The engineer  had confidence, because he felt capable of extorting from this wild  country everything necessary for the life of himself and his companions;  the latter feared nothing, just because Cyrus Harding was with them.  Pencroft especially, since the incident of the relighted fire, would  not have despaired for an instant, even if he was on a bare rock, if the  engineer was with him on the rock.    \"Pshaw,\" said he, \"we left Richmond without permission from the  authorities! It will be hard if we don't manage to get away some day or  other from a place where certainly no one will detain us!\"    Cyrus Harding followed the same road as the evening before. They went  round the cone by the plateau which formed the shoulder, to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12680"],[0,"Children of the Ghetto: A Study of a Peculiar People (#17)"],[1," low public houses and common lodging  houses, where rowdy disciples of the Prince of Peace often sent him  bleeding to bed, or shamelessly despoiled him of his merchandise, or  bullied and blustered him out of his fair price, knowing he dared not  resent. It meant being chaffed and gibed at in language of which he  only understood that it was cruel, though certain trite facetiae grew  intelligible to him by repetition. Thus once, when he had been  interrogated as to the locality of Moses when the light went out, he  replied in Yiddish that the light could not go out, for \"it stands in  the verse, that round the head of Moses, our teacher, the great  law-giver, was a perpetual halo.\" An old German happened to be smoking  at the bar of the public house when the peddler gave his acute answer;  he laughed heartily, slapped the Jew on the back and translated the  repartee to the Convivial crew. For once intellect told, and the rough  drinkers, with a pang of shame, vied with one another in pressing bitter  beer upon the temperate Semite. But, as a rule, Moses Ansell drank the  cup of affliction instead of hospitality and bore his share to the full,  without the remotest intention of being heroic, in the long agony of his  race, doomed to be a byword and a mockery amongst the heathen.  Assuredly, to die for a religion is easier than to live for it. Yet  Moses never complained nor lost faith. To be spat upon was the very  condition of existence of the modern Jew, deprived of Palestine and his  Temple, a footsore mendicant, buffeted and reviled, yet the dearer to  the Lord God who had chosen him from the nations. Bullies might break  Moses's head in this world, but in the next he would sit on a gold chair  in Paradise among the saints and sing exegetical acrostics to all  eternity. It was some dim perception of these things that made Esther  forgive her father when the Ansells waited weeks and weeks for a postal  order and landlords were threatening to bundle them out neck and crop,  and her mother's hands were worn to the bone slaving for her little  ones.    Things improved a little just before the mother died, for they had  settled down in London and Moses earned eighteen shillings a week as a  machinist and presser, and no longer roamed the country. But the  interval of happiness was brief. The grandmother, imported from Poland,  did not take kindly to her son's wife, whom she found wanting in the  minutiae of ceremonial piety and godless enough to wear her own hair.  There had been, indeed, a note of scepticism, of defiance, in Esther's  mother, a hankering after the customs of the heathen, which her  grandmother divined instinctively and resented for the sake of her son  and the post-mundane existence of her grandchildren. Mrs. Ansell's  scepticism based itself upon the uncleanliness which was so generally  next to godliness in the pious circles round them, and she had been  heard to express contempt for the learned and venerable Israelite, who,  being accosted by an acquaintance when the shadows of eve were beginning  to usher in the Day of Atonement, exclaimed:    \"For heaven's sake, don't stop me--I missed my bath last year.\"    Mrs. Ansell bathed her children from head to foot once a month, and even  profanely washed them on the Sabbath, and had other strange, uncanny  notions. She professed not to see the value to God, man or beast of the  learned Rabbonim, who sat shaking themselves all day in the _Beth  Hamidrash_, and said they would be better occupied in supporting their  families, a view which, though mere surface blasphemy on the part of the  good woman and primarily intended as a hint to Moses to study less and  work longer, did not fail to excite lively passages of arms between the  two women. But death ended these bickerings and the _Bube_, who had  frequently reproached her son for bringing her into such an atheistic  country, was left a drag the more upon the family deprived at once of a  mother and a bread-winner. Old Mrs. Ansell was unfit: for anything save  grumbling, and so the headship naturally devolved upon Esther, whom her  mother's death left a woman getting on for eight. The commencement of  her reign coincided with a sad bisection of territory. Shocking as it  may be to better regulated minds, these seven people lived in one room.  Moses and the two boys slept in one bed and the grandmother and the  three girls in another. Esther had to sleep with her head on a  supplementary pillow at the foot of the bed. But there can be much love  in a little room.    The room was not, however, so very little, for it was of ungainly  sprawling structure, pushing out an odd limb that might have been cut  off with a curtain. The walls nodded fixedly to one another so that the  ceiling was only half the size of the floor. The furniture comprised but  the commonest necessities. This attic of the Ansells was nearer heaven  than most earthly dwelling places, for there were four tall flights of  stairs to mount before you got to it. No. 1 Royal Street had been in its  time one of the great mansions of the Ghetto; pillars of the synagogue  had quaffed _kosher_ wine in its spacious reception rooms and its  corridors had echoed with the gossip of portly dames in stiff brocades.  It was stoutly built and its balusters were of carved oak. But now the  threshold of the great street door, which was never closed, was  encrusted with black mud, and a musty odor permanently clung to the wide  staircase and blent subtly with far-away reminiscences of Mr.  Belcovitch's festive turpentine. The Ansells had numerous housemates,  for No. 1 Royal Street was a Jewish colony in itself and the resident  population was periodically swollen by the \"hands\" of the Belcovitches  and by the \"Sons of the Covenant,\" who came to worship at their  synagogue on the ground floor. What with Sugarman the _Shadchan_, on the  first floor, Mrs. Simons and Dutch Debby on the second, the Belcovitches  on the third, and the Ansells and Gabriel Hamburg, the great scholar, on  the fourth, the door-posts twinkled with _Mezuzahs_--cases or cylinders  containing sacred script with the word _Shaddai_ (Almighty) peering out  of a little glass eye at the centre. Even Dutch Debby, abandoned wretch  as she was, had this protection against evil spirits (so it has come to  be regarded) on her lintel, though she probably never touched the eye  with her finger to kiss the place of contact after the manner of the  faithful.    Thus was No. 1 Royal Street close packed with the stuff of human life,  homespun and drab enough, but not altogether profitless, may be, to turn  over and examine. So close packed was it that there was scarce breathing  space. It was only at immemorial intervals that our pauper alien made a  pun, but one day he flashed upon the world the pregnant remark that  England was well named, for to the Jew it was verily the Enge-Land,  which in German signifies the country without elbow room. Moses Ansell  chuckled softly and beatifically when he emitted the remark that  surprised all who knew him. But then it was the Rejoicing of the Law and  the Sons of the Covenant had treated him to rum and currant cake. He  often thought of his witticism afterwards, and it always lightened his  unwashed face with a happy smile. The recollection usually caught him  when he was praying.    For four years after Mrs. Ansell's charity funeral the Ansells, though  far from happy, had no history to speak of.    Benjamin accompanied Solomon to _Shool_ morning and evening to say  _Kaddish_ for their mother till he passed into the Orphan Asylum and  out of the lives of his relatives. Solomon and Rachel and Esther went to  the great school and Isaac to the infant school, while the tiny Sarah,  whose birth had cost Mrs. Ansell's life, crawled and climbed about in  the garret, the grandmother coming in negatively useful as a safeguard  against fire on the days when the grate was not empty. The _Rube's_ own  conception of her function as a safeguard against fire was quite other.    Moses was out all day working or looking for work, or praying or  listening to _Drashes_, by the _Maggid_ or other great preachers. Such  charities as brightened and warmed the Ghetto Moses usually came in for.  Bread, meat and coal tickets, god-sends from the Society for Restoring  the Soul, made odd days memorable. Blankets were not so easy to get as  in the days of poor Gittel's confinements.    What little cooking there was to do was done by Esther before or after  school; she and her children usually took their mid-day meal with them  in the shape of bread, occasionally made ambrosial by treacle The  Ansells had more fast days than the Jewish calendar, which is saying a  good deal. Providence, however, generally stepped in before the larder  had been bare twenty-four hours.    As the fast days of the Jewish calendar did not necessarily fall upon  the Ansell fast days, they were an additional tax on Moses and his  mother. Yet neither ever wavered in the scrupulous observance of them,  not a crumb of bread nor a drop of water passing their lips. In the keen  search for facts detrimental to the Ghetto it is surprising that no  political economist has hitherto exposed the abundant fasts with which  Israel has been endowed, and which obviously operate as a dole in aid of  wages. So does the Lenten period of the \"Three Weeks,\" when meat is  prohibited in memory of the shattered Temples. The Ansells kept the  \"Three Weeks\" pretty well all the year round. On rare occasions they  purchased pickled Dutch herrings or brought home pennyworths of pea soup  or of baked potatoes and rice from a neighboring cook shop. For Festival  days, if Malka had subsidized them with a half-sovereign, Esther  sometimes compounded _Tzimmus_, a dainty blend of carrots, pudding and  potatoes. She was prepared to write an essay on _Tzimmus_ as a  gastronomic ideal. There were other pleasing Polish combinations which"]]]
