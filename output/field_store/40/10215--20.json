I MUST leave by then or I shall not  reach Montreal in time to fill a very important engagement. And yet I  must see Aunty Nan, too. I have been careless and neglectful. I might  have gone to see her before. How can we manage it?\"    \"I'll bring you back to Kensington in time to catch that train,\" said  Jordan eagerly. \"There's nothing I wouldn't do for Aunty Nan--me and  Dan. Yes, sir, you'll get back in time. Just think of Aunty Nan's face  when she sees you!\"    \"I will come,\" said the great singer, gently.    It was sunset when they reached Gull Point Farm. An arc of warm gold  was over the spruces behind the house. Mrs. William was out in the  barn-yard, milking, and the house was deserted, save for the sleeping  baby in the kitchen and the little old woman with the watchful eyes in  the up-stairs room.    \"This way, ma'am,\" said Jordan, inwardly congratulating himself that the  coast was clear. \"I'll take you right up to her room.\"    Up-stairs, Joscelyn tapped at the half-open door and went in. Before  it closed behind her, Jordan heard Aunty Nan say, \"Joscelyn! Little  Joscelyn!\" in a tone that made him choke again. He stumbled thankfully  down-stairs, to be pounced upon by Mrs. William in the kitchen.    \"Jordan Sloane, who was that stylish woman you drove into the yard with?  And what have you done with her?\"    \"That was Miss Joscelyn Burnett,\" said Jordan, expanding himself. This  was his hour of triumph over Mrs. William. \"I went to Kensington and  brung her out to see Aunty Nan. She's up with her now.\"    \"Dear me,\" said Mrs. William helplessly. \"And me in my milking rig!  Jordan, for pity's sake, hold the baby while I go and put on my black  silk. You might have given a body some warning. I declare I don't know  which is the greatest idiot, you or Aunty Nan!\"    As Mrs. William flounced out of the kitchen, Jordan took his  satisfaction in a quiet laugh.    Up-stairs in the little room was a great glory of sunset and gladness  of human hearts. Joscelyn was kneeling by the bed, with her arms about  Aunty Nan; and Aunty Nan, with her face all irradiated, was stroking  Joscelyn's dark hair fondly.    \"O, little Joscelyn,\" she murmured, \"it seems too good to be true. It  seems like a beautiful dream. I knew you the minute you opened the door,  my dearie. You haven't changed a bit. And you're a famous singer now,  little Joscelyn! I always knew you would be. Oh, I want you to sing a  piece for me--just one, won't you, dearie? Sing that piece people like  to hear you sing best. I forget the name, but I've read about it in the  papers. Sing it for me, little Joscelyn.\"    And Joscelyn, standing by Aunty Nan's bed, in the sunset light, sang  the song she had sung to many a brilliant audience on many a noted  concert-platform--sang it as even she had never sung before, while Aunty  Nan lay and listened beatifically, and downstairs even Mrs. William held  her breath, entranced by the exquisite melody that floated through the  old farmhouse.    \"O, little Joscelyn!\" breathed Aunty Nan in rapture, when the song  ended.    Joscelyn knelt by her again and they had a long talk of old days. One by  one they recalled the memories of that vanished summer. The past gave up  its tears and its laughter. Heart and fancy alike went roaming through  the ways of the long ago. Aunty Nan was perfectly happy. And then  Joscelyn told her all the story of her struggles and triumphs since they  had parted.    When the moonlight began to creep in through the low window, Aunty Nan  put out her hand and touched Joscelyn's bowed head.    \"Little Joscelyn,\" she whispered, \"if it ain't asking too much, I want  you to sing just one other piece. Do you remember when you were here how  we sung hymns in the parlour every Sunday night, and my favourite always  was 'The Sands of Time are Sinking?' I ain't never forgot how you used  to sing that, and I want to hear it just once again, dearie. Sing it for  me, little Joscelyn.\"    Joscelyn rose and went to the window. Lifting back the curtain, she  stood in the splendour of the moonlight, and sang the grand old hymn.  At first Aunty Nan beat time to it feebly on the counterpane; but when  Joscelyn came to the verse, \"With mercy and with judgment,\" she folded  her hands over her breast and smiled.    When the hymn ended, Joscelyn came over to the bed.    \"I am afraid I must say good-bye now, Aunty Nan,\" she said.    Then she saw that Aunty Nan had fallen asleep. She would not waken her,  but she took from her breast the cluster of crimson roses she wore and  slipped them gently between the toil-worn fingers.    \"Good-bye, dear, sweet mother-heart,\" she murmured.    Down-stairs she met Mrs. William splendid in rustling black silk, her  broad, rubicund face smiling, overflowing with apologies and welcomes,  which Joscelyn cut short coldly.    \"Thank you, Mrs. Morrison, but I cannot possibly stay longer. No, thank  you, I don't care for any refreshments. Jordan is going to take me back  to Kensington at once. I came out to see Aunty Nan.\" \"I'm certain she'd  be delighted,\" said Mrs. William effusively. \"She's been talking about  you for weeks.\"    \"Yes, it has made her very happy,\" said Joscelyn gravely. \"And it has  made me happy, too. I love Aunty Nan, Mrs. Morrison, and I owe her much.  In all my life I have never met a woman so purely, unselfishly good and  noble and true.\"    \"Fancy now,\" said Mrs. William, rather overcome at hearing this great  singer pronounce such an encomium on quiet, timid old Aunty Nan.    Jordan drove Joscelyn back to Kensington; and up-stairs in her room  Aunty Nan slept, with that rapt smile on her face and Joscelyn's red  roses in her hands. Thus it was that Mrs. William found her, going in  the next morning with her breakfast. The sunlight crept over the pillow,  lighting up the sweet old face and silver hair, and stealing downward  to the faded red roses on her breast. Smiling and peaceful and happy  lay Aunty Nan, for she had fallen on the sleep that knows no earthy  wakening, while little Joscelyn sang.            V. The Winning of Lucinda      The marriage of a Penhallow was always the signal for a gathering of  the Penhallows. From the uttermost parts of the earth they would  come--Penhallows by birth, and Penhallows by marriage and Penhallows  by ancestry. East Grafton was the ancient habitat of the race, and  Penhallow Grange, where \"old\" John Penhallow lived, was a Mecca to them.    As for the family itself, the exact kinship of all its various branches  and ramifications was a hard thing to define. Old Uncle Julius Penhallow  was looked upon as a veritable wonder because he carried it all in his  head and could tell on sight just what relation any one Penhallow was  to any other Penhallow. The rest made a blind guess at it, for the most  part, and the younger Penhallows let it go at loose cousinship.    In this instance it was Alice Penhallow, daughter of \"young\" John  Penhallow, who was to be married. Alice was a nice girl, but she and  her wedding only pertain to this story in so far as they furnish a  background for Lucinda; hence nothing more need be said of her.    On the afternoon of her wedding day--the Penhallows held to the  good, old-fashioned custom of evening weddings with a rousing dance  afterwards--Penhallow Grange was filled to overflowing with guests who  had come there to have tea and rest themselves before going down to  \"young\" John's. Many of them had driven fifty miles. In the big  autumnal orchard the younger fry foregathered and chatted and coquetted.  Up-stairs, in \"old\" Mrs. John's bedroom, she and her married daughters  held high conclave. \"Old\" John had established himself with his sons and  sons-in-law in the parlour, and the three daughters-in-law were making  themselves at home in the blue sitting-room, ear-deep in harmless family  gossip. Lucinda and Romney Penhallow were also there.    Thin Mrs. Nathaniel Penhallow sat in a rocking chair and toasted her  toes at the grate, for the brilliant autumn afternoon was slightly  chilly and Lucinda, as usual, had the window open. She and plump Mrs.  Frederick Penhallow did most of the talking. Mrs. George Penhallow being  rather out of it by reason of her newness. She was George Penhallow's  second wife, married only a year. Hence, her contributions to the  conversation were rather spasmodic, hurled in, as it were, by dead  reckoning, being sometimes appropriate and sometimes savouring of a  point of view not strictly Penhallowesque.    Romney Penhallow was sitting in a corner, listening to the chatter of  the women, with the inscrutable smile that always vexed Mrs. Frederick.  Mrs. George wondered within herself what he did there among the women.  She also wondered just where he belonged on the family tree. He was not  one of the uncles, yet he could not be much younger than George.    \"Forty, if he is a day,\" was Mrs. George's mental dictum, \"but a very  handsome and fascinating man. I never saw such a splendid chin and  dimple.\"    Lucinda, with bronze-colored hair and the whitest of skins, defiant of  merciless sunlight and revelling in the crisp air, sat on the sill of  the open window behind the crimson vine leaves, looking out into the  garden, where dahlias flamed and asters broke into waves of purple and  snow. The ruddy light of the autumn afternoon gave a sheen to the waves  of her hair and brought out the exceeding purity of her Greek outlines.    Mrs. George knew who Lucinda was--a cousin of the second generation,  and, in spite of her thirty-five years, the acknowledged beauty of the  whole Penhallow connection.    She was one of those rare women who keep their loveliness unmarred by  the passage of years. She had ripened and matured, but she had not  grown old. The older Penhallows were still inclined, from sheer force of  habit, to look upon her as a girl, and the younger "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13545"],[0,"Mary at the Farm and Book of Recipes Compiled during Her Visit (#17)"],[1,"*        See! really I am near the house;        How short the distance seems!      There is no sense of time when one        Goes musing in his dreams.      There is the shop--the corn-crib, too--        The cider-press--just see!      The barn--the spring with drinking cup        Hung up against the tree.      The yard-fence--and the little gate        Just where it used to be.               *       *       *       *       *        Two spots on this old friendly porch        I love, nor can forget,      Till dimly in the night of death        My life's last sun shall set!      When first I left my father's house,        One summer morning bright,      My mother at that railing wept        Till I was out of sight!      Now like a holy star that spot        Shines in this world's dull night.               *       *       *       *       *        What draws my eye to yonder spot--        That bench against the wall?      What holy mem'ries cluster there,        My heart still knows them all!      How often sat my father there        On summer afternoon;      Hands meekly crossed upon his lap,        He looked so lost and lone,      As if he saw an empty world,        And hoped to leave it soon.    At the conclusion of his recital, Mary heartily thanked the Professor,  and, at his request, obediently seated herself at the old, but still  sweet-toned cottage organ, and expressed her willingness to play any  old-time songs or hymns requested, and saying, \"I know Aunt Sarah's  favorite,\" commenced playing, \"My Latest Sun is Sinking Fast,\"  followed by \"This Old-Time Religion,\" \"Jesus, Lover of My Soul,\" \"One  of the Sweet Old Chapters,\" \"Silver Threads Among the Gold\" and the  sweet old hymn, \"In the Summer Land of Song,\" by Fanny Crosby.    At John Landis' request, she played and sang \"Auld Lang Syne.\" \"When  You and I Were Young, Maggie,\" \"Old Folks at Home\" and \"Old Black  Joe.\"    Lucy Robbins, when asked for her favorites, replied; \"In the  Gloaming,\" \"The Old, Old Home'\" \"The Lost Chord\" and \"Better Bide a  Wee.\"    The Professor then asked his daughter Elizabeth to give them the music  of a song from German Volkslied, or Folk Song, with the words of which  all except Mary and Ralph were familiar. Professor Schmidt sang in his  high, cracked voice to Elizabeth's accompaniment the words of the  German song, beginning:        Du, Du liegest mir in Herzen        Du, Du liegst mir in Sinn      Du, Du machst mir viel Schmerzen        Weist nicht wie gut ich Dir binn        Ja, ja, ja, ja, Du weist nicht wie gut ich Dir bin.    The young folks all joined in the chorus. Fritz Schmidt asked  Elizabeth to play \"Polly Wolly Doodle\" for little Pollykins, which  Frit sang with gusto. Fritz then sang the rollicking German song,  \"Lauderbach,\" to an accompaniment played by Mary, and followed by  singing \"Johnny Schmoker,\" with appropriate gestures in the chorus  commencing \"My Pilly, Willy Wink, das is mein fifa,\" etc., ending with  \"My fal, lal, lal, my whach, whach, das ist mein doodle soch,\" which  he emphasised by shrugging his shoulders, to the no small enjoyment of  the young folks, who thought the silly, old German song no end of fun.  This was followed by a favorite college song, \"Mandalay,\" by Fritz.    Then Elizabeth Schmidt played and sang a pretty little German song  called \"Meuhlen Rad,\" meaning The Mill Wheel, taught her by her  mother.      MEUHLEN RAD.        In einen kuhlen grunde        Da steht ein meuhlen rad;      Mein libste ist versch wunden,        Die dort gewhoned hat;      Sie sat mir treu versprochen,        Gab ihr ein ring dabei;      Sie hat die treu gebrochen,        Das ringlein sprang entzwei.    She translated it for the benefit of Ralph and Mary: \"In a cool,  pleasant spot, stands a mill. My loved one, who lived there, has  disappeared. She promised to be true to me, and I gave her a ring. She  broke her promise and the ring broke in two.\"    Fritz then caught his little sister Pauline around the waist and  waltzed her to one end of the long room, saying: \"Mary, play the  piece, 'Put On Your Old Gray Bonnet,' and Pollykins and I will do the  cakewalk for you.\"    Polly, who had become quite a proficient little dancer under her  sister's teaching, was very willing to do her share in the evening's  entertainment, and it was pronounced a decided success.    Mary then said, \"I'll play my favorite schottische, composed by our  old friend, the Professor. I have not yet procured a copy of his  latest piece of music, 'The Passing of the Dahlias.' I think it is  still with the publishers.\"    Mary, after playing \"Rock of Ages,\" left the room to see about serving  refreshments, when Elizabeth Schmidt took her place at the instrument.  After playing \"The Rosary,\" she turned to Ralph, who had been greatly  amused by the German songs on the program, all of which were quite new  to him, and said: \"What shall I play for you?\"    He replied, \"'My Little Irish Rose'--no, I mean 'The River Shannon.'\"    \"Don't you mean 'That Grand Old Name Called Mary?'\" mischievously  inquired Fritz Schmidt, who could not refrain from teasing Ralph,  which caused a laugh at his expense, as all present were aware of his  love for Mary. Elizabeth, to cover Ralph's confusion, quickly replied:  \"I'll play my favorite, 'The End of a Perfect Day.'\"    The party was pronounced a success, and broke up at a late hour for  country folks. Before leaving, Mary's Uncle said: \"Now, let's sing  'Home, Sweet Home,' and then all join in singing that grand old hymn,  'My Country, 'Tis of Thee,' to the new tune by our friend, the Bucks  County Editor.\"    [Illustration: PALASADES OR NARROWS OF NOCKAMIXON]          CHAPTER XVIII.    A VISIT TO THE \"PENNSYLVANIA PALISADES,\" AS THE \"NARROWS\" OF THE  DELAWARE RIVER ARE CALLED.      All hailed with delight Aunt Sarah's proposal that the Schmidt and  Landis families, on the Fourth of July, drive over to the Narrows,  visit Aunt Sarah's old home at Nockamixon, and see the \"Ringing Rocks\"  and \"High Falls,\" situated a short distance from the rocks, near which  place picnics were frequently held. John Landis readily agreed to the  proposed plan, saying, \"The meadow hay and clover are cut, and I'll  not cut the wheat until the fifth day of July.\"    The third of July was a busy day at both farm houses, preparing savory  food of every description with which to fill hampers for the next  day's outing. Small Polly Schmidt was so perfectly happy, at the  thought of a proposed picnic, she could scarcely contain herself, and  as her sister Elizabeth said, \"did nothing but get in every one's  way.\" Little Polly, being easily offended, trudged over to the Landis  farm to see Mary, with whom she knew she was a great favorite.    The morning of the Fourth dawned bright and clear. Quite early, while  the earth was still enveloped in a silvery mist, and on the lattice  work of filmy cobwebs, spun over weeds and grass, dewdrops, like tiny  diamonds, sparkled and glistened, until dissolved by the sun's warm  rays, the gay party left home, for the \"Palisades\" were quite a  distance from the farm, to drive being the only way of reaching the  place, unless one boarded the gasoline motorcar, called the \"Cornfield  Express\" by farmers living in the vicinity of Schuggenhaus Township.    There is something indescribably exhilarating about starting for an  early drive in the country before sunrise on a bright, clear morning  in midsummer, when \"the earth is awaking, the sky and the ocean, the  river and forest, the mountain and plain.\" Who has not felt the sweet  freshness of early morning before \"the sunshine is all on the wing\" or  the birds awaken and begin to chatter and to sing? There is a hush  over everything; later is heard the lowing of cattle, the twitter of  birds and hum of insect life, proclaiming the birth of the new day.  Passing an uncultivated field, overgrown with burdock, wild carrots,  mullein, thistle and milk weed, Mary alighted and gathered some of the  pods of the latter, inclosing imitation of softest down, which she  used later for filling sofa pillows.    \"Look at those pretty wild canaries!\" exclaimed Aunt Sarah, \"yellow as  gold, swinging on the stem of a tall weed.\"    \"Professor Schmidt, can you tell me the name of that weed?\" questioned  Mary. \"I have always admired the plant, with its large leaves and  long, drooping racemes of crimson seeds.    \"That,\" replied the Professor, \"is a foreign plant, a weed called  Equisetum from 'Equi,' a horse, and 'Setum'--tail. The country folk  hereabout call it 'Horsetail.' It belongs to the Crptogamous or  flowerless plants. There are only four specimens of this plant in  America. I, too, have always greatly admired the plant.\"    The Professor was quite a noted botanist. There were few flowers,  plants or weeds of which he was ignorant of the name or medicinal  value. Another bird lazily picked seeds from the thistle blossoms.  \"See,\" exclaimed Aunt Sarah, \"one bird has a spear of grass in its  mouth!\"    \"Yellow star grass,\" said the Professor, \"with which to make a nest.  They never mate until the last of June, or first part of July. The  tiny, little robbers ate up nearly all my sunflower seeds in the  garden last summer.\"    \"Well,\" replied Mary, \"you know, Professor, the birds must have food.  They are the farmer's best friend. I hope you don't begrudge them a  few sunflower seeds, I love birds. I particularly admire the  'Baltimore Oriole,' with their brilliant, orange-colored plumage; they  usually make their appearance simultaneously with the blossoms in the  orchard in the south meadow; or so Aunt Sarah tells me. I love to  watch them lazily swinging on the high branches of tall trees. On the  limb of a pear tree in the orchard one day, I saw firmly fastened, a  long, pouch-like nest, woven with rare skill. Securely fastened to the  nest by various colored pieces of twine and thread was one of smaller  size, like a lean-to added to a house, "]]]
