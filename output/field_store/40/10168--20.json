And  let it be your constant care to watch over them for good, instructing them  in the fear of God, and the knowledge of the gospel of Christ, that they  may answer the end of their creation, and that God may be glorified and  honoured by them as well as by us. And so train them up, that if you should  come to behold their unhappy situation, in the same light, that many worthy  men, who are at rest, have done, and many of your brethren now do, and  should think it your duty to set them free, they may be the more capable of  making proper use of their liberty.    \"Finally, Brethren, we entreat you, in the bowels of gospel love, seriously  to weigh the cause of detaining them in bondage. If it be for your own  private gain, or any other motive than their good, it is much to be feared  that the love of God and the influence of the Holy Spirit are not the  prevailing principles in you, and that your hearts are not sufficiently  redeemed from the world, which, that you with ourselves may more and more  come to witness, through the cleansing virtue of the Holy Spirit of Jesus  Christ, is our earnest desire. With the salutation of our love we are your  friends and brethren--    \"_Signed, in behalf of the yearly meeting, by_ 'John Evans, Abraham  Farringdon, John Smith, Joseph Noble, Thomas Carleton, James Daniel,  William Trimble, Joseph Gibson, John Scarborough, John Shotwell, Joseph  Hampton, Joseph Parker.'\"    This truly Christian letter, which was written in the year 1754, was  designed, as we collect from the contents of it, to make the sentiments of  the Society better known and attended to on the subject of the Slave-trade.  It contains, as we see, exhortations to all the members within the yearly  meeting of Pennsylvania and the Jerseys, to desist from purchasing and  importing slaves, and, where they possessed them, to have a tender  consideration of their condition. But that the first part of the subject of  this exhortation might be enforced, the yearly meeting for the same  provinces came to a resolution in 1755, That if any of the members  belonging to it bought or imported slaves, the overseers were to inform  their respective monthly meetings of it, that \"these might treat with them,  as they might be directed in the wisdom of truth.\"    In the year 1774, we find the same yearly meeting legislating again on the  same subject. By the preceding resolution they, who became offenders, were  subjected only to exclusion from the meetings for discipline, and from the  privilege of contributing to the pecuniary occasions of the Society; but by  the resolution of the present year, all members concerned in importing,  selling, purchasing, giving, or transferring Negro or other slaves, or  otherwise acting in such manner as to continue them in slavery beyond the  term limited by law[A] or custom, were directed to be excluded from  membership or disowned. At this meeting also all the members of it were  cautioned and advised against acting as executors or administrators to  estates, where slaves were bequeathed, or likely to be detained in bondage.    [Footnote A: This alludes to the term of servitude for white persons in  these provinces.]    In the year 1776, the same yearly meeting carried the matter still further.  It was then enacted, That the owners of slaves, who refused to execute  proper instruments for giving them their freedom, were to be disowned  likewise.    In 1778 it was enacted by the same meeting, That the children of those, who  had been set free by members, should be tenderly advised, and have a  suitable education given them.    It is not necessary to proceed further on this subject. It may be  sufficient to say, that from this time, the Minutes of the yearly meeting  for Pennsylvania and the Jerseys exhibit proofs of an almost incessant  attention, year after year[A], to the means not only of wiping away the  stain of slavery from their religious community, but of promoting the  happiness of those restored to freedom, and of their posterity also. And  as the yearly meeting of Pennsylvania and the Jerseys set this bright  example, so those of New England, New York, Maryland, Virginia, and of  the Carolinas and Georgia, in process of time followed it.    [Footnote A: Thus in 1779, 1780,-1,-2,-4,-5,-6. The members also of this  meeting petitioned their own legislature on this subject both in 1783 and  in 1786.]    But whilst the Quakers were making these exertions at their different  yearly meetings in America, as a religious body, to get rid both of the  commerce and slavery of their fellow-creatures, others in the same  profession were acting as individuals (that is, on their own grounds and  independently of any influence from their religious communion) in the same  cause, whose labours it will now be proper, in a separate narrative, to  detail.    The first person of this description in the Society, was William Burling of  Long Island. He had conceived an abhorrence of slavery from early youth. In  process of time he began to bear his testimony against it, by representing  the unlawfulness of it to those of his own Society, when assembled at one  of their yearly meetings. This expression of his public testimony he  continued annually on the same occasion. He wrote also several tracts with  the same design, one of which, published in the year 1718, he addressed to  the elders of his own church, on the inconsistency of compelling people and  their posterity to serve them continually and arbitrarily, and without any  proper recompense for their services.    The next was Ralph Sandiford, a merchant in Philadelphia. This worthy  person had many offers of pecuniary assistance, which would have advanced  him in life, but he declined them all because they came from persons, who  had acquired their independence by the oppression of their slaves. He was  very earnest in endeavouring to prevail upon his friends, both in and out  of the Society, to liberate those whom they held in bondage. At length he  determined upon a work called The Mystery of Iniquity, in a brief  Examination of the Practice of the Times. This he published in the year  1729, though the chief judge had threatened him if he should give it to the  world, and he circulated it free of expense wherever he believed it would  be useful. The above work was excellent as a composition. The language of  it was correct. The style manly and energetic. And it abounded with facts,  sentiments, and quotations, which, while they showed the virtue and talents  of the author, rendered it a valuable appeal in behalf of the African  cause.    The next public advocate was Benjamin Lay[A], who lived at Abington, at the  distance of twelve or fourteen miles from Philadelphia. Benjamin Lay was  known, when in England, to the royal family of that day, into whose private  presence he was admitted. On his return to America, he took an active part  in behalf of the oppressed Africans. In the year 1737, he published a  treatise on Slave-keeping. This he gave away among his neighbours and  others, but more particularly among the rising youth, many of whom he  visited in their respective schools. He applied also to several of the  governors for interviews, with whom he held conferences on the subject.  Benjamin Lay was a man of strong understanding and of great integrity, but  of warm and irritable feelings, and more particularly so when he was called  forth on any occasion in which the oppressed Africans were concerned. For  he had lived in the island of Barbadoes, and he had witnessed there scenes  of cruelty towards them, which had greatly disturbed his mind, and which  unhinged it, as it were, whenever the subject of their sufferings was  brought before him. Hence if others did not think precisely as he did, when  he conversed with them on the subject, he was apt to go out of due bounds.  In bearing what he believed to be his testimony against this system of  oppression, he adopted sometimes a singularity of manner, by which, as  conveying demonstration of a certain eccentricity of character, he  diminished in some degree his usefulness to the cause which he had  undertaken; as far indeed as this eccentricity might have the effect of  preventing others from joining him in his pursuit, lest they should be  thought singular also, so far it must be allowed that he ceased to become  beneficial. But there can be no question, on the other hand, that his warm  and enthusiastic manners awakened the attention of many to the cause, and  gave them first impressions concerning it, which they never afterwards  forgot, and which rendered them useful to it in the subsequent part of  their lives.    [Footnote A: Benjamin Lay attended the meetings for worship, or associated  himself with the religious society of the Quakers. His wife too was an  approved minister of the gospel in that Society. But I believe he was not  long an acknowledged member of it himself.]    The person, who laboured next in the Society, in behalf of the oppressed  Africans, was John Woolman.    John Woolman was born at Northampton, in the county of Burlington and  province of Western New Jersey, in the year 1720. In his very early youth  he attended, in an extraordinary manner, to the religious impressions which  he perceived upon his mind, and began to have an earnest solicitude about  treading in the right path. \"From what I had read and heard,\" says he, in  his Journal[A], \"I believed there"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12434"],[0,"Twelve Studies on the Making of a Nation: The Beginnings of Israel's History (#17)"],[1," promoted prosperity.  At length a  young ruler made him his prime minister.  The result of his wise  and just measures was to bring into his country so large a number  of immigrants who preferred to live in a country where justice  reigned, that the prosperity aroused the envy and hostility of the  neighboring states.  In consequence measures were taken to put an  end to this just rule, which was felt to be so detrimental to other  kings, unwilling to adopt the same just means.   Finally the wise  Confucius was treacherously driven from his post, not, however,  until he had proved that the counsels of justice and religion were  those best suited to the welfare of the state.  This is a common  experience in all lands and ages; but perhaps nowhere else has the  lesson been so frequently and so thoroughly taught as in the  history of the Hebrews, that the most essential factor in a  statesman's training is the acceptance of the principles of justice  and righteousness.  In other words--\"God is the most important  factor in human progress.\"      _Questions for Further Consideration_.    Is it the duty of a government, in order to promote the welfare of  its people, to set aside at times the personal convenience, even  the personal welfare of individuals or of certain classes?  If an  inheritance tax falls heavily upon the heirs of a rich man, ought  the state to collect it?  On what grounds is a state justified in  withholding liberty from criminals?  From children?    Many of our states compel citizens to work in repairing country  roads.  Is this temporary peonage?  How do you justify a state in  compelling citizens to risk their lives in war?  In what  circumstances would a state be justified in compelling its citizens  to labor?  Did circumstances justify Pharaoh?  Why were he and his  kingdom punished?    Is it ever right, for an individual to raise his hand against a  recognized and established authority?  Or, when there is an  established government, should an individual ever attempt to punish  crime or avenge personal wrong?  Were our revolutionary forefathers  right in resisting the demands of King George?  Are numbers  essential to the rightness of a cause?    In what ways does God to-day call men to do an important task? Do  you consider Lincoln a man raised up by God for a purpose and  called by him to service?  If so, how did the call come?  Was  Moses' call similar?  Should a clergyman have a definite call to  his life-work?  Should every man?  Does every man have such a call,  if he but interprets rightly his experiences?    A working girl had seen the story of Moses at a moving picture  show.  Afterwards she commented as follows: \"Our walking delegate  is a  regular Moses.  He said to the factory boss, 'You let my  people go.'\"  In what respect is the labor struggle to-day similar  to that in Egypt under Moses?      _Subjects for Further Study_.

And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads  over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of  fifties, and rulers of tens.  And they judged the people at all  seasons: the hard cases they brought unto Moses, but every small  matter they judged themselves--Ex. 18:25, 26.    Love is the fulfilling of the law.--St. Paul.      Now this is the Law of the Jungle--as old and as true      as the sky;    And the Wolf that shall keep it may prosper, but the Wolf      that shall break it must die.    As the creeper that girdles the tree-trunk the Law runneth      forward and back--    For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength      of the Wolf is the Pack.    Now these are the Laws of the Jungle, and many and mighty      are they;    But the head and the hoof of the Law and the haunch and      the bump is \"_Obey_!\"      --_Kipling_.    Nothing is that errs from law.--_Tennyson_.      In vain we call old notions fudge,      And bend conventions to our dealing,    The Ten Commandments will not budge,      And stealing still continues stealing.        --_Lowell_.      If chosen men could never be alone,    In deep mid-silence, open-doored with God    No greatness ever had been dreamed or done.      These roots bear up Dominion: Knowledge, Will,--      These twain are strong, but stronger yet the third,--    Obedience,--'tis the great tap-root that still,      Knit round the rock of Duty, is not stirred,    Though Heaven-loosed tempests spend their utmost skill.      --_Lowell_ (_The Washers of the Shroud_).      I.    THE NEEDS THAT GIVE RISE TO LAW.    Kipling's _Law of the Jungle_, in which he lays down the principles  by which the wolf pack secured united action in its hunting, names  the rules that apply almost universally to peoples in the savage  stage of society.  According to the researches of the best  anthropologists, savages live in very loosely organized groups,  with no permanent ruler, no regular family law.  Each separate  group has its totem, its general rules with reference to the  marriage relation, to hunting and fishing, to shelter and  protection.  Practically there are no regular laws.  The rules  fixed by custom deal primarily with the marriage relation and with  the securing of food and shelter.  They are largely negative.  If a  member of the group has met with a misfortune in a certain by-path  or from eating certain food or in other ways, by the action of the  leader of his group that path or that food becomes taboo, and from  that time on it is forbidden.  The rules seem generally to be  largely the product of instinct or of experience, without any law  making, and they are enforced almost as instinctively by the common  consent of the people.      II.    THE GROWTH OF CUSTOMARY LAW.    As this loosely associated group condenses into the tribe, all the  members of which regard themselves as descended from a common  ancestor, the organization becomes much more definite under a  patriarchal ruler.  Soon through his activities these almost  instinctive habits, guided by rules, assume the nature of customs  that have a sanction, often of religion, practically always of  enforcement through the patriarch.  No better illustration of the  crystallization of customs into laws can be found than that given  in Exodus 18:1-27 (_Hist. Bible_, I, 198-202).  Moses sat all day  long as judge to decide cases for the people until his  practical-minded father-in-law, Jethro, seeing the waste of time  and energy of the ruler upon whom the welfare of the tribe  depended, proposed a wise plan.  He advised that, instead of  rendering decisions regarding each individual case, Moses should  formulate the principles and leave their application to minor  judges appointed by himself as rulers over thousands and over  hundreds and fifties and tens.  In modern days the law-making body  is distinct from the judicial.  Is there any reason why the judge  should not be the maker of the law he interprets?    Doubtless many of the customs thus formulated by Moses had come  down through the preceding ages from the Babylonian and common  Semitic ancestors of the Hebrews.  The most striking example of the  pre-Mosaic formulation of custom into law under the sanction of the  deity is found in the so-called code of Hammurabi, which comes from  about 1900 B.C.  At the top of the stele which records these laws  this enlightened king depicted himself in a bas-relief as receiving  them from the sun god, Shamash.  Hammurabi looked upon himself as a  shepherd chosen by the gods to care for his people.  It was his  duty to see \"that the great should not oppress the weak, to counsel  the widow and orphan, to render judgment and decide the decisions  of the land, and to succor the injured,\" in order that \"by the  command of Shamash, the judge supreme of heaven and earth, justice  might shine in the land.\"  Many of the principles laid down by him  are also found among the laws attributed to Moses which were  afterward codified in the early decalogues.    At times, though rarely among the Hebrews, we may study custom in  the making, as when in a new situation a ruler renders a decision  which henceforth becomes a law.  Thus David, dividing the spoil  after his victory over the Amalekites, established a precedent that  henceforth had binding force upon his followers (I Sam. 30); but in  the majority of such cases the ruler, even when be establishes new  precedents, represents himself as simply interpreting ancient  custom.    As society becomes more and more complex and the interests of  individuals and classes in society clash, besides the judges we  find legislatures making new rules in the form of law.  In the  earlier communities practically all law relates to the preservation  of life and of the tribe.  Later, as the tribe enters the pastoral  state, private property is established and laws for its care are  made. "]]]
