The milk bottles should always be closed and the butter  carefully wrapped or put in a covered receptacle. Onions, cabbage, and  other foods with strong odors, when placed in the refrigerator, should  be kept in tightly closed jars or dishes, so that the odors will not  escape. Before fresh fruits and perishable vegetables--that is,  vegetables that decay easily--are put into the refrigerator, they should  be carefully looked over and all decayed portions removed from them. No  food should be placed in the ice chamber, because this will cause the  ice to melt unnecessarily.    50. CARE OF THE REFRIGERATOR.--It is essential that all parts of the  refrigerator be kept scrupulously clean and as dry as possible. To  accomplish this, nothing should be allowed to spoil in it, and anything  spilled in the refrigerator should be cleaned out immediately. The foods  that are left over should be carefully inspected every day, and anything  not likely to be used within a day or so should be disposed of. At least  once a week the food should be removed from all compartments, the racks  taken out, the drain pipe disconnected, and each part thoroughly washed,  rinsed with boiling water, and dried. The inside of the refrigerator  should likewise be washed, rinsed, and wiped dry, after which the drain  pipe should be connected, the shelves put back in place, and the  food replaced.    The ice chamber of the refrigerator should also be cleaned frequently,  the best time to do this being when the ice has melted enough to be  lifted out conveniently. To prevent the ice from melting rapidly when it  is out of the refrigerator, it may be wrapped in paper or a piece of old  blanket, but this covering must be removed when the ice is replaced in  the chamber, in order to allow the ice to melt in the refrigerator.  Otherwise, it would be impossible to chill the refrigerator properly,  the temperature remaining the same as that outside, for it is as the ice  gradually melts that the air in the refrigerator becomes cool. Of  course, every effort should be made to keep the ice from wasting.  Therefore, while the refrigerator should be kept in a convenient place,  it should not be exposed to too great heat; also, the doors should be  kept tightly closed, and, as has already been explained, hot foods  should not be put in until they are sufficiently cooled. Attention must  be given to the care of the refrigerator, for only when it is clean and  dry can the growth of bacteria that attack foods be prevented.      KEEPING FOODS WITHOUT ICE    51. While a refrigerator simplifies the preserving of cooked foods and  those subject to quick decay, there are many communities in which it is  not possible to procure ice conveniently, thus making it necessary to  adopt some other means of keeping food. Then, too, there are generally  quantities of foods, such as winter vegetables, apples, etc., that  cannot be stored in a refrigerator, but must be taken care of properly.  In such cases, the method of storing depends to a certain extent on  conditions. On many farms there are spring houses in which foods may be  stored in order to keep them cool during very warm weather; but in the  majority of homes, the cellar, on account of its being cool, is utilized  for the storage of large quantities of food and even for keeping the  more perishable foods when ice cannot be obtained.    [Illustration: Fig. 14]    52. STORING FOODS IN CELLARS.--In order that a cellar may furnish a safe  place for keeping food, it must be well built and properly cared for. If  it is dug in wet ground and is not well drained, it will become musty  and damp, and fruits and vegetables stored in it will be attacked by  mold. A small part of the cellar should be without a floor, as many  winter vegetables seem to keep better when placed on dry ground, but the  remainder should have a flooring of either well-matched boards or cement  that can be kept clean and dry. Ventilation must also be supplied;  otherwise, odors will be retained that will taint the food kept in the  cellar. To allow the passage of air and light from the outside and thus  secure proper ventilation, the cellar should be provided with windows.  These will also assist very much in the cleaning and airing of the  cellar, processes that should never be overlooked if good results are  desired. In addition to the cleaning of the cellar, constant attention  should be given to the foods kept there. Foods that have spoiled or are  beginning to spoil should be disposed of quickly, for decayed food that  is not removed from the cellar will affect the conditions for keeping  other foods and may be injurious to the health of the family.    [Illustration: Fig. 15]    53. All foods likely to be contaminated by dust and flies in the cellar  must be carefully covered. A screened frame fastened to the wall with  brackets, like the one shown in Fig. 14, is excellent for this purpose,  because it prevents the attack of vermin and permits of ventilation. If  canned goods are to be stored, a cellar cupboard like that shown in Fig.  15 is a very good place in which to keep them. Separate bins should, if  possible, be provided for fruits, potatoes, and other winter vegetables,  and, as shown in Fig. 16, such bins should be so built as to allow air  to pass through them.    [Illustration: Fig. 16]    54. WINDOW BOXES.--The woman who lives in an apartment where there is no  cellar and who does not wish to keep ice in the refrigerator through  the winter will find a window box a very good device in which to keep  food. Such a box is also a convenience for the woman who has a cellar,  but wishes to save steps. A box of this kind is built to fit a kitchen  or a pantry window, and is placed outside of the window, so that the  opening comes toward the room. Such an arrangement, which is illustrated  in Fig. 17, will make the contents of the box easily accessible when the  window is raised. A box for this purpose may be made of wood or  galvanized iron, and it is usually supported by suitable brackets. Its  capacity may be increased by building a shelf in it half way to the top,  and provided it is made of wood, it can be more easily cleaned if it is  lined with table oilcloth.    [Illustration: Fig. 17]      STORING OF NON-PERISHABLE FOODS    55. It may seem unnecessary to give much attention to the storing of  foods that do not spoil easily, but there are good reasons why such  foods require careful storage. They should be properly cared for to  prevent the loss of flavor by exposure to the air, to prevent the  absorption of moisture, which produces a favorable opportunity for the  growth of molds, and to prevent the attacks of insects and vermin. The  best way in which to care for such foods is to store them in tightly  closed vessels. Earthenware and glass jars, lard pails, coffee and  cocoa cans, all carefully cleaned and having lids to fit, prove to be  very satisfactory receptacles for such purposes.    56. Unless coffee, tea, cocoa, spices, and prepared cereals are bought  in cans or moisture-proof containers, they should be emptied from the  original packages and placed in jars that can be tightly closed, so that  they will not deteriorate by being exposed to the air or moisture. For  convenience and economy, these jars or cans should be labeled. Sugar and  salt absorb moisture and form lumps when exposed to the air, and they,  too, should be properly kept. A tin receptacle is the best kind for  sugar, but for salt an earthenware or glass vessel should be used. It is  not advisable to put these foods or any others into cupboards in paper  bags, because foods kept in this way make disorderly looking shelves and  are easily accessible to vermin, which are always attracted to food  whenever it is not well protected.    Canned goods bought in tin cans do not need very careful storage. It is  sufficient to keep them in a place dry enough to prevent the cans from  rusting. Foods canned in glass, however, should be kept where they are  not exposed to the light, as they will become more or less discolored  unless they are stored in dark places.    Flour, meals, and cereals stored in quantities develop mold unless they  are kept very dry. For the storing of these foods, therefore, wooden  bins or metal-lined boxes kept in a dry place are the most satisfactory.      STORING OF SEMIPERISHABLE FOODS    57. Practically all vegetables and fruits with skins may be regarded as  semiperishable foods, and while they do not spoil so easily as some  foods, they require a certain amount of care. Potatoes are easily kept  from spoiling if they are placed in a cool, dry, dark place, such as a  cellar, a bin like that shown in Fig. 16 furnishing a very good means  for such storage. It is, of course, economical to buy potatoes in large  quantities, but if they must be kept under conditions that will permit  them to sprout, shrivel, rot, or freeze, it is better to buy only a  small quantity at a time. Sweet potatoes may be bought in considerable  quantity and kept for some time if they are wrapped separately in pieces  of paper and packed so that they do not touch one another.    Carrots, turnips, beets, and parsnips can be kept through the winter in  very much the same manner as potatoes. They deteriorate less, however,  if they are covered with earth or sand. Sometimes, especially in country  districts, such winter vegetables are buried in the ground out of doors,  being placed at a depth that renders them safe from the attacks of  frost. Cabbage will keep very well if placed in barrels or boxes, but  for long keeping, the roots should not be removed. Pumpkin and squash  thoroughly matured do not spoil readily if they are stored in a  dry place.    Apples and pears may be stored in boxes or barrels, but very fine"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9938"],[0,"Woman's Institute Library of Cookery.

Allow this to cook for 30 to 35 minutes, beat to keep smooth,  and then remove from the fire and add the vanilla. Moisten cups or molds  with cold water and fill with the blanc mange. Cool, turn out of the  molds, and serve with any desired sauce.    [Illustration: FIG. 3, Chocolate Blanc Mange.]    33. CHOCOLATE BLANC MANGE.--Chocolate added to blanc mange gives it an  excellent flavor. If a sauce is desired with this blanc mange, custard  sauce is the best one to use. An attractive way in which to serve  chocolate blanc mange is shown in Fig. 3. The entire recipe is made into  one mold, which, when cold, is turned out on a dish, surrounded with  slices of banana, and garnished with whipped cream.    CHOCOLATE BLANC MANGE  (Sufficient to Serve Four)    1/3 c. sugar  1/4 c. cocoa  1/4 tsp. salt  2 c. milk  1/4 c. corn starch  1/2 tsp. vanilla    Mix the sugar, cocoa, and salt and moisten with some of the milk. Place  over the fire in the inner pan of a double boiler and allow it to come  to a boil. Moisten the corn starch with some of the milk and add the  rest to the cocoa mixture in the double boiler. Heat together in the  boiler and stir the corn starch into this. Continue stirring until the  corn starch has thickened the mixture, and then cook for 30 to 35  minutes. Remove from the fire, add the vanilla, pour into a mold  moistened with cold water, cool, and serve with sweetened cream, custard  sauce, or as shown in Fig. 3.    34. RICE CUSTARD.--A very good way in which to use left-over rice is to  make a rice custard of it. If no cooked rice is on hand and rice is to  be cooked for some other dish, it is not a bad plan to increase the  amount slightly and use what remains for rice custard. The best method  of preparing rice for this dessert it to steam it, but boiled or  Japanese rice may also be used.    RICE CUSTARD  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    2 eggs  1/2 c. sugar  1-1/2 c. hot milk  1/4 tsp. salt  1/4 tsp. grated nutmeg  2 c. steamed rice    Beat the eggs and to them add the sugar, hot milk, salt, and nutmeg.  Pour this mixture over the rice. Place in a buttered baking dish, set  the dish in a pan of warm water, and bake in a moderate oven until the  custard is set. This will probably require about 45 minutes. Cool  and serve.    35. POOR MAN'S PUDDING.--If a very economical dessert is desired, poor  man's pudding should be tried. However, this requires considerable fuel  and some care in its preparation, for it needs long, slow cooking in  order to make it a good pudding, but when it is properly made it is a  very delicious dessert. If a coal stove is used, it is a good plan to  make such a dessert as this on a day when the stove is heated for  ironing or for some other purpose that requires the use of fuel covering  a long period of time.    POOR MAN'S PUDDING  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 c. rice  2/3 c. sugar  1 tsp. salt  Nutmeg  Lemon rind  2 qt. milk  1/2 c. raisins    Wash the rice in the usual way and place it in a baking dish. Add the  sugar, salt, a grating of nutmeg, and a few thin slices of lemon rind.  Pour in the milk, place in a slow oven, and bake for several hours. Stir  frequently to prevent the top surface from browning, and if there is any  possibility of this occurring, cover the baking dish with a cover. One  hour before the pudding has finished baking, clean the raisins and add  them. When done, remove from the oven, cool, and serve. When the pudding  is served, the grains of rice should be whole and the liquid should be  of a creamy consistency. If the pudding is too dry when cool, add a  little more milk and return to the oven for a few minutes.    36. TAPIOCA CREAM.--In the dessert here given, as well as in several  that follow, tapioca is used as the thickening material. TAPIOCA is  practically a true starch and is taken from the roots of the cassava  plant, which grows in tropical and subtropical regions. In the process  of its manufacture, most of the starch cells are ruptured. It may be  purchased in two forms: one that is large in size and called _pearl  tapioca_ and the other, very small and known as _minute tapioca_. Pearl  tapioca does not require as long cooking if it is first soaked in cold  water for a number of hours. Minute tapioca cooks in much less time than  pearl tapioca.    Tapioca cream is a soft custard that should be thin enough to pour when  it is cold. It may be served with whipped cream if desired or may merely  be poured into dessert dishes or sherbet glasses and served plain. A  spoonful of pink jelly on top of each serving makes a very  attractive garnish.    TAPIOCA CREAM  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1/3 c. tapioca  1 pt. milk  1/2 c. sugar  1/2 tsp. salt  2 eggs  1/2 tsp. vanilla    Soak the tapioca in cold water for 4 or 5 hours before making the  dessert, and then drain off all the water. Heat the milk in a double  boiler, stir the tapioca into the hot milk, and cook until it is thick  and transparent, being sure that none of the centers are uncooked. Add  the sugar and salt. Separate the whites and yolks of the eggs. Beat the  yolks, mix a small amount of the hot tapioca with them, and stir into  the tapioca in the double boiler. Stir until the eggs have thickened and  then remove from the fire. Beat the whites until they are stiff and  fold, with the vanilla, into the tapioca. Cool and serve.    37. TAPIOCA CUSTARD.--If something different in the way of a tapioca  dessert is desired, tapioca custard will no doubt be very acceptable.  This dessert has the consistency of a baked custard containing tapioca,  and in preparation and proportion that is really what it is.    TAPIOCA CUSTARD  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1/2 c. tapioca  2 c. milk  2 eggs  2/3 c. sugar  1 tsp. salt  1/2 tsp. vanilla    Soak the tapioca for 4 or 5 hours and drain off the water. Cook the  tapioca and the milk in a double boiler until it is transparent and  remove from the fire. Beat the eggs and to them add the sugar, salt, and  vanilla, and stir this into the tapioca. Turn into a buttered baking  dish and bake until the custard mixture is set. Cool and serve.    38. MINUTE-TAPIOCA CUSTARD.--Minute tapioca does not require soaking nor  as long cooking as pearl tapioca, for the pieces of tapioca being much  smaller may be more quickly penetrated by both heat and moisture. Then,  too, a smaller proportion of it is required to thicken the same  amount of milk.    MINUTE-TAPIOCA CUSTARD  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    2 c. milk  2 Tb. minute tapioca  1 egg  1/4 c. sugar  1/2 tsp. salt  Vanilla    Heat the milk in a double boiler, add the tapioca, and cook for 15 or 20  minutes. Beat the egg, add to it the sugar and salt, and pour the hot  tapioca gradually into this. Flavor with vanilla, turn into a buttered  baking dish, place in the oven in a pan of water, and bake for 20 to 30  minutes. Cool and serve.    39. APPLE TAPIOCA.--The combination of fruit and tapioca is agreeable to  most persons. Peaches and apples, either fresh or canned, are used  oftenest for this purpose. For the apple tapioca here given, the apples  should be somewhat sour, as there will then be more character to the  dessert. Canned or fresh peaches or canned pineapple may be used in  exactly the same way as apples. If canned fruit is used, not so much  sugar nor baking in the oven will be necessary.    APPLE TAPIOCA  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    3/4 c. pearl tapioca or 1/2 c. minute tapioca  2 c. boiling water  1/2 tsp. salt  6 apples  1/2 c. brown sugar  1 tsp. cinnamon  1 Tb. butter    If pearl tapioca is used, soak it for 4 or 5 hours and then drain off  all the water. Minute tapioca will need no soaking. Add the tapioca to  the boiling water and salt. Cook in a double boiler until the tapioca is  entirely transparent. Pare and core the apples, place them in a buttered  baking dish, fill each cavity with sugar and cinnamon, and place a piece  of butter on top. Pour the hot tapioca over these, place in a hot oven,  and bake until the apples are soft. Serve either hot or cold with sugar  and cream.    40. CARAMEL TAPIOCA.--Persons who care for caramel as a flavoring will  find caramel tapioca a delicious dessert. The caramel for it should be  made according to the directions given in Art. 25.    CARAMEL TAPIOCA  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 c. pearl tapioca  5 c. water  2 c. sugar  1/2 c. boiling water  1 lemon    Put the tapioca to soak overnight in the water. When ready to prepare,  place in a baking dish with the water used to soak the tapioca and set  in a very slow oven. Caramelize half the sugar and add to it the 1/2  cupful of boiling water. Pour this with the remaining cup of sugar over  the tapioca and continue to cook in the oven until the tapioca is  perfectly clear and the liquid has evaporated sufficiently to make a  dessert of the proper consistency to serve. Upon removing from the oven,  squeeze the juice of the lemon over the tapioca and stir slowly so that  this may penetrate throughout the dessert. Cool and serve with  whipped cream.    41. FARINA CUSTARD.--A means of using left-over breakfast cereals is  given in the accompanying recipe. Farina is the cereal used, but vitos,  cream of wheat, etc. may be used in the same way. Cereal may be cooked  especially for the purpose if there is none on hand and the dessert is  desired. In this event, it should be cooked in the usual way and may be  used either warm or cold.    FARINA CUSTARD  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1-1/2 c. cooked farina  1-1/2 c. milk  1 egg  1/3 c. sugar  1/4 tsp. salt  1/2 tsp. lemon  1/2 tsp. vanilla    Mix the farina with the milk. Beat the egg and to it add the sugar and  salt. Add this to the farina and milk, stir in the flavoring, and pour  in a buttered baking dish. Bake until the mixture is set. This will  require about 45 minutes in a moderate oven.           *       *       *       *       *      GELATINE DESSERTS    PRINCIPLES OF"]]]
