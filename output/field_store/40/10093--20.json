He's got so moody and gloomy at home, he hardly ever speaks.'    Mary sat silent for a minute thinking. Then Mrs Spicer roused herself--    'Oh, I don't know what I'm talkin' about! You mustn't take any notice of  me, Mrs Wilson,--I don't often go on like this. I do believe I'm gittin'  a bit ratty at times. It must be the heat and the dulness.'    But once or twice afterwards she referred to a time 'when Spicer was a  different man to what he was now.'    I walked home with her a piece along the creek. She said nothing for  a long time, and seemed to be thinking in a puzzled way. Then she said  suddenly--    'What-did-you-bring-her-here-for? She's only a girl.'    'I beg pardon, Mrs Spicer.'    'Oh, I don't know what I'm talkin' about! I b'lieve I'm gittin' ratty.  You mustn't take any notice of me, Mr Wilson.'    She wasn't much company for Mary; and often, when she had a child with  her, she'd start taking notice of the baby while Mary was talking, which  used to exasperate Mary. But poor Mrs Spicer couldn't help it, and she  seemed to hear all the same.    Her great trouble was that she 'couldn't git no reg'lar schoolin' for  the children.'    'I learns 'em at home as much as I can. But I don't git a minute to  call me own; an' I'm ginerally that dead-beat at night that I'm fit for  nothink.'    Mary had some of the children up now and then later on, and taught them  a little. When she first offered to do so, Mrs Spicer laid hold of the  handiest youngster and said--    'There--do you hear that? Mrs Wilson is goin' to teach yer, an'  it's more than yer deserve!' (the youngster had been 'cryin'' over  something). 'Now, go up an' say \"Thenk yer, Mrs Wilson.\" And if yer  ain't good, and don't do as she tells yer, I'll break every bone in yer  young body!'    The poor little devil stammered something, and escaped.    The children were sent by turns over to Wall's to Sunday-school. When  Tommy was at home he had a new pair of elastic-side boots, and there was  no end of rows about them in the family--for the mother made him lend  them to his sister Annie, to go to Sunday-school in, in her turn. There  were only about three pairs of anyway decent boots in the family, and  these were saved for great occasions. The children were always as clean  and tidy as possible when they came to our place.    And I think the saddest and most pathetic sight on the face of God's  earth is the children of very poor people made to appear well: the  broken worn-out boots polished or greased, the blackened (inked) pieces  of string for laces; the clean patched pinafores over the wretched  threadbare frocks. Behind the little row of children hand-in-hand--and  no matter where they are--I always see the worn face of the mother.    Towards the end of the first year on the selection our little girl came.  I'd sent Mary to Gulgong for four months that time, and when she came  back with the baby Mrs Spicer used to come up pretty often. She came up  several times when Mary was ill, to lend a hand. She wouldn't sit down  and condole with Mary, or waste her time asking questions, or talking  about the time when she was ill herself. She'd take off her hat--a  shapeless little lump of black straw she wore for visiting--give  her hair a quick brush back with the palms of her hands, roll up her  sleeves, and set to work to 'tidy up'. She seemed to take most pleasure  in sorting out our children's clothes, and dressing them. Perhaps she  used to dress her own like that in the days when Spicer was a different  man from what he was now. She seemed interested in the fashion-plates  of some women's journals we had, and used to study them with an interest  that puzzled me, for she was not likely to go in for fashion. She never  talked of her early girlhood; but Mary, from some things she noticed,  was inclined to think that Mrs Spicer had been fairly well brought up.  For instance, Dr Balanfantie, from Cudgeegong, came out to see Wall's  wife, and drove up the creek to our place on his way back to see how  Mary and the baby were getting on. Mary got out some crockery and some  table-napkins that she had packed away for occasions like this; and  she said that the way Mrs Spicer handled the things, and helped set the  table (though she did it in a mechanical sort of way), convinced her  that she had been used to table-napkins at one time in her life.    Sometimes, after a long pause in the conversation, Mrs Spicer would say  suddenly--    'Oh, I don't think I'll come up next week, Mrs Wilson.'    'Why, Mrs Spicer?'    'Because the visits doesn't do me any good. I git the dismals  afterwards.'    'Why, Mrs Spicer? What on earth do you mean?'    'Oh,-I-don't-know-what-I'm-talkin'-about. You mustn't take any notice  of me.' And she'd put on her hat, kiss the children--and Mary too,  sometimes, as if she mistook her for a child--and go.    Mary thought her a little mad at times. But I seemed to understand.    Once, when Mrs Spicer was sick, Mary went down to her, and down again  next day. As she was coming away the second time, Mrs Spicer said--    'I wish you wouldn't come down any more till I'm on me feet, Mrs Wilson.  The children can do for me.'    'Why, Mrs Spicer?'    'Well, the place is in such a muck, and it hurts me.'    We were the aristocrats of Lahey's Creek. Whenever we drove down on  Sunday afternoon to see Mrs Spicer, and as soon as we got near enough  for them to hear the rattle of the cart, we'd see the children running  to the house as fast as they could split, and hear them screaming--    'Oh, marther! Here comes Mr and Mrs Wilson in their spring-cart.'    And we'd see her bustle round, and two or three fowls fly out the  front door, and she'd lay hold of a broom (made of a bound bunch of  'broom-stuff'--coarse reedy grass or bush from the ridges--with a stick  stuck in it) and flick out the floor, with a flick or two round in front  of the door perhaps. The floor nearly always needed at least one flick  of the broom on account of the fowls. Or she'd catch a youngster and  scrub his face with a wet end of a cloudy towel, or twist the towel  round her finger and dig out his ears--as if she was anxious to have him  hear every word that was going to be said.    No matter what state the house would be in she'd always say, 'I was jist  expectin' yer, Mrs Wilson.' And she was original in that, anyway.    She had an old patched and darned white table-cloth that she used to  spread on the table when we were there, as a matter of course ('The  others is in the wash, so you must excuse this, Mrs Wilson'), but I saw  by the eyes of the children that the cloth was rather a wonderful thing  to them. 'I must really git some more knives an' forks next time I'm in  Cobborah,' she'd say. 'The children break an' lose 'em till I'm ashamed  to ask Christians ter sit down ter the table.'    She had many Bush yarns, some of them very funny, some of them rather  ghastly, but all interesting, and with a grim sort of humour about them.  But the effect was often spoilt by her screaming at the children to  'Drive out them fowls, karnt yer,' or 'Take yer maulies [hands] outer  the sugar,' or 'Don't touch Mrs Wilson's baby with them dirty maulies,'  or 'Don't stand starin' at Mrs Wilson with yer mouth an' ears in that  vulgar way.'    Poor woman! she seemed everlastingly nagging at the children. It was  a habit, but they didn't seem to mind. Most Bushwomen get the nagging  habit. I remember one, who had the prettiest, dearest, sweetest, most  willing, and affectionate little girl I think I ever saw, and she nagged  that child from daylight till dark--and after it. Taking it all round,  I think that the nagging habit in a mother is often worse on ordinary  children, and more deadly on sensitive youngsters, than the drinking  habit in a father.    One of the yarns Mrs Spicer told us was about a squatter she knew who  used to go wrong in his head every now and again, and try to commit  suicide. Once, when the station-hand, who was watching him, had his eye  off him for a minute, he hanged himself to a beam in the stable. The  men ran in and found him hanging and kicking. 'They let him hang for  a while,' said Mrs Spicer, 'till he went black in the face and stopped  kicking. Then they cut him down and threw a bucket of water over him.'    'Why! what on earth did they let the man hang for?' asked Mary.    'To give him a good bellyful of it: they thought it would cure him of  tryin' to hang himself again.'    'Well, that's the coolest thing I ever heard of,' said Mary.    'That's jist what the magistrate said, Mrs Wilson,' said Mrs Spicer.    'One morning,' said Mrs Spicer, 'Spicer had gone off on his horse  somewhere, and I was alone with the children, when a man came to the  door and said--    '\"For God's sake, woman, give me a drink!\"    'Lord only knows where he came from! He was dressed like a new chum--his  clothes was good, but he looked as if he'd been sleepin' in them in the  Bush for a month. He was very shaky. I had some coffee that mornin',  so I gave him some in a pint pot; he drank it, and then he stood on his  head till he tumbled over, and then he stood up on his feet and said,  \"Thenk yer, mum.\"    'I was so surprised that I didn't know what to say, so I jist said,  \"Would you like some more coffee?\"    '\"Yes, thenk yer,\" he said--\"about two quarts.\"    'I nearly filled the pint pot, and he drank it and stood on his head  as long as he could, and when he got right end up he said, \"Thenk yer,  mum--it's a fine day,\" and then he walked off. He had two saddle-straps  in his hands.'    'Why, what did he stand on his head for?' asked Mary.    'To wash it up and down, I suppose, to get twice as much taste of the  coffee. He had no hat. I sent Tommy across to Wall's to tell them that  there was a man wanderin' about the Bush in the horrors of drink, and  to get some one to ride for the police.

Under that Swaraj the nation will have the power to impose  a heavy protective tariff on such foreign goods as are capable of being  manufactured in India, as also the power to refuse to send a single  soldier outside India for the purpose of enslaving the surrounding or  remote nationalities. The Swaraj that I dream of will be a possibility  only, when the nation is free to make its choice both of good and evil.          *      *      *      *       *    I adhere to all I have said in that booklet and I would certainly  recommend it to the reader. Government over self is the truest Swaraj,  it is synonymous with _moksha_ or salvation, and I have seen nothing to  alter the view that doctors, lawyers, and railways are no help, and are  often a hindrance, to the one thing worth striving after. But I know  that association, a satanic activity, such as the Government is engaged  in, makes even an effort for such freedom a practical impossibility. I  cannot tender allegiance to God and Satan at the same time.          *      *      *      *       *    The surest sign of the satanic nature of the present system is that even  a nobleman of the type of Lord Ronaldshay is obliged to put us off the  track. He will not deal with the one thing needful. Why is he silent  about the Punjab? Why does he evade the Khilafat? Can ointments soothe  a patient who is suffering from corroding consumption? Does his lordship  not see that it is not the inadequacy of the reforms that has set India  aflame but that it is the infliction of the two wrongs and the wicked  attempt to make us forget them? Does he not see that a complete change  of heart is required before reconciliation?           *       *       *       *       *    But it has become the fashion nowadays to ascribe hatred to  non-co-operationism. And I regret to find that even Col. Wedgewood has  fallen into the trap. I make bold to say that the only way to remove  hatred is to give it disciplined vent. No man can--I cannot--perform the  impossible task of removing hatred so long as contempt and despise for  the feelings of India are sedulously nursed. It is a mockery to ask  India not to hate when in the same breath India's most sacred feelings  are contemptuously brushed aside. India feels weak and helpless and so  expresses her helplessness by hating the tyrant who despises her and  makes her crawl on the belly, lifts the veils of her innocent women and  compels her tender children to acknowledge his power by saluting his  flag four times a day. The gospel of Non-co-operation addresses itself  to the task of making the people strong and self-reliant. It is an  attempt to transform hatred into pity. A strong and self-reliant India  will cease to hate Bosworth Smiths and Frank Johnsons, for she will have  the power to punish them and therefore the power also to pity and  forgive them. To-day she can neither punish nor forgive, and therefore  helplessly nurses hatred. If the Mussalmans were strong, they would not  hate the English but would fight and wrest from them the dearest  possessions of Islam. I know that the Ali Brothers who live only for the  honour and the prestige of Islam, and are prepared any moment to die for  it, will to-day make friends with the latter Englishmen, if they were to  do justice to the Khilafat which it is in their power to do.          *      *      *      *       *    I am positively certain that there is no personal element in this fight.  Both the Hindus and the Mahomedans would to-day invoke blessings on the  English if they would but give proof positive of their goodness,  faithfulness, and loyalty to India. Non-co-operation then is a godsend;  it will purify and strengthen India; and a strong India will be a  strength to the world as an Indian weak and helpless is a curse to  mankind. Indian soldiers have involuntarily helped to destroy Turkey and  are now destroying the flower of the Arabian nation. I cannot recall a  single campaign in which the Indian soldier has been employed by the  British Government for the good of mankind. And yet, (Oh! the shame of  it!) Indian Maharajas are never tired of priding themselves on the loyal  help they have rendered the English! Could degradation sink any lower?      THE CONGRESS CONSTITUTION    The belated report of the Congress Constitution Committee has now been  published for general information and opinion has been invited from all  public bodies in order to assist the deliberations of the All India  Congress Committee. It is a pity that, small though the Constitution  Committee was, all the members never met at any one time in spite of  efforts, to have a meeting of them all. It is perhaps no body's fault  that all the members could not meet. At the same time the draft report  has passed through the searching examination of all but one member and  the report represents the mature deliberations of four out of the five  members. It must be stated at the same time that it does not pretend to  be the unanimous opinion of the members. Rather than present a  dissenting minute, a workable scheme has been brought out leaving each  member free to press his own views on to several matters in which they  are not quite unanimous. The most important part of the constitution,  however, is the alteration of the creed. So far as I am aware there is  no fundamental difference of opinion between the members. In my opinion  the altered creed represents the exact feeling of the country at the  present moment.    I know that the proposed alteration has been subjected to hostile  criticism in several newspapers of note. But the extraordinary situation  that faces the country is that popular opinion is far in advance of  several newspapers which have hitherto commanded influence and have  undoubtedly moulded public opinion. The fact is that the formation of  opinion to-day is by no means confined to the educated classes, but the  masses have taken it upon themselves not only to formulate opinion but  to enforce it. It would be a mistake to belittle or ignore this opinion,  or to ascribe it to a temporary upheaval. It would be equally a mistake  to suppose that this awakening amongst the masses is due either to the  activity of the Ali Brothers or myself. For the time being we have the  ear of the masses because we voice their sentiments. The masses are by  no means so foolish or unintelligent as we sometimes imagine. They often  perceive things with their intuition, which we ourselves fail to see  with our intellect. But whilst the masses know what they want, they  often do not know how to express their wants and, less often, how to get  what they want. Herein comes the use of leadership, and disastrous  results can easily follow a bad, hasty, or what is worse, selfish lead.    The first part of the proposed creed expresses the present desire of  the nation, and the second shows the way that desire can be fulfilled.  In my humble opinion the Congress creed with the proposed alteration is  but an extension of the original. And so long as no break with the  British connection is attempted, it is strictly within even the existing  article that defines the Congress creed. The extension lies in the  contemplated possibility of a break with the British connection. In my  humble opinion, if India is to make unhampered progress, we must make it  clear to the British people that whilst we desire to retain the British  connection, if we can rise to our full height with it we are determined  to dispense with, and even to get rid of that connection, if that is  necessary for full national development. I hold that it is not only  derogatory to national dignity but it actually impedes national progress  superstitiously to believe that our progress towards our goal is  impossible without British connection. It is this superstition which  makes some of the best of us tolerate the Punjab wrong and the Khilafat  insult. This blind adherence to that connection makes us feel helpless.  The proposed alteration in the creed enables us to rid ourselves of our  helpless condition. I personally hold that it is perfectly  constitutional openly to strive after independence, but lest there may  be dispute as to the constitutional character of any movement for  complete independence, the doubtful and highly technical adjective  \"constitutional\" has been removed from the altered creed in the draft.  Surely it should be enough to ensure that the methods for achieving our  end are legitimate, honourable, and peaceful, I believe that this was  the reasoning that guided my colleagues in accepting the proposed creed.  In any case, such was certainly my view of the whole alteration. There  is no desire on my part to adopt any means that are subversive of law  and order. I know, however, that I am treading on delicate ground when I  write about law and order for, to some of our distinguished leaders even  my present methods appear to be lawless and conducive to disorder. But  even they will perhaps grant that the retention of the word  'constitutional' cannot protect the country against methods such as I am  employing. It gives rise, no doubt, to a luminous legal discussion, but  any such discussion is fruitless when the nation means business. The  other important alteration refers to the limitation of the number of  delegates. I believe that the advantages of such a limitation are  obvious. We are fast reaching a time when without any such limitation  the Congress will become an unwieldy body. It is difficult even to have  an unlimited number of visitors; it is impossible to transact national  business if we have an unlimited number of delegates.    The next important alteration is about the election of the members of  the All-India Congress Committee, making that committee practically the  Subjects Committee, and the redistribution of India for the purposes of  the Congress on a"]]]
