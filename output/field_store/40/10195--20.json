This gravel consisted of  sand and pebbles of quartz about the size of a pea. Our female guide, who  appeared to be about thirty years of age, remembered the visit of the  white men; and she this day showed me the spot where Mr. Oxley's tent  stood, and the root with some remains of the branches of a tree near it  which had been burnt down very recently, and on which she said some marks  were cut.    SLOW GROWTH OF TREES.    Several trees around had been sawn and on two, about thirty yards west  from the burnt stump, were the letters WW and IW 1817. The tree bearing  the last letters was a goborro or dwarf box, and had been killed two  years before by the natives stripping off a sheet of bark; but from the  growth of the solid wood around the carved part it appeared that this  tree had increased in diameter about an inch and a half in seventeen  years; the whole diameter, including the bark, being sixteen inches. We  immediately dug around the burnt stump in search of the bottle deposited  there by Mr. Oxley, but without success. The gins said that he rode  forward some way beyond, and marked another tree at the furthest place he  reached. I accordingly went there with them, and they showed me a tree  marked on each side but, the cuttings being in the bark only, they were  almost grown out. It stood beside a small branch or outlet of the river,  which led into a hollow of polygonum. The natives also said that one of  Mr. Oxley's men was nearly drowned in trying to cross this but that they  got him out. They positively assured me that this was the farthest point  Mr. Oxley reached; and it seemed the more probable as during a flood the  deep and narrow gully extending between the river and the field of  polygonum must have then been under water, and a most discouraging  impediment to the traveller. I place this spot in latitude 33 degrees 45  minutes 10 seconds South; longitude 144 degrees 56 minutes East. The  natives further informed me that three white men on horseback who had  canoes (boats) on the Murrumbidgee had visited this part of the Lachlan  since, and that after crossing it and going a little way beyond, they had  returned.    A TRIBE OF NATIVES COME TO US.    In the evening, while a heavy shower fell, the natives who had come with  me gave the alarm that a powerful tribe was advancing with scouts ahead,  as when they mean mischief. We were immediately under arms and soon saw a  small tribe consisting chiefly of old men, women, and children,  approaching our party. They sat down very quietly near us, lighting their  fire and making huts without saying a word; and on Piper going to them we  soon came to a good understanding.    MR. OXLEY'S BOTTLE.    From them we learnt that, after the tree at Oxley's camp had been burnt  down, a bottle had been found by a child who broke it, and that it  contained a letter. This information saved us all further search,  although it had been my intention to halt next day and send back six men  to dig for the bottle; I had purposed also to have promised a full one in  exchange for it, if they had found it.    May 6.    The chief of the new tribe had ordered a man to accompany us as guide,  but after going a mile or two he fell back and left us; and we were thus  compelled again to depend on the information of the gin for the situation  of water. I regretted exceedingly the defection of this envoy, by whose  means I hoped to have been passed from tribe to tribe.    The grass had improved very much on the banks of the Lachlan. A vast  plain of very firm surface extended southward, but not a tree was visible  upon it, while on our side the country was wooded in long stripes of  trees.    WALJEERS LAKE.    About seven miles from the camp the river, the general course of which  had been for several days about south-west, turned southward; and we came  in sight of Waljeers. The natives had for some days told us of Waljeers,  which proved to be the bed of a lake nearly circular and about four miles  in circumference. It was perfectly dry, but in wet seasons it must be a  fine sheet of water. As we approached its banks I observed that the  surface, which was somewhat elevated above the country nearer the river,  consisted of firm red soil with large bushes of atriplex,  mesembryanthemum, and other shrubs peculiar to that kind of surface,  which is so common on the left bank of the Bogan.    TRIGONELLA SUAVISSIMA.    The whole expanse of the lake was at this time covered with the richest  verdure and the perfumed gale which:    fanned the cheek and raised the hair,  Like a meadow breeze in spring,    heightened the charm of a scene so novel to us. I soon discovered that  this fragrance proceeded from the plant resembling clover which we found  so excellent as a vegetable during the former journey.* A young crop of  it grew in scanty patches near the shores of the lake, and I recognised  it with delight, as it seems the most interesting of Australian plants.  The natives here called it Calomba and told us that they eat it. Barney  said it grew abundantly at Murroagin after rain. It seems to spring up  only on the richest of alluvial deposits, in the beds of lagoons during  the limited interval between the recession of the water and the  desiccation of the soil under a warm sun.** Exactly resembling new mown  hay in the perfume which it gives out even when in the freshest state of  verdure, it was indeed sweet to sense and lovely to the eye in the heart  of a desert country. When at sea off Cape Leeuwin in September 1827,  after a three months' voyage and before we made the land, I was sensible  of a perfume from the shore which this plant recalled to my recollection.    (*Footnote. Trigonella suavissima, Volume 1.)    (**Footnote. On leaving Sydney for this expedition I placed in charge of  Mr. McLeay, colonial secretary, the first specimen of this plant produced  by cultivation. It grew luxuriantly in a flower-pot from seeds brought  from the Darling where it was discovered. Volume 1.)    In the bed of Waljeers we again found the Agristis virginica of  Linnaeus,* and an Echinochloa allied to E. crusgalli, two kinds of very  rich grass; but most of the verdure in the middle of the bed consisted of  a dwarf species of Psoralea which grew but thinly.** Hibiscus was also  springing very generally. The bed of this lake had been full of the  freshwater mussel; and under a canoe (which I took away in the carts)  were several large crayfish dead in their holes. Dry and parched as the  bed of the lake then was, the natives found nevertheless live freshwater  mussels by digging to a substratum of sand. I understood that they also  find this shell alive in the same manner, in the dry bed of the Lachlan.    (*Footnote. See Volume 1.)    (**Footnote. The third species of Psoralea before referred to (March  19th). P. cinerea, Lindley manuscripts; herbacea, incana, foliis pinnatim  trifoliolatis, foliolis dentatis punctatis ovatis acutis intermedio basi  cuneato, racemo pedunculato denso multifloro foliis triplo longiore,  bracteis minimis ovatis acuminatis, calycibus pellucide pauci-punctatis,  caule ramisque strictis.)    This lake was surrounded by yarra trees similar to those on the banks of  the river; and within them was a narrow belt of slender reeds but no  bulrushes. On the western shore lay a small beach of sand. The banks were  in height about eight feet above the ordinary water-line of the lake; and  the greatest depth in the centre was about sixteen feet below that line.  The yarra trees distinguishing the margin continued to form a dense belt  extending westward from the northern shore; and the natives informed me  that these trees surrounded a much smaller lake named Boyonga which lay,  as they pointed, immediately to the northward of it.    On ascending the bank overlooking the western shore of Waljeers we found  that it also consisted of firm red soil with high bushes of atriplex,  etc., as on the opposite side. We next traversed a plain of the same  elevation but of firmer texture than any we had seen nearer the Lachlan.  The grass upon it was also good and abundant; and we found ourselves upon  the whole in a better sort of country than we had seen for weeks; but  still water was, if possible, scarcer than ever. After travelling about  seven miles beyond Waljeers we regained the banks of the Lachlan; but I  pursued its channel about two miles without finding a drop, and we  encamped finally without having any for the animals after travelling  upwards of sixteen miles.    BARNEY IN DISGRACE.    May 7.    The grass was green and abundant and dew had fallen upon it during the  night; our cattle therefore had not fared as badly as on other nights of  privation; and were able to proceed. After we had left our former  encampment and the envoy had deserted us it occurred to me that our  friend Barney, who had accompanied us a long way, appeared rather too  anxious to have a gin. He had been busy, as I subsequently learnt, in  raising a hue and cry on the approach of the tribe we last met, in hopes  that we might quarrel with them, and that he might get one, in  consequence, on easy terms. I recollected that he reminded me of his  wants in this respect at the very moment these people were approaching. I  foresaw the mischief likely to arise from this readiness of Barney to  insult native tribes while under the wing of our party; and the  unfavourable impression he was likely to make on them respecting us if he  were allowed to covet their gins. I therefore blamed him for causing the  return of the guide who had been sent with us by that tribe, placed him  in irons for the night and, much as I liked the poor fellow as an  intelligent native, I thought it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13053"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art, and Science — Volume 1, No. (#17)"],[1,"Europe.    Our German friend makes it his practice, whether he is treating of  the geology of the earth, or of the manufacture of Swedish bodkins,  to begin at the very beginning. He therefore commences the history  of lace-making, which, he says, is, like embroidery, an art of very  ancient origin, lost, like a multitude of other origins, \"in the  darkness of by-gone ages.\" It may, with truth, be said that it is  the national occupation of the women of the Low Countries, and one to  which they have steadily adhered from very remote times. During the  long civil and foreign wars waged by the people of the Netherlands,  while subject to Spanish dominion, other branches of Belgic industry  either dwindled to decay, or were transplanted to foreign countries;  but lace-making remained faithful to the land which had fostered and  brought it to perfection, though it received tempting offers from  abroad, and had to struggle with many difficulties at home. This Mr.  Kohl explains by the fact that lace-making is a branch of industry  chiefly confined to female hands, and, as women are less disposed  to travel than men, all arts and handicrafts exclusively pursued by  women, have a local and enduring character.    Notwithstanding the overwhelming supply of imitations which modern  ingenuity has created, _real Brussels lace_ has maintained its value,  like the precious metals and the precious stones. In the patterns of  the best bone lace, the changeful influence of fashion is less marked  than in most other branches of industry; indeed, she has adhered with  wonderful pertinacity to the quaint old patterns of former times.  These are copied and reproduced with that scrupulous uniformity which  characterizes the figures in the Persian and Indian shawls. Frequent  experiments have been tried to improve these old patterns, by  the introduction of slight and tasteful modifications, but these  innovations have not succeeded, and a very skillful and experienced  lace-worker assured Mr. Kohl, that the antiquated designs, with all  their formality, are preferred to those in which the most elegant  changes have been effected.    Each of the lace-making towns of Belgium excels in the production of  one particular description of lace: in other words, each has what  is technically called its own _point_. The French word _point_, in  the ordinary language of needlework, signifies _stitch_; but in the  terminology of lace-making, the word is sometimes used to designate  the pattern of the lace, and sometimes the ground of the lace itself.  Hence the terms _point de Bruxelles, point de Malines, point de  Valenciennes_, &c. In England we distinguish by the name Point, a  peculiarly rich and curiously wrought lace formerly very fashionable,  but now scarcely ever worn except in Court costume. In this sort of  lace the pattern is, we believe, worked with the needle, after the  ground has been made with the bobbins. In each town there prevail  certain modes of working, and certain patterns which have been  transmitted from mother to daughter successively, for several  generations. Many of the lace-workers live and die in the same houses  in which they were born, and most of them understand and practice only  the stitches which their mothers and grandmothers worked before them.  The consequence has been, that certain points have become unchangeably  fixed in particular towns or districts. Fashion has assigned to  each its particular place and purpose; for example:--the _point de  Malines_ (Mechlin lace) is used chiefly for trimming night-dresses,  pillow-cases, coverlets, &c.; the _point de Valenciennes_  (Valenciennes lace) is employed for ordinary wear or neglige; but the  more rich and costly _point de Bruxelles_ (Brussels lace) is reserved  for bridal and ball dresses, and for the robes of queens and courtly  ladies.    As the different sorts of lace, from the narrowest and plainest to the  broadest and richest, are innumerable; so the division of labor among  the lace-workers is infinite. In the towns of Belgium there are as  many different kinds of lace-workers as there are varieties of spiders  in Nature. It is not, therefore, surprising that in the several  departments of this branch of industry there are as many technical  terms and phrases as would make up a small dictionary. In their  origin, these expressions were all Flemish; but French being the  language now spoken in Belgium, they have been translated into French,  and the designations applied to some of the principal classifications  of the work-women. Those who make only the ground, are called  _Drocheleuses_. The design or pattern, which adorns this ground, is  distinguished by the general term \"the Flowers;\" though it would  be difficult to guess what flowers are intended to be portrayed by  the fantastic arabesque of these lace-patterns. In Brussels the  ornaments or flowers are made separately, and afterward worked into  the lace-ground; in other places the ground and the patterns are  worked conjointly. The _Platteuses_ are those who work the flowers  separately; and the _Faiseuses de point a l'aiguille_ work the figures  and the ground together. The _Striquese_ is the worker who attaches  the flowers to the ground. The _Faneuse_ works her figures by piercing  holes or cutting out pieces of the ground.    The spinning of the fine thread used for lace-making in the  Netherlands, is an operation demanding so high a degree of minute care  and vigilant attention, that it is impossible it can ever be taken  from human hands by machinery. None but Belgian fingers are skilled  in this art. The very finest sort of this thread is made in Brussels,  in damp underground cellars; for it is so extremely delicate, that  it is liable to break by contact with the dry air above ground;  and it is obtained in good condition only, when made and kept in a  humid subterraneous atmosphere. There are numbers of old Belgian  thread-makers who, like spiders, have passed the best part of their  lives spinning in cellars. This sort of occupation naturally has an  injurious effect on the health, and, therefore, to induce people to  follow it, they are highly paid.    To form an accurate idea of this operation, it is necessary to see  a Brabant Thread-spinner at her work. She carefully examines every  thread, watching it closely as she draws it off the distaff; and that  she may see it the more distinctly, a piece of dark blue paper is used  as a background for the flax. Whenever the spinner notices the least  unevenness, she stops the evolution of her wheel, breaks off the  faulty piece of flax, and then resumes her spinning. This fine flax  being as costly as gold, the pieces thus broken off are carefully  laid aside to be used in other ways. All this could never be done by  machinery. It is different in the spinning of cotton, silk, or wool,  in which the original threads are almost all of uniform thickness. The  invention of the English flax-spinning machine, therefore, can never  supersede the work of the Belgian fine thread spinners, any more  than the bobbinnet machine can rival the fingers of the Brussels  lace-makers, or render their delicate work superfluous.    The prices current of the Brabant spinners usually include a list of  various sorts of thread suited to lace-making, varying from 60 francs  to 1800 francs per pound. Instances have occurred, in which as much as  10,000 francs have been paid for a pound of this fine yarn. So high a  price has never been attained by the best spun silk; though a pound of  silk, in its raw condition, is incomparably more valuable than a pound  of flax. In like manner, a pound of iron may, by dint of human labor  and ingenuity, be rendered more valuable than a pound of gold.    Lace-making, in regard to the health of the operatives, has one great  advantage. It is a business which is carried on without the necessity  of assembling great numbers of workpeople in one place, or taking  women from their homes, and thereby breaking the bonds of family  union. It is, moreover, an occupation which affords those employed  in it a great degree of freedom. The spinning-wheel and lace-pillows  are easily carried from place to place, and the work may be done with  equal convenience in the house, in the garden, or at the street-door.  In every Belgian town in which lace-making is the staple business,  the eye of the traveler is continually greeted with pictures of  happy industry attended by all its train of concomitant virtues. The  costliness of the material employed in the work, viz., the fine flax  thread, fosters the observance of order and economy, which, as well  as habits of cleanliness, are firmly engrafted among the people. Much  manual dexterity, quickness of eye, and judgment, are demanded in  lace-making; and the work is a stimulator of ingenuity and taste;  so that, unlike other occupations merely manual, it tends to rouse  rather than to dull the mind. It is, moreover, unaccompanied by any  unpleasant and harassing noise; for the humming of the spinning-wheel,  and the regular tapping of the little bobbins, are sounds not in  themselves disagreeable, or sufficiently loud to disturb conversation,  or to interrupt the social song.    In Belgium, female industry presents itself under aspects alike  interesting to the painter, the poet, and the philanthropist. Here  and there may be seen a happy-looking girl, seated at an open window,  turning her spinning-wheel or working at her lace-pillow, whilst at  intervals she indulges in the relaxation of a curious gaze at the  passers-by in the street. Another young _Speldewerkster_, more  sentimentally disposed, will retire into the garden, seating herself  in an umbrageous arbor, or under a spreading tree, her eyes intent  on her work, but her thoughts apparently divided between it and  some object nearer to her heart.
