This level of  commitment and reliability of correspondents will  always be an asset to any newspaper.    I had a correspondent who happened to fly to Bombay in  the morning, but that didn't stop him from sending me a  news item over the phone. Beyond doubt, this  correspondent, despite his busy schedule in Vasco, has  been one of my most enterprising correspondents and a  crucial component in my network of correspondents.    Correspondents located in remote areas usually cover a  huge geographical area and in most cases, travel many  kilometres to either collect or send a report to the  newspaper. Yet, this rarely deters them from sending  their reports.    USEFULNESS: While rural correspondents are primarily  responsible for covering events in their localities,  they are extremely beneficial to newspapers in a number  of ways. They can be of invaluable help in the  promotion of newspaper, be it circulation, generation  of advertisements or other areas of interest to a  newspaper. In fact, some correspondents have even  started advertising agencies of their own.    SINCERITY: This ingredient distinguishes rural  correspondents who pursue journalism as an end from  those who manipulate the profession as a means to an end.    Over the years, I have learnt to respect the large  number of rural correspondents, who have been sincere  to the journalism. This is not to say that rural  correspondents are insulated from pressures while  discharging their part-time duties. On the contrary,  they are most prone to influences within their locality  and hence, their ability to withstand the gravitational  forces of politics and economics has to be appreciated.    TENACITY: Another hallmark of most rural correspondents  is the persistent determination which has been the  driving force over the years. News items on a series of  issues filed by rural correspondents have prompted  authorities to initiate action. Recently, a  correspondent persistently highlighted the illegal  felling of trees in the taluka, inviting the wrath of  timber smugglers. Ignoring numerous threats to his  life, his efforts eventually paid off when arrests were  effected, lethargic local authorities transferred and  brakes applied on the illegal activities in the area.    My association with the Herald is yet to complete two  years, but I am glad that the Herald News Bureau has  developed a team of talented, reliable, useful, sincere  and tenacious correspondents. And I am grateful to have  been involved in this process.      Chapter 9:  A year apart... journalism and leaving home    Daryl PereiraDaryl Pereira came to Goa as a lost young member of the  widespread Goan diaspora. He promptly won many friends  by his friendly ways and have-fun attitude. In turn, he  not just discovered his roots more deeply (Daryl  recently chose to have his wedding in Goa), but also  earned for himself a profession. Besides opting for  Media Studies back in the UK, he currently works for a  search-engine promotion agency (or, put in plain  language, an initiative that skews search-engine  results, to allow you to be listed first, if you can  afford to pay).    A lot has happened since my time as writer and  sub-editor for The Herald's international edition. But  a brief stint in the mid-90's has left an indelible  mark on my psyche. Having said that, the Herald for me  is largely synonymous with India, journalism and  leaving home, so discussing it in isolation isn't easy.  Also, there was no clearly defined plan -- it was  something I more or less stumbled on by chance.    It turned to be a chance encounter of which I still  feel the repercussions.    I arrived in Goa from the UK early in 1995, after  scrapping a potentially lucrative yet un-inviting  career in accountancy, originally no more than another  faceless backpacker with meagre funds hoping to enjoy  the chilled hazy life of a shack-wallah. Shame I didn't  check the weather forecast. The small matter of a  monsoon put paid to any chances of beachside employment.    Offices filled with ledgers piled to the roofs were  enough to put me off venturing into the world of Indian  accountancy and, not wanting to follow the aimless road  back home, I desperately cast the net out wide. An  answer to an advert for a 'Person Required for English  Publication' -- one of the more ambiguous ads to grace  the career opportunity pages -- led to an interview and  my first trip to the Herald offices.    Finding the office more energetic and boisterous than  previous working environments I had experienced, a  barrage of writing tests and interviews left me feeling  like I had been through a whirlwind. The whirlwind  moved quickly. That very same day I found out I was the  new sub-editor for the Herald International Review, a  paper intended to serve the Goan diaspora.    Well, what this role meant in reality was that I would  read the articles awaiting publication, picking up the  odd grammatical error, but more importantly I was the  lowest common denominator litmus test -- if the pages  didn't stand up to my paltry knowledge of the Goan  political system then (the argument goes) it would not  be understood by Goans in the furthest-flung corners of  the globe.    Day in day out, I would take the long dusty climb up to  the top floor -- at the time we were sharing office  space with accounts. Not quite the close separation of  duty to which I'd become accustomed. And although their  elaborate entries in ledgers never became any less  cryptic, it did give me the opportunity to mingle with  those outside the editorial department.    During the early weeks of my tenure in May, the heat  soared. Then early in June the rains broke -- with a  fanfare of grumbles from most of the populace for the  three-day delay. Funny for me, as in the North European  climes to which I was accustomed, rain pretty much  randomly came and went. The ferocity of the storms also  came as a shock. Days heavily punctuated with storms.  The power cuts that ensued, hobbling our much needed  computers, led to a greedy lunge for the last drips of  juice out of the backup generator in order to crunch  out a few extra words. Once that dried up, we would  have little more to do than meditatively stare at the elements.    In the English political system, the summer is the  silly system. It's the time for stories of twins joined  at birth and how a routine trip to the hospital to have  a wart removed leads to three-years incarceration.  Falling over the same months, the monsoon season in Goa  seems to have a similar effect. The supply of news is  low, but the column-inches keep up their incessant  demand. Ministers with long-shot pleas for 'raindrop  tourism' (to wake up a beachside industry all but dried  up over the period) is enough to make front page news.    Perhaps that is the reason that it was felt pushing me  out into the midst of Goa on the hunt for fresh stories  couldn't do too much harm. It was only later that I saw  this as one of the perks of working in a small team  (there were only three full-timers bringing out a  24-page tabloid weekly edition). Feeling like a young  bird pushed from it's nest way before time I was forced  out, between showers, onto the streets of Panjim, to  interact with the local populace. Quite early on, I was  struck by the stony faces of small-league civil  servants. The UK broadcast journalist Jeremy Paxman  claims the relationship between a politician and a journalist   is like that between \"a dog and a lamp post\". I could relate.    However, a useful mentor, T helped me through my first  real interview. This got off to a bad start when, after  biking it through sheets of rain, we knocked on the  door -- only to be greeted with the merest slither of a  gap with a voice behind it. I could almost smell the  fear as the middle-aged housewife exclaimed 'naka,  naka', as T tried to negotiate us into the flat. Her  son, a bright student looking for entrance into  engineering college, had come up against a wall of  resistance -- communal motivations were suspected.    Eventually, after agreeing to keep the article as vague  as possible, she succumbed and we entered the flat.  Once in, hot chai and samosas were thrust upon us as we  sat on the main (and only) sofa in a clean and basic  flat. Seems like hospitality begins at the sacred  entrance -- perhaps the reason why were kept out for so  long. Antagonism and Indian snacks don't sit that  comfortably together.    Well, for my first time, all seems to be going well.  However, looking down as I rapidly scribble, I start to  notice a puddle emerging around me on the stone floor.  Early on in the rains and I haven't yet made the  connection between downpours and sandals. The puddle  grows and I feel like my shoes are slowly turning into  the source of the Mandovi. I have little option other  than to come clean. What followed was an episode with  me apologising, receiving a maternal smile and a towel  and a level of empathy I'm not sure could have been  reached any other way. As it happened, the article  created few ripples and the power of the press didn't  have quite the force the lady had anticipated.    My confidence grew, and, as the rainy season drew on, I  ventured out more and more.    Towards the end of August, the rains finally showed  signs of letting up. However there was talk in the  market place -- the fish didn't return. At street level  housewives were struggling to find the plump shimmering  mackerals with which they normally populated their  spicy yellow curries. In the areas surrounding the big  resorts, blame was laid on the proliferation of hotels  with their ever-growing need for the freshest produce.

Be wife, be mother; but a girl no more.          Thus interchanging whispered talk the pair,      Their faces all aglow, long lingered there.      At length the hour arrived when they must part.      With downcast eyes, but sunshine in her heart,      She went to tend her flock; while Daphnis ran      Back to his herded bulls, a happy man.          IDYLL XXVIII.      The Distaff.        Distaff, blithely whirling distaff, azure-eyed Athena's gift      To the sex the aim and object of whose lives is household thrift,      Seek with me the gorgeous city raised by Neilus, where a plain      Roof of pale-green rush o'er-arches Aphrodite's hallowed fane.      Thither ask I Zeus to waft me, fain to see my old friend's face,      Nicias, o'er whose birth presided every passion-breathing Grace;      Fain to meet his answering welcome; and anon deposit thee      In his lady's hands, thou marvel of laborious ivory.      Many a manly robe ye'll fashion, much translucent maiden's gear;      Nay, should e'er the fleecy mothers twice within the selfsame year      Yield their wool in yonder pasture, Theugenis of the dainty feet      Would perform the double labour: matron's cares to her are sweet.      To an idler or a trifler I had verily been loth      To resign thee, O my distaff, for the same land bred us both:      In the land Corinthian Archias built aforetime, thou hadst birth,      In our island's core and marrow, whence have sprung the kings of earth:      To the home I now transfer thee of a man who knows full well      Every craft whereby men's bodies dire diseases may repel:      There to live in sweet Miletus. Lady of the Distaff she      Shall be named, and oft reminded of her poet-friend by thee:      Men shall look on thee and murmur to each other, 'Lo! how small      Was the gift, and yet how precious! Friendship's gifts are priceless          all.'          IDYLL XXIX.      Loves.        'Sincerity comes with the wine-cup,' my dear:      Then now o'er our wine-cups let us be sincere.      My soul's treasured secret to you I'll impart;      It is this; that I never won fairly your heart.      One half of my life, I am conscious, has flown;      The residue lives on your image alone.      You are kind, and I dream I'm in paradise then;      You are angry, and lo! all is darkness again.      It is right to torment one who loves you? Obey      Your elder; 'twere best; and you'll thank me one day.      Settle down in one nest on one tree (taking care      That no cruel reptile can clamber up there);      As it is with your lovers you're fairly perplext;      One day you choose one bough, another the next.      Whoe'er at all struck by your graces appears,      Is more to you straight than the comrade of years;      While he's like the friend of a day put aside;      For the breath of your nostrils, I think, is your pride.      Form a friendship, for life, with some likely young lad;      So doing, in honour your name shall be had.      Nor would Love use you hardly; though lightly can he      Bind strong men in chains, and has wrought upon me      Till the steel is as wax--but I'm longing to press      That exquisite mouth with a clinging caress.          No? Reflect that you're older each year than the last;      That we all must grow gray, and the wrinkles come fast.      Reflect, ere you spurn me, that youth at his sides      Wears wings; and once gone, all pursuit he derides:      Nor are men over keen to catch charms as they fly.      Think of this and be gentle, be loving as I:      When your years are maturer, we two shall be then      The pair in the Iliad over again.      But if you consign all my words to the wind      And say, 'Why annoy me? you're not to my mind,'      I--who lately in quest of the Gold Fruit had sped      For your sake, or of Cerberus guard of the dead--      Though you called me, would ne'er stir a foot from my door,      For my love and my sorrow thenceforth will be o'er.          IDYLL XXX.      The Death of Adonis.        Cythera saw Adonis        And knew that he was dead;      She marked the brow, all grisly now,        The cheek no longer red;      And \"Bring the boar before me\"        Unto her Loves she said.        Forthwith her winged attendants        Ranged all the woodland o'er,      And found and bound in fetters        Threefold the grisly boar:      One dragged him at a rope's end        E'en as a vanquished foe;      One went behind and drave him        And smote him with his bow:      On paced the creature feebly;        He feared Cythera so.        To him said Aphrodite:        \"So, worst of beasts, 'twas you      Who rent that thigh asunder,        Who him that loved me slew?\"      And thus the beast made answer:        \"Cythera, hear me swear      By thee, by him that loved thee,        And by these bonds I wear,      And them before whose hounds I ran--      I meant no mischief to the man        Who seemed to thee so fair.        \"As on a carven statue        Men gaze, I gazed on him;      I seemed on fire with mad desire        To kiss that offered limb:      My ruin, Aphrodite,        Thus followed from my whim.        \"Now therefore take and punish        And fairly cut away      These all unruly tusks of mine;        For to what end serve they?      And if thine indignation        Be not content with this,      Cut off the mouth that ventured        To offer him a kiss\"--        But Aphrodite pitied        And bade them loose his chain.      The boar from that day forward        Still followed in her train;      Nor ever to the wildwood        Attempted to return,      But in the focus of Desire        Preferred to burn and burn.          IDYLL XXXI.      Loves.        Ah for this the most accursed, unendurable of ills!      Nigh two months a fevered fancy for a maid my bosom fills.      Fair she is, as other damsels: but for what the simplest swain      Claims from the demurest maiden, I must sue and sue in vain.      Yet doth now this thing of evil my longsuffering heart beguile,      Though the utmost she vouchsafes me is the shadow of a smile:      And I soon shall know no respite, have no solace e'en in sleep.      Yesterday I watched her pass me, and from down-dropt eyelids peep      At the face she dared not gaze on--every moment blushing more--      And my love took hold upon me as it never took before.      Home I went a wounded creature, with a gnawing at my heart;      And unto the soul within me did my bitterness impart.          \"Soul, why deal with me in this wise? Shall thy folly know no bound?      Canst thou look upon these temples, with their locks of silver crowned,      And still deem thee young and shapely? Nay, my soul, let us be sage;      Act as they that have already sipped the wisdom-cup of age.      Men have loved and have forgotten. Happiest of all is he      To the lover's woes a stranger, from the lover's fetters free:      Lightly his existence passes, as a wild-deer fleeting fast:      Tamed, it may be, he shall voyage in a maiden's wake at last:      Still to-day 'tis his to revel with his mates in boyhood's flowers.      As to thee, thy brain and marrow passion evermore devours,      Prey to memories that haunt thee e'en in visions of the night;      And a year shall scarcely pluck thee from thy miserable plight.\"          Such and divers such reproaches did I heap upon my soul.      And my soul in turn made answer:--\"Whoso deems he can control      Wily love, the same shall lightly gaze upon the stars of heaven      And declare by what their number overpasses seven times seven.      Will I, nill I, I may never from my neck his yoke unloose.      So, my friend, a god hath willed it: he whose plots could outwit Zeus,      And the queen whose home is"]]]
