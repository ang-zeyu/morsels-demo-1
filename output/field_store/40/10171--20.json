As soon as they commanded their spears and headaxes their invisible  helpers flew and they went to Dangdangayan of Naglitnan. \"Oh, sir,  you are so happy, who are in bed in the house. The people who live in  Gonigonan have nearly killed your sister, because she went to fight  against them,\" said the helpers. After that he went to bathe and wash  his hair. \"Ala, you three girls take the rice straw and wash my hair,\"  he said, and the three girls washed his hair. After that he finished  to wash and he went up to the town. As soon as they arrived in the  town the three girls combed his hair. When they finished to comb  his hair, \"Now, you put little golden beads on each of my hairs,\"  he said. As soon as they put all the gold in his hair he took his  spear and headaxe and he went.    Lingiwan of Nagtangpan was in bed in his house. \"Sir, you are so happy  in your bed in your house, your sister went to fight and the enemies  have nearly killed her,\" said the invisible spirit helpers. \"Mother  _alan_ I ask you if I have a sister? I never have seen her.\" \"What  can you do? I picked you up where you had fallen when your father  was jealous of your mother,\" [167] she said. After that he hurried  to start and he went.    When Dangdangayan of Naglitnan was in the road, he sat down on a  high stone where the two women had set before. How terrible it is  that those women who never go out of the house have gone to war, for  here is where they exchanged their weapons. While he was sitting,  \"Good morning, my friend,\" said Lingiwan of Nagtangpan. \"Where are you  going?\" said the man who sat on the high stone. \"I am going anywhere,\"  he answered, and they talked. \"We are going to tell our names, because  it is bad for us when we do not know each others names.\" They cut  and chewed the betel-nut. As soon as they chewed they found that  they were relatives. \"My name is Lingiwan of Nagtangpan.\" \"My name  is Dangdangayan of Naglitnan. Let us go together when we go to  fight.\" After that they went. When they truly arrived they looked  into the town, they saw the two women who looked like flames of fire,  because of their beauty. \"How terrible that those ladies who always  stay in the house have gone to war,\" they said. After that they went to  them, and the people whom they killed were so many that the pig troughs  floated in their blood. So they went to them. When the women saw them  they said, \"How terrible are those two rich men who have power.\" After  that, \"Oh, ladies how were you born,\" they said. \"Why are you here  you ask? Ginambo came to fight against us, that is why we are here  in the town of Gonigonan.\" So Dangdangayan went in front of them,  and he scooped them up with his headaxe and put them inside of his  belt. [168] After that the two men fought against the enemies. \"Please  leave someone to bear children,\" said Ginambo of Gonigonan. \"If that  is what you ask we will kill you last,\" they said and she begged mercy.    \"Now we will go to Nagtinawan which is the town of Ginawan, with whom  Aponigawani agreed to fight this month.\" After that, \"You plunder  and heads go before us to Kadalayapan, when you arrive at the gate  you divide equally and part of you go to Kaodanan.\" So they went to  Nagtinawan. When they arrived in Nagtinawan, \"You Ginawan of this town  now the agreed month is here.\" \"How are you Ginawan? We told you not  to go before and you went; now we will all be killed,\" said the people  who lived in the same town. \"Now we seek vengeance.\" They looked as if  they cut down banana trees when they cut down their enemies. \"Please  spare me, and if you wish marry me,\" said Ginawan. \"If that is what  you say we will kill you last,\" but they did not kill her.    After that they went home and sent all the heads before them and also  the plunder. After that they arrived in Kaodanan. \"Good afternoon,  Uncle,\" said Dangdangayan to old man Pagbokasan. \"Come up the ladder,\"  he said. \"You go and cook so that these boys may eat,\" he said. After  that, \"You go and get one jar of _basi_ which you used to like when  you were young,\" said his wife Ebang. As soon as she said this they  went and they drank, and Pagbokasan said to them. \"This is reserved  for Aponibolinayen to drink when she returns from fighting.\"    When the old woman had finished cooking, she took the rice from  the jar and put it on the woven basket, and she took the meat  from the jar and put it in the coconut shells, and so they ate. As  soon as they finished to eat, \"Now we are not going to stay long,  because we must go home,\" they said. So Dangdangayan dropped down the  women who never go out of the house. \"Why Aponibolinayen is here and  Lingiwan also,\" they said. Dingowan of Nagtangpan took Aponibolinayen  and put her inside of a big jar; then they went to Kadalayapan,  because they went to take Aponigawani. When they arrived they said,  \"Good afternoon Uncle,\" to the old man Pagatipanan. \"Good morning,\"  he answered, and he was glad. \"Come up,\" he said. When they went up  the stairs they were given _basi_. While they were drinking they let  Aponigawani fall in front of them, and they were all glad, because  Aponigawani was there. \"How fine that Aponigawani is here; we feared  that she was lost,\" said the old man and woman. \"Ala, boys if you go  home now, return soon for we are going to chew betel nut.\"    As soon as they went _Lakay_ [169] Pagatipanan and his wife built  _balaua_, and they called one woman medium [170] to begin their  _balaua_. As soon as they built their _balaua_ they sent someone  to go and secure betel-nuts which were covered with gold. Not  long after the betel-nuts which were covered with gold arrived and  the old woman Langa-an oiled them, and she used magic so that the  betel-nuts went to invite all their relatives, who lived in other  towns, to attend _balaua_ with them. She told the betel-nuts that  if any did not wish to attend _balaua_ with them, to grow on their  knees. As soon as she commanded them they went, and the betel-nut  which went to Kaodanan arrived, \"Good morning,\" it said to the old  man, Pagbokasan who was lying in the _balaua_. He looked up and said,  \"Who was that,\" and he saw it was a betel-nut, covered with gold and  oiled, and the betel-nut said, \"I come to bid you attend the _balaua_  of Pagatipanan of Kadalayapan, because Aponigawani has returned from  fighting. So they celebrate.\" Pagbokasan sat up. After that he went  down out of the _balaua_ and the told people to wash their hair and  clothes and to bathe so as to attend the _balaua_ of Pagatipanan of  Kadalayapan. So the people who lived with them all went to the river  and washed their clothes and hair, and took a bath. As soon as they  finished they went home, and they started to go to Kadalayapan. Old  man Pagbokasan took Aponibolinayen from the jar, and put her inside  of his belt, so they went.    As soon as they arrived there the families who made the _balaua_  went to meet them at the gate of the town and made _alawig_ [171]  for them. After that they stopped dancing, and they talked to each  other, and the two young men who met Aponibolinayen and Aponigawani  were with them, because they arrived at the same time. So the old man  Pagatipanan said, \"Ala, cousin Pagbokasan now we are going to chew  betel-nut to see if those two young men who took home Aponigawani  are our relatives,\" and old man Pagbokasan agreed. So they cut the  betel-nut which was covered with gold for them to chew and as soon  as they cut the nut they all chewed, and they all spat. The spittle  of Lingiwan went to the spittle of Pagatipanan, and the spittle of  Aponigawani, went there also. The spittle of Dangdangayan went to  the spittle of Pagbokasan and that of Aponibolinayen also, and thus  they found out that they were relatives. Pagbokasan was surprised,  for he did not know that he had a son, and Ebang took her son, and she  carried him as if he was a baby. And Lingiwan was glad, because he had  met his sister during the fight and Langa-an carried him as if a baby.    When they had learned that the boys who had carried the girls home were  their sons they all went back to town, and their people who had been  invited were there. As soon as they sat down Iwaginan commanded someone  to play the _gansas_ and he took the two skirts and made everyone  dance. His wife Gintoban who was a big woman, who used the big jars  like agate beads on her head and about her neck, said to Iwaginan,  \"Why don't you, my husband, bid me dance? I have been waiting for a  very long time.\" Iwaginan said, \"Gintoban do not say that or I shall  be ashamed before the people. Wait until I am ready for you.\" As soon  as Aponibolinayen and Lingiwan finished dancing Iwaginan took the  skirts from them and he gave one to Gintoban and the other to Ilwisan,  and so they danced. And the big jars which she had hung around her  neck made a noise and the earth shook when she moved her body. As  soon as they finished dancing the people who went to attend _Balaua_  with them said, \"Now we going to put the heads around the town and  then go for it is nearly one month now and our families are lonesome  for us.\" So they went to put the heads on the sticks around the town.    At that time the two _alan_ who had picked up Lingiwan and Dangdangayan  arrived. They did not wish to attend _Balaua_, but the betel-nut  had grown on their heads and they had arrived very late. As soon as  Lingiwan and Dangdangayan saw them they took them back to the town. As  soon as Pagatipanan knew that they were the _alan_ who took care of  the boys he summoned the people around the town. They danced for one  month. After that Langa-an and Ebang went to talk with the two _alan_,  and said to them, \"We are surprised for we did not feel our sons come  out.\" The _alan_ said, \"Lingiwan I picked up by the side of the road  while you were walking, that is why you did not feel him; he was a  little bloody when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12561"],[0,"A Visit to the Holy Land, Egypt, and Italy (#17)"],[1,"from the bows, before our ship was  besieged by a number of small boats, with more noise and bustle than  even at Constantinople.  The half-naked and excitable Arabs or  Fellahs are so ready with offers of service, that it is difficult to  keep them off.  It almost becomes necessary to threaten these poor  people with a stick, as they obstinately refuse to take a gentler  hint.  As the water is here very shallow, so that even the little  boats cannot come quite close to shore, some others of these brown  forms immediately approached, seized us by the arms, took us upon  their backs amidst continual shouting and quarrelling, and carried  us triumphantly to land.    Before the stranger puts himself into the hands of men of this kind,  such as captains of small craft, donkey-drivers, porters, etc., he  will find it a very wise precaution to settle the price he is to pay  for their services.  I generally spoke to the captain, or to some  old stager among the passengers, on this subject.  Even when I gave  these people double their usual price, they were not contented, but  demanded an additional backsheesh (gratuity).  It is therefore  advisable to make the first offer very small, and to retain  something for the backsheesh.  At length I safely reached the house  of Herr Battista (the only inn in the place), and was rejoicing in  the prospect of rest and refreshment, when the dismal cry of \"no  room\" was raised.  I was thus placed in a deplorable position.  There was no second inn, no convent, no place of any kind, where I,  poor desolate creature that I was, could find shelter.  This  circumstance worked so much on the host's feelings, that he  introduced me to his wife, and promised to procure me a private  lodging.    I had now certainly a roof above my head, but yet I could get no  rest, nor even command a corner where I might change my dress.  I  sat with my hostess from eleven in the morning until five in the  afternoon, and a miserably long time it appeared.  I could not read,  write, or even talk, for neither my hostess nor her children knew  any language but Arabic.  I had, however, time to notice what was  going on around me, and observed that these children were much more  lively than those in Constantinople, for here they were continually  chattering and running about.  According to the custom of the  country, the wife does nothing but play with the children or gossip  with the neighbours, while her husband attends to kitchen and  cellar, makes all the requisite purchases, and besides attending to  the guests, even lays the tablecloth for his wife and children.  He  told me that in a week at furthest, his wife would go with the  children to a convent on the Lebanon, to remain there during the hot  season of the year.  What a difference between an Oriental and a  European woman!    I still found the heat at sea far from unendurable; a soft wind  continually wafted its cooling influence towards us, and an awning  had been spread out to shelter us from the rays of the sun.  But  what a contrast when we come to land!  As I sat in the room here the  perspiration dropped continually from my brow, and now I began to  understand what is meant by being in the tropics.  I could scarcely  await the hour when I should be shewn to a room to change my  clothes; but to-day I was not to have an opportunity of doing so,  for at five o'clock a messenger came from Mr. Bartlett with the  welcome intelligence that we could continue our journey, as nothing  was to be feared from the Druses and Maronites, and the plague only  reigned in isolated places through which it was not necessary that  we should pass.  He had already engaged a servant who would act as  cook and dragoman (interpreter); provisions and cooking utensils had  also been bought, and places were engaged on an Arab craft.  Nothing, therefore, remained for me to do but to be on the sea-shore  by six o'clock, where his servant would be waiting for me.  I was  much rejoiced on hearing this good news:  I forgot that I required  rest and a change of clothes, packed up my bundle, and hurried to  the beach.  Of the town I only saw a few streets, where there was a  great bustle.  I also noticed many swarthy Arabs and Bedouins, who  wore nothing but a shirt.  I did not feel particularly anxious to  see Beyrout and its vicinity, as I intended to return soon and visit  any part I could not examine now.    Before sunset we had already embarked on board the craft that was to  carry us to the long-wished-for, the sacred coast of Joppa.  Every  thing was in readiness, and we lacked only the one thing  indispensable--a breeze.    No steamers sail between Joppa and Beyrout; travellers must be  content with sailing vessels, deficient alike as regards cleanliness  and convenience; they are not provided with a cabin, or even with an  awning, so that the passengers remain day and night under the open  sky.  Our vessel carried a cargo of pottery, besides rice and corn  in sacks.    Midnight approached, and still we were in harbour, with not a breath  of wind to fill our sails.    Wrapping my cloak tightly round me, I lay down on the sacks, in the  absence of a mattress; but I was not yet sufficiently tired out to  be able to find rest on such an unusual couch.  So I rose again in  rather a bad humour, and looked with an evil eye on the Arabs lying  on the sacks around me, who were not \"slumbering softly,\" but  snoring lustily.  By way of forcing myself, if possible, into a  poetical train of thought, I endeavoured to concentrate my attention  on the contemplation of the beautiful landscape by moonlight; but  even this would not keep me from yawning.  My companion seemed much  in the same mood; for he had also risen from his _soft_ couch, and  was staring gloomingly straight before him.  At length, towards  three o'clock in the morning of    May 26th,    a slight breath of wind arose, we hoisted two or three sails, and  glided slowly and noiselessly towards the sea.    Mr. B. had bargained with the captain to keep as close to the shore  as possible, in order that we might see the towns as we passed.  Excepting in Caesarea, it was forbidden to cast anchor any where,  for the plague was raging at Sur (Tyre) and in several other places.    Bargains of this kind must be taken down in writing at the  consulates, and only one-half of the sum agreed should be paid in  advance; the other half must be kept in hand, to operate as a check  on the crew.  After every precaution has been taken, one can seldom  escape without some bickering and quarrelling.  On these occasions  it is always advisable at once to take high ground, and not to give  way in the most trifling particular, for this is the only method of  gaining peace and quietness.    Towards seven o'clock in the morning we sailed by the town and  fortress of Saida.  The town looks respectable enough, and contains  some spacious houses.  The fortress is separated from the town by a  small bay, across which a wooden bridge has been built.  The  fortress seems in a very dilapidated condition; many breaches are  still in the same state in which they were left after the taking of  the town by the English in 1840, and part of the wall has fallen  into the sea.  In the background we could descry some ruins on a  rock, apparently the remains of an ancient castle.    The next place we saw was Sarepta, where Elijah the prophet was fed  by the poor widow during the famine.    The Lebanon range becomes lower and lower, while its namesake, the  Anti-Lebanon, begins to rise.  It is quite as lofty as the first-  named range, which it closely resembles in form.  Both are traversed  by fields of snow, and between them stands a third colossus, Mount  Hermon.    Next came the town of Tyre or Sur, now barren and deserted; for that  mighty scourge of humanity, the plague, was raging there to a  fearful extent.  A few scattered fragments of fortifications and  numerous fallen pillars lie strewed on the shore.    And now at length I was about to see places which many have longed  to behold, but which few have reached.  With a beating heart I gazed  unceasingly towards St. Jean d'Acre, which I at length saw rising  from the waves, with Mount Carmel in the background.  Here, then,  was the holy ground on which the Redeemer walked for us fallen  creatures!  Both St. Jean d'Acre and Mount Carmel can be  distinguished a long distance off.    For a second time did a mild and calm night sink gently on the earth  without bringing me repose.  How unlucky it is that we find it so  much harder to miss comforts we have been used to enjoy, than to  acquire the habit of using comforts to which we have been  unaccustomed!  Were this not the case, how much easier would  travelling be!  As it is, it costs us many an effort ere we can look  hardships boldly in the face.  \"But patience!\" thought I to myself;  \"I shall have more to endure yet; and if I return safely, I shall be  as thoroughly case-hardened as any native.\"    Our meals and our beverage were very simple.  In the morning we had  pilau, and in the evening we had pilau; our drink was lukewarm  water, qualified with a little rum.    From Beyrout to the neighbourhood of St. Jean d'Acre, the coast and  a considerable belt of land adjoining it are sandy and barren.  Near  Acre every thing changed; we once more beheld pretty country-houses  surrounded by pomegranate and orange plantations, and a noble  aqueduct intersects the plain.  Mount Carmel, alone barren and  unfruitful, stands in striking contrast to the beauteous landscape  around; jutting boldly out towards the sea, it forms the site of a  handsome and spacious convent.    The town of St. Jean d'Acre and its fortifications were completely  destroyed during the last war (in 1840), and appear to sigh in vain  for repairs.  The houses and mosques are full of cannon-balls and  shot-holes.  Every thing stands and lies about as though the enemy  had"]]]
