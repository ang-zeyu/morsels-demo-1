'What an extraordinarily fine bird!' he went on. 'I don't think I ever  saw one just like it.'    'I should think not,' said the Phoenix, with pardonable pride. And the  gentleman jumped.    'Oh, it's been taught to speak! Some sort of parrot, perhaps?'    'I am,' said the bird, simply, 'the Head of your House, and I have come  to my temple to receive your homage. I am no parrot'--its beak curved  scornfully--'I am the one and only Phoenix, and I demand the homage of  my High Priest.'    'In the absence of our manager,' the gentleman began, exactly as though  he were addressing a valued customer--'in the absence of our manager, I  might perhaps be able--What am I saying?' He turned pale, and passed  his hand across his brow. 'My dears,' he said, 'the weather is unusually  warm for the time of year, and I don't feel quite myself. Do you know,  for a moment I really thought that that remarkable bird of yours had  spoken and said it was the Phoenix, and, what's more, that I'd believed  it.'    'So it did, sir,' said Cyril, 'and so did you.'    'It really--Allow me.'    A bell was rung. The porter appeared.    'Mackenzie,' said the gentleman, 'you see that golden bird?'    'Yes, sir.'    The other breathed a sigh of relief.    'It IS real, then?'    'Yes, sir, of course, sir. You take it in your hand, sir,' said the  porter, sympathetically, and reached out his hand to the Phoenix, who  shrank back on toes curved with agitated indignation.    'Forbear!' it cried; 'how dare you seek to lay hands on me?'    The porter saluted.    'Beg pardon, sir,' he said, 'I thought you was a bird.'    'I AM a bird--THE bird--the Phoenix.'    'Of course you are, sir,' said the porter. 'I see that the first minute,  directly I got my breath, sir.'    'That will do,' said the gentleman. 'Ask Mr Wilson and Mr Sterry to step  up here for a moment, please.'    Mr Sterry and Mr Wilson were in their turn overcome by  amazement--quickly followed by conviction. To the surprise of the  children every one in the office took the Phoenix at its word, and after  the first shock of surprise it seemed to be perfectly natural to every  one that the Phoenix should be alive, and that, passing through London,  it should call at its temple.    'We ought to have some sort of ceremony,' said the nicest  gentleman, anxiously. 'There isn't time to summon the directors and  shareholders--we might do that tomorrow, perhaps. Yes, the board-room  would be best. I shouldn't like it to feel we hadn't done everything in  our power to show our appreciation of its condescension in looking in on  us in this friendly way.'    The children could hardly believe their ears, for they had never thought  that any one but themselves would believe in the Phoenix. And yet every  one did; all the men in the office were brought in by twos and threes,  and the moment the Phoenix opened its beak it convinced the cleverest  of them, as well as those who were not so clever. Cyril wondered how the  story would look in the papers next day. He seemed to see the posters in  the streets:        PHOENIX FIRE OFFICE      THE PHOENIX AT ITS TEMPLE      MEETING TO WELCOME IT      DELIGHT OF THE MANAGER AND EVERYBODY.    'Excuse our leaving you a moment,' said the nice gentleman, and he went  away with the others; and through the half-closed door the children  could hear the sound of many boots on stairs, the hum of excited voices  explaining, suggesting, arguing, the thumpy drag of heavy furniture  being moved about.    The Phoenix strutted up and down the leather-covered table, looking over  its shoulder at its pretty back.    'You see what a convincing manner I have,' it said proudly.    And now a new gentleman came in and said, bowing low--    'Everything is prepared--we have done our best at so short a notice; the  meeting--the ceremony--will be in the board-room. Will the Honourable  Phoenix walk--it is only a few steps--or would it like to be--would it  like some sort of conveyance?'    'My Robert will bear me to the board-room, if that be the unlovely name  of my temple's inmost court,' replied the bird.    So they all followed the gentleman. There was a big table in the  board-room, but it had been pushed right up under the long windows at  one side, and chairs were arranged in rows across the room--like those  you have at schools when there is a magic lantern on 'Our Eastern  Empire', or on 'The Way We Do in the Navy'. The doors were of carved  wood, very beautiful, with a carved Phoenix above. Anthea noticed that  the chairs in the front rows were of the kind that her mother so loved  to ask the price of in old furniture shops, and never could buy, because  the price was always nearly twenty pounds each. On the mantelpiece were  some heavy bronze candlesticks and a clock, and on the top of the clock  was another image of the Phoenix.    'Remove that effigy,' said the Phoenix to the gentlemen who were there,  and it was hastily taken down. Then the Phoenix fluttered to the middle  of the mantelpiece and stood there, looking more golden than ever. Then  every one in the house and the office came in--from the cashier to the  women who cooked the clerks' dinners in the beautiful kitchen at the top  of the house. And every one bowed to the Phoenix and then sat down in a  chair.    'Gentlemen,' said the nicest gentleman, 'we have met here today--'    The Phoenix was turning its golden beak from side to side.    'I don't notice any incense,' it said, with an injured sniff. A hurried  consultation ended in plates being fetched from the kitchen. Brown  sugar, sealing-wax, and tobacco were placed on these, and something from  a square bottle was poured over it all. Then a match was applied. It was  the only incense that was handy in the Phoenix office, and it certainly  burned very briskly and smoked a great deal.    'We have met here today,' said the gentleman again, 'on an occasion  unparalleled in the annals of this office. Our respected Phoenix--'    'Head of the House,' said the Phoenix, in a hollow voice.    'I was coming to that. Our respected Phoenix, the Head of this ancient  House, has at length done us the honour to come among us. I think I may  say, gentlemen, that we are not insensible to this honour, and that we  welcome with no uncertain voice one whom we have so long desired to see  in our midst.'    Several of the younger clerks thought of saying 'Hear, hear,' but they  feared it might seem disrespectful to the bird.    'I will not take up your time,' the speaker went on, 'by recapitulating  the advantages to be derived from a proper use of our system of fire  insurance. I know, and you know, gentlemen, that our aim has ever been  to be worthy of that eminent bird whose name we bear, and who now adorns  our mantelpiece with his presence. Three cheers, gentlemen, for the  winged Head of the House!'    The cheers rose, deafening. When they had died away the Phoenix was  asked to say a few words.    It expressed in graceful phrases the pleasure it felt in finding itself  at last in its own temple.    'And,' it went on, 'You must not think me wanting in appreciation of  your very hearty and cordial reception when I ask that an ode may be  recited or a choric song sung. It is what I have always been accustomed  to.'    The four children, dumb witnesses of this wonderful scene, glanced a  little nervously across the foam of white faces above the sea of black  coats. It seemed to them that the Phoenix was really asking a little too  much.    'Time presses,' said the Phoenix, 'and the original ode of invocation is  long, as well as being Greek; and, besides, it's no use invoking me when  here I am; but is there not a song in your own tongue for a great day  such as this?'    Absently the manager began to sing, and one by one the rest joined--         'Absolute security!       No liability!       All kinds of property       insured against fire.       Terms most favourable,       Expenses reasonable,       Moderate rates for annual       Insurance.'    'That one is NOT my favourite,' interrupted the Phoenix, 'and I think  you've forgotten part of it.'    The manager hastily began another--         'O Golden Phoenix, fairest bird,       The whole great world has often heard       Of all the splendid things we do,       Great Phoenix, just to honour you.'    'That's better,' said the bird. And every one sang--         'Class one, for private dwelling-house,       For household goods and shops allows;       Provided these are built of brick       Or stone, and tiled and slated thick.'    'Try another verse,' said the Phoenix, 'further on.'    And again arose the voices of all the clerks and employees and managers  and secretaries and cooks--        'In Scotland our insurance yields       The price of burnt-up stacks in fields.'    'Skip that verse,' said the Phoenix.         'Thatched dwellings and their whole contents       We deal with--also with their rents;       Oh, glorious Phoenix, look and see       That these are dealt with in class three.         'The glories of your temple throng       Too thick to go in any song;       And we attend, O good and wise,       To \"days of grace\" and merchandise.         'When people's homes are burned away       They never have a cent to pay       If they have done as all should do,       O Phoenix, and have honoured you.         'So let us raise our voice and sing       The praises of the Phoenix King.       In classes one and two and three,       Oh, trust to him, for kind is he!'    'I'm sure YOU'RE very kind,' said the Phoenix; 'and now we must be  going. An thank you very much for a very pleasant time. May you all  prosper as you deserve to do, for I am sure a nicer, pleasanter-spoken  lot of temple attendants I have never met, and never wish to meet. I  wish you all good-day!'    It fluttered to the wrist of Robert and drew the four children from the  room. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8390"],[0,"Buddhism and Buddhists in China (#16)"],[1,"brotherhood. The members of this small  brotherhood decided that they must subscribe to vows and they took the  four following:    \"I promise before the Almighty and Omniscient God, that I with my whole  heart will surrender myself to the true Trinity, God the Father, the Son  and the Holy Spirit. I will with my whole heart have faith in Jesus  Christ as the Saviour of the world who gives completion to the  profoundest and best objects of the higher Buddhism. I will live in this  faith now and ever after.    \"I promise solemnly before God with my whole heart to devote myself to  the study of the true doctrine and break wholly with the evil manners of  the world and show forth in my public and private life that I am truly  united with Christ.    \"I promise that I in every respect will try so to educate myself that I  can be of use in the work of God on earth. I will with undivided heart  devote myself to the great work; to lead my brethren in the Buddhist  Association forward to the understanding of Christ as the only One, who  gives completion to the highest and profoundest ideas of Higher  Buddhism.    \"I promise that until my last hour I will work so that out of our  Christian Brotherhood there may grow forth a strong church of Christ  among Buddhists. I will not permit any evil thing to grow in my heart,  which could divide the brotherhood, but will always try to promote the  progress of every member in the knowledge of the holy obligations laid  down in these vows and our constitution.\"    Such men ought, to make choice Christians.    _8. Christianity's Constructive Values_    Buddhism in the course of its long history developed certain religious  ideas and values which we find in Christianity. It faced the fact of sin  and placed it in the heart. It diagnosed the fundamental instincts of  men, sex-appetite, will-to-achieve, and pugnacity. These must be  overcome. It regards them as delusions which must be eliminated.  Christianity also deals with these instincts. It is under no delusion as  to their strength. There are certain tendencies in Christianity which  have tried to annihilate them. The central tendency of Christianity,  however, recognizing their power for good, seeks to sublimate them and  make them serve the individual and society. This attitude of the two  religions toward these instincts is fundamentally different. The  attitude of Christianity has been justified even in Buddhist lands where  the religious life of the people has followed the same line that  Christianity advocates.    Early Buddhism tried to dissolve man's personality. Later Buddhism  corrected this and perhaps has appealed too much to the desire on the  part of the individual to enter a heaven which is merely a replica of  the earth. Christianity starts with a personal God and holds up before  the believer the goal of perfection for his own personality. It finds  man without a self and confers a real selfhood upon him.    Early Buddhism taught that salvation is accomplished by the individual  alone. It denies the possibility and the necessity of help from a divine  source. Subsequent history has proved this to have been wrong. In India,  Buddhism has been displaced by Hinduism, and in China, and Japan, the  Mahâyâna has developed the idea of salvation through another. The great  stream of Buddhism has recognized that man by himself is helpless. He  must have the help of a divine power in order to obtain salvation.  Christianity asserts that salvation is possible only through the  intervention of God. The incarnation, the life, death and resurrection  of Jesus and his work in the world through the Holy Spirit on the one  hand are the expression of God's solicitude for man, and, on the other  hand, correspond to the deep need which men of all ages have felt, for a  power above themselves. From the early stages of magic to the highest  reaches of religion we find this constant factor recognized by human  groups all over the world. They bear witness to a power above themselves  to whom they continually appeal. In Christianity we find this main  tendency enunciated most clearly. The individual cannot save himself.  Mankind cannot save itself. Both must rely upon the assistance of the  divine power which started this universe on its way and which is the  ever present creative force.    Christianity, moreover, has established the community of believers  including all classes and conditions of men. Herein each one may realize  himself. Herein also he may realize the kind of community which is  friendly to his highest aspirations for himself. Herein he has the  opportunity to transmute the instincts above mentioned into forces which  make for the larger development of his own person and the well-being of  the community.    Accordingly, as Christians face Buddhists, they can do so with the  consciousness that this great religion has been reaching out after the  light which shines brightly in our Christian religion. They have the  assurance not only that they have a message which brings fulfilment to  the ideas of the Mahâyâna, but also that it has prepared the way for the  hearts of the Chinese to receive the highest message of Christianity.          APPENDIX I      HINTS FOR THE PRELIMINARY STUDY OF BUDDHISM IN CHINA    The student should read and inwardly digest the booklet of K. J.  Saunders.    He should follow the directions given in Appendix One of that book, This  procedure is important because the Hînayâna Buddhism and the life of  Buddha are the background of Buddhism in China.    Then he may take Hackmann's _Buddhism as a Religion_  (No. 15). This will give a general orientation. This may be followed  with R. F. Johnston's _Buddhist China_ (No.  _20_). Along with this he may read Suzuki's  _Awakening of Faith_ (No. 32), and also his  _Outlines of Mahâyanâ Buddhism (No._ 33). McGovern's  _Introduction to Mahâyanâ Buddhism (No._ 23) will  illuminate the philosophical background of Buddhism, and Eliot's  _Hinduism and Buddhism_ (No. 13) will add historical  perspective.    The translation of _Mahdydna Sutras_ by Beal and in the  Sacred Books of the East will give him some of the sources for the  doctrines held in China. He may begin as the Buddhist missionaries did  with the sutra of the Forty-two sections and then take up the Diamond  Sutra, and then completing the sutras in Vol. 59 and the Catena of  Buddhist Scriptures.    For the study of the ethical side he will find De Groot's _Le Code  du Mahâyâna en Chine_ very helpful. For the study of the sects  Eliot, Vol. III, pp. 303-320 _Northern Buddhism_ (No. 14) will  be helpful.    In all his study he will find Eitel's _Handbook of Chinese  Buddhism_ (No. 12) indispensable. He must, however, make a  Chinese index in order to be able to use the book.    Contact with monks will be helpful and is quite necessary in order to  appreciate the human problems of the work.          APPENDIX II      A BRIEF BIBLIOGRAPHY    1.
