The absence of  the Pilgrim, who had gone East quite suddenly soon after the round-up  was over, and the generosity of the other fellows, who saw quite  plainly how it was--with Billy, at least--and forbore making any  advances on their own account, made the winter pass easily and left  Charming Billy in the spring not content, perhaps, but hopeful.    It was in the warm days of late April--the days which bring the birds  and the tender, young grass, when the air is soft and all outdoors  beckons one to come out and revel. On such a day Billy, stirred to an  indefinable elation because the world as he saw it then was altogether  good, crooned his pet song while he waited at the porch with Flora's  horse and his own. They were going to ride together because it was  Sunday and because, if the weather held to its past and present mood  of sweet serenity, he might feel impelled to start the wagons out  before the week was done; so that this might be their last Sunday ride  for nobody knew how long.    \"Let's ride up the creek,\" she suggested when she was in the saddle.  \"We haven't been up that way this spring. There's a trail, isn't  there?\"    \"Sure, there's a trail--but I don't know what shape it's in. I haven't  been over it myself for a month or so. We'll try it, but yuh won't  find much to see; it's all level creek-bottom for miles and kinda  monotonous to look at.\"    \"Well, we'll go, anyway,\" she decided, and they turned their horses'  heads toward the west.    They had gone perhaps five or six miles and were thinking of turning  back, when Billy found cause to revise his statement that there was  nothing to see. There had been nothing when he rode this way before,  but now, when they turned to follow a bend in the creek and in the  trail, they came upon a camp which looked more permanent than was  usual in that country. A few men were lounging around in the sun, and  there were scrapers of the wheeled variety, and wagons, and plows, and  divers other implements of toil that were strange to the place. Also  there was a long, reddish-yellow ridge branching out from the creek;  Billy knew it for a ditch--but a ditch larger than he had seen for  many a day. He did not say anything, even when Flora exclaimed over  the surprise of finding a camp there, but headed straight for the  camp.    When they came within speaking distance, a man showed in the opening  of one of the tents, looked at them a moment, and came forward.    \"Why, that's Fred Walland!\" cried Flora, and then caught herself  suddenly. \"I didn't know he was back,\" she added, in a tone much less  eager.    Billy gave her a quick look that might have told her much had she seen  it. He did not much like the color which had flared into her cheeks  at sight of the Pilgrim, and he liked still less the tone in which  she spoke his name. It was not much, and he had the sense to push the  little devil of jealousy out of sight behind him, but it had come and  changed something in the heart of Billy.    \"Why, hello!\" greeted the Pilgrim, and Billy remembered keenly that  the Pilgrim had spoken in just that way when he had opened the door of  the line-camp upon them, that night. \"I was going to ride over to the  ranch, after a while. How are yuh, anyhow?\" He came and held up his  hand to Flora, and she put her own into it. Billy, with eyebrows  pinched close, thought that they sure took their own time about  letting go again, and that the smile which she gave the Pilgrim was  quite superfluous to the occasion.    \"Yuh seem to be some busy over here,\" he remarked carelessly, turning  his eyes to the new ditch.    \"Well, yes. Brown's having a ditch put in here. We only started a few  days ago; them da--them no-account Swedes he got to do the rough work  are so slow, we're liable to be at it all summer. How's everybody at  the ranch? How's your mother, Miss Bridger? Has she got any mince pies  baked?\"    \"I don't know--you might ride over with us and see,\" she invited,  smiling at him again. \"We were just going to turn back--weren't we,  Billy Boy?\"    \"Sure!\" he testified, and for the first time found some comfort  in being called Billy Boy; because, if looks went for anything, it  certainly made the Pilgrim very uncomfortable. The spirits of Billy  rose a little.    \"If you'll wait till I saddle up, I'll go along. I guess the Svenskies  won't run off with the camp before I get back,\" said the Pilgrim,  and so they stayed, and afterward rode back together quite amiably  considering certain explosive elements in the party.    Perhaps Billy's mildness was due in a great measure to his  preoccupation, which made him deaf at times to what the others were  saying. He knew that they were quite impersonal in their talk, and so  he drifted into certain other channels of thought.    Was Brown going to start another cow-outfit, or was he merely going to  try his hand at farming? Billy knew that--unless he had sold it--Brown  owned a few hundred acres along the creek there; and as he rode over  it now he observed the soil more closely than was his habit, and saw  that, from a passing survey, it seemed fertile and free from either  adobe or alkali. It must be that Brown was going to try ranching.  Still, he had held out all his best stock, and Billy had not heard  that he had sold it since. Now that he thought of it, he had not heard  much about Brown since Dill bought the Double-Crank. Brown had been  away, and, though he had known in a general way that the Pilgrim  was still in his employ, he did not know in what capacity. In the  absorption of his own affairs he had not given the matter any thought,  though he had wondered at first what crazy impulse caused Brown to  sell the Double-Crank. Even now he did not know, and when he thought  of it the thing irritated him like a puzzle before it is solved.    So greatly did the matter trouble him that immediately upon reaching  the ranch he left Flora and the Pilgrim and hunted up Dill. He found  him hunched like a half-open jackknife in a cane rocker, with his legs  crossed and one long, lean foot dangling loosely before him; he was  reading \"The Essays of Elia,\" and the melancholy of his face gave  Billy the erroneous impression that the book was extremely sad, and  caused him to dislike it without ever looking inside the dingy blue  covers.    \"Say, Dilly, old Brown's putting in a ditch big enough to carry the  whole Missouri River. Did yuh know it?\"    Dill carefully creased down the corner of the page where he was  reading, untangled his legs and pulled himself up a bit in the chair.  \"Why, no, I don't think I have heard of it,\" he admitted. \"If I have  it must have slipped my mind--which isn't likely.\" Dill was rather  proud of his capacity for keeping a mental grasp on things.    \"Well, he's got a bunch uh men camped up the creek and the Pilgrim to  close-herd 'em--and I'm busy wondering what he's going to do with that  ditch. Brown don't do things just to amuse himself; yuh can gamble he  aims to make that ditch pack dollars into his jeans--and if yuh can  tell me _how_, I'll be a whole lot obliged.\" Dill shook his head, and  Billy went on. \"Did yuh happen to find out, when yuh was bargaining  for the Double-Crank, how much land Brown's got held out?\"    \"No-o--I can't say I did. From certain remarks he made, I was under  the impression that he owns quite a tract. I asked about getting all  the land he had, and he said he preferred not to put a price on it,  but that it would add considerably to the sum total. He said I would  not need it, anyhow, as there is plenty of open range for the stock.  He was holding it, he told me, for speculation and had never made any  use of it in running his stock, except as they grazed upon it.\"    \"Uh-huh. That don't sound to me like any forty-acre field; does it to  you?\"    \"As I said,\" responded Dill, \"I arrived at the conclusion that he owns  a good deal of land.\"    \"And I'll bet yuh the old skunk is going to start up a cow-outfit  right under our noses--though why the dickens the Double-Crank wasn't  good enough for him gets me.\"    \"If he does,\" Dill observed calmly, \"the man has a perfect right to  do so, William. We must guard against that greed which would crowd  out every one but ourselves--like pigs around a trough of sour milk! I  will own, however--\"    \"Say, Dilly! On the dead, are yuh religious?\"    \"No, William, I am not, in the sense you mean. I hope, however, that I  am honest. If Mr. Brown intends to raise cattle again I shall be glad  to see him succeed.\"    Charming Billy sat down suddenly, as though his legs would no longer  support him, and looked queerly at Dill. \"Hell!\" he said meditatively,  and sought with his fingers for his smoking material.    Dill showed symptoms of going back to \"The Essays of Elia,\" so that  Billy was stirred to speech.    \"Now, looky here, Dilly. You're all right, as far as yuh go--but this  range is carrying just about all the stock it needs right at present.  I don't reckon yuh realize that all the good bottoms and big coulees  are getting filled up with nesters; one here and one there, and every  year a few more. It ain't much, uh course, but every man that comes  is cutting down the range just that much. And I know one thing: when  Brown had this outfit himself he was mighty jealous uh the range, and  he didn't take none to the idea of anybody else shoving stock onto it  more than naturally drifted on in the course uh the season. If he's  going to start another cow-outfit, I'll bet yuh he's going to gobble  land--and that's what _we_ better do, and do it sudden.\"    \"Since I have never had much personal experience in the 'gobbling'  line, I'm afraid you'll have to explain,\" said Dill dryly.    \"I mean leasing. We got to beat Brown to it. We got to start in and  lease up all the land we can get our claws on.

I could have touched her  with a fishing rod and saw how easily she could be roped from where I  stood. The tree in which she had taken refuge grew from the head of  a weathered slope and rose close to the wall. At that point it was  merely a parapet of crumbling yellow rock. No doubt she had lain  concealed under the shelving wall and had not had time to get away  before the hounds were right upon her.    \"She's going to jump,\" yelled Jones, in my rear, as he dismounted.    I saw a golden-red streak flash downward, heard a mad medley from the  hounds, a cloud of dust rose, then something bright shone for a second  to the right along the wall. I ran with all my might to a headland of  rock upon which I scrambled and saw with joy that I could command the  situation.    The lioness was not in sight, nor were the hounds. The latter,  however, were hot on the trail. I knew the lioness had taken to  another tree or a hole under the wall, and would soon be routed out.  This time I felt sure she would run down and I took a rapid glance  below. The slope inclined at a steep angle and was one long slide of  bits of yellow stone with many bunches of scrub oak and manzanita.  Those latter I saw with satisfaction, because in case I had to go down  they would stop the little avalanches. The slope reached down perhaps  five hundred yards and ended in a thicket and jumble of rocks from  which rose on the right a bare yellow slide. This ran up to a low  cliff. I hoped the lion would not go that way, for it led to great  broken battlements of rim. Left of the slide was a patch of cedars.    Jim's yell pealed out, followed by the familiar penetrating howl of  the pack when it sighted game. With that I saw the lioness leaping  down the slope and close behind her a yellow hound.    \"Go it, Don, old boy!\" I yelled, wild with delight.    A crushing step on the stones told me Jones had arrived.    \"Hi! Hi! Hi!\" roared he.    I thought then that if the lioness did not cover thirty feet at every  jump I was not in a condition to judge distance. She ran away from Don  as if he had been tied and reached the thicket below a hundred yards  ahead of him. And when Don leaving his brave pack far up the slide  entered the thicket the lioness came out on the other side and bounded  up the bare slope of yellow shale.    \"Shoot ahead of her! Head her off! Turn her back!\" cried Jones.    With the word I threw forward the Remington and let drive. Following  the bellow of the rifle, so loud in that thin air, a sharp, harsh  report cracked up from below. A puff of yellow dust rose in front of  the lioness. I was in line, but too far ahead. I fired again. The  steel jacketed bullet hit a stone and spitefully whined away into the  canyon. I tried once more. This time I struck close to the lioness.  Disconcerted by a cloud of dust rising before her very eyes she  wheeled and ran back.    We had forgotten Don and suddenly he darted out of the thicket,  straight up the slide. Always, in every chase, we were afraid the  great hound would run to meet his death. We knew it was coming  sometime. When the lioness saw him and stopped, both Jones and I felt  that this was to be the end of Don.    \"Shoot her! Shoot her!\" cried Jones. \"She'll kill him! She'll kill  him!\"    As I knelt on the rock I had a hard contraction of my throat, and  then all my muscles set tight and rigid. I pulled the trigger of my  automatic once, twice. It was wonderful how closely the two bullets  followed each other, as we could tell by the almost simultaneous  puffs of dust rising from under the beast's nose. She must have been  showered and stung with gravel, for she bounded off to the left and  disappeared in the cedars. I had missed, but the shots had served to a  better end than if I had killed her.    As Don raced up the ground where a moment before a battle and probably  death had awaited him, the other hounds burst from the thicket. With  that, a golden form seemed to stand out from the green of the cedar,  to move and to rise.    \"She's treed! She's treed!\" shouted Jones. \"Go down and keep her there  while I follow.\"    From the back of the promontory where I met the main wall, I let  myself down a niche, foot here and there, a hand hard on the soft  stone, braced knee and back until I jumped to the edge of the slope.  The scrub oak and manzanita saved me many a fall. I set some stones  rolling and I beat them to the bottom. Having passed the thicket, I  bent my efforts to the yellow slide and when I had surmounted it my  breath came in labored pants. The howling of the hounds guided me  through the cedars.    First I saw Moze in the branches of cedar and above him the lioness. I  ran out into a little open patch of stony ground at the end of which  the tree stood leaning over a precipice. In truth the lioness was  swaying over a chasm.    Those details I grasped in a glance, then suddenly awoke to the fact  that the lioness was savagely snarling at Moze.    \"Moze! Moze! Get down!\" I yelled.    He climbed on serenely. He was a most exasperating dog. I screamed at  him and hit him with a rock big enough to break his bones. He kept on  climbing. Here was a predicament. Moze would surely get to the lioness  if I did not stop him, and this seemed impossible. It was out of the  question for me to climb after him. And if the lioness jumped she  would have to pass me or come straight at me. So I slipped down the  safety catch on my automatic and stood ready to save Moze or myself.    The lioness with a show of fury that startled me, descended her branch  a few steps, and reaching below gave Moze a sounding smack with her  big paw. The hound dropped as if he had been shot and hit the ground  with a thud. Whereupon she returned to her perch.    This reassured me and I ran among the dogs and caught Moze already  starting for the tree again and tied him, with a strap I always carried,  to a small bush nearby. I heard the yells of my companions  and looking back over the tops of the cedars I saw Jim riding down and  higher to the left Jones sliding, falling, running at a great rate. I  encouraged them to keep up the good work, and then gave my attention to  the lioness.    She regarded me with a cold, savage stare and showed her teeth. I  repaid this incivility on her part by promptly photographing her from  different points.    Jones and Jim were on the spot before I expected them and both were  dusty and dripping with sweat. I found to my surprise that my face was  wet as was also my shirt. Jones carried two lassos, and my canteen,  which I had left on the promontory.    \"Ain't she a beauty?\" he panted, wiping his face. \"Wait--till I get my  breath.\"    When finally he walked toward the cedar the lioness stood up and  growled as if she realized the entrance of the chief actor upon the  scene. Jones cast his lasso apparently to try her out, and the noose  spread out and fell over her head. As he tightened the rope the  lioness backed down behind a branch.    \"Tie the dogs!\" yelled Jones.    \"Quick!\" added Jim. \"She's goin' to jump.\"    Jim had only time to aid me in running my lasso under the collar of  Don, Sounder, Jude and one of the pups. I made them fast to a cedar.  I got my hands on Ranger just as Moze broke his strap. I grabbed his  collar and held on.    Right there was where trouble commenced for me. Ranger tussled valiantly  and Moze pulled me all over the place. Behind me I heard Jones' roar and  Jim's yell; the breaking of branches, the howling of the other dogs.  Ranger broke away from me and so enabled me to get my other hand on the  neck of crazy Moze. On more than one occasion I had tried to hold him  and had failed; this time I swore I would do it if he rolled me  over the precipice. As to that, only a bush saved me.    More and louder roars and yells, hoarser howls and sharper  wrestling, snapping sounds told me what was going on while I tried to  subdue Moze. I had a grim thought that I would just as lief have had  hold of the lioness. The hound presently stopped his plunging which gave  me an opportunity to look about. The little space was smoky with a smoke  of dust. I saw the lioness stretched out with one lasso around a bush  and another around a cedar with the end in the hands of Jim. He looked  as if he had dug up the ground. While he tied this lasso securely Jones  proceeded to rope the dangerous front paws.    The hounds quieted down and I took advantage of this absence of tumult  to get rid of Moze.    \"Pretty lively,\" said Jones, spitting gravel as I walked up. Sand and  dust lay thick in his beard and blackened his face. \"I tell you she  made us root.\"    Either the lioness had been much weakened or choked, or Jones had  unusual luck, for we muzzled her and tied up her paws in short order.    \"Where's Ranger?\" I asked suddenly, missing him from the panting  hounds.    \"I grabbed him by the heels when he tackled the lion, and I gave him a  sling somewheres,\" replied Jim.    Ranger put in an appearance then under the cedars limping painfully.    \"Jim, darn me, if I don't believe you pitched him over the precipice!\"  said Jones.    Examination proved this surmise to be correct. We saw where Ranger had  slipped over a twenty-foot wall. If he had gone over just under the  cedar where the depth was much greater he would never have come back.    \"The hounds are choking with dust and heat,\" I said. When I poured  just a little water from my canteen into the crown of my hat, the  hounds began fighting around and over me and spilled the water.    \"Behave, you coyotes!\" I yelled. Either they were insulted or fully  realized the exigency of the situation, for each one came up and  gratefully lapped every drop of his portion.    \"Shore, now comes the hell of it,\" said Jim appearing with a long  pole. \"Packin' the critter out.\"    An argument arose in regard to the best way up the"]]]
