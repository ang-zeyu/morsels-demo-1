It is just possible Shard might have  got through by El Cantara, following the camel road which is many  centuries old; or he may have gone by Algiers and Bou Saada and  through the mountain pass El Finita Dem, though that is a bad enough  way for camels to go (let alone bullocks with a ship) for which reason  the Arabs call it Finita Dem--the Path of Blood.    I should not have ventured to give this story the publicity of print  had the sailor been sober when he told it, for fear that he I should  have deceived you, O my reader; but this was never the case with him  as I took good care to ensure: \"in vino veritas\" is a sound old  proverb, and I never had cause to doubt his word unless that proverb  lies.    If it should prove that he has deceived me, let it pass; but if he has  been the means of deceiving you there are little things about him that  I know, the common gossip of that ancient tavern whose leaded  bottle-glass windows watch the sea, which I will tell at once to every  judge of my acquaintance, and it will be a pretty race to see which of  them will hang him.    Meanwhile, O my reader, believe the story, resting assured that if you  are taken in the thing shall be a matter for the hangman.            A Tale of the Equator    He who is Sultan so remote to the East that his dominions were deemed  fabulous in Babylon, whose name is a by-word for distance today in the  streets of Bagdad, whose capital bearded travellers invoke by name in  the gate at evening to gather hearers to their tales when the smoke of  tobacco arises, dice rattle and taverns shine; even he in that very  city made mandate, and said: \"Let there be brought hither all my  learned men that they may come before me and rejoice my heart with  learning.\"    Men ran and clarions sounded, and it was so that there came before the  Sultan all of his learned men. And many were found wanting. But of  those that were able to say acceptable things, ever after to be named  The Fortunate, one said that to the South of the Earth lay a Land--  said Land was crowned with lotus--where it was summer in our winter  days and where it was winter in summer.    And when the Sultan of those most distant lands knew that the Creator  of All had contrived a device so vastly to his delight his merriment  knew no bounds. On a sudden he spake and said, and this was the gist  of his saying, that upon that line of boundary or limit that divided  the North from the South a palace be made, where in the Northern  courts should summer be, while in the South was winter; so should he  move from court to court according to his mood, and dally with the  summer in the morning and spend the noon with snow. So the Sultan's  poets were sent for and bade to tell of that city, foreseeing its  splendour far away to the South and in the future of time; and some  were found fortunate. And of those that were found fortunate and were  crowned with flowers none earned more easily the Sultan's smile (on  which long days depended) than he that foreseeing the city spake of it  thus:    \"In seven years and seven days, O Prop of Heaven, shall thy builders  build it, thy palace that is neither North nor South, where neither  summer nor winter is sole lord of the hours. White I see it, very  vast, as a city, very fair, as a woman, Earth's wonder, with many  windows, with thy princesses peering out at twilight; yea, I behold  the bliss of the gold balconies, and hear a rustling down long  galleries and the doves' coo upon its sculptured eaves. O Prop of  Heaven, would that so fair a city were built by thine ancient sires,  the children of the sun, that so might all men see it even today, and  not the poets only, whose vision sees it so far away to the South and  in the future of time.    \"O King of the Years, it shall stand midmost on that line that  divideth equally the North from the South and that parteth the seasons  asunder as with a screen. On the Northern side when summer is in the  North thy silken guards shall pace by dazzling walls while thy  spearsmen clad in furs go round the South. But at the hour of noon in  the midmost day of the year thy chamberlain shall go down from his  high place and into the midmost court, and men with trumpets shall go  down behind him, and he shall utter a great cry at noon, and the men  with trumpets shall cause their trumpets to blare, and the spearsmen  clad in furs shall march to the North and thy silken guard shall take  their place in the South, and summer shall leave the North and go to  the South, and all the swallows shall rise and follow after. And alone  in thine inner courts shall no change be, for they shall lie narrowly  along that line that parteth the seasons in sunder and divideth the  North from the South, and thy long gardens shall lie under them.    \"And in thy gardens shall spring always be, for spring lies ever at  the marge of summer; and autumn also shall always tint thy gardens,  for autumn always flares at winter's edge, and those gardens shall lie  apart between winter and summer. And there shall be orchards in thy  garden, too, with all the burden of autumn on their boughs and all the  blossom of spring.    \"Yea, I behold this palace, for we see future things; I see its white  wall shine in the huge glare of midsummer, and the lizards lying along  it motionless in the sun, and men asleep in the noonday, and the  butterflies floating by, and birds of radiant plumage chasing  marvellous moths; far off the forest and great orchids glorying there,  and iridescent insects dancing round in the light. I see the wall upon  the other side; the snow has come upon the battlements, the icicles  have fringed them like frozen beards, a wild wind blowing out of  lonely places and crying to the cold fields as it blows has sent the  snowdrifts higher than the buttresses; they that look out through  windows on that side of thy palace see the wild geese flying low and  all the birds of the winter, going by swift in packs beat low by the  bitter wind, and the clouds above them are black, for it is midwinter  there; while in thine other courts the fountains tinkle, falling on  marble warmed by the fire of the summer sun.    \"Such, O King of the Years, shall thy palace be, and its name shall be  Erlathdronion, Earth's Wonder; and thy wisdom shall bid thine  architects build at once, that all may see what as yet the poets see  only, and that prophecy be fulfilled.\"    And when the poet ceased the Sultan spake, and said, as all men  hearkened with bent heads:    \"It will be unnecessary for my builders to build this palace,  Erlathdronion, Earth's Wonder, for in hearing thee we have drunk  already its pleasures.\"    And the poet went forth from the Presence and dreamed a new thing.                          .     .     .     .     .            A Narrow Escape    It was underground.    In that dank cavern down below Belgrave Square the walls were  dripping. But what was that to the magician? It was secrecy that he  needed, not dryness. There he pondered upon the trend of events,  shaped destinies and concocted magical brews.    For the last few years the serenity of his ponderings had been  disturbed by the noise of the motor-bus; while to his keen ears there  came the earthquake-rumble, far off, of the train in the tube, going  down Sloane Street; and when he heard of the world above his head was  not to its credit.    He decided one evening over his evil pipe, down there in his dank  chamber, that London had lived long enough, had abused its  opportunities, had gone too far, in fine, with its civilisation. And  so he decided to wreck it.    Therefore he beckoned up his acolyte from the weedy end of the cavern,  and, \"Bring me,\" he said, \"the heart of the toad that dwelleth in  Arabia and by the mountains of Bethany.\" The acolyte slipped away by  the hidden door, leaving that grim old man with his frightful pipe,  and whither he went who knows but the gipsy people, or by what path he  returned; but within a year he stood in the cavern again, slipping  secretly in by the trap while the old man smoked, and he brought with  him a little fleshy thing that rotted in a casket of pure gold.    \"What is it?\" the old man croaked.    \"It is,\" said the acolyte, \"the heart of the toad that dwelt once  in Arabia and by the mountains of Bethany.\"    The old man's crooked fingers closed on it, and he blessed the acolyte  with his rasping voice and claw-like hand uplifted; the motor-bus  rumbled above on its endless journey; far off the train shook Sloane  Street.    \"Come,\" said the old magician, \"it is time.\" And there and then they  left the weedy cavern, the acolyte carrying cauldron, gold poker and  all things needful, and went abroad in the light. And very wonderful  the old man looked in his silks.    Their goal was the outskirts of London; the old man strode in front  and the acolyte ran behind him, and there was something magical in the  old man's stride alone, without his wonderful dress, the cauldron and  wand, the hurrying acolyte and the small gold poker.    Little boys jeered till they caught the old man's eye. So there went  on through London this strange procession of two, too swift for any to  follow. Things seemed worse up there than they did in the cavern, and  the further they got on their way towards London's outskirts the worse  London got. \"It is time,\" said the old man, \"surely.\"    And so they came at last to London's edge and a small hill watching it  with a mournful look. It was so mean that the acolyte longed for the  cavern, dank though it was and full of terrible sayings that the old  man said when he slept.    They climbed the hill and put the cauldron down, and put there in the  necessary things, and lit a fire of herbs that no chemist will sell  nor decent gardener grow, and stirred the cauldron with the golden  poker.

The bending of the body low is not be commended.         (9) When you see a foreigner be sure and cover up naked parts of       the body.         (10) Hold in high regard the worship of ancestors and treat your       relations with warm cordiality, but do not regard a person as your       enemy because he or she is a Christian.         (11) In going through the world you will often find a knowledge of       a foreign tongue absolutely essential.         (12) Beware of selling your souls to foreigners and becoming their       slaves. Sell them no houses or lands.         (13) Aim at not being beaten in your competition with foreigners.       Remember that loyalty and filial piety are our most precious       national treasures and do nothing to violate them.         Many of the above rules are excellent in tone. Number 7, however,       which hails from Osaka, is somewhat narrow and prejudiced. The       injunction not to sell houses to foreigners is, as the _Jiji       Shimpo_ points out, absurd and mischievous.[H]    The sensitiveness of the people also works to the advantage of the  nation in the social unity which it helps to secure. Indeed I cannot  escape the conviction that the striking unity of the Japanese is  largely due to this characteristic. It tends to make their mental and  emotional activities synchronous. It retards reform for a season, to  be sure, but later it accelerates it. It makes it difficult for  individuals to break away from their surroundings and start out on new  lines. It leads to a general progress while it tends to hinder  individual progress. It tends to draw back into the general current of  national life those individuals who, under exceptional conditions, may  have succeeded in breaking away from it for a season. This, I think,  is one of the factors of no little power at work among the Christian  churches in Japan. It is one, too, that the Japanese themselves little  perceive; so far as I have observed, foreigners likewise fail to  realize its force.    Closely connected with this sensitiveness to environment are other  qualities which make it effective. They are: great flexibility,  adjustability, agility (both mental and physical), and the powers of  keen attention to details and of exact imitation.    As opposed to all this is the Chinese lack of flexibility. Contrast a  Chinaman and a Japanese after each has been in America a year. The one  to all appearances is an American; his hat, his clothing, his manner,  seem so like those of an American that were it not for his small size,  Mongolian type of face, and defective English, he could easily be  mistaken for one. How different is it with the Chinaman! He retains  his curious cue with a tenacity that is as intense as it is  characteristic. His hat is the conventional one adopted by all Chinese  immigrants. His clothing likewise, though far from Chinese, is  nevertheless entirely un-American. He makes no effort to conform to  his surroundings. He seems to glory in his separateness.    The Japanese desire to conform to the customs and appearances of those  about him is due to what I have called sensitiveness; his success is  due to the flexibility of his mental constitution.    But this characteristic is seen in multitudes of little ways. The new  fashion of wearing the hair according to the Western styles; of  wearing Western hats, and Western clothing, now universal in the army,  among policemen, and common among officials and educated men; the use  of chairs and tables, lamps, windows, and other Western things is due  in no small measure to that flexibility of mind which readily adopts  new ideas and new ways; is ready to try new things and new words, and  after trial, if it finds them convenient or useful or even amusing, to  retain them permanently, and this flexibility is, in part, the reason  why the Japanese are accounted a fickle people. They accept new ways  so easily that those who do not have this faculty have no explanation  for it but that of fickleness. A frequent surprise to a missionary in  Japan is that of meeting a fine-looking, accomplished gentleman whom  he knew a few years before as a crude, ungainly youth. I am convinced  that it is the possession of this set of characteristics that has  enabled Japan so quickly to assimilate many elements of an alien  civilization.    Yet this flexibility of mind and sensitiveness to changed conditions  find some apparently striking exceptions. Notable among these are the  many customs and appliances of foreign nations which, though adopted  by the people, have not been completely modified to suit their own  needs. In illustration is the Chinese ideograph, for the learning of  which even in the modern common-school reader, there is no arrangement  of the characters in the order of their complexity. The possibility of  simplifying the colossal task of memorizing these uncorrelated  ideographs does not seem to have occurred to the Japanese; though it  is now being attempted by the foreigner. Perhaps a partial explanation  of this apparent exception to the usual flexibility of the people in  meeting conditions may be found in their relative lack of originality.  Still I am inclined to refer it to a greater sensitiveness of the  Japanese to the personal and human, than to the impersonal and  physical environment.    The customary explanation of the group of characteristics considered  in this chapter is that they are innate, due to brain and nerve  structure, and acquired by each generation through biological  heredity. If closely examined, however, this is seen to be no  explanation at all. Accepting the characteristics as empirical  inexplicable facts, the real problem is evaded, pushed into  prehistoric times, that convenient dumping ground of biological,  anthropological, and sociological difficulties.    Japanese flexibility, imitativeness, and sensitiveness to environment  are to be accounted for by a careful consideration of the national  environment and social order. Modern psychology has called attention  to the astonishing part played by imitation, conscious and  unconscious, in the evolution of the human race, and in the  unification of the social group. Prof. Le Tarde goes so far as to make  this the fundamental principle of human evolution. He has shown that  it is ever at work in the life of every human being, modifying all his  thoughts, acts, and feelings. In the evolution of civilization the  rare man thinks, the millions imitate.    A slight consideration of the way in which Occidental lands have  developed their civilization will convince anyone that imitation has  taken the leading part. Japan, therefore, is not unique in this  respect. Her periods of wholesale imitation have indeed called special  notice to the trait. But the rapidity of the movement has been due to  the peculiarities of her environment. For long periods she has been in  complete isolation, and when brought into contact with foreign  nations, she has found them so far in advance of herself in many  important respects that rapid imitation was the only course left her  by the inexorable laws of nature. Had she not imitated China in  ancient times and the Occident in modern times, her independence, if  not her existence, could hardly have been maintained.    Imitation of admittedly superior civilizations has therefore been an  integral, conscious element of Japan's social order, and to a degree  perhaps not equaled by the social order of any other race.    The difference between Japanese imitation and that of other nations  lies in the fact that whereas the latter, as a rule, despise foreign  races, and do not admit the superiority of alien civilizations as a  whole, imitating only a detail here and there, often without  acknowledgment and sometimes even without knowledge, the Japanese, on  the other hand, have repeatedly been placed in such circumstances as  to see the superiority of foreign civilizations as a whole, and to  desire their general adoption. This has produced a spirit of imitation  among all the individuals of the race. It has become a part of their  social inheritance. This explanation largely accounts for the striking  difference between Japanese and Chinese in the Occident. The Japanese  go to the West in order to acquire all the West can give. The Chinaman  goes steeled against its influences. The spirit of the Japanese  renders him quickly susceptible to every change in his surroundings.  He is ever noting details and adapting himself to his circumstances.  The spirit of the Chinaman, on the contrary, renders him quite  oblivious to his environment. His mind is closed. Under special  circumstances, when a Chinaman has been liberated from the  prepossession of his social inheritance, he has shown himself as  capable of Occidentalization in clothing, speech, manner, and thought  as a Japanese. Such cases, however, are rare.    But a still more effective factor in the development of the  characteristics under consideration is the nature of Japanese  feudalism. Its emphasis on the complete subordination of the inferior  to the superior was one of its conspicuous features. This was a factor  always and everywhere at work in Japan. No individual was beyond its  potent influence. Attention to details, absolute obedience, constant,  conscious imitation, secretiveness, suspiciousness, were all highly  developed by this social system. Each of these traits is a special  form of sensitiveness to environment. From the most ancient times the  initiative of superiors was essential to the wide adoption by the  people of any new idea or custom. Christianity found ready acceptance  in the sixteenth century and Buddhism in the eighth, because they had  been espoused by exalted persons. The superiority of the civilization  of China in early times, and of the West in modern times, was first  acknowledged and adopted by a few nobles and"]]]
