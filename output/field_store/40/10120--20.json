Methinks I can detect his  cloven foot.\"    \"You're wrong,\" laughed Merriwell. \"But you may have been near enough at  some time to detect his cloven breath!\"    The three freshmen who were leaning out of one of the upper windows  repeated in chorus:      \"Punch, brother--punch with care,    Punch in the presence of the passenjair.\"    Another freshman shouted:    \"Say, Swallows, give us a lock of your hair. It'll save the expense of  gas in my room.\"    \"I'd like a lock of it, too,\" declared another. \"I'm troubled with rats,  and I haven't any paris green handy.\"    \"Oh, rats!\" yelled twenty voices.    \"Hello, Parker!\" cried Little. \"I hear you were held up last night? Is  it true?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" said Rattleton. \"He'd been down to Morey's, and that was the  way he got home.\"    \"But oh, what a difference in the morning,\" sang the freshmen.    \"Ask Rattleton if he means to join the Indians?\" called a soph.    \"Or will he Sioux for damages?\" put in another.    \"Oh, say!\" groaned Dismal Jones. \"That's the worst I ever heard! It's  enough to give one heart failure!\"    \"Come out and fight! Come out and fight!\" urged the sophomores. \"You  don't dare to come out and fight!\"    \"You will have to excuse us this evening, gentlemen,\" said Merriwell,  suavely. \"We have done our best to entertain you, and we will see you  again at some other date.\"    \"You are certain to see me again,\" assented Browning. \"You ran away, or  we would have settled matters between us this evening. As it is, I am  going to watch my opportunity to do you fairly and squarely. When I am  done with you one of us will be beautifully licked.\"    \"And that one will not be King Bruce,\" declared Andy Emery.    \"Say! say! say!\" spluttered Rattleton. \"I'll go you a shot that it is!  I'll stand you a supper for twenty at any place you'll name that  Merriwell knocks the everlasting stuffing out of Browning.\"    \"Done!\" returned Emery.    \"You name plime and tace--I mean time and place, and we'll be there,  you bet!\" declared Harry. \"All we want is a fair deal.\"    \"You'll get that,\" assured Browning. \"This little affair shall be  arranged very soon.\"    \"The sooner the better. Don't delay on our account.\"    The sophomores, seeing it was useless to linger there and be taunted by  the freshmen, began to stroll away one by one.    Up in Merriwell's room Rattleton got down his banjo and began to put it  in tune. A merry party gathered there. One of the strings snapped, and  as he was putting on another Harry fell to laughing.    \"What are you laughing at?\" asked Bandy Robinson.    \"Down at the table to-night,\" explained Harry, \"Merriwell was poking his  finger into the butter. I asked him what he was doing that for, and he  said he was only feeling its muscle.\"    The boys who dined in the house appreciated that, and there was a  general laugh. Then Harry adjusted the string and placed the banjo in  tune. Pretty soon the boys were singing \"Bingo,\" \"Upidee,\" \"Nellie Was a  Lady,\" and other college songs. Every one of them seemed familiar with  \"Paddy Duffy's Cart\" and its pretty chorus:      \"Twinkling stars are laughing, love,      Laughing on you and me,    While your bright eyes look into mine,      Peeping stars they seem to be.\"    Such glorious days and such merry nights will never come again to those  who have known them. Here's to good old Yale!          CHAPTER XIV.    THE RUSH.      At last the sophomores were thoroughly aroused. The freshmen had long  been carrying things with a high hand, but the rushing of a lot of them  who were in dress suits and bound for a swell party was the straw that  broke the camel's back.    An indignation meeting was held, and certain freshmen were placed under  the ban.    Of these Merriwell was the leader, and it was agreed that every effort  must be made to \"take the starch\" out of him. That Browning intended to  \"do\" Merriwell was well known, but some of the others proposed to get at  him.    \"Wait,\" advised Bruce--\"wait till I have had it out with that fellow.  Then you may do whatever you like with him. But I feel it a solemn duty  to settle our little affair before anybody else tackles him.\"    The freshmen were getting their ball team in condition for the coming  season, and they were practicing as often as possible. Frank was  interested in the team, and it was said by those who watched him that he  seemed to have the making of a pitcher in him. He had sharp curves and  good control. If he had a head, they said, he was all right. But this  was something that could not be decided till he had been tried in a  game.    Another freshman by the name of Walter Gordon seemed certain to be the  regular pitcher of the team. He had a record, as he had shown, while  Merriwell would say nothing about what he had done in the way of  pitching.    The students had found it extremely difficult to find out much about  Merriwell, as he persistently avoided talking about himself. If he had  been one of the kind of fellows who go around and brag about themselves  and what they have done he would not have aroused so much interest; but  the very fact that he would not talk of himself made the students  curious to know something of his history.    In a vague sort of way it became known that although he lived in simple  style, like any freshman whose parents were not wealthy, he had a  fortune in his own right and had traveled extensively in various parts  of the world.    Frank's silence seemed to cast an air of mystery about him, and that air  of mystery made him all the more interesting, for the human mind is ever  curious to peer into anything that has the flavor of a secret.    The sophomores had been rushed by the freshmen, and they resolved to  retaliate in a similar manner. On Saturday afternoons the freshmen ball  team practiced, and Saturday was at hand. It would be an opportune time  to meet the youngsters and make it warm for them.    The affair was carefully planned, but wind of it reached the freshmen.  As a result, the youngsters prepared for what they knew must take place.  There could be no such thing as avoiding it, so when Saturday noon came  they dressed themselves in their old clothes and started for the park,  going out as much as possible in a body.    When the park was reached it was found that the sophomores were there  ahead of them. More than that, the sophs had closed and fastened the  gate, and they proposed to hold it. They taunted the freshmen, and told  them they would have to climb the fence if they hoped to get into the  park.    Then there was a consultation among the freshmen. \"We'll have to make a  rush,\" was the universal decision.    Frank looked the ground over, and he decided that an ordinary rush would  not be successful, for that was the very thing the sophomores were  expecting. But there seemed no other way of getting into the park unless  they climbed the fence, and not a man thought of doing such a thing as  that.    The sophomores formed in front of the gate, five deep. In the front  rank of the sophs were Browning and two 'Varsity crew men. Bruce was in  the middle, with the rowers on either side. The ends were two men from  the football team.    Thus the very first line of the sophomores made a formidable array, and  it is not surprising that some of the freshmen were chicken-hearted.    With assistance, Frank marshaled the freshmen, reserving a place in the  first line for himself. While that might be considered a position of  honor, it was the most dangerous, and every fellow there knew this rush  was to be no baby play.    For companions Merriwell selected Dismal Jones, Jack Diamond, Puss  Parker and a big, broad-shouldered fellow by the name of Hovey.    Rattleton and Robinson, together with a dozen others, were appointed as  \"scouts.\" It was their duty to \"hook\" out men from the ranks of the  sophs and break the force of the enemy's rush as far as possible.    The sophomores had likewise appointed a dozen scouts, strong, active  fellows, every one of whom had shown ability as an athlete.    The sophs prepared quickly for the rush, but it took more time to get  the freshmen in order. In this the seniors rendered not a little  assistance.    When everything was ready the order was given, and the freshmen started  forward. Those in the front line leaned back at a slant, and those  behind pushed.    At the same time the sophomores moved toward the freshmen, and then  there were shouts, taunts and jeers. Each side gave its own cheer.    \"This is the last of the freshmen!\" cried the sophomores. \"We'll wipe  them off the earth. Good-by, freshies!\"    \"'Umpty-seven will never be heard of again,\" returned the freshmen.  \"They'll be angels right away.\"    Then the two bodies came together with a frightful impact. They had  locked their arms about each other's waists, and there they clung, while  they pressed upon each other with all their might.    For a little time they swayed and swayed. There were screams and cries  of pain. They wavered and turned about, but still the crush continued.    The scouts were getting in their work, hooking their bent arms around  the necks of their opponents and yanking them out of the line.    Before long the rush turned into a general pushing and hauling. Freshman  pitted himself again sophomore, and a score of wrestling matches were in  progress.    Merriwell and Browning had clinched at the outset, but it was a long  time before they could do anything but cling to each other. When they  did have an opportunity another soph, a scout, spoiled the match by  making a low tackle on Frank and flinging him to the ground. Browning  came down heavily on the leader of the freshmen, but he immediately  jumped up, crying:    \"That was not a square deal. Let's have it over.\"    But the breath had been knocked out of Frank with the force of the fall,  and he fell back twice as he struggled to arise.    \"Are you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11123"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 01 (#17)"],[1,"German nature.    As Longfellow's _Evangeline_, treating in the same verse-form of the  dactylic hexameter and in a way partly epic and partly idyllic a story  of love and domestic interests in a contrasting setting of war and  exile, was modeled on _Hermann and Dorothea_, so the latter poem was  suggested by J. H. Voss' idyl _Luise_, published first in parts in  1783 and 1784 and as a whole revised in 1795. Of his delight in  _Luise_ Goethe wrote to Schiller in February, 1798: \"This proved to be  much to my advantage, for this joy finally became productive in me, it  drew me into this form (the epic), begot my _Hermann_, and who knows  what may yet come of it.\" But _Luise_ is not really epic; it is  without action, without unity, without any large historical outlook,--a  series of minutely pictured, pleasing idyllic scenes.    In contrast herewith Goethe's purpose was in his own words, \"in an  epic crucible to free from its dross the purely human existence of a  small German town, and at the same time mirror in a small glass the  great movements and changes of the world's stage.\" This purpose he  achieved in the writing of _Hermann and Dorothea_ at intervals from  September, 1796, through the summer of 1797, in the autumn of which  year the poem was published.    The main sources from which the poet drew his material are four. In  the first place the theme was invented by him out of an anecdote of  the flight of Protestant refugees from the Archbishopric of Salzburg  in 1731-1732. On the basis of this anecdote he drew the original  outlines of the meeting and union of the lovers. Secondly, as a  consequence of the French Revolution, Germans were forced to flee from  German territory west of the Rhine. Goethe was present with Prussian  troops in France in 1792, and observed the siege of Mainz in 1793.  Hence his knowledge of war and exile, with their attendant cruelties  and sufferings. Thirdly, the personal experiences of his own life  could not but contribute to his description of the then German  present. Features of Frankfurt and Ilmenau reappear. The characters  show traits of Goethe's parents, and possibly something of his wife is  in Dorothea. Hermann's mother bears the name of the poet's and reveals  many of her qualities. But some of these are given to the  landlord-father, while the elder Goethe's pedantry and petty  weaknesses are shown in the apothecary. The poet's experiences in the  field are realistically reproduced in many particulars of character  and incident, as are doubtless also his mother's vivid reports of  events in Frankfurt during July and August, 1796. We may feel sure too  that it was the occurrences of this summer that led Goethe to  transform the short, pure idyl of his first intention into a longer  epic of his own present. The fourth source is literary tradition,  which we may trace back through the verse idyl of Voss to the prose  idyl of Gessner, thence through the unnatural Arcadian pastorals of  the seventeenth and earlier centuries to the great Greek  creators,--Theocritus, of the idyl, and Homer, of the epic.    From whatever source derived, the materials were transmuted and  combined by Goethe's genius into a broad, full picture of German life,  with characters typical of the truly human and of profound ethical  importance, interpreting to the attentive reader the significance of  life for the individual, the family, the nation.      HERMANN AND DOROTHEA (1797)[32]    TRANSLATED BY ELLEN FROTHINGHAM      CALLIOPE    FATE AND SYMPATHY    Truly, I never have seen the market and street so deserted!  How as if it were swept looks the town, or had perished! Not fifty  Are there, methinks, of all our inhabitants in it remaining.    What will not curiosity do! here is every one running,  Hurrying to gaze on the sad procession of pitiful exiles.  Fully a league it must be to the causeway they have to pass over,  Yet all are hurrying down in the dusty heat of the noonday.  I, in good sooth, would not stir from my place to witness the sorrows  Borne by good, fugitive people, who now, with their rescued possessions,  Driven, alas! from beyond the Rhine, their beautiful country,  Over to us are coming, and through the prosperous corner  Roam of this our luxuriant valley, and traverse its windings.  \"Well hast thou done, good wife, our son in thus kindly dispatching,  Laden with something to eat and to drink, and with store of old linen,  'Mongst the poor folk to distribute; for giving belongs to the wealthy.  How the youth drives, to be sure! What control he has over the horses!  Makes not our carriage a handsome appearance,--the new one? With comfort,  Four could be seated within, with a place on the box for the coachman.  This time, he drove by himself. How lightly it rolled round the corner!\"  Thus, as he sat at his ease in the porch of his house on the market,  Unto his wife was speaking mine host of the Golden Lion.    Thereupon answered and said the prudent, intelligent housewife:  \"Father, I am not inclined to be giving away my old linen:  Since it serves many a purpose; and cannot be purchased for money,  When we may want it. To-day, however, I gave, and with pleasure,  Many a piece that was better, indeed, in shirts and in bed-clothes;  For I was told of the aged and children who had to go naked.  But wilt thou pardon me, father? thy wardrobe has also been plundered.  And, in especial, the wrapper that has the East-Indian flowers,  Made of the finest of chintz, and lined with delicate flannel,  Gave I away: it was thin and old, and quite out of the fashion.\"    Thereupon answered and said, with a smile, the excellent landlord:  \"Faith! I am sorry to lose it, my good old calico wrapper,  Real East-Indian stuff: I never shall get such another.  Well, I had given up wearing it: nowadays, custom compels us  Always to go in surtout, and never appear but in jacket;  Always to have on our boots; forbidden are night-cap and slippers.\"    [Illustration: HERMANN'S PARENTS IN THE DOORWAY OF THE TAVERN Ludwig  Richter]    \"See!\" interrupted the wife; \"even now some are yonder returning,  Who have beheld the procession: it must, then, already be over.  Look at the dust on their shoes! and see how their faces are glowing!  Every one carries his kerchief, and with it is wiping the sweat off.  Not for a sight like that would I run so far and so suffer,  Through such a heat; in sooth, enough shall I have in the telling.\"    Thereupon answered and said, with emphasis, thus, the good father:  \"Rarely does weather like this attend such a harvest as this is.  We shall be bringing our grain in dry, as the hay was before it.  Not the least cloud to be seen, so perfectly clear is the heaven;  And, with delicious coolness, the wind blows in from the eastward.  That is the weather to last! over-ripe are the cornfields already;  We shall begin on the morrow to gather our copious harvest.\"    Constantly, while he thus spoke, the crowds of men and of women  Grew, who their homeward way were over the market-place wending;  And, with the rest, there also returned, his daughters beside him,  Back to his modernized house on the opposite side of the market,  Foremost merchant of all the town, their opulent neighbor,  Rapidly driving his open barouche,--it was builded in Landau.  Lively now grew the streets, for the city was handsomely peopled.  Many a trade was therein carried on, and large manufactures.  Under their doorway thus the affectionate couple were sitting,  Pleasing themselves with many remarks on the wandering people.  Finally broke in, however, the worthy housewife, exclaiming:  \"Yonder our pastor, see! is hitherward coming, and with him  Comes our neighbor the doctor, so they shall every thing tell us;  All they have witnessed abroad, and which 'tis a sorrow to look on.\"    Cordially then the two men drew nigh, and saluted the couple;  Sat themselves down on the benches of wood that were placed in the doorway,  Shaking the dust from their feet, and fanning themselves with                                              their kerchiefs.  Then was the doctor, as soon as exchanged were the mutual greetings,  First to begin, and said, almost in a tone of vexation:  \"Such is mankind, forsooth! and one man is just like another,  Liking to gape and to stare when ill-luck has befallen his neighbor.  Every one hurries to look at the flames, as they soar in destruction;  Runs to behold the poor culprit, to execution conducted:  Now all are sallying forth to gaze on the need of these exiles,  Nor is there one who considers that he, by a similar fortune,  May, in the future, if not indeed next, be likewise o'ertaken.  Levity not to be pardoned, I deem; yet it lies in man's nature.\"    Thereupon answered and said the noble, intelligent pastor;  Ornament he of the town, still young, in the prime of his manhood.    He was acquainted with life,--with the needs of his hearers acquainted;  Deeply imbued he was with the Holy Scriptures' importance,  As they reveal man's destiny to us, and man's disposition;  Thoroughly versed, besides, in best of secular writings.  \"I should be loath,\" he replied, \"to censure an innocent instinct,  Which to mankind by good mother Nature has always been given.  What understanding and reason may sometimes fail to accomplish,  Oft will such fortunate impulse, that bears us resistlessly with it.  Did curiosity draw not man with its potent attraction,  Say, would he ever have learned how harmoniously fitted together  Worldly experiences are? For first what is novel he covets;  Then with unwearying industry follows he after the useful;  Finally longs for the good by which he is raised and ennobled.  While he is young, such lightness of mind is a joyous companion,  Traces of pain-giving evil effacing as soon as 'tis over.  He is indeed to be praised, who, out of this gladness of temper,  Has in his ripening years a sound understanding developed;  Who, in good fortune or ill, with"]]]
