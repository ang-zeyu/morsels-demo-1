Case No. 3. _The Sportsman_.--A friend of mine in the South is the owner  of a game preserve in which wild ducks are at times very numerous. Once  upon a time he was visited by a northern sportsmen who takes a deep and  abiding interest in the preservation of game. The sportsman was invited  to go out duck-shooting; ducks being then in season there. He said:    \"Yes, I will go; and I want you to put me in a place where I can kill a  _hundred ducks in a day_! I never have done that yet, and I would like  to do it, once!\"    \"All right,\" said my friend, \"I can put you in such a place; and if you  can shoot well enough, you can kill a hundred ducks in a day.\"    The effort was made in all earnestness. There was much shooting, but few  were the ducks that fell before it. In concluding this story my friend  remarked in a tone of disgust:    \"All the game-preserving sportsmen that come to me are just like that!  _They want to kill all they can kill_!\"    There is a blood-test by which to separate the conscientious sportsmen  from the mere gunners. Here it is:    A _sportsman_ stops shooting when game becomes scarce; and he does not  object to long-close-season laws; but    A _gunner_ believes in killing \"all that the law allows;\" and _he  objects to long close seasons_!    I warrant that whenever and wherever this test is applied it will  separate the sheep from the goats. It applies in all America, all Asia  and Africa, and in Greenland, with equal force.    [Illustration: G.O. SHIELDS  A Notable Defender of Wild Life]    THE GAME-HOG.--This term was coined by G.O. Shields, in 1897, when he  was editor and owner of _Recreation Magazine_, and it has come into  general use. It has been recognized by a judge on the bench as being an  appropriate term to apply to all men who selfishly slaughter wild game  beyond the limits of decency. Although it is a harsh term, and was  mercilessly used by Mr. Shields in his fierce war on the men who  slaughtered game for \"sport,\" it has jarred at least a hundred thousand  men into their first realization of the fact that to-day there is a  difference between decency and indecency in the pursuit of game. The use  of the term has done _very great good_; but, strange to say, it has made  for Mr. Shields a great many enemies _outside_ the ranks of the  game-hogs themselves! From this one might fairly suppose that there is  such a thing as a sympathetic game-hog!    One thing at least is certain. During a period of about six years, while  his war with the game-hogs was on, from Maine to California, Mr.  Shields's name became a genuine terror to excessive killers of game; and  it is reasonably certain that his war saved a great number of game birds  from the slaughter that otherwise would have overtaken them!    The number of armed men and boys who annually take the field in the  United States in the pursuit of birds and quadrupeds, is enormous.  People who do not shoot have no conception of it; and neither do they  comprehend the mechanical perfection and fearful deadliness of the  weapons used. This feature of the situation can hardly be realized until  some aspect of it is actually seen.    I have been at some pains to collect the latest figures showing the  number of hunting licenses issued in 1911, but the total is incomplete.  In some states the figures are not obtainable, and in some states there  are no hunters' license laws. The figures of hunting licenses issued in  1911 that I have obtained from official sources are set forth below.      THE UNITED STATES ARMY OF DESTRUCTION    _Hunting Licenses issued in_ 1911    Alabama               5,090          Montana              59,291  California          138,689          Nebraska             39,402  Colorado             41,058          New Hampshire        33,542  Connecticut          19,635          New Jersey           61,920  Idaho                50,342          New Mexico            7,000  Illinois            192,244          New York            150,222  Indiana              54,813          Rhode Island          6,541  Iowa                 91,000          South Dakota         31,054  Kansas               44,069          Utah                 27,800  Louisiana            76,000          Vermont              31,762  Maine                 2,552          Washington, about    40,000  Massachusetts        45,039          Wisconsin           138,457  Michigan             22,323          Wyoming               9,721  Missouri             66,662                                                         ---------              Total number of regularly licensed gunners 1,486,228    The average for the twenty-seven states that issued licenses as shown  above is 55,046 for each state.    Now, the twenty-one states issuing no licenses, or not reporting,  produced in 1911 fully as many gunners per capita as did the other  twenty-seven states. Computed fairly on existing averages they must have  turned out a total of 1,155,966 gunners, making for all the United  States =2,642,194= armed men and boys warring upon the remnant of game  in 1911. We are not counting the large number of lawless hunters who  never take out licenses. Now, is Mr. Beard's picture a truthful  presentation, or not?    _New York_ with only deer, ruffed grouse, shore-birds, ducks and a very  few woodcock to shoot annually puts into the field 150,222 armed men. In  1909 they killed about _9,000 deer!_    _New Jersey_, spending $30,000 in 1912 in efforts to restock her covers  with game, and with a population of 2,537,167, sent out in 1911 a total  army of 61,920 well-armed gunners. How can any of her game survive?    _New Hampshire_, with only 430,572 population, has 33,542 licensed  hunters,--equal to _thirty-three regiments of full strength!_    _Vermont_, with 355,956 people, sends out annually an army of 31,762 men  who hunt according to law; and in 1910 they killed 3,649 deer.    _Utah_, with only 373,351 population, had 27,800 men in the field after  her very small remnant of game! How can any wild thing of Utah escape?    _Montana_, population 376,053, had in 1911 an army of 59,291 well-armed  men, warring chiefly upon the big game, and swiftly exterminating it.    How long can any of the big game stand before the army of _two and  one-half million well-armed men_, eager and keen to kill, and out to get  an equivalent for their annual expenditure in guns, ammunition and other  expenses?    In addition to the hunters themselves, they are assisted by thousands of  expert guides, thousands of horses, thousands of dogs, hundreds of  automobiles and hundreds of thousands of tents. Each big-game hunter has  an experienced guide who knows the haunts and habits of the game, the  best feeding grounds, the best trails, and everything else that will aid  the hunter in taking the game at a disadvantage and destroying it. The  big-game rifles are of the highest power, the longest range, the  greatest accuracy and the best repeating mechanism that modern inventive  genius can produce. It is said that in Wyoming the Maxim silencer is now  being used. England has produced a weapon of a new type, called \"the  scatter rifle,\" which is intended for use on ducks. The best binoculars  are used in searching out the game, and horses carry the hunters and  guides as near as possible to the game. For bears, baits are freely  used, and in the pursuit of pumas, dogs are employed to the limit of the  available supply.    The deadliness of the automobile in hunting already is so apparent that  North Dakota has wisely and justly forbidden their use by law, (1911).  The swift machine enables city gunmen to penetrate game regions they  could not reach with horses, and hunt through from four to six  localities per day, instead of one only, as formerly. The use of  automobiles in hunting should be everywhere prohibited.    Every appliance and assistance that money can buy, the modern sportsman  secures to help him against the game. The game is beset during its  breeding season by various wild enemies,--foxes, cats, wolves, pumas,  lynxes, eagles, and many other predatory species. The only help that it  receives is in the form of an annual close season--_which thus far has  saved in America only a few local moose, white-tailed deer and a few  game birds, from steady and sure extermination_.    _The bag limits on which vast reliance is placed to preserve the wild  game, are a fraud, a delusion and a snare_! The few local exceptions  only prove the generality of the rule. In every state, without one  single exception, the bag limits are far too high, and the laws are of  deadly liberality. In many states, the bag limit laws on birds are an  absolute dead letter. Fancy the 125 wardens of New York enforcing the  bag-limit laws on 150,000 gunners! It is this horrible condition that is  enabling the licensed army of destruction to get in its deadly work on  the game, all over the world. In America, the over-liberality of the  laws are to blame for two-thirds of the carnival of slaughter, and the  successful evasions of the law are responsible for the other third.

'Before me! how mean you?'    'I mean,' replied the Crow (and he whispered it in the Lion's ear),  'Crop-ear, the Camel!'    'Now!' said the Lion, and he touched the ground, and afterwards both  ears, as he spoke, 'I have given him my pledge for his safety, and how  should I slay him?'    'Nay, Sire! I said not slay,' replied the Crow; 'it may be that he will  offer himself for food. To that your Majesty would not object?'    'I am parlous hungry,' muttered the Lion.    'Then the Crow went to find the Camel, and, bringing all together before  the King under some pretence or other, he thus addressed him:--    'Sire! our pains are come to nothing: we can get no food, and we behold  our Lord falling away,        'Of the Tree of State the root      Kings are--feed what brings the fruit.'    Take me, therefore, your Majesty, and break your fast upon me.\"    'Good Crow,' said the Lion, 'I had liefer die than do so.'    'Will your Majesty deign to make a repast upon me?' asked the Jackal.    'On no account!' replied the Lion.    'Condescend, my Lord,' said the Tiger, 'to appease your hunger with my  poor flesh.'    'Impossible!' responded the Lion.    'Thereupon Crop-ear, not to be behind in what seemed safe, made offer of  his own carcase, which was accepted before he had finished; the Tiger  instantly tearing his flank open, and all the rest at once devouring  him.    'The Brahman,' continued Night-cloud, 'suspected nothing more than did  the Camel; and when the third knave had broken his jest upon him for  bearing a dog, he threw it down, washed himself clean of the  contamination, and went home; while the knaves secured and cooked his  goat.'    'But, Night-cloud,' asked the Rajah, 'how couldst thou abide so long  among enemies, and conciliate them?'    'It is easy to play the courtier for a purpose,' said Night-cloud--        'Courtesy may cover malice; on their heads the woodmen bring,      Meaning all the while to burn them, logs and fagots--oh, my King!      And the strong and subtle river, rippling at the cedar's foot,      While it seems to lave and kiss it, undermines the hanging root.'    Indeed, it has been said--        'A wise man for an object's sake      His foe upon his back will take,      As with the Frogs once did the Snake.'    'How was that?' asked the Peacock-King. The Crow related:--      THE STORY OF THE FROGS AND THE OLD SERPENT    \"In a deserted garden there once lived a Serpent, 'Slow-coil' by name;  who had reached an age when he was no longer able to obtain his own  food. Lying listlessly by the edge of a pond, he was descried by a  certain Frog, and interrogated--    'Have you given up caring for food, Serpent?'    'Leave me, kindly Sir,' replied the subtle reptile; 'the griefs of a  miserable wretch like me cannot interest your lofty mind.'    'Let me at least hear them,' said the Frog, somewhat flattered.    'You must know, then, gracious Sir,' began the Serpent, 'that it is now  twenty years since here, in Brahmapoora, I bit the son of Kaundinya, a  holy Brahman; of which cruel bite he died. Seeing his boy dead,  Kaundinya abandoned himself to despair, and grovelled in his distress  upon the ground. Thereat came all his kinsmen, citizens of Brahmapoora,  and sat down with him, as the manner is--        'He who shares his brother's portion, be he beggar, be he lord,      Comes as truly, comes as duly, to the battle as the board;        Stands before the King to succor, follows to the pile to sigh;      He is friend and he is kinsman--less would make the name a lie.'    Then spoke a twice-passed Brahman,[21] Kapila by name, 'O Kaundinya!  thou dost forget thyself to lament thus. Hear what is written--        'Weep not! Life the hired nurse is, holding us a little space;      Death, the mother who doth take us back into our proper place.'        'Gone, with all their gauds and glories: gone, like peasants, are the              Kings,      Whereunto the world is witness, whereof all her record rings.'    What, indeed, my friend, is this mortal frame, that we should set store  by it?--        'For the body, daily wasting, is not seen to waste away,      Until wasted, as in water set a jar of unbaked clay.'        'And day after day man goeth near and nearer to his fate,      As step after step the victim thither where its slayers wait.'    Friends and kinsmen--they must all be surrendered! Is it not said--        'Like as a plank of drift-wood        Tossed on the watery main,      Another plank encountered,        Meets--touches--parts again;      So tossed, and drifting ever,        On life's unresting sea,      Men meet, and greet, and sever,        Parting eternally.'    Thou knowest these things, let thy wisdom chide thy sorrow, saying--        'Halt, traveller! rest i' the shade: then up and leave it!      Stay, Soul! take fill of love; nor losing, grieve it!'    But in sooth a wise man would better avoid love; for--        'Each beloved object born      Sets within the heart a thorn,      Bleeding, when they be uptorn.'    And it is well asked--        'When thine own house, this rotting frame, doth wither,      Thinking another's lasting--goest thou thither?'    What will be, will be; and who knows not--        'Meeting makes a parting sure,      Life is nothing but death's door.'    For truly--        'As the downward-running rivers never turn and never stay,      So the days and nights stream deathward, bearing human lives away.'    And though it be objected that--        'Bethinking him of darkness grim, and death's unshunned pain,      A man strong-souled relaxes hold, like leather soaked in rain.'    Yet is this none the less assured, that--        'From the day, the hour, the minute,        Each life quickens in the womb;      Thence its march, no falter in it,        Goes straight forward to the tomb.'    Form, good friend, a true idea of mundane matters; and bethink thee that  regret is after all but an illusion, an ignorance--        'An 'twere not so, would sorrow cease with years?      Wisdom sees aright what want of knowledge fears.'    'Kaundinya listened to all this with the air of a dreamer. Then rising  up he said, 'Enough! the house is hell to me--I will betake me to the  forest.'    'Will that stead you?' asked Kapila; 'nay--        'Seek not the wild, sad heart! thy passions haunt it;      Play hermit in thine house with heart undaunted;      A governed heart, thinking no thought but good,      Makes crowded houses holy solitude.'    To be master of one's self--to eat only to prolong life--to yield to  love no more than may suffice to perpetuate a family--and never to speak  but in the cause of truth, this,' said Kapila, 'is armor against grief.  What wouldst thou with a hermit's life--prayer and purification from  sorrow and sin in holy streams? Hear this!--        'Away with those that preach to us the washing off of sin--      Thine own self is the stream for thee to make ablutions in:      In self-restraint it rises pure--flows clear in tide of truth,      By widening banks of wisdom, in waves of peace and ruth.      Bathe there, thou son of Pandu! with reverence and rite,      For never yet was water wet could wash the spirit white.'    Resign thyself to loss. Pain exists absolutely. Ease, what is it but a  minute's alleviation?'    'It is nothing else,' said Kaundinya: 'I will resign myself!'  Thereupon,' the Serpent continued, 'he cursed me with the curse that I  should be a carrier of frogs, and so retired--and here remain I to do  according to the Brahman's malediction.'    'The Frog, hearing all this, went and reported it to Web-foot the  Frog-King, who shortly came himself for an excursion on the Serpent. He  was carried delightfully, and constantly employed the conveyance. But  one day observing the Serpent to be sluggish, he asked the reason.    'May it please you,' explained the Serpent, 'your slave has nothing to  eat.'    'Eat a few of my frogs,' said the King. 'I give you leave.'    'I thank your Majesty!' answered the Serpent, and forthwith he began to  eat the frogs, until the pond becoming clear, he finished with their  monarch himself. 'I also,' said Night-cloud, 'stooped to conquer, but  King Silver-sides is a good King, and I would your Majesty were at peace  with him.'    'Peace!' cried King Jewel-plume, 'shall I make peace with my vassal! I  have vanquished him--let him serve me!'    \"At this moment the Parrot came in. 'Sire!' said he, breathlessly,' the  Stork Strong-bill, Rajah of Ceylon, has raised the standard of revolt in  Jambudwipa, and claims the country.'    'What! what!' cried the King in a fury.    'Excellent good, Goose!' muttered the Minister. 'This is thy work!'    'Bid him but await me!' exclaimed the King, 'and I will tear him up like  a tree!'    'Ah, Sire,' said the Minister--        'Thunder for nothing, like December's cloud,      Passes unmarked: strike hard, but speak not loud.'    We cannot march without making peace first; our rear will be attacked.'    'Must it be so?' asked the King.    'My Liege, it must,' replied the Vulture.    'Make a peace then,' said the King, 'and make an end.'    'It is well,' observed the Minister, and set out for the Court of the  King Silver-sides. While he was yet coming, the Crane announced his  approach.    'Ah!' said the Swan-King, 'this will be another designing spy from the  enemy.'    'Misdoubt him not!' answered the Goose, smiling, 'it is the Vulture  Far-sight, a spirit beyond suspicion. Would your Majesty be as the Swan  that took the stars reflected in the pool for lily-buds, and being  deceived, would eat no lily-shoots by day, thinking them stars?'    'Not so! but treachery breeds mistrust,' replied the Rajah; is it not  written--        'Minds deceived by evil natures, from the good their faith withhold;      When hot conjee once has burned them, children blow upon the cold.'
