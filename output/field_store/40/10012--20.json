Here, as had been the case in former visits to the  inhabitants of that part of the country near which the ship now lay,  they were received with open arms, carried through the whole of the  place, and shown all that it contained. The town consisted of between  eighty and a hundred houses, and had only one fighting stage. Mr.  Cook, Mr. Banks, and Dr. Solander, happened to have with them a few  nails and ribands, and some paper, with which the people were so  highly gratified, that when the gentlemen went away, they filled the  English boat with dried fish, of which it appeared that they had laid  up large quantities.    A report was spread, that one of the men, that had been so rashly  fired upon by the officer who had visited the hippah, under the  pretence of fishing, was dead of his wounds. But, on the 29th, the  lieutenant had the great consolation of discovering that this report  was groundless. On the same day he went again on shore, upon the  western point of the inlet, and, from a hill of considerable height,  had a view of the coast to the north-west. The furthest land he could  see, in that quarter, was an island at the distance of about ten  leagues, lying not far from the main. Between this island and the  place were he stood, he discovered, close under the shore, several  other islands, forming many bays, in which there appeared to be good  anchorage for shipping. After he had set off the different points for  his survey, he erected another pile of stones, in which he left a  piece of silver coin, with some musket balls and beads, and a fragment  of an old pendant flying at the top.    On the 30th of January, the ceremony was performed of giving name to  the inlet where our voyagers now lay, and of erecting a memorial of  the visit which they had made to this place. The carpenter having  prepared two posts for the purpose, our commander ordered them to be  inscribed with the ship's name, and the dates of the year and the  month. One of these he set up at the watering place, hoisting the  union-flag upon the top of it; and the other he carried over to the  island that lies nearest the sea, and which is called by the natives  Motuara. He went first, accompanied by Mr. Monkhouse and Tupia, to the  neighbouring village, or hippah, where he met with an old man, who had  maintained a friendly intercourse with the English. To this old man,  and several Indians besides, the lieutenant, by means of Tupia,  explained his design, which, he informed them, was to erect a mark  upon the island, in order to shew to any other ship, which should  happen to come thither, that our navigators had been there before. To  this the inhabitants readily consented, and promised that they would  never pull it down. He then gave something to every one present, and  to the old man a silver threepence, and some spike-nails, with the  king's broad arrow cut deep upon them. These were things which Mr.  Cook thought were the most likely to be long preserved. After this, he  conveyed the post to the highest part of the island; and, having fixed  it firmly in the ground, hoisted upon it the union flag, and honoured  the inlet with the name of Queen Charlotte's Sound. At the same time,  he took formal possession of this and the adjacent country, in the  name and for the use of his Majesty King George the Third. The  ceremony was concluded by the gentlemen's drinking a bottle of wine to  her majesty's health; and the bottle being given to the old man, who  had attended them up the hill, he was highly delighted with his  present.    A philosopher, perhaps might inquire on what ground Lieutenant Cook  could take formal possession of this part of New Zealand, in the name  and _for the use_ of the King of Great Britain, when the country  was already inhabited, and of course belonged to those by whom it was  occupied, and whose ancestors might have resided in it for many  preceding ages. To this the best answer seems to be, that the  lieutenant, in the ceremony performed by him, had no reference to the  original inhabitants, or any intention to deprive them of their  natural rights, but only to preclude the claims of future European  navigators, who, under the auspices and for the benefit of their  respective states or kingdoms, might form pretensions, to which they  were not entitled by prior discovery.    On the 31st, our voyagers having completed their wooding, and filled  their water casks, Mr. Cook sent out two parties, one to cut and make  brooms, and another to catch fish. In the evening there was a strong  gale from the north-west, with such a heavy rain, that the little wild  musicians on shore suspended their song, which till now had been  constantly heard during the night with a pleasure that it was  impossible to lose without regret. The gale, on the 1st of February,  increased to a storm, with heavy gusts from the high land, one of  which broke the hawser, that had been fastened to the shore, and  induced the necessity of letting go another anchor. Though, towards  midnight, the gale became more moderate, the rain continued with so  much violence, that the brook, which supplied the ship with water,  overflowed its banks; in consequence of which ten small casks, that  had been filled the day before, were carried away, and,  notwithstanding the most diligent search for them, could not be  recovered.    The Endeavour, on Monday the 5th, got under sail; but the wind soon  failing, our commander was obliged again to come to anchor, a little  above Motuara. As he was desirous of making still further inquiries,  whether any memory of Tasman had been preserved in New Zealand, he  directed Tupia to ask of the old man before mentioned, who had come on  board to take his leave of the English gentlemen, whether he had ever  heard that such a vessel as theirs had before visited the country. To  this he replied in the negative; but said, that his ancestors had told  him, that there once had arrived a small vessel from a distant land,  called Ulimaroa, in which were four men, who upon their reaching the  shore were all killed. On being asked where this country lay, he  pointed to the northward. Of Ulimaroa, Lieutenant Cook had heard  something before, from the people about the Bay of Islands, who said,  that it had been visited by their ancestors. Tupia had also some  confused traditionary notions concerning it; but no certain conclusion  could be drawn either from his account or that of the old Indian.    Soon after the ship came to anchor the second time, Mr. Banks and Dr.  Solander, who had gone on shore to see if any gleanings of natural  knowledge remained, fell in, by accident, with the most agreeable  Indian family they had yet seen, and which afforded them a better  opportunity of remarking the personal subordination among the natives,  than had before offered. The whole behaviour of this family was  affable, obliging, and unsuspicious. It was matter of sincere regret  to the two gentlemen, that they had not sooner met with these people,  as a better acquaintance with the manners and disposition of the  inhabitants of the country might hence have been obtained in a day,  than had been acquired during the whole stay of the English upon the  coast.    When, on the 6th of February, Lieutenant Cook had gotten out of the  sound, he stood over to the eastward, in order to get the strait well  open before the tide of ebb approached. At seven in the evening, two  small islands, which lie off Cape Koamaroo, at the south-east head of  Queen Charlotte's Sound, bore east, at the distance of about four  miles. It was nearly calm, and the tide of ebb setting out, the  Endeavour, in a very short time, was carried by the rapidity of the  stream close upon one of the islands, which was a rock rising almost  perpendicularly out of the sea. The danger increased every moment, and  there was but one expedient to prevent the ship's being dashed to  pieces, the success of which a few moments would determine. She was  now within little more than a cable's length of the rock, and had  above seventy-five fathom water. But, upon dropping an anchor, and  veering above one hundred and fifty fathom of cable, she was happily  brought up. This, however would not have saved our navigators, if the  tide, which set south by east, had not, upon meeting with the island,  changed its direction to the south-east, and carried them beyond the  first point. In this situation they were not above two cables' length  from the rocks; and here they remained in the strength of the tide,  which set to the south-east, after the rate of at least five miles an  hour from a little after seven till midnight, when the tide abated,  and the vessel began to heave. By three in the morning, a light breeze  at north-west having sprung up, our voyagers sailed for the eastern  shore; though they made but little way, in consequence of the tide  being against them. The wind, however, having afterwards freshened,  and come to north and north-east, with this, and the tide of ebb, they  were in a short time hurried through the narrowest part of the strait,  and then stood away for the southernmost land they had in prospect.  There appeared, over this land, a mountain of stupendous height, which  was covered with snow. The narrowest part of the strait, through which  the Endeavour had been driven with such rapidity, lies between Cape  Tierawitte, on the coast of Eaheinomauwe, and Cape Koamaroo; the  distance between which our commander judged to be four or five  leagues. Notwithstanding the difficulties arising from this tide, now  its strength is known, the strait may be passed without danger.    Some of the officers started a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7787"],[0,"A Complete Grammar of Esperanto (#16)"],[1," general sum,  mass, or portion of the whole, without distinction of particulars.  An \"adjective\" of quantitative meaning, on the other hand, usually  indicates consideration of the individuals composing the sum or mass  named:       En urbo oni havas multe da bruo, in a city one has much noise.     Ni auxdis multajn bruojn, we heard many (different) noises.     Tie oni havas multe da plezuro, there one has much pleasure.     Oni havas multajn plezurojn tie,        people have many (different) pleasures there.                       THE DEMONSTRATIVE ADVERB OF QUANTITY.    104. The demonstrative adverb of quantity related to the demonstrative  pronoun \"tiu\" is \"tiom\", that (this) much, that many, that quantity, so  much, etc.:--       Mi donis tiom da mono al vi,        I gave that much (that amount of) money to you.     Mi acxetis tiom da viando, I bought that much meat.     Tiom de la libroj mi legis, that many of the books I read.                                RESULT CLAUSES.    105. A clause of result (also called a consecutive clause) expresses an  action or condition as due to, or resulting from, something indicated  in the main sentence, as \"he is so strong that he can do it,\" \"I had so  much pleasure that I laughed heartily.\" In Esperanto a result clause is  introduced by \"ke\", preceded (directly or in the main sentence) by an  adverb or adjective of manner, degree, or quantity:       Diogeno estis tiel sagxa greka viro ke Aleksandro lauxdis lin,        Diogenes was such a wise Greek man that Alexander praised him.     Mi havis tiom da plezuro ke mi tre ridis,        I had so much pleasure that I laughed very much.     Gxi estas tia vilagxo ke mi sxatas logxi tie,        it is such (that sort of) a village that I like to live there.                                     VOCABULARY       acxeti = to buy.                   kontuzo = bruise.     asparago = asparagus.              lakto = milk.     brasiko = cabbage.                 legomo = vegetable.     butiko = store, shop.              ovo = egg.     frago = strawberry.                pizo = pea.     funto = pound.                     sabato = Saturday.     glaso = glass, tumbler.            tiom = that much (104).     jxauxdo = Thursday.                vendredo = Friday.     kremo = cream.                     vilagxo = village.                                   EN LA BUTIKO.    Hodiaux matene mi iris kun la patrino al la plej granda butiko en nia  vilagxo. Tie sxi acxetis tiom da legomoj kaj fruktoj ke ni tute ne povis  porti ilin. Tial juna knabo venis kun ni, kaj portis kelke da ili por  ni. La patrino ne acxetis tiel multe je vendredo, sed hodiaux estas  sabato, kaj sxi volis acxeti legomojn por dimancxo, cxar dimancxe oni  ne povas iri en la butikojn. Tial sabate oni kutime acxetas suficxe  por la mangxoj de sabato kaj dimancxo. Meze de la butiko staras multe  da bareloj. En cxi tiuj oni trovas grandan nombron da fresxaj puraj  legomoj. La patrino acxetis tiel multe da asparago kaj novaj pizoj, kaj  tiel grandan sakon da terpomoj, ke la tablo restis preskaux nuda. Mi  vidis brasikon tie, sed tiun legomon mi malsxatas, kvankam oni diras  ke gxi estas tre bona legomo. Antaux ol foriri de la butiko la patrino  acxetis kelke da ovoj, kaj rigardis la fruktojn en bareloj apud la  pordo. Ili sxajnis tiel bonaj ke sxi acxetis kelkajn maturajn pomojn  kaj skatolon da fragoj. Dum oni donis al sxi la fruktojn, mi acxetis  kelkajn funtojn da sukero. Tiam ni estis pretaj por foriri el la butiko.  Sur la vojo ni auxdis tiel grandan bruon ke mi lasis la patrinon kaj  kuris trans la straton. Mi trovis tie infanon,la filon de nia najbaro.  Li faris la bruon, cxar li falis de la arbo antaux sia domo, kaj tre  lauxte ploris. Li diris al mi ke li havas multajn kontuzojn sur la kapo.  Cxar mi bone konas la infanon, mi demandis \"Cxu vi volas grandan rugxan  pomon? Mi havas tian pomon por vi.\" Li tuj kaptis la pomon, kaj mi  foriris. Tiam la patrino kaj mi iris al la domo.                             SENTENCES FOR TRANSLATION.    1. I shall go to the village today with my younger sister. 2.

THE INTERROGATIVE PRONOUN.    106. The interrogative pronoun (and pronominal adjective) is \"kiu\",  who, which. Since the use of this pronoun indicates a question, the  sentence containing it does not need the interrogative adverb \"cxu\"  (30):         Kiu vokas vin? Who calls you?     Kiun vi vokas? Whom do you call?     Kiuj el vi vokis nin? Which (ones) of you called us?     Kiujn li helpis? Whom (which ones) did he help?     Kiun tagon vi venos? What day will you come?     Kiujn legomojn vi preferas? What vegetables do you prefer?     Mi miras kiun libron vi acxetis? I wonder which book you bought?    107. The interrogative pronoun \"kiu\" has a possessive or genitive form  \"kies\", whose:       En kies domo vi logxas? In whose house do you reside?     Kies amikojn vi vizitis? Whose friends did you visit?                           THE PRESENT ACTIVE PARTICIPLE.    108. A participle is a \"verbal adjective\", as in \"a \"crying\" child.\"  It agrees like other adjectives with the word modified (19, 24). The  participle from a transitive verb (22) may take a direct object, and a  participle expressing motion may be followed by an accusative indicating  direction of motion (46). The present active participle, expressing what  the word modified \"is doing\", ends in \"-anta,\" as \"vidanta\", seeing,  \"iranta\", going:       La ploranta infano volas dormi. The crying child wishes to sleep.     Mi vidas la falantajn foliojn, I see the falling leaves.     Kiu estas la virino acxetanta ovojn? Who is the woman buying eggs?     Mi parolis al la viroj irantaj vilagxon.        I talked to the men (who were) going toward the village.                                  COMPOUND TENSES.    109. A participle may be used predicatively with a form of \"esti\", as  \"Mi estas demandanta\", I am asking, \"La viro estas acxetanta\", the man  is buying. Such combinations are called \"compound tenses\", in contrast  to the \"simple\" or \"aoristic\" tenses.    [Footnote: An aoristic tense consists of but one word (ending in  \"-as\", \"-os\", etc.) and expresses an act or state as a whole, without  specifying whether it is finished, still in progress, or yet begun.]    Compound tenses occur less often in Esperanto than in English, and an  aoristic Esperanto tense may often be translated by an English compound  tense, as \"La birdoj flugas\", the birds are flying. When used to  form a compound tense, the verb \"esti\" is called the \"auxiliary verb\".  No other verb is ever used as an auxiliary (a simpler method than in  English, which uses \"be\", \"have\", \"do\", \"will\", \"shall\", \"would\", etc.).                           THE PROGRESSIVE PRESENT TENSE.    110. The compound tense formed by using the present active participle  with the present tense of \"esti\" is called the \"progressive present  tense\". It differs from the aoristic present by expressing an action  as definitely in progress, or a condition as continuously existing, at  the moment of speaking. The conjugation of \"vidi\" in this tense is as  follows:       mi estas vidanta, I am seeing.     vi estas vidanta, you are seeing.     li (sxi, gxi) estas vidanta, he (she, it) is seeing.     ni estas vidantaj, we are seeing.     vi estas vidantaj, you (plural) are seeing.     ili estas vidantaj, they are seeing.                                 THE SUFFIX \"-EJ-\".    111. Words expressing the place where the action indicated by the root  occurs, or where the object indicated by the root may be found, are  formed by inserting the suffix \"-ej-\" before the noun-ending:       cxevalejo, stable (from \"cxevalo\", horse).     dormejo, dormitory (from \"dormi\", to sleep).     herbejo, meadow (from \"herbo\", grass).     logxejo, lodging-place, dwelling (from \"logxi\", to dwell, to lodge).    [Footnote: Similar formations are made in English with the suffix \"-y\",  as \"bakery\", \"bindery\", \"grocery\", etc. This suffix is equivalent to the  \"-ei\" in German \"Baeckerei\", bakery, \"Druckerei\", printing-office, etc.,  and to the \"-ie\" in French \"patisserie\", pastry-shop, \"imprimerie\",  printing-shop, etc.]                                     VOCABULARY       alia = other, another.             kuiri = to cook.     baki = to bake.                    kurteno = curtain.     dika = thick.                      kutimo = custom.     facila = easy.                     leciono = lesson.     familio = family.                  lerni = to learn.     kanapo = sofa.                     pano = bread.     kies = whose (107).                persono = person.     kiu = who (106).                   salono = parlor.
