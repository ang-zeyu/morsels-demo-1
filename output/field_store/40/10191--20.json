[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12984"],[0,"Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions â€” Volume 1 (#17)"],[1,"from a brief experience as city editor of  the St. Joseph Gazette in 1875-76. The time is fixed by the presence  of \"Trotty\" in the gypsy circle, who was the best bit of news he  \"managed to acquire\" in the days whereof he wrote:      _Oh, many a peck of apples and of peaches did I get    When I helped 'em run the local on the \"St. Jo Gazette.\"_    Judge Henry W. Burke, of St. Joseph, is authority for this story of  the time when he was associated with Field on the Gazette: Burke had  been sent out to report a \"swell society event\" in the eastern part of  the city. Nearly all the prominent people of St. Joseph were present  and the names of all were published. Burke's story of the affair was a  column long, and after it was written Field got hold of the copy and  at the end of the list of those present added, \"and last but not least  the handsome and talented society editor of the Gazette, H.W. Burke.\"  The feelings of the young reporter and embryo judge may be imagined.    But a few months of \"whooping up locals on the St. Jo Gazette\" were  enough for Eugene, who pined for the broader field and more congenial  associations of St. Louis. Thither he returned in the spring of 1876,  and the Evening Journal, being by this time consolidated with the  Times, he became an editorial writer and paragrapher on the hyphenated  publication. He also resumed the eccentric semi-bohemian life which  Mr. Buskett has rather suggested than described. He had little or no  business ability, had no use for money except to spend it, and  therefore early adopted the plan of leaving to Mrs. Field the  management of their household expenditures. To her, then, as  throughout his life, was paid his weekly stipend--often depleted by  the drafts for the \"usual V\" or the \"necessary X\" which he was wont to  draw in advance from the cashier almost every week.    Before the newspaper cashier had risen as a life-saving station on the  horizon of Eugene Field's constant impecuniosity, his father's  executor, Mr. Gray, had been the object of his intermittent appeals  for funds to meet pressing needs. The means he invented to wheedle the  generous, but methodical, executor out of these appropriations  afforded Field more genuine pleasure than the success that attended  them. The coin they yielded passed through his fingers like water  through a sieve, but the enjoyment of his happy schemes abided in his  memory and also in that of his constant friend always. One of Field's  most effective methods of securing an advance from Mr. Gray was the  threat of going on the stage under the assumed name of Melvin L. Gray.  On one occasion Field approached him for money for living expenses,  and being met with what appeared to be an unrelenting negative, coolly  said: \"Very well, if you cannot advance it to me out of the estate I  shall be compelled to go on the stage. But as I cannot keep my own  name I have decided to assume yours, and shall have lithographs struck  off at once. They will read, 'To-night, M.L. Gray, Banjo and Specialty  Artist.'\" It is needless to say that the much-needed funds were found.  But whether they went to the payment of living expenses, to the  importunity of some threatening creditor, or were divided between the  joys of the bibliomaniac and the bon vivant, Field in his most  confiding humor never disclosed to me.    But this I know, that one of these always respectful, if apparently  threatening, appeals to Mr. Gray, was the basis for one of the few  newspaper attacks on Eugene Field that he resented deeply. Some time  after he had left St. Louis and was engaged on the Denver Tribune, the  Spectator, a weekly paper of the former city, contained the following  gossip regarding him which was written in a thoughtless rather than an  intentionally inimical spirit:    One of the cleverest young journalists of this city, a few years ago,  was Mr. Eugene Field, whose charming short poems and witty paragraphs  still occasionally find their way into our paper from Denver, where he  is now located. Mr. Field was the happy possessor of one of those  sunny dispositions which is thoroughly antagonistic to trouble of  every description; he absolutely refused to entertain the black demon  under any pretext whatever, and after spending a small fortune with  the easy grace of a prince, he settled down to doing without one with  equal grace and nonchalance, in a manner more creditable to himself  than satisfying to his creditors. Did his hatter or tailor present an  untimely bill, the gay debonnaire Eugene would scribble on the back  thereof an impromptu rhyme expressive of his deep regret at not being  able to offer the cash instead, and return the same with an airy grace  that the renowned orator, J. Wilkins Micawber, himself might have  envied.    While the intellectual prominences upon the cranium of our friend and  fellow-citizen had been well looked to, Dame Nature totally neglected  to develop his bump of veneration; age possessed no qualities, wealth  and position no prerogatives, which this singularly constituted young  man felt bound to respect. When his father's executor, an able and  exceedingly dignified member of the St. Louis bar, would refuse to  respond to his frequent demands for moneyed advances, the young  reprobate would coolly elevate his heels to a point in dangerous  proximity to the old gentleman's nose, and threaten to go upon the  stage, taking his guardian's honored name as a stage pseudonym and  representing himself to be his son. This threat generally sufficed to  bring the elder gentleman to terms, as he knew his charge's ability to  execute as well as to threaten.    He was an inveterate joker, and his tendency to break out without  regard to fitness of time or place into some mad prank made him almost  a terror to his friends. On one occasion he informed a young lady  friend that he did not think he would be able to come to her wedding  because he had such a terrible toothache. \"Then why not have your  tooth pulled out?\" said the young lady. \"I never thought of that,\"  quoth Eugene gravely; \"I guess I will.\" When the wedding day arrived,  among the other bridal gifts came a small box bearing Mr. Field's  card, and reposing on a velvet cushion inside was the identical tooth  which the bride had advised him to have extracted, and in the cavity  where had once throbbed the agonizing nerve was neatly stuffed a  fifty-dollar bill.    The recollection of the many amusing traits and freaks of this  versatile genius affords amusement to the innumerable friends of his  to this day. But time which sobers us all has doubtless taken some of  the foam and sparkle from this rare spirit, although it would be hard  to convince his friends that he will ever be anything but the gay and  debonnaire Eugene.    Mr. Gray, who vouches for the general accuracy of the story of the  strange wedding present, with its costly filling, preserves among his  most cherished mementoes of his foster son-in-law, if I may be allowed  the expression, Field's prompt repudiation of that paragraph in the  above which charged him with lack of respect for one from whom he had  received every evidence of affection:      DENVER, June 25, 1883.      DEAR MR. GRAY,      A copy of last Saturday's St. Louis Spectator has just arrived and I    am equally surprised, pained and indignant to find in it a personal    article about myself which represents me in the untruthful light of    having been disrespectful and impudent to you. I believe you will    bear me out when I say that my conduct towards you has upon all    occasions been respectful and gentlemanly. I may not have been able    to repay you the many obligations you have placed me under, but I    have always regarded you with feelings of affectionate gratitude and    I am deeply distressed lest the article referred to may create a    widely different impression. Of course it makes no difference to you,    but as gratitude is about all I have in this world to bestow on those    who are good and kind to me, it is not right that I should be    advertised--even in a joking way--as an ingrate.      Yours sincerely,      EUGENE FIELD.    This letter is valuable in more ways than the one which it was so  unnecessarily written to serve. It is a negative admission of the  general faithfulness of the impression left by Field upon those  familiar with his life in St. Louis, and the reference to gratitude as  all he had to bestow upon his true friends will be recognized as  genuine by all who ever came near enough to his inner life to  appreciate its sweetness as well as its lightness. As for his airy  method of disposing of insistent creditors I have no doubt that the  rhymes on the backs of their bills more often than not were more to  them than the dollars and cents on their faces.    During the second period of his life in St. Louis two sons were born  to Field and his wife, Melvin G., named after the \"Dear Mr. Gray,\" of  the foregoing letter, and Eugene, Jr., who, being born when the  Pinafore craze was at its height, received the nickname of \"Pinny,\"  which has adhered to him to the present time. The fact that Melvin of  all the children of Eugene Field was never called by any other name by  a father prone to giving pet names, more or less fanciful, to every  person and thing with which he came in contact, is, I take it, an even  more sincere tribute to the high respect and love, if not reverence,  in which he held Melvin's godfather.    The third son and last child born to Field during the time of which I  am now writing appeared upon the scene, with his two eyes of wondrous  blue, very like his father's, at Kansas City, whither the family had  moved in the year 1880. Although he was duly christened Frederick,  this newcomer was promptly nicknamed \"Daisy,\" because, forsooth,  Field one day happened to fancy that his two eyes looked like daisies  peeping up at him from the grass. The similitude was far"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12985"],[0,"Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions â€” Volume 2 (#17)"],[1,"entine.'\"    The \"Winfreda\" here referred to is one of the poems upon which Field  exhausted his ingenuity in composing with the verbal phraseology of  different periods of archaic English. The version which appears in his  \"Songs and Other Verse\" is his first attempt at versification \"in pure  Anglo-Saxon,\" as he says in a note to one of the manuscript copies.  Field intended to render this finally into \"current English,\" but, so  far as I know, he never got to it.    The publication of numerous poems and tales in the Daily News during  the years 1888 and 1889, together with those printed in America,  culminating in \"The Golden Week,\" in July of the latter year, was but  the prelude to the issue of his two \"Little Books,\" according to a  unique plan over which we spent much thought and consumed endless  luncheons of coffee and apple pie. As I have intimated, Field was  quite piqued over the cavalier reception of \"Culture's Garland,\" and  was determined that his next venture in book form should be between  boards, a perfect specimen of book-making, and restricted, as far as  his judgment could decide, to the best in various styles which he had  written prior to the date of publication. He did not wish to entrust  this to any publisher, and finally hit upon the idea of publishing  privately, by subscription, which was carried out.    The circular, which was prepared and mailed to a selected list of my  friends, as well as his, will best explain the rather unusual method  of this venture:      PRIVATE CIRCULAR      CHICAGO, February 23d, 1889.      Dear Sir:--It is proposed to issue privately, and as soon as    possible, a limited edition of my work in verse and in prose.    Negotiations for the publication of two volumes are now in progress    with the University Press at Cambridge.      1. It is proposed to print one volume (200 pages) of my best verse,    and one volume (300 pages) of tales and sketches. These books will    be printed upon heavy uncut paper and in the best style known to the    University printer.      2. The edition will be limited to 200 sets (each set of two    volumes), and none will be put upon sale.      3. It is proposed to pay for the publication by subscriptions. One    hundred (100) shares are offered to my personal friends at ten    dollars a share, each subscriber to receive two (2) sets of the    books.      If you wish to subscribe to this enterprise, please fill out the    accompanying blank (next page) and send it before March 25th, with    money-order, draft, or check, to Mr. Slason Thompson, editor of    \"America,\" who has consented to act as custodian of the funds    necessary to the accomplishment of the purpose specified.      Very sincerely yours,      EUGENE FIELD.    The accompanying blank addressed to me read:      Find enclosed ------ for ------ ($    ) representing my subscription    for ------ share ------ in the two-volume publication of Eugene    Field's original work.      ------    ------ P.O. Address.    If Field had any doubts as to the estimation in which he was held by  his friends, they were dispelled by the ready response to this appeal,  while the generous words accompanying many of the orders were well  calculated to warm the cockles of a colder heart than beat within the  breast of \"The Good Knight _sans peur et sans monnaie_.\" Many persons  to whom circulars had not been sent heard of the proposed publication  and wrote asking to be allowed to subscribe. The largest single  subscription was for five shares. There were three for two shares, and  all the rest were for one share each, many echoed the \"Certainly! and  glad of the chance,\" which was Stuart Robson's response. F.J.V. Skiff,  Field's old associate on the Denver Tribune, added a postscript to his  order, saying, \"And wish I could take it all,\" while Victor F. Lawson,  in a personal note to me accompanying his order, wrote, \"If you run  short on this scheme I shall be glad to increase my subscription  whenever advised that it is needed.\" This spirit pervaded the replies  to our circular and gave Field keener pleasure than he ever  experienced through the publication of any of his other books.    Chicago, as was to be expected, took a majority of the shares; Denver  came next, and then Kansas City. Comparatively few shares were taken  in the East, for Field's fame had scarcely yet penetrated that region.  But the names of Charles A. Dana, of Whitelaw Reid, and of Field's  \"Cousin Kate\" were early among the subscribers. His friends among the  stage folk responded numerously, and so did journalists and railway  men. There were only some half dozen bibliomaniacs on the list, for  Field had not then become the poet, torment, and idol of the devotees  of rare and eccentric editions. To remind them of the unusual  opportunity they missed, let me recall the negotiations for the making  of this original _edition de luxe_, which was not published for  profit, but as an example of the excellence of simplicity and  clearness in printing. From the start Field insisted that everything  about the \"Little Books\" should be American, and the best procurable  of their kind. The letters from John Wilson & Son show the progress of  the negotiations for the printing of the two books, which were carried  on in full assurance that there would be no failure of funds to carry  out the enterprise. I quote their first reply to my request for an  estimate on the work:      CAMBRIDGE, MASS., February 5, 1889.    SLASON THOMPSON, ESQ.,    Dear Sir:--In your request for a rough estimate of two volumes of 200  pages each, on paper 5 x 8 and printed page 2-1/2 x 4-1/2 you forgot  to state the number of copies desired and the size of the type. We  enclose two samples of paper that we can find. We have doubts about  finding enough of the 5 x 8, but think we can that of the 5 x 7-1/2.  We prefer the former. If the edition is small--say 100 or 150--we  can, we think, scrape up enough of the 5 x 8. The size of your page  could not, we think, be improved on. We also enclose samples of long  primer, bourgeois and brevier sizes of type. [Here followed a detailed  estimate on 250 copies of bourgeois type of $668.70 for the two  volumes.]    We should be most happy to execute the work. Hoping to hear from you  again,    We are respectfully yours,    JOHN WILSON & SON.      As soon as we had arrived at a clearer idea of our desires, and also  of our means, I again communicated with Messrs. Wilson & Son, and  received the following reply:      CAMBRIDGE, April 4th, 1889.    Dear Sir:--After much delay we have succeeded in finding a paper  manufacturer in Massachusetts (the only one in America) who has just  commenced making a paper similar to that used in \"Riley's  Old-Fashioned Roses\" (printed on English hand-made paper which I had  sent them). To-morrow we shall send you a specimen (printed), also a  specimen of another paper which we used some time ago on an _edition  de luxe_ of \"Memorials of Canterbury\" and of Westminster Abbey for  Randolph & Co., of New York. No. 1 is a hand-made paper 16 x 20/28, at  60c. a lb.; No. 2, a machine made 20 x 22/60 at 20c. a lb.    ESTIMATE No. 1.    For comp. and electro (say 500 pages in the  two vols.) about                        $400.00    For 8 boxes for plates, 75 cts.            6.00    For 250 copies presswork (2 vols.), 66 forms,    $1.50                                   99.00    For Paper, 16 x 20/28, 20 reams, $16.80  336.00    For Binding 250 copies, 500 (2 vols.) 25c.  Parchment back and corners               125.00    For Dies, say                             10.00                                           ______                                          $976.00    Alterations from copy, 50 cts. an hour. (The estimate on No. 2 paper  was $727.00.)    We return \"Riley.\" Both of these papers have the rough, or deckle,  edge.    We are anxious to make this book in the _best style_, and of American  materials if possible.    Respectfully yours,    JOHN WILSON & SON.      Three things in estimate No. 1 caught Field's fancy--yea, four; the  paper was to be hand made, deckle edge, of American manufacture, but,  above all, sixty cents a pound. As a contrast to the stiff bleached  Manila of \"Culture's Garland,\" dear at a cent a pound, this sixty  cents a pound decided Field in favor of No. 1, though we had to  economize on everything else to get the job done within the $1,100 we  had in bank before we gave the order. The No. 2, having a softer  surface, would have given us a better printed page, and its cost would  have enabled us to embellish the edition with a steel-plate engraving  of Field, as had been our intention, but the thought of using the most  expensive American paper procurable for his \"Little Books\" outweighed  every other consideration, and we forwarded the copy of the two  volumes to John Wilson & Son, with orders to go ahead and push  publication.    It was well into the middle of the fall when I received the following  note from the printers, showing that the work had been completed:      University Press,  CAMBRIDGE, MASS., October 19th, 1889.    SLASON THOMPSON, ESQ.    DEAR SIR: Herewith please find our bill for printing and binding  _Profitable Tales_ and _Western Verse_.    We shall send the two copies of each volume (unnumbered) to secure the  copyright, and when the certificate is received, will send it to you.  These copies are over and above the 250 copies sent to you.    Regretting the delay incident to the bringing out of two such volumes,  and hoping that the author and his friends may be gratified and  pleased with their mechanical execution, we are,    Respectfully yours,    JOHN WILSON & SON.      It is needless to say that both the author and his friends were  gratified and pleased with the mechanical execution of the \"Little  Books,\" while Field's admirers have never wearied in their admiration  of their contents. Every cent of the fund subscribed for these"]]]
