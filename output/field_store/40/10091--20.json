But the purity of the water in peaty lagoons is   observable elsewhere than in the delta of the Mississippi.  What can   be more transparent than many a pool surrounded by quaking bogs,   fringed, as they are in Ireland, with a ring of white water-lilies,   which you dare not stoop to pick, lest the peat, bending inward,   slide you down into that clear dark gulf some twenty feet in depth,   bottomed and walled with yielding ooze, from which there is no   escape?  Most transparent, likewise, is the water of the West Indian   swamps.  Though it is of the colour of coffee, or rather of dark   beer, and so impregnated with gases that it produces fever or cholera   when drunk, yet it is--at least when it does not mingle with the salt   water--so clear, that one might see every marking on a boa-  constrictor or alligator, if he glided along the bottom under the   canoe.    But now comes the question--Even if all this be true, how were the   forests covered up in shale and sandstone, one after another?    By gradual sinking of the land, one would suppose.    If we find, as we may find in a hundred coal-pits, trees rooted as   they grew, with their trunks either standing up through the coal, and   through the sandstone above the coal; their bark often remaining as   coal while their inside is filled up with sandstone, has not our   common-sense a right to say--The land on which they grew sank below   the water-line; the trees were killed; and the mud and sand which   were brought down the streams enveloped their trunks?  As for the   inside being full of sandstone, have we not all seen hollow trees?    Do we not all know that when a tree dies its wood decays first, its   bark last?  It is so, especially in the Tropics.  There one may see   huge dead trees with their bark seemingly sound, and their inside a   mere cavern with touchwood at the bottom; into which caverns one used   to peep with some caution.  For though one might have found inside   only a pair of toucans, or parrots, or a whole party of jolly little   monkeys, one was quite as likely to find a poisonous snake four or   five feet long, whose bite would have very certainly prevented me   having the pleasure of writing this book.    Now is it not plain that if such trees as that sunk, their bark would   be turned into lignite, and at last into coal, while their insides   would be silted up with mud and sand?  Thus a core or pillar of hard   sandstone would be formed, which might do to the collier of the   future what they are too apt to do now in the Newcastle and Bristol   collieries.  For there, when the coal is worked out below, the   sandstone stems--\"coal-pipes\" as the colliers call them--in the roof   of the seam, having no branches, and nothing to hold them up but   their friable bark of coal, are but too apt to drop out suddenly,   killing or wounding the hapless men below.    Or again, if we find--as we very often find--as was found at   Parkfield Colliery, near Wolverhampton, in the year 1814--a quarter   of an acre of coal-seam filled. with stumps of trees as they grew,   their trunks broken off and lying in every direction, turned into   coal, and flattened, as coal-fossils so often are, by the weight of   the rock above--should we not have a right to say--These trees were   snapped off where they grew by some violent convulsion; by a storm,   or by a sudden inrush of water owing to a sudden sinking of the land,   or by the very earthquake shock itself which sank the land?    But what evidence have we of such sinkings?  The plain fact that you   have coal-seam above coal-seam, each with its bed of under-clay; and   that therefore the land MUST have sunk ere the next bed of soil could   have been deposited, and the next forest have grown on it.    In one of the Rocky Mountain coal-fields there are more than thirty   seams of coal, each with its under-clay below it.  What can that mean   but thirty or more subsidences of the land, and the peat of thirty or   more forests or peat-mosses, one above the other?  And now if any   reader shall say, Subsidence?  What is this quite new element which   you have brought into your argument?  You told us that you would   reason from the known to the unknown.  What do we know of subsidence?    You offered to explain the thing which had gone on once by that which   is going on now.  Where is subsidence going on now upon the surface   of our planet?  And where, too, upheaval, such as would bring us   these buried forests up again from under the sea-level, and make   them, like our British coal-field, dry land once more?    The answer is--Subsidence and elevation of the land are common now,   probably just as common as they were in any age of this planet's   history.    To give two instances, made now notorious by the writings of   geologists.  As lately as 1819 a single earthquake shock in Cutch, at   the mouth of the Indus, sunk a tract of land larger than the Lake of   Geneva in some places to a depth of eighteen feet, and converted it   into an inland sea.  The same shock raised, a few miles off, a   corresponding sheet of land some fifty miles in length, and in some   parts sixteen miles broad, ten feet above the level of the alluvial   plain, and left it to be named by the country-people the \"Ullah   Bund,\" or bank of God, to distinguish it from the artificial banks in   the neighbourhood.    Again:  in the valley of the Mississippi--a tract which is now, it   would seem, in much the same state as central England was while our   coal-fields were being laid down--the earthquakes of 1811-12 caused   large lakes to appear suddenly in many parts of the district, amid   the dense forests of cypress.  One of these, the \"Sunk Country,\" near   New Madrid, is between seventy and eighty miles in length, and thirty   miles in breadth, and throughout it, as late as 1846, \"dead trees   were conspicuous, some erect in the water, others fallen, and strewed   in dense masses over the bottom, in the shallows, and near the   shore.\"  I quote these words from Sir Charles Lyell's \"Principles of   Geology\" (11th edit.), vol. i. p. 453.  And I cannot do better than   advise my readers, if they wish to know more of the way in which coal   was formed, to read what is said in that book concerning the Delta of   the Mississippi, and its strata of forests sunk where they grew, and   in some places upraised again, alternating with beds of clay and   sand, vegetable soil, recent sea-shells, and what not, forming, to a   depth of several hundred feet, just such a mass of beds as exists in   our own coal-fields at this day.    If, therefore, the reader wishes to picture to himself the scenery of   what is now central England, during the period when our coal was   being laid down, he has only, I believe, to transport himself in   fancy to any great alluvial delta, in a moist and warm climate,   favourable to the growth of vegetation.  He has only to conceive   wooded marshes, at the mouth of great rivers, slowly sinking beneath   the sea; the forests in them killed by the water, and then covered up   by layers of sand, brought down from inland, till that new layer   became dry land, to carry a fresh crop of vegetation.  He has thus   all that he needs to explain how coal-measures were formed.  I myself   saw once a scene of that kind, which I should be sorry to forget; for   there was, as I conceived, coal, making, or getting ready to be made,   before my eyes:  a sheet of swamp, sinking slowly into the sea; for   there stood trees, still rooted below high-water mark, and killed by   the waves; while inland huge trees stood dying, or dead, from the   water at their roots.  But what a scene--a labyrinth of narrow   creeks, so narrow that a canoe could not pass up, haunted with   alligators and boa-constrictors, parrots and white herons, amid an   inextricable confusion of vegetable mud, roots of the alder-like   mangroves, and tangled creepers hanging from tree to tree; and   overhead huge fan-palms, delighting in the moisture, mingled with   still huger broad-leaved trees in every stage of decay.  The drowned   vegetable soil of ages beneath me; above my head, for a hundred feet,   a mass of stems and boughs, and leaves and flowers, compared with   which the richest hothouse in England was poor and small.  But if the   sinking process which was going on continued a few hundred years, all   that huge mass of wood and leaf would be sunk beneath the swamp, and   covered up in mud washed down from the mountains, and sand driven in   from the sea; to form a bed many feet thick, of what would be first   peat, then lignite, and last, it may be, coal, with the stems of   killed trees standing up out of it into the new mud and sand-beds   above it, just as the Sigillariae and other stems stand up in the   coal-beds both of Britain and of Nova Scotia; while over it a fresh   forest would grow up, to suffer the same fate--if the sinking process   went on--as that which had preceded it.    That was a sight not easily to be forgotten.  But we need not have   gone so far from home, at least, a few hundred years ago, to see an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1027"],[0,"The Lone Star Ranger: A Romance of the Border (#17)"],[1,"arm. Every second  her fury increased.    \"HELP! HELP! HELP!\" she shrieked, in a voice that must have penetrated  to the remotest cabin in the valley.    \"Let go! Let go!\" cried Duane, low and sharp. He still held his gun in  his right hand, and it began to be hard for him to ward the woman off.  His coolness had gone with her shriek for help. \"Let go!\" he repeated,  and he shoved her fiercely.    Suddenly she snatched a rifle off the wall and backed away, her strong  hands fumbling at the lever. As she jerked it down, throwing a shell  into the chamber and cocking the weapon, Duane leaped upon her. He  struck up the rifle as it went off, the powder burning his face.    \"Jennie, run out! Get on a horse!\" he said.    Jennie flashed out of the door.    With an iron grasp Duane held to the rifle-barrel. He had grasped it  with his left hand, and he gave such a pull that he swung the crazed  woman off the floor. But he could not loose her grip. She was as strong  as he.    \"Kate! Let go!\"    He tried to intimidate her. She did not see his gun thrust in her face,  or reason had given way to such an extent to passion that she did not  care. She cursed. Her husband had used the same curses, and from her  lips they seemed strange, unsexed, more deadly. Like a tigress she  fought him; her face no longer resembled a woman's. The evil of that  outlaw life, the wildness and rage, the meaning to kill, was even in  such a moment terribly impressed upon Duane.    He heard a cry from outside--a man's cry, hoarse and alarming.    It made him think of loss of time. This demon of a woman might yet block  his plan.    \"Let go!\" he whispered, and felt his lips stiff. In the grimness of that  instant he relaxed his hold on the rifle-barrel.    With sudden, redoubled, irresistible strength she wrenched the rifle  down and discharged it. Duane felt a blow--a shock--a burning agony  tearing through his breast. Then in a frenzy he jerked so powerfully  upon the rifle that he threw the woman against the wall. She fell and  seemed stunned.    Duane leaped back, whirled, flew out of the door to the porch. The sharp  cracking of a gun halted him. He saw Jennie holding to the bridle of his  bay horse. Euchre was astride the other, and he had a Colt leveled,  and he was firing down the lane. Then came a single shot, heavier, and  Euchre's ceased. He fell from the horse.    A swift glance back showed to Duane a man coming down the lane. Chess  Alloway! His gun was smoking. He broke into a run. Then in an instant he  saw Duane, and tried to check his pace as he swung up his arm. But that  slight pause was fatal. Duane shot, and Alloway was falling when his gun  went off. His bullet whistled close to Duane and thudded into the cabin.    Duane bounded down to the horses. Jennie was trying to hold the plunging  bay. Euchre lay flat on his back, dead, a bullet-hole in his shirt, his  face set hard, and his hands twisted round gun and bridle.    \"Jennie, you've nerve, all right!\" cried Duane, as he dragged down  the horse she was holding. \"Up with you now! There! Never mind--long  stirrups! Hang on somehow!\"    He caught his bridle out of Euchre's clutching grip and leaped astride.  The frightened horses jumped into a run and thundered down the lane into  the road. Duane saw men running from cabins. He heard shouts. But  there were no shots fired. Jennie seemed able to stay on her horse, but  without stirrups she was thrown about so much that Duane rode closer and  reached out to grasp her arm.    Thus they rode through the valley to the trail that led up over, the  steep and broken Rim Rock. As they began to climb Duane looked back. No  pursuers were in sight.    \"Jennie, we're going to get away!\" he cried, exultation for her in his  voice.    She was gazing horror-stricken at his breast, as in turning to look back  he faced her.    \"Oh, Duane, your shirt's all bloody!\" she faltered, pointing with  trembling fingers.    With her words Duane became aware of two things--the hand he  instinctively placed to his breast still held his gun, and he had  sustained a terrible wound.    Duane had been shot through the breast far enough down to give him grave  apprehension of his life. The clean-cut hole made by the bullet bled  freely both at its entrance and where it had come out, but with no signs  of hemorrhage. He did not bleed at the mouth; however, he began to cough  up a reddish-tinged foam.    As they rode on, Jennie, with pale face and mute lips, looked at him.    \"I'm badly hurt, Jennie,\" he said, \"but I guess I'll stick it out.\"    \"The woman--did she shoot you?\"    \"Yes. She was a devil. Euchre told me to look out for her. I wasn't  quick enough.\"    \"You didn't have to--to--\" shivered the girl.    \"No! no!\" he replied.    They did not stop climbing while Duane tore a scarf and made compresses,  which he bound tightly over his wounds. The fresh horses made fast  time up the rough trail. From open places Duane looked down. When they  surmounted the steep ascent and stood on top of the Rim Rock, with  no signs of pursuit down in the valley, and with the wild, broken  fastnesses before them, Duane turned to the girl and assured her that  they now had every chance of escape.    \"But--your--wound!\" she faltered, with dark, troubled eyes. \"I see--the  blood--dripping from your back!\"    \"Jennie, I'll take a lot of killing,\" he said.    Then he became silent and attended to the uneven trail. He was aware  presently that he had not come into Bland's camp by this route. But  that did not matter; any trail leading out beyond the Rim Rock was safe  enough. What he wanted was to get far away into some wild retreat where  he could hide till he recovered from his wound. He seemed to feel a fire  inside his breast, and his throat burned so that it was necessary for  him to take a swallow of water every little while. He began to suffer  considerable pain, which increased as the hours went by and then gave  way to a numbness. From that time on he had need of his great strength  and endurance. Gradually he lost his steadiness and his keen sight; and  he realized that if he were to meet foes, or if pursuing outlaws should  come up with him, he could make only a poor stand. So he turned off on a  trail that appeared seldom traveled.    Soon after this move he became conscious of a further thickening of his  senses. He felt able to hold on to his saddle for a while longer, but he  was failing. Then he thought he ought to advise Jennie, so in case she  was left alone she would have some idea of what to do.    \"Jennie, I'll give out soon,\" he said. \"No-I don't mean--what you think.  But I'll drop soon. My strength's going. If I die--you ride back to  the main trail. Hide and rest by day. Ride at night. That trail goes  to water. I believe you could get across the Nueces, where some rancher  will take you in.\"    Duane could not get the meaning of her incoherent reply. He rode on,  and soon he could not see the trail or hear his horse. He did not  know whether they traveled a mile or many times that far. But he was  conscious when the horse stopped, and had a vague sense of falling and  feeling Jennie's arms before all became dark to him.    When consciousness returned he found himself lying in a little hut of  mesquite branches. It was well built and evidently some years old. There  were two doors or openings, one in front and the other at the back.  Duane imagined it had been built by a fugitive--one who meant to keep an  eye both ways and not to be surprised. Duane felt weak and had no desire  to move. Where was he, anyway? A strange, intangible sense of time,  distance, of something far behind weighed upon him. Sight of the two  packs Euchre had made brought his thought to Jennie. What had become of  her? There was evidence of her work in a smoldering fire and a little  blackened coffee-pot. Probably she was outside looking after the horses  or getting water. He thought he heard a step and listened, but he felt  tired, and presently his eyes closed and he fell into a doze.    Awakening from this, he saw Jennie sitting beside him. In some way  she seemed to have changed. When he spoke she gave a start and turned  eagerly to him.    \"Duane!\" she cried.    \"Hello. How're you, Jennie, and how am I?\" he said, finding it a little  difficult to talk.    \"Oh, I'm all right,\" she replied. \"And you've come to--your wound's  healed; but you've been sick. Fever, I guess. I did all I could.\"    Duane saw now that the difference in her was a whiteness and tightness  of skin, a hollowness of eye, a look of strain.    \"Fever? How long have we been here?\" he asked.    She took some pebbles from the crown of his sombrero and counted them.    \"Nine. Nine days,\" she answered.    \"Nine days!\" he exclaimed, incredulously. But another look at her  assured him that she meant what she said. \"I've been sick all the time?  You nursed me?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Bland's men didn't come along here?\"    \"No.\"    \"Where are the horses?\"    \"I keep them grazing down in a gorge back of here. There's good grass  and water.\"    \"Have you slept any?\"    \"A little. Lately I couldn't keep awake.\"    \"Good Lord! I should think not. You've had a time of it sitting here day  and night nursing me, watching for the outlaws. Come, tell me all about  it.\"    \"There's nothing much to tell.\"    \"I want to know, anyway, just what you did--how you felt.\"    \"I can't remember very well,\" she replied, simply. \"We must have ridden  forty miles that day we got away. You bled all the time. Toward evening  you lay on your horse's neck. When we came to this place you fell out of  the saddle. I dragged you in here and stopped your bleeding. I thought  you'd die that night. But in the morning I had a little hope. I had  forgotten the horses. But luckily they didn't stray far. I caught them  and kept them down in the gorge. When your wounds closed and you began  to breathe stronger I thought you'd get well quick. It was fever"]]]
