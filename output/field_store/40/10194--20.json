[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13029"],[0,"The Art of the Moving Picture (#17)"],[1," the picture to last one reel  through. The society dame of the period, in her pretty raiment, fingers  the strings of her musical instrument, while the master stands by her  with the baton. The painter has enjoyed the satire, from her elegant  little hands to the teacher's well-combed locks. It is very plain that  she does not want to study music with any sincerity, and he does not  desire to develop the ability of this particular person. There may be a  flirtation in the background. Yet these people are not hollow as gourds,  and they are not caricatured. The Dutch Little Masters have indulged in  numberless characterizations of mundane humanity. But they are never so  preoccupied with the story that it is an anecdote rather than a picture.  It is, first of all, a piece of elegant painting-fabric. Next it is a  scrap of Dutch philosophy or aspiration.    Let Whistler turn over in his grave while we enlist him for the cause of  democracy. One view of the technique of this man might summarize it thus:  fastidiousness in choice of subject, the picture well within the frame,  low relief, a Velasquez study of tones and a Japanese study of spaces.  Let us, dear and patient reader, particularly dwell upon the spacing. A  Whistler, or a good Japanese print, might be described as a kaleidoscope  suddenly arrested and transfixed at the moment of most exquisite  relations in the pieces of glass. An Intimate Play of a kindred sort  would start to turning the kaleidoscope again, losing fine relations only  to gain those which are more exquisite and novel. All motion pictures  might be characterized as _space measured without sound, plus time  measured without sound_. This description fits in a special way the  delicate form of the Intimate Motion Picture, and there can be studied  out, free from irrelevant issues.    As to _space measured without sound_. Suppose it is a humorous  characterization of comfortable family life, founded on some Dutch Little  Master. The picture measures off its spaces in harmony. The triangle  occupied by the little child's dress is in definite relation to the  triangle occupied by the mother's costume. To these two patterns the  space measured off by the boy's figure is adjusted, and all of them are  as carefully related to the shapes cut out of the background by the  figures. No matter how the characters move about in the photoplay, these  pattern shapes should relate to one another in a definite design. The  exact tone value of each one and their precise nearness or distance to  one another have a deal to do with the final effect.    We go to the photoplay to enjoy right and splendid picture-motions, to  feel a certain thrill when the pieces of kaleidoscope glass slide into  new places. Instead of moving on straight lines, as they do in the  mechanical toy, they progress in strange curves that are part of the very  shapes into which they fall.    Consider: first came the photograph. Then motion was added to the  photograph. We must use this order in our judgment. If it is ever to  evolve into a national art, it must first be good picture, then good  motion.    Belasco's attitude toward the stage has been denounced by the purists  because he makes settings too large a portion of his story-telling, and  transforms his theatre into the paradise of the property-man. But this  very quality of the well spaced setting, if you please, has made his  chance for the world's moving picture anthology. As reproduced by Jesse  K. Lasky the Belasco production is the only type of the old-line drama  that seems really made to be the basis of a moving picture play. Not  always, but as a general rule, Belasco suffers less detriment in the  films than other men. Take, for instance, the Belasco-Lasky production of  The Rose of the Rancho with Bessie Barriscale as the heroine. It has many  highly modelled action-tableaus, and others that come under the  classification of this chapter. When I was attending it not long ago,  here in my home town, the fair companion at my side said that one scene  looked like a painting by Sorolla y Bastida, the Spaniard. It is the  episode where the Rose sends back her servant to inquire the hero's  name. As a matter of fact there were Sorollas and Zuloagas all through  the piece. The betrothal reception with flying confetti was a satisfying  piece of Spanish splendor. It was space music indeed, space measured  without sound. Incidentally the cast is to be congratulated on its  picturesque acting, especially Miss Barriscale in her impersonation of  the Rose.    It is harder to grasp the other side of the paradox, picture-motions  considered as _time measured without sound_. But think of a lively and  humoresque clock that does not tick and takes only an hour to record a  day. Think of a noiseless electric vehicle, where you are looking out of  the windows, going down the smooth boulevard of Wonderland. Consider a  film with three simple time-elements: (1) that of the pursuer, (2) the  pursued, (3) the observation vehicle of the camera following the road and  watching both of them, now faster, now slower than they, as the  photographer overtakes the actors or allows them to hurry ahead. The  plain chase is a bore because there are only these three time-elements.  But the chase principle survives in every motion picture and we simply  need more of this sort of time measurement, better considered. The more  the non-human objects, the human actors, and the observer move at a  varying pace, the greater chances there are for what might be called  time-and-space music.    No two people in the same room should gesture at one mechanical rate, or  lift their forks or spoons, keeping obviously together. Yet it stands to  reason that each successive tableau should be not only a charming  picture, but the totals of motion should be an orchestration of various  speeds, of abrupt, graceful, and seemingly awkward progress, worked into  a silent symphony.    Supposing it is a fisher-maiden's romance. In the background the waves  toss in one tempo. Owing to the sail, the boat rocks in another. In the  foreground the tree alternately bends and recovers itself in the breeze,  making more opposition than the sail. In still another time-unit the  smoke rolls from the chimney, making no resistance to the wind. In  another unit, the lovers pace the sand. Yet there is one least common  multiple in which all move. This the producing genius should sense and  make part of the dramatic structure, and it would have its bearing on the  periodic appearance of the minor and major crises.    Films like this, you say, would be hard to make. Yes. Here is the place  to affirm that the one-reel Intimate Photoplay will no doubt be the form  in which this type of time-and-space music is developed. The music of  silent motion is the most abstract of moving picture attributes and will  probably remain the least comprehended. Like the quality of Walter  Pater's Marius the Epicurean, or that of Shelley's Hymn to Intellectual  Beauty, it will not satisfy the sudden and the brash.           *       *       *       *       *    The reader will find in his round of the picture theatres many single  scenes and parts of plays that elucidate the title of this chapter. Often  the first two-thirds of the story will fit it well. Then the producers,  finding that, for reasons they do not understand, with the best and most  earnest actors they cannot work the three reels into an emotional climax,  introduce some stupid disaster and rescue utterly irrelevant to the  character-parts and the paintings that have preceded. Whether the alleged  thesis be love, hate, or ambition, cottage charm, daisy dell sweetness,  or the ivy beauty of an ancient estate, the resource for the final punch  seems to be something like a train-wreck. But the transfiguration of the  actors, not their destruction or rescue, is the goal. The last moment of  the play is great, not when it is a grandiose salvation from a burning  house, that knocks every delicate preceding idea in the head, but a  tableau that is as logical as the awakening of the Sleeping Beauty after  the hero has explored all the charmed castle.          CHAPTER X    FURNITURE, TRAPPINGS, AND INVENTIONS IN MOTION      The Action Pictures are sculpture-in-motion, the Intimate Pictures,  paintings-in-motion, the Splendor Pictures, many and diverse. It seems  far-fetched, perhaps, to complete the analogy and say they are  architecture-in-motion; yet, patient reader, unless I am mistaken, that  assumption can be given a value in time without straining your  imagination.    Landscape gardening, mural painting, church building, and furniture  making as well, are some of the things that come under the head of  architecture. They are discussed between the covers of any architectural  magazine. There is a particular relation in the photoplay between Crowd  Pictures and landscape conceptions, between Patriotic Films and mural  paintings, between Religious Films and architecture. And there is just as  much of a relation between Fairy Tales and furniture, which same is  discussed in this chapter.    Let us return to Moving Day, chapter four. This idea has been represented  many times with a certain sameness because the producers have not thought  out the philosophy behind it. A picture that is all action is a plague,  one that is all elephantine and pachydermatous pageant is a bore, and,  most emphatically, a film that is all mechanical legerdemain is a  nuisance. The possible charm in a so-called trick picture is in  eliminating the tricks, giving them dignity till they are no longer such,  but thoughts in motion and made visible. In Moving Day the shoes are the  most potent. They go through a drama that is natural to them. To march  without human feet inside is but to exaggerate themselves. It would not  be amusing to have them walk upside down, for instance. As long as the  worn soles touch the pavement, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13030"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 09 (#17)"],[1,"rich are all the treasures of his land;    Yet o'er all heroes stands he higher still,    And richer far in honors is our King.      HAGEN.      Thy hand, thou lowlander! Thou speakest well!      VOLKER.      And would it be so hard to leave this land    Amidst the ocean's desert solitude--    Of thy free will to leave it, and the King    To follow forth to life from night and hell?    This land is like no other on the earth.--    A desert waste, a rockbound wilderness;    All living things have fled long since in fear,    And if thou lovest it, 'tis only this,    That thou wast born the last of all thy race.    Above, the storms rage ever, and the sea    Forever surgeth and the fiery mount    In labor moaneth, while the fearful light    That streameth ruddy from the firmament,    As streams the blood from sacrificial stone,    Is such as devils only may endure.--    To breathe the air is like to drinking blood!      BRUNHILDA.      What knowest thou of this my wilderness?    Naught have I lacked from that fair world of thine.    And if I longed for aught, that would I take.    Remember that! Brunhilda needs no gifts!      SIEGFRIED.      Did I not tell ye true? To arms! To arms!    By force must she be brought from her wild home!    And once 'tis done, then will she give thee thanks.      BRUNHILDA.      Perchance that is not true. And knowest thou    The sacrifice thou askest? Thou know'st not,    And no man knoweth. Harken now to me,    And ask yourselves how I'll defend my rights.    With us the time is motionless; we know    Nor spring nor summer nor the autumntide.    The visage of the year is e'er the same,    And we within the land are changeless too.    But although nothing grows and blooms with us,    As in the sunlight of your distant home,    Still in our darkness ripen precious fruits    That in your land ye neither sow nor reap.    In the fierce joy of battle I delight    To conquer every haughty foe that comes    To steal my freedom. And I have my youth,    My glorious youth, and all the joy of life,    Which still suffice me, and, ere these I lose,    The benediction of the fates will fall    Invisibly upon me. I shall be    Their consecrated priestess evermore.      FRIGGA.      Is't possible? My offering sufficed?      BRUNHILDA.      The solid earth shall open 'neath my feet    Revealing all that's hidden in its depths;    And I shall hear the singing of the stars,    And their celestial music understand.    And still another joy shall be my share,    A third one, all impossible to grasp.      FRIGGA.      'Tis thou, 'tis Odin, hast unsealed her eyes!    In the deep night her ear was closed to thee--    Yet now she sees the spinning of the Norns.      BRUNHILDA (_rising to her full height, with fixed and dreaming    eyes_).      There comes a morning when I do not go    To hunt for bears, or find the great sea-snake    That's frozen in the ice, and set him free,    So that his struggles may not smite the stars.    I leave the castle early, bravely mount    My faithful steed. He bears me joyfully,    But suddenly I halt. Before my feet    The earth has turned to air, and shuddering    I wheel about. Behind me 'tis the same!    All is transparent--glowing clouds beneath,    As overhead. My maidens prattle still.    I call them--Are ye blind? Do ye see naught?    We float in empty space! They are amazed,    They shake their heads in silence, while they press    About me closer. Frigga whispers me:    And has thine hour come? Ah, now I see!    The solid earth is crystal to my gaze,    And what I deemed were clouds were but the web    Of gold and silver threads that, glistening,    Lay tangled in the depths.      FRIGGA.      Thy triumph comes!      BRUNHILDA.      An evening comes. All's changed, and lingering    We sit here late together. Suddenly,    As they were dead, the maidens fall; their words    Are frozen on their lips. I needs must go    Upon the tower, for above me rings    The sep'rate music of each farthest star.    At first 'tis only music to mine ear,    But with the dawn I murmur as in sleep:    The King will die ere nightfall and his son    Will never see the daylight, for he dies    Within his mother's womb! The others say    That so I told my tale, but I know naught    Of how I learned it. Soon I understand,    And swift the rumor flies from pole to pole    And distant people flock as now to me,    But not with swords to battle with me here--    Nay, humbly come they, laying by their crowns,    To hear my dreams and strive to understand    The meaning of my murmurings. For my eyes    Can see the future, in my hands I hold    The key to all the treasures of this world.    Far above all I rule, untouched by fate,    And yet the fates I know. But I forget.    That even more is promised me. There roll    Whole centuries away--millenniums--    I feel them not! Yet finally I ask:    Where then is death? My tresses answer me--    I see them in the mirror--they are black,    The snow has never touched them, and I say:    This is the third gift. Death comes not to me.      [_She sinks back, and the maidens support    her_.]      FRIGGA.      Why fear I still? For were it[1] Balmung's lord,    She hath a shield that will protect her now.    He'll fall, e'en if she loves but yet resists,    And she will struggle, since her fate she knows.      BRUNHILDA (_rising again_).      I spoke! What said I?      FRIGGA.      Take thy bow, my child.    Thy dart will fly today as ne'er before,    All else may wait!      BRUNHILDA (_to the knights_).      Come on!      SIEGFRIED (_to_ BRUNHILDA).      Thou swear'st    To follow us if thou art overcome?      BRUNHILDA (_laughs_).      I swear!      SIEGFRIED.      'Tis well! And I'll prepare the ship!      BRUNHILDA (_while going away addresses_ FRIGGA).      Go now into the trophy hall and drive    The nail that will be needed.      (_To the knights_.)      Follow me!      [_Exeunt omnes_.]          ACT II      _Worms. Courtyard of the Castle_.          SCENE I      _Enter_ RUMOLT _and_ GISELHER, _meeting_.      GISELHER.      Now, Rumolt, will a single tree be left?    For weeks now thou hast brought whole forests in    And grimly thou provid'st the wedding feast,    As if men, dwarfs, and elves were all to come.      RUMOLT.      I make me ready, and if I should find    A single kettle that's not full enough,    I'll seize the lazy cook and throw him in    And use the scullion-boy to stir the stew.      GISELHER.      Art thou so certain what the end will be?      RUMOLT.      I am, for Siegfried woos. The man who takes    Two noble princes captive, sends them home    As though they were no more than frightened hares,    Will not be daunted by a witch-wife now.      GISELHER.      There thou art right! We have good hostages    Since we have Luedegast and Luedeger!    They meant to bring a host of armed men,    A greater than e'er Burgundy had seen.    Yet humbly here as prisoners they came,    Nor needed any guard upon their way.    So cook, my man, we shall not want for guests!      [GERENOT _enters_.]      And here's the hunter!      GERENOT.      But he brings no game!    I was upon the tower and saw the Rhine    All covered o'er with ships.      RUMOLT.      It is the bride!    I'll send my men to drive the beasts about,    That from the noisy turmoil in the court    The sound shall reach afar and prove to her    The welcome that awaits her!      [_Trumpets are heard_.]      GERENOT.      'Tis too late!          SCENE II      _Enter_ SIEGFRIED, _with retinue_.      SIEGFRIED.      Here am I once again!      GISELHER.      Without my brother?      SIEGFRIED.      Nay, fear not! As his messenger I come!--    And yet I bear the message not for thee!    'Tis for thy Lady Mother, and I hope    That I may see thy sister Kriemhild, too.      GISELHER.      Brave knight, that shalt thou, for we owe to thee    Our thanks for capturing the noble Danes.      SIEGFRIED.      I wish that I had never sent them here.      GISELHER.      Why so? Thou hadst no better way to prove    What we have gained in winning thy right arm,    For truly are the Princes stalwart men!      SIEGFRIED.      It may be! Yet had I not done the deed,    Perhaps some bird had flown and spread abroad    The rumor that the Danes had slain me there,    And I might ask how Kriemhild heard the tale.      GISELHER.      But as it is they help thy cause enough!    That one can take good metal and alloy    And beat them into trumpets smooth and round,    I long have known. But that one could shape men    In such a way I knew not, but these two    Show us the work of such a smith as thou.    They praised thee--If thou hadst been there to hear,    Thy cheeks would still flame scarlet! Yet 'twas not    With measured praise, as men will praise their foe,    Thinking to lessen thus the burning shame    Of their own downfall. No, 'twas heartfelt praise.    But you should hear Kriemhilda tell the tale.    Unweariedly she asked them o'er and o'er.--    She's coming now.          SCENE III      _Enter_ UTE _and_ KRIEMHILD.      SIEGFRIED.      I pray you!      GISELHER.      What's thy wish?      SIEGFRIED.      I never longed to have my father by,    That he might teach me how to bear my arms,    But ah! today I need my mother so,    That I might ask her how to use my tongue.      GISELHER.      Give me thy hand, since thou art shamefaced too.    They call me here \"the child.\" Now let them see    A \"child\" may lead a lion!      [_He leads_ SIEGFRIED _to the women_.]      'Tis the knight    From Netherland!      SIEGFRIED.      Fair ladies, do not fear,    Because I've come alone.      UTE.      Brave Siegfried, no!    We do not fear, for thou art not the man    Who's left alone when all but he are dead,    To bear his tale, a messenger of woe.    Thou comest to announce a daughter dear,    And Kriemhild hath a sister.      SIEGFRIED.      So it is,    My Queen!      GISELHER.      So is it!"]]]
