A  cheer was given next, and that was better--you can keep in tune for a  cheer.    THE \"LUCKY THIRTEEN\"    \"Our rescuer showed up rapidly, and as she swung round we saw her cabins  all alight, and knew she must be a large steamer. She was now motionless  and we had to row to her. Just then day broke, a beautiful quiet dawn  with faint pink clouds just above the horizon, and a new moon whose  crescent just touched the horizon. 'Turn your money over, boys,' said  our cheery steersman, 'that is, if you have any with you,' he added.    \"We laughed at him for his superstition at such a time, but he countered  very neatly by adding: 'Well, I shall never say again that 13 is an  unlucky number; boat 13 has been the best friend we ever had.' Certainly  the 13 superstition is killed forever in the minds of those who escaped  from the Titanic in boat 13.    \"As we neared the Carpathia we saw in the dawning light what we thought  was a full-rigged schooner standing up near her, and presently behind  her another, all sails set, and we said: 'They are fisher boats from the  Newfoundland bank and have seen the steamer lying to and are standing by  to help.' But in another five minutes the light shone pink on them  and we saw they were icebergs towering many feet in the air, huge,  glistening masses, deadly white, still, and peaked in a way that had  easily suggested a schooner. We glanced round the horizon and there were  others wherever the eye could reach. The steamer we had to reach was  surrounded by them and we had to make a detour to reach her, for between  her and us lay another huge berg.\"    A WONDERFUL DAWN    Speaking of the moment when the Carpathia was sighted. Mrs. J. J. Brown,  who had cowed the driveling quartermaster, said:    \"Then, knowing that we were safe at last, I looked about me. The most  wonderful dawn I have ever seen came upon us. I have just returned from  Egypt. I have been all over the world, but I have never seen anything  like this. First the gray and then the flood of light. Then the sun came  up in a ball of red fire. For the first time we saw where we were. Near  us was open water, but on every side was ice. Ice ten feet high was  everywhere, and to the right and left and back and front were icebergs.  Some of them were mountain high. This sea of ice was forty miles wide,  they told me. We did not wait for the Carpathia to come to us, we rowed  to it. We were lifted up in a sort of nice little sling that was lowered  to us. After that it was all over. The passengers of the Carpathia  were so afraid that we would not have room enough that they gave us  practically the whole ship to ourselves.\"    It had been learned that some of the passengers, in fact all of the  women passengers of the Titanic who were rescued, refer to \"Lady  Margaret,\" as they called Mrs. Brown as the strength of them all.      TRANSFERRING THE RESCUED    Officers of the Carpathia report that when they reached the scene of  the Titanic's wreck there were fifty bodies or more floating in the  sea. Only one mishap attended the transfer of the rescued from the  life-boats. One large collapsible life-boat, in which thirteen persons  were seated, turned turtle just as they were about to save it, and all  in it were lost.        THE DOG HERO    Not the least among the heroes of the Titanic disaster was Rigel, a big  black Newfoundland dog, belonging to the first officer, who went down  with the ship. But for Rigel the fourth boat picked up might have been  run down by the Carpathia. For three hours he swam in the icy water  where the Titanic went down, evidently looking for his master, and was  instrumental in guiding the boatload of survivors to the gangway of the  Carpathia.    Jonas Briggs, a seaman abroad the Carpathia, now has Rigel and told  the story of the dog's heroism. The Carpathia was moving slowly about,  looking for boats, rafts or anything which might be afloat. Exhausted  with their efforts, weak from lack of food and exposure to the cutting  wind and terror-stricken, the men and women in the fourth boat had  drifted under the Carpathia's starboard bow. They were dangerously close  to the steamship, but too weak to shout a warning loud enough to reach  the bridge.    The boat might not have been seen were it not for the sharp barking of  Rigel, who was swimming ahead of the craft, and valiantly announcing his  position. The barks attracted the attention of Captain Rostron; and he  went to the starboard end of the bridge to see where they came from and  saw the boat. He immediately ordered the engines stopped, and the boat  came alongside the starboard gangway.    Care was taken to get Rigel aboard, but he appeared little affected  by his long trip through the ice-cold water. He stood by the rail and  barked until Captain Rostron called Briggs and had him take the dog  below.      A THRILLING ACCOUNT OF RESCUE    Mr. Wallace Bradford, of San Francisco, a passenger aboard the  Carpathia, gave the following thrilling account of the rescue of the  Titanic's passengers.    \"Since half-past four this morning I have experienced one of those  never-to-be-forgotten circumstances that weighs heavy on my soul and  which shows most awfully what poor things we mortals are. Long before  this reaches you the news will be flashed that the Titanic has gone down  and that our steamer, the Carpathia, caught the wireless message when  seventy-five miles away, and so far we have picked up twenty boats  estimated to contain about 750 people.    \"None of us can tell just how many, as they have been hustled to various  staterooms and to the dining saloons to be warmed up. I was awakened by  unusual noises and imagined that I smelled smoke. I jumped up and looked  out of my port-hole, and saw a huge iceberg looming up like a rock off  shore. It was not white, and I was positive that it was a rock, and the  thought flashed through my mind, how in the world can we be near a rock  when we are four days out from New York in a southerly direction and in  mid-ocean.    \"When I got out on deck the first man I encountered told me that the  Titanic had gone down and we were rescuing the passengers. The first two  boats from the doomed vessel were in sight making toward us. Neither of  them was crowded. This was accounted for later by the fact that it was  impossible to get many to leave the steamer, as they would not believe  that she was going down. It was a glorious, clear morning and a quiet  sea. Off to the starboard was a white area of ice plain, from whose even  surface rose mammoth forts, castles and pyramids of solid ice almost as  real as though they had been placed there by the hand of man.    \"Our steamer was hove to about two and a half miles from the edge of  this huge iceberg. The Titanic struck about 11.20 P. M. and did not go  down until two o'clock. Many of the passengers were in evening dress  when they came aboard our ship, and most of these were in a most  bedraggled condition. Near me as I write is a girl about eighteen years  old in a fancy dress costume of bright colors, while in another seat  near by is a women in a white dress trimmed with lace and covered with  jaunty blue flowers.    \"As the boats came alongside after the first two all of them contained  a very large proportion of women. In fact, one of the boats had women  at the oars, one in particular containing, as near as I could estimate,  about forty-five women and only about six men. In this boat two women  were handling one of the oars. All of the engineers went down with the  steamer. Four bodies have been brought aboard. One is that of a fireman,  who is said to have been shot by one of the officers because he refused  to obey orders. Soon after I got on deck I could, with the aid of my  glasses, count seven boats headed our way, and they continued to come up  to half past eight o'clock. Some were in sight for a long time and  moved very slowly, showing plainly that the oars were being handled by  amateurs or by women.    \"No baggage of any kind was brought by the survivors. In fact, the only  piece of baggage that reached the Carpathia from the Titanic is a small  closed trunk about twenty-four inches square, evidently the property of  an Irish female immigrant. While some seemed fully dressed, many of  the men having their overcoats and the women sealskin and other coats,  others came just as they had jumped from their berths, clothed in their  pajamas and bath robes.\"      THE SORROW OF THE LIVING    Of the survivors in general it may be said that they escaped death and  they gained life. Life is probably sweet to them as it is to everyone,  but what physical and mental torture has been the price of life to those  who were brought back to land on the Carpathia--the hours in life-boats,  amid the crashing of ice, the days of anguish that have succeeded, the  horrors of body and mind still experienced and never to be entirely  absent until death affords them its relief.    The thought of the nation to-day is for the living. They need our  sympathy, our consolation more than do the dead, and, perhaps, in the  majority of the cases they need our protecting care as well.        CHAPTER X. ON BOARD THE CARPATHIA    AID FOR THE SUFFERING AND HYSTERICAL--BURYING THE DEAD--VOTE OF  THANKS TO CAPTAIN ROSTRON OF THE CARPATHIA--IDENTIFYING THOSE  SAVED--COMMUNICATING WITH LAND--THE PASSAGE TO NEW YORK.    IF the scenes in the life-boats were tear-bringing, hardly less so  was the arrival of the boats at the Carpathia with their bands of  terror-stricken, grief-ridden survivors, many of them too exhausted to  know that safety was at hand. Watchers on the Carpathia were moved to  tears.    \"The first life-boat reached the Carpathia about half-past five o'clock  in the morning,\" recorded one of the passengers on the Carpathia. \"And  the last of the sixteen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7820"],[0,"Monitress Merle (#16)"],[1,"ed.    To Bevis this visit was elysium. All his experiences of young people had  been confined to school, and he had never before spent such a holiday.    \"It's grand to be in a home like this!\" he said, once, to Mavis. \"I can't  help thinking, sometimes, how different life would have been to me if my  mother had lived. It's hard not to have even the slightest remembrance of  her. Suppose she had been here now and living at 'The Warren'!\"    \"You'll go there yourself some day.\"    \"Perhaps. It'll be rather a forlorn business though, being in that big  house with only a pack of servants. I believe I'll take a voyage round  the world in a yacht. The fact is I can't quite see my future. I'm going  to Cambridge, but after that things are vague. I always had dreams of a  profession, but the lawyers say I ought to settle down on the estate.  What's a fellow to do?\"    \"I wouldn't worry your head about it yet. There'll be plenty of time to  think things over while you're at College,\" counselled Mavis. \"Enjoy your  holidays at any rate.\"    \"No mistake about that. I'm having the luck of my life!\"    It was only to Mavis's sympathetic ear that Bevis poured out these  confidences. With Merle he was on different terms. He called her  'Soeurette' (little sister) and was always ready for some joke with her.  She and Clive together led him a lively time, as well as keeping him busy  helping them to make boxes, build a boat, and several other joinering  enterprises.    \"It does Bevis all the good in the world to be teased!\" declared Merle.    \"He certainly gets it, then!\" laughed Mavis.    One special grievance had Merle. Bevis had devoted some of his spare time  at Shelton College to taking motoring lessons, for he hoped to buy a car  some day, and he could now drive so well that Dr. Ramsay trusted him at  the steering-wheel.    \"It's too bad!\" declared that indignant damsel. \"Just because Mother's  nervous and thinks I'm going to run her into the ditch! Wait till I've  had _my_ course of motoring lessons! I'll take the shine out of  Bevis! See if I don't!\"    \"You shall try my motor bike, if you like, Soeurette!\" consoled Bevis.  \"That's to say, if they'll allow you.\"    \"Don't, for goodness' sake, ask anybody, but just take it out on the  quiet and I'll guarantee to ride it. Let's do it this very afternoon!\"  returned Merle, somewhat pacified.    On the whole the weather had proved exceedingly wet, so with the  exceptions of a few runs in the car with the hood up, they had not  ventured very far away, and had mostly taken walks in the neighbourhood.  Bevis naturally wished to explore the Durracombe district, and they had  not been to Chagmouth since his arrival, and knew nothing of what was  going on there. One drizzling morning, however, when they were all  sitting in the harness room, they heard a clatter of hoofs and then a  shout in the stable yard, and looking out of the window saw Tudor  Williams on his little horse, Armorelle. The girls ran out at once.    \"I say! How d'you do?\" said Tudor. \"Isn't your man about anywhere to take  this horse?\"    \"Tom's in the greenhouse, I'll fetch him!\" and Merle darted across the  dripping yard.    \"Have you come to see Uncle?\" asked Mavis, stroking Armorelle's satin  nose.    \"No, I've a message from the Mater for you and Merle. Oh, here's your  groom! Yes, just give her a wipe down, please\" (as Tom led Armorelle away  to the stable), \"she's too fat and gets easily hot! Ugh! It's rather a  horrid day. The Mater wanted to send me in the car, but I said I'd rather  ride.\"    \"Won't you come into the house?\" asked Mavis.    \"Or into our den?\" invited Merle. \"We've made the harness room into a  snuggery.\"    \"By Jove! Not a bad idea, that! Yes, take me there. I'm too splashed to  be fit for the drawing-room. I say, this is no end! What a decent fire  you've got!\"    \"You know Bevis? And this is our Cousin Clive,\" said Mavis, performing  the introductions.    Tudor nodded, flung himself into a basket chair and looked round the room  with some amusement.    \"It's like you two!\" he vouchsafed. \"_I_ should never have thought  of taking over the harness room! 'Pon my word, it's cosy! You won't want  to turn out when I tell you what I've come for!\"    \"Turn out where?\"    \"Well, it's a long story. You see there are some new  people come to live in Chagmouth--an artist with a family about a yard  long. Of course, the Mater goes and calls and gushes and comes back  talking about beauty and talent and all the rest of it. She's an eye to  business though, has the Mater! Mr. Colville had asked her to get up a  concert in aid of something or other, I don't know what it's for! The new  Vicar's as bad as the old one for wanting money, and the Mater's  perpetually raising the wind for the parish with entertainments. She's  worked all her local stars rather hard, so you can imagine she pounced  upon anybody new, and got them to promise about half the programme. She  came back purring. There was the other half of the programme, though, to  be fixed up. The Girl Guides had learnt a dialogue, so she said they  might as well act it, and she had the posters printed and sent the school  children round selling tickets.\"    \"Well?\" said Mavis, as Tudor paused for breath.    \"I'm coming to the point fast enough! It seems the principal characters  in the dialogue are three sisters, and yesterday one of them developed  measles! The other two are contact cases and, of course, they're not  allowed on the boards. You can't act 'Hamlet' without the Prince of  Denmark and Ophelia and Polonius! It's the same business here. The  dialogue has collapsed like a pricked balloon!\"    \"Have they no understudies?\"    \"Never heard of such things, and say it would take them six weeks to  train any one else in the parts, besides which the others say they  wouldn't dream of doing it without Gertie and Florrie or whatever their  names are. The Mater sprinted round the village trying to fill up her  empty programme but all her stars were huffy because they hadn't been  asked before, and they said they had colds or they wanted to go to their  grandmothers' funerals, or some such excuse. Back comes the Mater almost  in tears and says she really doesn't know whatever she's going to do  about it, and there never was such a fiasco, etc. Then Babbie suggested  'Send for Mavis and Merle, they'll help you out.' Mother jumped to it  like a drowning man at a rope. So I trotted off immediately after  breakfast to ask if you'll come to the rescue.\"    \"O-o-h! But when is the concert?\"    \"To-night at 7 prompt.\"    \"Great Scott! We can't!\"    \"Yes, you can! Any of those impromptu things you give will simply delight  people. They've paid their shillings and their sixpences to see some  acting and they don't mind what it's like so long as it makes them laugh  and they get their money's worth. The Mater'll send the car over for you  after lunch and she'll put you up for the night--you, Talland, too, and  you,\" nodding to Clive. \"Be sporting, all of you, and come!\"    \"Could we possibly get through the thing we did last night?\" hesitated  Mavis, looking at the others.    \"Let's try,\" decided Merle. \"It's all gag, Tudor, and if we get stage  fright and can't go on we shall just have to walk off, that's how it is.\"    \"You won't do that! I say, you know, it's most awfully kind of you! The  Mater will be _so_ relieved. She'd have written a note but there was  some other hitch about the refreshments and she was interviewing the  schoolmaster. Shall we send the car at three? Then I'd better hurry home  now and set the Mater's mind at rest.\"    \"Wait, Tudor! We haven't asked Mother yet.\"    \"Oh, didn't I tell you? I met Dr. and Mrs. Ramsay in your car and stopped  them, and they both said 'Go, by all means.'\"    \"Well, we've let ourselves in for something!\" exclaimed Mavis as Tudor  rode away on Armorelle. \"It was your fault, Merle!\"    \"No, it wasn't, it was yours! I think it will be rather fun! Cheer up,  Bevis! Don't look such a scared owl! Here's old Clive absolutely  peacocking at the idea.\"    \"If I'm to be Isabella?\" grinned Clive.    \"Of course, if I'm Augustus!\"    \"Merle--you _can't!_\"    \"Who says I can't? The joke of it will be that nobody'll know. Clive and  I are the same height and really rather alike, and if we change clothes  they'll all think _he's_ Augustus and _I'm_ Isabella.\"    \"Will anybody recognise me as Uncle Cashbags?\" groaned Bevis.    \"Not your nearest and dearest. Be as gruff as you can, and limp as you  did last night. We're not going to let you off! Don't you think it! Why,  we couldn't possibly do the piece without you!\"    The young people, ostensibly for the entertainment of their elders, but  largely for the amusement of themselves, had been acting in the evenings  to an audience of Aunt Nellie, Uncle David, and Father and Mother. Their  last performance had really been so successful that they felt they might  venture to give it in so great an emergency. They began at once to pack  their various properties.    \"Rather a score to be asked to appear on a public platform! I wish Miss  Mitchell could be there to see us!\" triumphed Merle.    \"The joke is that I don't believe Chagmouth people will recognise any of  us,\" said Mavis, hunting for a pair of spectacles she had mislaid. \"I'm  going to bargain that our names aren't announced beforehand.\"    \"Right-o! The audience can imagine we're a London Company on tour in the  provinces, or anything else they like. They'll think far more of us if  they don't know who we are till afterwards. Tudor mustn't give us away!\"          CHAPTER IX    Facing the Footlights      The big five-seater car came punctually at three and conveyed the young  people and all their belongings to The Warren, where their arrival caused  much satisfaction.    \"You've saved us from a most awkward predicament,\" declared Mrs. Glyn  Williams. \"I hardly know how to thank you. Wasn't it clever of Babbie"]]]
