And the Rakshasa who burnt  with desire upon seeing her, became very much delighted and resolved, O  good sage, to carry her away who was so blameless in every respect.    \"'My design is accomplished,' said the Rakshasa, and so seizing that  beautiful matron he carried her away. And, indeed, she of agreeable smiles,  had been betrothed by her father himself, to him, although the former  subsequently bestowed her, according to due rites, on Bhrigu. O thou of  the Bhrigu race, this wound rankled deep in the Rakshasa's mind and he  thought the present moment very opportune for carrying the lady away.    \"And the Rakshasa saw the apartment in which the sacrificial fire was kept  burning brightly. The Rakshasa then asked the flaming element 'Tell me, O  Agni, whose wife this woman rightfully is. Thou art the mouth of gods;  therefore thou art bound to answer my question. This lady of superior  complexion had been first accepted by me as wife, but her father  subsequently bestowed her on the false Bhrigu. Tell me truly if this fair  one can be regarded as the wife of Bhrigu, for having found her alone, I  have resolved to take her away by force from the hermitage. My heart  burneth with rage when I reflect that Bhrigu hath got possession of this  woman of slender waist, first betrothed to me.'\"    Sauti continued, \"In this manner the Rakshasa asked the flaming god of  fire again and again whether the lady was Bhrigu's wife. And the god was  afraid to return an answer. 'Thou, O god of fire,' said he, 'residest  constantly within every creature, as witness of her or his merits and  demerits. O thou respected one, then answer my question truly. Has not  Bhrigu appropriated her who was chosen by me as my wife? Thou shouldst  declare truly whether, therefore, she is my wife by first choice. After  thy answer as to whether she is the wife of Bhrigu, I will bear her away  from this hermitage even in sight of thee. Therefore answer thou truly.'\"    Sauti continued, \"The Seven flamed god having heard these words of the  Rakshasa became exceedingly distressed, being afraid of telling a  falsehood and equally afraid of Bhrigu's curse. And the god at length made  answer in words that came out slowly. 'This Puloma was, indeed, first  chosen by thee, O Rakshasa, but she was not taken by thee with holy rites  and invocations. But this far-famed lady was bestowed by her father on  Bhrigu as a gift from desire of blessing. She was not bestowed on thee O  Rakshasa, this lady was duly made by the Rishi Bhrigu his wife with Vedic  rites in my presence. This is she--I know her. I dare not speak a  falsehood. O thou best of the Rakshasas, falsehood is never respected in  this world.'\"      SECTION VI    (Pauloma Parva continued)    Sauti said, \"O Brahmana, having heard these words from the god of fire,  the Rakshasa assumed the form of a boar, and seizing the lady carried her  away with the speed of the wind--even of thought. Then the child of Bhrigu  lying in her body enraged at such violence, dropped from his mother's womb,  for which he obtained the name of Chyavana. And the Rakshasa perceiving  the infant drop from the mother's womb, shining like the sun, quitted his  grasp of the woman, fell down and was instantly converted into ashes. And  the beautiful Pauloma, distracted with grief, O Brahmana of the Bhrigu  race, took up her offspring Chyavana, the son of Bhrigu and walked away.  And Brahma, the Grandfather of all, himself saw her, the faultless wife of  his son, weeping. And the Grandfather of all comforted her who was  attached to her son. And the drops of tears which rolled down her eyes  formed a great river. And that river began to follow the foot-steps of the  wife of the great ascetic Bhrigu. And the Grandfather of the worlds seeing  that river follow the path of his son's wife gave it a name himself, and  he called it Vadhusara. And it passeth by the hermitage of Chyavana. And  in this manner was born Chyavana of great ascetic power, the son of Bhrigu.    \"And Bhrigu saw his child Chyavana and its beautiful mother. And the Rishi  in a rage asked her, 'By whom wast thou made known to that Rakshasa who  resolved to carry thee away? O thou of agreeable smiles, the Rakshasa  could not know thee as my wife. Therefore tell me who it was that told the  Rakshasa so, in order that I may curse him through anger.' And Pauloma  replied, 'O possessor of the six attributes! I was identified to the  Rakshasa by Agni (the god of fire). And he (the Rakshasa) bore me away,  who cried like the Kurari (female osprey). And it was only by the ardent  splendour of this thy son that I was rescued, for the Rakshasa (seeing  this infant) let me go and himself falling to the ground was turned into  ashes.'\"    Sauti continued, \"Bhrigu, upon hearing this account from Pauloma, became  exceedingly enraged. And in excess of passion the Rishi cursed Agni,  saying, 'Thou shalt eat of all things.'\"    So ends the sixth section called \"the curse on Agni\" in the Adi Parva.      SECTION VII    (Pauloma Parva continued)    Sauti said, \"the god of fire enraged at the curse of Bhrigu, thus  addressed the Rishi, 'What meaneth this rashness, O Brahmana, that thou  hast displayed towards me? What transgression can be imputed to me who was  labouring to do justice and speak the truth impartially? Being asked I  gave the true answer. A witness who when interrogated about a fact of  which he hath knowledge, representeth otherwise than it is, ruineth his  ancestors and descendants both to the seventh generation. He, too, who,  being fully cognisant of all the particulars of an affair, doth not  disclose what he knoweth, when asked, is undoubtedly stained with guilt. I  can also curse thee, but Brahmanas are held by me in high respect.  Although these are known to thee, O Brahmana, I will yet speak of them, so  please attend! Having, by ascetic power, multiplied myself, I am present  in various forms, in places of the daily homa, at sacrifices extending for  years, in places where holy rites are performed (such as marriage, etc.),  and at other sacrifices. With the butter that is poured upon my flame  according to the injunctions prescribed in the Vedas, the Devas and the  Pitris are appeased. The Devas are the waters; the Pitris are also the  waters. The Devas have with the Pitris an equal right to the sacrifices  called Darshas and Purnamasas. The Devas therefore are the Pitris and the  Pitris, the Devas. They are identical beings, worshipped together and also  separately at the changes of the moon. The Devas and the Pitris eat what  is poured upon me. I am therefore called the mouth of the Devas and the  Pitris. At the new moon the Pitris, and at the full moon the Devas, are  fed through my mouth, eating of the clarified butter that is poured on me.  Being, as I am, their mouth, how am I to be an eater of all things (clean  and unclean)?'    \"Then Agni, after reflecting for a while, withdrew himself from all places;  from places of the daily homa of the Brahmanas, from all long-extending  sacrifices, from places of holy rites, and from other ceremonies. Without  their Oms and Vashats, and deprived of their Swadhas and Swahas  (sacrificial mantras during offerings), the whole body of creatures became  much distressed at the loss of their (sacrificial) fire. The Rishis in  great anxiety went to the gods and addressed them thus, 'Ye immaculate  beings! The three regions of the universe are confounded at the cessation  of their sacrifices and ceremonies in consequence of the loss of fire!  Ordain what is to be done in this matter, so that there may be no loss of  time.' Then the Rishis and the gods went together to the presence of  Brahma. And they represented to him all about the curse on Agni and the  consequent interruption of all ceremonies. And they said, 'O thou greatly  fortunate! Once Agni hath been cursed by Bhrigu for some reason. Indeed,  being the mouth of the gods and also the first who eateth of what is  offered in sacrifices, the eater also of the sacrificial butter, how will  Agni be reduced to the condition of one who eateth of all things  promiscuously?' And the creator of the universe hearing these words of  theirs summoned Agni to his presence. And Brahma addressed Agni, the  creator of all and eternal as himself, in these gentle words, 'Thou art  the creator of the worlds and thou art their destroyer! Thou preserves  the three worlds and thou art the promoter of all sacrifices and  ceremonies! Therefore behave thyself so that ceremonies be not interrupted.  And, O thou eater of the sacrificial butter, why dost thou act so  foolishly, being, as thou art, the Lord of all? Thou alone art always pure  in the universe and thou art its stay! Thou shall not, with all thy body,  be reduced to the state of one who eateth of all things promiscuously. O  thou of flames, the flame that is in thy viler parts shall alone eat of  all things alike. The body of thine which eateth of flesh (being in the  stomach of all carnivorous animals) shall also eat of all things  promiscuously. And as every thing touched by the sun's rays becometh pure,  so shall everything be pure that shall be burnt by thy flames. Thou art, O  fire, the supreme energy born of thy own power. Then, O Lord, by that  power of thine make the Rishi's curse come true. Continue to receive thy  own portion and that of the gods, offered at thy mouth.'\"    Sauti continued, \"Then Agni replied to the Grandfather, 'So be it.' And  he then went away to obey the command of the supreme Lord. The gods and  the Rishis also returned in delight to the place whence they had come. And  the Rishis began to perform as before their ceremonies and sacrifices. And  the gods in heaven and all creatures of the world rejoiced exceedingly.  And Agni too rejoiced in that he was free from the prospect of sin.    \"Thus, O possessor of the six attributes, had Agni been cursed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7871"],[0,"Dutch Fairy Tales for Young Folks (#16)"],[1,"walking on ice. After slipping and  balancing himself, as if on a tight rope, and nearly breaking his nose  against the wall, he took off the wooden shoes, and kept them off, while  inside the house. However, when he went outdoors, he found his new shoes  very light, pleasant to the feet and easy to walk in. It was not so much  like trying to skate, as it had been in the kitchen.    At night, in his dreams, he saw two elves come through the window into  the kitchen. One, a kabouter, dark and ugly, had a box of tools. The  other, a light-faced elf, seemed to be the guide. The kabouter at once  got out his saw, hatchet, auger, long, chisel-like knife, and smoothing  plane. At first, the two elves seemed to be quarrelling, as to who  should be boss. Then they settled down quietly to work. The kabouter  took the wood and shaped it on the outside. Then he hollowed out, from  inside of it, a pair of shoes, which the elf smoothed and polished. Then  one elf put his little feet in them and tried to dance, but he only  slipped on the smooth floor and flattened his nose; but the other fellow  pulled the nose straight again, so it was all right. They waltzed  together upon the wooden shoes, then took them off, jumped out the  window, and ran away.    When Van Eyck put the wooden shoes on, he found that out in the fields,  in the mud, and on the soft soil, and in sloppy places, this sort of  foot gear was just the thing. They did not sink in the mud and the man's  feet were comfortable, even after hours of labor. They did not \"draw\"  his feet, and they kept out the water far better than leather possibly  could.    When the Van Eyck vrouw and the children saw how happy Daddy was, they  each one wanted a pair. Then they asked him what he called them.    \"Klompen,\" said he, in good Dutch, and klompen, or klomps, they are to  this day.    \"I'll make a fortune out of this,\" said Van Eyck. \"I'll set up a  klomp-winkel (shop for wooden shoes) at once.\"    So, going out to the blacksmith's shop, in the village, he had the man  who pounded iron fashion for him on his anvil, a set of tools, exactly  like those used by the kabouter and the elf, which he had seen in his  dream. Then he hung out a sign, marked \"Wooden blocks for shoes.\" He  made klomps for the little folks just out of the nursery, for boys and  girls, for grown men and women, and for all who walked out-of-doors, in  the street or on the fields.    Soon klomps came to be the fashion in all the country places. It was  good manners, when you went into a house, to take off your wooden shoes  and leave them at the door. Even in the towns and cities, ladies wore  wooden slippers, especially when walking or working in the garden.    Klomps also set the fashion for soft, warm socks, and stockings made  from sheep's wool. Soon, a thousand needles were clicking, to put a soft  cushion between one's soles and toes and the wood. Women knitted, even  while they walked to market, or gossiped on the streets. The  klomp-winkels, or shops of the shoe carpenters, were seen in every  village.    When rich beyond his day-dreams, Van Eyck had another joyful night  vision. The next day, he wore a smiling countenance. Everybody, who met  him on the street, saluted him and asked, in a neighborly way:    \"Good-morning, Mynheer Bly-moe-dig (Mr. Cheerful). How do you sail  to-day?\"    That's the way the Dutch talk--not \"how do you do,\" but, in their watery  country, it is this, \"How do you sail?\" or else, \"Hoe gat het u al?\"  (How goes it with you, already?)    Then Van Eyck told his dream. It was this: The Moss Maiden and Trintje,  the wood elf, came to him again at night and danced. They were lively  and happy.    \"What now?\" asked the dreamer, smilingly, of his two visitors.    [Illustration: The kabouter took the wood and shaped it on the inside.]    He had hardly got the question out of his mouth, when in walked a  kabouter, all smutty with blacksmith work. In one hand, he grasped his  tool box. In the other, he held a curious looking machine. It was a big  lump of iron, set in a frame, with ropes to pull it up and let it fall  down with a thump.    \"What is it?\" asked Van Eyck.    \"It's a Hey\" (a pile driver), said the kabouter, showing him how to use  it. \"When men say to you, on the street, to-morrow, 'How do you sail?'  laugh at them,\" said the Moss Maiden, herself laughing.    \"Yes, and now you can tell the people how to build cities, with mighty  churches with lofty towers, and with high houses like those in other  lands. Take the trees, trim the branches off, sharpen the tops, turn  them upside down and pound them deep in the ground. Did not the ancient  oak promise that the trees would be turned upside down for you? Did they  not say you could walk on top of them?\"    By this time, Van Eyck had asked so many questions, and kept the elves  so long, that the Moss Maiden peeped anxiously through the window.  Seeing the day breaking, she and Trintje and the kabouter flew away, so  as not to be petrified by the sunrise.    \"I'll make another fortune out of this, also,\" said the happy man, who,  next morning, was saluted as Mynheer Blyd-schap (Mr. Joyful).    At once, Van Eyck set up a factory for making pile drivers. Sending men  into the woods, who chose the tall, straight trees, he had their  branches cut off. Then he sharpened the trunks at one end, and these  were driven, by the pile driver, down, far and deep, into the ground. So  a foundation, as good as stone, was made in the soft and spongy soil,  and well built houses uprose by the thousands. Even the lofty walls of  churches stood firm. The spires were unshaken in the storm.    Old Holland had not fertile soil like France, or vast flocks of sheep,  producing wool, like England, or armies of weavers, as in the Belgic  lands. Yet, soon there rose large cities, with splendid mansions and  town halls. As high towards heaven as the cathedrals and towers in other  lands, which had rock for foundation, her brick churches rose in the  air. On top of the forest trees, driven deep into the sand and clay,  dams and dykes were built, that kept out the ocean. So, instead of the  old two thousand square miles, there were, in the realm, in the course  of years, twelve thousand, rich in green fields and cattle. Then, for  all the boys and girls that travel in this land of quaint customs,  Holland was a delight.          THE CURLY-TAILED LION      Once upon a time, some Dutch hunters went to Africa, hoping to capture a  whole family of lions. In this they succeeded. With a pack of hounds and  plenty of aborigines to poke the jungle with sticks, they drove a big  male lion, with his wife and four whelps, out of the undergrowth into a  circle. In the centre, they had dug a pit and covered it over with  sticks and grass. Into this, the whole lion family tumbled. Then, by  nets and ropes, the big, fierce creatures and the little cubs were  lifted out. They were put in cages and brought to Holland. The baby  lions, no bigger than pug dogs, were as pretty and harmless as kittens.  The sailors delighted to play with them.    Now lions, even before one was ever seen among the Dutch, enjoyed a  great reputation for strength, courage, dignity and power. It was  believed that they had all the traits of character supposed to belong to  kings, and which boys like to possess. Many fathers had named their sons  Leo, which is Latin for lion. Dutch daddies had their baby boys  christened with the name of Leeuw, which is their word for the king of  beasts.    Before lions were brought from the hot countries into colder lands, the  bear and wolf were most admired; because, besides possessing plenty of  fur, as well as great claws and terrible teeth, they had great courage.  For these reasons, many royal and common folks had taken the wolf and  bear as namesakes for their hopeful sons.    But the male lion could make more noise than wolves, for he could roar,  while they could only howl. He had a shaggy mane and a very long tail.  This had a nail at the end, for scratching and combing out his hair,  when tangled up. If he were angry, the mighty brute could stick out his  red tongue, curled like a pump handle, and nearly half a yard long.    So the lion was called the king of beasts, and the crowned rulers and  knights took him as their emblem. They had pictures of the huge creature  painted on their flags, shields and armor. Sometimes they stuck a gold  or brass lion on their iron war hats, which they called helmets. No  knight was allowed to have more than one lion on his shield, but kings  might have three or four, or even a whole menagerie of meat-eating  creatures. These painted or sculptured lions were in all sorts of  action, running, walking, standing up and looking behind or before.    Now there was a Dutch artist, who noticed what funny fellows kings were,  and how they liked to have all sorts of beasts and birds of prey, and  sea creatures that devour, on their banners. There were dragons,  two-headed eagles, boars with tusks, serpents with fangs, hawks,  griffins, wyverns, lions, dragons and dragon-lions, besides horses with  wings, mermaids with scaly tails, and even night mares that went flying  through the dark. With such a funny variety of beast, bird, and fish,  some wondered why there were not cows with two tails, cats with two  noses, rams with four horns, and creatures that were half veal and half  mutton. He noticed that kings did not care much for tame, quiet,  peaceable, or useful creatures, such as oxen or horses, doves or sheep;  but only for those brutes that hunt and kill the more defenceless  creatures.    Since, then, kings of the country must have a lion, the artist resolved  to make a new one. He would have some fun, at any rate.    So as painter or sculptor select men and women to pose for them in their  study as their heroes and heroines, and just as they picture plump  little boys and girls as cherubs and angels, so the"]]]
