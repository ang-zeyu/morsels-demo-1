Merrihew & Thompson, Printers, 7 Carter's alley.          TO OUR LITTLE READERS.        Listen, little children, all,      Listen to our earnest call:      You are very young, 'tis true,      But there's much that you can do.      Even you can plead with men      That they buy not slaves again,      And that those they have may be      Quickly set at liberty.      They may hearken what _you_ say,      Though from _us_ they turn away.      Sometimes, when from school you walk,      You can with your playmates talk,      Tell them of the slave child's fate,      Motherless and desolate.      And you can refuse to take      Candy, sweetmeat, pie or cake,      Saying \"no\"--unless 'tis free--      \"The slave shall not work for me.\"      Thus, dear little children, each      May some useful lesson teach;      Thus each one may help to free      This fair land from slavery.          A        A is an Abolitionist--        A man who wants to free      The wretched slave--and give to all        An equal liberty.    B        B is a Brother with a skin        Of somewhat darker hue,      But in our Heavenly Father's sight,        He is as dear as you.    C        C is the Cotton-field, to which        This injured brother's driven,      When, as the white-man's _slave_, he toils,        From early morn till even.    D        D is the Driver, cold and stern,        Who follows, whip in hand,      To punish those who dare to rest,        Or disobey command.    E        E is the Eagle, soaring high;        An emblem of the free;      But while we chain our brother man,        _Our_ type he cannot be.    F        F is the heart-sick Fugitive,        The slave who runs away,      And travels through the dreary night,        But hides himself by day.    G        G is the Gong, whose rolling sound,        Before the morning light,      Calls up the little sleeping slave,        To labor until night.    H        H is the Hound his master trained,        And called to scent the track      Of the unhappy Fugitive,        And bring him trembling back.    I        I is the Infant, from the arms        Of its fond mother torn,      And, at a public auction, sold        With horses, cows, and corn.    J        J is the Jail, upon whose floor        That wretched mother lay,      Until her cruel master came,        And carried her away.    K        K is the Kidnapper, who stole        That little child and mother--      Shrieking, it clung around her, but        He tore them from each other.    L        L is the Lash, that brutally        He swung around its head,      Threatening that \"if it cried again,        He'd whip it till 'twas dead.\"    M        M is the Merchant of the north,        Who buys what slaves produce--      So they are stolen, whipped and worked,        For his, and for our use.    N        N is the Negro, rambling free        In his far distant home,      Delighting 'neath the palm trees' shade        And cocoa-nut to roam.    O        O is the Orange tree, that bloomed        Beside his cabin door,      When white men stole him from his home        To see it never more.    P        P is the Parent, sorrowing,        And weeping all alone--      The child he loved to lean upon,        His only son, is gone!    Q        Q is the Quarter, where the slave        On coarsest food is fed,      And where, with toil and sorrow worn,        He seeks his wretched bed.    R        R is the \"Rice-swamp, dank and lone,\"        Where, weary, day by day,      He labors till the fever wastes        His strength and life away.    S        S is the Sugar, that the slave        Is toiling hard to make,      To put into your pie and tea,        Your candy, and your cake.    T        T is the rank Tobacco plant,        Raised by slave labor too:      A poisonous and nasty thing,        For gentlemen to chew.    U        U is for Upper Canada,        Where the poor slave has found      Rest after all his wanderings,        For it is British ground!    V        V is the Vessel, in whose dark,        Noisome, and stifling hold,      Hundreds of Africans are packed,        Brought o'er the seas, and sold.    W        W is the Whipping post,        To which the slave is bound,      While on his naked back, the lash        Makes many a bleeding wound.    X        X is for Xerxes, famed of yore;        A warrior stern was he      _He_ fought with swords; let truth and love        _Our_ only weapons be.    Y        Y is for Youth--the time for all        Bravely to war with sin;      And think not it can ever be        Too early to begin.    Z        Z is a Zealous man, sincere,        Faithful, and just, and true;      An earnest pleader for the slave--        Will you not be so too?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10002"],[0,"The House on the Borderland (#17)"],[1,"of my passing spirit.    I drew nigher to our system, and now I could see the shine of Jupiter.  Later, I distinguished the cold, blue gleam of the earthlight.... I had  a moment of bewilderment. All about the sun there seemed to be bright,  objects, moving in rapid orbits. Inward, nigh to the savage glory of the  sun, there circled two darting points of light, and, further off, there  flew a blue, shining speck, that I knew to be the earth. It circled the  sun in a space that seemed to be no more than an earth-minute.    ... nearer with great speed. I saw the radiances of Jupiter and  Saturn, spinning, with incredible swiftness, in huge orbits. And ever I  drew more nigh, and looked out upon this strange sight--the visible  circling of the planets about the mother sun. It was as though time had  been annihilated for me; so that a year was no more to my unfleshed  spirit, than is a moment to an earth-bound soul.    The speed of the planets, appeared to increase; and, presently, I was  watching the sun, all ringed about with hair-like circles of different  colored fire--the paths of the planets, hurtling at mighty speed, about  the central flame....    \"... the sun grew vast, as though it leapt to meet me.... And now I was  within the circling of the outer planets, and flitting swiftly, toward  the place where the earth, glimmering through the blue splendor of its  orbit, as though a fiery mist, circled the sun at a monstrous  speed....\" [3]        _XV_    THE NOISE IN THE NIGHT    And now, I come to the strangest of all the strange happenings that  have befallen me in this house of mysteries. It occurred quite  lately--within the month; and I have little doubt but that what I saw  was in reality the end of all things. However, to my story.    I do not know how it is; but, up to the present, I have never been able  to write these things down, directly they happened. It is as though I  have to wait a time, recovering my just balance, and digesting--as it  were--the things I have heard or seen. No doubt, this is as it should  be; for, by waiting, I see the incidents more truly, and write of them  in a calmer and more judicial frame of mind. This by the way.    It is now the end of November. My story relates to what happened in the  first week of the month.    It was night, about eleven o'clock. Pepper and I kept one another  company in the study--that great, old room of mine, where I read and  work. I was reading, curiously enough, the Bible. I have begun, in these  later days, to take a growing interest in that great and ancient book.  Suddenly, a distinct tremor shook the house, and there came a faint and  distant, whirring buzz, that grew rapidly into a far, muffled screaming.  It reminded me, in a queer, gigantic way, of the noise that a clock  makes, when the catch is released, and it is allowed to run down. The  sound appeared to come from some remote height--somewhere up in the  night. There was no repetition of the shock. I looked across at Pepper.  He was sleeping peacefully.    Gradually, the whirring noise decreased, and there came a long silence.    All at once, a glow lit up the end window, which protrudes far out from  the side of the house, so that, from it, one may look both East and  West. I felt puzzled, and, after a moment's hesitation, walked across  the room, and pulled aside the blind. As I did so, I saw the Sun rise,  from behind the horizon. It rose with a steady, perceptible movement. I  could see it travel upward. In a minute, it seemed, it had reached the  tops of the trees, through which I had watched it. Up, up--It was broad  daylight now. Behind me, I was conscious of a sharp, mosquito-like  buzzing. I glanced 'round, and knew that it came from the clock. Even as  I looked, it marked off an hour. The minute hand was moving 'round the  dial, faster than an ordinary second-hand. The hour hand moved quickly  from space to space. I had a numb sense of astonishment. A moment later,  so it seemed, the two candles went out, almost together. I turned  swiftly back to the window; for I had seen the shadow of the  window-frames, traveling along the floor toward me, as though a great  lamp had been carried up past the window.    I saw now, that the sun had risen high into the heavens, and was still  visibly moving. It passed above the house, with an extraordinary sailing  kind of motion. As the window came into shadow, I saw another  extraordinary thing. The fine-weather clouds were not passing, easily,  across the sky--they were scampering, as though a hundred-mile-an-hour  wind blew. As they passed, they changed their shapes a thousand times a  minute, as though writhing with a strange life; and so were gone. And,  presently, others came, and whisked away likewise.    To the West, I saw the sun, drop with an incredible, smooth, swift  motion. Eastward, the shadows of every seen thing crept toward the  coming greyness. And the movement of the shadows was visible to me--a  stealthy, writhing creep of the shadows of the wind-stirred trees. It  was a strange sight.    Quickly, the room began to darken. The sun slid down to the horizon,  and seemed, as it were, to disappear from my sight, almost with a jerk.  Through the greyness of the swift evening, I saw the silver crescent of  the moon, falling out of the Southern sky, toward the West. The evening  seemed to merge into an almost instant night. Above me, the many  constellations passed in a strange, 'noiseless' circling, Westward. The  moon fell through that last thousand fathoms of the night-gulf, and  there was only the starlight....    About this time, the buzzing in the corner ceased; telling me that the  clock had run down. A few minutes passed, and I saw the Eastward sky  lighten. A grey, sullen morning spread through all the darkness, and hid  the march of the stars. Overhead, there moved, with a heavy, everlasting  rolling, a vast, seamless sky of grey clouds--a cloud-sky that would  have seemed motionless, through all the length of an ordinary earth-day.  The sun was hidden from me; but, from moment to moment, the world would  brighten and darken, brighten and darken, beneath waves of subtle light  and shadow....    The light shifted ever Westward, and the night fell upon the earth. A  vast rain seemed to come with it, and a wind of a most extraordinary  loudness--as though the howling of a nightlong gale, were packed into  the space of no more than a minute.    This noise passed, almost immediately, and the clouds broke; so that,  once more, I could see the sky. The stars were flying Westward, with  astounding speed. It came to me now, for the first time, that, though  the noise of the wind had passed, yet a constant 'blurred' sound was in  my ears. Now that I noticed it, I was aware that it had been with me all  the time. It was the world-noise.    And then, even as I grasped at so much comprehension, there came the  Eastward light. No more than a few heartbeats, and the sun rose,  swiftly. Through the trees, I saw it, and then it was above the trees.  Up--up, it soared and all the world was light. It passed, with a swift,  steady swing to its highest altitude, and fell thence, Westward. I saw  the day roll visibly over my head. A few light clouds flittered  Northward, and vanished. The sun went down with one swift, clear plunge,  and there was about me, for a few seconds, the darker growing grey of  the gloaming.    Southward and Westward, the moon was sinking rapidly. The night had  come, already. A minute it seemed, and the moon fell those remaining  fathoms of dark sky. Another minute, or so, and the Eastward sky glowed  with the coming dawn. The sun leapt upon me with a frightening  abruptness, and soared ever more swiftly toward the zenith. Then,  suddenly, a fresh thing came to my sight. A black thundercloud rushed up  out of the South, and seemed to leap all the arc of the sky, in a single  instant. As it came, I saw that its advancing edge flapped, like a  monstrous black cloth in the heaven, twirling and undulating rapidly,  with a horrid suggestiveness. In an instant, all the air was full of  rain, and a hundred lightning flashes seemed to flood downward, as it  were in one great shower. In the same second of time, the world-noise  was drowned in the roar of the wind, and then my ears ached, under the  stunning impact of the thunder.    And, in the midst of this storm, the night came; and then, within the  space of another minute, the storm had passed, and there was only the  constant 'blur' of the world-noise on my hearing. Overhead, the stars  were sliding quickly Westward; and something, mayhaps the particular  speed to which they had attained, brought home to me, for the first  time, a keen realization of the knowledge that it was the world that  revolved. I seemed to see, suddenly, the world--a vast, dark  mass--revolving visibly against the stars.    The dawn and the sun seemed to come together, so greatly had the speed  of the world-revolution increased. The sun drove up, in one long, steady  curve; passed its highest point, and swept down into the Western sky,  and disappeared. I was scarcely conscious of evening, so brief was it.  Then I was watching the flying constellations, and the Westward  hastening moon. In but a space of seconds, so it seemed, it was sliding  swiftly downward through the night-blue, and then was gone. And, almost  directly, came the morning.    And now there seemed to come a strange acceleration. The sun made one  clean, clear sweep through the sky, and disappeared behind the Westward  horizon, and the night came and went with a like haste.    As the succeeding day, opened and closed upon the world, I was aware of  a sweat of snow, suddenly upon the earth. The night came, and, almost  immediately, the day. In the brief leap of the sun, I saw that the snow  had vanished; and then, once more, it was night.    Thus matters were; and, even after the many incredible things that I  have"]]]
