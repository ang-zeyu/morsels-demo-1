All your latent energies are lying unused. Back of your conscious  mentality are tremendous energies awaiting the pull of your will. When  your brain conceives of being something unusually great, at least so it  may appear from your view-point, do not question your strength but go  ahead unhesitatingly, fearlessly and steadily. Assert your life-force.  Feel that you are young, strong and healthy and fit. Live in mental  consciousness of power and never think of weakness. Keep your grip and  run right along. Nature is sure to honor your draft. Nature is sure to  give you strength, energy and vim, in boundless measure. Just try this  my friends, you, who write me of \"there being a serious lack of vitality\"  in your system and hence your inability to grapple with the occult. No  such thing. Fact is you lack courage and initiative, pluck and \"go\" and  you are labouring under the hypnotism of weakening thoughts. Just change  your thoughts, and your reserve forces will rush out into activity  and you will be a changed man in no time.      HOW TO EXERCISE.    In exercising aim at rhythm of motion. Let your movements be easy,  regular, rhythmic and graceful. Take an interest in your work. Do pay  attention. Put Will-Power and Mind into your work. Think of all it means.  Do not fatigue yourself unduly. After exercise towelling or a spray-bath  is advisable. Wet your towel, pass it over your body, rubbing thoroughly.  Raise the towel and repeat. After exercise and towelling, you should be  in a splendid glow. Be sure to keep the windows open when exercising.  Fresh air is an absolute necessity. Never mind about cold and so forth.  Remember the Positive Denial will fill you with Power of Resistance. Say  \"Cold cannot affect my body\" and believe what you say. You can face  anything in this way and remain untouched.      BATHING AND LINEN.    The student should bathe daily, using plenty of water, rubbing and  cleaning the body from top to toe. I myself bathe very early in the  morning, in all seasons, in cold water. Cold water stimulates circulation  and is a wonderful tonic internally and externally. Warm water is  soothing and relaxing in its effect. If you can bathe in the flowing  water of a river, so much the better. Swimming is a wonderful bracer,  besides being an enjoyment in itself. There is Prana in water and your  body extracts this Prana from air, water and food. I cannot give you  instructions as to different forms of bathing, as this is not a \"doctor\"  book. As far as possible bathe twice a day, mornings and evenings; if  not, once in the morning, using the towel at other times. Bathing is not  merely pouring water on body but cleansing it out and out with water  rubbing and scrubbing with hands and towels. Aim at perfect cleanliness.  Cleanliness is Godliness and Health is Holiness.    Then again while bathing if you let the water flow over your body  and try to \"appreciate the sensation\" and dwell on the idea of  Prana-absorption from water, you shall get double benefit.    About linen--_Be neat_, for God's sake. I have seen orthodox people  who bathe twice and wash their hands hundreds of times in the day, but  whose clothes are sticky with dirt, sweat and oil. Whatever else it may  mean, Religion does not mean squalor, offensive odours in body and  clothes and general neglect of external clean linen and dirt. The Yogi  is a man of supreme REFINEMENT. Read that word and understand all it  means. The clothes you wear in day-time should not be worn at night. Be  clean internally as well externally. Be clean. Be clean. Be clean, within  as well as without.      DRINKING WATER AND SWALLOWING AIR.    Your body needs a reasonable supply of water and air. Water is used by  nature in different ways. Form the habit of drinking pure water from  5 to 8 tumblers a day. Drink slowly and form a mental image of  Prana-absorption from the water.    The student needs fresh air too in plenty. If your heart and lungs  are in sound condition they will draw in air naturally and extract oxygen  in proper quantities. If not, perform the following exercises carefully  one by one in the open air every day. They are quite reliable.      THE YOGI CLEANSING BREATH.    (1) Inhale a complete breath. (2) Retain the air a few seconds.  (3) Pucker up the lips as if for a whistle (but do not swell out the  cheeks) then exhale a little air through the opening with considerable  vigor. Then stop for a moment retaining the air and then exhale a little  more air. Repeat until the air is completely exhaled. Remember that  considerable vigor is to be used in exhaling air through the opening in  the lips. This breath will be found quite refreshing when one is tired  and generally \"used up.\" A trial will convince the student of its merits.  This exercise should be practised until it can be performed naturally and  easily, as it is used to finish up a number of other exercises given in  this book and it should be thoroughly understood.      NERVE VITALISING BREATH.    (1) Stand erect. (2) Inhale a complete breath and retain same. (3) Extend  the arms straight in front of you, letting them somewhat limp and  relaxed, with only sufficient nerve force to hold them out. (4) Slowly  draw the hands back towards the shoulders gradually, contracting the  muscles and putting force into them, so that when they reach the  shoulders the fists will be so tightly clenched that a tremulous motion  is felt. (5) Then keeping the muscles tense push the fists slowly out and  then draw them back rapidly (still tense) several times. (6) Exhale  vigorously through the mouth. (7) Practise the cleansing breath. (8)  The efficiency of this exercise depends greatly upon the speed of the  drawing back of the fists, and the tension of the muscles, and, of course  upon the full lungs. This exercise must be tried to be appreciated. It  is without equal as a \"bracer\" as our western friends put it.      THE VOCAL BREATH.    (1) Inhale a complete breath very slowly, but steadily, through the  nostrils, taking as much time as possible in the inhalation. (2) Retain  for a few seconds. (3) Expel the air vigorously in one great breath,  through the wide-opened mouth. (4) Rest the lungs by the cleansing  breath. This would give you a good, rolling voice.      THE RETAINED BREATH.    (1) Stand erect. (2) Inhale a complete breath. (3) Retain the  breath as long as you can comfortably. (4) Exhale vigorously through  the open mouth. (5) Practise the cleansing breath. At first you will  be able to retain the breath only a short time, but a little practise  will also show a great improvement. Time yourself with a watch, if you  wish to note your progress.      CELL STIMULATION.    (1) Stand erect with hands in sides. (2) Breathe in very slowly and  gradually. (3) While inhaling, gently tap the chest with the fingertips,  constantly changing position. (4) When the lungs are filled, retain the  breath and the chest with the palms of the hands. (5) Practise the  cleansing breath.      RIB STRETCHING.    (1) Stand erect. (2) Place the hands one on each side of the body  as high up in the armpits as convenient, the thumbs reaching towards  the back, the palms on the side of the chest and the fingers to the front  over the breast. (3) Inhale a complete breath. (4) Retain the air for  a short time. (5) Then gently squeeze the sides at the same time slowly  exhaling. (6) Practise the cleansing breath.      CHEST EXPANSION    (1) Stand erect. (2) Inhale a complete breath. (3) Retain the  air. (4) Extend both arms forward and bring the two clenched fists  together on a level with the shoulder. (5) Then swing back the fists  vigorously until the arms stand out straight side-ways from the  shoulders. (6) Then bring back to position (4) and swing to position  (5). Repeat several times. (7) Exhale vigorously through the open mouth.  (8) Practise the cleansing breath.      WALKING EXERCISE.    (1) Walk with head up, chin drawn slightly in, shoulders back, and  with measured tread. (2) Inhale a complete breath, counting (mentally)  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, one count to each step making the inhalation  extend over the eight counts. (3) Exhale slowly through the nostrils,  counting as before 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, one count to a step. (4) Rest  between breaths, continuing, walking and counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,  one count to a step. (5) Repeat until you begin to feel tired. Then rest  for a while and resume at pleasure. Repeat several times a day. You may  vary the exercise by retaining the breath during a 1, 2, 3, 4, count and  then exhale in an eight-step count. Practise whichever plan seems most  agreeable to you.      MORNING EXERCISE.    (1) Stand erect in a military attitude, head up, eyes front, shoulders  back, knees stiff, hands at sides. (2) Raise body slowly on toes,  inhaling a complete breath, steadily and slowly. (3) Retain the breath  for a few seconds, maintaining the same position. (4) Slowly sink the  first position at the same time slowly exhaling the air through the  nostrils. (5) Practise cleansing breath. (6) Repeat several times,  varying by using right leg alone, then left leg alone.      STIMULATING CIRCULATION.    (1) Stand erect. (2) Inhale a complete breath and retain. (3) Bend  forward slightly and grasp a stick or cane steadily and firmly, and  gradually exerting your entire strength upon the grasp. (4) Relax the  grasp, return to first position, and slowly exhale. (5) Repeat several  times. (6) Finish with the cleansing breath. (N. B.--_The above are  from the Yoga Teachings_.)      MEDITATION EXERCISE No. I.    Retire into the silence. Say: I AM FEARLESS. Concentrate calmly on that  idea. Think it out in all its bearings.

The Greek [Greek: elephas], to  which we are immediately indebted for it, did not originally mean the  animal, but, as early as the time of Homer, was applied only to its  tusks, and signified _ivory_. BOCHART has sought for a Semitic origin,  and seizing on the Arabic _fil_, and prefixing the article _al_,  suggests _alfil_, akin to [Greek: eleph]; but rejecting this, BOCHART  himself resorts to the Hebrew _eleph_, an \"ox\"--and this conjecture  derives a certain degree of countenance from the fact that the Romans,  when they obtained their first sight of the elephant in the army of  Pyrrhus, in Lucania, called it the _Luca bos_. But the [Greek: antos] is  still unaccounted for; and POTT has sought to remove the difficulty by  introducing the Arabic _hindi_, Indian, s thus making _eleph-hindi_,  \"_bos Indicus_.\" The conversion of _hindi_ into [Greek: antos] is an  obstacle, but here the example of \"tamarind\" comes to aid; _tamar  hindi_, the \"Indian date,\" which in mediaeval Greek forms [Greek:  tamarenti]. A theory of Benary, that helhephas might be compounded of  the Arabic _al_, and _ibha_, a Sanskrit name for the elephant, is  exposed to still greater etymological exception. PICTET'S solution is,  that in the Sanskrit epics \"the King of Elephants,\" who has the  distinction of carrying the god Indra, is called _airarata_ or  _airavana_, a modification of _airavanta_, \"son of the ocean,\" which  again comes from _iravat_, \"abounding in water.\" \"Nous aurions done  ainsi, comme correlatif du gree [Greek: elephanto], une ancienne forme,  _airavanta_ ou _ailavanta_, affaiblie plus tard en _airavata_ ou  _airavana_.... On connait la predilection de l'elephant pour le  voisinage des fleuves, et son amour pour l'eau, dont l'abondance est  necessaire a son bien-etre.\" This Sanskrit name, PICTET supposes, may  have been carried to the West by the Phoenicians, who were the purveyors  of ivory from India; and, from the Greek, the Latins derived _elephas_,  which passed into the modern languages of Italy, Germany, and France.  But it is curious that the Spaniards acquired from the Moors their  Arabic term for ivory, _marfil_, and the Portuguese _marfim_; and that  the Scandinavians, probably from their early expeditions to the  Mediterranean, adopted _fill_ as their name for the elephant itself, and  _fil-bein_ for ivory; in Danish, _fils-ben_. (See _Journ. Asiat._ 1843,  t. xliii. p. 133.) The Spaniards of South America call the palm which  produces the vegetable ivory (_Phytelephas macrocarpa_) _Palma de  marfil_, and the nut itself, _marfil vegetal_.    Since the above was written Gooneratne Modliar, the Singhalese  Interpreter to the Supreme Court at Colombo, has supplied me with  another conjecture, that the word elephant may possibly be traced to the  Singhalese name of the animal, _alia_, which means literally, \"the huge  one.\" _Alia_, he adds, is not a derivation from Sanskrit or Pali, but  belongs to a dialect more ancient than either.]    From time immemorial the natives have been taught to capture and tame  them and the export of elephants from Ceylon to India has been going on  without interruption from the period of the first Punic War.[1] In later  times all elephants were the property of the Kandyan crown; and their  capture or slaughter without the royal permission was classed amongst  the gravest offences in the criminal code.    [Footnote 1: AELIAN, _de Nat. Anim._ lib. xvi. c. 18; COSMAS INDICOPL.,  p. 128.]    In recent years there is reason to believe that their numbers have  become considerably reduced. They have entirely disappeared from  localities in which they were formerly numerous[1]; smaller herds have  been taken in the periodical captures for the government service, and  hunters returning from the chase report them to be growing scarce. In  consequence of this diminution the peasantry in some parts of the island  have even suspended the ancient practice of keeping watchers and fires  by night to drive away the elephants from their growing crops.[2] The  opening of roads and the clearing of the mountain forests of Kandy for  the cultivation of coffee, have forced the animals to retire to the low  country, where again they have been followed by large parties of  European sportsmen; and the Singhalese themselves, being more freely  provided with arms than in former times, have assisted in swelling the  annual slaughter.[3]    [Footnote 1: LE BRUN, who visited Ceylon A.D. 1705, says that in the  district round Colombo, where elephants are now never seen, they were  then so abundant, that 160 had been taken in a single corral. (_Voyage_,  &c., tom. ii. ch. lxiii. p. 331.)]    [Footnote 2: In some parts of Bengal, where elephants were formerly  troublesome (especially near the wilds of Ramgur), the natives got rid  of them by mixing a preparation of the poisonous Nepal root called  _dakra_ in balls of grain, and other materials, of which the animal is  fond. In Cuttack, above fifty years ago, mineral poison was laid for  them in the same way, and the carcases of eighty were found which had  been killed by it. (_Asiat. Res._, xv. 183.)]    [Footnote 3: The number of elephants has been similarly reduced  throughout the south of India.]    Had the motive that incites to the destruction of the elephant in Africa  and India prevailed in Ceylon, that is, had the elephants there been  provided with tusks, they would long since have been annihilated for the  sake of their ivory.[1] But it is a curious fact that, whilst in Africa  and India both sexes have tusks[2], with some slight disproportion in  the size of those of the females: not one elephant in a hundred is found  with tusks in Ceylon, and the few that possess them are exclusively  males. Nearly all, however, have those stunted processes called  _tushes_, about ten or twelve inches in length and one or two in  diameter. These I have observed them to use in loosening earth,  stripping off bark, and snapping asunder small branches and climbing  plants; and hence tushes are seldom seen without a groove worn into them  near their extremities.[3]    [Footnote 1: The annual importation of ivory into Great Britain alone,  for the last few years, has been about _one million_ pounds; which,  taking the average weight of a tusk at sixty pounds, would require the  slaughter of 8,333 male elephants.    But of this quantity the importation from Ceylon has generally averaged  only five or six hundred weight; which, making allowance for the  lightness of the tusks, would not involve the destruction of more than  seven or eight in each year. At the same time, this does not fairly  represent the annual number of tuskers shot in Ceylon, not only because  a portion of the ivory finds its way to China and to other places, but  because the chiefs and Buddhist priests have a passion for collecting  tusks, and the finest and largest are to be found ornamenting their  temples and private dwellings. The Chinese profess that for their  exquisite carvings the ivory of Ceylon excels all other, both in density  of texture and in delicacy of tint; but in the European market, the  ivory of Africa, from its more distinct graining and other causes,  obtains a higher price.]    [Footnote 2: A writer in the _India Sporting Review_ for October 1857  says, \"In Malabar a tuskless male elephant is rare; I have seen but  two.\"--p. 157.]    [Footnote 3: The old fallacy is still renewed, that the elephant sheds  his tusks. AELIAN says he drops them once in ten years (lib. xiv. c. 5):  and PLINY repeats the story, adding that, when dropped, the elephants  hide them under ground (lib. viii.) whence SHAW says, in his _Zoology_,  \"they are frequently found in the woods,\" and exported from Africa (vol.  i. p. 213): and Sir W. JARDINE in the _Naturalist's Library_ (vol. ix.  p. 110), says, \"the tusks are shed about the twelfth or thirteenth  year.\" This is erroneous: after losing the first pair, or, as they are  called, the \"milk tusks,\" which drop in consequence of the absorption of  their roots, when the animal is extremely young, the second pair acquire  their full size, and become the \"permanent tusks,\" which are never  shed.]    Amongst other surmises more ingenious than sound, the general absence of  tusks in the elephant of Ceylon has been associated with the profusion  of rivers and streams in the island; whilst it has been thrown out as a  possibility that in Africa, where water is comparatively scarce, the  animal is equipped with these implements in order to assist it in  digging wells in the sand and in raising the juicy roots of the mimosas  and succulent plants for the sake of their moisture. In support of this  hypothesis, it has been observed, that whilst the tusks of the Ceylon  species, which are never required for such uses, are slender, graceful  and curved, seldom exceeding fifty or sixty pounds' weight, those of the  African elephant are straight and thick, weighing occasionally one  hundred and fifty, and even three hundred pounds.[1]    [Footnote 1: Notwithstanding the inferiority in weight of the Ceylon  tusks, as compared with those of the elephant of India, it would, I  think, be precipitate to draw the inference that the size of the former  was uniformly and naturally less than that of the latter. The truth, I  believe to be, that if permitted to grow to maturity, the tusks of the  one would, in all probability, equal those of the other; but, so eager  is the search for ivory in Ceylon, that a tusker, when once observed in  a herd, is followed up with such vigilant impatience, that he is almost  invariably shot before attaining his full growth. General DE LIMA, when  returning from the governorship of the Portuguese settlements at  Mozambique, told me, in 1848, that he had been requested to procure two  tusks of the largest size, and straightest possible shape, which were to  be formed"]]]
