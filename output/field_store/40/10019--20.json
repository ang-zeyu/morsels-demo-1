Thus we  are in a fair way to have plenty of work, palavering with the natives and  protecting the colonists. Not improbably, the latter have felt encouraged,  by the presence of our squadron, to assume a higher tone towards the  natives than heretofore. But we shall see.    8.--We landed, this morning, with nine armed boats, to examine into the  difficulties above alluded to. The first duty that it fell to our lot to  perform, was one of humanity. We had scarcely reached Governor Russwurm's  house, when, observing a crowd of people about a mile off, on the beach,  we learned that a man was undergoing the ordeal of drinking sassy-wood.  The Commodore, with most of the officers, hastened immediately to the  rescue. On approaching the spot, we saw a woman with an infant on her  back, walking to and fro, wailing bitterly, and throwing up her arms in  agony. Further on, we met four children, from eight to twelve years of  age, crying loudly as they came towards us, and apparently imploring us to  save their father. Beyond them, and as near the crowd as she dared go,  stood a young woman, supporting herself on a staff, with the tears  streaming down her cheeks, while she gazed earnestly at the spot where her  husband was suffering. Although she took no notice of us, her low moans  were more impressive than the vociferous agony of the former woman; and we  could not but suppose that the man was peculiarly amiable in the domestic  relations, since his impending fate awakened more grief in the hearts of  _two_ wives, than, in civilized life, we generally see exhibited by one.  Meeting a colonist, with intelligence that the victim was nearly dead, we  quickened our pace to a fast run.    Before we could reach the spot, however, the man had been put into a  canoe, and paddled out into a lagoon by one of the party, while the  remainder moved on to meet us. The Commodore ordered two of the leaders to  be seized and kept prisoners, until the drinker of sassy-wood should be  given up. This had the desired effect; and, in half an hour, there came to  the Government House a hard-featured man of about fifty, escorted by a  crowd, no small portion of which was composed of his own multifarious  wives and children, all displaying symptoms of high satisfaction. He  looked much exhausted, but was taken into the house and treated medically,  with the desired success. When sufficiently recovered he will be sent to a  neighboring town, where he must remain, until permitted by the customs of  his people to return. He had been subjected to the ordeal, in order to  test the truth or falsehood of an accusation brought against him, of  having caused the death of a man of consequence, by incantations and  necromantic arts. In such cases, a strong decoction of the sassy-wood bark  is the universally acknowledged medium of coming at the truth. The natives  believe that the tree has a supernatural quality, potent in destroying  witches and driving out evil spirits; nor, although few escape, do the  accused persons often object to quaffing the deadly draught. If it fail to  operate fatally, it is generally by the connivance of those who administer  it, in concocting the potion of such strength that the stomach shall  reject it. Should the suspected wizard escape the operation of the  sassy-wood, it is customary to kill him by beating on the head with clubs  and stones; his property is forfeited; and the party accusing him feast on  the cattle of their victim. The man whom we rescued had taken a gallon of  the decoction the previous evening, and about the same quantity just  before we interrupted the ordeal. His wealth had probably excited the envy  of his accusers.    We had just returned to the Government House and were about to seat  ourselves at the dinner-table, when an alarm-gun was heard from Mount  Tubman. A messenger soon arrived to say that the natives were attempting  to force their way through the settlement, to the Cape. The marines,  together with all the officers who could be spared, were instantly on the  march. The Commodore and Governor Russwurm led the force, on horseback;  the flag-lieutenant and myself being the only other officers fortunate  enough to procure animals. Mine was the queerest charger on which a knight  ever rode to battle; a little donkey, scarcely high enough to keep my feet  from the ground; so lazy that I could only force him into a trot by the  continual prick of my sword; and so vicious that he threw me twice, in  requital of my treatment. The rest of the detachment footed it four miles,  on a sandy road, and under the scorching sun. On the way we overtook  several armed colonists, hurrying to the point of danger. Passing the foot  of Mount Vaughan we reached Mount Tubman, and, ascending a steep, conical  hill, found ourselves on a level space of a hundred yards in diameter,  with a strong picket-fence surrounding it, and a solitary house in the  centre. Fifteen or sixteen armed men were on the watch, as conscious of  the neighborhood of an enemy; the piazza was crowded with women and  children; and from the interior of the house came the merry voices of  above a score of little boys and girls, ignorant of danger, and enjoying a  high frolic. Apart, by the wall, sat a blind man, grasping his staff with  a tremulous hand; and near him lay a sick woman, who had been brought in  from a neighboring farm-house. All these individuals, old and young, had  been driven hither for refuge by the alarm of war.    Not far off, we beheld tokens that an attack had been made, and sternly  resisted by the little garrison of the stockade. On the side opposite the  Cape, a steep path rose towards the gate. Some twenty yards down this  passage lay a native, dead, with an ugly hole in his scull; and, in a  narrow path to the right, was stretched another, who had met his death  from a bullet-wound in the centre of his forehead. The ball had cut the  ligature which bound his \"greegree\" of shells around his head, and the  faithless charm lay on the ground beside him. Already, the flies were  beginning to cluster about the dead man's mouth. The attacking party, to  which these slain individuals belonged, were of the Barroky tribe. It is  supposed that, knowing King Freeman to be at variance with the colonists,  and hearing the salute in honor of the Commodore's landing, they mistook  it for the commencement of hostilities, and came in to support the native  party and gather spoil.    As their repulse had evidently been decisive, we looked around us to enjoy  the extensive and diversified view from the summit of the hill. Casting  our eyes along the road which we had just passed, the principal settlement  was visible, consisting of two separate villages, intermingled with large  native towns, the dwellings in which greatly outnumbered those of the  colonists. On one side of the rude promontory ran a small river; on the  other, the sea rolled its unquiet waves. At a short distance from the  shore was seen the rocky islet, bearing the name of Go-to-Hell, where the  natives bury their dead. Northward, were the farms of those whom the  recent hostile incursion had driven to this place of refuge. In various  directions, several spurs of hills were visible, on one of which,  glittering among the trees, appeared the white edifices of the Mount  Vaughan Episcopal Mission.    On our return, some of the party halted at the Mission establishment; but  I urged my little donkey onward, and, though this warlike episode had cost  me a dinner, made my re-appearance at the Governor's table in time for the  dessert.          CHAPTER IX.    Palaver with King Freeman--Remarks on the Influence of  Missionaries--Palaver at Rock Boukir--Narrative of Captain Farwell's  Murder--Scene of Embarkation through the Surf--Sail for Little Berebee.      _December_ 9.--At Cape Palmas. We again landed, as on the preceding day,  and met the redoubtable King Freeman, and twenty-three other kings and  headmen from the tribes in the vicinity. The palaver, like that at Sinoe,  was held in the Methodist Church; the Commodore, the Governor, and several  officers and colonists, appearing on one side, and the natives on the  other. There were several striking countenances among the four-and-twenty  negro potentates, and some, even, that bore the marks of native greatness;  as might well be the case, in a system of society where rank and authority  are, in a great measure, the result of individual talent and force of  character. One head man was very like Henry Clay, both in face and figure.  It is remarkable, too, that one of the chiefs at Sinoe not only had a  strong personal resemblance to the same distinguished statesman--being, as  it were, his image in ebony, or bronze--but, while not speaking, moved  constantly about the palaver-house, as is Mr. Clay's habit in the  senate-chamber. The interpreter, on the present occasion, Yellow Will by  name, was dressed in a crimson mantle of silk damask, poncho-shaped, and  trimmed with broad gold lace.    The palaver being opened, the colonists complained that the chiefs had  raised to double what it had been, or ought to be, the prices of rice and  other products, for which the settlements were dependent upon the natives;  also, that they would permit no merchant vessels to communicate with the  colonial town. On representation of these grievances, the Kings agreed to  rescind the obnoxious regulations. This, however, did not satisfy the  Governor, who had hoped to induce King Freeman to remove his town to  another site, and allow the colonists more room. As matters at present  stand, the King's capital city is within three hundred yards of Governor  Russwurm's house, and entirely disunites the colonial settlements on the  Cape. In case of war, the communication between these two sections of the  town of Harper would be completely broken off.

We are now slowly, very slowly, struggling back to  Zeebrugge.    A green sea came down the conning tower to-day, and everything in the  boat is damp and smelly and beastly. The propellers race at frequent  intervals and the whole boat shudders--I feel miserable.    Alten has started to drink spirits; he began as soon as we decided to  go back. He will be incapable by to-night, and it means that I shall  have to take her in.    What hell this is, sitting in sodden clothes, with the stench of four  days' living assaulting the nostrils, and a motion of the devil; the  glass is very low and is slowly rising, so that I suppose it will blow  harder soon, though it is about force eight at present.    I wonder what Zoe will have written in reply to my note. When I think  of what I rejected and compare it with my beast-like existence here, I  can hardly believe that I behaved as I did--what would I not give now  to be transported back to the forest! At this rate of progress we shall  take another 24 hours. I wonder if I can knock another half-knot out of  her without smashing her up.           *       *       *       *       *    The extraordinarily violent motion has upset the _Anschutz_. [1] The  bearing cone of the stabilizing gyro has cracked, and the master  compass began to wander off in circles. I was just resting for an hour  or two, wedged up on a wet settee with coats equally wet, when her  heavy pitching changed to a wallowing roll, and I heard the pilot, who  was on watch, cursing down the voice-pipe, as we had sagged off our  course.    [Footnote 1: Gyroscopic compass.--ETIENNE.]    I heard the voice of the helmsman querulously maintain that he was  steering his course by _Anschutz_, so I got up and gingerly clawed my  way into the control room, where I found by comparing _Anschutz_ with  magnetic that the former had gone to hell, the reason being obvious, as  the stabilizer was exerting a strongly biased torque. I stopped the  _Anschutz_ and asked the pilot to give the helmsman a steady by  magnetic.    As we staggered back to our course I heard a thud in the wardroom, and  on returning to my settee found that Alten had rolled out of his bunk,  where he was lying in a drunken stupor, and that he was face downwards,  sprawling on the deck, half his face in the broken half of a dirty dish  which had fallen off the table whilst I was having tea. As I couldn't  let the crew see him like this, I was obliged to struggle and get him  back into his bunk. He was like a log and absolutely incapable of  rendering me any assistance, though he did open his eyes and mutter  once or twice as I lifted him up, trunk first and then his legs. He  stank of spirits and I hated touching him. Lord! what a truly hoggish  man he is; yet I cannot help envying him his oblivion to these  surroundings.           *       *       *       *       *        Arrived in, this afternoon.      Alten quite slept off his drink, and was offensively sarcastic as I  worked on the forepart with wires, getting her into the shelters  alongside the mole.    I hastened up to Bruges, and in the Mess heard several items of news  and found two letters. The first, in a well-known handwriting, I opened  eagerly, but received a chill of disappointment when I read its single  line.    \"I am here when you want me.--Z.\"    So she thinks to break my resolution!    No! I am stronger than she, and, now that I know she loves me, I can  and will bend her to my will. Even now, at this distance of time, I can  hardly understand my conduct the other day. I must have been given the  strength of ten. I feel that I could not do it again; had she hesitated  a second longer at the door--well, I can hardly say what I would have  done.    It is my duty to do so, for her sake and my own. But I know my  weakness, and in this fact lies my strength. Cost what it may, I shall  not permit myself to go near her until she yields.    The second letter gave me a great surprise. It was from Rosa. She has  passed some examination, and is coming _here_ of all places as a Red  Cross nurse. She says she is looking forward to going round a U-boat!  She assumes a good deal, I must say, still, I suppose I must be polite  to her; but why the deuce does she sign herself \"Yours, Rosa?\" She's  not mine, and I don't want her; it seems funny to me that I once  thought of her vaguely in that sort of way. Now, I feel rather  disturbed that she is coming here, though I don't quite see why I  should worry, and yet I wonder if it is a coincidence her coming to  Bruges?    I'm almost inclined to think it isn't. After all, every girl wants to  get married, and without conceit my family, circumstances and, in the  privacy of the pages of this journal I may add, my personal  appearances, are such as would appeal to most girls--except Zoe,  apparently!    I'll have to be on my guard against Miss Rosa.    I heard to-day that I am likely to be appointed to the periscope school  in a few weeks' time, and meanwhile I am to be attached as  supernumerary to the operations division on old Max's staff.           *       *       *       *       *    The work here is most interesting. I feel glad that I am one of the  spiders weaving the web for Britain's destruction.    The impasse with Zoe still continues, and my peace of mind has been  still further disturbed by the actual arrival of Rosa. She rang me up  within twelve hours of her arrival, and, of course, I was obliged to  call. That was the day before yesterday. Rosa is at the No. 3 Hospital  here, and was horribly effusive. Some people would, I suppose, call her  good-looking, but to me, with my mind's-eye in perpetual contemplation  of my darling Zoe, Rosa looked like a turnip. Her first movement after  the preliminary greetings was to offer me a cigarette! I then noticed  that her fingers were stained with nicotine, unpleasant in a man,  disgusting in a woman.    Her nose was shiny and greasy--horrible. After a little talk she  volunteered the statement that yesterday was her afternoon off, and she  was simply longing to have tea in the gardens.    I endeavoured to make some feeble excuse on the grounds of the weather  being unsuitable, but I am no good at these social lies, and I was  eventually obliged to promise to take her there. I was the more annoyed  in that her main object was obviously to be seen walking with a U-boat  officer.    Accordingly, yesterday, I found myself walking about with her at my  side. My feelings can better be imagined than described when I suddenly  saw Zoe, accompanied by Babette, in the distance. I hastily altered  course, and pray she didn't see me.    In the course of the afternoon Rosa had the impertinence to say that at  Frankfurt they were saying that I was interested in a beautiful widow  at Bruges, and could she (Rosa) write and say I was heart-whole, or  else what the girl was like. I'm afraid that I lost my temper a little,  and I told Rosa she could write to all the busybodies at home and tell  them from me to go to the devil.    These women in the home circle, and especially aunts, are always the  same; firstly, they badger one to get married, and then if they think  one is contemplating such a step they are all agog to find out whether  she is suitable!           *       *       *       *       *    Three more boats, two of which are U.C.'s, are overdue. It is  distinctly unpleasant not knowing how or where they go, though the U.B.  boat (Friederich Althofen) made her incoming position the day before  yesterday as off Dungeness, so it looks as if the barrage at Dover  which got Weissman has got Althofen as well. I wonder what new devilry  they have put down there.    How one wishes that in 1914, instead of seeking the capture of Paris,  we had realized the importance of the Channel Ports to England, and  struck for them!    It would not have been necessary to strike even in September, 1914. We  could have walked into them. Dunkirk, at all events, should have been  ours; however, we must do the best with things as they are, not that I  would consider it too late even now to make a big push for the French  coast.    It would seem, as a matter of fact, that all the pushing is to be at  the other end of the line, in the Verdun sector, from the rumours I  hear, though I should have thought once bitten twice shy in that  quarter.           *       *       *       *       *    Saw Zoe again in the distance, and I think she saw me; at all events  she turned round and walked away.    This girl whom I cannot, and would not if I could, obliterate from my  thoughts, is causing me much worry.    She shows no sign of giving in, and I for one intend to be adamant. I  shall defeat her in time. The male intellect is always ultimately  victorious, other things being equal. I was reading Schopenhauer on the  subject last night. What a brain that man had, though I confess his  analysis of the female mentality is so terribly and truthfully cruel  that it jars on certain of my feelings.    Zoe's resolution in this conflict, this sex war one might call it, only  adds to her charm in my eyes; she is, I feel, a worthy mate for me,  both intellectually and physically, and she shall be mine--I have  decided it.    Met Rosa to-day at old Max's house, where I went to pay a duty call.    Her Excellency is as forbidding a specimen of her sex as any I have  ever met. She quite frightened me, and in the home circle the old man  seemed quite subdued.    I escorted Rosa home, and on the way to her hospital she gave me a  great surprise, as after much evasive talk she suddenly came out with  the news that she was engaged to Heinrich Baumer, of U.C.23. I was  quite taken aback, and will frankly confess that not so very long ago I  imagined, evidently erroneously, that she was"]]]
