O'er her fair limbs convulsive tremors fleet,  70    Start in her hands, and struggle in her feet;          In vain to scream with quivering lips she tries,          And strains in palsy'd lids her tremulous eyes;          In vain she _wills_ to run, fly, swim, walk, creep;          The WILL presides not in the bower of SLEEP.  75    --On her fair bosom sits the Demon-Ape          Erect, and balances his bloated shape;      [_The Will presides not._ 1. 74. Sleep consists in the abolition of all  voluntary power, both over our muscular motions and our ideas; for we  neither walk nor reason in sleep. But, at the same time, many of our  muscular motions, and many of our ideas, continue to be excited into  action in consequence of internal irritations and of internal sensations;  for the heart and arteries continue to beat, and we experience variety  of passions, and even hunger and thirst in our dreams. Hence I conclude,  that our nerves of sense are not torpid or inert during sleep; but that  they are only precluded from the perception of external objects, by their  external organs being rendered unfit to transmit to them the appulses of  external bodies, during the suspension of the power of volition; thus the  eye-lids are closed in sleep, and I suppose the tympanum of the car is  not stretched, because they are deprived of the voluntary exertions of  the muscles appropriated to these purposes; and it is probable something  similar happens to the external apparatus of our other organs of sense,  which may render them unfit for their office of perception during sleep:  for milk put into the mouths of sleeping babes occasions them to swallow  and suck; and, if the eye-lid is a little opened in the day-light by the  exertions of disturbed sleep, the person dreams of being much dazzled.

Arm'd with her ivory beak, and talon-hands,  80    Descending FICA dives into the sands;          Chamber'd in earth with cold oblivion lies;          Nor heeds, _ye Suitor-train_, your amorous sighs;          Erewhile with renovated beauty blooms,          Mounts into air, and moves her leafy plumes.  85    --Where HAMPS and MANIFOLD, their cliffs among,          Each in his flinty channel winds along;          With lucid lines the dusky Moor divides,          Hurrying to intermix their sister tides.      [When there arises in sleep a painful desire to exert the voluntary  motions, it is called the Nightmare or Incubus. When the sleep becomes so  imperfect that some muscular motions obey this exertion of desire, people  have walked about, and even performed some domestic offices in sleep;  one of these sleep-walkers I have frequently seen: once she smelt of a  tube-rose, and sung, and drank a dish of tea in this state; her awaking  was always attended with prodigious surprize, and even fear; this disease  had daily periods, and seemed to be of the epileptic kind.]    [_Ficus indica_. l. 80.

Near the village of Wetton, a mile or two above  Dove-Dale, near Ashburn in Dirbyshire, there is a spacious cavern about  the middle of the ascent of the mountain, which still retains the Name of  Thor's house; below is an extensive and romantic common, where the rivers  Hamps and Manifold sink into the earth, and rise again in Ham gardens,  the seat of John Port, Esq. about three miles below. Where these rivers  rise again there are impressions resembling Fish, which appear to be of  Jasper bedded in Limestone. Calcareous Spars, Shells converted into a  kind of Agate, corallines in Marble, ores of Lead, Copper, and Zinc, and  many strata of Flint, or Chert, and of Toadstone, or Lava, abound in this  part of the country. The Druids are said to have offered human sacrifices  inclosed in wicker idols to Thor. Thursday had its name from this Deity.    The broken appearance of the surface of many parts of this country; with  the Swallows, as they are called, or basons on some of the mountains,  like volcanic Craters, where the rain-water sinks into the earth; and the  numerous large stones, which seem to have been thrown over the land by  volcanic explosions; as well as the great masses of Toadstone or Lava;  evince the existence of violent earthquakes at some early period of the  world. At this time the channels of these subterraneous rivers seem to  have been formed, when a long tract of rocks were raised by the sea  flowing in upon the central fires, and thus producing an irresistable  explosion of steam; and when these rocks again subsided, their parts  did not exactly correspond, but left a long cavity arched over in this  operation of nature. The cavities at Castleton and Buxton in Derbyshire  seem to have had a similar origin, as well as this cavern termed Thor's  house.

While from above descends in milky streams          One scanty pencil of illusive beams,          Suspended crags and gaping gulphs illumes,  100  And gilds the horrors of the deepen'd glooms.          --Here oft the Naiads, as they chanced to play          Near the dread Fane on THOR'S returning day,          Saw from red altars streams of guiltless blood          Stain their green reed-beds, and pollute their flood;  105  Heard dying babes in wicker prisons wail,          And shrieks of matrons thrill the affrighted Gale;          While from dark caves infernal Echoes mock,          And Fiends triumphant shout from every rock!          ---So still the Nymphs emerging lift in air  110  Their snow-white shoulders and their azure hair;          Sail with sweet grace the dimpling streams along,          Listening the Shepherd's or the Miner's song;          But, when afar they view the giant-cave,          On timorous fins they circle on the wave,  115  With streaming eyes and throbbing hearts recoil,          Plunge their fair forms, and dive beneath the soil.--          Closed round their heads reluctant eddies sink,          And wider rings successive dash the brink.--          Three thousand steps in sparry clefts they stray,  120  Or seek through sullen mines their gloomy way;          On beds of Lava sleep in coral cells,          Or sigh o'er jasper fish, and agate shells.          Till, where famed ILAM leads his boiling floods          Through flowery meadows and impending woods,  125  Pleased with light spring they leave the dreary night,          And 'mid circumfluent surges rise to light;          Shake their bright locks, the widening vale pursue,          Their sea-green mantles fringed with pearly dew;          In playful groups by towering THORP they move,  130  Bound o'er the foaming wears, and rush into the Dove.            With fierce distracted eye IMPATIENS stands,          Swells her pale cheeks, and brandishes her hands,      [_Impatiens._ l. 131. Touch me not. The seed vessel consists of one  cell with five divisions; each of these, when the seed is ripe, on being  touched, suddenly folds itself into a spiral form, leaps from the stalk  and disperses the seeds to a great distance by it's elasticity. The  capsule of the geranium and the beard of wild oats are twisted for a  similar purpose, and dislodge their seeds on wet days, when the  ground is best fitted to receive them. Hence one of these, with its  adhering capsule or beard fixed on a stand, serves the purpose of  an hygrometer, twisting itself more or less according to the moisture  of the air.    The awn of barley is furnished with stiff points, which, like the teeth  of a saw, are all turned towards the point of it; as this long awn lies  upon the ground, it extends itself in the moist air of night, and pushes  forwards the barley corn, which it adheres to; in the day it shortens as  it dries; and as these points prevent it from receding, it draws up its  pointed end; and thus, creeping like a worm, will travel many feet from  the parent stem. That very ingenious Mechanic Philosopher, Mr. Edgeworth,  once made on this principle a wooden automaton; its back consisted of  soft Fir-wood, about an inch square, and four feet long, made of pieces  cut the cross-way in respect to the fibres of the wood, and glued  together: it had two feet before, and two behind,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10726"],[0,"Outlines of Lessons in Botany, Part I; from Seed to Leaf (#17)"],[1,"weight.  weight.

The substance we call protoplasm is  an albuminoid, like the white of an egg, and it forms the flesh of both  plants and animals. A living plant can assimilate its own protoplasm, an  animal must take it ready-made from plants. But a plant can assimilate its  food and grow only under the mysterious influence we call life. Life  alone brings forth life, and we are as far as ever from understanding  its nature. Around our little island of knowledge, built up through the  centuries by the labor of countless workers, stretches the infinite ocean  of the unknown.    _Gray's First Lessons_. Sect.
