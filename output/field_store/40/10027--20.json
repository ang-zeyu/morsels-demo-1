Broken and  helpless he admits his fault, while the Chorus sing in conclusion:--        \"By far the greatest part of happiness is wisdom; men should      reverence the gods; mighty plagues repay the mighty words of the      over-proud, teaching wisdom to the aged.\"    To Aeschylus the power that largely controlled men's acts was Destiny. A  notable contrast is visible in the system of Sophocles. Destiny does not  disappear, rather it retires into the background of his thought. To  him the leading cause of ruin is evil counsel. Over and over again  this teaching is driven home. All the leading characters mention  it, Antigone, Haemon, Teiresias, and when it is disregarded, it is  remorselessly brought home by disaster. The dramatic gain is enormous;  man's sorrows are ascribed primarily to his own lack of judgment, the  tragic character takes on a more human shape, for he is more nearly  related to the ordinary persons we meet in our own experience. Another  great advance is visible in the construction of the plot. It is more  varied, more flexible; it never ceases developing, the action continuing  to the end instead of stopping short at a climax. Further, the Chorus  begins to fall into a more humble position, it exercises but little  influence on the great figures of the plot, being content to mirror the  opinions of the interested outside spectator. Truly drama is beginning  to be master of itself--\"the play's the thing\".    But far more important is the subject of this play. It raises one of the  most difficult problems which demand a solution, the harmonisation  of private judgment with state authority. The individual in a growing  civilisation sooner or later asks how far he ought to obey, who is the  lord over his convictions, whether disobedience is ever justifiable. If  a law is wrong how are we to make its immorality evident? In an age when  a central authority is questioned or loses its hold on men's allegiance,  this problem will imperiously demand an answer. When Europe was aroused  from the slumber of the Middle Ages and the spiritual authority  which had governed it for centuries was shattered, the same right of  resistance as that which Antigone claimed was insisted upon by various  reformers. It did not fail to bring with it tragic consequences, for the  \"power beareth not the sword in vain\". Its sequel was the Thirty Years'  War which barbarised central Germany, leaving in many places a race of  savage beings who had once been human. In our own days resistance  is preached almost as a sacred duty. We have passive resisters,  conscientious objectors, strikers and a host of young and imperfectly  educated persons, some armed with the very serious power of voting, who  claim to set their wills in flat opposition to recognised authority. One  or two contributions to the solution of this problem may be found in  the _Antigone_. The central authority must be prepared to prove that its  edicts are not below the moral standard of the age; on the other hand,  non-compliance must be backed by the force of public opinion; it must  show that the action it takes will ultimately bring good to the whole  community. It is of little use to appeal to the so-called conscience  unless we can produce some credentials of the proper training and  enlightenment of that rather vague and uncertain faculty, whose normal  province is to condemn wrong acts, not to justify law-breaking. Most  resisters talk the very language of Antigone, appealing to the will of  Heaven; would that they could prove as satisfactorily as she did that  the power behind them is that which governs the world in righteousness.    A somewhat similar problem reappears in the _Ajax_. This play opens at  early dawn with a dialogue between Athena, who is unseen, and Odysseus;  the latter has traced Ajax to his tent after a night of madness in which  he has slain much cattle and many shepherds, imagining them to be his  foes, especially Odysseus himself who had worsted him in the contest for  the arms of Achilles. Athena calls out the beaten hero for a moment and  the sight of him moves Odysseus to say:--        \"I pity him, though my foe; for I think of mine own self as much as      of him. We men are but shadows, all of us, or fleeting shades.\"    To this Athena replies:--        \"When thou seest such sights, utter no haughty word against the gods      and be not roused to pride, if thou art mightier than another in      strength or store of wealth. One day can bring down or exalt all      human state, but the gods love the prudent and hate the sinners.\"    A band of mariners from Salamis enter as the chorus; they are Ajax'  followers who have come to learn the truth. They are confronted by  Tecmessa, Ajax' captive, who confirms the grievous rumour, describing  his mad acts. When the fit was over, she had left him in his tent  prostrate with grief and shame among the beasts he had slain, longing  for vengeance on his enemies before he died.    The business of the play now begins. Coming forth, Ajax in a long  despairing speech laments his lot--persecuted by Athena, hated of Greeks  and Trojans alike, the secret laughter of his enemies.    Where shall he go? Home to the father he has disgraced? Against Troy,  leading a forlorn hope? He had already reminded Tecmessa with some  sternness that silence is a woman's best grace; now she appeals to his  pity. Bereft of him, she would speedily be enslaved and mocked; their  son would be left defenceless; the many kindnesses she had done him cry  for some return from a man of chivalrous nature, Ajax bade her be of  good cheer; she must obey him in all things and first must bring his son  Eurysaces. Taking him in his arms, he says:--        \"If he is my true son, he will not quail at the sight of blood.      But he must speedily be broken into his father's warrior habit      and imitate his ways. My son, I pray thou mayest be happier than      thy sire, but like him otherwise, then thou shalt be no churl.      Yet herein I envy thee that thou canst not feel my agonies. Life      is sweetest in its careless years before it learns joy and pain;      but when thou art come to that, show thy father's enemies thy      nature and birth. Till then feed on the spirit of gladness,      gambol in the life of boyhood and gladden thy mother's heart.\"    He reflects that his son will be safe as long as Teucer lives, whom he  charges on his return to take the boy to his own father and mother to be  their joy. His arms shall not be a prize to be striven for; they should  be buried with him except his shield, which his son should take and  keep. This ominous speech dashes the hopes which he had raised in  Tecmessa's heart, even the Chorus sadly admitting that death is the best  for a brainsick man, born of the highest blood, no longer true to his  character.    Ajax re-enters, a sword in his hands. He feels his heart touched by  Tecmessa's words and pities her helplessness. He resolves to go to the  shore and there bury the accursed sword he had of Hector, which had  robbed him of his peace. He will soon learn obedience to the gods and  his leaders; all the powers of Nature are subject to authority, the  seasons, the sea, night and sleep. He has but now learned that an enemy  is to be hated as one who will love us later, while friendship will not  always abide. Yet all will be well; he will go the journey he cannot  avoid; soon all will hear that his evil destiny has brought him  salvation. This splendid piece of tragic irony is interpreted at its  surface value by the Chorus, who burst into a song of jubilation. But  the words have a darker meaning; this transient joy is but the last  flicker of hope before it is quenched in everlasting night.    A messenger brings the news that Teucer, Ajax' brother, on his return  to the camp from a raid was nearly stoned to death as the kinsman of the  army's foe. He inquires where Ajax is; hearing that he had gone out to  make atonement, he knows the terror that is to come. Chalcas the seer  adjured Teucer to use all means in his power to keep Ajax in his tent  that day, for in it alone Athena's wrath would persecute him. She had  punished him with madness for two proud utterances. On leaving his  father he had boasted he would win glory in spite of Heaven, and later  had bidden Athena assist the other Greeks, for the line would never  break where he stood. Such was his pride, and such its punishment.  Tecmessa hurries in and sends some to fetch Teucer, others to go east  and west to seek out her lord. The scene rapidly changes to the shore,  where Ajax cries to the gods, imprecates his foes, prays to Death, and  after a remembrance of his native land falls on his sword.    The Chorus enter in two bands, but find nothing. Tecmessa discovers the  body in a brake, and hides it under her robe. Distracted and haunted by  the dread of slavery and ridicule, she gives way to grief. Teucer enters  to learn of the tragedy; after dispatching Tecmessa to save the child  while there is yet time, he reflects on his own state. Telamon his  father will cast him off for being absent in his brother's hour of  weakness whom he loved as his own life. Sadly he bears out the truth of  Ajax utterance, that a foe's gifts are fraught with ruin; the belt that  Ajax gave Hector served to tie his feet to Achilles' car--and Hector's  sword was in his brother's heart.    The plot now appeals to fiercer passions. Menelaus entering commands  Teucer to leave the corpse where it is, for an enemy shall receive no  burial. He strikes the same note as Creon:--        \"It is the mark of an ill-conditioned man that he, a commoner,      should see fit to disobey the powers that be. Law cannot prosper      in a city where there is no settled fear; where a man trembles and      is loyal, there is salvation; when he is insolent and does as he      will, his city soon or late"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8129"],[0,"A Dreamer's Tales (#16)"],[1,"k, their arms hung evenly all round the hall, low  where a man could reach them; and in the place of honour in the midst,  between the arms of Camorak and of Gadriol the Leal, hung the harp of  Arleon. And of all the weapons hanging on those walls none were more  calamitous to Camorak's foes than was the harp of Arleon. For to a man  that goes up against a strong place on foot, pleasant indeed is the twang  and jolt of some fearful engine of war that his fellow-warriors are  working behind him, from which huge rocks go sighing over his head and  plunge among his foes; and pleasant to a warrior in the wavering light are  the swift commands of his King, and a joy to him are his comrades' instant  cheers exulting suddenly at a turn of the war. All this and more was the  harp to Camorak's men; for not only would it cheer his warriors on, but  many a time would Arleon of the Harp strike wild amazement into opposing  hosts by some rapturous prophecy suddenly shouted out while his hand swept  over the roaring strings. Moreover, no war was ever declared till Camorak  and his men had listened long to the harp, and were elate with the music  and mad against peace. Once Arleon, for the sake of a rhyme, had made war  upon Estabonn; and an evil king was overthrown, and honour and glory won;  from such queer motives does good sometimes accrue.    Above the shields and the harps all round the hall were the painted  figures of heroes of fabulous famous songs. Too trivial, because too  easily surpassed by Camorak's men, seemed all the victories that the earth  had known; neither was any trophy displayed of Camorak's seventy battles,  for these were as nothing to his warriors or him compared with those  things that their youth had dreamed and which they mightily purposed yet  to do.    Above the painted pictures there was darkness, for evening was closing in,  and the candles swinging on their slender chain were not yet lit in the  roof; it was as though a piece of the night had been builded into the  edifice like a huge natural rock that juts into a house. And there sat all  the warriors of Arn and the Weald-folk wondering at them; and none were  more than thirty, and all were skilled in war. And Camorak sat at the head  of all, exulting in his youth.    We must wrestle with Time for some seven decades, and he is a weak and  puny antagonist in the first three bouts.    Now there was present at this feast a diviner, one who knew the schemes of  Fate, and he sat among the people of the Weald and had no place of honour,  for Camorak and his men had no fear of Fate. And when the meat was eaten  and the bones cast aside, the king rose up from his chair, and having  drunken wine, and being in the glory of his youth and with all his knights  about him, called to the diviner, saying, \"Prophesy.\"    And the diviner rose up, stroking his grey beard, and spake  guardedly--\"There are certain events,\" he said, \"upon the ways of Fate  that are veiled even from a diviner's eyes, and many more are clear to us  that were better veiled from all; much I know that is better unforetold,  and some things that I may not foretell on pain of centuries of  punishment. But this I know and foretell--that you will never come to  Carcassonne.\"    Instantly there was a buzz of talk telling of Carcassonne--some had heard  of it in speech or song, some had read of it, and some had dreamed of it.  And the king sent Arleon of the Harp down from his right hand to mingle  with the Weald-folk to hear aught that any told of Carcassonne. But the  warriors told of the places they had won to--many a hard-held fortress,  many a far-off land, and swore that they would come to Carcassonne.    And in a while came Arleon back to the king's right hand, and raised his  harp and chanted and told of Carcassonne. Far away it was, and far and far  away, a city of gleaming ramparts rising one over other, and marble  terraces behind the ramparts, and fountains shimmering on the terraces. To  Carcassonne the elf-kings with their fairies had first retreated from men,  and had built it on an evening late in May by blowing their elfin horns.  Carcassonne! Carcassonne!    Travellers had seen it sometimes like a clear dream, with the sun  glittering on its citadel upon a far-off hilltop, and then the clouds had  come or a sudden mist; no one had seen it long or come quite close to it;  though once there were some men that came very near, and the smoke from  the houses blew into their faces, a sudden gust--no more, and these  declared that some one was burning cedarwood there. Men had dreamed that  there is a witch there, walking alone through the cold courts and  corridors of marmorean palaces, fearfully beautiful and still for all her  fourscore centuries, singing the second oldest song, which was taught her  by the sea, shedding tears for loneliness from eyes that would madden  armies, yet will she not call her dragons home--Carcassonne is terribly  guarded. Sometimes she swims in a marble bath through whose deeps a river  tumbles, or lies all morning on the edge of it to dry slowly in the sun,  and watches the heaving river trouble the deeps of the bath. It flows  through the caverns of earth for further than she knows, and coming to  light in the witch's bath goes down through the earth again to its own  peculiar sea.    In autumn sometimes it comes down black with snow that spring has molten  in unimagined mountains, or withered blooms of mountain shrubs go  beautifully by.    When there is blood in the bath she knows there is war in the mountains;  and yet she knows not where those mountains are.    When she sings the fountains dance up from the dark earth, when she combs  her hair they say there are storms at sea, when she is angry the wolves  grow brave and all come down to the byres, when she is sad the sea is sad,  and both are sad for ever. Carcassonne! Carcassonne!    This city is the fairest of the wonders of Morning; the sun shouts when he  beholdeth it; for Carcassonne Evening weepeth when Evening passeth away.    And Arleon told how many goodly perils were round about the city, and how  the way was unknown, and it was a knightly venture. Then all the warriors  stood up and sang of the splendour of the venture. And Camorak swore by  the gods that had builded Arn, and by the honour of his warriors that,  alive or dead, he would come to Carcassonne.    But the diviner rose and passed out of the hall, brushing the crumbs from  him with his hands and smoothing his robe as he went.    Then Camorak said, \"There are many things to be planned, and counsels to  be taken, and provender to be gathered. Upon what day shall we start?\" And  all the warriors answering shouted, \"Now.\" And Camorak smiled thereat, for  he had but tried them. Down then from the walls they took their weapons,  Sikorix, Kelleron, Aslof, Wole of the Axe; Huhenoth, Peace-breaker;  Wolwuf, Father of War; Tarion, Lurth of the Warcry and many another.  Little then dreamed the spiders that sat in that ringing hall of the  unmolested leisure they were soon to enjoy.    When they were armed they all formed up and marched out of the hall, and  Arleon strode before them singing of Carcassonne.    But the talk of the Weald arose and went back well fed to byres. They had  no need of wars or of rare perils. They were ever at war with hunger. A  long drought or hard winter were to them pitched battles; if the wolves  entered a sheep-fold it was like the loss of a fortress, a thunder-storm  on the harvest was like an ambuscade. Well-fed, they went back slowly to  their byres, being at truce with hunger; and the night filled with stars.    And black against the starry sky appeared the round helms of the warriors  as they passed the tops of the ridges, but in the valleys they sparkled  now and then as the starlight flashed on steel.    They followed behind Arleon going south, whence rumours had always come of  Carcassonne: so they marched in the starlight, and he before them singing.    When they had marched so far that they heard no sound from Arn, and even  inaudible were her swinging bells, when candles burning late far up in  towers no longer sent them their disconsolate welcome; in the midst of the  pleasant night that lulls the rural spaces, weariness came upon Arleon and  his inspiration failed. It failed slowly. Gradually he grew less sure of  the way to Carcassonne. Awhile he stopped to think, and remembered the way  again; but his clear certainty was gone, and in its place were efforts in  his mind to recall old prophecies and shepherd's songs that told of the  marvelous city. Then as he said over carefully to himself a song that a  wanderer had learnt from a goatherd's boy far up the lower slope of  ultimate southern mountains, fatigue came down upon his toiling mind like  snow on the winding ways of a city noisy by night, stilling all.    He stood, and the warriors closed up to him. For long they had passed by  great oaks standing solitary here and there, like giants taking huge  breaths of the night air before doing some furious deed; now they had come  to the verge of a black forest; the tree-trunks stood like those great  columns in an Egyptian hall whence God in an older mood received the  praise of men; the top of it sloped the way of an ancient wind. Here they  all halted and lighted a fire of branches, striking sparks from flint into  a heap of bracken. They eased them of their armour, and sat round the  fire, and Camorak stood up there and addressed them, and Camorak said: \"We  go to war with Fate, who has doomed that I shall not come to Carcassonne.  And if we turn aside but one of the dooms of Fate, then the whole future  of the world is ours, and the future that Fate has ordered is like the dry  course of an averted river. But if such men as we, such resolute  conquerors, cannot prevent one doom that Fate has planned, then is the  race of man enslaved for ever to do its petty and allotted task.\""]]]
