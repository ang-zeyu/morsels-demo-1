Especially striking to the eye was a magnificent group of gold fishes. The  huge bull-cat fish and the gigantic turtle were conspicuous by their  monstrousness. We removed to the eastern extremity of the Fisheries  Building, forming a spacious circular pavilion. In the rotunda a basin,  twenty-six feet wide, presented a beautiful scenic effect. Over rocks  picturesquely arranged, the silver meshes of a brook wound their way,  forming here and there white gushes of waterfall which contrasted  agreeably with the moss covered stones, and the semi-aquatic plants. The  latter adorned the pool below, in which golden-hued fishes moved lightly  to and fro. The inspection of the angling pavilion at the extreme western  side of the Fisheries Building completed our visit in this fine structure,  whose exhibits demonstrated largely the fishery wealth of the United  States.    Taking advantage of the extraordinary calmness of the atmosphere, our  mindful commodore resolved to moor the yacht in vicinity of the Exposition  Grounds. For, he wished to give us opportunity to witness the display of  pyrotechnics announced for the latter part of the evening, in  solemnization of the Illinois Day. Therefore, the \"Marguerite\" conveyed us  to a place which proved exceedingly favorable for our design. Here, our  floating home was anchored. Enjoying a full vista of the White City, we  found a prolific source of admiration in the grand electric spectacles.  The illumination of the _Columbia fountain_ in front of the Administration  Building, and the display of two electric fountains in the western  extremity of the South Pond, were magical in effectiveness. Wonderful  flash-lights blazed from the tops of the tallest towers, surmounting the  larger structures. Whenever the operator threw the search-light  investigably over the yacht, we shut our eyes spontaneously at its  dazzling brilliancy.    As the gathering shadows of night wrapped land and water in darkness, the  hour arrived in which the visitors on the Fair Grounds--who seemed to be  almost as numerous as the sands on the shore--expected to view the scenic  effects produced by means of fire.    We sat on the deck of the yacht as comfortably as in our _boudoirs_ at  home. Nevertheless, we were able to enjoy _ad libitum_ the same sight that  so many others in the White City could only see with difficulty, on  account of the unusual throngs. When we reflected on this circumstance--so  much in our favor--our hearts were filled with gratitude toward our  commodore, who had selected this excellent locality. From here we admired  the exceedingly fine pyrotechnic displays. Girandoles pierced the sky in  all directions, with rushing lines of fire. Sky-rockets exhibiting rich  hues of purple, red, and green ascended through the air; and when reaching  the highest point of their blazing paths, they discharged beautiful  garnitures of floating stars, sparks, crackers, serpents, gold and silver  rain. Tourbillions mounting and rotating through the atmosphere, formed  brilliant spiral curves of fire. Splendid effects of changing color were  brought to view by revolving fire-wheels. An appropriate _finale_  constituted the burning of the American flag, which bore a sublime  character in the brightness of fire.       \"Flag of the free heart's hope and home,        By angel hands to valor given:      Thy stars have lit the welkin dome,        And all thy hues were born in heaven\"    As the first faint smile of the morning peeped over the eastern wave, I  rose--greatly refreshed by a sound sleep. Coming on deck, I found that  the sun's unclouded orb already poured its rays of light upon the earth.    Our eyes rested with delight on the White City throned on its numerous  isles, looking like a sea Cybele--ascending from the lake with her tiara  of proud towers.    At our arrival on the Fair Grounds, Mr. James thoughtfully provided us  with guides and rolling-chairs--vehicles which reminded us of the Japanese  Jin-riki-sha.    The main entrance of the AGRICULTURAL BUILDING--adorned on either side by  mammoth Corinthian pillars--ushered us into a vestibule, richly ornamented  with appropriate statuary. From here, we reached a rotunda surmounted by a  gigantic glass dome. When looking about on the main floor, we fancied  ourselves to be in a city of pavilions. For, the States of the Union as  well as the foreign nations had environed their displays with magnificent  little temples and pagodas. To a great extent, they formed exhibits  themselves, because in most cases the chief products of the respective  country had been utilized for their construction. Nebraska, for example,  had employed sweet corn for the erection of its pavilion.    Every state and territory was represented by its productions; the Northern  States with Indian corn, wheat, oats, barley, rye, and other cereals; the  South with cotton, rice, sugar, etc. Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky,  and Tennessee evinced their noted superiority in the culture of the  nicotian plant, which is in such great favor with the consumers of  tobacco.    Agricultural and other food displays were shown in great varieties by the  foreign countries. In the German section the gigantic Chocolate Tower  (built of several hundred tons of chocolate by the famous firm \"Gebrueder  Stollwerck\" in Cologne) compelled admiration. The Liebig exhibit of canned  and preserved meat was a prominent feature of this division. Great Britain  showed specimens of grain from the English experimental grounds,  representing the effects of artificial fertilization on the various seeds.  The contributions made by Canada embraced grain, seeds, and roots; and its  eleven ton cheese constituted one of the unique exhibits in this edifice.  As in all great departmental structures, Japan was well represented. It  had a fine display of its chief exports--tea, rice, and raw silk. Russia's  showing covered a space of 32,000 feet. New South Wales, France, Mexico,  Austria, Denmark, Sweden, and numerous other foreign countries  demonstrated, likewise, the variety and wealth of their natural resources.    Besides the farm products of the world in all their diversity and  perfection, agricultural machinery was exhibited: Devices of every  description from the most primitive implements to the highly improved  machines as they are in use at the present day. The ingenious arrangement  of this display enabled the visitor to perceive at a glance the enormous  progress made in that branch of industry. Thus, we viewed in the annex of  the main floor one of the most perfected plows--the \"Queen\"--a trophy of  modern inventiveness. And beside it stood an implement, which reminded us  by its simplicity and unwieldiness of an apparatus, described in mythology  as used by _Ceres dea agriculturae_--when teaching to mankind this  important occupation.    The south-western portion of the first floor was covered with instructive  contributions of American agricultural colleges and experiment stations.  They embraced the entire field of scientific research in all branches of  husbandry; illustrating the most improved methods of cultivation, and  explaining how the best results may be secured.    The great galleries contained a fine wool exhibit, an interesting apiary  display, dairy implements, and a vast collection of manufactured food  products.    The multitudinous objects brought to view in this building, proved beyond  doubt, that the standard of excellence in that ancient occupation has been  achieved mainly with the assistance of scientific researches.    A colonnade formed the connecting link between the Palace of Agriculture  and the Machinery Hall. In its center, from an archway--leading to the  _live-stock exhibit_--we enjoyed a fine view down the lagoon--extending  nearly a mile in length.    As adjuncts to the agricultural department, may be regarded the displays  in the _Dairy_ and _Forestry Buildings_.    On entering the PALACE OF MECHANICAL ARTS, three elevated traveling cranes  running from end to end of the structure, attracted our attention. They  had been utilized in the work of construction, as well as in moving the  machines presented to view. The platforms erected upon them, gave us  occasion to look upon the entire machinery exhibition. The driving power  used in the main building and annex was steam; excepting two small  sections driven by electric motors. Adjoining the south side of the  edifice extended the enormous power plant. It supplied the Machinery Hall  with a total steam power of about 3,000 horses generated by twelve  engines. The entire plant, comprising over sixty steam-engines, and  operating 127 dynamos, represented a most stupendous display of mechanical  energy hitherto unequaled. Its total capacity was equivalent to 20,000  H.P.    The domestic exhibits located in the western portion of the main  building--but mostly in the annex, revealed the marvelous progress made  during the last decades in this wonderfully prospering country. Shown by  great firms from almost every state and territory were devices of various  forms: Motors and apparatuses for the generation and transmission of  power--fire-engines and other appliances for extinguishing a  conflagration--machine tools and devices for working metals--machinery for  the manufacture of textile fabrics and clothing, for cutting wood, for  typesetting, printing, embossing, book making and paper working,  lithography, and photo-mechanical process, for working-stone, clay, and  other minerals. In short, there were machines of every description  employed in all industrial pursuits imaginable; yea, even appliances for  facilitating the housekeepers' daily duties as laundry- and dish-washing  machines.    In fact, it must require a considerable effort to excogitate novel  labor-saving devices.

The act of spitting, however, was intended sometimes to carry  a curse with it, and sometimes a blessing, for a man spat in the face  of his enemy in order to lay the curse of impurity upon him, and at the  present time, men spit upon money to keep the devils away from it.    [FN#67]  The gods were, according to one belief, nothing more than the  various names of Ra, who had taken the forms of the various members of  his body.    [FN#68]  Thus the god's own name became his most important talisman.    [FN#69]  The position of Isis as the \"great enchantress\" is well  defined, and several instances of her magical powers are recorded.  By  the utterance of her words of power she succeeded in raising her dead  husband Osiris to life, and she enabled him by their means to beget  Horus of her.  Nothing could withstand them, because they were of  divine origin, and she had learned them from Thoth, the intelligence of  the greatest of the gods.    [FN#70]  Or, \"the period of the summer.\"  The season Shemmu, began soon  after the beginning of April and lasted until nearly the end of July.    [FN#71]  Khepera, Rd, and Temu were the three principal forms of the  Sun-god according to the theological system of the priests of  Heliopolis.    [FN#72]  The name by which the Boat of Ra is generally known in  Egyptian texts.  It was this boat which was stopped in its course when  Thoth descended from the sky to impart to Isis the words of power that  were to raise her dead child Horus to life.    [FN#73]  i.e., the fluid of life of the sun, and the fluid of life of  the moon. The sun and the moon were the visible, material symbols of  the Sun god.    [FN#74]  The attributes of this god are not well defined.  He was a god  of the Eastern Delta, and was associated with the cities where Temu was  worshipped.            THE LEGEND OF HORUS OF BEHUTET AND THE WINGED DISK.        XII.  In the three hundred and sixty-third year of Ra-Heru-Khuti, who  liveth for ever and forever, His Majesty was in Ta-Kens,[FN#75] and his  soldiers were with him; [the enemy] did not conspire (auu) against  their lord, and the land [is called] Uauatet unto this day.  And Ra set  out on an expedition in his boat, and his followers were with him, and  he arrived at Uthes-Heru,[FN#76] [which lay to] the west of this nome,  and to the east of the canal Pakhennu, which is called [ . . . . . . .  to this day].  And Heru-Behutet was in the boat of Ra, and he said  unto his father Ra-Heru-Khuti (i.e., Ra-Harmachis), \"I see that the  enemies are conspiring against their lord; let thy fiery serpent gain  the mastery . . . . . over them.\"        [FN#75]  i.e., in Nubia, probably the portion of it which lies round  about the modern Kalabsha.  In ancient days Ta-kens appears to have  included a portion of the Nile Valley to the north of Aswan.        XIII.  Then the Majesty of Ra Harmachis said unto thy divine KA, \"O  Heru-Behutet, O son of Ra, thou exalted one, who didst proceed from me,  overthrow thou the enemies who are before thee straightway.\"  And Heru-  Behutet flew up into the horizon in the form of the great Winged Disk,  for which reason he is called \"Great god, lord of heaven,\" unto this  day.  And when he saw the enemies in the heights of heaven he set out  to follow after them in the form of the great Winged Disk, and he  attacked with such terrific force those who opposed him, that they  could neither see with their eyes nor hear with their ears, and each of  them slew his fellow.  In a moment of time there was not a single  creature left alive.  Then Heru Behutet, shining with very many  colours, came in the form of the great Winged Disk to the Boat of Ra-  Harmachis, and Thoth said unto Ra, \"O Lord of the gods, Behutet hath  returned in the form of the great Winged Disk, shining [with many  colours] . . . . . . children;\" for this reason he is called Heru-  Behutet unto this day.  And Thoth said, \"The city Teb shall be called  the city of Heru-Behutet,\" and thus is it called unto this day.  And Ra  embraced the . . . . . of Ra, and said unto Heru-Behutet, \"Thou didst  put grapes[FN#77] into the water which cometh forth from it,[FN#78] and  thy heart rejoiced thereat;\" and for this reason the water (or, canal)  of Heru-Behutet is called \"[Grape-Water]\" unto this day, and the . . .  . . . . . . . . unto this day.  And Heru-Behutet said, \"Advance, O Ra,  and look thou upon thine enemies who are lying under thee on this  land;\" thereupon the Majesty of Ra set out on the way, and the goddess  Asthertet ('Ashtoreth?) was with him, and he saw the enemies overthrown  on the ground, each one of them being fettered.  Then said Ra to Heru-  Behutet, \"There is sweet life in this place,\" and for this reason the  abode of the palace of Heru-Behutet is called \"Sweet Life\" unto this  day.  And Ra, said unto Thoth, \"[Here was the slaughter] of mine  enemies; \"and the place is called Teb[FN#79] unto this day.  And Thoth  said unto Heru-Behutet, \"Thou art a great protector (makaa);\" and the  Boat of Heru-Behutet is called Makaa[FN#80] unto this day.  Then said  Ra unto the gods who were in his following, \"Behold now, let us sail in  our boat upon the water, for our hearts are glad because our enemies  have been overthrown on the earth;\" and the water where the great god  sailed is called P-Khen-Ur[FN#81] unto this day.  And behold the  enemies [of Ra] rushed into the water, and they took the forms of  [crocodiles and] hippopotami, but nevertheless Ra-Heru-Khuti sailed  over the waters in his boat, and when the crocodiles and the  hippopotami had come nigh unto him, they opened wide their jaws in  order to destroy Ra-Heru-Khuti.  And when Heru-Behutet arrived and his  followers who were behind him in the forms of workers in metal, each  having in his hands an iron spear and a chain, according to his name,  they smote the crocodiles and the hippopotami; and there were brought  in there straightway six hundred and fifty-one crocodiles, which had  been slain before the city of Edfu.  Then spake Ra-Harmachis unto Heru-  Behutet, \"My Image shall be [here] in the land of the South, (which is  a house of victory (or, strength); \"and the House of Heru-Behutet is  called Nekht-Het unto this day.        [FN#76]  i.e., Apollinopolis, the modern Edfu.    [FN#77]  i.e. drops of blood.    [FN#78]  i.e., from the city.    [FN#79]  i.e., Edfu.    [FN#80]  i.e., Great Protector.    [FN#81]  i.e., \"Great Canal.\"        XIV.  Then the god Thoth spake, after he had looked upon the enemies  lying upon the ground, saying, \"Let your hearts rejoice, O ye gods of  heaven!  Let your hearts rejoice, O ye gods who are in the earth!  Horus, the Youthful One, cometh in peace, and he hath made manifest on  his journey deeds of very great might, which he hath performed  according to 'the Book of Slaying the Hippopotamus.'\"  And from that day  figures of Heru-Behutet in metal have existed.    Then Heru-Behutet took upon himself the form of the Winged Disk, and he  placed himself upon the front of the Boat of Ea.  And he placed by his  side the goddess Nekhebet[FN#82] and the goddess Uatchet,[FN#83] in the  form of two serpents, that they might make the enemies to quake in  [all] their limbs when they were in the forms of crocodiles and  hippopotami in every place wherein be came in the Land of the South and  in the Land of the North.  Then those enemies rose up to make their  escape from before him, and their face was towards the Land of the  South.  And their hearts were stricken down through fear of him.  And  Heru-Behutet was at the back (or, side) of them in the Boat of Ra, and  there were in his hands a metal lance and a metal chain; and the metal  workers who were with their lord were equipped for fighting with lances  and chains.  And Heru-Behutet saw them[FN#84] to the south-east of the  city of Uast (Thebes) some distance away.  Then Ra said to Thoth,  \"Those enemies shall be smitten with blows that kill;\" and Thoth said  to Ra, \"[That place] is called the city Tchet-Met unto this day.\"  And  Heru-Behutet made a great overthrow among them, and Ra said, \"Stand  still, O Heru-Behutet,\" and [that place] is called \"Het-Ra\" to this  day, and the god who dwelleth therein is Heru-Behutet-Ra-Amsu (or,  Min).  Then those enemies rose up to make their escape from before him,  and the face of the god was towards the Land of the North, and their  hearts were stricken through fear of him.  And Heru-Behutet was at the  back (or, side) of them in the Boat of Ra, and those who were following  him had spears of metal and chains of metal in their hands; and the god  himself was equipped for battle with the weapons of the metal workers  which they had with them.  And he passed a whole day before he saw them  to the north-east of the nome of Tentyra (Dendera).  Then Ra said unto  Thoth, \"The enemies are resting . . . . . . . their lord.\"  And the  Majesty of Ra-Harmachis said to Heru-Behutet, \"Thou art my exalted son  who didst proceed from Nut.  The courage of the (enemies hath failed in  a moment.\"  And Heru-Behutet made great slaughter among them.  And  Thoth said \"The Winged Disk shall be called. . . . . in the name of  this Aat;\" and is called Heru-Behutet . . . . . its mistress.  His name  is to the South in the name of this god, and the acacia and the  sycamore shall be the trees of the sanctuary.  Then the enemies turned  aside to flee from before him, and their faces were [towards the North,  and they went] to the swamps of Uatch-ur (i.e., the Mediterranean), and  [their courage failed through fear of him].  And Heru-Behutet was at  the back (or, side) of them in the Boat of Ra, and the metal spear was  in his hands, and those who were in his following were equipped with  the weapons for battle of the metal workers.  And the god spent four  days and four nights in the water in pursuit of them, but he did not  see one of the enemies, who fled from before"]]]
