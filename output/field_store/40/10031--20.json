Youngest brother puts  his ant into the ear of the ass, which, when bit, begins to bawl out  horribly. Asking to see their legs, tiger is shown the trunk of the  palmyra-tree, and, on asking to see their bellies, is shown the iron  tub. Frightened, he runs away, and the sister is rescued.

Here Motherwit,  as in the other stories, deceives a Raghoshi by means of a thick rope  (shown for hair), spades (shown for finger-nails), and wet lime  (shown for spittle). At last with sharp-pointed hot iron rods,  Ulysses fashion, he puts out the monster's eyes.    In another Bengal story, \"The Ghost who was afraid of being Bagged\"  (Lal Behari Day, No. xx), a barber frightens a ghost with a  looking-glass and becomes rich.    An interesting parallel to the incident of the death of the blind  brothers by climbing up too high on palm-trees the tops of which have  been broken off, is to be found in the Arabian story of \"The Blind  Thief\" (JRASB 3 : 645-660, No. iii). A thief who used to steal dates  from off the trees became blind, but he still went on thieving. The  people planned to get rid of him. In the presence of the blind man,  some one praised the dates of So-and-so. (Now, this tree was withered,  and no longer had any leaves.) The covetous thief, with his rope,  started to climb the tree that night; but his rope slipped off over  the naked top of the palm, and he fell to the ground and was killed.    The situation of a blind man and a lame man joining forces and  travelling together, the blind man carrying the lame man, who directs  the way, is found in the Gesta Romanorum, tale LXXI.    Certain of the false proofs in the Filipino stories have no parallel  in the Indian tales; viz., duck for louse, gun or horn for voice,  tail of sting-ray (pagui) for hair. The suggestion for this last  comparison may have come from the belief among the Filipinos that the  tail of the sting-ray is a very efficacious charm against demons and  witches. It is a \"specific\" against the mangkukulam. [30] On the other  hand, there are certain details of the Indian versions lacking in the  Filipino,--the donkey, the palmyra-tree, the wash-tub. Nevertheless  the close agreement, not only of motifs, but of motifs in the same  sequence, makes it certain beyond all reasonable doubt that the story  as we find it in the Islands (most fully represented by the Bicol  \"Juan the Blind Man\") goes back directly to southern India, possibly  to the parent story of Miss Frere's old Deccan narrative.        TALE 7    SAGACIOUS MARCELA.      Narrated by Lorenzo Licup, a Pampangan.      Long, long before the Spaniards came, there lived a man who had a  beautiful, virtuous, and, above all, clever daughter. He was a servant  of the king. Marcela, the daughter, loved her father devotedly, and  always helped him with his work. From childhood she had manifested a  keen wit and undaunted spirit. She would even refuse to obey unjust  orders from the king. No question was too hard for her to answer,  and the king was constantly being surprised at her sagacity.    One day the king conceived a plan by which he might test the ingenious  Marcela. He bade his servants procure a tiny bird and carry it to her  house. \"Tell her,\" said the king, \"to make twelve dishes out of that  one bird.\"    The servants found Marcela sewing. They told her of the order of the  king. After thinking for five minutes, she took one of her pins, and  said to the servants, \"If the king can make twelve spoons out of this  pin, I can also make twelve dishes out of that bird.\" On receiving  the answer, the king realized that the wise Marcela had gotten the  better of him; and he began to think of another plan to puzzle her.    Again he bade his servants carry a sheep to Marcela's house. \"Tell  her,\" he said, \"to sell the sheep for six reales, and with the money  this very same sheep must come back to me alive.\"    At first Marcela could not make out what the king meant for her to  do. Then she thought of selling the wool only, and not the whole  sheep. So she cut off the wool and sold it for six reales, and sent  the money with the live sheep back to the king. Thus she was again  relieved from a difficulty.    The king by this time realized that he could not beat Marcela in  points of subtlety. However, to amuse himself, he finally thought of  one more scheme to test her sagacity. It took him two weeks to think  it out. Summoning a messenger, he said to him, \"Go to Marcela, and  tell her that I am not well, and that my physician has advised me to  drink a cup of bull's milk. Therefore she must get me this medicine,  or her father will lose his place in the palace.\" The king also issued  an order that no one was to bathe or to wash anything in the river,  for he was going to take a bath the next morning.    As soon as Marcela had received the command of the king and had  heard of his second order, she said, \"How easy it will be for me to  answer this silly order of the king!\" That night she and her father  killed a pig, and smeared its blood over the sleeping-mat, blanket,  and pillows. When morning came, Marcela took the stained bed-clothing  to the source of the river, where the king was bathing. As soon as  the king caught sight of her, he said in a voice of thunder, \"Why do  you wash your stuff in the river when you know I ordered that nobody  should use the river to-day but me?\"    Marcela replied, \"It is the custom, my lord, in our country, to wash  the mat, pillows, and other things stained with blood, immediately  after a person has given birth to a child. As my father gave birth to  a child last night, custom forces me to disobey your order, although  I do it much against my will.\"    \"Nonsense!\" said the king. \"The idea of a man giving birth to a  child! Absurd! Ridiculous!\"    \"My lord,\" said Marcela, \"it would be just as absurd to think of  getting milk from a bull.\"    Then the king, recollecting his order, said, \"Marcela, as you are so  witty, clever, and virtuous, I will give you my son for your husband.\"      King Tasio.    Narrated by Leopoldo Faustino, a Tagalog, who says that the story is  popular and common among the people of La Laguna province.    Juan was a servant in the palace of King Tasio. One day King Tasio  heard Juan discussing with the other servants in the kitchen the  management of the kingdom. Juan said that he knew more than anybody  else in the palace. The king called Juan, and told him to go down to  the seashore and catch the rolling waves.    \"You said that you are the wisest man in the palace,\" said the  king. \"Go and catch the waves of the sea for me.\"    \"That's very easy, O king!\" said Juan, \"if you will only provide me  with a rope made of sand taken from the seashore.\"    The king did not know what to answer. He left Juan without saying  anything, went into his room, and began to think of some more  difficult work.    The next day he called Juan. \"Juan, take this small bird and make  fifty kinds of food out of it,\" said the king.    \"Yes, sir!\" said Juan, \"if you will only provide me with a stove,  a pan, and a knife made out of this needle,\" handing a needle to the  king, \"with which to cook the bird.\" Again the king did not know what  to do. He was very angry at Juan.    \"Juan, get out of my palace! Don't you let me see you walking on my  ground around this palace without my consent!\" said the king.    \"Very well, sir!\" said Juan, and he left the palace immediately.    The next day King Tasio saw Juan in front of the palace, riding on  his paragos [31] drawn by a carabao.    \"Did I not tell you not to stand or walk on my ground around this  palace? Why are you here now? Do you mean to mock me?\" shouted  the king.    \"Well,\" said Juan, \"will your Majesty's eyes please see whether I am  standing on your ground or not? This is my ground.\" And he pointed  to the earth he had on his paragos. \"I took this from my orchard.\"    \"That's enough, Juan,\" said King Tasio. \"I can have no more  foolishness.\" The king felt very uncomfortable, because many of his  courtiers and servants were standing there listening to his talk  with Juan.    \"Juan, put this squash into this jar. Be careful! See that you do  not break either the squash or the jar,\" said the king, as he handed  a squash and a jar to Juan. Now, the neck of the jar was small, and  the squash was as big as the jar. So Juan had indeed a difficult task.    Juan went home. He put a very small squash, which he had growing  in his garden, inside the jar. He did not, however, cut it from the  vine. After a few weeks the squash had grown big enough to fill the  jar. Juan then picked off the squash enclosed in the jar, and went  to the king. He presented the jar to the king when all the servants,  courtiers, and visitors from other towns were present. As soon as  the king saw the jar with the squash in it, he fainted. It was many  hours before he recovered.      Notes.    A third version (c), a Bicol story entitled \"Marcela outwits the  King,\" narrated by Gregorio Frondoso of Camarines, resembles closely  the Pampango story of Marcela, with these minor differences:--    The heroine is the daughter of the king's adviser Bernardo. To test  the girl's wit, the king sends her a mosquito he has killed, and tells  her to cook it in such a way that it will serve twelve persons. She  sends back a pin to him, with word that if he can make twelve forks  from the pin, the mosquito will serve twelve persons. The second and  third tasks are identical with those in the Pampango version. At last,  satisfied with her sagacity, the king makes her his chief counsellor.    In addition to the three popular tales of the \"Clever Lass\" cycle,  two chap-book versions of the story, containing incidents lacking in  the folk-tales, may be mentioned here:--        A Buhay nang isang"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/830"],[0,"The Argonautica (#16)"],[1,"ses, and the people who dwell  beneath hear the din above the roof and sit quietly, since the stormy  season has not come upon them unawares, but they have first made strong  their roofs; so the birds sent against the heroes a thick shower of  feather-shafts as they darted over the sea to the mountains of the land  opposite.    (ll. 1090-1092) What then was the purpose of Phineus in bidding the  divine band of heroes land there? Or what kind of help was about to meet  their desire?    (ll. 1093-1122) The sons of Phrixus were faring towards the city of  Orchomenus from Aea, coming from Cytaean Aeetes, on board a Colchian  ship, to win the boundless wealth of their father; for he, when dying,  had enjoined this journey upon them. And lo, on that day they were very  near that island. But Zeus had impelled the north wind's might to blow,  marking by rain the moist path of Arcturus; and all day long he was  stirring the leaves upon the mountains, breathing gently upon the  topmost sprays; but at night he rushed upon the sea with monstrous  force, and with his shrieking blasts uplifted the surge; and a dark mist  covered the heavens, nor did the bright stars anywhere appear from among  the clouds, but a murky gloom brooded all around. And so the sons of  Phrixus, drenched and trembling in fear of a horrible doom, were borne  along by the waves helplessly. And the force of the wind had snatched  away their sails and shattered in twain the hull, tossed as it was by  the breakers. And hereupon by heaven's prompting those four clutched a  huge beam, one of many that were scattered about, held together by sharp  bolts, when the ship broke to pieces. And on to the island the waves and  the blasts of wind bore the men in their distress, within a little of  death. And straightway a mighty rain burst forth, and rained upon the  sea and the island, and all the country opposite the island, where the  arrogant Mossynoeci dwelt. And the sweep of the waves hurled the sons of  Phrixus, together with their massy beam, upon the beach of the island,  in the murky night; and the floods of rain from Zeus ceased at sunrise,  and soon the two bands drew near and met each other, and Argus spoke  first:    (ll. 1123-1133) \"We beseech you, by Zeus the Beholder, whoever ye are,  to be kindly and to help us in our need. For fierce tempests, falling  on the sea, have shattered all the timbers of the crazy ship in which  we were cleaving our path on business bent. Wherefore we entreat you, if  haply ye will listen, to grant us just a covering for our bodies, and  to pity and succour men in misfortune, your equals in age. Oh, reverence  suppliants and strangers for Zeus' sake, the god of strangers and  suppliants. To Zeus belong both suppliants and strangers; and his eye,  methinks, beholdeth even us.\"    (ll. 1134-1139) And in reply the son of Aeson prudently questioned him,  deeming that the prophecies of Phineus were being fulfilled: \"All these  things will we straightway grant you with right good will. But come tell  me truly in what country ye dwell and what business bids you sail across  the sea, and tell me your own glorious names and lineage.\"    (ll. 1140-1156) And him Argus, helpless in his evil plight, addressed:  \"That one Phrixus an Aeolid reached Aea from Hellas you yourselves have  clearly heard ere this, I trow; Phrixus, who came to the city of Aeetes,  bestriding a ram, which Hermes had made all gold; and the fleece ye may  see even now. The ram, at its own prompting, he then sacrificed to  Zeus, son of Cronos, above all, the god of fugitives. And him did Aeetes  receive in his palace, and with gladness of heart gave him his daughter  Chalciope in marriage without gifts of wooing. [1208] From those two are  we sprung. But Phrixus died at last, an aged man, in the home of  Aeetes; and we, giving heed to our father's behests, are journeying to  Orehomenus to take the possessions of Athamas. And if thou dost desire  to learn our names, this is Cytissorus, this Phrontis, and this Melas,  and me ye may call Argus.\"    (ll. 1157-1159) Thus he spake, and the chieftains rejoiced at the  meeting, and tended them, much marvelling. And Jason again in turn  replied, as was fitting, with these words:    (ll. 1160-1178) \"Surely ye are our kinsmen on my father's side, and ye  pray that with kindly hearts we succour your evil plight. For Cretheus  and Athamas were brothers. I am the grandson of Cretheus, and with  these comrades here I am journeying from that same Hellas to the city of  Aeetes. But of these things we will converse hereafter. And do ye first  put clothing upon you. By heaven's devising, I ween, have ye come to my  hands in your sore need.\"    (ll. 1168-1178) He spake, and out of the ship gave them raiment to put  on. Then all together they went to the temple of Ares to offer sacrifice  of sheep; and in haste they stood round the altar, which was outside the  roofless temple, an altar built of pebbles; within a black stone stood  fixed, a sacred thing, to which of yore the Amazons all used to pray.  Nor was it lawful for them, when they came from the opposite coast, to  burn on this altar offerings of sheep and oxen, but they used to slay  horses which they kept in great herds. Now when they had sacrificed and  eaten the feast prepared, then Aeson's son spake among them and thus  began:    (ll. 1179-1195) \"Zeus' self, I ween, beholds everything; nor do we men  escape his eye, we that be god-fearing and just, for as he rescued your  father from the hands of a murderous step-dame and gave him measureless  wealth besides; even so hath he saved you harmless from the baleful  storm. And on board this ship ye may sail hither and thither, where ye  will, whether to Aea or to the wealthy city of divine Orthomenus. For  our ship Athena built and with axe of bronze cut her timbers near the  crest of Pelion, and with the goddess wrought Argus. But yours the  fierce surge hath shattered, before ye came nigh to the rocks which  all day long clash together in the straits of the sea. But come, be  yourselves our helpers, for we are eager to bring to Hellas the golden  fleece, and guide us on our voyage, for I go to atone for the intended  sacrifice of Phrixus, the cause of Zeus' wrath against the sons of  Aeolus.\"    (ll. 1196-1199) He spake with soothing words; but horror seized them  when they heard. For they deemed that they would not find Aeetes  friendly if they desired to take away the ram's fleece. And Argus spake  as follows, vexed that they should busy themselves with such a quest:    (ll. 1200-1215) \"My friends, our strength, so far as it avails, shall  never cease to help you, not one whit, when need shall come. But Aeetes  is terribly armed with deadly ruthlessness; wherefore exceedingly do I  dread this voyage. And he boasts himself to be the son of Helios;  and all round dwell countless tribes of Colchians; and he might match  himself with Ares in his dread war-cry and giant strength. Nay, to seize  the fleece in spite of Aeetes is no easy task; so huge a serpent keeps  guard round and about it, deathless and sleepless, which Earth herself  brought forth on the sides of Caucasus, by the rock of Typhaon, where  Typhaon, they say, smitten by the bolt of Zeus, son of Cronos, when he  lifted against the god his sturdy hands, dropped from his head hot gore;  and in such plight he reached the mountains and plain of Nysa, where to  this day he lies whelmed beneath the waters of the Serbonian lake.\"    (ll. 1216-1218) Thus he spake, and straightway many a cheek grew pale  when they heard of so mighty an adventure. But quickly Peleus answered  with cheering words, and thus spake:    (ll. 1219-1225) \"Be not so fearful in spirit, my good friend. For we  are not so lacking in prowess as to be no match for Aeetes to try his  strength with arms; but I deem that we too are cunning in war, we that  go thither, near akin to the blood of the blessed gods. Wherefore if he  will not grant us the fleece of gold for friendship's sake, the tribes  of the Colchians will not avail him, I ween.\"    (ll. 1226-1230) Thus they addressed each other in turn, until again,  satisfied with their feast, they turned to rest. And when they rose  at dawn a gentle breeze was blowing; and they raised the sails, which  strained to the rush of the wind, and quickly they left behind the  island of Ares.    (ll. 1231-1241) And at nightfall they came to the island of Philyra,  where Cronos, son of Uranus, what time in Olympus he reigned over the  Titans, and Zeus was yet being nurtured in a Cretan cave by the Curetes  of Ida, lay beside Philyra, when he had deceived Rhea; and the goddess  found them in the midst of their dalliance; and Cronos leapt up from the  couch with a rush in the form of a steed with flowing mane, but Ocean's  daughter, Philyra, in shame left the spot and those haunts, and came  to the long Pelasgian ridges, where by her union with the transfigured  deity she brought forth huge Cheiron, half like a horse, half like a  god.    (ll. 1242-1261) Thence they sailed on, past the Macrones and the  far-stretching land of the Becheiri and the overweening Sapeires, and  after them the Byzeres; for ever forward they clave their way, quickly  borne by the gentle breeze. And lo, as they sped on, a deep gulf of the  sea was opened, and lo, the steep crags of the Caucasian mountains rose  up, where, with his limbs bound upon the hard rocks by galling fetters  of bronze, Prometheus fed with his liver an eagle that ever rushed back  to its prey. High above the ship at even they saw it flying with a loud  whirr, near the clouds; and yet it shook all the sails with the fanning  of those huge wings. For it had not the form of a bird of the air but  kept poising its long wing-feathers like polished oars. And not long  after they heard the bitter cry of Prometheus as his liver was being  torn away; and the air rang with his screams until they marked the  ravening eagle"]]]
