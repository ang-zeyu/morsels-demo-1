It is also an established rule, that the transfer of contraband by a  neutral, from one port of a country to another, where it is required  for the purposes of war, is subject to be treated in the same manner  as an original importation into the country itself.[182]    [Sidenote: Return Voyage Free.]    Generally, the proceeds of the Return Voyage cannot be taken. From the  moment of quitting port on a hostile destination, indeed, the offence  is complete, and it is not necessary to wait till the goods are  actually endeavouring to enter the enemy's port; but beyond that, if  the goods are not taken _in delicto_, and in actual prosecution of  such a voyage, the penalty is not now generally held to attach.[183]        SECTION III.      _Blockades. Right of Search. Convoys_.      [Sidenote: Blockades.]    We now pass on to the subject of Blockade, which is the next exception  to the general freedom of neutral commerce in time of war.    A blockade is a high act of Sovran authority; it cannot be assumed or  exercised by a commander, without special authority, provided his  Government is sufficiently near at hand to superintend and direct the  course of operations; but a commander on a distant station is supposed  to carry with him such a portion of the Sovran authority as may enable  him to act with energy against the commerce of the enemy, as against  the enemy himself.[184]    Again, referring to Sir Wm. Scott's celebrated judgments, we find him  saying,         \"That to constitute a violation of a state of blockade,       three things must be proved: first, the existence of the       blockade; secondly, the knowledge of it, in the party       supposed to have offended; and thirdly, some act of       violation, either by going in, or coming out with a cargo,       laden after the commencement of the blockade.\"    [Sidenote: First Rule of Blockade.]    I. There is no rule of law more established than this; that the Breach  of a Blockade subjects the property so employed to confiscation. Every  man knows it; the subjects of all states know it.    A lawful maritime blockade requires the actual presence of a  sufficient force stationed at the entrance of the port, sufficiently  near to prevent communication.    The blockade is to be considered legally existing, although the winds  may occasionally blow off the blockading squadron. It is an accidental  change which must take place in every blockade; but the blockade is  not therefore suspended.    This axiom is laid down in all books of authority; and the law  considers an attempt to take advantage of such an accidental removal  as an attempt to break the blockade, and a mere fraud.[185]    When a blockading squadron is driven off by a superior force, the  blockade is effectually raised, and it must be renewed by fresh  notification, before foreign nations can be affected by an obligation  to observe it as a blockade. The mere appearance of another squadron  will not renew it, but it must be restored by the measures required  for the original imposition of a blockade.[186]    [Sidenote: Second Rule of Blockade.]    It is necessary that the evidence of a blockade should be clear and  decisive. A blockade may exist without a public declaration; although  a declaration, unsupported by fact, will not be sufficient to  establish it. In the War of 1798, the West India Islands were declared  under blockade by Admiral Jervis; but the Lords of the Supreme Court  held, that as the fact did not support the declaration, a blockade  could not be deemed legally to exist. But the fact, on the contrary,  duly notified on the spot, is of itself sufficient; for public  notifications between governments are meant for the information of  individuals; but if the individual is _personally_ informed, that  purpose is better obtained than by a public declaration.[187]    Where the vessel sails from a country lying near enough to the  blockaded port to have constant information of the blockade, no notice  is necessary of its continuance or relaxation; but when the country is  at a distance beyond constant information, they may lawfully send  their vessels on conjecture that the blockade is broken up, after it  has existed a long time.[188] And this is important, as it must be  remembered that even the _intention_ to evade blockade is a fraudulent  breach of it, and sailing towards the port is an _overt_ act of that  intent.[189]    There are two kinds of Blockade. 1. Simple Blockade, _i.e._ Blockade  in Fact; and 2nd., Blockade in Fact, accompanied by a Notification.  The first expires by the breaking up _intentionally_ of the blockading  squadron. The second, _prima facie_, does not expire until the repeal  of the notification, but it is the duty of the belligerent country  directly the blockade ceases, _de facto_, to revoke its proclamation.  And it would appear that a notified blockade would only expire, in  fact, after some unnecessary and long neglect to publish this  revocation; otherwise neutral nations are bound until such  publication.[190]    It has from time to time been stipulated, in treaties between  belligerent and neutral countries, (as in the case of the Treaty  between Great Britain and the United States, of 1794,) that vessels of  the neutral country should not be considered as having notice of a  blockade, until they have been duly and respectfully warned off; and  it would only be on a second attempt to enter port that they would be  liable to be seized. Under such a treaty a neutral vessel might  lawfully sail for a blockaded port, knowing it to be blockaded.[191]    [Sidenote: Third Rule of Blockade.]    An act of Violation is essential to a Breach of Blockade; such as,  either going in or coming out of the port with a cargo, laden after  the commencement of the blockade: or being found so near to the  blockaded port as to show, beyond a doubt, that the vessel was  endeavouring to run into it: or where the intention is expressly  avowed by the papers found on board.[192]    The time of shipment is very material; for although it may be hard to  refuse a Neutral, liberty to retire with a cargo already laden, and by  that act already become neutral property,--yet, after the commencement  of a blockade, a neutral cannot be allowed to interpose in any way to  assist the exportation of the property of the enemy. After the  commencement of a blockade, a Neutral is no longer at liberty to make  any purchase in that port.[193]    A _Maritime_ Blockade is not in law violated by bringing or sending  goods to the port through the internal canal navigation or land  carriage of the country; and thus such goods are not liable to  confiscation on ground of the blockade.    [Sidenote: Right of Search.]    On the great question of the Right of Search, the International Law  has been summed up by Lord Stowell, in the case of the _Maria_, where  the exercise of the right was attempted to be resisted, by the  interposition of a convoy of Swedish ships of war.[194]    First, the right of visiting and searching merchant ships on the high  seas, whatever be the ships, whatever be the cargoes, whatever be the  destinations, is the incontestible right of the lawfully commissioned  cruizers of a belligerent nation.    Secondly, that the authority of the Sovran of the neutral country,  being interposed in any manner of mere force, cannot legally vary the  rights of a lawfully commissioned belligerent cruizer. It cannot be  maintained, that if a Swedish commissioned cruizer, during the wars of  his own country, has a right, by the Laws of Nations, to visit and  examine neutral ships, the King of England, (being Neutral to Sweden,)  is authorized by law to obstruct the exercise of that right with  respect to the merchants' ships of his country.    Thirdly, that the penalty for the violent contravention of this right,  is the confiscation of the property withheld from visitation and  search.    The judgment of condemnation, pronounced in this case, was followed by  the Treaty of Armed Neutrality entered into by the Baltic Powers to  resist the Right of Search, in 1800, which league was dissolved by the  death of the Emperor Paul, and the points in controversy between those  Powers and Great Britain were finally adjusted by the Convention of  5th of June, 1805.[195]    [Sidenote: Convoys.]    It now remains to say a few words on the subject of Convoy. Convoy is  a ship or ships of war appointed by the Government, or by the  Commander-in-Chief on a particular station, for the guard of merchant  vessels bound to their destination. A warranty that the vessel shall  sail with convoy, is very common in Policies of Insurance, and if not  complied with, the Insurance becomes absolutely void.    This warranty to sail with convoy, does not mean that the vessel shall  depart with convoy immediately from the lading port, but only from the  place of rendezvous appointed for vessels bound from that port, and  must be strictly and impartially maintained by force, to the uniform  universal exclusion of all vessels not privileged by law.[196]    From many ports, and among others from the port of London, no convoy  ever sails. It has therefore been held sufficient for a vessel bound  from London to sail with convoy from the _Downs_, and even from  _Spithead_, when there was no convoy appointed from the _Downs_.  Neither does it require the vessel to sail with convoy bound to the  precise place of her destination; but if the vessel sail with the only  convoy appointed for vessels going to her place of destination, it is  sufficient. It sometimes happens that the force first appointed, is to  accompany the ships only for a part of their voyage, and to be  succeeded by another; at other times a small force is detached from  the main body to bring up to a particular point; if a vessel sail  under the protection of a vessel thus appointed or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13882"],[0,"John Thorndyke's Cases (#17)"],[1,"must,  indeed, or I shall go mad. But I shall tell you what has happened, and  then you must act at once. Spare no effort and no expense. Money is no  object--at least, not in reason,\" he added, with native caution. He sat  down once more, and in perfect English, though with a slight German  accent, proceeded volubly: \"My brother Isaac is probably known to you by  name.\"    Thorndyke nodded.    \"He is a great collector, and to some extent a dealer--that is to say,  he makes his hobby a profitable hobby.\"    \"What does he collect?\" asked Thorndyke.    \"Everything,\" replied our visitor, flinging his hands apart with a  comprehensive gesture--\"everything that is precious and  beautiful--pictures, ivories, jewels, watches, objects of art and  _vertu_--everything. He is a Jew, and he has that passion for things  that are rich and costly that has distinguished our race from the time  of my namesake Solomon onwards. His house in Howard Street, Piccadilly,  is at once a museum and an art gallery. The rooms are filled with cases  of gems, of antique jewellery, of coins and historic relics--some of  priceless value--and the walls are covered with paintings, every one of  which is a masterpiece. There is a fine collection of ancient weapons  and armour, both European and Oriental; rare books, manuscripts, papyri,  and valuable antiquities from Egypt, Assyria, Cyprus, and elsewhere. You  see, his taste is quite catholic, and his knowledge of rare and curious  things is probably greater than that of any other living man. He is  never mistaken. No forgery deceives him, and hence the great prices that  he obtains; for a work of art purchased from Isaac Loewe is a work  certified as genuine beyond all cavil.\"    He paused to mop his face with a silk handkerchief, and then, with the  same plaintive volubility, continued:    \"My brother is unmarried. He lives for his collection, and he lives with  it. The house is not a very large one, and the collection takes up most  of it; but he keeps a suite of rooms for his own occupation, and has two  servants--a man and wife--to look after him. The man, who is a retired  police sergeant, acts as caretaker and watchman; the woman as  housekeeper and cook, if required, but my brother lives largely at his  club. And now I come to this present catastrophe.\"    He ran his fingers through his hair, took a deep breath, and continued:    \"Yesterday morning Isaac started for Florence by way of Paris, but his  route was not certain, and he intended to break his journey at various  points as circumstances determined. Before leaving, he put his  collection in my charge, and it was arranged that I should occupy his  rooms in his absence. Accordingly, I sent my things round and took  possession.    \"Now, Dr. Thorndyke, I am closely connected with the drama, and it is my  custom to spend my evenings at my club, of which most of the members are  actors. Consequently, I am rather late in my habits; but last night I  was earlier than usual in leaving my club, for I started for my  brother's house before half-past twelve. I felt, as you may suppose, the  responsibility of the great charge I had undertaken; and you may,  therefore, imagine my horror, my consternation, my despair, when, on  letting myself in with my latchkey, I found a police-inspector, a  sergeant, and a constable in the hall. There had been a robbery, sir, in  my brief absence, and the account that the inspector gave of the affair  was briefly this:    \"While taking the round of his district, he had noticed an empty hansom  proceeding in leisurely fashion along Howard Street. There was nothing  remarkable in this, but when, about ten minutes later, he was returning,  and met a hansom, which he believed to be the same, proceeding along the  same street in the same direction, and at the same easy pace, the  circumstance struck him as odd, and he made a note of the number of the  cab in his pocket-book. It was 72,863, and the time was 11.35.    \"At 11.45 a constable coming up Howard Street noticed a hansom standing  opposite the door of my brother's house, and, while he was looking at  it, a man came out of the house carrying something, which he put in the  cab. On this the constable quickened his pace, and when the man returned  to the house and reappeared carrying what looked like a portmanteau, and  closing the door softly behind him, the policeman's suspicions were  aroused, and he hurried forward, hailing the cabman to stop.    \"The man put his burden into the cab, and sprang in himself. The cabman  lashed his horse, which started off at a gallop, and the policeman broke  into a run, blowing his whistle and flashing his lantern on to the cab.  He followed it round the two turnings into Albemarle Street, and was  just in time to see it turn into Piccadilly, where, of course, it was  lost. However, he managed to note the number of the cab, which was  72,863, and he describes the man as short and thick-set, and thinks he  was not wearing any hat.    \"As he was returning, he met the inspector and the sergeant, who had  heard the whistle, and on his report the three officers hurried to the  house, where they knocked and rang for some minutes without any result.  Being now more than suspicious, they went to the back of the house,  through the mews, where, with great difficulty, they managed to force a  window and effect an entrance into the house.    \"Here their suspicions were soon changed to certainty, for, on reaching  the first-floor, they heard strange muffled groans proceeding from one  of the rooms, the door of which was locked, though the key had not been  removed. They opened the door, and found the caretaker and his wife  sitting on the floor, with their backs against the wall. Both were bound  hand and foot, and the head of each was enveloped in a green-baize bag;  and when the bags were taken off, each was found to be lightly but  effectively gagged.    \"Each told the same story. The caretaker, fancying he heard a noise,  armed himself with a truncheon, and came downstairs to the first-floor,  where he found the door of one of the rooms open, and a light burning  inside. He stepped on tiptoe to the open door, and was peering in, when  he was seized from behind, half suffocated by a pad held over his mouth,  pinioned, gagged, and blindfolded with the bag.    \"His assailant--whom he never saw--was amazingly strong and skilful, and  handled him with perfect ease, although he--the caretaker--is a powerful  man, and a good boxer and wrestler. The same thing happened to the wife,  who had come down to look for her husband. She walked into the same  trap, and was gagged, pinioned, and blindfolded without ever having soon  the robber. So the only description that we have of this villain is that  furnished by the constable.\"    \"And the caretaker had no chance of using his truncheon?\" said  Thorndyke.    \"Well, he got in one backhanded blow over his right shoulder, which he  thinks caught the burglar in the face; but the fellow caught him by the  elbow, and gave his arm such a twist that he dropped the truncheon on  the floor.\"    \"Is the robbery a very extensive one?\"    \"Ah!\" exclaimed Mr. Loewe, \"that is just what we cannot say. But I fear  it is. It seems that my brother had quite recently drawn out of his bank  four thousand pounds in notes and gold. These little transactions are  often carried out in cash rather than by cheque\"--here I caught a  twinkle in Thorndyke's eve--\"and the caretaker says that a few days ago  Isaac brought home several parcels, which were put away temporarily in a  strong cupboard. He seemed to be very pleased with his new acquisitions,  and gave the caretaker to understand that they were of extraordinary  rarity and value.    \"Now, this cupboard has been cleared out. Not a vestige is left in it  but the wrappings of the parcels, so, although nothing else has been  touched, it is pretty clear that goods to the value of four thousand  pounds have been taken; but when we consider what an excellent buyer my  brother is, it becomes highly probable that the actual value of those  things is two or three times that amount, or even more. It is a  dreadful, dreadful business, and Isaac will hold me responsible for it  all.\"    \"Is there no further clue?\" asked Thorndyke. \"What about the cab, for  instance?\"    \"Oh, the cab,\" groaned Loewe--\"that clue failed. The police must have  mistaken the number. They telephoned immediately to all the police  stations, and a watch was set, with the result that number 72,863 was  stopped as it was going home for the night. But it then turned out that  the cab had not been off the rank since eleven o'clock, and the driver  had been in the shelter all the time with several other men. But there  is a clue; I have it here.\"    Mr. Loewe's face brightened for once as he reached out for the bandbox.    \"The houses in Howard Street,\" he explained, as he untied the fastening,  \"have small balconies to the first-floor windows at the back. Now, the  thief entered by one of these windows, having climbed up a rain-water  pipe to the balcony. It was a gusty night, as you will remember, and  this morning, as I was leaving the house, the butler next door called to  me and gave me this; he had found it lying in the balcony of his house.\"    He opened the bandbox with a flourish, and brought forth a rather shabby  billycock hat.    \"I understand,\" said he, \"that by examining a hat it is possible to  deduce from it, not only the bodily characteristics of the wearer, but  also his mental and moral qualities, his state of health, his pecuniary  position, his past history, and even his domestic relations and the  peculiarities of his place of abode. Am I right in this supposition?\"    The ghost of a smile flitted across Thorndyke's face as he laid the hat  upon the remains of the newspaper. \"We must not expect too much,\" he  observed. \"Hats, as you know, have a way of changing owners.
