Having confined ourselves wholly, in the second part of this Essay, to  the consideration of the _commerce_, we shall now proceed to the  consideration of the _slavery_ that is founded upon it. As this  slavery will be conspicuous in the _treatment_, which the  unfortunate Africans uniformly undergo, when they are put into the hands  of the _receivers_, we shall describe the manner in which they are  accustomed to be used from this period.    To place this in the clearest, and most conspicuous point of view, we  shall throw a considerable part of our information on this head into the  form of a narrative: we shall suppose ourselves, in short, on the  continent of Africa, and relate a scene, which, from its agreement with  unquestionable facts, might not unreasonably be presumed to have been  presented to our view, had we been really there.    And first, let us turn our eyes to the cloud of dust that is before us.  It seems to advance rapidly, and, accompanied with dismal shrieks and  yellings, to make the very air, that is above it, tremble as it rolls  along. What can possibly be the cause? Let us inquire of that melancholy  African, who seems to walk dejected near the shore; whose eyes are  stedfastly fixed on the approaching object, and whose heart, if we can  judge from the appearance of his countenance, must be greatly agitated.    \"Alas!\" says the unhappy African, \"the cloud that you see approaching,  is a train of wretched slaves. They are going to the ships behind you.  They are destined for the English colonies, and, if you will stay here  but for a little time, you will see them pass. They were last night  drawn up upon the plain which you see before you, where they were  branded upon the breast with an _hot iron_; and when they had  undergone the whole of the treatment which is customary on these  occasions, and which I am informed that you Englishmen at home use to  the _cattle_ which you buy, they were returned to their prison. As  I have some dealings with the members of the factory which you see at a  little distance, (though thanks to the Great Spirit, I never dealt in  the _liberty_ of my fellow creatures) I gained admittance there. I  learned the history of some of the unfortunate people, whom I saw  confined, and will explain to you, if my eye should catch them as they  pass, the real causes of their servitude.\"    Scarcely were these words spoken, when they came distinctly into sight.  They appeared to advance in a long column, but in a very irregular  manner. There were three only in the front, and these were chained  together. The rest that followed seemed to be chained by pairs, but by  pressing forward, to avoid the lash of the drivers, the breadth of the  column began to be greatly extended, and ten or more were observed  abreast.    While we were making these remarks, the intelligent African thus resumed  his discourse. \"The first three whom you observe, at the head of the  train, to be chained together, are prisoners of war. As soon as the  ships that are behind you arrived, the news was dispatched into the  inland country; when one of the petty kings immediately assembled his  subjects, and attacked a neighbouring tribe. The wretched people, though  they were surprized, made a formidable resistance, as they resolved,  almost all of them, rather to lose their lives, than survive their  liberty. The person whom you see in the middle, is the father of the two  young men, who are chained to him on each side. His wife and two of his  children were killed in the attack, and his father being wounded, and,  on account of his age, _incapable of servitude_, was left bleeding  on the spot where this transaction happened.\"    \"With respect to those who are now passing us, and are immediately  behind the former, I can give you no other intelligence, than that some  of them, to about the number of thirty, were taken in the same skirmish.  Their tribe was said to have been numerous before the attack; these  however are _all that are left alive_. But with respect to the  unhappy man, who is now opposite to us, and whom you may distinguish, as  he is now looking back and wringing his hands in despair, I can inform  you with more precision. He is an unfortunate convict. He lived only  about five days journey from the factory. He went out with his king to  hunt, and was one of his train; but, through too great an anxiety to  afford his royal master diversion, he roused the game from the covert  rather sooner than was expected. The king, exasperated at this  circumstance, immediately sentenced him to slavery. His wife and  children, fearing lest the tyrant should extend the punishment to  themselves, _which is not unusual_, fled directly to the woods,  where they were all devoured.\"    \"The people, whom you see close behind the unhappy convict, form a  numerous body, and reach a considerable way. They speak a language,  which no person in this part of Africa can understand, and their  features, as you perceive, are so different from those of the rest, that  they almost appear a distinct race of men. From this circumstance I  recollect them. They are the subjects of a very distant prince, who  agreed with the _slave merchants, for a quantity of spirituous  liquors_, to furnish him with a stipulated number of slaves. He  accordingly surrounded, and set fire to one of his own villages in the  night, and seized these people, who were unfortunately the inhabitants,  as they were escaping from the flames. I first saw them as the merchants  were driving them in, about two days ago. They came in a large body, and  were tied together at the neck with leather thongs, which permitted  them to walk at the distance of about a yard from one another. Many of  them were loaden with elephants teeth, which had been purchased at the  same time. All of them had bags, made of skin, upon their shoulders; for  as they were to travel, in their way from the great mountains, through  barren sands and inhospitable woods for many days together, they were  obliged to carry water and provisions with them. Notwithstanding this,  many of them perished, some by hunger, but the greatest number by  fatigue, as the place from whence they came, is at such an amazing  distance from this, and the obstacles, from the nature of the country,  so great, that the journey could scarcely be completed in seven moons.\"    When this relation was finished, and we had been looking stedfastly for  some time on the croud that was going by, we lost sight of that  peculiarity of feature, which we had before remarked. We then discovered  that the inhabitants of the depopulated village had all of them passed  us, and that the part of the train, to which we were now opposite, was a  numerous body of kidnapped people. Here we indulged our imagination. We  thought we beheld in one of them a father, in another an husband, and in  another a son, each of whom was forced from his various and tender  connections, and without even the opportunity of bidding them adieu.  While we were engaged in these and other melancholy reflections, the  whole body of slaves had entirely passed us. We turned almost insensibly  to look at them again, when we discovered an unhappy man at the end of  the train, who could scarcely keep pace with the rest. His feet seemed  to have suffered much from long and constant travelling, for he was  limping painfully along.    \"This man,\" resumes the African. \"has travelled a considerable way. He  lived at a great distance from hence, and had a large family, for whom  he was daily to provide. As he went out one night to a neighbouring  spring, to procure water for his thirsty children, he was kidnapped by  two _slave hunters_, who sold him in the morning to some country  merchants for a _bar of iron_. These drove him with other slaves,  procured almost in the same manner, to the nearest market, where the  English merchants, to whom the train that has just now passed us  belongs, purchased him and two others, by means of their travelling  agents, for a _pistol_. His wife and children have been long  waiting for his return. But he is gone for ever from their sight: and  they must be now disconsolate, as they must be certain by his delay,  that he has fallen into the hands of the _Christians_\".    \"And now, as I have mentioned the name of _Christians_, a name, by  which the Europeans distinguish themselves from us, I could wish to be  informed of the meaning which such an appellation may convey. They  consider themselves as _men_, but us unfortunate Africans, whom  they term _Heathens_, as the _beasts_ that serve us. But ah!  how different is the fact! What is _Christianity_, but a system  of _murder_ and _oppression_? The cries and yells of the  unfortunate people, who are now soon to embark for the regions of  servitude, have already pierced my heart. Have you not heard me sigh,  while we have been talking? Do you not see the tears that now trickle  down my cheeks? and yet these hardened _Christians_ are unable to  be moved at all: nay, they will scourge them amidst their groans, and  even smile, while they are torturing them to death. Happy, happy  Heathenism! which can detest the vices of Christianity,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10633"],[0,"The History of the Rise, Progress and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the (#17)"],[1,"in an honourable, and their tyrants in a  degrading light. \"There is not a Negro from the coast of Africa, who  does not, in this respect, possess a degree of magnanimity which the  soul of his sordid master is too often scarce capable of conceiving.  Fortune never exerted more cruelly her empire over mankind, than when  she subjected those nations of heroes to the refuse of the gaols of  Europe, to wretches who possess the virtue neither of the countries they  came from, nor of those they go to, and whose levity, brutality, and  baseness so justly expose them to the contempt of the vanquished.\" And  now, in 1776, in his _Wealth of Nations_ he showed in a forcible manner  (for he appealed to the interest of those concerned,) the dearness of  African labour; or the impolicy of employing slaves.    Professor Millar, in his _Origin of Ranks_, followed Dr. Smith on the  same ground. He explained the impolicy of slavery in general, by its bad  effects upon industry, population, and morals. These effects he attached  to the system of agriculture as followed in our islands. He showed,  besides, how little pains were taken, or how few contrivances were  thought of, to ease the labourers there. He contended that the Africans  ought to be better treated, and to be raised to a better condition; and  he ridiculed the inconsistency of those who held them in bondage. \"It  affords,\" says he, \"a curious spectacle to observe that the same people,  who talk in a high strain of political liberty, and who consider the  privilege of imposing their own taxes as one of the unalienable rights  of mankind, should make no scruple of reducing a great proportion of  their fellow-creatures into circumstances by which they are not only  deprived of property, but almost of every species of right. Fortune,  perhaps, never produced a situation more calculated to ridicule a  liberal hypothesis, or to show how little the conduct of men is at the  bottom directed by any philosophical principles.\" It is a great honour  to the University of Glasgow, that it should have produced, before any  public agitation of this question, three professors[A], all of whom bore  their public testimony against the continuance of the cruel trade.    [Footnote A: The other was Professor Hutcheson, before mentioned in p.  56.]    From this time, or from about the year 1776, to about the year 1782, I  am to put down three other coadjutors, whose labours seem to have come  in a right season for the promotion of the cause.    The first of these was Dr. ROBERTSON. In his _History of America_ he  laid open many facts relative to this subject. He showed himself a warm  friend both of the Indians and Africans. He lost no opportunity of  condemning that trade, which brought the latter into bondage: \"a trade,\"  says he, \"which is no less repugnant to the feelings of humanity than to  the principles of religion.\" And in his _Charles the Fifth_, he showed  in a manner that was clear, and never to be controverted, that  Christianity was the great cause in the twelfth century of extirpating  slavery from the west of Europe. By the establishment of this fact, he  rendered important services to the oppressed Africans. For if  Christianity, when it began to be felt in the heart, dictated the  abolition of slavery, it certainly became those who lived in a Christian  country, and who professed the Christian religion, to put an end to this  cruel trade.    The second was the Abbe Raynal. This author gave an account of the laws,  government, and religion of Africa, of the produce of it, of the manners  of its inhabitants, of the trade in slaves, of the manner of procuring  these, with several other particulars relating to the subject. And at  the end of his account, fearing lest the good advice he had given for  making the condition of the slaves more comfortable should be construed  into an approbation of such a traffic, he employed several pages in  showing its utter inconsistency with sound policy, justice, reason,  humanity, and religion.    \"I will not here,\" says he, \"so far debase myself as to enlarge the  ignominious list of those writers who devote their abilities to justify  by policy what morality condemns. In an age where so many errors are  boldly laid open, it would be unpardonable to conceal any truth that is  interesting to humanity. If whatever I have hitherto advanced hath  seemingly tended only to alleviate the burden of slavery, the reason is,  that it was first necessary to give some comfort to those unhappy beings  whom we cannot set free, and convince their oppressors that they were  cruel, to the prejudice of their real interests. But, in the mean time,  till some considerable revolution shall make the evidence of this great  truth felt, it may not be improper to pursue this subject further. I  shall then first prove that there is no reason of state which can  authorize slavery. I shall not be afraid to cite to the tribunal of  reason and justice those governments which tolerate this cruelty, or  which even are not ashamed to make it the basis of their power.\"    And a little further on he observes--\"Will it be said that he, who wants  to make me a slave, does me no injury; but that he only makes use of his  rights? Where are those rights? Who hath stamped upon them so sacred a  character as to silence mine?\"    In the beginning of the next paragraph he speaks thus:--\"He who supports  the system of slavery is the enemy of the whole human race. He divides  it into two societies of legal assassins; the oppressors, and the  oppressed. It is the same thing as proclaiming to the world, if you  would preserve your life, instantly take away mine, for I want to have  yours.\"    Going on two pages further, we find these words:--\"But the Negroes, they  say, are a race born for slavery; their dispositions are narrow,  treacherous, and wicked; they themselves allow the superiority of our  understandings, and almost acknowledge the justice of our authority.  Yes; the minds of the Negroes are contracted, because slavery destroys  all the springs of the soul. They are wicked, but not equally so with  you. They are treacherous, because they are under no obligation to speak  truth to their tyrants. They acknowledge the superiority of our  understanding, because we have abused their ignorance. They allow the  justice of our authority, because we have abused their weakness.\"    \"But these Negroes, it is further urged, were born slaves. Barbarians!  will you persuade me that a man can be the property of a sovereign, a  son the property of a father, a wife the property of a husband, a  domestic the property of a master, a Negro the property of a planter?\"    But I have no time to follow this animated author, even by short  extracts, through the varied strains of eloquence which he displays upon  this occasion. I can only say that his labours entitle him to a high  station among the benefactors to the African race.    The third was Dr. PALEY, whose genius, talents, and learning have been  so eminently displayed in his writings in the cause of natural and  revealed religion. Dr. Paley did not write any essay expressly in favour  of the Africans. But in his _Moral Philosophy_, where he treated on  slavery, he took an opportunity of condemning, in very severe terms, the  continuance of it. In this work he defined what slavery was, and how it  might arise consistently with the law of nature; but he made an  exception against that which arose from the African trade. \"The Slave  Trade,\" says he, \"upon the coast of Africa, is not excused by these  principles. When slaves in that country are brought to market, no  questions, I believe, are asked about the origin or justice of the  vendor's title. It may be presumed, therefore, that this title is not  always, if it be ever, founded in any of the causes above assigned.    \"But defect of right in the first purchase is the least crime with which  this traffic is chargeable. The natives are excited to war and mutual  depredation, for the sake of supplying their contracts, or furnishing  the markets with slaves. With this the wickedness begins. The slaves,  torn away from their parents, wives, and children, from their friends  and companions, from their fields and flocks, from their home and  country, are transported to the European settlements in America, with no  other accommodation on ship-board than what is provided for brutes. This  is the second stage of the cruelty, from which the miserable exiles are  delivered, only to be placed, and that for life, in subjection to a  dominion add system of laws, the most merciless and tyrannical that ever  were tolerated upon the face of the earth: and from all that can be  learned by the accounts of people upon the spot, the inordinate  authority which the plantation-laws confer upon the slaveholder is  exercised, by the English slaveholder especially, with rigour and  brutality.    \"But necessity is pretended, the name under which every enormity is  attempted to be justified; and after all, what is the necessity? It has  never been proved that the land could not be cultivated there, as it is  here, by hired servants. It is said, that it could not be cultivated  with quite the same conveniency and cheapness, as by the labour of  slaves; by which means, a pound of sugar, which the planter now sells  for sixpence, could not be afforded under sixpence-halfpenny--and this  is the necessity!    \"The great revolution which has taken place in the western world, may,  probably, conduce (and who knows but that it was designed) to accelerate  the fall of this abominable tyranny: and now that this contest and the  passions which attend it are no more, there may succeed, perhaps, a  season for reflecting, whether a legislature, which had so long lent its  assistance to the support of an institution replete with human misery,  was fit to be trusted with an empire, the most extensive that ever  obtained in any age "]]]
