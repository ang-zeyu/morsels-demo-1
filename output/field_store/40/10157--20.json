And if his Majesty went out on a party, as he would  often do, or to view the country, I always attended him among the  volunteers, of whom a great many always followed him; and he would  often call me out, talk with me, send me upon messages to towns, to  princes, free cities, and the like, upon extraordinary occasions.    The first piece of service he put me upon had like to have embroiled  me with one of his favourite colonels. The king was marching through  the Bergstraet, a low country on the edge of the Rhine, and, as all  men thought, was going to besiege Heidelberg, but on a sudden orders  a party of his guards, with five companies of Scots, to be drawn out;  while they were drawing out this detachment the king calls me to him,  \"Ho, cavalier,\" says he, that was his usual word, \"you shall command  this party;\" and thereupon gives me orders to march back all night,  and in the morning, by break of day, to take post under the walls of  the fort of Oppenheim, and immediately to entrench myself as well as I  could. Grave Neels, the colonel of his guards, thought himself injured  by this command, but the king took the matter upon himself, and Grave  Neels told me very familiarly afterwards, \"We have such a master,\"  says he, \"that no man can be affronted by. I thought myself wronged,\"  says he, \"when you commanded my men over my head; and for my life,\"  says he, \"I knew not which way to be angry.\"    I executed my commission so punctually that by break of day I was set  down within musket-shot of the fort, under covert of a little mount,  on which stood a windmill, and had indifferently fortified myself, and  at the same time had posted some of my men on two other passes, but  at farther distance from the fort, so that the fort was effectually  blocked up on the land side. In the afternoon the enemy sallied on my  first entrenchment, but being covered from their cannon, and defended  by a ditch which I had drawn across the road, they were so well  received by my musketeers that they retired with the loss of six or  seven men.    The next day Sir John Hepburn was sent with two brigades of foot to  carry on the work, and so my commission ended. The king expressed  himself very well pleased with what I had done, and when he was so  was never sparing of telling of it, for he used to say that public  commendations were a great encouragement to valour.    While Sir John Hepburn lay before the fort and was preparing to storm  it, the king's design was to get over the Rhine, but the Spaniards  which were in Oppenheim had sunk all the boats they could find. At  last the king, being informed where some lay that were sunk, caused  them to be weighed with all the expedition possible, and in the night  of the 7th of December, in three boats, passed over his regiment of  guards, about three miles above the town, and, as the king thought,  secure from danger; but they were no sooner landed, and not drawn into  order, but they were charged by a body of Spanish horse, and had not  the darkness given them opportunity to draw up in the enclosures  in several little parties, they had been in great danger of being  disordered; but by this means they lined the hedges and lanes so with  musketeers, that the remainder had time to draw up in battalia, and  saluted the horse with their muskets, so that they drew farther off.    The king was very impatient, hearing his men engaged, having no boats  nor possible means to get over to help them. At last, about eleven  o'clock at night, the boats came back, and the king thrust another  regiment into them, and though his officers dissuaded him, would go  over himself with them on foot, and did so. This was three months that  very day when the battle of Leipsic was fought, and winter time too,  that the progress of his arms had spread from the Elbe, where it parts  Saxony and Brandenburg, to the Lower Palatine and the Rhine.    I went over in the boat with the king. I never saw him in so much  concern in my life, for he was in pain for his men; but before we got  on shore the Spaniards retired. However, the king landed, ordered his  men, and prepared to entrench, but he had not time, for by that time  the boats were put off again, the Spaniards, not knowing more troops  were landed, and being reinforced from Oppenheim, came on again, and  charged with great fury; but all things were now in order, and they  were readily received and beaten back again. They came on again the  third time, and with repeated charges attacked us; but at last  finding us too strong for them they gave it over. By this time another  regiment of foot was come over, and as soon as day appeared the king  with the three regiments marched to the town, which surrendered at the  first summons, and the next day the fort yielded to Sir John Hepburn.    The castle at Oppenheim held out still with a garrison of 800  Spaniards, and the king, leaving 200 Scots of Sir James Ramsey's men  in the town, drew out to attack the castle. Sir James Ramsey being  left wounded at Wurtzburg, the king gave me the command of those 200  men, which were a regiment, that is to say, all that were left of a  gallant regiment of 2000 Scots, which the king brought out of Sweden  with him, under that brave colonel. There was about thirty officers,  who, having no soldiers, were yet in pay, and served as reformadoes  with the regiment, and were over and above the 200 men.    The king designed to storm the castle on the lower side by the way  that leads to Mentz, and Sir John Hepburn landed from the other side  and marched up to storm on the Rhine port.    My reformado Scots, having observed that the town port of the castle  was not so well guarded as the rest, all the eyes of the garrison  being bent towards the king and Sir John Hepburn, came running to me,  and told me they believed they could enter the castle, sword in hand,  if I would give them leave. I told them I durst not give them orders,  my commission being only to keep and defend the town; but they being  very importunate, I told them they were volunteers, and might do what  they pleased, that I would lend them fifty men, and draw up the rest  to second them, or bring them off, as I saw occasion, so as I might  not hazard the town. This was as much as they desired; they sallied  immediately, and in a trice the volunteers scaled the port, cut in  pieces the guard, and burst open the gate, at which the fifty entered.  Finding the gate won, I advanced immediately with 100 musketeers more,  having locked up all the gates of the town but the castle port, and  leaving fifty still for a reserve just at that gate; the townsmen,  too, seeing the castle, as it were, taken, ran to arms, and followed  me with above 200 men. The Spaniards were knocked down by the Scots  before they knew what the matter was, and the king and Sir John  Hepburn, advancing to storm, were surprised when, instead of  resistance, they saw the Spaniards throwing themselves over the walls  to avoid the fury of the Scots. Few of the garrison got away, but were  either killed or taken, and having cleared the castle, I set open the  port on the king's side, and sent his Majesty word the castle was his  own. The king came on, and entered on foot. I received him at the head  of the Scots reformadoes; who all saluted him with their pikes. The  king gave them his hat, and turning about, \"Brave Scots, brave Scots,\"  says he smiling, \"you were too quick for me;\" then beckoning to me,  made me tell him how and in what manner we had managed the storm,  which he was exceeding well pleased with, but especially at the  caution I had used to bring them off if they had miscarried, and  secured the town.    From hence the army marched to Mentz, which in four days' time  capitulated, with the fort and citadel, and the city paid his Majesty  300,000 dollars to be exempted from the fury of the soldiers. Here the  king himself drew the plan of those invincible fortifications which to  this day makes it one of the strongest cities in Germany.    Friburg, Koningstien, Neustadt, Kaiserslautern, and almost all the  Lower Palatinate, surrendered at the very terror of the King of  Sweden's approach, and never suffered the danger of a siege.    The king held a most magnificent court at Mentz, attended by the  Landgrave of Hesse, with an incredible number of princes and lords  of the empire, with ambassadors and residents of foreign princes;  and here his Majesty stayed till March, when the queen, with a great  retinue of Swedish nobility, came from Erfurt to see him. The king,  attended by a gallant train of German nobility, went to Frankfort, and  from thence on to Hoest, to meet the queen, where her Majesty arrived  February 8.    During the king's stay in these parts, his armies were not idle, his  troops, on one side under the Rhinegrave, a brave and ever-fortunate  commander, and under the Landgrave of Hesse, on the other, ranged the  country from Lorraine to Luxemburg, and past the Moselle on the west,  and the Weser on the north. Nothing could stand before them: the  Spanish army which came to the relief of the Catholic Electors was  everywhere defeated and beaten quite out of the country, and the  Lorraine army quite ruined. 'Twas a most pleasant court sure as ever  was seen, where every day expresses arrived of armies defeated, towns  surrendered, contributions agreed upon, parties routed, prisoners  taken, and princes sending ambassadors to sue for truces and  neutralities, to make submissions and compositions, and to pay arrears  and contributions.    Here arrived, February 10, the King of Bohemia from England, and with  him my Lord Craven, with a body of Dutch horse, and a very fine train  of English volunteers, who immediately, without any stay, marched on  to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1226"],[0,"The Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Volume 10 (#17)"],[1,"and this plea greatly more persuasive  still, for it forges one more link in the actual knowledge of continuity.

GEORGE V. N. DEARBORN.  Tufts Medical and Dental  Schools.        ADVENTURINGS IN THE PSYCHICAL.  By H. Addington Bruce.  Little, Brown & Co.,  1914.    Professor Flournoy, in the Preface to his Spiritism and Psychology, made the  remark:  \"It will be a great day when the subliminal psychology of Myers and  his followers, and the abnormal psychology of Freud and his school, succeed  in meeting, and will supplement and complete one another. That will be a  great forward step in science and in the understanding of our nature.\"  (Page VI.)    Any one who attacks the problem from this standpoint, in the right manner,  is to be commended; and this is, very largely, the method of attack taken by  a certain group of \"psychical researches\"; it is also the method of approach  of Mr. Bruce, in the book under review.  Although it will probably contain  but little new to the student of abnormal psychology, it is, nevertheless, a  welcome and extremely sane presentation of the problems discussed; while,  for the general public, the effect of the book cannot be other than  beneficial,-- giving a sound and scientific view-point of many of these  obscure and outlying problems.    Much of this book will be familiar to readers of the JOURNAL.  The chapters  on the \"Subconscious\" (extended and amplified in his final chapter on \"The  Larger Self\"), \"Dissociation and Disease,\" and \"The Singular Case of B. C.  A.,\" contain a summary of material long familiar to general psychological  students--though this data has not been sufficiently popularized as  yet,--while the case of B. C. A. is a relief after the oft-quoted earlier  cases!    The first chapter, \"Ghosts and their Meaning,\" deals with apparitions of the  living, of the dying, and of the dead--according to the tentative  arrangement of these cases made by the English S. P. R. Most of these are  quoted from the Society's Proceedings, and the usual theories are offered to  account for them; in the case of apparitions of the dead, e. g., \"ghosts,\"  the theory of deferred telepathic suggestion being held. This brings us  naturally to the second chapter, \"Why I believe in Telepathy,\" which again  contains a summary of much of the S. P. R. work in this field; accompanied,  however, by some other cases and a few interesting incidents which fell  under the author's personal observation.  The next two chapters deal with  \"Clairvoyance and Crystal Gazing\" and \"Automatic Speaking and Writing\"  respectively.  Here, again, the bulk of the material is familiar to  psychical and psychological students; though it must be admitted that this  material is all excellently and carefully summarized. The author's attitude,  throughout, is strictly critical and scientific; and while he believes in  telepathy and other supernormal powers, he rejects spiritism as an  explanation, and his views throughout are temperate and modest.    The remaining chapter, dealing as it does with \"Poltergeists and Mediums,\"  takes us into the more dubious field of \"physical phenomena\"--spontaneous  and experimental--and cases are discussed which lie outside the province of  the psychologist,-- since they entrench more upon the domain of physics and  biology. As such they have been treated and discussed by the majority of  Continental savants.    One word more regarding the famous medium, Eusapia Palladino, whom Mr. Bruce  refers to in several passages in this Chapter, referring to her in a  footnote on page 196, as \"The discredited Eusapia Palladino, once the marvel  of two continents.\" May I take this occasion to repeat here what I have  often repeated in public and private, elsewhere? and that is, that I retain  my unshaken belief, amounting to a conviction, in the genuineness of  Eusapia's power, and that, despite the trickery which was undoubtedly  discovered here--and which had also been discovered, I may add, more than  twenty years before she ever came to this country--she yet possesses  genuine, remarkable powers of a supernormal character, and this belief, I  may say, is shared equally by all the continental investigators, who remain  unaffected by the so-called American expose. A statement of their attitude  is perhaps well summarized by Flournoy, in his Spiritism and Psychology  (Chap. VII); while I have published the records of the American seances--  for those who may be interested--in my \"Personal Experiences in  Spiritualism,\" where copious extracts from the shorthand notes of the  American sittings are given.    To return, however:  If there is a criticism to make of Mr. Bruce's book, it  is that it displays a lack of personal investigation and experimentation,  and bears throughout the ear-marks of a literary compilation.  But this is,  after all, not a serious detraction from a work of this character,--which  is, as I have said before, excellently done.  HEREWARD CARRINGTON.        DES TROUBLES PSYCHIQUES ET NEVROSIQUES POST-TRAUMATIQUES, Par R. Benon.  Ancien interne de la Clinique des Maladies Mentales et de l'Encephale a la  Faculte de Paris, Medecin de l'Hospice General de Nantes (Quartiers  d'Hospice). G. Steinheil, editeur, Paris, 1913; pp.  x-449.    The author in this volume has written a clinical and medico-legal treatise  on traumatic nervous affections from a broad and philosophical standpoint.  The subject is treated under the following headings:  \"Generalities,\" in  which is discussed the historical development of our knowledge of the  effects of traumatism, the etiology, the evolution of the various  disturbances, and the legal side of the questions at issue.    Following this introduction, under Chapter I, the general topic of what the  writer terms the traumatic dysthenias or the traumatic sthenopathies is  discussed under the following subheadings: (a) Simple post-traumatic  asthenia; (b) Post-traumatic astheno-mania; (c) Prolonged asthenia and  chronic traumatic asthenia, under which he includes traumatic neurasthenia,  traumatic hystero-neurasthenia, traumatic neurosis, and traumatic  psychoneurosis; (d) Chronic post-traumatic mania; (e) Periodic  post-traumatic dysthenias; (f) Asthenic mania and pathological anatomy.  Chapter II, under the general heading, \"Traumatic Dysthymias: (a) Anxiety  post-traumatic hyperthymia; (b) Traumatic hypochondriasis and traumatic  hysteria; (c) Special hyperthymia of accidents; (d) Hysterical and traumatic  crises; (e) Prolonged or permanent post-traumatic disturbances of character  in children and adults. Chapter III, under the general heading, \"Traumatic  Dysthymias\": (a) Traumatic amnesia; (b) Post-traumatic Korsakoff syndrome;  (c) Traumatic mental confusion; (d) Post-traumatic agnosia; (e)  Post-traumatic dementias; (f) Systematized chronic post-traumatic deliriums.  Chapter IV, under the general heading, \"Psychic states and Diverse  Post-Traumatic Neuroses\": (a) Post-traumatic epilepsy; (b) Traumatic  aphasia; (c) Alcoholism, traumatism and hallucinatory conditions; (d)  Post-traumatic sensual perversions; (e) Pains, vertigos, deafness, etc.,  following trauma; (f) Distant post-traumatic psychic disorders with cerebral  lesions; (g) Unclassifiable observations.  To this comprehensive material is  added an appendix on the topic of psychic and neurotic disturbances as  indications for trephining.    This outline of the contents of the book, which contains in addition many  subheadings, gives a sufficiently clear idea of its scope and of the pains  which the author has taken to subdivide his subject matter to the last  possible degree. Whether such a detailed classification has merit sufficient  to justify its complexity must be left to the individual reader to  determine.  It may, however, with justice be said that the author has spared  no pains to illustrate by case reports the various phases of traumatic  disorder which he enumerates. He has a keen sense of the significance of  psychiatric knowledge in a proper understanding of the various results of  trauma, and lays special stress upon the breadth of the psychiatric field,  under which he properly enough includes the various so-called psychoneuroses  as well as epilepsy, tics and aphasia. He believes that one may only arrive  at a diagnostic criterion of such affections through the sensations and  emotions expressed by the patients.  The somatic phenomena he regards as  always subordinate and accessory.  Under this point of view, he attacks his  problem, and with considerable success An admirable brief historical review  of traumatism in relation to the nervous system constitutes a valuable  section of the book, in which he brings out the conflicting views which have  prevailed since the earlier work of Erichsen down through the fundamental  investigations of Westphal, Charcot, Knapp, Oppenheim and others.    The author finds fault with the common use of the word traumatism in the  sense of trauma, and correctly draws attention to the fact that traumatism  should express a general condition, whereas, trauma should be used as  indicative of a local lesion.  This distinction has been too often  overlooked, with resulting confusion.    In general, the book represents a vast amount of painstaking thought and an  earnest but somewhat confusing attempt to bring light into the somewhat dark  places of a much-discussed subject, which has frequently been the source of  more or less acrimonious discussion. Not the least significant part of the  volume is the constant reference to the legal implications of the traumatic  affections. It should therefore be "]]]
