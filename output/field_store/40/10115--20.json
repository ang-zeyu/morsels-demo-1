They attack our race in revenge for  our being so cruel as to kill so many of the animals, large and small, but  this, as you can easily see, is their natural food.\"    This appeal to the eye quite silenced the children, who had considered the  whole story as only an Indian legend to be amused with.    Mary, who had often been worsted by the sharp criticisms and inquiries with  which they were apt to receive her pet Indian legends, was quite delighted  at her apparent triumph, so she hastily sprang up, saying:    \"It is time we were going home. Some other day I will tell you the story of  how the medicines came.\"          CHAPTER XII.      The Naming of the Baby--A Canoe Trip--The Legend of  the Discovery of Medicine--How the Chipmunk Carried the  Good News.    There was great excitement among a number of Indian men and women who had  gathered on the shore in front of the mission one pleasant summer morning.  Grave Indians, with Souwanas in their midst, were calmly discussing some  object of interest, while Mary and a party of women, some of whom had their  babies with them, were much more noisy, talking rapidly about something  which was evidently a matter of exciting interest. Even Sagastao and  Minnehaha were rushing in and out of the house and running from one group  of Indians to the other, full of eager inquiries and pleasant  anticipations. What could it all be about?    Let us ask the children, for such little people often know more than we are  likely to give them credit for. Here comes Minnehaha, and we ask her the  cause of such an early gathering of the Indians, and the reason why they  are so unusually interested in some matter unknown to us.    [Illustration: \"Their babies with them.\"]    \"Why, don't you know?\" the bright little girl promptly replies. \"They have  come to form a Naming Council, to give my little baby sister an Indian  name. You see,\" she added, \"Sagastao and I were born among the Cree  Indians, but baby was born here among the Saulteaux. Just think: the first  little white baby born among them! And they want to give her a nice  Saulteaux name. The reason why they are talking so much now, before they  form the council, is that lots of them have pet names they want to give our  baby, but of course she can only have one.\"    \"Yes,\" said Sagastao, \"and our old Mary is trying to get the women to  oppose the name that Souwanas will offer, just because she is down on him.  But I'll bet he will beat her yet.\"    \"You should not say, 'I'll bet.' Mother has often told you that it was very  rude,\" reprovingly said little Minnehaha. \"You never learned it from father  or mother. You must have picked that up from some rough trader.\"    \"Well, all right, I'll not say it again, but I'll bet--no, I mean--hurrah!  for Souwanas and his side, anyway,\" and off he ran.    \"Dear me!\" said the little sister. \"I do have so much trouble with that  boy!\"    Soon the council assembled. The men and women arranged themselves in a big  circle and spent some time in drinking some strong, well-sweetened tea that  had been prepared for them. They had been desirous of having their usual  pagan ceremonies, but of course this could not be allowed, so the  ceremonies of tea drinking and their usual smoking were substituted. Then  the little baby was brought in by her nurse and handed to one of the oldest  women. She took the child, and after kissing her and uttering some words of  endearment passed her on to the woman on her left. She in her turn kissed  her, uttered some kindly words, and passed her on to the next. So baby went  from hand to hand until she had made the complete circle of women and men.  This was the ceremony of adopting the child into the tribe.    Mary, the nurse of the older children, was excluded from this circle as she  was of another tribe. After some more tea had been drunk the child was  again sent on her rounds. This time each person, as he or she held the  child, pronounced some Indian name that he or she wished the babe to be  called. Mary, who had now crowded herself into the circle, persisted in  having a voice in the matter. She wanted the child to be called  Papewpenases (Laughing Bird), but she was voted down by the crowd, who  said:    \"No, that is Cree; we must have Saulteaux.\"    With a certain amount of decorum each name suggested was discussed, only to  be rejected.    For a time there was quite a deadlock, as no name could be decided upon.    \"Now that you have all spoken,\" said Souwanas, \"and cannot come to any  agreement, I, as chief, will make the final decision. This is the first  white child born among us, as Sagastao and Minnehaha, whom we all love,  were born at Norway House, among the Crees. Most of the names which you  have suggested have some reference to birds and their sweet songs. A  compound name, which will include these ideas and mine, Souwanas (South  Wind), can surely be found.\"    This suggestion was well received, as Florence was born in the spring of  the year, when the birds, returning from the South, filled the air with  melody after the long stillness of that almost Arctic winter.    So busy brains and wagging tongues were at work, and the result was the  formation of the following expressive name, which was quickly bestowed upon  the child. It was first loudly announced by Souwanas himself:  Souwanaquenapeke; which in English is, \"The Voice of the South Wind Birds.\"    At once all the Indians took it up and uttered it over and over again, so  that it would not be forgotten. Even Sagastao and Minnehaha, who could talk  as well in the Indian language as in English, took up the word and shouted  out, Souwanaquenapeke, until they had it as thoroughly as their own.    Mary alone was vexed, and so annoyed that she could not conceal her  disappointment. This was particularly noticed by Sagastao, and as soon as  Minnehaha joined them they slipped quietly away together. Having obtained  permission they took a canoe and went for a paddle on the quiet lake. Mary,  like all other Indians, was passionately fond of the water, and in spite of  her crooked back was a strong and skillful paddler.    The children were placed in the center of the canoe, on a fur rug, while  Mary seated herself in the stern and paddled them over the beautiful sunlit  waves.    For a time but little was heard, for the children were absorbed in the  scenes of rarest beauty or watched some fish, principally the active gold  eyes, sporting in the water around them.    After a while the children began to clamor for a story, but Mary would not  speak a word. Sagastao suspected the cause of Mary's unusual silence.    \"What is the use, sakehou,\" he protested, \"of your being in a pet because  baby was not named Papewpenases? The name they gave her pleased everybody  else; you must be pleased too.\"    \"If you are cross and won't speak to us we will go and run away to  Souwanas; won't we?\" said Minnehaha.    This was too much for Mary, and she quickly surrendered and made an excuse  about thinking of some beautiful story to tell them when they should land  on that little rocky island just ahead of them.    \"Very well,\" said Sagastao, \"let us have the one about how medicines were  discovered and given to the Indians to cure diseases.\"    \"Just the one I was thinking about,\" said Mary; \"and while we rest on the  lovely white sand I will tell you the story.\"    A few vigorous strokes of the paddle sent the canoe well up on the sandy  shore, and soon they all landed. A good romp relieved them of the stiffness  caused by the cramped position in the canoe. Then as they cuddled down in  the warm sand Mary began her story.    \"You remember, little sweethearts, how the animals of various kinds held  councils and decided to be revenged on the human family for their cruelty  by sending diseases among them. Well, these creatures did as they said they  would and the result was that lots of men died, and also the women and  children, that did the creatures no harm, were getting different kinds of  sicknesses and many of them were dying.    \"Were there no diseases among them before these times?\" inquired Minnehaha.    \"No; not what you might call diseases,\" replied Mary. \"The people lived  such simple lives that, with the exception of accident, such as being  drowned in great storms or killed by falling trees, or something that way,  nearly all the people died of old age.\"    \"Then they had no doctors in those days?\" asked Sagastao.    \"No; there were no medicine men in those times. Although there were those  skillful to set broken limbs or attend to any who happened to be  accidentally wounded, but that was nearly all. Then all at once these  diseases sent by the angry animals began to appear among them, and, of  course, there was much alarm. The people did not know what had brought  them, nor how to get rid of them. Many people were sick and numbers of them  died.    \"You see, the animals held their councils in secret, and away from the  presence of men, and so it would never have been known if the ground  squirrel, called by some the chipmunk, had not gone and told all about the  councils to the men. He had always been friendly to the human race. He had  attended a number of the councils and was the only animal that had ventured  to say anything in the favor of man. By doing this he so enraged the other  animals that some of them fell upon him with great fury, and would have  torn him in pieces if he had not been able to escape into his hole in the  ground. As it was, they so tore and wounded him with their teeth and claws"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10956"],[0,"Indian speeches (1907-1909) (#17)"],[1,"ing, namely--and I thought of this when I heard one  or two observations that fell from Mr. Ameer Ali--that no general  proposition can be wisely based on the possession by either community,  either of superior civil qualities or superior personal claims. If you  begin to introduce that element, you perceive the perils to that peace  and mutual goodwill which we hope to emerge by-and-by, though it may  take longer than some think. I repeat that I see no harm from the  point of view of a practical working compromise, in the principle  that population, or numerical strength, should be the main factor in  determining how many representatives should sit for this or the other  community; but modifying influences may be both wisely and equitably  taken into account in allotting the numbers of such representatives.    As regards Indian members on the Executive Council, if you will allow  me to say so, I think it was dubious tactics in you to bring that  question forward. We were told by those who object, for instance,  to my recommending to the Crown an Indian member of the Viceroy's  Executive--that it will never do; that if you choose a man of one  community, the other will demand a second. The Executive Council in  all--this will not be in the Bill--consists of six members. Suppose  there were to be two vacancies, and I were to recommend to the Crown  the appointment of one Mahomedan and one Hindu, the effect would be  that of the six gentlemen one-third would be non-English. You may  think that all right, but it would be a decidedly serious step.  Suppose you say you will bring in a Bill, then, for the purpose of  appointing an extra member always to be an Indian. That is much more  easily said than done. I am talking perfectly plainly. You would not  get such a Bill. I want to talk even more plainly. I want to say  that reference to the Hindu community or the Mahomedan community, in  respect to the position of the Viceroy's Executive, is entirely wide  of the mark in the view, I know, both of the Viceroy and of myself.  If, as I have already said I expect, it may be my duty by-and-by to  recommend to the Crown the name of an Indian member, it will not be  solely for the sake of placing on the Viceroy's Executive Council an  Indian member simply as either a Hindu or a Mahomedan. Decidedly we  are of opinion that the Governor-General in Council will be all the  more likely to transact business wisely, if he has a responsible  Indian adviser at his elbow. But the principle in making such  a recommendation to the Crown, would be to remove the apparent  disability in practice--for there is no disability in law--of an  Indian holding a certain appointment because he is an Indian. That is  a principle we do not accept; and the principle I should go upon--and  I know Lord Minto would say exactly the same--is the desirability  of demonstrating that we hold to the famous promise made in the  proclamation of Queen Victoria in 1858, that if a man is fully  qualified in proved ability and character to fill a certain post, he  shall not be shut out by race or religious faith. There is a very  great deal more to be said on this most important subject; but to-day  I need only tell you--which I do with all respect, without complaining  of what you have said, and without denying that in practical  usage some day there may be means of alternation for meeting your  difficulty--I see no chance whatever of our being able to comply with  your present request.    I have endeavoured to meet you as fairly as I possibly could. I assure  you again we are acting in earnest, with zeal and entire good faith;  and any suggestion that any member of the Government, either in this  office or the Government of India, has any prejudice whatever against  Mahomedans, for the purposes of political administration in India, is  one of the idlest and most wicked misapprehensions that could possibly  enter into the political mind. I am greatly encouraged by having met  you. I am sure that you speak in the name of important bodies of your  own countrymen and of your own community. I am sure that you are going  to look at our proposals in a fair and reasonable spirit, and give  us credit for a desire to do the best that we possibly can in the  interests of all the communities in India, including also the  interests of the British Government. I can only tell you further, that  if this action of ours fails, miscarries, and is wrecked, it will be  a considerable time before another opportunity occurs. You will never  again--I do not care whether the time be long or be short--you will  never again have the combination of a Secretary of State and a  Viceroy, who are more thoroughly in earnest in their desire to improve  Indian government, and to do full justice to every element of the  Indian population.          VII      SECOND READING OF INDIAN COUNCILS BILL    (HOUSE OF LORDS, FEBRUARY 23, 1909)    MY LORDS. I invite the House to take to-day the first definite and  operative step in carrying out the policy that I had the honour of  describing to your Lordships just before Christmas, and that has  occupied the active consideration both of the Home Government and of  the Government of India for very nearly three years. The statement was  awaited in India with an expectancy that with time became impatience,  and it was received in India--and that, after all, is the point to  which I looked with the most anxiety--with intense interest and  attention and various degrees of approval, from warm enthusiasm to  cool assent and acquiescence.    A few days after the arrival of my despatch, a deputation waited upon  the Viceroy unique in its comprehensive character. Both Hindus and  Mahomedans were represented; and they waited upon the Viceroy to offer  warm expressions of gratitude for the scheme that was unfolded  before them. A few days later at Madras the Congress met; they, too,  expressed their thanks to the Home Government and to the Government  of India. The Moslem League met at Amritsar; they were warm in their  approval of the policy which they took to be foreshadowed in the  despatch, though they found fault with the defects they thought they  had discovered in the scheme, and implored the Government, both in  India and here, to remedy those defects. So far as I know--and I do  beg your Lordships to note these details of the reception of our  policy in India--there has been no sign in any quarter, save in the  irreconcilable camp, of anything like organised hostile opinion among  either Indians or Anglo-Indians.    The Indian Civil Service I will speak of very shortly. I will pass  them by for the moment. Lord Lansdowne said truly the other night that  when I spoke at the end of December, I used the words \"formidable and  obscure\" as describing the situation, and he desired to know whether  I thought the situation was still obscure and formidable. I will not  abandon the words, but I think the situation is less formidable and  less obscure. Neither repression on the one hand, nor reform on the  other, could possibly be expected to cut the roots of anarchical crime  in a few weeks. But with unfaltering repression on the one hand, and  vigour and good faith in reform on the other, we see solid reason to  hope that we shall weaken, even if we cannot destroy, those baleful  forces.    There are, I take it, three classes of people that we have to consider  in dealing with a scheme of this kind. There are the extremists, who  nurse fantastic dreams that some day they will drive us out of India.  In this group there are academic extremists and physical force  extremists, and I have seen it stated on a certain authority--it  cannot be more than a guess--that they do not number, whether academic  or physical force extremists, more than one-tenth, or even three per  cent. of what are called the educated class in India. The second  group nourish no hopes of this sort; they hope for autonomy or  self-government of the colonial species and pattern. The third  section in this classification ask for no more than to be admitted to  co-operation in our administration, and to find a free and effective  voice in expressing the interests and needs of their people. I believe  the effect of the reforms has been, is being, and will be, to draw the  second class, who hope for colonial autonomy, into the ranks of the  third class, who will be content with admission to a fair and workable  co-operation. A correspondent wrote to me the other day and said:--        \"We seem to have caught many discontented people on the rebound,      and to have given them an excuse for a loyalty which they have      badly wanted.\"    In spite of all this, it is a difficult and critical situation. Still,  by almost universal admission it has lost the tension that strained  India two or three months ago, and public feeling is tranquillised,  certainly beyond any expectation that either I or the Viceroy ventured  to entertain.    The atmosphere has changed from dark and sullen to hopeful, and I am  sure your Lordships will allow me to be equally confident that nothing  will be done at Westminster to overcloud that promising sky. The noble  Marquess the other day said--and I was delighted to hear it--that  he, at all events, would give us, with all the reservations that  examination of the scheme might demand from him, a whole-hearted  support here, and his best encouragement to the men in India. I  accept that, and I lean upon it, because if anything were done at  Westminster, either by delay or otherwise, to show a breach in what  ought to be the substantial unity of Parliamentary opinion in face of  the Indian situation, it would be a marked disaster. I would venture  on the point of delay to say this. Your Lordships will not suspect me  of having any desire to hurry the Bill, but I remember that when Lord  Cross brought in the Bill of 1892 Lord Kimberley, so well known and so  popular in this House,"]]]
