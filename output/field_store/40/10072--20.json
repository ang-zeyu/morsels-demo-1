It was now morning, the first hour  of the first day of the two thousandth year of our era.  Acting, as was  their wont, in strict accordance with precedent, the highest Circles of  the realm were meeting in solemn conclave, as they had met on the first  hour of the first day of the year 1000, and also on the first hour of  the first day of the year 0.    The minutes of the previous meetings were now read by one whom I at  once recognized as my brother, a perfectly Symmetrical Square, and the  Chief Clerk of the High Council.  It was found recorded on each  occasion that:  \"Whereas the States had been troubled by divers  ill-intentioned persons pretending to have received revelations from  another World, and professing to produce demonstrations whereby they  had instigated to frenzy both themselves and others, it had been for  this cause unanimously resolved by the Grand Council that on the first  day of each millenary, special injunctions be sent to the Prefects in  the several districts of Flatland, to make strict search for such  misguided persons, and without formality of mathematical examination,  to destroy all such as were Isosceles of any degree, to scourge and  imprison any regular Triangle, to cause any Square or Pentagon to be  sent to the district Asylum, and to arrest any one of higher rank,  sending him straightway to the Capital to be examined and judged by the  Council.\"    \"You hear your fate,\" said the Sphere to me, while the Council was  passing for the third time the formal resolution.  \"Death or  imprisonment awaits the Apostle of the Gospel of Three Dimensions.\"  \"Not so,\" replied I, \"the matter is now so clear to me, the nature of  real space so palpable, that methinks I could make a child understand  it.  Permit me but to descend at this moment and enlighten them.\" \"Not  yet,\" said my Guide, \"the time will come for that.  Meantime I must  perform my mission.  Stay thou there in thy place.\" Saying these words,  he leaped with great dexterity into the sea (if I may so call it) of  Flatland, right in the midst of the ring of Counsellors.  \"I come,\"  said he, \"to proclaim that there is a land of Three Dimensions.\"    I could see many of the younger Counsellors start back in manifest  horror, as the Sphere's circular section widened before them.  But on a  sign from the presiding Circle--who shewed not the slightest alarm or  surprise--six Isosceles of a low type from six different quarters  rushed upon the Sphere.  \"We have him,\" they cried; \"No; yes; we have  him still! he's going! he's gone!\"    \"My Lords,\" said the President to the Junior Circles of the Council,  \"there is not the slightest need for surprise; the secret archives, to  which I alone have access, tell me that a similar occurrence happened  on the last two millennial commencements.  You will, of course, say  nothing of these trifles outside the Cabinet.\"    Raising his voice, he now summoned the guards.  \"Arrest the policemen;  gag them.  You know your duty.\"  After he had consigned to their fate  the wretched policemen--ill-fated and unwilling witnesses of a  State-secret which they were not to be permitted to reveal--he again  addressed the Counsellors.  \"My Lords, the business of the Council  being concluded, I have only to wish you a happy New Year.\" Before  departing, he expressed, at some length, to the Clerk, my excellent but  most unfortunate brother, his sincere regret that, in accordance with  precedent and for the sake of secrecy, he must condemn him to perpetual  imprisonment, but added his satisfaction that, unless some mention were  made by him of that day's incident, his life would be spared.          SECTION 19  How, though the Sphere shewed me other mysteries of              Spaceland, I still desire more; and what came of it      When I saw my poor brother led away to imprisonment, I attempted to  leap down into the Council Chamber, desiring to intercede on his  behalf, or at least bid him farewell.  But I found that I had no motion  of my own.  I absolutely depended on the volition of my Guide, who said  in gloomy tones, \"Heed not thy brother; haply thou shalt have ample  time hereafter to condole with him.  Follow me.\"    Once more we ascended into space.  \"Hitherto,\" said the Sphere, \"I have  shewn you naught save Plane Figures and their interiors.  Now I must  introduce you to Solids, and reveal to you the plan upon which they are  constructed.  Behold this multitude of moveable square cards.  See, I  put one on another, not, as you supposed, Northward of the other, but  ON the other.  Now a second, now a third.  See, I am building up a  Solid by a multitude of Squares parallel to one another.  Now the Solid  is complete, being as high as it is long and broad, and we call it a  Cube.\"    \"Pardon me, my Lord,\" replied I; \"but to my eye the appearance is as of  an Irregular Figure whose inside is laid open to view; in other words,  methinks I see no Solid, but a Plane such as we infer in Flatland; only  of an Irregularity which betokens some monstrous criminal, so that the  very sight of it is painful to my eyes.\"    \"True,\" said the Sphere; \"it appears to you a Plane, because you are  not accustomed to light and shade and perspective; just as in Flatland  a Hexagon would appear a Straight Line to one who has not the Art of  Sight Recognition.  But in reality it is a Solid, as you shall learn by  the sense of Feeling.\"    He then introduced me to the Cube, and I found that this marvellous  Being was indeed no Plane, but a Solid; and that he was endowed with  six plane sides and eight terminal points called solid angles; and I  remembered the saying of the Sphere that just such a Creature as this  would be formed by the Square moving, in Space, parallel to himself:  and I rejoiced to think that so insignificant a Creature as I could in  some sense be called the Progenitor of so illustrious an offspring.    But still I could not fully understand the meaning of what my Teacher  had told me concerning \"light\" and \"shade\" and \"perspective\"; and I did  not hesitate to put my difficulties before him.    Were I to give the Sphere's explanation of these matters, succinct and  clear though it was, it would be tedious to an inhabitant of Space, who  knows these things already.  Suffice it, that by his lucid statements,  and by changing the position of objects and lights, and by allowing me  to feel the several objects and even his own sacred Person, he at last  made all things clear to me, so that I could now readily distinguish  between a Circle and a Sphere, a Plane Figure and a Solid.    This was the Climax, the Paradise, of my strange eventful History.  Henceforth I have to relate the story of my miserable Fall:--most  miserable, yet surely most undeserved!  For why should the thirst for  knowledge be aroused, only to be disappointed and punished?  My  volition shrinks from the painful task of recalling my humiliation;  yet, like a second Prometheus, I will endure this and worse, if by any  means I may arouse in the interiors of Plane and Solid Humanity a  spirit of rebellion against the Conceit which would limit our  Dimensions to Two or Three or any number short of Infinity.  Away then  with all personal considerations!  Let me continue to the end, as I  began, without further digressions or anticipations, pursuing the plain  path of dispassionate History.  The exact facts, the exact words,--and  they are burnt in upon my brain,--shall be set down without alteration  of an iota; and let my Readers judge between me and Destiny.    The Sphere would willingly have continued his lessons by indoctrinating  me in the conformation of all regular Solids, Cylinders, Cones,  Pyramids, Pentahedrons, Hexahedrons, Dodecahedrons, and Spheres:  but I  ventured to interrupt him.  Not that I was wearied of knowledge.  On  the contrary, I thirsted for yet deeper and fuller draughts than he was  offering to me.    \"Pardon me,\" said I, \"O Thou Whom I must no longer address as the  Perfection of all Beauty; but let me beg thee to vouchsafe thy servant  a sight of thine interior.\"    Sphere.  My what?    I.  Thine interior:  thy stomach, thy intestines.    Sphere.  Whence this ill-timed impertinent request?  And what mean you  by saying that I am no longer the Perfection of all Beauty?    I.  My Lord, your own wisdom has taught me to aspire to One even more  great, more beautiful, and more closely approximate to Perfection than  yourself.  As you yourself, superior to all Flatland forms, combine  many Circles in One, so doubtless there is One above you who combines  many Spheres in One Supreme Existence, surpassing even the Solids of  Spaceland.  And even as we, who are now in Space, look down on Flatland  and see the insides of all things, so of a certainty there is yet above  us some higher, purer region, whither thou dost surely purpose to lead  me--O Thou Whom I shall always call, everywhere and in all Dimensions,  my Priest, Philosopher, and Friend--some yet more spacious Space, some  more dimensionable Dimensionality, from the vantage-ground of which we  shall look down together upon the revealed insides of Solid things, and  where thine own intestines, and those of thy kindred Spheres, will lie  exposed to the view of the poor wandering exile from Flatland, to whom  so much has already been vouchsafed.    Sphere.  Pooh!  Stuff!  Enough of this trifling!  The time is short,  and much remains to be done before you are fit to proclaim the Gospel  of Three Dimensions to your blind benighted countrymen in Flatland.    I.  Nay, gracious Teacher, deny me not what I know it is in thy power  to perform.  Grant me but one glimpse of thine interior, and I am  satisfied for ever, remaining henceforth thy docile pupil, thy  unemancipable slave, ready to receive all thy teachings and to feed upon  the words that fall from thy lips.

He was grateful for  this light respite from the heat of the hole, but his joy faded when  the man opened a door and he stood at last before the chief, Douglas  Campbell, who looked up at the burly Irishman in a long silence.    The scion of the ancient and glorious clan of the Campbells had fallen  far indeed. His face was a brilliant red, and the nose, comically  swollen at the end, was crossed with many blue veins. Like Milton's  _Satan_, however, he retained some traces of his original brightness.  Harrigan knew at once that the chief engineer was fully worthy of  joining those rulers of the south seas and harriers of weaker men,  McTee and White Henshaw.    \"Stand straight and look me in the eye,\" said Campbell, and in his  voice was a slight \"bur-r-r\" of the Scotch accent.    Harrigan jerked back his shoulders and stood like a soldier at  attention.    \"A drinkin' man,\" he was saying to himself, \"may be hard an' fallen  low, but he's sure to have a heart.\"    \"So you're the mutineer, my fine buck?\"    Harrigan hesitated, and this seemed to infuriate Campbell, who banged a  brawny fist on a table and thundered: \"Answer me, or I'll skin your  worthless carcass!\"    The cold, blue eyes of Harrigan did not falter. They studied the face  of the Campbell as a fighter gauges his opponent.    \"If I say 'yes,'\" he responded at length, \"it's as good as puttin'  myself in chains; if I say 'no,' you'll be thinkin' I'm givin' in, you  an' McTee, damn his eyes!\"    Campbell grew still redder.    \"You damn him, do you? McTee is Scotch; he's a gentleman too good to be  named by swine!\"    The irrepressible Harrigan replied: \"He's enough to make swine speak!\"    Amazement and then a gleam of laughter shone in the eyes of the chief  engineer. He was seized, apparently, by a fit of violent coughing and  had to turn away, hiding his face with his hand. When he faced the  Irishman again, his jaw was set hard, but his eyes were moist.    \"Look me in the eye, laddie. Men say a good many things about me; they  call me a slave driver and worse. Why? Because when I say 'move,' my  men have to jump. I've asked you a question, and I'm going to get an  answer. Are you a mutineer or not?\"    \"I will not pleasure McTee by sayin' I'm not!\"    The ponderous hand rose over the table, but it was checked before it  fell.    \"What the devil has McTee to do with this?\" he bellowed.    \"He's the one that sent me here.\" Harrigan was thinking fast as he went  on: \"And you're going to keep me here for the sake of McTee.\"    Campbell changed from red to purple and exploded: \"I'll keep no man  here to please another; not White Henshaw himself. He rules on deck,  and I rule below. D'you hear? Tell me you're a liar! Speak up!\"    \"You're a liar,\" said Harrigan instantly.    The engineer's mouth opened and closed twice while he stared at  Harrigan.    \"Get out!\" he shouted, springing to his feet. \"I'll have you boxed up  and sweated; I'll have you pounded to a pulp! Wait! Stay here! I'll  bring in some men!\"    Harrigan was desperate. He knew that what he had said was equivalent to  a mutiny. He threw caution to the wind. Campbell had rung a bell.    \"Bring your men an' be damned!\" he answered; and now his head tilted  back and he set his shoulders to the wall. \"I'll be afther lickin' your  whole crew! A man do ye call yourself? Ah-h, ye're not fit to be  lickin' the boots ay a man! Slave driver? No, ye're an overseer, an'  Henshaw kicks you an' you pass the kick along. But lay a hand on  Harrigan, an' he'll tear the rotten head off your shoulders!\"    The door flew open, and the second assistant engineer, a burly man,  with two or three others, appeared at the entrance, drawn by the  furious clamor of the bell.    \"What--\" began the second assistant, and then stopped as he caught  sight of Harrigan against the wall with his hands poised, ready for the  first attack.    \"Who called you?\" roared Campbell.    \"Your bell--\" began the assistant.    \"You lie! Get out! I was telling a joke to my old friend Harrigan.  Maybe I leaned back against the bell. Shake hands with Harrigan. I've  known him for years.\"    Incredulous, Harrigan lowered his clenched fist and relaxed it to meet  the hesitant hand of the assistant.    \"Now be off,\" growled the chief, and the others fled.    As the door closed, Harrigan turned in stupid amazement upon the  Scotchman. The latter had dropped into his chair again and now looked  at Harrigan with twinkling eyes.    \"You'd have fought 'em all, eh, lad?\"    He burst into heavy laughter.    \"Ah, the blue devil that came in your eyes! Why did I not let them have  one whirl at you? Ha, ha, ha!\"    \"Wake me up,\" muttered Harrigan. \"I'm dreamin'!\"    \"There's a thick lie in my throat,\" said Campbell. \"I must wash it out  and leave a truth there!\"    He opened a small cupboard, exposing a formidable array of black and  green bottles. One of the black he pulled down, as well as two small  glasses, which he filled to the brim.    \"To your bonny blue eyes, lad!\" he said, and raised a glass. \"Here's an  end to the mutiny--and a drop to our old friendship!\"    Harrigan, still with clouded mind, raised the glass and drank. It was a  fine sherry wine.    \"How old would you say that wine was?\" queried the Scotchman with  exaggerated carelessness.    The carelessness did not deceive Harrigan. His mind went blanker still,  for he knew little about good wines.    \"Well?\" asked the engineer.    \"H-m!\" muttered Harrigan, and racked his brain to remember the ages at  which a good vintage becomes a rare old wine. \"About thirty-five  years.\"    \"By the Lord!\" cried Campbell. \"It never fails--a strong man knows his  liquor like a book! You're almost right. Add three years and you have  it! Thirty-eight years in sunshine and shadow!\"    He leaned back and gazed dreamily up to the ceiling.    \"Think of it,\" he went on in a reverent murmur. \"Men have been born and  grown strong and then started toward the shady side of life since this  wine was put in the bottle. For thirty-eight years it has been  gathering and saving its perfume--draw a breath of it now, lad!--and  when I uncork the bottle, all the odor blows out to me at once.\"    \"True,\" said Harrigan, nodding sagely. \"I've thought the same thing,  but never found the words for it, chief.\"    \"Have you?\" asked Campbell eagerly. \"Sit down, lad; sit down! Well,  well! Good wine was put on earth for a blessing, but men have misused  it, Harrigan--but hear me preaching when I ought to be praying!\"    \"Prayin'?\" repeated the diplomatic Harrigan. \"No, no, man! Maybe you've  drunk a good store of liquor, but it shines through you. It puts a  flush on your face like a sun shinin' through a cloud. You'd hearten  any man on a dark day!\"    He could not resist the play on the words, and a shadow crossed the  face of the engineer.    \"Harrigan,\" he growled, \"there's a double meaning in what you say, but  I'll not think of it. You're no fool, lad, but do not vex me. But say  your say. I suppose I'm red enough to be seen by my own light on a dark  night. What does Bobbie say?    \"Oh, wad some power the giftie gie us  To see oursels as others see us!    \"Well, well! I forgave you for the sake of Bobbie! Do you know his  rhymes, lad?\"    A light shone in the eye of Harrigan. He began to sing softly in his  musical, deep voice: \"Ye banks and braes of bonny Doon--\"    \"No, no, man!\" cried Campbell, raising his hand in horror at the sound  of the false accent. \"It should go like this!\"    He pulled a guitar out of a case and commenced to strum lightly on it,  while he rendered the old song in a voice roughened by ill usage but  still strong and true. A knock at the door interrupted him at the  climax of his song, and he glared toward the unseen and rash intruder.    \"What will ye hae?\" he roared, continuing the dialect which the song  had freshened on his tongue.    \"The shift in the fireroom is short-handed,\" said the voice. \"That  fellow Harrigan has not shown up. Shall we search for him?\"    \"Search for the de'il!\" thundered Campbell. \"Harrigan is doing a fine  piece of work for me; shall I let him go to the fireroom to swing a  shovel?\"    \"The captain's orders, sir,\" persisted the voice rashly.    Campbell leaped for the door and jerked it open a few inches.    \"Be off!\" he cried; \"or I'll set you passin' coal yourself, my fine  lad! What? Will ye be asking questions? Is there no discipline? Mutiny,  mutiny--that's what this is!\"    \"Aye, aye, sir!\" murmured a rapidly retreating voice.    Campbell closed and locked the door and turned back to Harrigan with a  grin.    \"The world's a wide place,\" he said, \"but there's few enough in it who  know our Bobbie, God bless him! When I've found one, shall I let him go  down to the fireroom? Ha! Now tell me what's wrong between you and  McTee.\"    \"I will not talk,\" said Harrigan with another bold stroke of diplomacy,  \"till I hear the rest of that song. The true Scotch comes hard on my  tongue, but I'll learn it.\"    \"You will, laddie, for your heart's right. Man, man, I'm nothing now,  but you should have heard me sing in the old days--\"    \"When we were in Glasgow,\" grinned Harrigan.    \"In Glasgow,\" repeated Campbell, and then lifted his head and finished  the song. \"Now for the story, laddie.\"    Harrigan started, as though recalled from a dream built up by the  music. Then he told briefly the tale of the tyranny aboard the _Mary  Rogers_, now apparently to be repeated.    \"So I thought,\" he concluded, \"that it was to be the old story over  again--look at my hands!\"    He held them out. The palms were still red and deeply scarred. Campbell  said nothing, but his jaw set savagely.    \"I thought it was to be this all over again,\" went "]]]
