wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy             jealousy burn like fire?    19:079:006 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee,             and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.    19:079:007 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling             place.    19:079:008 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender             mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.    19:079:009 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name:             and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.    19:079:010 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him             be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of             the blood of thy servants which is shed.    19:079:011 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to             the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are             appointed to die;    19:079:012 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom             their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.    19:079:013 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee             thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all             generations.    19:080:001 Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like             a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine             forth.    19:080:002 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength,             and come and save us.    19:080:003 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we             shall be saved.    19:080:004 O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the             prayer of thy people?    19:080:005 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them             tears to drink in great measure.    19:080:006 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies             laugh among themselves.    19:080:007 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine;             and we shall be saved.    19:080:008 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the             heathen, and planted it.    19:080:009 Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take             deep root, and it filled the land.    19:080:010 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs             thereof were like the goodly cedars.    19:080:011 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto             the river.    19:080:012 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they             which pass by the way do pluck her?    19:080:013 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of             the field doth devour it.    19:080:014 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from             heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;    19:080:015 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the             branch that thou madest strong for thyself.    19:080:016 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the             rebuke of thy countenance.    19:080:017 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son             of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.    19:080:018 So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call             upon thy name.    19:080:019 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine;             and we shall be saved.    19:081:001 Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the             God of Jacob.    19:081:002 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp             with the psaltery.    19:081:003 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on             our solemn feast day.    19:081:004 For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of             Jacob.    19:081:005 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out             through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I             understood not.    19:081:006 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were             delivered from the pots.    19:081:007 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered             thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the             waters of Meribah. Selah.    19:081:008 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if             thou wilt hearken unto me;    19:081:009 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou             worship any strange god.    19:081:010 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of             Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.    19:081:011 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would             none of me.    19:081:012 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked             in their own counsels.    19:081:013 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked             in my ways!    19:081:014 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand             against their adversaries.    19:081:015 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto             him: but their time should have endured for ever.    19:081:016 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and             with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.    19:082:001 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/808"],[0,"The Complete Plays of Gilbert and Sullivan (#16)"],[1,"                 Though, mind you, it's expensive.

You the most miserable man in my    whole dominion?  How can you have the face to stand there and say    such a thing?  Why, look at me!  Look at me!  (Bursts into    tears.)          LUD.  Well, I wouldn't be a cry-baby.          RUD.  A cry-baby?  If you had just been told that you were    going to be deposed to-morrow, and perhaps blown up with dynamite    for all I know, wouldn't you be a cry-baby?  I do declare if I    could only hit upon some cheap and painless method of putting an    end to an existence which has become insupportable, I would    unhesitatingly adopt it!          LUD.  You would? (Aside.) I see a magnificent way out of    this!  By Jupiter, I'll try it!  (Aloud.)  Are you, by any    chance, in earnest?          RUD.  In earnest?  Why, look at me!          LUD.  If you are really in earnestif you really desire to    escape scot-free from this impendingthis unspeakably horrible    catastrophewithout trouble, danger, pain, or expensewhy not    resort to a Statutory Duel?          RUD.  A Statutory Duel?          LUD.  Yes.  The Act is still in force, but it will expire    to-morrow afternoon.  You fightyou loseyou are dead for a    day.  To-morrow, when the Act expires, you will come to life    again and resume your Grand Duchy as though nothing had happened.    In the meantime, the explosion will have taken place and the    survivor will have had to bear the brunt of it.          RUD.  Yes, that's all very well, but who'll be fool enough    to be the survivor?          LUD.  (kneeling).  Actuated by an overwhelming sense of    attachment to your Grand Ducal person, I unhesitatingly offer    myself as the victim of your subjects' fury.          RUD.  You do?

But suppose I were to lose?          LUD.  Oh, that's easily arranged.  (Producing cards.)  I'll    put an Ace up my sleeveyou'll put a King up yours.

I never thought of that.  (Going.)          RUD.  (hastily).  Not that I mind.  But I sayyou won't    take an unfair advantage of your day of office?  You won't go    tipping people, or squandering my little savings in fireworks, or    any nonsense of that sort?          LUD.  I am hurtreally hurtby the suggestion.          RUD.  Youyou wouldn't like to put down a deposit,    perhaps?          LUD.  No.  I don't think I should like to put down a    deposit.          RUD.  Or give a guarantee?          LUD.  A guarantee would be equally open to objection.          RUD.  It would be more regular.  Very well, I suppose you    must have your own way.          LUD.  Good.  I saywe must have a devil of a quarrel!          RUD.  Oh, a devil of a quarrel!          LUD.  Just to give colour to the thing.  Shall I give you a    sound thrashing before all the people?

Still, a devil of a quarrel!          LUD.  Oh, a devil of a quarrel!          RUD.  No half measures.  Big wordsstrong languagerude    remarks.  Oh, a devil of a quarrel!          LUD.  Now the question is, how shall we summon the people?          RUD.  Oh, there's no difficulty about that.  Bless your    heart, they'"]]]
