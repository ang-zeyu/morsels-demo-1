Dr. Beddoes wrote at the      beginning of the nineteenth century: \"It is in vain that we      dissemble to ourselves the eagerness with which children of      either sex seek to satisfy themselves concerning the conformation      of the other. No degree of reserve in the heads of families, no      contrivances, no care to put books of one description out of      sight and to garble others, has perhaps, with any one set of      children, succeeded in preventing or stifling this kind of      curiosity. No part of the history of human thought would perhaps      be more singular than the stratagems devised by young people in      different situations to make themselves masters or witnesses of      the secret. And every discovery, due to their own inquiries, can      but be so much oil poured upon an imagination in flames\" (T.      Beddoes, _Hygeia_, 1802, vol. iii, p. 59). Kaan, again, in one of      the earliest books on morbid sexuality, sets down mystery as one      of the causes of _psychopathia sexualis_. Marro (_La Puberta_, p.      299) points out how the veil of mystery thrown over sexual      matters merely serves to concentrate attention on them. The      distinguished Dutch writer Multatuli, in one of his letters      (quoted with approval by Freud), remarks on the dangers of hiding      things from boys and girls in a veil of mystery, pointing out      that this must only heighten the curiosity of children, and so      far from keeping them pure, which mere ignorance can never do,      heats and perverts their imaginations. Mrs. Mary Wood Allen,      also, warns the mother (op. cit., p. 5) against the danger of      allowing any air of embarrassing mystery to creep over these      things. \"If the instructor feels any embarrassment in answering      the queries of the child, he is not fitted to be the teacher, for      the feeling of embarrassment will, in some subtle way,      communicate itself to the child, and he will experience an      indefinable sense of offended delicacy which is both unnecessary      and undesirable. Purification of one's own thought is, then, the      first step towards teaching the truth purely. Why,\" she adds, \"is      death, the gateway out of life, any more dignified or pathetic      than birth, the gateway into life? Or why is the taking of      earthly life a more awful fact than the giving of life?\" Mrs.      Ennis Richmond, in a book of advice to mothers which contains      many wise and true things, says: \"I want to insist, more strongly      than upon anything else, that it is the _secrecy_ that surrounds      certain parts of the body and their functions that gives them      their danger in the child's thought. Little children, from      earliest years, are taught to think of these parts of their body      as mysterious, and not only so, but that they are mysterious      because they are unclean. Children have not even a name for them.      If you have to speak to your child, you allude to them      mysteriously and in a half-whisper as 'that little part of you      that you don't speak of,' or words to that effect. Before      everything it is important that your child should have a good      working name for these parts of his body, and for their      functions, and that he should be taught to use and to hear the      names, and that as naturally and openly as though he or you were      speaking of his head or his foot. Convention has, for various      reasons, made it impossible to speak in this way in public. But      you can, at any rate, break through this in the nursery. There      this rule of convention has no advantage, and many a serious      disadvantage. It is easy to say to a child, the first time he      makes an 'awkward' remark in public: 'Look here, laddie, you may      say what you like to me or to daddy, but, for some reason or      other, one does not talk about these' (only say _what_ things)      'in public.' Only let your child make the remark in public      _before_ you speak (never mind the shock to your caller's      feelings), don't warn him against doing so\" (Ennis Richmond,      _Boyhood_, p. 60). Sex must always be a mystery, but, as Mrs.      Richmond rightly says, \"the real and true mysteries of generation      and birth are very different from the vulgar secretiveness with      which custom surrounds them.\"        The question as to the precise names to be given to the more      private bodily parts and functions is sometimes a little      difficult to solve. Every mother will naturally follow her own      instincts, and probably her own traditions, in this matter. I      have elsewhere pointed out (in the study of \"The Evolution of      Modesty\") how widespread and instinctive is the tendency to adopt      constantly new euphemisms in this field. The ancient and simple      words, which in England a great poet like Chaucer could still use      rightly and naturally, are so often dropped in the mud by the      vulgar that there is an instinctive hesitation nowadays in      applying them to beautiful uses. They are, however,      unquestionably the best, and, in their origin, the most dignified      and expressive words. Many persons are of opinion that on this      account they should be rescued from the mud, and their sacredness      taught to children. A medical friend writes that he always taught      his son that the vulgar sex names are really beautiful words of      ancient origin, and that when we understand them aright we cannot      possibly see in them any motive for low jesting. They are simple,      serious and solemn words, connoting the most central facts of      life, and only to ignorant and plebeian vulgarity can they cause      obscene mirth. An American man of science, who has privately and      anonymously printed some pamphlets on sex questions, also takes      this view, and consistently and methodically uses the ancient      and simple words. I am of opinion that this is the ideal to be      sought, but that there are obvious difficulties at present in the      way of attaining it. In any case, however, the mother should be      in possession of a very precise vocabulary for all the bodily      parts and acts which it concerns her children to know.    It is sometimes said that at this early age children should not be told,  even in a simple and elementary form, the real facts of their origin but  should, instead, hear a fairy-tale having in it perhaps some kind of  symbolic truth. This contention may be absolutely rejected, without  thereby, in any degree, denying the important place which fairy-tales hold  in the imagination of young children. Fairy-tales have a real value to the  child; they are a mental food he needs, if he is not to be spiritually  starved; to deprive him of fairy-tales at this age is to do him a wrong  which can never be made up at any subsequent age. But not only are sex  matters too vital even in childhood to be safely made matter for a  fairy-tale, but the real facts are themselves as wonderful as any  fairy-tale, and appeal to the child's imagination with as much force as a  fairy-tale.    Even, however, if there were no other reasons against telling children  fairy-tales of sex instead of the real facts, there is one reason which  ought to be decisive with every mother who values her influence over her  child. He will very quickly discover, either by information from others or  by his own natural intelligence, that the fairy-tale, that was told him in  reply to a question about a simple matter of fact, was a lie. With that  discovery his mother's influence over him in all such matters vanishes for  ever, for not only has a child a horror of being duped, but he is  extremely sensitive about any rebuff of this kind, and never repeats what  he has been made to feel was a mistake to be ashamed of. He will not  trouble his mother with any more questions on this matter; he will not  confide in her; he will himself learn the art of telling \"fairy-tales\"  about sex matters. He had turned to his mother in trust; she had not  responded with equal trust, and she must suffer the punishment, as  Henriette Fuerth puts it, of seeing \"the love and trust of her son stolen  from her by the first boy he makes friends with in the street.\" When, as  sometimes happens (Moll mentions a case), a mother goes on repeating these  silly stories to a girl or boy of seven who is secretly well-informed, she  only degrades herself in her child's eyes. It is this fatal mistake, so  often made by mothers, which at first leads them to imagine that their  children are so innocent, and in later years causes them many hours of  bitterness because they realize they do not possess their children's  trust. In the matter of trust it is for the mother to take the first step;  the children who do not trust their mothers are, for the most part, merely  remembering the lesson they learned at their mother's knee.        The number of little books and pamphlets dealing with the      question of the sexual enlightenment of the young--whether      intended to be read by the young or offering guidance to mothers      and teachers in the task of imparting knowledge--has become very      large indeed during recent years in America, England, and      especially Germany, where there has been of late an enormous      production of such literature. The late Ben Elmy, writing under      the pseudonym of \"Ellis Ethelmer,\" published two booklets, _Baby      Buds_, and _The Human Flower_ (issued by Mrs. Wolstenholme Elmy,      Buxton House, Congleton), which state the facts in a simple and      delicate manner, though the author was not a notably reliable      guide on the scientific aspects of these questions. A charming      conversation between a mother and child, from a French source, is      reprinted by Edward Carpenter at the end of his _Love's Coming of  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13618"],[0,"The Cathedral Church of Peterborough (#17)"],[1,"descriptions.  In the New Building is the mutilated monument to Sir Humfrey Orme: no  names or dates remain; at the top are the words _Sanguis Iesu Christi  purgat nos ab omnibus Peccatis nostris_. Near this is an elaborate  erection to Thomas Deacon, 1721, a great benefactor to the town. On a  stone to John Brimble, organist of S. John's College, Cambridge, 1670,  we read that he was _Musis et musicae devotissimus, ad coelestem evectus  Academiam_. Among many inscriptions some interesting items will be  found. John Benson, 1827, was the \"oldest Committee Clerk at the House  of Commons.\" Humfrey Orme, 1670, was _A supremo Ang'iae senatu ad  superiorem sanctorum conventum evocatus._ On the memorial to Bishop  Madan, 1813, are the lines:--        In sacred sleep the pious Bishop lies,      Say not in death--A good Man never dies.    [Illustration: South Aisles of Choir and Nave.]    On the tablet to Bishop Cumberland, 1718, are four Latin lines from  Dean Duport's epigram upon the Bishop's confutation of Hobbes. In the  south choir aisle, on the tablet to Dean Lockier, 1740, is the only  instance of the arms of the Deanery impaling another shield, on a  monument. Near this is a wooden tablet executed in good taste, recording  the fact that the iron screens are a memorial to Dean Argles, whose  munificent gifts to the cathedral are well known. The Norman arch at  the west end of this aisle has a modern painted inscription, believed to  be an exact copy of the original:--        _Hos tres Abbates, Quibus est Prior Abba Johannes      Alter Martinus, Andreas Ultimus, unus      Hic claudit Tumulus; pro Clausis ergo rogemus_.    Near this is a tablet to Roger Pemberton, 1695, with a line from Homer  in Greek, \"The race of men is as the race of leaves.\" In the north choir  aisle John Workman, Prebendary, 1685, is described as _Proto-Canonicus_,  probably meaning that he held the first stall. The tablet to Frances  Cosin (d. 1642), wife of the Dean, afterwards Bishop of Durham, was not  erected till after the Bishop's death in 1672. He prescribed in his will  the words of the inscription. On the large tablet above the piscina is a  punning motto, _Temperantia te Temperatrice_, the person commemorated  being Richard Tryce, 1767.    Two tablets of interest in connexion with the Great War are to be seen  in the south aisle of the nave, one in marble to Nurse Cavell, and the  other in bronze to the \"lonely Anzac,\" Thomas Hunter, an Australian who  died in Peterborough from wounds received in France.    Last of all we must speak of the one memorial which is usually looked at  first, the famous picture of Old Scarlett, on the wall of the western  transept. He is represented with a spade, pickaxe, keys, and a whip in  his leathern girdle; at his feet is a skull. At the top of the picture  are the arms of the cathedral. Beneath the portrait are these lines:--        YOV SEE OLD SCARLEITS PICTVRE STAND ON HIE      BVT AT YOVR FEETE THERE DOTH HIS BODY LYE      HIS GRAVESTONE DOTH HIS AGE AND DEATH TIME SHOW      HIS OFFICE BY THEIS TOKENS YOV MAY KNOW      SECOND TO NONE FOR STRENGTH AND STVRDYE LIMM      A SCARBABE MIGHTY VOICE WITH VISAGE GRIM      HEE HAD INTER'D TWO QVEENES WITHIN THIS PLACE      AND THIS TOWNES HOVSEHOLDERS IN HIS LIVES SPACE      TWICE OVER: BVT AT LENGTH HIS ONE TVRNE CAME      WHAT HEE FOR OTHERS DID FOR HIM THE SAME      WAS DONE: NO DOVBT HIS SOVL DOTH LIVE FOR AYE      IN HEAVEN: THOVGH HERE HIS BODY CLAD IN CLAY.    On the floor is a stone inscribed: \"Ivly 2 1594 R S aetatis 98.\" This  painting is not a contemporary portrait, but a copy made in 1747. In  1866 it was sent on loan to the South Kensington Museum.    [Illustration: South Side of the Close, 1801.]          CHAPTER IV.    THE MINSTER PRECINCTS AND CITY.      There are many objects of great interest to be seen in the Minster Yard.  This name is not unfrequently given to the whole of the territory  belonging to the Dean and Chapter surrounding the church. The correct  title is, however, as given above, the Minster Precincts; and it is by  this name that the parish is described, for the Abbey Church, like a few  others, is a parish church, as well as the Cathedral of the diocese.  Although without churchwardens, this parish still appoints its own  overseers of the poor. Old residents distinguish the Close from the  Precincts, limiting the use of the former expression to the area west of  the Cathedral. Contrary to what all would expect, the great gateway to  the west is not the boundary of the Precincts, for they extend a little  further west, and include one or two houses beyond the gateway.    This ancient entrance to the monastic grounds naturally first arrests  the attention. It was built by Abbot Benedict in the last quarter of the  twelfth century. Though it has been much altered, a considerable part of  the original structure remains. As we see it from the Marketplace we  observe a fifteenth century look about it: on closer inspection we see  that a late Decorated arch has been built in front of the Norman arch,  and that a facing of the same date has been carried above. Here is an  arcade, with the alternate panels pierced for windows. On each side of  the gateway are also good Norman arcades; the doorway in the arcade to  the north opens into a residence, that on the south gives access to the  room above. This was originally the Chapel of S. Nicolas. On the  eastern side of the room is a three-light window, manifestly a late  insertion, and adapted from some other building. It is said to be part  of a shrine which formerly was in the Cathedral, a portion of which  still remains in the new building. This statement has been repeated over  and over again; but it is difficult to see any resemblance between the  two.    The chapel over the gateway has been put to various uses since the  dissolution of monasteries. In 1617 it was assigned to the porter as  part of his residence. At a later period it was let. It has served the  purposes of a muniment room, a Masonic lodge room, a tailor's workshop,  a practising room for the choristers, a class-room for the Grammar  School. In the flourishing days of the Gentlemen's Society, when members  met and read papers, and kept up a considerable literary correspondence  with learned men in various parts of the kingdom, its meetings were held  here; and it is now used as a Record Room for the Diocese of  Peterborough.    On the left hand, as we pass through the gate, is all that remains of  the =Chapel of S. Thomas of Canterbury=. It is the chancel of a much  larger building. Originally the chapel was begun by Waterville and  finished by Benedict: it was therefore of Norman date. The present  chancel was built in the latter part of the fourteenth century. While  the east window, with its graceful net tracery and very elegant cross  above, might suggest an earlier date, yet a glance at the side windows,  which are distinctly of transitional character, tells us that 1360 or  1370 may be assigned as the period of erection. About 1404 the abbey  gave the materials of the nave of this chapel to the town, to assist in  rebuilding the parish church on the present site; but the chancel had  been too recently built to be removed. Since the establishment of the  Cathedral the chancel seems always to have been used as the Cathedral  Grammar School, until the year 1885, when the School was removed to new  buildings in the Park Road. It was next used as a museum by the Natural  History and Archaeological Society, until their collection outgrew the  room and they removed to larger premises in Queen Street (see p. 111).  For a time it was a Needlework School of Art, and now it is a Rovers Den  in connexion with the Scout movement.    All the other ancient buildings on the west, the Plumber's Office, the  Sister House, the Treasurer's Office, have long disappeared. The Minster  Almshouses, adjoining the wall of the Deanery garden, are the only  buildings on the north side. They have no ancient features.    [Illustration: Cathedral Gateway, 1791.]    The door immediately to the right of the great gateway as we enter the  close leads to a vaulted chamber which was once the gaol. A few steps  bring us to a very magnificent gateway, leading to the Palace grounds,  over which is a chamber, called the =Knights' Chamber=. This is of Early  English date, with a fine groined roof. The gates and postern are placed  at some distance from the outer archway, adding greatly to the dignity  and effect of the whole composition. The delicate arcading of the sides,  and the excellent clustered shafts, are good examples of the period:  unfortunately the bases of the shafts are now hidden by accumulation of  earth. On the north and south faces are long niches with figures: three  on the north are said to be King Edward II., and the Abbot and Prior of  the period; those on the south are Apostles. The chamber above is used  for meetings, etc.    Much of the line of buildings to the east of this gateway is modern, but  it harmonizes excellently with the ancient work. Near the Cathedral is  some mediaeval work, and the office at the end, on the ground floor,  has a good stone groined roof. This is believed to have been the  Penitentiary.    The _Deanery Gateway_, at the north-eastern corner of the close is a  fine specimen of architecture. In the spandrels above the great  four-centred arch are two coats of arms, one with the keys and  crosslets, the other with swords and crosses. These are now the arms of  the See and the Cathedral respectively: but it is difficult to say what  was their special significance when this gate was erected. Are we to  suppose that the Abbot and Prior used different armorial bearings before  the Reformation? Above the smaller door is a boldly carved rebus of the  Abbot in whose time the gate was erected, a church on a tun, Robert  Kirton (Kirkton). His initials in stone are also carved beneath the  parapet."]]]
