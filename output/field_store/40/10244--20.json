Side by side with these inflected forms are found comparative  and superlative expressions making use of the adverbs more and  most. These are often useful as alternative with the inflected  forms, but in most cases are used before adjectives that are never  inflected.    They came into use about the thirteenth century, but were not common  until a century later.      [Sidenote: _Which rule_,-- -er _and_ -est _or_ more _and_ most?]    161. The English is somewhat capricious in choosing between the  inflected forms and those with _more_ and _most_, so that no  inflexible rule can be given as to the formation of the comparative  and the superlative.    The general rule is, that monosyllables and easily pronounced words of  two syllables add _-er_ and _-est_; and other words are preceded by  _more_ and _most_.    But room must be left in such a rule for pleasantness of sound and for  variety of expression.    To see how literary English overrides any rule that could be given,  examine the following taken at random:--    From Thackeray: \"The _handsomest_ wives;\" \"the _immensest_ quantity of  thrashing;\" \"the _wonderfulest_ little shoes;\" \"_more odd, strange_,  and yet familiar;\" \"_more austere_ and _holy_.\"    From Ruskin: \"The sharpest, finest chiseling, and _patientest_  fusing;\" \"_distantest_ relationships;\" \"_sorrowfulest_ spectacles.\"    Carlyle uses _beautifulest_, _mournfulest_, _honestest_,  _admirablest_, _indisputablest_, _peaceablest_, _most small_, etc.    These long, harsh forms are usually avoided, but _more_ and _most_ are  frequently used with monosyllables.      162. Expressions are often met with in which a superlative form does  not carry the superlative meaning. These are equivalent usually to  _very_ with the positive degree; as,--         To this the Count offers a _most wordy_ declaration of the       benefits conferred by Spain.--_The Nation_, No 1507         In all formulas that Johnson could stand by, there needed to be a       _most genuine_ substance.--CARLYLE         A gentleman, who, though born in no very high degree, was _most       finished_, _polished_, _witty_, _easy_, _quiet_.--THACKERAY         He had actually nothing else save a rope around his neck, which       hung behind in the _queerest_ way.--_Id._         \"So help me God, madam, I will,\" said Henry Esmond, falling on       his knees, and kissing the hand of his _dearest_ mistress.--_Id._      [Sidenote: _Adjectives irregularly compared._]    163. Among the variously derived adjectives now in our language  there are some which may always be recognized as native English. These  are adjectives irregularly compared.    Most of them have worn down or become confused with similar words, but  they are essentially the same forms that have lived for so many  centuries.    The following lists include the majority of them:--        LIST I.      1.  Good or well      Better             Best    2.  Evil, bad, ill    Worse              Worst    3.  Little            Less, lesser       Least    4.  Much or many      More               Most    5.  Old               Elder, older       Eldest, oldest    6.  Nigh              Nigher             Nighest, next    7.  Near              Nearer             Nearest    8.  Far               Farther, further   Farthest, furthest    9.  Late              Later, latter      Latest, last    10. Hind              Hinder             Hindmost, hindermost        LIST II.      These have no adjective positive:--      1. [In]    Inner          Inmost, innermost    2. [Out]   Outer, utter  {Outmost, outermost                             {Utmost, uttermost    3. [Up]    Upper          Upmost, uppermost        LIST III.      A few of comparative form but not comparative meaning:--           After      Over      Under      Nether    Remarks on Irregular Adjectives.      [Sidenote: _List I._]    164. (1) The word good has no comparative or superlative, but takes  the place of a positive to _better_ and _best_. There was an old  comparative _bet_, which has gone out of use; as in the sentence (14th  century), \"Ich singe _bet_ than thu dest\" (I sing better than thou  dost). The superlative I form was _betst_, which has softened to the  modern _best_.    (2) In Old English, evil was the positive to _worse_, _worst_; but  later _bad_ and _ill_ were borrowed from the Norse, and used as  positives to the same comparative and superlative. _Worser_ was once  used, a double comparative; as in Shakespeare,--         O, throw away the _worser_ part of it.--HAMLET.    (3) Little is used as positive to _less_, _least_, though from a  different root. A double comparative, _lesser_, is often used; as,--         We have it in a much _lesser_ degree.--MATTHEW ARNOLD.         Thrust the _lesser_ half by main force into the fists of Ho-ti.       --LAMB.    (4) The words much and many now express quantity; but in former  times _much_ was used in the sense of _large_, _great_, and was the  same word that is found in the proverb, \"Many a little makes _a  mickle_.\" Its spelling has been _micel_, _muchel_, _moche_, _much_,  the parallel form _mickle_ being rarely used.    The meanings _greater_, _greatest_, are shown in such phrases as,--         The _more_ part being of one mind, to England we       sailed.--KINGSLEY.         The _most_ part kept a stolid indifference.--_Id._    The latter, meaning _the largest part_, is quite common.    (5) The forms elder, eldest, are earlier than _older_, _oldest_. A  few other words with the vowel _o_ had similar change in the  comparative and superlative, as _long_, _strong_, etc.; but these have  followed _old_ by keeping the same vowel _o_ in all the forms, instead  of _lenger_, _strenger_, etc., the old forms.    (6) and (7) Both nigh and near seem regular in Modern English,  except the form _next_; but originally the comparison was _nigh_,  _near_, _next_. In the same way the word high had in Middle English  the superlative _hexte_.    By and by the comparative _near_ was regarded as a positive form, and  on it were built a double comparative _nearer_, and the superlative  _nearest_, which adds _-est_ to what is really a comparative instead  of a simple adjective.    (8) These words also show confusion and consequent modification,  coming about as follows: further really belongs to another  series,--_forth_, _further_, _first_. First became entirely  detached from the series, and _furthest_ began to be used to follow  the comparative _further_; then these were used as comparative and  superlative of _far_.    The word far had formerly the comparative and superlative _farrer_,  _farrest_. In imitation of _further_, _furthest_, _th_ came into the  others, making the modern _farther_, _farthest_. Between the two sets  as they now stand, there is scarcely any distinction, except perhaps  _further_ is more used than _farther_ in the sense of _additional_;  as, for example,--         When that evil principle was left with no _further_ material to       support it.--HAWTHORNE.    (9) Latter and last are the older forms. Since _later_, _latest_,  came into use, a distinction has grown up between the two series.  _Later_ and _latest_ have the true comparative and superlative force,  and refer to time; _latter_ and _last_ are used in speaking of  succession, or series, and are hardly thought of as connected in  meaning with the word _late_.    (10) Hinder is comparative in form, but not in meaning. The form  _hindmost_ is really a double superlative, since the _m_ is for _-ma_,  an old superlative ending, to which is added _-ost_, doubling the  inflection. _Hind-er-m-ost_ presents the combination comparative +  superlative + superlative.      [Sidenote: _List II._]    165. In List II. (Sec. 163) the comparatives and superlatives are  adjectives, but they have no adjective positives.    The comparatives are so in form, but not in their meaning.    The superlatives show examples again of double inflection, and of  comparative added to double-superlative inflection.    Examples (from Carlyle) of the use of these adjectives: \"revealing the  _inner_ splendor to him;\" \"a mind that has penetrated into the  _inmost_ heart of a thing;\" \"This of painting is one of the  _outermost_ developments of a man;\" \"The _outer_ is of the day;\"  \"far-seeing as the sun, the _upper_ light of the world;\" \"the  _innermost_ moral soul;\" \"their _utmost_ exertion.\"      [Sidenote: -Most _added to other words_.]    166. The ending _-most_ is added to some words that are not usually  adjectives, or have no comparative forms.         There, on the very _topmost_ twig, sits that ridiculous but       sweet-singing bobolink.--H.W. BEECHER.         Decidedly handsome, having such a skin as became a young woman of       family in _northernmost_ Spain.--DE QUINCEY.         Highest and _midmost_, was descried The royal banner floating       wide.--SCOTT.      [Sidenote: _List III._]    167. The adjectives in List III. are like the comparative forms in  List II. in having no adjective positives. They have no superlatives,  and have no comparative force, being merely descriptive.         Her bows were deep in the water, but her _after_ deck was still       dry.--KINGSLEY.         Her, by the by, in _after_ years I vainly endeavored to       trace.--DE QUINCEY.         The upper and the _under_ side of the medal of Jove.--EMERSON.         Have you ever considered what a deep _under_ meaning there lies       in our custom of strewing flowers?--RUSKIN.         Perhaps he rose out of some _nether_ region.--HAWTHORNE.    _Over_ is rarely used separately as an adjective.        CAUTION FOR ANALYZING OR PARSING.

Schneider seemed to realize this too, for he redoubled his efforts  to escape and finally succeeded in rolling over on top of the ape-man  and breaking away. Leaping to his feet he ran for the window; but  the ape-man was too quick for him and before he could leap through  the sash a heavy hand fell upon his shoulder and he was jerked  back and hurled across the room to the opposite wall. There Tarzan  followed him, and once again they locked, dealing each other terrific  blows, until Schneider in a piercing voice screamed, \"Kamerad!  Kamerad!\"    Tarzan grasped the man by the throat and drew his hunting knife.  Schneider's back was against the wall so that though his knees  wobbled he was held erect by the ape-man. Tarzan brought the sharp  point to the lower part of the German's abdomen.    \"Thus you slew my mate,\" he hissed in a terrible voice.  \"Thus  shall you die!\"    The girl staggered forward. \"Oh, God, no!\" she cried.  \"Not that.  You are too brave--you cannot be such a beast as that!\"    Tarzan turned at her. \"No,\" he said, \"you are right, I cannot do  it--I am no German,\" and he raised the point of his blade and sunk  it deep into the putrid heart of Hauptmann Fritz Schneider, putting  a bloody period to the Hun's last gasping cry: \"I did not do it!  She is not--\"    Then Tarzan turned toward the girl and held out his hand.  \"Give  me my locket,\" he said.    She pointed toward the dead officer. \"He has it.\" Tarzan searched  him and found the trinket. \"Now you may give me the papers,\" he said  to the girl, and without a word she handed him a folded document.    For a long time he stood looking at her before ho spoke again.    \"I came for you, too,\" he said. \"It would be difficult to take you  back from here and so I was going to kill you, as I have sworn to  kill all your kind; but you were right when you said that I was  not such a beast as that slayer of women. I could not slay him as  he slew mine, nor can I slay you, who are a woman.\"    He crossed to the window, raised the sash and an instant later he  had stepped out and disappeared into the night. And then Fraulein  Bertha Kircher stepped quickly to the corpse upon the floor, slipped  her hand inside the blouse and drew forth a little sheaf of papers  which she tucked into her waist before she went to the window and  called for help.          Chapter VII    When Blood Told      Tarzan of the Apes was disgusted. He had had the German spy, Bertha  Kircher, in his power and had left her unscathed. It is true that he  had slain Hauptmann Fritz Schneider, that Underlieutenant von Goss  had died at his hands, and that he had otherwise wreaked vengeance  upon the men of the German company who had murdered, pillaged, and  raped at Tarzan's bungalow in the Waziri country. There was still  another officer to be accounted for, but him he could not find.  It was Lieutenant Obergatz he still sought, though vainly, for at  last he learned that the man had been sent upon some special mission,  whether in Africa or back to Europe Tarzan's informant either did  not know or would not divulge.    But the fact that he had permitted sentiment to stay his hand when  he might so easily have put Bertha Kircher out of the way in the  hotel at Wilhelmstal that night rankled in the ape-man's bosom.  He was shamed by his weakness, and when he had handed the paper  she had given him to the British chief of staff, even though  the information it contained permitted the British to frustrate a  German flank attack, he was still much dissatisfied with himself.  And possibly the root of this dissatisfaction lay in the fact that  he realized that were he again to have the same opportunity he  would still find it as impossible to slay a woman as it had been  in Wilhelmstal that night.    Tarzan blamed this weakness, as he considered it, upon his association  with the effeminizing influences of civilization, for in the bottom  of his savage heart he held in contempt both civilization and its  representatives--the men and women of the civilized countries of  the world. Always was he comparing their weaknesses, their vices,  their hypocrisies, and their little vanities with the open,  primitive ways of his ferocious jungle mates, and all the while  there battled in that same big heart with these forces another mighty  force--Tarzan's love and loyalty for his friends of the civilized  world.    The ape-man, reared as he had been by savage beasts amid savage  beasts, was slow to make friends. Acquaintances he numbered by the  hundreds; but of friends he had few. These few he would have died  for as, doubtless, they would have died for him; but there were  none of these fighting with the British forces in East Africa, and  so, sickened and disgusted by the sight of man waging his cruel  and inhuman warfare, Tarzan determined to heed the insistent call  of the remote jungle of his youth, for the Germans were now on the  run and the war in East Africa was so nearly over that he realized  that his further services would be of negligible value.    Never regularly sworn into the service of the King, he was under  no obligation to remain now that the moral obligation had been  removed, and so it was that he disappeared from the British camp  as mysteriously as he had appeared a few months before.    More than once had Tarzan reverted to the primitive only to return  again to civilization through love for his mate; but now that she  was gone he felt that this time he had definitely departed forever  from the haunts of man, and that he should live and die a beast  among beasts even as he had been from infancy to maturity.    Between him and his destination lay a trackless wilderness of untouched  primeval savagery where, doubtless in many spots, his would be the  first human foot to touch the virgin turf. Nor did this prospect  dismay the Tarmangani--rather was it an urge and an inducement, for  rich in his veins flowed that noble strain of blood that has made  most of the earth's surface habitable for man.    The question of food and water that would have risen paramount in  the mind of an ordinary man contemplating such an excursion gave  Tarzan little concern. The wilderness was his natural habitat  and woodcraft as inherent to him as breathing. Like other jungle  animals he could scent water from a great distance and, where you  or I might die of thirst, the ape-man would unerringly select the  exact spot at which to dig and find water.    For several days Tarzan traversed a country rich in game  and watercourses. He moved slowly, hunting and fishing, or again  fraternizing or quarreling with the other savage denizens of  the jungle. Now it was little Manu, the monkey, who chattered and  scolded at the mighty Tarmangani and in the next breath warned him  that Histah, the snake, lay coiled in the long grass just ahead.  Of Manu Tarzan inquired concerning the great apes--the Mangani--and  was told that few inhabited this part of the jungle, and that even  these were hunting farther to the north this season of the year.    \"But there is Bolgani,\" said Manu. \"Would you like to see Bolgani?\"    Manu's tone was sneering, and Tarzan knew that it was because little  Manu thought all creatures feared mighty Bolgani, the gorilla.  Tarzan arched his great chest and struck it with a clinched fist.  \"I am Tarzan,\" he cried. \"While Tarzan was yet a balu he slew a  Bolgani. Tarzan seeks the Mangani, who are his brothers, but Bolgani  he does not seek, so let Bolgani keep from the path of Tarzan.\"    Little Manu, the monkey, was much impressed, for the way of the  jungle is to boast and to believe. It was then that he condescended  to tell Tarzan more of the Mangani.    \"They go there and there and there,\" he said, making a wide sweep  with a brown hand first toward the north, then west, and then south  again. \"For there,\" and he pointed due west, \"is much hunting; but  between lies a great place where there is no food and no water,  so they must go that way,\" and again he swung his hand through the  half-circle that explained to Tarzan the great detour the apes made  to come to their hunting ground to the west.    That was all right for the Mangani, who are lazy and do not care to  move rapidly; but for Tarzan the straight road would be the best.  He would cross the dry country and come to the good hunting in a third  of the time that it would take to go far to the north and circle  back again. And so it was that he continued on toward the west, and  crossing a range of low mountains came in sight of a broad plateau,  rock strewn and desolate. Far in the distance he saw another range  of mountains beyond which he felt must lie the hunting ground of  the Mangani. There he would join them and remain for a while before  continuing on toward the coast and the little cabin that his father  had built beside the land-locked harbor at the jungle's edge.    Tarzan was full of plans. He would rebuild and enlarge the cabin  of his birth, constructing storage houses where he would make the  apes lay away food when it was plenty against the times that were  lean--a thing no ape ever had dreamed of doing. And the tribe would  remain always in the locality and he would be king again as he had  in the past. He would try to teach them some of the better things  that he had learned from man, yet knowing the ape-mind as only  Tarzan could, he feared that his labors would be for naught.    The ape-man found the country he was crossing rough in the extreme,  the roughest he ever had encountered. The plateau was cut by frequent  canyons the passage of which often entailed hours of wearing effort.  The vegetation was sparse and of a faded brown color that lent to  the whole landscape a most depressing aspect. Great rocks were strewn  in every direction as far as the eye could see, lying partially  embedded"]]]
