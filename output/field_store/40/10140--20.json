But Sahwah had no intentions of being put out on that score. She applied  herself assiduously to the making of the notebook that was required as  the resume of the half year's work. She finished it a whole day ahead of  time, and then, Sahwah-like, was so pleased with herself that she  decided to celebrate the event. \"Come over to the house to-night,\" she  said to various of her girl and boy friends in school that day. \"I'm  entertaining in honor of my Physics notebook!\"    When the guests arrived the notebook was enthroned on a gilded easel on  the parlor table and decorated with a wreath of flowers and a card  bearing the inscription \"Endlich!\" The very ridiculousness of the whole  affair was enough to make every one have a good time. The Winnebagos  were there, and some of their brothers and cousins, and Dick Albright  and Joe Lanning and several more boys from the class. Naturally much of  the conversation turned on the coming game, and Sahwah was solemnly  assured that she would forfeit their friendship forever if she did not  win the championship for the school. School spirit ran high and songs  and yells were practiced until the neighbors groaned. Joe Lanning joined  in the yells with as much vigor as any. No one knew that he was secretly  on the side of the Mechanicals.    Sahwah's notebook came in for inspection and much admiration, for she  was good at Physics and her drawings were to be envied. \"I see you have  a list of all the problems the class has done this year,\" said Dick  Albright, looking through the notebook. \"Do you mind if I copy them from  your list? I lost the one Fizzy gave us in class and it'll take me all  night to pick them out from the ones in the book.\"    \"Certainly, you may,\" said Sahwah cordially. \"Take it along with you and  bring it to school in the morning. It'll be all right as long as I get  it in by that time. But don't forget it, whatever you do, unless you  want to see me put out of the game.\" Joe Lanning wished fervently that  Dick would forget to bring it. The party broke up and the boys and girls  prepared to depart.    \"What car do you take, Dick?\" asked one of the boys.    \"I don't think I'll take any,\" said Dick. \"I'll just run around the  corner with this lady,\" he said, indicating Migwan, \"and then I'll walk  the rest of the way.\"    \"Isn't it pretty far?\" asked some one else.    \"Not the way I go,\" answered Dick. \"I take the short cut through the  railway tunnel.\" Joe Lanning's eyes gleamed suddenly.    The good-nights were all said and Sahwah shut the door and set the  furniture straight before she went to bed. \"Didn't your friends stay  rather late?\" asked her mother from upstairs.    \"No,\" said Sahwah, \"I don't think so, it's only--why, the clock has  stopped,\" she finished after a look at the mantel, \"I don't know what  time it is.\"    \"Get the time from the telephone operator,\" said her mother, \"and set  the clock.\"    Sahwah picked up the receiver. There was a strange buzzing noise on the  wire. \"Zig-a-zig, ziz-zig-zig-a-zig, zig-g-g, zig-g-g, zig-g-g-g.\"  Puzzled at first, she soon recognized what it was. It was the sound of  Joe Lanning's wireless. Joe lived directly back of Sahwah on the next  street, and the aerial of his wireless apparatus was fastened to the  telephone pole in the Brewsters' yard. Joe was \"sending,\" and the  vibrations were being picked up by the telephone wires and carried to  her ear when she had the receiver down. Sahwah understood the wireless  code the boys used, and, in fact, had both sent and received messages.  She knew it was Joe's custom to listen for the time every night as it  was flashed out from the station at Arlington, and then send it to his  friend Abraham Goldstein, a young Jewish lad in the class, who also had  a wireless. Then the two would send each other messages and verify them  the next day. \"Oh, what fun,\" thought Sahwah; \"I can get Arlington time  to-night.\" She asked the operator to look up a new number for her to  keep her off the line and then got out paper and pencil to take down the  message as it went out. As she deciphered it she gasped in astonishment.  She had expected a message something on this order: \"Hello, Abraham--how  are you?--Arlington says ten bells--How's the weather in your neck of  the woods?\" Instead the words were entirely different. She could not  believe her eyes as she made them out. \"Albright going through railway  tunnel--hold him up--get notebook away--keep Brewster out of game.\" Her  senses reeled as she understood the meaning of the message. That Joe was  plotting against her when he pretended to be a friend cut her to the  quick. For a moment her lip quivered; then her nature asserted itself.  There was a thing to do and she must do it. Dick must be kept from going  through the tunnel. Turning out the lights downstairs, she crept  noiselessly out of the house, found her brother's bicycle on the porch  and pedaled off after Dick. She knew exactly the way he would take. From  Migwan's house he would go up Adams to Locust Street and from there to  ----th Avenue, and keep on going until he came to the dark tunnel.  Sahwah nearly burst with indignation when she thought of Joe's cowardly  conduct. He was calmly getting Abraham to do the dirty work for him, so  he would never be suspected of having anything to do with it in case  Dick recognized Abraham. She could see how the thing would work out.  Abraham lived just the other side of the tunnel. All he would have to do  would be to stand in the shadow of the tunnel, jump out on Dick as he  came through, seize the notebook from his hand, and run away before Dick  knew what had happened. There would be no need of fighting or hurting  him. But Joe's end would be accomplished and Washington would lose the  game. The fact that he was a traitor to the school hurt Sahwah ten times  worse than the injury he was trying to do her. \"Even if his cousin _is_  on the other side, he belongs to Washington,\" she repeated over and over  to herself.    Down Locust Street she flew and along deserted ----th Avenue. It was  bitterly cold riding, but she took no notice. Far ahead of her she could  see Dick walking briskly toward the fatal tunnel. Pedaling for dear life  she caught up with him when he was still some distance from it.  \"Whatever is the matter?\" he asked, startled, as she flung herself  breathless from the wheel beside him.    \"The notebook,\" she said. \"Joe's trying to get it away from you. He's  got Abraham Goldstein waiting in the tunnel to snatch it as you go by.\"    Dick gave vent to a long whistle of astonishment. \"Of all the underhand  tricks!\" he exclaimed when the full significance of Joe's act was borne  in on him. He was stupefied to think that Joe was a traitor to the  school. \"That'll fix his chances of getting into the _Thessalonians_,\"  he said vehemently. \"His name is coming up next week to be voted on.  Just wait until I tell what I know about him!\"    Dick retraced his steps and took Sahwah home, where he left the precious  notebook in her keeping to prevent any possibility of its getting lost  before she could hand it in, and then took the streetcar and rode home  the roundabout way, arriving there in safety. Abraham waited out in the  cold tunnel for several hours and then gave it up and went home, feeling  decidedly out of temper with Joe Lanning and his intrigues.    The game was held in the Washington High gymnasium. The gallery and all  available floor space were packed long before the commencement of the  game. The Carnegie Mechanics came out in a body to witness their team  win the championship. Joe Lanning was there, entirely composed, though  inwardly raging at the failure of his trick, which he attributed to  Dick's changing his mind about walking home, never dreaming that Sahwah  had intercepted his message and his treachery was known. Although his  sympathies were with the Mechanicals he stood with the Washingtons and  yelled their yells as loudly as any. The Mechanicals, as the visiting,  team, came out on the floor first and had the first practice. They were  fine looking girls, every one of them, with their dazzling white middies  and blue ties. They were greeted with a ringing cheer from their  rooters:      \"_Me_-chan-i,    _Me_-chan-i,    _Me_-chan-i-can-can,    _Me_-chan-i-can-can,    Me-chan-i-cals!\"    Marie Lanning held up her head and looked self-conscious when she heard  the familiar yell thundered at the team. It was meant mostly for  herself, she was sure. She smiled proudly and graciously in the  direction whence the yell had proceeded. Quiet had hardly fallen on the  crowd when there was heard the sound of singing from the upper end of  the gymnasium where the door to the dressing rooms was. The tune was  \"Old Black Joe\":      \"We're coming, we're coming,    Star players, every one,    We're going to win the championship    For Washington!\"    Washington's rooters caught up the yell and made the roof ring. Sahwah's  heart swelled when she heard it, not with the feeling that they were  singing to her, but with pride because she belonged to a team which  called out this expression of loyalty. Then came individual cheers, with  her name at the head of the list.      \"One, two, _three_, four,    Who are _we_ for?    BREWSTER!\"    Not even then was Sahwah puffed up.

But one method of supporting and insulating the conductor in  the channel may be suggested by an illustration of the plan I adopted for a  little pleasure line in the Winter Gardens, Blackpool.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.]    Fig. 7. There the track being exclusively for the electric railway, it was  not necessary to provide a center channel; the conductor has therefore been  placed in the center of the track, and consists of bar iron 11/4 in. by 1/2  in., and is held vertically by means of studs riveted into the side; these  studs pass through porcelain insulators, and by means of wooden clamps and  wedges are held in the iron chairs which rest upon the sleepers. The iron  conductors were placed vertically to facilitate bending round the sharp  curves which were unavoidable on this line.    The collector consists of two metal slippers held together by springs,  attached to the car by straps and electrically connected to the motor by  clips in the same manner as the one employed in Manchester.    I am glad to say that, notwithstanding the curves with a radius of 55 feet  and gradients of 1 in 57, this line is also a practical success.           *       *       *       *       *          FIRES IN LONDON AND NEW YORK.      When the chief of the London Fire Brigade visited the United States in  1882, he was, as is the general rule on the other side of the Atlantic,  \"interviewed\"--a custom, it may be remarked, which appears to be gaining  ground also in this country. The inferences drawn from these interviews  seem to be that the absence of large fires in London was chiefly due to the  superiority of our fire brigade, and that the greater frequency of  conflagrations in American cities, and particularly in New York, was due to  the inferiority of their fire departments. How unjust such a comparison  would be is shown in a paper presented by Mr. Edward B. Dorsey, a member  of the American Society of Civil Engineers, to that association, in which  the author discusses the comparative liability to and danger from  conflagrations in London and in American cities. He found from an  investigation which he conducted with much care during a visit to London  that it is undoubtedly true that large fires are much less frequent in the  metropolis than in American cities; but it is equally true that the  circumstances existing in London and New York are quite different. As it is  a well-known fact that the promptness, efficiency, and bravery of American  firemen cannot be surpassed, we gladly give prominence to the result of the  author's investigations into the true causes of the great liability of  American cities to large fires. In a highly interesting comparison the  writer has selected New York and London as typical cities, although his  observations will apply to most American and English towns, if, perhaps,  with not quite the same force. In the first place, the efforts of the  London Fire Brigade receive much aid from our peculiarly damp climate. From  the average of eleven years (1871-1881) of the meteorological observations  made at the Greenwich Observatory, it appears that in London it rains, on  the average, more than three days in the week, that the sun shines only  one-fourth of the time he is above the horizon, and that the atmosphere  only lacks 18 per cent. of complete saturation, and is cloudy seven-tenths  of the time. Moreover, the humidity of the atmosphere in London is very  uniform, varying but little in the different months. Under these  circumstances, wood will not be ignited very easily by sparks or by contact  with a weak flame. This is very different from the condition of wood in the  long, hot, dry seasons of the American continent. The average temperature  for the three winter months in London is 38.24 degrees Fahr.; in New York  it is 31.56 degrees, or 6.68 degrees lower. This lower range of temperature  must be the cause of many conflagrations, for, to make up for the  deficiency in the natural temperature, there must be in New York many more  and larger domestic fires. The following statistics, taken from the records  of the New York Fire Department, show this. In the three winter months of  1881, January, February, and December, there were 522 fire alarms in New  York, or an average per month of 174; in the remaining nine months 1,263,  or an average per month of 140. In the corresponding three winter months of  1882 there were 602 fire alarms, or an average per month of 201; in the  remaining nine months 1,401, or an average per month of 155. In round  numbers there were in 1881 one-fourth, and in 1882 one-third more fire  alarms in the three winter months than in the nine warmer months. We are  not aware that similar statistics have ever been compiled for London, and  are consequently unable to draw comparison; but, speaking from  recollection, fires appear to be more frequent also in London during the  winter months.    Another cause of the greater frequency of fires in New York and their more  destructive nature is the greater density of population in that city. The  London Metropolitan Police District covers 690 square miles, extending 12  to 15 miles in every direction from Charing Cross, and contained in 1881 a  population of 4,764,312; but what is generally known as London covers 122  square miles, containing, in 1881, 528,794 houses, and a population of  3,814,574, averaging 7.21 persons per house, 49 per acre, and 31,267 per  square mile. Now let us look at New York. South of Fortieth Street between  the Hudson and East Rivers, New York has an area of 3,905 acres, a fraction  over six square miles, exclusive of piers, and contained, according to the  census of 1880, a population of 813,076. This gives 208 persons per acre.  The census of 1880 reports the total number of dwellings in New York at  73,684; total population, 1,206,299; average per dwelling, 16.37. Selecting  for comparison an area about equal from the fifteen most densely populated  districts or parishes of London, of an aggregate area of 3,896 acres, and  with a total population of 746,305, we obtain 191.5 persons per acre. Thus  briefly New York averaged 208 persons per acre, and 16.37 per dwelling;  London, for the same area, 191.5 persons per acre, and 7.21 per house. But  this comparison is scarcely fair, as in London only the most populous and  poorest districts are included, corresponding to the entirely tenement  districts of New York, while in the latter city it includes the richest and  most fashionable sections, as well as the poorest. If tenement districts  were taken alone, the population would be found much more dense, and New  York proportionately much more densely populated. Taking four of the most  thickly populated of the London districts (East London, Strand, Old Street,  St. Luke's, St. Giles-in-the-Fields, and St. George, Bloomsbury), we find  on a total area of 792 acres a population of 197,285, or an average of 249  persons per acre. In four of the most densely populated wards of New York  (10th, 11th, 13th, and 17th), we have on an area of 735 acres a population  of 258,966, or 352 persons per acre. This is 40 per cent. higher than in  London, the districts being about the same size, each containing about  1-1/5 square miles. Apart from the greater crowding which takes place in  New York, and the different style of buildings, another very fertile cause  of the spreading of fires is the freer use of wood in their construction.  It is asserted that in New York there is more than double the quantity of  wood used in buildings per acre than in London. From a house census  undertaken in 1882 by the New York Fire Department, moreover, it appears  that there were 106,885 buildings including sheds, of which 28,798 houses  were built of wood or other inflammable materials, besides 3,803 wooden  sheds, giving a total of 32,601 wooden buildings.    We are not aware that there are any wooden houses left in London. There are  other minor causes which act as checks upon the spreading of fires in  London. London houses are mostly small in size, and fires are thus confined  to a limited space between brick walls. Their walls are generally low and  well braced, which enable the firemen to approach them without danger.  About 60 per cent. of London houses are less than 22 feet high from the  pavement to the eaves; more than half of the remainder are less than 40  feet high, very few being over 50 feet high. This, of course, excludes the  newer buildings in the City. St. James's Palace does not exceed 40 feet,  the Bank of England not over 30 feet in height; but these are exceptional  structures. Fireproof roofings and projecting party walls also retard the  spreading of conflagrations. The houses being comparatively low and small,  the firemen are enabled to throw water easily over them, and to reach their  roofs with short ladders. There is in London an almost universal absence of  wooden additions and outbuildings, and the New York ash barrel or box kept  in the house is also unknown. The local authorities in London keep a strict  watch over the manufacture or storage of combustible materials in populous  parts of the city. Although overhead telegraph wires are multiplying to an  alarming extent in London, their number is nothing to be compared to their  bewildering multitude in New York, where their presence is not only a  hinderance to the operations of the firemen, but a positive danger to their  lives. Finally--and this has already been partly dealt with in speaking of  the comparative density of population of the two cities--a look at the map  of London will show us how the River Thames and the numerous parks,  squares, private grounds, wide streets, as well as the railways running  into London, all act as effectual barriers to the extension of fires.    The recent great conflagrations in the city vividly illustrate"]]]
