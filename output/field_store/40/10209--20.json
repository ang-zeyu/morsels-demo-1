The  vaulting of this transept is not the same in detail as that to the  south of the choir, and is rather earlier in the type of its  mouldings. Close by the south springing of the arch leading to the  library is one of the few pieces of figure-carving in the church. It  is a head full of vigour and character.    The #Monuments in the Transepts and Choir# have been injured and  restored or removed at various times. The large one (14) under the  south window is Langton's tomb and effigy (d. 1336). The new one  nearest to the singing school is a memorial and effigy of Mr. John  Abel Smith, of Dale Park, who represented Chichester in the House of  Commons. On the east wall is another tomb of Tudor date (15), with  niches for sculpture. The tomb next to the back of the choir-stalls  (16) is that of Bishop Richard de la Wych. The two panels in relief  (17), in the south aisle of the choir are works of about the twelfth  century (see page 105). It is supposed that originally they were  brought to Chichester from Selsea. They were discovered in 1829 hidden  in the wall behind the woodwork of the stalls in the choir, and were  subsequently placed in their present position. The subject of the one  nearest to the transept is the \"Raising of Lazarus,\" and of the other,  \"Our Lord with Mary and Martha at Bethany.\" These are two of the most  interesting relics of earlier days that remain in the cathedral.  Historically and artistically, they are of much value, but at present  no more than has been stated is known about them. Bishop Sherborne's  monument (18) was built during his lifetime, and at his death he  provided for its care by New College, of which he had been a fellow.  It is still well cared for; but with its original decorations it must  have been a very beautiful object.    [Illustration: THE NORTH CHOIR AISLE, LOOKING WEST. _S.B. Bolas & Co.,  photo_.]    Dean Hook, who died in 1875, is commemorated by a monument (19)  opposite Sherborne's. It was designed by Sir Gilbert Scott, and, like  the pavements of the choir, it has in its composition many specimens  of coloured marbles. Much of the detail is executed in mosaic. Under  the arch of the presbytery arcade nearest to the reredos, on the south  side, is Bishop Day's tomb (20). On the south side of the  lady-chapel, close to the entrance, are the memorial slabs of two  early bishops, perhaps Hilary and John de Greneford, beneath the arch  where Bishop Gilbert's effigy was placed. On the opposite side is a  space under an arch in which may be traced the lines of some  decoration which once ornamented some memorial. Upon the floor below  is the memorial of Bishop Ralph (21), the builder of the first  portions of the cathedral. Close by is a large wall tablet in memory  of Bishop Thomas Bickley. It is a design of the seventeenth-century  period, and is interesting of its kind. Under the arch on the north  side of the presbytery, opposite Day's tomb, is that of Bishop  Christopherson or Curteys (22), and against the wall of the aisle near  the chapel of S. Catharine is a curious marble slab with some carving  upon it. It represents two hands, with parts of the arms, supporting a  heart, and the full inscription, now almost gone, was \"ICY GIST LE  COEUR DE MAUDDE\" (\"Here lies the heart of Maud\"). It is evidently work  of an early date, but nothing is accurately known of its history,  though it has been assumed that it was made in the twelfth or  thirteenth century (23). To the west of this is a bust of Bishop Otter  (24). In an arched recess in the wall nearer to the library is the  tomb and effigy of Bishop Storey (25). Close to this are two memorials  of the sixteenth century. On the west side of the north transept are  the monuments of Bishops Henry King, Carleton, and Grove.    [Illustration: THE LIBRARY. _S.B. Bolas & Co., photo_.]    The #Stained Glass# in the cathedral is all modern, and most of it  is of the worst possible kind. It is bad in design and crude in  colour, and much of it is not really stained glass at all, but a  painted substitute. The only really good window in the building is  that at the east end of the south choir aisle in S. Mary Magdalen's  chapel. It was designed by Mr. C.E. Kempe. The glass in the  lady-chapel windows is better than most of the rest, and it is  admitted that the worst glass that was ever placed in any cathedral  church by a generous munificence is that which is now in the large  window of the south transept.

To trace the history of the establishment of the city of Chichester we  need go back to the time when the Romans had occupied the same site  under the ancient name of Regnum. They had fortified themselves in  this position, and evidence of their occupation is to be found to-day  in the subdivision of the city into four parts by those streets which  meet at the Market Cross. But as the centre of the Imperial fabric  became weaker the dependencies were abandoned, and the Roman legions  recalled early in the fifth century. So when in 477 A.D. \"came Aelle  to Britain, and his three sons, Cymen, Wlencing, and Cissa, with three  ships,\" and landed at \"the place which is named Cymenesora, and there  slew many Welsh, and drove some into the forest which is named  Andredslea,\" there were no Roman soldiers to oppose them.    In this brief sentence, quoted from the Anglo-Saxon chronicle, there  is a reference to several interesting matters which concern the later  history of the South Saxons, their acceptance of Christianity, and the  foundation of that Church--first at Selsea, then at Chichester--which  was to be the future local centre to support and foster the faith they  for so long rejected. The Jute leaders, Hengest and Horsa, had  established themselves on British soil in 449 A.D. This was  twenty-eight years before Aelle arrived, and with his followers \"slew  many Welsh\"; that is, the British natives, the Wealas, or strangers,  whom he found in possession of the land. The place \"named Cymenesora,\"  at which Aelle had landed, was close to Wittering, at the mouth of  Chichester harbour. And the chronicle, relating what had occurred  thirteen years later, records how \"in this year (490-1) Aelle and  Cissa besieged Andredes ceaster, and slew all that dwelt therein, so  that not even one Briton was left.\" This fortress of Anderida, which  had been a Roman _castrum_, occupied the spot now called Pevensey, the  landing-place of a later conqueror, the Norman William, in 1066. It  guarded on the east the strip of land between the South Downs and the  sea; and when it fell before them, the Saxons became masters of the  region to the north known then as Andredeslea, or Andredeswold, the  forest or weald of Anderida. To the west was Regnum, Cissa's Ceaster,  or Chichester, another of those fortresses which the provident and  energetic Romans had established along the South Coast.    One of Aelle's followers, named Boso, or Bosa, settled at the head of  a branch of Chichester harbour, and, as in the case of his superior,  Cymen, the place was named after him, as Bosenham, or Bosham. This was  in the fifth century. Augustine began his work in Kent late in the  sixth century, and Birinus, who was sent independently direct from  Rome, had undertaken the conversion of the West Saxons fifteen years  before the middle of the succeeding century. But neither by these  missionaries nor their brethren was the territory of the South Saxons  affected.    The West Saxons, by conquest, extended their rule westward and  northward, and missionary enterprise followed the course of military  success and subsequent civil protection. The original British  occupiers of the land withdrew to Wales, or else became subject to the  conquerors. Similar had been the course of events which followed the  taking of Kent by the Jutes. So when Augustine arrived he was welcomed  by Aethelberht, whose wife Bertha, a Frankish princess, was already a  Christian.    Augustine having founded the see of Canterbury, was soon enabled, by  the help of political and social influence, to effect the  establishment of other sees. Rochester, London, and York were soon  centres of activity; but these neighbour principalities had not,  ecclesiastically, affected the territories that were close to their  respective domains; for the kingdom of the South Saxons remained,  nearly two centuries after Aelle's conquest, in the same heathen  condition as prevailed in his day.    Bede relates that at Bosham, Dicul had founded a monastery where,  \"surrounded by woods and water, lived five or six brethren, serving  the Lord in humility and poverty.\" But \"no one cared to emulate their  life, or listen to their teaching.\" Dicul came from Ireland, and it is  supposed that he had been educated in the monastic centre of  missionary life which in the sixth century had been founded there. It  is not, however, known how these few men found their way to the South  Saxon shores, and their presence there had no influence upon the minds  of those invaders who had possessed themselves of the adjacent lands.  A quarrel in the Northumbrian kingdom was the cause which sent a  missionary to Sussex in 680 A.D.    Ecgfrith and his witan had banished #Wilfrith#, Archbishop of York,  from his see. The unfortunate exile wandered some time in search of  welcome. Eventually he found his way to Sussex, where Aethelwealh and  his Christian wife offered him a new field for his energies. Twenty  years earlier he had been in the same kingdom. On that occasion,  having been consecrated by the Bishop of Paris, he was returning from  Gaul when the vessel in which he travelled was driven upon the coast  and stranded."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13334"],[0,"The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce — Volume 2: In the Midst of Life: Tales of (#17)"],[1,"civilian's silk hat. Anyhow he abated none of his dignity in  recognition.    \"I understand,\" he said, gravely, \"that some of my men are out there--a  company of the Tenth, commanded by Captain Armisted. I should like to  meet him if you do not mind.\"    \"He is worth meeting. But there's a bad bit of jungle out there, and I  should advise that you leave your horse and\"--with a look at the  Governor's retinue--\"your other impedimenta.\"    The Governor went forward alone and on foot. In a half-hour he had  pushed through a tangled undergrowth covering a boggy soil and entered  upon firm and more open ground. Here he found a half-company of infantry  lounging behind a line of stacked rifles. The men wore their  accoutrements--their belts, cartridge-boxes, haversacks and canteens.  Some lying at full length on the dry leaves were fast asleep: others in  small groups gossiped idly of this and that; a few played at cards; none  was far from the line of stacked arms. To the civilian's eye the scene  was one of carelessness, confusion, indifference; a soldier would have  observed expectancy and readiness.    At a little distance apart an officer in fatigue uniform, armed, sat on  a fallen tree noting the approach of the visitor, to whom a sergeant,  rising from one of the groups, now came forward.    \"I wish to see Captain Armisted,\" said the Governor.    The sergeant eyed him narrowly, saying nothing, pointed to the officer,  and taking a rifle from one of the stacks, accompanied him.    \"This man wants to see you, sir,\" said the sergeant, saluting. The  officer rose.    It would have been a sharp eye that would have recognized him. His hair,  which but a few months before had been brown, was streaked with gray.  His face, tanned by exposure, was seamed as with age. A long livid scar  across the forehead marked the stroke of a sabre; one cheek was drawn  and puckered by the work of a bullet. Only a woman of the loyal North  would have thought the man handsome.    \"Armisted--Captain,\" said the Governor, extending his hand, \"do you not  know me?\"    \"I know you, sir, and I salute you--as the Governor of my State.\"    Lifting his right hand to the level of his eyes he threw it outward and  downward. In the code of military etiquette there is no provision for  shaking hands. That of the civilian was withdrawn. If he felt either  surprise or chagrin his face did not betray it.    \"It is the hand that signed your commission,\" he said.    \"And it is the hand--\"    The sentence remains unfinished. The sharp report of a rifle came from  the front, followed by another and another. A bullet hissed through the  forest and struck a tree near by. The men sprang from the ground and  even before the captain's high, clear voice was done intoning the  command \"At-ten-tion!\" had fallen into line in rear of the stacked arms.  Again--and now through the din of a crackling fusillade--sounded the  strong, deliberate sing-song of authority: \"Take... arms!\" followed by  the rattle of unlocking bayonets.    Bullets from the unseen enemy were now flying thick and fast, though  mostly well spent and emitting the humming sound which signified  interference by twigs and rotation in the plane of flight. Two or three  of the men in the line were already struck and down. A few wounded men  came limping awkwardly out of the undergrowth from the skirmish line in  front; most of them did not pause, but held their way with white faces  and set teeth to the rear.    Suddenly there was a deep, jarring report in front, followed by the  startling rush of a shell, which passing overhead exploded in the edge  of a thicket, setting afire the fallen leaves. Penetrating the din--  seeming to float above it like the melody of a soaring bird--rang the  slow, aspirated monotones of the captain's several commands, without  emphasis, without accent, musical and restful as an evensong under the  harvest moon. Familiar with this tranquilizing chant in moments of  imminent peril, these raw soldiers of less than a year's training  yielded themselves to the spell, executing its mandates with the  composure and precision of veterans. Even the distinguished civilian  behind his tree, hesitating between pride and terror, was accessible to  its charm and suasion. He was conscious of a fortified resolution and  ran away only when the skirmishers, under orders to rally on the  reserve, came out of the woods like hunted hares and formed on the left  of the stiff little line, breathing hard and thankful for the boon of  breath.    III    THE FIGHTING OF ONE WHOSE HEART WAS NOT IN THE QUARREL    Guided in his retreat by that of the fugitive wounded, the Governor  struggled bravely to the rear through the \"bad bit of jungle.\" He was  well winded and a trifle confused. Excepting a single rifle-shot now and  again, there was no sound of strife behind him; the enemy was pulling  himself together for a new onset against an antagonist of whose numbers  and tactical disposition he was in doubt. The fugitive felt that he  would probably be spared to his country, and only commended the  arrangements of Providence to that end, but in leaping a small brook in  more open ground one of the arrangements incurred the mischance of a  disabling sprain at the ankle. He was unable to continue his flight, for  he was too fat to hop, and after several vain attempts, causing  intolerable pain, seated himself on the earth to nurse his ignoble  disability and deprecate the military situation.    A brisk renewal of the firing broke out and stray bullets came flitting  and droning by. Then came the crash of two clean, definite volleys,  followed by a continuous rattle, through which he heard the yells and  cheers of the combatants, punctuated by thunderclaps of cannon. All this  told him that Armisted's little command was bitterly beset and fighting  at close quarters. The wounded men whom he had distanced began to  straggle by on either hand, their numbers visibly augmented by new  levies from the line. Singly and by twos and threes, some supporting  comrades more desperately hurt than themselves, but all deaf to his  appeals for assistance, they sifted through the underbrush and  disappeared. The firing was increasingly louder and more distinct, and  presently the ailing fugitives were succeeded by men who strode with a  firmer tread, occasionally facing about and discharging their pieces,  then doggedly resuming their retreat, reloading as they walked. Two or  three fell as he looked, and lay motionless. One had enough of life left  in him to make a pitiful attempt to drag himself to cover. A passing  comrade paused beside him long enough to fire, appraised the poor  devil's disability with a look and moved sullenly on, inserting a  cartridge in his weapon.    In all this was none of the pomp of war--no hint of glory. Even in his  distress and peril the helpless civilian could not forbear to contrast  it with the gorgeous parades and reviews held in honor of himself--with  the brilliant uniforms, the music, the banners, and the marching. It was  an ugly and sickening business: to all that was artistic in his nature,  revolting, brutal, in bad taste.    \"Ugh!\" he grunted, shuddering--\"this is beastly! Where is the charm of  it all? Where are the elevated sentiments, the devotion, the heroism,  the--\"    From a point somewhere near, in the direction of the pursuing enemy,  rose the clear, deliberate sing-song of Captain Armisted.    \"Stead-y, men--stead-y. Halt! Com-mence fir-ing.\"    The rattle of fewer than a score of rifles could be distinguished  through the general uproar, and again that penetrating falsetto:    \"Cease fir-ing. In re-treat... maaarch!\"    In a few moments this remnant had drifted slowly past the Governor, all  to the right of him as they faced in retiring, the men deployed at  intervals of a half-dozen paces. At the extreme left and a few yards  behind came the captain. The civilian called out his name, but he did  not hear. A swarm of men in gray now broke out of cover in pursuit,  making directly for the spot where the Governor lay--some accident of  the ground had caused them to converge upon that point: their line had  become a crowd. In a last struggle for life and liberty the Governor  attempted to rise, and looking back the captain saw him. Promptly, but  with the same slow precision as before, he sang his commands:    \"Skirm-ish-ers, halt!\" The men stopped and according to rule turned to  face the enemy.    \"Ral-ly on the right!\"--and they came in at a run, fixing bayonets and  forming loosely on the man at that end of the line.    \"Forward... to save the Gov-ern-or of your State... doub-le quick...  maaarch!\"    Only one man disobeyed this astonishing command! He was dead. With a  cheer they sprang forward over the twenty or thirty paces between them  and their task. The captain having a shorter distance to go arrived  first--simultaneously with the enemy. A half-dozen hasty shots were  fired at him, and the foremost man--a fellow of heroic stature, hatless  and bare-breasted--made a vicious sweep at his head with a clubbed  rifle. The officer parried the blow at the cost of a broken arm and  drove his sword to the hilt into the giant's breast. As the body fell  the weapon was wrenched from his hand and before he could pluck his  revolver from the scabbard at his belt another man leaped upon him like  a tiger, fastening both hands upon his throat and bearing him backward  upon the prostrate Governor, still struggling to rise. This man was  promptly spitted upon the bayonet of a Federal sergeant and his  death-gripe on the captain's throat loosened by a kick upon each wrist.  When the captain had risen he was at the rear of his men, who had all  passed over and around him and were thrusting fiercely at their more  numerous but less coherent antagonists. Nearly all the rifles on both  sides were empty and in the crush there was neither time nor room to  reload. The"]]]
