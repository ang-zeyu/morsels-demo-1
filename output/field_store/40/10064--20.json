[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/954"],[0,"Tom Swift and His War Tank; Or, Doing His Bit for Uncle Sam (#16)"],[1," warned Ned.    The tank was now progressing easily along over fields, hesitating not  at small or big ditches, flow going uphill and now down, across a  stretch of country thinly settled, where even fences were a rarity.  When they came to wooden ones Tom had the workmen get out and take down  the bars. Of course the tank could have crushed them like toothpicks,  but Tom was mindful of the rights of farmers, and a broken fence might  mean strayed cows, or the letting of cattle into a field of grain or  corn, to the damage of both cattle and fodder.    \"There's a barbed-wire fence,\" observed Ned, as he pointed to one off  some distance across the field. \"Why don't you try demolishing that?\"    \"Oh, it would be too easy!  Besides, I don't want the bother of putting  it up again. When I make the barbed-wire test I want some set up on  heavy posts, and with many strands, as it is in Flanders. Even that  won't stop the tank, but I'm anxious to see how she breaks up the wire  and supports--just what sort of a breach she makes. But I have a  different plan in mind now.    \"I'm going to try to find a wooden building we can charge as we did the  masonry factory. I want to smash up a barn, and I'll have to pick out  an old one for choice, for in these war days we must conserve all we  can, even old barns.\"    \"What's the idea of using a barn, Tom?\"    \"Well, I want to test the tank under all sorts of conditions--the same  conditions she'll meet with on the Western front. We've proved that a  brick and stone factory is no obstacle.\"    \"Then how could a flimsy wooden barn be?\"    \"Well, that's just it. I don't think that it will, but it may be that a  barn when smashed will get tangled up in the endless steel belts, and  clog them so they'll jam. That's the reason I want to try a wooden  structure next.\"    \"Do you know where to find one?\"    \"Yes; about a mile from here is one I've had my eyes on ever since I  began constructing the tank. I don't know who owns it, but it's such a  ramshackle affair that he can't object to having it knocked into  kindling wood for him. If he does holler, I can pay him for the damage  done. So now for a barn, Ned, unless you're getting tired and want to  go back?\"    \"I should say not! Speaking of barns, I'm with you till the cows come  home! Want any more machine gun work?\"    \"No, I guess not. This barn isn't particularly isolated, and the  shooting might scare horses and cattle. We can smash things up without  the guns.\"    The tank was going on smoothly when suddenly there was a lurch to one  side, and the great machine quickly swung about in a circle.    \"Hello!\" cried Ned. \"What's up now? Some new stunt?\"    \"Must be something wrong,\" answered the young inventor.  \"One of the  belts has stopped working. That's why we're going in a circle.\"    He shut off the power and hastened down to the motor room.  There he  found his men gathered about one of the machines.    \"What's wrong?\" asked Tom quickly.    \"Just a little accident,\" replied the head machinist. \"One of the boys  dropped his monkey wrench and it smashed some spark plugs. That caused  a short circuit and the left hand motor went out of business. We'll  have her fixed in a jiffy.\"    Tom looked relieved, and the machinist was as good as his word. In a  few minutes the tank was moving forward again. It crossed out to the  road, to the great astonishment of some farmers, and the fright of  their horses, and then Tom once more swung her into the fields.    \"There's the old barn I spoke of,\" he remarked to Ned.  \"It's almost as  bad a ruin as the factory was. But we'll have a go at it.\"    \"Going to smash it?\" asked Ned.    \"I'm going right through it!\" Tom cried.          Chapter XVII    Veiled Threats      Like some prehistoric monster about to charge down upon another of its  kind, Tank A, under the guidance of Tom Swift, reeled and bumped her  way over the uneven fields toward the old barn. Within the monster of  steel and iron were raucous noises: the clang and clatter of the  powerful gasolene motors; the rattle of the wheels and gears; all  making so much noise that, in the engine room proper, not a word could  be heard. Every order had to be given by signs, and Tom sent his  electric signals from the conning tower in the same way. When running  at full speed, it was almost impossible, even in the tower, which was  some distance removed from the engine room, to hear voices unless the  words were shouted.    \"Why don't you go at it?\" cried Ned to his \"friend, who was peering  through the observation slot in the tower.\"    \"I'm getting in good position,\" Tom answered. \"Or rather, the worst  position I can find. I want to give the tank a good try-out, and I'm  going at the barn on the assumption that this is in enemy country and  that I can't pick and choose my advance.    \"So I want to come up through that gully, and go at the barn from the  long way. That will be the worst possible way I could do it, and if old  Tank A stands the gaff I'll know she's a little bit nearer all right.\"    \"I think she's all right as she is!\" asserted Ned in a yell, for just  then Tom signaled for more speed, and the consequent increase in the  rattling and banging noises made it correspondingly difficult for talk  to be heard.    The big machine now tipped into the little gully spoken of by Tom. This  meant a dip downward, and then a climb out again and an attack on the  barn going uphill and at an angle. But, as the young inventor had said,  it would make a severe test and that was what he wanted to give his  ponderous machine.    Ned grasped one of the safety rings, as, with a reel to one side,  almost as if it were going to capsize, the tank rumbled on. Tom cast a  half-amused smile at his chum, and then threw over the guiding lever.    The tank rolled down into the gully. It was rough and filled with  stones and boulders, some of considerable size.  But Tank A made less  than nothing even of the largest rocks.  Some she crushed beneath her  steel belts. Others she simply \"walked\" over, smashing them down into  the soil.    Now the big machine reached the bottom of the gulch and started up the  sides, which, though not as steep as the trench in which she had  capsized, still were not easy going.    \"Now for it!\" cried Tom, as he signaled for full speed.    Up climbed the tank. Now she was halfway. A moment later, and she was  at the top, and then a forward careening motion told that she had  passed over the summit and was ready for the attack proper.    Ned gave a quick glance through the slot nearest him. He had a glimpse  of the barn, and then he saw something else.  This was the sight of a  man running away from the dilapidated structure--a man who glanced  toward the tank with a face that showed great fright.    \"Stop! Stop!\" yelled Ned. \"There may be folks in there, Tom! I just saw  a man run out!\"    \"All right!\" Tom cried, though Ned could hardly hear him.  \"Tell me  when we get on the other side! We're going through now!\"    \"But,\" shouted Ned, \"don't you understand? I saw a man come out of  there! Maybe there's more inside! Wait, Tom, and--\"    But it was too late. The next instant there was a smashing, grinding,  splintering crash, a noise as of a thunder-clap, and Tank A fairly ate  her way through the old barn as a rat might eat his way into a soft  cheese, only infinitely more quickly.    On and on and through and through went the tank, knocking beams,  boards, rafters and timbers hither and thither.  Minding not at all the  weight of great beams on her back, caring nothing for those that got in  the way of her steel belts, heeding not the wall of wood that reared  itself before her in a barrier of splinters and slivers, Tank A went on  and on until finally, with another grinding crash, as she smashed her  way through the farthermost wall, the great engine of war emerged on  the other side and came panting into the field, dragging with her a  part of the structure clinging to her steel sides.    \"Well,\" cried Tom, with a laugh, as he signaled for the power to be  shut off, thereby making it possible for ordinary conversation to be  heard, \"I guess we didn't do a thing to that barn!\"    \"Not much left of it, for a fact, Tom,\" agreed Ned, as he looked  through the after observation slots at the ruin in the rear. \"But  didn't you hear what I was saying?\"    \"I heard you yelling something to me, but I was too anxious to go at it  as fast as I could. I didn't want to stop then. What was the trouble?\"    \"That's what I'm afraid of, Tom--there may be trouble.  Just before you  tackled the barn for a knockdown, instead of a touchdown, as we might  say, I saw a man running out of it.  I thought if there was one there,  perhaps there might be more. That's why I yelled to you.\"    \"A man running from the old barn!\" cried Tom. \"Whew!\" he whistled. \"I  wish I had seen him. But, Ned, if one ran out of harm's way, any others  who might possibly be in there would do the same thing, wouldn't they?\"    \"I hope so,\" returned Ned doubtfully.    \"Great Scott!\" cried Tom, as the possibility was borne home to him. \"If  anything has happened--\"    He sprang for the door of the tower and threw over the catch, springing  out, followed by Ned. From the engine room of the armored tank the men  came, smiles of gratification on their faces.    \"We certainly busted her wide open, Mr. Swift!\" called the chief  mechanician.    \"Yes,\" assented the young inventor; but there was not as much  gratification in his voice as there should have been.  \"There isn't  much of a barn left, but Ned thinks he saw some one run out, and if  there was one man there may have been more. We'd better have a look  around, I guess.\"    The engineering force exchanged glances. Then Hank Baldwin, who was in  charge of the motors, said:    \"Well, if there was anybody in that barn when we chewed her up I  wouldn't give much for his hide, German or not.\"    \"Let us hope no one was in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/955"],[0,"The Patchwork Girl of Oz (#16)"],[1,"make  you a lovely hat that will match the rest of you.\"    \"Never mind the hat,\" said Scraps, shaking her yarn braids; \"it's a  kind offer, but we can't stop. I can't see that my colors have faded a  particle, as yet; can you?\"    \"Not much,\" replied the woman. \"You are still very gorgeous, in spite  of your long journey.\"    The children of the house wanted to keep the Glass Cat to play with, so  Bungle was offered a good home if she would remain; but the cat was too  much interested in Ojo's adventures and refused to stop.    \"Children are rough playmates,\" she remarked to the Shaggy Man, \"and  although this home is more pleasant than that of the Crooked Magician I  fear I would soon be smashed to pieces by the boys and girls.\"    After they had rested themselves they renewed their journey, finding  the road now smooth and pleasant to walk upon and the country growing  more beautiful the nearer they drew to the Emerald City.    By and by Ojo began to walk on the green grass, looking carefully  around him.    \"What are you trying to find?\" asked Scraps.    \"A six-leaved clover,\" said he.    \"Don't do that!\" exclaimed the Shaggy Man, earnestly. \"It's against the  Law to pick a six-leaved clover. You must wait until you get Ozma's  consent.\"    \"She wouldn't know it,\" declared the boy.    \"Ozma knows many things,\" said the Shaggy Man. \"In her room is a Magic  Picture that shows any scene in the Land of Oz where strangers or  travelers happen to be. She may be watching the picture of us even now,  and noticing everything that we do.\"    \"Does she always watch the Magic Picture?\" asked Ojo.    \"Not always, for she has many other things to do; but, as I said, she  may be watching us this very minute.\"    \"I don't care,\" said Ojo, in an obstinate tone of voice; \"Ozma's only a  girl.\"    The Shaggy Man looked at him in surprise.    \"You ought to care for Ozma,\" said he, \"if you expect to save your  uncle. For, if you displease our powerful Ruler, your journey will  surely prove a failure; whereas, if you make a friend of Ozma, she will  gladly assist you. As for her being a girl, that is another reason why  you should obey her laws, if you are courteous and polite. Everyone in  Oz loves Ozma and hates her enemies, for she is as just as she is  powerful.\"    Ojo sulked a while, but finally returned to the road and kept away from  the green clover. The boy was moody and bad tempered for an hour or two  afterward, because he could really see no harm in picking a six-leaved  clover, if he found one, and in spite of what the Shaggy Man had said  he considered Ozma's law to be unjust.    They presently came to a beautiful grove of tall and stately trees,  through which the road wound in sharp curves--first one way and then  another. As they were walking through this grove they heard some one in  the distance singing, and the sounds grew nearer and nearer until they  could distinguish the words, although the bend in the road still hid  the singer. The song was something like this:        \"Here's to the hale old bale of straw      That's cut from the waving grain,      The sweetest sight man ever saw      In forest, dell or plain.      It fills me with a crunkling joy      A straw-stack to behold,      For then I pad this lucky boy      With strands of yellow gold.\"      \"Ah!\" exclaimed the Shaggy Man; \"here comes my friend the Scarecrow.\"    \"What, a live Scarecrow?\" asked Ojo.    \"Yes; the one I told you of. He's a splendid fellow, and very  intelligent. You'll like him, I'm sure.\"    Just then the famous Scarecrow of Oz came around the bend in the road,  riding astride a wooden Sawhorse which was so small that its rider's  legs nearly touched the ground.    The Scarecrow wore the blue dress of the Munchkins, in which country he  was made, and on his head was set a peaked hat with a flat brim trimmed  with tinkling bells. A rope was tied around his waist to hold him in  shape, for he was stuffed with straw in every part of him except the  top of his head, where at one time the Wizard of Oz had placed sawdust,  mixed with needles and pins, to sharpen his wits. The head itself was  merely a bag of cloth, fastened to the body at the neck, and on the  front of this bag was painted the face--ears, eyes, nose and mouth.    The Scarecrow's face was very interesting, for it bore a comical and  yet winning expression, although one eye was a bit larger than the  other and ears were not mates. The Munchkin farmer who had made the  Scarecrow had neglected to sew him together with close stitches and  therefore some of the straw with which he was stuffed was inclined to  stick out between the seams. His hands consisted of padded white  gloves, with the fingers long and rather limp, and on his feet he wore  Munchkin boots of blue leather with broad turns at the tops of them.    The Sawhorse was almost as curious as its rider. It had been rudely  made, in the beginning, to saw logs upon, so that its body was a short  length of a log, and its legs were stout branches fitted into four  holes made in the body. The tail was formed by a small branch that had  been left on the log, while the head was a gnarled bump on one end of  the body. Two knots of wood formed the eyes, and the mouth was a gash  chopped in the log. When the Sawhorse first came to life it had no ears  at all, and so could not hear; but the boy who then owned him had  whittled two ears out of bark and stuck them in the head, after which  the Sawhorse heard very distinctly.    This queer wooden horse was a great favorite with Princess Ozma, who  had caused the bottoms of its legs to be shod with plates of gold, so  the wood would not wear away. Its saddle was made of cloth-of-gold  richly encrusted with precious gems. It had never worn a bridle.    As the Scarecrow came in sight of the party of travelers, he reined in  his wooden steed and dismounted, greeting the Shaggy Man with a smiling  nod. Then he turned to stare at the Patchwork Girl in wonder, while she  in turn stared at him.    \"Shags,\" he whispered, drawing the Shaggy Man aside, \"pat me into  shape, there's a good fellow!\"    While his friend punched and patted the Scarecrow's body, to smooth out  the humps, Scraps turned to Ojo and whispered: \"Roll me out, please;  I've sagged down dreadfully from walking so much and men like to see a  stately figure.\"    She then fell upon the ground and the boy rolled her back and forth  like a rolling-pin, until the cotton had filled all the spaces in her  patchwork covering and the body had lengthened to its fullest extent.  Scraps and the Scarecrow both finished their hasty toilets at the same  time, and again they faced each other.    \"Allow me, Miss Patchwork,\" said the Shaggy Man, \"to present my friend,  the Right Royal Scarecrow of Oz. Scarecrow, this is Miss Scraps  Patches; Scraps, this is the Scarecrow. Scarecrow--Scraps;  Scraps--Scarecrow.\"    They both bowed with much dignity.    \"Forgive me for staring so rudely,\" said the Scarecrow, \"but you are  the most beautiful sight my eyes have ever beheld.\"    \"That is a high compliment from one who is himself so beautiful,\"  murmured Scraps, casting down her suspender-button eyes by lowering her  head. \"But, tell me, good sir, are you not a trifle lumpy?\"    \"Yes, of course; that's my straw, you know. It bunches up, sometimes,  in spite of all my efforts to keep it even. Doesn't your straw ever  bunch?\"    \"Oh, I'm stuffed with cotton,\" said Scraps. \"It never bunches, but it's  inclined to pack down and make me sag.\"    \"But cotton is a high-grade stuffing. I may say it is even more  stylish, not to say aristocratic, than straw,\" said the Scarecrow  politely. \"Still, it is but proper that one so entrancingly lovely  should have the best stuffing there is going. I--er--I'm so glad I've  met you, Miss Scraps! Introduce us again, Shaggy.\"    \"Once is enough,\" replied the Shaggy Man, laughing at his friend's  enthusiasm.    \"Then tell me where you found her, and--Dear me, what a queer cat! What  are you made of--gelatine?\"    \"Pure glass,\" answered the cat, proud to have attracted the Scarecrow's  attention. \"I am much more beautiful than the Patchwork Girl. I'm  transparent, and Scraps isn't; I've pink brains--you can see 'em work;  and I've a ruby heart, finely polished, while Scraps hasn't any heart  at all.\"    \"No more have I,\" said the Scarecrow, shaking hands with Scraps, as if  to congratulate her on the fact. \"I've a friend, the Tin Woodman, who  has a heart, but I find I get along pretty well without one. And  so--Well, well! here's a little Munchkin boy, too. Shake hands, my  little man. How are you?\"    Ojo placed his hand in the flabby stuffed glove that served the  Scarecrow for a hand, and the Scarecrow pressed it so cordially that  the straw in his glove crackled.    Meantime, the Woozy had approached the Sawhorse and begun to sniff at  it. The Sawhorse resented this familiarity and with a sudden kick  pounded the Woozy squarely on its head with one gold-shod foot.    \"Take that, you monster!\" it cried angrily.    The Woozy never even winked.    \"To be sure,\" he said; \"I'll take anything I have to. But don't make me  angry, you wooden beast, or my eyes will flash fire and burn you up.\"    The Sawhorse rolled its knot eyes wickedly and kicked again, but the  Woozy trotted away and said to the Scarecrow:    \"What a sweet disposition that creature has! I advise you to chop it up  for kindling-wood and use me to ride upon. My back is flat and you  can't fall off.\"    \"I think the trouble is that you haven't been properly introduced,\"  said the Scarecrow, regarding the Woozy with much wonder, for he had  never seen such a queer animal before.    \"The Sawhorse is the favorite steed of Princess Ozma, the Ruler of the  Land of Oz, and he lives in a stable decorated with pearls and  emeralds, at the rear of the royal palace. He is swift as the wind,  untiring, and is kind to his friends. All the people of Oz"]]]
