It is good and healthful,  and intoxicates him who drinks it. If you will drink it, it will  intoxicate you, it will heal you, it will soothe your heart, it will  prepare you for the labors and fatigues of death, or of your departure.\"    \"Whither, oh ancient man,\" asked Quetzalcoatl, \"Whither must I go?\"    The old man answered:--    \"You must without fail go to Tullan Tlapallan, where there is another old  man awaiting you; you and he will talk together, and at your return you  will be transformed into a youth, and you will regain the vigor of your  boyhood.\"    When Quetzalcoatl heard these words, his heart was shaken with strong  emotion, and the old man added:--    \"My lord, drink this medicine.\"    \"Oh ancient man,\" answered the king, \"I do not want to drink it.\"    \"Drink it, my lord,\" insisted the old man, \"for if you do not drink it  now, later you will long for it; at least, lift it to your mouth and taste  a single drop.\"    Quetzalcoatl took the drop and tasted it, and then quaffed the liquor,  exclaiming:--    \"What is this? It seems something very healthful and well-flavored. I am  no longer sick. It has cured me. I am well.\"    \"Drink again,\" said the old man. \"It is a good medicine, and you will be  healthier than ever.\"    Again did Quetzalcoatl drink, and soon he was intoxicated. He began to  weep; his heart was stirred, and his mind turned toward the suggestion of  his departure, nor did the deceit of the old sorcerer permit him to  abandon the thought of it. The medicine which Quetzalcoatl drank was the  white wine of the country, made of those magueys call _teometl_.[1]    [Footnote 1: From _teotl_, deity, divine, and _metl_, the maguey. Of the  twenty-nine varieties of the maguey, now described in Mexico, none bears  this name; but Hernandez speaks of it, and says it was so called because  there was a superstition that a person soon to die could not hold a branch  of it; but if he was to recover, or escape an impending danger, he could  hold it with ease and feel the better for it. See Nieremberg, _Historia  Naturae_, Lib. xiv, cap. xxxii. \"Teomatl, vitae et mortis Index.\"]    This was but the beginning of the guiles and juggleries of Tezcatlipoca.  Transforming himself into the likeness of one of those Indians of the Maya  race, called _Toveyome_,[1] he appeared, completely nude, in the market  place of Tollan, having green peppers to sell. Now Huemac, who was  associated with Quetzalcoatl in the sovereignty of Tollan (although other  myths apply this name directly to Quetzalcoatl, and this seems the correct  version),[2] had an only daughter of surpassing beauty, whom many of the  Toltecs had vainly sought in marriage. This damsel looked forth on the  market where Tezcatlipoca stood in his nakedness, and her virginal eyes  fell upon the sign of his manhood. Straightway an unconquerable longing  seized her, a love so violent that she fell ill and seemed like to die.  Her women told her father the reason, and he sent forth and had the false  Toveyo brought before him. Huemac addressed him:--    [Footnote 1: _Toveyome_ is the plural of _toveyo_, which Molina, in his  dictionary, translates \"foreigner, stranger.\" Sahagun says that it was  applied particularly to the Huastecs, a Maya tribe living in the province  of Panuco. _Historia_, etc., Lib. x, cap. xxix, Sec.8.]    [Footnote 2: _Huemac_ is a compound of _uey_, great, and _maitl_, hand.  Tezozomoc, Duran, and various other writers assign this name to  Quetzalcoatl.]    \"Whence come you?\"    \"My lord,\" replied the Toveyo, \"I am a stranger, and I have come to sell  green peppers.\"    \"Why,\" asked the king \"do you not wear a _maxtli_ (breech-cloth), and  cover your nakedness with a garment?\"    \"My lord,\" answered the stranger, \"I follow the custom of my country.\"    Then the king added:--    \"You have inspired in my daughter a longing; she is sick with desire; you  must cure her.\"    \"Nay, my lord,\" said the stranger, \"this may not be. Rather slay me here;  I wish to die; for I am not worthy to hear such words, poor as I am, and  seeking only to gain my bread by selling green peppers.\"    But the king insisted, and said:--    \"Have no fear; you alone can restore my daughter; you must do so.\"    Thereupon the attendants cut the sham Toveyo's hair; they led him to the  bath, and colored his body black; they placed a _maxtli_ and a robe upon  him, and the king said:--    \"Go in unto my daughter.\"    Tezcatlipoca went in unto her, and she was healed from that hour.    Thus did the naked stranger become the son-in-law of the great king of  Tula. But the Toltecs were deeply angered that the maiden had given his  black body the preference over their bright forms, and they plotted to  have him slain. He was placed in the front of battle, and then they left  him alone to fight the enemy. But he destroyed the opposing hosts and  returned to Tula with a victory all the more brilliant for their desertion  of him.    Then he requited their treachery with another, and pursued his intended  destruction of their race. He sent a herald to the top of the Hill of  Shouting, and through him announced a magnificent festival to celebrate  his victory and his marriage. The Toltecs swarmed in crowds, men, women  and children, to share in the joyous scene. Tezcatlipoca received them  with simulated friendship. Taking his drum, he began to beat upon it,  accompanying the music with a song. As his listeners heard the magic  music, they became intoxicated with the strains, and yielding themselves  to its seductive influence, they lost all thought for the future or care  for the present. The locality to which the crafty Tezcatlipoca had invited  them was called, The Rock upon the Water.[1] It was the summit of a lofty  rock at the base of which flowed the river called, By the Rock of  Light.[2] When the day had departed and midnight approached, the magician,  still singing and dancing, led the intoxicated crowd to the brink of the  river, over which was a stone bridge. This he had secretly destroyed, and  as they came to the spot where it should have been and sought to cross,  the innumerable crowd pressing one upon the other, they all fell into the  water far below, where they sank out of sight and were changed into  stones.    [Footnote 1: _Texcalapan_, from _texcalli_, rock, and _apan_, upon or over  the water.]    [Footnote 2: _Texcaltlauhco_, from _texcalli_, rock, _tlaulli_, light, and  the locative ending _co_, by, in or at.]    Is it pushing symbolism too far to attempt an interpretation of this  fable, recounted with all the simplicity of the antique world, with  greater directness, indeed, than I have thought wise to follow?    I am strongly inclined to regard it as a true myth, which, in  materialistic language, sets forth the close of the day and the extinction  of the light. May we not construe the maiden as the Evening Twilight, the  child of the Day at the close of its life? The black lover with whom she  is fatally enamored, is he not the Darkness, in which the twilight fades  away? The countless crowds of Toltecs that come to the wedding  festivities, and are drowned before midnight in the waters of the  strangely named river, are they not the infinitely numerous light-rays  which are quenched in the world-stream, when the sun has sunk, and the  gloaming is lost in the night?    May we not go farther, and in this Rock of Light which stands hard by the  river, recognize the Heavenly Hill which rises beside the World Stream?  The bright light of one day cannot extend to the next. The bridge is  broken by the intervening night, and the rays are lost in the dark waters.    But whether this interpretation is too venturesome or not, we cannot deny  the deep human interest in the story, and its poetic capacities. The  overmastering passion of love was evidently as present to the Indian mind  as to that of the mediaeval Italian. In New as well as in Old Spain it  could break the barriers of rank and overcome the hesitations of maidenly  modesty. Love clouding the soul, as night obscures the day, is a figure of  speech, used, I remember, by the most pathetic of Ireland's modern  bards:--    \"Love, the tyrant, evinces,    Alas! an omnipotent might;  He treads on the necks of princes,    He darkens the mind, like night.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Clarence Mangan, _Poems_, \"The Mariner's Bride.\"]    I shall not detail the many other wiles with which Tezcatlipoca led the  Toltecs to their destruction. A mere reference to them must suffice. He  summoned thousands to come to labor in the rose-garden of Quetzalcoatl,  and when they had gathered together, he fell upon them and slew them with  a hoe. Disguised with Huitzilopochtli, he irritated the people until they  stoned the brother gods to death, and from the corrupting bodies spread a  pestilential odor, to which crowds of the Toltecs fell victims. He turned  the thought of thousands into madness, so that they voluntarily offered  themselves to be sacrificed. By his spells all articles of food soured,  and many perished of famine.    At length Quetzalcoatl, wearied with misfortune, gave orders to burn the  beautiful houses of Tollan, to bury his treasures, and to begin the  journey to Tlapallan. He transformed the cacao trees into plants of no  value, and ordered the birds of rich plumage to leave the land before him.    The first station he arrived at was Quauhtitlan, where there was a lofty  and spreading tree. Here he asked of his servants a mirror, and looking in  it said: \"I am already old.\" Gathering some stones, he cast them at the  tree. They entered the wood and remained there.    As he journeyed, he was preceded by boys playing the flute. Thus he  reached a certain spot, where he sat upon a stone by the wayside, and wept  for the loss of Tollan. The marks of his hands remained upon the stone,  and the tears he dropped pierced it through. To the day of the Conquest  these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11039"],[0,"A Woman's Journey Round the World (#17)"],[1,"Caciques (chiefs) from the strongest and finest men; follow  all their old customs on the occasion of marriages and deaths, just  the same as before baptism.    Their language is very poor:  they are said, for example, only to be  able to count one and two, and are therefore obliged, when they  desire to express a larger number, to repeat these two figures  continually.  Furthermore, for _today, to-morrow_, and _yesterday_,  they possess only the word _day_, and express their more particular  meaning by signs; for _today_, they say _day_, and feel their head,  or point upwards; for _to-morrow_, they again use the word _day_,  and point their fingers in a straightforward direction; and for  _yesterday_, they use the same word, and point behind them.    The Puris are said to be peculiarly adapted for tracking runaway  negroes, as their organs of smell are very highly developed.  They  smell the trace of the fugitive on the leaves of the trees; and if  the negro does not succeed in reaching some stream, in which he can  either walk or swim for a considerable distance, it is asserted that  he can very seldom escape the Indian engaged in pursuit of him.  These savages are also readily employed in felling timber, and  cultivating Indian corn, manioc, etc., as they are very industrious,  and think themselves well paid with a little tobacco, brandy, or  coloured cloth.  But on no account must they be compelled to do  anything by force:  they are free men.  They seldom, however, come  to offer their assistance unless they are half-starved.    I visited the huts of all these savages; and as my guides had  trumpeted forth my praises as being a woman of great knowledge, I  was here asked my advice for the benefit of every one who was ill.    In one of the huts, I found an old woman groaning in her hammock.  On my drawing nearer, they uncovered the poor creature, and I  perceived that all her breast was eaten up by cancer.  She seemed to  have no idea of a bandage, or any means of soothing the pain.  I  advised her to wash the wound frequently with a decoction of  mallows, {50} and, in addition to this, to cover it over with the  leaves of the same plant.  I only trust that my advice procured her  some trifling relief.    This horrible disease unfortunately does not appear to be at all  rare among the Puris, for I saw many of their women, some of whom  had large hard swellings, and others even small tumours on the  breast.    After having sufficiently examined everything in the huts, I went  with some of the savages to shoot parrots and monkeys.  We had not  far to go in order to meet with both; and I had now an opportunity  of admiring the skill with which these people use their bows.  They  brought down the birds even when they were on the wing, and very  seldom missed their mark.  After shooting three parrots and an ape,  we returned to the huts.    The good creatures offered me the best hut they possessed, and  invited me to pass the night there.  Being rather fatigued by the  toilsome nature of my journey on foot, the heat, and the hunting  excursion, I very joyfully accepted their proposition:  the day,  too, was drawing to a close, and I should not have been able to  reach the settlement of the whites before night.  I therefore spread  out my cloak upon the ground, arranged a log of wood so as to serve  instead of a pillow, and for the present seated myself upon my  splendid couch.  In the meanwhile, my hosts were preparing the  monkey and the parrots, by sticking them on wooden spits, and  roasting them before the fire.  In order to render the meal a  peculiarly dainty one, they also buried some Indian corn and roots  in the cinders.  They then gathered a few large fresh leaves off the  trees, tore the roasted ape into several pieces with their hands,  and placing a large portion of it, as well as a parrot, Indian corn,  and some roots upon the leaves, put it before me.  My appetite was  tremendous, seeing that I had tasted nothing since the morning.  I  therefore immediately fell to on the roasted monkey, which I found  superlatively delicious:  the flesh of the parrot was far from being  so tender and palatable.    After our meal, I begged the Indians to perform one of their dances  for me--a request with which they readily complied.  As it was  already dark, they brought a quantity of wood, which they formed  into a sort of funeral pile, and set on fire:  the men then formed a  circle all round, and began the dance.  They threw their bodies from  side to side in a most remarkably awkward fashion, but always moving  the head forwards in a straight line.  The women then joined in,  remaining, however, at some little distance in the rear of the men,  and making the same awkward movements.  They now began a most  horrible noise, which was intended for a song, at the same time  distorting their features in a frightful manner.  One of them stood  near, playing upon a kind of stringed instrument, made out of the  stem of a cabbage-palm, and about two feet, or two feet and a half,  in length.  A hole was cut in it in a slanting direction, and six  fibres of the stem had been raised up, and kept in an elevated  position at each end, by means of a small bridge.  The fingers were  then used for playing upon these as upon a guitar:  the tone was  very low, disagreeable, and hoarse.    This first dance they named the Dance of Peace or Joy.  The men then  performed a much wilder one alone.  After providing themselves for  the purpose with bows, arrows, and stout clubs, they again formed a  circle, but their movements were much quicker and wilder than in the  first instance, and they likewise hit about them with their clubs in  a horrible fashion.  They then suddenly broke their rank, strung  their bows, placed their arrows ready, and went through the  pantomime of shooting after a flying foe, uttering at the same time  the most piercing cries, which echoed through the whole forest.  I  started up in affright, for I really believed that I was surrounded  by enemies, and that I was delivered up into their power, without  any chance of help or assistance.  I was heartily glad when this  horrible war-dance came to a conclusion.    After retiring to rest, and when all around had gradually become  hushed into silence, I was assailed by apprehensions of another  description:  I thought of the number of wild beasts, and the  horrible serpents that might perhaps be concealed quite close to me,  and then of the exposed situation I was in.  This kept me awake a  long time, and I often fancied I heard a rustling among the leaves,  as if one of the dreaded animals were breaking through.  At length,  however, my weary body asserted its rights.  I laid my head upon my  wooden pillow, and consoled myself with the idea that the danger  was, after all, not so great as many of we travellers wish to have  believed, otherwise how would it be possible for the savages to live  as they do, without any precautions, in their open huts!    On the 12th of October, early in the morning, I took leave of the  savages, and made them a present of various bronze ornaments, with  which they were so delighted that they offered me everything they  possessed.  I took a bow with a couple of arrows, as mementos of my  visit; returned to the wooden house, and having also distributed  similar presents there, mounted my mule, and arrived late in the  evening at Aldea do Pedro.    On the morning of the 13th of October, I bade the obliging priest  farewell, and with my attendant, who, by this time was quite  recovered, began my journey back to Novo Friburgo, and, in this  instance, although I pursued the same road, was only three days  instead of four on the way.    On arriving I found Count Berchthold, who was now quite well.  We  determined, therefore, before returning to Rio Janeiro, to make a  little excursion to a fine waterfall, about twelve miles from Novo  Friburgo.  By mere chance we learned that the christening of the  Princess Isabella would take place on the 19th, and, as we did not  wish to miss this interesting ceremony, we preferred returning  directly.  We followed the same road we had taken in coming, till  about four miles before reaching Ponte de Pinheiro, and then struck  off towards Porto de Praja.  This road was thirty-two miles longer  by land, but so much shorter by sea, that the passage is made by  steamer from Porto de Praja to Rio Janeiro in half an hour.  The  scenery around Pinheiro was mostly dull and tedious, almost like a  desert, the monotony of which was only broken here and there by a  few scanty woods or low hills.  We were not lucky enough to see the  mountains again until we were near the capital.    I must here mention a comical mistake of Herr Beske, of Novo  Friburgo, which we at first could not understand, but which  afterwards afforded a good deal of amusement.  Herr Beske had  recommended us a guide, whom he described as a walking encyclopaedia  of knowledge, and able to answer all our questions about trees,  plants, scenery, etc., in the most complete manner.  We esteemed  ourselves exceedingly fortunate to obtain such a phoenix of a guide,  and immediately took advantage of every opportunity to put his  powers to the test.  He could, however, tell us nothing at all; if  we asked him the name of a river, he replied that it was too small,  and had no name.  The trees, likewise, were too insignificant, the  plants too common.  This ignorance was rather too much; we made  inquiry, and found that Herr Beske had not intended to send us the  guide we had, but his brother, who, however, had died six months  previously--a circumstance which Herr Beske must have forgotten.    On the evening of the 18th of October, we arrived safely in Rio  Janeiro.  We immediately inquired about the christening, and heard  it had been put off till the 15th of November, and that on the 19th  of October only the Emperor's anniversary would be kept."]]]
