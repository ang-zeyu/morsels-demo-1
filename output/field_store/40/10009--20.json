Between Cat Island and Storehouse Island is a two-fathom channel,  one-sixth of a mile broad through which Kable's schooner has passed to  the South. The harbour is very open and a good deal of sea heaves in, but  small vessels can up anchor and just run round to the opposite side of  Cat Island--there is a snug cove entirely secure from all southerly winds  where they may anchor, taking care to be off from this last place, if the  wind comes from the northward. From the Grand Capshine the land trends  away in a south-east and south direction as far as Cape Barren; from  where we lay the Bay of Shoals bore south by west distant 15 miles. A  vessel of a large draught would have to lie a good deal further out in  the Bay than we, as we rode in one quarter less than 3 fathoms.    \"Wednesday, 25th November. Fresh breezes and hazy weather. At half-past 3  saw a single rock bearing south-south-west distance 9 or 10 miles, and an  island on our beam south-east...haze very thick and scud flying thick. At  4 P.M. saw a rock lying to north of Kent's Group about 3 miles...At  half-past 4 saw easternmost island of Kent's Group bearing west by south  distance 8 miles, by half-past 5 P.M. having come nearly up with the  land, passed in between the group and a rock that lies to the north and  by 6 opened the Sound that passes through the Islands...As we approached  the first cove saw a large part of the island on fire from which we  conceived there might be people on shore--kept standing up the Sound and  had furious gusts of wind at every point of the compass. We proceeded up  with sails, sweeps and boat till we opened the second cove but found it  impossible to get to anchorage in it as violent gusts constantly came  down it. At 7 P.M. bore away for the cove on the west side and at  half-past 7 P.M. came to anchor in 7 fathoms.    \"Thursday, 26th November. Moderately fine weather in general. At 2 P.M.  the officer and his  party returned on board having found no water--every part of the cove was  overhauled and only rainwater could be found here, the rocks being  strongly marked with the stream of water that will naturally fall from  such a high land in heavy rain. From the mate's finding a small quantity  of Queyha rope in this cove, and seeing a dog dead on the beach, I fancy  the Harrington must have been here, the dog being much like one of Mr.  Cumming's. In the afternoon I sent the first mate to the second cove on  the east side to overhaul it for water, but on the strictest search they  found nothing, but a brackish kind of spring...they however shot and  caught three kangaroos.    \"Friday, 27th November. Sounded the channel that divided this group right  through...At the southernmost end lies a bank of 10 fathoms. As you  approach the East Cove the water gradually shoals from 30 to 40  fathoms...and as you advance on West Cove the water suddenly falls from  30 to 16-14-12-10-8-7-6-5-4 and 3 fathoms, close to the beach the bottom  consists of sand mixed with small shells and stones--the East Cove the  same and small seaweed, the West Cove is strong, coarse sand and where we  anchored quite covered with black kelp so much so that at first I was not  clear but it might be rock...    \"Saturday, 28th November. Measured a base line of 324 fathoms in length  from one point of the cove we lay in to the other, it was measured with  small line and every five fathoms of it was a chip of light wood in  length 120 fathoms. We had the boats employed in this business;  alternately anchored them till we got across to the southern end of the  point of the cove; and as the water was smooth I fancy the length of base  line to be correct. I then surveyed the eastern side of the Sound and  Cove. Sent the first mate and some hands to the north-east cove to cut  some of ye wood growing there...I sent the carpenter with him--overhauled  our bread and found...some had got damp and mouldy, got it out from the  rest, but owing to the bad weather could not air it on deck...    \"Sunday, 29th November. Hard gales and gloomy weather throughout with a  swell heaving in through the northern entrance of ye sound. P.M. The  first mate returned on board having cut down two spars...The party with  the dog caught two large and 3 small kangaroos. At 8 P.M. as usual set a  third watch with an officer. A.M. I went over to Harrington (or East)  Cove,* (* Named after Captain Campbell's ship the Harrington to whose  presence in these waters Murray often refers.) measured a base line and  surveyed the western side of this sound. I also overhauled every part of  the Rocks all round the cove and without it examined every drain that I  fell in with and although I saw at different parts of the under rocks and  in holes perhaps enough water to keep a few men alive yet no quantity  that could be much use to a ship's company. In East Cove there is a good  anchorage all over it for ships of any size, and they may exactly choose  what water to be in from 3 fathoms close in to ye beach to 14 in ye mouth  of it. I sounded every part of it and ye bottom is sand with small stones  and shells much covered with black seaweed that might at first be thought  to be rocks...West Cove is almost the same...East Cove is ye best to lie  in as it entirely shuts in sea gates and moreover has little ground swell  to which both other coves are subject. With respect to the tide in the  coves little can be perceived, the perpendicular rise at full moon may be  10 or 11 feet, with us it sometimes was 8 or 9 feet, and that in ye  course of ye hour...At all times it is imprudent to carry sail on a boat  in this sound; the puffs come so violent that before anybody could take  in her sail she would to a certainty be overset; even ships, in my  opinion, would do well before they enter this sound to take in all their  small sails and keep all hands at the braces fore and aft as well as  hands by the top-sail halyards, and it is necessary to handle the yards  quick otherwise a large vessel will be sure to rub sides with ye rocks if  it has blown fresh outside all day...The kangaroo seems to be most  plentiful at this time in the north-eastern cove owing, I fancy, to their  being less disturbed there than in the other coves, but with good dogs  and a little trouble they may be had on the hills in the vicinity of  either cove. Wood is plentiful and no trouble in getting it.    \"Monday, 30th November. Hard gales, hazy weather with rain throughout.  The soil throughout this sound is nothing but sand a good way up the  hills and after that you chiefly find rocks with here and there a shott  of grass. The hills are covered very thick with brushwood, a great part  of which is decayed and rotten and renders it a business of labour to  ascend any of them. They are also very high--we have seen nothing new on  them. A few parrots are to be seen and now and then a snake of a large  size, these with kangaroos, gulls, redbills, form the inhabitants of  these islands, sometimes a seal comes in shore but very seldom and with  much care.    \"Thursday, 3rd December. Warped a little way out and finding could get no  more of the warp sent hands in the gig to stand by...she drove and we  were obliged to let go small bower again. At this time wind increased to  a gale...P.M. Got altitudes for Governor King's chronometer. A.M. Sent  the first mate and a party to get kangaroos to the opposite or west side  of the land from the cove we lay in and for fresh water.    \"Friday, 4th December. At sundown party returned--reported no fresh water  to be found on that side of island, got 3 kangaroos, some shell-fish, and  knocked down 2 seals. A.M. Hove up our B.B.* (* Best bower, that is the  starboard bower.) At 11 weighed and made sail through sound, at quarter  past 11 clear through, strong wind at east. Got sight of rock laying off  this island. At noon bore up to survey small island.    \"Saturday, 5th December. Strong winds, hazy. At 1 P.M. hove to...At 3  P.M. body of Kent's Group bore east by south distance 15 or 16 miles. At  half-past 4 the five Seal Islands bore north-north-east distance 8 or 9  miles...Saw Sir R. Curtis's Island west by south 10 miles. At 7 P.M. saw  Wilson's Promontory bearing west-north-west 13 or 14 miles...Stood on  till 9 P.M. when it being thick and almost calm hauled close to ye wind  off and on...At 4 A.M. the Promontory bore west 7 or 8 miles. Made all  sail at 8 A.M. rounded and intending to run between the mainland and ye  islands having a fine breeze was surprised to lose all ye wind in an  instant as we stood in under ye land--although we were not less than 3 or  4 miles from ye mainland it fell calm...Put the helm a starboard, put  sweeps on her, and pulled her out into ye wind again...At 10 A.M. passed  a remarkable rock with a hole in it. Latitude 39 degrees 10 minutes 0  seconds south.    \"Sunday, 6th December. At 3 P.M. saw Cape Liptrap bearing  north-north-west distance 6 or 7 miles...Stood in round Phillip Island  and by 8 A.M. got close up with Grant's Point and Seal Island.    \"Monday, 7th December. At 5 P.M. a breeze sprung up at south-west. Stood  in for the entrance with all sail and the sweeps. At 6 P.M. gained  entrance and passed between Grant's Point and Seal Island which island  seemed as full of seals as when we were last there, a circumstance that  almost made me conclude that neither the Harrington or Mr. Rushford* (*  Presumably Mr. Rushworth.) had been here. Kept standing up the harbour  with a south-west wind, at 7 came to anchor in Elizabeth's Cove in 6  fathoms water with the small bower; lowered down the gig and I went on  shore to observe if any signs of strangers were to be seen. Saw nothing  to make me think the cove had been visited since we left in May last, in  short the only difference was that the land appeared in a higher state of  verdure now than it was at that time. At 4 A.M. out launch and sent the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7524"],[0,"The Germany and the Agricola of Tacitus (#16)"],[1,", as  terms expressing their situation. For, according to the most learned  Germans, the Ingaevones are _die Inwohner_, those dwelling inwards,  towards the sea; the Istaevones, _die Westwohner_, the inhabitants of  the western parts: and the Hermiones, _die Herumwohner_, the midland  inhabitants.    [24] It is however found in an inscription so far back as the year of  Rome 531, before Christ 222, recording the victory of Claudius Marcellus  over the Galli Insubres and their allies the Germans, at Clastidium, now  Chiastezzo in the Milanese.    [25] This is illustrated by a passage in Caesar, Bell. Gall. ii. 4,  where, after mentioning that several of the Belgae were descended from  the Germans who had formerly crossed the Rhine and expelled the Gauls,  he says, \"the first of these emigrants were the Condrusii, Eburones,  Caeresi and Paemani, who were called by the common name of Germans.\"  The derivation of German is _Wehr mann_, a warrior, or man of war. This  appellation was first used by the victorious Cisrhenane tribes, but not  by the whole Transrhenane nation, till they gradually adopted it, as  equally due to them on account of their military reputation. The Tungri  were formerly a people of great name, the relics of which still exist in  the extent of the district now termed the ancient diocese of Tongres.    [26] Under this name Tacitus speaks of some German deity, whose  attributes corresponded in the main with those of the Greek and  Roman Hercules. What he was called by the Germans is a matter of  doubt.--_White_.    [27] _Quem barditum vocant_. The word _barditus_ is of Gallic origin,  being derived from _bardi_, \"bards;\" it being a custom with the Gauls  for bards to accompany the army, and celebrate the heroic deeds of their  great warriors; so that _barditum_ would thus signify \"the fulfilment of  the bard's office.\" Hence it is clear that _barditum_ could not be used  correctly here, inasmuch as amongst the Germans not any particular,  appointed, body of men, but the whole army chanted forth the war-song.  Some editions have _baritum_, which is said to be derived from the  German word _beren_, or _baeren_, \"to shout;\" and hence it is translated  in some dictionaries as, \"the German war-song.\" From the following  passage extracted from Facciolati, it would seem, however, that German  critics repudiate this idea: \"De _barito_ clamore bellico, seu, ut  quaedam habent exemplaria, _bardito_, nihil audiuimus nunc in Germania:  nisi hoc dixerimus, quod _bracht_, vel _brecht_, milites Germani  appellare consueverunt; concursum videlicet certantium, et clamorem  ad pugnam descendentium; quem _bar, bar, bar_, sonuisse nonnulli  affirmant.\"--(Andr. Althameri, Schol. in C. Tacit De Germanis.) Ritter,  himself a German, affirms that _baritus_ is a reading worth nothing; and  that _barritus_ was not the name of the ancient German war-song, but  of the shout raised by the Romans in later ages when on the point  of engaging; and that it was derived \"a clamore barrorem, _i.e._  elephantorum.\" The same learned editor considers that the words \"quem  barditum vocant\" have been originally the marginal annotation of some  unsound scholar, and have been incorporated by some transcriber into the  text of his MS. copy, whence the error has spread. He therefore encloses  them between brackets, to show that, in his judgment, they are not the  genuine production of the pen of Tacitus.--_White_.    [28] A very curious coincidence with the ancient German opinion  concerning the prophetic nature of the war-cry or song, appears in the  following passage of the Life of Sir Ewen Cameron, in \"Pennant's Tour,\"  1769, Append, p. 363. At the battle of Killicrankie, just before the  fight began, \"he (Sir Ewen) commanded such of the Camerons as were  posted near him to make a great shout, which being seconded by those who  stood on the right and left, ran quickly through the whole army, and was  returned by the enemy. But the noise of the muskets and cannon, with the  echoing of the hills, made the Highlanders fancy that their shouts were  much louder and brisker than those of the enemy, and Lochiel cried out,  'Gentlemen, take courage, the day is ours: I am the oldest commander in  the army, and have always observed something ominous and fatal in such  a dull, hollow and feeble noise as the enemy made in their shout, which  prognosticates that they are all doomed to die by our hands this night;  whereas ours was brisk, lively and strong, and shows we have vigor and  courage.' These words, spreading quickly through the army, animated  the troops in a strange manner. The event justified the prediction; the  Highlanders obtained a complete victory.\"    [29] Now Asburg in the county of Meurs.    [30] The Greeks, by means of their colony at Marseilles, introduced  their letters into Gaul, and the old Gallic coins have many Greek  characters in their inscriptions. The Helvetians also, as we are  informed by Caesar, used Greek letters. Thence they might easily pass  by means of commercial intercourse to the neighboring Germans. Count  Marsili and others have found monuments with Greek inscriptions in  Germany, but not of so early an age.    [31] The large bodies of the Germans are elsewhere taken notice of by  Tacitus, and also by other authors. It would appear as if most of them  were at that time at least six feet high. They are still accounted some  of the tallest people in Europe.    [32] Bavaria and Austria.    [33] The greater degree of cold when the country was overspread with  woods and marshes, made this observation more applicable than at  present. The same change of temperature from clearing and draining  the land has taken place in North America. It may be added, that the  Germans, as we are afterwards informed, paid attention to no kind of  culture but that of corn.    [34] The cattle of some parts of Germany are at present remarkably  large; so that their former smallness must have rather been owing to  want of care in feeding them and protecting them from the inclemencies  of winter, and in improving the breed by mixtures, than to the nature of  the climate.    [35] Mines both of gold and silver have since been discovered in  Germany; the former, indeed, inconsiderable; but the latter, valuable.    [36] As vice and corruption advanced among the Romans, their money  became debased and adulterated. Thus Pliny, xxxiii. 3, relates, that  \"Livius Drusus during his tribuneship, mixed an eighth part of brass  with the silver coin;\" and ibid. 9, \"that Antony the triumvir mixed iron  with the denarius: that some coined base metal, others diminished  the pieces, and hence it became an art to prove the goodness of the  denarii.\" One precaution for this purpose was cutting the edges like  the teeth of a saw, by which means it was seen whether the metal was  the same quite through, or was only plated. These were the Serrati, or  serrated Denarii. The Bigati were those stamped with the figure of a  chariot drawn by two horses, as were the Quadrigati with a chariot and  four horses. These were old coin, of purer silver than those of the  emperors. Hence the preference of the Germans for certain kinds of  species was founded on their apprehension of being cheated with false  money.    [37] The Romans had the same predilection for silver coin, and probably  on the same account originally. Pliny, in the place above cited,  expresses his surprise that \"the Roman people had always imposed a  tribute in silver on conquered nations; as at the end of the second  Punic war, when they demanded an annual payment in silver for fifty  years, without any gold.\"    [38] Iron was in great abundance in the bowels of the earth; but this  barbarous people had neither patience, skill, nor industry to dig and  work it. Besides, they made use of weapons of stone, great numbers of  which are found in ancient tombs and barrows.    [39] This is supposed to take its name from _pfriem_ or _priem_, the  point of a weapon. Afterwards, when iron grew more plentiful, the  Germans chiefly used swords.    [40] It appears, however, from Tacitus's Annals, ii. 14, that the length  of these spears rendered them unmanageable in an engagement among trees  and bushes.    [41] Notwithstanding the manner of fighting is so much changed in modern  times, the arms of the ancients are still in use. We, as well as they,  have two kinds of swords, the sharp-pointed, and edged (small sword and  sabre). The broad lance subsisted till lately in the halberd; the spear  and framea in the long pike and spontoon; the missile weapons in the war  hatchet, or North American tomahawk. There are, besides, found in the  old German barrows, perforated stone balls, which they threw by means of  thongs passed through them.    [42] _Nudi_. The Latin nudus, like the Greek _gemnos_, does not point  out a person devoid of all clothing, but merely one without an upper  garment--clad merely in a vest or tunic, and that perhaps a short  one.--_White_.    [43] This decoration at first denoted the valor, afterwards the  nobility, of the bearer; and in process of time gave origin to the  armorial ensigns so famous in the ages of chivalry. The shields of the  private men were simply colored; those of the chieftains had the figures  of animals painted on them.    [44] Plutarch, in his Life of Marius, describes somewhat differently  the arms and equipage of the Cimbri. \"They wore (says he) helmets  representing the heads of wild beasts, and other unusual figures, and  crowned with a winged crest, to make them appear taller. They were  covered with iron coats of mail, and carried white glittering shields.  Each had a battle-axe; and in close fight they used large heavy swords.\"  But the learned Eccard justly observes, that they had procured these  arms in their march; for the Holsatian barrows of that age contain few  weapons of brass, and none of iron; but stone spear-heads, and instead  of swords, the"]]]
