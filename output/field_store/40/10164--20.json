In the State one must want nothing which is not an expression of  rationality. The State is the world which the spirit has made for  itself; it has therefore a determinate and self-conscious course. One  often speaks of the wisdom of God in nature, but one must not believe  that the physical world of nature is higher than the world of spirit.  Just as spirit is superior to nature, so is the State superior to the  physical life. We must therefore adore the State as the manifestation of  the divine on earth, and consider that, if it is difficult to comprehend  nature, it is infinitely harder to grasp the essence of the State. It is  an important fact that we, in modern times, have attained definite  insight into the State in general and are much engaged in discussing and  making constitutions; but that does not advance the problem much. It is  necessary to treat a rational matter in the light of reason, in order to  learn its essential nature and to know that the obvious does not always  constitute the essential.    When we speak of the different functions of the powers of the State, we  must not fall into the enormous error of supposing each power to have an  abstract, independent existence, since the powers are rather to be  differentiated as elements in the conception of the State. Were the  powers to be in abstract independence, however, it is clear that two  independent things could never constitute a unity, but must produce war,  and the result would be destruction of the whole or restoration of unity  by force. Thus, in the French Revolution, at one time the legislative  power had swallowed up the executive, at another time the executive had  usurped the legislative power.      THE CONSTITUTION    The constitution is rational, in so far as the State defines and  differentiates its functions according to the nature of its concept.    Who shall make the constitution? This question seems intelligible, yet  on closer examination reveals itself as meaningless, for it presupposes  the existence of no constitution, but only a mere mass of atomic  individuals. How a mass of individuals is to come by a constitution,  whether by its own efforts or by those of others, whether by goodness,  thought, or force, it must decide for itself, for with a disorganized  mob the concept of the State has nothing to do. But if the question does  presuppose an already existing constitution, then to make a constitution  means only to change it. The presupposition of a constitution implies,  however, at once, that any modification in it must take place  constitutionally. It is absolutely essential that the constitution,  though having a temporal origin, should not be regarded as made. It (the  principle of constitution) is rather to be conceived as absolutely  perpetual and rational, and therefore as divine, substantial, and above  and beyond the sphere of what is made.    Subjective freedom is the principle of the whole modern world--the  principle that all essential aspects of the spiritual totality should  develop and attain their right. From this point of view one can hardly  raise the idle question as to which form is the better, monarchy or  democracy. One can but say that the forms of all constitutions are  one-sided that are not able to tolerate the principle of free  subjectivity and that do not know how to conform to the fully developed  reason.    Since spirit is real only in what it knows itself to be, and since the  State, as the nation's spirit, is the law permeating all its affairs,  its ethical code, and the consciousness of its individuals, the  constitution of a people chiefly depends upon the kind and the character  of its self-consciousness. In it lies both its subjective freedom and  the reality of the constitution.    To think of giving a people a constitution _a priori_, though according  to its content a more or less rational one--such a whim would precisely  overlook that element which renders a constitution more than a mere  abstract object. Every nation, therefore, has the constitution which is  appropriate to it and belongs to it.    The State must, in its constitution, permeate all situations. A  constitution is not a thing just made; it is the work of centuries, the  idea and the consciousness of what is rational, in so far as it is  developed in a people. No constitution, therefore, is merely created by  the subjects of the State. The nation must feel that its constitution  embodies its right and its status, otherwise the constitution may exist  externally, but has no meaning or value. The need and the longing for a  better constitution may often indeed be present in individuals, but that  is quite different from the whole multitude being permeated with such an  idea--that comes much later. The principle of morality, the inwardness  of Socrates originated necessarily in his day, but it took time before  it could pass into general self-consciousness.      THE POWER OF THE PRINCE    Because sovereignty contains in ideal all special privileges, the common  misconception is quite natural, which takes it to be mere force, empty  caprice, and synonymous with despotism. But despotism means a state of  lawlessness, in which the particular will as such, whether that of  monarch or people (_ochlocracy_), is the law, or rather instead of the  law. Sovereignty, on the contrary, constitutes the element of ideality  of particular spheres and functions under lawful and constitutional  conditions.    The sovereignty of the people, conceived in opposition to the  sovereignty residing in the monarch, stands for the common view of  democracy, which has come to prevail in modern times. The idea of the  sovereignty of the people, taken in this opposition, belongs to a  confused idea of what is commonly and crudely understood by \"the  people.\" The people without its monarch and without that whole  organization necessarily and directly connected with him is a formless  mass, which is no longer a State. In a people, not conceived in a  lawless and unorganized condition, but as a self-developed and truly  organic totality--in such a people sovereignty is the personality of the  whole, and this is represented in reality by the person of the monarch.    The State must be regarded as a great architectonic edifice, a  hieroglyph of reason, manifesting itself in reality. Everything  referring merely to utility, externality, and the like, must be excluded  from its philosophic treatment. That the State is the self-determining  and the completely sovereign will, the final decision being necessarily  referred to it--that is easy to comprehend. The difficulty lies in  grasping this \"I will\" as a person. By this it is not meant that the  monarch can act arbitrarily. He is bound, in truth, by the concrete  content of the deliberations of his council, and, when the constitution  is stable, he has often nothing more to do than to sign his name--but  this name is important; it is the point than which there is nothing  higher.    It may be said that an organic State has already existed in the  beautiful democracy of Athens. The Greeks, however, derived the final  decision from entirely external phenomena, from oracles, entrails of  sacrificial animals, and from the flight of birds. Nature they  considered as a power which in this wise made known and gave expression  to what was good for the people. Self-consciousness had at that time not  yet attained to the abstraction of subjectivity; it had not yet come to  the realization that an \"I will\" must be pronounced by man himself  concerning the decisions of the State. This \"I will\" constitutes the  great difference between the ancient and the modern world, and must  therefore have its peculiar place in the great edifice of the State.  Unfortunately this modern characteristic is regarded as merely external  and arbitrary.    It is often maintained against the monarch that, since he may be  ill-educated or unworthy to stand at the helm of the State, its fortunes  are thus made to depend upon chance. It is therefore absurd to assume  the rationality of the institution of the monarch. The presupposition,  however, that the fortunes of the State depend upon the particular  character of the monarch is false. In the perfect organization of the  State the important thing is only the finality of formal decision and  the stability against passion. One must not therefore demand objective  qualification of the monarch; he has but to say \"yes\" and to put the dot  upon the \"i.\" The crown shall be of such a nature that the particular  character of its bearer is of no significance. Beyond his function of  administering the final decision, the monarch is a particular being who  is of no concern. Situations may indeed arise in which his particularity  alone asserts itself, but in that case the State is not yet fully  developed, or else is ill constructed. In a well-ordered monarchy the  law alone has objective power to which the monarch has but to affix the  subjective \"I will.\"    Monarchs do not excel in bodily strength or intellect, and yet millions  permit themselves to be ruled by them. To say that the people permit  themselves to be governed contrary to their interests, aims, and  intentions is preposterous, for people are not so stupid. It is their  need, it is the inner power of the idea, which, in opposition to their  apparent consciousness, urges them to this situation and retains them  therein.    Out of the sovereignty of the monarch flows the prerogative of pardoning  criminals. Only to the sovereignty belongs the spiritual power to undo  what has been done and to cancel the crime by forgiving and forgetting.    Pardon is the remission of punishment, but does not abolish right. Right  remains, and the pardoned is a criminal as he was before the pardon. The  act of mercy does not mean that no crime has been committed.

The  person who was taken out had no hat, but a handkerchief on his  head, and appeared to be intoxicated and helpless. They took him  to the other carriage and all got in. One of the men went back and  took something from the carriage they had left, which seemed to be  a jug, and then they drove off.    At the trial in question the testimony of a man by the name of  Giddins, who had the custody of old Fort Niagara, was not received  because it appeared he had no religious beliefs whatsoever, but  his brother-in-law testified that on a certain night in September,  shortly after the events narrated, he was staying at Giddins's  house, which was twenty or thirty rods from the magazine of the  old fort; that before going to the installation of the lodge at  Lewiston he went with Giddins to the magazine. Previously to  starting out Giddins had a pistol, which he requested the witness  to carry, but witness declined. Giddins had something else with  him, which the witness did not recognize. When they came within  about two rods of the magazine, Giddins went up to the door and  something was said inside the door. A man's voice came from inside  the magazine; witness was alarmed, and thought he had better get  out of the way, and he at once retreated, followed soon after by  Giddins.    From the old records it seemed that the evidence tracing Morgan to  the magazine of old Fort Niagara was satisfactory to court and  jury; but what became of him no man knows. In January, 1827, the  fort and magazine were visited by certain committees appointed to  make investigations, who reported in detail the condition of the  magazine, which seemed to indicate that some one had been confined  therein not long before, and that the prisoner had made violent  and reiterated efforts to force his way out. A good many hearsay  statements were taken to the effect that Morgan was as a matter of  fact put in the magazine and kept there some days.    Governor De Witt Clinton issued three proclamations, two soon  after September, 1826, and the last dated March 19, 1827, offering  rewards for \"Authentic information of the place where the said  William Morgan has been conveyed,\" and \"for the discovery of the  said William Morgan, if alive; and, if murdered, a reward of two  thousand dollars for the discovery of the offender or offenders,  etc.\"    In the autumn of 1827 a body was cast up on the shore of Lake  Ontario near the mouth of Oak Orchard Creek. Mrs. Morgan and a Dr.  Strong identified the body as that of William Morgan by a scar on  the foot and by the teeth.    The identification was disputed; the disappearance of Morgan was  then a matter of politics, and the anti-masons, headed by Thurlow  Weed, originated the saying, \"It's a good enough Morgan for us  until you produce the live one,\" which afterwards become current  political slang in the form, \"It's a good enough Morgan until  after election.\"          CHAPTER NINE THROUGH WESTERN NEW YORK  IN THE MUD    The afternoon was drawing to a close, the rain had partially  subsided, but the trees were heavy with water, and the streets ran  rivulets.    Prudence would seem to dictate remaining in Le Roy over-night,  but, so far as roads are concerned, it is always better to start  out in, or immediately after, a rain than to wait until the water  has soaked in and made the mud deep. A heavy rain washes the  surface off the roads; it is better not to give it time to  penetrate; we therefore determined to start at once.    There was not a soul on the streets as we pulled out a few moments  after five o'clock, and in the entire ride of some thirty miles we  met scarcely more than three or four teams.    We took the road by Bergen rather than through Caledonia; both  roads are good, but in very wet weather the road from Bergen to  Rochester is apt to be better than that from Caledonia, as it is  more sandy.    To Bergen, eight miles, we found hard gravel, with one steep hill  to descend; from Bergen in, it was sandy, and after the rain, was  six inches deep in places with soft mud.    It was slow progress and eight o'clock when we pulled into  Rochester.    We were given rooms where all the noises of street and trolley  could be heard to best advantage; sleep was a struggle, rest an  impossibility.    Hotel construction has quite kept pace with the times, but hotel  location is a tradition of the dark ages, when to catch patrons it  was necessary to get in their way.    At Syracuse the New York Central passes through the principal  hotels,--the main tracks bisecting the dining-rooms, with side  tracks down each corridor and a switch in each bed-room; but this  is an extreme instance.    It was well enough in olden times to open taverns on the highways;  an occasional coach would furnish the novelty and break the  monotony, but people could sleep.    The erection of hotels in close proximity to railroad tracks, or  upon the main thoroughfares of cities where stone or asphalt  pavements resound to every hoof-fall, and where street cars go  whirring and clanging by all night long, is something more than an  anachronism; it is a fiendish disregard of human comfort.    Paradoxical as it may seem,--a pious but garrulous old gentleman  was one time invited to lead in prayer; consenting, he approached  the throne of grace with becoming humility, saying, \"Paradoxical  as it may seem, O Lord, it is nevertheless true,\" etc., the phrase  is a good one, it lingers in the ear,--therefore, once more,  --paradoxical as it may seem, it is nevertheless true that those  who go about all day in machines do not like to be disturbed by  machines at night.    We soon learned to keep away from the cities at night. It is so  much more delightful to stop in smaller towns and villages; your  host is glad to see you; you are quite the guest of honor, perhaps  the only guest; there is a place in the adjoining stable for the  machine; the men are interested, and only too glad to care for it  and help in the morning; the best the house affords is offered; as  a rule the rooms are quite good, the beds clean, and nowadays many  of these small hotels have rooms with baths; the table is plain;  but while automobiling one soon comes to prefer plain country  living.    In the larger cities it costs a fortune in tips before the machine  and oneself are well housed; to enter Albany, Boston, or New York  at night, find your hotel, find the automobile station, find your  luggage, and find yourself, is a bore.    No one who has ever ridden day after day in the country cares  anything about riding in cities; it is as artificial and  monotonous as riding a hunter over pavements. If one could just  approach a city at night, steal into it, enjoy its lights and  shadows, its confusion and strange sounds, all in passing, and  slip through without stopping long enough to feel the thrust of  the reality, it would be delightful. But the charm disappears, the  dream is brought to earth, the vision becomes tinsel when you draw  up in front of a big caravansary and a platoon of uniformed  porters, bell-boys, and pages swoop down upon everything you have,  including your pocket-book; then the Olympian clerk looks at you  doubtfully, puzzled for the first time in his life, does not know  whether you are a mill-hand from Pittsburgh who should be assigned  a hall bed-room in the annex, or a millionaire from Newport who  should be tendered the entire establishment on a silver platter.    The direct road from Rochester to Syracuse is by way of Pittsford,  Palmyra, Newark, Lyons, Clyde, Port Byron, and Camillus, but it is  neither so good nor so interesting as the old roads through Geneva  and Auburn.    In going from Buffalo to Albany _via_ Syracuse, Rochester is to  the north and some miles out of the way; unless one especially  desires to visit the city, it is better to leave it to one side.  Genesee Street out of Buffalo is Genesee Street into Syracuse and  Utica; it is the old highway between Buffalo and Albany, and may  be followed to-day from end to end.    Instead of turning to the northeast at Batavia and going through  Newkirk, Byron, Bergen, North Chili, and Gates to Rochester, keep  more directly east through Le Roy, Caledonia, Avon, and  Canandaigua to Geneva; the towns are old, the hotels, most of  them, good, the roads are generally gravel and the country  interesting; it is old New York. No one driving through the State  for pleasure would think of taking the direct road from Rochester  to Syracuse; the beautiful portions of this western end of the  State are to the south, in the Genesee and Wyoming Valleys, and  through the lake region.    We left Rochester at ten o'clock, Saturday, the 24th, intending to  go east by Egypt, Macedon, Palmyra,--the Oriental route, as my  companion called it; but after leaving Pittsford we missed the  road and lost ourselves among the hills, finding several grades so  steep and soft that we both were obliged to dismount.    An old resident was decidedly of the opinion that the roads to the  southeast were better than those to the northeast, and we turned  from the Nile route towards Canandaigua.    Though the roads were decidedly better, in many places being well  gravelled, the heavy rains of the previous two days made the going  slow, and it was one-thirty before we pulled up at the old hotel  in Canandaigua for dinner.    As the machine had been there before, we were greeted as friends.  The old negro porter is a character,--quite the irresponsible head  of the entire establishment.    \"Law's sakes! you heah agen? glad to see you; whar you come from  dis time? Rochester! No, foh sure?--dis mawning?--you doan say so;  that jes' beats me; to think I live to see a thing like that; it's  a reg'lar steam-engine, aint it?\"    \"Sambo,\" called out a bystander, making"]]]
