I'm not fond of fighting, but when I begin I don't  like to stop,\" and he smiled grimly. \"You'd better not follow us.\"    \"We'll do as we please,\" shouted the third member of the trio on the  deck of the other boat, which, as Tom could see, was named the Wonder.  \"We intend to get that gold if we can.\"    \"All right. I've warned you,\" went on the sailor, and then, motioning  to Tom and his father to follow, he went below.    \"Well, what's to be done?\" asked Mr. Swift when they were seated in the  living-room, and had informed the others of the presence of the rival  submarine.    \"The only thing I see to do is to sneak away unobserved, go as deep as  possible, and make all haste for the wreck,\" advised the captain. \"They  will depend on us, for they have evidently no chart of the wreck,  though of course the general location of it may be known to them from  reading the papers. I hoped I had thrown them off the track by the  false chart I dropped, but it seems they were too smart for us.\"    \"Have they a right to follow us?\" asked Tom.    \"Legally, but not morally. We can't prevent them, I'm afraid. The only  thing to do is to get there ahead of them.  It will be a race for the  sunken treasure, and we must get there first.\"    \"What do you propose doing, captain?\" asked Mr. Damon.  \"Bless my  shirt-studs, but can't we pull their ship up on the island and leave it  there?\"    \"I'm afraid such high-handed proceedings would hardly answer,\" replied  Mr. Swift. \"No, as Captain Weston says, we must get there ahead of  them. What do you think will be the best scheme, captain?\"    \"Well, there's no need for us to forego our plan to get fresh water.  Suppose we go to the island, that is, some of us, leaving a guard on  board here. We'll fill our tanks with fresh water, and at night we'll  quietly sink below the surface and speed away.\"    They all voted that an excellent idea, and little time was lost putting  it into operation.    All the remainder of that day not a sign of life was visible about the  Wonder. She lay inert on the surface of the lagoon, not far away from  the Advance; but, though no one showed himself on the deck, Tom and his  friends had no doubt but that their enemies were closely watching them.    As dusk settled down over the tropical sea, and as the shadows of the  trees on the little island lengthened, those on board the Advance  closed the Conning tower. No lights were turned on, as they did not  want their movements to be seen, but Tom, his father and Mr. Sharp took  their positions near the various machines and apparatus, ready to open  the tanks and let the submarine sink to the bottom, as soon as it was  possible to do this unobserved.    \"Luckily there's no moon,\" remarked Captain Weston, as he took his  place beside Tom. \"Once below the surface and we can defy them to find  us. It is odd how they traced us, but I suppose that steamer gave them  the clue.\"    It rapidly grew dark, as it always does in the tropics, and when a  cautious observation from the conning tower did not disclose the  outlines of the other boat, those aboard the Advance rightly concluded  that their rivals were unable to see them.    \"Send her down, Tom,\" called his father, and with a hiss the water  entered the tanks. The submarine quickly sank below the surface, aided  by the deflecting rudder.    But alas for the hopes of the gold-seekers. No sooner was she  completely submerged, with the engine started so as to send her out of  the lagoon and to the open sea, than the waters all about were made  brilliant by the phosphorescent phenomenon. In southern waters this  frequently occurs.  Millions of tiny creatures, which, it is said,  swarm in the warm currents, give an appearance of fire to the ocean,  and any object moving through it can plainly be seen. It was so with  the Advance. The motion she made in shooting forward, and the  undulations caused by her submersion, seemed to start into activity the  dormant phosphorus, and the submarine was afloat in a sea of fire.    \"Quick!\" cried Tom. \"Speed her up! Maybe we can get out of this patch  of water before they see us.\"    But it was too late. Above them they could hear the electric siren of  the Wonder as it was blown to let them know that their escape had been  noticed. A moment later the water, which acted as a sort of  sounding-board, or telephone, brought to the ears of Tom Swift and his  friends the noise of the engines of the other craft in operation.  She  was coming after them. The race for the possession of three hundred  thousand dollars in gold was already under way. Fate seemed against  those on board the Advance.          Chapter Seventeen    The Race      Directed by Captain Weston, who glanced at the compass and told him  which way to steer to clear the outer coral reef, Tom sent the  submarine ahead, signaling for full speed to the engine-room, where his  father and Mr. Sharp were. The big dynamos purred like great cats, as  they sent the electrical energy into the forward and aft plates,  pulling and pushing the Advance forward. On and on she rushed under  water, but ever as she shot ahead the disturbance in the phosphorescent  water showed her position plainly. She would be easy to follow.    \"Can't you get any more speed out of her?\" asked the captain of the lad.    \"Yes,\" was the quick reply; \"by using the auxiliary screws I think we  can. I'll try it.\"    He signaled for the propellers, forward and aft, to be put in  operation, and the motor moving the twin screws was turned on. At once  there was a perceptible increase to the speed of the Advance.    \"Are we leaving them behind?\" asked Tom anxiously, as he glanced at the  speed gage, and noted that the submarine was now about five hundred  feet below the surface.    \"Hard to tell,\" replied the Captain. \"You'd have to take an observation  to make sure.\"    \"I'll do it,\" cried the youth. \"You steer, please, and I'll go in the  conning tower. I can look forward and aft there, as well as straight  up. Maybe I can see the Wonder.\"    Springing up the circular ladder leading into the tower, Tom glanced  through the windows all about the small pilot house. He saw a curious  sight. It was as if the submarine was in a sea of yellowish liquid  fire. She was immersed in water which glowed with the flames that  contained no heat.  So light was it, in fact, that there was no need of  the incandescents in the tower. The young inventor could have seen to  read a paper by the illumination of the phosphorus.  But he had  something else to do than observe this phenomenon. He wanted to see if  he could catch sight of the rival submarine.    At first he could make out nothing save the swirl and boiling of the  sea, caused by the progress of the Advance through it. But suddenly, as  he looked up, he was aware of some great, black body a little to the  rear and about ten feet above his craft.    \"A shark!\" he exclaimed aloud. \"An immense one, too.\"    But the closer he looked the less it seemed like a shark.  The position  of the black object changed. It appeared to settle down, to be  approaching the top of the conning tower.  Then, with a suddenness that  unnerved him for the time being, Tom recognized what it was; it was the  underside of a ship. He could see the plates riveted together, and  then, as he noted the rounded, cylindrical shape, he knew that it was a  submarine. It was the Wonder. She was close at hand and was creeping up  on the Advance. But, what was more dangerous, she seemed to be slowly  settling in the water.  Another moment and her great screws might crash  into the Conning tower of the Swifts' boat and shave it off. Then the  water would rush in, drowning the treasure-seekers like rats in a trap.    With a quick motion Tom yanked over the lever that allowed more water  to flow into the ballast tanks. The effect was at once apparent. The  Advance shot down toward the bottom of the sea. At the same time the  young inventor signaled to Captain Weston to notify those in the  engine-room to put on a little more speed. The Advance fairly leaped  ahead, and the lad, looking up through the bull's-eye in the roof of  the conning tower, had the satisfaction of seeing the rival submarine  left behind.    The youth hurried down into the interior of the ship to tell what he  had seen, and explain the reason for opening the ballast tanks. He  found his father and Mr. Sharp somewhat excited over the unexpected  maneuver of the craft.    \"So they're still following us,\" murmured Mr. Swift. \"I don't see why  we can't shake them off.\"    \"It's on account of this luminous water,\" explained Captain Weston.  \"Once we are clear of that it will be easy, I think, to give them the  slip. That is, if we can get out of their sight long enough. Of course,  if they keep close after us, they can pick us up with their  searchlight, for I suppose they carry one.\"    \"Yes,\" admitted the aged inventor, \"they have as strong a one as we  have. In fact, their ship is second only to this one in speed and  power. I know, for Bentley & Eagert showed me some of the plans before  they started it, and asked my opinion. This was before I had the notion  of building a submarine. Yes, I am afraid we'll have trouble getting  away from them.\"    \"I can't understand this phosphorescent glow keeping up so long,\"  remarked Captain Weston. \"I've seen it in this locality several times,  but it never covered such an extent of the ocean in my time.  There  must be changed conditions here now.\"    For an hour or more the race was kept up, and the two submarines forged  ahead through the glowing sea. The Wonder remained slightly above and  to the rear of the other, the better to keep sight of her, and though  the Advance was run to her limit of speed, her rival could not be  shaken off.  Clearly the Wonder was a speedy craft.    \"It's too bad that we've got to fight them, as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/95"],[0,"The Prisoner of Zenda (#16)"],[1,"considerable numbers), really because it brought us within striking  distance of the Duke of Strelsau's more magnificent dwelling on the  other side of the town. A large party of servants, with horses and  luggage, started early in the morning; we followed at midday, travelling  by train for thirty miles, and then mounting our horses to ride the  remaining distance to the chateau.    We were a gallant party. Besides Sapt and Fritz, I was accompanied by  ten gentlemen: every one of them had been carefully chosen, and no less  carefully sounded, by my two friends, and all were devotedly attached to  the person of the King. They were told a part of the truth; the attempt  on my life in the summer-house was revealed to them, as a spur to their  loyalty and an incitement against Michael. They were also informed that  a friend of the King's was suspected to be forcibly confined within the  Castle of Zenda. His rescue was one of the objects of the expedition;  but, it was added, the King's main desire was to carry into effect  certain steps against his treacherous brother, as to the precise nature  of which they could not at present be further enlightened. Enough that  the King commanded their services, and would rely on their devotion when  occasion arose to call for it. Young, well-bred, brave, and loyal, they  asked no more: they were ready to prove their dutiful obedience, and  prayed for a fight as the best and most exhilarating mode of showing it.    Thus the scene was shifted from Strelsau to the chateau of Tarlenheim  and Castle of Zenda, which frowned at us across the valley. I tried to  shift my thoughts also, to forget my love, and to bend all my energies  to the task before me. It was to get the King out of the Castle alive.  Force was useless: in some trick lay the chance; and I had already an  inkling of what we must do. But I was terribly hampered by the publicity  which attended my movements. Michael must know by now of my expedition;  and I knew Michael too well to suppose that his eyes would be blinded by  the feint of the boar-hunt. He would understand very well what the real  quarry was. That, however, must be risked--that and all it might mean;  for Sapt, no less than myself, recognized that the present state of  things had become unendurable. And there was one thing that I dared to  calculate on--not, as I now know, without warrant. It was this--that  Black Michael would not believe that I meant well by the King. He could  not appreciate--I will not say an honest man, for the thoughts of my  own heart have been revealed--but a man acting honestly. He saw  my opportunity as I had seen it, as Sapt had seen it; he knew the  princess--nay (and I declare that a sneaking sort of pity for him  invaded me), in his way he loved her; he would think that Sapt and Fritz  could be bribed, so the bribe was large enough. Thinking thus, would he  kill the King, my rival and my danger? Ay, verily, that he would, with  as little compunction as he would kill a rat. But he would kill Rudolf  Rassendyll first, if he could; and nothing but the certainty of being  utterly damned by the release of the King alive and his restoration to  the throne would drive him to throw away the trump card which he held in  reserve to baulk the supposed game of the impudent impostor Rassendyll.  Musing on all this as I rode along, I took courage.    Michael knew of my coming, sure enough. I had not been in the house an  hour, when an imposing Embassy arrived from him. He did not quite reach  the impudence of sending my would-be assassins, but he sent the other  three of his famous Six--the three Ruritanian gentlemen--Lauengram,  Krafstein, and Rupert Hentzau. A fine, strapping trio they were,  splendidly horsed and admirably equipped. Young Rupert, who looked  a dare-devil, and could not have been more than twenty-two or  twenty-three, took the lead, and made us the neatest speech, wherein  my devoted subject and loving brother Michael of Strelsau, prayed me to  pardon him for not paying his addresses in person, and, further, for not  putting his Castle at my disposal; the reason for both of these apparent  derelictions being that he and several of his servants lay sick of  scarlet fever, and were in a very sad, and also a very infectious state.  So declared young Rupert with an insolent smile on his curling upper lip  and a toss of his thick hair--he was a handsome villain, and the gossip  ran that many a lady had troubled her heart for him already.    \"If my brother has scarlet fever,\" said I, \"he is nearer my complexion  than he is wont to be, my lord. I trust he does not suffer?\"    \"He is able to attend to his affairs, sire.\"    \"I hope all beneath your roof are not sick. What of my good friends, De  Gautet, Bersonin, and Detchard? I heard the last had suffered a hurt.\"    Lauengram and Krafstein looked glum and uneasy, but young Rupert's smile  grew broader.    \"He hopes soon to find a medicine for it, sire,\" he answered.    And I burst out laughing, for I knew what medicine Detchard longed  for--it is called Revenge.    \"You will dine with us, gentlemen?\" I asked.    Young Rupert was profuse in apologies. They had urgent duties at the  Castle.    \"Then,\" said I, with a wave of my hand, \"to our next meeting, gentlemen.  May it make us better acquainted.\"    \"We will pray your Majesty for an early opportunity,\" quoth Rupert  airily; and he strode past Sapt with such jeering scorn on his face that  I saw the old fellow clench his fist and scowl black as night.    For my part, if a man must needs be a knave, I would have him a debonair  knave, and I liked Rupert Hentzau better than his long-faced, close-eyed  companions. It makes your sin no worse, as I conceive, to do it a la  mode and stylishly.    Now it was a curious thing that on this first night, instead of eating  the excellent dinner my cooks had prepared for me, I must needs leave my  gentlemen to eat it alone, under Sapt's presiding care, and ride myself  with Fritz to the town of Zenda and a certain little inn that I knew  of. There was little danger in the excursion; the evenings were long and  light, and the road this side of Zenda well frequented. So off we rode,  with a groom behind us. I muffled myself up in a big cloak.    \"Fritz,\" said I, as we entered the town, \"there's an uncommonly pretty  girl at this inn.\"    \"How do you know?\" he asked.    \"Because I've been there,\" said I.    \"Since--?\" he began.    \"No. Before,\" said I.    \"But they'll recognize you?\"    \"Well, of course they will. Now, don't argue, my good fellow, but listen  to me. We're two gentlemen of the King's household, and one of us has a  toothache. The other will order a private room and dinner, and, further,  a bottle of the best wine for the sufferer. And if he be as clever a  fellow as I take him for, the pretty girl and no other will wait on us.\"    \"What if she won't?\" objected Fritz.    \"My dear Fritz,\" said I, \"if she won't for you, she will for me.\"    We were at the inn. Nothing of me but my eyes was visible as I walked  in. The landlady received us; two minutes later, my little friend (ever,  I fear me, on the look-out for such guests as might prove amusing) made  her appearance. Dinner and the wine were ordered. I sat down in the  private room. A minute later Fritz came in.    \"She's coming,\" he said.    \"If she were not, I should have to doubt the Countess Helga's taste.\"    She came in. I gave her time to set the wine down--I didn't want it  dropped. Fritz poured out a glass and gave it to me.    \"Is the gentleman in great pain?\" the girl asked, sympathetically.    \"The gentleman is no worse than when he saw you last,\" said I, throwing  away my cloak.    She started, with a little shriek. Then she cried:    \"It was the King, then! I told mother so the moment I saw his picture.  Oh, sir, forgive me!\"    \"Faith, you gave me nothing that hurt much,\" said I.    \"But the things we said!\"    \"I forgive them for the thing you did.\"    \"I must go and tell mother.\"    \"Stop,\" said I, assuming a graver air. \"We are not here for sport  tonight. Go and bring dinner, and not a word of the King being here.\"    She came back in a few minutes, looking grave, yet very curious.    \"Well, how is Johann?\" I asked, beginning my dinner.    \"Oh, that fellow, sir--my lord King, I mean!\"    \"'Sir' will do, please. How is he?\"    \"We hardly see him now, sir.\"    \"And why not?\"    \"I told him he came too often, sir,\" said she, tossing her head.    \"So he sulks and stays away?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"But you could bring him back?\" I suggested with a smile.    \"Perhaps I could,\" said she.    \"I know your powers, you see,\" said I, and she blushed with pleasure.    \"It's not only that, sir, that keeps him away. He's very busy at the  Castle.\"    \"But there's no shooting on now.\"    \"No, sir; but he's in charge of the house.\"    \"Johann turned housemaid?\"    The little girl was brimming over with gossip.    \"Well, there are no others,\" said she. \"There's not a woman there--not  as a servant, I mean. They do say--but perhaps it's false, sir.\"    \"Let's have it for what it's worth,\" said I.    \"Indeed, I'm ashamed to tell you, sir.\"    \"Oh, see, I'm looking at the ceiling.\"    \"They do say there is a lady there, sir; but, except for her, there's  not a woman in the place. And Johann has to wait on the gentlemen.\"    \"Poor Johann! He must be overworked. Yet I'm sure he could find half an  hour to come and see you.\"    \"It would depend on the time, sir, perhaps.\"    \"Do you love him?\" I asked.    \"Not I, sir.\"    \"And you wish to serve the King?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Then tell him to meet you at the second milestone out of Zenda tomorrow  evening at ten o'clock. Say you'll be there and will walk home with  him.\"    \"Do you mean him harm, sir?\"    \"Not if he will do as I bid him. But I think I've told you enough, my  pretty maid. See that you do as I bid you. And, mind, no one is to know  that the King has been here.\"   "]]]
