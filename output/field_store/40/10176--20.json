[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12629"],[0,"Language: An Introduction to the Study of Speech (#17)"],[1,"reduplication of our older Indo-European languages,  which helps to form the perfect tense of many verbs (e.g., Sanskrit  _dadarsha_ \"I have seen,\" Greek _leloipa_ \"I have left,\" Latin _tetigi_  \"I have touched,\" Gothic _lelot_ \"I have let\"). In Nootka reduplication  of the radical element is often employed in association with certain  suffixes; e.g., _hluch-_ \"woman\" forms _hluhluch-'ituhl_ \"to dream of a  woman,\" _hluhluch-k'ok_ \"resembling a woman.\" Psychologically similar to  the Greek and Latin examples are many Takelma cases of verbs that  exhibit two forms of the stem, one employed in the present or past, the  other in the future and in certain modes and verbal derivatives. The  former has final reduplication, which is absent in the latter; e.g.,  _al-yebeb-i'n_ \"I show (or showed) to him,\" _al-yeb-in_ \"I shall show  him.\"    [Footnote 50: An Indian language of Nevada.]    [Footnote 51: An Indian language of Oregon.]    We come now to the subtlest of all grammatical processes, variations in  accent, whether of stress or pitch. The chief difficulty in isolating  accent as a functional process is that it is so often combined with  alternations in vocalic quantity or quality or complicated by the  presence of affixed elements that its grammatical value appears as a  secondary rather than as a primary feature. In Greek, for instance, it  is characteristic of true verbal forms that they throw the accent back  as far as the general accentual rules will permit, while nouns may be  more freely accented. There is thus a striking accentual difference  between a verbal form like _eluthemen_ \"we were released,\" accented on  the second syllable of the word, and its participial derivative  _lutheis_ \"released,\" accented on the last. The presence of the  characteristic verbal elements _e-_ and _-men_ in the first case and of  the nominal _-s_ in the second tends to obscure the inherent value of  the accentual alternation. This value comes out very neatly in such  English doublets as _to refund_ and _a refund_, _to extract_ and _an  extract, to come down_ and _a come down_, _to lack luster_ and  _lack-luster eyes_, in which the difference between the verb and the  noun is entirely a matter of changing stress. In the Athabaskan  languages there are not infrequently significant alternations of accent,  as in Navaho _ta-di-gis_ \"you wash yourself\" (accented on the second  syllable), _ta-di-gis_ \"he washes himself\" (accented on the first).[52]    [Footnote 52: It is not unlikely, however, that these Athabaskan  alternations are primarily tonal in character.]    Pitch accent may be as functional as stress and is perhaps more often  so. The mere fact, however, that pitch variations are phonetically  essential to the language, as in Chinese (e.g., _feng_ \"wind\" with a  level tone, _feng_ \"to serve\" with a falling tone) or as in classical  Greek (e.g., _lab-on_ \"having taken\" with a simple or high tone on the  suffixed participial _-on_, _gunaik-on_ \"of women\" with a compound or  falling tone on the case suffix _-on_) does not necessarily constitute a  functional, or perhaps we had better say grammatical, use of pitch. In  such cases the pitch is merely inherent in the radical element or affix,  as any vowel or consonant might be. It is different with such Chinese  alternations as _chung_ (level) \"middle\" and _chung_ (falling) \"to hit  the middle\"; _mai_ (rising) \"to buy\" and _mai_ (falling) \"to sell\";  _pei_ (falling) \"back\" and _pei_ (level) \"to carry on the back.\"  Examples of this type are not exactly common in Chinese and the language  cannot be said to possess at present a definite feeling for tonal  differences as symbolic of the distinction between noun and verb.    There are languages, however, in which such differences are of the most  fundamental grammatical importance. They are particularly common in the  Soudan. In Ewe, for instance, there are formed from _subo_ \"to serve\"  two reduplicated forms, an infinitive _subosubo_ \"to serve,\" with a low  tone on the first two syllables and a high one on the last two, and an  adjectival _subosubo_ \"serving,\" in which all the syllables have a high  tone. Even more striking are cases furnished by Shilluk, one of the  languages of the headwaters of the Nile. The plural of the noun often  differs in tone from the singular, e.g., _yit_ (high) \"ear\" but _yit_  (low) \"ears.\" In the pronoun three forms may be distinguished by tone  alone; _e_ \"he\" has a high tone and is subjective, _-e_ \"him\" (e.g., _a  chwol-e_ \"he called him\") has a low tone and is objective, _-e_ \"his\"  (e.g., _wod-e_ \"his house\") has a middle tone and is possessive. From  the verbal element _gwed-_ \"to write\" are formed _gwed-o_ \"(he) writes\"  with a low tone, the passive _gwet_ \"(it was) written\" with a falling  tone, the imperative _gwet_ \"write!\" with a rising tone, and the verbal  noun _gwet_ \"writing\" with a middle tone. In aboriginal America also  pitch accent is known to occur as a grammatical process. A good example  of such a pitch language is Tlingit, spoken by the Indians of the  southern coast of Alaska. In this language many verbs vary the tone of  the radical element according to tense; _hun_ \"to sell,\" _sin_ \"to  hide,\" _tin_ \"to see,\" and numerous other radical elements, if  low-toned, refer to past time, if high-toned, to the future. Another  type of function is illustrated by the Takelma forms _hel_ \"song,\" with  falling pitch, but _hel_ \"sing!\" with a rising inflection; parallel to  these forms are _sel_ (falling) \"black paint,\" _sel_ (rising) \"paint  it!\" All in all it is clear that pitch accent, like stress and vocalic  or consonantal modifications, is far less infrequently employed as a  grammatical process than our own habits of speech would prepare us to  believe probable.          V    FORM IN LANGUAGE: GRAMMATICAL CONCEPTS      We have seen that the single word expresses either a simple concept or a  combination of concepts so interrelated as to form a psychological  unity. We have, furthermore, briefly reviewed from a strictly formal  standpoint the main processes that are used by all known languages to  affect the fundamental concepts--those embodied in unanalyzable words or  in the radical elements of words--by the modifying or formative  influence of subsidiary concepts. In this chapter we shall look a little  more closely into the nature of the world of concepts, in so far as that  world is reflected and systematized in linguistic structure.    Let us begin with a simple sentence that involves various kinds of  concepts--_the farmer kills the duckling_. A rough and ready analysis  discloses here the presence of three distinct and fundamental concepts  that are brought into connection with each other in a number of ways.  These three concepts are \"farmer\" (the subject of discourse), \"kill\"  (defining the nature of the activity which the sentence informs us  about), and \"duckling\" (another subject[53] of discourse that takes an  important though somewhat passive part in this activity). We can  visualize the farmer and the duckling and we have also no difficulty in  constructing an image of the killing. In other words, the elements  _farmer_, _kill_, and _duckling_ define concepts of a concrete order.    [Footnote 53: Not in its technical sense.]    But a more careful linguistic analysis soon brings us to see that the  two subjects of discourse, however simply we may visualize them, are not  expressed quite as directly, as immediately, as we feel them. A \"farmer\"  is in one sense a perfectly unified concept, in another he is \"one who  farms.\" The concept conveyed by the radical element (_farm-_) is not one  of personality at all but of an industrial activity (_to farm_), itself  based on the concept of a particular type of object (_a farm_).  Similarly, the concept of _duckling_ is at one remove from that which is  expressed by the radical element of the word, _duck_. This element,  which may occur as an independent word, refers to a whole class of  animals, big and little, while _duckling_ is limited in its application  to the young of that class. The word _farmer_ has an \"agentive\" suffix  _-er_ that performs the function of indicating the one that carries out  a given activity, in this case that of farming. It transforms the verb  _to farm_ into an agentive noun precisely as it transforms the verbs _to  sing_, _to paint_, _to teach_ into the corresponding agentive nouns  _singer_, _painter_, _teacher_. The element _-ling_ is not so freely  used, but its significance is obvious. It adds to the basic concept the  notion of smallness (as also in _gosling_, _fledgeling_) or the somewhat  related notion of \"contemptible\" (as in _weakling_, _princeling_,  _hireling_). The agentive _-er_ and the diminutive _-ling_ both convey  fairly concrete ideas (roughly those of \"doer\" and \"little\"), but the  concreteness is not stressed. They do not so much define distinct  concepts as mediate between concepts. The _-er_ of _farmer_ does not  quite say \"one who (farms)\" it merely indicates that the sort of person  we call a \"farmer\" is closely enough associated with activity on a farm  to be conventionally thought of as always so occupied. He may, as a  matter of fact, go to town and engage in any pursuit but farming, yet  his linguistic label remains \"farmer.\" Language here betrays a certain  helplessness or, if one prefers, a stubborn tendency to look away from  the immediately suggested function, trusting to the imagination and to  usage to fill in the transitions of thought and the details of  application that distinguish one concrete concept (_to farm_) from  another \"derived\" one (_farmer_). It would be impossible for any  language to express every concrete idea by an independent word or  radical element. The concreteness of experience is infinite, the  resources of the richest language are strictly limited. It must perforce  throw countless concepts under the rubric of certain basic ones,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1265"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#17)"],[1,"arrive in the autumn, and by July her uneasiness was intense.  She determined to write to her uncle, in order to make her position  clear. It must be understood she said, that \"there is no no engagement  between us.\" If she should like Albert, she could \"make no final promise  this year, for, at the very earliest, any such event could not take  place till two or three years hence.\" She had, she said, \"a great  repugnance\" to change her present position; and, if she should not like  him, she was \"very anxious that it should be understood that she would  not be guilty of any breach of promise, for she never gave any.\" To Lord  Melbourne she was more explicit. She told him that she \"had no great  wish to see Albert, as the whole subject was an odious one;\" she hated  to have to decide about it; and she repeated once again that seeing  Albert would be \"a disagreeable thing.\" But there was no escaping the  horrid business; the visit must be made, and she must see him. The  summer slipped by and was over; it was the autumn already; on the  evening of October 10 Albert, accompanied by his brother Ernest, arrived  at Windsor.    Albert arrived; and the whole structure of her existence crumbled into  nothingness like a house of cards. He was beautiful--she gasped--she  knew no more. Then, in a flash, a thousand mysteries were revealed to  her; the past, the present, rushed upon her with a new significance; the  delusions of years were abolished, and an extraordinary, an irresistible  certitude leapt into being in the light of those blue eyes, the smile  of that lovely mouth. The succeeding hours passed in a rapture. She was  able to observe a few more details--the \"exquisite nose,\" the \"delicate  moustachios and slight but very slight whiskers,\" the \"beautiful figure,  broad in the shoulders and a fine waist.\" She rode with him, danced with  him, talked with him, and it was all perfection. She had no shadow of  a doubt. He had come on a Thursday evening, and on the following Sunday  morning she told Lord Melbourne that she had \"a good deal changed her  opinion as to marrying.\" Next morning, she told him that she had made  up her mind to marry Albert. The morning after that, she sent for her  cousin. She received him alone, and \"after a few minutes I said to him  that I thought he must be aware why I wished them to come here--and  that it would make me too happy if he would consent to what I wished  (to marry me.)\" Then \"we embraced each other, and he was so kind, so  affectionate.\" She said that she was quite unworthy of him, while he  murmured that he would be very happy \"Das Leben mit dir zu zubringen.\"  They parted, and she felt \"the happiest of human beings,\" when Lord M.  came in. At first she beat about the bush, and talked of the weather,  and indifferent subjects. Somehow or other she felt a little nervous  with her old friend. At last, summoning up her courage, she said, \"I  have got well through this with Albert.\" \"Oh! you have,\" said Lord M.        CHAPTER IV. MARRIAGE    I    It was decidedly a family match. Prince Francis Charles Augustus Albert  Emmanuel of Saxe-Coburg--Gotha--for such was his full title--had been  born just three months after his cousin Victoria, and the same midwife  had assisted at the two births. The children's grandmother, the Dowager  Duchess of Coburg, had from the first looked forward to their marriage,  as they grew up, the Duke, the Duchess of Kent, and King Leopold came  equally to desire it. The Prince, ever since the time when, as a child  of three, his nurse had told him that some day \"the little English May  flower\" would be his wife, had never thought of marrying anyone else.  When eventually Baron Stockmar himself signified his assent, the affair  seemed as good as settled.    The Duke had one other child--Prince Ernest, Albert's senior by one  year, and heir to the principality. The Duchess was a sprightly and  beautiful woman, with fair hair and blue eyes; Albert was very like her  and was her declared favourite. But in his fifth year he was parted from  her for ever. The ducal court was not noted for the strictness of its  morals; the Duke was a man of gallantry, and it was rumoured that the  Duchess followed her husband's example. There were scandals: one of the  Court Chamberlains, a charming and cultivated man of Jewish extraction,  was talked of; at last there was a separation, followed by a divorce.  The Duchess retired to Paris, and died unhappily in 1831. Her memory was  always very dear to Albert.    He grew up a pretty, clever, and high-spirited boy. Usually  well-behaved, he was, however, sometimes violent. He had a will of  his own, and asserted it; his elder brother was less passionate, less  purposeful, and, in their wrangles, it was Albert who came out top. The  two boys, living for the most part in one or other of the Duke's country  houses, among pretty hills and woods and streams, had been at a very  early age--Albert was less than four--separated from their nurses and  put under a tutor, in whose charge they remained until they went to the  University. They were brought up in a simple and unostentatious manner,  for the Duke was poor and the duchy very small and very insignificant.  Before long it became evident that Albert was a model lad. Intelligent  and painstaking, he had been touched by the moral earnestness of his  generation; at the age of eleven he surprised his father by telling him  that he hoped to make himself \"a good and useful man.\" And yet he was  not over-serious; though, perhaps, he had little humour, he was full  of fun--of practical jokes and mimicry. He was no milksop; he rode, and  shot, and fenced; above all did he delight in being out of doors, and  never was he happier than in his long rambles with his brother through  the wild country round his beloved Rosenau--stalking the deer, admiring  the scenery, and returning laden with specimens for his natural  history collection. He was, besides, passionately fond of music. In one  particular it was observed that he did not take after his father: owing  either to his peculiar upbringing or to a more fundamental idiosyncrasy  he had a marked distaste for the opposite sex. At the age of five, at a  children's dance, he screamed with disgust and anger when a little girl  was led up to him for a partner; and though, later on, he grew more  successful in disguising such feelings, the feelings remained.    The brothers were very popular in Coburg, and, when the time came for  them to be confirmed, the preliminary examination which, according to  ancient custom, was held in public in the \"Giants' Hall\" of the  Castle, was attended by an enthusiastic crowd of functionaries, clergy,  delegates from the villages of the duchy, and miscellaneous onlookers.  There were also present, besides the Duke and the Dowager Duchess, their  Serene Highnesses the Princes Alexander and Ernest of Wurtemberg,  Prince Leiningen, Princess Hohenlohe-Langenburg, and Princess  Hohenlohe-Schillingsfurst. Dr. Jacobi, the Court chaplain, presided at  an altar, simply but appropriately decorated, which had been placed at  the end of the hall; and the proceedings began by the choir singing the  first verse of the hymn, \"Come, Holy Ghost.\" After some introductory  remarks, Dr. Jacobi began the examination. \"The dignified and decorous  bearing of the Princes,\" we are told in a contemporary account,  \"their strict attention to the questions, the frankness, decision, and  correctness of their answers, produced a deep impression on the numerous  assembly. Nothing was more striking in their answers than the evidence  they gave of deep feeling and of inward strength of conviction. The  questions put by the examiner were not such as to be met by a simple  'yes' or 'no.' They were carefully considered in order to give the  audience a clear insight into the views and feelings of,the young  princes. One of the most touching moments was when the examiner asked  the hereditary prince whether he intended steadfastly to hold to the  Evangelical Church, and the Prince answered not only 'Yes!' but added in  a clear and decided tone: 'I and my brother are firmly resolved ever  to remain faithful to the acknowledged truth.' The examination having  lasted an hour, Dr. Jacobi made some concluding observations, followed  by a short prayer; the second and third verses of the opening hymn were  sung; and the ceremony was over. The Princes, stepping down from the  altar, were embraced by the Duke and the Dowager Duchess; after which  the loyal inhabitants of Coburg dispersed, well satisfied with their  entertainment.\"    Albert's mental development now proceeded apace. In his seventeenth year  he began a careful study of German literature and German philosophy.  He set about, he told his tutor, \"to follow the thoughts of the great  Klopstock into their depths--though in this, for the most part,\" he  modestly added, \"I do not succeed.\" He wrote an essay on the \"Mode  of Thought of the Germans, and a Sketch of the History of German  Civilisation,\" \"making use,\" he said, \"in its general outlines, of  the divisions which the treatment of the subject itself demands,\" and  concluding with \"a retrospect of the shortcomings of our time, with an  appeal to every one to correct those shortcomings in his own case, and  thus set a good example to others.\" Placed for some months under the  care of King Leopold at Brussels, he came under the influence of Adolphe  Quetelet, a mathematical professor, who was particularly interested  in the application of the laws of probability to political and moral  phenomena; this line of inquiry attracted the Prince, and the friendship  thus begun continued till the end of his life. From Brussels he went to  the University of Bonn, where he was speedily distinguished both by his  intellectual and his social activities; his energies were absorbed  in metaphysics, law, political economy, music, fencing, and amateur "]]]
