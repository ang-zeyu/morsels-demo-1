[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1183"],[0,"The Return of Dr. Fu-Manchu (#17)"],[1,"that way!\" she whispered, bending eagerly  toward me. (How, in the most desperate moments, I loved to listen to  that odd, musical accent!) \"Please, if you would save your life, and  spare mine, trust me!\"--She suddenly clasped her hands together and  looked up into my face, passionately--\"Trust me--just for once--and I  will show you the way!\"    Nayland Smith never removed his gaze from her for a moment, nor did he  stir.    \"Oh!\" she whispered, tremulously, and stamped one little red slipper  upon the floor. \"Won't you heed me? Come, or it will be too late!\"    I glanced anxiously at my friend; the voice of Dr. Fu-Manchu, now raised  in anger, was audible above the piping tones of the other Chinaman.  And as I caught Smith's eye, in silent query--the trap at my feet began  slowly to lift!    Karamaneh stifled a little sobbing cry; but the warning came too late.  A hideous yellow face with oblique squinting eyes, appeared in the  aperture.    I found myself inert, useless; I could neither think nor act. Nayland  Smith, however, as if instinctively, delivered a pitiless kick at the  head protruding above the trap.    A sickening crushing sound, with a sort of muffled snap, spoke of a  broken jaw-bone; and with no word or cry, the Chinaman fell. As the trap  descended with a bang, I heard the thud of his body on the stone stairs  beneath.    But we were lost. Karamaneh fled along one of the passages lightly as a  bird, and disappeared as Dr. Fu-Manchu, his top lip drawn up above his  teeth in the manner of an angry jackal, appeared from the other.    \"This way!\" cried Smith, in a voice that rose almost to a shriek--\"this  way!\"--and he led toward the room overhanging the steps.    Off we dashed with panic swiftness, only to find that this retreat also  was cut off. Dimly visible in the darkness was a group of yellow men,  and despite the gloom, the curved blades of the knives which they  carried glittered menacingly. The passage was full of dacoits!    Smith and I turned, together. The trap was raised again, and the Burman,  who had helped to tie me, was just scrambling up beside Dr. Fu-Manchu,  who stood there watching us, a shadowy, sinister figure.    \"The game's up, Petrie!\" muttered Smith. \"It has been a long fight, but  Fu-Manchu wins!\"    \"Not entirely!\" I cried. I whipped the police whistle from my pocket,  and raised it to my lips; but brief as the interval had been, the  dacoits were upon me.    A sinewy brown arm shot over my shoulder and the whistle was dashed from  my grasp. Then came a whirl of maelstrom fighting with Smith and myself  ever sinking lower amid a whirlpool, as it seemed, of blood-lustful  eyes, yellow fangs, and gleaming blades.    I had some vague idea that the rasping voice of Fu-Manchu broke once  through the turmoil, and when, with my wrists tied behind me, I emerged  from the strife to find myself lying beside Smith in the passage, I  could only assume that the Chinaman had ordered his bloody servants to  take us alive; for saving numerous bruises and a few superficial cuts, I  was unwounded.    The place was utterly deserted again, and we two panting captives found  ourselves alone with Dr. Fu-Manchu. The scene was unforgettable; that  dimly lighted passage, its extremities masked in shadow, and the tall,  yellow-robed figure of the Satanic Chinaman towering over us where we  lay.    He had recovered his habitual calm, and as I peered at him through the  gloom I was impressed anew with the tremendous intellectual force of the  man. He had the brow of a genius, the features of a born ruler; and even  in that moment I could find time to search my memory, and to discover  that the face, saving the indescribable evil of its expression, was  identical with that of Seti, the mighty Pharaoh who lies in the Cairo  Museum.    Down the passage came leaping and gamboling the doctor's marmoset.  Uttering its shrill, whistling cry, it leaped onto his shoulder,  clutched with its tiny fingers at the scanty, neutral-colored hair  upon his crown, and bent forward, peering grotesquely into that still,  dreadful face.    Dr. Fu-Manchu stroked the little creature; and crooned to it, as a  mother to her infant. Only this crooning, and the labored breathing of  Smith and myself, broke that impressive stillness.    Suddenly the guttural voice began:    \"You come at an opportune time, Mr. Commissioner Nayland Smith, and  Dr. Petrie; at a time when the greatest man in China flatters me with  a visit. In my absence from home, a tremendous honor has been conferred  upon me, and, in the hour of this supreme honor, dishonor and calamity  have befallen! For my services to China--the New China, the China of the  future--I have been admitted by the Sublime Prince to the Sacred Order  of the White Peacock.\"    Warming to his discourse, he threw wide his arms, hurling the chattering  marmoset fully five yards along the corridor.    \"O god of Cathay!\" he cried, sibilantly, \"in what have I sinned that  this catastrophe has been visited upon my head! Learn, my two dear  friends, that the sacred white peacock brought to these misty shores for  my undying glory, has been lost to me! Death is the penalty of such a  sacrilege; death shall be my lot, since death I deserve.\"    Covertly Smith nudged me with his elbow. I knew what the nudge was  designed to convey; he would remind me of his words--anent the childish  trifles which sway the life of intellectual China.    Personally, I was amazed. That Fu-Manchu's anger, grief, sorrow and  resignation were real, no one watching him, and hearing his voice, could  doubt.    He continued:    \"By one deed, and one deed alone, may I win a lighter punishment. By  one deed, and the resignation of all my titles, all my lands, and all my  honors, may I merit to be spared to my work--which has only begun.\"    I knew now that we were lost, indeed; these were confidences which our  graves should hold inviolate! He suddenly opened fully those blazing  green eyes and directed their baneful glare upon Nayland Smith.    \"The Director of the Universe,\" he continued, softly, \"has relented  toward me. To-night, you die! To-night, the arch-enemy of our caste  shall be no more. This is my offering--the price of redemption...\"    My mind was working again, and actively. I managed to grasp the  stupendous truth--and the stupendous possibility.    Dr. Fu-Manchu was in the act of clapping his hands, when I spoke.    \"Stop!\" I cried.    He paused, and the weird film, which sometimes became visible in his  eyes, now obscured their greenness, and lent him the appearance of a  blind man.    \"Dr. Petrie,\" he said, softly, \"I shall always listen to you with  respect.\"    \"I have an offer to make,\" I continued, seeking to steady my voice.  \"Give us our freedom, and I will restore your shattered honor--I will  restore the sacred peacock!\"    Dr. Fu-Manchu bent forward until his face was so close to mine that I  could see the innumerable lines which, an intricate network, covered his  yellow skin.    \"Speak!\" he hissed. \"You lift up my heart from a dark pit!\"    \"I can restore your white peacock,\" I said; \"I and I alone, know where  it is!\"--and I strove not to shrink from the face so close to mine.    Upright shot the tall figure; high above his head Fu-Manchu threw  his arms--and a light of exaltation gleamed in the now widely opened,  catlike eyes.    \"O god!\" he screamed, frenziedly--\"O god of the Golden Age! like a  phoenix I arise from the ashes of myself!\" He turned to me. \"Quick!  Quick! make your bargain! End my suspense!\"    Smith stared at me like a man dazed; but, ignoring him, I went on:    \"You will release me, now, immediately. In another ten minutes it will  be too late; my friend will remain. One of your--servants--can accompany  me, and give the signal when I return with the peacock. Mr. Nayland  Smith and yourself, or another, will join me at the corner of the street  where the raid took place last night. We shall then give you ten minutes  grace, after which we shall take whatever steps we choose.\"    \"Agreed!\" cried Fu-Manchu. \"I ask but one thing from an Englishman; your  word of honor?\"    \"I give it.\"    \"I, also,\" said Smith, hoarsely.                      *       *       *       *       *    Ten minutes later, Nayland Smith and I, standing beside the cab, whose  lights gleamed yellowly through the mist, exchanged a struggling,  frightened bird for our lives--capitulated with the enemy of the white  race.    With characteristic audacity--and characteristic trust in the British  sense of honor--Dr. Fu-Manchu came in person with Nayland Smith, in  response to the wailing signal of the dacoit who had accompanied me. No  word was spoken, save that the cabman suppressed a curse of amazement;  and the Chinaman, his sinister servant at his elbow, bowed low--and left  us, surely to the mocking laughter of the gods!        CHAPTER XIV. THE COUGHING HORROR    I leaped up in bed with a great start.    My sleep was troubled often enough in these days, which immediately  followed our almost miraculous escape, from the den of Fu-Manchu; and  now as I crouched there, nerves aquiver--listening--listening--I could  not be sure if this dank panic which possessed me had its origin in  nightmare or in something else.    Surely a scream, a choking cry for help, had reached my ears; but now,  almost holding my breath in that sort of nervous tensity peculiar to one  aroused thus, I listened, and the silence seemed complete. Perhaps I had  been dreaming...    \"Help! Petrie! Help!...\"    It was Nayland Smith in the room above me!    My doubts were dissolved; this was no trick of an imagination  disordered. Some dreadful menace threatened my friend. Not delaying  even to snatch my dressing-gown, I rushed out on to the landing, up the  stairs, bare-footed as I was, threw open the door of Smith's room and  literally hurled myself in.    Those cries had been the cries of one assailed, had been uttered,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11870"],[0,"The Country of the Blind, and Other Stories (#17)"],[1,"inspiration, fetched a medical man. The  expert was chiefly anxious to get the machine at work again, for seven or  eight trains had stopped midway in the stuffy tunnels of the electric  railway. Azuma-zi, answering or misunderstanding the questions of the  people who had by authority or impudence come into the shed, was presently  sent back to the stoke-hole by the scientific manager. Of course a crowd  collected outside the gates of the yard--a crowd, for no known reason,  always hovers for a day or two near the scene of a sudden death in  London--two or three reporters percolated somehow into the engine-shed,  and one even got to Azuma-zi; but the scientific expert cleared them out  again, being himself an amateur journalist.    Presently the body was carried away, and public interest departed with it.  Azuma-zi remained very quietly at his furnace, seeing over and over again  in the coals a figure that wriggled violently and became still. An hour  after the murder, to any one coming into the shed it would have looked  exactly as if nothing remarkable had ever happened there. Peeping  presently from his engine-room the black saw the Lord Dynamo spin and  whirl beside his little brothers, and the driving wheels were beating  round, and the steam in the pistons went thud, thud, exactly as it had  been earlier in the evening. After all, from the mechanical point of view,  it had been a most insignificant incident--the mere temporary deflection  of a current. But now the slender form and slender shadow of the  scientific manager replaced the sturdy outline of Holroyd travelling up  and down the lane of light upon the vibrating floor under the straps  between the engines and the dynamos.    \"Have I not served my Lord?\" said Azuma-zi inaudibly, from his shadow, and  the note of the great dynamo rang out full and clear. As he looked at the  big whirling mechanism the strange fascination of it that had been a  little in abeyance since Holroyd's death resumed its sway.    Never had Azuma-zi seen a man killed so swiftly and pitilessly. The big  humming machine had slain its victim without wavering for a second from  its steady beating. It was indeed a mighty god.    The unconscious scientific manager stood with his back to him, scribbling  on a piece of paper. His shadow lay at the foot of the monster.    Was the Lord Dynamo still hungry? His servant was ready.    Azuma-zi made a stealthy step forward; then stopped. The scientific  manager suddenly ceased his writing, walked down the shed to the endmost  of the dynamos, and began to examine the brushes.    Azuma-zi hesitated, and then slipped across noiselessly into the shadow by  the switch. There he waited. Presently the manager's footsteps could be  heard returning. He stopped in his old position, unconscious of the stoker  crouching ten feet away from him. Then the big dynamo suddenly fizzled,  and in another moment Azuma-zi had sprung out of the darkness upon him.    First, the scientific manager was gripped round the body and swung towards  the big dynamo, then, kicking with his knee and forcing his antagonist's  head down with his hands, he loosened the grip on his waist and swung  round away from the machine. Then the black grasped him again, putting a  curly head against his chest, and they swayed and panted as it seemed for  an age or so. Then the scientific manager was impelled to catch a black  ear in his teeth and bite furiously. The black yelled hideously.    They rolled over on the floor, and the black, who had apparently slipped  from the vice of the teeth or parted with some ear--the scientific manager  wondered which at the time--tried to throttle him. The scientific manager  was making some ineffectual efforts to claw something with his hands and  to kick, when the welcome sound of quick footsteps sounded on the floor.  The next moment Azuma-zi had left him and darted towards the big dynamo.  There was a splutter amid the roar.    The officer of the company who had entered stood staring as Azuma-zi  caught the naked terminals in his hands, gave one horrible convulsion, and  then hung motionless from the machine, his face violently distorted.    \"I'm jolly glad you came in when you did,\" said the scientific manager,  still sitting on the floor.    He looked at the still quivering figure. \"It is not a nice death to die,  apparently--but it is quick.\"    The official was still staring at the body. He was a man of slow  apprehension.    There was a pause.    The scientific manager got up on his feet rather awkwardly. He ran his  fingers along his collar thoughtfully, and moved his head to and fro  several times.    \"Poor Holroyd! I see now.\" Then almost mechanically he went towards the  switch in the shadow and turned the current into the railway circuit  again. As he did so the singed body loosened its grip upon the machine and  fell forward on its face. The core of the dynamo roared out loud and  clear, and the armature beat the air.    So ended prematurely the worship of the Dynamo Deity, perhaps the most  short-lived of all religions. Yet withal it could at least boast a  Martyrdom and a Human Sacrifice.          IX.      THE MOTH.      Probably you have heard of Hapley--not W. T. Hapley, the son, but the  celebrated Hapley, the Hapley of _Periplaneta Hapliia_, Hapley the  entomologist.    If so you know at least of the great feud between Hapley and Professor  Pawkins, though certain of its consequences may be new to you. For those  who have not, a word or two of explanation is necessary, which the idle  reader may go over with a glancing eye, if his indolence so incline him.    It is amazing how very widely diffused is the ignorance of such really  important matters as this Hapley-Pawkins feud. Those epoch-making  controversies, again, that have convulsed the Geological Society are, I  verily believe, almost entirely unknown outside the fellowship of that  body. I have heard men of fair general education even refer to the great  scenes at these meetings as vestry-meeting squabbles. Yet the great hate  of the English and Scotch geologists has lasted now half a century, and  has \"left deep and abundant marks upon the body of the science.\" And this  Hapley-Pawkins business, though perhaps a more personal affair, stirred  passions as profound, if not profounder. Your common man has no conception  of the zeal that animates a scientific investigator, the fury of  contradiction you can arouse in him. It is the _odium theologicum_ in  a new form. There are men, for instance, who would gladly burn Professor  Ray Lankester at Smithfield for his treatment of the Mollusca in the  Encyclopaedia. That fantastic extension of the Cephalopods to cover the  Pteropods ... But I wander from Hapley and Pawkins.    It began years and years ago, with a revision of the Microlepidoptera  (whatever these may be) by Pawkins, in which he extinguished a new species  created by Hapley. Hapley, who was always quarrelsome, replied by a  stinging impeachment of the entire classification of Pawkins.[A] Pawkins  in his \"Rejoinder\"[B] suggested that Hapley's microscope was as defective  as his power of observation, and called him an \"irresponsible meddler\"--  Hapley was not a professor at that time. Hapley in his retort,[C] spoke of  \"blundering collectors,\" and described, as if inadvertently, Pawkins'  revision as a \"miracle of ineptitude.\" It was war to the knife. However,  it would scarcely interest the reader to detail how these two great men  quarrelled, and how the split between them widened until from the  Microlepidoptera they were at war upon every open question in entomology.  There were memorable occasions. At times the Royal Entomological Society  meetings resembled nothing so much as the Chamber of Deputies. On the  whole, I fancy Pawkins was nearer the truth than Hapley. But Hapley was  skilful with his rhetoric, had a turn for ridicule rare in a scientific  man, was endowed with vast energy, and had a fine sense of injury in the  matter of the extinguished species; while Pawkins was a man of dull  presence, prosy of speech, in shape not unlike a water-barrel, over  conscientious with testimonials, and suspected of jobbing museum  appointments. So the young men gathered round Hapley and applauded him. It  was a long struggle, vicious from the beginning and growing at last to  pitiless antagonism. The successive turns of fortune, now an advantage to  one side and now to another--now Hapley tormented by some success of  Pawkins, and now Pawkins outshone by Hapley, belong rather to the history  of entomology than to this story.    [Footnote A: \"Remarks on a Recent Revision of Microlepidoptera.\"  _Quart. Journ. Entomological Soc._, 1863.]    [Footnote B: \"Rejoinder to certain Remarks,\" etc. _Ibid._ 1864.]    [Footnote C: \"Further Remarks,\" etc. _Ibid._]    But in 1891 Pawkins, whose health had been bad for some time, published  some work upon the \"mesoblast\" of the Death's Head Moth. What the  mesoblast of the Death's Head Moth may be does not matter a rap in this  story. But the work was far below his usual standard, and gave Hapley an  opening he had coveted for years. He must have worked night and day to  make the most of his advantage.    In an elaborate critique he rent Pawkins to tatters--one can fancy the  man's disordered black hair, and his queer dark eyes flashing as he went  for his antagonist--and Pawkins made a reply, halting, ineffectual, with  painful gaps of silence, and yet malignant. There was no mistaking his  will to wound Hapley, nor his incapacity to do it. But few of those who  heard him--I was absent from that meeting--realised how ill the man was.    Hapley got his opponent down, and meant to finish him. He followed with a  simply brutal attack upon Pawkins, in the form of a paper upon the  development of moths in general, a paper showing evidence of a most  extraordinary amount of mental labour, and yet couched in a violently  controversial tone."]]]
