[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9886"],[0,"The Book of Delight and Other Papers (#16)"],[1,"my dinner. I want a form for  setting out on a pleasant walk, for a midnight ramble, for a friendly  meeting, for a solved problem. Why have we none for books, those spiritual  repasts--a grace before Milton,--a grace before Shakespeare,--a devotional  exercise proper to be said before reading the Fairy Queen?\" The Jewish  ritual could have supplied Lamb with several of these graces.    It will, I hope, now be seen why in speaking on the solace of books I have  said so little about consolation. It pains me to hear books praised as a  relief from worldly cares, to hear the library likened to an asylum for  broken spirits. I have never been an admirer of Boethius. His \"Consolations  of Philosophy\" have always been influential and popular, but I like better  the first famous English translator than the original Latin author.  Boethius wrote in the sixth century as a fallen man, as one to whom  philosophy came in lieu of the mundane glory which he had once possessed,  and had now lost. But Alfred the Great turned the \"Consolations\" into  English at the moment of his greatest power. He translated it in the year  886, when king on a secure throne; in his brightest days, when the Danish  clouds had cleared. Sorrow has often produced great books, great psalms, to  which the sorrowful heart turns for solace. But in the truest sense the  Shechinah rests on man only in his joy, when he has so attuned his life  that misfortune is but another name for good fortune. He must have learned  to endure before he seeks the solace of communion with the souls of the  great, with the soul of God. Very saddening it is to note how often men  have turned to books because life has no other good. The real book-lover  goes to his books when life is fullest of other joys, when his life is  richest in its manifold happiness. Then he adds the crown of joy to his  other joys, and finds the highest happiness.    I do not like to think of the circumstances under which Sir Thomas  Bodley went to Oxford to found his famous library. Not till his  diplomatic career was a failure, not till Elizabeth's smiles had  darkened into frowns, did he set up his staff at the library door. But  Bodley rather mistook himself. As a lad the library had been his joy,  and when he was abroad, at the summit of his public fame, he turned his  diplomatic missions to account by collecting books and laying the  foundation of his future munificence. I even think that no lover of  books ever loved them so well in his adversity as in his prosperity.  Another view was held by Don Isaac Abarbanel, the famous Jewish  statesman and litterateur. Under Alfonso V, of Portugal, and other  rulers, he attained high place, but was brought low by the Inquisition,  and shared in the expulsion of his brethren. He writes in one of his  letters: \"The whole time I lived in the courts and palaces of kings,  occupied in their service, I had no leisure to read or write books. My  days were spent in vain ambitions, seeking after wealth and honor. Now  that my wealth is gone, and honor has become exiled from Israel; now  that I am a vagabond and a wanderer on the earth, and I have no money:  now, I have returned to seek the book of God, as it is said, [Hebrew:  cheth-samech-vav-resh-yod mem-cheth-samech-resh-aleph vav-hey-chaf-yod  qof-tav-nun-yod], 'He is in sore need, therefore he studies.'\"    This is witty, but it is not wise. Fortunately, it is not quite true;  Abarbanel does little justice to himself in this passage, for elsewhere (in  the preface to his Commentary on Kings) he draws a very different picture  of his life in his brilliant court days. \"My house,\" he says, \"was an  assembly place for the wise ... in my abode and within my walls were wealth  and fame for the Torah and for those made great in its lore.\" Naturally,  the active statesman had less leisure for his books than the exiled, fallen  minister.    So, too, with an earlier Jewish writer, Saadia. No sadder title was ever  chosen for a work than his _Sefer ha-Galui_--\"Book of the Exiled.\" It is  beyond our province to enter into his career, full of stress and storm.  Between 933 and 937, driven from power, he retired to his library at  Bagdad, just as Cincinnatus withdrew to his farm when Rome no longer needed  him. During his retirement Saadia's best books were written. Why? Graetz  tells us that \"Saadia was still under the ban of excommunication. He had,  therefore, no other sphere of action than that of an author.\" This is  pitiful; but, again, it is not altogether true. Saadia's whole career was  that of active authorship, when in power and out of power, as a boy, in  middle life, in age: his constant thought was the service of truth, in so  far as literature can serve it, and one may well think that he felt that  the Crown of the Law was better worth wearing in prosperity, when he chose  it out of other crowns, than in adversity, when it was the only crown  within his reach. It was thus that King Solomon chose.    So, in speaking of the solace of books, I have ventured to employ \"solace\"  in an old, unusual sense. \"Solace\" has many meanings. It means \"comfort in  sorrow,\" and in Scotch law it denotes a compensation for wounded feelings,  _solatium_, moral and intellectual damages in short. But in Chaucer and  Spenser, \"solace\" is sometimes used as a synonym for joy and sweet  exhilaration. This is an obsolete use, but let me hope that the thing is  not obsolete. For one must go to his books for solace, not in mourning  garb, but in gayest attire--to a wedding, not to a funeral. When John Clare  wrote,      I read in books for happiness,    But books mistake the way to joy,    he read for what he ought to have brought, and thus he failed to find his  goal. The library has been beautifully termed the \"bridal chamber of the  mind.\" So, too, the Apocrypha puts it in the Wisdom of Solomon:      Wisdom is radiant....    Her I loved and sought out from my youth,    And I sought to take her for my bride,    And I became enamored of her beauty.           *       *       *       *       *      When I am come into my house, I shall find rest with her,    For converse with her hath no bitterness,    And to live with her hath no pain.           *       *       *       *       *      O God of the fathers, ...    Give me wisdom, that sitteth by Thee on Thy throne.          MEDIEVAL WAYFARING      Men leave their homes because they must, or because they will. The Hebrew  has experienced both motives for travelling. Irresistibly driven on by his  own destiny and by the pressure of his fellow-men, the Jew was also gifted  with a double share of that curiosity and restlessness which often send men  forth of their own free will on long and arduous journeys. He has thus  played the part of the Wandering Jew from choice and from necessity. He  loved to live in the whole world, and the whole world met him by refusing  him a single spot that he might call his very own.      Tribes of the wandering foot and weary breast,    How shall ye flee away and be at rest!    The wild-dove hath her nest, the fox her cave,    Mankind their country,--Israel but the grave!    A sad chapter of medieval history is filled with the enforced wanderings of  the sons of Israel. The lawgiver prophesied well, \"There shall be no rest  for the sole of thy foot.\" But we are not concerned here with the victim of  expulsion and persecution. The wayfarer with whom we shall deal is the  traveller, and not the exile. He was moved by no caprice but his own. He  will excite our admiration, perhaps our sympathy, only rarely our tears.    My subject, be it remembered, is not wayfarers, but wayfaring. Hence I am  to tell you not the story of particular travellers, but the manner of their  travelling, the conditions under which they moved. Before leaving home, a  Jewish wayfarer of the Middle Ages was bound to procure two kinds of  passport. In no country in those days was freedom of motion allowed to  anyone. The Jew was simply a little more hampered than others. In England,  the Jew paid a feudal fine before he might cross the seas. In Spain, the  system of exactions was very complete. No Jew could change his residence  without a license even within his own town. But in addition to the  inflictions of the Government, the Jews enacted voluntary laws of their  own, forcing their brethren to obtain a congregational permit before  starting.    The reasons for this restriction were simple. In the first place, no Jew  could be allowed to depart at will, and leave the whole burden of the royal  taxes on the shoulders of those who were left behind. Hence, in many parts  of Europe and Asia, no Jew could leave without the express consent of the  congregation. Even when he received the consent, it was usually on the  understanding that he would continue, in his absence, to pay his share of  the communal dues. Sometimes even women were included in this law, as, for  instance, if the daughter of a resident Jew married and settled elsewhere,  she was forced to contribute to the taxes of her native town a sum  proportionate to her dowry, unless she emigrated to Palestine, in which  case she was free. A further cause why Jews placed restrictions on free  movement was moral and commercial. Announcements had to be made in the  synagogue informing the congregation that so-and-so was on the point of  departure, and anyone with claims against him could obtain satisfaction. No  clandestine or unauthorized departure was permissible. It must not be  thought that these communal licenses were of no service to the traveller.  On the contrary, they often assured him a welcome in the next town, and in  Persia were as good as a safe-conduct. No Mohammedan would have dared defy  the travelling order sealed by the Jewish Patriarch.    Having obtained his two licenses, one from the Government and the other  from the Synagogue, the traveller would have to consider his costume.  \"Dress shabbily\" was the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9897"],[0,"Introductory American History (#16)"],[1,"\"eternal vigilance was the price of liberty.\" Some of the    belfries of these mediaeval towns are still standing, and remind the    citizens of to-day of the struggles of the early days.      [Illustration: VIEW OF CARCASSONNE This is an ancient city in    France founded by the Romans]      The men of each occupation or trade were organized into societies or    guilds, with masters, journeymen, and apprentices. There were guilds of    goldsmiths, ironmongers, and fishmongers, that is, workers in gold and    iron and sellers of fish. The merchants also had their guilds. In many    towns no one was allowed to work at a trade or sell merchandise who was    not a member of a guild.    OLD CITIES WHICH STILL EXIST. Many of the towns which grew up in    the Middle Ages are now the great cities of England and Europe. Their    citizens can look back a thousand years and more over the history of    their city, can point to churches, to town halls, and sometimes to    private houses, that have stood all this time. They can often show the    remains of mediaeval walls or broad streets where once these walls    stood, and the moats that surrounded them. The traveler in York or    London, in Paris, in Nuremburg, in Florence, or in Rome eagerly searches    for the relics about which so many interesting stories of the past    are told.    VENICE AND GENOA. One of the most fascinating of these old cities    is Venice, built upon low-lying islands two miles from the shore of    Italy and protected by a sand bar from the waters of the Adriatic.    Venice was founded by men and women who fled from a Roman city on the    mainland which was ruined by the barbarians in the fifth century after    Christ. In many places piles had to be driven into the loose sands to    furnish a foundation for houses. The Venetians did not try to keep out    the water but used it as streets, and instead of driving in wagons they    went about in boats. They grew rich in trade on the sea, as the Greeks    had done in those same waters hundreds of years before.      Farther down the coast of Italy were the cities Brindisi and Taranto,    the Brundusium and Tarentum of the Romans. Across the peninsula to the    west was another trading city called Genoa, which was the birthplace    of Columbus.    MODERN LANGUAGES. While the people of mediaeval times were building    city walls and towers to protect themselves they were also doing other    things. Almost without knowing it they formed the languages which we now    speak and write--English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish.      The English and German languages are closely related because the    forefathers of the English emigrated to England from Germany, taking    their language with them. This older language was gradually changed, but    it still remained like German. Dutch is another language like both    English and German.      There are many words in these languages borrowed from other peoples.    Englishmen, because of their long union with western France, borrowed    many words from the French. The French did not invent these words, for    the French language grew out of the Latin language which the French    learned from the Romans.    HOW MODERN LANGUAGES WERE FORMED. In English we have two sets of    words and phrases: one is used in writing books or speeches, the other    in conversation. When the Gauls learned Latin, the language of Rome,    most of them learned the words used in conversation and did not learn    the words of Roman books. Before long spoken words differed so much from    the older written words that only scholars understood that the two had    belonged to the same language. This new language was French. In the same    way Italian and Spanish grew out of the ordinary Latin spoken in Italy    and Spain.      When men began to write books in the new languages, the changes went on    more slowly because the use of words in books kept the spelling the    same. Men wrote less in Latin, but it was still used in the religious    services of the Church and in the schools and universities.      [Illustration: VENICE AND THE GRAND CANAL]    SCHOOLS IN THE MIDDLE AGES. In the Middle Ages most boys and girls    did not go to school. Education was principally for those who expected    to become priests or monks. The schools were in the monasteries or in    the houses or palaces of the bishops. The students were taught a little    Latin grammar, to write or speak Latin, and to debate. They also learned    arithmetic; enough astronomy to reckon the days on which the festivals    of the Church should come; and music, so much as was then known of it.    Printing had not been invented, so there were no text-books for them to    study, and written books or manuscripts were too costly. Students    listened to the teacher as he read from his manuscripts and copied the    words or tried to remember them.    THE BEGINNING OF UNIVERSITIES. If students remained in the schools    after these things had been learned, they studied the laws of the    Romans, or the practise of medicine, or the religious questions which    are called theology. Some teachers talked in such an interesting way    about such questions that hundreds of students came to listen. Like    other kinds of workers, who were organized in societies or guilds, the    teachers and students formed a guild called a university. The teachers    were the master-workmen, and the students were the apprentices.    WHERE THE STUDENTS LIVED. In the beginning the universities had no    buildings of their own, and the teachers taught in hired halls, the    students boarding wherever they could find lodgings. Partly to help    students who were too poor to pay for good lodgings, and partly to bring    the students under the direct rule of teachers, colleges were built.    These were not separate institutions like the American colleges, but    simply houses for residence, although later some teaching was done    in them.    SOME FAMOUS UNIVERSITIES. The oldest university was in Bologna in    Italy, and teachers began to explain the laws of the Romans to its    students eight hundred years ago. The University of Paris was called the    greatest university in the Middle Ages. Its students numbered sometimes    between six and seven thousand. About the same time the English    universities of Oxford and Cambridge were formed, and there, many years    later, a large number of the men who settled in America were educated.    THE WISDOM OF THE ARABS. Students in these universities obtained    several of the writings of the Greeks through the Arabs, the followers    of Mohammed, who had conquered most of Spain. Long before Europeans    thought of founding universities the Arabs had flourishing schools and    universities in Spain. The capital of the Mohammedan Empire was first at    Bagdad on the Euphrates, where once ruled Haroun-al-Raschid, the hero of    the tales of the Arabian Nights.      [Illustration: VIEW OF NEW COLLEGE, OXFORD Built in the    fourteenth century]    WHAT EUROPEANS BORROWED FROM THE ARABS. The Arabs had learned much    of geography and mathematics from the Greeks, and they also found out    much for themselves. The numerals which we use are Arabic; and algebra,    one of our principal studies in mathematics, was thought out by the    Arabs. Their learned men were deeply interested in the books of    Aristotle, an ancient Greek, who had been a teacher of Alexander the    Great. They translated his books into Arabic, and Christian students in    Spain translated the Arabic into Latin. The great scholars at the    University of Paris believed that Aristotle reasoned better than other    thinkers, and took as their model the methods of reasoning found in this    Latin translation of an Arabic translation of what Aristotle had    written in Greek.      [Illustration: THE ALCAZAR AT SEVILLE Built by the Moors in the    twelfth century. Note the elaborate decoration of the Moorish    architecture.]    BUILDERS IN THE MIDDLE AGES. The Greeks and the Romans had been    great builders, but the men of the Middle Ages succeeded in building    churches, town halls, and palaces or castles which equaled in grandeur    and beauty the best that the ancient builders had made. The large    churches or cathedrals seem wonderful because their builders were able    to place masses of stone high in the air and to cover immense spaces    with beautiful vaulted roofs. Builders nowadays imitate, but not often,    if ever, equal them. Fortunately the original buildings are still    standing in many English and European cities: in Canterbury, Durham, and    Winchester; in Paris, Chartres, and Rheims; in Cologne, Erfurt, and    Strasbourg; in Barcelona and Toledo; in Milan, Venice, and Rome.      [Illustration: NOTRE DAME IN PARIS View from the rear,    showing the arches and buttresses]    CHURCH BUILDING. The Italians began by building churches like Roman    basilicas. Roman arches and domes, supported by heavy walls, were also    used north of the Alps, and the method of building was named Romanesque,    or in England, Norman. The architects or builders of western France    discovered a way of roofing over just as large spaces without using such    heavy walls, so that the interior could be lighted by larger windows.    Instead of having rounded arches they used pointed arches. The walls    between the windows were strengthened by masses of stone called    buttresses. The peak of the roof of these cathedrals was sometimes more    than one hundred and fifty feet above the floor. The glass of the    windows showed in beautiful colors scenes from the Bible or from lives    of sainted men and women. The outer walls, especially the western front,    the doorways and the towers, were richly carved and adorned with    statues, and often with the figures of strange birds and beasts which    lived only in the imagination of the builders.
