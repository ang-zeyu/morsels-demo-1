(#17)"],[1,"to this gentleman,  when he began to write his Fairy Queen, and that he took occasion to  go to Leicester-house, and introduce himself by sending in to Mr.  Sidney a copy of the ninth Canto of the first book of that poem.  Sidney was much surprized with the description of despair in that  Canto, and is said to have shewn an unusual kind of transport on the  discovery of so new and uncommon a genius. After he had read some  stanza's, he turned to his steward, and bid him give the person that  brought those verses fifty pounds; but upon reading the next stanza,  he ordered the sum to be doubled. The steward was no less surprized  than his master, and thought it his duty to make some delay in  executing so sudden and lavish a bounty; but upon reading one stanza  stanza more, Mr. Sidney raised the gratuity to two hundred pounds, and  commanded the steward to give it immediately, lest as he read further  he might be tempted to give away his whole estate. From this time he  admitted the author to his acquaintance and conversation, and prepared  the way for his being known and received at court.    Tho' this seemed a promising omen, to be thus introduced to court, yet  he did not instantly reap any advantage from it. He was indeed created  poet laureat to Queen Elizabeth, but he for some time wore a barren  laurel, and possessed only the place without the pension [2]. Lord  treasurer Burleigh, under whose displeasure Spenser laboured, took  care to intercept the Queen's favours to this unhappy great man. As  misfortunes have the most influence on elegant and polished minds, so  it was no wonder that Spenser was much depressed by the cold reception  he met with from the great; a circumstance which not a little detracts  from the merit of the ministers then in power: for I know not if  all the political transactions of Burleigh, are sufficient to  counterballance the infamy affixed on his name, by prosecuting  resentment against distressed merit, and keeping him who was the  ornament of the times, as much distant as possible from the approach  of competence. These discouragements greatly sunk our author's spirit,  and accordingly we find him pouring out his heart, in complaints of so  injurious and undeserved a treatment; which probably, would have been  less unfortunate to him, if his noble patron Sir Philip Sidney had not  been so much absent from court, as by his employments abroad, and the  share he had in the Low-Country wars, he was obliged to be. In a poem  called, The Ruins of Time, which was written some time after Sidney's  death, the author seems to allude to the discouragement I have  mentioned in the following stanza.      O grief of griefs, O gall of all good hearts!    To see that virtue should despised be,    Of such as first were raised for virtue's parts,    And now broad-spreading like an aged tree,    Let none shoot up that nigh them planted be;    O let not these, of whom the muse is scorned,    Alive or dead be by the muse adorned.    These lines are certainly meant to reflect on Burleigh for neglecting  him, and the Lord Treasurer afterwards conceived a hatred towards him  for the satire he apprehended was levelled at him in Mother Hubbard's  Tale. In this poem, the author has in the most lively manner, painted  out the misfortune of depending on court favours. The lines which  follow are among others very remarkable.      Full little knowest thou, that hast not try'd,    What Hell it is in suing long to bide,    To dole good days, that nights be better spent,    To waste long nights in pensive discontent;    To speed to day, to be put back to-morrow,    To feed on hope, to pine with fear and sorrow    To have thy prince's grace, yet want her peers,    To have thy asking, yet wait many years.    To fret thy soul with crosses, and with care.    To eat thy heart, thro' comfortless despair;    To fawn, to crouch, to wait, to ride, to run    To spend, to give, to want, to be undone.    As this was very much the author's case, it probably was the  particular passage in that poem which gave offence; for as Hughes very  elegantly observes, even the sighs of a miserable man, are sometimes  resented as an affront, by him who is the occasion of them. There is a  little story, which seems founded on the grievance just now mentioned,  and is related by some as a matter of fact [3] commonly reported at  that time. It is said, that upon his presenting some poems to the  Queen, she ordered him a gratuity of one hundred pounds, but the Lord  Treasurer Burleigh objecting to it, said with some scorn of the poet,  of whose merit he was totally ignorant, \"What, all this for a song?\"  The queen replied, \"Then give him what is reason.\" Spenser for some  time waited, but had the mortification to find himself disappointed  of her Majesty's bounty. Upon this he took a proper opportunity to  present a paper to Queen Elizabeth in the manner of a petition, in  which he reminded her of the order she had given, in the following  lines.      I was promised on a time    To have reason for my rhime,    From that time, unto this season    I received nor rhime, nor reason.    This paper produced the intended effect, and the Queen, after sharply  reproving the treasurer, immediately directed the payment of the  hundred pounds the had first ordered. In the year 1579 he was sent  abroad by the Earl of Leicester, as appears by a copy of Latin verses  dated from Leicester-house, and addressed to his friend Mr. Harvey;  but Mr. Hughes has not been able to determine in what service we was  employed. When the Lord Grey of Wilton was chosen Deputy of Ireland,  Spenser was recommended to him as secretary. This drew him over to  another kingdom, and settled him in a scene of life very different  from what he had formerly known; but, that he understood, and  discharged his employment with skill and capacity, appears  sufficiently by his discourse on the state of Ireland, in which there  are many solid and judicious remarks, that shew him no less qualified  for the business of the state, than for the entertainment of the  muses. His life was now freed from the difficulties under which it had  hitherto struggled, and his services to the Crown received a reward of  a grant from Queen Elizabeth of 3000 Acres of land in the county of  Cork. His house was in Kilcolman, and the river Mulla, which he has  more than once so finely introduced in his poems, ran through his  grounds. Much about this time, he contracted an intimate friendship  with the great and learned Sir Walter Raleigh, who was then a captain  under the lord Grey. The poem of Spenser's, called Colin Clouts come  home again, in which Sir Walter Raleigh is described under the name of  the Shepherd of the Ocean, is a beautiful memorial of this friendship,  which took its rise from a similarity of taste in the polite arts, and  which he agreeably describes with a softness and delicacy peculiar to  him. Sir Walter afterwards promoted him in Queen Elizabeth's esteem,  thro' whose recommendation she read his writings. He now fell in love  a second time with a merchant's daughter, in which, says Mrs. Cooper,  author of the muses library, he was more successful than in his first  amour. He wrote upon this occasion a beautiful epithalamium, with  which he presented the lady on the bridal-day, and has consigned that  day, and her, to immortality. In this pleasant easy situation our  excellent poet finished the celebrated poem of The Fairy Queen, which  was begun and continued at different intervals of time, and of which  he at first published only the three first books; to these were added  three more in a following edition, but the six last books (excepting  the two canto's of mutability) were unfortunately lost by his servant  whom he had in haste sent before him into England; for tho' he passed  his life for some time very serenely here, yet a train of misfortunes  still pursued him, and in the rebellion of the Earl of Desmond he was  plundered and deprived of his estate. This distress forced him to  return to England, where for want of his noble patron Sir Philip  Sidney, he was plunged into new calamities, as that gallant Hero died  of the wounds he received at Zutphen. It is said by Mr. Hughes, that  Spenser survived his patron about twelve years, and died the same year  with his powerful enemy the Lord Burleigh, 1598. He was buried, says  he, in Westminster-Abbey, near the famous Geoffery Chaucer, as he had  desired; his obsequies were attended by the poets of that time, and  others, who paid the last honours to his memory. Several copies of  verses were thrown after him into his grave, and his monument was  erected at the charge of the famous Robert Devereux, the unfortunate  Earl of Essex. This is the account given by his editor, of the death  of Spenser, but there is some reason to believe that he spoke only  upon imagination, as he has produced no authority to support his  opinion, especially as I find in a book of great reputation, another  opinion, delivered upon probable grounds. The ingenious Mr.  Drummond of Hawthronden, a noble wit of Scotland, had an intimate  correspondence with all the genius's of his time who resided at  London, particularly the famous Ben Johnson, who had so high an  opinion of Mr. Drummond's abilities, that he took a journey into  Scotland in order to converse with him, and stayed some time at his  house at Hawthronden. After Ben Johnson departed, Mr. Drummond,  careful to retain what past betwixt them, wrote down the heads of  their conversation; which is published amongst his poems and history  of the five James's Kings of Scotland. Amongst other particulars there  is this. \"Ben Johnson told me that Spenser's goods were robbed by the  Irish in Desmond's rebellion, his house and a little child of his  burnt, and he and his wife nearly escaped; that he afterwards died in  King-street [4] by absolute want of bread; and that he refused twenty  pieces"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/106"],[0,"Jungle Tales of Tarzan (#17)"],[1,"entertained devils in his evil lair.  Few, if any, had  the temerity to visit old Bukawai, firstly because of fear of his black  magic and the two hyenas who dwelt with him and were commonly known to  be devils masquerading, and secondly because of the loathsome disease  which had caused Bukawai to be an outcast--a disease which was slowly  eating away his face.    Now it was that Momaya reasoned shrewdly that if any might know the  whereabouts of her Tibo, it would be Bukawai, who was in friendly  intercourse with gods and demons, since a demon or a god it was who had  stolen her baby; but even her great mother love was sorely taxed to  find the courage to send her forth into the black jungle toward the  distant hills and the uncanny abode of Bukawai, the unclean, and his  devils.    Mother love, however, is one of the human passions which closely  approximates to the dignity of an irresistible force.  It drives the  frail flesh of weak women to deeds of heroic measure.  Momaya was  neither frail nor weak, physically, but she was a woman, an ignorant,  superstitious, African savage.  She believed in devils, in black magic,  and in witchcraft.  To Momaya, the jungle was inhabited by far more  terrifying things than lions and leopards--horrifying, nameless things  which possessed the power of wreaking frightful harm under various  innocent guises.    From one of the warriors of the village, whom she knew to have once  stumbled upon the lair of Bukawai, the mother of Tibo learned how she  might find it--near a spring of water which rose in a small rocky canyon  between two hills, the easternmost of which was easily recognizable  because of a huge granite boulder which rested upon its summit.  The  westerly hill was lower than its companion, and was quite bare of  vegetation except for a single mimosa tree which grew just a little  below its summit.    These two hills, the man assured her, could be seen for some distance  before she reached them, and together formed an excellent guide to her  destination.  He warned her, however, to abandon so foolish and  dangerous an adventure, emphasizing what she already quite well knew,  that if she escaped harm at the hands of Bukawai and his demons, the  chances were that she would not be so fortunate with the great  carnivora of the jungle through which she must pass going and returning.    The warrior even went to Momaya's husband, who, in turn, having little  authority over the vixenish lady of his choice, went to Mbonga, the  chief.  The latter summoned Momaya, threatening her with the direst  punishment should she venture forth upon so unholy an excursion.  The  old chief's interest in the matter was due solely to that age-old  alliance which exists between church and state.  The local  witch-doctor, knowing his own medicine better than any other knew it,  was jealous of all other pretenders to accomplishments in the black  art.  He long had heard of the power of Bukawai, and feared lest,  should he succeed in recovering Momaya's lost child, much of the tribal  patronage and consequent fees would be diverted to the unclean one.  As  Mbonga received, as chief, a certain proportion of the witch-doctor's  fees and could expect nothing from Bukawai, his heart and soul were,  quite naturally, wrapped up in the orthodox church.    But if Momaya could view with intrepid heart an excursion into the  jungle and a visit to the fear-haunted abode of Bukawai, she was not  likely to be deterred by threats of future punishment at the hands of  old Mbonga, whom she secretly despised.  Yet she appeared to accede to  his injunctions, returning to her hut in silence.    She would have preferred starting upon her quest by day-light, but this  was now out of the question, since she must carry food and a weapon of  some sort--things which she never could pass out of the village with by  day without being subjected to curious questioning that surely would  come immediately to the ears of Mbonga.    So Momaya bided her time until night, and just before the gates of the  village were closed, she slipped through into the darkness and the  jungle.  She was much frightened, but she set her face resolutely  toward the north, and though she paused often to listen, breathlessly,  for the huge cats which, here, were her greatest terror, she  nevertheless continued her way staunchly for several hours, until a low  moan a little to her right and behind her brought her to a sudden stop.    With palpitating heart the woman stood, scarce daring to breathe, and  then, very faintly but unmistakable to her keen ears, came the stealthy  crunching of twigs and grasses beneath padded feet.    All about Momaya grew the giant trees of the tropical jungle, festooned  with hanging vines and mosses.  She seized upon the nearest and started  to clamber, apelike, to the branches above.  As she did so, there was a  sudden rush of a great body behind her, a menacing roar that caused the  earth to tremble, and something crashed into the very creepers to which  she was clinging--but below her.    Momaya drew herself to safety among the leafy branches and thanked the  foresight which had prompted her to bring along the dried human ear  which hung from a cord about her neck.  She always had known that that  ear was good medicine.  It had been given her, when a girl, by the  witch-doctor of her town tribe, and was nothing like the poor, weak  medicine of Mbonga's witch-doctor.    All night Momaya clung to her perch, for although the lion sought other  prey after a short time, she dared not descend into the darkness again,  for fear she might encounter him or another of his kind; but at  daylight she clambered down and resumed her way.    Tarzan of the Apes, finding that his balu never ceased to give evidence  of terror in the presence of the apes of the tribe, and also that most  of the adult apes were a constant menace to Go-bu-balu's life, so that  Tarzan dared not leave him alone with them, took to hunting with the  little black boy farther and farther from the stamping grounds of the  anthropoids.      Little by little his absences from the tribe grew in length as he  wandered farther away from them, until finally he found himself a  greater distance to the north than he ever before had hunted, and with  water and ample game and fruit, he felt not at all inclined to return  to the tribe.    Little Go-bu-balu gave evidences of a greater interest in life, an  interest which varied in direct proportion to the distance he was from  the apes of Kerchak.  He now trotted along behind Tarzan when the  ape-man went upon the ground, and in the trees he even did his best to  follow his mighty foster parent.  The boy was still sad and lonely.  His thin, little body had grown steadily thinner since he had come  among the apes, for while, as a young cannibal, he was not overnice in  the matter of diet, he found it not always to his taste to stomach the  weird things which tickled the palates of epicures among the apes.    His large eyes were very large indeed now, his cheeks sunken, and every  rib of his emaciated body plainly discernible to whomsoever should care  to count them.  Constant terror, perhaps, had had as much to do with  his physical condition as had improper food.  Tarzan noticed the change  and was worried.  He had hoped to see his balu wax sturdy and strong.  His disappointment was great.  In only one respect did Go-bu-balu seem  to progress--he readily was mastering the language of the apes.  Even  now he and Tarzan could converse in a fairly satisfactory manner by  supplementing the meager ape speech with signs; but for the most part,  Go-bu-balu was silent other than to answer questions put to him.  His  great sorrow was yet too new and too poignant to be laid aside even  momentarily.  Always he pined for Momaya--shrewish, hideous, repulsive,  perhaps, she would have been to you or me, but to Tibo she was mamma,  the personification of that one great love which knows no selfishness  and which does not consume itself in its own fires.    As the two hunted, or rather as Tarzan hunted and Go-bu-balu tagged  along in his wake, the ape-man noticed many things and thought much.  Once they came upon Sabor moaning in the tall grasses.  About her  romped and played two little balls of fur, but her eyes were for one  which lay between her great forepaws and did not romp, one who never  would romp again.    Tarzan read aright the anguish and the suffering of the huge mother  cat.  He had been minded to bait her.  It was to do this that he had  sneaked silently through the trees until he had come almost above her,  but something held the ape-man as he saw the lioness grieving over her  dead cub.  With the acquisition of Go-bu-balu, Tarzan had come to  realize the responsibilities and sorrows of parentage, without its  joys.  His heart went out to Sabor as it might not have done a few  weeks before.  As he watched her, there rose quite unbidden before him  a vision of Momaya, the skewer through the septum of her nose, her  pendulous under lip sagging beneath the weight which dragged it down.  Tarzan saw not her unloveliness; he saw only the same anguish that was  Sabor's, and he winced.  That strange functioning of the mind which  sometimes is called association of ideas snapped Teeka and Gazan before  the ape-man's mental vision.  What if one should come and take Gazan  from Teeka.  Tarzan uttered a low and ominous growl as though Gazan  were his own.  Go-bu-balu glanced here and there apprehensively,  thinking that Tarzan had espied an enemy.  Sabor sprang suddenly to her  feet, her yellow-green eyes blazing, her tail lashing as she cocked her  ears, and raising her muzzle, sniffed the air for possible danger.  The  two little cubs, which had been playing, scampered quickly to her, and  standing beneath her, peered out from between her forelegs, their big  ears upstanding, their little heads cocked first upon one side"]]]
