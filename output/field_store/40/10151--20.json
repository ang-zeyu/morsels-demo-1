In both we must occupy  ourselves almost exclusively with a single artist, with Shakespeare in  the one and Calderon in the other; but not in the same order with  each, for Shakespeare stands first and earliest among the English; any  remarks we may have to make on earlier or contemporary antiquities of  the English stage may be made in a review of his history. But Calderon  had many predecessors; he is at once the summit and almost the close  of dramatic art in Spain.    The wish to speak with the brevity which the limits of my plan demand,  of a poet to the study of whom I have devoted many years of my life,  places me in no little embarrassment. I know not where to begin; for I  should never be able to end, were I to say all that I have felt and  thought, on the perusal of his works. With the poet, as with the man,  a more than ordinary intimacy prevents us, perhaps, from putting  ourselves in the place of those who are first forming an acquaintance  with him: we are too familiar with his most striking peculiarities to  be able to pronounce upon the first impression which they are  calculated to make on others. On the other hand, we ought to possess,  and to have the power of communicating, more correct ideas of his mode  of procedure, of his concealed or less obvious views, and of the  meaning and import of his labors, than others whose acquaintance with  him is more limited.    Shakespeare is the pride of his nation. A late poet has, with  propriety, called him \"the genius of the British isles.\" He was the  idol of his contemporaries during the interval, indeed, of puritanical  fanaticism, which broke out in the next generation and rigorously  proscribed all liberal arts and literature, and, during the reign of  the second Charles, when his works were either not acted at all, or,  if so, very much changed and disfigured, his fame was awhile obscured,  only to shine forth again about the beginning of the last century with  more than its original brightness; but since then it has only  increased in lustre with the course of time; and for centuries to come  (I speak it with the greatest confidence) it will, like an Alpine  avalanche, continue to gather strength at every moment of its  progress. Of the future extension of his fame, the enthusiasm with  which he was naturalized in Germany, the moment that he was known, is  a significant earnest. In the South of Europe,[13] his language and  the great difficulty of translating him with fidelity will be,  perhaps, an invincible obstacle to his general diffusion. In England,  the greatest actors vie with one another in the impersonation of his  characters; the printers in splendid editions of his works; and the  painters in transferring his scenes to the canvas. Like Dante,  Shakespeare has received the perhaps inevitable but still cumbersome  honor of being treated like a classical author of antiquity. The  oldest editions have been carefully collated, and, where the readings  seemed corrupt, many corrections have been suggested; and the whole  literature of his age has been drawn forth from the oblivion to which  it had been consigned, for the sole purpose of explaining the phrases  and illustrating the allusions of Shakespeare. Commentators have  succeeded one another in such number that their labors alone, with the  critical controversies to which they have given rise, constitute of  themselves no inconsiderable library. These labors deserve both our  praise and gratitude--more especially the historical investigations  into the sources from which Shakespeare drew the materials of his  plays and also into the previous and contemporary state of the  English stage, as well as other kindred subjects of inquiry. With  respect, however, to their merely philological criticisms, I am  frequently compelled to differ from the commentators; and where, too,  considering him simply as a poet, they endeavor to enter into his  views and to decide upon his merits, I must separate myself from them  entirely. I have hardly ever found either truth or profundity in their  remarks; and these critics seem to me to be but stammering  interpreters of the general and almost idolatrous admiration of his  countrymen. There may be people in England who entertain the same  views of them with myself, at least it is a well-known fact that a  satirical poet has represented Shakespeare, under the hands of his  commentators, by Actaeon worried to death by his own dogs; and,  following up the story of Ovid, designated a female writer on the  great poet as the snarling Lycisca.    We shall endeavor, in the first place, to remove some of these false  views, in order to clear the way for our own homage, that we may  thereupon offer it the more freely without let or hindrance.    From all the accounts of Shakespeare which have come down to us it is  clear that his contemporaries knew well the treasure they possessed in  him, and that they felt and understood him better than most of those  who succeeded him. In those days a work was generally ushered into the  world with Commendatory Verses; and one of these, prefixed to an early  edition of Shakespeare, by an unknown author, contains some of the  most beautiful and happy lines that were ever applied to any poet.[14]  An idea, however, soon became prevalent that Shakespeare was a rude  and wild genius, who poured forth at random, and without aim or  object, his unconnected compositions. Ben Jonson, a younger  contemporary and rival of Shakespeare, who labored in the sweat of his  brow, but with no great success, to expel the romantic drama from the  English stage and to form it on the model of the ancients, gave it as  his opinion that Shakespeare did not blot enough, and that, as he did  not possess much school-learning, he owed more to nature than to art.  The learned, and sometimes rather pedantic Milton was also of this  opinion, when he says--      Our sweetest Shakespeare, fancy's child,    Warbles his native wood-notes wild.    Yet it is highly honorable to Milton that the sweetness of  Shakespeare, the quality which of all others has been least allowed,  was felt and acknowledged by him. The modern editors, both in their  prefaces, which may be considered as so many rhetorical exercises in  praise of the poet, and in their remarks on separate passages, go  still farther. Judging them by principles which are not applicable to  them, not only do they admit the irregularity of his pieces, but, on  occasion, they accuse him of bombast, of a confused, ungrammatical,  and conceited mode of writing, and even of the most contemptible  buffoonery. Pope asserts that he wrote both better and worse than any  other man. All the scenes and passages which did not square with the  littleness of his own taste, he wished to place to the account of  interpolating players; and he was on the right road, had his opinion  been taken, of giving us a miserable dole of a mangled Shakespeare. It  is, therefore, not to be wondered at if foreigners, with the exception  of the Germans latterly, have, in their ignorance of him, even  improved upon these opinions.[15] They speak in general of  Shakespeare's plays as monstrous productions, which could have been  given to the world only by a disordered imagination in a barbarous  age; and Voltaire crowns the whole with more than usual assurance  when he observes that _Hamlet_, the profound masterpiece of the  philosophical poet, \"seems the work of a drunken savage.\" That  foreigners, and, in particular, Frenchmen, who ordinarily speak the  most strange language of antiquity and the middle ages, as if  cannibalism had been terminated in Europe only by Louis XIV., should  entertain this opinion of Shakespeare, might be pardonable; but that  Englishmen should join in calumniating that glorious epoch of their  history,[16] which laid the foundation of their national greatness, is  incomprehensible.    Shakespeare flourished and wrote in the last half of the reign of  Queen Elizabeth and first half of that of James I.; and, consequently,  under monarchs who were learned themselves and held literature in  honor. The policy of modern Europe, by which the relations of its  different states have been so variously interwoven with one another,  commenced a century before. The cause of the Protestants was decided  by the accession of Elizabeth to the throne; and the attachment to the  ancient belief cannot therefore be urged as a proof of the prevailing  darkness. Such was the zeal for the study of the ancients that even  court ladies, and the queen herself, were acquainted with Latin and  Greek, and taught even to speak the former--a degree of knowledge  which we should in vain seek for in the courts of Europe at the  present day. The trade and navigation which the English carried on  with all the four quarters of the world made them acquainted with the  customs and mental productions of other nations; and it would appear  that they were then more indulgent to foreign manners than they are  in the present day. Italy had already produced nearly all that still  distinguishes her literature, and, in England, translations in verse  were diligently, and even successfully, executed from the Italian.  Spanish literature also was not unknown, for it is certain that _Don  Quixote_ was read in England soon after its first appearance. Bacon,  the founder of modern experimental philosophy, and of whom it may be  said that he carried in his pocket all that even in this eighteenth  century merits the name of philosophy, was a contemporary of  Shakespeare. His fame as a writer did not, indeed, break forth into  its glory till after his death; but what a number of ideas must have  been in circulation before such an author could arise! Many branches  of human knowledge have, since that time, been more extensively  cultivated, but such branches as are totally"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12083"],[0,"Eric; Or, Little (#17)"],[1,"but  Upton and Eric; they were standing very harmlessly by the window, with  Upton's arm resting kindly on Eric's shoulder as they watched with  admiration the net-work of rippled sunbeams that flashed over the sea.  Upton had just been telling Eric the splendid phrase [Greek: anerithmon  gelasma pontion], which he had stumbled upon in an Aeschylus lesson that  morning, and they were trying which would hit on the best rendering of  it. Eric stuck up for the literal sublimity of \"the innumerable laughter  of the sea,\" while Upton was trying to win him over to \"the  many-twinkling smile of ocean.\" They were enjoying the discussion, and  each stoutly maintaining his own rendering, when Mr. Gordon entered.    On this occasion he was particularly angry; he had an especial dislike  of seeing the two boys together, because he fancied that the younger had  grown more than usually conceited and neglectful, since he had been  under the fifth-form patronage; and he saw in Eric's presence there, a  new case of wilful disobedience.    \"Williams, here _again!_\" he exclaimed sharply. \"Why, sir, you seem to  suppose that you may defy rules with impunity! How often have I told you  that no one is allowed to sit here, except the regular occupants?\"    His voice startled the two boys from their pleasant discussion.    \"No other master takes any notice of it, sir,\" said Upton.    \"I have nothing to do with other masters, Williams, you will bring me  the fourth Georgic, written out by Saturday morning, for your repeated  disobedience. Upton, I have a great mind to punish you also, for  tempting him to come here.\"    This was a mistake on Mr. Gordon's part, of which Upton took immediate  advantage.    \"I have no power to prevent it, sir, if he wishes it. Besides,\" he  continued, with annoying blandness of tone, \"it would be inhospitable;  and I am too glad of his company.\"    Eric smiled, and Mr. Gordon frowned. \"Williams, leave the room  instantly.\"    The boy obeyed slowly and doggedly. \"Mr. Rose never interferes with me,  when he sees me here,\" he said as he retreated.    \"Then I shall request Mr. Rose to do so in future; your conceit and  impertinence are getting intolerable.\"    Eric only answered with a fiery glance; the next minute Upton joined him  on the stairs, and Mr. Gordon heard them laughing a little  ostentatiously, as they ran out into the playground together. He went  away full of strong contempt, and from that moment began to look on the  friends as two of the worst boys in the school.    This incident had happened on Thursday, which was a half-holiday, and  instead of being able to join in any of the games, Eric had to spend  that weary afternoon in writing away at the fourth Georgic; Upton  staying in a part of the time to help him a little, by dictating the  lines to him--an occupation not unfrequently interrupted by storms of  furious denunciation against Mr. Gordon's injustice and tyranny; Eric  vowing \"that he would pay him out somehow yet.\"    The imposition was not finished that evening, and it again consumed some  of the next day's leisure, part of it being written between schools in  the forbidden class-room. Still it was not quite finished on Friday  afternoon at six, when school ended, and Eric stayed a few minutes  behind the rest to scribble off the last ten lines; which done, he  banged down the lid of his desk, not locking it, and ran out.    The next morning an incident happened which involved considerable  consequences to some of the actors in my story.    Mr. Rose and several other masters had not a room to themselves, like  Mr. Gordon, but heard their forms in the great hall. At one end of this  hall was a board used for the various school notices, to which there  were always affixed two or three pieces of paper containing  announcements about examinations and other matters of general interest.    On Saturday morning (when Eric was to give up his Georgic), the boys, as  they dropped into the hall for morning school, observed a new notice on  the board, and, thronging round to see what it was, read these words,  written on a half-sheet of paper, attached by wafers to the board--    \"GORDON IS A SURLY DEVIL.\"    As may be supposed, so completely novel an announcement took them all  very much by surprise, and they wondered who had been so audacious as to  play this trick. But their wonder was cut short by the entrance of the  masters, and they all took their seats, without any one tearing down the  dangerous paper.    After a few minutes the eye of the second master, Mr. Ready, fell on the  paper, and, going up, he read it, stood for a moment transfixed with  astonishment, and then called Mr. Rose.    Pointing to the inscription, he said: \"I think we had better leave that  there, Rose, exactly as it is, till Dr. Rowlands has seen it. Would you  mind asking him to step in here?\"    Just at this juncture Eric came in, having been delayed by Mr. Gordon  while he rigidly inspected the imposition. As he took his seat, Montagu,  who was next him, whispered--    \"I say, have you seen the notice-board?\"    \"No. Why?\"    \"Why, some fellow has been writing up an opinion of Gordon not very  favorable.\"    \"And serve him right, too, brute!\" said Eric, smarting with the memory  of his imposition.    \"Well, there'll be no end of a row; you'll see.\"    During this conversation, Dr. Rowlands came in with Mr. Rose. He read  the paper, frowned, pondered a moment, and then said to Mr. Rose--\"Would  you kindly summon the lower school into the hall? As it would be painful  to Mr. Gordon to be present, you had better explain to him how  matters stand.\"    \"Halloa! here's a rumpus!\" whispered Montagu; \"he never has the lower  school down for nothing.\"    A noise was heard on the stairs, and in flocked the lower school. When  they had ranged themselves on the vacant forms, there was a dead silence  and hush of expectation.    \"I have summoned you all together,\" said the Doctor, \"on a most serious  occasion. This morning, on coming into the school-room, the masters  found that the notice-board had been abused for the purpose of writing  up an insult to one of our number, which is at once coarse and wicked.  As only a few of you have seen it, it becomes my deeply painful duty to  inform you of its purport; the words are these--'Gordon is a surly  devil.'\"--A _very_ slight titter followed this statement, which was  instantly succeeded by a sort of thrilling excitement; but Eric, when he  heard the words, started perceptibly, and colored as he caught Montagu's  eye fixed on him.    Dr. Rowlands continued--\"I suppose this dastardly impertinence has been  perpetrated by some boy out of a spirit of revenge. I am perfectly  amazed at the unparalleled audacity and meanness of the attempt, and it  may be very difficult to discover the author of it. But, depend upon it,  discover him _we will_, at whatever cost. Whoever the offender may be,  and he must be listening to me at this moment, let him be assured that  he shall _not_ be unpunished. His guilty secret shall be torn from him.  His punishment can only be mitigated by his instantly yielding  himself up.\"    No one stirred, but during the latter part of this address Eric was so  uneasy, and his cheek burned with such hot crimson, that several eyes  were upon him, and the suspicions of more than one boy were awakened.    \"Very well,\" said the head master, \"the guilty boy is not inclined to  confess. Mark, then; if his name has not been given up to me by to-day  week, every indulgence to the school will be forfeited, the next whole  holiday stopped, and the coming cricket-match prohibited.\"    \"The handwriting may be some clue,\" suggested Mr. Ready. \"Would you have  any objection to my examining the note-books of the Shell?\"    \"None at all. The Shell-boys are to show their books to Mr. Ready  immediately.\"    The head-boy of the Shell collected the books, and took them to the  desk; the three masters glanced casually at about a dozen, and suddenly  stopped at one. Eric's heart beat loud, as his saw Mr. Rose point  towards him.    \"We have discovered a handwriting which remarkably resembles that on the  board. I give the offender one more chance of substituting confession  for detection.\"    No one stirred; but Montagu felt that his friend was trembling  violently.    \"Eric Williams, stand out in the room.\"    Blushing scarlet, and deeply agitated, the boy obeyed    \"The writing on the notice is exactly like yours. Do you know anything  of this shameful proceeding?\"    \"Nothing, sir,\" he murmured in a low tone.    \"Nothing whatever?\"    \"Nothing whatever, sir.\"    Dr. Rowlands' look searched him through and through, and seemed to burn  into his heart. He did not meet it, but hung his head. The Doctor felt  certain from his manner that he was guilty. He chained him to the spot  with his glance for a minute or two, and then said slowly, and with a  deep sigh--    \"Very well; I _hope_ you have spoken the truth; but whether you have or  no, we shall soon discover. The school, and especially the upper boys,  will remember what I have said. I shall now tear down the insulting  notice, and put it into your hands, Avonley, as head of the school, that  you may make further inquiries.\" He left the room, and the boys resumed  their usual avocation till twelve o'clock. But poor Eric could hardly  get through his ordinary pursuits; he felt sick and giddy, until  everybody noticed his strange embarrassed manner, and random answers.    No sooner had twelve o'clock struck, than the whole school broke up into  knots of buzzing and eager talkers.    \"I wonder who did it,\" said a dozen voices at once.    \"The writing was undoubtedly Williams',\" suggested some.    \"And did you notice how red and pale he got when the Doctor spoke to  him, and how he hung his head?\"    \"Yes; and one knows how he hates Gordon.\"    \"Ay; by the bye, Gordon set him a Georgic only on Thursday, and he has  been"]]]
