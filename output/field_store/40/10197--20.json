It would certainly have been better had you  returned the music as soon as it had been performed; for at that period I  could have produced it here, whereas now, unluckily, it comes too late; but  I only say _unluckily_ because it prevents my being able to spare the  worthy ladies the expenses of copying. At any other time I would on no  account have allowed them to pay for writing out the works, but it so  happens that at this moment I am visited with every kind of _contretemps_,  so I cannot avoid doing so. Possibly Herr O., although with the best  intentions, has delayed informing you of this, which obliged me to apply to  him for repayment of the expenses of copying; perhaps, too, in my haste, I  did not express myself distinctly. You can now, esteemed sir, have the  Overture and the Chorus again if you require them.    I feel convinced that in any event you will prevent my confidence being  abused; in the mean time you may keep the Overture on the conditions I have  stated. If I find that I am able to pay for the copying, I will redeem it  for my own use.    The score of the Oratorio is a gift, and also the Overture to \"Egmont.\"  Keep the parts of the Oratorio beside you till you can have it performed.    Select whatever you choose for the concert which I hear you now intend to  give, and if you decide on the Chorus and the Overture, they shall be  forwarded to you at once. For the future concert, for the benefit of the  venerable Ursulines, I promise you an entirely new symphony at all events,  and perhaps also a work of some importance for voices, and as I have now a  favorable opportunity, the copying shall not cost you a farthing. My joy  would be beyond all bounds if the concert were to be successful, and I  could spare you all expense;--at all events, take my good-will for granted.    Remember me to the admirable teachers of the children, and say to them that  I shed tears of joy at the happy result of my poor good-will, and that so  far as my humble capabilities can serve them, they shall always find in me  the warmest sympathy.    My cordial thanks for your invitation; I would fain become acquainted with  the interesting scenery of Styria, and possibly I may one day enjoy that  pleasure. Farewell! I heartily rejoice in having found in you a friend to  the poor and needy, and am always yours to command.    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN, M.P.      89.    TO JOSEPH FREIHERR VON SCHWEIGER, CHAMBERLAIN OF THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.[1]    1812.    The most insignificant of mortals has just been to wait on his gracious  master, when he found everything closed; so he came here, where indeed all  was _open_, but no one to be found except the trusty servant. I had a heavy  packet of music with me, in order to ensure a good musical evening before  we parted; but in vain. Malfatti[2] is resolved that I shall go to Toeplitz,  which is anything but agreeable to me. As, however, I must obey, I hope at  least that my gracious master will not enjoy himself quite so much without  me. _O vanitas!_ for it is nothing else. Before I set off for Toeplitz I  will either go to Baden to see you or write. Farewell! Pray present my  homage to my gracious master, and continue your regard for    Your friend,    [K.] BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: The journey to Toeplitz took place in the year 1812.]    [Footnote 2: A very celebrated physician in Vienna at that time, consulted  by Beethoven.]      90.    TO VARENNA,--GRATZ.    Toeplitz, July 19, 1812.    My thanks have been too long delayed for all the dainties which the worthy  ladies sent for my enjoyment; being constantly ill in Vienna, I was at last  forced to take refuge here.    However, better late than never; so I beg you will say all sorts of kind  things in my name to the admirable Ursuline ladies, though I did not  deserve so much gratitude; indeed it is rather for me to thank Him who  enables me to render my art occasionally useful to others. When you next  wish to make use of my poor abilities for the benefit of the venerable  ladies, you have only to write to me.    A new symphony is now ready for you, and as the Archduke Rudolph has had it  copied out, it will cost you nothing. Perhaps I may one of these days be  able to send you something vocal. I only wish and hope that you will not  ascribe my anxiety to serve these venerable ladies to a certain degree of  vanity or desire for fame, as this would grieve me exceedingly. If these  good ladies wish to do me any service in return, I beg they will include me  with their pupils in their pious orisons. I remain, with esteem,    Your friend,    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.    I shall remain here for some weeks; so if there is any occasion to write,  address to me here.      91.    WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF THE SINGER, MDME. AUGUSTE SEBALD.    Toeplitz, August 8, 1812.    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN,      Who even if you would,    Forget you never should.      92.    TO H.R. HIGHNESS THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    Franzensbrunn, Aug. 12, 1812.    It was my bounden duty long ago to have recalled myself to Y.R.H.'s  recollection, but partly my occupations and the state of my health, as well  as my own insignificance, made me reluctant to do so. I missed Y.R.H. by  one night only in Prague; for when proceeding to pay my respects to you in  the morning, I found you had set off the very night before. In Toeplitz I  heard a military band four times a day,--the only musical report which I  can give you. I was a great deal with Goethe.[1] My physician Staudenheim,  however, ordered me off to Carlsbad,[2] and from thence here, and probably  I shall have to go back to Toeplitz from this. What flights! And yet it  seems very doubtful whether any improvement in my condition has hitherto  taken place. I receive the best accounts of Y.R.H.'s health, and also of  the persistent devotion you exhibit towards the musical Muse. Y.R.H. has no  doubt heard of a concert that I gave for the benefit of the sufferers by  fire in the Stadt Baden,[3] assisted by Herr Polledro.[4] The receipts were  nearly 1000 florins W.W., and if I had not been restricted in my  arrangements we might easily have taken 2000 florins. It was literally a  _poor concert for the poor_. I could only find at the publisher's here some  of my earlier sonatas with violin accompaniments, and as Polledro had set  his heart on these, I was obliged to content myself with playing an old  Sonata.[5] The entire concert consisted of a trio, in which Polledro  played, my Sonata with violin, then again something was played by Polledro,  and, lastly, I extemporized. Meanwhile I do sincerely rejoice that by this  means something has fallen to the share of the poor _Badeners_. Pray deign  to accept my best wishes for your welfare, and my entreaty that you will  sometimes think of me.    [K.]    [Footnote 1: Beethoven speaks very briefly of his meeting with Goethe.  Goethe in his _Tag- und Jahrschriften_ of 1812 makes no allusion to  Beethoven during his stay at Toeplitz. It does not, therefore, appear that  either of these master-minds found any particular pleasure in each other  when they met personally. Beethoven, indeed, dedicated to \"the immortal  Goethe\" (1812) his composition the _Meeresstille und glueckliche Fahrt_, but  only wrote once to him in 1823 to obtain a subscription from the Grand Duke  of Weimar for his Grand Mass, and received no answer from Goethe. In the  complete edition of Goethe's works Beethoven's name is only once mentioned  by Goethe, when he refers to his funeral obsequies.]    [Footnote 2: Dr. Staudenheim was, like Malfatti, one of the most celebrated  physicians in Vienna. Beethoven, too, was well acquainted with Staudenheim,  but in his regimen he neither followed the prescriptions of Staudenheim nor  of Malfatti.]    [Footnote 3: The Stadt Baden, near Vienna, had been visited on July 16th by  a most destructive conflagration.]    [Footnote 4: Giov. Batt. Polledro, Kapellmeister in Turin, born 1776,  travelled through Germany as a violinist from 1809 to 1812. He gave a  concert in Vienna in March, 1812.]    [Footnote 5: The violin Sonata with pianoforte was probably Op. 47  (composed in 1803 and published in 1805, according to Thayer, No. 111), or  one of his earlier compositions, Op. 30, or 24, or 23.]      93.    TO BETTINA VON ARNIM.    Toeplitz, August 15, 1812.    MY MOST DEAR KIND FRIEND,--    Kings and princes can indeed create professors and privy-councillors, and  confer titles and decorations, but they cannot make great men,--spirits  that soar above the base turmoil of this world. There their powers fail,  and this it is that forces them to respect us.[1] When two persons like  Goethe and myself meet, these grandees cannot fail to perceive what such as  we consider great. Yesterday, on our way home, we met the whole Imperial  family; we saw them coming some way off, when Goethe withdrew his arm from  mine, in order to stand aside; and, say what I would, I could not prevail  on him to make another step in advance. I pressed down my hat more firmly  on my head, buttoned up my great-coat, and, crossing my arms behind me, I  made my way through the thickest portion of the crowd. Princes and  courtiers formed a lane for me; Archduke Rudolph took off his hat, and the  Empress bowed to me first. These great ones of the earth _know me_. To my  infinite amusement, I saw the procession defile past Goethe, who stood  aside with his hat off, bowing profoundly. I afterwards took him sharply to  task for this; I gave him no quarter, and upbraided him with all his sins,  especially towards you, my dear friend, as we had just been speaking of  you. Heavens! if I could have lived with you as _he_ did, believe me I  should have produced far greater things. A musician is also a poet, he too  can feel himself transported into a brighter world by a pair of fine eyes,  where loftier spirits sport with him and impose heavy tasks on him.

West was no sooner out of the street  where his brother lived, but he ordered the coach to drive to a certain  place where he had appointed Dykes to meet him, and there they expressed  a great deal of mutual satisfaction at the trick West had played his  brother. However, the latter was no great gainer in the end, for Mr.  West, senior, soon finding out the contrivance, forever renounced him,  and Jeddediah being soon after arrested for twelve pounds due to his  tailor, was carried to prison and remained there without the least  assistance from his brother, till after his friend Dykes was hanged.    The last mentioned malefactor, unmoved by all the tender entreaties of  his friends, and the glaring prospect before him of his own ruin, went  still on at the old rate, and whenever gaming had brought him low in  cash, took up with the road, or some such like dishonest method to  recruit it. At last he had the ill-luck to commit a robbery in Stepney  parish, in the road between Mile End and Bow, upon one Charles Wright,  to whose bosom clapping a pistol, he commanded him to deliver  peacefully, or he would shoot him through the body. The booty he took  was very inconsiderable, being only a penknife, an ordinary seal, and  five shillings and eightpence in money. A poor price for life, since two  days after he was apprehended for this robbery, committed to Newgate and  condemned the next sessions.    His behaviour under these unhappy circumstances was very mean, and such  as fully showed what difference there is between courage and that  resolution which is necessary to support the spirits and calm our  apprehensions at the certain approach of a violent death. I forbear  attempting any description of those unutterable torments which the  exterior marks of a distracted behaviour fully showed that this poor  wretch endured. And as I have nothing more to add of him, but that he  confessed his having been guilty of a multitude of ill acts, he  submitted at last with greater cheerfulness than he had ever shown  during his confinement to that shameful death which the Law had ordained  for his crimes, on the 23rd of October, 1721, when he was about  twenty-three years of age.

Although originally intended for vagrants, early in the 18th          century it was turned into a house of detention for criminals.          The Life of RICHARD JAMES, a Highwayman      The misfortune of not having early a virtuous education is often so  great a one as never to be retrieved, and it happens frequently (as far  as human capacity will give us leave to judge) that those prove  remarkably wicked and profligate for want of it who if they had been so  happy as to have received it, would probably have led an honest and  industrious life. I am led to this observation at present by the  materials which lay before me for the composition of this life.    Richard James was the son of a nobleman's cook, but he knew little more  of his father than that he left him to the wide world while very young;  and so at about twelve years of age he was sent to sea. There he had the  misfortune to be taken prisoner by the Spaniards, who he acknowledged  treated him with great humanity, and a house-painter taking a great  liking to him, received him into his house, taught him his profession,  and used him with the same tenderness as if he had been his nearest  relation.    But fondness for his country exciting in him a continual desire of  seeing England again, at last he found a means to return before he was  seventeen; and after this, being in England but a very small time, he  totally disobliged what few friends he had left, by his silly marriage  to a poor girl younger than himself. As is common enough in such mad  adventures, the woman's friends were as much disobliged as his, and so  not knowing how to subsist together, Richard was obliged to betake him  to his old profession of the sea.    The first voyage he made was to the West Indies, where he had the  misfortune to be taken by pirates, and by them being set on shore, he  was reduced almost to downright starving. However, begging his way to  Boston in New England, he from thence found a method of returning home  once again. The first thing he did was to enquire for his wife. But she,  under a pretence of having received advice of his death from America,  had gotten another husband; and though poor James was willing to pass  that by, yet the woman, it seems, knew better when she was well, and  under pretence of affection for two children which she had by this last  husband, absolutely refused to leave him and return back to Dick, her  first spouse. However, he did not seem to have taken this much to heart,  for in a short time he followed her example and married another wife;  but finding no method of procuring an honest livelihood, he took a short  method of living, viz., to thieving after every manner that came in his  way.    He committed a vast number of robberies in a very short space, chiefly  upon the waggoners in the Oxford Road, and sometimes, as if there were  not crime enough in barely robbing them, he added to it by the cruel  manner in which he treated them. At this rate he went on for a  considerable space, till being apprehended for a robbery of a man on  Hanwell Green, from whom he took but ten shillings, he was shortly after  convicted; and having no friends, from that time he laid aside all hope  of life.    During the space he had to prepare himself for death, he appeared so  far from being either terrified, or even unwilling to die, that he  looked upon it as a very happy relief from a very troublesome and uneasy  life, and declared, with all outward appearance of sincerity, that he  would not, even if it were in his power, procure a reprieve, or avoid  that death which could alone prove a remedy for those evils which had so  long rendered life a burden. He was very earnest to be instructed in the  duties of religion, and seemed to desire nothing else than to prepare  himself, as well as time and his melancholy circumstances would allow  him, and never from the time of his conviction showed any change in his  disposition but continued still rather to wish for his death than to  fear it. He made a very ample confession of all the robberies he had  ever done, and seemed sorrowful enough, above all, for the inhumanity  and incivility with which he had sometimes treated people.    Amongst other particulars he said that once, with his companions, having  robbed a lady in some other company of a whip, and a tortoiseshell  snuff-box with a silver rim, she earnestly desired to have them  returned, saying that as to the money they had taken they were heartily  welcome; the other thieves seemed inclinable to grant her request, but  James absolutely declared that she should not have them. However, as a  very extraordinary mark of his generosity, he took the snuff out of the  box, and putting it into a paper, gave it her back again.    At the place of execution he repeated what he had formerly said as to  his readiness of dying, adding, that if the people pitied the misfortune  he fell under of dying so ignominious a death, he no less pitied them in  the dangers and misfortunes they were sure to run through in this  miserable world. At the time of his death he was about thirty years of  age, and suffered on the same day with the criminal last mentioned.          The Life of JAMES WRIGHT, a Highwayman      James Wright, the malefactor whose life we are going to relate at  present, was born at Enfield, of very honest and industrious parents,  who, that he might get a living honestly, put him apprentice to a  peruke-maker. At this trade, after having served his time, he set up in  the Old Bailey, and lived there for some time in very good credit. But  being much given up to women, and an idle habit of life, his expenses  quickly outwent his profits, and thus in the space of some months  reduced him to downright want. This put him upon the illegal ways he  afterwards took to support himself in the enjoyment of those pleasures  which even the evils he had already felt could not make him wise enough  to shun.    He was very far from being a hardened criminal, hardly ever robbing a  passenger without tears in his eyes, and always framing resolutions to  himself of quitting that infamous manner of life, as soon as ever it  should be in his power. He fancied that as the rich could better spare  it than the poor, there was less crime in taking it from them, and  valued himself not a little that he had never injured any poor man, but  always singled out those who from their equipage were likeliest to yield  him a good booty, and at the same time not be much the worse for it  themselves. He had gone on for a considerable space in the commission of  villainies with impunity, but at last being apprehended for a robbery  committed by him in the county of Surrey, he was thereupon indicted and  tried at the ensuing assizes at Kingston, and by some means or other,  was so lucky as to be acquitted, no doubt to his very great joy; and on  this deliverance he"]]]
