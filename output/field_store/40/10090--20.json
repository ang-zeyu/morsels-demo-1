The same rights  of coalition are denied to anyone else, and in the coal-strikes in South  Wales[66] we have a lurid example--such instances could not be found in  Germany--of the absolute and unlimited right of coalition at the risk of  undoing any and every other right.    [Footnote 66: The strikes during the present war.--Author.]    The point is this: German Socialists have declared their intention to  give no allegiance to any existing form of government and to overthrow  them at the earliest possible moment. Do British Socialists accept this  part of the programme?    Throughout German Social Democratic literature we find Mr. Ramsay  Macdonald referred to as _Genosse_ Ramsay Macdonald, which means that he  is considered a full member of the brotherhood. If that is really the  case, and if he accepts their programme as one to be followed here he  would be favouring the substitution of the _volksstaat_ for the British  constitutional monarchy.    In face of this it may be asked why do British members of the Socialist  party take an oath on entering the House of Commons, and why do they  accept L400 per annum to support a national State, if they have pledged  themselves internationally to overthrow it?    The author admits his inability to solve the riddle, but during the  years 1902-1914 he has heard members of all non-Socialist German parties  assert that the German Socialists do not recognize any religious oath,  and sections of the Socialists admit this position. As a party they are  professedly atheistic; therefore when the might of the German State  compels them to take an oath--they take it with an inward  _Rueckversicherung_.    In a word, false-swearing is permitted, when one is obliged by  circumstances, to take an oath to authorities whose right and might the  oath-taker does not admit. So long ago as 1892 the Social Democrats were  publicly charged with condoning perjury in order to rescue fellow  members from the results of breaches of the law. Judge Schmidt in a  court at Breslau said in that year: \"Social Democrats have never  concealed the fact that they are hostile to any religious form of oath.  For them the religious importance and responsibility of an oath has no  meaning whatever.\" Numerous German judges and authors have expressed  themselves in a similar strain.    Readers who are interested in the point are referred to the report[67]  of the Socialist Congress held in Berlin, October, 1892. The party  leaders endeavoured to gloss the matter over with righteous indignation  and ambiguous phrases, but it nevertheless remains a fact that the  desire to counteract effectively, a tendency to perjury among Socialists  led the German Government a few years later to make perjury punishable  by penal servitude up to ten years.    [Footnote 67: All these reports may be seen in the British Museum  Reading Room. Press mark is: 08072d.]    Before leaving the _Volksstaat_ the author only wishes to state that it  lays the axe on every conception of morality, religion and social order  which we esteem. In the place of existing conditions, it would erect a  mob tyranny more degrading to the individual than Czarism or  Republicanism. The mines of Siberia and the tinned-meat factories of  Chicago may enslave the body, but the _Volksstaat_, as portrayed by  Socialist writers and speakers, promises an intellectual  tyranny--hopeless alike to body and soul; and those who have had an  opportunity to observe the brutal tyranny called \"party discipline\"  which rules the German Social Democrats, will bear the present writer  out in saying that its like, could only be found inside the German army.    The strongest, best organized and most thoroughly disciplined political  party in the world has repeatedly expressed its unalterable  determination to place national before international interests, whenever  these two should seem to be at variance. In the light of these  declarations, the action of German Socialists in giving unreserved  support to the German Government in this war, is not altogether  surprising.    Furthermore, this foundation-stone in their policy ought never to have  been left out of consideration when pondering over their ecstatic  utterances on peace and internationalism.    The communistic manifesto of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, first  published in London in the German language in 1847, contains the  following: \"Men say that we Communists wish to destroy the nationality  of the native land. Workmen have no Fatherland. It is impossible to take  away what they do not possess. The Communists scorn to conceal their  views and intentions. We declare openly, that their aims can only be  attained by the violent overthrow of all existing social orders. Let the  ruling classes tremble before a communistic revolution. The proletarians  have nothing but their chains to lose, while they have a world to  gain.\"[68]    [Footnote 68: \"Envy and greed are the two powerful levers by which the  Social Democrats are endeavouring to lift the world off its hinges. They  live by the destruction of every ideal.\" Treitschke in the \"Preussische  Jahrbuecher,\" vol. 34.]    German Socialists have incorporated these principles _in theory_ in  their programme, but _in practice_ they do not hold them, especially if  their own skins are endangered, together with the Government which is  threatened by \"violent overthrow.\" That is the sum total of their  extensive defence--literature published _since_ the outbreak of the  present war. In its naked reality that is what the guarantee-insurance  policy covered. So long as no danger threatened their own lives, goods  and chattels, such eloquence as the following extracts were shouted into  the world; but when they personally stood face to face with the Moloch  upon which for years they had heaped contemptuous abuse, then national  (_i.e._, personal) interests came first.    Herr Fischer, in his capacity as president of the Socialist Congress in  Berlin, 1892, said:    \"The reception of French delegates at Halle, and of Liebknecht at  Marseilles, have proved incontrovertibly that the struggling French  proletarians are of one mind and heart with German Social Democracy. Let  the chauvinists, burning with hate on this and that side the Rhine, urge  us on to war; let the diplomats and Governments of both countries  sacrifice the well-being of the two nations to militarism and the  war-bogey. The working-men in the two countries stretch out their hands  to each other over the frontiers as pioneers of true culture and  morality. They are convinced that there is only one enemy which  separates them, and that it is their common task to fight against and  annihilate this one enemy--capitalism.\"    \"Now as ever, we Social Democrats reply to the Government's military and  economic policy this parole: Not a man and not a farthing will be voted  for this system!\"[69]    [Footnote 69: Social Democrat members of the Reichstag in their report  to the annual congress held in Cologne, 1893.]    These quotations have been intentionally taken from speeches, etc.,  published in the early nineties of the last century. If necessary, it  would be an easy matter to fill several volumes of similar matter from  the annual congress reports down to 1913; from the vast mass of German  Social Democratic literature published between 1890 and 1914; and from  the hundred party newspapers and reviews circulated in the Fatherland,  Yet in the face of all these assurances it seemed to us that the German  Socialists had shamefully betrayed their principles on August 4th, 1914,  by giving their unreserved support to \"Germany's Holy War.\"[70]    [Footnote 70: In all Germany, and among all classes, this has become the  popular designation of the European war: \"_Unser_ heiliger Krieg.\"]    Probably the betrayal was not so shameful as it seemed, because the fact  was not made known in this country that the German Socialists had but  imitated Bismarck's policy with Russia and Austria. (Bismarck concluded  a treaty, with the one Power, then behind that Power's back he concluded  a _Rueckversicherungsvertrag_ with the other, _i.e._, a covering  insurance policy intended to protect him against all risks.)    During a quarter of a century, German Social Democrats have been the  most ardent and insistent pioneers of internationalism and  anti-militarism. But it has not been so generally known that they too  have protected their rear by a _Rueckversicherung:_ (1.) They have  consistently taught that every man must learn to bear arms, and that  both man and woman must be prepared to make any sacrifice for their  Fatherland. (2.) They have always held that national interests must be  considered before international palaver.    In Chapter I. we have seen that up till July 28th, 1914, the German  Social Democratic Party considered Austria and Germany to be entirely  responsible for the European crisis. They had then no shadow of doubt,  that Austria alone was guilty for bringing the danger of a European war  to their very doors; from that point we again take up the story.[71]    [Footnote 71: In all the mass of literature published by German  Socialists during the war I have found only one mention of their first  attitude to the war danger. On the first anniversary of the ultimatum to  Serbia (July 23rd, 1915) the _Leipziger Volkszeitung_ contains these  lines in a leading article: \"To-day we may not repeat that which we  wrote about the ultimatum in our issue of July 24th, 1914. But there was  no doubt in any section of the Press, that Europe stood on the brink of  war from the moment that ultimatum was despatched.\"]    Three days later they tacitly agreed that Russia was the guilty party  and acquiesced in the mobilization of the German army.

Anyway, we're not takin' much more chance on Nash. I  reckon it's dangerous keepin' him around. I'll have him drive me  to-day--over to Vale, an' then to Huntington. You can go along. That'll  be your last chance to pump him. Have you found out anythin'?\"    Lenore told what had transpired between her and the driver. Anderson's  face turned fiery red.    \"That ain't much to help us,\" declared, angrily. \"But it shows him  up.... So his real name's Ruenke? Fine American name, I don't think!  That man's a spy an' a plotter. An' before he's another day older I'm  goin' to corner him. It's a sure go I can't hold Jake in any longer.\"    To Lenore it was a further indication of her father's temper that when  they went down to enter the car he addressed Nash in cool, careless,  easy speech. It made Lenore shiver. She had heard stories of her  father's early career among hard men.    Jake was there, dry, caustic, with keen, quiet eyes that any subtle,  clever man would have feared. But Nash's thought seemed turned mostly  inward.    Lenore took the front seat in the car beside the driver. He showed  unconscious response to that action.    \"Jake, aren't you coming?\" she asked, of the cowboy.    \"Wal, I reckon it'll be sure dull fer you without me. Nobody to talk to  while your dad fools around. But I can't go. Me an' the boys air a-goin'  to hang some I.W.W.'s this mawnin', an' I can't miss thet fun.\"    Jake drawled his speech and laughed lazily as he ended it. He was just  boasting, as usual, but his hawklike eyes were on Nash. And it was  certain that Nash turned pale.    Lenore had no reply to make. Her father appeared to lose patience with  Jake, but after a moment's hesitation decided not to voice it.    Nash was not a good nor a careful driver under any circumstances, and  this morning it was evident he did not have his mind on his business.  There were bumps in the orchard road where the irrigation ditches  crossed.    \"Say, you ought to be drivin' a hay-wagon,\" called Anderson,  sarcastically.    At Vale he ordered the car stopped at the post-office, and, telling  Lenore he might be detained a few moments, he went in. Nash followed,  and presently came back with a package of letters. Upon taking his seat  in the car he assorted the letters, one of which, a large, thick  envelope, manifestly gave him excited gratification. He pocketed them  and turned to Lenore.    \"Ah! I see you get letters--from a woman,\" she said, pretending a poison  sweetness of jealousy.    \"Certainly. I'm not married yet,\" he replied. \"Lenore, last night--\"    \"You will never be married--to me--while you write to other women. Let  me see that letter!... Let me read it--all of them!\"    \"No, Lenore--not here. And don't speak so loud. Your father will be  coming any minute.... Lenore, he suspects me. And that cowboy knows  things. I can't go back to the ranch.\"    \"Oh, you must come!\"    \"No. If you love me you've got to run off with me to-day.\"    \"But why the hurry?\" she appealed.    \"It's getting hot for me.\"    \"What do you mean by that? Why don't you explain to me? As long as you  are so strange, so mysterious, how can I trust you? You ask me to run  off with you, yet you don't put confidence in me.\"    Nash grew pale and earnest, and his hands shook.    \"But if I do confide in you, then will you come with me?\" he queried,  breathlessly.    \"I'll not promise. Maybe what you have to tell will prove--you--you  don't care for me.\"    \"It 'll prove I do,\" he replied, passionately.    \"Then tell me.\" Lenore realized she could no longer play the part she  had assumed. But Nash was so stirred by his own emotions, so carried  along in a current, that he did not see the difference in her.    \"Listen. I tell you it's getting hot for me,\" he whispered. \"I've been  put here--close to Anderson--to find out things and to carry out orders.  Lately I've neglected my job because I fell in love with you. He's your  father. If I go on with plans--and harm comes to him--I'll never get  you. Is that clear?\"    \"It certainly is,\" replied Lenore, and she felt a tightness at her  throat.    \"I'm no member of the I.W.W.,\" he went on. \"Whatever that organization  might have been last year, it's gone wild this year.... There are  interests that have used the I.W.W. I'm only an agent, and I'm not high  up, either. I see what the government will do to the I.W.W. if the  Northwest leaves any of it. But just now there're plots against a few  big men like your father. He's to be ruined. His crops and ranches  destroyed. And he's to be killed. It's because he's so well known and  has so much influence that he was marked. I told you the I.W.W. was  being used to make trouble. They are being stirred up by agitators,  bribed and driven, all for the purpose of making a great disorder in the  Northwest.\"    \"Germany!\" whispered Lenore.    \"I can't say. But men are all over, and these men work in secret. There  are American citizens in the Northwest--one right in this valley--who  have plotted to ruin your father.\"    \"Do you know who they are?\"    \"No, I do not.\"    \"You are for Germany, of course?\"    \"I have been. My people are German. But I was born in the U.S. And if it  suits me I will be for America. If you come with me I'll throw up this  dirty job, advise Glidden to shift the plot from your father to some  other man--\"    \"So it's Glidden!\" exclaimed Lenore.    Nash bit his lip, and for the first time looked at Lenore without  thinking of himself. And surprise dawned in his eyes.    \"Yes, Glidden. You saw him speak to me up in the Bend, the first time  your father went to see Dorn's wheat. Glidden's playing the I.W.W.  against itself. He means to drop out of this deal with big money....Now  I'll save your father if you'll stick to me.\"    Lenore could no longer restrain herself. This man was not even big in  his wickedness. Lenore divined that his later words held no truth.    \"Mr. Ruenke, you are a detestable coward,\" she said, with quivering  scorn. \"I let you imagine--Oh! I can't speak it!... You--you--\"    \"God! You fooled me!\" he ejaculated, his jaw falling in utter amaze.    \"You were contemptibly easy. You'd better jump out of this car and run.  My father will shoot you.\"    \"You deceitful--cat!\" he cried, haltingly, as anger overcame his  astonishment. \"I'll--\"    Anderson's big bulk loomed up behind Nash. Lenore gasped as she saw her  father, for his eyes were upon her and he had recognized events.    \"Say, Mister Ruenke, the postmaster says you get letters here under  different names,\" said Anderson, bluntly.    \"Yes--I--I--get them--for a friend,\" stammered the driver, as his face  turned white.    \"You lyin' German pup!... I'll look over them letters!\" Anderson's big  hand shot out to clutch Nash, holding him powerless, and with the other  hand he searched Nash's inside coat pockets, to tear forth a packet of  letters. Then Anderson released him and stepped back. \"Get out of that  car!\" he thundered.    Nash made a slow movement, as if to comply, then suddenly he threw on  the power. The car jerked forward.    Anderson leaped to get one hand on the car door, the other on Nash. He  almost pulled the driver out of his seat. But Nash held on desperately,  and the car, gaining momentum, dragged Anderson. He could not get his  feet up on the running-board, and suddenly he fell.    Lenore screamed and tore frantically at the handle of the door. Nash  struck her, jerked her back into the seat. She struggled until the car  shot full speed ahead. Then it meant death for her to leap out.    \"Sit still, or you'll kill yourself.\" shouted Nash, hoarsely.    Lenore fell back, almost fainting, with the swift realization of what  had happened.          CHAPTER IX    Kurt Dorn had indeed no hope of ever seeing Lenore Anderson again, and  he suffered a pang that seemed to leave his heart numb, though  Anderson's timely visit might turn out as providential as the saving  rain-storm. The wheat waved and rustled as if with renewed and bursting  life. The exquisite rainbow still shone, a beautiful promise, in the  sky. But Dorn could not be happy in that moment.    This day Lenore Anderson had seemed a bewildering fulfilment of the  sweetness he had imagined was latent in her. She had meant what was  beyond him to understand. She had gently put a hand to his lips, to  check the bitter words, and he had dared to kiss her soft fingers. The  thrill, the sweetness, the incomprehensible and perhaps imagined  response of her pulse would never leave him. He watched the big car  until it was out of sight.    The afternoon was only half advanced and there were numberless tasks to  do. He decided he could think and plan while he worked. As he was about  to turn away he espied another automobile, this one coming from the  opposite direction to that Anderson had taken. The sight of it reminded  Dorn of the I.W.W. trick of throwing phosphorus cakes into the wheat. He  was suspicious of that car. It slowed down in front of the Dorn  homestead, turned into the yard, and stopped near where Dorn stood. The  dust had caked in layers upon it. Someone hailed him and asked if this  was the Dorn farm. Kurt answered in the affirmative, whereupon a tall  man, wearing a long linen coat, opened the car door to step out. In the  car remained the driver and another man.    \"My name is Hall,\" announced the stranger, with a pleasant manner. \"I'm  from Washington, D.C. I represent the government and am in the Northwest  in the interest of the Conservation Commission. Your name has been  recommended to me as one of the progressive young wheat-growers of the  Bend; particularly that you are an American, located in a country  exceedingly important to the United States just now--a country where  foreign-born people predominate.\"    Kurt, somewhat startled and awed, managed to give a courteous greeting  to his visitor, and asked him into the house.
