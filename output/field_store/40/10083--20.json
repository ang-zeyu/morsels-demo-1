And  other writers, even if they had no political connection, borrowed their  manners from those who had. It was the animosities of party politics that  set the general tone. Billingsgate that had grown along the wharves of the  lower river, was found to be of service in Parliament and gave a spice and  sparkle even to a book review. Presently a large part of literary England  wore the tags of political preference. Writers were often as clearly  distinguished as were the ladies in the earlier day, when Addison wrote his  paper on party patches. There were seats of Moral Philosophy to be handed  out, under-secretaryships, consular appointments. It is not enough to say  that Francis Jeffrey was a reviewer, he was as well a Whig and was running  a Review that was Whig from the front cover to the back. Leigh Hunt was not  merely a poet, for he was also a radical, and therefore in the opinions of  Tories, a believer in immorality and indecency. No matter how innocent  a title might appear, it was held in suspicion, on the chance that it  assailed the Ministry or endangered the purity of England. William Gifford  was more than merely the editor of the Quarterly Review, for he was as well  a Tory editor whose duty it was to pry into Whiggish roguery. Lockhart and  Wilson, who wrote in Blackwood's, were Tories tooth and nail, biting and  scratching for party. Nowadays, literature, having found the public to be  its most profitable patron, works hard and even abjectly for its favor.  Although there are defects in the arrangement, it must be confessed that  the divorce of literature from politics contributes to the general peace of  the household.    The Edinburgh Review was founded in 1802, the Quarterly Review in 1809,  Blackwood's Magazine in 1817. These three won distinction among others of  less importance, and from them only I quote. In 1802, when Tory rule was  strongest and Lord Eldon flourished, there was living in Edinburgh a group  of young men who were for the most part briefless barristers. Their case  was worse because they were Whigs. Few cases came their way and no offices.  These young men were Francis Jeffrey, Francis Horner, Henry Brougham, and  there was also Sydney Smith who had just come to Edinburgh from an English  country parish. The eldest was thirty-one, the youngest twenty-three.  Although all of them had brilliant lives before them, not one of them had  made as yet more than a step toward his accomplishment. Sydney Smith had  been but lately an obscure curate, buried in the middle of Salisbury Plain,  away from all contact with the world. Francis Jeffrey had been a hack  writer in London, had studied medicine, had sought unsuccessfully a  government position in India, had written poor sonnets, and was now  lounging with but a scanty occupation in the halls of the law courts.  Francis Horner had just come to the Scottish bar straight from his studies.  Henry Brougham, who in days to come was to be Lord Chancellor of England  and to whose skill in debate the passing of the Great Reform bill of 1832  is partly due, is also just admitted to the practice of the law.    The founding of the Review was casual. These men were accustomed to meet of  an evening for general discussion and speculation. It happened one night as  they sat together--the place was a garret if legend is to be believed--that  Sydney Smith lamented that their discussions came to nothing, for they were  all Whigs, all converted to the cause; whereas if they could only bring  their opinions to the outside public they could stir opinion. From so  slight a root the Review sprouted. Sydney Smith was made editor and kept  the position until after the appearance of the first number, when Jeffrey  succeeded him. The Review became immediately a power, appearing quarterly  and striking its blows anonymously against a sluggish government, lashing  the Tory writers, and taking its part, which is of greater consequence, in  the promulgation of the Whig reforms which were to ripen in thirty years  and convert the old into modern England. In the destruction of outworn  things, it was, as it were, a magazine of Whig explosives.    The Quarterly Review was the next to come and it was Tory. John Murray, the  London publisher, had been the English distributor of the Edinburgh Review.  In 1809, two considerations moved him to found in London a review to rival  the Scotch periodical. First the Tory party was being hard hit by the  Edinburgh Review and there was need of defense and retaliation. In the  second place, John Murray saw that if his publishing house was to flourish,  it must provide this new form of literature that had become so popular.  For the very shortness of the essays and articles, in which extensive  conditions were summarized for quick digestion, had met with English  approval as well as Scotch. People had become accustomed, says Bagehot, of  taking \"their literature in morsels, as they take sandwiches on a journey.\"  Murray appealed to George Canning, then in office, for assistance and was  introduced to William Gifford as a man capable of the undertaking, who  would also meet the favor of the government party. The rise of the  Quarterly Review was not brilliant. It did not fill the craving for  novelty, inasmuch as the Edinburgh was already in the field. Furthermore,  there is not the opportunity in defense for as conspicuous gallantry as in  offensive warfare.    It was eight years before another enduring review was started. William  Blackwood of Edinburgh had grown like Murray from a bookseller to a  publisher, and he, too, looked for a means of increasing his prestige. He  had launched a review the year previously, in 1816, but it had foundered  when it was scarcely off the ways. His second attempt he was determined  must be successful. His new editors were John G. Lockhart and John Wilson,  and the new policy, although nominally Tory, was first and last the  magazine's notoriety. It hawked its wares into public notice by sensational  articles and personal vilification. Wilson was thirty-two and Lockhart  twenty-three, yet they were as mischievous as boys. In their pages is found  the most abominable raving that has ever passed for literary criticism.  They did not need any party hatred to fire them. William Blackwood  welcomed any abuse that took his magazine out of \"the calm of respectable  mediocrity.\" Anything that stung or startled was welcome to a place in its  pages.    So Blackwood's was published and Edinburgh city, we may be sure, set up a  roar of delight and anger. Never before had one's friends been so assailed.  Never before had one's enemies been so grilled. How pleasing for a Tory  fireside was the mud bath with which it defiled Coleridge, who was--and you  had always known it--\"little better than a rogue.\" One's Tory dinner was  the more toothsome for the hot abuse of the Chaldee Manuscript. What stout  Tory, indeed, would doze of an evening on such a sheet! There followed  of course cases of libel. The editors even found it safer, after the  publication of the first number, to retire for a time to the country until  the city cooled.    I choose now to turn to the pages of these three reviews and set out before  you samples of their criticisms, in order that you may contrast them  with our own literary judgments. I warn you in fairness that I have been  disposed to choose the worst, yet there are hundreds of other criticisms  but little better. Of the three reviews, Blackwood's was the least  seriously political in its policy, yet its critical vilifications are the  worst. The Edinburgh Review, the most able of the three and the most in  earnest in politics, is the least vituperative. With this introduction, let  us shake the pepperpot and lay out the strong vinegar of our feast!    In the judgment of the Edinburgh Review, Tom Moore, who had just published  his \"Odes and Epistles\" but had not yet begun his Irish melodies, is a man  who \"with some brilliancy of fancy, and some show of classical erudition  ... may boast, if the boast can please him, of being the most licentious of  modern versifiers, and the most poetical of those who, in our times, have  devoted their talents to the propagation of immorality. We regard his book,  indeed, as a public nuisance.... He sits down to ransact the impure places  of his memory for inflammatory images and expressions, and commits them  laboriously in writing, for the purpose of insinuating pollution into the  minds of unknown and unsuspecting readers.\"    Francis Jeffrey wrote this, and Moore challenged him to fight. The police  interfered, and as Jeffrey put it, \"the affair ended amicably. We have  since breakfasted together very lovingly. He has expressed penitence for  what he has written and declared that he will never again apply any little  talents he may possess to such purpose: and I have said that I shall be  happy to praise him whenever I find that he has abjured these objectionable  topics.\" It was Sydney Smith who said of Jeffrey he would \"damn the solar  system--bad light--planets too distant--pestered with comets. Feeble  contrivance--could make a better with great ease.\"    Jeffrey reviewed Wordsworth and found in the \"Lyrical Ballads\"  \"vulgarity, affectation and silliness.\" He is alarmed, moreover, lest  his \"childishness, conceit and affectation\" spread to other authors. He  proposes a poem to be called \"Elegiac Stanzas to a Sucking Pig,\" and of  \"Alice Fell\" he writes that \"if the publishing of such trash as this be  not felt as an insult on the public taste, we are afraid it cannot be  insulted.\" When the \"White Doe of Rylstone\" was published--no prime  favorite, I confess, of my own--Jeffrey wrote that it had the merit of  being the very worst poem he ever saw imprinted in a quarto volume. \"It  seems to us,\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10027"],[0,"The Triple Alliance, Its Trials and Triumphs (#17)"],[1,"after this encounter with Noaks that  our three friends were called upon to attend a mass meeting of the Third  Form, to consider the advisability of starting a periodical in  opposition to the school magazine.  Important events connected with a  later period of their life at Ronleigh render it necessary that we  should not linger too long over the account of their first term; but  some mention, however brief, should certainly be made of the memorable  gathering to which we have referred.  A notice pinned on to the  black-board, and pulled down as soon as Mr. Watford entered the  classroom, announced the project in the following words:--                                \"NOTICE.\"          \"A meeting will be held in the 'old lab' directly           after dinner to-day, to make plans for starting a           magazine in opposition to _The Ronleian_.           All members of the Third Form are specially requested           to attend.\"                                        \"FLETCHER II.\"                                      \"J. A. BIBBS.\"    \"You must come,\" said \"Rats\" to Diggory; \"it'll be an awful lark.\"    \"But what's it all about?\"    \"Oh, you'll hear when you get there.  It's Fletcher's idea; he wants to  start a new magazine.  Eastfield, who edits _The Ronleian_, is Maxton's  cousin; so Maxton's going to interrupt and get some other fellows to do  the same.  I'm going to be part of the opposition,\" added the youthful  \"Rats,\" beaming with delight, \"and I have got a whole heap of paper bags  I'm going to burst while Fletcher's speaking.\"    The \"old lab,\" as it was called, was a small brick building which stood  on one side of the asphalt playground.  A new laboratory having recently  been fitted up elsewhere, the former one was, for the time being,  unused.  It was not more than about fifteen feet long by seven or eight  feet wide; and as \"The Happy Family\" mustered in force, the place was  crowded to overflowing.  The door having been closed, Fletcher Two  mounted a low stone sink which ran along the end wall, and from this  ready-made platform commenced to address the assembly :--    \"Gentlemen,--We've met here, as you know, to talk over starting a fresh  magazine.  _The Ronleian_ is a beastly swindle, and it's high time we  had something different.\"  (A voice, \"No, 'tisn't,\" and the bursting of  a paper bag.)  \"You shut up there!  I say it is a swindle: they didn't  give any account of that fourth eleven match against Robertson's second,  and they made fun of us in the 'Quad Gossip,' and said that in  'The Happy Family' there was a preponderance of monkey.\"  (\"So there is,  and you're it!\"  Laughter and another explosion.)    \"What I propose is that we start a manuscript magazine for the Third  Form, and that every fellow promise to take that, and never to buy a  copy of the other.  We might pass it round, and charge a penny each to  look at it.  Will you all subscribe?\"    No one spoke, the silence only being broken by the sound of \"Rats\"  blowing up another bag, which caused a fresh burst of laughter.    \"Will you all subscribe?\" once more demanded the speaker.    There were mingled cries of \"Yes!\" and \"No!\" and a stentorian yell of  \"No, you cuckoo! of course we won't,\" from Maxton, and another  explosion.    \"Look here, young 'Rats,' if you burst any more of those bags I'll come  down and burst your head.--I forgot to say, gentlemen, that Mr. Bibbs  has promised to assist in editing the paper; and I will now call upon  him to give you an account of what it will contain.\"    Bibbs, the Third Form genius, was regarded by every one as a huge joke,  and the very mention of his name caused a fresh burst of merriment.  He was a sad-faced, untidy-looking boy, quick and clever enough in some  things, and equally dull and stupid in others.  The announcement that he  would address the meeting had no sooner been made than half a dozen  willing pairs of hands seized and hoisted him on to the platform; though  no sooner had he attained this exalted position than two or three voices  ordered him in a peremptory manner to \"Come down!\"    The greater part of the audience not caring the toss of a button whether  Fletcher started his magazine or not, but thinking that it was rather  good fun to interrupt the proceedings, now joined the opposition, and  the unfortunate Bibbs was subjected to a brisk fire of chaff.  One facetious class-mate, standing close to the sink, offered to sell  him by auction; and hammering on the stones with the fragment of a bat  handle, knocked him down for threepence to another joker, who said he'd  do for a pen-wiper.    \"Sing a song, Bibbs!\" cried one voice; \"Where's your neck-tie?\" asked  another; \"What are you grinning at?\" demanded a third; while the object  of these pleasantries stood, with a vacant smile upon his face,  nervously fumbling with his watch-chain.    \"Go on!\" cried Fletcher, who had descended from the platform to make  room for his colleague; \"say something, you fool!\"    \"The magazine is to be written on exercise-book paper,\" began Bibbs, and  had only got thus far when he was interrupted by a perfect salvo of  paper bags which little \"Rats\" discharged in quick succession.    With an exclamation of wrath Fletcher made a dive in the direction of  the offender, and in a moment the whole gathering was in a state of  confusion.  The majority of those present siding with \"Rats,\" began to  hustle Fletcher, while two gentlemen having dragged Bibbs from his  perch, jumped up in his stead, and began to execute a clog-dance.    In the midst of this commotion Maxton elbowed his way through the crush,  and having pushed the two boys off the sink, mounted it himself,  crying,--    \"Look here, I'm going to speak; just you listen a minute.  The reason  why Bibbs wants to start a new magazine is because he wrote a novel  once, and sent it to _The Ronleian_ to come out so much each month,  and they wouldn't have it.\"    \"Shut up, Maxton!\" cried Fletcher, rushing to the spot; \"you've only  come here on purpose to interrupt.  Let's turn him out!\"    \"Yes, turn him out!\" echoed the audience, who by this time were just in  the spirit for \"ragging,\" and would have ejected friend or foe alike for  the sport of the thing--\"turn him out!\"    The two clog-dancers being quite ready to avenge the interruption of  their performance, formed themselves into a storming-party, and carried  the platform by assault.  Maxton, struggling all the way, was dragged to  the door, and cast out into the playground.  Most of the restless  spirits in the audience requiring a short breathing-space to recover  their wind after the tussle, there followed a few moments' quiet, which  Fletcher immediately took advantage of to mount the sink and resume the  business of the meeting.    \"The magazine,\" he began, \"is going to be written on exercise-book  paper.  Any one who likes can contribute, and it's going to be more  especially a paper for the Third Form.\"    The speaker went on to show that the periodical was destined to supply a  long-felt want.  _The Ronleian_ ignored the doings of boys in the lower  half of the school, and returned their contributions with insulting  suggestions, pencilled on the margins, that the authors should devote  some of their spare time and energy to the study of their English  grammars and spelling-books.  _The Third Form Chronicle_, as it was to  be called, would recognize the fact that junior boys had as much right  to be heard as seniors, and would afford them the opportunity of airing  their views on any subject they chose to bring forward.    Fletcher had barely time to proceed thus far with his speech when an  alarming interruption occurred, which put an immediate stop to his  further utterance.  Nearly at the top of the end wall there had formerly  been a ventilator; this, for one reason or another, had been removed,  and in the brickwork an open space about a foot square had been left.  A hissing noise was suddenly heard outside, and the next moment a stream  of water shot through the aperture, and descended in a perfect deluge on  the heads of the company.    The fact was that Maxton, ever a reckless young villain, had discovered  a hose fixed to one of the mains close to the building, and had  immediately seized upon it as an instrument wherewith to wreak vengeance  on his companions for having turned him out of the meeting.    Words cannot describe the uproar and confusion which followed.  As one  man the whole assembly made for the door, but only to find it fastened  on the outside.  The water flew all over the small building, drenching  every one in turn.  Some howled, some laughed, and only Bibbs had  sufficient presence of mind to creep under the sink, which afforded a  certain amount of shelter from the falling flood.    The deluge ceased as suddenly as it had begun, and an instant later the  door was flung open, and the figure of a Sixth Form boy was seen barring  the exit.    \"Now, then,\" he demanded, \"what are you youngsters making this awful  row for?  I've a jolly good mind to take all your names.\"    There was a moment's silence.  Then Fletcher's voice was heard  exclaiming,--    \"Oh! it's only old 'Thirsty;' he's all right.\"    \"Here, not so fast,\" answered the prefect, blocking up the doorway as  some boys tried to escape; \"what are you chaps doing in here? I thought  you'd been told to keep out.\"    The originator of the meeting pushed his way through the crowd, and  taking hold of the big fellow's arm in a familiar manner, said,--    \"Oh, it's all right, 'Thirsty,' old chap.  We just came inside, and some  one squirted water all over us, and that's why we shouted.  But we won't  do it again.\"    \"Oh, but it isn't all right,\" returned the other.  \"If I find any of you  in here again, I'll help you out with the toe of my boot.  Go on! I'll  let you off this once.\"    The crowd rushed forth and quickly dispersed.    \"That Thurston seems an awful decent chap,\""]]]
