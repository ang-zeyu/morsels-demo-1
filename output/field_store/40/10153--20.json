Your Majesty's commands shall be obeyed.                                                             [_Exit_.    KING.                        [_Rising and addressing his_ WARDER.    Vetravati, lead the way to the chamber of the consecrated  fire[77].    WARDER.    This way, Sire.    KING.    [_Walking on, with the air of one oppressed by the cares of  Government_.    People are generally contented and happy when they have gained  their desires; but kings have no sooner attained the object of  their aspirations than all their troubles begin.      'Tis a fond thought that to attain the end    And object of ambition is to rest;    Success doth only mitigate the fever    Of anxious expectation; soon the fear    Of losing what we have, the constant care    Of guarding it, doth weary. Ceaseless toil    Must be the lot of him who with his hands    Supports the canopy that shields his subjects.    TWO HERALDS[78].                            [_Behind the scenes_.    May the King be victorious!    FIRST HERALD.      Honour to him who labours day by day    For the world's weal, forgetful of his own;    Like some tall tree that with its stately head    Endures the solar beam, while underneath    It yields refreshing shelter to the weary.    SECOND HERALD.      Let but the monarch wield his threatening rod    And e'en the guilty tremble; at his voice    The rebel spirit cowers; his grateful subjects    Acknowledge him their guardian; rich and poor    Hail him a faithful friend--a loving kinsman.    KING.    Weary as I was before, this complimentary address has refreshed  me.                                                         [_Walks on_.    WARDER.    Here is the terrace of the hallowed fire-chamber, and yonder  stands the cow that yields the milk for the oblations. The sacred  enclosure has been recently purified, and looks clean and  beautiful. Ascend, Sire.    KING. [Leans on the shoulders of his attendants and ascends_.    Vetravati, what can possibly be the message that the venerable  Kanwa has sent me by these hermits?      Perchance their sacred rites have been disturbed    By demons, or some evil has befallen    The innocent herds, their favourites, that graze    Within the precincts of the hermitage,    Or haply, through my sins, some withering blight    Has nipped the creeping plants that spread their arms    Around the hallowed grove. Such troubled thoughts    Crowd through my mind, and fill me with misgiving.    WARDER.    If you ask my opinion, Sire, I think the hermits merely wish to  take an opportunity of testifying their loyalty, and are  therefore come to offer homage to your majesty.    _Enter the_ HERMITS _leading_ [S']AKOONTALA, _attended by_ GAUTAMI;  _and in advance of them, the_ CHAMBERLAIN _and the_ DOMESTIC  PRIEST.    CHAMBERLAIN.    This way, reverend Sirs, this way.    [S']ARNGARAVA    O [S']aradwata,      'Tis true the monarch lacks no royal grace,    Nor ever swerves from justice; true, his people,    Yea such as in life's humblest walks are found,    Refrain from evil courses; still to me,    A lonely hermit reared in solitude,    This throng appears bewildering, and I seem    To look upon a burning house, whose inmates    Are running to and fro in wild dismay.    [S']ARADWATA.    It is natural that the first sight of the King's capital should  affect you in this manner; my own sensations are very similar.      As one just bathed beholds the man polluted;    As one late purified, the yet impure;    As one awake looks on the yet unawakened;    Or as the freeman gazes on the thrall,    So I regard this crowd of pleasure-seekers.    [S']AKOONTALA.      [_Feeling a quivering sensation in her right eyelid_ [79]_, and                                            suspecting a bad omen_.    Alas! what means this throbbing of my right eyelid?    GAUTAMI.    Heaven avert the evil omen, my child! May the guardian deities of  thy husband's family convert it into a sign of good fortune!    [_Walks on_.    PRIEST.    [_Pointing to the King_.    Most reverend Sirs, there stands the protector of the four  classes of the people; the guardian of the four conditions of the  priesthood[80]. He has just left the judgment-seat, and is  waiting for you. Behold him!    [S']ARNGARAVA    Great Brahman, we are happy in thinking that the King's power is  exerted for the protection of all classes of his subjects. We  have not come as petitioners--we have the fullest confidence in  the generosity of his nature.      The loftiest trees bend humbly to the ground    Beneath the teeming burden of their fruit;    High in the vernal sky the pregnant clouds    Suspend their stately course, and, hanging low,    Scatter their sparkling treasures o'er the earth;    And such is true benevolence; the good    Are never rendered arrogant by riches.     WARDER.    So please your Majesty, I judge from the placid countenance of  the hermits that they have no alarming message to deliver.    KING.                                  [_Looking at [S']AKOONTALA_.    But the lady there--      Who can she be, whose form of matchless grace    Is half concealed beneath her flowing veil?    Among the sombre hermits she appears    Like a fresh bud 'mid sear and yellow leaves.    WARDER.    So please your Majesty, my curiosity is also roused, but no  conjecture occurs to my mind. This at least is certain, that she  deserves to be looked at more closely.    KING.    True; but it is not right to gaze at another man's wife[120].    [S']AKOONTALA.             [_Placing her hand on her bosom. Aside_.    O my heart, why this throbbing? Remember thy lord's affection,  and take courage.    PRIEST.                                             [_Advancing_.    These holy men have been received with all due honour. One of  them has now a message to deliver from his spiritual superior.  Will your Majesty deign to hear it?    KING.    I am all attention.    HERMITS.                                [_Extending their hands_.    Victory to the King!    KING.    Accept my respectful greeting.    HERMITS.    May the desires of your soul be accomplished!    KING.    I trust no one is molesting you in the prosecution of your  religious rites.    HERMITS.      Who dares disturb our penitential rites    When thou art our protector? Can the night    Prevail to cast her shadows o'er the earth    While the sun's beams irradiate the sky?    KING.    Such, indeed, is the very meaning of my title--'Defender of the  Just.' I trust the venerable Kanwa is in good health. The world  is interested in his well-being.    HERMITS.    Holy men have health and prosperity in their own power. He bade  us greet your Majesty, and, after kind inquiries, deliver this  message.    KING.    Let me hear his commands.    [S']ARNGARAVA.    He bade us say that he feels happy in giving his sanction to the  marriage which your Majesty contracted with this lady, his  daughter, privately and by mutual agreement. Because,      By us thou art esteemed the most illustrious    Of noble husbands; and [S']akoontala,    Virtue herself in human form revealed.    Great Brahma hath in equal yoke united    A bride unto a husband worthy of her;    Henceforth let none make blasphemous complaint    That he is pleased with ill-assorted unions[81].    Since, therefore, she expects soon to be the mother of thy child,  receive her into thy palace, that she may perform, in conjunction  with thee, the ceremonies prescribed by religion on such an  occasion.    GAUTAMI.    So please your Majesty, I would add a few words; but why should  I intrude my sentiments when an opportunity of speaking my mind  has never been allowed me?      She took no counsel with her kindred; thou    Didst not confer with thine, but all alone    Didst solemnize thy nuptials with thy wife.    Together, then, hold converse; let us leave you.    [S']AKOONTALA                                             [_Aside_.    Ah! how I tremble for my lord's reply.    KING.    What strange proposal is this?    [S']AKOONTALA                                             [_Aside_.    His words are like fire to me.    [S']ARNGARAVA    What do I hear? Dost thou, then, hesitate? Monarch, thou art well  acquainted with the ways of the world, and knowest that      A wife, however virtuous and discreet,    If she live separate from her wedded lord,    Though under shelter of her parent's roof,    Is marked for vile suspicion. Let her dwell    Beside her husband, though he hold her not    In his affection. So her kinsmen will it.    KING.    Do you really mean to assert that I ever married  this lady?    [S']AKOONTALA.                              [_Despondingly. Aside_.    O my heart, thy worst misgivings are confirmed.    [S']ARNGARAVA.    Is it becoming in a monarch to depart from the rules of justice,  because he repents of his engagements?    KING.    I cannot answer a question which is based on a mere fabrication.    [S']ARNGARAVA.    Such inconstancy is fortunately not common, except in men  intoxicated by power.    KING.    Is that remark aimed at me?    GAUTAMI.    Be not ashamed, my daughter. Let me remove thy veil for a little  space. Thy husband will then recognize thee.                                                 [_Removes her veil_.    KING.                                   [_Gazing at_ [S']AKOONTALA. _Aside_.      What charms are here revealed before mine eyes!    Truly no blemish mars the symmetry    Of that fair form; yet can I ne'er believe    She is my wedded wife; and like a bee    That circles round the flower whose nectared cup    Teems with the dew of morning, I must pause    Ere eagerly I taste the proffered sweetness.                                       [_Remains wrapped in thought_.    WARDER.    How admirably does our royal master's behaviour prove his regard  for justice! Who else would hesitate for a moment when good  fortune offered for his acceptance a form of such rare beauty?    [S']ARNGARAVA.    Great King, why art thou silent?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12187"],[0,"The Mystery of 31 New Inn (#17)"],[1,". I knew that he had an opium-pipe which he brought with  him when he came home from Japan; but I thought it was only a curio. I  remember him telling me that he once tried a few puffs at an opium-pipe  and found it rather pleasant, though it gave him a headache. But I had  no idea he had contracted the habit; in fact, I may say that I was  utterly astonished when the fact came out at the inquest.\"    Thorndyke made a note of this answer, too, and said:    \"I think that is all I have to ask you about your uncle Jeffrey. And now  as to Mr. John Blackmore. What sort of man is he?\"    \"I am afraid I can't tell you very much about him. Until I saw him at  the inquest, I had not met him since I was a boy. But he is a very  different kind of man from Uncle Jeffrey; different in appearance and  different in character.\"    \"You would say that the two brothers were physically quite unlike,  then?\"    \"Well,\" said Stephen, \"I don't know that I ought to say that. Perhaps I  am exaggerating the difference. I am thinking of Uncle Jeffrey as he was  when I saw him last and of uncle John as he appeared at the inquest.  They were very different then. Jeffrey was thin, pale, clean shaven,  wore spectacles and walked with a stoop. John is a shade taller, a shade  greyer, has good eyesight, a healthy, florid complexion, a brisk,  upright carriage, is distinctly stout and wears a beard and moustache  which are black and only very slightly streaked with grey. To me they  looked as unlike as two men could, though their features were really of  the same type; indeed, I have heard it said that, as young men, they  were rather alike, and they both resembled their mother. But there is no  doubt as to their difference in character. Jeffrey was quiet, serious  and studious, whereas John rather inclined to what is called a fast  life; he used to frequent race meetings, and, I think, gambled a good  deal at times.\"    \"What is his profession?\"    \"That would be difficult to tell; he has so many; he is so very  versatile. I believe he began life as an articled pupil in the  laboratory of a large brewery, but he soon left that and went on the  stage. He seems to have remained in 'the profession' for some years,  touring about this country and making occasional visits to America. The  life seemed to suit him and I believe he was decidedly successful as an  actor. But suddenly he left the stage and blossomed out in connection  with a bucket-shop in London.\"    \"And what is he doing now?\"    \"At the inquest he described himself as a stockbroker, so I presume he  is still connected with the bucket-shop.\"    Thorndyke rose, and taking down from the reference shelves a list of  members of the Stock Exchange, turned over the leaves.    \"Yes,\" he said, replacing the volume, \"he must be an outside broker. His  name is not in the list of members of 'the House.' From what you tell  me, it is easy to understand that there should have been no great  intimacy between the two brothers, without assuming any kind of  ill-feeling. They simply had very little in common. Do you know of  anything more?\"    \"No. I have never heard of any actual quarrel or disagreement. My  impression that they did not get on very well may have been, I think,  due to the terms of the will, especially the first will. And they  certainly did not seek one another's society.\"    \"That is not very conclusive,\" said Thorndyke. \"As to the will, a  thrifty man is not usually much inclined to bequeath his savings to a  gentleman who may probably employ them in a merry little flutter on the  turf or the Stock Exchange. And then there was yourself; clearly a more  suitable subject for a legacy, as your life is all before you. But this  is mere speculation and the matter is not of much importance, as far as  we can see. And now, tell me what John Blackmore's relations were with  Mrs. Wilson. I gather that she left the bulk of her property to Jeffrey,  her younger brother. Is that so?\"    \"Yes. She left nothing to John. The fact is that they were hardly on  speaking terms. I believe John had treated her rather badly, or, at any  rate, she thought he had. Mr. Wilson, her late husband, dropped some  money over an investment in connection with the bucket-shop that I spoke  of, and I think she suspected John of having let him in. She may have  been mistaken, but you know what ladies are when they get an idea into  their heads.\"    \"Did you know your aunt well?\"    \"No; very slightly. She lived down in Devonshire and saw very little of  any of us. She was a taciturn, strong-minded woman; quite unlike her  brothers. She seems to have resembled her father's family.\"    \"You might give me her full name.\"    \"Julia Elizabeth Wilson. Her husband's name was Edmund Wilson.\"    \"Thank you. There is just one more point. What has happened to your  uncle's chambers in New Inn since his death?\"    \"They have remained shut up. As all his effects were left to me, I have  taken over the tenancy for the present to avoid having them disturbed. I  thought of keeping them for my own use, but I don't think I could live  in them after what I have seen.\"    \"You have inspected them, then?\"    \"Yes; I have just looked through them. I went there on the day of the  inquest.\"    \"Now tell me: as you looked through those rooms, what kind of impression  did they convey to you as to your uncle's habits and mode of life?\"    Stephen smiled apologetically. \"I am afraid,\" said he, \"that they did  not convey any particular impression in that respect. I looked into the  sitting-room and saw all his old familiar household gods, and then I  went into the bedroom and saw the impression on the bed where his corpse  had lain; and that gave me such a sensation of horror that I came away  at once.\"    \"But the appearance of the rooms must have conveyed something to your  mind,\" Thorndyke urged.    \"I am afraid it did not. You see, I have not your analytical eye. But  perhaps you would like to look through them yourself? If you would, pray  do so. They are my chambers now.\"    \"I think I should like to glance round them,\" Thorndyke replied.    \"Very well,\" said Stephen. \"I will give you my card now, and I will look  in at the lodge presently and tell the porter to hand you the key  whenever you like to look over the rooms.\"    He took a card from his case, and, having written a few lines on it,  handed it to Thorndyke.    \"It is very good of you,\" he said, \"to take so much trouble. Like Mr.  Marchmont, I have no expectation of any result from your efforts, but I  am very grateful to you, all the same, for going into the case so  thoroughly. I suppose you don't see any possibility of upsetting that  will--if I may ask the question?\"    \"At present,\" replied Thorndyke, \"I do not. But until I have carefully  weighed every fact connected with the case--whether it seems to have any  bearing or not--I shall refrain from expressing, or even entertaining,  an opinion either way.\"    Stephen Blackmore now took his leave; and Thorndyke, having collected  the papers containing his notes, neatly punched a couple of holes in  their margins and inserted them into a small file, which he slipped into  his pocket.    \"That,\" said he, \"is the nucleus of the body of data on which our  investigations must be based; and I very much fear that it will not  receive any great additions. What do you think, Jervis?\"    \"The case looks about as hopeless as a case could look,\" I replied.    \"That is what I think,\" said he; \"and for that reason I am more than  ordinarily keen on making something of it. I have not much more hope  than Marchmont has; but I shall squeeze the case as dry as a bone before  I let go. What are you going to do? I have to attend a meeting of the  board of directors of the Griffin Life Office.\"    \"Shall I walk down with you?\"    \"It is very good of you to offer, Jervis, but I think I will go alone. I  want to run over these notes and get the facts of the case arranged in  my mind. When I have done that, I shall be ready to pick up new matter.  Knowledge is of no use unless it is actually in your mind, so that it  can be produced at a moment's notice. So you had better get a book and  your pipe and spend a quiet hour by the fire while I assimilate the  miscellaneous mental feast that we have just enjoyed. And you might do a  little rumination yourself.\"    With this, Thorndyke took his departure; and I, adopting his advice,  drew my chair closer to the fire and filled my pipe. But I did not  discover any inclination to read. The curious history that I had just  heard, and Thorndyke's evident determination to elucidate it further,  disposed me to meditation. Moreover, as his subordinate, it was my  business to occupy myself with his affairs. Wherefore, having stirred  the fire and got my pipe well alight, I abandoned myself to the renewed  consideration of the facts relating to Jeffrey Blackmore's will.          Chapter VII    The Cuneiform Inscription      The surprise which Thorndyke's proceedings usually occasioned,  especially to lawyers, was principally due, I think, to my friend's  habit of viewing occurrences from an unusual standpoint. He did not look  at things quite as other men looked at them. He had no prejudices and he  knew no conventions. When other men were cocksure, Thorndyke was  doubtful. When other men despaired, he entertained hopes; and thus it  happened that he would often undertake cases that had been rejected  contemptuously by experienced lawyers, and, what is more, would bring  them to a successful issue.    Thus it had been in the only other case in which I had been personally  associated with him--the so-called \"Red Thumb Mark\" case. There he was  presented with an apparent impossibility; but he had given it careful  consideration. Then, from the category of the impossible he had brought  it to that of the possible; from the merely possible to the actually  probable; from the probable to the certain; and in the end"]]]
