This he imagined would put an end to all feuds  and quarrels among men, which generally arose on account of one of the two.  Kobâd himself embraced the opinions of this impostor, to whom he gave leave,  according to his new doctrine, to lie with the queen his wife; which  permission Anushirwân, his son, with much difficulty prevailed on Mazdak not  to make use of.  These sects had certainly been the immediate ruin of the  Persian empire, had not Anushirwân, as soon as he succeeded his father, put  Mazdek to death with all his followers, and the Manicheans also, restoring the  ancient Magian religion.2     In the reign of this prince, deservedly surnamed the Just, Mohammed was  born.  He was the last king of Persia who deserved the throne, which after him  was almost perpetually contended for, till subverted by the Arabs.  His son  Hormûz lost the love of his subjects by his excessive cruelty; having had his  eyes put out by his wife's brothers, he was     1  Ockley's Hist. of the Saracens, vol. i. p. 19, &c. 2  Vide Poc. Spec.  p. 70.          obliged to resign the crown to his son Khosrû Parvîz, who at the instigation  of Bahrâm Chubîn had rebelled against him, and was afterwards strangled.  Parvîz was soon obliged to quit the throne to Bahrâm; but obtaining succours  of the Greek emperor Maurice, he recovered the crown: yet towards the latter  end of a long reign he grew so tyrannical and hateful to his subjects, that  they held private correspondence with the Arabs; and he was at length deposed,  imprisoned, and slain by his son Shirûyeh.1  After Parvîz no less than six  princes possessed the throne in less than six years.  These domestic broils  effectually brought ruin upon the Persians; for though they did rather by the  weakness of the Greeks, than their own force, ravage Syria, and sack Jerusalem  and Damascus under Khosrû Parvîz; and, while the Arabs were divided and  independent, had some power in the province of Yaman, where they set up the  four last kings before Mohammed; yet when attacked by the Greeks under  Heraclius, they not only lost their new conquests, but part of their own  dominions; and no sooner were the Arabs united by Mohammedism, than they beat  them in every battle, and in a few years totally subdued them.     As these empires were weak and declining, so Arabia, at Mohammed's setting  up, was strong and flourishing; having been peopled at the expense of the  Grecian empire, whence the violent proceedings of the domineering sects forced  many to seek refuge in a free country, as Arabia then was, where they who  could not enjoy tranquility and their conscience at home, found a secure  retreat.  The Arabians were not only a populous nation, but unacquainted with  the luxury and delicacies of the Greeks and Persians, and inured to hardships  of all sorts; living in a most parsimonious manner, seldom eating any flesh,  drinking no wine, and sitting on the ground.  Their political government was  also such as favoured the designs of Mohammed; for the division and  independency of their tribes were so necessary to the first propagation of his  religion, and the foundation of his power, that it would have been scarce  possible for him to have effected either, had the Arabs been united in one  society.  But when they had embraced his religion, the consequent union of  their tribes was no less necessary and conducive to their future conquests and  grandeur.     This posture of public affairs in the eastern world, both as to its  religious and political state, it is more than probably Mohammed was well  acquainted with; he having had sufficient opportunities of informing himself  in those particulars, in his travels as a merchant in his younger years: and  though it is not to be supposed his views at first were so extensive as  afterwards, when they were enlarged by his good fortune, yet he might  reasonably promise himself success in his first attempts from thence.  As he  was a man of extraordinary parts and address, he knew how to make the best of  every incident, and turn what might seem dangerous to another, to his own  advantage.     Mohammed came into the world under some disadvantages, which he soon  surmounted.  His father Abd'allah was a younger son2 of Abd'almotalleb, and  dying very young and in his father's lifetime, left       1  Vide Teixeira, Relaciones de los Reyes de Persia, p. 195, &c.   2  He was not his eldest son, as Dr. Prideaux tells us, whose  reflections built on that foundation must necessarily fail (see his Life of  Mahomet, p. 9); nor yet his youngest son, as M. De Boulainvilliers (Vie de  Mahommed, p. 182, &c) supposes; for Hamza and al Abbâs were both younger than  Abd'allah.          his widow and infant son in very mean circumstances, his whole substance  consisting but of five camels and one Ethiopian she-slave.1  Abd'almotalleb  was therefore obliged to take care of his grandchild Mohammed, which he not  only did during his life, but at his death enjoined his eldest son Abu Tâleb,  who was brother to Abd'allah by the same mother, to provide for him for the  future; which he very affectionately did, and instructed him in the business  of a merchant, which he followed; and to that end he took him with him into  Syria when he was but thirteen, and afterward recommended him to Khadîjah, a  noble and rich widow, for her factor, in whose service he behaved himself so  well, that by making him her husband she soon raised him to an equality with  the richest in Mecca.     After he began by this advantageous match to live at his ease, it was that  he formed the scheme of establishing a new religion, or, as he expressed it,  of replanting the only true and ancient one, professed by Adam, Noah, Abraham,  Moses, Jesus, and all the prophets,2 by destroying the gross idolatry into  which the generality of his countrymen had fallen, and weeding out the  corruptions and superstitions which the latter Jews and Christians had, as he  thought, introduced into their religion, and reducing it to its original  purity, which consisted chiefly in the worship of the one only GOD.     Whether this was the effect of enthusiasm, or only a design to raise  himself to the supreme government of his country, I will not pretend to  determine.  The latter is the general opinion of the Christian writers, who  agree that ambition, and the desire of satisfying his sensuality, were the  motives of his undertaking.  It may be so; yet his first views, perhaps, were  not so interested.  His original design of bringing the pagan Arabs to the  knowledge of the true GOD, was certainly noble, and highly to be commended;  for I cannot possibly subscribe to the assertion of a late learned writer,3  that he made the nation exchange their idolatry for another religion  altogether as bad.  Mohammed was no doubt fully satisfied in his conscience of  the truth of his grand point, the unity of GOD, which was what he chiefly  attended to; all his other doctrines and institutions being rather accidental  and unavoidable, than premeditated and designed.     Since then Mohammed was certainly himself persuaded of his grand article of  faith, which, in his opinion, was violated by all the rest of the world; not  only by the idolaters, but by the Christians, as well those who rightly  worshipped Jesus as GOD, as those who superstitiously adored the Virgin Mary,  saints, and images; and also by the Jews, who are accused in the Korân of  taking Ezra for the son of GOD;4 it is easy to conceive that he might think it  a meritorious work to rescue the world from such ignorance and superstition;  and by degrees, with the help of a warm imagination, which an Arab seldom  wants,5 to suppose himself destined by providence for the effecting that great  reformation.  And this fancy of his might take still deeper root in his mind,  during the solitude he thereupon affected, usually retiring for a month in the  year to a cave in Mount Hara, near Mecca.  One thing which may be probably  urged against the enthusiasm of this prophet of       1  Abulfeda, Vit. Moham. p. 2.  2  See Kor. c. 2.  3  Prideaux's Life of Mahomet, p. 76.  4  Kor. c. 9.  5  See  Casaub. of Enthusiasm, p. 148.          the Arabs, is the wise conduct and great prudence he all along showed in  pursuing his design, which seem inconsistent with the wild notions of a hot-  brained religionist.  But though all enthusiasts or madmen do not behave with  the same gravity and circumspection that he did, yet he will not be the first  instance, by several, of a person who has been out of the way only quoad hoc,  and in all other respects acted with the greatest decency and precaution.     The terrible destruction of the eastern churches, once so glorious and  flourishing, by the sudden spreading of Mohammedism, and the great successes  of its professors against the Christians, necessarily inspire a horror of that  religion in those to whom it has been so fatal; and no wonder if they  endeavour to set the character of its founder, and its doctrines, in the most  infamous light.  But the damage done by Mohammed to Christianity seems to have  been rather owing to his ignorance than malice; for his great misfortune was,  his not having a competent knowledge of the real and pure doctrines of the  Christian religion, which was in his time so abominably corrupted, that it is  not surprising if he went too far, and resolved to abolish what he might think  incapable of reformation.     It is scarce to be doubted but that Mohammed had a violent desire of being  reckoned an extraordinary person, which he could attain to by no means more  effectually, than by pretending to be a messenger sent from GOD, to inform  mankind of his will.  This might be at first his utmost ambition; and had his  fellow-citizens treated him less injuriously, and not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7446"],[0,"The Naturalist in La Plata (#16)"],[1," afford to despise the wing-power of its quarry; and I have  sometimes thought that it takes a tyrannous delight in witnessing the  consternation caused by its hollow trumpeting sound. This may be only a  fancy, but some hawks do certainly take pleasure in pursuing and  striking birds when not seeking prey. The peregrine has been observed,  Baird says, capturing birds, only to kill and drop them. Many of the  Felidae, we know, evince a similar habit; only these prolong their  pleasure by practising a more refined and deliberate cruelty.    The sudden appearance overhead of this hawk produces an effect wonderful  to witness. I have frequently seen all the inhabitants of a marsh struck  with panic, acting as if demented, and suddenly grown careless to all  other dangers; and on such occasions I have looked up confident of  seeing the sharp-winged death, suspended above them in the sky. All  birds that happen to be on the wing drop down as if shot into the reeds  or water; ducks away from the margin stretch out their necks  horizontally and drag their bodies, as if wounded, into closer cover;  not one bird is found bold enough to rise up and wheel about the  marauder--a usual proceeding in the case of other hawks; while, at every  sudden stoop the falcon makes, threatening to dash down on his prey, a  low cry of terror rises from the birds beneath; a sound expressive of an  emotion so contagious that it quickly runs like a murmur all over the  marsh, as if a gust of wind had swept moaning through, the rushes. As  long as the falcon hangs overhead, always at a height of about forty  yards, threatening at intervals to dash down, this murmuring sound, made  up of many hundreds of individual cries, is heard swelling and dying  away, and occasionally, when he drops lower than usual, rising to a  sharp scream of terror.    Sometimes when I have been riding over marshy ground, one of these hawks  has placed himself directly over my head, within fifteen or twenty yards  of me; and it has perhaps acquired the habit of following a horseman in  this way in order to strike at any birds driven up. On one occasion my  horse almost trod on a couple of snipe squatting terrified in the short  grass. The instant they rose the hawk struck at one, the end of his wing  violently smiting my cheek as he stooped, and striking at the snipe on a  level with the knees of my horse. The snipe escaped by diving under the  bridle, and immediately dropped down on the other side of me, and the  hawk, rising up, flew away.    To return. I think I am justified in believing that fear of hawks, like  fear of men, is, in very nearly all cases, the result of experience and  tradition. Nevertheless, I think it probable that in some species which  have always lived in the open, continually exposed to attack, and which  are preferred as food by raptors, such as duck, snipe, and plover, the  fear of the falcon may be an inherited habit. Among passerine birds I am  also inclined to think that swallows show inherited fear of hawks.  Swallows and humming-birds have least to fear from raptors; yet, while  humming-birds readily pursue and tease hawks, thinking as little of them  as of pigeons or herons, swallows everywhere manifest the greatest  terror at the approach of a true falcon; and they also fear other birds  of prey, though in a much less degree. It has been said that the  European hobby occasionally catches swal-lows on the wing, but this  seems a rare and exceptional habit, and in South America I have never  seen any bird of prey attempt the pursuit of a swallow. The question  then arises, how did this unnecessary fear, so universal in swallows,  originate? Can it be a survival of a far past--a time when some  wide-ranging small falcon, aerial in habits as the swallow itself,  preyed by preference on hirundines only?    [NOTE.-Herbert Spencer, who accepts Darwin's inference, explains how the  fear of man, acquired by experience, becomes instinctive in birds, in  the following passage: \"It is well known that in newly-discovered lands  not inhabited by man, birds are so devoid of fear as to allow themselves  to be knocked over with sticks; but that, in the course of generations,  they acquire such a dread of man as to fly on his approach: and that  this dread is manifested by young as well as by old. Now unless this  change be ascribed to the killing-off of the least fearful, and the  preservation and multiplication of the most fearful which, considering  the comparatively small number killed by man, is an inadequate cause, it  must be ascribed to accumulated experience; and each experience must be  held to have a share in producing it. We must conclude that in each bird  that escapes with injuries inflicted by man, or is alarmed by the  outcries of other members of the flock (gregarious creatures of any  intelligence being necessarily more or less sympathetic), there is  established an association of ideas between the human aspect and the  pains, direct and in-direct, suffered from human agency. And we must  further con-clude, that the state of consciousness which compels the  bird to take flight, is at first nothing more than an ideal reproduction  of those painful impressions which before followed man's approach; that  such ideal reproduction becomes more vivid and more massive as the  painful experiences, direct or sympathetic, increase; and that thus the  emotion, in its incipient state, is nothing else than an aggregation of  the revived pains before experience.    \"As, in the course of generations, the young birds of this race begin to  display a fear of man before yet they have been injured by him, it is an  unavoidable inference that the nervous system of the race has been  organically modified by these experiences, we have no choice but to  conclude, that when a young bird is led to fly, it is because the  impression produced in its senses by the approaching man entails,  through an incipiently reflex action, a partial excitement of all those  nerves which in its ancestors had been excited under the like  conditions; that this partial excitement has its accompanying painful  consciousness, and that the vague painful consciousness thus arising  constitutes emotion proper--_emotion undecomposable into specific  experiences, and, therefore, seemingly homogeneous\"_ (Essays, vol. i. p.  320.)]    It is comforting to know that the \"unavoidable inference\" is, after all,  erroneous, and that the nervous system in birds has not yet been  organically altered as a result of man's persecution; for in that case  it would take long to undo the mischief, and we should be indeed far  from that \"better friendship\" with the children of the air which many of  us would like to see.          CHAPTER VI.    PARENTAL AND EARLY INSTINCTS.      Under this heading I have put together several notes from my journals on  subjects which have no connection with each other, except that they  relate chiefly to the parental instincts of some animals I have  observed, and to the instincts of the young at a very early period of  life.    While taking bats one day in December, I captured a female of our common  Buenos Ayrean species (Molossus bonariensis), with her two young  attached to her, so large that it seemed incredible she should be able  to fly and take insects with such a weight to drag her down. The young  were about a third less in size than the mother, so that she had to  carry a weight greatly exceeding that of her own body. They were  fastened to her breast and belly, one on each side, as when first born;  and, possibly, the young bat does not change its position, or move, like  the young developed opossum, to other parts of the body, until mature  enough to begin an independent life. On forcibly separating them from  their parent, I found that they were not yet able to fly, but when set  free fluttered feebly to the ground. This bat certainly appeared more  burdened with its young than any animal I had ever observed. I have seen  an old female opossum (Didelphys azarae) with eleven young, large as old  rats--the mother being less than a cat in size--all clinging to various  parts of her body; yet able to climb swiftly and with the greatest  agility in the higher branches of a tree. The actual weight was in this  case relatively much greater than in that of the female bat: but then  the opossum never quitted its hold on the tree, and it also supplemented  its hand-like feet, furnished with crooked claws, with its teeth and  long prehensile tail. The poor bat had to seek its living in the empty  air, pursuing its prey with the swiftness of a swallow, and it seemed  wonderful to me that she should have been able to carry about that great  burden with her one pair of wings, and withal to be active enough to  supply herself and her young with food.    In the end I released her, and saw her fly away and disappear among the  trees, after which I put back the two young bats in the place I had  taken them from, among the thick-clustering foliage of a small acacia  tree. When set free they began to work their way upwards through the  leaves and slender twigs in the most adroit manner, catching a twig with  their teeth, then embracing a whole cluster of leaves with their wings,  just as a person would take up a quantity of loose clothes and hold them  tight by pressing them against the chest. The body would then emerge  above the clasped leaves, and a higher twig would be caught by the  teeth; and so on successively, until they had got as high as they  wished, when they proceeded to hook themselves to a twig and assume the  inverted position side by side; after which, one drew in its head and  went to sleep, while the other began licking the end of its wing, where  my finger and thumb had pressed the delicate membrane. Later in the day  I attempted to feed them with small insects, but they rejected my  friendly attentions in the most unmistakable manner, snapping"]]]
