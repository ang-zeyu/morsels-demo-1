The  same spring, which comes from near the top, is crossed several times. I  met many of the Hodheyl Bedouins, with their families and flocks of  sheep, near the road. One of them gave me some milk, but would not take  any money in return; the sale of milk being considered by these Bedouins  as a scandal, though they might derive great profits from it at Mekka,  where one pound of milk is worth two piastres. I conversed freely with  the men, and with the wife of one of them. They seemed a race of hardy  mountaineers, and, although evidently poor, have a more robust and  fleshy appearance than the northern Bedouins, which I ascribe chiefly to  the healthiness of the climate, and the excellence of the water. The  Beni Hodheyl, famous in the ancient history of Arabia, were nominally  subject to the Sherif of Mekka, in whose territory they live; but they  were in fact quite independent, and often at war with him.    We were full two hours in ascending from the coffee-huts to the summit  of the mountain, from whence we enjoyed a beautiful prospect over the  low country. We discerned Wady Muna, but not Mekka; and as far as the  eye could reach, winding chains of hills appeared upon a flat surface,  towards the north and south, with narrow stripes of white sand between  them, without the slightest verdure. Close to our right rose a peak of  the mountain    [p.65] Kora, called Nakeb el Ahmar, from four to five hundred feet  higher than the place where we stood, and appearing to overtop all the  neighbouring chain. Towards the north, the mountain, about thirty miles  distant, seemed to decrease considerably in height; but southward it  continues of the same height. After half an hourÂ’s ride from the summit,  we came to a small village called Ras el Kora. Finding myself much  fatigued, I insisted upon sleeping here, with which my guide reluctantly  complied, as he had received orders to travel expeditiously.    August 28th.--The village and neighbourhood of Ras el Kora is the most  beautiful spot in the Hedjaz, and more picturesque and delightful than  any place I had seen since my departure from Lebanon, in Syria. The top  of Djebel Kora is flat, but large masses of granite lie scattered over  it, the surface of which, like that of the granite rocks near the second  cataract of the Nile, is blackened by the sun. Several small rivulets  descend from this peak, and irrigate the plain, which is covered with  verdant fields and large shady trees on the side of the granite rocks.  To those who have only known the dreary and scorching sands of the lower  country of the Hedjaz, this scene is as surprising as the keen air which  blows here is refreshing. Many of the fruit-trees of Europe are found  here,--figs, apricots, peaches; apples, the Egyptian sycamore, almonds,  pomegranates; but particularly vines, the produce of which is of the  best quality. There are no palm-trees here, and only a few nebek-trees.  The fields produce wheat, barley, and onions; but the soil being stony,  these do not succeed so well as the fruits. Every beled, as they here  call the fields, is enclosed by a low wall, and is the property of a  Hodheyl Bedouin. When Othman el Medhayfe took Tayf from the Sherif, this  place was ruined, the fields were destroyed, and many of the walls had  not yet been rebuilt.    After having passed through this delightful district, for about half an  hour, just as the sun was rising, when every leaf and blade    [p.66] of grass was covered with a balmy dew, and every tree and shrub  diffused a fragrance as delicious to the smell as was the landscape to  the eye, I halted near the largest of the rivulets, which, although not  more than two paces across, nourishes upon its banks a green Alpine  turf, such as the mighty Nile, with all its luxuriance, can never  produce in Egypt. Some of the Arabs brought us almonds and raisins, for  which we gave them biscuits; but although the grapes were ripe, we could  not obtain any, as they are generally purchased while on the vines by  the merchants of Tayf, who export them to Mekka, and keep them closely  watched by their own people till they are gathered. Here a Turkish  soldier, complimented with the title of Aga, was stationed under a tent,  to forward the provisions coming from the lower station to Tayf. I  observed with some astonishment, that not a single pleasure-house was  built on this high platform. Formerly, the Mekka merchants had their  country-seats at Tayf, which stand in a situation as desert and  melancholy, as this is cheerful and luxuriant; but none of them ever  thought of building a cottage here; a new proof of the opinion which I  have long entertained, that orientals, especially the Arabs, are much  less sensible of the beauties of nature than Europeans. The water of Ras  el Kora is celebrated throughout the Hedjaz for its excellence. While  Mohammed Ali remained at Mekka and at Djidda, he received a regular  supply of Nile water for drinking, sent from Egypt, by every fleet, in  large tin vessels; but on passing this place, he found its water  deserving of being substituted for the other: a camel comes here daily  from Tayf for a load of it.     The houses of the Hodheyl, to whom these plantations belong, are  scattered over the fields in clusters of four or five together. They are  small, built of stones and mud, but with more care than might be  expected from the rude hands of the occupants. Every dwelling comprises  three or four rooms, each of which being separated from the others by a  narrow open space, forms, as it were,    [p.67] a small detached cottage. These apartments receive no light but  from the entrance; they are very neat and clean, and contain Bedouin  furniture, some good carpets, woollen and leathern sacks, a few wooden  bowls, earthen coffee-pots, and a matchlock, of which great care is  taken, it being generally kept in a leathern case. At night I reposed  upon a large well-tanned cow-skin: the covering was formed of a number  of small sheep-skins neatly sewed together, similar to those used in  Nubia. The Hodheyl told me, that before the Wahabys came, and obliged  them to pay tribute for their fields, they knew no land-tax, but, on the  contrary, received yearly presents from the sherifs, and from all the  Mekkawys who passed this way to Tayf. Ras el Kora extends from east to  west about two and a half or three miles, and is about a mile in  breadth. According to the statements of the Arabs, many spots towards  the south, where Bedouin tribes, like the Hodheyl, cultivate the soil in  detached parts of the mountain, are equally fertile and beautiful as  that which we saw in the chain above mentioned.    We left the Ras, which will be remembered by me as long as I am sensible  to the charms of romantic scenery, and rode for about one hour over  uneven barren ground, with slight ascents and descents, till we came to  a steep declivity, to walk down which occupied us half an hour, and  double that time would be necessary for ascending it. The rock is  entirely composed of sand-stone. From the summit of the declivity just  mentioned, Tayf is seen in the distance. At half an hour from the foot  of the mountain, we entered a fertile valley, called Wady Mohram,  extending from N.W. to S.E. Like the upper district, it is full of  fruit-trees; but the few cultivated fields are watered from wells, and  not by running streams. A village, which the Wahabys had almost wholly  ruined, stands on the slope, with a small tower constructed by the  inhabitants to secure the produce of their fields against the invasion  of enemies.    [p.68] Here begins the territory of Tayf, and of the Arab tribe of  Thekyf, who, in former times, were often at war with their neighbours  the Hodheyl. The Wady is denominated Mohram, from the circumstance, that  here the pilgrims and visitors going from the eastward to Mekka, invest  themselves with the ihram before noticed. There is a small ruined stone  tank close by the road. The caravan of the Yemen pilgrims, called Hadj  el Kebsy, whose route lies along these mountains, used always to observe  the ceremony here, and the tank was then filled with water for ablution.  The husbandmen of Mohram draw the water from their wells in leathern  buckets suspended from one end of an iron chain, passed round a pulley,  and to the other end they yoke a cow, which, for want of a wheel, walks  to a sufficient distance from the well to draw up the bucket, when she  is led back to resume the same course. The cows I saw here, like all  those of the Hedjaz, are small, but of a stout, bony make: they have  generally only short stumps of horns, and a hump on the back, just over  the shoulder, about five inches in height and six in length, much  resembling in this respect the cows which I saw on the borders of the  Nile in Nubia. According to the natives, the whole chain of mountains  from hence southward, as far as the country where the coffee-plantations  begin, is intersected by similar cultivated valleys at some distance  from each other, the intermediate space consisting chiefly of barren  rocky soil.    From Wady Mohram we again crossed uneven, mountainous ground, where I  found sand-stone and silex. Acacia trees are seen in several sandy  valleys, branching out from the road. At two hours and a half from Wady  Mohram we ascended, and at the top of the hill saw Tayf lying before us.  We reached it in three hours and a half from Wady Mohram, after having  crossed the barren sandy plain which separates it from the surrounding  hills. The rate of our march from Mekka, when we were quite alone upon  our dromedaries, and able to accelerate their pace at pleasure, was not    [p.69] less than three miles, and a quarter per hour. I therefore  calculate from Mekka to the foot of Djebel Kora, about thirty-two miles;  to its top, ten miles; and from thence to Tayf,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9479"],[0,"The Boy Life of Napoleon, Afterwards Emperor of the French (#16)"],[1," they may? Have you trouble with your lessons?\" persisted  Madame Permon.    With the same dejected air, Eliza answered as before, \"No, madame.\"    \"But what, then, is the matter, my dear?\" cried Madame Permon; \"such red  eyes mean much crying.\"    Eliza was silent.    \"Come, Eliza!\" Napoleon demanded with an elder brother's authority;  \"speak! answer Madame here What is the matter?\"    But even to her brother, Eliza made no reply.    [Illustration: _\"'Come, Eliza! What is the matter?' demanded  Napoleon.\"_]    Then Madame Permon, as tenderly as if she had been the girl's mother,  led her aside; and finding a remote seat in a corner, she drew the child  into her lap.    \"Eliza,\" she said with gracious kindliness, \"I must know why you are in  sorrow. Think of me as your mother, dear; as one who must act in her  place until you return to her. Speak to me as to your mother. Let me  have your love and confidence. Tell me, my child, what troubles you.\"    The tender solicitude of her mother's friend quite vanquished Eliza's  stubbornness. Her tears burst out afresh; and between the sobs she  stammered,--    \"You know, Madame, that Lucie de Montluc leaves the school in eight  days.\"    \"I did not know it, Eliza,\" Madame Permon said, keeping back a smile;  \"but if that so overcomes you, then am I sorry too.\"    \"Oh, no, Madame'\" Eliza said, just a bit indignant at being  misunderstood; \"it is not her leaving that makes me cry; but, you see,  on the day she goes away her class will give her a good--by supper.\"    \"What! and you are not invited?\" exclaimed Madame Permon. \"Ah, that is  the trouble, Madame,\" cried Eliza, the tears gathering again. \"I am  invited.\"    \"And yet you cry?\"    \"It is because each girl is to contribute towards the supper; and I,  Madame, can give nothing. My allowance is gone.\"    \"So!\" Madame Permon whispered, glad to have at last reached the real  cause of the trouble, \"that is the matter. And you have nothing left?\"    \"Only a dollar, Madame,\" replied Eliza. \"But if I give that, I shall  have no more money; and my allowance does not come to me for six weeks.  Indeed, what I have is not enough for my needs until the six weeks are  over. Am I not miserable?\"    Napoleon, who had gradually drawn nearer the corner, thrust his hand  into his pocket as he heard Eliza's complaint. But he drew it out as  quickly. His pocket was empty. Mortified and angry, he stamped his foot  in despair. But no one noticed this pantomime.    \"How much, my dear, is necessary to quiet this great sorrow?\" Madame  Permon asked of Eliza with a smile. Eliza looked into her good friend's  eyes.    \"Oh, Madame! it is an immense sum,\" she replied,    \"Let me know the worst,\" Madame Permon said, with affected distress.  \"How much is it?\"    \"Two dollars!\" confessed Eliza in despair.    \"Two dollars!\" exclaimed Madame Permon; \"what extravagant ladies we are  at St. Cyr!\" Then she hugged Eliza to her; and, as she did so, she slyly  slipped a five-dollar piece into the girl's hand. \"Hush! take it, and  say nothing,\" she said; for, above all, she did not wish her action to  be seen by Napoleon. For Madame Permon well knew the sensitive pride of  the Bonaparte children.    Soon after they left the school; and when once they were within the  carriage Napoleon's ill-humor burst forth, in spite of himself.    \"Was ever anything more humiliating?\" he cried; \"was ever anything more  unjust? See how it is with that poor child. The rich and poor are  placed together, and the poor must suffer or be pensioners. Is it not  abominable, the way these schools of St. Cyr and the Paris military are  run? Two dollars for a scholars' picnic in a place where no child is  supposed to have money. It is enormous!\"    His friends made no reply to this boyish outburst; but, when the  military school was reached, Monsieur Permon followed Napoleon into the  parlor.    \"Napoleon,\" he said, \"at your age one is not furious against the world  unless he has particular reason.\"    \"And are not my sister's tears a reason, sir, when I cannot remedy their  cause?\" Napoleon answered with emotion.    \"But when I came here for you,\" said Monsieur Permon, \"you, too,  appeared angry, as if some trouble had occurred between yourself and  your schoolfellows.\"    \"I am unfortunate, sir, not to be able to conceal my feelings,\" said  Napoleon; \"but it does seem as if the boys here delighted in making me  feel my poverty. They live in an insolent luxury; and whoever cannot  imitate them,\"--here Napoleon dashed a hand to his forehead,--\"Oh, it is  to die of humiliation!\"    \"At your age, my Napoleon, one submits and blames no one,\" said Monsieur  Permon, smiling, in spite of himself, at the boy's desperation.    \"At my age' yes, sir,\" Napoleon rejoined, as if keeping back some  great thought. \"But later--ah, if, some day, I should ever be master!  However\"--and the French shrug that is so eloquent completed the  sentence.    \"However,\"--Monsieur Permon took up his words--\"while waiting, one may  now and then find a friend. And you take your part here with the boys,  do you not?\"    Napoleon was silent; and Monsieur Permon, remembering the trouble that  had weighed Eliza down, concluded also that some such trial might be a  part of Napoleon's school-life.    \"Let me help you, my boy,\" he said.    At this unexpected proposition Napoleon flushed deeply; then the red  tinge paled into the sallow one again, and he responded, \"I thank you,  sir, but I do not need it.\"    \"Napoleon,\" said Monsieur Permon, \"your mother is my wife's dearest  friend; your father has long been my good comrade. Is it right for  sons to refuse the love of their fathers, or for boys to reject the  friendships of their elders? Pride is excellent; but even pride may  sometimes be pernicious. It is pride that sets a barrier between you and  your companions. Do not permit it. Regard friendship as of more value  than self-consideration; and, for my sake, let me help you to join in  these occasions that may mean so much to you in the way of friendship.\"    Thus deftly did good Monseiur Permon smooth over the bitterness that  inequality in pocket allowances so often stirs between those who have  little and those who have much.    Napoleon fixed upon his father's friend one of his piercing looks, and  taking his proffered money, said:--    \"I accept it, sir, as if it came from my father, as you wish me to  consider it. But if it came as a loan, I could not receive it. My people  have too many charges already; and I ought not to increase them by  expenses which, as is often the case here, are put upon me by the folly  of my schoolfellows.\"    The Permons proved good friends to the Bonaparte children; and it  was to their house at Montpellier that, in the spring of 1785, Charles  Bonaparte was brought to die.    For ill health and misfortune proved too much for this disheartened  Corsican gentleman; and, before his boys were grown to manhood, he gave  up his unsuccessful struggle for place and fortune. He had worked hard  to do his best for his boys and girls; he had done much that the world  considers unmanly; he had changed and shifted, sought favors from the  great and rich, and taken service that he neither loved nor approved.  But he had done all this that his children might be advanced in the  world; and though he died in debt, leaving his family almost penniless,  still he had spent himself in their behalf; and his children loved and  honored his memory, and never forgot the struggles their father had  made in their behalf. In fact, much of his spirit of family devotion  descended to his famous son Napoleon, the schoolboy.          CHAPTER SIXTEEN.    LIEUTENANT PUSS-IN-BOOTS.    Napoleon returned to his studies after his father's death, poorer than  ever in pocket, and greatly distressed over his mother's condition.    For Charles Bonaparte's death had taken away from the family its main  support. The income of their uncle, the canon, was hardly sufficient  for the family's needs. Joseph gave up his endeavors, and returned  to Corsica to help his mother. But Napoleon remained at the military  school; for his future depended upon his completing his studies, and  securing a position in the army.    How much the boy had his mother in his thoughts, you may judge from this  letter which he wrote her a month after his father's death:    MY DEAR MOTHER,--Now that time has begun to soften the first transports  of my sorrow. I hasten to express to you the gratitude I feel for all  the kindness you have always displayed toward us. Console yourself, dear  mother, circumstances require that you should. We will redouble our care  and our gratitude, happy if, by our obedience, we can make up to you in  the smallest degree for the inestimable loss of a cherished husband I  finish, dear mother,--my grief compels it--by praying you to calm yours.  My health is perfect, and my daily prayer is that Heaven may grant you  the same. Convey my respects to my Aunt Gertrude, to Nurse Saveria, and  to my Aunt Fesch.    Your very humble and affectionate son,    NAPOLEON.      At the same time he wrote to his kind old uncle, the Canon Lucien,  saying: \"It would be useless to tell you how deeply I have felt the blow  that has just fallen upon us. We have lost a father; and God alone knows  what a father, and what were his attachment and devotion to us. Alas!  everything taught us to look to him as the support of our youth. But the  will of God is unalterable. He alone can console us.\"    These letters from a boy of sixteen would scarcely give one the idea  that Napoleon was the selfish and sullen youth that his enemies are  forever picturing; they rather show him as he was,--quiet, reserved,  reticent, but with a heart that could feel for others, and a sympathy  that strove to lessen, for the mother he loved, the burden of sorrow and  of loss.
