A man who was kind to a horse could not be treacherous to a man, Andrew  decided.    \"You're Hank Rainer, aren't you?\" he asked.    \"That's me. And you?\"    \"I'm the unwelcome guest, I'm afraid,\" said Andrew. \"I'm the nephew of  Jasper Lanning. I guess you'll be remembering him?\"    \"I'll forget my right hand sooner,\" said the big, red man calmly. But he  kept on looking steadily at Andrew.    \"Well,\" said Andrew, encouraged and at the same time repulsed by this  calm silence, \"my name is one you've heard. I am--\"    The other broke in hastily. \"You are Jasper Lanning's nephew. That's all  I know. What's a name to me? I don't want to know names!\"    It puzzled Andrew, but the big man ran on smoothly enough: \"Lanning  ain't a popular name around here, you see? Suppose somebody was to come  around and say, 'Seen Lanning?' What could I say, if you was here? 'I've  got a Lanning here. I dunno but he's the one you want.' But suppose I  don't know anything except you're Jasper's nephew? Maybe you're related  on the mother's side. Eh?\" He winked at Andrew. \"You come along and  don't talk too much about names.\"    He led the way into the house and picked up one of the posters, which  lay on the floor.    \"They've sent those through the mountains already?\" asked Andrew  gloomily.    \"Sure! These come down from Twin Falls. Now, a gent with special fine  eyes might find that you looked like the gent on this poster. But my  eyes are terrible bad mostly. Besides, I need to quicken up that fire.\"    He crumpled the poster and inserted it beneath the lid of his iron  stove. There was a rush and faint roar of the flame up the chimney as  the cardboard burned. \"And now,\" said Hank Rainer, turning with a broad  smile, \"I guess they ain't any reason why I should recognize you. You're  just a plain stranger comin' along and you stop over here for the night.  That all?\"    Andrew had followed this involved reasoning with a rather bewildered  mind, but he smiled faintly in return. He was bothered, in a way, by the  extreme mental caution of this fellow. It was as if the keen-eyed  trapper were more interested in his own foolish little subterfuge than  in preserving Andrew. \"Now, tell me, how is Jasper?\"    \"I've got to tell you one thing first. Dozier has raised the mountains,  and I could never cross 'em now.\"    \"Going to turn back into the plains?\"    \"No. The ranges are wide enough, but they're a prison just the same.  I've got to get out of 'em now or stay a prisoner the rest of my life,  only to be trailed down in the end. No, I want to stay right here in  your cabin until the men are quieted down again and think I've slipped  away from 'em. Then I'll sneak over the summit and get away unnoticed.\"    \"Man, man! Stay here? Why, they'll find you right off. I wonder you got  the nerve to sit there now with maybe ten men trailin' you to this  cabin. But that's up to you.\"    There was a certain careless calm about this that shook Andrew to his  center again. But he countered: \"No, they won't look specially in  houses. Because they won't figure that any man would toss up that  reward. Five thousand is a pile of money.\"    \"It sure is,\" agreed the other. He parted his red beard and looked up to  the ceiling. \"Five thousand is a considerable pile, all in hard cash.  But mostly they hunt for this Andrew Lanning a dozen at a time. Well,  you divide five thousand by ten, and you've got only five hundred left.  That ain't enough to tempt a man to give up Lanning--so bad as  all that.\"    \"Ah,\" smiled Andrew, \"but you don't understand what a stake you could  make out of me. If you were to give information about me being here, and  you brought a posse to get me, you'd come in for at least half of the  reward. Besides, the five thousand isn't all. There's at least one rich  gent that'll contribute maybe that much more. And you'd get a good half  of that. You see, Hal Dozier knows all that, and he knows there's hardly  a man in the mountains who would be able to keep away from selling me.  So that's why he won't search the houses.\"    \"Not you,\" corrected the trapper sharply. \"Andy Lanning is the man  Dozier wants.\"    \"Well, Andrew Lanning, then,\" smiled the guest. \"It was just a slip of  the tongue.\"    \"Sometimes slips like that break a man's neck,\" observed the trapper,  and he fell into a gloomy meditation.    And after that they talked of other things, until supper was cooked and  eaten and the tin dishes washed and put away. Then they lay in their  bunks and watched the last color in the west through the open door.    If a member of a posse had come to the door, the first thing his eyes  fell upon would have been Andrew Lanning lying on the floor on one side  of the room and the red-bearded man on the other. But, though his host  suggested this, Andrew refused to move his blankets. And he was right.  The hunters were roving the open, and even Hal Dozier was at fault.    \"Because,\" said Andrew, \"he doesn't dream that I could have a friend so  far from home. Not five thousand dollars' worth of friend, anyway.\"    And the trapper grunted heavily.          CHAPTER 20      It was a truth long after wondered at, when the story of Andrew Lanning  was told and retold, that he had lain in perfect security within a  six-hour ride from Tomo, while Hal Dozier himself combed the mountains  and hundreds more were out hunting fame and fortune. To be sure, when a  stranger approached, Andrew always withdrew into the horse shed; but,  beyond keeping up a steady watch during the day, he had little to do and  little to fear.    Indeed, at night he made no pretense toward concealment, but slept quite  openly on the floor on the bed of hay and blankets, just as Hank Rainer  slept on the farther side of the room. And the great size of the reward  was the very thing that kept him safe. For when men passed the cabin, as  they often did, they were riding hard to get away from Tomo and into the  higher mountains, where the outlaw might be, or else they were coming  back to rest up, and their destination in such a case was always Tomo.  The cabin of the trapper was just near enough to the town to escape  being used as a shelter for the night by stray travelers. If they got  that close, they went on to the hotel.    But often they paused long enough to pass a word with Hank, and Andrew,  from his place behind the door of the horse shed, could hear it all. He  could even look through a crack and see the faces of the strangers. They  told how Tomo was wrought to a pitch of frenzied interest by this  manhunt. Well-to-do citizens, feeling that the outlaw had insulted the  town by so boldly venturing into it, had raised a considerable  contribution toward the reward. Other prominent miners and cattlemen of  the district had come forward with similar offers, and every day the  price on the head of Andrew mounted to a more tempting figure.    It was a careless time for Andrew. After that escape from Tomo he was  not apt to be perturbed by his present situation, but the suspense  seemed to weigh more and more heavily upon the trapper. Hank Rainer was  so troubled, indeed, that Andrew sometimes surprised a half-guilty,  half-sly expression in the eyes of his host. He decided that Hank was  anxious for the day to come when Andrew would ride off and take his  perilous company elsewhere. He even broached the subject to Hank, but  the mountaineer flushed and discarded the suggestion with a wave of his  hand. \"But if a gang of 'em should ever hunt me down, even in your  cabin, Hank,\" said Andrew one day--it was the third day of his  stay--\"I'll never forget what you've done for me, and one of these days  I'll see that Uncle Jasper finds out about it.\"    The little, pale-blue eyes of the trapper went swiftly to and fro, as if  he sought escape from this embarrassing gratitude.    \"Well,\" said he, \"I've been thinkin' that the man that gets you, Andy,  won't be so sure with his money, after all. He'll have your Uncle Jasper  on his trail pronto, and Jasper used to be a killer with a gun in the  old days.\"    \"No more,\" smiled Andrew. \"He's still steady as a rock, but he hasn't  the speed any more. He's over seventy, you see. His joints sort of creak  when he tries to move with a snap.\"    \"Ah,\" muttered the trapper, and again, as he started through the open  door, \"Ah!\"    Then he added: \"Well, son, you don't need Jasper. If half what they say  is true, you're a handy lad with the guns. I suppose Jasper showed you  his tricks?\"    \"Yes, and we worked out some new ones together. Uncle Jasper raised me  with a gun in my hand, you might say.\"    \"H'm!\" said Hank Rainer.    When they were sitting at the door in the semidusk, he reverted to the  idea. \"You been seein' that squirrel that's been runnin' across the  clearin'?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I'd like to see you work your gun, Andy. It was a sight to talk about  to watch Jasper, and I'm thinkin' you could go him one better. S'pose  you stand up there in the door with your back to the clearin'. The next  time that squirrel comes scootin' across I'll say, 'Now!' and you try to  turn and get your gun on him before he's out of sight. Will you  try that?\"    \"Suppose some one hears it?\" \"Oh, they're used to me pluggin' away for  fun over here. Besides, they ain't anybody lives in hearin'.\"    And Andrew, falling into the spirit of the contest, stood up in the  door, and the old tingle of nerves, which never failed to come over him  in the crisis, was thrilling through his body again. Then Hank barked  the word, \"Now!\" and Andrew whirled on his heel. The word had served to  alarm the squirrel as well. As he heard it, he twisted about like the  snapping lash of a whip and darted back for cover, three yards away. He  covered "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9909"],[0,"Nightmare Abbey (#16)"],[1,"said, 'So, sir,  you have played your cards well. I proposed Miss Toobad to you: you  refused her. Mr Toobad proposed you to her: she refused you. You fell  in love with Marionetta, and were going to poison yourself, because,  from pure fatherly regard to your temporal interests, I withheld my  consent. When, at length, I offered you my consent, you told me I was  too precipitate. And, after all, I find you and Miss Toobad living  together in the same tower, and behaving in every respect like two  plighted lovers. Now, sir, if there be any rational solution of all  this absurdity, I shall be very much obliged to you for a small  glimmering of information.'    'The solution, sir, is of little moment; but I will leave it in  writing for your satisfaction. The crisis of my fate is come: the  world is a stage, and my direction is _exit._'    'Do not talk so, sir;--do not talk so, Scythrop. What would you have?'    'I would have my love.'    'And pray, sir, who is your love?'    'Celinda--Marionetta--either--both.'    'Both! That may do very well in a German tragedy; and the Great Mogul  might have found it very feasible in his lodgings at Kensington; but  it will not do in Lincolnshire. Will you have Miss Toobad?'    'Yes.'    'And renounce Marionetta?'    'No.'    'But you must renounce one.'    'I cannot.'    'And you cannot have both. What is to be done?'    'I must shoot myself.'    'Don't talk so, Scythrop. Be rational, my dear Scythrop. Consider, and  make a cool, calm choice, and I will exert myself in your behalf.'    'Why should I choose, sir? Both have renounced _me_: I have no hope of  either.'    'Tell me which you will have, and I will plead your cause  irresistibly.'    'Well, sir,--I will have--no, sir, I cannot renounce either. I  cannot choose either. I am doomed to be the victim of eternal  disappointments; and I have no resource but a pistol.'    'Scythrop--Scythrop;--if one of them should come to you--what then?'    'That, sir, might alter the case: but that cannot be.'    'It can be, Scythrop; it will be: I promise you it will be. Have but a  little patience--but a week's patience; and it shall be.'    'A week, sir, is an age: but, to oblige you, as a last act of  filial duty, I will live another week. It is now Thursday evening,  twenty-five minutes past seven. At this hour and minute, on Thursday  next, love and fate shall smile on me, or I will drink my last pint of  port in this world.'    Mr Glowry ordered his travelling chariot, and departed from the abbey.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER XV      The day after Mr Glowry's departure was one of incessant rain, and  Scythrop repented of the promise he had given. The next day was one of  bright sunshine: he sat on the terrace, read a tragedy of Sophocles,  and was not sorry, when Raven announced dinner, to find himself alive.  On the third evening, the wind blew, and the rain beat, and the owl  flapped against his windows; and he put a new flint in his pistol. On  the fourth day, the sun shone again; and he locked the pistol up in a  drawer, where he left it undisturbed, till the morning of the eventful  Thursday, when he ascended the turret with a telescope, and spied  anxiously along the road that crossed the fens from Claydyke: but  nothing appeared on it. He watched in this manner from ten A.M. till  Raven summoned him to dinner at five; when he stationed Crow at the  telescope, and descended to his own funeral-feast. He left open the  communications between the tower and turret, and called aloud at  intervals to Crow,--'Crow, Crow, is any thing coming?' Crow answered,  'The wind blows, and the windmills turn, but I see nothing coming;'  and, at every answer, Scythrop found the necessity of raising his  spirits with a bumper. After dinner, he gave Raven his watch to set by  the abbey clock. Raven brought it, Scythrop placed it on the table,  and Raven departed. Scythrop called again to Crow; and Crow, who had  fallen asleep, answered mechanically, 'I see nothing coming.' Scythrop  laid his pistol between his watch and his bottle. The hour-hand passed  the VII.--the minute-hand moved on;--it was within three minutes of  the appointed time. Scythrop called again to Crow: Crow answered as  before. Scythrop rang the bell: Raven appeared.    'Raven,' said Scythrop, 'the clock is too fast.'    'No, indeed,' said Raven, who knew nothing of Scythrop's intentions;  'if any thing, it is too slow.'    'Villain!' said Scythrop, pointing the pistol at him; 'it is too  fast.'    'Yes--yes--too fast, I meant,' said Raven, in manifest fear.    'How much too fast?' said Scythrop.    'As much as you please,' said Raven.    'How much, I say?' said Scythrop, pointing the pistol again.    'An hour, a full hour, sir,' said the terrified butler.    'Put back my watch,' said Scythrop.    Raven, with trembling hand, was putting back the watch, when the  rattle of wheels was heard in the court; and Scythrop, springing down  the stairs by three steps together, was at the door in sufficient time  to have handed either of the young ladies from the carriage, if she  had happened to be in it; but Mr Glowry was alone.    'I rejoice to see you,' said Mr Glowry; 'I was fearful of being too  late, for I waited till the last moment in the hope of accomplishing  my promise; but all my endeavours have been vain, as these letters  will show.'    Scythrop impatiently broke the seals. The contents were these:      Almost a stranger in England, I fled from parental tyranny,    and the dread of an arbitrary marriage, to the protection of a    stranger and a philosopher, whom I expected to find something    better than, or at least something different from, the rest of his    worthless species. Could I, after what has occurred, have    expected nothing more from you than the common-place impertinence    of sending your father to treat with me, and with mine, for me? I    should be a little moved in your favour, if I could believe you    capable of carrying into effect the resolutions which your father    says you have taken, in the event of my proving inflexible;    though I doubt not you will execute them, as far as relates to    the pint of wine, twice over, at least. I wish you much happiness    with Miss O'Carroll. I shall always cherish a grateful    recollection of Nightmare Abbey, for having been the means of    introducing me to a true transcendentalist; and, though he is a    little older than myself, which is all one in Germany, I shall    very soon have the pleasure of subscribing myself      CELINDA FLOSKY      I hope, my dear cousin, that you will not be angry with me,    but that you will always think of me as a sincere friend, who    will always feel interested in your welfare; I am sure you love    Miss Toobad much better than me, and I wish you much happiness    with her. Mr Listless assures me that people do not kill    themselves for love now-a-days, though it is still the fashion to    talk about it. I shall, in a very short time, change my name and    situation, and shall always be happy to see you in Berkeley    Square, when, to the unalterable designation of your affectionate    cousin, I shall subjoin the signature of      MARIONETTA LISTLESS    Scythrop tore both the letters to atoms, and railed in good set terms  against the fickleness of women.    'Calm yourself, my dear Scythrop,' said Mr Glowry; 'there are yet  maidens in England.'    'Very true, sir,' said Scythrop.    'And the next time,' said Mr Glowry, 'have but one string to your  bow.'    'Very good advice, sir,' said Scythrop.    'And, besides,' said Mr Glowry, 'the fatal time is past, for it is now  almost eight.'    'Then that villain, Raven,' said Scythrop, 'deceived me when he said  that the clock was too fast; but, as you observe very justly, the time  has gone by, and I have just reflected that these repeated crosses in  love qualify me to take a very advanced degree in misanthropy; and  there is, therefore, good hope that I may make a figure in the world.  But I shall ring for the rascal Raven, and admonish him.'    Raven appeared. Scythrop looked at him very fiercely two or three  minutes; and Raven, still remembering the pistol, stood quaking in  mute apprehension, till Scythrop, pointing significantly towards the  dining-room, said, 'Bring some Madeira.'

These two  powers have divided and equal dominion. Sometimes one of the two has a  temporary supremacy.--According to Mr Toobad, the present period would  be the reign of Ahrimanes. Lord Byron seems to be of the same opinion,  by the use he has made of Ahrimanes in 'Manfred'; where the great  Alastor, or [Greek: Kachos Daimon], of Persia, is hailed king of  the world by the Nemesis of Greece, in concert with three of  the Scandinavian Valkyrae, under the name of the Destinies; the  astrological spirits of the alchemists of the middle ages; an  elemental witch, transplanted from Denmark to the Alps; and a chorus  of Dr Faustus's devils, who come in the last act for a soul.
