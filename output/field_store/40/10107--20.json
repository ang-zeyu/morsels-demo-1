[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10738"],[0,"Mahomet, Founder of Islam (#17)"],[1,"came  into being. A daily service was instituted in the Mosque itself, and the  heaven-sent command to prayer five times a day for every Muslim was  enforced. Five times in every turn of the world Allah receives his  supplicatory incense; at dawn, at noon, in the afternoon, at sunset, and  at night the Muslim renders his due reverence and praise to the lord of  his welfare, thanking Allah, his supreme guide and votary, for the gift  of the Prophet, guide and protector of the Faithful. Lustration before  prayer was instituted as symbolic of the Believers' purification of heart  before entering the presence of God, and provision for the ceremony made  inside the Mosque. The public service on Friday, instituted at Coba, was  continued at Medina, and consisted chiefly of a sermon given by Mahomet  from a pulpit, erected inside the Mosque, whose sanctity was proverbial  and unassailed. Thus the seed was sown of a corporate religious life, the  embryo from which the Arabian military organisation, its polity, even its  social system, were to spring.    In spite of the increasing numbers of the Ansar, there still remained a  party in Medina, \"the Disaffected,\" who had not as yet accepted the  Prophet or his creed. Over these Mahomet exercised a strict surveillance,  in accordance with his conviction that a successful ruler leaves nothing  to Providence that he can discover and regulate for himself. \"Trust in  God, but tie your camel.\" By this means, as well as by personal influence  and exhortation, \"Disaffected\" were controlled and ultimately converted  into good Muslim; for the more cautious of them--those who waited to see  how events would shape--soon assured themselves of Mahomet's capacity,  and the weakly passive were caught in the swirl of enthusiasm surrounding  the Prophet that continually drew unto itself all conditions of men  within its ever-widening circle.    Having organised his own followers, and secured their immunity from  internal strife, Mahomet was forced to turn his attention to the Jewish  element within his adopted city, and to decide swiftly his policy towards  the three Israelite tribes who comprised the wealthier and trading  population of Medina.    From the first, Mahomet's desires were in the direction of a federal  union, wherein each party would follow his own faith and have control of  his own tribal affairs and finances, save when the necessity of mutual  protection against enemies called for a union of forces. Again Mahomet  framed his policy upon the doctrine of opportunism. His ultimate aim was  beyond doubt to unite both Jews and Medinans under his rule in a common  religious and political bond, but he recognised the present impossibility  of such action in view of the Jews' greater stability and the weakness of  his party within the city. His negotiations and conciliations with the  Jews offer one of the many examples of his supreme skill as a statesman.    The Jews themselves, taken almost unawares by the suddenness of Mahomet's  entry into their civic life, agreed to the treaty he proposed, and  acquiesced unconsciously in his subtle attempts to merge the two faiths  into a whole wherein Islam would be the dominant factor. When Mahomet  made Jerusalem his Kibla, or direction of prayer, and emphasised the  connection between Jewish and Arabian history, they suffered these  advances, and agreed to a treaty which would have formed the foundations  of a political and social convergence and ultimate absorption of their  own nation.    Mahomet knew that federalism with the Jews was a necessary step to his  desired end, and therefore he drew up a treaty wherein mutual protection  against outward enemies, as well as against internal sedition, was  assured. Hospitality was to be freely rendered and demanded, and neither  party was to support an Infidel against a Believer. Guarantees for mutual  security were exchanged, and it was agreed that each should be free to  worship in his own fashion. The treaty throws light upon the clan-system  still obtaining in seventh-century Arabia. The Jews were their own  masters in the ordering of their lives, as were the Medinan tribes, even  after many years of neighbourhood and frequent interchange of commerce  and mutual assurances. The most significant political work achieved by  Mahomet, the planting of the federal, and later, the national idea in  Arabia in place of the tribal one, was thus inaugurated, and throughout  the development of his political power it will be seen that the struggles  between himself and the surrounding peoples virtually hinged upon the  acceptance or rejection of it.    The Jews, with their narrow conception of the political unit, could  acquiesce neither in federalism nor in union, and as soon as Mahomet  perceived their incapacity he became implacable, and either drove them  forth or compelled their submission by terror and slaughter. But for the  present his policy and prudence dictated compromise, and he was strong  enough to achieve his will.    The political and social problems of his embryo state had found temporary  solution, and Mahomet was free to turn his attention to external foes. In  his attitude towards those who had persecuted him he evinced more than  ever his determination to build up not only a religious society, but a  powerful temporal state.    The Meccans would have been content to leave matters as they stood, and  were quite prepared to let Mahomet establish his power at Medina  unmolested, provided they were given like immunity from attacks. But from  the beginning other plans filled the Prophet's thoughts, and though  revenge for his privations was declared to be the instigator of his  attacks on the Kureisch trade, the determining motive must be looked for  much more deeply. The great project of the harassment and final overthrow  of the Kureisch was dimly foreshadowed in Mahomet's mind, and he became  ever more deeply aware of the part that must be played therein by the  sword.    As yet he hesitated to acclaim war as the supreme arbiter in his own and  his followers' destinies, for the valour of his levies and the skill of  his leaders was unproved. The forays undertaken before the battle of Bedr  are really nothing more than essays by the Muslim in the game of war, and  it was not until proof of their power against the Kureisch had been given  that Mahomet gave up his future policy into the keeping of that bright  disastrous deity that lures all sons of men. In a measure it was true  that the clash between Mahomet and the Kureisch was unavoidable, but that  it loomed so large upon the horizon of Medina's policy is due to the  Prophet's determination to strike immediately at the wealth and security  of his rival. Lust for plunder, too, added its weight to Mahomet's  reprisals against Mecca; even if that city was content to leave him in  peace, still the Kureischite caravans to Bostra and Syria, passing so  near to Medina, were too tempting to be ignored.    Along these age-old routes Meccan merchandise still travelled its devious  way, at the mercy of sun and desert storms and the unheeding fierceness  of that cataclysmic country, a prey to any marauding tribes, and  dependent for its existence upon the strength of its escort. And since  plunder is sweeter than labour, every chief with swift riders and good  spearmen hoped to gain his riches at Meccan expense. But their attempts  were for the most part abortive, chiefly because of the lack of cohesion  and generalship; until Mahomet none really constituted a serious menace  to the Kureischite wealth.    In Muharram 622 (April) the Hegira took place, and six months sufficed  Mahomet to establish his power securely enough to be able to send out his  first expedition against the Kureisch in Ramadan (December) of the same  year. The party was led by Hamza, whose soldier qualities were only at  the beginning of their development, and probably consisted of a few  Muslim horsemen on their beautiful swift mounts and one or two spearmen,  and possibly several warriors skilled in the use of arrows. They sallied  forth from Medina and went to meet the caravan as it prepared to pass by  their town. The Kureisch had placed Abu Jahl in command--a man whose  invincible hatred for Islam and the Prophet had manifested itself in the  persecution at Mecca, and whose hostility increased as the Muslim power  advanced.    The caravan was guarded, but none too strongly, and Hamza's troop pursued  and had almost attacked it when a Bedouin chief of the desert more  powerful than either party interposed and compelled the Muslim to  withdraw, while he forbade Abu Jahl to pursue them or attempt revenge. So  the caravan continued its way unmolested into Syria and there exchanged  its gums, leather, and frankincense for the silks and precious metals,  the fine stuffs and luxurious draperies which made the Syrian markets a  vivid medley of sheen and gloss, stored with bright colours and burnished  surfaces shimmering in the hot radiance of the East. In Jan. 623 the  caravan set out homeward \"on its lone journey o'er the desert,\" and again  the Muslim sent out an attacking party in the hope of securing this  larger prize. But the Kureisch were wise and had provided themselves  with a stronger escort before which the Muslim could do nothing but  retreat--not, however, before they had sent a few tentative arrows at the  cavalcade. Obeida, their leader and a cousin of Mahomet, gave the command  to shoot, and is renowned henceforth as \"he who shot the first arrow for  Islam.\"    After a month another essay was made upon a northward-bound caravan by  Sa'd, again without success, for he had miscalculated dates and missed  his quarry by some days. Each leader on his return to Medina was received  with honour by Mahomet as one who had shown his prowess in the cause of  Isalm and presented with a white banner.    So far the prophet himself had not taken the field; now, however, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10743"],[0,"Moonfleet (#17)"],[1," So cast myself down on the turf, but had not lain there long when  I saw someone coming to me through the brambles, and Master Ratsey said,  'Well, Jack, so thou and Elzevir are leaving Moonfleet, and I fain would  flit myself, but then who would be left to lead the old folk to their  last homes, for dead do not bury their dead in these days.'    I was half-asleep, and took little heed of what he said, putting him off  with, 'That need not keep you, Master; they will find others to fill your  place.' Yet he would not let me be, but went on talking for the pleasure  of hearing his own voice.    'Nay, child, you know not what you say. They may find men to dig a grave,  and perhaps to fill it, but who shall toss the mould when Parson Glennie  gives the \"earth to earth\"; it takes a mort of knowledge to make it  rattle kindly on the coffin-lid.'    I felt sleep heavy on my eyelids, and was for begging him to let me rest,  when there came a whistle from below, and in a moment all were on their  feet. The drivers went to the packhorses' heads, and so we walked down to  the strand, a silent moving group of men and horses mixed; and before we  came to the bottom, heard the first boat's nose grind on the beach, and  the feet of the seamen crunching in the pebbles. Then all fell to the  business of landing, and a strange enough scene it was, what with the  medley of men, the lanthorns swinging, and a frothy Upper from the sea  running up till sometimes it was over our boots; and all the time there  was a patter of French and Dutch, for most of the _Bonaventure's_ men  were foreigners. But I shall not speak more of this; for, after all, one  landing is very like another, and kegs come ashore in much the same way,  whether they are to pay excise or not.    It must have been three o'clock before the lugger's boats were off again  to sea, and by that time the horses were well laden, and most of the men  had a keg or two to carry beside. Then Elzevir, who was in command, gave  the word, and we began to file away from the beach up to the under-cliff.  Now, what with the cargo being heavy, we were longer than usual in  getting away; and though there was no sign of sunrise, yet the night was  greyer, and not so blue as it had been.    We reached the under-cliff, and were moving across it to address  ourselves to the bridle-path, and so wind sideways up the steep, when I  saw something moving behind one of the plumbs of brambles with which the  place is beset. It was only a glimpse of motion that I had perceived, and  could not say whether 'twas man or animal, or even frightened bird behind  the bushes. But others had seen it as well; there was some shouting, half  a dozen flung down their kegs and started in pursuit.    All eyes were turned to the bridle-path, and in a twinkling hunters and  hunted were in view. The greyhounds were Damen and Garrett, with some  others, and the hare was an older man, who leapt and bounded forward,  faster than I should have thought any but a youth could run; but then he  knew what men were after him, and that 'twas a race for life. For though  it was but a moment before all were lost in the night, yet this was long  enough to show me that the man was none other than Maskew, and I knew  that his life was not worth ten minutes' purchase.    Now I hated this man, and had myself suffered something at his hand,  besides seeing him put much grievous suffering on others; but I wished  then with all my heart he might escape, and had a horrible dread of what  was to come. Yet I knew all the time escape was impossible; for though  Maskew ran desperately, the way was steep and stony, and he had behind  him some of the fleetest feet along that coast. We had all stopped with  one accord, as not wishing to move a step forward till we had seen the  issue of the chase; and I was near enough to look into Elzevir's face,  but saw there neither passion nor bloodthirstiness, but only a calm  resolve, as if he had to deal with something well expected.    We had not long to wait, for very soon we heard a rolling of stones and  trampling of feet coming down the path, and from the darkness issued a  group of men, having Maskew in the middle of them. They were hustling him  along fast, two having hold of him by the arms, and a third by the neck  of his shirt behind. The sight gave me a sick qualm, like an overdose of  tobacco, for it was the first time I had ever seen a man man-handled, and  a fellow-creature abused. His cap was lost, and his thin hair tangled  over his forehead, his coat was torn off, so that he stood in his  waistcoat alone; he was pale, and gasped terribly, whether from the sharp  run, or from violence, or fear, or all combined.    There was a babel of voices when they came up of desperate men who had a  bitterest enemy in their clutch; and some shouted, 'Club him', 'Shoot  him', 'Hang him', while others were for throwing him over the cliff. Then  someone saw under the flap of his waistcoat that same silver-hafted  pistol that lay so lately next the lease of the Why Not? and snatching it  from him, flung it on the grass at Block's feet.    But Elzevir's deep voice mastered their contentions--    'Lads, ye remember how I said when this man's reckoning day should come  'twas I would reckon with him, and had your promise to it. Nor is it  right that any should lay hand on him but I, for is he not sealed to me  with my son's blood? So touch him not, but bind him hand and foot, and  leave him here with me and go your ways; there is no time to lose, for  the light grows apace.'    There was a little muttered murmuring, but Elzevir's will overbore them  here as it had done in the vault; and they yielded the more easily,  because every man knew in his heart that he would never see Maskew again  alive. So within ten minutes all were winding up the bridle-path, horses  and men, all except three; for there were left upon the brambly  greensward of the under-cliff Maskew and Elzevir and I, and the pistol  lay at Elzevir's feet.          CHAPTER 9    A JUDGEMENT    Let them fight it out, friend. Things have gone too far,  God must judge the couple: leave them as they are--_Browning_      I made as if I would follow the others, not wishing to see what I must  see if I stayed behind, and knowing that I was powerless to bend Elzevir  from his purpose. But he called me back and bade me wait with him, for  that I might be useful by and by. So I waited, but was only able to make  a dreadful guess at how I might be of use, and feared the worst.    Maskew sat on the sward with his hands lashed tight behind his back, and  his feet tied in front. They had set him with his shoulders against a  great block of weather-worn stone that was half-buried and half-stuck up  out of the turf. There he sat keeping his eyes on the ground, and was  breathing less painfully than when he was first brought, but still very  pale. Elzevir stood with the lanthorn in his hand, looking at Maskew  with a fixed gaze, and we could hear the hoofs of the heavy-laden horses  beating up the path, till they turned a corner, and all was still.    The silence was broken by Maskew: 'Unloose me, villain, and let me go. I  am a magistrate of the county, and if you do not, I will have you  gibbeted on this cliff-top.'    They were brave words enough, yet seemed to me but bad play-acting; and  brought to my remembrance how, when I was a little fellow, Mr. Glennie  once made me recite a battle-piece of Mr. Dryden before my betters; and  how I could scarce get out the bloody threats for shyness and rising  tears. So it was with Maskew's words; for he had much ado to gather  breath to say them, and they came in a thin voice that had no sting of  wrath or passion in it.    Then Elzevir spoke to him, not roughly, but resolved; and yet with  melancholy, like a judge sentencing a prisoner:    'Talk not to me of gibbets, for thou wilt neither hang nor see men hanged  again. A month ago thou satst under my roof, watching the flame burn down  till the pin dropped and gave thee right to turn me out from my old home.  And now this morning thou shalt watch that flame again, for I will give  thee one inch more of candle, and when the pin drops, will put this thine  own pistol to thy head, and kill thee with as little thought as I would  kill a stoat or other vermin.'    Then he opened the lanthorn slide, took out from his neckcloth that same  pin with the onyx head which he had used in the Why Not? and fixed it in  the tallow a short inch from the top, setting the lanthorn down upon the  sward in front of Maskew.    As for me, I was dismayed beyond telling at these words, and made  giddy with the revulsion of feeling; for, whereas, but a few minutes  ago, I would have thought nothing too bad for Maskew, now I was turned  round to wish he might come off with his life, and to look with terror  upon Elzevir.    It had grown much lighter, but not yet with the rosy flush of sunrise;  only the stars had faded out, and the deep blue of the night given way to  a misty grey. The light was strong enough to let all things be seen, but  not to call the due tints back to them. So I could see cliffs and ground,  bushes and stones and sea, and all were of one pearly grey colour, or  rather they were colourless; but the most colourless and greyest thing of  all was Maskew's face. His hair had got awry, and his head showed much  balder than when it was well trimmed; his face, too, was drawn with heavy  lines, and there were rings under his eyes. Beside all that, he had got  an ugly fall in trying to escape, and one cheek was muddied, and down it  trickled a blood-drop where a stone had cut him. He was a sorry sight  enough, and looking at him, I remembered that day in the schoolroom when  this very man had struck the parson, and how our master had sat patient  under it, with a blood-drop trickling down his cheek too. Maskew kept his  eyes fixed for a long time on the ground, but raised"]]]
