The most famous      case of this kind is that of Alexander the Great, who, according      to Plutarch, exhaled so sweet an odor that his tunics were soaked      with aromatic perfume (_Convivalium Disputationum_, lib. I,      quest. 6). Malherbe, Cujas, and Haller are said to have diffused      a musky odor. The agreeable odor of Walt Whitman has been      remarked by Kennedy and others. The perfume exhaled by many holy      men and women, so often noted by ancient writers (discussed by      Goerres in the second volume of his _Christliche Mystik_) and      which has entered into current phraseology as a merely      metaphorical \"odor of sanctity,\" was doubtless due, as Hammond      first pointed out, to abnormal nervous conditions, for it is well      known that such conditions affect the odor, and in insanity, for      instance, the presence is noted of bodily odors which have      sometimes even been considered of diagnostic importance. J.B.      Friedreich, _Allgemeine Diagnostik der Psychischen Krankheiten_,      second edition, 1832, pp. 9-10, quotes passages from various      authors on this point, which he accepts; various writers of more      recent date have made similar observations.        The odor of sanctity was specially noted at death, and was      doubtless confused with the _odor mortis_, which frequently      precedes death and by some is regarded as an almost certain      indication of its approach. In the _British Medical Journal_, for      May and June, 1898, will be found letters from several      correspondents substantiating this point. One of these      correspondents (Dr. Tuckey, of Tywardwreath, Cornwall) mentions      that he has in Cornwall often seen ravens flying over houses in      which persons lay dying, evidently attracted by a characteristic      odor.    It must be borne in mind, however, that, while every person has, to a  sensitive nose, a distinguishing odor, we must regard that odor either as  but one of the various sensations given off by the body, or else as a  combination of two or more of these emanations. The body in reality gives  off a number of different odors. The most important of these are: (1) the  general skin odor, a faint, but agreeable, fragrance often to be detected  on the skin even immediately after washing; (2) the smell of the hair and  scalp; (3) the odor of the breath; (4) the odor of the armpit; (5) the  odor of the feet; (6) the perineal odor; (7) in men the odor of the  preputial smegma; (8) in women the odor of the mons veneris, that of  vulvar smegma, that of vaginal mucus, and the menstrual odor. All these  are odors which may usually be detected, though sometimes only in a very  faint degree, in healthy and well-washed persons under normal conditions.  It is unnecessary here to take into account the special odors of various  secretions and excretions.[35]    It is a significant fact, both as regards the ancestral sexual connections  of the body odors and their actual sexual associations to-day, that, as  Hippocrates long ago noted, it is not until puberty that they assume their  adult characteristics. The infant, the adult, the aged person, each has  his own kind of smell, and, as Monin remarks, it might be possible, within  certain limits, to discover the age of a person by his odor. Jorg in 1832  pointed out that in girls the appearance of a specific smell of the  excreta indicates the establishment of puberty, and Kaan, in his  _Psychopathia Sexualis_, remarked that at puberty \"the sweat gives out a  more acrid odor resembling musk.\" In both sexes puberty, adolescence,  early manhood and womanhood are marked by a gradual development of the  adult odor of skin and excreta, in general harmony with the secondary  sexual development of hair and pigment. Venturi, indeed, has, not without  reason, described the odor of the body as a secondary sexual  character.[36] It may be added that, as is the case with the pigment in  various parts of the body in women, some of these odors tend to become  exaggerated in sympathy with sexual and other emotional states.        The odor of the infant is said to be of butyric acid; that of old      people to resemble dry leaves. Continent young men have been said      by many ancient writers to smell more strongly than the unchaste,      and some writers have described as \"seminal odor\"--an odor      resembling that of animals in heat, faintly recalling that of the      he-goat, according to Venturi--the exhalations of the skin at      such times.        During sexual excitement, as women can testify, a man very      frequently, if not normally, gives out an odor which, as usually      described, proceeds from the skin, the breath, or both. Grimaldi      states that it is as of rancid butter; others say it resembles      chloroform. It is said to be sometimes perceptible for a distance      of several feet and to last for several hours after coitus.      (Various quotations are given by Gould and Pyle, _Anomalies and      Curiosities of Medicine_, section on \"Human Odors,\" pp. 397-403.)      St. Philip Neri is said to have been able to recognize a chaste      man by smell.        During menstruation girls and young women frequently give off an      odor which is quite distinct from that of the menstrual fluid,      and is specially marked in the breath, which may smell of      chloroform or violets. Pouchet (confirmed by Raciborski, _Traite      de la Menstruation_, 1868, p. 74) stated that about a day before      the onset of menstruation a characteristic smell is exuded.      Menstruating girls are also said sometimes to give off a smell of      leather. Aubert, of Lyons (as quoted by Galopin), describes the      odor of the skin of a woman during menstruation as an agreeable      aromatic or acidulous perfume of chloroform character. By some      this is described as emanating especially from the armpits.      Sandras (quoted by Raciborski) knew a lady who could always tell      by a sensation of faintness and _malaise_--apparently due to a      sensation of smell--when she was in contact with a menstruating      woman. I am acquainted with a man, having strong olfactory      sympathies and antipathies, who detects the presence of      menstruation by smell. It is said that Hortense Bare, who      accompanied her lover, the botanist Commerson, to the Pacific      disguised as a man, was recognized by the natives as a woman by      means of smell.        Women, like men, frequently give out an odor during coitus or      strong sexual excitement. This odor may be entirely different      from that normally emanating from the woman, of an acid or      hircine character, and sufficiently strong to remain in a room      for a considerable period. Many of the ancient medical writers      (as quoted by Schurigius, _Parthenologia_, p. 286) described the      goaty smell produced by venery, especially in women; they      regarded it as specially marked in harlots and in the newly      married, and sometimes even considered it a certain sign of      defloration. The case has been recorded of a woman who emitted a      rose odor for two days after coitus (McBride, quoted by Kiernan      in an interesting summary, \"Odor in Pathology,\" _Doctor's      Magazine_, December, 1900). There was, it is said (_Journal des      Savans_ 1684, p. 39, quoting from the _Journal d'Angleterre_) a      monk in Prague who could recognize by smell the chastity of the      women who approached him. (This monk, it is added, when he died,      was composing a new science of odors.)        Gustav Klein (as quoted by Adler, _Die Mangelhafte      Geschlechtsempfindungen des Weibes_, p. 25) argues that the      special function of the glands at the vulvar orifice--the      _glandulae vestibulares majores_--is to give out an odorous      secretion to act as an attraction to the male, this relic of      sexual periodicity no longer, however, playing an important part      in the human species. The vulvar secretion, however, it may be      added, still has a more aromatic odor than the vaginal secretion,      with its simple mucous odor, very clearly perceived during      parturition.        It may be added that we still know extremely little concerning      the sexual odors of women among primitive peoples. Ploss and      Bartels are only able to bring forward (_Das Weib_, 1901, bd. 1,      p. 218) a statement concerning the women of New Caledonia, who,      according to Moncelon, when young and ardent, give out during      coitus a powerful odor which no ablution will remove. In abnormal      states of sexual excitement such odor may be persistent, and,      according to an ancient observation, a nymphomaniac, whose      periods of sexual excitement lasted all through the spring-time,      at these periods always emitted a goatlike odor. It has been said      (G. Tourdes, art. \"Aphrodisie,\" _Dictionnaire Encyclopedique des      Sciences Medicales_) that the erotic temperament is characterized      by a special odor.    If the body odors tend to develop at puberty, to be maintained during  sexual life, especially in sympathy with conditions of sexual disturbance,  and to become diminished in old age, being thus a kind of secondary sexual  character, we should expect them to be less marked in those cases in which  the primary sexual characters are less marked. It is possible that this is  actually the case. Hagen, in his _Sexuelle Osphresiologie_, quotes from  Roubaud's _Traite de l'Impuissance_ the statement that the body odor of  the castrated differs from that of normal individuals. Burdach had  previously stated that the odor of the eunuch is less marked than that of  the normal man.    It is thus possible that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13614"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 5 (#17)"],[1,"in this manner by the woman he was      attached to.        In a previous volume of these _Studies_ (\"Sexual Inversion,\"      History XXVI) I have recorded the masochistic day-dreams of a boy      whose impulses were at the same time inverted; in his reveries      \"the central fact,\" he states, \"became the discharge of urine      from my lover over my body and limbs, or, if I were very fond of      him, I let it be in my face.\" In actual life the act of urination      casually witnessed in childhood became the symbol, even the      reality, of the central secret of sex: \"I stood rooted and      flushing with downcast eyes till the act was over, and was      conscious for a considerable time of stammering speech and      bewildered faculties.... I was overwhelmed with emotion and could      barely drag my feet from the spot or my eyes from the damp      herbage where he had deposited the waters of secrecy. Even to-day      I cannot dissociate myself from the shuddering charm that moment      had for me.\"    It is not only the urine and the faeces which may thus acquire a symbolic  fascination and attractiveness under the influence of masochistic  deviations of sexual idealization. In some cases extreme rapture has been  experienced in licking sweating feet. There is, indeed, no excretion or  product of the body which has not been a source of ecstasy: the sweat from  every part of the body, the saliva and menstrual fluid, even the wax from  the ears.        Krafft-Ebing very truly points out (_Psychopathia Sexualis_,      English translation, p. 178) that this sexual scatalogic      symbolism is precisely paralleled by a religious scatalogic      symbolism. In the excesses of devout enthusiasm the ascetic      performs exactly the same acts as are performed in these excesses      of erotic enthusiasm. To mix excreta with the food, to lick up      excrement, to suck festering sores--all these and the like are      acts which holy and venerated women have performed.        Not only the saint, but also the prophet and medicine-man have      been frequently eaters of human excrement; it is only necessary      to refer to the instance of the prophet Ezekiel, who declared      that he was commanded to bake his bread with human dung, and to      the practices of medicine-men at Torres Straits, in whose      training the eating of human excrement takes a recognized part.      (Deities, notably Baal-Phegor, were sometimes supposed to eat      excrement, so that it was natural that their messengers and      representatives among men should do so. As regards Baal-Phegor,      see Dulaure, _Des Divinites Generatrices_, Chapter IV, and J.G.      Bourke, _Scatalogic Rites of All Nations_, p. 241. See also      Ezekiel, Chapter IV, v. 12, and _Reports Anthropological      Expedition to Torres Straits_, vol. v, p. 321.)        It must be added, however, that while the masochist is overcome      by sexual rapture, so that he sees nothing disgusting in his act,      the medicine-man and the ascetic are not so invariably overcome      by religious rapture, and several ascetic writers have referred      to the horror and disgust they experienced, at all events at      first, in accomplishing such acts, while the medicine-men when      novices sometimes find the ordeal too severe and have to abandon      their career. Brenier de Montmorand, while remarking, not without      some exaggeration, that \"the Christian ascetics are almost all      eaters of excrement\" (\"Ascetisme et Mysticisme,\" _Revue      Philosophique_, March, 1904, p. 245), quotes the testimonies of      Marguerite-Marie and Madame Guyon as to the extreme repugnance      which they had to overcome. They were impelled by a merely      intellectual symbolism of self-mortification rather than by the      profoundly felt emotional symbolism which moves the masochist.        Coprophagic acts, whether under the influences of religious      exaltation or of sexual rapture, inevitably excite our disgust.      We regard them as almost insane, fortified in that belief by the      undoubted fact that coprophagia is not uncommon among the insane.      It may, therefore, be proper to point out that it is not so very      long since the ingestion of human excrement was carried out by      our own forefathers in the most sane and deliberate manner. It      was administered by medical practitioners for a great number of      ailments, apparently with entirely satisfactory results. Less      than two centuries ago, Schurig, who so admirably gathered      together and arranged the medical lore of his own and the      immediately preceding ages, wrote a very long and detailed      chapter, \"De Stercoris Humani Usu Medico\" (_Chylologia_, 1725,      cap. XIII; in the Paris _Journal de Medecine_ for February 19,      1905, there appeared an article, which I have not seen, entitled      \"Medicaments oubliees: l'urine et la fiente humaine.\") The      classes of cases in which the drug was found beneficial would      seem to have been extremely various. It must not be supposed that      it was usually ingested in the crude form. A common method was to      take the faeces of boys, dry them, mix them with the best honey,      and administer an electuary. (At an earlier period such drugs      appear to have met with some opposition from the Church, which      seems to have seen in them only an application of magic; thus I      note that in Burchard's remarkable Penitential of the fourteenth      century, as reproduced by Wasserschleben, 40 days' penance is      prescribed for the use of human urine or excrement as a medicine.      Wasserschleben _Die Bussordnungen der Abendlaendlichen Kirche_, p.      651.)    The urolagnia of masochism is not a simple phenomenon; it embodies a  double symbolism: on the one hand a symbolism of self-abnegation, such as  the ascetic feels, on the other hand a symbolism of transferred sexual  emotion. Krafft-Ebing was disposed to regard all cases in which a  scatalogical sexual attraction existed as due to \"latent masochism.\" Such  a point of view is quite untenable. Certainly the connection is common,  but in the majority of cases of slightly marked scatalogical fetichism no  masochism is evident. And when we bear in mind the various considerations,  already brought forward, which show how widespread and clearly realized is  the natural and normal basis furnished for such symbolism, it becomes  quite unnecessary to invoke any aid from masochism. There is ample  evidence to show that, either as a habitual or more usually an occasional  act, the impulse to bestow a symbolic value on the act of urination in a  beloved person, is not extremely uncommon; it has been noted of men of  high intellectual distinction; it occurs in women as well as men; when  existing in only a slight degree, it must be regarded as within the normal  limits of variation of sexual emotion.        The occasional cases in which the urine is drunk may possibly      suggest that the motive lies in the properties of the fluid      acting on the system. Support for this supposition might be found      in the fact that urine actually does possess, apart altogether      from its magic virtues embodied in folk-lore, the properties of a      general stimulant. In composition (as Masterman first pointed      out) \"beef-tea differs little from healthy urine,\" containing      exactly the same constituents, except that in beef-tea there is      less urea and uric acid. Fresh urine--more especially that of      children and young women--is taken as a medicine in nearly all      parts of the world for various disorders, such as epistaxis,      malaria and hysteria, with benefit, this benefit being almost      certainly due to its qualities as a general stimulant and      restorative. William Salmon's _Dispensatory_, 1678 (quoted in      _British Medical Journal_, April 21, 1900, p. 974), shows that in      the seventeenth century urine still occupied an important place      as a medicine, and it frequently entered largely into the      composition of Aqua Divina.        Its use has been known even in England in the nineteenth century.      (Masterman, _Lancet_, October 2, 1880; R. Neale, \"Urine as a      Medicine,\" _Practitioner_, November, 1881; Bourke brings together      a great deal of evidence as to the therapeutic uses of urine in      his _Scatalogic Rites_, especially pp. 331-335; Lusini has shown      that normal urine invariably increases the frequency of the heart      beats, _Archivio di Farmacologia_, fascs. 19-21, 1893.)        But it is an error to suppose that these facts account for the      urolagnic drinking of urine. As in the gratification of a normal      sexual impulse, the intense excitement of gratifying a scatalogic      sexual impulse itself produces a degree of emotional stimulation      far greater than the ingestion of a small amount of animal      extractives would be adequate to effect. In such cases, as much      as in normal sexuality, the stimulation is clearly psychic.    When, as is most commonly the case, it is the process of urination and not  the urine itself which is attractive, we are clearly concerned with a  symbolism of act and not with the fetichistic attraction of an excretion.  When the excretion, apart from the act, provides the attraction, we seem  usually to be in the presence of an olfactory fetichism. These fetichisms  connected with the excreta appear to be experienced chiefly by individuals  who are somewhat weak-minded, which is not necessarily the case in regard  to those persons for whom the act, rather than its product apart from the  beloved person, is the attractive symbol.        The sexually symbolic nature of the act of urination for many      people is indicated by the existence, according to Bloch, who      enumerates various kinds of indecent photographs, of a group      which he terms \"the notorious _pisseuses_.\" It is further    "]]]
