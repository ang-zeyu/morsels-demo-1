[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8911"],[0,"Explorations in Australia (#16)"],[1,"o-day; it resembles the country about Chambers Creek.    Tuesday, 7th June, The Neale. At 8 o'clock started on a bearing of 180  degrees for the northernmost of the isolated hills, to see if there are  springs round it. At four miles ascended it, but could see no springs.  This I have named Mount Harvey, after J. Harvey, Esquire, M.L.A. from  Mount Kingston it bears 47 degrees 45 minutes. Thence I started for the  other mount, which I have named Mount Dutton, after the Honourable F.T.  Dutton; four miles and a half to the top. The Hanson range is closing  upon my course, and I think to-morrow's journey will cut it. On the north  side are a few springs, some of them a little brackish, and some very  good. We cleared out one, and found it very good. Here I camped for the  night. From south-west to north-west it seems to be an immense plain,  stony on the surface, with salt bush and grass. Mount Dutton is well  grassed to the top; it is composed of the same rock as the others.    Wednesday, 8th June, Mount Dutton. at 9.15 started on a course of 310  degrees. At three-quarters of a mile passed another batch of springs,  some of them brackish, and some very good indeed. Leaving them we passed  over a good feeding country, crossing several gum and myall creeks, one  with polyganum, all coming from Hanson range and flowing into the Neale.  At nine miles crossed the top of Hanson range. From it I could see, about  fifteen miles to the west of north, a high point of this range, which I  have named Mount O'Halloran (after the Honourable Major O'Halloran), on  the west side of which there appears to be a large creek coming from the  north-west. We then proceeded on a course of 324 degrees towards Mount  O'Halloran. At four miles and a half struck a large gum creek coming from  the range and running for about four miles north-west on our course;  examined it for water, but found none. It divides itself into numerous  channels, and when full must retain a large quantity of water for a long  time. The gum-trees are large and numerous, and numbers of pigeons  frequent its banks. At a mile further came upon some rain water in a  stony flat, where we camped for the night between low sand rises covered  with grass.    Thursday, 9th June, Stony Flat. This country must be examined today for  springs. I have therefore sent Muller down the creek to search that,  whilst I must remain and get an observation of the sun. My party is far  too small to examine the country well. I cannot go myself and leave the  camp with the provisions to one man; the natives might attack him, and  destroy the lot, there seem to be a great many tracks about. Three  o'clock. Muller has returned; he has run the creek down until it joined  another very large gum creek coming from the north-west--the one that I  saw from the top of the range. The gum-trees were large; from one of them  the natives had cut a large sheet of bark, evidently for a canoe. He also  saw two large water holes, one hundred yards wide and a quarter of a mile  long, with very high and steep banks. It seems to be the same creek as  the Neale. Can it be Cooper's Creek? the country very much resembles it.  My course will strike it more to the north-west to-morrow.    Friday, 10th June, Same Place. I have been very unwell during the night  with cramp in the stomach, but hope I shall get better as I go on.  Started at 8 o'clock on a bearing of 32 degrees 4 minutes. At four miles  went to the top of Mount O'Halloran. The creek is about three miles to  the west; it breaks through the Hanson range. Changed my course to 317  degrees to get away from the stones, which are very rough close to the  hill. At six miles changed my course to 270 degrees to examine an  isolated hill for springs, but found none. The creek winds round this  hill, and spreads out into numerous channels, covering a space of two  miles; but there is no water here, nor for three miles further up the  creek. We have, however, found some rain water; and, as I feel so unwell  that I am unable to ride, I have camped here for the night, and sent  Muller to examine the creek for water. He has been unsuccessful.    Saturday, 11th June, Rain Water. I feel a little better this morning.  Started at 9.20 on a bearing of 317 degrees. Crossed the creek, which is  about a mile wide. For five miles it ran parallel to my course, and then  turned more to the west. There is a beautiful plain along the bank, about  three miles wide, and completely covered with grass. At nine miles and a  half, on a small rise, changed my course to 318 degrees 30 minutes, to a  distant hill. Travelled for nine miles and a half over another large and  well-grassed plain of the same description; thence over some low stony  hills to a myall flat, the soil beautiful, of a red colour, covered with  grass; after four miles it became sandy. Camped for the night, after  having gone thirty-one miles. The country of to-day surpasses all that I  have yet travelled over for the abundance of feed. We have passed a  number of native tracks, but only one or two are fresh. We have found no  water to-day, except some little rain water, which is nearly all mud. I  have no doubt but there is plenty towards the east.    Sunday, 12th June, Myall Flat. I feel still very unwell. We are now come  to our last set of shoes for the horses, and, having experienced the  misery of being without them in my previous journey, I am, though with  great reluctance, forced to turn back. My party is also too small to make  a proper examination of such splendid country. Started back, keeping more  to the east to examine a high hill in search of water. If I can find  water, I shall endeavour to reach the north boundary. At 11.40 arrived at  the hill. Latitude, 27 degrees 12 minutes 30 seconds. Can see no  appearance of water, although the country seems good all round. Ten  degrees to the east of north is a large dark-coloured hill, which I saw  from last night's camp, from fifteen to twenty miles distant. I should  like to go to it, but can find no water. I have named it Mount Browne,  after Mr. J.H. Browne, of Port Gawler, my companion in Captain Sturt's  expedition. I dare not risk the horses another night without water, the  grass is so very dry; had there been green grass, I would not have  hesitated a moment. Turned towards the Neale by a different course to try  and find water; was unsuccessful until within an hour of sundown, when we  struck some muddy water. As I expected, the horses were very thirsty and  devoured the lot. Reached the creek after dark.    Monday, 13th June, The Neale. Found some rain water on the bank of the  creek, and, two of the horses requiring shoes, I stopped for the day. At  noon sent Muller up the creek to see if he could find any water holes,  but he saw none. At six miles another creek coming from the south-west  joins this. I am afraid I shall not have enough shoes to carry me into  the settled districts. The creek does not seem to have been running for a  number of years. The water has, some time or other, been ten feet high.  The breadth of the plain where the channels flow is a mile and a half,  and the quantity of water must be immense. It drains a very large extent  of country. After examining the country during the next two or three  days, I shall endeavour to follow this creek down, and learn where it  empties itself.    Tuesday, 14th June, The Neale. Started at 9 o'clock. Running the creek  down. At eight miles crossed another branch of the creek coming from the  south of west. We found no water. At twelve miles changed my bearing to  south. At three miles and a half camped at the two water holes that  Muller found when I sent him to examine the creek on the 9th instant. I  can not with certainty say they are permanent, there are neither reeds  nor rushes round them; they are very large and very deep, and, when  filled with rain, must hold a large quantity of water for a long time.  There are ducks upon them. The water does not taste like rain water,  which leads me to think that it may be permanent and supplied by springs  from below.    Wednesday, 15th June, Water Holes found by Muller on the 9th. Started at  9.15 a.m. Following the creek down. As we approached Hanson range, where  it broke through, we came upon two nice water holes with ducks upon them.  They are long, wide, and deep, with clay banks, and about three feet of  water in the middle. There are no reeds nor rushes round them, and it is  doubtful whether they are permanent. At seven miles and a half the creek  winds a little more to the west. Shortly afterwards we struck (in the  gap) two very long and large water holes a quarter of a mile long, and  between forty and fifty yards wide, and very deep. These I may safely say  are permanent. After getting through the range, the creek spreads out  over a large plain in numerous courses, bearing towards the south-east.  At four miles and a half changed my course. At six miles, going more to  the east, changed again, and at eight miles camped for the night, without  water. We have found no water since leaving the last water hole, although  I do not doubt of there being some. It would have taken us too long a  time to examine it more than I have done, my party being so small. We  have passed several winter worleys of the natives, built with mud in the  shape of a large beehive, with a small hole as the entrance. Numerous  tracks all about the creek, but we see no natives. We are now approaching  the spring country again.    Thursday, 16th June, The Neale. Started at 11.15. Still following the  creek, which continues to spread widely over the plain. At five miles I  observed some white patches of ground on the south-west side of Mount  Dutton, resembling a batch of springs. I changed my course and steered  for them, crossing the Neale at two miles and three-quarters. On the  south-west side of the Neale the country is rather stony, and for about a  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8914"],[0,"England, My England (#16)"],[1," as handsome looks,' said Albert.    Which produced no response.    'Now, Joe, come on here,' said the corporal. 'Don't keep the ladies  waiting--it's the sign of a weak heart.'    Joe turned, and the work began. Nothing more was said for the time being.  As the week went on all parties became more comfortable. Joe remained  silent, averted, neutral, a little on his dignity. Miss Stokes was  off-hand and masterful. Albert was full of mischief.    The great theme was a circus, which was coming to the market town on the  following Saturday.    'You'll go to the circus, Miss Stokes?' said Albert.    'I may go. Are you going?'    'Certainly. Give us the pleasure of escorting you.'    'No, thanks.'    'That's what I call a flat refusal--what, Joe? You don't mean that you  have no liking for our company, Miss Stokes?'    'Oh, I don't know,' said Miss Stokes. 'How many are there of you?'    'Only me and Joe.'    'Oh, is that all?' she said, satirically.    Albert was a little nonplussed.    'Isn't that enough for you?' he asked.    'Too many by half,' blurted out Joe, jeeringly, in a sudden fit of  uncouth rudeness that made both the others stare.    'Oh, I'll stand out of the way, boy, if that's it,' said Albert to Joe.  Then he turned mischievously to Miss Stokes. 'He wants to know what M.  stands for,' he said, confidentially.    'Monkeys,' she replied, turning to her horses.    'What's M.S.?' said Albert.    'Monkey nuts,' she retorted, leading off her team.    Albert looked after her a little discomfited. Joe had flushed dark, and  cursed Albert in his heart.    On the Saturday afternoon the two soldiers took the train into town. They  would have to walk home. They had tea at six o'clock, and lounged about  till half past seven. The circus was in a meadow near the river--a great  red-and-white striped tent. Caravans stood at the side. A great crowd of  people was gathered round the ticket-caravan.    Inside the tent the lamps were lighted, shining on a ring of faces, a  great circular bank of faces round the green grassy centre. Along with  some comrades, the two soldiers packed themselves on a thin plank seat,  rather high. They were delighted with the flaring lights, the wild  effect. But the circus performance did not affect them deeply. They  admired the lady in black velvet with rose-purple legs who leapt so  neatly on to the galloping horse; they watched the feats of strength and  laughed at the clown. But they felt a little patronizing, they missed the  sensational drama of the cinema.    Half-way through the performance Joe was electrified to see the face of  Miss Stokes not very far from him. There she was, in her khaki and her  felt hat, as usual; he pretended not to see her. She was laughing at the  clown; she also pretended not to see him. It was a blow to him, and it  made him angry. He would not even mention it to Albert. Least said,  soonest mended. He liked to believe she had not seen him. But he knew,  fatally, that she had.    When they came out it was nearly eleven o'clock; a lovely night, with a  moon and tall, dark, noble trees: a magnificent May night. Joe and Albert  laughed and chaffed with the boys. Joe looked round frequently to see if  he were safe from Miss Stokes. It seemed so.    But there were six miles to walk home. At last the two soldiers set off,  swinging their canes. The road was white between tall hedges, other  stragglers were passing out of the town towards the villages; the air was  full of pleased excitement.    They were drawing near to the village when they saw a dark figure ahead.  Joe's heart sank with pure fear. It was a figure wheeling a bicycle; a  land girl; Miss Stokes. Albert was ready with his nonsense. Miss Stokes  had a puncture.    'Let me wheel the rattler,' said Albert.    'Thank you,' said Miss Stokes. 'You _are_ kind.'    'Oh, I'd be kinder than that, if you'd show me how,' said Albert.    'Are you sure?' said Miss Stokes.    'Doubt my words?' said Albert. 'That's cruel of you, Miss Stokes.'    Miss Stokes walked between them, close to Joe.    'Have you been to the circus?' she asked him.    'Yes,' he replied, mildly.    'Have _you_ been?' Albert asked her.    'Yes. I didn't see you,' she replied.    'What!--you say so! Didn't see us! Didn't think us worth looking at,'  began Albert. 'Aren't I as handsome as the clown, now? And you didn't as  much as glance in our direction? I call it a downright oversight.'    'I never _saw_ you,' reiterated Miss Stokes. 'I didn't know you saw me.'    'That makes it worse,' said Albert.    The road passed through a belt of dark pine-wood. The village, and the  branch road, was very near. Miss Stokes put out her fingers and felt for  Joe's hand as it swung at his side. To say he was staggered is to put it  mildly. Yet he allowed her softly to clasp his fingers for a few moments.  But he was a mortified youth.    At the cross-road they stopped--Miss Stokes should turn off. She had  another mile to go.    'You'll let us see you home,' said Albert.    'Do me a kindness,' she said. 'Put my bike in your shed, and take it to  Baker's on Monday, will you?'    'I'll sit up all night and mend it for you, if you like.'    'No thanks. And Joe and I'll walk on.'    'Oh--ho! Oh--ho!' sang Albert. 'Joe! Joe! What do you say to that, now,  boy? Aren't you in luck's way. And I get the bloomin' old bike for my  pal. Consider it again, Miss Stokes.'    Joe turned aside his face, and did not speak.    'Oh, well! I wheel the grid, do I? I leave you, boy--'    'I'm not keen on going any further,' barked out Joe, in an uncouth voice.  'She hain't my choice.'    The girl stood silent, and watched the two men.    'There now!' said Albert. 'Think o' that! If it was _me_ now--' But he  was uncomfortable. 'Well, Miss Stokes, have me,' he added.    Miss Stokes stood quite still, neither moved nor spoke. And so the three  remained for some time at the lane end. At last Joe began kicking the  ground--then he suddenly lifted his face. At that moment Miss Stokes was  at his side. She put her arm delicately round his waist.    'Seems I'm the one extra, don't you think?' Albert inquired of the high  bland moon.    Joe had dropped his head and did not answer. Miss Stokes stood with her  arm lightly round his waist. Albert bowed, saluted, and bade good-night.  He walked away, leaving the two standing.    Miss Stokes put a light pressure on Joe's waist, and drew him down the  road. They walked in silence. The night was full of scent--wild cherry,  the first bluebells. Still they walked in silence. A nightingale was  singing. They approached nearer and nearer, till they stood close by his  dark bush. The powerful notes sounded from the cover, almost like flashes  of light--then the interval of silence--then the moaning notes, almost  like a dog faintly howling, followed by the long, rich trill, and  flashing notes. Then a short silence again.    Miss Stokes turned at last to Joe. She looked up at him, and in the  moonlight he saw her faintly smiling. He felt maddened, but helpless. Her  arm was round his waist, she drew him closely to her with a soft pressure  that made all his bones rotten.    Meanwhile Albert was waiting at home. He put on his overcoat, for the  fire was out, and he had had malarial fever. He looked fitfully at the  _Daily Mirror_ and the _Daily Sketch_, but he saw nothing. It seemed a  long time. He began to yawn widely, even to nod. At last Joe came in.    Albert looked at him keenly. The young man's brow was black, his face  sullen.    'All right, boy?' asked Albert.    Joe merely grunted for a reply. There was nothing more to be got out of  him. So they went to bed.    Next day Joe was silent, sullen. Albert could make nothing of him. He  proposed a walk after tea.    'I'm going somewhere,' said Joe.    'Where--Monkey nuts?' asked the corporal. But Joe's brow only became  darker.    So the days went by. Almost every evening Joe went off alone, returning  late. He was sullen, taciturn and had a hang-dog look, a curious way of  dropping his head and looking dangerously from under his brows. And he  and Albert did not get on so well any more with one another. For all his  fun and nonsense, Albert was really irritable, soon made angry. And Joe's  stand-offish sulkiness and complete lack of confidence riled him, got on  his nerves. His fun and nonsense took a biting, sarcastic turn, at which  Joe's eyes glittered occasionally, though the young man turned unheeding  aside. Then again Joe would be full of odd, whimsical fun, outshining  Albert himself.    Miss Stokes still came to the station with the wain: Monkey-nuts,  Albert called her, though not to her face. For she was very clear and  good-looking, almost she seemed to gleam. And Albert was a tiny bit  afraid of her. She very rarely addressed Joe whilst the hay-loading was  going on, and that young man always turned his back to her. He seemed  thinner, and his limber figure looked more slouching. But still it had  the tender, attractive appearance, especially from behind. His tanned  face, a little thinned and darkened, took a handsome, slightly sinister  look.    'Come on, Joe!' the corporal urged sharply one day. 'What're you doing,  boy? Looking for beetles on the bank?'    Joe turned round swiftly, almost menacing, to work.    'He's a different fellow these days, Miss Stokes,' said Albert to the  young woman. 'What's got him? Is it Monkey nuts that don't suit him, do  you think?'    'Choked with chaff, more like,' she retorted. 'It's as bad as feeding a  threshing machine, to have to listen to some folks.'    'As bad as what?' said Albert. 'You don't mean me, do you, Miss Stokes?'    'No,' she cried. 'I don't mean you.'    Joe's face became dark red during these sallies, but he said nothing. He  would eye the young woman curiously, as she swung so easily at the work,  and he had some of the look of a dog which is going to bite.    Albert, with his nerves on edge, began to find"]]]
