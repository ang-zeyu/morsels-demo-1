Then he took off his hat, and we took  off ours, and he went away, and we went home. I never felt so cheap in  all my life! Dora said, 'I told you so,' but we didn't mind even that so  much, though it was indeed hard to bear. It was what Lord Tottenham had  said about ungentlemanly. We didn't go on to the Heath for a week after  that; but at last we all went, and we waited for him by the bench. When  he came along Alice said, 'Please, Lord Tottenham, we have not been on  the Heath for a week, to be a punishment because you let us off. And we  have brought you a present each if you will take them to show you are  willing to make it up.'    He sat down on the bench, and we gave him our presents. Oswald gave him  a sixpenny compass--he bought it with my own money on purpose to give  him. Oswald always buys useful presents. The needle would not move after  I'd had it a day or two, but Lord Tottenham used to be an admiral, so  he will be able to make that go all right. Alice had made him a  shaving-case, with a rose worked on it. And H. O. gave him his  knife--the same one he once cut all the buttons off his best suit with.  Dicky gave him his prize, Naval Heroes, because it was the best thing he  had, and Noel gave him a piece of poetry he had made himself--        When sin and shame bow down the brow      Then people feel just like we do now.      We are so sorry with grief and pain      We never will be so ungentlemanly again.    Lord Tottenham seemed very pleased. He thanked us, and talked to us for  a bit, and when he said good-bye he said--    'All's fair weather now, mates,' and shook hands.    And whenever we meet him he nods to us, and if the girls are with us  he takes off his hat, so he can't really be going on thinking us  ungentlemanly now.        CHAPTER 11. CASTILIAN AMOROSO    One day when we suddenly found that we had half a crown we decided that  we really ought to try Dicky's way of restoring our fallen fortunes  while yet the deed was in our power. Because it might easily have  happened to us never to have half a crown again. So we decided to dally  no longer with being journalists and bandits and things like them, but  to send for sample and instructions how to earn two pounds a week each  in our spare time. We had seen the advertisement in the paper, and we  had always wanted to do it, but we had never had the money to spare  before, somehow. The advertisement says: 'Any lady or gentleman  can easily earn two pounds a week in their spare time. Sample and  instructions, two shillings. Packed free from observation.' A good deal  of the half-crown was Dora's. It came from her godmother; but she said  she would not mind letting Dicky have it if he would pay her back before  Christmas, and if we were sure it was right to try to make our fortune  that way. Of course that was quite easy, because out of two pounds a  week in your spare time you can easily pay all your debts, and have  almost as much left as you began with; and as to the right we told her  to dry up.    Dicky had always thought that this was really the best way to restore  our fallen fortunes, and we were glad that now he had a chance of trying  because of course we wanted the two pounds a week each, and besides, we  were rather tired of Dicky's always saying, when our ways didn't turn  out well, 'Why don't you try the sample and instructions about our spare  time?'    When we found out about our half-crown we got the paper. Noel was  playing admirals in it, but he had made the cocked hat without tearing  the paper, and we found the advertisement, and it said just the same as  ever. So we got a two-shilling postal order and a stamp, and what was  left of the money it was agreed we would spend in ginger-beer to drink  success to trade.    We got some nice paper out of Father's study, and Dicky wrote the  letter, and we put in the money and put on the stamp, and made H. O.  post it. Then we drank the ginger-beer, and then we waited for the  sample and instructions. It seemed a long time coming, and the postman  got quite tired of us running out and stopping him in the street to ask  if it had come.    But on the third morning it came. It was quite a large parcel, and  it was packed, as the advertisement said it would be, 'free from  observation.' That means it was in a box; and inside the box was some  stiff browny cardboard, crinkled like the galvanized iron on the tops of  chicken-houses, and inside that was a lot of paper, some of it printed  and some scrappy, and in the very middle of it all a bottle, not  very large, and black, and sealed on the top of the cork with yellow  sealing-wax.    We looked at it as it lay on the nursery table, and while all the others  grabbed at the papers to see what the printing said, Oswald went to look  for the corkscrew, so as to see what was inside the bottle. He found  the corkscrew in the dresser drawer--it always gets there, though it is  supposed to be in the sideboard drawer in the dining-room--and when he  got back the others had read most of the printed papers.    'I don't think it's much good, and I don't think it's quite nice to sell  wine,' Dora said 'and besides, it's not easy to suddenly begin to sell  things when you aren't used to it.'    'I don't know,' said Alice; 'I believe I could.' They all looked rather  down in the mouth, though, and Oswald asked how you were to make your  two pounds a week.    'Why, you've got to get people to taste that stuff in the bottle. It's  sherry--Castilian Amoroso its name is--and then you get them to buy it,  and then you write to the people and tell them the other people want the  wine, and then for every dozen you sell you get two shillings from the  wine people, so if you sell twenty dozen a week you get your two pounds.  I don't think we shall sell as much as that,' said Dicky.    'We might not the first week,' Alice said, 'but when people found out  how nice it was, they would want more and more. And if we only got ten  shillings a week it would be something to begin with, wouldn't it?'    Oswald said he should jolly well think it would, and then Dicky took the  cork out with the corkscrew. The cork broke a good deal, and some of  the bits went into the bottle. Dora got the medicine glass that has  the teaspoons and tablespoons marked on it, and we agreed to have a  teaspoonful each, to see what it was like.    'No one must have more than that,' Dora said, 'however nice it is.'    Dora behaved rather as if it were her bottle. I suppose it was, because  she had lent the money for it.    Then she measured out the teaspoonful, and she had first go, because of  being the eldest. We asked at once what it was like, but Dora could not  speak just then.    Then she said, 'It's like the tonic Noel had in the spring; but perhaps  sherry ought to be like that.'    Then it was Oswald's turn. He thought it was very burny; but he said  nothing. He wanted to see first what the others would say.    Dicky said his was simply beastly, and Alice said Noel could taste next  if he liked.    Noel said it was the golden wine of the gods, but he had to put his  handkerchief up to his mouth all the same, and I saw the face he made.    Then H. O. had his, and he spat it out in the fire, which was very rude  and nasty, and we told him so.    Then it was Alice's turn. She said, 'Only half a teaspoonful for me,  Dora. We mustn't use it all up.' And she tasted it and said nothing.    Then Dicky said: 'Look here, I chuck this. I'm not going to hawk round  such beastly stuff. Any one who likes can have the bottle. Quis?'    And Alice got out 'Ego' before the rest of us. Then she said, 'I know  what's the matter with it. It wants sugar.'    And at once we all saw that that was all there was the matter with the  stuff. So we got two lumps of sugar and crushed it on the floor with one  of the big wooden bricks till it was powdery, and mixed it with some of  the wine up to the tablespoon mark, and it was quite different, and not  nearly so nasty.    'You see it's all right when you get used to it,' Dicky said. I think he  was sorry he had said 'Quis?' in such a hurry.    'Of course,' Alice said, 'it's rather dusty. We must crush the sugar  carefully in clean paper before we put it in the bottle.'    Dora said she was afraid it would be cheating to make one bottle nicer  than what people would get when they ordered a dozen bottles, but Alice  said Dora always made a fuss about everything, and really it would be  quite honest.    'You see,' she said, 'I shall just tell them, quite truthfully, what  we have done to it, and when their dozens come they can do it for  themselves.'    So then we crushed eight more lumps, very cleanly and carefully between  newspapers, and shook it up well in the bottle, and corked it up with a  screw of paper, brown and not news, for fear of the poisonous printing  ink getting wet and dripping down into the wine and killing people. We  made Pincher have a taste, and he sneezed for ever so long, and after  that he used to go under the sofa whenever we showed him the bottle.    Then we asked Alice who she would try and sell it to. She said: 'I shall  ask everybody who comes to the house. And while we are doing that, we  can be thinking of outside people to take it to. We must be careful:  there's not much more than half of it left, even counting the sugar.'    We did not wish to tell Eliza--I don't know why. And she opened the door  very quickly that day, so that the Taxes and a man who came to our house  by mistake for next door got away before Alice had a chance to try them  with the Castilian Amoroso. But about five Eliza slipped out for half an  hour to see a friend who was making her a hat for Sunday, and while  she was gone there was a knock. Alice went, and we looked over the  banisters. When she opened the door, she said at once, 'Will you walk  in, please?' The person at the door said, '"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/775"],[0,"When the Sleeper Wakes (#16)"],[1,"seemed broader and nearer;  its apex was half-way down the ways towards the central aisle. And  raising his eyes Graham saw that a number of these men had also appeared  now in the darkened lower galleries of the opposite building, and were  firing over the heads of their fellows below at the boiling confusion of  people on the lower ways. The meaning of these things dawned upon him.  The march of the people had come upon an ambush at the very outset.  Thrown into confusion by the extinction of the lights they were now  being attacked by the red police. Then he became aware that he was  standing alone, that his guards and Lincoln were along the gallery in  the direction along which he had come before the darkness fell. He saw  they were gesticulating to him wildly, running back towards him. A great  shouting came from across the ways. Then it seemed as though the whole  face of the darkened building opposite was lined and speckled with  red-clad men. And they were pointing over to him and shouting. \"The  Sleeper! Save the Sleeper!\" shouted a multitude of throats.    Something struck the wall above his head. He looked up at the impact and  saw a star-shaped splash of silvery metal. He saw Lincoln near him. Felt  his arm gripped. Then, pat, pat; he had been missed twice.    For a moment he did not understand this. The street was hidden,  everything was hidden, as he looked. The second flare had burned out.    Lincoln had gripped Graham by the arm, was lugging him along the  gallery. \"Before the next light!\" he cried. His haste was contagious.  Graham's instinct of self-preservation overcame the paralysis of his  incredulous astonishment. He became for a time the blind creature of  the fear of death. He ran, stumbling because of the uncertainty of the  darkness, blundered into his guards as they turned to run with him.  Haste was his one desire, to escape this perilous gallery upon which he  was exposed. A third glare came close on its predecessors. With it came  a great shouting across the ways, an answering tumult from the ways.  The red-coats below, he saw, had now almost gained the central passage.  Their countless faces turned towards him, and they shouted. The white  facade opposite was densely stippled with red. All these wonderful  things concerned him, turned upon him as a pivot. These were the guards  of the Council attempting to recapture him.    Lucky it was for him that these shots were the first fired in anger for  a hundred and fifty years. He heard bullets whacking over his head, felt  a splash of molten metal sting his ear, and perceived without looking  that the whole opposite facade, an unmasked ambuscade of red police, was  crowded and bawling and firing at him.    Down went one of his guards before him, and Graham, unable to stop,  leapt the writhing body.    In another second he had plunged, unhurt, into a black passage, and  incontinently someone, coming, it may be, in a transverse direction,  blundered violently into him. He was hurling down a staircase in  absolute darkness. He reeled, and was struck again, and came against a  wall with his hands. He was crushed by a weight of struggling bodies,  whirled round, and thrust to the right. A vast pressure pinned him.  He could not breathe, his ribs seemed cracking. He felt a momentary  relaxation, and then the whole mass of people moving together, bore him  back towards the great theatre from which he had so recently come.    There were moments when his feet did not touch the ground. Then he was  staggering and shoving. He heard shouts of \"They are coming!\" and a  muffled cry close to him. His foot blundered against something soft, he  heard a hoarse scream under foot. He heard shouts of \"The Sleeper!\" but  he was too confused to speak. He heard the green weapons crackling. For  a space he lost his individual will, became an atom in a panic, blind,  unthinking, mechanical. He thrust and pressed back and writhed in the  pressure, kicked presently against a step, and found himself ascending  a slope. And abruptly the faces all about him leapt out of the black,  visible, ghastly-white and astonished, terrified, perspiring, in a livid  glare. One face, a young man's, was very near to him, not twenty inches  away. At the time it was but a passing incident of no emotional value,  but afterwards it came back to him in his dreams. For this young man,  wedged upright in the crowd for a time, had been shot and was already  dead.    A fourth white star must have been lit by the man on the cable. Its  light came glaring in through vast windows and arches and showed Graham  that he was now one of a dense mass of flying black figures pressed back  across the lower area of the great theatre. This time the picture was  livid and fragmentary slashed and barred with black shadows. He saw that  quite near to him the red guards were fighting their way through the  people. He could not tell whether they saw him. He looked for Lincoln  and his guards. He saw Lincoln near the stage of the theatre surrounded  in a crowd of black-badged revolutionaries, lifted up and staring to  and fro as if seeking him. Graham perceived that he himself was near  the opposite edge of the crowd, that behind him, separated by a barrier,  sloped the now vacant seats of the theatre. A sudden idea came to him,  and he began fighting his way towards the barrier. As he reached it the  glare came to an end.    In a moment he had thrown off the great cloak that not only impeded  his movements but made him conspicuous, and had slipped it from his  shoulders. He heard someone trip in its folds. In another he was scaling  the barrier and had dropped into the blackness on the further side. Then  feeling his way he came to the lower end of an ascending gangway. In  the darkness the sound of firing ceased and the roar of feet and voices  lulled. Then suddenly he came to an unexpected step and tripped and  fell. As he did so pools and islands amidst the darkness about him leapt  to vivid light again, the uproar surged louder and the glare of the  fifth white star shone through the vast fenestrations of the theatre  walls.    He rolled over among some seats, heard a shouting and the whirring  rattle of weapons, struggled up and was knocked back again, perceived  that a number of black-badged men were all about him firing at the  rebels below, leaping from seat to seat, crouching among the seats  to reload. Instinctively he crouched amidst the seats, as stray shots  ripped the pneumatic cushions and cut bright slashes on their soft metal  frames. Instinctively he marked the direction of the gangways, the most  plausible way of escape for him so soon as the veil of darkness fell  again.    A young man in faded blue garments came vaulting over the seats.  \"Hullo!\" he said, with his flying feet within six inches of the  crouching Sleeper's face.    He stared without any sign of recognition, turned to fire, fired, and,  shouting, \"To hell with the Council!\" was about to fire again. Then it  seemed to Graham that the half of this man's neck had vanished. A  drop of moisture fell on Graham's cheek. The green weapon stopped  half raised. For a moment the man stood still with his face suddenly  expressionless, then he began to slant forward. His knees bent. Man and  darkness fell together. At the sound of his fall Graham rose up and ran  for his life until a step down to the gangway tripped him. He scrambled  to his feet, turned up the gangway and ran on.    When the sixth star glared he was already close to the yawning throat of  a passage. He ran on the swifter for the light, entered the passage  and turned a corner into absolute night again. He was knocked sideways,  rolled over, and recovered his feet. He found himself one of a crowd of  invisible fugitives pressing in one direction. His one thought now  was their thought also; to escape out of this fighting. He thrust and  struck, staggered, ran, was wedged tightly, lost ground and then was  clear again.    For some minutes he was running through the darkness along a winding  passage, and then he crossed some wide and open space, passed down a  long incline, and came at last down a flight of steps to a level place.  Many people were shouting, \"They are coming! The guards are coming. They  are firing. Get out of the fighting. The guards are firing. It will be  safe in Seventh Way. Along here to Seventh Way!\" There were women and  children in the crowd as well as men. Men called names to him. The crowd  converged on an archway, passed through a short throat and emerged on a  wider space again, lit dimly. The black figures about him spread out and  ran up what seemed in the twilight to be a gigantic series of steps. He  followed. The people dispersed to the right and left.... He perceived  that he was no longer in a crowd. He stopped near the highest step.  Before him, on that level, were groups of seats and a little kiosk. He  went up to this and, stopping in the shadow of its eaves, looked about  him panting.    Everything was vague and gray, but he recognised that these great steps  were a series of platforms of the \"ways,\" now motionless again. The  platform slanted up on either side, and the tall buildings rose beyond,  vast dim ghosts, their inscriptions and advertisements indistinctly  seen, and up through the girders and cables was a faint interrupted  ribbon of pallid sky. A number of people hurried by. From their shouts  and voices, it seemed they were hurrying to join the fighting. Other  less noisy figures flitted timidly among the shadows.    From very far away down the street he could hear the sound of a  struggle. But it was evident to him that this was not the street into  which the theatre opened. That former fight, it seemed, had suddenly  dropped out of sound and hearing. And--grotesque thought!--they were  fighting for him!    For a space he was like a man who pauses in the reading of a vivid book,  and suddenly doubts what he"]]]
