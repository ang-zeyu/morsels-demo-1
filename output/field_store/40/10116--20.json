Many children,  again, strolling into the fields, fall into ponds and ditches, and  are drowned. So numerous, indeed, are the dangers which surround the  infant poor, as to make a forcible appeal to the hearts of the pious  and humane, and to call loudly on them to unite in rescuing this  hitherto neglected part of the rising generation from the evils to  which they are exposed.    It is much to be regretted that those persons who most need employment  should be the last to procure it; but such is the fact, for there  are so many obstacles thrown in the way of married persons, and  especially, those with a family, that many are tempted to deny that  they have any children, for fear they should lose their situations,  though it is certainly an additional stimulus to a servant to behave  orderly, when he knows that he has others to look to him for support.    Shall I close this appeal for the necessity of educating the infant  poor by another and weightier argument? They are _responsible_ and  _immortal_ beings. It may be thought that I should have given this  plea the precedence of every other. I did not, because I felt  more anxious to make good my ground with the prudent and the  philanthropic--to show them that self-interest and humanity demand our  exertions in this cause. I knew that when I came to urge such efforts  upon the attention of the Christian, I could not possibly fail. No one  who is a sincere follower of Him who said \"Suffer little children to  come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom;\" no one  who professes to abide by the maxims of Him whose commandment was,  \"Love thy neighbour as thyself,\" can turn a deaf ear to the entreaties  of those who are necessitous and suffering. Thousands there are among  those of whom we have been speaking, who are brought up in as great  ignorance of God and religion, as though they had been born in a  country where the light of Revelation had never shone--where the glad  tidings of salvation have never been proclaimed. With examples of evil  continually before their eyes, both at home and abroad, we see and  hear its consequences daily in the wickedness with which our streets  abound, and in the lisped blasphemy and profanity of those who learn  to curse and swear before they can well walk.    Whilst I was at Lincoln, I was shocked beyond measure by the horrid  language of the boys; to such a pitch had the evil come, that the  magistrates were determined to fine all the men who were brought  before them for profane swearing; and I had the satisfaction of  hearing that four men had been fined whilst I was there. What a  blessing it would be if other magistrates throughout the kingdom would  follow their example!    Any person who has been accustomed to walk the streets of London, must  have heard how frequently children take the name of the Almighty in  vain; seldom or ever mentioning it but to confirm some oath. I have  seen boys playing at marbles, tops, and other games, and who, on  a dispute arising about some frivolous thing, would call upon the  Supreme Being to strike them deaf, dumb, or blind, nay, even dead,  if what they said were not true; when, nevertheless, I have been  satisfied from having observed the origin of the dispute, that the  party using the expressions has been telling a falsehood. Indeed so  common is this kind of language in the streets, that it often passes  without notice. I am inclined to think, that children accustomed to  use such expressions on every trifling occasion, will, when they grow  to riper years, pay very little respect to the sanctity of an oath. It  is, perhaps, one of the reasons why we hear of so much perjury in the  present day. At all events, little children cannot avoid hearing such  expressions, not only from those who are rather older than themselves,  but, I am sorry to say, even from their parents. I have known repeated  instances of this kind. Many little ones, when they first come to our  schools, make use of dreadful expressions, and when told that it is  wrong, will say that they did not know it was so; others, with the  greatest simplicity, have declared, that they had heard their fathers  or mothers say the same words. Hence I have had much difficulty in  persuading them that it was wrong, for they very naturally thought,  that if their parents made use of such language, they might do the  same. How great is the necessity of good example; and did parents  generally consider how apt children are to receive impressions, and to  become imitators, both in their words and actions, they would be more  cautious than they are. There are many parents who make use of very  bad expressions themselves, who would correct their children for using  the same;--as a proof of this, I will mention one circumstance, out of  many others, that took place in the school I superintended many years  since. We had a little girl there, five years old, who was so fond of  the school, that she frequently stopped after the usual hours to play  with my children and some others who chose to stay in the play-ground.  Many of them would stop till eight or nine o'clock at night, to which  I had no objection, provided their parents approved of it, and they  did not get into mischief; it being desirable to keep them out of the  streets as much as possible. It happened, however, one day, that some  of the children, offended this child, and she called them by dreadful  names, such as I cannot repeat; and, of course, the others were  terrified, and told me of them immediately. I was soon satisfied that  the child was ignorant of the meaning of what she said, for, as an  excuse for her conduct, she declared that she heard her father and  mother use the same words. I told the child, that notwithstanding her  parents might have done so, it was very wicked, and that I could not  let her stay another time to play, if ever she did so again. Having  sent for the mother, I informed her of the expressions the child had  used, but did not tell her what she had mentioned relative to her  parents, for if I had, she would have beaten her most unmercifully.  The mother, after having heard me relate the circumstance, immediately  flew into a passion with the child, and declared, that she would \"skin  her alive,\" (this was her expression,) and I had much difficulty to  restrain her from correcting the child in the school. Having pacified  her a little, I inquired where the child could have heard such wicked  expressions. She said she could not tell. I then told her, I hoped the  child did not learn them of her, or her father. To this she made no  answer, but I could perceive that she stood self-convicted, and having  said what I conceived necessary upon the occasion, I dismissed her,  observing that it was useless for ladies and gentlemen to establish  schools for the education of the infant poor, if the parents did not  assist by setting them a good example.    I am happy to state, that the advice I gave her was not thrown away,  as I never knew the child guilty of saying a bad word afterwards; and  the mother soon brought me another child, of two years and a half old,  and said she should be very glad if I would take it into the school,  and that she wished a blessing might always attend the gentlemen  who supported the institution. She also requested me to take an  opportunity of speaking a few words to her husband, for she was  thankful for what had been said to her. And here I would observe, that  although it is most undoubtedly true, that the good taught to children  in our infant schools is greatly counteracted by the conduct they  witness on their return home, yet we occasionally see, that these  little children, by the blessing of God, are made the means of  reforming their own parents. What a gratifying fact it is, that the  adult and hardened sinner, may be turned from his evil ways--from  death unto life--by an infant's precept or example!    Nor is it only in profane expressions that we see the influence of  evil. Some children I have known, in the same neighbourhood, who even  beat their parents. There was a poor widow, very near the school, who  was frequently to be seen with her face dreadfully bruised by  blows from her own son. He had been taken before a magistrate, and  imprisoned for three months, but it did him no good, for he afterwards  beat his mother as much as ever, and the poor woman had it in  contemplation to get the miscreant sent out of the country. One  Sunday, I remember to have seen a boy, under twelve years of age, take  up a large stone to throw at his mother: he had done something wrong  in the house, and the mother followed him into the street with a small  cane, to correct him for it; but he told his mother, that if she dared  to approach him, he would knock her down. The mother retired, and  the boy went where he pleased. These and many similar scenes I have  witnessed; and I am afraid that many such characters have been so  completely formed as to be past reformation. So essential is it, to  embrace the first opportunity of impressing on the infant mind the  principles of duty and virtue.    I am aware that many excellent institutions are in existence for the  spread of the gospel amongst the ignorant and depraved at home as well  as abroad; but I must here again advert to the readier reception of  religious truths in infancy, than by the adult and confirmed sinner.  I would not say to those who are engaged in the painful task--painful  because so often unsuccessful--forego your labours; but I would call  upon all who have at heart the everlasting welfare of the souls of  men, to exert themselves, that the rising generation may not likewise  grow up into that state of perverseness--that they may not in future  years prove themselves to be a generation, which, \"like the adder,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11028"],[0,"Philippine Folk-Tales (#17)"],[1,"was broken by the magic of her kisses, and the casket whispered  softly to her, \"I am thy true love. I was the heart of him who killed  himself for love of thee, and I was the youth who died for love of  thee, but at last I am contented. In life and death we shall never  more be separated.\" And it was so, for the woman lived to a great  age, carrying the casket always with her, inhaling its fragrance [17]  with her kisses, and when she died it was buried with her.      CHAPTER 15    The Priest, the Servant Boy, and the Child Jesus.    There was once a priest who had for his servant a very good boy. One  day the padre wanted the boy, and, after looking everywhere for him,  went to church. Opening the door quietly, he looked in and there he  saw that the statue of the child Jesus had left its shrine and was  down on the floor talking and playing with the boy. The priest slipped  softly away and ordered a very fine dinner cooked for the lad. When  the boy returned to the convent, the padre asked him where he had  been. \"I have been down to the church playing with a friend.\" \"Very  well, there is your dinner. If you play with your friend again, ask  him if I shall go to glory in heaven when I am dead.\" The boy took  his dinner to the church and ate, sharing it With the child Jesus.    \"Tell me, friend,\" said he to his heavenly companion, \"will my master,  the priest, go to glory in heaven?\"    \"No,\" said the child Jesus, \"because he has neglected his father and  mother.\" When the boy carried these words to the priest he became  very sad, and asked the lad to inquire whether he might atone for his  wrong by doing good to other old people. \"No,\" came the answer. \"It  must be his father and mother who shall receive their dues, and it  may be that he shall enter heaven alive.\"    So the priest sent for his poor old father and mother, and lavished  on them every care, suffering no one else to do the least thing for  them. At last the old people died, and the priest was very sad. Then  one night, as he slept, came soft and very beautiful music around about  and within the convent, and the boy awoke the priest to listen. \"Oh,\"  said the padre, \"it is perhaps the angels come to carry us alive to  heaven.\" And it was so. The angels carried the boy and the priest,  his master, to be in glory in heaven.      CHAPTER 16    The Story of Juan del Mundo de Austria and the Princess Maria.    There was once a king who had three very beautiful daughters, Princess  Clara, Princess Catalina, and Princess Maria.    This king was sick for a long time with a dreadful disease, and  although he spent much money on medicines and doctors he was only  worse instead of better.    At last he sent word to all his people proclaiming that whoever would  cure him might have one of the princesses to marry.    After several days one of the heralds returned, saying he had met  a snake who inquired if the king would give his daughter to a snake  to wife if he were cured. The king called his daughters and asked if  they would be willing to marry a snake.    Said Princess Clara, \"I will be stung by a snake till I am dead before  I give my virginity to a snake.\" Said Princess Catalina, \"I may be  beaten to death with sticks, but I will not give my virginity to a  snake.\" Said Princess Maria, \"Father, so you be but well, I care  not what becomes of me. If a snake can cure you, I am willing to  marry him.\"    So the king's message was carried to the snake, and the king was made  well. The snake and the princess were married, and set off through  the forest together. After a long journey they came to a house in the  forest, and there the snake and the beautiful Maria lived together  many days. But the snake, being very wise, saw that the princess ate  little and cried very much, and asked her why it was so. She told  him that it was hard for her to live with a snake. \"Very well,\" said  the snake, and went into a house near by; after a little there came  out a handsome man with silken clothes, and rings on his fingers,  who told her that he was her husband, that he was known among men as  Don Juan del Mundo de Austria, and that he was king of all the beasts,  being able to take the form of any of them at will.    They passed many happy days together till the time came for the great  feast at the court of Princess Maria's father. Don Juan told her that  she might go, but that she must on no account tell his name or rank,  otherwise when she came to their trysting-place by the seashore she  would not find him. He gave her a magic ring by means of which she  might obtain anything she wanted, and left her close to her own city.    When she arrived at home her sisters were greatly surprised to see  her looking well, happy, and much more finely dressed than when she  went away, but her father was very glad to see her. The elder sisters  often asked her the secret of her husband's identity, but her answer  was always the same, \"Did you not both see that I married a snake? Who  else could it be.\" The wicked women then determined to make her tell,  whether she wished or not, and so they asked her to walk with them  in a secluded garden.    Then they took sticks and set upon her, beating her and telling her  that she must tell who her husband was. The poor little princess  defended herself a long time, saying that if she told she would never  see him again, but finally, when she was nearly dead from beating,  she told them that her husband was Don Juan de Austria. Then she was  beaten for not telling the truth, but her tormentors finally desisted  and she went to her father and told him all.    He did not wish her to return to the forest and begged her to remain  with him, but she insisted.    When she arrived at the trysting-place, Don Juan was not there, but  she set out bravely, asking of her ring whatever she needed for food,  drink, and clothing. Wherever she went she inquired of the beasts  and birds the whereabouts of her husband, Don Juan de Austria, and,  when they knew who she was, they worshipped her and did all that  was required.    After many days of wandering she came to a place where there was a  giant, who was about to eat her, but when he knew her for Don Juan's  wife he worshipped her and sent her on her way. Soon she was found by  a young giantess who, too, was about to eat her, but when she learned  that Maria was the wife of Don Juan she carried her to her own house  and hid her, saying that she must be cared for a while until her  parents should return, for they might eat her without asking who she  was. When the old giant and his wife came back, they told her that  she must stay with them for a while, until they could find out about  the whereabouts of Don Juan, when they would help her further.    They were very good to her, for, said they, \"Don Juan is not only  king of the animals but of the giants and monsters of every kind.\"    Then the giants took her to Don Juan's city and found her a place in  the house of an old childless couple, and there she made her home. But  Don Juan had taken another wife, the Lady Loriana, and the new wife saw  the old and desired her for a servant. So the Princess Maria became  a servant of her rival, and often sat in old rags under the stairs  at her work, while her faithless husband passed her without seeing her.    The poor girl was torn with jealousy and spent much time thinking  about how she might win her husband again. So she asked the ring for  a toy in the form of a beautiful little chick, just from the egg.    The Lady Loriana saw the pretty toy and begged for it. \"No,\" said  Maria, \"unless you grant me a little favor, that I may sleep on the  floor to-night in your room.\" So Loriana, suspecting no deceit, agreed.    That night Maria wished on her ring that Loriana might be overcome with  sleep, and again that her own rags might be transformed into royal  raiment and that her tiara should glitter on her forehead. Then she  went to the head of the bed and called Don Juan. At first he would  not answer, then, without turning to look at the speaker, he bade  her go away, as his wife would be angry. \"But that is not your wife,  Don Juan,\" said Maria; \"I am your true wife, Maria. Look at my dress  and the jewels on my forehead--my face, the ring on my finger.\" And  Don Juan saw that she was indeed the deserted wife, and after he had  heard the sad story of her wanderings he loved her afresh. The next day  at noon-time Maria was not to be found, although Dona Loriana looked  everywhere. At last she looked into Don Juan's room, and there, locked  in each other's arms fast asleep, were Don Juan and Princess Maria.    Loriana aroused them, angrily saying to Maria, \"Why do you wish  to steal my husband? You must leave this house at once.\" But Maria  resisted saying, \"No, he is not your husband but mine, and I will  not give him up.\" And so they quarrelled long and bitterly, but at  last agreed to be judged by the council.    There each told her story, and Maria showed Don Juan's enchanted ring,  which worked its wonders for her but would not obey the Lady Loriana.    When the matter was decided, it was the judgment of all, including  the Archbishop, that Maria was the lawful wife, but that she and Don  Juan must go away and never return.    So Don Juan and the Princess Maria went away and lived long and  happily.        CHAPTER 17    The Artificial Earthquake.    There was once in another town a man who had three daughters, all very  beautiful. But one of them had an admirer, who by some means excited  the old man's wrath, and the daughter was sent to a distant place.    This in turn made the young man angry, and he determined to have  revenge. He took a strong rope and attached it to one of the corner  upright posts of the house, and waiting till it was dark and still  inside, he hid behind a tree and began to pull the rope, alternately  hauling and slacking.    \"Oh!\" said one of the girls, \"there is"]]]
