I went to  Cahors, where I remained six months, and made the acquaintance of an old  man, who was commonly known to the people as 'the Philosopher;' a name  which, in country places, is often bestowed upon people whose only merit  is, that they are less ignorant than their neighbours. I showed him my  collection of alchymical receipts, and asked his opinion upon them. He  picked out ten or twelve of them, merely saying that they were better  than the others. When the plague ceased, I returned to Toulouse, and  recommenced my experiments in search of the stone. I worked to such  effect that my four hundred crowns were reduced to one hundred and  seventy.    \"That I might continue my work on a safer method, I made acquaintance,  in 1537, with a certain Abbe, who resided in the neighbourhood. He  was smitten with the same mania as myself, and told me that one of  his friends, who had followed to Rome in the retinue of the Cardinal  d'Armagnac, had sent him from that city a new receipt, which could not  fail to transmute iron and copper, but which would cost two hundred  crowns. I provided half this money, and the Abbe the rest; and we began  to operate at our joint expense. As we required spirits of wine for our  experiment, I bought a tun of excellent vin de Gaillac. I extracted the  spirit, and rectified it several times. We took a quantity of this,  into which we put four marks of silver, and one of gold, that had been  undergoing the process of calcination for a month. We put this mixture  cleverly into a sort of horn-shaped vessel, with another to serve as  a retort; and placed the whole apparatus upon our furnace, to produce  congelation. This experiment lasted a year; but, not to remain idle,  we amused ourselves with many other less important operations. We drew  quite as much profit from these as from our great work.    \"The whole of the year 1537 passed over without producing any change  whatever: in fact, we might have waited till doomsday for the  congelation of our spirits of wine. However, we made a projection with  it upon some heated quicksilver; but all was in vain. Judge of our  chagrin, especially of that of the Abbe, who had already boasted to all  the monks of his monastery, that they had only to bring the large pump  which stood in a corner of the cloister, and he would convert it into  gold; but this ill luck did not prevent us from persevering. I once more  mortgaged my paternal lands for four hundred crowns, the whole of which  I determined to devote to a renewal of my search for the great secret.  The Abbe contributed the same sum; and, with these eight hundred crowns,  I proceeded to Paris, a city more abounding with alchymists than any  other in the world, resolved never to leave it until I had either found  the philosopher's stone, or spent all my money. This journey gave the  greatest offence to all my relations and friends, who, imagining that  I was fitted to be a great lawyer, were anxious that I should establish  myself in that profession. For the sake of quietness, I pretended, at  last, that such was my object.    \"After travelling for fifteen days, I arrived in Paris, on the 9th  of January 1539. I remained for a month, almost unknown; but I had no  sooner begun to frequent the amateurs of the science, and visited the  shops of the furnace-makers, than I had the acquaintance of more than a  hundred operative alchymists, each of whom had a different theory and  a different mode of working. Some of them preferred cementation; others  sought the universal alkahest, or dissolvent; and some of them boasted  the great efficacy of the essence of emery. Some of them endeavoured to  extract mercury from other metals to fix it afterwards; and, in order  that each of us should be thoroughly acquainted with the proceedings  of the others, we agreed to meet somewhere every night, and report  progress. We met sometimes at the house of one, and sometimes in the  garret of another; not only on week days, but on Sundays, and the great  festivals of the Church. 'Ah!' one used to say, 'if I had the means  of recommencing this experiment, I should do something.' 'Yes,' said  another, 'if my crucible had not cracked, I should have succeeded before  now:' while a third exclaimed, with a sigh, 'If I had but had a round  copper vessel of sufficient strength, I would have fixed mercury with  silver.' There was not one among them who had not some excuse for his  failure; but I was deaf to all their speeches. I did not want to part  with my money to any of them, remembering how often I had been the dupe  of such promises.    \"A Greek at last presented himself; and with him I worked a long  time uselessly upon nails, made of cinabar, or vermilion. I was also  acquainted with a foreign gentleman newly arrived in Paris, and often  accompanied him to the shops of the goldsmiths, to sell pieces of gold  and silver, the produce, as he said, of his experiments. I stuck closely  to him for a long time, in the hope that he would impart his secret. He  refused for a long time, but acceded, at last, on my earnest entreaty,  and I found that it was nothing more than an ingenious trick. I did not  fail to inform my friend, the Abbe, whom I had left at Toulouse, of  all my adventures; and sent him, among other matters, a relation of the  trick by which this gentleman pretended to turn lead into gold. The Abbe  still imagined that I should succeed at last, and advised me to remain  another year in Paris, where I had made so good a beginning. I remained  there three years; but, notwithstanding all my efforts, I had no more  success than I had had elsewhere.    \"I had just got to the end of my money, when I received a letter from  the Abbe, telling me to leave everything, and join him immediately at  Toulouse. I went accordingly, and found that he had received letters  from the King of Navarre (grandfather of Henry IV). This Prince was a  great lover of philosophy, full of curiosity, and had written to the  Abbe, that I should visit him at Pau; and that he would give me three  or four thousand crowns, if I would communicate the secret I had learned  from the foreign gentleman. The Abbe's ears were so tickled with the  four thousand crowns, that he let me have no peace, night or day, until  he had fairly seen me on the road to Pau. I arrived at that place in  the month of May 1542. I worked away, and succeeded, according to the  receipt I had obtained. When I had finished, to the satisfaction of the  King, he gave me the reward that I expected. Although he was willing  enough to do me further service, he was dissuaded from it by the lords  of his court; even by many of those who had been most anxious that  I should come. He sent me then about my business, with many thanks;  saying, that if there was anything in his kingdom which he could give  me--such as the produce of confiscations, or the like--he should be  most happy. I thought I might stay long enough for these prospective  confiscations, and never get them at last; and I therefore determined to  go back to my friend, the Abbe.    \"I learned, that on the road between Pau and Toulouse, there resided a  monk, who was very skilful in all matters of natural philosophy. On my  return, I paid him a visit. He pitied me very much, and advised me, with  much warmth and kindness of expression, not to amuse myself any longer  with such experiments as these, which were all false and sophistical;  but that I should read the good books of the old philosophers, where I  might not only find the true matter of the science of alchymy, but learn  also the exact order of operations which ought to be followed. I very  much approved of this wise advice; but, before I acted upon it, I  went back to my Abbe, of Toulouse, to give him an account of the eight  hundred crowns, which we had had in common; and, at the same time, share  with him such reward as I had received from the King of Navarre. If he  was little satisfied with the relation of my adventures since our first  separation, he appeared still less satisfied when I told him I had  formed a resolution to renounce the search for the philosopher's stone.  The reason was, that he thought me a good artist. Of our eight hundred  crowns, there remained but one hundred and seventy-six. When I quitted  the Abbe, I went to my own house, with the intention of remaining there,  till I had read all the old philosophers, and of then proceeding to  Paris.    \"I arrived in Paris on the day after All Saints, of the year 1546, and  devoted another year to the assiduous study of great authors. Among  others, the 'Turba Philosophorum' of the 'Good Trevisan,' 'The  Remonstance of Nature to the wandering Alchymist,' by Jean de Meung; and  several others of the best books: but, as I had no right' principles, I  did not well know what course to follow.    \"At last I left my solitude; not to see my former acquaintances, the  adepts and operators, but to frequent the society of true philosophers.  Among them I fell into still greater uncertainties; being, in fact,  completely bewildered by the variety of operations which they showed me.  Spurred on, nevertheless, by a sort of frenzy or inspiration, I threw  myself into the works of Raymond Lulli and of Arnold de Villeneuve. The  reading of these, and the reflections I made upon them, occupied me for  another year, when I finally determined on the course I should adopt.  I was obliged to wait, however, until I had mortgaged another very  considerable portion of my patrimony. This business was not settled  until the beginning of Lent, 1549, when I commenced my operations. I  laid in a stock of all that was necessary, and began to work the  day after Easter. It was not, however, without some disquietude and  opposition from my friends who came about me; one asking me what I was  going to do, and whether I had not already spent money enough upon such  follies. Another assured me that, if I bought"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8866"],[0,"Wild Flowers Worth Knowing (#16)"],[1,"under a ranunculus,  which grew by itself in a meadow, and bid the secretary find it if he  could. The wand discovered nothing, and Linnaeus's mark was soon  trampled down by the company present, so that when he went to finish  the experiment by fetching the gold himself, he was utterly at a loss  where to find it. The man with the wand assisted him, and informed him  that it could not lie in the way they were going, but quite the  contrary; so they pursued the direction of the wand, and actually dug  out the gold. Linnaeus said that another such experiment would be  sufficient to make a proselyte of him.\"    Many a well has been dug even in this land of liberty where our  witch-hazel indicated; but here its kindly magic is directed chiefly  through the soothing extract distilled from its juices. Its yellow,  thread-like blossoms are the latest to appear in the autumn woods.          ROSE FAMILY _(Rosaceae)_      Hardhack; Steeple Bush    _Spiraea tomentosa_    _Flowers_--Pink or magenta, rarely white, very small, in dense,  pyramidal clusters. Calyx of 5 sepals; corolla of 5 rounded petals;  stamens, 20 to 60; usually 5 pistils, downy. _Stem:_ 2 to 3 ft. high,  erect, shrubby, simple, downy. _Leaves:_ Dark green above, covered with  whitish woolly hairs beneath; oval, saw-edged, 1 to 2 in. long.    _Preferred Habitat_--Low, moist ground, roadside ditches, swamps.    _Flowering Season_--July-September.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia westward, and southward to Georgia and  Kansas.    An instant's comparison shows the steeple bush to be closely related to  the fleecy, white meadow-sweet, often found growing near. The pink  spires, which bloom from the top downward, have pale brown tips where  the withered flowers are, toward the end of summer.    Why is the underside of the leaves so woolly? Not as a protection  against wingless insects crawling upward, that is certain; for such  could only benefit these tiny clustered flowers. Not against the sun's  rays, for it is only the under surface that is coated. When the upper  leaf surface is hairy, we know that the plant is protected in this way  from perspiring too freely. Doubtless these leaves of the steeple bush,  like those of other plants that choose a similar habitat, have woolly  hairs beneath as an absorbent to protect their pores from clogging with  the vapors that must rise from the damp ground where the plant grows. If  these pores were filled with moisture from without, how could they  possibly throw off the waste of the plant? All plants are largely  dependent upon free perspiration for health, but especially those whose  roots, struck in wet ground, are constantly sending up moisture through  the stem and leaves.      Meadow-sweet; Quaker Lady; Queen-of-the-Meadow    _Spiraea salicifolia_    _Flowers_--Small, white, or flesh pink, clustered in dense, pyramidal  terminal panicles. Calyx 5 cleft; corolla of 5 rounded petals; stamens  numerous; pistils 5 to 8. _Stem:_ 2 to 4 ft. high, simple or bushy,  smooth, usually reddish. _Leaves:_ Alternate, oval, or oblong,  saw-edged.    _Preferred Habitat_--Low meadows, swamps, fence-rows, ditches.    _Flowering Season_--June-August.    _Distribution_--Newfoundland to Georgia, west to Rocky Mountains.  Europe and Asia.    Fleecy white plumes of meadow-sweet, the \"spires of closely clustered  bloom\" sung by Dora Read Goodale, are surely not frequently found near  dusty \"waysides scorched with barren heat,\" even in her Berkshires;  their preference is for moister soil, often in the same habitat with a  first cousin, the pink steeple-bush. But plants, like humans, are  capricious creatures. If the meadow-sweet always elected to grow in damp  ground whose rising mists would clog the pores of its leaves, doubtless  they would be protected with a woolly absorbent, as its cousins are.    Inasmuch as perfume serves as an attraction to the more highly  specialized, aesthetic insects, not required by the spiraeas, our  meadow-sweet has none, in spite of its misleading name. Small bees,  flies, and beetles, among other visitors, come in great numbers, seeking  the accessible pollen, and, in this case, nectar also, secreted in a  conspicuous orange-colored disk.      Common Hawthorn; White Thorn; Scarlet-fruited Thorn; Red Haw;  Mayflower    _Crataegus coccinea_    _Flowers_--White, rarely pinkish, usually less than 1 in. across,  numerous, in terminal corymbs. Calyx 5-lobed; 5 spreading petals  inserted in its throat; numerous stamens; styles 3 to 5. _Stem:_ A  shrub or small tree, rarely attaining 30 ft. in height (_Kratos_ =  strength, in reference to hardness and toughness of the wood); branches  spreading, and beset with stout spines (thorns) nearly 2 in. long.  _Leaves:_ Alternate, petioled, 2 to 3 in. long, ovate, very sharply cut  or lobed, the teeth glandular-tipped. _Fruit:_ Coral red, round or  oval; not edible.    _Preferred Habitat--_Thickets, fence-rows, woodland borders.    _Flowering Season_--May.    _Distribution_--Newfoundland and Manitoba southward to the Gulf  of Mexico.      \"The fair maid who, the first of May,    Goes to the fields at break of day    And washes in dew from the hawthorn tree    Will ever after handsome be.\"    Here is a popular recipe omitted from that volume of heart-to-heart  talks entitled \"How to Be Pretty Though Plain!\"    The sombre-thoughted Scotchman, looking for trouble, tersely observes:      \"Mony haws,    Mony snaws.\"    But in delicious, blossoming May, when the joy of living fairly  intoxicates one, and every bird's throat is swelling with happy music,  who but a Calvinist would croak dismal prophecies? In Ireland, old  crones tell marvellous tales about the hawthorns, and the banshees which  have a predilection for them.      Five-finger; Common Cinquefoil    _Potentilla canadensis_    _Flowers_--Yellow, 1/4 to 1/2 in. across, growing singly on long  peduncles from the leaf axils. Five petals longer than the 5 acute calyx  lobes with 5 linear bracts between them; about 20 stamens; pistils  numerous, forming a head. _Stem:_ Spreading over ground by slender  runners or ascending. _Leaves:_ 5-fingered, the digitate, saw-edged  leaflets (rarely 3 or 4) spreading from a common point, petioled; some  in a tuft at base.    _Preferred Habitat_--Dry fields, roadsides, hills, banks.    _Flowering Season_--April-August.    _Distribution_--Quebec to Georgia, and westward beyond the Mississippi.    Every one crossing dry fields in the eastern United States and Canada at  least must have trod on a carpet of cinquefoil (_cinque_ = five,  _feuilles_ = leaves), and have noticed the bright little blossoms among  the pretty foliage, possibly mistaking the plant for its cousin, the  trefoliate barren strawberry. Both have flowers like miniature wild  yellow roses. During the Middle Ages, when misdirected zeal credited  almost any plant with healing virtues for every ill that flesh is heir  to, the cinquefoils were considered most potent remedies, hence their  generic name.      High Bush Blackberry; Bramble    _Rubus villosus_    _Flowers_--White, 1 in. or less across, in terminal raceme-like  clusters. Calyx deeply 5-parted, persistent; 5 large petals; stamens and  carpels numerous, the latter inserted on a pulpy receptacle. _Stem:_ 3  to 10 ft. high, woody, furrowed, curved, armed with stout, recurved  prickles. _Leaves:_ Compounded of 3 to 5 ovate, saw-edged leaflets, the  end one stalked, all hairy beneath. _Fruit:_ Firmly attached to the  receptacle; nearly black, oblong juicy berries 1 in. long or less,  hanging in clusters. Ripe, July-August.    _Preferred Habitat_--Dry soil, thickets, fence-rows, old fields,  waysides. Low altitudes.    _Flowering Season_--May-June.    _Distribution_--New England to Florida, and far westward.      \"There was a man of our town,       And he was wondrous wise,     He jumped into a bramble bush\"--    If we must have poetical associations for every flower, Mother Goose  furnishes several.    But for the practical mind this plant's chief interest lies in the fact  that from its wild varieties the famous Lawton and Kittatinny  blackberries have been derived. The late Peter Henderson used to tell  how the former came to be introduced. A certain Mr. Secor found an  unusually fine blackberry growing wild in a hedge at New Rochelle, New  York, and removed it to his garden, where it increased apace. But not  even for a gift could he induce a neighbor to relieve him of the  superfluous bushes, so little esteemed were blackberries in his day.  However, a shrewd lawyer named Lawton at length took hold of it,  exhibited the fruit, advertised it cleverly, and succeeded in pocketing  a snug little fortune from the sale of the prolific plants. Another fine  variety of the common wild blackberry, which was discovered by a  clergyman at the edge of the woods on the Kittatinny Mountains in New  Jersey, has produced fruit under skilled cultivation that still remains  the best of its class. When clusters of blossoms and fruit in various  stages of green, red, and black hang on the same bush, few ornaments in  Nature's garden are more decorative.        Purple-flowering or Virginia Raspberry    _Rubus odoratus_      _Flowers_--Royal purple or bluish pink, showy, fragrant, 1 to 2 in.  broad, loosely clustered at top of stem. Calyx sticky-hairy, deeply  5-parted, with long, pointed tips; corolla of 5 rounded petals; stamens  and pistils very numerous. _Stem_: 3 to 5 ft. high, erect, branched,  shrubby, bristly, not prickly. _Leaves_: Alternate, petioled, 3 to 5  lobed, middle lobe largest, and all pointed; saw-edged lower leaves  immense. _Fruit_: A depressed red berry, scarcely edible.    _Preferred Habitat_--Rocky woods, dells, shady roadsides.    _Flowering Season_--June-August.    _Distribution_--Northern Canada south to Georgia, westward to Michigan  and Tennessee.
