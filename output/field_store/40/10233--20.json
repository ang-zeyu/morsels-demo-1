Wrap  jars with paper to prevent bleaching.      PIGEONS    _Young_ pigeons. Dress pigeons, wash well, and roast for 30 minutes  basting frequently. Some pieces of fat bacon put over the breasts will  prevent them getting too dry.    _Old_ pigeons. Dress, wash, and fry pigeons.    Brown some onions in the fat with the pigeons, using a pound of onions  to a dozen birds. Cover with hot water after pigeons and onions are a  golden brown; simmer until the meat is tender and can be removed from  the bones. Add from time to time boiling water, if necessary, in order  to keep the birds covered. When tender, take meat from bones. Return  the meat to the liquor, salt to taste and pack while boiling into cans  or jars, fill with liquor to within one-half inch of top.    All small game birds may be canned like pigeons. Blackbirds may be  treated like pigeons. They make an excellent stew.      PLAIN CANNING OF TENDER COTTON-TAILS OR TWICE-SKINNED JACK-RABBITS    1. Blanch in boiling water until the meat is white.    2. Cold dip.    3. Pack tightly in sterilized jars.    4. Add boiling water and 1 teaspoonful salt to quart.    5. Adjust rubber and lid.    6. Sterilize in hot water bath for three hours.    7. Remove from bath and complete the seal.    Rabbit meat thus canned, may be served in various appetizing ways.      RABBIT SAUSAGE    For rabbit sausage and mince-meat only the backs and legs of the  carcass are used, discarding the sinews.    Grind together equal parts of rabbit and fat pork (or at least 1/4 fat  pork). The pork may be salt pork if all salt is omitted from the  mixture.    To every ten pounds of the above add 6 teaspoonfuls salt, 1  teaspoonful of pepper, 2 teaspoonfuls powdered sage. Mix thoroughly.  Shape in flat cakes and fry till nicely browned. Pack tightly in jars,  pour over the fat in which the sausage was fried, and sterilize.      RABBIT MINCE-MEAT    Rabbit mince-meat is used a great deal on the plains and large  quantities of it are canned. The mince-meat may be made by simply  substituting the rabbit meat for beef in your favorite recipe. The  following is an inexpensive recipe:    1 Cup of rabbit meat which has been parboiled in salted water and  drained, then chopped finely.    1 Cup chopped apple.    1/2 Cup finely chopped suet.    1/2 Cup seeded raisins.    1/2 Cup currants.    1 Cup molasses or syrup.    2 Tablespoonfuls sugar.    1 Tablespoon cider, lemon juice, fruit juice or vinegar.    1/4 Cup chopped watermelon pickles or green tomato pickles.    1 Teaspoon of cinnamon or nutmeg.    1 Teaspoon of salt.    1/2 Teaspoon cloves, mace or other spice.    Mix together all ingredients except the meat, add the meat broth and  simmer for about 1 hour. Add the meat. Pour into jars, and sterilize.  Remove and seal.      STEPS IN CANNING MEAT AND GAME    For all meat, poultry or game canning the following general  instructions should be kept in mind.    1. Sterilize the jars, caps and rubbers.    2. Grade the meat for size.    3. Cut up into convenient portions for cooking or canning.    4. Saute, fry or bake, broil or stew as desired. This step can be  omitted if you are an experienced canner.    5. Pack in sterilized, hot jars or tin cans.    6. Add 1 level teaspoonful salt per quart of meat for seasoning if not  already seasoned.    7. If glass jars put on rubber and seal, not too tight. Seal tin cans.    8. Process in boiling water or steam under pressure.    9. Remove, completely seal the jar.    10. Invert to cool and test the joint.    11. Label and store.      If you can in tin use the enamel or lacquered cans. A slight amount of  water in the bottom of the jars of prepared meat will insure quicker  sterilization of the air remaining in the jar. Where meat has been  stewed the liquor can be poured into the jar for filling. If you use a  steam-pressure cooker outfit of course the time of cooking will be  much shorter than if you use a wash-boiler or some other homemade  outfit. If you cook in boiling water we call that the water-bath  method.    The following data will be of interest to those who contemplate  canning meat.    Hog on foot--weight 500.    Liver, heart and a part of the ribs were eaten at the time of  butchering, therefore, not canned. The remainder of the ribs canned  six No. 3 cans:    Ham        18, No. 3 cans    Shoulder   18, No. 3 cans    Roast      18, No. 3 cans    Sausage    26, No. 3 cans    Hash        4, No. 3 cans    Gravy       5, No. 3 cans    (which is also called stock)    The sausage weighed 52 lbs. before it was canned, making 2 lbs. to the  can.    There were 200 lbs. of fat for lard. After it was rendered there were  176 lbs. of lard and 20 lbs. of cracklings.

For instance--S.R.  means spareribs; G. means goulash; R.B. means roast beef. You can make  out your list and mark accordingly.          CHAPTER VIII    FISH      People in some sections of the country are interested in canning  mountain trout and others live where there is an abundant supply of  either fresh-water fish or salt-water fish. Heretofore we have been  wasteful and lax about the fish supply. But as we have learned to can  vegetables and meats so we are going to learn to can fish. Fish is  really canned the same in every step after preparation as peas and  corn are canned.    In order to have a good product, fish must be fresh when canned. No  time should be lost in handling the fish after being caught.  Putrefaction starts rapidly, and the fish must be handled promptly.  The sooner it is canned after being taken from lake, stream or ocean,  the better. Never attempt to can any fish that is stale.      PREPARATION OF FISH FOR CANNING    As soon as fish are caught it is advisable to kill them with a knife  and allow the blood to run out. Scale fish. This is easily done if the  fish is dipped in boiling water. For canning, most varieties of fish  need not be skinned. If the fish is very large and coarse, the large  back fin may be cut out and the backbone removed, but with most  varieties this is unnecessary. Cut off the head and tail, being  careful to leave no more meat than necessary on the parts removed.  Remove the entrails and the dark membrane that in some fish (e.g.,  mullets) covers the abdominal cavity. Thoroughly clean the inside. The  head may be cleaned and used for fish chowder.    If you wish to be sure that all blood is drawn out before canning,  place the fish in a brine made of one ounce of salt to one quart of  water. Allow the fish to soak from 10 minutes to 1 hour according to  the thickness of the fish. Never use this brine but once. If the meat  of the fish is very soft or loose, it may be hardened by soaking in a  brine (strong enough to float an Irish potato) for from 15 minutes to  an hour, depending on the thickness of the pieces and the softness of  the flesh.      CANNING THE FISH    1. Remove the fish from the brine where it has been placed in order to  draw out all the blood and to harden the texture of the fish.    2. Drain well.    3. Cut into can lengths.    4. Place fish in a piece of cheesecloth or in a wire basket and blanch  in _boiling water_ from three to five minutes. Three minutes for the  soft flesh fish, such as suckers, crappies, whitefish. Fish with a  firmer flesh, as pike, muskalonge and sunfish require 5 minutes  blanching. The blanching removes the strong fish flavor and cleans the  outside of the fish.    5.

Both men had previously held the Premiership, and, as  they represented different wings of the Whig-Liberal party, it was  prophesied by political wiseacres that personal friction would soon lead  to a new disruption. Nor were the possible elements of discord confined  to these two. Gladstone, formerly a Peelite Tory, and for a time  uncertain whether to return to the Tory fold or to join the Liberals,  had yielded to Palmerston's promise of a free hand in financial matters,  and had joined the Ministry as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Opposed to  him in a certain sense, as the rival claimant for political leadership  among the younger group, was Sir George Cornewall Lewis, Home Secretary  until July, 1861, thereafter until his death in April, 1863, Secretary  for War. Acting in some degree as intermediary and conciliator between  these divergent interests stood Lord Granville, President of Council,  then a \"Conservative-Liberal,\" especially valuable to the Cabinet for  the confidence reposed in him by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.    In 1861 Palmerston was seventy-seven years old. Long before this he had  built his popularity upon a vigorous British \"patriotism,\" assertive of  England's honour and jealous for British advantage. Now, however, as  head of a Government requiring the most delicate handling to maintain  itself, he devoted his energies to details of political management in  which he had great skill. His ambition was, primarily, to retain office,  and in this purpose he was fortunate because, unknown to his ministerial  colleagues, he had received an indirect pledge from Lord Derby, the  Opposition leader, that there would be, for a time at least, no  determined effort to unseat him so long as his Ministry brought forward  no Bill for a further expansion of the franchise. In the unwillingness  to make any further adventure toward an expanded democracy Palmerston  was wholly at one with Derby. Of like opinion, though less strongly so,  was Russell, whose popular nickname, \"Finality John,\" gained by his  assertion that the Reform Bill of 1832 was England's last step toward  democracy, sufficiently indicates his stand on the franchise  question. In fact every member of the Cabinet belonged to the  \"Conservative-Liberal\" group, though with shades of political faith, and  none were really Liberals--far less Radicals. The outspoken Radicals in  Parliament, like John Bright, and his friend Cobden, who had refused to  take office under Palmerston, gave a lukewarm support to the Ministry,  but would not pledge themselves to steadfast adherence. They had hopes  of Gladstone, believed that he would ultimately come into their group,  but meanwhile watched with anxiety his delighted immersion, as indeed  Palmerston desired it, in the details of financial management to the  exclusion of other questions.    The matter of ministerial and general British attitude toward democracy  as affecting British policy during the American Civil War will be  considered in a later chapter. In the spring of 1861 it had not become a  clear-cut British opinion and did not, so far as historical evidence can  determine, affect early governmental policy toward America. The  outstanding feature of the British Government in 1861 is that it was  made up of various so-called \"Liberal\" elements, the representatives of  each of which carried on the business of his own department much as he  pleased. Palmerston's was, of course, the deciding opinion, whenever he  cared to express it, but this he did but rarely. His great concern was  to keep his all-star associates running smoothly together and thus to  give no occasion for parliamentary criticism and attack. It followed  that Russell, eight years the junior of Palmerston, was in foreign  affairs more powerful and independent than is customary. Indeed the  Government was at times spoken of as the \"Palmerston-Russell Ministry.\"  These two were the leaders of the team; next came Gladstone and  Cornewall Lewis, rivals of the younger generation, and each eager to  lead when their elders should retire from harness. Gladstone's great  ability was already recognized, but"]]]
