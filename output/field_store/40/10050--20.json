Having quitted this womb, so appropriate to conserve  his existence, to unfold his qualities, to strengthen his habits; so  competent to give, for a season, consistence to the weak rudiments of  his frame; he travels through the stage of infancy; he becomes adult:  his body has then acquired a considerable extension of bulk, his motion  is marked, his action is visible, he is sensible in all his parts; he is  a living, an active mass; that is to say, a combination that feels and  thinks; that fulfils the functions peculiar to beings of his species.  But how has he become sensible? Because he has been by degrees  nourished, enlarged, repaired by the continual attraction that takes  place within himself, of that kind of matter which is pronounced inert,  insensible, inanimate; which is, nevertheless, continually combining  itself with his machine; of which it forms an active whole, that is  living, that feels, judges, reasons, wills, deliberates, chooses,  elects; that has the capability of labouring, more or less  efficaciously, to his own individual preservation; that is to say, to  the maintenance of the harmony of his existence.    All the motion and changes that man experiences in the course of his  life, whether it be from exterior objects or from those substances  contained within himself, are either favorable or prejudicial to his  existence; either maintain its order, or throw it into confusion; are  either in conformity with, or repugnant to, the essential tendency of  his peculiar mode of being. He is compelled by Nature to approve of  some, to disapprove of others; some of necessity render him happy,  others contribute to his misery; some become the objects of his most  ardent desire, others of his determined aversion: some elicit his  confidence, others make him tremble with fear.    In all the phenomena man presents, from the moment he quits the womb  of his mother, to that wherein he becomes the inhabitant of the silent  tomb, he perceives nothing but a succession of necessary causes and  effects, which are strictly conformable to those laws that are common  to all the beings in Nature. All his modes of action--all his  sensations--all his ideas--all his passions--every act of his  will--every impulse which he either gives or receives, are the necessary  consequences of his own peculiar properties, and those which he finds in  the various beings by whom he is moved. Every thing he does--every thing  that passes within himself--his concealed motion--his visible action,  are the effects of inert force--of self-gravitation--the attractive or  repulsive powers contained in his machine--of the tendency he has, in  common with other beings, to his own individual preservation; in short,  of that energy which is the common property of every being he beholds.  Nature, in man, does nothing more than shew, in a decided manner, what  belongs to the peculiar nature by which he is distinguished from the  beings of a different system or order.    The source of those errors into which man has fallen, when he has  contemplated himself, has its rise, as will presently be shown, in the  opinion he has entertained, that he moved by himself--that he always  acts by his own natural energy--that in his actions, in the will that  gave him impulse, he was independent of the general laws of Nature; and  of those objects which, frequently, without his knowledge, always in  spite of him, in obedience to these laws, are continually acting upon  him. If he had examined himself attentively, he must have acknowledged,  that none of the motion he underwent was spontaneous--he must have  discovered, that even his birth depended on causes, wholly out of the  reach of his own powers--that, it was without his own consent he entered  into the system in which he occupies a place--that, from the moment  in which he is born, until that in which he dies, he is continually  impelled by causes, which, in spite of himself, influence his frame,  modify his existence, dispose of his conduct. Would not the slightest  reflection have sufficed to prove to him, that the fluids, the solids,  of which his body is composed, as well as that concealed mechanism,  which he believes to be independent of exterior causes, are, in fact,  perpetually under the influence of these causes; that without them he  finds himself in a total incapacity to act? Would he not have seen,  that his temperament, his constitution, did in no wise depend on  himself--that his passions are the necessary consequence of this  temperament--that his will is influenced, his actions determined by  these passions; consequently by opinions, which he has not given to  himself, of which he is not the master? His blood, more or less heated  or abundant; his nerves more or less braced, his fibres more or less  relaxed, give him dispositions either transitory or durable--are not  these, at every moment decisive of his ideas; of his thoughts: of his  desires: of his fears: of his motion, whether visible or concealed? The  state in which he finds himself, does it not necessarily depend on the  air which surrounds him diversely modified; on the various properties  of the aliments which nourish him; on the secret combinations that form  themselves in his machine, which either preserve its order, or throw it  into confusion? In short, had man fairly studied himself, every thing  must have convinced him, that in every moment of his duration, he was  nothing more than a passive instrument in the hands of necessity.    Thus it must appear, that where all is connected, where all the causes  are linked one to the other, where the whole forms but one immense  chain, there cannot be any independent, any isolated energy; any  detached power. It follows then, that Nature, always in action, marks  out to man each point of the line he is bound to describe; establishes  the route, by which he must travel. It is Nature that elaborates, that  combines the elements of which he must be composed;--It is Nature that  gives him his being, his tendency, his peculiar mode of action. It is  Nature that develops him, expands him, strengthens him, increases his  bulk--preserves him for a season, during which he is obliged to fulfil  the task imposed on him. It is Nature, that in his journey through life,  strews on the road those objects, those events; those adventures,  that modify him in a variety of ways, that give him impulses which  are sometimes agreeable and beneficial, at others prejudicial and  disagreeable. It is Nature, that in giving him feeling, in supplying him  with sentiment, has endowed him with capacity to choose, the means to  elect those objects, to take those methods that are most conducive, most  suitable, most natural, to his conservation. It is Nature, who when he  has run his race, when he has finished his career, when he has  described the circle marked out for him, conducts him in his turn to  his destruction; dissolves the union of his elementary particles,  and obliges him to undergo the constant, the universal law; from the  operation of which nothing is exempted. It is thus, motion places man in  the matrix of his mother; brings him forth out of her womb; sustains  him for a season; at length destroys him; obliges him to return into  the bosom of Nature; who speedily reproduces him, scattered under an  infinity of forms; in which each of his particles run over again, in the  same manner, the different stages, as necessary as the whole had before  run over those of his preceding existence.    The beings of the human species, as well as all other beings, are  susceptible of two sorts of motion: the one, that of the mass, by which  an entire body, or some of its parts, are visibly transferred from one  place to another; the other, internal and concealed, of some of which  man is sensible, while some takes place without his knowledge, and is  not even to be guessed at, but by the effect it outwardly produces. In a  machine so extremely complex as man, formed by the combination of such  a multiplicity of matter, so diversified in its properties, so different  in its proportions, so varied in its modes of action, the motion  necessarily becomes of the most complicated kind; its dullness, as well  as its rapidity, frequently escapes the observation of those themselves,  in whom it takes place.    Let us not, then, be surprised, if, when man would account to himself  for his existence, for his manner of acting, finding so many obstacles  to encounter, he invented such strange hypotheses to explain the  concealed spring of his machine--if then this motion appeared to him,  to be different from that of other bodies, he conceived an idea, that he  moved and acted in a manner altogether distinct from the other beings in  Nature. He clearly perceived that his body, as well as different parts  of it, did act; but, frequently, he was unable to discover what  brought them into action: from whence he received the impulse: he then  conjectured he contained within himself a moving principle distinguished  from his machine, which secretly gave an impulse to the springs which  set this machine in motion; that moved him by its own natural energy;  that consequently he acted according to laws totally distinct from those  which regulated the motion of other beings: he was conscious of certain  internal motion, which he could not help feeling; but how could he  conceive, that this invisible motion was so frequently competent to  produce such striking effects? How could he comprehend, that a fugitive  idea, an imperceptible act of thought, was so frequently capacitated  to bring his whole being into trouble and confusion? He fell into the  belief, that he perceived within himself a substance distinguished from  that self, endowed with a secret force; in which he supposed existed  qualities distinctly differing from those, of either the visible  causes that acted on his organs,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8910"],[0,"The System of Nature, or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World. Volume 2 (#16)"],[1,"beings are jealous of their prerogatives. Jealousy is  another human passion, not always of the most respectable kind: but it  is rather difficult to conceive the existence of jealousy with profound  wisdom, unlimited power, and the perfection of justice. Thus the  theologians by dint of heaping quality on quality, aggrandizing each as  is added, seem to have reduced themselves to the situation of a painter,  who spreading all his colours upon his canvas together, after thus  blending them into an unique mass, loses sight of the whole in the  composition.    They will, nevertheless, reply to these difficulties, that goodness,  wisdom, justice, are in these beings qualities so pre-eminent, so  distinct, have so little affinity with these same qualities in man, that  they are totally dissimilar--have not the least relation. Admit this  to be the case, How then can he form to himself any idea of these  perfections, seeing they are totally unlike those with which he is  acquainted? They surely cannot mean to insinuate that they are the  reverse of every thing he understands; because that would, in effect,  bring them to a precise point which would not need any explanation;  it is therefore a matter of certainty this cannot be the case: then if  these qualities, when exercised by the beings they have described, are  only human actions so obscured, so hidden, as not to be recognizable by  man, How can weak mortals pretend to announce them, to have a knowledge  of them, to explain them to others? Does then theology impart to the  mind the ineffable boon of enabling it to conceive that which no man is  competent to understand? Does it procure for its agents the marvellous  faculty of having distinct ideas of beings composed of so many  contradictory properties? Does it, in fact, make the theologian himself  one of these incomprehensible beings.    They will impose silence, by saying the oracles have spoken; that  through these mystical means they have made themselves known to mortals.  The next question would naturally be, When, where, or to whom have  these oracles spoken? Where are these oracles? An hundred voices raise  themselves in the same moment; hands of Briaraeus are immediately  stretched forth to shew them in a number of discordant collections,  which each maintains, with an equal degree of vehemence, is the true  code--the only doctrine man ought to believe: he runs them over, finds  they scarcely agree in any one particular; but that in all the heaviest  penalties are denounced against those who doubt the smallest part of  any one of them. These beings of consummate wisdom are made to speak an  obscure, irrational language; some of them, although their goodness  is proclaimed, have been cruel and sanguinary; others, although their  justice is held forth, have been partial, unjust, capricious; some, who  are represented as all merciful, destine to the most hideous punishments  the unhappy victims to their wrath: examine any one of them more  closely, he will find that they have never in any two countries held  literally the same language: that although they are said to have spoken  in many places, that they have always spoken variously: What is the  necessary result? The human mind, incapable of reconciling such manifest  contradictions, unable to obtain from their ministers any corroborative  evidence, that is not disputed by the others, falls into the strangest  perplexity; is involved in doubts, entangled in a labyrinth to which no  clue is to be found.    Thus the relations, which are supposed to exist between man and these  theological idols, can only be founded on the moral qualities of these  beings: if these are not known to him, if he cannot in any manner  comprehend them, they cannot by any ingenuity of argument serve him for  models. In order that they may be imitated, it is needful that these  qualities were cognizable by the being who is to imitate them. How  can he imitate that goodness, that justice, that mercy, which does not  resemble either his own, or any thing he can conceive? If these beings  partake in nothing of that which forms man--if the properties they  do possess, although different, are not within the reach of his  comprehension--if, he cannot embrace the most distant idea of them,  which the theologian assures him he cannot, How is it possible he  can set about imitating them? How follow a conduct suitable to please  them--to render himself acceptable in their sight? What can in effect  be the motive of that worship, of that homage, of that obedience, which  these beings are said to exact--which he is informed he should offer  at their altars, if he does not establish it upon their goodness--their  veracity--their justice: in short, upon qualities which he is competent  to understand? How can he have clear, distinct ideas of those qualities,  if they are no longer of the same nature as those which he has learned  to reverence in the beings of his own species?    To this they will reply, because none of them ever admit the least doubt  of the rectitude of their own individual creed, that there can be no  proportion between these idols and mortals, who are the work of their  hands; that it is not permitted to the clay to demand of the potter who  has formed it, \"why ye have fashioned me thus;\"--but if there can be  no common measure between the workman and his work--if there can be  no analogy between them, because the one is immaterial, the other  corporeal, How do they reciprocally act upon each other? How can the  gross organs of the one, comprehend the subtile quality of the other?  Reasoning in the only way he is capable, and it surely will never be  seriously argued that he is not to reason, will he not perceive that  the earthen vase could only have received the form which it pleased the  potter to give; that if it is formed badly, if it is rendered inadequate  to the use for which it was designed, the vase is not in this instance  to be blamed; the potter certainly has the power to break it; the vase  cannot prevent him; it will neither have motives nor means to soften his  anger; it will be obliged to submit to its destiny; but he will not  be able to prevent his mind from thinking the potter harsh in thus  punishing the vase, rather than by forming it anew, by giving it another  figure, render it competent to the purposes he intended.    According to these notions the relations between man and these  theological beings have no existence, they owe nothing to him, are  dispensed from shewing him either goodness or justice; that man, on  the contrary, owes them every thing: but contradictions appear at every  step. If these have promised by their oracles any thing to man, it is  rather difficult for him to believe, that what is so solemnly promised  does not belong to him if he fulfils the condition of the promise.  The difference a theologian may choose to find in these relations will  hardly be convincing to a reasonable mind. The duties of man towards  these beings can, according to their own shewing, have no other  foundation than the happiness he expects from them: thus the relation  has a reciprocity, it is founded upon their goodness, upon their  justice, it demands obedience on his part, a conduct suitable to the  benefits he receives. Thus, in whatever manner the theological system  is viewed, it destroys itself. Will theology never feel that the more  it endeavours to exaggerate the human qualities, the less it exalts the  beings it pictures; the more incomprehensible it renders them, the more  it contributes to swell its own ocean of contradictions; that to take  human passions, mortal faculties at all, is perhaps the worst means it  can pursue to form a perfect being; but that if it must persist in this  method, then the further they remove them from man, the more they debase  him, the more they weaken the relations subsisting between them: that  in thus aggregating human properties, it should carefully abstain from  associating in these pictures those qualities which man finds detestable  in his fellows. Thus, despotism in man is looked upon as an unjust,  unreasonable power; if it introduces such a quality into its portraits,  it cannot rationally suppose them suitable to cultivate the esteem, to  attract the voluntary homage of the human race: if, however, the canvas  be examined, we shall frequently be struck, with perceiving this the  leading feature; we shall equally find a want of keeping through the  whole; that shadows are introduced, where lights ought to prevail; that  the colouring is incongruous--the design without harmony.    The discrepancy of conduct which theology imputes to these idols, is not  less remarkable than the contrariety of qualities it ascribes to  them, or the inconsistency of the passions with which it invests them;  sometimes, according to this, they are the friends to reason, desirous  of the happiness of society; sometimes they are inimical to virtue;  interdict the use of reason; flattered with seeing society disturbed,  they sometimes afflict man without his being able to guess the cause of  their displeasure; sometimes they are favourable to mankind--at others,  indisposed towards the human species: sometimes they are represented as  permitting crimes for the pleasure of punishing them--at others, they  exert all their power to arrest crime in its birth; sometimes they elect  a small number to receive eternal happiness, predestinating the rest to  perpetual misery--to everlasting torments; at others, they throw open  the gates of mercy to all who choose to enter them; sometimes they are  pourtrayed as destroying the universe--at others, as establishing the  most beautiful order in the planet we inhabit; sometimes they are held  forth as countenancing deception--at others, as having the highest  reverence for truth--as holding deceit in abomination. This, again, is  the necessary result of the human faculties, the"]]]
