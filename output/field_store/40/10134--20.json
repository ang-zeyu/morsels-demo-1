He was so surprised that he scarcely trusted  his senses, and asked her not less than three times, that he might not  be mistaken. As he preached that day, God seemed 'a very present help.'  At the close of the service, a young man, noted for his free-hearted,  impulsive character, stepped up and requested that he would perform a  marriage ceremony for him the next week. He did so, and received for his  services a bill, which he placed in his pocket, and, on looking at it  afterwards, found it _fifty dollars_, thus making up _exactly the  eighty_ he had prayed the Lord to send him.\"    We too often forget that God is as willing to listen to our temporal  wants as to our spiritual, and that \"no good thing will He withhold from  them that walk uprightly.\"      A PRAYER FOR FOUR DOLLARS.      A Home Missionary from Brooklyn called one day upon an editor to gather  some tracts for distribution which he had published. The editor became  interested in the story of his visits among the poor, and though at  first not specially moved to give money at that time, yet toward the  last, putting his hand into his pocket he pulled out all the bills there  were there, $4, and gave them to the missionary with these words: \"There  is something which may come useful.\" The gift was all forgotten until a  few days afterward the missionary returned and said to the editor,  \"After I left you I received a letter from a poor lady who had been  owing money for rent for several months, which she could not possibly  pay. That very morning the landlord came and said that if she could only  raise $4 he would excuse the rest; but she did not have the $4. I did  not know where to get it. I happened to drop in to see you; did not tell  you anything of the need, and asked for nothing; yet you gave me the  exact $4 to answer that poor woman's prayer.\"    An infinite Creator and God had brought these circumstances together in  this exact way. Neither the editor nor missionary had ever met before.  The missionary did not know that the lady was in distress. Who was it  that sent the landlord to the lady and fixed that amount of $4 in his  mind? Who was it that sent the home missionary to the office of a person  he had never seen or known? Who was it that knew of the $4 waiting in  that pocket and prompted that hand to take it out and give it away? Who  was it that led that missionary to obtain and send relief just as she  was praying for that special amount?    _Was it chance or science? No, No. It was the will of a loving God_.      \"AUNT SALLY'S\" FAITH.      \"'Aunt Sally,' says the _American Messenger_, was a devout, working,  trustful Christian. Her husband was a cripple, almost helpless, an  unbeliever, and to some extent an opposer of religion. They lived alone.  The severity of a northern winter was upon them, and in spite of her  best exertions their stock of fuel was scarcely a day's supply.    \"'What can be done?' was the anxious inquiry of the unbelieving husband  as they were rising from their bed. 'The Lord will provide,' was 'Aunt  Sally's' cheerful reply. 'I know you always say so, and so it has always  proved,' was the answer of her unbelieving companion; 'but I see no way  in which we can be provided for now.' 'Nor do I,' said 'Aunt Sally.'  'But help will come. God will not desert us.'    \"That winter's morning had not passed when their son, who had been a  soldier in the Mexican war, entered the door. It had been long since  they had heard from him, and they feared he was not alive. The sun went  down upon an abundant supply of fuel, cut in the forest by the strong  arms of the soldier-boy, and drawn to the door by means of his  procuring. The unbelieving husband and father declared he would never be  distrustful again.      GOD CARETH FOR YOU.      \"Nearly forty years ago I was given up by the doctors for a dying man  from consumption. I had a wife and five children dependent on me, and  for many months was unable to provide for them by my own labors. All our  earthly resources were gone, and one Sabbath morning, when breakfast was  over, we were entirely destitute; there was no meal in the barrel nor  oil in the cruse. In family worship I read the fortieth chapter of  Isaiah. I think up to that time I had never found the word of God so  sweet and precious. I had very near access in prayer, and was enabled to  lay my burden at the Saviour's feet. I closed with the Lord's Prayer; it  seemed made on purpose for me. I think the petition, 'Give us this day  our daily bread,' was offered in faith.    \"_Within an hour there was a rap at the door_. When I opened it a young  man stood there who had come three miles to bring us bread, sugar, and  money. He apologized for coming on the Sabbath morning, but said an aunt  of his was at their house the evening before, and felt so anxious about  us she could not go away till he promised her he would come and bring us  those things.\"      A PRAYER NOT ANSWERED.      \"Many years ago, a man then recently married, settled in my native town.  It was then quite new, destitute of religious privileges, and given to  all manner of wickedness. There was no Sabbath, and no sanctuary. The  man was pious. The thought of bringing up a family in such a place  distressed him. He wished to remove; and he used to retire daily to a  little grove, and _pray that God would send some one to buy his farm_.  This prayer was not answered. Better things were in store. A neighbor  was taken sick. He visited and conversed with him. In the midst of the  conversation, one sitting by interrupted him and said, 'Sir, if what you  say is true, I am lost.' This gave new interest to the occasion. Prayer  was offered, the Spirit was found out, and many were converted. A  prayer-meeting was started; other revivals followed; in due time a  church was organized, a house of worship built, and a pastor settled,  mainly through the instrumentality of that one man; and he trained up  his family there, and lived to see most of them members of the church of  Christ. Do not despair, God will _either answer your exact prayer,_ or  _do something better for you_; He knows what is for your best good.\"      TRUST IN THE LORD.      \"A pious woman, who was reduced to extreme poverty and deserted by her  intemperate husband, was taken sick, and lay several days without  physical power to provide food for her two little children. She had  directed them where to find the little that was remaining in the house,  and they had eaten it all. Still she lay sick, with no means of  obtaining more, as night closed upon the hungry household. The children  soon forgot their hunger in sleep; but not so the mother. She saw no  help for them but in God, and she spent the night-watches in spreading  before him their necessities. As the morning approached her confidence  in God increased, and that passage from his word rested with peculiar  sweetness upon her mind, 'Trust in the Lord and do good; so shalt thou  dwell in the land, and _verily thou shalt be fed_.'    \"Morning came. The starving children managed by her direction to build  them a little fire, and almost before they had commenced telling their  mother of their hunger, a stranger came in. She introduced herself as  Mrs. J., saying she had known for some time that there was a new family  in the neighborhood, and intended to call and make their acquaintance,  but had been prevented. _During the last night she had been so troubled  and disturbed about it_, that she thought she would run in early, lest  she should again be prevented, and see if there was any way in which she  could be of service to them. The mother in bed, with her head bound to  mitigate its pain, revealed the story of her sufferings, and the good  lady soon learned their entire destitution. They were immediately made  comfortable; and all will be glad to know that it was the beginning of  better days to that deserted wife and mother.\"      THE NECESSITY OF ASKING GOD'S BLESSING EVERY DAY, UPON YOUR DAILY WORK.  EVERY WORK, HOWEVER GOOD, NEEDS SPECIAL, SPECIFIC, DAILY PRAYER FOR ITS  PROSPERITY.      \"A colporteur in the Wabash valley became quite discouraged and was  almost ready to give up his work, on account of the smallness of his  sales. On every side, his ears were filled with complaints of 'hard  times;' the wheat crop had partially failed two years in succession--the  California emigration, and railroad and plank-road speculations had  almost drained the country of money. Frequently he would be told, that  if he could come after harvest they would buy his books, but that it was  impossible to do so then. His sales were daily decreasing, and he became  more and more disheartened, until one night, after a laborious day's  effort, he found that he had _only sold twenty-five cents' worth_! He  felt that he could not go on in this way any longer. He was wasting his  strength and time, and the money of the Society. On examination of the  state of his heart, he found that it had, gradually and almost  unconsciously, grown cold and departed far from Christ. He felt that he  had not prayed as he ought to have done, especially _he had neglected  each morning, and on his approach to each dwelling, to pray that then  and there God would guide him, and own and bless his efforts to sell  books._ He saw that probably here was at least a part of the cause why  his sales had become so small. Early the next morning, before any of the  family were up, he arose and retired to the adjoining woods, where he  had a long and precious season of communion with God. There he anew  dedicated himself and his all to the service of Christ. There, as under  the eye of the Master, he reviewed the time he had labored as a  colporteur, and prayed for forgiveness for the past and grace for the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11565"],[0,"Friends, though divided: A Tale of the Civil War (#17)"],[1,"   As Harry rode on by the side of Herbert a Royalist officer, one Sir  Ralph Willoughby, dashed up.    \"What means this?\" he exclaimed. \"Do I see an officer of his majesty  riding with one of the Roundheads? This is treason and treachery!\"    \"I will answer to the king, if need be,\" Harry said, \"for my conduct. I  am not under your orders, Sir Ralph, and shall use my discretion in this  matter. This gentleman is as a brother to me.\"    \"And I would cut down my brother,\" Sir Ralph said furiously, \"if I found  him in the ranks of the enemy!\"    \"Then, sir, we differ,\" Harry replied, \"for that would not I. There are  your friends,\" he said to Herbert, pointing to a body of Roundheads at a  short distance, \"Give me your word, however, that you will not draw  sword again to-day.\"    Herbert readily gave the required promise, and riding off, was soon  with his friends. Sir Ralph and Harry came to high words after he had  left; and the matter might then and there have been decided by the  sword, had not a party of Roundheads, seeing two cavalry officers so  near to them, charged down, and compelled them to ride for their lives.    The following day Sir Ralph reported the circumstance to the general,  and he to Prince Rupert. The prince laughed at the charge.    \"Harry Furness,\" he said, \"is as loyal a gentleman as draws sword in our  ranks, and as he and I have been well-nigh roasted together, it were  vain indeed that any complaint were made to me touching his honor. I  will speak to him, however, and doubt not that his explanation will be  satisfactory.\"    The prince accordingly spoke to Harry, who explained the circumstances  of his relations with the young Roundhead.    \"Had he been a great captain, sir,\" Harry said, \"I might have deemed it  my duty to hold him in durance, however near his relationship to myself.  But as a few weeks since he was but a schoolboy, methought that the  addition of his sword to the Roundhead cause would make no great  difference in our chances of victory that afternoon. Moreover, I had  received his pledge that he would not draw sword again in the battle.\"    As even yet, although the bitterness was quickly increasing, it was far  from having reached that point which it subsequently attained, and  prisoners on both sides were treated with respect, no more was said  regarding Harry's conduct in allowing his friend to escape. But from  that moment, between himself and Sir Ralph Willoughby there grew up a  strong feeling of animosity, which only needed some fitting pretext to  break out.    It was, indeed, an unfortunate point in the royal cause, that there was  very far from being unity among those who fought side by side. There  were intrigues and jealousies. There were the king's men, who would have  supported his majesty in all lengths to which he might have gone, and  who were ever advising him to resist all attempts at pacification, and  to be content with nothing less than a complete defeat of his enemies.  Upon the other hand, there were the grave, serious men, who had drawn  the sword with intense reluctance, and who desired nothing so much as  peace--a peace which would secure alike the rights of the crown and the  rights of the people.    They were shocked, too, by the riotous and profligate ways of some of  the wilder spirits, and deemed that their cause was sullied by the  reckless conduct and wild ways of many of their party. Sir Henry Furness  belonged to this section of the king's adherents, and Harry, who had  naturally imbibed his father's opinions, held himself a good deal aloof  from the wild young spirits of the king's party.    Skirmishes took place daily between the cavalry outposts of the two  armies. Sir Henry was asked by the prince to send some of his troops  across the river to watch the enemy, and he chose that commanded by  Harry, rather for the sake of getting the lad away from the temptations  and dissipation of Oxford than to give him an opportunity of  distinguishing himself. The troop commanded by Sir Ralph Willoughby was  also on outpost duty, and lay at no great distance from the village in  which Harry quartered his men after crossing the river. The Roundhead  cavalry were known to be but three or four miles away, and the utmost  vigilance was necessary.    Harry gave orders that the troops should be distributed through the  village--five men to a house. Straw was to be brought in at night, and  laid on the floor of the kitchens, and the men were there to sleep, with  their arms by their sides, ready for instant service. One of each party  was to stand sentry over the five horses which were to be picketed to  the palings in front of the house. At the first alarm he was at once to  awake his comrades, who were to mount instantly, and form in column in  the street. Two pickets were placed three hundred yards from the  village, and two others a quarter of a mile further in advance. Harry  and Jacob took up their residence in the village inn, and arranged  alternately to visit the pickets and sentries every two hours.    \"They shall not catch us napping, Jacob. This is my first command on  detached duty. You and I have often remarked upon the reckless ways of  our leaders. We have an opportunity now of carrying our own ideas into  effect.\"    At three o'clock Jacob visited the outposts. All was still, and nothing  had occurred to give rise to any suspicion of the vicinity of an enemy.  Half an hour later one of the advanced pickets galloped in. They heard,  he said, a noise as of a large body of horse, away to the right, and it  seemed as if it was proceeding toward Chalcombe, the village where Sir  Ralph Willoughby's troop was quartered. Two minutes later, thanks to  Harry's arrangements, the troop were mounted and in readiness for  action.    The first faint dawn of day had begun. Suddenly the stillness was broken  by the sound of pistol shots and shouts from the direction of Chalcombe,  which lay a mile away.    \"It is likely,\" Harry said, \"that Sir Ralph has been caught napping. He  is brave, but he is reckless, and the discipline of his troop is of the  slackest. Let us ride to his rescue.\"    The troop filed out from the village, and turned down the side road  leading to Chalcombe. Harry set spurs to his horse and led the column at  a gallop. The sound of shots continued without intermission, and  presently a bright light shot up.    \"Methinks,\" Harry said to Jacob, \"the Roundheads have caught our men  asleep, and it is an attack upon the houses rather than a cavalry  fight.\"    It was scarcely five minutes from the time they started when they  approached the village. By the light of a house which had been set on  fire, Harry saw that his conjecture was well founded. The Roundheads  were dismounted, and were attacking the houses.    Halting just outside the village, Harry formed his men with a front  across the whole road, and directed the lines to advance, twenty yards  apart. Then, placing himself at their head, he gave the word, and  charged down the street upon the Roundheads. The latter, occupied by  their attack upon the houses, were unconscious of the presence of their  foe until he was close upon them, and were taken utterly by surprise.  The force of the charge was irresistible, and the Roundheads, dispersed  and on foot, were cut down in all directions. Groups of twos and threes  stood together and attempted resistance, but the main body thought only  of regaining their horses. In three minutes after the Royalists entered  the village the surviving Roundheads were in full flight, hotly pursued  by the victorious Cavaliers. These, being for the most part better  mounted, overtook and slew many of the Roundheads, and not more than  half the force which had set out returned to their quarters at Didcot.  The pursuit continued to within half a mile of that place, and then  Harry, knowing that there was a force of Roundhead infantry there, drew  off from the pursuit, and returned to Chalcombe. He found that more  than half of Sir Ralph Willoughy's men had been killed, many having been  cut down before they could betake themselves to their arms, those  quartered in the inn, and at two or three of the larger houses, having  alone maintained a successful resistance until the arrival of succor.    Sir Ralph Willoughby was furious. The disaster was due to his own  carelessness in having contented himself with placing two pickets in  advance of the village, and permitting the whole remainder of his force  to retire to bed. Consequently the picket, on riding in upon the  approach of the enemy, were unable to awake and call them to arms before  the Roundheads were upon them. In his anger he turned upon Harry, and  fiercely demanded why he had not sent him news of the approach of the  enemy.    \"You must have known it,\" he said. \"Your men were all mounted and in  readiness, or they could not have arrived here so soon. You must have  been close at hand, and only holding off in order that you might boast  of having come to my relief.\"    Harry, indignant at these words, turned on heel without deigning to give  an answer to the angry man, and at once rode back to his own quarters.  Two hours later Prince Rupert rode up. The firing had been reported, and  Prince Rupert had ridden with a body of horse to Chalcombe. Here he had  heard Sir Ralph Willoughby's version of the story, and had requested  that officer to ride with him to Harry's quarters. The prince, with  several of his principal officers, alighted at the inn, outside which  Harry received him. Prince Rupert led the way into the house.    \"Master Furness,\" he said, \"Sir Ralph Willoughby accuses you of having  played him false, and left his party to be destroyed on account of the  quarrel existing between you, touching that affair at Newbury. What  have you to say to this? He alleges that you must have been close at  hand, and moved not a finger to save him until half his troop was  destroyed.\"   "]]]
