Justice remains the appropriate name for certain social  utilities which are vastly more important, and therefore more absolute  and imperative, than any others are as a class (though not more so than  others may be in particular cases); and which, therefore, ought to be,  as well as naturally are, guarded by a sentiment not only different in  degree, but also in kind; distinguished from the milder feeling which  attaches to the mere idea of promoting human pleasure or convenience, at  once by the more definite nature of its commands, and by the sterner  character of its sanctions.      THE END.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote C: See this point enforced and illustrated by Professor Bain,  in an admirable chapter (entitled \"The Ethical Emotions, or the Moral  Sense\") of the second of the two treatises composing his elaborate and  profound work on the Mind.]    [Footnote D: This implication, in the first principle of the utilitarian  scheme, of perfect impartiality between persons, is regarded by Mr.  Herbert Spencer (in his _Social Statics_) as a disproof of the  pretentions of utility to be a sufficient guide to right; since (he  says) the principle of utility presupposes the anterior principle, that  everybody has an equal right to happiness. It may be more correctly  described as supposing that equal amounts of happiness are equally  desirable, whether felt by the same or by different persons. This,  however, is not a pre-supposition; not a premise needful to support the  principle of utility, but the very principle itself; for what is the  principle of utility, if it be not that 'happiness' and 'desirable' are  synonymous terms? If there is any anterior principle implied, it can be  no other than this, that the truths of arithmetic are applicable to the  valuation of happiness, as of all other measurable quantities.    [Mr. Herbert Spencer, in a private communication on the subject of the  preceding Note, objects to being considered an opponent of  Utilitarianism; and states that he regards happiness as the ultimate end  of morality; but deems that end only partially attainable by empirical  generalizations from the observed results of conduct, and completely  attainable only by deducing, from the laws of life and the conditions of  existence, what kinds of action necessarily tend to produce happiness,  and what kinds to produce unhappiness. With the exception of the word  \"necessarily,\" I have no dissent to express from this doctrine; and  (omitting that word) I am not aware that any modern advocate of  utilitarianism is of a different opinion. Bentham, certainly, to whom in  the _Social Statics_ Mr. Spencer particularly referred, is, least of all  writers, chargeable with unwillingness to deduce the effect of actions  on happiness from the laws of human nature and the universal conditions  of human life. The common charge against him is of relying too  exclusively upon such deductions, and declining altogether to be bound  by the generalizations from specific experience which Mr. Spencer thinks  that utilitarians generally confine themselves to. My own opinion (and,  as I collect, Mr. Spencer's) is, that in ethics, as in all other  branches of scientific study, the consilience of the results of both  these processes, each corroborating and verifying the other, is  requisite to give to any general proposition the kind and degree of  evidence which constitutes scientific proof.]]"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11242"],[0,"The Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti (#17)"],[1,"upon. Had he been other than he  was--a gregarious man, contented with the _a peu pres_ in art--he  might have sent out all those twelve Apostles for the Duomo from his  workshop. Raffaello would have done so; indeed, the work which bears  his name in Rome could not have existed except under these conditions.  Now nothing is left to us of the twelve Apostles except a rough-hewn  sketch of S. Matthew. Michelangelo was unwilling or unable to organise  a band of craftsmen fairly interpretative of his manner. When his own  hand failed, or when he lost the passion for his labour, he left the  thing unfinished. And much of this incompleteness in his life-work  seems to me due to his being what I called a dreamer. He lacked the  merely business faculty, the power of utilising hands and brains. He  could not bring his genius into open market, and stamp inferior  productions with his countersign. Willingly he retired into the  solitude of his own self, to commune with great poets and to meditate  upon high thoughts, while he indulged the emotions arising from forms  of strength and beauty presented to his gaze upon the pathway of  experience.        CHAPTER IV    I    Among the many nephews whom Sixtus IV. had raised to eminence, the  most distinguished was Giuliano della Rovere, Cardinal of S. Pietro in  Vincoli, and Bishop of Ostia. This man possessed a fiery temper,  indomitable energy, and the combative instinct which takes delight in  fighting for its own sake. Nature intended him for a warrior; and,  though circumstances made him chief of the Church, he discharged his  duties as a Pontiff in the spirit of a general and a conqueror. When  Julius II. was elected in November 1503, it became at once apparent  that he intended to complete what his hated predecessors, the Borgias,  had begun, by reducing to his sway all the provinces over which the  See of Rome had any claims, and creating a central power in Italy.  Unlike the Borgias, however, he entertained no plan of raising his own  family to sovereignty at the expense of the Papal power. The Della  Roveres were to be contented with their Duchy of Urbino, which came to  them by inheritance from the Montefeltri. Julius dreamed of Italy for  the Italians, united under the hegemony of the Supreme Pontiff, who  from Rome extended his spiritual authority and political influence  over the whole of Western Europe. It does not enter into the scheme of  this book to relate the series of wars and alliances in which this  belligerent Pope involved his country, and the final failure of his  policy, so far as the liberation of Italy from the barbarians was  concerned. Suffice it to say, that at the close of his stormy reign he  had reduced the States of the Church to more or less complete  obedience, bequeathing to his successors an ecclesiastical kingdom  which the enfeebled condition of the peninsula at large enabled them  to keep intact.    There was nothing petty or mean in Julius II.; his very faults bore a  grandiose and heroic aspect. Turbulent, impatient, inordinate in his  ambition, reckless in his choice of means, prolific of immense  projects, for which a lifetime would have been too short, he filled  the ten years of his pontificate with a din of incoherent deeds and  vast schemes half accomplished. Such was the man who called  Michelangelo to Rome at the commencement of 1505. Why the sculptor was  willing to leave his Cartoon unfinished, and to break his engagement  with the Operai del Duomo, remains a mystery. It is said that the  illustrious architect, Giuliano da San Gallo, who had worked for  Julius while he was cardinal, and was now his principal adviser upon  matters of art, suggested to the Pope that Buonarroti could serve him  admirably in his ambitious enterprises for the embellishment of the  Eternal City. We do not know for certain whether Julius, when he  summoned Michelangelo from Florence, had formed the design of engaging  him upon a definite piece of work. The first weeks of his residence in  Rome are said to have been spent in inactivity, until at last Julius  proposed to erect a huge monument of marble for his own tomb.    Thus began the second and longest period of Michelangelo's  art-industry. Henceforth he was destined to labour for a series of  Popes, following their whims with distracted energies and a lamentable  waste of time. The incompleteness which marks so much of his  performance was due to the rapid succession of these imperious  masters, each in turn careless about the schemes of his predecessor,  and bent on using the artist's genius for his own profit. It is true  that nowhere but in Rome could Michelangelo have received commissions  on so vast a scale. Nevertheless we cannot but regret the fate which  drove him to consume years of hampered industry upon what Condivi  calls \"the tragedy of Julius's tomb,\" upon quarrying and road-making  for Leo X., upon the abortive plans at S. Lorenzo, and upon  architectural and engineering works, which were not strictly within  his province. At first it seemed as though fortune was about to smile  on him. In Julius he found a patron who could understand and  appreciate his powers. Between the two men there existed a strong bond  of sympathy due to community of temperament. Both aimed at colossal  achievements in their respective fields of action. The imagination of  both was fired by large and simple rather than luxurious and subtle  thoughts. Both were _uomini terribili_, to use a phrase denoting  vigour of character and energy of genius, made formidable by an  abrupt, uncompromising spirit. Both worked with what the Italians call  fury, with the impetuosity of daemonic natures; and both left the  impress of their individuality stamped indelibly upon their age.  Julius, in all things grandiose, resolved to signalise his reign by  great buildings, great sculpture, great pictorial schemes. There was  nothing of the dilettante and collector about him. He wanted creation  at a rapid rate and in enormous quantities. To indulge this craving,  he gathered round him a band of demigods and Titans, led by Bramante,  Raffaello, Michelangelo, and enjoyed the spectacle of a new world of  art arising at his bidding through their industry of brain and hand.      II    What followed upon Michelangelo's arrival in Rome may be told in  Condivi's words: \"Having reached Rome, many months elapsed before  Julius decided on what great work he would employ him. At last it  occurred to him to use his genius in the construction of his own tomb.  The design furnished by Michelangelo pleased the Pope so much that he  sent him off immediately to Carrara, with commission to quarry as much  marble as was needful for that undertaking. Two thousand ducats were  put to his credit with Alamanni Salviati at Florence for expenses. He  remained more than eight months among those mountains, with two  servants and a horse, but without any salary except his keep. One day,  while inspecting the locality, the fancy took him to convert a hill  which commands the sea-shore into a Colossus, visible by mariners  afar. The shape of the huge rock, which lent itself admirably to such  a purpose, attracted him; and he was further moved to emulate the  ancients, who, sojourning in the place peradventure with the same  object as himself, in order to while away the time, or for some other  motive, have left certain unfinished and rough-hewn monuments, which  give a good specimen of their craft. And assuredly he would have  carried out this scheme, if time enough had been at his disposal, or  if the special purpose of his visit to Carrara had permitted. I one  day heard him lament bitterly that he had not done so. Well, then,  after quarrying and selecting the blocks which he deemed sufficient,  he had them brought to the sea, and left a man of his to ship them  off. He returned to Rome, and having stopped some days in Florence on  the way, when he arrived there, he found that part of the marble had  already reached the Ripa. There he had them disembarked, and carried  to the Piazza of S. Peter's behind S. Caterina, where he kept his  lodging, close to the corridor connecting the Palace with the Castle  of S. Angelo. The quantity of stone was enormous, so that, when it was  all spread out upon the square, it stirred amazement in the minds of  most folk, but joy in the Pope's. Julius indeed began to heap favours  upon Michelangelo; for when he had begun to work, the Pope used  frequently to betake himself to his house, conversing there with him  about the tomb, and about other works which he proposed to carry out  in concert with one of his brothers. In order to arrive more  conveniently at Michelangelo's lodgings, he had a drawbridge thrown  across from the corridor, by which he might gain privy access.\"    The date of Michelangelo's return to Rome is fixed approximately by a  contract signed at Carrara between him and two shipowners of Lavagna.  This deed is dated November 12, 1505. It shows that thirty-four  cartloads of marble were then ready for shipment, together with two  figures weighing fifteen cartloads more. We have a right to assume  that Michelangelo left Carrara soon after completing this transaction.  Allowing, then, for the journey and the halt at Florence, he probably  reached Rome in the last week of that month.      III    The first act in the tragedy of the sepulchre had now begun, and  Michelangelo was embarked upon one of the mightiest undertakings which  a sovereign of the stamp of Julius ever intrusted to a sculptor of his  titanic energy. In order to form a conception of the magnitude of the  enterprise, I am forced to enter into a discussion regarding the real  nature of the monument. This offers innumerable difficulties, for we  only possess imperfect notices regarding the original design, and two  doubtful drawings belonging to an uncertain period. Still it is  impossible to understand those changes in the Basilica of "]]]
