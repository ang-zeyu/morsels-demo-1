A _species_, or kind, is in botany the unit of classification. It embraces  all such individuals as may have originated in a common stock. Such  individuals bear an essential resemblance to each other, as well as to  their common parent in all their parts. E.g., the Cinnamon fern is a kind  or species of fern with the fronds evidently of one kind, and of a common  origin, and all producing individuals of their own kind by their spores or  rootstocks. When such individuals differ perceptibly from the type in the  shape of the pinnae, or the cutting of the fronds, we have _varieties_ as  _frondosum_, _incisum_, etc. Or if the difference is less striking the  word _form_ is used instead of variety, but in any given case opinions may  differ in respect to the more fitting term.    A _genus_ is an assemblage of species closely related to each other, and  having more points of resemblance than of difference; e.g., the royal fern,  the cinnamon fern, and the interrupted fern are alike in having similar  spore cases borne in a somewhat similar manner on the fronds, and forming  the genus _Osmunda_. In like manner certain members of the clover  group--red, white, yellow, etc., make up the genus _Trifolium_.    Thus individuals are grouped into species and species are associated into  genera, and the two groups are united to give each fern or plant its true  name, the generic name being qualified by that of the species; as in the  cinnamon fern _Osmunda_ (genus), _cinnamomea_ (species).

THE PETRIFIED FERN      In a valley, centuries ago,    Grew a little fern-leaf green and slender,    Veining delicate and fibers tender,    Waving when the wind crept down so low;    Rushes tall and moss and grass grew round it,    Playful sunbeams darted in and found it,    Drops of dew stole down by night and crowned it.    But no foot of man e'er came that way--    Earth was young and keeping holiday.      Monster fishes swam the silent main,    Stately forests waved their giant branches,    Mountains hurled their snowy avalanches,    Mammoth creatures stalked across the plain,    Nature reveled in grand mysteries;    But the little fern was not of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11366"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 02 (#17)"],[1,"in conversation; but this was a thing which  weighed so heavily on his heart, and the difficulties which he found in  getting separated from his wife were so great that it had made him  bitter against everything which concerned the marriage bond--that very  bond which, notwithstanding, he was so anxiously desiring between  himself and the Baroness.    \"The same friend,\" he went on, \"has another law which he proposes. A  marriage shall be held indissoluble only when either both parties, or at  least one or the other, enter into it for the third time. Such persons  must be supposed to acknowledge beyond a doubt that they find marriage  indispensable for themselves; they have had opportunities of thoroughly  knowing themselves; of knowing how they conducted themselves in their  earlier unions; whether they have any peculiarities of temper, which are  a more frequent cause of separation than bad dispositions. People would  then observe each other more closely; they would pay as much attention  to the married as to the unmarried, no one being able to tell how things  may turn out.\"    \"That would add no little to the interest of society,\" said Edward. \"As  things are now, when a man is married nobody cares any more either for  his virtues or for his vices.\"    \"Under this arrangement,\" the Baroness struck in, laughing, \"our good  hosts have passed successfully over their two steps, and may make  themselves ready for their third.\"    \"Things have gone happily with them,\" said the Count. \"In their case  death has done with a good will what in others the consistorial courts  do with a very bad one.    \"Let the dead rest,\" said Charlotte, with a half serious look.    \"Why so,\" persevered the Count, \"when we can remember them with honor?  They were generous enough to content themselves with less than their  number of years for the sake of the larger good which they could leave  behind them.\"    \"Alas! that in such cases,\" said the Baroness, with a suppressed sigh,  \"happiness is bought only with the sacrifice of our fairest years.\"    \"Indeed, yes,\" answered the Count; \"and it might drive us to despair, if  it were not the same with everything in this world. Nothing goes as we  hope. Children do not fulfil what they promise; young people very  seldom; and if they keep their word, the world does not keep its word  with them.\"    Charlotte, who was delighted that the conversation had taken a turn at  last, replied cheerfully:    \"Well, then, we must content ourselves with enjoying what good we are to  have in fragments and pieces, as we can get it; and the sooner we can  accustom ourselves to this the better.\"    \"Certainly,\" the Count answered, \"you two have had the enjoyment of very  happy times. When I look back upon the years when you and Edward were  the loveliest couple at the court, I see nothing now to be compared with  those brilliant times, and such magnificent figures. When you two used  to dance together, all eyes were turned upon you, fastened upon you,  while you saw nothing but each other.\"    \"So much has changed since those days,\" said Charlotte, \"that we can  listen to such pretty things about ourselves without our modesty being  shocked at them.\"    \"I often privately found fault with Edward,\" said the Count, \"for not  being more firm. Those singular parents of his would certainly have  given way at last; and ten fair years is no trifle to gain.\"    \"I must take Edward's part,\" struck in the Baroness. \"Charlotte was not  altogether without fault--not altogether free from what we must call  prudential considerations; and although she had a real, hearty love for  Edward, and did in her secret soul intend to marry him, I can bear  witness how sorely she often tried him; and it was through this that he  was at last unluckily prevailed upon to leave her and go abroad, and try  to forget her.\"    Edward bowed to the Baroness, and seemed grateful for her advocacy.    \"And then I must add this,\" she continued, \"in excuse for Charlotte. The  man who was at that time suing for her, had for a long time given proofs  of his constant attachment to her; and, when one came to know him well,  was a far more lovable person than the rest of you may like to  acknowledge.\"    \"My dear friend,\" the Count replied, a little pointedly, \"confess, now,  that he was not altogether indifferent to yourself, and that Charlotte  had more to fear from you than from any other rival. I find it one of  the highest traits in women, that they continue so long in their regard  for a man, and that absence of no duration will serve to disturb or  remove it.\"    \"This fine feature, men possess, perhaps, even more,\" answered the  Baroness. \"At any rate, I have observed with you, my dear Count, that no  one has more influence over you than a lady to whom you were once  attached. I have seen you take more trouble to do things when a certain  person has asked you, than the friend of this moment would have obtained  of you, if she had tried.\"    \"Such a charge as that one must bear the best way one can,\" replied the  Count. \"But as to what concerns Charlotte's first husband, I could not  endure him, because he parted so sweet a pair from each other--a really  predestined pair, who, once brought together, have no reason to fear the  five years, or be thinking of a second or third marriage.\"    \"We must try,\" Charlotte said, \"to make up for what we then allowed to  slip from us.\"    \"Aye, and you must keep to that,\" said the Count; \"your first  marriages,\" he continued, with some vehemence, \"were exactly marriages  of the true detestable sort. And, unhappily, marriages generally, even  the best, have (forgive me for using a strong expression) something  awkward about them. They destroy the delicacy of the relation;  everything is made to rest on the broad certainty out of which one side  or other, at least, is too apt to make their own advantage. It is all a  matter of course; and they seem only to have got themselves tied  together, that one or the other, or both, may go their own way the more  easily.\"    At this moment, Charlotte, who was determined once for all that she  would put an end to the conversation, made a bold effort at turning it,  and succeeded. It then became more general. She and her husband and the  Captain were able to take a part in it. Even Ottilie had to give her  opinion; and the dessert was enjoyed in the happiest humor. It was  particularly beautiful, being composed almost entirely of the rich  summer fruits in elegant baskets, with epergnes of lovely flowers  arranged in exquisite taste.    The new laying-out of the park came to be spoken of; and immediately  after dinner they went to look at what was going on. Ottilie withdrew,  under pretence of having household matters to look to; in reality, it  was to set to work again at the transcribing. The Count fell into  conversation with the Captain, and Charlotte afterward joined them. When  they were at the summit of the height, the Captain good-naturedly ran  back to fetch the plan, and in his absence the Count said to Charlotte:    \"He is an exceedingly pleasing person. He is very well informed, and his  knowledge is always ready. His practical power, too, seems methodical  and vigorous. What he is doing here would be of great importance in some  higher sphere.\"    Charlotte listened to the Captain's praises with an inward delight. She  collected herself, however, and composedly and clearly confirmed what  the Count had said. But she was not a little startled when he continued:    \"This acquaintance falls most opportunely for me. I know of a situation  for which he is perfectly suited, and I shall be doing the greatest  favor to a friend of mine, a man of high rank, by recommending to him a  person who is so exactly everything which he desires.\"    Charlotte felt as if a thunder-stroke had fallen on her. The Count did  not observe it: women, being accustomed at all times to hold themselves  in restraint, are always able, even in the most extraordinary cases, to  maintain an apparent composure; but she heard not a word more of what  the Count said, though he went on speaking.    \"When I have made up my mind upon a thing,\" he added, \"I am quick about  it. I have put my letter together already in my head, and I shall write  it immediately. You can find me some messenger who can ride off with it  this evening.\"    Charlotte was suffering agonies. Startled with the proposal, and shocked  at herself, she was unable to utter a word. Happily, the Count continued  talking of his plans for the Captain, the desirableness of which was  only too apparent to Charlotte.    It was time that the Captain returned. He came up and unrolled his  design before the Count. But with what changed eyes Charlotte now looked  at the friend whom she was to lose. In her necessity, she bowed and  turned away, and hurried down to the summer-house. Before she was half  way there, the tears were streaming from her eyes, and she flung herself  into the narrow room in the little hermitage, and gave herself up to an  agony, a passion, a despair, of the possibility of which, but a few  moments before, she had not had the slightest conception.    Edward had gone with the Baroness in the other direction toward the  ponds. This ready-witted lady, who liked to be in the secret about  everything, soon observed, in a few conversational feelers which she  threw out, that Edward was very fluent and free-spoken in praise of  Ottilie. She contrived in the most natural way to lead him out by  degrees so completely that at last she had not a doubt remaining that  here was not merely an incipient fancy, but a veritable, full-grown  passion.    Married women, if they have no particular love for one another, yet are  silently in league together, especially against young girls. The  consequences of such an inclination presented themselves only too  quickly to her world-experienced spirit. Added to this, she had been"]]]
