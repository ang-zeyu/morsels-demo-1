Historically, the economy was based on the cultivation  of sugarcane and related activities. In recent years, however, the economy  has diversified into manufacturing and tourism. The tourist industry  is now a major employer of the labor force and a primary source of  foreign exchange. A high unemployment rate of about 19% in 1988 remains  one of the most serious economic problems facing the country.

LINCOLN,       _Representatives from the County of Sangamon._    The great financial panic which swept over the country in 1837 rendered  expedient an extra session of the Legislature, which was called together  in July. General Lee D. Ewing had been elected to this session from  Fayette County for the express purpose of repealing the law removing the  capital from Vandalia to Springfield. \"General Ewing was,\" says Mr.  Linder, \"a man of considerable notoriety, popularity, and talents. He  had been a member of Congress from Illinois, and had filled various  State offices in his time. He was a man of elegant manners, great  personal courage, and would grace either the _salons_ of fashion or the  Senate chamber at Washington. The Legislature opened its special session  (I was there as a spectator), and General Ewing sounded the tocsin of  war. He said that 'the arrogance of Springfield, its presumption in  claiming the seat of government, was not to be endured; that the law had  been passed by chicanery and trickery; that the Springfield delegation  had sold out to the internal improvement men, and had promised their  support to every measure that would gain them a vote to the law removing  the seat of government.' He said many other things, cutting and  sarcastic. Lincoln was chosen by his colleagues to reply to Ewing; and  I want to say here that this was the first time that I began to conceive  a very high opinion of the talents and personal courage of Abraham  Lincoln. He retorted upon Ewing with great severity, denouncing his  insinuations imputing corruption to him and his colleagues, and paying  back with usury all that Ewing had said, when everybody thought and  believed that he was digging his own grave; for it was known that Ewing  would not quietly pocket any insinuations that would degrade him  personally. I recollect his reply to Lincoln well. After addressing the  Speaker, he turned to the Sangamon delegation, who all sat in the same  portion of the house, and said: 'Gentlemen, have you no other champion  than this coarse and vulgar fellow to bring into the lists against me?  Do you suppose that I will condescend to break a lance with your low and  obscure colleague?' We were all very much alarmed for fear there would  be a personal conflict between Ewing and Lincoln. It was confidently  believed that a challenge must pass between them; but friends on both  sides took the matter in hand, and it was settled without anything  serious growing out of it.\"    When the legislative session ended, in February, 1837, Lincoln returned  to a job of surveying which he had begun a year before at Petersburg,  near his old home at Salem. He spent a month or two at Petersburg,  completing the surveying and planning of the town. That his work was  well and satisfactorily done is attested by many--among them by Mr. John  Bennett, who lived in Petersburg at the time. \"My earliest acquaintance  with Lincoln,\" says Mr. Bennett, \"began on his return from Vandalia,  where he had spent the winter as a member of the Legislature from  Sangamon County. Lincoln spent most of the month of March in Petersburg,  finishing up the survey and planning of the town he had commenced the  year before. I was a great deal in his company, and formed a high  estimate of his worth and social qualities, which was strengthened by  many years of subsequent social intercourse and business transactions,  finding him always strictly honest. In fact, he was now generally spoken  of in this region as 'Honest Abe.' After Menard County was formed out of  a portion of Sangamon County, and the county seat established at  Petersburg, Mr. Lincoln was a regular attendant at the courts. I was  then keeping a hotel, and he was one of my regular customers. Here he  met many of his old cronies of his early days at Salem, and they spent  the most of the nights in telling stories or spinning long yarns, of  which Mr. Lincoln was particularly fond.\"          CHAPTER IV           Lincoln's Removal to Springfield--A Lawyer without Clients or       Money--Early Discouragements--Proposes to Become a       Carpenter--\"Stuart & Lincoln, Attorneys at Law\"--\"Riding the       Circuit\"--Incidents of a Trip Round the Circuit--Pen Pictures of       Lincoln--Humane Traits--Kindness to Animals--Defending Fugitive       Slaves--Incidents in Lincoln's Life as a Lawyer--His Fondness for       Jokes and Stories.    Lincoln's removal from New Salem to Springfield, where his more active  life as a lawyer began, occurred in April, 1837, soon after the  completion of his survey work at Petersburg. The event was closely  connected with the removal of the State capital from Vandalia to  Springfield, the law for which was passed at the legislative session of  1836-7. As has been stated, Lincoln was a member of that Legislature and  was active in procuring the passage of the bill. The citizens of  Springfield were very desirous of the removal of the capital to their  town, and many of them were present at the session when the measure was  up for discussion. They had thus become acquainted with Lincoln; they  were favorably impressed as to his abilities and character, and pleased  with his efforts in the matter in which they were so greatly interested.  Through their influence and encouragement he chose Springfield as his  future home.    Lincoln's first interview, after his arrival in Springfield, was with  Mr. Joshua F. Speed, with whom he already had a slight acquaintance, and  who details the circumstances of their meeting. \"He had ridden into  town,\" says Mr. Speed, \"on a borrowed horse, with no earthly property  save a pair of saddle-bags containing a few clothes. I was a merchant at  Springfield, and kept a large country store, embracing dry goods,  groceries, hardware, books, medicines, bed-clothes, mattresses,--in  fact, everything that country people needed. Lincoln came into the store  with his saddle-bags on his arm, and said he wanted to buy the fixings  for a single bed. The mattresses, blankets, sheets, coverlid, and  pillow, according to the figures made by me, would cost seventeen  dollars. He said that was perhaps cheap enough, but small as the sum was  he was unable to pay it. But if I would credit him till Christmas and  his experiment as a lawyer was a success, he would pay then; adding, in  the saddest tone, 'If I fail in this, I do not know that I can ever pay  you.' As I looked up at him I thought then, and think now, that I never  saw a sadder face. I said to him, 'You seem to be so much pained at  contracting so small a debt, I think I can suggest a plan by which you  can avoid the debt and at the same time attain your end. I have a large  room with a double bed up-stairs which you are very welcome to share  with me.' 'Where is your room?' said he. 'Up-stairs,' said I, pointing  to a pair of winding stairs which led from the store to my room. He took  his saddle-bags on his arm, went up-stairs, set them down on the floor,  and came down with the most changed countenance. Beaming with pleasure,  he exclaimed, 'Well, Speed, I'm moved!' Lincoln was then twenty-eight  years old. He was a lawyer without a client, with no money, all his  earthly wealth consisting of the clothes he wore and the contents of his  saddle-bags.\"    Lincoln shared the same room with Mr. Speed during his early residence  in Springfield, taking his meals with his companion at the house of Mr.  William Butler, with whom he boarded for five years. His professional  advancement at first was slow, and he had periods of great  discouragement. An old settler of Illinois, named Page Eaton, says: \"I  knew Lincoln when he first came to Springfield. He was an awkward but  hard-working young man. Everybody said he would never make a good  lawyer because he was too honest. He came to my shop one day, after he  had been here five or six months, and said he had a notion to quit  studying law and learn carpentering. He thought there was more need of  carpenters out here than lawyers.\" Soon after Lincoln's settlement in  Springfield, he formed a law partnership with Major John T. Stuart, whom  he had known for some years and who already had a good position at the  bar. This partnership began, according to the statement of Major Stuart,  on April 27, 1837. It continued just four years, when it was dissolved,  and Lincoln and Judge Stephen T. Logan became partners. This latter  partnership continued about two years, when, on September 20, 1843, the  firm of Lincoln & Herndon was formed, and it continued to the time of  Lincoln's death.    When Lincoln began to practice law, it was the custom in Illinois to  \"ride the circuit,\" a proceeding of which the older communities of the  East know nothing. The State of Illinois, for instance, is divided into  a number of districts, each composed of a number of counties, of which a  single judge, appointed or elected as the case may be, for that purpose,  makes the circuit, holding courts at each county seat. Railroads being  scarce, the earlier circuit judges made their trips from county to  county on horseback or in a gig; and the prominent lawyers living within  the limits of the circuit made the tour of the circuit with the judge.  It is said that when Lincoln first began to \"ride the circuit\" he"]]]
