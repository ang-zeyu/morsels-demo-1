This opinion it  seems somewhat difficult to comprehend; and no one, unacquainted with  the ecclesiastical history of those ages, could imagine the height of  zeal and violence with which it was then inculcated.  The decree of  the Lateran council calls the Monothelites impious, execrable, wicked,  abominable, and even diabolical; and curses and anathematizes them to  all eternity [f].  [FN [d] Spell.

CHAPTER II.    EGBERT.--ETHELWOLF.--ETHELBALD AND ETHELBERT.--ETHERED.--ALFRED THE  GREAT.--EDWARD THE ELDER.--ATHELSTAN.--EDMUND.---EDRED--EDWY.--EDGAR.--  EDWARD THE MARTYR.        [MN Egbert 827.]  The kingdoms of the Heptarchy, though united by so recent a conquest,  seemed to be firmly cemented into one state under Egbert; and the  inhabitants of the several provinces had lost all desire of revolting  from that monarch, or of restoring their former independent  governments.  Their language was every where nearly the same, their  customs, laws, institutions, civil and religious; and as the race of  the ancient kings was totally extinct in all the subjected states, the  people readily transferred their allegiance to a prince who seemed to  merit it by the splendour of his victories, the vigour of his  administration, and the superior nobility of his birth.  A union also  in government opened to them the agreeable prospect of future  tranquillity; and it appeared more probable that they would henceforth  become formidable to their neighbours, than be exposed to their  inroads and devastations.  But these flattering views were soon  overcast by the appearance of the Danes, who, during some centuries,  kept the Anglo-Saxons in perpetual inquietude, committed the most  barbarous ravages upon them, and at last reduced them to grievous  servitude.    The Emperor Charlemagne, though naturally generous and humane, had  been induced by bigotry to exercise great severities upon the pagan  Saxons in Germany, whom he subdued; and besides often ravaging their  country with fire and sword, he had in cool blood decimated all the  inhabitants for their revolts, and had obliged them, by the most  rigorous edicts, to make a seeming compliance with the Christian  doctrine.  That religion, which had easily made its way among the  British Saxons by insinuation and address, appeared shocking to their  German brethren, when imposed on them by the violence of Charlemagne,  and the more generous and warlike of these pagans had fled northward  into Jutland, in order to escape the fury of his persecutions.  Meeting there with a people of similar manners, they were readily  received among them; and they soon stimulated the natives to concur in  enterprises, which both promised revenge on the haughty conqueror, and  afforded subsistence to those numerous inhabitants with which the  northern countries were now overburdened [g].  They invaded the  provinces of France, which were exposed by the degeneracy and  dissensions of Charlemagne's posterity; and being there known under  the general name of Normans, which they received from their northern  situation, they became the terror of all the maritime and even of the  inland countries.  They were also tempted to visit England in their  frequent excursions; and being able, by sudden inroads, to make great  progress over a people who were not defended by any naval force, who  had relaxed their military institutions, and who were sunk into a  superstition which had become odious to the Danes and ancient Saxons,  they made no distinction in their hostilities between the French and  English kingdoms.  Their first appearance in this island was in the  year 787 [h], when Brithric reigned in Wessex.  A small body of them  landed in that kingdom, with a view of learning the state of the  country; and when the magistrate of the place questioned them  concerning their enterprise, and summoned them to appear before the  king, and account for their intentions, they killed him, and, flying  to their ships, escaped into their own country.  The next alarm was  given to Northumberland in the year 794 [i], when a body of these  pirates pillaged a monastery: but their ships being much damaged by a  storm, and their leader slain in a skirmish, they were at last  defeated by the inhabitants, and the remainder of them put to the  sword.  Five years after Egbert had established his monarchy over  England, the Danes landed in the Isle of Shepey, and having pillaged  it, escaped with impunity [k].  They were not so fortunate in their  next year's enterprise, when they disembarked from thirty-five ships,  and were encountered by Egbert, at Charmouth, in Dorsetshire.  The  battle was bloody; but though the Danes lost great numbers, they  maintained the post they had taken, and thence made good their retreat  to their ships [l].  Having learned by experience, that they must  expect a vigorous resistance from this warlike prince, they entered  into an alliance with the Britons of Cornwall, and landing two years  after in that country, made an inroad with their confederates into the  county of Devon, but were met at Hengesdown by Egbert, and totally  defeated [m].  While England remained in this state of anxiety, and  defended itself more by temporary expedients than by any regular plan  of administration, Egbert, who alone was able to provide effectually  against this new evil, unfortunately died [MN 838.], and left the  government to his son Ethelwolf.  [FN [g] Ypod. Neustria, p. 414.  [h] Chron. Sax. p. 64.  [i] Chron.  Sax. p 64.  Alur. Beverl. p. 108.  [k] Chron. Sax. p. 72.  [l] Chron.  Sax. p. 72.  Ethelward, lib. 3. cap. 2.  [m] Chron. Sax. p. 72.]    [MN Ethelwolf.]  This prince had neither the abilities nor the vigour of his father;  and was better qualified for governing a convent than a kingdom [n].  He began his reign with making a partition of his dominions, and  delivering over to his eldest son, Athelstan, the new-conquered  provinces of Essex, Kent, and Sussex.  But no inconveniences seem to  have risen from this partition, as the continual terror of the Danish  invasions prevented all domestic dissension.  A fleet of these  ravagers, consisting of thirty-three sail, appeared at Southampton,  but were repulsed with loss by Wolfhere, governor of the neighbouring  county [o].  The same year, Aethelhelm, governor of Dorsetshire,  routed another band which had disembarked at Portsmouth, but he  obtained the victory after a furious engagement, and he bought it with  the loss of his life [p].  Next year the Danes made several inroads  into England, and fought battles, or rather skirmishes, in East Anglia  and Lindesey and Kent, where, though they were sometimes repulsed and  defeated, they always obtained their end of committing spoil upon the  country, and carrying off their booty.  They avoided coming to a  general engagement, which was not suited to their plan of operations.  Their vessels were small, and ran easily up the creeks and rivers,  where they drew them ashore, and having formed an entrenchment round  them, which they guarded with part of their number, the remainder  scattered themselves every where, and carrying off the inhabitants and  cattle and goods, they hastened to their ships and quickly  disappeared.  If the military force of the county were assembled, (for  there was no time for troops to march from a distance,) the Danes  either were able to repulse them, and to continue their ravages with  impunity, or they betook themselves to their vessels, and setting  sail, suddenly invaded some distant quarter, which was not prepared  for their reception.  Every part of England was held in continual  alarm, and the inhabitants of one county durst not give assistance to  those of another, lest their own families and property should in the  mean time be exposed by their absence to the fury of these barbarous  ravagers [q].  All orders of men were involved in this calamity, and  the priests and monks, who had been commonly spared in the domestic  quarrels of the Heptarchy, were the chief objects on which the Danish  idolators exercised their rage and animosity.  Every season of the  year was dangerous, and the absence of the enemy was no reason why any  man could esteem himself a moment in safety.  [FN [n] Wm. Malmes. lib. 2. cap. 2.  [o] Chron. Sax. p. 73.  Ethelward, lib. 3.  [p] Chron. Sax. p. 73.  H. Hunting. lib. 5.  [q]  Alured. Beverl. p. 108.]    [MN 851.]  These incursions had now become almost annual, when the Danes,  encouraged by their successes against France as well as England, (for  both kingdoms were alike exposed to this dreadful calamity,) invaded  the last in so numerous a body, as seemed to threaten it with  universal subjection.  But the English, more military than the  Britons, whom a few centuries before they had treated with like  violence, roused themselves with a vigour proportioned to the  exigency.  Ceorle, governor of Devonshire, fought a battle with one  body of the Danes at Wiganburgh [r], and put them to rout with great  slaughter.  King Athelstan attacked another at sea near Sandwich, sunk  nine of their ships, and put the rest to flight [s].  A body of them,  however, ventured, for the first time, to take up winter quarters in  England; and receiving in the spring a strong reinforcement of their  countrymen in 350 vessels, they advanced from the Isle of Thanet,  where they had stationed themselves, burnt the cities of London and  Canterbury, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10586"],[0,"Mike and Psmith (#17)"],[1," saw his light pass across the field and through the  gate. The school clock struck the quarter.    It seemed to Mike that Sergeant Collard, even if he had started to wait  for him at the house, would not keep up the vigil for more than half an  hour. He would be safe now in trying for home again.    He walked in that direction.    Now it happened that Mr. Downing, aroused from his first sleep by the  news, conveyed to him by Adair, that MacPhee, one of the junior members  of Adair's dormitory, was groaning and exhibiting other symptoms of  acute illness, was disturbed in his mind. Most housemasters feel uneasy  in the event of illness in their houses, and Mr. Downing was apt to get  jumpy beyond the ordinary on such occasions. All that was wrong with  MacPhee, as a matter of fact, was a very fair stomachache, the direct  and legitimate result of eating six buns, half a coconut, three  doughnuts, two ices, an apple, and a pound of cherries, and washing the  lot down with tea. But Mr. Downing saw in his attack the beginnings of  some deadly scourge which would sweep through and decimate the house. He  had dispatched Adair for the doctor, and, after spending a few minutes  prowling restlessly about his room, was now standing at his front gate,  waiting for Adair's return.    It came about, therefore, that Mike, sprinting lightly in the direction  of home and safety, had his already shaken nerves further maltreated by  being hailed, at a range of about two yards, with a cry of \"Is that you,  Adair?\" The next moment Mr. Downing emerged from his gate.    Mike stood not upon the order of his going. He was off like an arrow--a  flying figure of Guilt. Mr. Downing, after the first surprise, seemed to  grasp the situation. Ejaculating at intervals the words, \"Who is that?  Stop! Who is that? Stop!\" he dashed after the much-enduring Wrykynian at  an extremely creditable rate of speed. Mr. Downing was by way of being a  sprinter. He had won handicap events at College sports at Oxford, and,  if Mike had not got such a good start, the race might have been over in  the first fifty yards. As it was, that victim of Fate, going well, kept  ahead. At the entrance to the school grounds he led by a dozen yards.  The procession passed into the field, Mike heading as before for  the pavilion.    As they raced across the soft turf, an idea occurred to Mike, which he  was accustomed in after years to attribute to genius, the one flash of  it which had ever illumined his life.    It was this.    One of Mr. Downing's first acts, on starting the Fire Brigade at  Sedleigh, had been to institute an alarm bell. It had been rubbed into  the school officially--in speeches from the dais--by the headmaster, and  unofficially--in earnest private conversations--by Mr. Downing, that at  the sound of this bell, at whatever hour of day or night, every member  of the school must leave his house in the quickest possible way, and  make for the open. The bell might mean that the school was on fire, or  it might mean that one of the houses was on fire. In any case, the  school had its orders--to get out into the open at once.    Nor must it be supposed that the school was without practice at this  feat. Every now and then a notice would be found posted up on the board  to the effect that there would be fire drill during the dinner hour that  day. Sometimes the performance was bright and interesting, as on the  occasion when Mr. Downing, marshaling the brigade at his front gate, had  said, \"My house is supposed to be on fire. Now let's do a record!\" which  the Brigade, headed by Stone and Robinson, obligingly did. They fastened  the hose to the hydrant, smashed a window on the ground floor (Mr.  Downing having retired for a moment to talk with the headmaster), and  poured a stream of water into the room. When Mr. Downing was at liberty  to turn his attention to the matter, he found that the room selected was  his private study, most of the light furniture of which was floating in  a miniature lake. That episode had rather discouraged his passion for  realism, and fire drill since then had taken the form, for the most  part, of \"practicing escaping.\" This was done by means of canvas chutes,  kept in the dormitories. At the sound of the bell the prefect of the  dormitory would heave one end of the chute out of the window, the other  end being fastened to the sill. He would then go down it himself, using  his elbows as a brake. Then the second man would follow his example, and  these two, standing below, would hold the end of the chute so that the  rest of the dormitory could fly rapidly down it without injury, except  to their digestions.    After the first novelty of the thing had worn off, the school had taken  a rooted dislike to fire drill. It was a matter for self-congratulation  among them that Mr. Downing had never been able to induce the headmaster  to allow the alarm bell to be sounded for fire drill at night. The  headmaster, a man who had his views on the amount of sleep necessary for  the growing boy, had drawn the line at night operations. \"Sufficient  unto the day\" had been the gist of his reply. If the alarm bell were to  ring at night when there was no fire, the school might mistake a genuine  alarm of fire for a bogus one, and refuse to hurry themselves.    So Mr. Downing had had to be content with day drill.    The alarm bell hung in the archway, leading into the school grounds. The  end of the rope, when not in use, was fastened to a hook halfway up  the wall.    Mike, as he raced over the cricket field, made up his mind in a flash  that his only chance of getting out of this tangle was to shake his  pursuer off for a space of time long enough to enable him to get to the  rope and tug it. Then the school would come out. He would mix with them,  and in the subsequent confusion get back to bed unnoticed.    The task was easier than it would have seemed at the beginning of the  chase. Mr. Downing, owing to the two facts that he was not in the  strictest training, and that it is only a Bannister who can run for any  length of time at top speed shouting \"Who is that? Stop! Who is that?  Stop!\" was beginning to feel distressed. There were bellows to mend in  the Downing camp. Mike perceived this, and forced the pace. He rounded  the pavilion ten yards to the good. Then, heading for the gate, he put  all he knew into one last sprint. Mr. Downing was not equal to the  effort. He worked gamely for a few strides, then fell behind. When Mike  reached the gate, a good forty yards separated them.    As far as Mike could judge--he was not in a condition to make nice  calculations--he had about four seconds in which to get busy with that  bell rope.    Probably nobody has ever crammed more energetic work into four seconds  than he did then.    The night was as still as only an English summer night can be, and the  first clang of the clapper sounded like a million iron girders falling  from a height onto a sheet of tin. He tugged away furiously, with an eye  on the now rapidly advancing and loudly shouting figure of the  housemaster.    And from the darkened house beyond there came a gradually swelling hum,  as if a vast hive of bees had been disturbed.    The school was awake.        17    THE DECORATION OF SAMMY      Psmith leaned against the mantelpiece in the senior day room at  Outwood's--since Mike's innings against Downing's the Lost Lambs had  been received as brothers by the center of disorder, so that even  Spiller was compelled to look on the hatchet as buried--and gave his  views on the events of the preceding night, or, rather, of that morning,  for it was nearer one than twelve when peace had once more fallen on  the school.    \"Nothing that happens in this loony bin,\" said Psmith, \"has power to  surprise me now. There was a time when I might have thought it a little  unusual to have to leave the house through a canvas chute at one o'clock  in the morning, but I suppose it's quite the regular thing here. Old  school tradition, etc. Men leave the school, and find that they've got  so accustomed to jumping out of windows that they look on it as a sort  of affectation to go out by the door. I suppose none of you merchants  can give me any idea when the next knockabout entertainment of this kind  is likely to take place?\"    \"I wonder who rang that bell!\" said Stone. \"Jolly sporting idea.\"    \"I believe it was Downing himself. If it was, I hope he's satisfied.\"    Jellicoe, who was appearing in society supported by a stick, looked  meaningly at Mike, and giggled, receiving in answer a stony stare. Mike  had informed Jellicoe of the details of his interview with Mr. Barley at  the White Boar, and Jellicoe, after a momentary splutter of wrath  against the practical joker, was now in a particular lighthearted mood.  He hobbled about, giggling at nothing and at peace with all the world.    \"It was a stirring scene,\" said Psmith. \"The agility with which Comrade  Jellicoe boosted himself down the chute was a triumph of mind over  matter. He seemed to forget his ankle. It was the nearest thing to a  Boneless Acrobatic Wonder that I have ever seen.\"    \"I was in a beastly funk, I can tell you.\"    Stone gurgled.    \"So was I,\" he said, \"for a bit. Then, when I saw that it was all a rag,  I began to look about for ways of doing the thing really well. I emptied  about six jugs of water on a gang of kids under my window.\"    \"I rushed into Downing's, and ragged some of the beds,\" said Robinson.    \"It was an invigorating time,\" said Psmith. \"A sort of pageant. I was  particularly struck with the way some of the bright lads caught hold of  the idea. There was no skimping. Some of the kids, to my certain  knowledge, went down the chute a dozen times. There's nothing like doing  a thing thoroughly. I saw them come down, rush upstairs, and be saved  again, time after time. The thing became chronic with them. I should say  Comrade Downing ought to be"]]]
