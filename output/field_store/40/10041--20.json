He meant this ceremony, he told  me, as an offering or sacrifice to the spirits of the woods; who were, he  said, a powerful race of beings of a white colour, with long flowing  hair. I laughed at his folly, but could not condemn the piety of his  motives.    At noon we had reached Gungadi, a large town, where we stopped about an  hour, until some of the asses that had fallen behind came up. Here I  observed a number of date trees, and a mosque built of clay, with six  turrets, on the pinnacles of which were placed six ostrich eggs. A little  before sunset we arrived at the town of Samee, on the banks of the  Senegal, which is here a beautiful but shallow river, moving slowly over  a bed of sand and gravel. The banks are high and covered with verdure;  the country is open and cultivated; and the rocky hills of Felow and  Bambouk add much to the beauty of the landscape.    December 28th.  We departed from Samee, and arrived in the afternoon at  Kayee, a large village, part of which is situated on the north, and part  on the south side of the river. A little above this place is a  considerable cataract, where the river flows over a ledge of whinstone  rock with great force: below this the river is remarkably black and deep;  and here it was proposed to make our cattle swim over. After hallooing,  and firing some muskets, the people on the Kasson side observed us, and  brought over a canoe to carry our baggage. I did not, however, think it  possible to get the cattle down the bank, which is here more than forty  feet above the water; but the Negroes seized the horses, and launched one  at a time down a sort of trench or gulley that was almost perpendicular,  and seemed to have been worn smooth by this sort of use. After the  terrified cattle had been plunged in this manner to the water's edge,  every man got down as well as he could. The ferryman then taking hold of  the most steady of the horses by a rope, led him into the water, and  paddled the canoe a little from the brink; upon which a general attack  commenced upon the other horses, who, finding themselves pelted and  kicked on all sides, unanimously plunged into the river, and followed  their companion. A few boys swam in after them; and by laving water upon  them when they attempted to return, urged them onwards, and we had the  satisfaction in about fifteen minutes to see them all safe on the other  side. It was a matter of greater difficulty to manage the asses: their  natural stubbornness of disposition made them endure a great deal of  pelting and shoving before they would venture into the water; and when  they had reached the middle of the stream, four of them turned back, in  spite of every exertion to get them forwards. Two hours were spent in  getting the whole of them over; an hour more was employed in transporting  the baggage; and it was near sunset before the canoe returned, when Demba  Sego and myself embarked in this dangerous passage-boat, which the least  motion was like to overset. The king's nephew thought this a proper time  to have a peep into a tin box of mine, that stood in the forepart of the  canoe; and in stretching out his hand for it, he unfortunately destroyed  the equilibrium, and overset the canoe. Luckily we were not far advanced,  and got back to the shore without much difficulty; from whence, after  wringing the water from our clothes, we took a fresh departure, and were  soon afterwards safely landed in Kasson.          CHAPTER VI.    _Arrival at Teesee.--Interview with Tiggity Sego, the king's  brother,--The Author's detention at Teesee.--Some account of that place  and its inhabitants.--Incidents which occurred there.--Rapacious conduct  of Tiggity Sego toward the Author on his departure--Sets out for  Kooniakary, the capital of the kingdom.--Incidents on the road, and  arrival at Kooniakary._      We no sooner found ourselves safe in Kasson, than Demba Sego told me that  we were now in his uncle's dominions, and he hoped I would consider,  being now out of danger, the obligation I owed to him, and make him a  suitable return for the trouble he had taken on my account by a handsome  present. This, as he knew how much had been pilfered from me at Joag, was  rather an unexpected proposition; and I began to fear that I had not much  improved my condition by crossing the water; but as it would have been  folly to complain, I made no observation upon his conduct, and gave him  seven bars of amber and some tobacco, with which he seemed to be content.    After a long day's journey, in the course of which I observed a number of  large loose nodules of white granite, we arrived at Teesee on the evening  of December 29th, and were accommodated in Demba Sego's hut. The next  morning he introduced me to his father Tiggity Sego, brother to the King  of Kasson, chief of Teesee. The old man viewed me with great earnestness,  having never, he said, beheld but one white man before, whom by his  description I immediately knew to be Major Houghton. I related to him, in  answer to his inquiries, the motives that induced me to explore the  country. But he seemed to doubt the truth of what I asserted; thinking, I  believe, that I secretly meditated some project which I was afraid to  avow. He told me, it would be necessary I should go to Kooniakary, the  residence of the king, to pay my respects to that prince, but desired me  to come to him again before I left Teesee.    In the afternoon one of his slaves eloped; and a general alarm being  given, every person that had a horse rode into the woods, in the hopes of  apprehending him; and Demba Sego begged the use of my horse for the same  purpose. I readily consented: and in about an hour they all returned with  the slave, who was severely flogged, and afterwards put in irons. On the  day following, (Dec. 31,) Demba Sego was ordered to go with twenty  horsemen to a town in Gedumah, to adjust some dispute with the Moors, a  party of whom were supposed to have stolen three horses from Teesee.  Demba begged a second time the use of my horse; adding, that the sight of  my bridle and saddle would give him consequence among the Moors. This  request also I readily granted, and he promised to return at the end of  three days. During his absence I amused myself with walking about the  town, and conversing with the natives, who attended me everywhere with  great kindness and curiosity, and supplied me with milk, eggs, and what  other provisions I wanted, on very easy terms.    Teesee is a large unwalled town, having no security against the attack of  an enemy except a sort of citadel, in which Tiggity and his family  constantly reside. This town, according to the report of the natives, was  formerly inhabited only by a few Foulah shepherds, who lived in  considerable affluence by means of the excellent meadows in the  neighbourhood, in which they reared great herds of cattle; but their  prosperity attracting the envy of some Mandingoes, the latter drove out  the shepherds, and took possession of their lands.    The present inhabitants, though they possess both cattle and corn in  abundance, are not over nice in articles of diet; rats, moles, squirrels,  snakes, locusts, &c., are eaten without scruple by the highest and  lowest. My people were one evening invited to a feast given by some of  the townsmen, where, after making a hearty meal of what they thought fish  and kouskous, one of them found a piece of hard skin in the dish, and  brought it along with him, to show me what sort of fish they had been  eating. On examining the skin, I found they had been feasting on a large  snake. Another custom, still more extraordinary, is, that no woman is  allowed to eat an egg. This prohibition, whether arising from ancient  superstition, or from the craftiness of some old Bushreen who loved eggs  himself, is rigidly adhered to, and nothing will more affront a woman of  Teesee than to offer her an egg. The custom is the more singular, as the  men eat eggs without scruple in the presence of their wives, and I never  observed the same prohibition in any other of the Mandingo countries.    The third day after his son's departure, Tiggity Sego held a palaver on a  very extraordinary occasion, which I attended; and the debates on both  sides of the question displayed much ingenuity. The case was this: A  young man, a Kafir, of considerable affluence, who had recently married a  young and handsome wife, applied to a very devout Bushreen, or Mussulman  priest of his acquaintance, to procure him saphies for his protection  during the approaching war. The Bushreen complied with the request; and  in order, as he pretended, to render the saphies more efficacious,  enjoined the young man to avoid any nuptial intercourse with his bride  for the space of six weeks. Severe as the injunction was, the Kafir  strictly obeyed; and without telling his wife the real cause, absented  himself from her company. In the meantime, it began to be whispered at  Teesee, that the Bushreen, who always performed his evening devotions at  the door of the Kafir's hut, was more intimate with the young wife than  he ought to be. At first, the good husband was unwilling to suspect the  honour of his sanctified friend, and one whole month elapsed before any  jealousy rose in his mind; but hearing the charge repeated he at last  interrogated his wife on the subject who frankly confessed that the  Bushreen had seduced her.    Hereupon the Kafir put her into confinement, and called a palaver upon  the Bushreen's conduct. The fact was clearly proved against him; and he  was sentenced to be sold into slavery, or to find two slaves for his  redemption, according to the pleasure of the complainant. The injured  husband, however, was unwilling to proceed against his friend to such  extremity, and desired rather to have him publicly flogged before Tiggity  Sego's gate. This was agreed to, and the sentence was immediately  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8565"],[0,"A Book of German Lyrics (#16)"],[1,"von Eichendorff, the scion of an old aristocratic family,  was born in his ancestral castle in Silesia, March 10, 1788, and died  November 26, 1856. Three things especially have left an impression on his  poetry: his deeply loved Silesian home with its castle-crowned wooded  hills and its beautiful valleys and streams; a simple childlike piety;  and an early acquaintance with the _Volksbücher_ and the _Volkslied_. The  only things in Eichendorff's life that have a romantic glamor are his  happy, carefree student days and his participation in the Wars of  Liberation (1813-1815). When peace was declared, the poet entered the  service of the Prussian state and proved himself a careful and trusted  official. Thus, living a busy life, he could write that classic of  romantic idleness: _Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts_, _The Autobiography  of a Good-for-Nothing_.    Eichendorff's lyric verse can be described best by Nietzsche's definition  of a _Lied_: \"_Takt als Anfang, Reim als Ende, und als Seele stets  Musik_.\" Music is the very soul of his lyrics to an unusual degree. A  melody of haunting sweetness dwells in his simple lines. It is as if the  music of Robert Schumann had sought to clothe itself in words. Coupled  with this, we meet a most delicate perception of nature and a remarkable  ability to portray her various aspects and her ever varying moods.  Romantic _Sehnsucht_ (yearning), romantic _Wanderlust_ and the romantic  love of nature have found in Eichendorff their finest expression.      33.--10. VOR, _on account of, because of._        11. WAS, _why._        12. _with free throat and joyous breast._        16. AUFS BEST', _in the best way._      34.--3. WOHL. _indeed._        13. BANNER, usually neuter.        16. The forest is the scene of many of the old legends.        21. _Always remain steadfast and true._ Compare: _Wir bleiben die      Alten_, i.e., our feeling toward each other will not change, we shall      remain true friends.      35. Besides its love of nature and its religious note, both apparent in  the previous poems, notice especially the touch of symbolism; the poet  stands in _Waldesschatten wie an des Lebens Rand_.        5, 6. SCHLAGEN HEREIN, _the tones of the bells come pealing into the      shadow of the forest._        10. VON. _down from, on._      36. This poem describes, as the title indicates, the dawn of spring: how  spring in a moonlight night imparts a mysterious stirring of new life to  all nature. With its variously interwoven rhymes, both end and internal,  its use of assonance and alliteration, to mention only the more obvious  effects, the poem is a musical symphony.        8. WOLKENFRAU'N, clouds personified.        11. FRÜHLINGSGESELLEN, i.e. _Waldquellen_ as helpers of spring.      37. Might well be compared to the elfin dances of Moritz von Schwind, the  romantic painter.      38.--2. EIN SCHUß FÄLLT, _a shot (of a gun) is heard_.      40.--5. ENTBRENNTE for _entbrannte_.      42. Compare with 38, as to the use of the human element.        1. DER NEBEL FÄLLT, i.e., sinks away.        2. WIE BALD SICH'S RÜHRET, _how soon life will stir_.      43.--4. Note the onomatopoetic effect of the rhythm.      44. This poem is the quintessence of Eichendorff's lyric verse. Note the  construction of the stanzas. The first stanza is composed of two  syntactic units: 1 and 2, 3 and 4; the second of four units; notice the  effect of the two heavy syllables _sternklar_; the third stanza reverts  in structure to the first. Notice the effect of the inversion in 10:  _Weit ihre Flügel aus_, -- XX -- X --.          RÜCKERT    Friedrich Rückert, born May 16, 1788, died January 31, 1866, represents  the combination of poet and scholar in a more striking degree than even  Uhland, but he lacks the latter's rare critical ability regarding his own  verse. Oriental languages were his special field, and a most astounding  technical skill enabled him to reproduce in German the complex Oriental  verse forms with their intricate rhyme schemes. Something of this  technical skill is apparent in 45, the one well-nigh perfect poem of  Rückert. The third stanza is an adaptation from a children's rhyme. This  the poet uses as the main motif at regular intervals, slightly varying it  in the sixth to express his own feelings directly, and closing the poem  with it in the ninth. A similar parallelism is apparent in the odd lines  of each stanza. The last line of each stanza must be read with three  accents: _Was mein einst war_, X -- -- --.      45.--7. OB, I _wonder whether_.        14. UNBEWUßTER WEISHEIT FROH, _joyous in unconscious wisdom_, i.e.,      full of wisdom and not aware of it.        16. SALOMO, _Solomon_, the wise king of the Hebrews. Oriental legends      attributed to him magic and supernatural knowledge.        25. WOHL, concessive, _it is true_.          HEINE    Heinrich Heine was born in Düsseldorf, December 13, 1797, of Jewish  parents. The Napoleonic Wars were among the chief impressions of his  childhood. He saw Napoleon ride through Düsseldorf; he saw the tattered  remains of the Grande Armée return from the disastrous Russian campaign;  and although not without the patriotic fervor of the German youth, he  could not but admire the genius of the great Corsican (46). At Hamburg  the young Heine was to enter upon a commercial career under the guidance  of his rich uncle, but failed. An unrequited love for his cousin Amalie  Heine became for a number of years the subject of his song. His favorite,  almost exclusive vehicle; of expression is the simple stanza of the  _Volkslied_, which he uses with consummate skill for new effects. Heine's  attempts in law proved as futile as those in business; although he did  pass his examination for the degree of _Doctor juris_, the study of  poetry had been his chief endeavor in his university career. Finally he  decided to make literature his profession. Disgruntled with things in  general and more especially with Germany--he had been crossed in his love  for Amalie's younger sister Therese, the rich uncle not wanting a  penniless poet for a son-in-law--Heine went to Paris in 1831, where he  lived till his death (February 17, 1856), often reviling but always  cherishing and loving Germany, the country of sweet romantic song.  Compare his poem _In der Fremde_ (64).      46. The theme of the poem is the loyalty of the humble soldier to his  chosen hero. Its tone is utterly realistic, its language and metaphors  those of everyday prose. Notice the effects Heine achieves by varying the  number of unaccented syllables, e.g., 13 and 33, X -- X -- X -- X -- and  X -- XX -- XX -- XX --.        2. WAREN GEFANGEN, _had been captives_.        6. VERLOREN GEHEN, _to be lost_.        10. WOHL, _indeed_; OB, _because of_.        11. MIR IST WEH, _I am sore at heart_; _mir wird weh_?        13. DAS LIED IST AUS, _the jig is up, all is over_.        18. ICH TRAGE, _I bear, I cherish_.      47--58. A rearrangement from two cycles, _Lyrisches Intermezzo_ and  _Heimkehr_. The main theme is the poet's unrequited love for his cousin  Amalie Heine (49, Therese).      48. The Lorelei is the name of a high cliff overlooking the Rhine.  Clemens Brentano invented the myth, and the theme became popular in the  early decades of the nineteenth century. Heine gave it its final form, in  which it has practically become a folksong. The first four lines give us  the mood of the poet, the second four give the setting of the action.  9-22 describe the action. Notice the utter simplicity of 21 and 22, which  characterizes also the short epilogue, 23 and 24. This simple way of  ending a poem Heine has in common with the folksong.        4. _That does not leave my thought_.        18. Impersonal, best rendered by the passive.      50. Notice that this poem has the same tripartite structure as the  preceding. (Heine's decided preference for this structure is evinced by  the great number of poems of three stanzas.)        3. GANGES, river in India.        9. This bit of nature description, although unconventional, does not      lack truth. Goethe offers a similar example, when he speaks of      _schalkhafte_ (roguish, waggish) _Veilchen_.      51. One of the finest of Heine's nature poems.      52.--6. MORGENLAND, see Vocabulary.      53.--8. NEBELTANZ, _the dance of the mists_.      54. Notice the realism of tone, not a word that rises above the plane of  everyday prose. A whole tragedy compressed into three stanzas.        6, 7. _The first man that happened to come her way_.        8. IST ÜBEL DRAN, _is in a sad fix_.      55. Compare 42, where the _Stimmung_, the mood, of a bit of nature is  expressed without any reference to any human element. In this poem of  Heine the charm of the evening is embodied in the fair nymph. Compare 37.  The same tendency is apparent in many of the paintings of Schwind and  Böcklin.      56. Stanzas 1-3 are each divided into two equal parts. In the third  stanza, however, the line of division is less marked; notice also the  effect of the inversion in 12: _Taucht er ins Flutengrab_, -- XX -- X --.  In the fourth stanza each line stands by itself.      57. Notice the effect of the rhyme combining the first and fourth lines  of each stanza. The first two lines of each stanza have four accents, the  last two, three. Notice how the metrical structure of the line is made  subservient to the mood expressed; this is especially true of 3: _Es  dunkelt schon, mich schläfert_, X -- X -- || X -- X.      59. An apotheosis of Christ, who is represented as the spirit of  universal love permeating all things.        17. SONNENHERZ, _sun heart_, since the sun is his heart.        22 ff. These lines imitate clearly the pealing of church bells.        36. SCHAUERND IN, _thrilled with_.      60. Notice the dainty effect of the tone coloring, heightened by the  skilful use of impure rhymes.      61. The charm of this poem, as of many of Heine's, lies in its suggestive "]]]
