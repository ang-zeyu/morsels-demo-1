A very simple  annunciator for indicating two numbers can be made from a small  box, Fig. 1, with an electric-bell magnet, A, fastened in the  bottom. The armature, B, is pivoted in the center by means of a  small piece of wire and has an indicator or hand, C, which moves  to either right or left, depending on which half of the magnet is  magnetized. If the back armature, D, of the magnet is removed the  moving armature will work better, as this will prevent the  magnetism from acting on both ends of the armature.    The wiring diagram, Fig. 2, shows how the connections are to be  made. If the pushbutton A is closed; the bell will ring and the  pointer will point at 1,    [Illustration: Annuciator and Wiring Diagram]    while the closing of the push-button B will ring the bell and move  the pointer to 2.  --Contributed by H.

J.        ** How to Make a Box Kite [58]    As some of the readers of Amateur Mechanics may desire to build a  box kite, a simple method of constructing one of the modern type  is given in detail as follows: The sticks should be made of  straight grained wood, which may be either spruce, basswood or  white pine. The longitudinal corner spines, A A, should be 3/8 in.  square by 42 in. long, and the four diagonal struts, B, should be  1/4 in. by 1/2 in., and about 26 in. long. Two cloth bands should  be made to the exact dimensions given in the sketch and fastened  to the four longitudinal sticks with 1 oz. tacks. It is well to  mark the positions of the sticks on the cloth bands, either with a  soft lead-pencil or crayon, in order to have the four sides of  each band exactly equal. The ends of the bands should be lapped  over at least 1/2 in. and sewed double to give extra strength, and  the edges should be carefully hemmed, making the width, when  finished, exactly 12 in. Probably the best cloth for this purpose  is nainsook, although lonsdale cambric or lightweight percaline  will answer nearly as well.    The diagonal struts, B, should be cut a little too long, so that  they will be slightly bowed when put in position, thus holding the  cloth out taut and flat. They should be tied together at the  points of intersection and the ends should be wound with coarse  harness maker's thread, as shown at C, to prevent splitting. The  small guards, D, are nailed or glued to the longitudinal sticks to  prevent the struts slipping out of position. Of course the ends of  the struts could be fastened to the longitudinal strips if  desired, but if made as described the kite may be readily taken  apart and rolled up for convenience in carrying.    The bridle knots, E, are shown in detail at H and J. H is a square  knot, which may be easily loosened and    [Illustration: Detail of Box Kite]    shifted to a different position on the bridle, thus adjusting the  lengths of F and G. A bowline knot should be tied at J, as shown,  to prevent slipping. If the kite is used in a light wind, loosen  the square knot and shift nearer to G, thus shortening G and  lengthening F, and if a strong wind is blowing, shift toward F,  thereby lengthening G and making F shorter. In a very strong wind  do not use the bridle, but fasten a string securely to the stick  at K.  --Contributed by Edw. E.

A small quantity is rubbed well into the  grooves and on the edges of shutters, that refuse to slide easily,  with gratifying results. Care must be taken to allow no dust to  settle in the holders, however.        ** Simple Open-Circuit Telegraph Line [59]    By using the circuit shown in the sketch for short-distance  telegraph lines, the extra switches and wiring found in many  circuits are done away with. Closing either key will operate both  sounders, and, as the resistance of    [Illustration: Simple Telegraph Line]    the sounders is very high, the batteries do not run down for a  long time.  --Contributed by A. D. Stoddard, Clay Center, Kan.        ** How to Make a Thermo Battery [59]    A thermo battery, for producing electricity direct from heat, can  be made of a wooden frame, A, with a number of nails, B, driven in  the vertical piece and connected in series with heavy copper  wires, C. The connections should all be soldered to give good  results, as the voltage is    [Illustration: Thermo Battery]    very low and the resistance of an unsoldered joint would stop the  current. The heat may be supplied by an alcohol lamp or other  device, and the current may then be detected by means, of a simple  galvanometer consisting of a square spool of No. 14 or No. 16  single-covered wire, E, with a pocket compass, F, placed on top.  Turn the spool in a north and south direction, or parallel with  the compass needle. Then, when the nail heads are heated and the  circuit completed, the needle will swing around it at right angles  to the coils of wire. Applying ice or cold water to the nail heads  will reverse the current.  --Contributed by A. C.

Fasten a piece of wood, A, to  the cannon, by means of machine screws or, if there are no  trunnions on the cannon, the wood may be made in the shape of a  ring and slipped on over the muzzle. The fuse hole of the cannon  is counterbored as shown and a small hole is drilled at one side  to receive a small piece of copper wire, E. The wood screw, C,  nearly touches E and is connected to one binding post of the  induction coil. The other binding post is connected with the wood  screw, D, which conducts the current into the cannon, and also  holds the pieces of wood, A and B, in position.    When the cannon is loaded, a small quantity of powder is placed in  the counterbore, and the spark between C and E ignites this and  discharges the cannon. A cannon may be fired from a distance in  this way, and as there is no danger of any spark remaining after  the current is shut off, it is safer than the ordinary cannon  which is fired by means of a fuse.  --Contributed by Henry Peck, Big Rapids, Mich.        ** Simple Electric Lock [60]    The illustration shows an automatic lock operated by electricity,  requiring a strong magnet, but no weights or strings, which  greatly simplifies the device over many others of the kind.    [Illustration: Lock Operated by a Magnet]    The weight of the long arm, L, is just a trifle greater than the  combined weights of the short arms, A and S. The fulcrum of the  lever is at C, where there is a staple. The lever swings on one  arm of the staple and the other arm is so placed that when the  lever is in an upright position, with the long arm at L', it will  not fall because of its greater weight but stays in the position  shown. The purpose of this is to leave the short arm, A, when in  position at A', within the reach of the magnet. Arm L rests on an  L-shaped hook, H; in this position the door is locked.    To unlock the door, press the button, B. The momentum acquired  from the magnet by the short arms, A and S, is sufficient to move  the long arm up to the position of L'. To lock the door, press the  button and the momentum acquired from the magnet by the short  arms, now at A' and S', is sufficient to move the long arm down  from L' to the position at L.  --Contributed by Benjamin Kubelsky, Chicago.        ** Direct-Connected Reverse for Small Motors [60]    A simple reverse for small motors can be attached directly to the  motor as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows the construction of the  reverse block: A is a strip of walnut 5/8 in. square and 3/8 in.  thick with strips of brass or copper (BB) attached as shown. Holes  (CC) are drilled for the wire connections and they must be flush  with the surface of the block. A hole for a 1/2 in. screw is bored  in the block. In Fig. 1, D is a thin strip of walnut or other  dense, hard wood fitted to the binding posts of the brush holders,  to receive the screw in the center.    Before putting the reverse block on the motor, remove all the  connections between the lower binding posts and the brush holders  and connect both ends of the field coil to the lower posts. Bend  the strips BB (Fig. 2) to the proper position to make a wiping  contact with the nuts holding the strip of wood D, Fig. 1. Put the  screw in tight    [Illustration: Direct-Connected Reverse]    enough to make the block turn a little hard. Connect as shown in  the illustration. To reverse, turn the block so the strips change  connections and the motor will do the rest.  --Contributed by Joseph B.

Professor Tyler, of Cornell University, points out that these  people comprised \"in general a clear majority of those who, of whatever  grade of culture or of wealth, would now be described as conservative  people.\" A clear majority of the official class, of men representing  large commercial interests and capital, of professional training and  occupation, clergymen, physicians, lawyers and teachers, \"seem to have  been set against the ultimate measures of the revolution\". He assumes  with justice that, within this conservative class, one may \"usually find  at least a fair portion of the cultivation, of the moral thoughtfulness,  of the personal purity and honour, existing in the community to which  they happen to belong.\" He agrees with Dr. John Fiske, and other  historical writers of eminence in the United States, in comparing the  Loyalists of 1776 to the Unionists of the southern war of secession from  1861 until 1865. They were \"the champions of national unity, as resting  on the paramount authority of the general government.\" In other words  they were the champions of a United British Empire in the eighteenth  century.    \"The old colonial system,\" says that thoughtful writer Sir J.R. Seeley,  \"was not at all tyrannous; and when the breach came the grievances of  which the Americans complained, though perfectly real, were smaller than  ever before or since led to such mighty consequences.\" The leaders among  the Loyalists, excepting a few rash and angry officials probably,  recognised that there were grievances which ought to be remedied. They  looked on the policy of the party in power in Great Britain as  injudicious in the extreme, but they believed that the relations between  the colonies and the mother-state could be placed on a more satisfactory  basis by a spirit of mutual compromise, and not by such methods as were  insidiously followed by the agitators against England. The Loyalists  generally contended for the legality of the action of parliament, and  were supported by the opinion of all high legal authorities; but the  causes of difficulty were not to be adjusted by mere lawyers, who  adhered to the strict letter of the law, but by statesmen who recognised  that the time had come for reconsidering the relations between the  colonies and the parent state, and meeting the new conditions of their  rapid development and political freedom. These relations were not to be  placed on an equitable and satisfactory basis by mob-violence and  revolution. All the questions at issue were of a constitutional  character, to be settled by constitutional methods.    Unhappily, English statesmen of that day paid no attention to, and had  no conception of, the aspirations, sentiments and conditions of the  colonial peoples when the revolutionary war broke out. The king wished  to govern in the colonies as well as in the British Isles, and  unfortunately the unwise assertion of his arrogant will gave dangerous  men like Samuel Adams, more than once, the opportunity they wanted to  stimulate public irritation and indignation against England.    It is an interesting fact, that the relations between Great Britain and  the Canadian Dominion are now regulated by just such principles as were  urged in the interests of England and her colonies a hundred and twenty  years ago by Governor Thomas Hutchinson, a great Loyalist, to whom  justice is at last being done by impartial historians in the country  where his motives and acts were so long misunderstood and  misrepresented. \"Whatever measures,\" he wrote to a correspondent in  England, \"you may take to maintain the authority of parliament, give me  leave to pray they may be accompanied with a declaration that it is not  the intention of parliament to deprive the colonies of their subordinate  power of legislation, nor to exercise the supreme power except in such  cases and upon such occasions as an equitable regard to the interests of  the whole empire shall make necessary.\" But it took three-quarters of a  century after the coming of the Loyalists to realise these statesmanlike  conceptions of Hutchinson in the colonial dominions of England to the  north of the dependencies which she lost in the latter part of the  eighteenth century.    Similar opinions were entertained by Joseph Galloway, Jonathan Boucher,  Jonathan Odell, Samuel Seabury, Chief Justice Smith, Judge Thomas Jones,  Beverley Robinson and other men of weight and ability among the  Loyalists, who recognised the short-sightedness and ignorance of the  British authorities, and the existence of real grievances. Galloway, one  of the ablest men on the constitutional side, and a member of the first  continental congress, suggested a practical scheme of imperial  federation, well worthy of earnest consideration at that crisis in  imperial affairs. Eminent men in the congress of 1774 supported this  statesmanlike mode of placing the relations of England and the colonies  on a basis which would enable them to work harmoniously, and at the same  time give full scope to the ambition and the liberties of the colonial  communities thus closely united; but unhappily for the empire the  revolutionary element carried the day. The people at large were never  given an opportunity of considering this wise proposition, and the  motion was erased from the records of congress. In its place, the people  were asked to sign \"articles of association\" which bound them to cease  all commercial relations with England. Had Galloway's idea been carried  out to a successful issue, we might have now presented to the world the  noble spectacle of an empire greater by half a continent and  seventy-five millions of people.    But while Galloway and other Loyalists failed in their measures of  adjusting existing difficulties and remedying grievances, history can  still do full justice to their wise counsel and resolute loyalty, which  refused to assist in tearing the empire to fragments. These men, who  remained faithful to this ideal to the very bitter end, suffered many  indignities at the hands of the professed lovers of liberty, even in  those days when the questions at issue had not got beyond the stage of  legitimate argument and agitation. The courts of law were closed and the  judges prevented from fulfilling their judicial functions. No class of  persons, not even women, were safe from the insults of intoxicated  ruffians. The clergy of the Church of England were especially the object  of contumely.    During the war the passions of both parties to the controversy were  aroused to the highest pitch, and some allowance must be made for  conditions which were different from those which existed when the  questions at issue were still matters of argument. It is impossible in  times of civil strife to cool the passions of men and prevent them from  perpetrating cruelties and outrages which would be repugnant to their  sense of humanity in moments of calmness and reflection. Both sides,  more than once, displayed a hatred of each other that was worthy of the  American Iroquois themselves. The legislative bodies were fully as  vindictive as individuals in the persecution of the Loyalists.  Confiscation of estate, imprisonment, disqualification for office,  banishment, and even death in case of return from exile, were among the  penalties to which these people were subject by the legislative acts of  the revolutionary party.    If allowance can be made for the feelings of revenge and passion which  animate persons under the abnormal conditions of civil war, no  extenuating circumstances appear at that later period when peace was  proclaimed and congress was called upon to fulfil the terms of the  treaty and recommend to the several independent states the restoration  of the confiscated property of Loyalists. Even persons who had taken up  arms were to have an opportunity of receiving their estates back on  condition of refunding the money which had been paid for them, and  protection was to be afforded to those persons during twelve months  while they were engaged in obtaining the restoration of their property.  It was also solemnly agreed by the sixth article of the treaty that  there should be no future confiscations or prosecutions, and that no  person should \"suffer any future loss or damage, either in his person,  liberty or property,\" for the part he might have taken in the war. Now  was the time for generous terms, such terms as were even shown by the  triumphant North to the rebellious South at the close of the war of  secession. The recommendations of congress were treated with contempt by  the legislatures in all the states except in South Carolina, and even  there the popular feeling was entirely opposed to any favour or justice  being shown to the beaten party. The sixth article of the treaty, a  solemn obligation, was violated with malice and premeditation. The  Loyalists, many of whom had returned from Great Britain with the hope of  receiving back their estates, or of being allowed to remain in the  country, soon found they could expect no generous treatment from the  successful republicans. The favourite Whig occupation of tarring and  feathering was renewed. Loyalists were warned to leave the country as  soon as possible, and in the south some were shot and hanged because  they did not obey the warning. The Loyalists, for the most part, had no  other course open to them than to leave the country they still loved and  where they had hoped to die.    The British government endeavoured, so far as it was in its power, to  compensate the Loyalists for the loss of their property by liberal  grants of money and land, but despite all that was done for"]]]
