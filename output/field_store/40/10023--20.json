For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth             before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he             will accept of me.    01:032:021 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that             night in the company.    01:032:022 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two             womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford             Jabbok.    01:032:023 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over             that he had.    01:032:024 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him             until the breaking of the day.    01:032:025 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched             the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was             out of joint, as he wrestled with him.    01:032:026 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I             will not let thee go, except thou bless me.    01:032:027 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.    01:032:028 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but             Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men,             and hast prevailed.    01:032:029 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.             And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?             And he blessed him there.    01:032:030 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen             God face to face, and my life is preserved.    01:032:031 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he             halted upon his thigh.    01:032:032 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which             shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day:             because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew             that shrank.    01:033:001 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau             came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the             children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two             handmaids.    01:033:002 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah             and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.    01:033:003 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the             ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.    01:033:004 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his             neck, and kissed him: and they wept.    01:033:005 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;             and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children             which God hath graciously given thy servant.    01:033:006 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and             they bowed themselves.    01:033:007 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed             themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they             bowed themselves.    01:033:008 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met?             And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.    01:033:009 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast             unto thyself.    01:033:010 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in             thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I             have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and             thou wast pleased with me.    01:033:011 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee;             because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have             enough. And he urged him, and he took it.    01:033:012 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I             will go before thee.    01:033:013 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are             tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and             if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.    01:033:014 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I             will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before             me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my             lord unto Seir.    01:033:015 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk             that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find             grace in the sight of my lord.    01:033:016 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.    01:033:017 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and             made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is             called Succoth.    01:033:018 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the             land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his             tent before the city.    01:033:019 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his             tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father,             for an hundred pieces of money.    01:033:020 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.    01:034:001 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob,             went out to see the daughters of the land.    01:034:002 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the             country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled             her.    01:034:003 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he             loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.    01:034:004 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this             damsel to wife.    01:034:005 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now             his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his             peace until they were come.    01:034:006 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune             with him.    01:034:007 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard             it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth,             because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's             daughter: which thing ought not to be done.    01:034:008 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son             Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to             wife.    01:034:009 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto             us, and take our daughters unto you.    01:034:010 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;             dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.    01:034:011 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me             find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will             give.    01:034:012 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according             as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.    01:034:013 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father             deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their             sister:    01:034:014 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our             sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach             unto us:    01:034:015 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,             that every male of you be circumcised;    01:034:016 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take             your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will             become one people.    01:034:017 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then             will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.    01:034:018 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.    01:034:019 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had             delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than             all the house of his father.    01:034:020 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their             city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,    01:034:021 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in             the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large             enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives,             and let us give them our daughters.    01:034:022 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,             to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as             they are circumcised.    01:034:023 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of             their's be our's? only let us consent unto them,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8003"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 3: Leviticus (#16)"],[1,"it shall rest;

and             the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall             flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none             pursueth.    03:026:037 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a             sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand             before your enemies.    03:026:038 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your             enemies shall eat you up.    03:026:039 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their             iniquity in your enemies' lands;

and I will remember the land.    03:026:043 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her             sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they             shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because,             even because they despised my judgments, and because their             soul abhorred my statutes.    03:026:044 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their             enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them,             to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them:             for I am the LORD their God.    03:026:045 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their             ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in             the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the             LORD.    03:026:046 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD             made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by             the hand of Moses.    03:027:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:027:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a             man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the             LORD by thy estimation.    03:027:003 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old             even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty             shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.    03:027:004 And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty             shekels.    03:027:005 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old,             then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and             for the female ten shekels.    03:027:006 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then             thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver,             and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of             silver.    03:027:007 And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male,             then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the             female ten shekels.    03:027:008 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present             himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him;             according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value             him.    03:027:009 And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the             LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be             holy.    03:027:010 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a             bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast,             then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.    03:027:011 And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a             sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast             before the priest:    03:027:012 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as             thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.    03:027:013 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth             part thereof unto thy estimation.    03:027:014 And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the             LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or             bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.    03:027:015 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he             shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto             it, and it shall be his.    03:027:016 And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field             of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to             the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at             fifty shekels of silver.    03:027:017 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to             thy estimation it shall stand.    03:027:018 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest             shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that             remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be             abated from thy estimation.    03:027:019 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem             it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy             estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.    03:027:020 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the             field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.    03:027:021 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy             unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof             shall be the priest's.    03:027:022 And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath             bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;    03:027:023 Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy             estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall             give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the             LORD.    03:027:024 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of             whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the             land did belong.    03:027:025 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of             the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.    03:027:026 Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's             firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or             sheep: it is the LORD's.    03:027:027 And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it             according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of             it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold             according to thy estimation.    03:027:028 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto             the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of             the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every             devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.    03:027:029 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be             redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.    03:027:030 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the             land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy             unto the LORD.    03:027:031 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall             add thereto the fifth part thereof.    03:027:032 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of             whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto             the LORD.    03:027:033 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall             he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the             change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.    03:027:034 These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for             the children of Israel in mount Sinai."]]]
