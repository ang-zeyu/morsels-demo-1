The boys had a  long tramp still before them, and if they were not to be late for supper,  must walk briskly. They continued on their way, while the girls ran up  the steps of the dormitory building.    \"There's no use talking, Libbie, you've got to see the infirmary nurse,\"  said Bobby resolutely. \"I promised your mother to look after you, and if  you're going to be sick you'll at least have the proper care. Wait till  we get into some dry things, and I'll take you.\"    Libbie looked rebellious, but she made no verbal protest, and when they  were once more in dry clothes Bobby marched her cousin to the immaculate  infirmary. She returned alone, saying that the nurse had detained Libbie  for observation over night.    \"She thinks she's getting a heavy cold, but it may be more serious,\"  Bobby reported. \"Well, anyway, I've done my duty. But romantic people are  always forgetting to wear their rubbers.\"    Betty had just drowsed off to sleep that night, the girls having gone to  bed immediately after the study hour, for the afternoon in the wind and  rain had made them extraordinarily sleepy, when a soft knock on the door  startled her.    She slipped out of bed and ran to the door, opening it carefully so  as not to wake Bobby. Miss Morris, the school nurse, and Miss Lacey  stood there.    \"Elizabeth isn't worse,\" said Miss Morris hastily, noting Betty's look of  alarm. \"But she is very restless and wants to see you. Miss Lacey says  you may come up. Get your dressing gown and slippers, dear.\"    Betty obeyed quickly. Libbie was probably lonely, she reflected.    The infirmary consisted of three connecting rooms, fitted with two  single beds in each, and Libbie happened to be the only patient. She was  sitting up in bed, well wrapped up, when Betty saw her, her eyes  unnaturally bright, her cheeks very red.    \"Now I'll leave you two girls together for exactly half an hour,\" said  the nurse kindly. After that Elizabeth must go to sleep.\"    \"Is the door shut--shut tight?\" demanded Libbie feverishly, grasping  Betty's hand with both her hot, dry ones.    \"Yes, dear, yes,\" affirmed Betty soothingly. \"What's the matter,  Libbie--is your throat sore?\"    \"Oh, Betty, I'm in such terrible trouble!\" gasped Libbie, her eyes  overflowing. \"I'm so frightened!\"    \"Tell me about it, dear,\" soothed Betty. \"I'll help you, you know I will.  Has it anything to do with school?\"    She was totally unprepared for Libbie's next words.    \"I have to have some money--a lot of money, Betty. I've spent my last  allowance and I can't write home for more because they will ask me why  I want it. I've borrowed so much from Louise that I can't ask her  again! I ought to pay it back. But I've got to have twenty dollars by  to-morrow night.\"    \"What for? What's the matter?\" asked Betty, in alarm.    \"You'll promise not to tell Bobby?\" demanded Libbie intensely. \"Promise  me you won't tell Bobby? She'd scold so. And Mrs. Eustice would expel me.  If you won't tell Bobby or Mrs. Eustice, Betty, I'll tell you.\"    Betty was now thoroughly aroused. She knew that impulsive novel-reading  Libbie went about with her pretty head filled with all sorts of trashy  ideas, and she didn't know what lengths she might have gone to. If Mrs.  Eustice would expel her, the affair must be serious indeed.    \"I'll promise,\" said Betty rashly. \"Tell me everything, Libbie, and if I  can I'll help you.\"    \"Well, you remember when we went nutting?\" said Libbie. \"I carried a  bottle with me with--with my name and address written on a slip of paper  inside. I read about that in a book. And I said to leave an answer in the  same bottle. I--I buried it just at the foot of the hill, before we began  to climb. Louise was with me, but she was hunting for specimens for her  botany book.\"    \"So that's why you hung back, was it?\" said Betty. \"I wish to goodness  Louise was more interested in what is going on around her. She might  have stopped you. Go on--what happened to your silly bottle?\"    \"I buried it,\" repeated Libbie, \"and two days after I went out and dug it  up. And there was an answer in it.\"    \"What did it say?\" demanded Betty practically.    \"I've got it here--\" Libbie reached under her pillow and pulled out a  slip of paper.    \"It says 'Leave ten dollars in this same place to-night, or Mrs. Eustice  shall hear of this.' And, of course,\" concluded Libbie, \"I put ten  dollars in the bottle, because whoever found it had the slip with my name  on it to show Mrs. Eustice.\"    Betty studied the paper. The handwriting was a strong backhand, not at  all an illiterate hand.    \"Oh, dear, what shall I do?\" wailed Libbie. \"He keeps asking for more,  and I won't have any money till the first of the month. I only meant  to do like the girl in the book--have a thrilling unknown  correspondent. I never knew he would ask for money! Suppose he is a  horrid, dirty tramp and he comes and tells Mrs. Eustice he found my  note? I should die of shame!\"    \"I'll have the money ready for you in the morning,\" said Betty firmly. \"I  have that much. But, of course, he'll keep demanding more. I do hope,  Libbie, that if you ever get out of this mess, you'll be cured of some of  your crazy notions!\"    \"Oh, I will,\" promised Libbie earnestly. \"I will be good, Betty. Only  don't tell Bobby.\"    She was manifestly relieved by her confession, and when Miss Morris came  in to send Betty back to her own room, Libbie curled down contentedly for  a restful night.    Not so poor Betty. She turned and tossed, wondering how she could get  more money for her chum without arousing suspicion.    \"What ever made her do a thing like that!\" she groaned. \"Of all the wild  ideas! The twenty will take every cent I have. I must see Bob and borrow  from him.\"    Libbie was much improved in the morning--so well, in fact, that after  breakfast in bed she was permitted to dress and go to her room, though  strictly forbidden to attend classes or go out of doors. Betty brought  her the twenty dollars and when school was in session, the benighted  Libbie sped out to her buried bottle and put the money in it, regaining  her room without detection.    Two days later there was another demand for money, and two days after  that, another. Libbie visited the bottle regularly, afraid to let a  day pass lest the blackmailer expose her to the principal. Betty had  seen Bob at a football game, and had borrowed fifteen dollars from  him. She could not write her uncle, for communication with him was  uncertain and her generous allowance came to her regularly through his  Philadelphia lawyer.    \"He wants twenty-five dollars by to-morrow night!\" whispered Libbie,  meeting Betty in the hall after her last visit to the buried bottle. \"Oh,  Betty, what _shall_ we do?\"    Both girls had watched patiently and furtively in their spare time in an  effort to detect the person who dug up the bottle, but they had never  seen any one go near the spot.    As it happened, when Libbie whispered her news to Betty, they were both  on their way to recitation with Miss Jessup whose current events class  both girls nominally enjoyed. To-day Betty found it impossible to fix  her mind on the brisk discussions, and half in a dream heard Libbie  flunk dismally.    When next she was conscious of what was going on about her--she had been  turning Libbie's troubles over and over in her mind without result--Miss  Jessup was speaking to her class about the \"association of ideas.\"    \"We won't go very deeply into it this morning,\" she was saying, \"but  you'll find even the surface of the subject fascinating.\"    Then she began a rapid fire of questions to which Betty paid small  attention till the sound of Ada Nansen's name aroused her.    \"Key, Ada?\" asked Miss Jessup.    The answers were supposed to indicate definite ideas.    \"Key hole,\" said Ada promptly.    \"Purse?\"    \"Money.\"    \"Bee?\" asked Miss Jessup.    To her surprise and that of the listening class, nine-tenths of whom were  forming the word \"honey\" with their lips, Ada answered without  hesitation, \"Bottle.\"    \"You must have thought I meant the letter 'B,'\" said the teacher lightly,  passing on to the next pupil.    Betty heard the dismissal bell with real relief. She cornered Libbie in  the hall as the class streamed out and announced a decision.    \"I'll have to go see Bob--I'll paddle one of the canoes,\" she said  hurriedly.    \"If any one asks for me, say I'm out on the lake.\"    Betty was now an expert with the paddle, and the trip across the lake was  easy of accomplishment. She had the great good fortune to meet Bob  returning from a recitation, and though surprised to see her, he knew she  must have come by boat or canoe. The boys had gone the next day and  brought back the canoes from the woods where they had placed them during  the storm.    \"I'm ever so sorry, Bob,\" said Betty earnestly, \"But--could you lend me  twenty-five dollars?\"    Bob whistled.    \"I could,\" he admitted cautiously. \"What's it for, Betsey?\"    \"That,\" said Betty, \"is a secret.\"    Bob glanced at her sharply. His chin hardened.    \"Come down here where we won't be interrupted,\" he said, leading the way  to the wharf. \"You'll have to give me a good reason for wanting the  money, Betty.\"          CHAPTER XIX    BOB'S SOLUTION      \"If you wanted twenty-five dollars and I had it,\" said Betty  persuasively, \"I'd give it to you without asking a solitary question.\"    Rob's lips twitched.    \"But, Betty--\" he began. Then--\"Oh, do play fair,\" he urged. \"You're  younger than I am. Uncle Dick expects me to look after you. Goodness  knows I don't want to pry into your affairs, but when you borrow fifteen  dollars and then want twenty-five the same week, what's a fellow to  think?

No  harm done!\"          CHAPTER 12      \"And now,\" said Pete Reeve, looking almost ruefully at his pupil,  \"with a little practice on that, they ain't a man in the world that  could safely take a chance with you. I couldn't myself.\"    \"Pete!\"    \"I mean it, son. Not a man in the world. I was afraid all the time. I  was afraid you didn't have that there electricity in you or whatever  they call it. I was afraid you had too much beef and not enough  nerves. But you haven't. And now that you have the knack, keep  practicing every day--thinking the gun out of the leather--that's  the trick!\"    Bull Hunter looked down to the gun with great, staring eyes, as though  it was the first time in his life that he had seen the weapon. Pete  Reeve noted his expression and abruptly became silent, grinning  happily, for there was the dawn of a great discovery in the eyes of  the big man.    The gun was no longer a gun. It was a part of him. It was flesh of his  flesh. He had literally thought it out of the holster, and the report  of the weapon had startled him more than it had frightened anyone else  in the building. He looked in amazement down to the broad expanse of  his right hand. It was trembling a little, as though, in fact, that  hand were filled with electric currents. He closed his fingers about  the butt of the gun. At once the hand became steady as a rock. He  toyed with the weapon in loosely opened fingers again, and it slid  deftly. It seemed impossible for it to fall into an awkward position.    The voice of Pete Reeve came from a great distance. \"And they's only  one thing lacking to make you perfect--and that's to have to fight  once for your life and drop the other gent. After that happens--well,  Pete Reeve will have a successor!\"    How much that meant Bull Hunter very well knew. The terrible fame of  Pete Reeve ran the length and the breadth of the mountains. Of course  Bull did not for a moment dream that Pete meant what he said. It was  all figurative. It was said to fill him with self-confidence, but part  of it was true. He was no longer the clumsy-handed Bull Hunter of the  moment before.    A great change had taken place. From that moment his very ways of  thinking would be different. He would be capable of less misty  movements of the mind. He would be capable of using his brain as  fast as his hand acted. A tingle of new life, new possibilities were  opening before him. He had always accepted himself as a stupidly  hopeless burden in the world, a burden on his friends, useless,  cloddish. Now he found that he had hopes. His own mind and body was an  undiscovered country which he was just beginning to enter. What might  be therein was worth a dream or two, and Bull Hunter straightway began  to dream, happily. That was a talent which he had always possessed in  superabundance.    The brief remainder of the day passed quickly; and then just before  supper time a stranger came to call on Pete Reeve. He was a tall, bony  fellow with straight-looking eyes and an imperious lift of his head  when he addressed anyone. Manners was his name--Hugh Manners. When he  was introduced he ran his eyes unabashedly over the great bulk of Bull  Hunter, and then promptly he turned his back on the big man and  excluded him from the heart of the conversation. It irritated Bull  unwontedly. He discovered that he had changed a great deal from the  old days at his uncle's shack when he was used to the scorn and the  indifference of all men as a worthless and stupid hulk of flesh, with  no mind worth considering, but he said nothing. Another great talent  of Bull's was his ability to keep silent.    Shortly after this they went down to the supper table. All through the  meal Hugh Manners engaged Pete Reeve in soft, rapid-voiced  conversation which was so nicely gauged as to range that Bull Hunter  heard no more than murmurs. He seemed to have a great many important  things to say to Pete, and he kept Pete nodding and listening with a  frown of serious interest. At first Pete tried to make up for the  insolent neglect of his companion by drawing a word or two from Bull  from time to time, but it was easy for Bull to see that Pete wished to  hear his newfound friend hold forth. It hurt Bull, but he resigned  himself and drew out of the talk.    After supper he went up to the room and found a book. There had  been little time for reading since he passed the first stages of  convalescence from his wounds. Pete Reeve had kept him constantly  occupied with gun work, and the hunger for print had been accumulating  in Bull. He started to satisfy it now beside the smoking lamp. He  hardly heard Pete and Hugh Manners enter the room and go out again  onto the second story of the veranda on which their room opened. From  time to time the murmur of their voices came to him, but he  regarded it not.    It was only when he had lowered the book to muse over a strange  sentence that his wandering eye was caught beyond the window by the  flash of a falling star of unusual brilliance. It was so bright,  indeed, that he crossed the room to look out at the sky, stepping very  softly, for he had grown accustomed to lightening his footfall, and  now unconsciously the murmuring voices of the talkers made him move  stealthily--not to steal upon them, but to keep from breaking in on  their talk. But when he came to the door opening on the veranda the  words he heard banished all thought of falling stars. He listened,  dazed.    Pete Reeve had just broken into the steady flow of the newcomer's  talk.    \"It's no use, Hugh. I can't go, you see. I'm tied down here with the  big fellow.\"    \"Tied down?\" thought Bull Hunter, and he winced.    A curse, then, \"Why don't you throw the big hulk over?\"    \"He ain't a hulk,\" protested Pete somewhat sharply, and the heart of  Bull warmed again.    \"Hush,\" said Hugh Manners. \"He'll be hearing.\"    \"No danger. He's at his books, and that means that he wouldn't hear a  cannon. That's his way.\"    \"He don't look like a book-learned gent,\" said Hugh Manners with more  respect in his voice.    \"He don't look like a lot of things that he is,\" said Pete. \"I don't  know what he is myself--except that he's the straightest, gentlest,  kindest, simplest fellow that ever walked.\"    Bull Hunter turned to escape from hearing this eulogy, but he dared  not move for fear his retreat might be heard--and that would be  immensely embarrassing.    \"Just what he is I don't know,\" said Pete again. \"He doesn't know  himself. He's had what you might call an extra-long childhood--that's  why he's got that misty look in his eyes.\"    \"That fool look,\" scoffed Hugh Manners.    \"You think so? I tell you, Manners, he's just waking up, and when he's  clear waked up he'll be a world-beater! You saw that doorknob?\"    \"Smashed? Yep. What of it?\"    \"He done it with a gun, standing clean across the room, with a flash  draw, shooting from the hip--and he made a clean center hit of it.\"    Pete brought out these facts jerkily, one by one, piling one  extraordinary thing upon the other; and when he had finished, Hugh  Manners gasped.    \"I'm mighty glad,\" he said, \"that you told me that, I--I might of made  some mistake.\"    \"You'd sure've made an awful mistake if you tangle with him, Manners.  Don't forget it.\"    \"Your work, I guess.\"    \"Partly,\" said Pete modestly. \"I speeded his draw up a bit, but he had  the straight eye and the steady hand when I started with him. He  didn't need much target practice--just the draw.\"    \"And he's really fast?\"    \"He's got my draw.\"    That told volumes to Manners.    \"And why not take him in with us?\" he asked, after a reverent pause.    \"Not that!\" exclaimed Pete. \"Besides, he couldn't ride and keep up  with us. He'd wear out three hosses a day with his weight.\"    \"Maybe we could find an extra-strong hoss. He ain't so big as to kill  a good strong hoss, Pete. I've seen a hoss that carried--\"    \"No good,\" said Pete with decision. \"I wouldn't even talk to him about  our business. He don't guess it. He thinks that I'm--well, he don't  have any idea about how I make a living, that's all!\"    \"But how _will_ you make a living if you stick with him?\"    \"I dunno,\" Pete sighed. \"But I'm not going to turn him down.\"    \"But ain't you about used up your money?\"    \"It's pretty low.\"    \"And you're supporting him?\"    \"Sure. He ain't got a cent.\"    Bull started. He had not thought of that matter at all, but it stood  to reason that Pete had expended a large sum on him.    \"Sponging?\" said Manners cynically.    \"Don't talk about it that way,\" said Pete uneasily. \"He's like a big  kid. He don't think about those things. If I was broke, he'd give me  his last cent.\"    \"That's what you think.\"    \"Shut up, Manners. Bull is like--a cross between a son and a brother.\"    \"Pretty big of bone for your son, Pete. You'll have a hard time  supporting him,\" and Manners chuckled. Then, more seriously, \"You're  making a fool of yourself, pardner. Throw this big hulk over and come  back--with me! They's loads of money staked out waiting for us!\"    \"Listen,\" said Pete solemnly. \"I'm going to tell you why I'll never  turn Bull Hunter down if I live to be a hundred! When I was a kid a  dirty trick was done me by old Bill Campbell. I waited all these years  till a little while ago to get back at him. Then I found him and  fought him. I didn't kill him, but I ruined him and sent him back to  his home tied on his hoss with a busted shoulder that he'll never be  able to use again. His right shoulder, at that.\"    There was a subdued exclamation from Manners, but Pete went on, \"Seems  he was the uncle of this Bull; took Bull in when Bull was orphaned,  because he had to, not because he wanted to, and he raised Bull up to  be a sort of general slave around the place. Well, when he comes back  home all shot up he tries to get his sons to take my trail, but "]]]
