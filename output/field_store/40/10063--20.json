I must go see.\"    As he passed along the hall, out of which his father's combined study  and library opened, the aged inventor came to the door.    \"Is that you, Tom?\" he asked.    \"Yes, Dad.\"    \"Come in here, if you haven't anything else to do. Mr. Damon is here.\"    Tom needed but a single glance at the faces of his father and Mr. Damon  to see that something was troubling the two. The table in front of them  was littered with papers covered with rows of figures.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Tom.    \"Well, I suppose I ought not to let it bother me, but it does,\" replied  his father.    \"Something wrong with your patents, Dad? Has the crowd of bad men been  bothering you again?\"    \"No, it isn't that. It's trouble at the bank, Tom.\"    \"Has it been robbed again?\" asked the lad quickly. \"If it has I can  prove an alibi,\" and he smiled at the recollection of the time he and  Mr. Damon had been accused of looting the vault, as told in \"Tom Swift  and His Airship.\"    \"No, it hasn't been robbed in just that way,\" put in Mr. Damon.  \"But,  bless my shoe laces, it's almost as bad! You see, Tom, since Mr. Foger  started the new bank he's done his best to cripple the one in which  your father and I are interested. I may say we are very vitally  interested in it, for, since the withdrawal of Foger and his  associates, your father and I have been elected directors.\"    \"I didn't know that,\" remarked the lad.    \"No, I didn't tell you, because you were so busy on your electric car,\"  rejoined Mr. Swift. \"But Mr. Damon and I, being both large depositors,  were asked to assume office, and, as I was not very busy on patent  affairs, I consented.\"    \"But what is the trouble?\" inquired Tom.    \"I'm coming to it,\" resumed Mr. Damon. \"Bless my check book, I'm coming  to it! You see we have lost several good customers, by reason of Foger  opening the new bank. That wouldn't have mattered so much, as between  your father and myself, and one or two others, we have enough capital  to carry on the business of the bank. But there is a more serious  matter. We hold a number of very good securities, but they are of a  class hard to realize cash for, on short notice. In other words they  are not active bonds, though they are issued by reliable concerns.  Then, too, the bank has lost considerable money by not doing as much  business as it formerly did. In short we don't know just what to do,  Tom, and your father and I were discussing it, when you came in.\"    \"Do you need more money?\" asked Tom. \"I have some, that is my share  from the submarine treasure, and some I have allowed to accumulate as  royalties from my patents. It's about ten thousand dollars, and you're  welcome to it.\"    \"Thank you, Tom,\" spoke his father. \"We may use your cash, but we'll  need a great deal more than that.\"    \"But why?\" asked the lad. \"I don't understand. If you have good bonds,  can't you dispose of them, and get the money?\"    \"We could, Tom, yes, if we had time,\" replied Mr. Damon. \"But to throw  the bonds on the market at short notice would mean that we would not  get a good price for them. We would lose considerable.\"    \"But why do it in a hurry?\"    \"Because there is need of hurry,\" responded Mr. Swift.    \"That's it,\" joined in Mr. Damon. \"We have to have cash in a hurry,  Tom, to meet pressing demands, and we don't just see our way clear to  get it. I am trying to raise it on some private securities I own, but I  can't get an answer within several days.  Meanwhile the bank may fail,  because of lack of funds. Of course no one would lose anything,  ultimately, as we could go into the hands of a receiver, and,  eventually pay dollar for dollar. Your father and I, and some of the  other directors, might lose a little, but the depositors would not. But  your father and I don't like the idea of failing. It's something I've  never done, and I'm too old to start in now, bless my cash ledger if  I'm not!\"    \"And for the sake of my reputation in this community I don't want to  see the bank close its doors,\" added Mr. Swift. \"It would give Foger  too good a chance to crow over us.\"    \"And you need cash in a hurry,\" went on Tom. \"How much?\"    \"Fifty thousand dollars at least,\" replied Mr. Damon.    \"And if you don't get it?\"    The eccentric man shrugged his shoulders.    \"Well,\" remarked Mr. Swift musingly, \"I don't see that we need worry  you about it, Tom. Perhaps--\"    Mr. Swift was interrupted by a ring at the front door. The three looked  at each other. It was late for a caller, and Mrs. Baggert had gone to  bed.    \"I'll answer it,\" volunteered Tom. He switched on the electric light in  the hall, and opened the door. He was confronted by Mr. Pendergast, the  president of the bank.    \"Is your father in?\" asked Mr. Pendergast, and he seemed to be much  agitated.    \"Yes, he is,\" replied the lad. \"Come this way, please.\"    \"I want to see him on important business,\" went on the president, as he  followed the young inventor. \"I'm afraid I have bad news for him and  Mr. Damon. Bad news, Tom, bad news,\" and the aged banker's voice  trembled. Tom, with a chill of apprehension seeming to clutch his  heart, threw open the library door.          CHAPTER XVII    A RUN ON THE BANK      \"Why, Mr. Pendergast!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, rising quickly as Tom  ushered in the aged president. \"Whatever is the matter? You here at  this hour? Bless my trial balance! Is anything wrong?    \"I'm afraid there is,\" answered the bank head. \"I have just received  word which made it necessary for me to see you both at once. I'm glad  you're here, Mr. Damon.\"    He sank wearily into a chair which Tom placed for him, and Mr. Swift  asked:    \"Have you been able to raise any cash, Mr. Pendergast?\"    \"No, I am sorry to say I have not, but I did not come here to tell you  that. I have bad news for you. As soon as we open our doors in the  morning, there will be a run on the bank.\"    \"A run on the bank?\" repeated Mr. Swift.    \"The moment we begin business in the morning,\" went on Mr. Pendergast.    \"Bless my soul, then don't begin business!\" cried Mr. Damon.    \"We must,\" insisted Mr. Pendergast. \"To keep the doors closed would be  a confession at once that we have failed. No, it is better to open  them, and stand the run as long as we can. When we have exhausted our  cash--\" he paused.    \"Well?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"Then we'll fail--that's all.\"    \"But we mustn't let the bank fail!\" cried Mr. Swift. \"I am willing to  put some of my personal fortune into the bank capital in order to save  it. So is my son here.\"    \"That's right,\" chimed in Tom heartily. \"All I've got. I'm not going to  let Andy Foger get ahead of us; nor his father either.\"    \"I'll help to the limit of my ability,\" added Mr. Damon.    \"I appreciate all that,\" continued the president. \"But the unfortunate  part of it is that we need cash. You gentlemen, like myself, probably,  have your money tied up in stocks and bonds. It is hard to get cash  quickly, and we must have cash as soon as we open in the morning, to  pay the depositors who will come flocking to the doors. We must prepare  for a run on the bank.\"    \"How do you know there will be a run?\" asked the young inventor.    \"I received word this evening, just before I came here,\" replied Mr.  Pendergast. \"A poor widow, who has a small amount in the bank, called  on me and said she had been advised to withdraw all her cash. She said  she preferred to see me about it first, as she did not like to lose her  interest. She said a number of her acquaintances, some of whom are  quite heavy depositors, had also been warned that the bank was unsound,  and that they ought to take out their savings and deposits at once.\"    \"Did she say who had thus warned her?\" inquired Mr. Swift.    \"She did,\" was the reply, \"and that shows me that there is a conspiracy  on foot to ruin our bank. She stated that Mr. Foger had told her our  institution was unsound.\"    \"Mr. Foger!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"So this is one of his tricks to bolster  up his new bank! He hopes the people who withdraw their money from our  bank will deposit with him. I see his game. He's a scoundrel, and if  it's possible I'm going to sue him for damages after this thing is  over.\"    \"Did he warn the others?\" inquired the aged inventor.    \"Not all of them,\" answered the president. \"Some received letters from  a man signing himself Addison Berg, warning them that our bank, was  likely to fail any day.\"    \"Addison Berg!\" exclaimed Tom. \"That must have been the important  business he had with Mr. Foger, the day I showed him the watch charm!  They were plotting the ruin of our bank then,\" and he told his father  about his disastrous pursuit of the submarine agent.    \"Very likely Foger is working with Berg,\" admitted Mr. Damon.  \"We will  attend to them later. The question is, what can we do to save the bank?\"    \"Get cash, and plenty of it,\" advised Mr. Pendergast. \"Suppose we go  over the whole situation again?\" and they fell to talking stocks:  bonds, securities, mortgages and interest, until the youth, interested  as he was in the situation, could follow it no longer.    \"Better go to bed, Tom,\" advised his father. \"You can't help us any,  and we have many details to go over.\"    The lad reluctantly consented, and he was soon dreaming that he was in  his electric auto, trying to pull up a thousand pound lump of gold from  the bottom of the sea. He awoke to find the bedclothes in a lump on his  chest, and, removing them, fell into a deep slumber.    When the young inventor awoke the next morning, Mrs. Baggert told him  that his father and Mr. Damon had risen nearly an hour before, had  partaken of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/953"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Big Tunnel; Or, The Hidden City of the Andes (#16)"],[1,"home. But it was a long while before we could persuade the Indians  to come back. Since then we haven't had any trouble, and I don't want  Tim, with his superstitious fancies, to start any.\"    \"But the min are gone!\" insisted the Irish foreman, who had listened to  this story as he and the others walked along.    \"We'll find them,\" declared Mr. Titus.    But though they looked all along the big shaft, and though the place  was well lighted by extra lamps that were turned on when the  investigation started, no trace could be found of the workmen, who had  been left in the tunnel to finish tamping the blast charges. The party  reached the rocky heading, in the face of which the powerful explosive  had been placed, and not an Indian was in sight. Nor, as far as could  be told, was there any side niche, or blind shaft, in which they could  be hiding.    Sometimes, when small blasts were set off, the men would go behind a  projecting shoulder of rock to wait until the charge had been fired,  but now none was in such a refuge.    \"It is queer,\" admitted Walter Titus. \"Where can the men have gone?\"    \"That's what I want to know!\" exclaimed Tim.    \"Are you sure they didn't come out the mouth of the tunnel?\" asked Job  Titus.    \"Positive,\" asserted Tom. I was there all the while, rigging up the  fires.\"    \"We'll call the roll, and check up,\" decided Job Titus.  \"Get Serato to  help.\"    The Indian foreman had not been in the tunnel with the last shift of  men, having left them to Tim Sullivan to get out in time. The Indian  foreman was called from his supper in the shack where he had his  headquarters, and the roll of workmen was called.    Ten men were missing, and when this fact became known there were uneasy  looks among the others.    \"Well,\" said Mr. Titus, after a pause. \"The men are either in the  tunnel or out of it. If they're in we don't dare set off the blast, and  if they're out they'll show up, sooner or later, for supper. I never  knew any of 'em to miss a meal.\"    \"If such a thing were possible,\" said Walter Titus, \"I would say that  our rivals had a hand in this, and had induced our men to bolt in order  to cripple our force. But we haven't seen any of Blakeson & Grinder's  emissaries about, and, if they were, how could they get the ten men out  of the tunnel without our seeing them? It's impossible!\"    \"Well, what did happen then?\" asked Tom.    \"I'm inclined to think that the men came out and neither you, nor any  one else, saw them. They ran away for reasons of their own. We'll take  another look in the morning, and then set off the blast.\"    And this was done. There being no trace of the men in the tunnel it was  deemed safe to explode the charges. This was done, a great amount of  rock being loosened.    The laborers hung back when the orders were given to go in and clean  up. There were mutterings among them.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Job Titus.    \"Them afraid,\" answered Serato. \"Them say devil in tunnel eat um up! No  go in.\"    \"They won't go in, eh?\" cried Tim Sullivan. \"Well, they will thot! If  there's a divil inside there's a worse one outside, an' thot's me! Git  in there now, ye black-livered spalapeens!\" and catching up a big club  the Irishman made a rush for the hesitating laborers. With a howl they  rushed into the tunnel, and were soon loading rock into the dump cars.          Chapter XVI    On the Watch      The mystery of the disappearance of the ten men--for mystery it  was--remained, and as no side opening or passage could be found within  the tunnel, it came to be the generally accepted explanation that the  laborers had come out unobserved, and, for reasons of their own, had  run away.    This habit on the part of the Peruvian workers was not unusual. In  fact, the Titus brothers had to maintain a sort of permanent employment  agency in Lima to replace the deserters. But they were used to this.  The difference was that the Indians used to vanish from camp at night,  and invariably after pay-day.    \"And that's the only reason I have a slight doubt that they walked out  of the tunnel,\" said Job Titus. \"There was money due em.\"    \"They never came out of the front entrance of the tunnel,\" said Tom.  \"Of that I'm positive.\"    But there was no way of proving his assertion.    The third blast, while not as successful as the second in the amount of  rock loosened, was better than the first, and made a big advance in the  tunnel progress. Tom was beginning to understand the nature of the  mountain into which the big shaft was being driven and he learned how  better to apply the force of his explosive.    That was the work which he had charge of--the placing of the giant  powder so it would do the most effective work.  Then, when the fumes  from the blast had cleared away, in would surge the workmen to clear  away the debris.    Under the direction of Mr. Swift, left at Shopton to oversee the  manufacture of the explosive, new shipments came on promptly to Lima,  and were brought out to the tunnel on the backs of mules, or in the  case of small quantities, on the llamas. But the latter brutes will not  carry a heavy load, lying down and refusing to get up if they are  overburdened, whereas one has yet to find a mule's limit.    After his first success in getting the natives to take a more active  interest in the gathering of the cinchona bark, Mr. Damon found it  rather easy, for the story of Tom's electric rifle and how it had  killed the mad dog spread among the tribes, and Mr. Damon had but to  announce that the \"lightning shooter,\" as Tom was called, was a friend  of the drug concern to bring about the desired results. Mr. Damon, by  paying a sort of bribe, disguised under the name \"tax,\" secured the  help of Peruvian officials so he had no trouble on that score.    Koku was in his element. He liked a wild life and Peru was much more  like the country of giants where Tom had found him, than any place the  big man had since visited. Koku had great strength and wanted to use  it, and after a week or so of idleness he persuaded Tom to let him go  in the tunnel to work.    The giant was made a sort of foreman under Tim, and the two became  great friends. The only trouble with Koku was that he would do a thing  himself instead of letting his men do it, as, of course, all proper  foremen should do. If the giant saw two or three of the Indians trying  to lift a big rock into the little dump cars, and failing because of  its great weight, he would good-naturedly thrust them aside, pick up  the big stone in his mighty arms, and deposit it in its place.    And once when an unusually big load had been put in a car, and the mule  attached found it impossible to pull it out to the tunnel mouth, Koku  unhitched the creature and, slipping the harness around his waist,  walked out, dragging the load as easily as if pulling a child on a sled.    Professor Bumper kept on with his search for the lost city of Pelone.  Back and forth he wandered among the wild Andes Mountains, now hopeful  that he was on the right trail, and again in despair. Tom and Mr. Damon  went with him once more for a week, and though they enjoyed the trip,  for the professor was a delightful companion, there were no results.  But the scientist would not give up.    Tom Swift was kept busy looking after the shipments of the explosive,  and arranging for the blasts. He had letters from Ned Newton in which  news of Shopton was given, and Mr. Swift wrote occasionally. But the  mails in the wilderness of the Andes were few and far between.    Tom wrote a letter of explanation to Mr. Nestor, in addition to the  wireless he had sent regarding the box labeled dynamite, but he got no  answer. Nor were his letters to Mary answered.    \"I wonder what's wrong?\" Tom mused. \"It can't be that they think I did  that on purpose. And even if Mr. Nestor is angry at me for something  that wasn't my fault, Mary ought to write.\"    But she did not, and Tom grew a bit despondent as the days went by and  no word came.    \"I suppose they might be offended because I left Rad to do up that  package instead of attending to it myself,\" thought Tom. \"Well, I did  make a mistake there, but I didn't mean to. I never thought about  Eradicate's not reading. I'll make him go to night school as soon as I  get back. But maybe I'll never get another chance to send Mary  anything. If I do, I'll not let Rad deliver it--that's sure.\"    The feeling of alarm engendered among the Indians by the disappearance  of their ten fellow-workers seemed to have disappeared. There were  rumors that some of the mysterious ten had been seen in distant  villages and settlements, but the Titus brothers could not confirm this.    \"I don't think anything serious happened to them, anyhow,\" said Job  Titus one day. \"And I should hate to think our work was responsible for  harm to any one.\"    \"Your rivals don't seem to be doing much to hamper you,\" observed Tom.  \"I guess Waddington gave up.    \"I won't be too sure of that,\" said Mr. Titus.    \"Why, what has happened?\" Tom asked.    \"Well, nothing down here--that is, directly--but we are meeting with  trouble on the financial end. The Peruvian government is holding back  payments.\"    \"Why is that?\"    \"They claim we are not as far advanced as we ought to be.\"    \"Aren't you?\"    \"Practically, yes. There was no set limit of work to be done for the  intermediate payments. We bonded ourselves to have the tunnel done at a  certain date.    \"If we fail, we lose a large sum, and if we get it done ahead of time  we get a big premium. There was no question as to completing a certain  amount of footage before we received certain payments. But Senor  Belasdo, the government representative, claims that we will not be done  in time, and therefore he is holding back money due us. I'm sure the  rival contractors have set him up to this, because he was always decent  to us before.    \"Another matter, too, makes me suspicious. We have"]]]
