I cannot increase my gift to you by so much as the value  of a halter.\" The burgher was delighted with this gift and bowed low,  expressing his thanks and gratitude. Then Erec mounts and takes his  leave, and they set out upon their way. As they ride, he frequently  warns Enide that if she sees anything she should not be so bold as to  speak to him about it. Meanwhile, there entered the house a hundred  knights well armed, and very much dismayed they were to find Erec no  longer there. Then the Count learned that the lady had deceived him. He  discovered the footsteps of the horses, and they all followed the trail,  the Count threatening Erec and vowing that, if he can come up with him,  nothing can keep him from having his head on the spot. \"A curse on  him who now hangs back, and does not spur on fast!\" quoth he; \"he who  presents me with the head of the knight whom I hate so bitterly, will  have served me to my taste.\" Then they plunge on at topmost speed,  filled with hostility toward him who had never laid eyes on them and had  never harmed them by deed or word. They ride ahead until they made him  out; at the edge of a forest they catch sight of him before he was hid  by the forest trees. Not one of them halted then, but all rushed on in  rivalry. Enide hears the clang and noise of their arms and horses, and  sees that the valley is full of them. As soon as she saw them, she could  not restrain her tongue. \"Ah, sire,\" she cries, \"alas, how this Count  has attacked you, when he leads against you such a host! Sire, ride  faster now, until we be within this wood. I think we can easily distance  them, for they are still a long way behind. If you go on at this pace,  you can never escape from death, for you are no match for them.\" Erec  replies: \"Little esteem you have for me, and lightly you hold my words.  It seems I cannot correct you by fair request. But as the Lord have  mercy upon me until I escape from here, I swear that you shall pay  dearly for this speech of yours; that is, unless my mind should change.\"  Then he straightway turns about, and sees the seneschal drawing near  upon a horse both strong and fleet. Before them all he takes his stand  at the distance of four cross-bow shots. He had not disposed of his  arms, but was thoroughly well equipped. Erec reckons up his opponents'  strength, and sees there are fully a hundred of them. Then he who thus  is pressing him thinks he had better call a hair. Then they ride to meet  each other, and strike upon each other's shield great blows with their  sharp and trenchant swords. Erec caused his stout steel sword to pierce  his body through and through, so that his shield and hauberk protected  him no more than a shred of dark-blue silk. And next the Count comes  spurring on, who, as the story tells, was a strong and doughty knight.  But the Count in this was ill advised when he came with only shield and  lance. He placed such trust in his own prowess that he thought that he  needed no other arms. He showed his exceeding boldness by rushing on  ahead of all his men more than the space of nine acres. When Erec saw  him stand alone, he turned toward him; the Count is not afraid of him,  and they come together with clash of arms. First the Count strikes him  with such violence upon the breast that he would have lost his stirrups  if he had not been well set. He makes the wood of his shield to split  so that the iron of his lance protrudes on the other side. But Erec's  hauberk was very solid and protected him from death without the tear  of a single mesh. The Count was strong and breaks his lance; then Erec  strikes him with such force on his yellow painted shield that he  ran more than a yard of his lance through his abdomen, knocking him  senseless from his steed. Then he turned and rode away without further  tarrying on the spot. Straight into the forest he spurs at full speed.  Now Erec is in the woods, and the others paused a while over those who  lay in the middle of the field. Loudly they swear and vow that they will  rather follow after him for two or three days than fail to capture and  slaughter him. The Count, though grievously wounded in the abdomen,  hears what they say. He draws himself up a little and opens his eyes a  tiny bit. Now he realises what an evil deed he had begun to execute. He  makes the knights step back, and says: \"My lords, I bid you all, both  strong and weak, high and low, that none of you be so bold as to dare  to advance a single step. All of you return now quickly! I have done  a villainous deed, and I repent me of my foul design. The lady who  outwitted me is very honourable, prudent, and courteous. Her beauty  fired me with love for her; because I desired her, I wished to kill her  lord and keep her back with me by force. I well deserved this woe, and  now it has come upon me. How abominably disloyal and treacherous I was  in my madness! Never was there a better knight born of mother than he.  Never shall he receive harm through me if I can in any way prevent it.  I command you all to retrace your steps.\" Back they go disconsolate,  carrying the lifeless seneschal on the shield reversed. The Count,  whose wound was not mortal, lived on for some time after. Thus was Erec  delivered.    (Vv. 3663-3930.) Erec goes off at full speed down a road between two  hedgerows--he and his wife with him. Both putting spurs to their  horses, they rode until they came to a meadow which had been mown. After  emerging from the hedged enclosure they came upon a drawbridge before a  high tower, which was all closed about with a wall and a broad and deep  moat. They quickly pass over the bridge, but had not gone far before the  lord of the place espied them from up in his tower. About this man I  can tell you the truth: that he was very small of stature, but very  courageous of heart. When he sees Erec cross the bridge, he comes down  quickly from his tower, and on a great sorrel steed of his he causes  a saddle to be placed, which showed portrayed a golden lion. Then he  orders to be brought his shield, his stiff, straight lance, a sharp  polished sword, his bright shining helmet, his gleaming hauberk, and  triple-woven greaves; for he has seen an armed knight pass before his  list against whom he wishes to strive in arms, or else this stranger  will strive against him until he shall confess defeat. His command  was quickly done: behold the horse now led forth; a squire brought him  around already bridled and with saddle on. Another fellow brings the  arms. The knight passed out through the gate, as quickly as possible,  all alone, without companion. Erec is riding along a hill-side, when  behold the knight comes tearing down over the top of the hill, mounted  upon a powerful steed which tore along at such a pace that he crushed  the stones beneath his hoofs finer than a millstone grinds the corn; and  bright gleaming sparks flew off in all directions, so that it seemed as  if his four feet were all ablaze with fire. Enide heard the noise and  commotion, and almost fell from her palfrey, helpless and in a faint.  There was no vein in her body in which the blood did not turn, and her  face became all pale and white as if she were a corpse. Great is her  despair and dismay, for she does not dare to address her lord, who often  threatens and chides at her and charges her to hold her peace. She is  distracted between two courses to pursue, whether to speak or to hold  her peace. She takes counsel with herself, and often she prepares to  speak, so that her tongue already moves, but the voice cannot issue  forth; for her teeth are clenched with fear, and thus shut up her speech  within. Thus she admonishes and reproaches herself, but she closes her  mouth and grits her teeth so that her speech cannot issue forth. At  strife with herself, she said: \"I am sure and certain that I shall incur  a grievous loss, if here I lose my lord. Shall I tell him all, then,  openly? Not I. Why not? I would not dare, for thus I should enrage my  lord. And if my lord's ire is once aroused, he will leave me in this  wild place alone, wretched and forlorn. Then I shall be worse off than  now. Worse off? What care I? May grief and sorrow always be mine as long  as I live, if my lord does not promptly escape from here without being  delivered to a violent death. But if I do not quickly inform him, this  knight who is spurring hither will have killed him before he is aware;  for he seems of very evil intent. I think I have waited too long from  fear of his vigorous prohibition. But I will no longer hesitate because  of his restraint. I see plainly that my lord is so deep in thought that  he forgets himself; so it is fight that I should address him.\" She  spoke to him. He threatens her, but has no desire to do her harm, for he  realises and knows full well that she loves him above all else, and  he loves her, too, to the utmost. He rides toward the knight, who  challenges him to battle, and they meet at the foot of the hill, where  they attack and defy each other. Both smite each other with their  iron-tipped lances with all their strength. The shields that hang about  their necks are not worth two coats of bark: the leather tears, and they  split the wood, and they shatter the meshes of the hauberks. Both are  pierced to the vitals by the lances, and the horses fall to earth. Now,  both the warriors were doughty. Grievously, but not mortally, wounded,  they quickly got upon their feet and grasped afresh their lances, which  were not broken nor the worse for wear. But they cast them away on the  ground, and drawing their swords from the scabbard, they attack each  other with great fury. Each wounds and injures the other, for there  is no mercy on either side. They deal such blows upon the helmets  that gleaming sparks fly out when their swords recoil. They split and  splinter "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/832"],[0,"Robin Hood (#16)"],[1," \"and let us see if your  greenwood tricks will avail you to-morrow.\"    \"I would that I had bold Robin's horn,\" muttered poor John; \"methinks  'tis all up with me even as the Sheriff hath spoken.\"    In good sooth the time was dire and pressing. The rope was placed around  the prisoner's neck and the men prepared to haul away.    \"Are you ready?\" called the Sheriff. \"One--two--\"    But before the \"three\" left his lips the faint sound of a silver bugle  came floating over the hill.    \"By my troth, that is Sir Guy of Gisborne's horn,\" quoth the Sheriff;  \"and he bade me not to delay answering its summons. He has caught Robin  Hood.\"    \"Pardon, Excellency,\" said one of his men; \"but if he has caught Robin  Hood, this is a merry day indeed. And let us save this fellow and build  another gallows and hang them both together.\"    \"That's a brave thought!\" said the Sheriff slapping his knee. \"Take the  rascal down and bind him fast to the gallows-tree against our return.\"    So Little John was made fast to the gallows-tree, while the Sheriff and  all his men who could march or hobble went out to get Robin Hood and  bring him in for the double hanging.    Let us leave talking of Little John and the Sheriff, and see what has  become of Robin Hood.    In the first place, he and Little John had come near having a quarrel  that self-same morning because both had seen a curious looking yeoman,  and each wanted to challenge him singly. But Robin would not give way to  his lieutenant, and that is why John, in a huff, had gone with Will to  Barnesdale.    Meanwhile Robin approached the curious looking stranger. He seemed to be  a three-legged creature at first sight, but on coming nearer you would  have seen that 'twas really naught but a poorly clad man, who for a  freak had covered up his rags with a capul-hide, nothing more nor less  than the sun-dried skin of a horse, complete with head, tail, and mane.  The skin of the head made a helmet; while the tail gave the curious  three-legged appearance.    \"Good-morrow, good fellow,\" said Robin cheerily, \"methinks by the bow  you bear in your hand that you should be a good archer.\"    \"Indifferent good,\" said the other returning his greeting; \"but 'tis not  of archery that I am thinking this morning, for I have lost my way and  would fain find it again.\"    \"By my faith, I could have believed 'twas your wits you'd lost!\" thought  Robin smiling. Then aloud: \"I'll lead you through the wood,\" quoth  he, \"an you will tell me your business. For belike your speech is much  gentler than your attire.\"    \"Who are you to ask me my business?\" asked the other roughly.    \"I am one of the King's Rangers,\" replied Robin, \"set here to guard his  deer against curious looking strollers.\"    \"Curious looking I may be,\" returned the other, \"but no stroller. Hark  ye, since you are a Ranger, I must e'en demand your service. I am on the  King's business and seek an outlaw. Men call him Robin Hood. Are you one  of his men?\"--eyeing him keenly.    \"Nay, God forbid!\" said Robin; \"but what want you with him?\"    \"That is another tale. But I'd rather meet with that proud outlaw than  forty good pounds of the King's money.\"    Robin now saw how the land lay.    \"Come with me, good yeoman,\" said he, \"and belike, a little later in the  day, I can show you Robin's haunts when he is at home. Meanwhile let us  have some pastime under the greenwood tree. Let us first try the mastery  at shooting arrows.\"    The other agreed, and they cut down two willow wands of a summer's  growth that grew beneath a brier, and set them up at a distance of  threescore yards.    \"Lead on, good fellow,\" quoth Robin. \"The first shot to you.\"    \"Nay, by my faith,\" said the other, \"I will follow your lead.\"    So Robin stepped forth and bent his bow carelessly and sent his  shaft whizzing toward the wand, missing it by a scant inch. He of the  horse-hide followed with more care yet was a good three-fingers' breadth  away. On the second round, the stranger led off and landed cleverly  within the small garland at the top of the wand; but Robin shot far  better and clave the wand itself, clean at the middle.    \"A blessing on your heart!\" shouted Capul-Hide; \"never saw I such  shooting as that! Belike you are better than Robin Hood himself. But you  have not yet told me your name.\"    \"Nay, by my faith,\" quoth Robin, \"I must keep it secret till you have  told me your own.\"    \"I do not disdain to tell it,\" said the other. \"I dwell by dale and  down, and to take bold Robin am I sworn. This would I tell him to his  face, were he not so great a craven. When I am called by my right name,  I am Guy of Gisborne.\"    This he said with a great show of pride, and he strutted back and forth,  forgetful that he had just been beaten at archery.    Robin eyed him quietly. \"Methinks I have heard of you elsewhere. Do you  not bring men to the gallows for a living?\"    \"Aye, but only outlaws such as Robin Hood.\"    \"But pray what harm has Robin Hood done you?\"    \"He is a highway robber,\" said Sir Guy, evading the question.    \"Has he ever taken from the rich that he did not give again to the  poor? Does he not protect the women and children and side with weak and  helpless? Is not his greatest crime the shooting of a few King's deer?\"    \"Have done with your sophistry,\" said Sir Guy impatiently. \"I am more  than ever of opinion that you are one of Robin's men yourself.\"    \"I have told you I am not,\" quoth Robin briefly. \"But if I am to help  you catch him, what is your plan?\"    \"Do you see this silver bugle?\" said the other. \"A long blast upon it  will summon the Sheriff and all his men, when once I have Robin within  my grasp. And if you show him to me, I'll give you the half of my forty  pounds reward.\"    \"I would not help hang a man for ten times forty pounds,\" said the  outlaw. \"Yet will I point out Robin to you for the reward I find at my  sword's point. I myself am Robin Hood of Sherwood and Barnesdale.\"    \"Then have at you!\" cried the other springing swiftly into action. His  sword leaped forth from beneath the horse's hide with the speed born of  long practice, and before Robin had come to guard, the other had smitten  at him full and foul. Robin eluded the lunge and drew his own weapon.    \"A scurvy trick!\" quoth he grimly, \"to strike at a man unprepared.\"    Then neither spoke more, but fell sternly to work--lunge and thrust and  ward and parry--for two full hours the weapons smote together sullenly,  and neither Robin Hood nor Sir Guy would yield an inch. I promise you  that if you could have looked forth on the fight from behind the trunk  of some friendly tree, you would have seen deadly sport such as few  men beheld in Sherwood Forest. For the fighters glared sullenly at each  other, the fires of hatred burning in their eyes. One was fighting for  his life; the other for a reward and the King's favor.    Still circled the bright blades swiftly in the air--now gleaming in the  peaceful sunlight--again hissing like maddened serpents. Neither had yet  touched the other, until Robin, in an unlucky moment, stumbled over  the projecting root of a tree; when Sir Guy, instead of giving him the  chance to recover himself, as any courteous knight would have done,  struck quickly at the falling man and wounded him in the left side.    \"Ah, dear Lady in Heaven,\" gasped Robin uttering his favorite prayer,  \"shield me now! 'Twas never a man's destiny to die before his day.\"    And adroitly he sprang up again, and came straight at the other with an  awkward but unexpected stroke. The knight had raised his weapon high to  give a final blow, when Robin reached beneath and across his guard.  One swift lunge, and Sir Guy of Gisborne staggered backward with a deep  groan, Robin's sword through his throat.    Robin looked at the slain man regretfully.    \"You did bring it upon yourself,\" said he; \"and traitor and hireling  though you were, I would not willingly have killed you.\"    He looked to his own wound. It was not serious, and he soon staunched  the blood and bound up the cut. Then he dragged the dead body into the  bushes, and took off the horse's hide and put it upon himself. He placed  his own cloak upon Sir Guy, and marked his face so none might tell who  had been slain. Robin's own figure and face were not unlike the other's.    Pulling the capul-hide well over himself, so that the helmet hid most  of his face, Robin seized the silver bugle and blew a long blast. It was  the blast that saved the life of Little John, over in Barnesdale, for  you and I have already seen how it caused the fond Sheriff to prick up  his ears and stay the hanging, and go scurrying up over the hill and  into the wood with his men in search of another victim.    In five-and-twenty minutes up came running a score of the Sheriff's best  archers.    \"Did you signal us, lording?\" they asked, approaching Robin.    \"Aye,\" said he, going to meet the puffing Sheriff.    \"What news, what news, Sir Guy?\" said that officer.    \"Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne had a fight; and he that wears Robin's  cloak lies under the covert yonder.\"    \"The best news I have heard in all my life!\" exclaimed the Sheriff  rubbing his hands. \"I would that we could have saved him for the  hanging--though I cannot now complain.\"    \"The hanging?\" repeated Robin.    \"Yes. This is our lucky day on the calendar. After you left me we  narrowly missed running one of the fellows--I believe 'twas Will  Scarlet--to earth; and another who came to his relief we were just about  to hang, when your horn blew.\"    \"Who was the other?\" asked the disguised outlaw.    \"Whom do you suppose?\" laughed the Sheriff. \"The best man in the  greenwood, next to Robin Hood himself--Little John, Reynold Greenleaf!\"  For the Sheriff could not forget the name Little John had borne under  his own roof at Nottingham.    \"Little John!\" thought Robin with a start. Verily that was a lucky  blast of the bugle! \"But I see you"]]]
