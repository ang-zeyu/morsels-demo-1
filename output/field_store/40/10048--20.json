[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8795"],[0,"The Divine Comedy (#16)"],[1," gently, and the moving of a wing  Perceiv'd, that moving shed ambrosial smell;  And then a voice: \"Blessed are they, whom grace  Doth so illume, that appetite in them  Exhaleth no inordinate desire,  Still hung'ring as the rule of temperance wills.\"          CANTO XXV    It was an hour, when he who climbs, had need  To walk uncrippled: for the sun had now  To Taurus the meridian circle left,  And to the Scorpion left the night.  As one  That makes no pause, but presses on his road,  Whate'er betide him, if some urgent need  Impel: so enter'd we upon our way,  One before other; for, but singly, none  That steep and narrow scale admits to climb.    E'en as the young stork lifteth up his wing  Through wish to fly, yet ventures not to quit  The nest, and drops it; so in me desire  Of questioning my guide arose, and fell,  Arriving even to the act, that marks  A man prepar'd for speech.  Him all our haste  Restrain'd not, but thus spake the sire belov'd:  Fear not to speed the shaft, that on thy lip  Stands trembling for its flight.  Encourag'd thus  I straight began: \"How there can leanness come,  Where is no want of nourishment to feed?\"    \"If thou,\" he answer'd, \"hadst remember'd thee,  How Meleager with the wasting brand  Wasted alike, by equal fires consum'd,  This would not trouble thee: and hadst thou thought,  How in the mirror your reflected form  With mimic motion vibrates, what now seems  Hard, had appear'd no harder than the pulp  Of summer fruit mature.  But that thy will  In certainty may find its full repose,  Lo Statius here! on him I call, and pray  That he would now be healer of thy wound.\"    \"If in thy presence I unfold to him  The secrets of heaven's vengeance, let me plead  Thine own injunction, to exculpate me.\"  So Statius answer'd, and forthwith began:  \"Attend my words, O son, and in thy mind  Receive them: so shall they be light to clear  The doubt thou offer'st. Blood, concocted well,  Which by the thirsty veins is ne'er imbib'd,  And rests as food superfluous, to be ta'en  From the replenish'd table, in the heart  Derives effectual virtue, that informs  The several human limbs, as being that,  Which passes through the veins itself to make them.  Yet more concocted it descends, where shame  Forbids to mention: and from thence distils  In natural vessel on another's blood.  Then each unite together, one dispos'd  T' endure, to act the other, through meet frame  Of its recipient mould: that being reach'd,  It 'gins to work, coagulating first;  Then vivifies what its own substance caus'd  To bear.  With animation now indued,  The active virtue (differing from a plant  No further, than that this is on the way  And at its limit that) continues yet  To operate, that now it moves, and feels,  As sea sponge clinging to the rock: and there  Assumes th' organic powers its seed convey'd.  'This is the period, son! at which the virtue,  That from the generating heart proceeds,  Is pliant and expansive; for each limb  Is in the heart by forgeful nature plann'd.  How babe of animal becomes, remains  For thy consid'ring.  At this point, more wise,  Than thou hast err'd, making the soul disjoin'd  From passive intellect, because he saw  No organ for the latter's use assign'd.    \"Open thy bosom to the truth that comes.  Know soon as in the embryo, to the brain,  Articulation is complete, then turns  The primal Mover with a smile of joy  On such great work of nature, and imbreathes  New spirit replete with virtue, that what here  Active it finds, to its own substance draws,  And forms an individual soul, that lives,  And feels, and bends reflective on itself.  And that thou less mayst marvel at the word,  Mark the sun's heat, how that to wine doth change,  Mix'd with the moisture filter'd through the vine.    \"When Lachesis hath spun the thread, the soul  Takes with her both the human and divine,  Memory, intelligence, and will, in act  Far keener than before, the other powers  Inactive all and mute.  No pause allow'd,  In wond'rous sort self-moving, to one strand  Of those, where the departed roam, she falls,  Here learns her destin'd path.  Soon as the place  Receives her, round the plastic virtue beams,  Distinct as in the living limbs before:  And as the air, when saturate with showers,  The casual beam refracting, decks itself  With many a hue; so here the ambient air  Weareth that form, which influence of the soul  Imprints on it; and like the flame, that where  The fire moves, thither follows, so henceforth  The new form on the spirit follows still:  Hence hath it semblance, and is shadow call'd,  With each sense even to the sight endued:  Hence speech is ours, hence laughter, tears, and sighs  Which thou mayst oft have witness'd on the mount  Th' obedient shadow fails not to present  Whatever varying passion moves within us.  And this the cause of what thou marvel'st at.\"    Now the last flexure of our way we reach'd,  And to the right hand turning, other care  Awaits us.  Here the rocky precipice  Hurls forth redundant flames, and from the rim  A blast upblown, with forcible rebuff  Driveth them back, sequester'd from its bound.    Behoov'd us, one by one, along the side,  That border'd on the void, to pass; and I  Fear'd on one hand the fire, on th' other fear'd  Headlong to fall: when thus th' instructor warn'd:  \"Strict rein must in this place direct the eyes.  A little swerving and the way is lost.\"    Then from the bosom of the burning mass,  \"O God of mercy!\" heard I sung; and felt  No less desire to turn.  And when I saw  Spirits along the flame proceeding, I  Between their footsteps and mine own was fain  To share by turns my view.  At the hymn's close  They shouted loud, \"I do not know a man;\"  Then in low voice again took up the strain,  Which once more ended, \"To the wood,\" they cried,  \"Ran Dian, and drave forth Callisto, stung  With Cytherea's poison:\" then return'd  Unto their song; then marry a pair extoll'd,  Who liv'd in virtue chastely, and the bands  Of wedded love.  Nor from that task, I ween,  Surcease they; whilesoe'er the scorching fire  Enclasps them.  Of such skill appliance needs  To medicine the wound, that healeth last.      CANTO XXVI    While singly thus along the rim we walk'd,  Oft the good master warn'd me: \"Look thou well.  Avail it that I caution thee.\"  The sun  Now all the western clime irradiate chang'd  From azure tinct to white; and, as I pass'd,  My passing shadow made the umber'd flame  Burn ruddier.  At so strange a sight I mark'd  That many a spirit marvel'd on his way.    This bred occasion first to speak of me,  \"He seems,\" said they, \"no insubstantial frame:\"  Then to obtain what certainty they might,  Stretch'd towards me, careful not to overpass  The burning pale.  \"O thou, who followest  The others, haply not more slow than they,  But mov'd by rev'rence, answer me, who burn  In thirst and fire: nor I alone, but these  All for thine answer do more thirst, than doth  Indian or Aethiop for the cooling stream.  Tell us, how is it that thou mak'st thyself  A wall against the sun, as thou not yet  Into th' inextricable toils of death  Hadst enter'd?\"  Thus spake one, and I had straight  Declar'd me, if attention had not turn'd  To new appearance.  Meeting these, there came,  Midway the burning path, a crowd, on whom  Earnestly gazing, from each part I view  The shadows all press forward, sev'rally  Each snatch a hasty kiss, and then away.  E'en so the emmets, 'mid their dusky troops,  Peer closely one at other, to spy out  Their mutual road perchance, and how they thrive.    That friendly greeting parted, ere dispatch  Of the first onward step, from either tribe  Loud clamour rises: those, who newly come,  Shout \"Sodom and Gomorrah!\" these, \"The cow  Pasiphae enter'd, that the beast she woo'd  Might rush unto her luxury.\"  Then as cranes,  That part towards the Riphaean mountains fly,  Part towards the Lybic sands, these to avoid  The ice, and those the sun; so hasteth off  One crowd, advances th' other; and resume  Their first song weeping, and their several shout.    Again drew near my side the very same,  Who had erewhile besought me, and their looks  Mark'd eagerness to listen.  I, who twice  Their will had noted, spake: \"O spirits secure,  Whene'er the time may be, of peaceful end!  My limbs, nor crude, nor in mature old age,  Have I left yonder: here they bear me, fed  With blood, and sinew-strung.  That I no more  May live in blindness, hence I tend aloft.  There is a dame on high, who wind for us  This grace, by which my mortal through your realm  I bear.  But may your utmost wish soon meet  Such full fruition, that the orb of heaven,  Fullest of love, and of most ample space,  Receive you, as ye tell (upon my page  Henceforth to stand recorded) who ye are,  And what this multitude, that at your backs  Have past behind us.\"  As one, mountain-bred,  Rugged and clownish, if some city's walls  He chance to enter, round him stares agape,  Confounded and struck dumb; e'en such appear'd  Each spirit.  But when rid of that amaze,  (Not long the inmate of a noble heart)  He, who before had question'd, thus resum'd:  \"O blessed, who, for death preparing, tak'st  Experience of our limits, in thy bark!  Their crime, who not with us proceed, was that,  For which, as he did triumph, Caesar heard  The snout of 'queen,' to taunt him.  Hence their cry  Of 'Sodom,' as they parted, to rebuke  Themselves, and aid the burning by their shame.  Our sinning was Hermaphrodite: but we,  Because the law of human kind we broke,  Following like beasts our vile concupiscence,  Hence parting from them, to our own disgrace  Record the name of her, by whom the beast  In bestial tire was acted.  Now our deeds  Thou know'st, and how we sinn'd.  If thou by name  Wouldst haply know us, time permits not now  To tell so much, nor can I.  Of myself  Learn what thou wishest.  Guinicelli I,  Who having truly sorrow'd ere my last,  Already cleanse me.\"  With such pious joy,  As the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8800"],[0,"An Index of The Divine Comedy (#16)"],[1,"each about the other wheels,  And murmuring cooes his fondness; thus saw I  One, of the other great and glorious prince,  With kindly greeting hail'd, extolling both  Their heavenly banqueting; but when an end  Was to their gratulation, silent, each,  Before me sat they down, so burning bright,  I could not look upon them.  Smiling then,  Beatrice spake: \"O life in glory shrin'd!\"  Who didst the largess of our kingly court  Set down with faithful pen! let now thy voice  Of hope the praises in this height resound.  For thou, who figur'st them in shapes, as clear,  As Jesus stood before thee, well can'st speak them.\"    \"Lift up thy head, and be thou strong in trust:  For that, which hither from the mortal world  Arriveth, must be ripen'd in our beam.\"    Such cheering accents from the second flame  Assur'd me; and mine eyes I lifted up  Unto the mountains that had bow'd them late  With over-heavy burden.  \"Sith our Liege  Wills of his grace that thou, or ere thy death,  In the most secret council, with his lords  Shouldst be confronted, so that having view'd  The glories of our court, thou mayst therewith  Thyself, and all who hear, invigorate  With hope, that leads to blissful end; declare,  What is that hope, how it doth flourish in thee,  And whence thou hadst it?\"  Thus proceeding still,  The second light: and she, whose gentle love  My soaring pennons in that lofty flight  Escorted, thus preventing me, rejoin'd:  Among her sons, not one more full of hope,  Hath the church militant: so 't is of him  Recorded in the sun, whose liberal orb  Enlighteneth all our tribe: and ere his term  Of warfare, hence permitted he is come,  From Egypt to Jerusalem, to see.  The other points, both which thou hast inquir'd,  Not for more knowledge, but that he may tell  How dear thou holdst the virtue, these to him  Leave I; for he may answer thee with ease,  And without boasting, so God give him grace.\"  Like to the scholar, practis'd in his task,  Who, willing to give proof of diligence,  Seconds his teacher gladly, \"Hope,\" said I,  \"Is of the joy to come a sure expectance,  Th' effect of grace divine and merit preceding.  This light from many a star visits my heart,  But flow'd to me the first from him, who sang  The songs of the Supreme, himself supreme  Among his tuneful brethren.  'Let all hope  In thee,' so speak his anthem, 'who have known  Thy name;' and with my faith who know not that?  From thee, the next, distilling from his spring,  In thine epistle, fell on me the drops  So plenteously, that I on others shower  The influence of their dew.\"  Whileas I spake,  A lamping, as of quick and vollied lightning,  Within the bosom of that mighty sheen,  Play'd tremulous; then forth these accents breath'd:  \"Love for the virtue which attended me  E'en to the palm, and issuing from the field,  Glows vigorous yet within me, and inspires  To ask of thee, whom also it delights;  What promise thou from hope in chief dost win.\"    \"Both scriptures, new and ancient,\" I reply'd;  \"Propose the mark (which even now I view)  For souls belov'd of God. Isaias saith,  That, in their own land, each one must be clad  In twofold vesture; and their proper lands this delicious life.  In terms more full,  And clearer far, thy brother hath set forth  This revelation to us, where he tells  Of the white raiment destin'd to the saints.\"  And, as the words were ending, from above,  \"They hope in thee,\" first heard we cried: whereto  Answer'd the carols all.  Amidst them next,  A light of so clear amplitude emerg'd,  That winter's month were but a single day,  Were such a crystal in the Cancer's sign.    Like as a virgin riseth up, and goes,  And enters on the mazes of the dance,  Though gay, yet innocent of worse intent,  Than to do fitting honour to the bride;  So I beheld the new effulgence come  Unto the other two, who in a ring  Wheel'd, as became their rapture.  In the dance  And in the song it mingled.  And the dame  Held on them fix'd her looks: e'en as the spouse  Silent and moveless.  \"This is he, who lay  Upon the bosom of our pelican:  This he, into whose keeping from the cross  The mighty charge was given.\"  Thus she spake,  Yet therefore naught the more remov'd her Sight  From marking them, or ere her words began,  Or when they clos'd.  As he, who looks intent,  And strives with searching ken, how he may see  The sun in his eclipse, and, through desire  Of seeing, loseth power of sight: so I  Peer'd on that last resplendence, while I heard:  \"Why dazzlest thou thine eyes in seeking that,  Which here abides not?  Earth my body is,  In earth: and shall be, with the rest, so long,  As till our number equal the decree  Of the Most High.  The two that have ascended,  In this our blessed cloister, shine alone  With the two garments.  So report below.\"    As when, for ease of labour, or to shun  Suspected peril at a whistle's breath,  The oars, erewhile dash'd frequent in the wave,  All rest; the flamy circle at that voice  So rested, and the mingling sound was still,  Which from the trinal band soft-breathing rose.  I turn'd, but ah! how trembled in my thought,  When, looking at my side again to see  Beatrice, I descried her not, although  Not distant, on the happy coast she stood.          CANTO XXVI    With dazzled eyes, whilst wond'ring I remain'd,  Forth of the beamy flame which dazzled me,  Issued a breath, that in attention mute  Detain'd me; and these words it spake: \"'T were well,  That, long as till thy vision, on my form  O'erspent, regain its virtue, with discourse  Thou compensate the brief delay.  Say then,  Beginning, to what point thy soul aspires:    \"And meanwhile rest assur'd, that sight in thee  Is but o'erpowered a space, not wholly quench'd:  Since thy fair guide and lovely, in her look  Hath potency, the like to that which dwelt  In Ananias' hand.\" I answering thus:  \"Be to mine eyes the remedy or late  Or early, at her pleasure; for they were  The gates, at which she enter'd, and did light  Her never dying fire.  My wishes here  Are centered; in this palace is the weal,  That Alpha and Omega, is to all  The lessons love can read me.\"  Yet again  The voice which had dispers'd my fear, when daz'd  With that excess, to converse urg'd, and spake:  \"Behooves thee sift more narrowly thy terms,  And say, who level'd at this scope thy bow.\"    \"Philosophy,\" said I, ''hath arguments,  And this place hath authority enough  'T' imprint in me such love: for, of constraint,  Good, inasmuch as we perceive the good,  Kindles our love, and in degree the more,  As it comprises more of goodness in 't.  The essence then, where such advantage is,  That each good, found without it, is naught else  But of his light the beam, must needs attract  The soul of each one, loving, who the truth  Discerns, on which this proof is built.  Such truth  Learn I from him, who shows me the first love  Of all intelligential substances  Eternal: from his voice I learn, whose word  Is truth, that of himself to Moses saith,  'I will make all my good before thee pass.'  Lastly from thee I learn, who chief proclaim'st,  E'en at the outset of thy heralding,  In mortal ears the mystery of heav'n.\"    \"Through human wisdom, and th' authority  Therewith agreeing,\" heard I answer'd, \"keep  The choicest of thy love for God.  But say,  If thou yet other cords within thee feel'st  That draw thee towards him; so that thou report  How many are the fangs, with which this love  Is grappled to thy soul.\"  I did not miss,  To what intent the eagle of our Lord  Had pointed his demand; yea noted well  Th' avowal, which he led to; and resum'd:  \"All grappling bonds, that knit the heart to God,  Confederate to make fast our clarity.  The being of the world, and mine own being,  The death which he endur'd that I should live,  And that, which all the faithful hope, as I do,  To the foremention'd lively knowledge join'd,  Have from the sea of ill love sav'd my bark,  And on the coast secur'd it of the right.  As for the leaves, that in the garden bloom,  My love for them is great, as is the good  Dealt by th' eternal hand, that tends them all.\"    I ended, and therewith a song most sweet  Rang through the spheres; and \"Holy, holy, holy,\"  Accordant with the rest my lady sang.  And as a sleep is broken and dispers'd  Through sharp encounter of the nimble light,  With the eye's spirit running forth to meet  The ray, from membrane on to the membrane urg'd;  And the upstartled wight loathes that he sees;  So, at his sudden waking, he misdeems  Of all around him, till assurance waits  On better judgment: thus the saintly came  Drove from before mine eyes the motes away,  With the resplendence of her own, that cast  Their brightness downward, thousand miles below.  Whence I my vision, clearer shall before,  Recover'd; and, well nigh astounded, ask'd  Of a fourth light, that now with us I saw.    And Beatrice: \"The first diving soul,  That ever the first virtue fram'd, admires  Within these rays his Maker.\"  Like the leaf,  That bows its lithe top till the blast is blown;  By its own virtue rear'd then stands aloof;  So I, the whilst she said, awe-stricken bow'd.  Then eagerness to speak embolden'd me;  And I began: \"O fruit! that wast alone  Mature, when first engender'd!  Ancient father!  That doubly seest in every wedded bride  Thy daughter by affinity and blood!  Devoutly as I may, I pray thee hold  Converse with me: my will thou seest; and I,  More speedily to hear thee, tell it not.\"    It chanceth oft some animal bewrays,  Through the sleek cov'ring of his furry coat.  The fondness, that stirs in him and conforms  His outside seeming to the cheer within:  And in like guise was Adam's spirit mov'd  To joyous mood, that through the covering shone,  Transparent, when to pleasure me it spake:  \"No need thy will be told, which I untold  Better discern, than thou whatever thing  Thou holdst most certain: for that will I see  In Him, who is truth's mirror, and Himself  Parhelion"]]]
