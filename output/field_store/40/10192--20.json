The only fun of being  a Christian was that a man was not left alone with the Inner Light,  but definitely recognized an outer light, fair as the sun, clear as  the moon, terrible as an army with banners.         All the same, it will be as well if Jones does not worship the sun  and moon.  If he does, there is a tendency for him to imitate them;  to say, that because the sun burns insects alive, he may burn  insects alive.  He thinks that because the sun gives people sun-stroke,  he may give his neighbour measles.  He thinks that because the moon  is said to drive men mad, he may drive his wife mad.  This ugly side  of mere external optimism had also shown itself in the ancient world.  About the time when the Stoic idealism had begun to show the  weaknesses of pessimism, the old nature worship of the ancients had  begun to show the enormous weaknesses of optimism.  Nature worship  is natural enough while the society is young, or, in other words,  Pantheism is all right as long as it is the worship of Pan.  But Nature has another side which experience and sin are not slow  in finding out, and it is no flippancy to say of the god Pan that he  soon showed the cloven hoof.  The only objection to Natural Religion  is that somehow it always becomes unnatural.  A man loves Nature  in the morning for her innocence and amiability, and at nightfall,  if he is loving her still, it is for her darkness and her cruelty.  He washes at dawn in clear water as did the Wise Man of the Stoics,  yet, somehow at the dark end of the day, he is bathing in hot  bull's blood, as did Julian the Apostate.  The mere pursuit of  health always leads to something unhealthy.  Physical nature must  not be made the direct object of obedience; it must be enjoyed,  not worshipped.  Stars and mountains must not be taken seriously.  If they are, we end where the pagan nature worship ended.  Because the earth is kind, we can imitate all her cruelties.  Because sexuality is sane, we can all go mad about sexuality.  Mere optimism had reached its insane and appropriate termination.  The theory that everything was good had become an orgy of everything  that was bad.         On the other side our idealist pessimists were represented  by the old remnant of the Stoics.  Marcus Aurelius and his friends  had really given up the idea of any god in the universe and looked  only to the god within.  They had no hope of any virtue in nature,  and hardly any hope of any virtue in society.  They had not enough  interest in the outer world really to wreck or revolutionise it.  They did not love the city enough to set fire to it.  Thus the  ancient world was exactly in our own desolate dilemma.  The only  people who really enjoyed this world were busy breaking it up;  and the virtuous people did not care enough about them to knock  them down.  In this dilemma (the same as ours) Christianity suddenly  stepped in and offered a singular answer, which the world eventually  accepted as THE answer.  It was the answer then, and I think it is  the answer now.         This answer was like the slash of a sword; it sundered;  it did not in any sense sentimentally unite.  Briefly, it divided  God from the cosmos.  That transcendence and distinctness of the  deity which some Christians now want to remove from Christianity,  was really the only reason why any one wanted to be a Christian.  It was the whole point of the Christian answer to the unhappy pessimist  and the still more unhappy optimist.  As I am here only concerned  with their particular problem, I shall indicate only briefly this  great metaphysical suggestion.  All descriptions of the creating  or sustaining principle in things must be metaphorical, because they  must be verbal.  Thus the pantheist is forced to speak of God  in all things as if he were in a box.  Thus the evolutionist has,  in his very name, the idea of being unrolled like a carpet.  All terms, religious and irreligious, are open to this charge.  The only question is whether all terms are useless, or whether one can,  with such a phrase, cover a distinct IDEA about the origin of things.  I think one can, and so evidently does the evolutionist, or he would  not talk about evolution.  And the root phrase for all Christian  theism was this, that God was a creator, as an artist is a creator.  A poet is so separate from his poem that he himself speaks of it  as a little thing he has \"thrown off.\"  Even in giving it forth he  has flung it away.  This principle that all creation and procreation  is a breaking off is at least as consistent through the cosmos as the  evolutionary principle that all growth is a branching out.  A woman  loses a child even in having a child.  All creation is separation.  Birth is as solemn a parting as death.         It was the prime philosophic principle of Christianity that  this divorce in the divine act of making (such as severs the poet  from the poem or the mother from the new-born child) was the true  description of the act whereby the absolute energy made the world.  According to most philosophers, God in making the world enslaved it.  According to Christianity, in making it, He set it free.  God had written, not so much a poem, but rather a play; a play he  had planned as perfect, but which had necessarily been left to human  actors and stage-managers, who had since made a great mess of it.  I will discuss the truth of this theorem later.  Here I have only  to point out with what a startling smoothness it passed the dilemma  we have discussed in this chapter.  In this way at least one could  be both happy and indignant without degrading one's self to be either  a pessimist or an optimist.  On this system one could fight all  the forces of existence without deserting the flag of existence.  One could be at peace with the universe and yet be at war with  the world.  St. George could still fight the dragon, however big  the monster bulked in the cosmos, though he were bigger than the  mighty cities or bigger than the everlasting hills.  If he were as  big as the world he could yet be killed in the name of the world.  St. George had not to consider any obvious odds or proportions in  the scale of things, but only the original secret of their design.  He can shake his sword at the dragon, even if it is everything;  even if the empty heavens over his head are only the huge arch of its  open jaws.         And then followed an experience impossible to describe.  It was as if I had been blundering about since my birth with two  huge and unmanageable machines, of different shapes and without  apparent connection--the world and the Christian tradition.  I had found this hole in the world:  the fact that one must  somehow find a way of loving the world without trusting it;  somehow one must love the world without being worldly.  I found this  projecting feature of Christian theology, like a sort of hard spike,  the dogmatic insistence that God was personal, and had made a world  separate from Himself.  The spike of dogma fitted exactly into  the hole in the world--it had evidently been meant to go there--  and then the strange thing began to happen.  When once these two  parts of the two machines had come together, one after another,  all the other parts fitted and fell in with an eerie exactitude.  I could hear bolt after bolt over all the machinery falling  into its place with a kind of click of relief.  Having got one  part right, all the other parts were repeating that rectitude,  as clock after clock strikes noon.  Instinct after instinct was  answered by doctrine after doctrine.  Or, to vary the metaphor,  I was like one who had advanced into a hostile country to take  one high fortress.  And when that fort had fallen the whole country  surrendered and turned solid behind me.  The whole land was lit up,  as it were, back to the first fields of my childhood.  All those blind  fancies of boyhood which in the fourth chapter I have tried in vain  to trace on the darkness, became suddenly transparent and sane.  I was right when I felt that roses were red by some sort of choice:  it was the divine choice.  I was right when I felt that I would  almost rather say that grass was the wrong colour than say it must  by necessity have been that colour:  it might verily have been  any other.  My sense that happiness hung on the crazy thread of a  condition did mean something when all was said:  it meant the whole  doctrine of the Fall.  Even those dim and shapeless monsters of  notions which I have not been able to describe, much less defend,  stepped quietly into their places like colossal caryatides  of the creed.  The fancy that the cosmos was not vast and void,  but small and cosy, had a fulfilled significance now, for anything  that is a work of art must be small in the sight of the artist;  to God the stars might be only small and dear, like diamonds.  And my haunting instinct that somehow good was not merely a tool to  be used, but a relic to be guarded, like the goods from Crusoe's ship--  even that had been the wild whisper of something originally wise, for,  according to Christianity, we were indeed the survivors of a wreck,  the crew of a golden ship that had gone down before the beginning of  the world.         But the important matter was this, that it entirely reversed  the reason for optimism.  And the instant the reversal was made it  felt like the abrupt ease when a bone is put back in the socket.  I had often called myself an optimist, to avoid the too evident  blasphemy of pessimism.  But all the optimism of the age had been  false and disheartening for this reason, that it had always been  trying to prove that we fit in to the world.  The Christian  optimism is based on the fact that we do NOT fit in to the world.

Since my husband's been gone what would have become of  Fay and me but for you? It was about Fay that I wanted to speak to you.  This time I thought surely I'd die, and I was worried about Fay. Well,  I'll be around all right shortly, but my strength's gone and I won't  live long. So I may as well speak now. You remember you've been asking  me to let you take Fay and bring her up as your daughter?\"    \"Indeed yes, I remember. I'll be happy to have her. But I hope the  day--\"    \"Never mind that. The day'll come--sooner or later. I refused your  offer, and now I'll tell you why.\"    \"I know why,\" interposed Jane. \"It's because you don't want her brought  up as a Mormon.\"    \"No, it wasn't altogether that.\" Mrs. Larkin raised her thin hand and  laid it appealingly on Jane's. \"I don't like to tell you. But--it's  this: I told all my friends what you wanted. They know you, care for  you, and they said for me to trust Fay to you. Women will talk, you  know. It got to the ears of Mormons--gossip of your love for Fay and  your wanting her. And it came straight back to me, in jealousy, perhaps,  that you wouldn't take Fay as much for love of her as because of your  religious duty to bring up another girl for some Mormon to marry.\"    \"That's a damnable lie!\" cried Jane Withersteen.    \"It was what made me hesitate,\" went on Mrs. Larkin, \"but I never  believed it at heart. And now I guess I'll let you--\"    \"Wait! Mrs. Larkin, I may have told little white lies in my life, but  never a lie that mattered, that hurt any one. Now believe me. I love  little Fay. If I had her near me I'd grow to worship her. When I asked  for her I thought only of that love.... Let me prove this. You and Fay  come to live with me. I've such a big house, and I'm so lonely. I'll  help nurse you, take care of you. When you're better you can work for  me. I'll keep little Fay and bring her up--without Mormon teaching.  When she's grown, if she should want to leave me, I'll send her, and not  empty-handed, back to Illinois where you came from. I promise you.\"    \"I knew it was a lie,\" replied the mother, and she sank back upon  her pillow with something of peace in her white, worn face. \"Jane  Withersteen, may Heaven bless you! I've been deeply grateful to you. But  because you're a Mormon I never felt close to you till now. I don't know  much about religion as religion, but your God and my God are the same.\"        CHAPTER VIII. SURPRISE VALLEY    Back in that strange canyon, which Venters had found indeed a valley of  surprises, the wounded girl's whispered appeal, almost a prayer, not to  take her back to the rustlers crowned the events of the last few days  with a confounding climax. That she should not want to return to them  staggered Venters. Presently, as logical thought returned, her appeal  confirmed his first impression--that she was more unfortunate than  bad--and he experienced a sensation of gladness. If he had known before  that Oldring's Masked Rider was a woman his opinion would have been  formed and he would have considered her abandoned. But his first  knowledge had come when he lifted a white face quivering in a convulsion  of agony; he had heard God's name whispered by blood-stained lips;  through her solemn and awful eyes he had caught a glimpse  of her soul. And just now had come the entreaty to him,  \"Don't--take--me--back--there!\"    Once for all Venters's quick mind formed a permanent conception of this  poor girl. He based it, not upon what the chances of life had made her,  but upon the revelation of dark eyes that pierced the infinite, upon a  few pitiful, halting words that betrayed failure and wrong and misery,  yet breathed the truth of a tragic fate rather than a natural leaning to  evil.    \"What's your name?\" he inquired.    \"Bess,\" she answered.    \"Bess what?\"    \"That's enough--just Bess.\"    The red that deepened in her cheeks was not all the flush of fever.  Venters marveled anew, and this time at the tint of shame in her face,  at the momentary drooping of long lashes. She might be a rustler's girl,  but she was still capable of shame, she might be dying, but she still  clung to some little remnant of honor.    \"Very well, Bess. It doesn't matter,\" he said. \"But this matters--what  shall I do with you?\"    \"Are--you--a rider?\" she whispered.    \"Not now. I was once. I drove the Withersteen herds. But I lost my  place--lost all I owned--and now I'm--I'm a sort of outcast. My name's  Bern Venters.\"    \"You won't--take me--to Cottonwoods--or Glaze? I'd be--hanged.\"    \"No, indeed. But I must do something with you. For it's not safe for  me here. I shot that rustler who was with you. Sooner or later he'll  be found, and then my tracks. I must find a safer hiding-place where I  can't be trailed.\"    \"Leave me--here.\"    \"Alone--to die!\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I will not.\" Venters spoke shortly with a kind of ring in his voice.    \"What--do you want--to do--with me?\" Her whispering grew difficult, so  low and faint that Venters had to stoop to hear her.    \"Why, let's see,\" he replied, slowly. \"I'd like to take you some place  where I could watch by you, nurse you, till you're all right.\"    \"And--then?\"    \"Well, it'll be time to think of that when you're cured of your wound.  It's a bad one. And--Bess, if you don't want to live--if you don't fight  for life--you'll never--\"    \"Oh! I want--to live! I'm afraid--to die. But I'd rather--die--than go  back--to--to--\"    \"To Oldring?\" asked Venters, interrupting her in turn.    Her lips moved in an affirmative.    \"I promise not to take you back to him or to Cottonwoods or to Glaze.\"    The mournful earnestness of her gaze suddenly shone with unutterable  gratitude and wonder. And as suddenly Venters found her eyes beautiful  as he had never seen or felt beauty. They were as dark blue as the sky  at night. Then the flashing changed to a long, thoughtful look, in which  there was a wistful, unconscious searching of his face, a look that  trembled on the verge of hope and trust.    \"I'll try--to live,\" she said. The broken whisper just reached his ears.  \"Do what--you want--with me.\"    \"Rest then--don't worry--sleep,\" he replied.    Abruptly he arose, as if words had been decision for him, and with a  sharp command to the dogs he strode from the camp. Venters was conscious  of an indefinite conflict of change within him. It seemed to be a  vague passing of old moods, a dim coalescing of new forces, a moment of  inexplicable transition. He was both cast down and uplifted. He wanted  to think and think of the meaning, but he resolutely dispelled emotion.  His imperative need at present was to find a safe retreat, and this  called for action.    So he set out. It still wanted several hours before dark. This trip he  turned to the left and wended his skulking way southward a mile or more  to the opening of the valley, where lay the strange scrawled rocks. He  did not, however, venture boldly out into the open sage, but clung to  the right-hand wall and went along that till its perpendicular line  broke into the long incline of bare stone.    Before proceeding farther he halted, studying the strange character of  this slope and realizing that a moving black object could be seen far  against such background. Before him ascended a gradual swell of smooth  stone. It was hard, polished, and full of pockets worn by centuries  of eddying rain-water. A hundred yards up began a line of grotesque  cedar-trees, and they extended along the slope clear to its most  southerly end. Beyond that end Venters wanted to get, and he concluded  the cedars, few as they were, would afford some cover.    Therefore he climbed swiftly. The trees were farther up than he  had estimated, though he had from long habit made allowance for the  deceiving nature of distances in that country. When he gained the cover  of cedars he paused to rest and look, and it was then he saw how the  trees sprang from holes in the bare rock. Ages of rain had run down the  slope, circling, eddying in depressions, wearing deep round holes.  There had been dry seasons, accumulations of dust, wind-blown seeds, and  cedars rose wonderfully out of solid rock. But these were not beautiful  cedars. They were gnarled, twisted into weird contortions, as if growth  were torture, dead at the tops, shrunken, gray, and old. Theirs had  been a bitter fight, and Venters felt a strange sympathy for them. This  country was hard on trees--and men.    He slipped from cedar to cedar, keeping them between him and the open  valley. As he progressed, the belt of trees widened and he kept to its  upper margin. He passed shady pockets half full of water, and, as he  marked the location for possible future need, he reflected that there  had been no rain since the winter snows. From one of these shady holes a  rabbit hopped out and squatted down, laying its ears flat.    Venters wanted fresh meat now more than when he had only himself to  think of. But it would not do to fire his rifle there. So he broke off  a cedar branch and threw it. He crippled the rabbit, which started to  flounder up the slope. Venters did not wish to lose the meat, and  he never allowed crippled game to escape, to die lingeringly in some  covert. So after a careful glance below, and back toward the canyon, he  began to chase the rabbit.    The fact that rabbits generally ran uphill was not new to him. But  it presently seemed singular why this rabbit, that might have escaped  downward, chose to ascend the slope. Venters knew then that it had a  burrow higher up. More than once he jerked over to seize it, only in  vain, for the rabbit by renewed effort eluded his grasp. Thus the chase  continued on up the bare slope. The farther Venters climbed the more  determined he grew to catch his quarry. At last, panting and sweating,  he captured the rabbit at the foot of a steeper grade. Laying his rifle "]]]
