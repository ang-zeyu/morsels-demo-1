I ain' going  to trouble yu' long. In admittin' yourself to be a liar you have spoke  God's truth for onced. Honey Wiggin, you and me and the boys have hit  town too frequent for any of us to play Sunday on the balance of  the gang.\" He stopped and surveyed Public Opinion, seated around in  carefully inexpressive attention. \"We ain't a Christian outfit a little  bit, and maybe we have most forgotten what decency feels like. But I  reckon we haven't forgot what it means. You can sit down now, if you  want.\"    The liar stood and sneered experimentally, looking at Public Opinion.  But this changeful deity was no longer with him, and he heard it  variously assenting, \"That's so,\" and \"She's a lady,\" and otherwise  excellently moralizing. So he held his peace. When, however, the  Virginian had departed to the roasting steer, and Public Opinion relaxed  into that comfort which we all experience when the sermon ends, Trampas  sat down amid the reviving cheerfulness, and ventured again to be  facetious.    \"Shut your rank mouth,\" said Wiggin to him, amiably. \"I don't care  whether he knows her or if he done it on principle. I'll accept the  roundin' up he gave us--and say! You'll swallo' your dose, too! Us  boys'll stand in with him in this.\"    So Trampas swallowed. And what of the Virginian?    He had championed the feeble, and spoken honorably in meeting, and  according to all the constitutions and by-laws of morality, he should  have been walking in virtue's especial calm. But there it was! he had  spoken; he had given them a peep through the key-hole at his inner  man; and as he prowled away from the assemblage before whom he stood  convicted of decency, it was vicious rather than virtuous that he felt.  Other matters also disquieted him--so Lin McLean was hanging round that  schoolmarm! Yet he joined Ben Swinton in a seemingly Christian spirit.  He took some whiskey and praised the size of the barrel, speaking with  his host like this: \"There cert'nly ain' goin' to be trouble about a  second helpin'.\"    \"Hope not. We'd ought to have more trimmings, though. We're shy on  ducks.\"    \"Yu' have the barrel. Has Lin McLean seen that?\"    \"No. We tried for ducks away down as far as the Laparel outfit. A real  barbecue--\"    \"There's large thirsts on Bear Creek. Lin McLean will pass on ducks.\"    \"Lin's not thirsty this month.\"    \"Signed for one month, has he?\"    \"Signed! He's spooning our schoolmarm!\"    \"They claim she's a right sweet-faced girl.\"    \"Yes; yes; awful agreeable. And next thing you're fooled clean through.\"    \"Yu' don't say!\"    \"She keeps a-teaching the darned kids, and it seems like a good  growed-up man can't interest her.\"    \"YU' DON'T SAY!\"    \"There used to be all the ducks you wanted at the Laparel, but their  fool cook's dead stuck on raising turkeys this year.\"    \"That must have been mighty close to a drowndin' the schoolmarm got at  South Fork.\"    \"Why, I guess not. When? She's never spoken of any such thing--that I've  heard.\"    \"Mos' likely the stage-driver got it wrong, then.\"    \"Yes. Must have drownded somebody else. Here they come! That's her  ridin' the horse. There's the Westfalls. Where are you running to?\"    \"To fix up. Got any soap around hyeh?\"    \"Yes,\" shouted Swinton, for the Virginian was now some distance away;  \"towels and everything in the dugout.\" And he went to welcome his first  formal guests.    The Virginian reached his saddle under a shed. \"So she's never mentioned  it,\" said he, untying his slicker for the trousers and scarf. \"I  didn't notice Lin anywheres around her.\" He was over in the dugout now,  whipping off his overalls; and soon he was excellently clean and ready,  except for the tie in his scarf and the part in his hair. \"I'd have  knowed her in Greenland,\" he remarked. He held the candle up and down at  the looking-glass, and the looking-glass up and down at his head. \"It's  mighty strange why she ain't mentioned that.\" He worried the scarf a  fold or two further, and at length, a trifle more than satisfied with  his appearance, he proceeded most serenely toward the sound of the  tuning fiddles. He passed through the store-room behind the kitchen,  stepping lightly lest he should rouse the ten or twelve babies that lay  on the table or beneath it. On Bear Creek babies and children always  went with their parents to a dance, because nurses were unknown. So  little Alfred and Christopher lay there among the wraps, parallel and  crosswise with little Taylors, and little Carmodys, and Lees, and all  the Bear Creek offspring that was not yet able to skip at large and  hamper its indulgent elders in the ball-room.    \"Why, Lin ain't hyeh yet!\" said the Virginian, looking in upon the  people. There was Miss Wood, standing up for the quadrille. \"I didn't  remember her hair was that pretty,\" said he. \"But ain't she a little,  little girl!\"    Now she was in truth five feet three; but then he could look away down  on the top of her head.    \"Salute your honey!\" called the first fiddler. All partners bowed to  each other, and as she turned, Miss Wood saw the man in the doorway.  Again, as it had been at South Fork that day, his eyes dropped from  hers, and she divining instantly why he had come after half a year,  thought of the handkerchief and of that scream of hers in the river, and  became filled with tyranny and anticipation; for indeed he was fine to  look upon. So she danced away, carefully unaware of his existence.    \"First lady, centre!\" said her partner, reminding her of her turn. \"Have  you forgotten how it goes since last time?\"    Molly Wood did not forget again, but quadrilled with the most sprightly  devotion.    \"I see some new faces to-night,\" said she, presently.    \"Yu' always do forget our poor faces,\" said her partner.    \"Oh, no! There's a stranger now. Who is that black man?\"    \"Well--he's from Virginia, and he ain't allowin' he's black.\"    \"He's a tenderfoot, I suppose?\"    \"Ha, ha, ha! That's rich, too!\" and so the simple partner explained a  great deal about the Virginian to Molly Wood. At the end of the set she  saw the man by the door take a step in her direction.    \"Oh,\" said she, quickly, to the partner, \"how warm it is! I must see  how those babies are doing.\" And she passed the Virginian in a breeze of  unconcern.    His eyes gravely lingered where she had gone. \"She knowed me right  away,\" said he. He looked for a moment, then leaned against the door.  \"'How warm it is!' said she. Well, it ain't so screechin' hot hyeh; and  as for rushin' after Alfred and Christopher, when their natural motheh  is bumpin' around handy--she cert'nly can't be offended?\" he broke  off, and looked again where she had gone. And then Miss Wood passed him  brightly again, and was dancing the schottische almost immediately.  \"Oh, yes, she knows me,\" the swarthy cow-puncher mused. \"She has to  take trouble not to see me. And what she's a-fussin' at is mighty  interestin'. Hello!\"    \"Hello!\" returned Lin McLean, sourly. He had just looked into the  kitchen.    \"Not dancin'?\" the Southerner inquired.    \"Don't know how.\"    \"Had scyarlet fever and forgot your past life?\"    Lin grinned.    \"Better persuade the schoolmarm to learn it. She's goin' to give me  instruction.\"    \"Huh!\" went Mr. McLean, and skulked out to the barrel.    \"Why, they claimed you weren't drinkin' this month!\" said his friend,  following.    \"Well, I am. Here's luck!\" The two pledged in tin cups. \"But I'm not  waltzin' with her,\" blurted Mr. McLean grievously. \"She called me an  exception.\"    \"Waltzin',\" repeated the Virginian quickly, and hearing the fiddles he  hastened away.    Few in the Bear Creek Country could waltz, and with these few it  was mostly an unsteered and ponderous exhibition; therefore was the  Southerner bent upon profiting by his skill. He entered the room,  and his lady saw him come where she sat alone for the moment, and her  thoughts grew a little hurried.    \"Will you try a turn, ma'am?\"    \"I beg your pardon?\" It was a remote, well-schooled eye that she lifted  now upon him.    \"If you like a waltz, ma'am, will you waltz with me?\"    \"You're from Virginia, I understand?\" said Molly Wood, regarding him  politely, but not rising. One gains authority immensely by keeping one's  seat. All good teachers know this.    \"Yes, ma'am, from Virginia.\"    \"I've heard that Southerners have such good manners.\"    \"That's correct.\" The cow-puncher flushed, but he spoke in his  unvaryingly gentle voice.    \"For in New England, you know,\" pursued Miss Molly, noting his scarf and  clean-shaven chin, and then again steadily meeting his eye, \"gentlemen  ask to be presented to ladies before they ask them to waltz.\"    He stood a moment before her, deeper and deeper scarlet; and the more  she saw his handsome face, the keener rose her excitement. She waited  for him to speak of the river; for then she was going to be surprised,  and gradually to remember, and finally to be very nice to him. But he  did not wait. \"I ask your pardon, lady,\" said he, and bowing, walked  off, leaving her at once afraid that he might not come back. But she had  altogether mistaken her man. Back he came serenely with Mr. Taylor, and  was duly presented to her. Thus were the conventions vindicated.    It can never be known what the cow-puncher was going to say next; for  Uncle Hughey stepped up with a glass of water which he had left Wood to  bring, and asking for a turn, most graciously received it. She danced  away from a situation where she began to feel herself getting the  worst of it. One moment the Virginian stared at his lady as she lightly  circulated, and then he went out to the barrel.    Leave him for Uncle Hershey! Jealousy is a deep and delicate thing, and  works its spite in many ways. The Virginian had been ready to look at  Lin McLean with a hostile eye; but finding him now beside the barrel, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12982"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science — Volume 1, No. (#17)"],[1,"dispatches were laconic, but not the less striking on that account.  Once or twice they were couched in concise couplets. His brevity  was laid aside when he addressed his soldiers. It was his custom to  harangue them at great length, sometimes even for two hours at a time,  and in the very depth of winter.        \"I remember,\" says M. de Guillaumanches, \"that one day, in the      month of January, he took it into his head to harangue a body      of 10,000 men drawn up on parade at Varsovia. It was bitterly      cold, and a freezing hoar frost came down from the sky. The      marshal, in a waistcoat of white dimity, began his usual      harangue. He soon found that the coldness of the weather      made it seem long; accordingly, he stretched it to two hours.      Almost all the generals, officers, and soldiers caught cold.      The marshal was nothing the worse, and was even gayer than      usual. His quarters rang with continued fits of coughing,      and he seemed to enjoy hearing it. He had the satisfaction of      thinking that he had taught his army to disregard fatigue, and      winter with all its frosts.\"    M. de Guillaumanches speaks of the veneration which Suwarrow had for  the ministers of his religion. He would often stop a priest on the  road to implore his blessing. He loved to take part in their religious  services and to join in their chants; but it is on the goodness of his  heart that his biographer most delights to dwell. He tells us, \"he was  a kind relation, a sincere friend, and an affectionate father.\" In the  midst of all his triumphs, it has been said that he was touched with  pity and with sorrow for suffering humanity. \"I asked him,\" says Mr.  Tweddel, \"if after the massacre of Ismail he was perfectly satisfied  with the conduct of the day. He said, he went home and wept in his  tent.\" Though Suwarrow spared but little time from his military  avocation for social intercourse, his tenderness for children was so  great that he could not bear to pass them without notice. He would  stop, embrace, and bless them whenever he met them: that he fondly  loved his own is sufficiently proved by the following anecdote:--    While on his way to join the army, thoughts of home were in his mind.  He felt it might be long before he should see it in, if indeed, he  _should ever_ see it. He was seized with the most intense longing to  look on his children once more. The desire became so irresistible,  that he turned from the road he was traversing, and took that to  Moscow. He rested neither day nor night till he got there. It was the  middle of the night when he reached his house; he sprang lightly from  his carriage, and knocked gently at the door. All the family were  asleep. At length he was heard by one of the domestics, and let in. He  stole on tiptoe to his children's room, and, withdrawing the curtains  cautiously, for fear of disturbing them, bent over them; and, as he  gazed on them in delight, they slept on, unconscious of their midnight  visitor. Then throwing his arms gently over them, he held them for a  moment in his fond embrace and left them a father's blessing, and then  went away to join his troops.    After the death of Catharine, in the year 1796, there was a sad change  in the fortunes of her faithful soldier. He served her successor with  the same heroic devotion with which he had promoted her interest and  glory. In 1799 he effected one of the most brilliant retreats that  stand in the annals of history. Opposed in Italy by Moreau with an  overwhelming force, when a retreat was resolved on he was so afflicted  that he wrung his hands and wept bitterly. He led his troops over the  heights of Switzerland into Germany with such consummate skill and  undaunted energy as added fresh honors to his name. The dangers and  difficulties of this memorable operation were such as would have  been considered absolutely insurmountable by one less daring, and a  commander less beloved could never have encouraged his troops to hold  out against surrender. But they followed him in the midst of winter  snows, through unknown and intricate paths and deep ravines; sometimes  passing in what haste they could along the edge of frightful chasms  and awful precipices, such as the weary traveler would tremble but to  look at. Here they were frequently exposed to the fire of the enemy,  who lay in ambush among the rocks, and ofttimes had to fight their way  at the point of the bayonet. But still, even in retreat victorious,  he achieved his object, and never yielded to the foe. He is the  only general, it is stated, except Marlborough and Wellington, who  was never defeated. The title of Prince Italisky was conferred to  commemorate the glory of his having led his army unconquered in his  retreat from Italy. He died the next year at St. Petersburgh. A broken  heart was alleged by many to have been the fatal disease which ended  his days. The indomitable spirit which is proof against danger, toil,  and privation, may yet be borne down by the stings of ingratitude. The  death of Suwarrow, so soon following his recall, and the indignities  which he received at the hands of the emperor, tells in itself a tale  of outraged feeling that needs no comment. It has been truly said  that ridicule is more bitterly resented and more rarely forgiven than  injury. The indulgence of a satiric humor, in some words spoken in  jest by Suwarrow, is said to have piqued Paul so much that he took a  cruel revenge. The rage of the emperor for the introduction of German  fashions was so great, that he determined to have the German uniform  adopted in the army.    When old Marshal Suwarrow got orders to introduce this uniform, and  received little sticks for measures and models of the soldiers tails  and side-curls, \"Hair-powder,\" said he, \"is not gunpowder, curls  are not cannons, and tails are not bayonets.\" This, in the Russian  language, falls into rhyme, and soon spread as a saying through the  army: and having reached the emperor's ears, is said, in _The Secret  Memoirs of the Russian Court_, to have been \"_the true_ cause which  induced Paul to recall Suwarrow and dispense with his services.\"    The genius of Suwarrow was superior to every difficulty, and led him  to fame and honors such as few have ever attained. Though born of a  good family, he had neither money nor interest to advance him, but  pushed his own fortunes from his boyhood. He rose to the rank of  colonel when he was but twenty-nine. He was nominated general-in-chief  for having compelled the Tartars to submit to the Russian arms. He was  created a count, and obtained the surname of Rimnisky for a victory  over the Turks near the river Rimnisky, by which he saved the Prince  of Saxe Coburg and the imperial army. For his services in Poland he  was made a field-marshal, and received the grant of an estate. In the  year 1799 the title of Prince Italisky was conferred. This was the  last favor shown: the following year saw him laid in the grave.           *       *       *       *       *    FROM DICKENS'S HOUSEHOLD WORDS.    \"PRESS ON.\"    A RIVULET'S SONG.      \"Just under an island, 'midst rushes and moss,      I was born of a rock-spring, and dew:    I was shaded by trees, whose branches and leaves      Ne'er suffered the sun to gaze through.      \"I wandered around the steep brow of a hill,      Where the daisies and violets fair    Were shaking the mist from their wakening eyes,      And pouring their breath on the air.      \"Then I crept gently on, and I moistened the feet      Of a shrub which infolded a nest--    The bird in return sang his merriest song,      And showed me his feathery crest.      \"How joyous I felt in the bright afternoon,      When the sun, riding off in the west,    Came out in red gold from behind the green trees      And burnished ray tremulous breast!      \"My memory now can return to the time      When the breeze murmured low plaintive tones,    While I wasted the day in dancing away,      Or playing with pebbles and stones.      \"It points to the hour when the rain pattered down,      Oft resting awhile in the trees;    Then quickly descending it ruffled my calm,      And whispered to me of the seas!      \"'Twas _then_ the first wish found a home in my breast      To increase as time hurries along;    'Twas then I first learned to lisp softly the words      Which I now love so proudly--'_Press on!_'      \"I'll make wider my bed, as onward I tread,      A deep mighty river I'll be--    '_Press on_' all the day will I sing on my way,      Till I enter the far-spreading sea.\"      It ceased. A youth lingered beside its green edge      Till the stars in its face brightly shone;    He hoped the sweet strain would re-echo again--      But he just heard a murmur--\"_Press on!_\"           *       *       *       *       *    [FROM DICKENS'S HOUSEHOLD WORDS.]    ADDRESS FROM AN UNDERTAKER TO THE TRADE    (STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL.)    I address you, gentlemen, as an humble individual who is much  concerned about the body. This little joke is purely a professional  one. It must go no farther. I am afraid the public thinks  uncharitably of undertakers, and would consider it a proof that Dr.  Johnson was right when he said that the man who would make a pun  would pick a pocket. Well; we all try to do the best we can for  ourselves--everybody else as well as undertakers. Burials may be  expensive, but so is legal redress. So is spiritual provision; I mean  the maintenance of all our reverends and right reverends. I am quite  sure that both lawyers' charges and the revenues of some of the chief  clergy are very little, if any, more reasonable than our own prices.  Pluralities are as bad as crowded gravepits, and I don't see that  there is a pin to choose between the church and the churchyard.
