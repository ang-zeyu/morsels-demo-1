The fundamental Truth embedded in the Wisdom-Philosophies of the  East--the Higher Yogi Teachings--is the impregnable doctrine of the One  Self in the many selves--the many selves in the One Self. This  fundamental Truth underlies all the Oriental Philosophies which are  esoteric in their nature.    Notwithstanding the crude and often repulsive conceptions and practices  of the masses of the people who represent the exoteric, or popular,  phase of the teachings (and these two phases are to be found in _all_  regions) still there is always this Inner Doctrine of the One Self, to  be found to those who look for it.    Not only is this true among the Hindus; but even among the Mahommedans,  of all countries, there is an Inner Circle of Mystics, known as the  _Sufis_, holding to this Truth. And the inner teachings of the  philosophies of all ages and races, have held likewise. And the highest  thought of the philosophers of the Western races, has found refuge in  this idea of the Over-soul, or Universal Self. But, it is only among  the Yogis that we find an attempt made to explain the real nature of  the manifestation of the One in Many--the holding of the Many forms in  the One Self.    Before proceeding to the consideration of _how_ the One becomes as  Many, as expounded by the Higher Yogi Teachings, it becomes necessary  to speak of a matter upon which there has been much confusion and  misunderstanding, not only on the part of the students of various  Oriental Philosophies, but also upon the part of some of the teachers  themselves. We allude to the connection between THE ONE--THE  ABSOLUTE--in Its ESSENCE--and that which has been called the One Life;  the Universal Life, etc.    Many writers have spoken of the Universal Life, and The One, as being  identical--but such is a grievous error, finding no warrant in the  Highest Yogi Teachings. It is true that all living forms dwell in, and  are infilled with the Universal Life--that All Life is One. We have  taught this truth, and it is indeed Truth, without qualification. But  there is still a Higher Truth--the Highest Truth, in fact--and that is,  that even this Universal Life is not the One, but, instead, is in  itself a manifestation of, and emanation from, THE ONE. There is a  great difference here---see that you perceive and understand it, before  proceeding further.    THE ONE--THE ABSOLUTE--according to the Highest Teachings, is Pure  Spirit, and not Life, Mind, or Being as we understand them in our  finite and mortal expressions. But, still all Life, Mind, and Being, as  we understand them, spring from, flow from, and emanate from, the  One--and more than this, may be spoken of as _reflections_ of the Life,  Mind, and Being of The One, if we may be permitted to apply the names  of finite manifestations to the Infinite Reality.    So, the Highest Teaching is that the Universal Life infilling all  living things, is not, in itself, the Being and Life of THE ONE--but is  rather a great fundamental emanation of The One, the manner and nature  of which will be spoken of as we proceed. Remember this, please.    Leading up to the Supreme Idea of the One in All--All in One--let us  examine into the report of the Reason upon the _nature of_ the  Substance--the Divine Substance--from which all living forms are  shaped; and from which all that we know as Finite Mind is likewise  composed. _How can these imperfect and finite forms be composed of a  Divine and Perfect Substance?_ This is the question that must occur to  the minds of those who are capable of deep thought on the subject--and  it is a question that must be answered. And it can be answered--and  _is_ answered in the Higher Yogi Philosophy. Let us examine the reports  of the Reason, a little further--then shall we be ready for the  Teachings.    Of what can the Substance of the Infinite be composed? Can it be  Matter? Yes, if you are satisfied with the reasoning of the  Materialists, and cannot see further into the Truth! These teach that  Matter is God, and that God is Matter. But if you be among those who  reject the Materialistic teachings, you will not be satisfied with this  answer. Even if you incline toward a Non-mental Infinite, still if you  are familiar with the results of modern scientific investigation, and  know that Science has seen Matter resolve itself into something like  Electric Energy, you will know that the Truth must lie behind and  beyond Matter.    Then is it Pure Energy? you may ask. Pure Energy? what's that? Can you  think of Energy apart from material manifestation? Have you ever known  of such a thing? Do you not know that even the Electron Theory, which  is attracting the attention of advanced Modern Science, and which holds  that all things are composed of minute particles of Electric Energy,  called Electrons, from which the Atoms are built--do you not know that  even this theory recognizes the necessity of a \"something like Matter,  only infinitely finer,\" which they call the Ether, to enfold the  Electric Energy as a unit--to give it a _body_, as it were? And can you  escape from the fact that the most advanced scientific minds find  confronting them--_the fact that in all Energy, and governing its  actions, there 'is manifested \"something like Mind_\"?    And does not all this teach thinkers that just as Energy creates from  itself, that which is called Matter, and then uses it as a vehicle of  expression and action--so does this \"Something like Mind\" create from  itself that which we call Energy, and proceeds to use it, with its  accompanying phase of Matter, for its expression? Does not all advanced  research show us that in all Matter and Energy there are evidences of  the operation of this \"Something like Mind\"? And if this be so, are we  not justified as regarding Matter and Energy as mere Effects--and to  look to this \"Something like Mind\" as the more fundamental Substance?  We think so--and Science is beginning to think so, too. And soon will  Science be regarding with the most profound respect, the Metaphysical  axiom that \"All is Mind.\"    You will see by reference to our \"_Advanced Course in Yogi Philosophy,  etc._,\" the general Yogi teachings regarding the Emanation of the One,  known respectively as Mind, Energy, and Matter. You will see that the  Yogis teach that Mind, Energy, and Matter comprise a threefold  emanation of the Absolute. You will also see that it is taught that  Mind was the Parent-Emanation--the Universal Mind; and that the  Universal Energy was the Second-Emanation (proceeding from Mind); and  that the Universal Matter was the Third Emanation (proceeding from  Energy) In the same book you will find that the Teaching is that above  Matter, Energy, and Mind, is the Essence of the Absolute, which is  called Spirit--the nature of which is non-understandable to the mind of  Man, the highest conception of which is the highest manifestation of  itself--Mind. But as we cannot comprehend spirit otherwise, we are  justified in thinking of it as Something like Infinite Mind--Something  as much higher than Finite Mind as that is higher than mere energy.    Now, then--we have seen the folly of thinking of the Divine Substance  as Matter or Energy. And we have come to know it as Spirit, something  like Mind, only infinitely higher, but which still may be thought of in  terms of Infinite Mind, for we can have no higher terms in our thinking  operations. So we may then assume that this Divine Nature or substance  is SPIRIT, which we will think of as Infinite Mind, for want of a  better form of conception.    We have seen the folly of thinking of the Divine Essential Substance as  the Body of God. We have likewise seen the folly of thinking of it as  the Vital Energy of God. And we have found that we could not escape  thinking of it as the Spirit, or infinite Mind of God. Beyond this we  cannot think intelligently.    But do you not see that all this exercise of the Reason has brought us  to the point where we must think that this Divine Substance, which the  Absolute-God uses in the manifestation of Universal Life; the Universe;  and all the forms, and shapes, and manifestations of life and things in  the Universe--this Divine Substance which must be _in_ All Things--and  _in which_ All Things must rest, even as the bubble rests on the  Ocean--that this can be nothing less than Spirit, and that this Spirit  can be thought of only as Infinite Mind?    And, if this be so, then indeed must _All be Mind, and Mind be  All_--meaning, of course, the Infinite Mind, not the finite  manifestation that we _call_ Mind.    Then, if this reasoning has been correct, then must we think that All  Life--all the Universe--Everything except the Absolute itself--_must be  held in the Infinite Mind of the Absolute_!    And, so, by the exercise of our Reason--by listening to, and examining  its reports, we have been brought face to face--eye to eye--heart to  heart--with the Teaching of the Illumined Ones, which has come down to  us as the Highest Teaching of the Yogi Philosophy! For this, indeed, is  the highest conception of Truth in the Yogi Teachings--this, that ALL  MANIFESTATIONS AND EMANATIONS OF THE ABSOLUTE ARE MENTAL CREATIONS OF  THE ABSOLUTE--THOUGHT-FORMS HELD IN THE INFINITE MIND--THE INFINITE  SPIRIT IN THEM--AND THEY IN THE INFINITE SPIRIT. _And that the only  Real Thing about Man is THE SPIRIT involved in the Thought-Form, the  rest is mere Personality, which changes and ceases to be. The Spirit in  the Soul of Man, is the SOUL OF THE SOUL, which is never born; never  changeth; never dieth--this is The Real Self of _Man, in which, indeed,  he is \"One with the Father.\"_    This is the point where the Reasoning Mind of Man has come to a sense  of Agreement with the Highest Yogi Teachings. Let us now pass on to the  Teachings themselves--let us"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13444"],[0,"Searchlights on Health: The Science of Eugenics (#17)"],[1,"adorned the most, is a trite  observation; but with a little qualification it is worthy of general  acceptance. Aside from the dress itself, ornaments should be very  sparingly used--at any rate, the danger lies in over-loading oneself,  and not in using too few. A young girl, and especially one of a light  and airy style of beauty, should never wear gems. A simple flower  in her hair or on her bosom is all that good taste will permit. When  jewels or other ornaments are worn, they should be placed where you  desire the eye of the spectator to rest, leaving the parts to which  you do not want attention called as plain and negative as possible.  There is no surer sign of vulgarity than a profusion of heavy jewelry  carried about upon the person.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]             *       *       *       *       *    SENSIBLE HELPS TO BEAUTY.      1. FOR SCRAWNY NECK.--Take off your tight collars, feather boas and  such heating things. Wash neck and chest with hot water, then rub in  sweet oil all that you can work in. Apply this every night before you  retire and leave the skin damp with it while you sleep.    2. FOR RED HANDS.--Keep your feet warm by soaking them often in hot  water, and keep your hands out of the water as much as possible. Rub  your hands with the skin of a lemon and it will whiten them. If your  skin will bear glycerine after you have washed, pour into the palm  a little glycerine and lemon juice mixed, and rub over the hands and  wipe off.    3. NECK AND FACE.--Do not bathe the neck and face just before or after  being out of doors. It tends to wrinkle the skin.    4. SCOWLS.--Never allow yourself to scowl, even if the sun be in your  eyes. That scowl will soon leave its trace and no beauty will outlive  it.    5. WRINKLED FOREHEAD.--If you wrinkle your forehead when you talk  or read, visit an oculist and have your eyes tested, and then wear  glasses to fit them.    6. OLD LOOKS.--Sometimes your face looks old because it is tired. Then  apply the following wash and it will make you look younger: Put three  drops of ammonia, a little borax, a tablespoonful of bay rum, and a  few drops of camphor into warm water and apply to your face. Avoid  getting it into your eyes.    7. THE BEST COSMETIC.--Squeeze the juice of a lemon into a pint of  sweet milk. Wash the face with it every night and in the morning wash  off with warm rain water. This will produce a very beautiful effect  upon the skin.    8. SPOTS ON THE FACE.--Moles and many other discolorations may be  removed from the face by a preparation composed of one part chemically  pure carbolic acid and two parts pure glycerine. Touch the spots with  a camel's-hair pencil, being careful that the preparation does not  come in contact with the adjacent skin. Five minutes after touching,  bathe with soft water and apply a little vaseline. It may be necessary  to repeat the operation, but if persisted in, the blemishes will be  entirely removed.    9. WRINKLES.--This prescription is said to cure wrinkles: Take one  ounce of white wax and melt it to a gentle heat. Add two ounces of the  juice of lily bulbs, two ounces of honey, two drams of rose water,  and a drop or two of ottar of roses. Apply twice a day, rubbing the  wrinkles the wrong way. Always use tepid water for washing the face.    10. THE HAIR.--The hair must be kept free from dust or it will fall  out. One of the best things for cleaning it, is a raw egg rubbed into  the roots and then washed out in several waters. The egg furnishes  material for the hair to grow on, while keeping the scalp perfectly  clean. Apply once a month.    11. LOSS OF HAIR.--When through sickness or headache the hair falls  out, the following tonic may be applied with good effect: Use one  ounce of glycerine, one ounce of bay rum, one pint of strong sage tea,  and apply every other night rubbing well into the scalp.             *       *       *       *       *    HOW TO KEEP THE BLOOM AND GRACE OF YOUTH.    THE SECRET OF ITS PRESERVATION.      [Illustration: MRS. WM. McKINLEY.]      1. The question most often asked by women is regarding the art of  retaining, with advancing years, the bloom and grace of youth. This  secret is not learned through the analysis of chemical compounds,  but by a thorough study of nature's laws peculiar to their sex. It is  useless for women with wrinkled faces, dimmed eyes and blemished skins  to seek for external applications of beautifying balms and lotions  to bring the glow of life and health into the face, and yet there are  truths, simple yet wonderful, whereby the bloom of early life can  be restored and retained, as should be the heritage of all God's  children, sending the light of beauty into every woman's face. The  secret:    2. Do not bathe in hard water; soften it with a few drops of ammonia,  or a little borax.    3. Do not bathe the face while it is very warm, and never use very  cold water.    4. Do not attempt to remove dust with cold water; give your face a hot  bath, using plenty of good soap, then give it a thorough rinsing with  warm water.    5. Do not rub your face with a coarse towel.    6. Do not believe you can remove wrinkles by filling in the crevices  with powder. Give your face a Russian bath every night; that is, bathe  it with water so hot that you wonder how you can bear it, and then,  a minute after, with moderately cold water, that will make your face  glow with warmth; dry it with a soft towel.    [Illustration: MALE. FEMALE. Showing the Difference in Form and  Proportion.]             *       *       *       *       *    FORM AND DEFORMITY.      1. PHYSICAL DEFORMITIES.--Masquerading is a modern accomplishment.  Girls wear tight shoes, burdensome skirts, corsets, etc., all of which  prove so fatal to their health. At the age of seventeen or eighteen,  our \"young ladies\" are sorry specimens of feminality; and palpitators,  cosmetics and all the modern paraphernalia are required to make them  appear fresh and blooming. Man is equally at fault. A devotee to all  the absurd devices of fashion, he practically asserts that \"dress  makes the man.\" But physical deformities are of far less importance  than moral imperfections.    2. DEVELOPMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL.--It is not possible for human beings  to attain their full stature of humanity, except by loving long  and perfectly. Behold that venerable man! he is mature in judgment,  perfect in every action and expression, and saintly in goodness. You  almost worship as you behold. What rendered him thus perfect? What  rounded off his natural asperities, and moulded up his virtues? Love  mainly. It permeated every pore, and seasoned every fibre of his  being, as could nothing else. Mark that matronly woman. In the bosom  of her family she is more than a queen and goddess combined. All her  looks and actions express the outflowing of some or all of the human  virtues. To know her is to love her. She became thus perfect, not in a  day or year, but by a long series of appropriate means. Then by what?  Chiefly in and by love, which is specially adapted thus to develop  this maturity.    3. PHYSICAL STATURE.--Men and women generally increase in stature  until the twenty-fifth year, and it is safe to assume, that perfection  of function is not established until maturity of bodily development  is completed. The physical contour of these representations plainly  exhibits the difference in structure, and also implies difference of  function. Solidity and strength are represented by the organization of  the male, grace and beauty by that of the female. His broad shoulders  represent physical power and the right of dominion, while her bosom is  the symbol of love and nutrition.             *       *       *       *       *    HOW TO DETERMINE A PERFECT HUMAN FIGURE.      The proportions of the perfect human figure are strictly mathematical.  The whole figure is six times the length of the foot. Whether the form  be slender or plump, this rule holds good. Any deviation from it is a  departure from the highest beauty of proportion. The Greeks made all  their statues according to this rule. The face, from the highest point  of the forehead, where the hair begins, to the end of the chin, is  one-tenth of the whole stature. The hand, from the wrist to the end  of the middle finger, is the same. The chest is a fourth, and from the  nipples to the top of the head is the same. From the top of the chest  to the highest point of the forehead is a seventh. If the length of  the face, from the roots of the hair to the chin, be divided into  three equal parts, the first division determines the point where the  eyebrows meet, and the second the place of the nostrils. The navel is  the central point of the human body, and if a man should lie on his  back with his arms and legs extended, the periphery of the circle  which might be described around him, with the navel for its center,  would touch the extremities of his hands and feet. The height from  the feet to the top of the head is the same as the distance from the  extremity of one hand to the extremity of the other when the arms are  extended.    [Illustration: Lady's Dress in the days of Greece.]    The Venus de Medici is considered the most perfect model of the female  forms, and has been the admiration of the world for ages. Alexander  Walker, after minutely describing this celebrated statue, says: \"All  these admirable characteristics of the female form, the mere existence  of which in woman must, one is tempted to imagine, be even to herself,  a source of ineffable pleasure, these constitute a being worthy, as  the personification of beauty, of occupying the temples of Greece;  present an object finer, alas, than Nature even seems capable of  producing; and offer to all nations and ages a theme of admiration and  delight.\" Well might Thomson say:      So stands the statue that enchants the world,    So, bending, tries to vail the matchless boast--"]]]
