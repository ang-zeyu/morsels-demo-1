[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12027"],[0,"Crime: Its Cause and Treatment (#17)"],[1," remark gives him an advantage that is neither  fair nor right.    The man on trial is almost always poor. It is only rarely that a poor  man can get a competent lawyer to take his case. He is often handed over  to the court for the appointment of a lawyer. The lawyer has no time or  money to prepare a defense. As a rule he is a beginner not fitted for  his job. If he wishes to take the case, he wants it only for the  experience and advertising that it will bring. He is handed a case to  experiment on, just as a medical student is handed a cadaver to dissect.  If the defendant is in jail, he has little chance to prepare his case.  If the defendant had any money he would not know what to do with it. He  is often a mentally defective person. His friends are of the same class  and can do little to help him. The jury are told that they must presume  him innocent, but the accusation alone carries with it the presumption  of guilt, which extends to everyone connected with the case, even to the  lawyer appointed to defend him. It is almost a miracle if the defendant  is not convicted.    Perhaps he is taken out to be hanged--the last act that society can do  for him, or the convicted man is sent to prison for a long or shorter  term. His head is shaved and he is placed in prison garb; he is  carefully measured and photographed in his prison clothes, so that if  he should ever get back to the world he will forever be under suspicion.  Even a change of name cannot help him. While in prison he works and  lives under lock and key, like a wild animal, eager to escape. On  certain days he is allowed to sit at a long table with other  unfortunates like himself, and visit for an hour with mother or father  or wife or son or daughter or friend on the other side. Other prisoners,  so far as he can associate with them, are as helpless and hopeless and  rebellious as he. How they will get out, and when, are their chief  concerns. Many of their guards are very humane. Probably no one seeks to  torture him, but the system and the psychology are fatal. He sees almost  no one who approaches him with friendship and trust and a desire to  help, except his family, his closest friends and his companions in  misery. He knows that the length of his term is entirely dependent upon  officials whom he cannot see or make understand his case. He snatches at  the slightest ray of hope. He is in despair from the beginning to the  end. No prison has the trained men who, with intelligence and sympathy,  should know and watch and help him in his plight. No state would spend  the money necessary to employ enough attendants and aids with the  learning and skill necessary to build him up. Money is freely spent on  the prosecution from the beginning to the end, but no effort is made to  help or save. The motto of the state is: \"Millions for offense, but not  one cent for reclamation.\"    As all things end, prison sentences are generally finished. The prisoner  is given a new suit of clothes that betrays its origin and will be  useless after the first rain, ten dollars in cash, and he goes out. His  heredity and his hard environment have put him in. Now the state is done  with him; he is free. But there is only one place to go. Like any other  released animal, he takes the same heredity back to the old environment.  What else can he do? His old companions are the only ones who will give  him social intercourse, which he needs first of all, and the only ones  who understand him. They are the only ones who will be glad to see him  and help him get a job. There is only one profession for which he is  better fitted after he comes out than he was before he went in, and that  is a life of crime. Of course, he is a marked man and a watched man with  the police. When a crime is committed and the offender is not found, the  ex-convict is rounded up with others of his class to see, perchance, if  he is not the offender that is wanted. He is taken to the lock-up and  shown with others to the witnesses for identification. Before this, the  witness may have been shown his photograph in convict clothes. Perhaps  they identify him, perhaps they do not; if identified, he may be the  man or he may not be. Anyhow, he has been in prison and this is against  him. Whenever he comes out and wherever he goes, his record follows him  as closely as his shadow. Even his friends suspect him. They suspect him  even when they help him.    Such is the daily life of these unfortunates. What can be done? I can  see nothing that the officers of the law can do. Officers represent the  people. They reflect mob psychology. Even though an officer here and  there rises above the crowd, as he sometimes does, it is of no avail.  His place soon is filled by someone else. If only the public would  understand! If only the public were more intelligent, which in this case  at least would mean more human! If only the statement I repeat so often  could be understood! There are no accidents; everything is the result of  law. All phenomena are a succession of causes and effects. The criminal  is the result of all that went before him and all that surrounds him.  Like every other mortal, he is a subject for pity and not for hatred. If  society is not safe while he is at large, he must be confined and kept  under guard and observation. He must be kept until he is safe and a  favorable environment found for him. If he will never be safe for  society, he should never be released. He must not be humiliated, made to  suffer unduly, despised or harried. He must be helped if he can be  helped. This should be the second, if not the first object of his  confinement.    Assuming that the scientific attitude toward crime should be accepted by  those who make public opinion, and that this should become crystallized  into written law, the problem would be easy.    The officers of the state can, as a rule, be depended upon to deal  properly and considerately with the known insane. The insane are more  trying and difficult than the criminal. Courts and juries and the  public, however, recognize their mental condition and do not visit them  with vengeance. It is appreciated and understood that they cannot with  safety be left at large; but they are given the care and consideration  that their condition demands. If the criminal should be looked upon as  are the creatures insane from natural causes, the State's Attorney could  then be trusted to prepare the case and do the best he could for all  concerned. The defendant would no longer be a defendant. His case would  be under investigation; his past life would be shown, his credits as  well as his debits; he would need no lawyer, not even a public defender;  no jury would be required, and the uncertainties and doubts that hang  around judgments would be removed. There would be little chance for a  miscarriage of justice. Even should there be, it would result in the  speedy release of one against whom the public bore no ill-will. One who  was sick or insane would ordinarily not need a lawyer, as the state  would bear him no malice and make no effort to do more than investigate  the case and present the facts. The whole matter should be a purely  scientific attempt to find out the best thing to be done both for the  interest of the public and the interest of the man.    No doubt, in many cases, men are convicted who are perfectly innocent of  the crime of which they are accused. This is especially true with the  poor who can provide for no adequate defense and who perhaps have been  convicted before of some misdemeanor or crime. This is also often true  in cases where there is great prejudice against the defendant, either on  account of the nature of the case or of the defendant on trial. For  instance, during the recent war a wave of hysteria swept over the world,  and courts and juries trampled on individual rights and freely violated  the spirit of laws and constitutions. The close of the war left the same  intense feelings of bitterness which made justice impossible in cases  where the charge savored of treason, and involved criticism of the  government, or advocacy of a change of political systems.    Questions of race, religion, politics, labor and the like have always  awakened violent feelings on all sides, have made bitter partisans and  strict lines of cleavage, and have made verdicts of juries and  judgments of courts the result of fear and hatred. In spite of this,  most of the inmates of prisons have done the acts charged in the  indictments. Why they did them, their states of mind, the conditions and  circumstances surrounding them, what can be done to make them stronger  and better able to meet life are never ascertained, and few courts or  juries have ever deemed these things proper subjects for consideration  or in any way involved in the case.    In law every crime consists of two things: an act and an intent. Both  are necessary to constitute legal guilt, and on the prevalent theory of  moral guilt and punishment both are necessary to make up criminal  conduct. There can be no legal or moral guilt unless one intends  wickedness; unless he deliberately does the act because he wishes to do  wrong and knows he does wrong. The question then of moral guilt, which  is necessary to the commission of a criminal act, touches all the  questions suggested and many more. Even if freedom of action is to some  degree assumed, the question still remains as to the degree of guilt in  fixing punishment and responsibility. The question involves the make-up  of the man, his full heredity, so far as it can be known.    Most of every man's heredity is hidden in the mist and darkness of the  past. He inherits more or less directly through an infinite number of  ancestors, reaching back to primitive man and even to the animals from  which he came. The remote ancestry is, of course, usually not so  important as that immediately behind him. Still, plainly, his form and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12058"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#17)"],[1,"arata, that  Susarman seized Virata's cattle by thousands. And when the cattle had  been seized, the herdsman of Virata came with great speed to the city,  and saw his sovereign, the king of Matsyas, seated on the throne in the  midst of wise councillors, and those bulls among men, the sons of Pandu,  and surrounded by brave warriors decked with ear-rings and bracelets.  And appearing before that enhancer of his dominion--King Virata seated  in court--the herdsman bowed down unto him, and addressed him, saying,  'O foremost of kings, defeating and humiliating us in battle along with  our friends the Trigartas are seizing thy cattle by hundreds and by  thousands. Do thou, therefore, speedily rescue them. Oh, see that they  are not lost to thee.' Hearing these words, the king arrayed for battle  the Matsya force abounding in cars and elephants and horses and infantry  and standards. And kings and princes speedily put on, each in its proper  place,[26] their shining and beautiful armour worthy of being worn by  heroes. And Virata's beloved brother, Satanika, put on a coat of mail  made of adamantine steel, adorned with burnished gold. And Madiraksha,  next in birth to Satanika, put on a strong coat of mail plated with  gold[27] and capable of resisting every weapon. And the coat of mail  that the king himself of the Matsyas put on was invulnerable and decked  with a hundred suns, a hundred circles, a hundred spots, and a hundred  eyes. And the coat of mail that Suryadatta[28] put on was bright as the  sun, plated with gold, and broad as a hundred lotuses of the fragrant  (_Kahlara_) species. And the coat of mail that Virata's eldest son, the  heroic Sanksha, put on was impenetrable and made of burnished steel, and  decked with a hundred eyes of gold. And it was thus that those god-like  and mighty warriors by hundreds, furnished with weapons, and eager for  battle, each donned his corselet. And then they yoked unto their  excellent cars of white-hue steeds equipped in mail. And then was  hoisted--Matsya's glorious standard on his excellent car decked with  gold and resembling the sun or the moon in its effulgence. And other  Kshatriya warriors also raised on their respective cars gold-decked  standards of various shapes and devices. And king Matsya then addressed  his brother Satanika born immediately after him, saying, 'Kanka and  Vallava and Tantripala and Damagranthi of great energy will, as it  appears to me fight, without doubt. Give thou unto them cars furnished  with banners and let them case their persons in beautiful coats of mail  that should be both invulnerable and easy to wear. And let them also  have weapons. Bearing such martial forms and possessed of arms  resembling the trunk of mighty elephants, I can never persuade myself  that they cannot fight.' Hearing these words of the king, Satanika, O  monarch, immediately ordered cars for those sons of Pritha, viz., the  royal Yudhishthira, and Bhima, and Nakula, and Sahadeva, and commanded  by the king, the charioteers, with cheerful hearts and keeping loyalty  in view, very soon got cars ready (for the Pandavas). And those  repressers of foes then donned those beautiful coats of mail,  invulnerable and easy to wear, that Virata had ordered for those heroes  of spotless fame. And mounted on cars yoked with good steeds, those  smiters of hostile ranks, those foremost of men, the sons of Pritha, set  out with cheerful hearts. Indeed, those mighty warriors skilled in  fight, those bulls of the Kuru race and sons of Pandu, those four heroic  brothers possessed of prowess incapable of being baffled, mounting on  cars decked with gold, together set out, following Virata's wake. And  infuriate elephants of terrible mien, full sixty years of age, with  shapely tusks and rent temples and juice trickling down and looking (on  that account) like cloud pouring rain and mounted by trained warriors  skilled in fight, followed the king like unto moving hills. And the  principal warriors of Matsya who cheerfully followed the king had eight  thousand cars, a thousand elephants and sixty thousand horses. And, O  bull among the Bharatas, that force of Virata, O king, as it marched  forth marking the footprints of the cattle looked exceedingly beautiful.  And on its march that foremost of armies owned by Virata, crowded with  soldiers armed with strong weapons, and abounding in elephants, horses  and cars, looked really splendid.\"        [26] _Bhagasas_ lit., each in its proper place. It may also      mean, 'according to their respective division.'        [27] _Kalyana-patalam_ is explained by Nilakantha to mean      _suvarna pattachchaditam_.        [28] One of the generals of Virata.      SECTION XXXII    Vaisampayana said, \"Marching out of the city, those heroic smiters the  Matsyas, arrayed in order of battle, overtook the Trigartas when the sun  had passed the meridian. And both excited to fury and both desirous of  having the king, the mighty Trigartas and the Matsyas, irrepressible in  battle, sent up loud roars. And then the terrible and infuriate  elephants ridden over by the skilful combatants of both sides were urged  on with spiked clubs and hooks. And the encounter, O king, that took  place when the sun was low in the horizon, between the infantry and  cavalry and chariots and elephants of both parties, was like unto that  of old between the gods and the _Asuras_, terrible and fierce and  sufficient for making one's hair stand on end and calculated to increase  the population of Yama's kingdom. And as the combatants rushed against  one another, smiting and slashing, thick clouds of dust began to rise,  so that nothing could be discovered. And covered with the dust raised by  the contending armies, birds began to drop down on the earth. And the  sun himself disappeared behind the thick cloud of arrows shot, and the  firmament looked bright as if with myriads of the fireflies. And  shifting their bows, the staves of which were decked with gold, from one  hand to another, those heroes began to strike each other down,  discharging their arrows right and left. And cars encountered cars, and  foot-soldiers fought with foot-soldiers, and horse-men with horsemen,  and elephants with mighty elephants. And they furiously encountered one  another with swords and axes, bearded darts and javelins, and iron  clubs. And although, O king, those mighty-armed warriors furiously  assailed one another in that conflict, yet neither party succeeded in  prevailing over the other. And severed heads, some with beautiful noses,  some with upper lips deeply gashed, some decked with ear-rings, and some  divided with wounds about the well-trimmed hair were seen rolling on the  ground covered with dust. And soon the field of battle was overspread  with the limbs of Kshatriya warriors, cut off by means of arrows and  lying like trunks of _Sala_ trees. And scattered over with heads decked  in ear-rings, and sandal-besmeared arms looking like the bodies of  snakes, the field of battle became exceedingly beautiful. And as cars  encountered cars, and horsemen encountered horsemen, and foot-soldiers  fought with foot-soldiers, and elephants met with elephants, the  frightful dust soon became drenched with torrents of blood. And some  amongst the combatants began to swoon away, and the warriors began to  fight reckless of consideration of humanity, friendship and  relationship. And both their course and sight obstructed by the arrowy  shower, vultures began to alight on the ground. But although those  strong-armed combatants furiously fought with one another, yet the  heroes of neither party succeeded in routing their antagonists. And  Satanika having slain a full hundred of the enemy and Visalaksha full  four hundred, both those mighty warriors penetrated into the heart of  the great Trigarta host. And having entered into the thick of the  Trigarta host, those famous and mighty heroes began to deprive their  antagonists of their senses by causing a closer conflict to set in--a  conflict, in which the combatants seized one another by the hair and  tore one another with their nails.[29] And eyeing the point where the  cars of the Trigartas had been mustered in strong numbers, those heroes  at last directed their attack towards it. And that foremost of  car-warriors, king Virata also, with Suryadatta in his van and  Madiraksha in his rear, having destroyed in that conflict five hundred  cars, eight hundred horses, and five warriors on great cars, displayed  various skilful manoeuvres on his car on that field of battle. And at  last the king came upon the ruler of the Trigartas mounted on a golden  chariot. And those high-souled and powerful warriors, desirous of  fighting, rushed roaring against each like two bulls in a cow-pen. Then  that bull among men, irrepressible in battle, Susarman, the king of the  Trigartas, challenged Matsya to a single combat on car. Then those  warriors excited to fury rushed against each other on their cars and  began to shower their arrows upon each other like clouds pouring  torrents of rain.[30] And enraged with each other, those fierce  warriors, both skilled in weapons, both wielding swords and darts and  maces, then moved about (on the field of battle) assailing each other  with whetted arrows. Then king Virata pierced Susarman with ten shafts  and each of his four horses also with five shafts. And Susarman also,  irresistible in battle and conversant with fatal weapons, pierced king  of Matsya with fifty whetted shafts. And then, O mighty monarch, in  consequence of the dust on the field of battle, the soldiers of both  Susarman and Matsya's king could not distinguish one another.\"        [29] Some differences of reading are noticeable here, for      _Yasaswinau_ some texts read _Manaswinau_, and for      Vahusamravdhau-Vahusanrambhat; and for Nakha-naki--Ratha-rathi.
