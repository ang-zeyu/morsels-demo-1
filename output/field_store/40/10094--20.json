A stamp was  carefully placed on the envelope.    Early the next morning, before the dew was off the grass, the  chieftain's riding pony was caught from the pasture and brought to his  log house. It was saddled and bridled by a younger man, his son with  whom he made his home. The old chieftain came out, carrying in one hand  his long-stemmed pipe and tobacco pouch. His blanket was loosely girdled  about his waist. Tightly holding the saddle horn, he placed a moccasined  foot carefully into the stirrup and pulled himself up awkwardly into the  saddle, muttering to himself, \"Alas, I can no more leap into my saddle.  I now must crawl about in my helplessness.\" He was past eighty years of  age, and no longer agile.    He set upon his ten-mile trip to the only post office for hundreds of  miles around. In his shirt pocket, he carried the letter destined, in  due season, to reach the heart of American people. His pony, grown old  in service, jogged along the dusty road. Memories of other days thronged  the wayside, and for the lonely rider transformed all the country. Those  days were gone when the Indian youths were taught to be truthful,--to be  merciful to the poor. Those days were gone when moral cleanliness was a  chief virtue; when public feasts were given in honor of the virtuous  girls and young men of the tribe. Untold mischief is now possible  through these broken ancient laws. The younger generation were not being  properly trained in the high virtues. A slowly starving race was growing  mad, and the pitifully weak sold their lands for a pot of porridge.    \"He, he, he! He, he, he!\" he lamented. \"Small Voice Woman, my own  relative is being represented as the mother of this strange  Blue-Star--the papers were made by two young Indian men who have  learned the white man's ways. Why must I be forced to accept the  mischief of children? My memory is clear. My reputation for veracity is  well known.    \"Small Voice Woman lived in my house until her death. She had only one  child and it was a _boy_!\" He held his hand over this thumping heart,  and was reminded of the letter in his pocket. \"This letter,--what will  happen when it reaches my good friend?\" he asked himself. The chieftain  rubbed his dim eyes and groaned, \"If only my good friend knew the folly  of turning my letter into the hands of bureaucrats! In face of repeated  defeat, I am daring once more to send this one letter.\" An inner voice  said in his ear, \"And this one letter will share the same fate of the  other letters.\"    Startled by the unexpected voice, he jerked upon the bridle reins and  brought the drowsy pony to a sudden halt. There was no one near. He  found himself a mile from the post office, for the cluster of government  buildings, where lived the superintendent, were now in plain sight. His  thin frame shook with emotion. He could not go there with his letter.    He dismounted from his pony. His quavering voice chanted a bravery song  as he gathered dry grasses and the dead stalks of last year's  sunflowers. He built a fire, and crying aloud, for his sorrow was  greater than he could bear, he cast the letter into the flames. The fire  consumed it. He sent his message on the wings of fire and he believed  she would get it. He yet trusted that help would come to his people  before it was too late. The pony tossed his head in a readiness to go.  He knew he was on the return trip and he was glad to travel.    The wind which blew so gently at dawn was now increased into a gale as  the sun approached the zenith. The chieftain, on his way home, sensed a  coming storm. He looked upward to the sky and around in every direction.  Behind him, in the distance, he saw a cloud of dust. He saw several  horsemen whipping their ponies and riding at great speed. Occasionally  he heard their shouts, as if calling after some one. He slackened his  pony's pace and frequently looked over his shoulder to see who the  riders were advancing in hot haste upon him. He was growing curious. In  a short time the riders surrounded him. On their coats shone brass  buttons, and on their hats were gold cords and tassels. They were Indian  police.    \"Wan!\" he exclaimed, finding himself the object of their chase. It was  their foolish ilk who had murdered the great leader, Sitting Bull.  \"Pray, what is the joke? Why do young men surround an old man quietly  riding home?\"    \"Uncle,\" said the spokesman, \"we are hirelings, as you know. We are sent  by the government superintendent to arrest you and take you back with  us. The superintendent says you are one of the bad Indians, singing war  songs and opposing the government all the time; this morning you were  seen trying to set fire to the government agency.\"    \"Hunhunhe!\" replied the old chief, placing the palm of his hand over his  mouth agap in astonishment. \"All this is unbelievable!\"    The policeman took hold of the pony's bridle and turned the reluctant  little beast around. They led it back with them and the old chieftain  set unresisting in the saddle. High Flier was taken before the  superintendent, who charged him with setting fires to destroy government  buildings and found him guilty. Thus Chief High Flier was sent to jail.  He had already suffered much during his life. He was the voiceless man  of America. And now in his old age he was cast into prison. The chagrin  of it all, together with his utter helplessness to defend his own or his  people's human rights, weighed heavily upon his spirit.    The foul air of the dingy cell nauseated him who loved the open. He sat  wearily down upon the tattered mattress, which lay on the rough board  floor. He drew his robe closely about his tall figure, holding it  partially over his face, his hands covered within the folds. In profound  gloom the gray-haired prisoner sat there, without a stir for long hours  and knew not when the day ended and night began. He sat buried in his  desperation. His eyes were closed, but he could not sleep. Bread and  water in tin receptacles set upon the floor beside him untouched. He was  not hungry. Venturesome mice crept out upon the floor and scampered in  the dim starlight streaming through the iron bars of the cell window.  They squeaked as they dared each other to run across his moccasined  feet, but the chieftain neither saw nor heard them.    A terrific struggle was waged within his being. He fought as he never  fought before. Tenaciously he hung upon hope for the day of  salvation--that hope hoary with age. Defying all odds against him, he  refused to surrender faith in good people.    Underneath his blanket, wrapped so closely about him, stole a luminous  light. Before his stricken consciousness appeared a vision. Lo, his good  friend, the American woman to whom he had sent his messages by fire, now  stood there a legion! A vast multitude of women, with uplifted hands,  gazed upon a huge stone image. Their upturned faces were eager and very  earnest. The stone figure was that of a woman upon the brink of the  Great Waters, facing eastward. The myriad living hands remained uplifted  till the stone woman began to show signs of life. Very majestically she  turned around, and, lo, she smiled upon this great galaxy of American  women. She was the Statue of Liberty! It was she, who, though  representing human liberty, formerly turned her back upon the American  aborigine. Her face was aglow with compassion. Her eyes swept across the  outspread continent of America, the home of the red man.    At this moment her torch flamed brighter and whiter till its radiance  reached into the obscure and remote places of the land. Her light of  liberty penetrated Indian reservations. A loud shout of joy rose up from  the Indians of the earth, everywhere!    All too soon the picture was gone. Chief High Flier awoke. He lay  prostrate on the floor where during the night he had fallen. He rose and  took his seat again upon the mattress. Another day was ushered into his  life. In his heart lay the secret vision of hope born in the midnight of  his sorrows. It enabled him to serve his jail sentence with a mute  dignity which baffled those who saw him.    Finally came the day of his release. There was rejoicing over all the  land. The desolate hills that harbored wailing voices nightly now were  hushed and still. Only gladness filled the air. A crowd gathered around  the jail to greet the chieftain. His son stood at the entrance way,  while the guard unlocked the prison door. Serenely quiet, the old  Indian chief stepped forth. An unseen stone in his path caused him to  stumble slightly, but his son grasped him by the hand and steadied his  tottering steps. He led him to a heavy lumber wagon drawn by a small  pony team which he had brought to take him home. The people thronged  about him--hundreds shook hands with him and went away singing native  songs of joy for the safe return to them of their absent one.    Among the happy people came Blue-Star Woman's two nephews. Each shook  the chieftain's hand. One of them held out an ink pad saying, \"We are  glad we were able to get you out of jail. We have great influence with  the Indian Bureau in Washington, D.C. When you need help, let us know.  Here press your thumb in this pad.\" His companion took from his pocket a  document prepared for the old chief's signature, and held it on the  wagon wheel for the thumb mark. The chieftain was taken by surprise. He  looked into his son's eyes to know the meaning of these two men. \"It is  our agreement,\" he explained to his old father. \"I pledged to pay them  half of your land if they got you out of jail.\"    The old chieftain sighed, but made no comment. Words were vain. He  pressed his indelible thumb mark, his signature it was, upon the deed,  and drove home with his son.             *       *       *       *       *      AMERICA'S INDIAN PROBLEM    The hospitality of the American aborigine,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10380"],[0,"Bible Stories and Religious Classics (#17)"],[1," thee, and believe by  the first sign and token, they shall believe thee by the second. If they  believe none of the two ne hear thy voice, then take water of the river  and pour on the dry ground, and whatsoever thou takest and drawest shall  turn into blood. Then Moses said: I pray the Lord send some other, for I  am not eloquent, but have a letting in my speech. Our Lord said to him:  Who made the mouth of a man, or who hath made a man dumb or deaf, seeing  or blind, not I? Go, therefore, I shall be in thy mouth and shall teach  thee what thou shalt say. Then said Moses: I beseech thee Lord, said he,  send some other whom thou wilt. Our Lord was wroth on Moses and said:  Aaron thy brother deacon, I know that he is eloquent, lo! he shall come  and meet with thee, and seeing thee he shall be glad in his heart. Speak  thou to him and put my words in his mouth, and I shall be in thy mouth  and in his mouth, and I shall show to you what ye ought to do, and he  shall speak for the people, and shall be thy mouth, and thou shalt be in  such things as pertain to God. Take with thee this rod in thine hand, by  which thou shalt do signs and marvels. Then Moses went to Jethro his  wife's father, and said to him, I shall go and return to my brethren  into Egypt, and see if they yet live. To whom Jethro said: Go in God's  name and place. Then said our Lord to Moses: Go and return into Egypt,  all they be now dead that sought for to slay thee. Then Moses took his  wife and his sons and set them upon an ass and returned in to Egypt,  bearing the rod of God in his hand. Then our Lord said to Aaron: Go  against Moses and meet with him in desert; which went for to meet with  him unto the mount of God, and there kissed him.    And Moses told unto Aaron all that our Lord had said to him for which he  sent him, and all the tokens and signs that he bade him do. They came  both together and gathered and assembled all the seniors and aged men of  the children of Israel. And Aaron told to them all that God had said to  Moses, and made the signs and tokens tofore the people and the people  believed it. They heard well that our Lord had visited the children of  Israel, and that he had beholden the affliction of them, wherefore they  fell down low to the ground and worshipped our Lord.    After this Moses and Aaron went unto Pharaoh and said: This saith the  Lord God of Israel: Suffer my people to depart that they may sacrifice  to me in desert. Then said Pharaoh: Who is that Lord that I may hear his  voice and leave Israel? I know not that Lord, nor I will not leave  Israel. They said to him: God of the Hebrews hath called us that we go  the journey of three days in the wilderness and sacrifice unto our Lord  God, lest peradventure pestilence or war fall to us. The king of Egypt  said to them: Why solicit ye, Moses and Aaron, the people from their  works and labor? Go ye unto your work. Pharaoh also said: The people is  much, see how they grow and multiply, and yet much more shall do if they  rested from their labor. Therefore he commanded the same day to the  prefects and masters of their works saying: In no wise give no more  chaff to the people for to make loam and clay, but let them go and  gather stubble, and make them do as much labor as they did tofore, and  lessen it nothing. They do now but cry: Let us go and make sacrifice to  our God, let them be oppressed by labor and exercised that they attend  not to leasings. Then the prefects and masters of their work said to  them that Pharaoh had commanded to give them no chaff, but they should  go and gather such as they might find, and that their work should not  therefore be minished. Then the children were disperpled for to gather  chaff, and their masters awaited on them and bade them: Make an end of  your work as ye were wont to do when that chaff was delivered to you.  And thus they were put to more affliction, and would make them to make  as many tiles as they did tofore. Then the upperest of the children of  Israel came to Pharaoh and complained saying: Why puttest thou thy  servants to such affliction? He said to them: Ye be so idle that ye say  ye will go and sacrifice to your God; ye shall have no chaff given to  you, yet ye shall work your customable work and gather your chaff also.    Then the eldest and the upperest among the Hebrews went to Moses and  Aaron and said: What have ye done? ye have so done that ye have made our  odor to stink in the sight of Pharaoh, and have encouraged him to slay  us. Then Moses counselled with our Lord how he should do, and said:  Lord, why hast thou sent me hither? For, sith I have spoken to Pharaoh  in thy name, he hath put thy people to more affliction than they had  tofore, and thou hast not delivered them. Our Lord said to Moses: Now  thou shalt see what I shall do to Pharaoh. By strong hand he shall let  you go, and in a boistous he shall cast you from his land.    Yet said our Lord to Moses: I am the Lord God that appeared to Abraham,  Isaac, and Jacob in my might, and my name is Adonai, I showed to them  not that. I promised and made covenant with them that I should give to  them the land of Canaan in which they dwelled. I now have heard the  wailing and the tribulations that the Egyptians oppress them with, for  which I shall deliver and bring them from the servitude of the  Egyptians. Moses told all these things to the children of Israel, and  they believed him not for the anguish of their spirits that they were  in, and hard labor. Then said our Lord to Moses: Go and enter in to  Pharaoh and bid him deliver my people of Israel out of his land. Moses  answered: How should Pharaoh hear me when the children of Israel believe  me not? Then our Lord said to Moses and Aaron that they both should go  to Pharaoh and give him in commandment to let the children of Israel to  depart. And he said to Moses: Lo! I have ordained thee to be God of  Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. Thou shalt say to  him all that I say to thee, and he shall say to Pharaoh that he suffer  the children of Israel to depart from his land. But I shall enhard his  heart, and shall multiply my signs and tokens in the land of Egypt, and  he shall not hear ne believe you. And I shall lead the children of  Israel my people. And shall show mine hand, and such wonders on Egypt,  that Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord. Moses and Aaron did as our  Lord commanded them. Moses was eighty years old when he came and stood  tofore Pharaoh, and Aaron eighty-three years when they spake to Pharaoh.  Then when they were tofore Pharaoh, Aaron cast the rod down, tofore  Pharaoh, and anon the rod turned into a serpent. Then Pharaoh called his  magicians and jugglers and bade them do the same. And they made their  witchcraft and invocations and cast down their rods, which turned in  likewise into serpents, but the rod of Aaron devoured their rods. Yet  was the heart of Pharaoh hard and so indurate that he would not do as  God bade. Then said our Lord to Moses: The heart of Pharaoh is grieved  and will not deliver my people. Go to him to-morn in the morning and he  shall come out, and thou shalt stand when he cometh on the bank of the  river, and take in thine hand the rod that was turned into the serpent,  and say to him: The Lord God of the Hebrews sendeth me to thee saying:  Deliver my people that they may offer and make sacrifice to me in  desert, yet thou hast no will to hear me. Therefore our Lord said: In  this shalt thou know that I am the Lord: Lo! I shall smite with the rod  that is in my hand the water of the flood, and it shall turn into blood;  the fishes that be in the water shall die, and the Egyptians shall be  put to affliction drinking of it. Then said our Lord to Moses: Say thou  to Aaron: Take this rod and stretch thine hand upon all the waters of  Egypt, upon the floods, rivers, ponds, and upon all the lakes where any  water is, in that they turn to blood, that it may be a vengeance in all  the land of Egypt, as well in treen vessels as in vessels of earth and  stone.    Moses and Aaron did as God had commanded them, and smote the flood with  the rod tofore Pharaoh and his servants, which turned into blood, and  the fishes that were in the river died, and the water was corrupt. And  the Egyptians might not drink the water, and all the water of Egypt was  turned into blood. And in likewise did the enchanters with their  witchcraft, and the heart of Pharaoh was so indurate that he would not  let the people depart as our Lord had commanded, but he returned home  for this time. The Egyptians went and dolven pits for water all about by  the river, and they found no water to drink but all was blood. And this  plague endured seven days, and whatsomever water the children of Israel  took in this while was fair and good water. This was the first plague  and vengeance. The second was that God sent frogs so many, that all the  land was full, the rivers, the houses, chambers, beds, that they were  woebegone, and these frogs entered into their meat, so many that they  covered all the land of Egypt. Then Pharaoh prayed Moses and Aaron that  God would take away these frogs, and that he would go suffer the people  to do sacrifice; and then Moses asked when he would deliver them if the  frogs were voided, and Pharaoh said: In the morn. And then Moses prayed,  and they voided all. And when Pharaoh saw that he was quit of them, he  kept not his promise and would not let them depart. The third vengeance  that God sent to them was a great multitude of hungry horse-flies, as  many as the dust of the earth, which were on men, and bit them and  beasts. And then enchanters said then to Pharaoh: This is the finger of  God. Yet would not Pharaoh let them depart. The fourth vengeance was  that God sent all manner kind of flies and lice in such wise that the  universal land of Egypt was full of all manner flies and lice, but in  the land of Goshen were none.
