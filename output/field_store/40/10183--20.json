Flood, with all his experience, well knew that if  stampeded cattle ever got into a known trail, they were certain to  turn backward over their course; and we were now paying the fiddler  for lack of proper precaution.    Within an hour after daybreak, and before the cattle had reached the  camp of the mixed herd, our saddle horses were sighted coming over a  slight divide about two miles up the trail, and a minute later  McCann's mules hove in sight, bringing up the rear. They had made a  start with the first dawn, rightly reasoning, as there was no time to  leave orders on our departure, that it was advisable for Mahomet to go  to the mountain. Flood complimented our cook and horse wrangler on  their foresight, for the wagon was our base of sustenance; and there  was little loss of time before Barney McCann was calling us to a  hastily prepared breakfast. Flood asked Wilson to bring his outfit to  our wagon for breakfast, and as fast as they were relieved from herd,  they also did ample justice to McCann's cooking. During breakfast, I  remember Wilson explaining to Flood what he believed was the cause of  the stampede. It seems that there were a few remaining buffalo ranging  north of the Wichita, and at night when they came into the river to  drink they had scented the cattle on the south side. The bellowing of  buffalo bulls had been distinctly heard by his men on night herd for  several nights past. The foreman stated it as his belief that a number  of bulls had swum the river and had by stealth approached near the  sleeping cattle,--then, on discovering the presence of the herders,  had themselves stampeded, throwing his herd into a panic.    We had got a change of mounts during the breakfast hour, and when all  was ready Flood and Wilson rode over to the wagon of the mixed herd,  the two outfits following, when Flood inquired of their foreman,--    \"Have you any suggestions to make in the cutting of these herds?\"    \"No suggestions,\" was the reply, \"but I intend to cut mine first and  cut them northward on the trail.\"    \"You intend to cut them northward, you mean, provided there are no  objections, which I'm positive there will be,\" said Flood. \"It takes  me some little time to size a man up, and the more I see of you during  our brief acquaintance, the more I think there's two or three things  that you might learn to your advantage. I'll not enumerate them now,  but when these herds are separated, if you insist, it will cost you  nothing but the asking for my opinion of you. This much you can depend  on: when the cutting's over, you'll occupy the same position on the  trail that you did before this accident happened. Wilson, here, has  nothing but jaded horses, and his outfit will hold the herd while  yours and mine cut their cattle. And instead of you cutting north, you  can either cut south where you belong on the trail or sulk in your  camp, your own will and pleasure to govern. But if you are a cowman,  willing to do your part, you'll have your outfit ready to work by the  time we throw the cattle together.\"    Not waiting for any reply, Flood turned away, and the double outfit  circled around the grazing herd and began throwing the sea of cattle  into a compact body ready to work. Rod Wheat and Ash Borrowstone were  detailed to hold our cut, and the remainder of us, including Honeyman,  entered the herd and began cutting. Shortly after we had commenced the  work, the mixed outfit, finding themselves in a lonesome minority,  joined us and began cutting out their cattle to the westward. When we  had worked about half an hour, Flood called us out, and with the  larger portion of Wilson's men, we rode over and drifted the mixed cut  around to the southward, where they belonged. The mixed outfit  pretended they meant no harm, and were politely informed that if they  were sincere, they could show it more plainly. For nearly three hours  we sent a steady stream of cattle out of the main herd into our cut,  while our horses dripped with sweat. With our advantage in the start,  as well as that of having the smallest herd, we finished our work  first. While the mixed outfit were finishing their cutting, we changed  mounts, and then were ready to work the separated herds. Wilson took  about half his outfit, and after giving our herd a trimming, during  which he recut about twenty, the mixed outfit were given a similar  chance, and found about half a dozen of their brand. These cattle of  Wilson's and the other herd amongst ours were not to be wondered at,  for we cut by a liberal rule. Often we would find a number of ours on  the outside of the main herd, when two men would cut the squad in a  bunch, and if there was a wrong brand amongst them, it was no  matter,--we knew our herd would have to be retrimmed anyhow, and the  other outfits might be disappointed if they found none of their cattle  amongst ours.    The mixed outfit were yet working our herd when Wilson's wagon and  saddle horses arrived, and while they were changing mounts, we cut the  mixed herd of our brand and picked up a number of strays which we had  been nursing along, though when we first entered the main herd, strays  had received our attention, being well known to us by ranch brands as  well as flesh marks. In gathering up this very natural flotsam of the  trail, we cut nothing but what our herd had absorbed in its travels,  showing due regard to a similar right of the other herds. Our work was  finished first, and after Wilson had recut the mixed herd, we gave his  herd one more looking over in a farewell parting. Flood asked him if  he wanted the lead, but Wilson waived his right in his open, frank  manner, saying, \"If I had as long-legged cattle as you have, I  wouldn't ask no man for the privilege of passing. Why, you ought to  out-travel horses. I'm glad to have met you and your outfit,  personally, but regret the incident which has given you so much  trouble. As I don't expect to go farther than Dodge or Ogalalla at the  most, you are more than welcome to the lead. And if you or any of  these rascals in your outfit are ever in Coryell County, hunt up Frank  Wilson of the Block Bar Ranch, and I'll promise you a drink of milk or  something stronger if possible.\"    We crossed the Wichita late that afternoon, there being not over fifty  feet of swimming water for the cattle. Our wagon gave us the only  trouble, for the load could not well be lightened, and it was an  imperative necessity to cross it the same day. Once the cattle were  safely over and a few men left to graze them forward, the remainder of  the outfit collected all the ropes and went back after the wagon. As  mules are always unreliable in the water, Flood concluded to swim them  loose. We lashed the wagon box securely to the gearing with ropes,  arranged our bedding in the wagon where it would be on top, and ran  the wagon by hand into the water as far as we dared without flooding  the wagon box. Two men, with guy ropes fore and aft, were then left to  swim with the wagon in order to keep it from toppling over, while the  remainder of us recrossed to the farther side of the swimming channel,  and fastened our lariats to two long ropes from the end of the tongue.  We took a wrap on the pommels of our saddles with the loose end, and  when the word was given our eight horses furnished abundant motive  power, and the wagon floated across, landing high and dry amid the  shoutings of the outfit.        CHAPTER IX    DOAN'S CROSSING    It was a nice open country between the Wichita and Pease rivers. On  reaching the latter, we found an easy stage of water for crossing,  though there was every evidence that the river had been on a recent  rise, the debris of a late freshet littering the cutbank, while  high-water mark could be easily noticed on the trees along the river  bottom. Summer had advanced until the June freshets were to be  expected, and for the next month we should be fortunate if our advance  was not checked by floods and falling weather. The fortunate stage of  the Pease encouraged us, however, to hope that possibly Red River, two  days' drive ahead, would be fordable. The day on which we expected to  reach it, Flood set out early to look up the ford which had then been  in use but a few years, and which in later days was known as Doan's  Crossing on Red River. Our foreman returned before noon and reported a  favorable stage of water for the herd, and a new ferry that had been  established for wagons. With this good news, we were determined to put  that river behind us in as few hours as possible, for it was a common  occurrence that a river which was fordable at night was the reverse by  daybreak. McCann was sent ahead with the wagon, but we held the saddle  horses with us to serve as leaders in taking the water at the ford.    The cattle were strung out in trailing manner nearly a mile, and on  reaching the river near the middle of the afternoon, we took the water  without a halt or even a change of horses. This boundary river on the  northern border of Texas was a terror to trail drovers, but on our  reaching it, it had shallowed down, the flow of water following  several small channels. One of these was swimming, with shallow bars  intervening between the channels. But the majestic grandeur of the  river was apparent on every hand,--with its red, bluff banks, the  sediment of its red waters marking the timber along its course, while  the driftwood, lodged in trees and high on the banks, indicated what  might be expected when she became sportive or angry. That she was  merciless was evident, for although this crossing had been in use only  a year or two when we forded, yet five graves, one of which was less  than ten days made, attested her disregard for human life. It can  safely be asserted that at this and lower"]]]
