[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34063"],[0,"Fifty Years a Hunter and Trapper (#15)"],[1," Now that the traps were all  set, we divided up the trap lines as best we could for each one to  attend to while hunting deer. In dividing up the lines in this way we  saved much time, as we would not both be working the same territory.    Now business began to get quite lively, and we were seldom in camp  until after dark, and we were up early and had breakfast over and our  lunch packed in our knapsacks. The lunch usually consisted of a good  big hunk of boiled venison and a couple of doughnuts and a few  crackers, occasionally the breast of a partridge, fried in coon or  bear oil. Sometimes the lunch would freeze in the knapsacks and it  would be necessary to gather a little paper bark from a yellow birch  and a little rosin from a hemlock, black birch or hard maple tree and  build a little fire to thaw the lunch. This, however, was quickly  done, and was a pleasure rather than a hardship. I have delighted in  eating the lunch in this manner for many a winter on the trap line or  trail, as have many other hunters and trappers.    Bill and I always had our lunch packed and ready to take up the trail  at the first peep of day. Sometimes when we would get in late, tired  and wet and our clothes frozen, I would suggest to Bill that we shut  up camp and take a wood job, just to see what Bill would have to say.  He would say that there would be time to take a wood job in the  spring or after he had killed a certain large buck which is usually  called \"Old Golden.\" There were but a few days but what we either  caught some fur or killed a deer, though sometimes we would have a  bad streak of luck by wounding a deer, or having some animal take a  foot off and escape, but this would make us all the more eager to  follow the trail or trap line.      [Illustration: WOODCOCK ON THE TRAP LINE.]    As we had gotten by this time several deer and had caught three bear  (one in one of the deadfalls that I had built the fall before, that  Will Howard called that \"dashed dinged riggin',\" when he found the  bear in it) we wanted to get them out to Kane, that being the nearest  point to a railroad. We started early one morning, Bill taking an axe  and I carrying the saw, so that if we found any large trees across  the trail that we had cut out the year before we would have the saw  to do it with.    After carrying the saw some distance and not finding any trees of  much size across the road, we left it and only took the axe. We found  but very little in the trail to cut out.    We got to Kane in time to engage a man with team to come to camp the  next day and take out the venison and bear and bring in some  necessary commissaries that we were getting short of. It was only a  few days after this that I found that a bear got in one of the traps.  The trap chain having a swivel that was pretty well worn, broke, and  the bear went off with the trap. I followed the trail until the  middle of the afternoon, when I became satisfied that Bruin was  disgusted with that locality, as he had continued his course nearly  due east without a stop. I could see no signs that led me to think  that Bruin intended to stop for the next fifty miles.    So I gave up the chase and went to camp, getting there long after all  good boys should have been in bed. Bill was up and out at the door  listening if he could hear a gun shot or anything to indicate what  had become of me. We held a council of war before going to bed, and  decided to give Bruin another day's rest or travel, as he saw fit to  do, before we started on the trail. We would go to all the traps that  had not been tended to in the past three or four days and then take  up the trail of Bruin and follow him to the end of his trail, no  matter how long the trail might be.    There was but little danger of the trail becoming snowed under or  lost, as there was nearly a foot of snow on the ground, and the trap  would make a broad trail in the snow, which was quite easily  followed. The next day, as intended, we put in a full day attending  the traps and got some fur, but I do not remember just what. We  started out on the trail of Bruin with a three days' ration of the  usual lunch, boiled venison, ham, doughnuts and biscuits.    After following the trail about two hours from the place where I had  left it, we came onto a man's track that had taken the trail of our  bear. This roiled the temper of the Vermonter somewhat, and if I did  not say anything, I had a mighty think on. But we had no cause for  alarm at this time. The man after following the trail for a mile or  two gave up the chase as a bad job, I guess. He stood and stamped  about for some time (we judged by the tracks he had made) and then  started back nearly in the same course that he had come.    We followed on until dark when we came to a wagon road. Apparently  several persons had seen the bear trail, for there was a beaten path  for a few yards on either side of the road. We knew nothing about the  road or where it went, but finally concluded to take the road leading  south for a little ways. If we saw no signs of habitation then we  would camp, as that was what we expected to be compelled to do when  starting from camp and each had taken a blanket for the purpose.    We had not gone far when a man with a sleigh overtook us, and we  learned that we were about one and a half miles from what was called  Bunker Hill. The man gave us a ride. We went to a boarding house and  stayed over night, rather than camping on Bruin's trail, though we  got plenty of camping on the trail of Bruin before this hunt was at  an end.    The next morning we were out early and had breakfast at 6 o'clock and  started for the trail which we reached before daylight. We had gone a  little way when we heard voices coming along the road. We listened a  moment and saw that it was a party of three men who had come to take  the bear's trail. We waited until they came up to us and one man  said, \"What in blazes are you fellows doing on this bear's track?\"  Bill replied rather sharp, \"That's our business, but what are you  here for?\" Then they said that one of the men had seen the track the  evening before and as there was no one after it, they had come out to  follow up the track and kill the bear. They insisted on going after  the bear but after some talk we convinced them that we did not need  any help and they turned back.    We took up the trail and followed it pretty lively for a time, as we  did not know but those men would cut around and take the trail ahead  of us, though they did not do so. We were now on the waters of Potato  Creek and there was a good deal of laurel and here we found the first  place that Bruin had stopped and made a bed.    It is usually the case that a bear that has a trap on his foot will  not travel any great distance before they stop and make a bed and  then move a short distance and make another bed. Bruin now began to  act more natural, to his family. We began to think that we would soon  come to fresh signs at least, but were disappointed for we did not  follow the trail far, after we came onto his bed before two men's  tracks fell in and took up the trail.    After following for some time on the trail of the men and bear, we  came to where the bear had made another stop and we could see that  the bear's track was much fresher showing that it had stopped some  time. We expected that the men would divide here, one taking the  trail while the other worked on the side, but both men continued on  the same trail. After following the trail for three or four hundred  yards farther, we came onto another bed and this time the bear went  out on the jump and Bill said some cuss words about the men. It is  possible that I did too.    The trail here turned north. This took us into a section more thickly  settled and hunters more numerous. The greater part of the time there  was from one to two men on the trail ahead of us and all that was  left for us to do was to follow on as fast as we could. The second  night we were on the head of Salt Run and we followed the trail till  dark. We now had the bear trail to follow instead of the men as all  the men had left to go to their camps or homes. Bill said that we  would sleep \"dash-dang\" close to the trail after this, so we soon  found a large log to build a fire against. First we would build the  fire out a few feet from the log after scraping the snow away. Then  we would throw a few hemlock boughs over a pole laid in crotches and  then move the fire down against the log, throw a few boughs on the  ground where the fire had been moved from and the camp was complete  in a very few minutes.    We now began to fear that some one would get in ahead of us and kill  the bear and we would lose bear, trap and all. Bill said that we  would follow so \"dash-darn\" close that we would be up in time to  attend the funeral. We were so close up that we were no longer  bothered only a little while at a time as we would soon overtook any  one who hit the trail ahead of us and followed it.    The bear again turned east which took us across the road which runs  from Coudersport to Emporium in Cameron County. We were now back in  Potter County and only 15 miles from home. Bruin here turned south  and true to his nature, led us through all the windfalls and laurel  patches to be found and occasionally would break down a few laurel  and act as though he intended to camp for a time but apparently would  change his mind and go on again.    We were now on the waters of the Conley and night was fast coming on.  The trail led across a little bog and we were looking for water and a  suitable place to camp, when Bill called my attention to a man  standing on the trail watching us. When we came to him it proved to  be a neighbor of ours. Mr. Ephraim Reed, who was hunting in there and  said that his camp was only a little way down the hollow and asked us  to go down and stay over night. We were glad to do so. Mr. Reed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3407"],[0,"The Spell of Egypt (#15)"],[1,"Ombos, the next temple  which you visit, is the most perfect temple in Egypt. Kom Ombos is one  of the most imperfect. Edfu is a divine house of \"the Hidden One,\" full  of a sacred atmosphere. Kom Ombos is the house of crocodiles. In ancient  days the inhabitants of Edfu abhorred, above everything, crocodiles and  their worshippers. And here at Kom Ombos the crocodile was adored. You  are in a different atmosphere.    As soon as you land, you are greeted with crocodiles, though fortunately  not by them. A heap of their black mummies is shown to you reposing in a  sort of tomb or shrine open at one end to the air. By these mummies the  new note is loudly struck. The crocodiles have carried you in an  instant from that which is pervadingly general to that which is narrowly  particular; from the purely noble, which seems to belong to all time,  to the entirely barbaric, which belongs only to times outworn. It  is difficult to feel as if one had anything in common with men who  seriously worshipped crocodiles, had priests to feed them, and decorated  their scaly necks with jewels.    Yet the crocodile god had a noble temple at Kom Ombos, a temple which  dates from the times of the Ptolemies, though there was a temple in  earlier days which has now disappeared. Its situation is splendid. It  stands high above the Nile, and close to the river, on a terrace which  has recently been constructed to save it from the encroachments of the  water. And it looks down upon a view which is exquisite in the clear  light of early morning. On the right, and far off, is a delicious  pink bareness of distant flats and hills. Opposite there is a flood  of verdure and of trees going to mountains, a spit of sand where is an  inlet of the river, with a crowd of native boats, perhaps waiting for  a wind. On the left is the big bend of the Nile, singularly beautiful,  almost voluptuous in form, and girdled with a radiant green of crops,  with palm-trees, and again the distant hills. Sebek was well advised to  have his temples here and in the glorious Fayum, that land flowing with  milk and honey, where the air is full of the voices of the flocks and  herds, and alive with the wild pigeons; where the sweet sugar-cane  towers up in fairy forests, the beloved home of the jackal; where the  green corn waves to the horizon, and the runlets of water make a maze of  silver threads carrying life and its happy murmur through all the vast  oasis.    At the guardian's gate by which you go in there sits not a watch dog,  nor yet a crocodile, but a watch cat, small, but very determined, and  very attentive to its duties, and neatly carved in stone. You try to  look like a crocodile-worshipper. It is deceived, and lets you pass. And  you are alone with the growing morning and Kom Ombos.    I was never taken, caught up into an atmosphere, in Kom Ombos. I  examined it with interest, but I did not feel a spell. Its grandeur  is great, but it did not affect me as did the grandeur of Karnak. Its  nobility cannot be questioned, but I did not stilly rejoice in it, as in  the nobility of Luxor, or the free splendor of the Ramesseum.    The oldest thing at Kom Ombos is a gateway of sandstone placed there by  Thothmes III. as a tribute to Sebek. The great temple is of a warm-brown  color, a very rich and particularly beautiful brown, that soothes and  almost comforts the eyes that have been for many days boldly assaulted  by the sun. Upon the terrace platform above the river you face a low and  ruined wall, on which there are some lively reliefs, beyond which is  a large, open court containing a quantity of stunted, once big columns  standing on big bases. Immediately before you the temple towers up, very  gigantic, very majestic, with a stone pavement, walls on which still  remain some traces of paintings, and really grand columns, enormous in  size and in good formation. There are fine architraves, and some bits of  roofing, but the greater part is open to the air. Through a doorway is  a second hall containing columns much less noble, and beyond this one  walks in ruin, among crumbled or partly destroyed chambers, broken  statues, become mere slabs of granite and fallen blocks of stone. At the  end is a wall, with a pavement bordering it, and a row of chambers that  look like monkish cells, closed by small doors. At Kom Ombos there  are two sanctuaries, one dedicated to Sebek, the other to Heru-ur, or  Haroeris, a form of Horus in Egyptian called \"the Elder,\" which was  worshipped with Sebek here by the admirers of crocodiles. Each of them  contains a pedestal of granite upon which once rested a sacred bark  bearing an image of the deity.    There are some fine reliefs scattered through these mighty ruins,  showing Sebek with the head of a crocodile, Heru-ur with the head of  a hawk so characteristic of Horus, and one strange animal which has  no fewer than four heads, apparently meant for the heads of lions. One  relief which I specially noticed for its life, its charming vivacity,  and its almost amusing fidelity to details unchanged to-day, depicts  a number of ducks in full flight near a mass of lotus-flowers. I  remembered it one day in the Fayum, so intimately associated with Sebek,  when I rode twenty miles out from camp on a dromedary to the end of the  great lake of Kurun, where the sand wastes of the Libyan desert stretch  to the pale and waveless waters which, that day, looked curiously  desolate and even sinister under a low, grey sky. Beyond the wiry  tamarisk-bushes, which grow far out from the shore, thousands upon  thousands of wild duck were floating as far as the eyes could see. We  took a strange native boat, manned by two half-naked fishermen, and were  rowed with big, broad-bladed oars out upon the silent flood that the  silent desert surrounded. But the duck were too wary ever to let us  get within range of them. As we drew gently near, they rose in black  throngs, and skimmed low into the distance of the wintry landscape,  trailing their legs behind them, like the duck on the wall of Kom  Ombos. There was no duck for dinner in camp that night, and the cook was  inconsolable. But I had seen a relief come to life, and surmounted my  disappointment.    Kom Ombos and Edfu, the two houses of the lovers and haters of  crocodiles, or at least of the lovers and the haters of their worship,  I shall always think of them together, because I drifted on the _Loulia_  from one to the other, and saw no interesting temple between them and  because their personalities are as opposed as were, centuries ago,  the tenets of those who adored within them. The Egyptians of old were  devoted to the hunting of crocodiles, which once abounded in the reaches  of the Nile between Assuan and Luxor, and also much lower down. But I  believe that no reliefs, or paintings, of this sport are to be found  upon the walls of the temples and the tombs. The fear of Sebek, perhaps,  prevailed even over the dwellers about the temple of Edfu. Yet how could  fear of any crocodile god infect the souls of those who were privileged  to worship in such a temple, or even reverently to stand under the  colonnade within the door? As well, perhaps, one might ask how men could  be inspired to raise such a perfect building to a deity with the face of  a hawk? But Horus was not the god of crocodiles, but a god of the sun.  And his power to inspire men must have been vast; for the greatest  concentration in stone in Egypt, and, I suppose, in the whole world,  the Sphinx, as De Rouge proved by an inscription at Edfu, was a  representation of Horus transformed to conquer Typhon. The Sphinx and  Edfu! For such marvels we ought to bless the hawk-headed god. And if we  forget the hawk, which one meets so perpetually upon the walls of  tombs and temples, and identify Horus rather with the Greek Apollo, the  yellow-haired god of the sun, driving \"westerly all day in his flaming  chariot,\" and shooting his golden arrows at the happy world beneath, we  can be at peace with those dead Egyptians. For every pilgrim who goes to  Edfu to-day is surely a worshipper of the solar aspect of Horus. As long  as the world lasts there will be sun-worshippers. Every brown man upon  the Nile is one, and every good American who crosses the ocean and comes  at last into the sombre wonder of Edfu, and I was one upon the deck of  the _Loulia_.    And we all worship as yet in the dark, as in the exquisite dark, like  faith, of the Holy of Holies of Horus.          XVI    PHILAE    As I drew slowly nearer and nearer to the home of \"the great  Enchantress,\" or, as Isis was also called in bygone days, \"the Lady of  Philae,\" the land began to change in character, to be full of a new and  barbaric meaning. In recent years I have paid many visits to northern  Africa, but only to Tunisia and Algeria, countries that are wilder  looking, and much wilder seeming than Egypt. Now, as I approached  Assuan, I seemed at last to be also approaching the real, the intense  Africa that I had known in the Sahara, the enigmatic siren, savage and  strange and wonderful, whom the typical Ouled Nail, crowned with  gold, and tufted with ostrich plumes, painted with kohl, tattooed, and  perfumed, hung with golden coins and amulets, and framed in plaits  of coarse, false hair, represents indifferently to the eyes of the  travelling stranger. For at last I saw the sands that I love creeping  down to the banks of the Nile. And they brought with them that wonderful  air which belongs only to them--the air that dwells among the dunes in  the solitary places, that is like the cool touch of Liberty upon  the face of a man, that makes the brown child of the nomad as lithe,  tireless, and fierce-spirited as a young panther, and sets flame in the  eyes of the Arab horse, and gives speed of the wind to the Sloughi. The  true lover of the desert can never rid his soul of its passion for the  sands, and now my heart leaped as I stole into their pure "]]]
