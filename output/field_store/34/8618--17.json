There came with  us a brother of his, the King of another island, accompanied by three  men. The Captain General detained him to dine with us, and we gave him  several things.\"    \"The King abounded in gold, and was a grand figure. In the island  belonging to the King who came to the ship there are mines of gold,  which they find in pieces as big as a walnut or an egg, by seeking in  the ground. All the vessels which he makes use of are made of it, and  also some parts of his house, which was well fitted up according to the  custom of the country, and he was the handsomest man that we saw among  these nations. He had very black hair coming down to his shoulders, with  a silk cloth on his head, and two large gold rings hanging from his  ears; he had a cloth of cotton worked with silk, which covered him from  the waist to the knees; at his side he wore a dagger, with a long handle  which was all of gold, his sheath was of carved wood. Besides he carried  upon him scents of storax and benzoin. He was tawny and painted all  over.\"    An island where nuggets of gold as big as eggs could be found must have  offered a tempting place of residence.    But Magellan's first thought was for the good of the souls of this  hospitable people.          CHAPTER XVII.    EASTER SUNDAY.--MAGELLAN PLANTS THE CROSS.      Now begins the dawn of Christianity in the Philippines. Magellan was a  deeply religious man, and Pigafetta was a Christian Knight. Magellan saw  the significance of his marvelous voyage, and his soul glowed with  gratitude to Heaven.    Easter Sunday approached. Magellan had made preparations to plant a  cross on a mountain overlooking the sea.    Easter Sunday fell on the last day of March. \"The Captain,\" to follow  the Italian's narrative in part, \"sent the Chaplain ashore early to say  mass, and the interpreter went with him to tell the King that they were  not coming on shore to dine with him, but only to hear the mass.    \"When it was time for saying mass the Captain went ashore with fifty  men, not with their arms, but only with their swords, and dressed as  well as each one was able to dress, and before the boats reached the  shore our ships fired six cannon shots as a sign of peace.    \"At our landing the two Kings of the islands were there, and received  the Captain in a friendly manner, and placed him between them, and then  we went to the place prepared for saying mass, which was not far from  the shore.\"    The ceremonies that followed were dramatic. \"Before the mass began the  Captain threw a quantity of musk-rose water on those two Kings,\" is the  picture drawn by the Italian, \"and when the offertory of the mass came,  the two Kings went to kiss the Cross like us, but they offered nothing,  and at the elevation of the body of our Lord they were kneeling like us,  and adored our Lord with joined hands. The ships fired all their  artillery at the elevation of the body of our Lord.\"    The scene that followed discloses the religious nature of Magellan and  his joy in what was ennobling.    He caused a great cross to be lifted, \"with the nails and crown, to  which the Kings made reverence.\" He told the Kings that he wished to  place it in their country for their profit, \"because if there came  afterward any ships from Spain to those islands, on seeing this cross,  they would know that we had been there, and therefore they would not  cause them any displeasure to their persons nor their goods; and if they  took any of their people, on showing them this sign, they would at once  let them go.\"    [Illustration: Mount Mayon, on the Island of Luzun.]    The Captain continued his address to the Kings in the same spirit. He  told them that it was necessary that this cross \"should be placed on the  summit of the highest mountain in their country, so that seeing it every  day and night they might adore it.\" He further told them that if they  did thus, \"neither thunder, lightning, nor the tempest could do them  hurt.\" This he believed to be true. The Kings \"thanked the Captain, and  said they would do it willingly.\" The Captain asked them how they  worshiped. They answered that \"they did not perform any other adoration,  but only joined their hands, looking up to Heaven, and that they called  their God Aba. Hearing this, the Captain was very joyful; on seeing  that, the first King raised his hands to the sky and said that he wished  it were possible for him to be able to show the affection which he felt  toward him.\"    The elevation of the Cross followed.    \"After dinner we all returned in our dress coats, and we went together  with the two Kings to the middle of the highest mountain we could find,  and there the Cross was planted.\"    Important information followed.    \"After the two Kings and the Captain rested themselves, and, while  conversing, I asked where was the best port for obtaining victuals. They  replied that there were three; that is to say, Ceylon, Zubu, and  Calaghan; but that Zubu was the largest and of the most traffic. Then  the Kings offered to give him pilots to go to those ports, for which he  thanked them, and deliberated to go there, for his ill-fortune would  have it so. After the cross had been planted on the mountain, each one  said the Paternoster and Ave Maria, and adored it, and the Kings did the  like. Then he went down below to where their boats were. There the kings  had brought some of the fruit called cocos and other things to make a  collation and to refresh us.\"    The fleet sailed away soon after Easter Monday, the Captain having  secured native pilots from the Kings. One of the Kings volunteered to  act himself as pilot, and this service was accepted.    Pigafetta describes the use of betel:    \"This kind of people are gentle, and go naked, and are painted. They  wear a piece of cloth made from a tree, like a linen cloth, round their  body to cover their natural parts; they are great drinkers. The women  are dressed in tree cloth from their waists downward; their hair is  black, and reaches down to the ground; they wear certain gold rings in  their ears. These people chew most of their time a fruit which they call  areca (betel), which is something of the shape of a pear; they cut it in  four quarters, and after they have chewed it for a long time they spit  it out, from which afterward they have their mouths very red. They find  themselves the better from the use of this fruit because it refreshes  them much, for this country is very hot, so that they could not live  without it.\"    The use of the areca, or betel nut, is still common in all the  Philippine Islands.    The fleet next went to Maestral, \"passing through five islands--Ceylon,  Bohol, Canighan, Baibai, and Satighan. In the Island of Satighan was a  kind of bird called barbarstigly, which was as large as an eagle. Of  these we killed only one,\" says our narrator, \"because it was late. We  ate it, and it had the taste of a fowl. There were also in this island  doves, tortoises, parrots, and certain black birds as large as a fowl,  with a long tail. They lay eggs as large as those of a goose. These they  put a good length under the sand in the sun, where they were hatched by  the great heat, which the heated sand gives out; and when these birds  were hatched they pushed up the sand and came out. These eggs are good  to eat.    \"From this island of Mazzubua to that of Satighan there are twenty  leagues, and on leaving Satighan we went by the west; but the King of  Mazzubua could not follow us; therefore we waited for him near three  islands; that is to say, Polo, Ticobon, and Pozzon. When the King  arrived he was much astonished at our navigation; the Captain General  bade him come on board his ship with some of his principal people, at  which they were much pleased. Thus we went to Zubu, which is fifteen  leagues off from Satighan.\"    The story of the Italian here, which we so freely use, leaves in the  mind a picture of the first voyage among the Philippines. The habits of  the people in these same islands are not greatly changed, but we hardly  find there now as tractable kings as were those to whom Magellan left  the Cross.          CHAPTER XVIII.    CHRISTIANITY AND TRADE ESTABLISHED.--THE BAPTISM OF THE QUEEN.      On April 9th they entered the Port of Zubu, on approaching which they  saw houses in the trees. The Captain hung out his flags in the clear  sunny air. He caused his artillery to be fired, which greatly alarmed  the natives. He then sent an interpreter to the King.    The interpreter found the people in terror at the thunder of the guns.  He assured the King that the salute had been made in his honor. Then the  interpreter said:    \"My master is the greatest King in all the world. We are sailing at his  command to discover the Spice Islands. But we have heard of your fame,  and the fame of your country, and have come to visit you.\"    \"You are welcome,\" said the King, \"but you must pay me tribute.\"    \"My master,\" said the interpreter, \"is the greatest of all Kings, and we  can pay tribute to no one.\"    The King feasted them, and they entered into negotiations of peace with  the King of Zubu.    At Zubu Magellan turned missionary with no common zeal.    He told the native princes that his visit was for the sake of peace.    We are told that the \"Captain General sat in a chair of red velvet, and  near him were the principal men of the ships sitting in leather chairs,  and the others sat on the ground on mats.    \"The Captain,\" says the narrative, \"spoke at length on the subject of  peace, and prayed God to confirm it in Heaven. These people replied that  they had never heard such words as these which the Captain had spoken to  them, and they took great pleasure in hearing them. The Captain, seeing  then that those people listened willingly to what was said to them, and  that they gave good answers, began to say a great many"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37823"],[0,"Neotropical Hylid Frogs, Genus Smilisca (#15)"],[1,"a total length of 28.5 mm.; body only slightly wider than deep,  nearly flat dorsally; snout broadly rounded in dorsal view, bluntly  rounded in lateral view; eyes widely separated, directed dorsolaterally;  nostril slightly closer to eye than to tip of snout; mouth ventral;  spiracle sinistral, located about two-thirds distance from snout to  posterior edge of body; anal tube dextral; caudal musculature moderately  heavy, straight; dorsal fin not extending onto body; fins deepest at  about two-fifths length of tail, where depth of caudal musculature about  equal to depth of dorsal and depth of ventral fin; musculature  extending nearly to tip of tail; body dark grayish brown above and pale  grayish tan below with small dark brown spots dorsally and white flecks  laterally; caudal musculature pale tan with dark brown flecks over  entire surface and dark brown streaks on posterior one-half of ventral  fin and on all of dorsal fin (Fig. 14B). Median one-third of upper lip  bare; rest of mouth bordered by a single row of conical papillae;  lateral fold present; tooth rows 2/3; upper rows cone-shaped, about  equal in length, broadly /\\-shaped; second upper row narrowly  interrupted medially; lower rows complete, about equal in length, but  slightly shorter than upper rows; upper beak moderately massive, its  inner surface forming a continuous arch with short lateral processes;  lower beak broadly \\/-shaped; both beaks finely serrate (Fig. 15D).    Tadpoles from El Volcan, Chiriqui (KU 91833), are more heavily pigmented  than those from Finca La Sombadora; the spots on the tail are larger. In  life these tadpoles had dark brownish black bodies with golden and green  lichenous flecks; the tail was tan with dark brown markings, and the  iris was a grayish bronze color. In life tadpoles from Finca La  Sumbadora were olive-tan above and dark gray with pale bluish gray  irridescent spots ventrally. The caudal musculature was creamy tan with  brown flecks and streaks, and the iris was pale bronze.    Metamorphosing young have been found on vegetation at the edge of  streams and have been raised in the laboratory. Seven recently  metamorphosed young have snout-vent lengths of 13.6 to 15.6 mm. (14.6  mm.). A living juvenile (KU 91913) raised in the laboratory from a  tadpole obtained at Finca La Sumbadora had a brown dorsum with darker  brown markings, a white spot below the eye, and a narrow white labial  stripe. The belly was white; the flanks were brown with white spots, and  the posterior surfaces of the thighs were yellowish tan. The iris was a  golden bronze color with much black reticulation.    _Remarks._--This species has been confused with _Smilisca sordida_; most  authors have referred both species to _Hyla (Smilisca) gabbi_.  Examination of the types of _Hyla sordida_, _gabbi_, _salvini_, and  _nigripes_ revealed that all of the names were referable to a single  species (_S. sordida_), and that the small, blunt-snouted species in  Panama and southern Costa Rica probably was without a name. Possibly  _Hyla molitor_ Schmidt (1857) is based on the species that we have named  _S. sila_, but several discrepancies in his description, plus the  unknown provenance of the type, have led us to discount the  applicability of that name to the species under consideration.    _Distribution._--_Smilisca sila_ ranges along the Pacific slopes and  lowlands of southern Costa Rica and Panama at elevations from sea level  to about 1300 meters; in northern South America the species occurs in  the Caribbean lowlands and in the valleys of the northward draining  rivers of Colombia (Fig. 3).    _Specimens examined_, 234, as follows: COSTA RICA: =Puntarenas=: 6 km.
