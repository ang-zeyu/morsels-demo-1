Unless they  are deflected by a denser or rarer air, when they will be bent at  some point, but so long as the air is free from grossness or  moisture they will preserve their direct course, always carrying the  image of the object that intercepts them back to their point of  origin. And if this is the eye, the intercepting object will be seen  by its colour, as well as by form and size. But if the intercepting  plane has in it some small perforation opening into a darker  chamber--not darker in colour, but by absence of light--you will see  the rays enter through this hole and transmitting to the plane  beyond all the details of the object they proceed from both as to  colour and form; only every thing will be upside down. But the size  [of the image] where the lines are reconstructed will be in  proportion to the relative distance of the aperture from the plane  on which the lines fall [on one hand] and from their origin [on the  other]. There they intersect and form 2 pyramids with their point  meeting [a common apex] and their bases opposite. Let _a b_ be the  point of origin of the lines, _d e_ the first plane, and _c_ the  aperture with the intersection of the lines; _f g_ is the inner  plane. You will find that _a_ falls upon the inner plane below at  _g_, and _b_ which is below will go up to the spot _f_; it will be  quite evident to experimenters that every luminous body has in  itself a core or centre, from which and to which all the lines  radiate which are sent forth by the surface of the luminous body and  reflected back to it; or which, having been thrown out and not  intercepted, are dispersed in the air.    131.    THE RAYS WHETHER SHADED OR LUMINOUS HAVE GREATER STRENGTH AND EFFECT  AT THEIR POINTS THAN AT THEIR SIDES.    Although the points of luminous pyramids may extend into shaded  places and those of pyramids of shadow into illuminated places, and  though among the luminous pyramids one may start from a broader base  than another; nevertheless, if by reason of their various length  these luminous pyramids acquire angles of equal size their light  will be equal; and the case will be the same with the pyramids of  shadow; as may be seen in the intersected pyramids _a b c_ and _d e  f_, which though their bases differ in size are equal as to breadth  and light.    [Footnote: 51--55: This supplementary paragraph is indicated as being  a continuation of line 45, by two small crosses.]    The difference between light and lustre (132--135).    132.    Of the difference between light and lustre; and that lustre is not  included among colours, but is saturation of whiteness, and derived  from the surface of wet bodies; light partakes of the colour of the  object which reflects it (to the eye) as gold or silver or the like.    133.    OF THE HIGHEST LIGHTS WHICH TURN AND MOVE AS THE EYE MOVES WHICH  SEES THE OBJECT.    Suppose the body to be the round object figured here and let the  light be at the point _a_, and let the illuminated side of the  object be _b c_ and the eye at the point _d_: I say that, as lustre  is every where and complete in each part, if you stand at the point  _d_ the lustre will appear at _c_, and in proportion as the eye  moves from _d_ to _a_, the lustre will move from _c_ to _n_.    134.    OF PAINTING.    Heigh light or lustre on any object is not situated [necessarily] in  the middle of an illuminated object, but moves as and where the eye  moves in looking at it.    135.    OF LIGHT AND LUSTRE.    What is the difference between light and the lustre which is seen on  the polished surface of opaque bodies?    The lights which are produced from the polished surface of opaque  bodies will be stationary on stationary objects even if the eye on  which they strike moves. But reflected lights will, on those same  objects, appear in as many different places on the surface as  different positions are taken by the eye.    WHAT BODIES HAVE LIGHT UPON THEM WITHOUT LUSTRE?    Opaque bodies which have a hard and rough surface never display any  lustre in any portion of the side on which the light falls.    WHAT BODIES WILL DISPLAY LUSTRE BUT NOT LOOK ILLUMINATED?    Those bodies which are opaque and hard with a hard surface reflect  light [lustre] from every spot on the illuminated side which is in a  position to receive light at the same angle of incidence as they  occupy with regard to the eye; but, as the surface mirrors all the  surrounding objects, the illuminated [body] is not recognisable in  these portions of the illuminated body.    136.    The relations of luminous to illuminated bodies.    The middle of the light and shade on an object in light and shade is  opposite to the middle of the primary light. All light and shadow  expresses itself in pyramidal lines. The middle of the shadow on any  object must necessarily be opposite the middle of its light, with a  direct line passing through the centre of the body. The middle of  the light will be at _a_, that of the shadow at _b_. [Again, in  bodies shown in light and shade the middle of each must coincide  with the centre of the body, and a straight line will pass through  both and through that centre.]    [Footnote: In the original MS., at the spot marked _a_ of the first  diagram Leonardo wrote _primitiuo_, and at the spot marked  _c_--_primitiva_ (primary); at the spot marked _b_ he wrote  _dirivatiuo_ and at _d deriuatiua_ (derived).]    Experiments on the relation of light and shadow within a room  (137--140).    137.    SHOWS HOW LIGHT FROM ANY SIDE CONVERGES TO ONE POINT.    Although the balls _a b c_ are lighted from one window,  nevertheless, if you follow the lines of their shadows you will see  they intersect at a point forming the angle _n_.    [Footnote: The diagram belonging to this passage is slightly  sketched on Pl. XXXII; a square with three balls below it. The first  three lines of the text belonging to it are written above the sketch  and the six others below it.]    138.    Every shadow cast by a body has a central line directed to a single  point produced by the intersection of luminous lines in the middle  of the opening and thickness of the window. The proposition stated  above, is plainly seen by experiment. Thus if you draw a place with  a window looking northwards, and let this be _s f_, you will see a  line starting from the horizon to the east, which, touching the 2  angles of the window _o f_, reaches _d_; and from the horizon on the  west another line, touching the other 2 angles _r s_, and ending at  _c_; and their intersection falls exactly in the middle of the  opening and thickness of the window. Again, you can still better  confirm this proof by placing two sticks, as shown at _g h_; and you  will see the line drawn from the centre of the shadow directed to  the centre _m_ and prolonged to the horizon _n f_.    [Footnote: _B_ here stands for _cerchio del' orizonte tramontano_ on  the original diagram (the circle of the horizon towards the North);  _A_ for _levante_ (East) and _C_ for _ponete_ (West).]    139.    Every shadow with all its variations, which becomes larger as its  distance from the object is greater, has its external lines  intersecting in the middle, between the light and the object. This  proposition is very evident and is confirmed by experience. For, if  _a b_ is a window without any object interposed, the luminous  atmosphere to the right hand at _a_ is seen to the left at _d_. And  the atmosphere at the left illuminates on the right at _c_, and the  lines intersect at the point _m_.    [Footnote: _A_ here stands for _levante_ (East), _B_ for _ponente_  (West).]    140.    Every body in light and shade is situated between 2 pyramids one  dark and the other luminous, one is visible the other is not. But  this only happens when the light enters by a window. Supposing _a b_  to be the window and _r_ the body in light and shade, the light to  the right hand _z_ will pass the object to the left and go on to  _p_; the light to the left at _k_ will pass to the right of the  object at _i_ and go on to _m_ and the two lines will intersect at  _c_ and form a pyramid. Then again _a_ _b_ falls on the shaded body  at _i_ _g_ and forms a pyramid _f_ _i_ _g_. _f_ will be dark because  the light _a_ _b_ can never fall there; _i_ _g_ _c_ will be  illuminated because the light falls upon it.    Light and shadow with regard to the position of the eye (141--145).    141.    Every shaded body that is larger than the pupil and that interposes  between the luminous body and the eye will be seen dark.    When the eye is placed between the luminous body and the objects  illuminated by it, these objects will be seen without any shadow.    [Footnote: The diagram which in the original stands above line 1 is  given on Plate II, No 2. Then, after a blank space of about eight  lines, the diagram Plate II No 3 is placed in the original. There is  no explanation of it beyond the one line written under it.]    142.    Why the 2 lights one on each side of a body having two pyramidal  sides of an obtuse apex leave it devoid of shadow.    [Footnote: The sketch illustrating this is on Plate XLI No 1.]    143.    A body in shadow situated between the light and the eye can never  display its illuminated portion unless the eye can see the whole of  the primary light.    [Footnote: _A_ stands for _corpo_ (body), _B_ for _lume_ (light).]    144.    The eye which looks (at a spot) half way between the shadow and the  light which surrounds the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/502"],[0,"Desert Gold (#15)"],[1," had some fine stock.  But these are Mexican.  They came  from Durango, where they were bred.  Mexican horses are the finest in  the world, bar none.\"    \"Shore I reckon I savvy why you don't sleep nights,\" drawled Laddy. \"I  see a Greaser out there--no, it's an Indian.\"    \"That's my Papago herdsman.  I keep watch over the horses now day and  night.  Lord, how I'd hate to have Rojas or Salazar--any of those  bandit rebels--find my horses!... Gale, can you ride?\"    Dick modestly replied that he could, according to the Eastern idea of  horsemanship.    \"You don't need to be half horse to ride one of that bunch.  But over  there in the other field I've iron-jawed broncos I wouldn't want you to  tackle--except to see the fun.  I've an outlaw I'll gamble even Laddy  can't ride.\"    \"So.  How much'll you gamble?\" asked Laddy, instantly.    The ringing of a bell, which Belding said was a call to supper, turned  the men back toward the house.  Facing that way, Gale saw dark,  beetling ridges rising from the oasis and leading up to bare, black  mountains.  He had heard Belding call them No Name Mountains, and  somehow the appellation suited those lofty, mysterious, frowning peaks.    It was not until they reached the house and were about to go in that  Belding chanced to discover Gale's crippled hand.    \"What an awful hand!\" he exclaimed.  \"Where the devil did you get that?\"    \"I stove in my knuckles on Rojas,\" replied Dick.    \"You did that in one punch?  Say, I'm glad it wasn't me you hit! Why  didn't you tell me?  That's a bad hand.  Those cuts are full of dirt  and sand.  Inflammation's setting in.  It's got to be dressed.  Nell!\"  he called.    There was no answer.  He called again, louder.    \"Mother, where's the girl?\"    \"She's there in the dining-room,\" replied Mrs. Belding.    \"Did she hear me?\" he inquired, impatiently.    \"Of course.\"    \"Nell!\" roared Belding.    This brought results.  Dick saw a glimpse of golden hair and a white  dress in the door.  But they were not visible longer than a second.    \"Dad, what's the matter?\" asked a voice that was still as sweet as  formerly, but now rather small and constrained.    \"Bring the antiseptics, cotton, bandages--and things out here. Hurry  now.\"    Belding fetched a pail of water and a basin from the kitchen.  His wife  followed him out, and, upon seeing Dick's hand, was all solicitude.  Then Dick heard light, quick footsteps, but he did not look up.    \"Nell, this is Mr. Gale--Dick Gale, who came with the boys last last  night,\" said Belding.  \"He's got an awful hand.  Got it punching that  greaser Rojas.  I want you to dress it.... Gale, this is my  step-daughter, Nell Burton, of whom I spoke.  She's some good when  there's somebody sick or hurt.  Shove out your fist, my boy, and let  her get at it.  Supper's nearly ready.\"    Dick felt that same strange, quickening heart throb, yet he had never  been cooler in his life.  More than anything else in the world he  wanted to look at Nell Burton; however, divining that the situation  might be embarrassing to her, he refrained from looking up.  She began  to bathe his injured knuckles.  He noted the softness, the deftness of  her touch, and then it seemed her fingers were not quite as steady as  they might have been.  Still, in a moment they appeared to become surer  in their work.  She had beautiful hands, not too large, though  certainly not small, and they were strong, brown, supple.  He observed  next, with stealthy, upward-stealing glance, that she had rolled up her  sleeves, exposing fine, round arms graceful in line.  Her skin was  brown--no, it was more gold than brown.  It had a wonderful clear tint.  Dick stoically lowered his eyes then, putting off as long as possible  the alluring moment when he was to look into her face.  That would be a  fateful moment.  He played with a certain strange joy of anticipation.  When, however, she sat down beside him and rested his injured hand in  her lap as she cut bandages, she was so thrillingly near that he  yielded to an irrepressible desire to look up.  She had a sweet, fair  face warmly tinted with that same healthy golden-brown sunburn.  Her  hair was light gold and abundant, a waving mass.  Her eyes were shaded  by long, downcast lashes, yet through them he caught a gleam of blue.    Despite the stir within him, Gale, seeing she was now absorbed in her  task, critically studied her with a second closer gaze. She was a  sweet, wholesome, joyous, pretty girl.    \"Shore it musta hurt?\" replied Laddy, who sat an interested spectator.    \"Yes, I confess it did,\" replied Dick, slowly, with his eyes on Nell's  face.  \"But I didn't mind.\"    The girl's lashes swept up swiftly in surprise.  She had taken his  words literally.  But the dark-blue eyes met his for only a fleeting  second.  Then the warm tint in her cheeks turned as red as her lips.  Hurriedly she finished tying the bandage and rose to her feet.    \"I thank you,\" said Gale, also rising.    With that Belding appeared in the doorway, and finding the operation  concluded, called them in to supper.  Dick had the use of only one arm,  and he certainly was keenly aware of the shy, silent girl across the  table; but in spite of these considerable handicaps he eclipsed both  hungry cowboys in the assault upon Mrs. Belding's bounteous supper.  Belding talked, the cowboys talked more or less.  Mrs. Belding put in a  word now and then, and Dick managed to find brief intervals when it was  possible for him to say yes or no.  He observed gratefully that no one  round the table seemed to be aware of his enormous appetite.    After supper, having a favorable opportunity when for a moment no one  was at hand, Dick went out through the yard, past the gardens and  fields, and climbed the first knoll.  From that vantage point he looked  out over the little hamlet, somewhat to his right, and was surprised at  its extent, its considerable number of adobe houses.  The overhanging  mountains, ragged and darkening, a great heave of splintered rock,  rather chilled and affronted him.    Westward the setting sun gilded a spiked, frost-colored, limitless  expanse of desert.  It awed Gale.  Everywhere rose blunt, broken ranges  or isolated groups of mountains.  Yet the desert stretched away down  between and beyond them.  When the sun set and Gale could not see so  far, he felt a relief.    That grand and austere attraction of distance gone, he saw the desert  nearer at hand--the valley at his feet.  What a strange gray, somber  place!  There was a lighter strip of gray winding down between darker  hues.  This he realized presently was the river bed, and he saw how the  pools of water narrowed and diminished in size till they lost  themselves in gray sand.  This was the rainy season, near its end, and  here a little river struggled hopelessly, forlornly to live in the  desert.  He received a potent impression of the nature of that blasted  age-worn waste which he had divined was to give him strength and work  and love.        V    A DESERT ROSE    BELDING assigned Dick to a little room which had no windows but two  doors, one opening into the patio, the other into the yard on the west  side of the house.  It contained only the barest necessities for  comfort.  Dick mentioned the baggage he had left in the hotel at  Casita, and it was Belding's opinion that to try to recover his  property would be rather risky; on the moment Richard Gale was probably  not popular with the Mexicans at Casita.  So Dick bade good-by to fine  suits of clothes and linen with a feeling that, as he had said farewell  to an idle and useless past, it was just as well not to have any old  luxuries as reminders.  As he possessed, however, not a thing save the  clothes on his back, and not even a handkerchief, he expressed regret  that he had come to Forlorn River a beggar.    \"Beggar hell!\" exploded Belding, with his eyes snapping in the  lamplight.  \"Money's the last thing we think of out here.  All the  same, Gale, if you stick you'll be rich.\"    \"It wouldn't surprise me,\" replied Dick, thoughtfully.  But he was not  thinking of material wealth.  Then, as he viewed his stained and torn  shirt, he laughed and said \"Belding, while I'm getting rich I'd like to  have some respectable clothes.\"    \"We've a little Mex store in town, and what you can't get there the  women folks will make for you.\"    When Dick lay down he was dully conscious of pain and headache, that he  did not feel well.  Despite this, and a mind thronging with memories  and anticipations, he succumbed to weariness and soon fell asleep.    It was light when he awoke, but a strange brightness seen through what  seemed blurred eyes.  A moment passed before his mind worked clearly,  and then he had to make an effort to think.  He was dizzy. When he  essayed to lift his right arm, an excruciating pain made him desist.  Then he discovered that his arm was badly swollen, and the hand had  burst its bandages.  The injured member was red, angry, inflamed, and  twice its normal size.  He felt hot all over, and a raging headache  consumed him.    Belding came stamping into the room.    \"Hello, Dick.  Do you know it's late?  How's the busted fist this  morning?\"    Dick tried to sit up, but his effort was a failure.  He got about half  up, then felt himself weakly sliding back.    \"I guess--I'm pretty sick,\" he said.    He saw Belding lean over him, feel his face, and speak, and then  everything seemed to drift, not into darkness, but into some region  where he had dim perceptions of gray moving things, and of voices that  were remote.  Then there came an interval when all was blank. He knew  not whether it was one of minutes or hours, but after it he had a  clearer mind.  He slept, awakened during night-time, and slept again.  When he again unclosed his eyes the room was sunny, and cool with a  fragrant breeze that blew through the open door. Dick felt better; but  he had no particular desire to"]]]
