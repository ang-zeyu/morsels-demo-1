[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4602"],[0,"\"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\" (#15)"],[1," has gone on existing up to now.  And it cannot fail to exist so  long as the conception of a church exists.  Heresy is the obverse  side of the Church.  Wherever there is a church, there must be the  conception of heresy.  A church is a body of men who assert that  they are in possession of infallible truth.  Heresy is the opinion  of the men who do not admit the infallibility of the Church's  truth.    Heresy makes its appearance in the Church.  It is the effort to  break through the petrified authority of the Church.  All effort  after a living comprehension of the doctrine has been made by  heretics.  Tertullian, Origen, Augustine, Luther, Huss,  Savonarola, Helchitsky, and the rest were heretics.  It could not  be otherwise.    The follower of Christ, whose service means an ever-growing  understanding of his teaching, and an ever-closer fulfillment of  it, in progress toward perfection, cannot, just because he is a  follower, of Christ, claim for himself or any other that he  understands Christ's teaching fully and fulfills it.  Still less  can he claim this for any body of men.    To whatever degree of understanding and perfection the follower of  Christ may have attained, he always feels the insufficiency of his  understanding and fulfillment of it, and is always striving toward  a fuller understanding and fulfillment.  And therefore, to assert  of one's self or of any body of men, that one is or they are in  possession of perfect understanding and fulfillment of Christ's  word, is to renounce the very spirit of Christ's teaching.    Strange as it may seem, the churches as churches have always been,  and cannot but be, institutions not only alien in spirit to  Christ's teaching, but even directly antagonistic to it.  With  good reason Voltaire calls the Church l'infame; with good reason  have all or almost all so-called sects of Christians recognized  the Church as the scarlet woman foretold in the Apocalypse; with  good reason is the history of the Church the history of the  greatest cruelties and horrors.    The churches as churches are not, as many people suppose,  institutions which have Christian principles for their basis, even  though they may have strayed a little away from the straight path.  The churches as churches, as bodies which assert their own  infallibility, are institutions opposed to Christianity.  There is  not only nothing in common between the churches as such and  Christianity, except the name, but they represent two principles  fundamentally opposed and antagonistic to one another.  One  represents pride, violence, self-assertion, stagnation, and death;  the other, meekness, penitence, humility, progress, and life.    We cannot serve these two masters; we have to choose between  them.    The servants of the churches of all denominations, especially of  later times, try to show themselves champions of progress in  Christianity.  They make concessions, wish to correct the abuses  that have slipped into the Church, and maintain that one cannot,  on account of these abuses, deny the principle itself of a  Christian church, which alone can bind all men together in unity  and be a mediator between men and God.  But this is all a mistake.  Not only have churches never bound men together in unity; they  have always been one of the principal causes of division between  men, of their hatred of one another, of wars, battles,  inquisitions, massacres of St. Bartholomew, and so on.  And the  churches have never served as mediators between men and God.  Such  mediation is not wanted, and was directly forbidden by Christ, who  has revealed his teaching directly and immediately to each man.  But the churches set up dead forms in the place of God, and far  from revealing God, they obscure him from men's sight.  The  churches, which originated from misunderstanding of Christ's  teaching and have maintained this misunderstanding by their  immovability, cannot but persecute and refuse to recognize all  true understanding of Christ's words.  They try to conceal this,  but in vain; for every step forward along the path pointed out for  us by Christ is a step toward their destruction.    To hear and to read the sermons and articles in which Church writers of  later times of all denominations speak of Christian truths and virtues;  to hear or read these skillful arguments that have been elaborated  during centuries, and exhortations and professions, which sometimes seem  like sincere professions, one is ready to doubt whether the churches can  be antagonistic to Christianity. \"It cannot be,\" one says, \"that these  people who can point to such men as Chrysostom, Fenelon, Butler, and  others professing the Christian faith, were antagonistic to  Christianity.\" One is tempted to say, \"The churches may have strayed  away from Christianity, they may be in error, but they cannot be hostile  to it.\" But we must look to the fruit to judge the tree, as Christ  taught us. And if we see that their fruits were evil, that the results  of their activity were antagonistic to Christianity, we cannot but admit  that however good the men were--the work of the Church in which these  men took part was not Christian. The goodness and worth of these men who  served the churches was the goodness and worth of the men, and not of  the institution they served. All the good men, such as Francis of  Assisi, and Francis of Sales, our Tihon Zadonsky, Thomas a Kempis, and  others, were good men in spite of their serving an institution hostile  to Christianity, and they would have been still better if they had not  been under the influence of the error which they were serving.    But why should we speak of the past and judge from the past, which  may have been misrepresented and misunderstood by us?  The  churches, with their principles and their practice, are not a  thing of the past.  The churches are before us to-day, and we can  judge of them to some purpose by their practical activity, their  influence on men.    What is the practical work of the churches to-day?  What is their  influence upon men?  What is done by the churches among us, among  the Catholics and the Protestants of all denominations--what is  their practical work? and what are the results of their practical  work?    The practice of our Russian so-called Orthodox Church is plain to  all.  It is an enormous fact which there is no possibility of  hiding and about which there can be no disputing.    What constitutes the practical work of this Russian Church, this  immense, intensely active institution, which consists of a  regiment of half a million men and costs the people tens of  millions of rubles?    The practical business of the Church consists in instilling by  every conceivable means into the mass of one hundred millions of  the Russian people those extinct relics of beliefs for which there  is nowadays no kind of justification, \"in which scarcely anyone  now believes, and often not even those whose duty it is to diffuse  these false beliefs.\"  To instill into the people the formulas of  Byzantine theology, of the Trinity, of the Mother of God, of  Sacraments, of Grace, and so on, extinct conceptions, foreign to  us, and having no kind of meaning for men of our times,  forms only one part of the work of the Russian Church.  Another  part of its practice consists in the maintenance of idol-worship  in the most literal meaning of the word; in the veneration of holy  relics, and of ikons, the offering of sacrifices to them, and the  expectation of their answers to prayer.  I am not going to speak  of what is preached and what is written by clergy of scientific or  liberal tendencies in the theological journals.  I am going to  speak of what is actually done by the clergy through the wide  expanse of the Russian land among a people of one hundred  millions.  What do they, diligently, assiduously, everywhere  alike, without intermission, teach the people?  What do they  demand from the people in virtue of their (so-called) Christian  faith?    I will begin from the beginning with the birth of a child.  At the  birth of a child they teach them that they must recite a prayer  over the child and mother to purify them, as though without this  prayer the mother of a newborn child were unclean.  To do this the  priest holds the child in his arms before the images of the saints  (called by the people plainly gods) and reads words of exorcizing  power, and this purifies the mother.  Then it is suggested to the  parents, and even exacted of them, under fear of punishment for  non-fulfillment, that the child must be baptized; that is, be  dipped by the priest three times into the water, while certain  words, understood by no one, are read aloud, and certain actions,  still less understood, are performed; various parts of the body  are rubbed with oil, and the hair is cut, while the sponsors blow  and spit at an imaginary devil.  All this is necessary to purify  the child and to make him a Christian.  Then it is instilled into  the parents that they ought to administer the sacrament to the  child, that is, give him, in the guise of bread and wine, a  portion of Christ's body to eat, as a result of which the child  receives the grace of God within it, and so on.  Then it is  suggested that the child as it grows up must be taught to pray.  To pray means to place himself directly before the wooden boards  on which are painted the faces of Christ, the Mother of God, and  the saints, to bow his head and his whole body, and to touch his  forehead, his shoulders and his stomach with his right hand,  holding his fingers in a certain position, and to utter some words  of Slavonic, the most usual of which as taught to all children  are: Mother of God, virgin, rejoice thee, etc., etc.    Then it is instilled into the child as it is brought up that at  the sight of any church or ikon he must repeat the same action--i. e.,  cross himself.  Then it is instilled into him that on holidays  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46092"],[0,"A Little Pilgrimage in Italy (#15)"],[1,"of United Italy, with their smug municipal  dignity sitting in the midst of tatterdemalion glory! Here, in this  very chamber where to-day Lippo Memmi's great fresco of the Virgin  and Child, enthroned among the angels, looks down on office chairs  and ink-stained tables covered with American cloth, came Dante  in the year of the first jubilee, 1300, in all the splendour of  Florentine embassy! Here he spake to the lords of San Gimignano,  and invited them to send representatives to the election of a  captain to lead the Ghibelline League of Tuscany. Here, where  all the petty business of a little town is ratified, the men of  San Gimignano were wont to deal with their affairs of state, to  settle wars, and speak of popes and emperors. We read the story  of it round the walls--Memmi's fresco with its proud baldachin of  armorial bearings surmounted by the Ghibelline eagle has effaced  the greater part of it, but under the timber roof are the arms  of the noble families of San Gimignano; and below them jousting  knights tilt at invisible combatants, long ago lost in plaster;  and huntsmen chase their vanished prey; and the Guelphs and  Ghibellines fight out their everlasting warfare in dim distemper.    The sunset was gilding the towers of San Gimignano when we came  out again, and all the bells were ringing for evensong. Already  the streets were bound in shadows, so we wandered out among the  olive-trees to the little ruined church of the Templars. From here  we passed out of the city by an ancient gate, and down the hill  to the Gothic washing-pool, where the women of San Gimignano wash  and wring their linen in the cool of the evening. The delicate  afterglow of Tuscany filled the sky, and the tall poplars whispered  and shivered in the sunset wind. Up and down that steep and  stony hill under the old Gothic gate went the women, with their  snowy linen piled in baskets on their heads. The sound of their  voices and laughter floated back to us, mingled with the music of  bells from the city above. In the hollow below the road a little  waterfall babbled to the stones as it leapt over them to the plain.  Between the whispering poplars a white road wound up the hill like  the roads up which Benozzo Gozzoli's stately young men rode to  their Gothic cities. And below, stretching far away to the east  where it was lost in rose and purple mists, billowed the vast Val  d'Elsa.    Seen through the magic of a summer evening--when the poplars were  making music in the breeze, and the shadows were sweeping across  the Tuscan plain; when the women, having folded their linen under  the silver olives and piled it on their heads, climbed the steep  hill into their tower-girt home--the world and all its doings were  as beautiful as a sacrament. Here, at least, in these dim forgotten  _paesi_, 'glory and loveliness have not passed away.'    But, after all, it is at night that San Gimignano is most  beautiful. Then she is a city bewitched, unspeakably lovely and  romantic. Her silent streets are thronged with memories; her  shuttered palaces are given back to ghosts; her proud old towers  loom up against the star-lit sky like mediaeval giants.    A silver moon was riding low in the heavens when we left the  doorway of the Leon Bianco and passed through the Arco de' Becci,  the great gateway of the ancient circuit of walls, which leads at  once into the heart of San Gimignano. It was velvet-black under  its ghostly tower, and the Gothic palaces of the Castello Vecchio  within seemed to be holding their breath as they watched the  shadows creeping over the pale stones of the piazza. How silent and  deserted it was! The lovely grave-eyed children, who had been our  guides all day, had vanished with their gentle mothers, whom we had  seen spinning in their doorways through the sunny hours. Where had  they gone? There were no lights in any of these silent palaces, and  the narrow streets were empty except for the shadows of the towers,  grim as bloodstains.    [Illustration: SAN GIMIGNANO.]    A white owl, soundless of wing, sank on to the parapet of an  ancient palace. Imagination plays strange tricks in this city of  ghosts, in whose streets an August moon, more than five hundred  years ago, bore witness to the greatest tragedy in the vendetta of  the Ardinghelli and the Salvucci. Was it a bird, or did I see a  scrap of paper flutter from the window of that dark tower? No. It  was only a piece of broken glass glittering among the stones--fit  emblem of the broken hopes of those two hapless boys whom Benedetto  Strozzi so foully did to death by the persuasion of the treacherous  Salvucci. Their letter went astray, thrown from the prison tower,  in the hope that a friendly breeze would carry it to the feet of  an adherent of the Ardinghelli. And very soon afterwards they met  their death, by the steps of the Palazzo Comunale, early on a  summer morning, hurriedly, because Strozzi and the Salvucci knew  that the messenger who was riding from Florence with their pardon  would be delayed only a few hours by the rising of the Elsa. He  came too late, as he was meant to do. The Salvucci had already  reaped their bloody harvest--the heads of Primerano and Rossellino,  the flowers of the noble house of Ardinghelli, had fallen to the  sickle.    It was late, and the sleepy porter of the White Lion yawned  reproachfully as we passed him on our way to the Porta San  Giovanni, whither we were bound to view the city and rid ourselves  of shadows. If tragedy lurked within the narrow streets and  byways of San Gimignano, we found nothing but beauty without. The  moonlight, flooding her broken walls and picturesque old gates,  transformed her into a city of pale jade, crowning a gloom-dark  hill. Her diadem of ghostly towers seemed enamoured of the sky, and  soared towards the heaven like young Endymion, stretching out his  arms to his enchantress. Down the hillside poured her palaces,  white as marble, rising in terraces from their dark gardens, and  far away we could hear the plaintive cry of the city watchmen as  they went their solitary rounds. At our feet a sheer cliff, filled  to the level of the road with trees, fell into the night. From  its mysterious depths ascended the fragrance of wet earth and the  bell-like chant of frogs. And beyond, and all round, lay the broad  fields of Tuscany, filled with a sea of moonlit mists, from which  the fantastic outlines of little hills rolled up, like shadowy  waves, with towered farms and slim black cypresses upon their  crests.          MONTE OLIVETO MAGGIORE      Austere and terrible, barren as the Valley of the Shadow of Death,  is the desert of Accona, where Bernardo Tolomei founded the  monastery of Monte Oliveto Maggiore.    At Asciano we left behind us the fruitful gardens of Tuscany,  rippling with vines, and rich with maize and olives, and embarked  upon a sea of pallid hills. It was as though a blight had fallen.  The naked earth was parched and rent with gaping fissures; the  tamarisks and spurges and the drab grass which fringed the roadside  were old and dry. The smiling valleys fled to the north and the  south as from a land accursed, 'and lo, the fruitful place was a  wilderness.'    Our way lay along a bleached white road which seared the grey  hillside and writhed among volcanic mounds and precipices. Here  and there the drab monotony was broken by the clustered spires of  cypresses round scattered farms; but their black foliage, like  funeral plumes, only added a deeper note of melancholy. It was  hot too. The August sun beat down upon us from a brazen sky, and  the glare of the road made our eyes ache for cool green shadows.  But when we reached the plateau a vision of surpassing beauty  burst upon us. It was as though, after sojourning for many hours  in the wilderness, we looked from Pisgah on the promised land. To  our right, across miles of pale clay gorges and volcanic mounds,  Siena lay rosy and smiling in her vineyards; on the other hand a  wide valley full of precipices rolled away to the purple hills of  Umbria, which hung like a mirage between earth and sky, with Monte  Amiata lifting her proud head above them all. And presently, after  we had passed through Chiusure, a shrunken little town in the heart  of a green oasis, we caught our first glimpse of Monte Oliveto.    Below the road the hill fell away in a deep ravine, whose tortured  sides were torn and scarred by torrents, as though the pallid  earth had bared an ancient wound. And in the midst of the grey  desolation, with towering cliffs above, and wild precipices  leaping down into the valley below, stood the Abbey of the Blessed  Bernardo. Grim and forbidding as a fortress were its bare red  walls, devoid of ornament, only redeemed from positive ugliness by  their austerity and rugged strength. And yet, as we approached the  monastery through the fragrant shade of cypress avenues, the scent  of pine needles and the song of cicalas rose together like the  voice of the wilderness and the solitary place which has been made  glad.    [Illustration: CHIUSURE FROM MONTE OLIVETO MAGGIORE.]    For, indeed, S. Bernardo and his companions laboured to make this  wilderness blossom like a rose. Early in the fourteenth century  he put aside the vanities of life. At the height of his glory,  when all Siena was ringing with his brilliance and prodigality,  he left the city, fleeing, like Shelley, from the awful spectre  of his veiled self, asking 'Are you satisfied?' And coming into  the desert of Accona he dwelt here in poverty and simplicity,  building a little chapel to Santa Scolastica, the sister of St.  Benedict, and leading a life of prayer and meditation. We read  that a great number of followers, many of them noble, came to him,  and lived upon the hillside, striving by the sweat of their brows  to transform the Tuscan desert into a garden. But in that day of  Guelph and Ghibelline disorders the rulers of Siena"]]]
