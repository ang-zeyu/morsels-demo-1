I want it so that a person can go into a booth, call up  a friend, and then switch on the picture plate, so he can see his  friend as well as talk to him. I want this plate to be like a  mirror, so that any number of images can be made to appear on it.  In that way it can be used over and over again. In fact it will be  exactly like a mirror, or a telescope. No matter how far two  persons may be apart they can both see and talk to one another.\"    \"That's a big contract, Tom.\"    \"Yes, but you've seen that it can be done. Then another thing I  want to do is to have it arranged so that I can make a photograph  of a person over a wire.\"    \"Meaning what?\"    \"Meaning that if a certain person talks to me over the wire, I can  turn my switch, and get a picture of him here at my apparatus  connected with my telephone. To do that I'll merely need a sending  apparatus at the other end of the telephone line--not a receiving  machine.\"    \"Could you arrange it so that the person who was talking to you  would have his picture taken whether he wanted it or not?\" asked  Ned.    \"Yes, it might be done,\" spoke Tom, thoughtfully. \"I could conceal  the sending plate somewhere in the telephone booth, and arrange  the proper light, I suppose.\"    \"That might be a good way in which to catch a criminal,\" went on  Ned. \"Often crooks call up on the telephone, but they know they  are safe. The authorities can't see them--they can only hear them.  Now if you could get a photograph of them while they were  telephoning--\"    \"I see!\" cried Tom, excitedly. \"That's a great idea! I'll work on  that, Ned.\"    And, all enthusiasm, Tom began to plan new schemes with his photo  telephone.    The young inventor did not forget his promise to help Mrs. Damon.  But he could get absolutely no clue to her husband's whereabouts.  Mr. Damon had completely and mysteriously disappeared. His  fortune, too, seemed to have been swallowed up by the sharpers,  though lawyers engaged by Tom could fasten no criminal acts on Mr.  Peters, who indignantly denied that he had done anything unlawful.    If he had, he had done it in such a way that he could not be  brought to justice. The promoter was still about Shopton, as well  groomed as ever, with his rose in his buttonhole, and wearing his  silk hat. He still speeded up and down Lake Carlopa in his  powerful motor boat. But he gave Tom Swift a wide berth.    Late one night, when Tom and Ned had been working at the new photo  telephone, after all the rest of the household had retired, Tom  suddenly looked up from his drawings and exclaimed:    \"What's that?\"    \"What's what?\" inquired Ned.    \"That sound? Don't you hear it? Listen!\"    \"It's an airship--maybe yours coming back!\" cried the young  banker.    As he spoke Ned did hear, seemingly in the air above the house, a  curious, throbbing, pulsating sound.    \"That's so! It is an airship motor!\" exclaimed Tom. \"Come on out!\"    Together they rushed from the house, but, ere they reached the  yard, the sound had ceased. They looked up into the sky, but could  see nothing, though the night was light from a full moon.    \"I certainly heard it,\" said Tom.    \"So did I,\" asserted Ned. \"But where is it now?\"    They advanced toward the group of work-buildings. Something  showing white in the moonlight, before the hangar, caught Ned's  eyes.    \"Look!\" he exclaimed. \"There's an airship, Tom!\"    The two rushed over to the level landing place before the big  shed. And there, as if she had just been run out for a flight, was  the Eagle. She had come back in the night, as mysteriously as she  had been taken away.            CHAPTER XVI    SUCCESS      \"Well, this gets me!\" exclaimed Tom.    \"It sure is strange,\" agreed Ned. \"How did she come here?\"    \"She didn't come alone--that's sure,\" went on Tom. \"Someone  brought her here, made a landing, and got away before we could get  out.\"    The two chums were standing near the Eagle, which had come back so  mysteriously.    \"Just a couple of seconds sooner and we'd have seen who brought  her here,\" went on Tom. \"But they must have shut off the motor  some distance up, and then they volplaned down. That's why we  didn't hear them.\"    Ned went over and put his hand on the motor.    \"Ouch!\" he cried, jumping back. \"It's hot!\"    \"Showing that she's been running up to within a few minutes ago,\"  said Tom. \"Well, as I said before, this sure does get me. First  these mysterious men take my airship, and then they bring her back  again, without so much as thanking me for the use of her.\"    \"Who in the world can they be?\" asked Ned.    \"I haven't the least idea. But I'm going to find out, if it's at  all possible. We'll look the machine over in the morning, and see  if we can get any clues. No use in doing that now. Come on, we'll  put her back in the hangar.\"    \"Say!\" exclaimed Ned, as a sudden idea came to him. \"It couldn't  be Mr. Damon who had your airship; could it, Tom?\"    \"I don't know. Why do you ask that?\"    \"Well, he might have wanted to get away from his enemies for a  while, and he might have taken your Eagle, and--\"    \"Mr. Damon wouldn't trail along with a crowd like the one that  took away my airship,\" said Tom, decidedly. \"You've got another  guess coming, Ned. Mr. Damon had nothing to do with this.\"    \"And yet the night he disappeared an airship was heard near his  house.\"    \"That's so. Well, I give up. This is sure a mystery. We'll have a  look at it in the morning. One thing I'll do, though, I'll  telephone over to Mr. Damon's house and see if his wife has heard  any news. I've been doing that quite often of late, so she won't  think anything of it. In that way we can find out if he had  anything to do with my airship. But let's run her into the shed  first.\"    This was done, and Koku, the giant, was sent to sleep in the  hangar to guard against another theft. But it was not likely that  the mysterious men, once having brought the airship back, would  come for it again.    Tom called up Mrs. Damon on the telephone, but there was no news  of the missing man. He expressed his sympathy, and said he would  come and see her soon. He told Mrs. Damon not to get discouraged,  adding that he, and others, were doing all that was possible. But,  in spite of this, Mrs. Damon, naturally, did worry.    The next morning the two chums inspected the airship, so  mysteriously returned to them. Part after part they went over, and  found nothing wrong. The motor ran perfectly, and there was not so  much as a bent spoke in the landing wheels. For all that could be  told by an inspection of the craft she might never have been out  of the hangar.    \"Hello, here's something!\" cried Tom, as he got up from the  operator's seat, where he had taken his place to test the various  controls.    \"What is it?\" asked Ned.    \"A button. A queer sort of a button. I never had any like that on  my clothes, and I'm sure you didn't. Look!\" and Tom held out a  large, metal button of curious design.    \"It must have come off the coat of one of the men who had your  airship, Tom,\" said his chum. \"Save it. You may find that it's a  clue.\"    \"I will. No telling what it may lead to. Well, I guess that's all  we can find.\"    And it was. But Tom little realized what a clue the button was  going to be. Nothing more could be learned by staring at the  returned airship, so he and Ned went back to the house.    Tom Swift had many things to do, but his chief concern was for the  photo telephone. Now that he was near the goal of success he  worked harder than ever. The idea Ned had given him of being able  to take the picture of a person at the instrument--without the  knowledge of that person--appealed strongly to Tom.    \"That's going to be a valuable invention!\" he declared, but little  he knew how valuable it would prove to him and to others.    It was about a week later when Tom was ready to try the new  apparatus. Meanwhile he had prepared different plates, and had  changed his wiring system. In the days that had passed nothing new  had been learned concerning the whereabouts of Mr. Damon, nor of  the men who had so mysteriously taken away Tom's airship.    All was in readiness for the trial. Tom sent Ned to the booth that  he had constructed in the airship hangar, some distance away from  the house. The other booth Tom had placed in his library, an  entirely new system of wires being used.    \"Now Ned,\" explained Tom, \"the idea is this! You go into that  booth, just as if it were a public one, and ring me up in the  regular way. Of course we haven't a central here, but that doesn't  matter. Now while I'm talking to you I want to see you. You don't  know that, of course.\"    \"The point is to see if I can get your picture while you're  talking to me, and not let you know a thing about it.\"    \"Think you can do it, Tom?\"    \"I'm going to try. We'll soon know. Go ahead.\"    A little later Ned was calling up his chum, as casually as he  could, under the circumstances.    \"All right!\" called Tom to his chum. \"Start in and talk. Say  anything you like--it doesn't matter. I want to see if I can get  your picture. Is the light burning in your booth?\"    \"Yes, Tom.\"    \"All right then. Go ahead.\"    Ned talked of the weather--of anything. Meanwhile Tom was busy.  Concealed in the booth occupied by Ned was a sending plate. It  could not be seen unless one knew just where to look for it. In  Tom's booth was a receiving plate.    The experiment did not take long. Presently Tom called to Ned that  he need stay there no longer.    \"Come on to the house,\" invited the young inventor, \"and we'll  develope this plate.\" For in this system it was necessary to  develope the receiving plate, as is done with an ordinary"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4544"],[0,"The Cell of Self-Knowledge : seven early English mystical treatises printed (#15)"],[1,"ever this grace shall be  gotten, it behoveth to be learned of God from within, unto whom thou  hast listily leaned many a day before with all the love of thine  heart, utterly voiding from thy ghostly beholding[268] all manner of  sight of any thing beneath Him; though all that some of those things  that I bid thee thus void, should seem in the sight of some men a  full worthy mean to get God by. Yea, say what men say will, but do  thou as I say thee, and let the proof witness. For to him that will  be soon sped of his purpose ghostly, it sufficeth to him for a mean,  and him needeth no more, but the actual mind of good God only, with  a reverent stirring of lasting love; so that mean unto God gettest  thou none but God. If thou keep whole thy stirring of love that thou  mayst feel by grace in thine heart, and scatter not thy ghostly  beholding therefrom then that same that thou feelest shall well  conne[269] tell thee when thou shalt speak and when thou shalt be  still, and it shall govern thee discreetly in all thy living without  any error, and teach thee mistily[270] how thou shalt begin and  cease in all such doing of kind with a great and sovereign  discretion. For if thou mayst by grace keep it in custom and in  continual working, then, if it be needful or speedful to thee for to  speak, for to commonly eat, or for to bide in company, or for to do  any such other thing that longeth to the common true custom of  Christian men, and of kind, it shall first stir thee full softly to  speak or to do that other common thing of kind, what so it be. And  then, if thou do it not, it shall strike as sore as a prick on thine  heart and pain thee full sore, and let thee have no peace[271] but  if thou do it. And, on the same manner, if thou be in speaking, or  in any such other work that is common to the course of kind, if it  be needful and speedful to thee to be still, and for to set thee to  the contrary, as is onliness to company, fasting to eating, and all  such other the which are works of singular holiness, it will stir  thee to them; so that thus, by experience of such a blind stirring  of love unto God, a contemplative soul cometh sooner to that grace  of discretion for to conne speak, and for to conne be still, for to  conne eat, and for to conne fast, for to conne be in company, and  for to conne be only,[272] and all such other, than by any such  singularities as thou speakest of, taken by the stirrings of man's  own wit and his will within in himself, or yet by the ensample of  any other man's doing without, what so it be. For why, such strained  doings under the stirrings of kind, without touching[273] of grace,  is a passing pain without any profit; but if it be to them that are  religious, or that have them by enjoining of penance, where profit  riseth only because of obedience, and not by any such straitness of  doing without; the which is painful to all that it proveth. But  lovely and listily to will to love[274] God is great and passing  ease, true ghostly peace, and earnest of the endless rest. And,  therefore, speak when thee list, and leave when thee list, eat when  thee list, and fast when thee list, be in company when thee list,  and be by thyself when thee list, so that[275] God and grace be thy  leader. Let fast who fast will, and be only who will, and let hold  silence who so will, but hold thee by God that doth beguile no man;  for silence and speaking, onliness and company, fasting and eating,  all may beguile thee. And if thou hear of any man that speaketh, or  of any that is still, of any that eateth or of any that fasteth, or  of any that is in company or else by himself, think thou, and say,  if thee list, that they conne do as they should do, but if the  contrary shew in apert.[276] But look that thou do not as they do (I  mean for that they do so) on ape's manner; for neither thou canst,  nor peradventure thou art not disposed as they are. And, therefore,  leave to work after other men's dispositions and work after thine  own, if thou mayst know what it is. And unto the time that thou  mayst know what it is, work after those men's counsel that know  their own disposition, but not after their disposition;[277] for  such men should give counsel in such cases, and else none. And this  sufficeth for an answer to all thy letter, as me thinketh; the grace  of God be ever more with thee, in the name of Jesu. AMEN.    FINIT EPISTOLA          VII.    HERE FOLLOWETH A DEVOUT TREATISE OF DISCERNING OF SPIRITS, VERY  NECESSARY FOR GHOSTLY LIVERS      FOR because that there be divers kinds of spirits, therefore it is  needful to us discreet knowing of them; sith it so is that we be  taught of the apostle saint John not to believe to all spirits.[278]  For it might seem to some that are but little in conning, and namely  of ghostly things, that each thought that soundeth in man's heart  should be the speech of none other spirit but only of man's own  spirit. And that it is not so, both belief and witness of holy  scripture proveth apertly; for \"I shall hear,\" saith the prophet  David, \"not what I speak myself, but what my Lord God speaketh in  me\";[279] and another prophet saith, that an angel spake in  him.[280] And also we be taught in the psalm that the wicked spirits  sendeth evil thoughts in to men; and over this, that there is a  spirit of the flesh not good, the apostle Paul sheweth apertly,  where he saith, that some men are full blown or inflate with the  spirit of their flesh.[281] And also that there is the spirit of the  world, he declareth plainly, where he maketh joy in God, not only  for himself, but also for his disciples, that they had not taken  that spirit of the world, but that that is sent of God, the which is  the Holy Ghost.[282] And these two spirits of the flesh and also of  the world are, as it were, servants or sergeants of that cursed  spirit, the foul fiend of hell; so that the spirit of wickedness is  lord of the spirit of the flesh, and also of the spirit of the  world. And which of these three spirits that speaketh to our spirit,  we should not believe them. For why, they speak never but that anon,  by their speaking, they lead to the loss both of body and of soul.  And which spirit it is that speaketh to our spirit, the speech of  that same spirit that speaketh shall fully declare; for ever more  the spirit of the flesh speaketh soft things and easy to the body;  the spirit of the world vain things and covetise[283] of worship;  and the spirit of malice of the fiend speaketh fell things and  bitter.    Wherefore, as oft times as any thought smiteth on our hearts of  meat, of drink, and of sleep, of soft clothing, of lechery, and of  all other such things the which longeth to the business of the  flesh, and maketh our heart for to brenne[284] as it were in a  longing desire after all such things; be we full siker that it is  the spirit of the flesh that speaketh it. And therefore put we him  away, in as much as we goodly may by grace, for he is our adversary.  As oft times as any thought smiteth on our hearts of vain joy of  this world, kindling in us a desire to be holden fair, and to be  favoured, to be holden of great kin and of great conning, to be  holden wise and worthy, or else to have great degree and high office  in this life--such thoughts and all other the which would make a man  to seem high and worshipful, not only in the sight of others, but  also in the sight of himself--no doubt but it is the spirit of the  world that speaketh all these, a far more perilous enemy than is the  spirit of the flesh, and with much more business he should be put  off. And oft times it befalleth that these two servants and  sergeants of the foul fiend, the spirit and prince of wrath[285] and  of wickedness, are either by grace and by ghostly slight of a soul  stiffly put down and trodden down under foot; or else, by  quaintise[286] of their malicious master, the foul fiend of hell,  they are quaintly withdrawn, for he thinketh himself for to rise  with great malice and wrath, as a lion running felly to assail the  sickness of our sely souls; and this befalleth as oft as the thought  of our heart stirreth us, not to the lust of our flesh, nor yet to  the vain joy of this world, but it stirreth us to murmuring, to  grutching,[287] to grievance, and to bitterness of soul, to pain and  to impatience, to wrath, to melancholy, and to evil will, to hate,  to envy, and to all such sorrows. It maketh us to bear us heavily,  if ought be done or said unto us, not so lovely, nor so wisely[288]  as we would it were; it raiseth in us all evil suspicion, if ought  be shewed in sign, in countenance, in word, or in work, that might  by any manner be turned to malice or to heaviness of heart; it  maketh us as fast[289] to take it to us.    To these thoughts, and to all such that would put us out of peace  and restfulness of heart, we should none otherwise againstand,[290]  but as we would the self fiend of hell, and as much we should flee  therefrom as from the loss of our soul. No doubt but both the other  two thoughts, of the spirit of the flesh and also of the spirit of  the world, work and travail in all that they can to the loss of our  soul, but most perilously the spirit of malice; for why, he is by  himself, but they not without him. For if a man's soul be never so  clean of fleshly lust, and of vain joy of this world, and if it be  defouled with this spirit of malice, of wrath, and of wickedness,  not againstanding all the other cleanness before, yet it is losable.  And if a soul be never so much defouled with the lust of the flesh,  and vain joy of the world, and it may by grace keep it in peace and  in restfulness of heart unto the even Christian,[291] though all it  be full hard for to do (lasting the custom of the other two),[292]  yet it is less losable, not againstanding all the other filth of the  flesh and of the world touched before. And, therefore, though all"]]]
