Three  skins, those of a male and two females, have patches of white hairs at  the tips of the tails; two skins, of a male and a female, show only  scattered white hairs at the tips of the tails; and the skin of one  female has a solidly black-tipped tail. An additional female, trapped  by David Leighton in Thompson Canyon, had a large patch of white hairs  at the tip of the tail. Grinnell, Dixon, and Linsdale (1937:501) mention  that only an occasional individual (female?) has a white-tipped tail.    Weights are available for four specimens: two coyotes trapped in San  Antonio Wash, a male and a female, weighed 20.5 and 23.2 pounds  respectively; a female from the mouth of San Antonio Canyon weighed 21.6  pounds; and a large male from the mouth of Thompson Canyon weighed 29.3  pounds.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 6, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: Live Oak Canyon, 3000 ft., 1; mouth of San      Antonio Canyon, 2000 ft., 1; 4 mi.

They seem not, or only rarely, to penetrate the  yellow pine forest belt, but tracks have been found occasionally near  the lower edge of the forest, as at the head of Mescal Canyon. In the  more open parts of the pinyon-juniper association, sign of coyotes was  noted and they were the dominant carnivores in the juniper belt and  Joshua tree woodland.    In the upper part of the pinyon-juniper association coyotes travel and  forage in sage flats, along ridges, and in sandy draws, avoiding the  extensive patches of scrub oak and mountain mahogany, and the steep,  rocky, pinyon-covered slopes. It is apparent that the local ranges of  the coyote and the gray fox in the pinyon-juniper belt are  complementary, the gray fox keeping to the more thickly wooded or brushy  parts of the area, and the coyote staying in the relatively open  sections. Probably there is little competition for food there between  these two canids.    As evidenced by tracks, coyotes commonly traveled and hunted along  desert washes, probably because of the larger population of rodents and  rabbits there. Below Graham Canyon three fairly recently inhabited dens  of coyotes were found in the cutbanks at the edge of a dry wash in  December of 1951. The cutbanks were six to ten feet high, and the dens  were dug into the banks about three feet above the floor of the wash.    On the evening of October 20, 1948, near Desert Springs, Steven M.  Jacobs and I set out a line of fifty wooden live traps for kangaroo  rats. That night we slept about 300 yards from the middle of the line  which was roughly three quarters of a mile long. When we tended the  traps the next morning we found the tracks of a coyote over our own  tracks of the previous day, and the first trap that had seemingly held a  kangaroo rat was chewed and dragged for about fifty feet. Each trap that  had held a rodent had been turned upside down so that the door had  opened. At one point in the line where we had walked for about two  hundred yards without setting a trap the coyote had followed every twist  and turn of our trail. The animal had followed out the entire trap line  and removed approximately eight rodents from the traps, reducing our  take to one _Dipodomys_ and one _Peromyscus_.    Examinations of feces showed that in the period from 1948 to 1952, while  populations of jack rabbits were low in the Mojave Desert, the coyotes  had fed extensively on smaller mammals such as kangaroo rats, and to  some extent on fruit. By contrasting the present food habits of coyotes  on the desert and coastal slopes of the mountains support is afforded  for Errington's (1937:243) statement that predation is \"a by-product of  population.\" On the desert slope, with low populations of rabbits, the  coyotes have turned to lesser species of prey; while on the Pacific  slope, where populations of rabbits were high, the rabbits made up the  major portion of the coyote's diet. On the desert slope, remains of the  following food items were identified from coyote feces: kangaroo rats,  mule deer, jack rabbits, passerine bird, manzanita and juniper fruit,  beetles, grapes and apples. Near Valyermo, coyote feces were composed  mostly of apples from nearby orchards. A female coyote killed below  Grandview Canyon had its stomach and intestines stuffed with apples in  large chunks. In the juniper belt, berries of juniper were often eaten  by coyotes.    The three specimens of coyotes from the desert slope are clearly  referable to the desert race _C. l. mearnsi_, both with regard to  cranial and pelage characteristics. Although I collected no specimens  from Cajon Pass or the passes at the west end of the range, it is in  these places that intergradation might be expected to occur between the  desert race _C. l. mearnsi_ and the coastal and valley subspecies _C. l.  ochropus_, as the higher parts of the San Gabriels seem to constitute a  barrier to coyotes.    A subadult female coyote taken in the Joshua tree belt near Graham  Canyon weighed 20.8 pounds.        _Specimens examined._--Los Angeles County: 6 mi. E and 2 mi. S      Llano, 3600 ft., 3 (2 PC).      =Vulpes macrotis arsipus= Elliot    Kit Fox    The kit fox barely enters the area under consideration. In the Joshua  tree belt, below about 3500 feet elevation, tracks were most often noted  in washes and on the adjacent sandy ground. The highest place where  tracks were seen was a small sandy draw below the mouth of Graham Canyon  at an altitude of roughly 3900 feet.    In the Joshua tree belt many old burrows were found but none was  occupied. I believe these foxes are returning to this area where once  they were common. In the winter of 1948 no sign of kit foxes was found,  although intensive field work was done in the Joshua tree belt in the  Mescal Canyon area. In December of 1951, in the same locality, sign was  obvious and an individual was trapped below Grandview Canyon at 3500  feet elevation. Possibly since the use of poison for carnivores has been  discontinued in this district the foxes are repopulating the area.    The one specimen taken, a sub-adult female, weighed two pounds and  fourteen ounces.        _Specimen examined._--Los Angeles Co.: 6 mi.

Their sight is so  penetrating that I think they could see through the earth. They have a  silvery voice, quick and sweet. The music they play is most beautiful.  They _take_ the whole body and soul of young and intellectual people who  are interesting, transmuting the body to a body like their own. I asked  them once if they ever died, and they said, \"No; we are always kept  young.\" Once they take you and you taste food in their palace you cannot  come back. You are changed to one of them, and live with them for ever.  They are able to appear in different forms. One once appeared to me, and  seemed only four feet high, and stoutly built. He said, \"I am bigger  than I appear to you now. We can make the old young, the big small, the  small big.\" One of their women told all the secrets of my family. She  said that my brother in Australia would travel much and suffer  hardships, all of which came true; and foretold that my nephew, then  about two years old, would become a great clergyman in America, and that  is what he is now. Besides the _gentry_, who are a distinct class, there  are bad spirits and ghosts, which are nothing like them. My mother once  saw a leprechaun beside a bush hammering. He disappeared before she  could get to him, but he also was unlike one of the _gentry_.'[16]      EVIDENCE FROM GRANGE    Our next witness, who lives about three miles from our last witness, is  Hugh Currid, the oldest man in Grange; and so old is he that now he does  little more than sit in the chimney-corner smoking, and, as he looks at  the red glow of the peat, dreaming of the olden times. Hugh knows  English very imperfectly, and so what he narrated was in the ancient  Gaelic which his fathers spoke. When Father Hines took me to Hugh's  cottage, Hugh was in his usual silent pose before the fire. At first he  rather resented having his thoughts disturbed, but in a few minutes he  was as talkative as could be, for there is nothing like the mention of  Ireland to get him started. The Father left us then; and with the help  of Hugh's sister as an interpreter I took down what he said:--    _The Flax-Seller's Return from Faerie._--'An old woman near Lough More,  where Father Patrick was drowned,[17] who used to make her living by  selling flax at the market, was _taken_ by the _gentry_, and often came  back afterwards to her three children to comb their hair. One time she  told a neighbour that the money she saved from her dealings in flax  would be found near a big rock on the lake-shore, which she indicated,  and that she wanted the three children to have it.'    _A Wife Recovered from the 'Gentry'._--'A man's young wife died in  confinement while he was absent on some business at Ballingshaun, and  one of the _gentry_ came to him and said she had been _taken._ The  husband hurried home, and that night he sat with the body of his wife  all alone. He left the door open a little, and it wasn't long before his  wife's spirit came in and went to the cradle where her child was  sleeping. As she did so, the husband threw at her a charm of hen's dung  which he had ready, and this held her until he could call the  neighbours. And while they were coming, she went back into her body, and  lived a long time afterwards. The body was stiff and cold when the  husband arrived home, though it hadn't been washed or dressed.'      A TAILOR'S TESTIMONY    Our next witness is Patrick Waters, by trade a tailor, living in  Cloontipruckilish, a cross-road hamlet less than two miles from Hugh  Currid's home. His first story is a parallel to one told about the  minister of Aberfoyle who was _taken_ by the 'good people' (pp. 89  ff.):--    _The Lost Bride._--'A girl in this region died on her wedding-night  while dancing. Soon after her death she appeared to her husband, and  said to him, \"I'm not dead at all, but I am put from you now for a time.  It may be a long time, or a short time, I cannot tell. I am not badly  off. If you want to get me back you must stand at the gap near the house  and catch me as I go by, for I live near there, and see you, and you do  not see me.\" He was anxious enough to get her back, and didn't waste any  time in getting to the gap. When he came to the place, a party of  strangers were just coming out, and his wife soon appeared as plain as  could be, but he couldn't stir a hand or foot to save her. Then there  was a scream and she was gone. The man firmly believed this, and would  not marry again.'    _The Invisible Island._--'There is an enchanted island which is an  invisible island between Innishmurray and the mainland opposite. It is  only seen once in seven years. I saw it myself, and so did four or five  others with me. A boatman from Sligo named Carr took two strange men  with him towards Innishmurray, and they disappeared at the spot where  the island is, and he thought they had fallen overboard and been  drowned. Carr saw one of the same men in Connelly (County Donegal), some  six months or so after, and with great surprise said to him, \"Will you  tell me the wonders of the world? Is it you I saw drowned near  Innishmurray?\" \"Yes,\" he said; and then asked, \"Do you see me?\" \"Yes,\"  answered Carr. \"But,\" said the man again, \"you do not see me with both  eyes?\" Then Carr closed one eye to be sure, and found that he saw him  with one eye only. And he told the man which one it was. At this  information the fairy man blew on Carr's face, and Carr never saw him  again.'    _A Dream._--'My father dreamt he saw two armies coming in from the sea,  walking on the water. Reaching the strand, they lined up and commenced a  battle, and my father was in great terror. The fighting was long and  bloody, and when it was over every fighter vanished, the wounded and  dead as well as the survivors. The next morning an old woman who had the  reputation of talking with the fairies came in the house to my father,  who, though greatly disturbed over the dream, had told us nothing of it,  and asked him, \"Have you anything to tell? I couldn't but laugh at you,\"  she added, and before my father could reply, continued, \"Well, Jimmy,  you won't tell the news, so I will.\" And then she began to tell about  the battle. \"Ketty!\" exclaimed my father at this, \"can it be true? And  who were the men beside me?\" When Ketty told him, they turned out to be  some of his dead friends. She received her information from a drowned  man whom she met on the spot where the _gentry_ armies had come ashore;  and, in the place where they fought, the sand was all burnt red, as from  fire.'    As the narrator reflected on this dream story, he remarked about dreams  generally:--'The reason our dreams appear different from what they are  is because while in them we can't touch the body and transform it.  People believe themselves to be with the dead in dreams.'    During September 1909, when I had several fresh interviews with Patrick  Waters, I verified all of his 1908 testimony such as it appears above;  and among unimportant anecdotes I have omitted from the matter taken  down in 1908 one anecdote about our seer-witness from County Sligo,  because it proved to be capable of opposite interpretations. Patrick  Waters, however, like many of his neighbours, thoroughly supports Hugh  Currid's opinion that our seer-witness 'surely sees something, and it  must be the _gentry_'; and of Hugh Currid himself, Patrick Waters said,  'Hugh Currid did surely see the _gentry_; he saw them passing this way  like a blast of wind.' Patrick's fresh testimony now follows, the story  about Father Patrick and Father Dominick coming first:--    _Father Patrick and Father Dominick._--'Father Patrick Noan while  bathing in the harbour at Carns (about three miles north-west of Grange)  was drowned. His body was soon brought ashore, and his brother, Father  Dominick Noan, was sent for. When Father Dominick arrived, one of the  men who had collected around the body said to him, \"Why don't you do  something for your brother Patrick?\" \"Why don't somebody ask me?\" he  replied, \"for I must be asked in the name of God.\" So Jimmy McGowan went  on his knees and asked for the honour of God that Father Dominick should  bring Father Patrick back to life; and, at this, Father Dominick took  out his breviary and began to read. After a time he whistled, and began  to read again. He whistled a second time, and returned to the reading.  Upon his whistling the third time, Father Patrick's spirit appeared in  the doorway.    '\"Where were you when I whistled the first time?\" Father Dominick asked.  \"I was at a hurling match with the _gentry_ on Mulloughmore strand.\"  \"And where were you at the second whistle?\" \"I was coming over Corrick  Fadda; and when you whistled the third time I was here at the door.\"  Father Patrick's spirit had gone back into the body, and Father Patrick  lived round here as a priest for a long time afterwards.    'There was no such thing as artificial respiration known hereabouts when  this happened some fifty or sixty years ago. I heard this story, which I  know is true, from many persons who saw Father Dominick restore his  brother to life.'    _A Druid Enchantment._--After this strange psychical narrative, there  followed the most weird legend I have heard in Celtic lands about Druids  and magic. One afternoon Patrick Waters pointed out to me the field,  near the sea-coast opposite Innishmurray, in which the ancient menhir  containing the 'enchantment' used to stand; and, at another time, he  said that a bronze wand covered with curious marks (or else interlaced  designs) was found not far from the ruined dolmen and _allee couverte_  on the farm of Patrick Bruan, about two miles southward. This last  statement, like the story itself, I have been unable to verify in any  way.    'In times before Christ there were Druids here who enchanted one another  with Druid rods made of brass, "]]]
