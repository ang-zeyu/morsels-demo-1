It was early evening and quite dark, for the moon  had not risen and the eastern sky from the zenith down was obscured by  fitful patches of cloud, gray-winged messengers of rain. In the west,  Venus glowed with a warm, seductive light, like a lamp in a Spanish  garden. A brisk and vigorous breeze roughed the waters of the bay that  raced shoreward in long rollers to escape its impetuous wooing.    Peter Gross breathed the salt air deeply and stared steadfastly into the  west, for he was sick at heart. Not until now did he realize what giving  up the sea meant to him. The sea!--it had been a second mother to him,  receiving him into its open arms when he ran away from the drudgery of  the farm to satisfy the wanderlust that ached and ached in his boyish  heart. Ay, it had mothered him, cradling him at night on its fond bosom  while it sang a wild and eerie refrain among sail and cordage, buffeting  him in its ill-humor, feeding him, and even clothing him. His first  yellow oilskin, he remembered poignantly, had been salvaged from a  wreck.    Now he was leaving that mother. He was leaving the life he had lived for  ten years. He was denying the dreams and ambitions of his youth. He was  casting aside the dream of some day standing on the deck of his own ship  with a score of smart sailors to jump at his command. A feeling akin to  the home-sickness he had suffered when, a lad of fifteen, he lived  through his first storm at sea, in the hold of a cattle-ship, came over  him now. Almost he regretted his decision.    Since bidding good-bye to Captain Threthaway two weeks before, he had  picked twenty-four of the twenty-five men he intended to take with him  for the pacification of Bulungan. The twenty-fifth he expected to sign  that night at the home of his quondam skipper, Captain Roderick Rouse,  better known as Roaring Rory. Rouse had been a trader in the south seas  for many years and was now skipper of a smart little cottage in Ryswyk,  the European residence section of Batavia. Peter Gross's presence at the  water-front was explained by the fact that he had an hour to spare and  naturally drifted to Tanjong Priok, the shipping center.    The selection of the company had not been an easy task. Peter Gross had  not expected that it would be. He found the type of men he wanted even  scarcer than he anticipated. For the past two weeks beachcombers and  loafers along the wharves, and tourists, traders, and gentlemen  adventurers at the hotels had looked curiously at the big, well-dressed  sailor who always seemed to have plenty of time and money to spend, and  was always ready to gossip. Some of them tried to draw him out. To these  he talked vaguely about seeing a little of Java before he went sailoring  again. Opinion became general that for a sailor Peter Gross was  remarkably close-mouthed.    While he was to all appearances idly dawdling about, Peter Gross was in  reality getting information concerning hardy young men of adventuresome  spirit who might be persuaded to undertake an expedition that meant risk  of life and who could be relied upon. Each man was carefully sounded  before he was signed, and when signed, was told to keep his mouth shut.    But the major problem, to find a capable leader of such a body of men,  was still unsolved. Peter Gross realized that his duties as resident  precluded him from taking personal charge. He also recognized his  limitations. He was a sailor; a soldier was needed to whip the company  in shape, a bush-fighter who knew how to dispose those under him when  Dyak arrows and Chinese bullets began to fly overhead in the jungle.    Two weeks of diligent search had failed to unearth any one with the  necessary qualifications. Peter Gross was beginning to despair when he  thought of his former skipper, Captain Rouse. Looking him up, he  explained his predicament.    \"By the great Polar B'ar,\" Roaring Rory bellowed when Peter Gross had  finished his recital. \"How the dickens do you expect to clean out that  hell-hole with twenty-five men? Man, there's a hundred thousand Dyaks  alone, let alone those rat-faced Chinks that come snoopin' down like  buzzards smellin' carrion, and the cut-throat Bugis, and the bad men the  English chased out of Sarawak, and the Sulu pirates, and Lord knows what  all. It's suicide.\"    \"I'm not going to Bulungan to make war,\" Peter Gross explained mildly.    Roaring Rory spat a huge cud of tobacco into a cuspidor six feet away,  the better to express his astonishment.    \"Then what in blazes are you goin' there for?\" he roared.    Peter Gross permitted himself one of his rare smiles. There was a  positive twinkle in his eyes as he replied:    \"To convince them I am their best friend.\"    Roaring Rory's eyes opened wide.    \"Convince 'em--what?\" he gasped.    \"That I am their friend.\"    The old sea captain stared at his ex-mate.    \"You're jokin',\" he declared.    \"I was never more serious in my life,\" Peter Gross assured gravely.    \"Then you're a damn' fool,\" Roaring Rory asserted. \"Yes, sir, a damn'  fool. I didn't think it of ye, Peter.\"    \"It will take time, but I believe I see my way,\" Peter Gross replied  quietly. He explained his plan briefly, and as he described how he  expected to win the confidence and support of the hillmen, Roaring Rory  became calmer.    \"Mebbe you can do it, Peter, mebbe you can do it,\" he conceded  dubiously. \"But that devil of an Ah Sing has a long arm, and by the bye,  I'd keep indoors after sundown if I were you.\"    \"But this isn't getting me the man I need,\" Peter Gross pointed out.  \"Can you recommend any one, captain?\"    Roaring Rory squared back in his chair.    \"I hain't got the latitude and longitude of this-here proposition of  yours figured just yet,\" he replied, producing a plug of tobacco and  biting off a generous portion before passing it hospitably to his  visitor. \"Just what kind of a man do you want?\"    Peter Gross drew his chair a few inches nearer the captain's.    \"What I want,\" he said, \"is a man that I can trust--no matter what  happens. He doesn't need to know seamanship, but he's got to be  absolutely square, a man the sight of gold or women won't turn. He has  to be a soldier, an ex-army officer, and a bush-fighter, a man who has  seen service in the jungle. A man from the Philippines would just fill  the bill. He has to be the sort of a man his men will swear by. And he  has to have a clean record.\"    Roaring Rory grunted. \"Ye don't want nothin', do ye? I'd recommend the  Angel Gabriel.\"    \"There is such a man,\" Peter Gross insisted. \"There always is. You've  got to help me find him, captain.\"    Rouse scratched his head profoundly and squinted hard. By and bye a big  grin overspread his features.    \"I've got a nevvy,\" he announced, \"who'd be crazy to be with ye. He's  only seventeen, but big for his age. He's out on my plantation now. Hold  on,\" he roared as Peter Gross attempted to interrupt. \"I'm comin' to  number twenty-five. This nevvy has a particular friend that's with him  now out to the plantation. 'Cordin' to his log, this chap's the very man  ye're lookin' for. Was a captain o' volunteer infantry and saw service  in the Philippines. When his time run out he went to Shanghai for a  rubber-goods house, and learned all there is to know about Chinks. He's  the best rifle shot in Java. An' he can handle men. He ain't much on the  brag order, but he sure is all there.\"    \"That is the sort of a man I have been looking for,\" Peter Gross  observed with satisfaction.    \"He's worth lookin' up at any rate,\" Captain Rouse declared. \"If you  care to see him and my nevvy, you're in luck. They're comin' back  to-night. They had a little business here, so they run down together and  will bunk with me. I expect them here at nine o'clock, and if ye're on  deck I'll interduce you. What d'ye say?\"    \"I knew you wouldn't fail me, captain,\" Peter Gross replied warmly.  \"I'll be here.\"    The shrill whistle of a coaster interrupted Peter Gross's melancholy  reflections. He recollected with a start that it must be near the time  he had promised to be at Captain Rouse's cottage. Leaving the wharves,  he ambled along the main traveled highway toward the business district  until overtaken by a belated victoria whose driver he hailed.    The cool of evening was descending from the hills as the vehicle turned  into the street on which Captain Rouse lived. It was a wide, tree-lined  lane, with oil lamps every six or seven hundred feet whose yellow rays  struggled ineffectually to banish the somber gloom shed by the huge  masses of foliage that shut out the heavens. Feeling cramped from his  long ride and a trifle chill, Peter Gross suddenly decided to walk the  remainder of the distance, halted his driver, paid the fare, and  dismissed him. Whistling cheerily, a rollicking chanty of the sea to  which his feet kept time, he walked briskly along.    Cutting a bar of song in the middle, he stopped suddenly to listen.  Somewhere in the darkness behind him someone had stumbled into an acacia  hedge and had uttered a stifled exclamation of pain. There was no other  sound, except the soughing of the breeze through the tree-tops.    \"A drunken coolie,\" he observed to himself. He stepped briskly along and  resumed his whistling. The song came to an abrupt close as his keen ears  caught a faint shuffling not far behind, a shuffling like the scraping  of a soft-soled shoe against the plank walk. He turned swiftly, ears  pricked, and looked steadily in the direction that the sound came from,  but the somber shadows defied his searching glance.    \"Only coolies,\" he murmured, but an uneasy feeling came upon him and he  quickened his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3725"],[0,"Famous Men of the Middle Ages (#15)"],[1,"the leper a  seat next to himself at the table. After supper the knight shared  his own bed with the leper. If the knight had not done this, the  leper would have been driven out of the town, with nothing to eat  and no place in which to sleep. At midnight, while the young man  was fast asleep, the leper breathed upon his back. This awakened  the knight, who turned quickly in his bed and found that the leper  was gone.    The knight called for a light and searched, but in vain. While he  was wondering about what had happened, a man in shining garments  appeared before him and said, \"Rodrigo, art thou asleep or awake?\"  The knight answered, \"I am awake, but who art thou that bringest  such brightness?\" The vision replied, \"I am St. Lazarus, the leper  to whom thou wast so kind. Because I have breathed upon thee thou  shalt accomplish whatever thou shalt undertake in peace or in battle.  All shall honor thee. Therefore, go on and evermore do good.\"    With that the vision vanished.    The promise of St. Lazarus was fulfilled. In time young Rodrigo became  the great hero of Spain. The Spaniards called him Cam-pe-ae-dor', or  Champion. The Saracens called him \"The Cid,\" or Lord. His real  name was Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar, but he is usually spoken of as  \"The Cid.\"    The Goths, after the death of Alaric, had taken Spain away from  the Romans. The Saracens, or, as they were usually called, the  Moors, had crossed the sea from Africa and in turn had taken Spain  from the Goths. In the time of Charles Martel the Goths had lost  all Spain except the small mountain district in the northern part.  In the time of the Cid the Goths, now called Spaniards, had driven  the Moors down to about the middle of Spain. War went on all the time  between the two races, and many men spent their lives in fighting.  The Spanish part of the country then comprised the kingdoms of  Castile, Leon, Aragon and others.    [Illustration: THE GATE OF THE SUN AT TOLEDO]    The Cid was a subject of Fernando of Castile. Fernando had a dispute  with the king of Aragon about a city which each claimed. They agreed  to decide the matter by a combat. Each was to choose a champion.  The champions were to fight, and the king whose champion won was  to have the city. Fernando chose the Cid, and though the other  champion was called the bravest knight in Spain, the youthful warrior  vanquished him.    When Alfonzo, a son of Fernando, succeeded to the throne, he became  angry with the Cid without just cause and banished him from Christian  Spain.    The Cid was in need of some money, so he filled two chests with  sand and sent word to two wealthy money lenders that he wished  to borrow six hundred Spanish marks (about $2,000), and would put  into their hands his treasures of silver and gold which were packed  in two chests, but the money lenders must solemnly swear not to  open the chests until a full year had passed. To this they gladly  agreed. They took the chests and loaned him six hundred marks.    The Cid was now ready for his journey. Three hundred of his knights  went into banishment with him. They crossed the mountains and entered  the land of the Moors. Soon they reached the town of Alcocer, and  after a siege captured it and lived in it.    Then the Moorish king of Valencia ordered two chiefs to take three  thousand horsemen, recapture the town and bring the Cid alive to  him.    So the Cid and his men were shut up in Alcocer and besieged. Famine  threatened them and they determined to cut their way through the  army of the Moors. Suddenly and swiftly they poured from the gate  of Alcocer, and a terrible battle was fought. The two Moorish chiefs  were taken prisoners and thirteen hundred of their men were killed  in the battle. The Cid then became a vassal of the Moorish king  of Saragossa.    After a while Alfonzo recalled the Cid from banishment and gave  him seven castles and the lands adjoining them. He needed the Cid's  help in the greatest of all his plans against the Moors. He was  determined to capture Toledo. He attacked it with a large army  in which there were soldiers from many foreign lands. The Cid is  said to have been the commander. After a long siege the city fell  and the victorious army marched across the great bridge built by  the Moors, which you would cross to-day if you went to Toledo.    Valencia was one of the largest and richest cities in Moorish Spain.  It was strongly fortified, but the Cid determined to attack it.    The plain about the city was irrigated by streams that came down  from the neighboring hills. To prevent the Cid's army from coming  near the city the Saracens flooded the plain. But the Cid camped  on high ground above the plain and from that point besieged the  city. Food became very scarce in Valencia. Wheat, barley and cheese  were all so dear that none but the rich could buy them. People ate  horses, dogs, cats and mice, until in the whole city only three  horses and a mule were left alive.    Then on the fifteenth of June, 1094, the governor went to the camp  of the Cid and delivered to him the keys of the city. The Cid placed  his men in all the forts and took the citadel as his own dwelling.  His banner floated from the towers. He called himself the Prince  of Valencia.    [Illustration: BRIDGE AT TOLEDO]    When the king of Morocco heard of this he raised an army of fifty  thousand men. They crossed from Africa to Spain and laid siege to  Valencia. But the Cid with his men made a sudden sally and routed  them and pursued them for miles. It is said that fifteen thousand  soldiers were drowned in the river Gua-dal-qui-vir' which they  tried to cross.    The Cid was now at the height of his power and lived in great  magnificence. One of the first things he did was to repay the two  friends who had lent him the six hundred marks. He was kind and  just to the Saracens who had become his subjects. They were allowed  to have their mosques and to worship God as they thought right.    In time the Cid's health began to fail. He could lead his men forth  to battle no more. He sent an army against the Moors, but it was so  completely routed that few of his men came back to tell the tale.  It is said by a Moorish writer that \"when the runaways reached  him the Cid died of rage\" (1099).    There is a legend that shortly before he died he saw a vision of  St. Peter, who told him that he should gain a victory over the  Saracens after his death.    So the Cid gave orders that his body should be embalmed. It was  so well preserved that it seemed alive. It was clothed in a coat  of mail, and the sword that had won so many battles was placed in  the hand. Then it was mounted upon the Cid's favorite horse and  fastened into the saddle, and at midnight was borne out of the  gate of Valencia with a guard of a thousand knights.    All silently they marched to a spot where the Moorish king, with  thirty-six chieftains, lay encamped, and at daylight the knights  of the Cid made a sudden attack. The king awoke. It seemed to him  that there were coming against him full seventy thousand knights,  all dressed in robes as white as snow, and before them rode a knight,  taller than all the rest, holding in his left hand a snow-white  banner and in the other a sword which seemed of fire. So afraid  were the Moorish chief and his men that they fled to the sea, and  twenty thousand of them were drowned as they tried to reach their  ships.    There is a Latin inscription near the tomb of the Cid which may  be translated:      Brave and unconquered, famous in triumphs of war,    Enclosed in this tomb lies Roderick the Great of Bivar.          EDWARD THE CONFESSOR    KING FROM 1042-1066    I    The Danish kings who followed Canute were not like him. They were  cruel, unjust rulers and all the people of England hated them.  So when in the year 1042 the last of them died, Edward, the son  of the Saxon Ethelred, was elected king.    He is known in history as Edward the Confessor. He was a man of  holy life and after his death was made a saint by the Church, with  the title of \"the Confessor.\" Though born in England, he passed the  greater part of his life in Normandy as an exile from his native  land. He was thirty-eight years old when he returned from Normandy  to become king.    As he had lived so long in Normandy he always seemed more like a  Norman than one of English birth. He generally spoke the French  language and he chose Normans to fill many of the highest offices  in his kingdom.    For the first eight years of his reign there was perfect peace  in his kingdom, except in the counties of Kent and Essex, where  pirates from the North Sea made occasional attacks.    [Illustration: NORWEGIAN PIRATES ON THE COAST OF KENT]    These pirates were mostly Norwegians, whose leader was a barbarian  named Kerdric. They would come sweeping down upon the Kentish coast  in many ships, make a landing where there were no soldiers, and  fall upon the towns and plunder them. Then, as swiftly and suddenly  as they had come, they would sail away homeward, before they could  be captured.    One day Kerdic's fleet arrived off the coast, and as no opposing  force was visible, the pirates landed and started toward the nearest  town to plunder it.    By a quick march a body of English soldiers reached the town before  the pirates, and when the latter arrived they found a strong force  drawn up to give them battle. A short struggle took place. More  than half of the pirates were slain and the remainder were taken  prisoners.    After the prisoners had been secured the English ships that were  stationed on the coast attacked the pirate fleet and destroyed  it.    II    Edward took part in the events upon which Shakespeare, five hundred  years later, founded his famous tragedy of \"Macbeth.\"    There lived in Scotland during his reign an ambitious nobleman  named Macbeth, who invited Duncan, the King of Scotland, to his  castle and murdered him. He tried "]]]
