Even when they condemned our policy, they were unsparing in  their admiration for our energy, and the courage and ardour of our  workers. Said the correspondent of the London _Tribune_, a Liberal paper  hostile to our tactics: \"Their staying power, judging them by the  standards of men, is extraordinary. By taking afternoon as well as  evening meetings, they have worked twice as hard as the men. They are  up earlier, they retire just as late. Women against men, they are  better speakers, more logical, better informed, better phrased, with a  surer insight for the telling argument.\"    After a summer spent in strengthening our forces, organising new  branches, holding meetings--something like three thousand of these  between May and October--invading meetings of Cabinet Ministers--we  managed to do that about once every day--electioneering, and getting up  huge demonstrations in various cities, we arrived at the end of the  year. In the last months of the year, I directed several hotly contested  by-elections, at one of which I met with one of the most serious  misadventures of my life.    This by-election was held in the division of Mid-Devon, a stronghold of  Liberalism. In fact, since its creation in 1885, the seat has never been  held by any except a Liberal member. The constituency is a large one,  divided into eight districts. The population of the towns is a rough and  boisterous one, and its devotion, blind and unreasoning, to the Liberal  party has always reflected the rude spirit of the voters. A Unionist  woman told me, shortly after my arrival, that my life would be unsafe if  I dared openly to oppose the Liberal candidate. She had never dared, she  assured me, to wear her party colours in public. However, I did  speak--in our headquarters at Newton Abbott, the principal town of the  division, at Hull, and at Bovey Tracey. We held meetings twice a day,  calling upon the voters to \"beat the Government in Mid-Devon, as a  message that women must have votes next year.\" Although some of the  meetings were turbulent, we were treated with much more consideration  than either of the candidates, who, not infrequently, were howled down  and put to flight. Often the air of their meetings was thick with  decayed vegetables and dirty snowballs. We had some rather lively  sessions, too. Once, at an outdoor meeting, some young roughs dragged  our lorry round and round until it seemed that we must be upset, and  several times the language hurled at us from the crowd was quite unfit  for me to repeat. Still, we escaped actual violence until the day of the  election, when it was announced that the Unionist candidate had won the  seat by a majority of twelve hundred and eighty. We knew instantly that  the deepest resentment of the Liberals would be aroused, but it did not  occur to us that the resentment would be directed actively against us.    After the declaration at the polls, my companion, Mrs. Martel, and I  started to walk to our lodgings. Some of our friends stopped us, and  drew our attention to the newly elected Unionist member of Parliament,  who was being escorted from the polling place by a strong guard of  police. We were warned that our safety demanded an immediate flight from  the town. I laughingly assured our friends that I was never afraid to  trust myself in a crowd, and we walked on. Suddenly we were confronted  by a crowd of young men and boys, clay-cutters from the pits on the edge  of town. These young men, who wore the red rosettes of the Liberal  party, had just heard of their candidate's defeat, and they were mad  with rage and humiliation. One of them pointed to us, crying: \"They did  it! Those women did it!\" A yell went up from the crowd, and we were  deluged with a shower of clay and rotten eggs. We were not especially  frightened, but the eggs were unbearable, and to escape them we rushed  into a little grocer's shop close at hand. The grocer's wife closed and  bolted the door, but the poor grocer cried out that his place would be  wrecked. I did not want that to happen, of course, so I asked them to  let us out by the back door. They led us out the door, into a small back  yard which led into a little lane, whence we expected to make our  escape. But when we reached the yard we found that the rowdies,  anticipating our move, had surged round the corner, and were waiting for  us.    They seized Mrs. Martel first, and began beating her over the head with  their fists, but the brave wife of the shopkeeper, hearing the shouts  and the oaths of the men, flung open the door and rushed to our rescue.  Between us we managed to tear Mrs. Martel from her captors and get her  into the house. I expected to get into the house, too, but as I reached  the threshold a staggering blow fell on the back of my head, rough hands  grasped the collar of my coat, and I was flung violently to the ground.  Stunned, I must have lost consciousness for a moment, for my next  sensation was of cold, wet mud seeping through my clothing. Sight  returning to me, I perceived the men, silent now, but with a dreadful,  lowering silence, closing in a ring around me. In the centre of the ring  was an empty barrel, and the horrid thought occurred to me that they  might intend putting me in it. A long time seemed to pass, while the  ring of men slowly drew closer. I looked at them, in their drab clothes  smeared with yellow pit-clay, and they appeared so underfed, so puny and  sodden, that a poignant pity for them swept over me. \"Poor souls,\" I  thought, and then I said suddenly, \"Are none of you _men_?\" Then one of  the youths darted toward me, and I knew that whatever was going to  happen to me was about to begin.    At that very moment came shouts, and a rush of police who had fought  their way through hostile crowds to rescue us. Of course the mob turned  tail and fled, and I was carried gently into the shop, which the police  guarded for two hours, before it was deemed safe for us to leave in a  closed motor-car. It was many months before either Mrs. Martel or I  recovered from our injuries.    The rowdies, foiled of their woman prey, went to the Conservative Club,  smashed all the windows in the house, and kept the members besieged  there through the night. The next morning the body of a man, frightfully  bruised about the head, was found in the mill-race. Throughout all this  disorder and probable crime, not a man was arrested. Contrast this, if  you like, with the treatment given our women in London.    The King opened Parliament in great state on January 29, 1908. Again his  speech omitted all mention of woman suffrage, and again the W. S. P. U.  issued a call for a Women's Parliament, for February 11th, 12th and  13th. Before it was convened we heard that an excellent place in the  ballot had been won by a friend of the movement, Mr. Stanger, who  promised to introduce a suffrage bill, February 28th was the day fixed  for the second reading, and we realised that strong pressure would have  to be brought to bear to prevent the bill being wrecked, as the  Dickinson bill had been the previous year. Therefore, on the first day  of the Women's Parliament, almost every woman present volunteered for  the deputation, which was to try to carry the resolution to the prime  minister. Led by two well-known portrait painters, the deputation left  Caxton Hall and proceeded in orderly ranks, four abreast, toward the  House of Commons. The crowds in the streets were enormous, thousands of  sympathisers coming out to help the women, thousands of police  determined that the women should not be helped, and thousands of curious  spectators. When the struggle was over, fifty women were locked up in  police-court cells.    The next morning, when the cases were tried, Mr. Muskett, who prosecuted  for the Crown, and who was perhaps a little tired of telling the  Suffragettes that these scenes in the streets must cease, and then  seeing them go on exactly as if he had not spoken, made a very severe  and terrifying address. He told the women that this time they would be  subject to the usual maximum of two months' imprisonment, with the  option of a fine of five pounds, but that, in case they ever offended  again, the law had worse terrors in store for them. It was proposed to  revive, for the benefit of the Suffragettes, an Act passed in the reign  of Charles II, which dealt with \"Tumultuous Petitions, either to the  Crown or Parliament.\" This Act provided that no person should dare to go  to the King or to Parliament \"with any petition, complaint,  remonstrance, declaration or other address\" accompanied with a number of  persons above twelve. A fine of one hundred pounds, or three months'  imprisonment, might be imposed under this law. The magistrate then  sentenced all but two of the women to be bound over for twelve months,  or to serve six weeks in the second division. Two other women, \"old  offenders,\" were given one month in the third division, or lowest class.  All the prisoners, except two who had very ill relatives at home, chose  the prison sentence.    The next day's session of the Women's Parliament was one of intense  excitement, as the women reviewed the events of the previous day, the  trials, and especially the threat to revive the obsolete Act of Charles  II, an act _which was passed to obstruct the progress of the Liberal  party, which came into existence under the Stuarts, and under the second  Charles was fighting for its life_. It was an amazing thing that the  political descendants of these men were proposing to revive the Act to  obstruct the advance of the women's cause, fighting for its life under  George V and his Liberal government. At least, it was evidence that the  Government were baffled in their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34901"],[0,"On Liberty (#15)"],[1,"I do not  scruple to say of it, that it is, in many important points, incomplete  and one-sided, and that unless ideas and feelings, not sanctioned by it,  had contributed to the formation of European life and character, human  affairs would have been in a worse condition than they now are.  Christian morality (so called) has all the characters of a reaction; it  is, in great part, a protest against Paganism. Its ideal is negative  rather than positive; passive rather than active; Innocence rather than  Nobleness; Abstinence from Evil, rather than energetic Pursuit of Good:  in its precepts (as has been well said) \"thou shalt not\" predominates  unduly over \"thou shalt.\" In its horror of sensuality, it made an idol  of asceticism, which has been gradually compromised away into one of  legality. It holds out the hope of heaven and the threat of hell, as the  appointed and appropriate motives to a virtuous life: in this falling  far below the best of the ancients, and doing what lies in it to give to  human morality an essentially selfish character, by disconnecting each  man's feelings of duty from the interests of his fellow-creatures,  except so far as a self-interested inducement is offered to him for  consulting them. It is essentially a doctrine of passive obedience; it  inculcates submission to all authorities found established; who indeed  are not to be actively obeyed when they command what religion forbids,  but who are not to be resisted, far less rebelled against, for any  amount of wrong to ourselves. And while, in the morality of the best  Pagan nations, duty to the State holds even a disproportionate place,  infringing on the just liberty of the individual; in purely Christian  ethics, that grand department of duty is scarcely noticed or  acknowledged. It is in the Koran, not the New Testament, that we read  the maxim--\"A ruler who appoints any man to an office, when there is in  his dominions another man better qualified for it, sins against God and  against the State.\" What little recognition the idea of obligation to  the public obtains in modern morality, is derived from Greek and Roman  sources, not from Christian; as, even in the morality of private life,  whatever exists of magnanimity, high-mindedness, personal dignity, even  the sense of honour, is derived from the purely human, not the religious  part of our education, and never could have grown out of a standard of  ethics in which the only worth, professedly recognised, is that of  obedience.    I am as far as any one from pretending that these defects are  necessarily inherent in the Christian ethics, in every manner in which  it can be conceived, or that the many requisites of a complete moral  doctrine which it does not contain, do not admit of being reconciled  with it. Far less would I insinuate this of the doctrines and precepts  of Christ himself. I believe that the sayings of Christ are all, that I  can see any evidence of their having been intended to be; that they are  irreconcilable with nothing which a comprehensive morality requires;  that everything which is excellent in ethics may be brought within them,  with no greater violence to their language than has been done to it by  all who have attempted to deduce from them any practical system of  conduct whatever. But it is quite consistent with this, to believe that  they contain, and were meant to contain, only a part of the truth; that  many essential elements of the highest morality are among the things  which are not provided for, nor intended to be provided for, in the  recorded deliverances of the Founder of Christianity, and which have  been entirely thrown aside in the system of ethics erected on the basis  of those deliverances by the Christian Church. And this being so, I  think it a great error to persist in attempting to find in the Christian  doctrine that complete rule for our guidance, which its author intended  it to sanction and enforce, but only partially to provide. I believe,  too, that this narrow theory is becoming a grave practical evil,  detracting greatly from the value of the moral training and instruction,  which so many well-meaning persons are now at length exerting themselves  to promote. I much fear that by attempting to form the mind and feelings  on an exclusively religious type, and discarding those secular  standards (as for want of a better name they may be called) which  heretofore co-existed with and supplemented the Christian ethics,  receiving some of its spirit, and infusing into it some of theirs, there  will result, and is even now resulting, a low, abject, servile type of  character, which, submit itself as it may to what it deems the Supreme  Will, is incapable of rising to or sympathising in the conception of  Supreme Goodness. I believe that other ethics than any which can be  evolved from exclusively Christian sources, must exist side by side with  Christian ethics to produce the moral regeneration of mankind; and that  the Christian system is no exception to the rule, that in an imperfect  state of the human mind, the interests of truth require a diversity of  opinions. It is not necessary that in ceasing to ignore the moral truths  not contained in Christianity, men should ignore any of those which it  does contain. Such prejudice, or oversight, when it occurs, is  altogether an evil; but it is one from which we cannot hope to be always  exempt, and must be regarded as the price paid for an inestimable good.  The exclusive pretension made by a part of the truth to be the whole,  must and ought to be protested against, and if a reactionary impulse  should make the protestors unjust in their turn, this one-sidedness,  like the other, may be lamented, but must be tolerated. If Christians  would teach infidels to be just to Christianity, they should themselves  be just to infidelity. It can do truth no service to blink the fact,  known to all who have the most ordinary acquaintance with literary  history, that a large portion of the noblest and most valuable moral  teaching has been the work, not only of men who did not know, but of men  who knew and rejected, the Christian faith.    I do not pretend that the most unlimited use of the freedom of  enunciating all possible opinions would put an end to the evils of  religious or philosophical sectarianism. Every truth which men of narrow  capacity are in earnest about, is sure to be asserted, inculcated, and  in many ways even acted on, as if no other truth existed in the world,  or at all events none that could limit or qualify the first. I  acknowledge that the tendency of all opinions to become sectarian is not  cured by the freest discussion, but is often heightened and exacerbated  thereby; the truth which ought to have been, but was not, seen, being  rejected all the more violently because proclaimed by persons regarded  as opponents. But it is not on the impassioned partisan, it is on the  calmer and more disinterested bystander, that this collision of  opinions works its salutary effect. Not the violent conflict between  parts of the truth, but the quiet suppression of half of it, is the  formidable evil: there is always hope when people are forced to listen  to both sides; it is when they attend only to one that errors harden  into prejudices, and truth itself ceases to have the effect of truth, by  being exaggerated into falsehood. And since there are few mental  attributes more rare than that judicial faculty which can sit in  intelligent judgment between two sides of a question, of which only one  is represented by an advocate before it, truth has no chance but in  proportion as every side of it, every opinion which embodies any  fraction of the truth, not only finds advocates, but is so advocated as  to be listened to.      We have now recognised the necessity to the mental well-being of mankind  (on which all their other well-being depends) of freedom of opinion, and  freedom of the expression of opinion, on four distinct grounds; which we  will now briefly recapitulate.    First, if any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for  aught we can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our own  infallibility.    Secondly, though the silenced opinion be an error, it may, and very  commonly does, contain a portion of truth; and since the general or  prevailing opinion on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth, it  is only by the collision of adverse opinions, that the remainder of the  truth has any chance of being supplied.    Thirdly, even if the received opinion be not only true, but the whole  truth; unless it is suffered to be, and actually is, vigorously and  earnestly contested, it will, by most of those who receive it, be held  in the manner of a prejudice, with little comprehension or feeling of  its rational grounds. And not only this, but, fourthly, the meaning of  the doctrine itself will be in danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and  deprived of its vital effect on the character and conduct: the dogma  becoming a mere formal profession, inefficacious for good, but cumbering  the ground, and preventing the growth of any real and heartfelt  conviction, from reason or personal experience.    Before quitting the subject of freedom of opinion, it is fit to take  some notice of those who say, that the free expression of all opinions  should be permitted, on condition that the manner be temperate, and do  not pass the bounds of fair discussion. Much might be said on the  impossibility of fixing where these supposed bounds are to be placed;  for if the test be offence to those whose opinion is attacked, I think  experience testifies that this offence is given whenever the attack is  telling and powerful, and that every opponent who pushes them hard, and  whom they find it difficult to answer, appears to them, if he shows any  strong feeling on the subject, an intemperate opponent. But this, though  an important consideration in a"]]]
