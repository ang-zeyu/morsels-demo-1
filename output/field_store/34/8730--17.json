He endured the unceremonious visitation for several nights, each night  thinking it was the last, that they would leave as unbidden as they  came, until the fact forced itself upon his mind that so long as he  would tamely submit to their aggressions, so long they would continue  to repeat them. Something must be done. He must claim the right of  master over his own premises.    Accordingly, after a day of fasting and before kneeling to pray, as  was his custom before retiring for the night, he read aloud a chapter  in the Bible, and then, in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, and by the  authority of the Holy Priesthood, rebuked those spirits, and commanded  them to leave the house--went to bed and had no more disturbance. But  those spirits were not discouraged with one defeat. It was not long  before several members of the Church became disaffected and came out in  open rebellion, insomuch that it was painfully necessary to expel quite  a number.    Manchester, April 6, 1841.--The council of the Twelve assembled in  Manchester Hall, on the 6th day of April, 1841, for the first time,  to transact business as a quorum, in the presence of the Church, in a  foreign land, being the first day of the twelfth year of the rise of  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.    Nine of the Quorum were present. At this Conference much was done in  appointing and setting apart to offices--ordaining, etc., as well  as representing the various branches and conferences. All being  accomplished, appropriate instructions were delivered by different  members of the High Council relative to the duties of the officers in  their respective callings, etc., etc.    A very richly ornamented cake from New York, from Elder Adams' wife  to the Twelve, was then exhibited to the meeting. This was blessed by  them, and then distributed to all the officers and members, and then to  the whole congregation, consisting, probably of seven hundred people. A  large fragment was still preserved for some who were not present.    During the distribution, several appropriate hymns were sung, and a  powerful and general feeling of delight seemed universally to pervade  the meeting. While this was proceeding, Elder P. P. Pratt composed and  handed over to the clerk the following lines, which the clerk then read  to the meeting, as follows:      When in far distant regions,    As strangers we roam,    Far away from our country,    Our friends and our home:    When sinking in sorrow,    Fresh courage we'll take,    As we think on our friends,    And remember the cake.    Elder O. Hyde appealed powerfully to the meeting, and covenanted with  the Saints present, in a bond of mutual prayer, during his mission to  Jerusalem and the East, which was sustained on the part of the hearers  with a hearty amen.    Elder Joseph Fielding remarked that it was with the most pleasing  and grateful feeling that he had witnessed the scenes of this day.  And respecting the rich cake of which they had been partaking, he  considered it a type of the good things of that land from whence it  came, and from whence they had received the fulness of the Gospel. He  expressed a hope that they might all hold out till that day, when they  should be assembled to partake of the marriage supper of the Lamb.    Elder B. Young and Elder William Miller sang the hymn, \"Adieu, my  dear brethren, adieu,\" etc. This was after the number of the official  members present had been taken--one hundred and seven.    President Brigham Young blessed the congregation and dismissed  them.--_Millennial Star_.    At this meeting, Brother Lorenzo reported the London Conference. No one  who has never been located far from home can realize the happiness he  enjoyed while associated with so many of the Quorum of the Twelve on  this occasion.      TO ELDER LORENZO SNOW, LONDON, ENGLAND.      Dearest brother, wherefore leave us?    Why forsake your friends and home?    Of your presence, why bereave us,    And in foreign countries roam?      Must the dearest ties be broken?    Must affection's garland fade?    No, O no! But God has spoken,    And His voice must be obeyed.      You have gone to warn the nations,    In the name of Israel's God;    You are called to bear salvation's    Joyful tidings far abroad.      Now the Gospel proclamation    Must be sounded far and near,    That the _best_ of every nation    May in Zion's courts appear.      In the spirit of devotion    To Messiah's glorious Cause,    You have crossed the pathless ocean,    To proclaim Redemption's laws.      You are now a standard bearer    On a distant mountain top,    And perchance ofttimes a sharer    In privation's bitter cup.      God designs to try and prove you,    If you will His voice obey;    Therefore from your friends who love you,    You are parted far away.      You are called yourself to sever    From the land where kindred dwell;    But it will not be forever--    Time will surely break the spell.      Here warm friends await your greeting--    Noble friends of Abra'm's line:    Here are gentle pulses beating    In soft unison with thine.      Here are daily prayers ascending    For th' appointed hour to come;    When your mission nobly ending,    We shall bid you \"_Welcome home_.\"      Nauvoo, Jan., 1841. E. R. Snow.

Extract of a letter written from London on the third of May, 1841:    _Elder Pratt_:    I improve a few moments in communicating some few items in reference to  the prosperity of our Redeemer's kingdom in this metropolis.    I feel happy in having the privilege of stating that the prospects of  Zion's extension and enlargement in this city are far more encouraging  now than at any former time since I located in London.    Though surrounded with high-handed wickedness of every description,  Zion begins to break forth, and, I trust, ere long will become a  shining lamp in this city.    Many people in various directions are inquiring the way of salvation,  and thanks to her glorious King, Zion is beginning to array herself in  her beautiful garments, even with light and intelligence, faith and  power, and her children are pointing out in plainness the one and only  pathway that leads up into the holy, celestial mansions of eternal rest.    On Sunday, our preaching room is crowded to overflowing. Yesterday  morning I had the pleasure of baptizing eleven into the fold of our  Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Others, also, will soon follow the  glorious example.    Lorenzo Snow.          A HINT TO THE WISE.        London, May 13, 1841.        The Savior has commanded not to cast pearls before swine. I am      sorry to say that this instruction is not always sufficiently      regarded by those to whom our Lord has given, through the      Everlasting Covenant, His pearls of wisdom, knowledge, and precious      gifts. The consequence is, we lose blessings instead of retaining      them--a decrease of the Holy Spirit follows, instead of an      increase, and our minds become darkened.        What I allude to is this: we too frequently engage in conversation      concerning things of the kingdom of God, with persons of a wrong      spirit; and feeling over anxious to make them see, understand, and      acknowledge the light presented, we urge on, and persist in the      conversation until we partake of the spirit of those with whom we      are conversing. We ought to be particularly guarded against falling      into errors of this kind.        It is very easy to understand when conversation is attended with      profit. We then feel our minds enlightened, and the power of God      resting upon us through the Holy Spirit--ideas flow into our minds,      and we express them with ease, freedom, and calmness.        Conversation conducted in this spirit proves highly profitable,      not only to ourselves, but also to those with whom we converse;      and after its close, our hearts are drawn out in gratitude to the      Most High for the privilege of imparting the glorious truths of the      Gospel to the children of men.        L. Snow.    The following is from the _Millennial Star_ of September, 1841:    Elder Snow writes from London, under date of August 21, as follows:  Dear Brother--This morning I occupy a few moments in communicating  a general view of the present state and prosperity of the London  Conference.    Six months since, when I took charge of this conference we numbered  less than one hundred members; since then we have increased to two  hundred and twenty.    I recently had the pleasure of spending three weeks in Bedford and  vicinity. My heart truly rejoiced to witness the good order, peace  and love prevailing there. The zeal and untiring perseverance of the  officers of the Church in Bedford, in leaving their homes on Sunday  morning, after having labored with their hands all the week, and then  walking eight and ten miles to proclaim the fulness of the Gospel, is  truly worthy of commendation and of imitation by all who labor in the  name, and by the authority of Jesus Christ. During the time I was in  Bedford, twenty-three persons were baptized into Zion's fold, in that  place and vicinity.    London, October 28, 1841.    _Elder Pratt_:    Dear Brother.--In a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47730"],[0,"Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 1 of 2) (#15)"],[1,"as it is claimed to be, how does it happen that  their sojourn in each of those states was characterized by continued  and increasing conflict with the established government and laws of  those states and of the United States, while the great Christian  denominations lived in peace and harmony under those same laws? The  Mormon Church will enjoy similar peace and harmony whenever its  priesthood ceases to interfere with civil affairs, and sets the example  of obeying the laws of the land as loyally as they have always been  obeyed by the great Christian denominations generally.    M.    Salt Lake City, Aug. 19, 1903.    II.    A Brief Defense of the Mormon People.    _To Editors of Lewiston, Maine, Journal:--_    An old Spanish proverb has it that \"A lie will travel a league, while  Truth is getting on his boots.\" Truth, however, has this advantage over  his nimble-footed opponent, viz., his boots once on he runs and is not  weary, he walks and faints not; and at the last he wins. The progress  of Truth, in other words, is irresistible and overwhelming, and his  triumph over falsehood is as inevitable as the decrees of fate.    In no instance in human experience are the above truths more clearly  demonstrated than in the history of Mormonism. From the beginning of  its existence falsehood in the form of misrepresentation and malicious  slander has been in the field against it. Early and late and viciously  the liars of this world have sought to overwhelm it as with a flood.  Meantime, however, Truth has not been idle. Steadily and gloriously  Mormonism and the people who have accepted it have lived down the  misrepresentations of their traducers, and today stand proudly erect,  unmoved by the efforts which falsehood has made to destroy them. This  failure of falsehood to destroy the object at which it has levelled its  heaviest ordnance is naturally aggravating to those who have employed  it; and very naturally they show that annoyance. As an instance of this  fact I refer to your Salt Lake correspondent \"M,\" whose communication  under the title \"Eastern Eulogy of Mormons' System,\" appeared in your  issue of September 6th. \"M\" is somewhat grieved, not to say indignant,  that the _Journal's_ representative, Mr. L. C. Bateman, should have  spoken a word of praise for the Mormons and for what they have achieved  by their faith, industry and frugality, and informs the _Journal_  that what he calls Mr. Bateman's eulogistic article called forth  an editorial in the Deseret News, the official organ of the Mormon  priesthood, expressing great satisfaction on the appearance of the  aforesaid article. But what's to be done? Men of intelligence come to  Utah; they are cosmopolitan, they understand human affairs and human  nature; and many of them--among them evidently your representative,  whose article is the cause of \"M's\" displeasure--are men accustomed  to collecting evidence, sifting it on the spot, and forming their own  conclusions. They find that the facts they see and investigate do not  warrant the misrepresentations they have heard concerning Mormonism and  the Mormons. They say that in their communications to the press, in  magazine articles, and sometimes in books. They are honest enough to  tell the truth as they find it; and refuse to look at facts--the things  which are--through the jaundiced eyes of a bigoted sectarian priest, or  through the eyes of a disappointed, and very likely disgruntled, scurvy  politician. Then they are abused by those to whose interests it is to  keep up a false impression concerning Mormonism and the Mormons, or  whose malice is gratified by misrepresenting them. Then it is charged  that they have been imposed upon by representations of \"the wily Mormon  leaders;\" or they have been \"wined and dined,\" and hoodwinked; or else  they have sold their talents to the Mormon \"priesthood for money.\"  Only let a man, whatever his intelligence or character, or national  standing, from President Eliot of Harvard to your representative--only  let him pursue his investigations of Mormonism and Mormons beyond  the lurid tales of hack drivers, bent on gratifying the morbid love  in human nature for the unusual and the horrible; or let him push  his inquiry beyond sectarian interpretation of the Mormon faith, and  sectarian misrepresentation of the Mormon people, and he is doomed to  be catalogued as a weak dupe, or a paid agent of the Mormon Church.    But however annoying it may be to Mormon traducers, the day is gone  by when their fulminations can be accepted as sober truth. Mormonism  is no longer isolated from the world. It is in daily contact with the  great stream of travel which crosses the continent, in which stream  is to be found some of the first and greatest characters of our own  country and of the world; not merely the seekers of pleasure, or the  restless curious; but educators, literati, public lecturers, editors,  scientists, and statesmen. Attracted by the wonderful things they have  heard of Utah and the Mormons, they stop to inquire, they meet with  unexpected conditions, with facts undreamed of, they investigate, are  convinced that the world has been misled in the impressions it has  formed concerning the Mormon faith and the Mormon people; and thus they  become witnesses against the traducers of that maligned people. Our  traducers may not like this, but it is true. They have made lies their  refuge, and under falsehood have they hid themselves; but their bed is  shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it, and the covering  narrower than that he can wrap himself in it. This much in general. Now  to be more specific; and especially to cover in the evidence I quote  the silly attempt of your Salt Lake correspondent \"M\" to deny credit  to the Mormons for having redeemed a desert and given a wilderness to  civilization.    Your correspondent refers to the credit accorded the Mormons for this  as \"an old chestnut\" which has been laid on the shelf years ago here in  the West, because there is no truth in it! \"There never was any barren  desert,\" he says, \"in this valley, for it has always been one of the  best watered, most easily cultivated and productive valleys west of the  Mississippi!\" It is rather an unfortunate circumstance that a man who  claims to have been a careful student of Mormonism and who has lived  for over twenty-five years in Utah, should include in his criticism  of the Journal's representative's article an untruth so palpable, a  falsehood so easy of refutation, a statement which so bluntly comes  in contact with the common knowledge of all the people of the United  States. How the Salt Lake Valley was regarded by the pioneers who came  into it in 1847 may be learned from the following quotation from their  utterances:        \"My mother was heart-broken because there were no trees to be seen.      I do not remember a tree that could be called a tree.\" Statement of      Clara Decker Young, one of the women of the first pioneer company.      (Bancroft's History of Utah, page 261.)        \"The ground was so dry that they found it necessary to irrigate it      before plowing, some plows having been broken.\" (_Ibid._)    Their first impressions of the valley, Lorenzo Young says, were most  disheartening. But for the two or three cottonwood trees, not a green  thing was in sight. And Brigham speaks almost pathetically of the  destruction of the willows and wild roses growing on the banks of City  Creek, destroyed because the channels must be changed, and leaving  nothing to vary the scenery but rugged mountains, the sage brush and  the sunflower. The ground was covered with millions of black crickets  which the Indians were harvesting for their winter food. (_Ibid, page  262._)        \"When we arrived in this valley we found it a barren desert, and      a barren desert it was. We saw no mark of the white man. We found      a few naked Indians who would eat a pint of roasted crickets for      their dinner.\" (Statement of Wilford Woodruff, \"Utah Pioneers,\"      page 24.)    The late Apostle Erastus Snow, who, with Orson Pratt, was the first  man of the pioneers to enter the valley, in a discourse during the  celebration of the thirty-third anniversary of the entrance of the  pioneers into the Salt Lake valley, says:        \"And when the Pioneers found it [this valley], it was well nigh      purified by the lapse of time and the desolation of ages, and the      wickedness of its ancient inhabitants was well nigh obliterated,      though the curse of barrenness and desolation still existed. I      remarked yesterday, on looking at the decorations of this building,      that to make the work complete that part which so truthfully      represents this desert land in 1847, the sagebrush and the other      growth of the desert should be sprinkled with black crickets,      and, perched in some prominent position, some gulls looking down      eagerly upon them; which would remind us of those early days when      the Pioneers and early settlers grappled with the difficulties of      the desert land; when the untamed savage was scarcely an enemy or      a hindrance in our pathway compared with the destructive winged      insects, the crickets and grasshoppers which would come in myriads      to devour the tender crops. For the first two seasons it seemed      as though the crickets and grasshoppers would consume every green      thing, and after they had commenced their depredations to such      an extent that to all human appearance the last vestige of the      products of the field and garden would be eaten up, large flocks      of gulls came to the relief of the farmer, lighting down upon the      fields and covering them as with a white sheet, and they fell      to devouring the insects. When they had filled and gorged their      stomachs, they would vomit them up and then fill themselves again,      and again vomit, and thus they ate and devoured until"]]]
