Instead of this, it was going like a  steam-engine, and if there had been the usual amount of thorny creepers  we should have been torn to pieces.    \" Keep him straight for the hill,\" I shouted, as I saw we were  approaching an inclination. \"Don't let him turn to right or left, keep  his head straight for the steep ground;\" and the mahout, who had been  yelling for assistance, and had lost both his turban and skull-cap, did  all that he could by tunnelling into the brute's head with his  formidable hook to direct it straight up the hill. I never knew an  elephant go at such a pace over rocky ground. Young trees were smashed  down, some branches torn, others bent forward, which swung backwards  with dangerous force, and yet on we tore without a sign of diminishing  speed. How I longed for an anchor to have brought up our runaway ship  head to wind! We had the coupling chains upon the pad, and my  interpreter, Modar Bux, at length succeeded in releasing these, and in  throwing them down for any person following to make use of. After a run  of quite half a mile, we fortunately arrived at a really steep portion  of the hill, where the rocks were sufficiently large to present a  difficulty to any runaway. The mahout who had been following our course,  breathless and with bleeding feet, here overtook us. Placing himself in  advance of the elephant, who seemed determined to continue its flight  among the rocks, he dug the spear deep into the animal's trunk, and kept  repeating the apparently cruel thrusts until at length it stopped.  Several men now arrived with the coupling chains, which were at length  with difficulty adjusted, and the elephant's fore legs were shackled  together. It was curious to observe the dexterous manner in which it  resisted this operation, and had it not been for the dread of the spear  I much doubt whether it could have been accomplished.    This was the first time that I had experienced a runaway elephant, but I  soon found that both my steeds were equally untrustworthy. A few weeks  after this event we had completed the morning's march and found the camp  already prepared for our arrival, at a place called Kassli, which is a  central depot for railway sleepers as they are received from the native  contractors. These were carefully piled in squares of about twenty each,  and covered a considerable area of ground at intervals. A large ox had  died that morning, and as it was within 50 yards of the tent it was  necessary to remove it; the vultures were already crowded in the  surrounding trees waiting for its decomposition. As usual, none of the  natives would defile themselves by touching the dead body. I accordingly  gave orders that one of the elephants should drag it about a mile down  wind away from the camp. Lord Mayo was brought to the spot, and the  sweeper, being of a low caste, attached a very thick rope to the hind  legs of the ox; the other end being made fast to the elephant's pad in  such a manner as to form traces. The elephant did not exhibit the  slightest interest in the proceeding, and everything was completed, the  body of the ox being about 6 or 7 yards behind.    No sooner did Lord Mayo move forward in obedience to the mahout's  command, and feel the tug of the weight attached, than he started off in  a panic at a tremendous pace, dragging the body through the lanes  between the piles of sleepers, upsetting them, and sending them flying  in all directions, as the dead ox caught against the corners; and,  helter-skelter, he made for the nearest jungle about 300 yards distant.  Fortunately some wood-cutters were there, who yelled and screamed to  turn him back; but although this had the effect of driving him from the  forest, he now started over the plain down hill, dragging the heavy ox  behind as though it had been a rabbit, and going at such a pace that  none of the natives could overtake him, although by this time at least  twenty men were in full pursuit.    The scene was intensely ridiculous, and the whole village turned out to  enjoy the fun of a runaway elephant with a dead ox bounding over the  inequalities of the ground; no doubt Lord Mayo imagined that he was  being hunted by the carcase which so persistently followed him wherever  he went. There was no danger to the driver, as the elephant was kept  away from the forest. The ground became exceedingly rough and full of  holes from the soakage during the rainy season. This peculiar soil is  much disliked by elephants, as the surface is most treacherous, and  cavernous hollows caused by subterranean water action render it unsafe  for the support of such heavy animals. The resistance of the dead ox,  which constantly jammed in the abrupt depressions, began to tell upon  the speed, and in a short time the elephant was headed, and surrounded  by a mob of villagers. I was determined that he should now be compelled  to drag the carcase quietly in order to accustom him to the burden; we  therefore attached the coupling chains to his fore legs, and drove him  gently, turning him occasionally to enable him to inspect the carcase  that had smitten him with panic. In about twenty minutes he became  callous, and regarded the dead body with indifference.    Although an elephant is capable of great speed, it cannot jump, neither  can it lift all four legs off the ground at the same time; this  peculiarity renders it impossible to cross any ditch with hard  perpendicular sides that will not crumble or yield to pressure, if such  a ditch should be wider than the limit of the animal's extreme pace. If  the limit of a pace should be 6 feet, a 7-foot ditch would effectually  stop an elephant.    Although the strength of an elephant is prodigious whenever it is fully  exerted, it is seldom that the animal can be induced to exhibit the  maximum force which it possesses. A rush of a herd of elephants, with a  determined will against the enclosure of palisades used for their  capture would probably break through the barrier, but they do not appear  to know their strength, or to act together. This want of cohesion is a  sufficient proof that in a wild state they are not so sagacious as they  have been considered. I do not describe the kraal or keddah, which is so  well known by frequent descriptions as the most ancient and practical  method of capturing wild elephants; but although in Ceylon the kraal has  been used from time immemorial, the Singhalese are certainly behind the  age as compared with the great keddah establishments of India. In the  latter country there is a ditch inside the palisaded enclosure, which  prevents the elephants from exerting their force against the structure;  in Ceylon this precaution is neglected, and the elephants have  frequently effected a breach in the palisade. In Ceylon all the old  elephants captured within the kraal or keddah are considered worthless,  and only those of scarcely full growth are valued; in India, all  elephants irrespective of their age are valued, and the older animals  are as easily domesticated as the young.    The keddah establishment at Dacca is the largest in India, and during  the last season, under the superintendence of Mr. G. P. Sanderson, 404  elephants were captured in the Garo Hills, 132 being taken in one drive.  It is difficult to believe that any district can continue to produce  upon this wholesale scale, and it is probable that after a few years  elephants will become scarce in the locality. Nevertheless there is a  vast tract of forest extending into Burmah, and the migratory habits of  the elephant at certain seasons may continue the supply, especially if  certain fruits or foliage attract them to the locality.    This migratory instinct is beyond our powers of explanation in the case  of either birds, beasts, or fishes. How they communicate, in order to  organise the general departure, must remain a mystery. It is well known  that in England, previous to the departure of the swallows, they may be  seen sitting in great numbers upon the telegraph wires as though  discussing the projected journey; in a few days after, there is not a  swallow to be seen.    I once, and only once, had an opportunity of seeing elephants that were  either migrating, or had just arrived from a migration. This was between  3 degrees and 4 degrees N. latitude in Africa, between Obbo and Farajok.  We were marching through an uninhabited country for about 30 miles, and  in the midst of beautiful park-like scenery we came upon the magnificent  sight of vast herds of elephants. These were scattered about the country  in parties varying in numbers from ten to a hundred, while single bulls  dotted the landscape with their majestic forms in all directions. In  some places there were herds of twenty or thirty entirely composed of  large tuskers; in other spots were parties of females with young ones  interspersed, of varying growths, and this grand display of elephantine  life continued for at least 2 miles in length as we rode parallel with  the groups at about a quarter of a mile distant. It would have been  impossible to guess the number, as there was no regularity in their  arrangement, neither could I form any idea of the breadth of the area  that was occupied. I have often looked back upon that extraordinary  scene, and it occurred to me forcibly in after years, when I had 3200  elephants' tusks in one station of Central Africa, which must have  represented 1600 animals slain for their fatal ivory.    The day must arrive when ivory will be a production of the past, as it  is impossible that the enormous demand can be supplied. I have already  explained that the African savage never tames a wild animal, neither  does he exhibit any sympathy or pity, his desire being, like the gunner  of the nineteenth century, to exterminate. It may be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3668"],[0,"The Albert N'Yanza, Great Basin of the Nile, And Explorations of the Nile (#15)"],[1,"flat; it abounds with elephants a  few miles inland. Herr Morlang describes the whole of the White Nile  traders as a mere colony of robbers, who pillage and shoot the natives  at discretion. On the opposite side of the river there is a large  neglected garden, belonging to the mission. Although the soil is  extremely rich, neither grapes nor pomegranate will succeed; they bear  fruit, but of a very acrid flavour. Dates blossom, but will not fruit.    Jan. 25th.--Started at 7 A.M. Course S.E.    Jan. 26th.--The Bohr tribe on the east bank. No wind. The current  nearly three miles per hour. The river about a hundred and twenty yards  wide in clear water. Marshes and flats, as usual. Thermometer throughout  the journey, at 6 A.M., 68 degrees Fahr., and at noon 86 to 93 degrees  Fahr.    Jan. 27th.--One day is a repetition of the preceding.    Jan. 28th.--Passed two bivouacs of the Aliab tribe, with great herds  of cattle on the west bank. The natives appeared to be friendly, dancing  and gesticulating as the boats passed. The White Nile tribe not only  milk their cows, but they bleed their cattle periodically, and boil the  blood for food. Driving a lance into a vein in the neck, they bleed the  animal copiously, which operation is repeated about once a month.    Jan. 29th.--Passed a multitude of cattle and natives on a spot on the  right bank, in clouds of smoke as a \"chasse des moustiques.\" They make  tumuli of dung, which are constantly on fire, fresh fuel being  continually added, to drive away the mosquitoes. Around these heaps the  cattle crowd in hundreds, living with the natives in the smoke. By  degrees the heaps of ashes become about eight feet high; they are then  used as sleeping-places and watch-stations by the natives, who, rubbing  themselves all over with the ashes, have a ghastly and devilish  appearance that is indescribable. The country is covered with old tumuli  formed in this manner. A camp may contain twenty or thirty such, in  addition to fresh heaps that are constantly burning. Fires of cow-dung  are also made on the leveled tops of the old heaps, and bundles of green  canes, about sixteen feet high, are planted on the summit; these wave in  the breeze like a plume of ostrich feathers, and give shade to the  people during the heat of the day.    JAN. 30TH.--Arrived at the \"Shir\" tribe. The men are, as usual in  these countries, armed with well-made ebony clubs, two lances, a bow  (always strung), and a bundle of arrows; their hands are completely full  of weapons; and they carry a neatly-made miniature stool slung upon  their backs, in addition to an immense pipe. Thus a man carries all that  be most values about his person. The females in this tribe are not  absolutely naked; like those of the Kytch, they wear small lappets of  tanned leather as broad as the hand; at the back of the belt, which  supports this apron, is a tail which reaches to the lower portions of  the thighs; this tail is formed of finely-cut strips of leather, and  the costume has doubtless been the foundation for the report I had  received from the Arabs, \"that a tribe in Central Africa had tails like  horses.\" The women carry their children very conveniently in a skin  slung from their shoulders across the back, and secured by a thong round  the waist; in this the young savage sits delightfully. The huts  throughout all tribes are circular, with entrances so low that the  natives creep both in and out upon their hands and knees. The men wear  tufts of cock's feathers on the crown of the head; and their favorite  attitude, when standing, is on one leg while leaning on a spear, the  foot of the raised leg resting on the inside of the other knee. Their  arrows are about three feet long, without feathers, and pointed with  hard wood instead of iron, the metal being scarce among the Shir tribe.  The most valuable article of barter for this tribe is the iron hoe  generally used among the White Nile negroes. In form it is precisely  similar to the \"ace of spades.\" The finery most prized by the women are  polished iron anklets, which they wear in such numbers that they reach  nearly half-way up the calf of the leg; the tinkling of these rings is  considered to be very enticing, but the sound reminds one of the  clanking of convicts' fetters.    All the tribes of the White Nile have their harvest of the lotus seed.  There are two species of water-lily--the large white flower, and a  small variety. The seed-pod of the white lotus is like an unblown  artichoke, containing a number of light red grains equal in size to  mustard-seed, but shaped like those of the poppy, and similar to them in  flavour, being sweet and nutty. The ripe pods are collected and strung  upon sharp-pointed reeds about four feet in length. When thus threaded  they are formed into large bundles, and carried from the river to the  villages, where they are dried in the sun, and stored for use. The seed  is ground into flour, and made into a kind of porridge. The women of the  Shir tribe are very clever at manufacturing baskets and mats from the  leaf of the dome palm. They also make girdles and necklaces of minute  pieces of river mussel shells threaded upon the hair of the giraffe's  tail. This is a work of great time, and the effect is about equal to a  string of mother-of-pearl buttons.    Jan. 31st.--At 1.15 P.M. sighted Gebel Lardo, bearing S. 30 degrees  west. This is the first mountain we have seen, and we are at last near  our destination, Gondokoro. I observed to-day a common sand-piper  sitting on the head of a hippopotamus; when he disappeared under water  the bird skimmed over the surface, hovering near the spot until the  animal reappeared, when he again settled.    Feb. 1st.--The character of the river has changed. The marshes have  given place to dry ground; the banks are about four feet above the  water-level, and well wooded; the country having the appearance of an  orchard, and being thickly populated. The natives thronged to the boats,  being astonished at the camels. At one village during the voyage the  natives examined the donkeys with great curiosity, thinking that they  were the oxen of our country, and that we were bringing them to exchange  for ivory.    Feb. 2nd--The mountain Lardo is about twelve miles west of the river.  At daybreak we sighted the mountains near Gondokoro, bearing due south.  As yet I have seen no symptoms of hostility in this country. I cannot  help, thinking that the conduct of the natives depends much upon that of  the traveller. Arrived at Gondokoro. By astronomical observation I  determined the latitude, 4 degrees 55 minutes North, Longitude 31  degrees 46 minutes East. Gondokoro is a great improvement upon the  interminable marshes; the soil is firm and raised about twenty feet  above the river level. Distant mountains relieve the eye accustomed to  the dreary flats of the White Nile; and evergreen trees scattered over  the face of the landscape, with neat little native villages beneath  their shade, form a most inviting landing-place after a long and tedious  voyage. This spot was formerly a mission-station. There remain to this  day the ruins of the brick establishment and church, and the wreck of  what was once a garden; groves of citron and lime-trees still exist, the  only signs that an attempt at civilization has been made--\"seed cast  upon the wayside.\" There is no town. Gondokoro is merely a station of  the ivory traders, occupied for about two months during the year, after  which time it is deserted, when the annual boats return to Khartoum and  the remaining expeditions depart for the interior. A few miserable grass  huts are all that dignify the spot with a name. The climate is unhealthy  and hot. The thermometer from 90 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit at noon in the  shade.    I landed the animals from the boats in excellent condition all rejoicing  in the freedom of open pasturage.        CHAPTER II.    BAD RECEPTION AT GONDOKORO    All were thankful that the river voyage was concluded; the tedium of the  White Nile will have been participated by the reader, upon whom I have  inflicted the journal, as no other method of description could possibly  convey an idea of the general desolation.    Having landed all my stores, and housed my corn in some granaries  belonging to Koorshid Aga, I took a receipt from him for the quantity,  and gave him an order to deliver one-half from my depot to Speke and  Grant, should they arrive at Gondokoro during my absence in the  interior. I was under an apprehension that they might arrive by some  route without my knowledge, while I should be penetrating south.    There were a great number of men at Gondokoro belonging to the various  traders, who looked upon me with the greatest suspicion; they could not  believe that simple travelling was my object, and they were shortly  convinced that I was intent upon espionage in their nefarious ivory  business and slave-hunting.    In conversing with the traders, and assuring them that my object was  entirely confined to a search for the Nile sources, and an inquiry for  Speke and Grant, I heard a curious report that had been brought down by  the natives from the interior, that at some great distance to the south  there were two white men who had been for a long time prisoners of a  sultan; and that these men had wonderful fireworks; that both had been  very ill, and that one had died. It was in vain that I endeavoured to  obtain some further clue to this exciting report. There was a rumour  that some native had a piece of wood with marks upon it that had  belonged to the white men; but upon inquiry I found that this account  was only a report given by some distant tribe. Nevertheless, I attached  great importance to the rumour, as there was no white man south of  Gondokoro engaged in the ivory trade; therefore there was a strong  probability that the report had some connexion with the existence of  Speke and Grant.
