But his professed disciples did not share this temper; they are in  love with his strength only, and seem not to feel his grave and  temperate sweetness.  Theatricality is their chief characteristic;  and that is a quality as little attributable to Michelangelo as to  Mino or Luca Signorelli.  With him, as with them, all is serious,  passionate, impulsive.    This discipleship of Michelangelo, this dependence of his on the  tradition of the Florentine schools, is nowhere seen more clearly  than in his treatment of the Creation.  The Creation of Man had  haunted the mind of the middle age like a dream; and weaving it  into a hundred carved ornaments of capital or doorway, the  Italian sculptors had early impressed upon it that pregnancy of  expression which seems to give it many veiled meanings.  As  with other artistic conceptions of the middle age, its treatment  became almost conventional, handed on from artist to artist, with  slight changes, till it came to have almost an independent and  abstract existence of its own.  It was characteristic of the  medieval mind thus to give an independent traditional existence  to a special pictorial conception, or to a legend, like that of  Tristram or Tannhäuser, or even to the very thoughts and  substance of a book, like the Imitation, so that no single workman  could [92] claim it as his own, and the book, the image, the  legend, had itself a legend, and its fortunes, and a personal  history; and it is a sign of the medievalism of Michelangelo, that  he thus receives from tradition his central conception, and does  but add the last touches, in transferring it to the frescoes of the  Sistine Chapel.    But there was another tradition of those earlier, more serious  Florentines, of which Michelangelo is the inheritor, to which he  gives the final expression, and which centres in the sacristy of  San Lorenzo, as the tradition of the Creation centres in the  Sistine Chapel.  It has been said that all the great Florentines  were preoccupied with death.  Outre-tombe!  Outre-tombe!--is  the burden of their thoughts, from Dante to Savonarola.  Even the  gay and licentious Boccaccio gives a keener edge to his stories by  putting them in the mouths of a party of people who had taken  refuge in a country-house from the danger of death by plague.  It  was to this inherited sentiment, this practical decision that to be  preoccupied with the thought of death was in itself dignifying,  and a note of high quality, that the seriousness of the great  Florentines of the fifteenth century was partly due; and it was  reinforced in them by the actual sorrows of their times.  How  often, and in what various ways, had they seen life stricken down,  in their streets and houses La bella Simonetta dies in early youth,  and is borne to the grave with uncovered face.  The [93] young  Cardinal Jacopo di Portogallo dies on a visit to Florence--insignis  forma fui et mirabili modestia--his epitaph dares to say.  Antonio  Rossellino carves his tomb in the church of San Miniato, with  care for the shapely hands and feet, and sacred attire; Luca della  Robbia puts his skyiest works there; and the tomb of the youthful  and princely prelate became the strangest and most beautiful  thing in that strange and beautiful place.  After the execution of  the Pazzi conspirators, Botticelli is employed to paint their  portraits.  This preoccupation with serious thoughts and sad  images might easily have resulted, as it did, for instance, in the  gloomy villages of the Rhine, or in the overcrowded parts of  medieval Paris, as it still does in many a village of the Alps, in  something merely morbid or grotesque, in the Danse Macabre of  many French and German painters, or the grim inventions of  Dürer.  From such a result the Florentine masters of the fifteenth  century were saved by the nobility of their Italian culture, and  still more by their tender pity for  the thing itself.  They must  often have leaned over the lifeless body, when all was at length  quiet and smoothed out.  After death, it is said, the traces of  slighter and more superficial dispositions disappear; the lines  become more simple and dignified; only the abstract lines  remain, in a great indifference.  They came thus to see death in its  distinction.  Then following it perhaps one [94] stage further,  dwelling for a moment on the point where all this transitory  dignity must break up, and discerning with no clearness a new  body, they paused just in time, and abstained, with a sentiment of  profound pity.    Of all this sentiment Michelangelo is the achievement; and, first  of all, of pity.  Pietà, pity, the pity of the Virgin Mother over the  dead body of Christ, expanded into the pity of all mothers over  all dead sons, the entombment, with its cruel \"hard stones\":--this  is the subject of his predilection.  He has left it in many forms,  sketches, half-finished designs, finished and unfinished groups of  sculpture; but always as a hopeless, rayless, almost heathen  sorrow--no divine sorrow, but mere pity and awe at the stiff limbs  and colourless lips.  There is a drawing of his at Oxford, in which  the dead body has sunk to the earth between the mother's feet,  with the arms extended over her knees.  The tombs in the sacristy  of San Lorenzo are memorials, not of any of the nobler and  greater Medici, but of Giuliano, and Lorenzo the younger,  noticeable chiefly for their somewhat early death.  It is mere  human nature therefore which has prompted the sentiment here.  The titles assigned traditionally to the four symbolical figures,  Night and Day, The Twilight and The Dawn, are far too definite  for them; for these figures come much nearer to the mind and  spirit of their author, and are a more direct expression [95] of his  thoughts, than any merely symbolical conceptions could possibly  have been.  They concentrate and express, less by way of definite  conceptions than by the touches, the promptings of a piece of  music, all those vague fancies, misgivings, presentiments, which  shift and mix and are defined and fade again, whenever the  thoughts try to fix themselves with sincerity on the conditions  and surroundings of the disembodied spirit.  I suppose no one  would come to the sacristy of San Lorenzo for consolation; for  seriousness, for solemnity, for dignity of impression, perhaps, but  not for consolation.  It is a place neither of consoling nor of  terrible thoughts, but of vague and wistful speculation.  Here,  again, Michelangelo is the disciple not so much of Dante as of  the Platonists.  Dante's belief in immortality is formal, precise  and firm, almost as much so as that of a child, who thinks the  dead will hear if you cry loud enough.  But in Michelangelo you  have maturity, the mind of the grown man, dealing cautiously and  dispassionately with serious things; and what hope he has is  based on the consciousness of ignorance--ignorance of man,  ignorance of the nature of the mind, its origin and capacities.  Michelangelo is so ignorant of the spiritual world, of the new  body and its laws, that he does not surely know whether the  consecrated Host may not be the body of Christ.  And of all that  range of sentiment he is the poet, a poet still alive, and in [96]  possession of our inmost thoughts--dumb inquiry over the relapse  after death into the formlessness which preceded life, the change,  the revolt from that change, then the correcting, hallowing,  consoling rush of pity; at last, far off, thin and vague, yet not  more vague than the most definite thoughts men have had  through three centuries on a matter that has been so near their  hearts, the new body--a passing light, a mere intangible, external  effect, over those too rigid, or too formless faces; a dream that  lingers a moment, retreating in the dawn, incomplete, aimless,  helpless; a thing with faint hearing, faint memory, faint power of  touch; a breath, a flame in the doorway, a feather in the wind.    The qualities of the great masters in art or literature, the  combination of those qualities, the laws by which they moderate,  support, relieve each other, are not peculiar to them; but most  often typical standards, or revealing instances of the laws by  which certain aesthetic effects are produced.  The old masters  indeed are simpler; their characteristics are written larger, and are  easier to read, than the analogues of them in all the mixed,  confused productions of the modern mind.  But when once we  have succeeded in defining for ourselves those characteristics,  and the law of their combination, we have acquired a standard or  measure which helps us to put in its right place many a vagrant  genius, many an unclassified talent, many precious though  imperfect [97] products of art.  It is so with the components of the  true character of Michelangelo.  That strange interfusion of  sweetness and strength is not to be found in those who claimed to  be his followers; but it is found in many of those who worked  before him, and in many others down to our own time, in William  Blake, for instance, and Victor Hugo, who, though not of his  school, and unaware, are his true sons, and help us to understand  him, as he in turn interprets and justifies them.  Perhaps this is the  chief use in studying old masters.    1871.        LEONARDO DA VINCI    HOMO MINISTER ET INTERPRES NATURAE    [98] IN Vasari's life of Leonardo da Vinci as we now read it there are  some variations from the first edition.  There, the painter who has  fixed the outward type of Christ for succeeding centuries was a  bold speculator, holding lightly by other men's beliefs, setting  philosophy above Christianity.  Words of his, trenchant enough  to justify this impression, are not recorded, and would have been  out of keeping with a genius of which one characteristic is the  tendency to lose itself in a refined and graceful mystery.  The  suspicion was but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4065"],[0,"Side-Lights on Astronomy and Kindred Fields of Popular Science (#15)"],[1,"of a crank attached to a revolving wheel. The polisher is at the  same time slowly revolving around a pivot at its centre, which pivot  the crank works into, and the glass below it is slowly turned in an  opposite direction. Thus the same effect is produced as in the other  system. Those who practice this method claim that by thus using  machinery the conditions of a uniform polish for every part of the  surface can be more perfectly fulfilled than by a hand motion. The  results, however, do not support this view. No European optician will  claim to do better than the American firm of Alvan Clark & Sons in  producing uniformly good object-glasses, and this firm always does the  work by hand, moving the glass over the polisher, and not the polisher  over the glass.    Having brought both flint and crown glasses into proper figure by this  process, they are joined together, and tested by observations either  upon a star in the heavens, or some illuminated point at a little  distance on the ground. The reflection of the sun from a drop of  quicksilver, a thermometer bulb, or even a piece of broken bottle,  makes an excellent artificial star. The very best optician will always  find that on a first trial his glass is not perfect. He will find that  he has not given exactly the proper curves to secure achromatism. He  must then change the figure of one or both the glasses by polishing it  upon a tool of slightly different curvature. He may also find that  there is some spherical aberration outstanding. He must then alter his  curve so as to correct this. The correction of these little  imperfections in the figures of the lenses so as to secure perfect  vision through them is the most difficult branch of the art of the  optician, and upon his skill in practising it will depend more than  upon anything else his ultimate success and reputation. The shaping of  a pair of lenses in the way we have described is not beyond the power  of any person of ordinary mechanical ingenuity, possessing the  necessary delicacy of touch and appreciation of the problem he is  attacking. But to make a perfect objective of considerable size, which  shall satisfy all the wants of the astronomer, is an undertaking  requiring such accuracy of eyesight, and judgment in determining where  the error lies, and such skill in manipulating so as to remove the  defects, that the successful men in any one generation can be counted  on one's fingers.    In order that the telescope may finally perform satisfactorily it is  not sufficient that the lenses should both be of proper figure; they  must also both be properly centred in their cells. If either lens is  tipped aside, or slid out from its proper central line, the definition  will be injured. As this is liable to happen with almost any telescope,  we shall explain how the proper adjustment is to be made.    The easiest way to test this adjustment is to set the cell with the two  glasses of the objective in it against a wall at night, and going to a  short distance, observe the reflection in the glass of the flame of a  candle held in the hand. Three or four reflections will be seen from  the different surfaces. The observer, holding the candle before his  eye, and having his line of sight as close as possible to the flame,  must then move until the different images of the flame coincide with  each other. If he cannot bring them into coincidence, owing to  different pairs coinciding on different sides of the flame, the glasses  are not perfectly centred upon each other. When the centring is  perfect, the observer having the light in the line of the axes of the  lenses, and (if it were possible to do so) looking through the centre  of the flame, would see the three or four images all in coincidence. As  he cannot see through the flame itself, he must look first on one side  and then on the other, and see if the arrangement of the images seen in  the lenses is symmetrical. If, going to different distances, he finds  no deviation from symmetry, in this respect the adjustment is near  enough for all practical purposes.    A more artistic instrument than a simple candle is a small concave  reflector pierced through its centre, such as is used by physicians in  examining the throat.    [Illustration with caption: IMAGE OF CANDLE-FLAME IN OBJECT-GLASS.]    [Illustration with caption: TESTING ADJUSTMENT OF OBJECT-GLASS.]    Place this reflector in the prolongation of the optical axis, set the  candle so that the light from the reflector shall be shown through the  glass, and look through the opening. Images of the reflector itself  will then be seen in the object-glass, and if the adjustment is  perfect, the reflector can be moved so that they will all come into  coincidence together.    When the objective is in the tube of the telescope, it is always well  to examine this adjustment from time to time, holding the candle so  that its light shall shine through the opening perpendicularly upon the  object-glass. The observer looks upon one side of the flame, and then  upon the other, to see if the images are symmetrical in the different  positions. If in order to see them in this way the candle has to be  moved to one side of the central line of the tube, the whole objective  must be adjusted. If two images coincide in one position of the  candle-flame, and two in another position, so that they cannot all be  brought together in any position, it shows that the glasses are not  properly adjusted in their cell. It may be remarked that this last  adjustment is the proper work of the optician, since it is so difficult  that the user of the telescope cannot ordinarily effect it. But the  perpendicularity of the whole objective to the tube of the telescope is  liable to be deranged in use, and every one who uses such an instrument  should be able to rectify an error of this kind.    The question may be asked, How much of a telescope can an amateur  observer, under any circumstances, make for himself? As a general rule,  his work in this direction must be confined to the tube and the  mounting. We should not, it is true, dare to assert that any ingenious  young man, with a clear appreciation of optical principles, could not  soon learn to grind and polish an object-glass for himself by the  method we have described, and thus obtain a much better instrument than  Galileo ever had at his command. But it would be a wonderful success if  his home-made telescope was equal to the most indifferent one which can  be bought at an optician's. The objective, complete in itself, can be  purchased at prices depending upon the size.    [Footnote: The following is a rough rule for getting an idea of the  price of an achromatic objective, made to order, of the finest quality.  Take the cube of the diameter in inches, or, which is the same thing,  calculate the contents of a cubical box which would hold a sphere of  the same diameter as the clear aperture of the glass. The price of the  glass will then range from $1 to $1.75 for each cubic inch in this box.  For example, the price of a four-inch objective will probably range  from $64 to $112. Very small object-glasses of one or two inches may be  a little higher than would be given by this rule. Instruments which are  not first-class, but will answer most of the purposes of the amateur,  are much cheaper.]    [Illustration with caption: A VERY PRIMITIVE MOUNTING FOR A TELESCOPE.]    The tube for the telescope may be made of paper, by pasting a great  number of thicknesses around a long wooden cylinder. A yet better tube  is made of a simple wooden box. The best material, however, is metal,  because wood and pasteboard are liable both to get out of shape, and to  swell under the influence of moisture. Tin, if it be of sufficient  thickness, would be a very good material. The brighter it is kept, the  better. The work of fitting the objective into one end of a tin tube of  double thickness, and properly adjusting it, will probably be quite  within the powers of the ordinary amateur. The fitting of the eye-piece  into the other end of the tube will require some skill and care both on  his own part and that of his tinsmith.    Although the construction of the eye-piece is much easier than that of  the objective, since the same accuracy in adjusting the curves is not  necessary, yet the price is lower in a yet greater degree, so that the  amateur will find it better to buy than to make his eye-piece, unless  he is anxious to test his mechanical powers. For a telescope which has  no micrometer, the Huyghenian or negative eye-piece, as it is commonly  called, is the best. As made by Huyghens, it consists of two  plano-convex lenses, with their plane sides next the eye, as shown in  the figure.    [Illustration with caption: THE HUYGHENIAN EYE-PIECE.]    So far as we have yet described our telescope it is optically complete.  If it could be used as a spy-glass by simply holding it in the hand,  and pointing at the object we wish to observe, there would be little  need of any very elaborate support. But if a telescope, even of the  smallest size, is to be used with regularity, a proper \"mounting\" is as  essential as a good instrument. Persons unpractised in the use of such  instruments are very apt to underrate the importance of those  accessories which merely enable us to point the telescope. An idea of  what is wanted in the mounting may readily be formed if the reader will  try to look at a star with an ordinary good-sized spy-glass held in the  hand, and then imagine the difficulties he meets with multiplied by  fifty.    The smaller and cheaper telescopes, as commonly sold, are mounted on a  simple little stand, on which the instrument admits of a horizontal and  vertical motion. If one only wants to get a few glimpses of a celestial  object, this mounting will answer his purpose. But to make anything  like a study of a celestial body, the mounting must be an equatorial  one;"]]]
