[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39674"],[0,"Buffalo Land (#15)"],[1," a tilt at us.    Gathering twilight had magnified what in broad day would have been an  apparition sufficiently startling to any new arrival in Buffalo Land. A  long line of black, shaggy forms was standing on the crest and looking  down upon us. It had come forward like the rush of a hungry wave, and  now remained as one uplifted, dark and motionless. In bold relief  against the horizon stood an array of colossal figures, all bristling  with sharp points, which at first sight seemed lances, but at the  second resolved into horns. Then it dawned upon our minds that a herd of  the great American bison stood before us. What a grateful reduction of  lumps in more than one throat, and how the air ran riot in lately  congealed lungs!    Dobeen declared he thought the professor's \"ghosts of the centuries\" had  been looking down upon us.    One old fellow, evidently a leader in Buffalo Land, with long  patriarchial beard and shaggy forehead, remained in front, his head  upraised. His whole attitude bespoke intense astonishment. For years  this had been their favorite path between Arkansas and the Platte. Big  Creek's green valley had given succulent grasses to old and young of the  bison tribe from time immemorial. Every hollow had its traditions of  fierce wolf fights and Indian ambuscades, and many a stout bull could  remember the exact spot where his charge had rescued a mother and her  young from the hungry teeth of starving timber wolves. Every wallow,  tree, and sheltering ravine were sacred in the traditions of Buffalo  Land. The petrified bones of ancestors who fell to sleep there a  thousand years before testified to purity of bison blood and pedigree.    Now all this was changed. Rushing toward their loved valley, they found  themselves in the suburbs of a town. Yells of red man and wolf were  never so horrible as that of the demon flashing along the valley's bed.  A great iron path lay at their feet, barring them back into the  wilderness. Slowly the shaggy monarch shook his head, as if in doubt  whether this were a vision or not; then whirling suddenly, perhaps  indignantly, he turned away and disappeared behind the ridge, and the  bison multitude followed.    Our horses arrived the next morning all safe, excepting a few skin  bruises, the steed Cynocephalus, however, being a trifle stiffer than  usual, from the motion of the cars. When they were trotted out for  inspection, by some hostlers whom we had hired that morning for our  trip, the inhabitants must have considered the sight the next best thing  to a circus.    Apropos of circuses, we learned that one had exhibited for the first and  only time on the plains a few months before. In that country, dear  reader, AEolus has a habit of loafing around with some of his sacks in  which young whirlwinds are put up ready for use. One of these is liable  to be shaken out at any moment, and the first intimation afforded you  that the spirit which feeds on trees and fences is loose, is when it  snatches your hat, and begins flinging dust and pebbles in your eyes.  But to return to our circus performance. For awhile all passed off  admirably. The big tent swallowed the multitude, and it in turn  swallowed the jokes of the clown, older, of course, than himself. In the  customary little tent the living skeleton embodied Sidney Smith's wish  and sat cooling in his bones, while the learned pig and monkey danced to  the melodious accompaniment of the hand-organ.    [Illustration: _BUREAU OF ILLUSTRATION_    GENTLE ZEPHYRS--\"GOING OFF WITHOUT A DRAWBACK.]    Suddenly there was a clatter of poles, and two canvass clouds flew out  of sight like balloons. The living skeleton found himself on a distant  ridge, with the wind whistling among his ribs, while the monkey  performed somersaults which would have astonished the original  Cynocephalus. The pig meanwhile found refuge behind the organ, which the  hurricane, with a better ear for music than man, refused to turn.    \"Mademoiselle Zavenowski, the beautiful leading equestrienne of the  world,\" just preparing to jump through a hoop, went through her own with  a whirl, and stood upon the plains feeding the hungry storm with her  charms. The graceful young rider, lately perforating hearts with the  kisses she flung at them, in a trice had become a maiden of fifty,  noticeably the worse for wear.    An eye-witness, in describing the scene to us, said the circus went off  without a single drawback. It was as if a ton of gunpowder had been  fired under the ring. Just as the clown was rubbing his leg, as the  result of calling the sensitive ring-master a fool (a sham suffering,  though for truth's sake), there was a sharp crack, and the establishment  dissolved. High in air went hats and bonnets, like fragments shot out of  a volcano. The spirits of zephyr-land carried off uncounted hundreds of  tiles, both military and civil, and we desire to place it upon record  that should a future missionary, in some remote northern tribe, find  traditions of a time when the sky rained hats, they may all be accounted  for on purely scientific grounds.    Much property was lost, but no lives. The immediate results were a  bankrupt showman and a run on liniments and sticking-plaster.    Our first hunt was to be on the Saline, which comes down from the west  about fifteen miles north of Hays City.    Before starting, we carefully overhauled our entire outfit. For a long,  busy day nothing was thought of save the cleaning of guns, the oiling of  straps, and the examination of saddles, with sundry additions to  wardrobe and larder. Shamus became a mighty man among grocery-keepers,  and could scarcely have been more popular had he been an Indian supply  agent. The inventory which he gave us of his purchases comprised twelve  cans of condensed milk, with coffee, tea, and sugar, in proportion;  several pounds each of butter, bacon, and crackers; a few loaves of  bread, two sacks of flour, some pickles, and a sufficient number of  tin-plates, cups, and spoons. To these he subsequently added a  half-dozen hams and something like fifty yards of Bologna sausage, which  he told us were for use when we should tire of fresh meat. Sachem  entered protest, declaring that sausage and ham, in a country full of  game, reflected upon us.    [Illustration: _BUREAU OF ILLUSTRATION BUFFALO NY_    \"LOOKED LIKE THE END OF A TAIL.\"]    [Illustration: THE RARE OLD PLAINSMAN OF THE NOVELS.]    Of course, we found use for every item of the above, and especially for  the Bologna. If one can feel satisfied in his own mind as to what  portion of the brute creation is entering into him, a half-yard of  Bologna, tied to the saddle, stays the stomach wonderfully on an all  day's ride. It is so handy to reach it, while trotting along, and with  one's hunting-knife cut off a few inches for immediate consumption.  Semi-Colon, however, who was a youth of delicate stomach, sickened on  his ration one day, because he found something in it which, he said,  looked like the end of a tail. It is a debatable question, to my mind,  whether Satan, among his many ways of entering into man, does not  occasionally do so in the folds of Bologna sausage. Certain it is that,  after such repast, one often feels like Old Nick, and woe be to the man  at any time who is at all dyspeptic. All the forces of one's gastric  juices may then prove insufficient to wage successful battle with the  evil genius which rends him.    Our outfit, as regards transportation, consisted of the animals  heretofore mentioned, and two teams which we hired at Hays, for the  baggage and commissary supplies.    The evening before our departure we rode over to the fort and called  upon General Sheridan. \"Little Phil\" had pitched his camp on the bank of  Big Creek, a short distance below the fort, preferring a soldier's life  in the tent to the more comfortable officer's quarters. This we thought  eminently characteristic of the man. He is an accumulation of tremendous  energy in small compass, a sort of embodied nitro-glycerine, but  dangerous only to his enemies. Famous principally as a cavalry leader,  because Providence flung him into the saddle and started him off at a  gallop, had his destiny been infantry, he would have led it to victory  on the run. And now, officer after officer having got sadly tangled in  the Indian web, which was weaving its strong threads over so fair a  portion of our land, Sheridan was sent forward to cut his way through  it.    The camp was a pretty picture with its line of white tents, the timber  along the creek for a background, and the solemn, apparently illimitable  plains stretching away to the horizon in front. Taken altogether, it  looked more like the comfortable nooning spot of a cavalry scout than  the quarters of a famous General. Our chieftain stood in front of the  center tent, with a few staff-officers lounging near by, his short,  thick-set figure and firm head giving us somehow the idea of a small,  sinewy lion.    We found the General thoroughly conversant with the difficult task to  which he had been called. \"Place the Indians on reservations,\" he said,  \"under their own chiefs, with an honest white superintendency. Let the  civil law reign on the reservation, military law away from it, every  Indian found by the troops off from his proper limits to be treated as  an outlaw.\" It seemed to me that in a few brief sentences this mapped  out a successful Indian policy, part of which indeed has since been  adopted, and the remainder may yet be.    When speaking of late savageries on the plains the eyes of \"Little Phil\"  glittered wickedly. In one case, on Spillman's Creek, a band of  Cheyennes had thrust a rusty sword into the body of a woman with child,  piercing alike mother and offspring, and, giving it a fiendish twist,  left the weapon in her body, the poor woman being found by our soldiers  yet living.    \"I believe it possible,\" said Sheridan, \"at once and forever"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39685"],[0,"Nooks and Corners of Old England (#15)"],[1,"by all appearance was an important house in its day. A  gentleman who resided in a more squalid part related how he had  discovered a cavalier's rapier up in the roof of a mansion, but in a  weak moment had parted with it for half a crown. \"Southfield\" at  Woodchester is perhaps the most picturesque of these stately houses, a  house which near London would fetch a formidable rent, but here a  ridiculously low one. Some six miles out of Stroud a really decent  house, garden, and orchard may be had for next to a song. A light  railway may have now sent prices up, by striking northwards, but not  many years back we saw one very excellent little place \"to let,\" the  rent of which was only sixpence a week, and the tenant had given notice  because the landlord had been so grasping as to raise it to sixpence  halfpenny!    [Illustration: BEVERSTONE CASTLE.]    Between Nailsworth and Tetbury are Beverstone Castle and the secluded  manor-house Chavenage within a mile of it. The castle stands near the  road, an ivy-covered ruin of the time of Edward III., but with portions  dating from the Conquest. Incorporated are some Tudor remains and some  old farm buildings, forming together a pleasing picture.    To Major-General Massey, Beverstone, like Sudeley, is indebted for its  battered appearance. It held out for the king, but Massey with three  hundred and eighty men came and took it by storm. The general having  done as much damage as possible in Gloucestershire during the Civil War,  at length made some repairs by fighting on the other side at Worcester;  and perhaps it was as well, for had he been on the victorious side he  might have treated \"the faithful city\" with as little respect as  Beverstone. In the peaceful days of the Restoration, which Massey  lived to see, as there were no more castles to blow up he dabbled  in the pyrotechnic art, suggestive of the pathetic passage in  _Patience_--Yearning for whirlwinds, and having to do the best you can  with the bellows.    The regicide squire of Chavenage must also have been skilled in the  noble art, for by common report at his death a few months after that of  the martyr king, he vanished in flames of fire! But there was a  ceremonious preliminary before this simple and effective mode of  cremation. A sable coach driven by a headless coachman with a star upon  his breast arrived at the dead man's door, and the shrouded form of the  regicide was seen to glide into it. But bad as Nathaniel Stephens may  have been, it is scarcely just that all future lords of Chavenage must  make their exit in this manner.    The old house is unpretentious in appearance. Built in the form of the  letter E, it has tall latticed windows lighting a great hall (famous  once for its collection of armour), and a plain wing on either side,  with narrow Elizabethan Gothic-headed windows. There is a ghostly look  about it. It stands back from the road, but sufficiently near that one  may see the entrance porch (bearing the date 1579) and the ruts of the  carriage wheels upon the trim carriage drive. Arguments as strong as any  in _Ingoldsby_ to prove the mystic story must be true.          NOOKS IN NORTHERN  WILTSHIRE      After a sojourn in north-west Wilts it is refreshing to dip into the  wooded lanes of the Home Counties and see again the red-brick cottages  and homesteads which have such a snug and homely look after the cold  grey stone and glaring chalk roads. For old-world villages and  manor-houses, however, one could not choose a better exploring ground,  but not, please note, for the craze of picking up bits of old oak,  judging by what we overheard the very first day we stopped in one of the  most out-of-the-way places of all.    \"Anything old inside?\" asked somebody at the doorway, having led gently  and gracefully up to it so as not to arouse suspicion. \"Nothing,\" was  the reply. \"May I look round inside?\" was asked. \"No.\" Then after a  pause. \"Any other of the cottagers got any old chairs, or china?\" \"One  or two of them _had_ some, but they sold what they had to Mrs. ---- of  ----.\" \"_Of_ course,\" was the disgusted reply; \"she's _always_ first, and  gets everything!\"    The conversation gives but an idea of the systematic way that a crusade  for the antique is carried on. If the hunter makes a \"find,\" and the  owner will not part, that unfortunate cottager is persecuted until he or  she does part, sooner or later to regret the folly. And, alas! churches  are not even sacred from these sharks. How often have we not seen some  curious piece of furniture mentioned as being in the church, and, lo! it  has vanished--where? And do not the empty brackets over many an ancient  tomb tell a tale? What have become of the helmets of the ancient lords  of the manors? We can quote an instance offhand. In the fine old church  of Bromham, three of the helmets of the manorial lords, the Bayntons,  are still there, two of them perhaps only funereal helmets, and not the  actual casques of warfare; but there are three if not four vacant  brackets which perchance once supported the envied headpieces with  pointed visor of the fifteenth century. Aloft also are some rusty  gauntlets, and one of the helmets still bears the crest of the eagle's  head. The manor descended from the Beauchamps to the Bayntons, the last  of whom was the nineteenth in descent from Sir Henry Baynton, Knight  Marshal of the household to Henry the Second. His mother was the eldest  daughter and co-heiress of John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, and Miss  Malet the runaway heiress. A recumbent effigy of Sir Roger Touchet in  alabaster (resembling in a remarkable degree the late Sir Henry Irving  as Richard III.) is covered with the carved initials of vandal visitors,  not, we may add, only of our own and fathers' and grandfathers' time,  but dating back from the reign of Elizabeth; so it is comforting to see  that our ancestors were as prone to disfigure monuments in this way as  is the modern 'Arry. One of the initials, I. W., perhaps may be that of  the witty and wicked Earl of Rochester, who by repute made Spye an  occasional residence, although the Bayntons certainly held the estate  some years after the Lady Anne, his daughter's death in 1703. The  ceiling of the Baynton chapel is richly carved, and the bosses and  brackets show their original faded colouring of blue and gold. There are  also coloured niches for saints; and on a canopied tomb of Elizabeth  Touchet, a brass of a kneeling figure, and a tablet of the coat of arms  is enamelled in colours. There also is a fine brass of John Baynton in  Gothic armour.    [Illustration: GATE-HOUSE, SPYE PARK.]    All that remains of the old Jacobean house of Spye is a subterranean  passage beneath the terrace; but the Tudor entrance gate to the  picturesque park stands on the left-hand side of the road to Lacock just  before the road begins its winding precipitous descent. Evelyn saw the  house soon after it was built, and likened it to a long barn. The view  is superb, but, strangely enough, not a single window looked out upon  the prospect! After dining and a game of bowls with Sir Edward Baynton,  the Diarist took coach; but, says Evelyn, \"in the meantime our coachmen  were made so exceeding drunk, that in returning home we escaped great  dangers. This, it seems, was by order of the knight, that all  gentlemen's servants be so treated; but the custom is barbarous and much  unbecoming a knight, still less a Christian.\"    A mile or so to the east of the entrance gate of Spye is Sandy Lane, a  tiny hamlet with trim thatched cottages and a sturdy seventeenth-century  hostelry, the \"George,\" looking down the street; and farther along in  the direction of Devizes stands the \"Bell,\" another ancient roadside  inn, which, judging from its mullioned windows, knobbed gables, and  rustic porch, must date back to the days of the first Charles.    In Bromham village also there are some pretty half-timber buildings, not  forgetting the \"lock-up\" by the churchyard. The exterior of the church  is richly sculptured; a fine example of the purest Gothic.    [Illustration: LACOCK.]    [Illustration: LACOCK.]    Sleepy old Lacock, with its numerous overhanging gables, is a typical  unspoiled village. It was once upon a time a town, but by all  appearances it never can have been a flourishing one; and let us hope it  will remain in its dormant state now that there is nothing out of  harmony, for the Lacock of to-day must look very much as it did two  hundred years or more ago. It consists mainly of two wide streets, with  a fine old church at the end of one and a lofty seventeenth-century inn  at the other. Opposite the latter is a monastic barn with blocked-up  arched doorway, and facing it a fine row of timbered houses. Wherever  you go the pervading tone is grey, and one misses the little front  gardens with bright flowers and creepers. By the school stands the  village cross. Farther along a great wide porch projects into the  street, and over it a charming traceried wooden window. Nearer the  church the road narrows, and a group of timber cottages make a pleasing  picture, one of them with a wide entrance of carved oak spandrels above  an earlier stone doorway. The church, a noble edifice, has a very  graceful spire and some good tombs, including two wooden mural monuments  to Edward Baynard who lived in Elizabeth's reign, and to Lady Ursula  Baynard in the reign of Charles I.    The monument of Sir John Talbot of Lacock describes him as born of the  most noble family of the Duke of Shrewsbury, which is somewhat  confusing. Sir John was descended from John, second Earl of Shrewsbury,  who died in 1460, and his monument was erected when the twelfth earl and  first duke was living. Sir John died in 1713, and his son and heir  predeceased him, as mentioned on the monument.
