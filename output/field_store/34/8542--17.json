It is best to drive the ducklings just  after they have been fed as they are not so nervous and afraid at that  time.    The increased width of the pens in the second and third portions of the  house is for the purpose of taking care of the growth of the ducklings  as they are moved along the house. Pens of the same width as those in  which they were started become too crowded as the ducklings increase in  size.    _Equipment of the Pen._ The equipment of the pens is quite simple. Water  is piped through the house along both walls so that it is available to  each pen. A spigot is provided in each pen and under this is placed the  drinking dish, which consists of a round metal pan about a foot in  diameter and 3 or 4 inches deep. A square pan should never be used as  the ducklings are apt to get their bills caught in the corners. One  quarter inch mesh wire netting is bent in a circle and placed in the  drinking dish as a guard to keep the ducklings from getting into the  pan. This guard should be made of such size that there is a space  between the wire and the edge of the dish of about 1-1/2 inches all around.  This guard should be about 8 inches high. The water pan itself is set  upon a wire covered frame about 18 inches square under which is dug a  pit 4 or 5 inches deep to drain away any water which the ducklings slop  out of the pan. Such an arrangement keeps the pens from becoming sloppy  and damp.    Each pen must also have a flat metal dish on which to place the feed for  the little ducks. Metal pans are better than wooden feeding trays as  they are easier to keep clean.    In each pen is provided a small hopper filled with fine sharp creek sand  to which the ducklings have access at all times. Some duck growers  prefer to mix the sand in the feed rather than to provide it in hoppers.  After the ducklings are allowed to run in the yards, sand need not be  furnished if the yards are sand as the ducklings will help  themselves. If the land in the yards is not sand, however, it is  necessary to continue to furnish this material.    [Illustration: FIG. 24. Watering arrangement in the brooder pens for  young ducklings. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S.  Department of Agriculture._)]    [Illustration: FIG. 25. Another type of No. 1 brooder house. Here the  hovers are along the back of the house and the work is done from an  alleyway along the front. The box with handles on top of the hover is  used in carrying the newly hatched ducklings from the incubator cellar  to the brooder house. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry,  U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]    _Grading and Sorting the Ducklings._ As the ducklings are moved from pen  to pen through this house as well as the other houses, they are  constantly graded for size and thriftiness, the smaller, less thrifty  individuals being left with younger lots. Some ducklings do not grow as  quickly as others, and these if left with ducklings larger than  themselves will not get their share of the feed and will not do as well.  In this connection it should be noted that when young ducks are not  fairly clean it is a good indication that they are not doing as well as  they should.    _Cleaning and Bedding the Pens._ Careful attention must be given to  keeping the pens and the ducklings themselves clean if they are to do  well. Therefore the pens must be cleaned out as often as may be  necessary to accomplish this purpose. The judgment of the brooder man  must decide how often this is necessary but it will be at least once a  week. When cleaning the pens the old bedding is thrown out from the  front pens through the windows and from the back pens through the door  provided in the rear wall for this purpose. Bedding the pens must be  done more frequently, usually about every other day. Fresh bedding will  help to absorb the droppings and will keep the pens from becoming sloppy  or sticky. For bedding, straw, meadow hay, swale hay or any other  suitable material available should be utilized.    _Ventilation._ Plenty of ventilation is required in the brooder house in  order to take out the ammonia odor which arises from the droppings.  Properly managed, the doors and windows provide sufficient means of  ventilation but some duck growers prefer to have roof ventilators in  addition.    _Other Types of Brooder Houses._ Many other types of brooder houses are  used, some of them being shed roof construction and many of them being  built narrower than this house, that is to say, 14, 16 or 18 feet wide  with an alleyway along the front or rear side of the house from which  the work is done. The hovers are placed at the back of the pens when the  alley-way is in the front, otherwise, they are placed next to the  alley-way. The disadvantages of these houses are that only single pens  are provided and that valuable brooding space is used up by the  alley-way. The advantages of the house described above lie in the fact  that the hovers are in the center of the house with the pens on each  side of this, thus doubling the capacity, and that by making use of a  walk over the hover pipe no room is wasted in an alley-way. Having pens  on each side also lessens the labor of taking care of the ducklings to  some extent as the arrangement is more compact.      Length of Time in Brooder    _In House No. 1._ As a rule the ducklings are kept in the No. 1 house  until they are from 2 to 3 weeks old, this of course depending somewhat  upon the time of year and the weather and also upon the number of  ducklings for which accommodations must be provided at any particular  time. As the ducks are moved down through the house and eventually reach  the last pens they are taken from this house and placed in brooder house  No. 2.    _Brooder House No. 2._ This is a heated house like brooder house No. 1  but in which it is not necessary to maintain so high a temperature.  Sufficient heating apparatus should be installed to make it possible to  maintain the temperature at 60 degrees if this becomes necessary in the  early spring.    The particular brooder house described is 14 feet wide and has a shed  roof. It is provided with a window in the front of each pen. No openings  are required along the back since this is not a double pen house. The  space in such a house could undoubtedly be used to better advantage if  it were constructed as wide as the No. 1 house and the hot water pipes  and walk put through the middle of the house so as to provide double  pens. In this house the hot water pipes are run along the rear of the  pens, and while hovers are not really necessary, a walk is constructed  over the pipes in order to save space and provide a convenient place  from which to do the work, and this forms hovers.    Ordinarily after May 1 no heat is needed in the No. 2 house. The pens in  this house are 12 feet wide and they are equipped with feeding and  watering arrangements as in brooder house No. 1. As the ducklings are  moved to this house from the No. 1 house from 150 to 200 are placed in  each pen. They are moved through the house from pen to pen in the same  manner as in the No. 1 house to make way for new arrivals. As a rule  they stay in this house about two weeks depending somewhat on the  weather and upon the number of ducklings being brooded. Yards are used  in connection with this house which are the same width as the pens and  50 feet in length. As in the No. 1 house the pens in this house should  be cleaned at least once a week and they should be bedded with straw or  other bedding material every other day. As soon as the ducks have been  moved through this No. 2 house they are put in brooder house No. 3.    [Illustration: FIG. 26. Brooder house No. 2 and yards. The trees furnish  fine shade for the growing ducklings. (_Photograph from the Bureau of  Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]    Brooder House No. 3    This is a shed roof house 16 feet wide equipped with single pens. No  heat is required in this house. Yards of the same width as the pens and  50 feet deep are used. Usually the ducks are fed outside the house from  a wagon driven along a roadway just in front of the yards.    The pens are 16 feet wide and the same number of ducks is used in them  as in the No. 2 house. As a rule the ducks stay in this house about 2  weeks and are then moved to the duck pens or shelters with the larger  yards which may or may not have water. From this point on the ducks are  termed yard ducks.    In all three of the brooder houses the young ducks are supplied with  their drinking water from pipes through the houses. They are not given  access to water until they are moved to the yards.    [Illustration: FIG. 27. Brooder house No. 3. At the time this picture  was taken there were no ducklings in the house and advantage was taken  of this fact to give it a good cleaning by throwing out the bedding and  droppings, which will be hauled away and spread on cropped land.
