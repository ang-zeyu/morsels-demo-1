Oliver Huntington who is still living testifies that they were very      intimate as boys, and when together had often talked the matter      over.        Referring to Mr. Evans again. I said: \"Does this prove him (Joseph)      an honest man?\" Now does this cover the ground of your inquiry? I      have so often been interrupted by callers, that I may not have been      explicit enough. My personal testimony you already have, if not you      can get it by referring to \"Reminiscences of Latter-day Saints,\"      by L. O. Littlefield, which you will find at the President's      (Historian's) office.    Does this read much like she had been correctly represented?      BRIGHAM YOUNG UPHELD BY THE LORD    In reference to the wicked charge you make in your discourse mentioned  in Aunt Lucy's letter, against President Young of practicing gross  immorality while on his mission in England in 1840 and winter of 1841,  a sufficient answer will be found in the revelation of January 19,  1841, wherein the Lord, by revelation through the Prophet Joseph Smith  declares:        I give to you _my servant_ Brigham Young, to be a President over      the Twelve traveling Council,        Which Twelve hold the keys to open up the authority of my kingdom      upon the four corners of the earth, and after that to send my word      to every creature.    And the revelation of July 9, 1841, given after his return from England:        * * * Verily thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Brigham, it      is no more required at your hand to leave your family as in times      past, for your offering is acceptable to me.    In this abusive charge against President Young you are striking at  Jehovah, and accusing Him, either of condoning such a grievous sin, or  failing to discover it. Such a charge as that is ridiculously absurd,  I feel safe in accepting the word of the Lord in preference to the  ribald, indecent statements of those who speak forth the vulgar desires  of their own minds.                                             Respectfully,                                                  Joseph F. Smith, Jr.      Footnotes    1. I am not so blind in my admiration of the \"Mormon\" people or so  bigoted in my devotion to the \"Mormon\" faith as to think there are  no individuals in the Church chargeable with fanaticism, folly,  intemperate speech, and wickedness; nor am I blind to the fact that  some in their over-zeal have lacked judgment; and that in times of  excitement, under stress of special provocation, even \"Mormon\" leaders  have given utterances to ideas that are indefensible. But I have yet to  learn that it is just in a writer of history, or of \"purpose fiction,\"  that \"speak truly,\" to make a collection of these things and represent  them as the essence of that faith against which said writer draws an  indictment.    \"No one would measure the belief of 'Christians,'\" says a truly great  writer, \"by certain statements in the Fathers, nor judge the moral  principles of Roman Catholics by prurient quotations from the Casuist;  nor yet estimate Lutherans by the utterances and deeds of the early  successors of Luther, nor Calvinists by the burning of Servetus. In all  such cases the general standpoint of the times has to be first taken  into account.\"--Edeshiem's Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah, preface  p. 8.    A long time ago the great Edmund Burke in his defense of the rashness  expressed in both speech and action of some of our patriots of the  American revolution period said: \"It is not fair to judge of the temper  of the disposition of any man or any set of men when they are composed  and at rest from their conduct or their expressions in a state of  disturbance and irritation.\"    2. Writing of the Mormon Meadows massacre Hubert H. Bancroft, in his  History of Utah, page 544 says: \"Indeed it may well be understood at  the outset that this horrible crime, so often and so persistently  charged upon the Mormon church and its leaders, was the crime of an  individual, the crime of a fanatic of the worst stamp, one who was a  member of the Mormon church, but of whose intentions the church knew  nothing, and whose bloody acts the members of the church, high and  low, regard with as much abhorrence as any out of the church. Indeed,  the blow fell upon the brotherhood with threefold force and damage.  There was the cruelty of it, which wrung their hearts; there was the  odium attending its performance in their midst; and there was the  strength it lent their enemies further to malign and molest them. The  Mormons denounce the Mountain Meadows massacre, and every act connected  therewith, as earnestly and as honestly as any in the outside world.  This is abundantly proved, and may be accepted as a historical fact.\"    3. See also Doctrine and Covenants section 101:80, on this point.    4.

THE SAINTS' HERALD ON THE ORIGIN OF PLURAL MARRIAGE    In both replies to Mr. Evans, mention is made of two articles in the  _Saints' Herald_, volume one, that were written by Isaac Sheen, the  first editor of that paper. These references were ignored by Mr. Evans  in his publication of a portion of the foregoing correspondence. It  would occupy too much space to copy these articles in full as they  are quite lengthy, but I feel that the gist of the matter should be  presented in more detail than it is given in the replies.    Mr. Sheen's argument is that the Saints at Nauvoo \"set up their idols  in their heart,\" and went to the Prophet Joseph Smith and asked him to  inquire of the Lord and ascertain from Him if it would not be proper  for them to practice plural marriage. This the Prophet Joseph did and  in answer the Lord gave him the revelation on celestial marriage,  granting the practice of plural marriage, and then, after giving this  revelation the Lord smote the Prophet for his 'iniquity' in asking for  the revelation, and poured out wrath and indignation upon the Saints  for their participation in what he calls \"abominations.\"    Reference is also made to the prophecies of Ezekiel, Balaam and Micaiah  to substantiate his theory which Mr. Sheen admits he is unable to  \"satisfactorily explain.\" An extensive quotation from the first article  follows, which will give an idea of the position in which the members  of the Reorganized church regard the Prophet Joseph Smith and the  culmination of his most glorious mission.      STATEMENT OF ISAAC SHEEN        We might call your attention to many prophecies in the Bible which      these backsliders[1] have fulfilled by their abominations. Ezekiel      appears to have had a very clear manifestation of the wickedness of      these men and the plan pursued by them, by which they embark into      polygamy. In Ezekiel 14 c. 1, 5, v, the prophet says, \"Then came      certain elders of Israel unto me, saying, Son of man, these men      have set up their idols in their heart and put the stumblingblock      of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all      by them? Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith      the Lord God; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his      idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity      before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the Lord, will      answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;      that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because      they are all estranged from me through their idols.\" We have shown      you that God gave a revelation unto us in which he commanded that      every man should \"cleave unto his wife and none else,\" and that      he commanded us saying, \"Repent and remember the Book of Mormon      and the former commandments which I have given them, not only to      say, but to do according to that which I have written,\" and that      in that book there is much testimony against polygamy. All these      instructions were sufficient for our guidance, but \"men have set      up their idols in their hearts, and put the stumblingblock of      their iniquity before their faces.\" This adulterous spirit had      captivated their hearts and they desired a license from God to      lead away captive the fair daughters of His people, and in this      state of mind they came to the Prophet Joseph. Could the Lord do      anything more or less than what Ezekiel hath prophesied? The Lord      hath declared by Ezekiel what kind of an answer he would give them,      therefore he answered them according to the multitude of their      idols. Paul had also prophesied that \"for this cause God shall send      them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie; that they      all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure      in unrighteousness.\" Both these prophecies agree. In Ezekiel's      prophecy the Lord also says, \"I will set my face against that      man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him      off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the      Lord. And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I      the Lord have deceived that prophet,[2] and I will stretch out my      hand upon him and I will destroy him from the midst of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50536"],[0,"Gospel Themes: A Treatise on Salient Features of \"Mormonism\" (#15)"],[1,"he may present both gifts and sacrifices for sins.\" In  Arabic, the word denotes to prophesy, to foretell, as a soothsayer,  also to act as a mediator or middle person in any business. In the  earliest families of the race of Shem, the offices of priest and  prophet were united, so that the word originally meant both. The Hebrew  idiom kept one part of the idea, and the Arabic another. The primary  meaning of the Hebrew word is regarded to be the rendering of honorable  and dignified service, like that of ministers of state to their  sovereign.    Meaning of \"Priesthood.\"--\"Priesthood\" is the office or character of  a priest. The term also denotes the execution of that office, and  signifies a class of priests, or the order of men set apart for sacred  offices--priests collectively.    So much for human wisdom, and what it has gleaned upon this subject  from the literary fields of the past.    To the Latter-day Saints, who owe most of their knowledge concerning it  to modern revelation, \"Priesthood\" means divine authority, conferred  upon men chosen of God to officiate in his name and in his stead. It  also signifies the men bearing that authority, the possession of which  constitutes them legal representatives of the Almighty. \"No man taketh  this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.\"  (Hebrews 5:4.)    Necessity for a Priesthood.--The necessity for a priesthood is as  obvious as the necessity for a gospel. The laws of God, like the laws  of man, require officers and a government to administer them. God  cannot be everywhere in person. He is omnipresent by his Spirit, his  power, his authority, and his influence. But in person, being in the  form of man, he is subject to certain limitations, imposed by eternal  law and the very nature of things. There are some things that even  the Omnipotent cannot do. I speak it with all reverence, and for a  good purpose--the teaching of the truth in plainness. For instance,  he cannot make something out of nothing, though many pious people  ascribe to him that power--the power to perform the impossible and  absurd. He cannot be in two or more places, at precisely one and the  same time--not in person. Therefore, to carry on his work throughout  the universe, he must have agents to represent him, and this is the  fundamental fact underlying the necessity for a Priesthood and a Church  organization.    President Smith's Definition.--When we speak of Priesthood we mean  God's authority, and the men holding that authority, to administer the  laws and ordinances of the gospel. Let me cite here some remarks made  by President Joseph F. Smith, at a general conference of the Church.  Said he:    \"What is Priesthood? It is nothing more nor less than the power of God  delegated to man, by which man can act in the earth for the salvation  of the human family, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy  Ghost; and act legitimately in assuming that authority--an authority  that has been given in this day in which we live, by ministering angels  and spirits from above, direct from the presence of Almighty God, who  have come to the earth and administered the priesthood to the children  of men. * * * It is the same power and priesthood that was committed  to the disciples of Christ while he was upon the earth; that whatever  should be bound on earth should be bound in heaven, and whatever should  be loosed on earth should be loosed in heaven.\"    The Principle of Representation.--Inherent in the Priesthood is the  principle of representation. Priesthood, as President Smith affirms,  is the delegated authority of God, and so plenary and far-reaching are  its powers, that when those holding that authority are in the line of  their duty, and have the spirit of their calling, their official acts  and utterances are as valid as if God himself were personally present,  doing and saying what his servants do and say for him.    A Soul-Searching Admonition.--A tremendous power for frail mortal man  to wield! Yes; and to guard against its abuse, the exercise of this  divine prerogative by weak human beings is hedged about with certain  conditions and limitations, as indicated by the following inspired  admonition from the lips of Joseph the Seer:    \"Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they  not chosen?    \"Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world,  and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one  lesson--    \"That the rights of the Priesthood are inseparably connected with the  powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor  handled only upon the principles of righteousness.    \"That they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake  to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to  exercise control, or dominion, or compulsion, upon the souls of the  children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens  withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is  withdrawn, Amen to the Priesthood, or the authority of that man.    \"Behold! ere he is aware, he is left unto himself, to kick against the  pricks; to persecute the saints, and to fight against God.    \"We have learned, by sad experience, that it is the nature and  disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority,  as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous  dominion.    \"Hence many are called, but few are chosen.    \"No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the  Priesthood, only by persuasion, by long suffering, by gentleness, and  meekness, and by love unfeigned;    \"By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul  without hypocrisy, and without guile.    \"Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost,  and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom  thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy;    \"That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of  death;    \"Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the  household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly,  then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God, and the  doctrine of the Priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from  heaven.    \"The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy sceptre an  unchanging sceptre of righteousness and truth, and thy dominion shall  be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow  unto thee for ever and ever.\"--(D. and C. 121:34-46.)    An Echo from Eternity.--Can anyone, enlightened by the Holy Spirit,  doubt the heavenly origin of such wise and sublime instructions? Are  they not virtually an echo from the heights of eternity, where the Gods  sat in council before the foundation of the world, and decreed freedom,  not tyranny; persuasion, not compulsion; charity, not intolerance, to  be the platform upon which the servants of God should stand?    \"Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to  destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and  also that I should give unto him mine own power, by the power of mine  Only Begotten I caused that he should be cast down.\" (Moses 4:3.)    A Gold and Silver Shield.--But there is another side to the question.  It is a gold and silver shield that we are contemplating. If those  bearing the priesthood are careful to confine themselves to the lawful  and legitimate exercise of the sacred powers conferred upon them,  acting as men of God should act, and doing no other things than those  commanded by divine revelation or inspired by the Holy Spirit; what  then? In that event the responsibility shifts to other shoulders, and  just how weighty the responsibility is, the Savior himself tells in the  following prophetic parable:    How God Will Judge the World.--\"When the Son of Man shall come in his  glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the  throne of his glory:    \"And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate  them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:    \"And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the  left.    \"Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed  of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation  of the world:    \"For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave  me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:    \"Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in  prison, and ye came unto me.    \"Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an  hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?    \"When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed  thee?    \"Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?    \"And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto  you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these, my  brethren, ye have done it unto me.    \"Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye  cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:    \"For I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirsty, and ye  gave me no drink:    \"I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not:  sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.    \"Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an  hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison,  and did not minister unto thee?    \"Then shall he answer them, saying. Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as  ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.    \"And these shall go away into everlasting punishment; but the righteous  into life eternal.\" (Matthew 25:31-46.)
