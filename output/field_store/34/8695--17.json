Peace was determined to test the extent of the reverend gentleman's  faith in his asseverations. \"Now, sir,\" he said, \"I understand that you  still have the impression that I stole the clock from your day-schools.\"  Mr. Littlewood admitted that such was his impression. \"I thought so,\"  replied Peace, \"and this has caused me much grief and pain, for I can  assure you I have so much respect for you personally that I would rather  have given you a clock and much more besides than have taken it. At the  time your clock was stolen I had reason for suspecting that it was taken  by some colliers whom I knew.\" There was a pause. Mr. Littlewood thought  that Peace was going to give him the name of the colliers. But that was  not Peace's way. He said sharply: \"Do you now believe that I have spoken  the truth in denying that I took your clock, and will you leave me  to-day fully believing that I am innocent of doing that?\" Mr. Littlewood  looked at him closely and appeared to be deliberating on his reply.  Peace watched him intently. At last Mr. Littlewood said, \"Peace, I am  convinced that you did not take the clock. I cannot believe that you  dare deny it now in your position, if you really did.\" Once more Peace  burst into tears, and was unable for some time to speak.    Having recovered his self-possession, Peace turned to the serious  business of confession. He dealt first with the murder of Dyson.    He maintained that his relations with Mrs. Dyson had been of an intimate  character. He wanted to see her on the night of the crime in order  to get her to induce her husband to withdraw the warrant which he had  procured against him; he was tired, he said, of being hunted about  from place to place. He intercepted Mrs. Dyson as she crossed the  yard. Instead of listening to him quietly Mrs. Dyson became violent and  threatening in her language. Peace took out his revolver, and, holding  it close to her head, warned her that he was not to be trifled with. She  refused to be warned. Dyson, hearing the loud voices, came out of his  house. Peace tried to get away down the passage into Banner Cross Road,  but Dyson followed and caught hold of him. In the struggle Peace fired  one barrel of his revolver wide. Dyson seized the hand in which Peace  was holding the weapon. \"Then I knew,\" said Peace, \"I had not a moment  to spare. I made a desperate effort, wrenched the arm from him and fired  again. All that was in my head at the time was to get away. I never did  intend, either there or anywhere else, to take a man's life; but I was  determined that I should not be caught at that time, as the result,  knowing what I had done before, would have been worse even than had I  stayed under the warrant.\" If he had intended to murder Dyson, Peace  pointed out that he would have set about it in quite a different and  more secret way; it was as unintentional a thing as ever was done; Mrs.  Dyson had committed the grossest perjury in saying that no struggle had  taken place between her husband and himself.    It is to be remembered that Peace and Mrs. Dyson were the sole  witnesses of what took place that night between the two men. In point  of credibility there may be little to choose between them, but Peace can  claim for his account that it was the statement of a dying, and, to all  appearances, sincerely repentant sinner.    Peace then repeated to Mr. Littlewood his confession of the killing of  Constable Cock, and his desire that Habron should be set free.(11) As to  this part of his career Peace indulged in some general reflections.  \"My great mistake, sir,\" he said, \"and I can see it now as my end  approaches, has been this--in all my career I have used ball cartridge.  I can see now that in using ball cartridge I did wrong I ought to have  used blank cartridge; then I would not have taken life.\" Peace said that  he hoped he would meet his death like a hero. \"I do not say this in  any kind of bravado. I do not mean such a hero as some persons will  understand when they read this. I mean such a hero as my God might wish  me to be. I am deeply grieved for all I have done, and would atone  for it to the utmost of my power.\" To Mr. Littlewood the moment seemed  convenient to suggest that as a practical means of atonement Peace  should reveal to him the names of the persons with whom he had disposed  of the greater part of his stolen property. But in spite of much  attempted persuasion by the reverend gentleman Peace explained that he  was a man and meant to be a man to the end.           (11) William Habron was subsequently given a free pardon and L800 by way  of compensation.      Earlier in their interview Peace had expressed to Mr. Littlewood a hope  that after his execution his name would never be mentioned again, but  before they parted he asked Mr. Littlewood, as a favour, to preach a  sermon on him after his death to the good people of Darnall. He wished  his career held up to them as a beacon, in order that all who saw might  avoid his example, and so his death be of some service to society.    Before Mr. Littlewood left, Peace asked him to hear him pray. Having  requested the warders to kneel down, Peace began a prayer that lasted  twenty minutes. He prayed for himself, his family, his victims, Mr.  Littlewood, society generally, and all classes of the community. Mr.  Littlewood described the prayer as earnest, fervent and fluent. At the  end Peace asked Mr. Littlewood if he ought to see Mrs. Dyson and beg  her forgiveness for having killed her husband. Mr. Littlewood, believing  erroneously that Mrs. Dyson had already left the country, told Peace  that he should direct all his attention to asking forgiveness of his  Maker. At the close of their interview Peace was lifted into bed and,  turning his face to the wall, wept.    Tuesday, February 25, was the day fixed for the execution of Peace.  As the time drew near, the convict's confidence in ultimate salvation  increased. A Dr. Potter of Sheffield had declared in a sermon that \"all  hope of Peace's salvation was gone for ever.\" Peace replied curtly,  \"Well, Dr. Potter may think so, but I don't.\" Though his health had  improved, Peace was still very feeble in body. But his soul was hopeful  and undismayed. On the Saturday before his death his brother and  sister-in-law, a nephew and niece visited him for the last time. He  spoke with some emotion of his approaching end. He said he should die  about eight o'clock, and that at four o'clock an inquest would be held  on his body; he would then be thrown into his grave without service  or sermon of any kind. He asked his relatives to plant a flower on a  certain grave in a cemetery in Sheffield on the day of his execution. He  was very weak, he said, but hoped he should have strength enough to  walk to the scaffold. He sent messages to friends and warnings to avoid  gambling and drinking. He begged his brother to change his manner of  life and \"become religious.\" His good counsel was not apparently  very well received. Peace's visitors took a depressing view of their  relative's condition. They found him \"a poor, wretched, haggard man,\"  and, meeting Mrs. Thompson who was waiting outside the gaol for news of  \"dear Jack,\" wondered how she could have taken up with such a man.    When, the day before his execution, Peace was visited for the last time  by his wife, his stepson, his daughter, Mrs. Bolsover, and her husband,  he was in much better spirits. He asked his visitors to restrain  themselves from displays of emotion, as he felt very happy and did  not wish to be disturbed. He advised them to sell or exhibit for money  certain works of art of his own devising. Among them was a design  in paper for a monument to be placed over his grave. The design is  elaborate but well and ingeniously executed; in the opinion of Frith,  the painter, it showed \"the true feeling of an artist.\" It is somewhat  in the style of the Albert Memorial, and figures of angels are prominent  in the scheme. The whole conception is typical of the artist's sanguine  and confident assurance of his ultimate destiny. A model boat and a  fiddle made out of a hollow bamboo cane he wished also to be made the  means of raising money. He was describing with some detail the ceremony  of his approaching death and burial when he was interrupted by a sound  of hammering. Peace listened for a moment and then said, \"That's a noise  that would make some men fall on the floor. They are working at my own  scaffold.\" A warder said that he was mistaken. \"No, I am not,\" answered  Peace, \"I have not worked so long with wood without knowing the sound of  deals; and they don't have deals inside a prison for anything else than  scaffolds.\" But the noise, he said, did not disturb him in the least, as  he was quite prepared to meet his fate. He would like to have seen his  grave and coffin; he knew that his body would be treated with scant  ceremony after his death. But what of that? By that time his soul would  be in Heaven. He was pleased that one sinner who had seen him on his way  from Pentonville to Sheffield, had written to tell him that the sight of  the convict had brought home to him the sins of his own past life, and  by this means he had found salvation.    The time had come to say good-bye for the last time. Peace asked his  weeping relatives whether they had anything more that they wished to ask  him. Mrs. Peace reminded him that he had promised to pray with them  at the last. Peace, ever ready, knelt with them and prayed for half an  hour. He then shook hands with them, prayed for and blessed each one  singly, and himself gave way to tears as they left his presence. To his  wife as she departed Peace gave a funeral card of his own designing. It  ran:         In       Memory       of       Charles Peace       Who was executed in       Armley Prison       "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/448"],[0,"The Psychology of Revolution (#15)"],[1,"revolution nothing  restrains them, and they can easily gratify their instincts to  murder and plunder.  In the dregs of society the revolutionaries  of all times are sure of finding recruits.  Eager only to kill  and to plunder, little matters to them the cause they are  sworn to defend.  If the chances of murder and pillage are better  in the party attacked, they will promptly change their colours.    To these criminals, properly so called, the incurable plague of  all societies, we must add the class of semi-criminals.  Wrongdoers on occasion, they never rebel so long as the fear of  the established order restrains them, but as soon as it weakens  they enrol themselves in the army of revolution.    These two categories--habitual and occasional criminals--form an  army of disorder which is fit for nothing but the creation of  disorder.  All the revolutionaries, all the founders of religious  or political leagues, have constantly counted on their support.    We have already stated that this population, with its criminal  mentality, exercised a considerable influence during the French  Revolution.  It always figured in the front rank of the riots  which occurred almost daily.  Certain historians have spoken with  respect and emotion of the way in which the sovereign people  enforced its will upon the Convention, invading the hall armed  with pikes, the points of which were sometimes decorated with  newly severed heads.  If we analyse the elements composing the  pretended delegations of the sovereign people, we shall find  that, apart from a small number of simple souls who submitted to  the impulses of the leaders, the mass was almost entirely formed  of the bandits of whom I have been speaking.  To them were due  the innumerable murders of which the massacres of September and  the killing of the Princesse de Lamballe were merely typical.    They terrorised all the great Assemblies, from the Constituent  Assembly to the Convention, and for ten years they helped to  ravage France.  If by some miracle this army of criminals could  have been eliminated, the progress of the Revolution would have  been very different.  They stained it with blood from its dawn to  its decline.  Reason could do nothing with them but they could do  much against reason.        CHAPTER IV    THE PSYCHOLOGY OF REVOLUTIONARY CROWDS    1.  General Characteristics of the Crowd.    Whatever their origin, revolutions do not produce their full  effects until they have penetrated the soul of the multitude.  They therefore represent a consequence of the psychology of  crowds.    Although I have studied collective psychology at length in  another volume, I must here recall its principal laws.    Man, as part of a multitude, is a very different being from the  same man as an isolated individual.  His conscious individuality  vanishes in the unconscious personality of the crowd.    Material contact is not absolutely necessary to produce in the  individual the mentality of the crowd.  Common passions and  sentiments, provoked by certain events, are often sufficient to  create it.    The collective mind, momentarily formed, represents a very  special kind of aggregate.  Its chief peculiarity is that it is  entirely dominated by unconscious elements, and is subject to a  peculiar collective logic.    Among the other characteristics of crowds, we must note their  infinite credulity and exaggerated sensibility, their short-  sightedness, and their incapacity to respond to the influences of  reason.  Affirmation, contagion, repetition, and prestige  constitute almost the only means of persuading them.  Reality and  experience have no effect upon them.  The multitude will admit  anything; nothing is impossible in the eyes of the crowd.    By reason of the extreme sensibility of crowds, their sentiments,  good or bad, are always exaggerated.  This exaggeration increases  still further in times of revolution.  The least excitement will  then lead the multitude to act with the utmost fury.  Their  credulity, so great even in the normal state, is still further  increased; the most improbable statements are accepted.  Arthur  Young relates that when he visited the springs near Clermont, at  the time of the French Revolution, his guide was stopped by the  people, who were persuaded that he had come by order of the Queen  to mine and blow up the town.  The most horrible tales concerning  the Royal Family were circulated, depicting it as a nest of  ghouls and vampires.    These various characteristics show that man in the crowd descends  to a very low degree in the scale of civilisation.  He becomes a  savage, with all a savage's faults and qualities, with all his  momentary violence, enthusiasm, and heroism.  In the intellectual  domain a crowd is always inferior to the isolated unit.  In the  moral and sentimental domain it may be his superior.  A crowd  will commit a crime as readily as an act of abnegation.    Personal characteristics vanish in the crowd, which exerts an  extraordinary influence upon the individuals which form it.  The  miser becomes generous, the sceptic a believer, the honest  man a criminal, the coward a hero.  Examples of such  transformations abounded during the great Revolution.    As part of a jury or a parliament, the collective man renders  verdicts or passes laws of which he would never have dreamed in  his isolated condition.    One of the most notable consequences of the influence of a  collectivity upon the individuals who compose it is the  unification of their sentiments and wills.  This psychological  unity confers a remarkable force upon crowds.    The formation of such a mental unity results chiefly from the  fact that in a crowd gestures and actions are extremely  contagious.  Acclamations of hatred, fury, or love are  immediately approved and repeated.    What is the origin of these common sentiments, this common will?  They are propagated by contagion, but a point of departure is  necessary before this contagion can take effect.  Without a  leader the crowd is an amorphous entity incapable of action.    A knowledge of the laws relating to the psychology of crowds is  indispensable to the interpretation of the elements of our  Revolution, and to a comprehension of the conduct of  revolutionary assemblies, and the singular transformations of the  individuals who form part of them.  Pushed by the unconscious  forces of the collective soul, they more often than not say what  they did not intend, and vote what they would not have wished to  vote.    Although the laws of collective psychology have sometimes been  divined instinctively by superior statesmen, the majority of  Governments have not understood and do not understand  them.  It is because they do not understand them that so many of  them have fallen so easily.  When we see the facility with which  certain Governments were overthrown by an insignificant riot--as  happened in the case of the monarchy of Louis-Philippe--the  dangers of an ignorance of collective psychology are evident.  The marshal in command of the troops in 1848, which were more  than sufficient to defend the king, certainly did not understand  that the moment he allowed the crowd to mingle with the troops  the latter, paralysed by suggestion and contagion, would cease to  do their duty.  Neither did he know that as the multitude is  extremely sensible to prestige it needs a great display of force  to impress it, and that such a display will at once suppress  hostile demonstrations.  He was equally ignorant of the fact that  all gatherings should be dispersed immediately.  All these things  have been taught by experience, but in 1848 these lessons had not  been grasped.  At the time of the great Revolution the psychology  of crowds was even less understood.      2.  How the Stability of the Racial Mind limits the Oscillations  of the Mind of the Crowd.      A people can in a sense be likened to a crowd.  It possesses  certain characteristics, but the oscillations of these  characteristics are limited by the soul or mind of the race.  The  mind of the race has a fixity unknown to the transitory mind of  the crowd.    When a people possesses an ancestral soul established by a long  past the soul of the crowd is always dominated thereby.    A people differs from a crowd also in that it is composed of a  collection of groups, each having different interests and  passions.  In a crowd properly so-called--a popular assembly, for  example--there are unities which may belong to very different  social categories.    A people sometimes seems as mobile as a crowd, but we must not  forget that behind its mobility, its enthusiasms, its violence  and destructiveness, the extremely tenacious and conservative  instincts of the racial mind persist.  The history of the  Revolution and the century which has followed shows how the  conservative spirit finally overcomes the spirit of destruction.  More than one system of government which the people has shattered  has been restored by the people.    It is not as easy to work upon the mind of the people--that is,  the mind of the race--as on the mind of a crowd.  The means of  action are indirect and slower (journals, conferences, speeches,  books, &c.).  The elements of persuasion always come under the  headings already given: affirmation, repetition, prestige, and  contagion.    Mental contagion may affect a whole people instantaneously, but  more often it operates slowly, creeping from group to group.  Thus was the Reformation propagated in France.    A people is far less excitable than a crowd; but certain events--  national insults, threats of invasion, &c.--may arouse it  instantly.  Such a phenomenon was observed on several occasions  during the Revolution, notably at the time of the insolent  manifesto issued by the Duke of Brunswick.  The Duke knew little  indeed of the psychology of the French race when he  proffered his threats.  Not only did he considerably "]]]
