The comparison will be made on  the healthfulness of constituents in combination, and the chemical  changes they undergo in baking. This is a progressive age. The people  want facts, and they will form their own theories. Will the reader  believe that in the reign of Henry VIII. of England, a citizen  of London was executed for burning coal, which was then a capital  offense? A pope about the same time issued a Bull excommunicating all  Catholics who used tobacco, calling it the devil's weed. To-day coals  still burn, and tobacco solaces millions of the civilized world. If  the Royal Baking Powder Company (what a misnomer) possessed royal  prerogatives, the advocates of exsiccated alum would fare no better  than they did under the sumptuary laws of England. Professor Mott has  fulminated _ex cathedra_ his blast, but we survive. \"Truth is a torch,  the more 'tis shook it shines.\" Our strength is in the intelligence of  the age.

The _College Quarterly_ says that experiments made at the Iowa  Agricultural College show that the popular notion that the trunks  of trees elongate is entirely erroneous. Tacks were driven into the  trunks of various trees, and the distance between them accurately  measured. At the end of the season they were found to have neither  increased nor decreased their distances. In the experiment, tree  trunks were selected of all ages, from one year up to five or six, and  in no case was there any change whatever noticeable.           *       *       *       *       *          ASTRONOMICAL NOTES.

Under the name of sympathetic inks are designated certain liquids  which, being used for writing, leave no visible traces on the paper,  but which, through the agency of heat, or by the action of chemicals,  are made to appear in various colors. The use of such means for secret  correspondence is very ancient. Ovid, Pliny, and other Roman writers  speak of an ink of this kind, which, however, was nothing more than  fresh milk. It merely sufficed to dust powdered charcoal over the  surface of the paper upon which characters had been traced with the  colorless fluid, when the black powder adhered only to those places  where the fatty matter of the milk had spread. Such a process,  however, was merely mechanical, and the results very crude.    A great number of sympathetic inks may be obtained by means of  reactions known to chemistry. For instance, write on paper with a  colorless solution of sugar of lead; if the water that is used for the  solution be pure, no trace of the writing will remain when it becomes  dry. Now hold the paper over a jet of sulphureted hydrogen, and the  characters will immediately appear on the paper, of an intense black  color. The following recipes for inks of this kind are more simple:  If writing be executed with a dilute solution of sulphate of iron, the  invisible characters will appear of a beautiful blue, if the dry paper  be brushed over with a pencil full of a solution of yellow prussiate  of potash; or they will be black, if a solution of tannin be  substituted for the prussiate. If the characters be written with  a solution of sulphate of copper, they will at once turn blue on  exposing to the vapors of ammonia. Another sympathetic ink is afforded  by chloride of gold, which becomes of a reddish purple when acted upon  by a salt of tin. A red sympathetic ink may be made in the following  manner: Write with a very dilute solution of perchloride of iron--so  dilute, indeed, that the writing will be invisible when dry. By  holding the paper in the vapor arising from a long-necked glass  flask containing sulphuric acid and a few drops of a solution of  sulpho-cyanide of potassium, the characters will appear of a blood-red  color, which will again disappear on submitting them to the vapors of  caustic ammonia. This experiment can be repeated _ad infinitum_.    During the war in India, some years ago, important correspondence  was carried on by the English by means of the use of rice water as a  writing fluid. On the application of iodine the dispatches immediately  appeared in blue characters.    Sympathetic inks which are developed under the influence of heat only  are much easier to use than the foregoing. The liquids which possess  such a property are very numerous. Almost every one perhaps knows that  if writing be executed on paper with a clean quill pen dipped in onion  or turnip juice, it becomes absolutely invisible when dry; and that  when the paper is heated the writing at once makes its appearance  in characters of a brown color. All albuminoid, mucilaginous, and  saccharine vegetable juices make excellent sympathetic inks; we may  cite, as among the best, the juices of lemon, orange, apple, and pear.  A dilute solution of chloride of copper used for writing is invisible  until the paper is heated, when the letters are seen of a beautiful  yellow, disappearing again when the heat that developed them is  removed. The salts of cobalt, as the acetate, nitrate, sulphate, and  chloride, possess a like property. When a dilute solution of these  salts is used as an ink, the writing, although invisible when dry,  becomes blue when exposed to heat. The addition of chloride of iron,  or of a salt of nickel, renders them green, and this opens the way for  a very pretty experiment: If a winter landscape be drawn in India ink,  and the sky be painted with a wash of cobalt alone, and the branches  of the trees be clothed with leaves executed with a mixture of cobalt  and nickel, and the snow-clad earth be washed over with the same  mixture, a magic transformation at once takes place on the application  of heat, the winter landscape changing to a summer scene.    There is a well known proprietary article sold in Paris under the  name of _\"Encre pour les Dames\"_ (ink for ladies). Hager, in a recent  scientific journal, states that this consists of an aqueous solution  of iodide of starch, and is \"specially intended for love letters.\" In  four weeks characters written with it disappear, preventing all abuse  of letters, and doing away with all documentary evidence of any kind  in the hands of the recipient. The signers of bills of exchange who  use this ink are of course freed from all obligations in the same  length of time.           *       *       *       *       *          NEW WIRE CLOTHING FOR BURRING CYLINDERS.      Heretofore two kinds of clothing for cylinders for treating fibrous  material have been employed, one consisting of a set of serrated rings  cut from sheet steel and secured to the periphery of the cylinder, and  the other consisting of flat serrated iron wire. The serrated rings,  of necessity, entail a great loss of material in their manufacture,  and the iron wire clothing is so soft that it soon wears out or  becomes dull, necessitating the reclothing or sharpening of the  cylinder.    [Illustration: NEW WIRE CLOTHING FOR BURRING CYLINDERS.]    Our engraving represents a new form of steel wire clothing for such  cylinders, which was recently patented by Mr. Frank P. Pendleton, of  Philadelphia, Pa.    The improvement consists in notching or nicking the base of the teeth  or back of the wire, so as to admit of bending the wire around the  cylinders without breaking.           *       *       *       *       *          PETROLEUM AND GOLD.
