Dear Huldah,--from the end of one  summer to the beginning of the next, Joe Winter does not go home to his  dinner; and what you experience to-day, so far as absence from your  husband goes, is what his wife experiences in Boston ten months, save  Sundays, in every year.    I do not mean that Huldah winced or whined. Not she. Only she did think  \"if.\" Then she sat in front of the stove and watched the coals, and for  a little while continued to think \"if.\" Not long. Very soon she was  engaged in planning how she would arrange the table to-morrow,--whether  Mother Stevens should cut the chicken-pie, or whether she would have  that in front of her own mother. Then she fell to planning what she  would make for Cynthia's baby,--and then to wondering whether Cephas was  in earnest in that half nonsense he wrote about Sibyl Dyer,--and then  the clock struck six!    No bells yet,--no husband,--no anybody. Lantern out and lighted. Rubber  boots on, hood and sack. Shed-shovel in one hand, lantern in the other.  Roadway still bare, but a drift as high as Huldah's shoulders at the  barn door. Lantern on the ground; snow-shovel in both hands now. One,  two, three!--one cubic foot out. One, two, three!--another cubic foot  out. And so on, and so on, and so on, till the doorway is clear again.  Lantern in one hand, snow-shovel in the other, we enter the barn, draw  the water for cows and oxen,--we shake down more hay, and see to the  pigs again. This time we make beds of straw for the horses and the  cattle. Nay, we linger a minute or two, for there is something  companionable there. Then we shut them in, in the dark, and cross the  well-cleared roadway to the shed, and so home again. Certainly Mrs.  Empson's kerosene lamp is in her window. That must be her light which  gives a little halo in that direction in the falling snow. That looks  like society.    And this time Huldah undresses the baby, puts on her yellow flannel  night-gown,--makes the whole as long as it may be,--and then, still  making believe be jolly, lights another lamp, eats her own supper,  clears it away, and cuts into the new Harper which John had brought up  to her the day before.    But the Harper is dull reading to her, though generally so attractive.  And when her Plymouth-Hollow clock consents to strike eight at last,  Huldah, who has stinted herself to read till eight, gladly puts down the  \"Travels in Arizona,\" which seem to her as much like the \"Travels in  Peru,\" of the month before, as those had seemed like the \"Travels in  Chinchilla.\" Rubber boots again,--lantern again,--sack and hood again.  The men will be in no case for milking when they come. So Huldah brings  together their pails,--takes her shovel once more and her lantern,--digs  out the barn drift again, and goes over to milk little Carry and big  Fanchon. For, though the milking of a hundred cows passes under those  roofs and out again every day, Huldah is far too conservative to abandon  the custom which she inherits from some Thorfinn or some Elfrida, and  her husband is well pleased to humor her in keeping in that barn always,  at least two of the choicest three-quarter blood cows that he can  choose, for the family supply. Only, in general, he or Reuben milks  them; as duties are divided there, this is not Huldah's share. But on  this eve of St. Spiridion the gentle creatures were glad when she came  in; and in two journeys back and forth Huldah had carried her  well-filled pails into her dairy. This helped along the hour, and just  after nine o'clock struck, she could hear the cheers of the men at last.  She ran out again with the ready lighted lantern to the shed-door,--in  an instant had on her boots and sack and hood, had crossed to the barn,  and slid open the great barn door,--and stood there with her  light,--another Hero for another Leander to buffet towards, through the  snow. A sight to see were the two men, to be sure! And a story, indeed,  they had to tell! On their different beats they had fought snow all day,  had been breaking roads with the help of the farmers where they could,  had had to give up more than half of the outlying farms, sending such  messages as they might, that the outlying farmers might bring down  to-morrow's milk to such stations as they could arrange, and, at last,  by good luck, had both met at the depot in the hollow, where each had  gone to learn at what hour the milk-train might be expected in the  morning. Little reason was there, indeed, to expect it at all. Nothing  had passed the station-master since the morning express, called  lightning by satire, had slowly pushed up with three or four engines  five hours behind its time, and just now had come down a messenger from  them that he should telegraph to Boston that they were all blocked up at  Tyler's Summit,--the snow drifting beneath their wheels faster than they  could clear it. Above, the station-master said, nothing whatever had yet  passed Winchendon. Five engines had gone out from Fitchburg eastward,  but in the whole day they had not come as far as Leominster. It was very  clear that no milk-train nor any other train would be on time the next  morning.    Such was, in brief, John's report to Huldah, when they had got to that  state of things in which a man can make a report; that is, after they  had rubbed dry the horses, had locked up the barn, after the men had  rubbed themselves dry, and had put on dry clothing, and after each of  them, sitting on the fire side of the table, had drunk his first cup of  tea, and eaten his first square cubit of dipped-toast. After the  dipped-toast, they were going to begin on Huldah's fried potatoes and  sausages.    Huldah heard their stories with all their infinite little details; knew  every corner and turn by which they had husbanded strength and life; was  grateful to the Corbetts and Varnums and Prescotts and the rest, who,  with their oxen and their red right hands, had given such loyal help for  the common good; and she heaved a deep sigh when the story ended with  the verdict of the failure of the whole,--\"No trains on time to-morrow.\"    \"Bad for the Boston babies,\" said Reuben bluntly, giving words to what  the others were feeling. \"Poor little things!\" said Huldah, \"Alice has  been so pretty all day.\" And she gulped down just one more sigh,  disgusted with herself, as she remembered that \"if\" of the  afternoon,--\"if John had only gone into partnership with Joe Winter.\"      IV.    HOW THEY BROKE THE BLOCKADE.    Three o'clock in the morning saw Huldah's fire burning in the stove, her  water boiling in the kettle, her slices of ham broiling on the gridiron,  and quarter-past three saw the men come across from the barn, where they  had been shaking down hay for the cows and horses, and yoking the oxen  for the terrible onset of the day. It was bright star-light  above,--thank Heaven for that. This strip of three hundred thousand  square miles of snow cloud, which had been drifting steadily cast over a  continent, was, it seemed, only twenty hours wide,--say two hundred  miles, more or less,--and at about midnight its last flecks had fallen,  and all the heaven was washed black and clear. The men were well rested  by those five hours of hard sleep. They were fitly dressed for their  great encounter and started cheerily upon it, as men who meant to do  their duty, and to both of whom, indeed, the thought had come, that life  and death might be trembling in their hands. They did not take out the  pungs to-day, nor, of course, the horses. Such milk as they had  collected on St. Victoria's day they had stored already at the station,  and at Stacy's; and the best they could do to-day would be to break open  the road from the Four Corners to the station, that they might place as  many cans as possible there before the down-train came. From the house,  then, they had only to drive down their oxen that they might work with  the other teams from the Four Corners; and it was only by begging him,  that Huldah persuaded Reuben to take one lunch-can for them both. Then,  as Reuben left the door, leaving John to kiss her \"good-by,\" and to tell  her not to be alarmed if they did not come home at night,--she gave to  John the full milk-can into which she had poured every drop of Carry's  milk, and said, \"It will be one more; and God knows what child may be  crying for it now.\"    So they parted for eight and twenty hours; and in place of Huldah's  first state party of both families, she and Alice reigned solitary that  day, and held their little court with never a suitor. And when her  lunch-time came, Huldah looked half-mournfully, half-merrily, on her  array of dainties prepared for the feast, and she would not touch one of  them. She toasted some bread before the fire, made a cup of tea, boiled  an egg, and would not so much as set the table. As has been before  stated, this is the way with women.    And of the men, who shall tell the story of the pluck and endurance, of  the unfailing good-will, of the resource in strange emergency, of the  mutual help and common courage with which all the men worked that day  on that well-nigh hopeless task of breaking open the highway from the  Corners to the station? Well-nigh hopeless, indeed; for although at  first, with fresh cattle and united effort, they made in the hours,  which passed so quickly up to ten o'clock, near two miles headway, and  had brought yesterday's milk thus far,--more than half way to their  point of delivery,--at ten o'clock it was quite evident that this sharp  northwest wind, which told so heavily on the oxen and even on the men,  was filling in the very roadway they had opened, and so was cutting"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32530"],[0,"Armageddon—2419 A.D. (#15)"],[1,"  swinging below the swoopers, or stringing out behind them.    There would be nothing tiring about this, because the strain would be no  greater than that of carrying a one or two pound weight in the hand,  except for air friction at high speeds. But to make doubly sure that we  should lose none of our personnel, I gave strict orders that the belts  and tow lines should be equipped with rings and hooks.    So great was the efficiency of the fundamental organization and  discipline of the Gang, that we got under way at nightfall.    One by one the swoopers eased into the air, each followed by its long  train or \"kite-tail\" of humanity and supply cases hanging lightly from  its tow line. For convenience, the tow lines were made of an alloy of  ultron which, unlike the metal itself, is visible.    At first these \"tails\" hung downward, but as the ships swung into  formation and headed eastward toward the Bad Blood territory, gathering  speed, they began to string out behind. And swinging low from each ship  on heavily weighted lines, ultroscope, ultrophone, and straight-vision  observers keenly scanned the countryside, while intelligence men in the  swoopers above bent over their instrument boards and viewplates.    Leaving Control Boss Ned Garlin temporarily in charge of affairs, Wilma  and I dropped a weighted line from our ship, and slid down about half  way to the under lookouts, that is to say, about a thousand feet. The  sensation of floating swiftly through the air like this, in the absolute  security of one's confidence in the inertron belt, was one of  never-ending delight to me.    We reascended into the swooper as the expedition approached the  territory of the Bad Bloods, and directed the preparations for the  bombardment. It was part of my plan to appear to carry out the attack as  originally planned.    About fifteen miles from their camps our ships came to a halt and  maintained their positions for a while with the idling blasts of their  rocket motors, to give the ultroscope operators a chance to make a  thorough examination of the territory below us, for it was very  important that this next step in our program should be carried out with  all secrecy.    At length they reported the ground below us entirely clear of any  appearance of human occupation, and a gun unit of long-range specialists  was lowered with a dozen rocket guns, equipped with special automatic  devices that the Resources Division had developed at my request, a few  hours before our departure. These were aiming and timing devices. After  calculating the range, elevation and rocket charges carefully, the guns  were left, concealed in a ravine, and the men were hauled up into the  ship again. At the predetermined hour, those unmanned rocket guns would  begin automatically to bombard the Bad Bloods' hillsides, shifting their  aim and elevation slightly with each shot, as did many of our artillery  pieces in the First World War.    In the meantime, we turned south about twenty miles, and grounded,  waiting for the bombardment to begin before we attempted to sneak across  the Han ship lane. I was relying for security on the distraction that  the bombardment might furnish the Han observers.    It was tense work waiting, but the affair went through as planned, our  squadron drifting across the route high enough to enable the ships'  tails of troops and supply cases to clear the ground.    In crossing the second ship route, out along the Beaches of Jersey, we  were not so successful in escaping observation. A Han ship came speeding  along at a very low elevation. We caught it on our electronic location  and direction finders, and also located it with our ultroscopes, but it  came so fast and so low that I thought it best to remain where we had  grounded the second time, and lie quiet, rather than get under way and  cross in front of it.    The point was this. While the Hans had no such devices as our  ultroscopes, with which we could see in the dark (within certain  limitations of course), and their electronic instruments would be  virtually useless in uncovering our presence, since all but natural  electronic activities were carefully eliminated from our apparatus,  except electrophone receivers (which are not easily spotted), the Hans  did have some very highly sensitive sound devices which operated with  great efficiency in calm weather, so far as sounds emanating from the  air were concerned. But the \"ground roar\" greatly confused their use of  these instruments in the location of specific sounds floating up from  the surface of the earth.    This ship must have caught some slight noise of ours, however, in its  sensitive instruments, for we heard its electronic devices go into play,  and picked up the routine report of the noise to its Base Ship  Commander. But from the nature of the conversation, I judged they had  not identified it, and were, in fact, more curious about the detonations  they were picking up now from the Bad Blood lands some sixty miles or so  to the west.    Immediately after this ship had shot by, we took the air again, and  following much the same route that I had taken the previous night,  climbed in a long semi-circle out over the ocean, swung toward the north  and finally the west. We set our course, however, for the Sinsings' land  north of Nu-yok, instead of for the city itself.          CHAPTER XII    The Finger of Doom      As we crossed the Hudson River, a few miles north of the city, we  dropped several units of the Yellow Intelligence Division, with full  instrumental equipment. Their apparatus cases were nicely balanced at  only a few ounces weight each, and the men used their chute capes to  ease their drops.    We recrossed the river a little distance above and began dropping White  Intelligence units and a few long and short range gun units. Then we  held our position until we began to get reports. Gradually we ringed the  territory of the Sinsings, our observation units working busily and  patiently at their locators and scopes, both aloft and aground, until  Garlin finally turned to me with the remark:    \"The map circle is complete now, Boss. We've got clear locations all the  way around them.\"    \"Let me see it,\" I replied, and studied the illuminated viewplate map,  with its little overlapping circles of light that indicated spots proved  clear of the enemy by ultroscopic observation.    I nodded to Bill Hearn. \"Go ahead now, Hearn,\" I said, \"and place your  barrage men.\"    He spoke into his ultrophone, and three of the ships began to glide in a  wide ring around the enemy territory. Every few seconds, at the word  from his Unit Boss, a gunner would drop off the wire, and slipping the  clasp of his chute cape, drift down into the darkness below.    Bill formed two lines, parallel to and facing the river, and enclosing  the entire territory of the enemy between them. Above and below,  straddling the river, were two defensive lines. These latter were merely  to hold their positions. The others were to close in toward each other,  pushing a high-explosive barrage five miles ahead of them. When the two  barrages met, both lines were to switch to short-vision-range barrage  and continue to close in on any of the enemy who might have drifted  through the previous curtain of fire.    In the meantime Bill kept his reserves, a picked corps of a hundred men  (the same that had accompanied Hart and myself in our fight with the Han  squadron) in the air, divided about equally among the \"kite-tails\" of  four ships.    A final roll call, by units, companies, divisions and functions,  established the fact that all our forces were in position. No Han  activity was reported, and no Han broadcasts indicated any suspicion of  our expedition. Nor was there any indication that the Sinsings had any  knowledge of the fate in store for them. The idling of rep-ray  generators was reported from the center of their camp, obviously those  of the ships the Hans had given them--the price of their treason to  their race.    Again I gave the word, and Hearn passed on the order to his  subordinates.    Far below us, and several miles to the right and left, the two barrage  lines made their appearance. From the great height to which we had  risen, they appeared like lines of brilliant, winking lights, and the  detonations were muffled by the distances into a sort of rumbling,  distant thunder. Hearn and his assistants were very busy: measuring,  calculating, and snapping out ultrophone orders to unit commanders that  resulted in the straightening of lines and the closing of gaps in the  barrage.    The White Division Boss reported the utmost confusion in the Sinsing  organization. They were, as might be expected, an inefficient, loosely  disciplined gang, and repeated broadcasts for help to neighboring gangs.  Ignoring the fact that the Mongolians had not used explosives for many  generations, they nevertheless jumped at the conclusion that they were  being raided by the Hans. Their frantic broadcasts persisted in this  thought, despite the nervous electrophonic inquiries of the Hans  themselves, to whom the sound of the battle was evidently audible, and  who were trying to locate the trouble.    At this point, the swooper I had sent south toward the city went into  action as a diversion, to keep the Hans at home. Its \"kite-tail\" loaded  with long-range gunners, using the most highly explosive rockets we had,  hung invisible in the darkness of the sky and bombarded the city from a  distance of about five miles. With an entire city to shoot at, and the  object of creating as much commotion therein as possible, regardless of  actual damage, the gunners had no difficulty in hitting the mark. I  could see the glow of the city and the stabbing flashes of exploding  rockets. In the end, the Hans, uncertain as to what was going on, fell  back on a defensive policy, and shot their \"hell cylinder,\" or wall of  upturned disintegrator "]]]
