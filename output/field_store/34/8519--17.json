Of course we were a little way off, for      though the Spear of Ivan is in deep water, one has to be careful of      currents, for it is in just such places that the dangerous currents      run.\"  The agent of Lloyd's told me only a few weeks ago that it was      only after a prolonged investigation of the tidal and sea currents      that the house decided to except from ordinary sea risks losses due      to a too close course by the Spear of Ivan.  When I tried to get a      little more definite account of the coffin-boat and the dead lady      that is given in _The Journal of Occultism_ he simply shrugged his      shoulders.  \"Signor, it is all,\" he said.  \"That Englishman wrote      everything after endless questioning.\"        So you see, my dear, that our new home is not without superstitious      interests of its own.  It is rather a nice idea, is it not, to have a      dead woman cruising round our promontory in a coffin?  I doubt if      even at Croom you can beat that.  \"Makes the place kind of homey,\" as      an American would say.  When you come, Aunt Janet, you will not feel      lonesome, at any rate, and it will save us the trouble of importing      some of your Highland ghosts to make you feel at home in the new      land.  I don't know, but we might ask the stiff to come to tea with      us.  Of course, it would be a late tea.  Somewhere between midnight      and cock-crow would be about the etiquette of the thing, I fancy!        But I must tell you all the realities of the Castle and around it.      So I will write again within a day or two, and try to let you know      enough to prepare you for coming here.  Till then adieu, my dear.                                                                   Your loving                                                                     RUPERT.    _From Rupert Sent Leger_, _Vissarion_, _to Janet MacKelpie_, _Croom_.                                                           _January_ 25, 1907.        I hope I did not frighten you, dear Aunt Janet, by the yarn of the      lady in the coffin.  But I know you are not afraid; you have told me      too many weird stories for me to dread that.  Besides, you have      Second Sight--latent, at all events.  However, there won't be any      more ghosts, or about ghosts, in this letter.  I want to tell you all      about our new home.  I am so glad you are coming out so soon; I am      beginning to feel so lonesome--I walk about sometimes aimlessly, and      find my thoughts drifting in such an odd way.  If I didn't know      better, I might begin to think I was in love!  There is no one here      to be in love with; so make your mind easy, Aunt Janet.  Not that you      would be unhappy, I know, dear, if I _did_ fall in love.  I suppose I      must marry some day.  It is a duty now, I know, when there is such an      estate as Uncle Roger has left me.  And I know this: I shall never      marry any woman unless I love her.  And I am right sure that if I do      love her you will love her, too, Aunt Janet!  Won't you, dear?  It      wouldn't be half a delight if you didn't.  It won't if you don't.      There, now!        But before I begin to describe Vissarion I shall throw a sop to you      as a chatelaine; that may give you patience to read the rest.  The      Castle needs a lot of things to make it comfortable--as you would      consider it.  In fact, it is absolutely destitute of everything of a      domestic nature.  Uncle Roger had it vetted on the defence side, and      so far it could stand a siege.  But it couldn't cook a dinner or go      through a spring-cleaning!  As you know, I am not much up in domestic      matters, and so I cannot give you details; but you may take it that      it wants everything.  I don't mean furniture, or silver, or even      gold-plate, or works of art, for it is full of the most magnificent      old things that you can imagine.  I think Uncle Roger must have been      a collector, and gathered a lot of good things in all sorts of      places, stored them for years, and then sent them here.  But as to      glass, china, delft, all sorts of crockery, linen, household      appliances and machinery, cooking utensils--except of the      simplest--there are none.  I don't think Uncle Roger could have lived      here more than on a temporary picnic.  So far as I only am concerned,      I am all right; a gridiron and a saucepan are all _I_ want--and I can      use them myself.  But, dear Aunt Janet, I don't want you to pig it.      I would like you to have everything you can imagine, and all of the      very best.  Cost doesn't count now for us, thanks to Uncle Roger; and      so I want you to order all.  I know you, dear--being a woman--won't      object to shopping.  But it will have to be wholesale.  This is an      enormous place, and will swallow up all you can buy--like a      quicksand.  Do as you like about choosing, but get all the help you      can.  Don't be afraid of getting too much.  You can't, or of being      idle when you are here.  I assure you that when you come there will      be so much to do and so many things to think of that you will want to      get away from it all.  And, besides, Aunt Janet, I hope you won't be      too long.  Indeed, I don't wish to be selfish, but your boy is      lonely, and wants you.  And when you get here you will be an EMPRESS.      I don't altogether like doing so, lest I should offend a      millionairess like you; but it may facilitate matters, and the way's      of commerce are strict, though devious.  So I send you a cheque for      1,000 pounds for the little things: and a letter to the bank to      honour your own cheques for any amount I have got.        I think, by the way, I should, if I were you, take or send out a few      servants--not too many at first, only just enough to attend on our      two selves.  You can arrange to send for any more you may want later.      Engage them, and arrange for their being paid--when they are in our      service we must treat them well--and then they can be at our call as      you find that we want them.  I think you should secure, say, fifty or      a hundred--'tis an awfu' big place, Aunt Janet!  And in the same way      will you secure--and, of course, arrange for pay similarly--a hundred      men, exclusive of any servants you think it well to have.  I should      like the General, if he can give the time, to choose or pass them.  I      want clansmen that I can depend on, if need be.  We are going to live      in a country which is at present strange to us, and it is well to      look things in the face.  I know Sir Colin will only have men who are      a credit to Scotland and to Ross and to Croom--men who will impress      the Blue Mountaineers.  I know they will take them to their      hearts--certainly if any of them are bachelors the girls will!      Forgive me!  But if we are to settle here, our followers will      probably want to settle also.  Moreover, the Blue Mountaineers may      want followers also!  And will want them to settle, too, and have      successors!        Now for the description of the place.  Well, I simply can't just now.      It is all so wonderful and so beautiful.  The Castle--I have written      so much already about other things that I really must keep the Castle      for another letter!  Love to Sir Colin if he is at Croom.  And oh,      dear Aunt Janet, how I wish that my dear mother was coming out!  It      all seems so dark and empty without her.  How she would have enjoyed      it!  How proud she would have been!  And, my dear, if she could be      with us again, how grateful she would have been to you for all you      have done for her boy!  As I am, believe me, most truly and sincerely      and affectionately grateful.                                                                   Your loving                                                                     RUPERT.    _Rupert Sent Leger_, _Vissarion_, _to Janet MacKelpie_, _Croom_.                                                           _January_ 26, 1907.        MY DEAR AUNT JANET,        Please read this as if it was a part of the letter I wrote yesterday.        The Castle itself is so vast that I really can't describe it in      detail.  So I am waiting till you come; and then you and I will go      over it together and learn all that we can about it.  We shall take      Rooke with us, and, as he is supposed to know every part of it, from      the keep to the torture-chamber, we can spend a few days over it.  Of      course, I have been over most of it, since I came--that, is, I went      at various times to see different portions--the battlements, the      bastions, the old guard-room, the hall, the chapel, the walls, the      roof.  And I have been through some of the network of rock passages.      Uncle Roger must have spent a mint of money on it, so far as I can      see; and though I am not a soldier, I have been in so many places      fortified in different ways that I am not entirely ignorant of the      subject.  He has restored it in such an up-to-date way that it is      practically impregnable to anything under big guns or a siege-train.      He has gone so far as to have certain outworks and the keep covered      with armoured plating of what looks like harveyized steel.  You will      wonder when you see it.  But as yet I really know only a few rooms,      and am familiar with only one--my own room.  The drawing-room--not      the great hall, which is a vast place; the library--a magnificent      one, but in sad disorder--we must get a librarian some day to put it      in trim; and the drawing-room and boudoir and bedroom suite which I      have selected for you, are all fine.  But my own room is what suits      me best, though I do not think you would care for it for yourself.      If you do, you shall have it."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31"],[0,"Plays of Sophocles: Oedipus the King; Oedipus at Colonus; Antigone (#15)"],[1,"aid that sevenfold host  Of spearmen against Thebes, determining  To oust my foes or die in a just cause.  Why then, thou askest, am I here today?  Father, I come a suppliant to thee  Both for myself and my allies who now  With squadrons seven beneath their seven spears  Beleaguer all the plain that circles Thebes.  Foremost the peerless warrior, peerless seer,  Amphiaraiis with his lightning lance;  Next an Aetolian, Tydeus, Oeneus' son;  Eteoclus of Argive birth the third;  The fourth Hippomedon, sent to the war  By his sire Talaos; Capaneus, the fifth,  Vaunts he will fire and raze the town; the sixth  Parthenopaeus, an Arcadian born  Named of that maid, longtime a maid and late  Espoused, Atalanta's true-born child;  Last I thy son, or thine at least in name,  If but the bastard of an evil fate,  Lead against Thebes the fearless Argive host.  Thus by thy children and thy life, my sire,  We all adjure thee to remit thy wrath  And favor one who seeks a just revenge  Against a brother who has banned and robbed him.  For victory, if oracles speak true,  Will fall to those who have thee for ally.  So, by our fountains and familiar gods  I pray thee, yield and hear; a beggar I  And exile, thou an exile likewise; both  Involved in one misfortune find a home  As pensioners, while he, the lord of Thebes,  O agony! makes a mock of thee and me.  I'll scatter with a breath the upstart's might,  And bring thee home again and stablish thee,  And stablish, having cast him out, myself.  This will thy goodwill I will undertake,  Without it I can scare return alive.    CHORUS  For the king's sake who sent him, Oedipus,  Dismiss him not without a meet reply.    OEDIPUS  Nay, worthy seniors, but for Theseus' sake  Who sent him hither to have word of me.  Never again would he have heard my voice;  But now he shall obtain this parting grace,  An answer that will bring him little joy.  O villain, when thou hadst the sovereignty  That now thy brother holdeth in thy stead,  Didst thou not drive me, thine own father, out,  An exile, cityless, and make we wear  This beggar's garb thou weepest to behold,  Now thou art come thyself to my sad plight?  Nothing is here for tears; it must be borne  By _me_ till death, and I shall think of thee  As of my murderer; thou didst thrust me out;  'Tis thou hast made me conversant with woe,  Through thee I beg my bread in a strange land;  And had not these my daughters tended me  I had been dead for aught of aid from thee.  They tend me, they preserve me, they are men  Not women in true service to their sire;  But ye are bastards, and no sons of mine.  Therefore just Heaven hath an eye on thee;  Howbeit not yet with aspect so austere  As thou shalt soon experience, if indeed  These banded hosts are moving against Thebes.  That city thou canst never storm, but first  Shall fall, thou and thy brother, blood-imbrued.  Such curse I lately launched against you twain,  Such curse I now invoke to fight for me,  That ye may learn to honor those who bear thee  Nor flout a sightless father who begat  Degenerate sons--these maidens did not so.  Therefore my curse is stronger than thy \"throne,\"  Thy \"suppliance,\" if by right of laws eterne  Primeval Justice sits enthroned with Zeus.  Begone, abhorred, disowned, no son of mine,  Thou vilest of the vile! and take with thee  This curse I leave thee as my last bequest:--  Never to win by arms thy native land,  No, nor return to Argos in the Vale,  But by a kinsman's hand to die and slay  Him who expelled thee.  So I pray and call  On the ancestral gloom of Tartarus  To snatch thee hence, on these dread goddesses  I call, and Ares who incensed you both  To mortal enmity.  Go now proclaim  What thou hast heard to the Cadmeians all,  Thy staunch confederates--this the heritage  that Oedipus divideth to his sons.    CHORUS  Thy errand, Polyneices, liked me not  From the beginning; now go back with speed.    POLYNEICES  Woe worth my journey and my baffled hopes!  Woe worth my comrades!  What a desperate end  To that glad march from Argos!  Woe is me!  I dare not whisper it to my allies  Or turn them back, but mute must meet my doom.  My sisters, ye his daughters, ye have heard  The prayers of our stern father, if his curse  Should come to pass and ye some day return  To Thebes, O then disown me not, I pray,  But grant me burial and due funeral rites.  So shall the praise your filial care now wins  Be doubled for the service wrought for me.    ANTIGONE  One boon, O Polyneices, let me crave.    POLYNEICES  What would'st thou, sweet Antigone?  Say on.    ANTIGONE  Turn back thy host to Argos with all speed,  And ruin not thyself and Thebes as well.    POLYNEICES  That cannot be.  How could I lead again  An army that had seen their leader quail?    ANTIGONE  But, brother, why shouldst thou be wroth again?  What profit from thy country's ruin comes?    POLYNEICES  'Tis shame to live in exile, and shall I  The elder bear a younger brother's flouts?    ANTIGONE  Wilt thou then bring to pass his prophecies  Who threatens mutual slaughter to you both?    POLYNEICES  Aye, so he wishes:--but I must not yield.    ANTIGONE  O woe is me! but say, will any dare,  Hearing his prophecy, to follow thee?    POLYNEICES  I shall not tell it; a good general  Reports successes and conceals mishaps.    ANTIGONE  Misguided youth, thy purpose then stands fast!    POLYNEICES  'Tis so, and stay me not.  The road I choose,  Dogged by my sire and his avenging spirit,  Leads me to ruin; but for you may Zeus  Make your path bright if ye fulfill my hest  When dead; in life ye cannot serve me more.  Now let me go, farewell, a long farewell!  Ye ne'er shall see my living face again.    ANTIGONE  Ah me!    POLYNEICES            Bewail me not.    ANTIGONE                           Who would not mourn  Thee, brother, hurrying to an open pit!    POLYNEICES  If I must die, I must.    ANTIGONE                           Nay, hear me plead.    POLYNEICES  It may not be; forbear.    ANTIGONE                           Then woe is me,  If I must lose thee.    POLYNEICES                      Nay, that rests with fate,  Whether I live or die; but for you both  I pray to heaven ye may escape all ill;  For ye are blameless in the eyes of all.  [Exit POLYNEICES]    CHORUS  (Str. 1)       Ills on ills! no pause or rest!       Come they from our sightless guest?       Or haply now we see fulfilled       What fate long time hath willed?       For ne'er have I proved vain       Aught that the heavenly powers ordain.       Time with never sleeping eye       Watches what is writ on high,       Overthrowing now the great,       Raising now from low estate.  Hark!  How the thunder rumbles!  Zeus defend us!    OEDIPUS  Children, my children! will no messenger  Go summon hither Theseus my best friend?    ANTIGONE  And wherefore, father, dost thou summon him?    OEDIPUS  This winged thunder of the god must bear me  Anon to Hades.  Send and tarry not.    CHORUS  (Ant. 1)  Hark! with louder, nearer roar  The bolt of Zeus descends once more.  My spirit quails and cowers:  my hair  Bristles for fear.  Again that flare!  What doth the lightning-flash portend?  Ever it points to issues grave.  Dread powers of air!  Save, Zeus, O save!    OEDIPUS  Daughters, upon me the predestined end  Has come; no turning from it any more.    ANTIGONE  How knowest thou?  What sign convinces thee?    OEDIPUS  I know full well.  Let some one with all speed  Go summon hither the Athenian prince.    CHORUS  (Str. 2)  Ha! once more the deafening sound  Peals yet louder all around  If thou darkenest our land,  Lightly, lightly lay thy hand;  Grace, not anger, let me win,  If upon a man of sin  I have looked with pitying eye,  Zeus, our king, to thee I cry!    OEDIPUS  Is the prince coming?  Will he when he comes  Find me yet living and my senses clear!    ANTIGONE  What solemn charge would'st thou impress on him?    OEDIPUS  For all his benefits I would perform  The promise made when I received them first.    CHORUS  (Ant. 2)            Hither haste, my son, arise,            Altar leave and sacrifice,            If haply to Poseidon now            In the far glade thou pay'st thy vow.            For our guest to thee would bring            And thy folk and offering,            Thy due guerdon.  Haste, O King!  [Enter THESEUS]    THESEUS  Wherefore again this general din? at once  My people call me and the stranger calls.  Is it a thunderbolt of Zeus or sleet  Of arrowy hail? a storm so fierce as this  Would warrant all surmises of mischance.    OEDIPUS  Thou com'st much wished for, Prince, and sure some god  Hath bid good luck attend thee on thy way.    THESEUS  What, son of Laius, hath chanced of new?    OEDIPUS  My life hath turned the scale.  I would do all  I promised thee and thine before I die.    THESEUS  What sign assures thee that thine end is near?    OEDIPUS  The gods themselves are heralds of my fate;  Of their appointed warnings nothing fails.    THESEUS  How sayest thou they signify their will?    OEDIPUS  This thunder, peal on peal, this lightning hurled  Flash upon flash, from the unconquered hand.    THESEUS  I must believe thee, having found thee oft  A prophet true; then speak what must be done.    OEDIPUS  O son of Aegeus, for this state will I  Unfold a treasure age cannot corrupt.  Myself anon without a guiding hand  Will take thee to the spot where I must end.  This secret ne'er reveal to mortal man,  Neither the spot nor whereabouts it lies,  So shall it ever serve thee for defense  Better than native shields and near allies.  But those dread mysteries speech may not profane  Thyself shalt gather coming there alone;  Since not to any of thy subjects,  nor  To my own children, though I love them dearly,  Can I reveal what thou must guard alone,  And whisper to thy chosen heir alone,  So to be handed down from heir to heir.  Thus shalt thou hold this land inviolate  From the dread Dragon's brood. [7]  The justest State  By"]]]
