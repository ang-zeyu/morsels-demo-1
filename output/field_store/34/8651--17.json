It seems to me that Satan has burnt up the wheat.\"  And  Adam said to him, \"Yes.\"    10 Again Satan said to Adam, \"Come back with us; we are angels of God.  God sent us to you, to show you another field of corn, better than  that; and beyond it is a fountain of good water, and many trees, where  you shall live near it, and work the corn field to better purpose than  that which Satan has consumed.\"    11 Adam thought that he was true, and that they were angels who talked  with him; and he went back with them.    12 Then Satan began to lead astray Adam and Eve eight days, until they  both fell down as if dead, from hunger, thirst, and faintness.  Then he  fled with his hosts, and left them.          Chapter LXVIII - How destruction and trouble is of Satan when he is the  master.  Adam and Eve establish the custom of worship.    1 Then God looked at Adam and Eve, and at what had come over them from  Satan, and how he had made them perish.    2 God, therefore, sent His Word, and raised up Adam and Eve from their  state of death.    3 Then, Adam, when he was raised, said, \"O God, You have burnt and  taken from us the corn You have given us, and You have emptied out the  bucket of water.  And You have sent Your angels, who have caused us to  lose our way from the corn field.  Will You make us perish?  If this be  from you, O God, then take away our souls; but punish us not.\"    4 Then God said to Adam, \"I did not burn down the wheat, and I did not  pour the water out of the bucket, and I did not send My angels to lead  you astray.    5 But it is Satan, your master who did it; he to whom you have  subjected yourself; my commandment being meanwhile set aside.  He it  is, who burnt down the corn, and poured out the water, and who has led  you astray; and all the promises he has made you were just a trick, a  deception, and a lie.    6 But now, O Adam, you shall acknowledge My good deeds done to you.\"    7 And God told His angels to take Adam and Eve, and to bear them up to  the field of wheat, which they found as before, with the bucket full of  water.    8 There they saw a tree, and found on it solid manna; and wondered at  God's power.  And the angels commanded them to eat of the manna when  they were hungry.    9 And God admonished Satan with a curse, not to come again, and destroy  the field of corn.    10 Then Adam and Eve took of the corn, and made of it an offering, and  took it and offered it up on the mountain, the place where they had  offered up their first offering of blood.    11 And they offered this offering again on the altar they had built at  first.  And they stood up and prayed, and besought the Lord saying,  \"Thus, O God, when we were in the garden,  our praises went up to you,  like this offering; and our innocence went up to you like incense.  But  now, O God, accept this offering from us, and don't turn us away,  deprived of Your mercy.\"    12 Then God said to Adam and Eve, \"Since you have made this offering  and have offered it to Me, I shall make it My flesh, when I come down  on earth to save you; and I shall cause it to be offered continually on  an altar, for forgiveness and for mercy, for those who partake of it  duly.\"    13 And God sent a bright fire over the offering of Adam and Eve, and  filled it with brightness, grace, and light; and the Holy Ghost came  down on that offering.    14 Then God commanded an angel to take fire tongs, like a spoon, and  with it to take an offering and bring it to Adam and Eve.  And the  angel did so, as God had commanded him, and offered it to them.    15 And the souls of Adam and Eve were brightened, and their hearts were  filled with joy and gladness and with the praises of God.    16 And God said to Adam, \"This shall be to  you a custom, to do so,  when affliction and sorrow come over you.  But your deliverance and  your entrance in to the garden, shall not be until the days are  fulfilled as agreed between you and Me; were it not so, I would, of My  mercy and pity for you, bring you back to My garden and to My favor for  the sake of the offering you have just made to My name.\"    17 Adam rejoiced at these words which he heard from God; and he and Eve  worshipped before the altar, to which they bowed, and then went back to  the Cave of Treasures.    18 And this took place at the end of the twelfth day after the  eightieth day, from the time Adam and Eve came out of the garden.    19 And they stood up the whole night praying until morning; and then  went out of the cave.    20 Then Adam said to Eve, with joy of heart, because of the offering  they had made to God, and that had been accepted of Him, \"Let us do  this three times every week, on the fourth day Wednesday, on the  preparation day Friday, and on the Sabbath Sunday, all the days of our  life.\"    21 And as they agreed to these words between themselves, God was  pleased with their thoughts, and with the resolution they had each  taken with the other.    22 After this, came the Word of God to Adam, and said, \"O Adam, you  have determined beforehand the days in which sufferings shall come over  Me, when I am made flesh; for they are the fourth Wednesday, and the  preparation day Friday.    23 But as to the first day, I created in it all things, and I raised  the heavens.  And, again, through My rising again on this day, will I  create joy, and raise them on high, who believe in Me; O Adam, offer  this offering, all the days of your life.\"    24 Then God withdrew His Word from Adam.    25 But Adam continued to offer this offering thus, every week three  times, until the end of seven weeks.  And on the first day, which is  the fiftieth, Adam made an offering as he was accustomed, and he and  Eve took it and came to the altar before God, as He had taught them.          Chapter LXIX - Twelfth apparition of Satan to Adam and Eve, while Adam  was praying over the offering on the altar; when Satan beat him.    1 Then Satan, the hater of all good, envious of Adam and of his  offering through which he found favor with God, hastened and took a  sharp stone from among the sharp iron stones; appeared in the form of a  man, and went and stood by Adam and Eve.    2 Adam was then offering on the altar, and had begun to pray, with his  hands spread before God.    3 Then Satan hastened with the sharp iron stone he had with him, and  with it pierced Adam on the right side, from which flowed blood and  water, then Adam fell on the altar like a corpse.  And Satan fled.    4 Then Eve came, and took Adam and placed him below the altar.  And  there she stayed, crying over him; while a stream of blood flowed from  Adam's side over his offering.    5 But God looked at the death of Adam.  He then sent His Word, and  raised him up and said to him, \"Fulfil your offering, for indeed, Adam,  it is worth much, and there is no shortcoming in it.\"    6 God said further to Adam, \"Thus will it also happen to Me, on the  earth, when I shall be pierced and blood and water shall flow from My  side and run over My body, which is the true offering; and which shall  be offered on the altar as a perfect offering.\"    7 Then God commanded Adam to finish his offering, and when he had ended  it he worshipped before God, and praised Him for the signs He had  showed him.    8 And God healed Adam in one day, which is the end of the seven weeks;  and that is the fiftieth day.    9 Then Adam and Eve returned from the mountain, and went into the Cave  of Treasures, as they were used to do.  This completed for Adam and  Eve, one hundred and forty days since their coming out of the garden.    10 Then they both stood up that night and prayed to God.  And when it  was morning, they went out, and went down westward of the cave, to the  place where their corn was, and there rested under the shadow of a  tree, as they were accustomed.    11 But when there a multitude of beasts came all around them.  It was  Satan's doing, in his wickedness; in order to wage war against Adam  through marriage.          Chapter LXX - Thirteenth apparition of Satan, to trick Adam into  marrying Eve.    1 After this Satan, the hater of all good, took the form of an angel,  and with him two others, so that they looked like the three angels who  had brought to Adam gold, incense, and myrrh.    2 They passed before Adam and Eve while they were under the tree, and  greeted Adam and Eve with fair words that were full of deceit.    3 But when Adam and Eve saw their pleasant expression, and heard their  sweet speech, Adam rose, welcomed them, and brought them to Eve, and  they remained all together; Adam's heart the while, being glad because  he thought concerning them, that they were the same angels, who had  brought him gold, incense, and myrrh.    4 Because, when they came to Adam the first time, there came over him  from them, peace and joy, through their bringing him good tokens; so  Adam thought that they had come a second time to give him other tokens  for him to rejoice therewith.  For he did not know it was Satan;  therefore he received them with joy and consorted with them.    5 Then Satan, the tallest of them, said, \"Rejoice, O Adam, and be glad.  Look, God has sent us to you to tell you something.\"    6 And Adam said, \"What is it?\"  Then Satan answered, \"It is a simple  thing, yet it is the Word of God, will you accept it from us and do it?  But if you will not accept it, we will return to God, and tell Him that  you would not receive His Word.\"    7 And Satan said again to Adam, \"Don't be afraid and don't tremble;  don't you know us?\"    8 But Adam said, \"I do not know you.\"    9 Then Satan said to him, \"I am the angel that brought you gold, and  took it to the cave; this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39996"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 5 (of 6) (#15)"],[1,"red?         Footnote 18: Sig. Abbate Zannoni, a librarian in Faenza,       assisted by Sig. Zauli, a distinguished professor of design       in that Lyceum, has made some clever remarks upon that       school. They observe that this date of Fabri must be       erroneous, it not being possible for Jacopone to have       commenced painting in 1513, and much less Tonduzzi, pupil to       Giulio Romano, probably, in Mantua: I suspect that the order       of the last two figures should be inverted, so as to read       1531.         They inform me that I was misled in supposing the picture of       the Dominican Nuns to be from the hand of Jacopone, its       great height preventing me from distinguishing the name. It       belongs to his nephew and pupil, Gian Batista, and thus       resembles his style, though coloured with stronger tints in       the taste of Titian, whom he is known to have greatly       consulted in after years. Other pictures of Jacopone might       be cited, that still exist, but injured by time and by       retouches of other destroyers. Yet, they continue, all are       surpassed by a figure that was placed at the Celestini, and       is now in the general collection. It represents St. John       pointing out to the ecclesiastic who ordered the picture,       the Virgin crowned, between Saints Celestino and Benedetto;       a grand piece wonderfully preserved, formed upon the       composition of Raffaello, and coloured after Titian. On the       right side is written, \"F. Jo. Bapt. Para Brasius hoc opus       ob devotionem fieri jussit anno domini 1565:\" (the most       assured epoch of his life;) and on the left hand, \"Et semper       Jacobius Bertusius F. (for Faventinus) invicto tandem Momo       faciebat.\" Who this Momo was, against whose desire (since we       must read _invito_) he completed the picture, I know not;       whether a painter, or perhaps a friar, whom Jacopone's       dilatoriness had offended, and who wished to substitute       another artist, in which good office he did not succeed.    The same city possesses a variety of other pieces by this Bertucci, and in  the soffitto of S. Giovanni, various histories, both of the Old and New  Testament, were pointed out to me as his. There too are several of inferior  character attributed to another Bertucci, his son, an artist who in his  heads repeats the same idea, even to satiety. Still his merit ought not, I  think, to be estimated from a single work, but rather from some pictures  cited by Crespi.[19] One of these is the Beheading of St. John the Baptist,  animated and high toned in its colours, beautiful in point of design and  character, and worthy of decorating the Ercolani collection at Bologna.  Upon it is inscribed \"Bertucius pinxit, 1580.\" The other is at the  Celestini of Faenza, a singular work, as Crespi denominates it, from which  he appears to have learnt the proper name of this younger Bertucci, whom he  calls Giambatista. Baldinucci treats of Jacopone at the commencement of his  fifth volume, and on the credit of Count Laderchi, he enumerates his  different paintings, which then remained at Faenza. Of his surname he  mentions nothing; nothing of his altar-piece of the Nativity; nothing of S.  Vitale; nothing of the son, or the other artist of Faenza lately alluded  to. He adds, that works of Jacopone were to be seen up to the year 1570,  but I believe these last to have belonged to the son, inasmuch as the  father, at the period when Vasari wrote, was already deceased. Other  pictures by this artist are mentioned, painted in glowing and attractive  colours, and in particular the Baptizing of Christ, preserved in the public  collection, valuable from its giving the epoch of 1610, which must have  been towards the close of his days.         Footnote 19: Lettere Pittoriche, vol. vii. p. 66.    By Giulio Tonduzzi there is pointed out at Ravenna the Stoning of St.  Stephen, on the large altar of a church consecrated to that saint, a  beautiful picture, but not indisputably proved to be his. I conjecture it  to be a copy of the St. Stephen that decorates the church of Faenza, in  which the whole style of Giulio Romano is apparent; so much so, that it has  been attributed to him, a mistake arising from resemblance of names; but  Tonduzzi is known to have been Giulio's pupil. I omit other productions of  this excellent artist, though I ought to notice, that in the soffitto of S.  Giovanni, he also painted several sacred histories, in competition with all  the first artists, who then flourished at Faenza, on which account that  very cultivated city has preserved the whole of these paintings, although  much defaced by age, in the Lyceum collection, belonging to the commune,  mentioned in other places. I also find one M. Antonio da Faenza, commended  by Civalli for a very excellent picture, possessing fine relief, at the  church of the Conventuali of Monte Lupone, in the Marca, dated 1525.  Contemporary with these must have been Figurino da Faenza, enumerated by  Vasari among the best disciples of Giulio Romano, though I meet with no  mention of him elsewhere. It is conjectured, however, with good reason,  that Figurino was only a surname given to Marc Antonio Rocchetti, a painter  of great reputation at Faenza, who in youth took great delight in minute  drawing, producing, among other pieces, little histories of St. Sebastian,  for the ornament of that church, now destroyed, when they came into  possession of various individuals who treasure them up in the present day.  In maturer years he enlarged his manner, attaching himself to the imitation  of Baroccio, which he did with a simplicity of composition and sweetness of  tints, that made him conspicuous in different churches which he adorned, as  we may gather from the picture of the titular Saint at S. Rocco, with the  year 1604, the latest period which we find mentioned on his productions. In  the Communal collection, also, there is seen a picture of the Virgin, known  in Faenza under the name of the Madonna of the Angels, with a St. Francis,  a holy bishop, and two portraits below. It bears the inscription, _M.  Antonius Rochettus Faventinus pingebat, 1594_. It was requisite to mention  this picture, which I find extolled above all other specimens that have  remained. The name of Niccolo Paganelli, before unknown to us, is also met  with in the Oretti correspondence, contained in a letter of Zanoni, which  we cite in treating of Benedetto Marini. He is supposed to have been a good  pupil of the Roman School, and some attribute to him the fine picture of S.  Martino, in the cathedral of Faenza, the supposed work of Luca Longhi. His  genuine pictures are recognized by the initials N.+P.    Subsequent to the period of Jacopone, who never acquired fortune, Marco  Marchetti greatly distinguished himself. So at least he is named by  Baglione, or Marco da Faenza, according to Vasari, who observes that he was  \"particularly experienced in regard to frescos; bold, decided, terrible;  and especially in the practice and manner of drawing grotesques, not having  any rival then equal to him.\" Nor perhaps has any artist since appeared who  equals him in this respect, and in happily adapting to grotesques little  histories, full of spirit and elegance, and with figures which form a  school for design. Such is the Slaughter of the Innocents, in the Vatican.  He succeeded Sabbatini in the works of Gregory XIII. and entered the  service of Cosmo I. for whom he decorated the Palazzo Vecchio at Florence.  He painted little in his own country, though a few pieces in oil are still  pointed out, and an arch in a public way, with festoons of flowers,  monsters, and capricci, resembling the work of an ancient artist. The whole  reminds us of mythology and erudition, while at subsequent periods it  became customary in this kind of painting to dare every extravagance and  excess. Perhaps his most finished piece adorns the Communal collection,  representing the Feast of Christ in the house of the Pharisee. His death  occurred in 1588. Contemporary with him flourished Gio. Batista Armenini,  also of Faenza, an able artist, and author of the \"True Precepts of  Painting,\"[20] published at Ravenna in 1587, a work that re-appeared in the  ensuing century at Venice. In fact Armenini was a better theorist than a  practitioner; nor has he any production in his native place, except a large  picture of the Assumption, on which he inscribed _Jo. Bapt. Armenini  primiliae_, meaning, that it was among the first, or perhaps the very first  altar-piece which he ever painted. Perotti, the author of certain  _Farragini_,[21] which are still preserved in the library of the Seminary  at Faenza, there observes, that Armenini was a pupil of Perin del Vaga. Nor  is there a great interval between him and Cristoforo Lanconello, an artist  of Faenza, first discovered to us in the letter of Crespi, just before  cited. He is celebrated for his picture in the Casa Ercolani, in which the  Virgin appears crowned with a glory, attended by Saints Francis and Chiara,  and two more; a work displaying great freedom of hand, beauty of colouring,  fine airs of the heads, and altogether in the composition of Barocci.         Footnote 20: _Veri Precetti della Pittura._         Footnote 21: A mixture of all styles and subjects    We must not take our leave of the Cinquecentisti[22] without first noticing  a cavalier of Faenza, who flourished till the year 1620, in which he died  at the age of 83. His name was Niccolo Pappanelli, and such was his  enthusiasm for the art, that he attended all the most distinguished masters  then in vogue at Rome. On his return to his native place, he produced,  along with some pieces of mediocrity, a few of an exquisite character, such  as his picture of S. Martino at the cathedral, so well executed in point of  design, force of colouring, and expression, as to be truly admirable. He,  too,"]]]
