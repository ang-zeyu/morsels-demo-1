[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3421"],[0,"Bramble-Bees and Others (#15)"],[1,"Osmia, who mixes  the sexes without any order, the Bees whom I studied and probably a  crowd of others produce first a continuous series of females and then a  continuous series of males, the latter with less provisions and smaller  cells. This distribution of the sexes agrees with what we have long  known of the Hive-bee, who begins her laying with a long sequence of  workers, or sterile females, and ends it with a long sequence of  males. The analogy continues down to the capacity of the cells and the  quantities of provisions. The real females, the Queen-bees, have wax  cells incomparably more spacious than the cells of the males and receive  a much larger amount of food. Everything therefore demonstrates that we  are here in the presence of a general rule.    But does this rule express the whole truth? Is there nothing beyond a  laying in two series? Are the Osmiae, the Chalicodomae and the rest of  them fatally bound by this distribution of the sexes into two distinct  groups, the male group following upon the female group, without any  mixing of the two? Is the mother absolutely powerless to make a change  in this arrangement, should circumstances require it?    The Three-pronged Osmia already shows us that the problem is far from  being solved. In the same bramble-stump, the two sexes occur very  irregularly, as though at random. Why this mixture in the series  of cocoons of a Bee closely related to the Horned Osmia and the  Three-horned Osmia, who stack theirs methodically by separate sexes  in the hollow of a reed? What the Bee of the brambles does cannot her  kinswomen of the reeds do too? Nothing, so far as I know, can explain  this difference in a physiological act of primary importance. The three  Bees belong to the same genus; they resemble one another in general  outline, internal structure and habits; and, with this close similarity,  we suddenly find a strange dissimilarity.    There is just one thing that might possibly arouse a suspicion of the  cause of this irregularity in the Three-pronged Osmia's laying. If I  open a bramble-stump in the winter to examine the Osmia's nest, I find  it impossible, in the vast majority of cases, to distinguish positively  between a female and a male cocoon: the difference in size is so  small. The cells, moreover, have the same capacity: the diameter of the  cylinder is the same throughout and the partitions are almost always the  same distance apart. If I open it in July, the victualling-period, it is  impossible for me to distinguish between the provisions destined for the  males and those destined for the females. The measurement of the column  of honey gives practically the same depth in all the cells. We find an  equal quantity of space and food for both sexes.    This result makes us foresee what a direct examination of the two sexes  in the adult form tells us. The male does not differ materially from  the female in respect of size. If he is a trifle smaller, it is scarcely  noticeable, whereas, in the Horned Osmia and the Three-horned Osmia,  the male is only half or a third the size of the female, as we have seen  from the respective bulk of their cocoons. In the Mason-bee of the Walls  there is also a difference in size, though less pronounced.    The Three-pronged Osmia has not therefore to trouble about adjusting the  dimensions of the dwelling and the quantity of the food to the sex of  the egg which she is about to lay; the measure is the same from one end  of the series to the other. It does not matter if the sexes alternate  without order: one and all will find what they need, whatever their  position in the row. The two other Osmiae, with their great disparity  in size between the two sexes, have to be careful about the twofold  consideration of board and lodging. And that, I think, is why they begin  with spacious cells and generous rations for the homes of the females  and end with narrow, scantily-provisioned cells, the homes of the males.  With this sequence, sharply defined for the two sexes, there is less  fear of mistakes which might give to one what belongs to another. If  this is not the explanation of the facts, I see no other.    The more I thought about this curious question, the more probable it  appeared to me that the irregular series of the Three-pronged Osmia and  the regular series of the other Osmiae, of the Chalicodomae and of the  Bees in general were all traceable to a common law. It seemed to me that  the arrangement in a succession first of females and then of males did  not account for everything. There must be something more. And I was  right: that arrangement in series is only a tiny fraction of the  reality, which is remarkable in a very different way. This is what I am  going to prove by experiment.          CHAPTER 4. THE MOTHER DECIDES THE SEX OF THE EGG.    I will begin with the Mason-bee of the Pebbles. (This is the same  insect as the Mason-bee of the Walls. Cf. \"The Mason-bees\":  passim.--Translator's Note.) The old nests are often used, when they are  in good enough repair. Early in the season the mothers quarrel fiercely  over them; and, when one of the Bees has taken possession of the coveted  dome, she drives any stranger away from it. The old house is far from  being a ruin, only it is perforated with as many holes as it once had  occupants. The work of restoration is no great matter. The heap of earth  due to the destruction of the lid by the outgoing tenant is taken out of  the cell and flung away at a distance, atom by atom. The remnants of  the cocoon are also thrown away, but not always, for the delicate silken  wrapper sometimes adheres closely to the masonry.    The victualling of the renovated cell is now begun. Next comes the  laying; and lastly the orifice is sealed with a mortar plug. A second  cell is utilized in the same way, followed by a third and so on, one  after the other, as long as any remain unoccupied and the mother's  ovaries are not exhausted. Finally, the dome receives, mainly over the  apertures already plugged, a coat of plaster which makes the nest look  like new. If she has not finished her laying, the mother goes in search  of other old nests to complete it. Perhaps she does not decide to found  a new establishment except when she can find no second-hand dwellings,  which mean a great economy of time and labour. In short, among the  countless number of nests which I have collected, I find many more  ancient than recent ones.    How shall we distinguish one from the other? The outward aspect tells  you nothing, owing to the great care taken by the Mason to restore the  surface of the old dwelling equal to new. To resist the rigours of the  winter, this surface must be impregnable. The mother knows that and  therefore repairs the dome. Inside, it is another matter: the old nest  stands revealed at once. There are cells whose provisions, at least a  year old, are intact, but dried up or musty, because the egg has never  developed. There are others containing a dead larva, reduced by time  to a blackened, curled-up cylinder. There are some whence the perfect  insect was never able to issue: the Chalicodoma wore herself out in  trying to pierce the ceiling of her chamber; her strength failed her and  she perished in the attempt. Others again and very many are occupied  by ravagers, Leucopses (Cf. \"The Mason-bees\": chapter 11.--Translator's  Note.) and Anthrax-flies, who will come out a good deal later, in July.  Altogether, the house is far from having every room vacant; there are  nearly always a considerable number occupied either by parasites that  were still in the egg-stage at the time when the Mason-bee was at work  or by damaged provisions, dried grubs or Chalicodomae in the perfect  state who have died without being able to effect their deliverance.    Should all the rooms be available, a rare occurrence, there still  remains a method of distinguishing between an ancient nest and a recent  one. The cocoon, as I have said, adheres pretty closely to the walls;  and the mother does not always take away this remnant, either  because she is unable to do so, or because she considers the removal  unnecessary. Thus the base of the new cocoon is set in the bottom of the  old cocoon. This double wrapper points very clearly to two generations,  two separate years. I have even found as many as three cocoons fitting  one into another at their bases. Consequently, the nests of the  Mason-bee of the Pebbles are able to do duty for three years, if not  more. Eventually they become utter ruins, abandoned to the Spiders and  to various smaller Bees or Wasps, who take up their quarters in the  crumbling rooms.    As we see, an old nest is hardly ever capable of containing the  Mason-bee's entire laying, which calls for some fifteen apartments. The  number of rooms at her disposal is most unequal, but always very small.  It is saying much when there are enough to receive about half the  laying. Four or five cells, sometimes two or even one: that is what  the Mason usually finds in a nest that is not her own work. This large  reduction is explained when we remember the numerous parasites that live  upon the unfortunate Bee.    Now, how are the sexes distributed in those layings which are  necessarily broken up between one old nest and another? They are  distributed in such a way as utterly to upset the idea of an invariable  succession first of females and then of males, the idea which occurs  to us on examining the new nests. If this rule were a constant one, we  should be bound to find in the old domes at one time only females, at  another only males, according as the laying was at its first or at its  second stage. The simultaneous presence of the two sexes would then  correspond with the transition period between one stage and the next and  should be very unusual. On the contrary, it is very common; and, however  few cells there may be, we always find both females and males"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34211"],[0,"A Treatise on Physiology and Hygiene (#15)"],[1,"iquors?]    43. Another property it has in common with tea and coffee. It supports the  powers of life, economizes food, and retards the waste of tissues; in other  words, it \"banks the fires,\" and prevents their burning wastefully. On this  principle we explain the restorative influence of wines or liquors during  exhausting diseases, in convalescence, and after excessive labors of mind  or body.    [Sidenote: 44. Alcohol, a poison? Moderate stimulants? Prevailing opinion?  Hence?]    44. Pure alcohol, or an excessive quantity of ardent spirits, is an  undoubted poison, and has been frequently known to produce fatal results.  Stimulants in moderate quantities have been thought to increase strength,  and in this view they have been called \"alcoholic foods.\" This is not now  conceded by scientific men. The prevailing opinion is, that they serve no  useful purpose as an article of diet, and that their beneficial influence  is limited to cases where the system is enfeebled, where some unnatural  demand is made upon the vital powers, or where the supply of food is  insufficient. Hence, while alcohol has not the power to build up, it may  obstruct the process of pulling down. {79}    QUESTIONS FOR TOPICAL REVIEW.

Design of food? How accomplished?]    1. NUTRITION.--The great design of food is to give _nutriment_ or  nourishment to the body. But this is not accomplished directly, as the food  must first pass through certain preparatory changes, as follows: (1),  _Digestion_, by which the food is reduced to a soluble condition; (2),  _Absorption_, by which, when digested, it is imbibed into the blood; (3),  _Circulation_, which carries the enriched blood to the various parts of the  system; and (4), _Assimilation_, by which each tissue derives from the  blood the materials necessary for its support.    [Sidenote: 2. Sustaining power of food? Simile of the engine? Operation in  the human body?]    2. By these means the sustaining power of food is gradually developed and  employed, and the vital machinery kept in working order, somewhat after the  manner of the steam-engine. To operate the latter, the force imprisoned  within the coal and water is set free and converted into motion by the  combustion of the fuel and the vaporization of the water. It will be seen,  however, when we come to study these operations in the human body, that  they are conducted silently and harmoniously, with marvellous delicacy and  completeness, and without that friction, and {81} consequent loss of power,  which attend the working of the most perfect machinery of man's invention.    [Sidenote: 3. Change of food in digestion? Process of digestion? Describe  the alimentary canal.]    3. GENERAL PLAN OF DIGESTION.--The great change which food undergoes in  digestion is essentially a reforming process, reducing articles of diet,  which are at first more or less solid, crude, and coarse, to a liquid and  finely comminuted condition, suitable for absorption into the blood. The  entire process of digestion takes place in what is called the alimentary  canal, a narrow, tortuous tube, about thirty feet in its entire length.  This canal begins in the mouth, extends thence downward through the gullet  to the stomach (a receptacle in which the principal work of digestion is  performed), and thence onward through the small and large intestines.    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--SECTION OF THE TRUNK SHOWING THE CAVITIES OF THE  CHEST AND ABDOMEN.    A, Cavity of Chest; B, Diaphragm; C, Abdomen; D, E, Spinal Column.]    [Sidenote: 4. Situation of the stomach and intestines? Action of the food?  Mechanical action? Chemical?]    4. The stomach and intestines are situated in the cavity of the abdomen  (Fig. 16, C, and Fig. 22), and occupy about two-thirds of its space. The  action to which the food is subjected in these organs is of two  kinds--mechanical and chemical. By the former it is crushed, agitated, and  carried onward from one point to another; by the latter it is changed in  form through the solvent power of the various digestive juices. {82}    [Sidenote: 5. Describe the process of mastication? How many and what  movements?]    5. MASTICATION.--As soon as solid food is taken into the mouth, it  undergoes mastication, or chewing. It is caught between the opposite  surfaces of the teeth, and by them is cut and crushed into very small  fragments. In the movements of chewing, the lower jaw plays the chief part;  the upper jaw, having almost no motion, acts simply as a point of  resistance, to meet the action of the former. These movements of the lower  jaw are of three sorts: a vertical or cutting, a lateral or grinding, and a  _to-and-fro_ or gnawing motion.
