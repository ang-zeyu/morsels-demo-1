But though a black spot, 34 seconds in diameter, can be perceived on a  white ground, we have not yet attained to defined vision. For if we place  two black spots each 34 seconds of arc in diameter, near each other, they  will not be seen as separate spots unless there is a clear space between  them of six times that amount. Nearer than that they will give the  impression that they form one circular spot, or an oval one, or even a  uniform straight line, according to the amount of separation. If two equal  round spots be placed so that the distance between their centres is equal  to two diameters, then the diameter of each spot must be, at least, 70  seconds of arc for them to be distinctly defined; that is to say for the  spots to be seen as two separate objects.    It will be seen that there is a wide range between objects that are large  enough to be quite unmistakably perceived, and objects which are large  enough to have their true outline really defined. It is a question of  seconds of arc in the one case and of minutes of arc in the other. Within  this range, between the limit at which objects can be just perceived and  that where they can be just defined, objects must all appear as of one of  two forms--the straight line and the circular dot.    This depends upon the structure of the eye and of the retina; the eye  being essentially a lens with its defining power necessarily limited by  its aperture, and the retina a sensitive screen built up of an immense  number of separate elements each of which can only transmit a single  sensation. Different eyes will have different limits, both for the  smallest objects which can be discerned and for the smallest objects that  can be defined, but for any sight the range between the two will be of the  order just indicated.    Prof. Lowell has drawn attention to the \"strangely economic character of  both the canals and oases in the matter of form.\" It is true that straight  lines and circles are economic forms, but they are economic not only in  the construction of irrigation works but also in vision. \"The circle is  the figure which encloses the maximum area for the minimum average  distance from its centre to any point situated within it;\" therefore, if  a small spot be perceived by the sight but be too small to have its actual  outline defined, it will be recognized by the eye as being truly circular,  on the principle of economy of effort. So, again, a straight line is the  shortest that can be drawn between two points; and a straight line can be  perceived as such when of an angular breadth quite 40 times less than that  of the smallest spot. A straight line is that which gives the least total  excitement in order to produce an appreciable impression, and therefore  the smallest appreciable impression produces the effect of a straight  line.    It is sufficient, then, for us to suppose that the surface of Mars is  dotted over with minute irregular markings, with a tendency to aggregate  in certain directions, such as would naturally arise in the process of the  cooling of a planet when the outer crust was contracting above an  unyielding nucleus. If these markings are fairly near each other it is not  necessary, in order to produce the effect of \"canals,\" that they should be  individually large enough to be seen. They may be of any conceivable  shape, provided that they are separately below the limit of defined  vision, and are sufficiently sparsely scattered. In this case the eye  inevitably sums up the details (which it recognizes but cannot resolve)  into lines essentially \"canal-like\" in character. Wherever there is a  small aggregation of these minute markings, an impression will be given  of a circular spot, or, to use Prof. Lowell's nomenclature, an \"oasis.\" If  the aggregation be greater still and more extended, we shall have a shaded  area--a \"sea.\"    The above remarks apply to observation with the unaided eye, but the same  principle applies yet more strongly to telescopic vision. No star is near  enough or sufficiently large to give the least impression of a true disc;  its diameter is indistinguishable; it is for us a mathematical point,  \"without parts or magnitude.\" But the image of a star formed by a  telescope is not a point but a minute disc, surrounded by a series of  diffraction rings. This disc is \"spurious,\" for the greater the aperture  of the telescope the smaller the apparent disc.    That which holds good for a bright point like a star holds good for every  individual point of a planetary surface when viewed through the telescope;  that is to say, each point is represented by a minute disc; all lines and  outlines therefore are slightly blurred, so that minute irregularities are  inevitably smoothed out.    When we come to photographs, the process is carried to a third stage. The  image is formed by the telescope, subject to all the limitations of  telescopic images, and is received on a plate essentially granular in  structure, and is finally examined by the eye. The granular structure of  the plate acts as the third factor in concealing irregularities and  simplifying details; a third factor in producing the two simplest types of  form--the straight line and the circular dot.    Prof. Lowell describes the canals as like lines drawn with pen, ink and  ruler, but not a few of our best observers have advanced much beyond this  stage. Even as far back as 1884, some of the canals were losing their  strict rectilinear appearance to Schiaparelli, and the observers of the  planet who have been best favoured by the power of the telescope at their  disposal, by the atmospheric conditions under which they worked, and by  their own skill and experience--such as Antoniadi, Barnard, Cerulli,  Denning, Millochau, Molesworth, Phillips, Stanley Williams and  others--have found them to show evident signs of resolution. Thus, in  1909, Antoniadi found that of 50 canals, 14 were resolved into  disconnected knots of diffused shadings, 4 were seen as irregular lines,  10 as more or less dark bands; and he found that, in good seeing, there  was no trace whatever of the geometrical network.    The progress of observation, therefore, has left Prof. Lowell behind, and  has dispelled the fable which he has defended with so much ingenuity. But,  indeed, there never was any more reason for taking seriously his theory as  to the presence of artificial waterways on Mars than for believing in the  actual existence of the weird creatures described by H. G. Wells in the  _War of the Worlds_.    There are too many oversights in the canal theory.    Thus no source is indicated for the moisture supposed to be locked up in  the winter pole cap. Prof. Lowell holds that there are no large bodies of  water on the planet; that the so-called seas are really cultivated land.  In this case there could be little or no evaporation, and so no means by  which the polar deposits could be recruited.    Yet it is certain that the supply of the winter pole cap must come from  the evaporation of water in some region or other. And here is another  oversight of the artificial canal theory. The canals are supposed to be  necessary for the conveyance of water from the pole towards the equator;  although, as this was \"uphill,\" vast pumping stations at short intervals  had to be predicated. But it is not supposed that the water needed to  travel by way of the canals to the poles. If, however, the moisture is  conveyed as vapour through the atmosphere to the pole as winter  approaches, it cannot be impossible that it should be conveyed in the same  manner from the pole as summer draws on, and in that case the artificial  canals would not be needed. If the canals are necessary for conveying the  water in one direction, they would be necessary for the opposite  direction. But there would be something too farcical in the idea of the  careful Martians dispatching their water first to the pole to be frozen  there, and then, after it had been duly frozen and melted again, fetching  it back along thousands of miles and through numerous pumping stations for  use in irrigating their fields.    Of all the many hundreds of canals only a few actually touch the polar  caps. But on the theory that the entire canal system is fed by the polar  cap in summer, the carrying capacity of the polar canals should be equal  to, if not greater than, that of the entire system outside the polar  circle. A glance at the charts of the planet shows that the polar canals  could not supply a twentieth part of the water needed for those in the  equatorial regions. Another oversight is that of the significance of the  alleged uniformity and breadth of the canals. Prof. Lowell repeatedly  insists that the canals are of even breadth from end to end, and spring  into existence at once throughout their whole length. This statement is in  itself a proof that the canals cannot be what he supposes them to be. An  irrigation system could not have these characteristics; the region  fertilized would take time to develop; we should see the canal extending  itself gradually across the continent, and its breadth would not be  uniform from end to end, but the region fertilized would grow narrower  with increase of distance from the fountain head of the canal.    Under what conditions can we see straight lines, perfectly uniform from  end to end, spring into existence, in their entirety, without going  through any stages of growth? When the lines are not actual images, but  are suggested by markings perceived, but not perfectly defined. In 1902  and 1903, in conjunction with Mr. Evans, the headmaster of Greenwich  Hospital School, I tried a number of experiments on this point, with the  aid of about two hundred of the boys of the school. They had several  qualifications in respect of these experiments; they were keen-sighted,  well drilled; accustomed to do what they were told without"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35993"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote de la Mancha (#15)"],[1,"possession of a considerable  post. Scarce had the Don perceived the monks, who were not of the same  company, though they went the same way, but he cried to his squire,  \"Either I am deceived, or this will prove the most famous adventure  that ever was known; for without all question those two black things  that move towards us must be necromancers, that are carrying away by  force some princess in that coach; and 'tis my duty to prevent so  great an injury.\" \"I fear me this will prove a worse job than the  windmills,\" quoth Sancho; \"take warning, sir, and do not be led away a  second time.\" \"I have already told thee, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote,  \"thou art miserably ignorant in matters of adventures: what I say is  true, and thou shalt find it so presently.\" This said, he spurred on  his horse, and posted himself just in the midst of the road where the  monks were to pass. And when they came within hearing, he immediately  cried out in a loud and haughty tone, \"Release those high-born  princesses whom you are violently conveying away in the coach, or else  prepare to meet with instant death, as the just punishment of your  deeds.\" The monks stopped, no less astonished at the figure than at  the expressions of the speaker. \"Sir knight,\" cried they, \"we are no  such persons as you are pleased to term us, but religious men of the  order of St. Benedict, that travel about our affairs, and are wholly  ignorant whether or no there are any princesses carried away by force  in that coach.\" \"I am not to be deceived,\" replied Don Quixote; \"I  know you well enough, perfidious caitiffs:\" and immediately, without  waiting their reply, he set spurs to Rozinante, and ran so furiously,  with his lance couched, against the first monk, that if he had not  prudently flung himself to the ground, the knight would certainly have  laid him either dead, or grievously wounded. The other observing this,  clapped his heels to his mule's flanks, and scoured over the plain as  if he had been running a race with the wind. Sancho no sooner saw the  monk fall, but he leapt off his ass, and running to him, began to  strip him immediately; but the two muleteers, who waited on the  monks, came up to him, and asked why he offered to strip him? Sancho  told them that this belonged to him as lawful plunder, being the  spoils won in battle by his lord and master Don Quixote. The fellows,  with whom there was no jesting, not knowing what he meant by his  spoils and battle, and seeing Don Quixote at a good distance in deep  discourse by the side of the coach, fell both upon poor Sancho, threw  him down, tore his beard from his chin, trampled on him, and there  left him lying without breath or motion. In the mean while the monk,  scared out of his wits and as pale as a ghost, got upon his mule again  as fast as he could, and spurred after his friend, who stayed for him  at a distance, expecting the issue of this strange adventure; but  being unwilling to stay to see the end of it, they made the best of  their way, making more signs of the cross than if the devil had been  posting after them.    Don Quixote was all this while engaged with the lady in the coach.  \"Lady,\" cried he, \"your discretion is now at liberty to dispose of  your beautiful self as you please; for the presumptuous arrogance of  those who attempted to enslave your person lies prostrate in the dust,  overthrown by this arm: and that you may not be at a loss for the name  of your deliverer, know I am called Don Quixote de la Mancha, by  profession a knight-errant and adventurer, captive to that peerless  beauty Donna Dulcinea del Toboso: nor do I desire any other recompense  for the service I have done you, but that you return to Toboso to  present yourself to that lady, and let her know what I have done to  purchase your deliverance.\" So saying he bade her courteously  farewell, and pursued his way.          CHAPTER IX.    _What passed between Don Quixote and the Goatherds._      After travelling the remainder of the day without further adventure,  they came to a place where some goatherds had set up some small huts;  and there they concluded to take up their lodging that night. This was  as great a mortification to Sancho, who was altogether for a good  town, as it was a pleasure to his master, who was for sleeping in the  open fields; and who believed that, as often as he did it, he  confirmed his title to knighthood by a new act of possession.    The knight was very courteously received by the goatherds; and as for  Sancho, after he had set up Rozinante and his ass as well as he could,  he presently repaired to the attractive smell of some pieces of kid's  flesh which stood boiling in a kettle over the fire. The hungry  squire would immediately have tried whether they were fit to be  removed out of the kettle into the stomach, but was not put to that  trouble; for the goatherds took them off the fire, and spread some  sheep-skins on the ground, and soon got their rural feast ready; and  cheerfully invited his master and him to partake of what they had.  Next, with some coarse compliment, after the country way, they desired  Don Quixote to sit down on a trough with the bottom upwards; and then  six of them, who were all that belonged to that fold, squatted them  down round the skins, while Sancho stood to wait upon his master, and  gave him drink in a horn cup, which the goatherds used. But he seeing  his man stand behind, said to him, \"Sancho, it is my pleasure that  thou sit thee down by me, in the company of these good people, that  there be no difference now observed between thee and me, thy natural  lord and master; for it may be said of knight-errantry as of love,  that it makes all things equal.\" \"I thank your worship,\" cried Sancho;  \"but yet I must needs own, had I but a good deal of meat before me,  I'd eat it as well, or rather better, standing, and by myself, than if  I sat by an emperor; and, to deal plainly and truly with you, I had  rather munch a crust of brown bread and an onion in a corner, without  any more ado or ceremony, than feed upon turkey at another man's  table, where one is fain to sit mincing and chewing his meat an hour  together, drink little, be always wiping his fingers and his mouth,  and never dare to cough or sneeze, though he has never so much a mind  to it, nor do a many things which a body may do freely by one's self:  therefore, good sir, change those tokens of your kindness, which I  have a right to by being your worship's squire, into something that  may do me more good. As for these same honours, I heartily thank you  as much as if I had accepted them; but yet I give up my right to them  from this time to the world's end.\" \"Talk no more,\" replied Don  Quixote, \"but sit thee down, for the humble shall be exalted;\" and so  pulling him by the arms, he forced him to sit by him.    All this while the goatherds said nothing, but stared upon their  guests; who swallowed whole luncheons as big as their fists with a  mighty appetite.    A young fellow, who used to bring them provisions from the next  village, happened to come while they were eating, and addressing  himself to the goatherds, \"Hark ye, friends,\" said he, \"d'ye hear the  news?\" \"What news?\" cried one of the company. \"That fine shepherd and  scholar Chrysostome died this morning,\" answered the other; \"and they  say it was for love of Marcella, daughter of William the rich, that  goes up and down the country in the habit of a shepherdess.\" \"For  Marcella!\" cried one of the goatherds. \"I say for her,\" replied the  fellow; \"and what is more, it is reported he has ordered by his will  they should bury him in the fields like any heathen Moor, hard by the  cork-tree fountain, where they say he first saw her. Nay, he has  likewise ordered many other strange things to be done, which the  clergy cannot allow of; while Ambrose, the other scholar, who likewise  apparelled himself like a shepherd, is resolved to have his friend  Chrysostome's will fulfilled in every thing, just as he has ordered  it. It is thought that Ambrose and his friends will carry the day; and  to-morrow morning he is to be buried in great state where I told you:  I fancy it will be worth seeing; and I intend to go and see it, even  though I should not get back again to-morrow.\" \"We will all go,\" cried  the goatherds, \"and cast lots who shall tarry to look after the  goats.\" \"Well said, Pedro,\" cried one of the goatherds; \"but as for  casting of lots, I will save you that labour, for I will stay myself,  not so much out of kindness to you neither, or want of curiosity, as  because of the thorn in my toe, that will not let me go.\" Don Quixote,  who heard all this, entreated Pedro to tell him who the deceased was,  and also to give him a short account of the shepherdess.    Peter answered, that all he knew of the matter was, that the deceased  was a wealthy gentleman, who had been several years at the university  of Salamanca, and came home mightily improved in his learning. Within  some few months after he had left the university, on a certain morning  we saw him come dressed for all the world like a shepherd, and driving  his flock, having laid down the long gown, which he used to wear as a  scholar. At the same time one Ambrose, who had been his  fellow-scholar, also took upon him to go like a shepherd, and keep him  company, which we all did not a little marvel at. Somewhat before that  time Chrysostome's father died, and left him a large estate; and in  truth he deserved it all, for he was bountiful to the poor, a friend  to all honest people, and had a face like any blessing. At last it  came to be known, that the reason of his altering his garb in that  fashion was only that he might go up and down after that shepherdess  Marcella, whom our comrade told you of before, for he was fallen  mightily in love with her. And now I will tell you who this lady is.  You must know that there lived near us one William, a"]]]
