But before putting together the confusing records of this period I  must revert to the events of the year A.D. 1443.    \"At this period,\" says Abdur Razzak, referring to the second half  of the year 1443, \"Danaik[114] the vizier set out on an expedition  into the kingdom of Kalbarga.\" The reasons which had led to this  invasion were as follows: Sultan Ala-ud-din had heard of the  treacherous attempt to kill the king of Vijayanagar and the murder  of the nobles and Principal people, and he had sent a message to the  king demanding payment of \"seven lakhs of varahas,\" as he thought the  moment auspicious for an attempt to crush the kingdom. \"Diou-rai, the  king of Bidjanagar, was equally troubled and irritated by the receipt  of such a message,\" but he sent a brave answer and prepared for war.    \"Troops were sent out on both sides, which made great ravages on  the frontiers of the two kingdoms.... Danaik, after having nit de  an invasion upon the frontiers of the country of Kalbarga, and taken  several unfortunate prisoners, had retraced his steps....\"    Firishtah also describes this war of A.D. 1443. He states that Deva  Raya wantonly attacked the Bahmani princes --    \"crossed the Tummedra suddenly, took the fortress of Mudkul, sent his  sons to besiege Roijore and Beekapore, encamped himself along the bank  of the Kistnan, and sent out detachments, who plundered the country  as far as Saugher and Beejapore, laying waste by fire and sword.    \"Sultan Alla ud Dien, upon intelligence of this invasion, prepared to  repel it, and commanded all his forces from Telingana, Dowlutabad,  and Berar to repair to the capital of Ahmedabad without delay. Upon  their arrival he reviewed the whole, and found his army composed of  fifty thousand horse, sixty thousand foot, and a considerable train  of artillery. With this force he began to march against the enemy;  and Deo Roy, upon his approach, shifted his ground, and encamped under  the walls of the fortress of Mudkul, detaching a large body to harass  the sultan.    \"The sultan halted at the distance of twelve miles from Mudkul, and  despatched Mallek al Tijar with the troops of Dowlutabad against the  sons of Deo Roy;[115] also Khan Zummaun, governor of Beejapore, and  Khan Azim, commander of the forces of Berar and Telingana, against the  main body of the enemy. Mallek-al-Tijar, going first to Roijore, gave  battle to the eldest son of Deo Roy, who was wounded in the action,  and fled towards Beekapore, from whence he was joined by his younger  brother, who quitted the siege of that fortress.    \"In the space of two months, three actions happened near Mudkul between  the two grand armies; in the first of which multitudes were slain  on both sides, and the Hindoos having the advantage, the mussulmauns  experienced great difficulties.[116] The sultan was successful in the  others; and in the last, the eldest son of Deo Roy was killed by a  spear thrown at him by Khan Zummaun, which event struck the Hindoos  with a panic, and they fled with the greatest precipitation into the  fortress of Mudkul.\"    Two chief Muhammadan officers, in the ardour of pursuit, entered the  city with the fugitives, and were captured by the Hindus.    Deo Roy then sent a message to the Sultan that if he would promise  never again to molest his territories he would pay the stipulated  tribute annually, and return the two prisoners. This was accepted,  a treaty was executed, and the prisoners returned with the tribute  and added presents; and till the end of Deva Raya's reign both parties  observed their agreement.    From the terms of the agreement we gather that, though Firishtah does  not expressly mention it, tribute had been demanded by the Sultan,  and this confirms the account given by Abdur Razzak. It also shows  why the \"Danaik\" in Abdur Razzak's narrative had not returned covered  with glory, but merely, having \"taken several unfortunate prisoners,  had retraced his steps.\"    The campaign must have been of short duration, since, while it began in  A.H. 847 (May 1, A.D. 1443, to April 19, 1444) according to Firishtah,  it was over before December 1443 when Abdur Razzak left Vijayanagar.    The narrative being thus brought down to the close of the year 1443,  let us, before passing on, turn to other records and see what they  tell us about the reign of Deva Raya II. I have already stated that  he appears to have been very young at his accession in A.D. 1419. In  1443 he had already reigned twenty-four years. Now the Hakluyt  translation of Abdur Razzak's chronicle states that Razzak saw  King Deva Raya II. in 1443, and the India Office copy contains the  additional information that the king was then \"exceedingly young.\" I  am not aware which version is the more accurate. But even if these  added words be accepted as part of the original, the difficulty is  capable of being explained away by the supposition that perhaps the  ambassador was presented to one of the princes and not to the king  himself. The king appears to have been in doubt as to whether the  traveller was not an impostor in representing himself as an envoy  from Persia, and may have refrained from granting a personal interview.    Several inscriptions of the reign are extant. One records a  proclamation made in the king's name in A.D. 1426.[117] According  to another bearing a date corresponding to Wednesday, October 16,  in the same year,[118] he caused a Jain temple to be erected in  the capital, in a street called the \"Pan Supari Bazaar.\" This  temple is situated south-west of the temple marked as No. 35 on  the Government map. It is within the enclosure of the royal palace,  and close to the rear of the elephant stables still standing. The  king is honoured in this inscription with the full imperial title  of MAHARAJADHIRAJA RAJAPARAMESVARA. The site of this bazaar is thus  definitely established. It lay on either side of the road which ran  along the level dry ground direct from the palace gate, near the temple  of HAZARA RAMASVAMI, in a north-easterly direction, to join the road  which now runs to the Tungabhadra ferry through the fortified gate on  the south side of the river immediately opposite Anegundi. It passed  along the north side of the Kallamma and Rangasvami temples, leaving  the imperial office enclosure with its lofty walls and watch-towers,  and the elephant stables, on the left, skirted the Jain temple and the  temple numbered \"35\" on the plan, and passed along under the rocky  hills that bound this plain on the north till it debouched on the  main road above mentioned. This street would be the direct approach  from the old city of Anegundi to the king's palace.    In A.D. 1430 the king made a grant to a temple far in the south in  the Tanjore district.[119] There are two inscriptions of his reign  dated respectively in 1433 -- 34 and 1434 -- 35 A.D. at Padavedu in  North Arcot.[120] If, as stated by Nuniz, King Deva Raya II. died a  few months after his attempted assassination, and if Abdur Razzak saw  him in December 1443, we are led to the belief that he died early in  1444. Definite proof is, however, wanting. Other inscriptions must be  carefully examined before we can arrive at any certain conclusion. Thus  an inscription at Sravana Belgola, of date corresponding to Tuesday,  May 24 A.D. 1446, published by Professor Kielhorn,[121] relates to  the death on that day of \"Pratapa Deva Raya;\" and as it is couched in  very curious and interesting terms, I give the translation in full --    \"In the evil year Kshaya, in the wretched (month) second Vaisakha,  on a miserable Tuesday, in a fortnight which was the reverse of  bright,[122] on the fourteenth day, the unequalled store of valour  (PRATAPA) Deva Raya, alas! met with death.\"    But since royal titles are not given to the deceased, he may have  been only a prince of the blood. An inscription at Tanjore, also  dated in A.D. 1446, mentions the name Deva Raya, but gives no further  royal titles than the BIRUDA -- \"Lord of the four oceans.\"[123] An  inscription bearing date corresponding to Saturday, August 2 A.D. 1449,  at Conjeeveram,[124] records a grant by a king called Vira Pratapa  Praudha-Immadi-Deva Raya, to whom full royal titles are given.    It is provoking that Nuniz omits the name of the successor of Deva  Raya II., as known to tradition in the sixteenth century, for this  might have helped us to a decision. At present it looks as though  there had been a Deva Raya III. reigning from A.D. 1444 to 1449;  but this point cannot as yet be settled.    Mr. Rice has shown that one of the ministers of Deva Raya II. was named  Naganna; he had the title \"Dhannayaka,\" implying command of the army.        CHAPTER 7    The City of Vijayanagar in the Reign of Deva Raya II. (A.D. 1420  (?), 1443)    Description given by Nicolo to Bracciolini -- The capital -- Festivals  -- Immense population -- Abdur Razzak's description -- His journey --  The walls -- Palaces -- The Mint -- Bazaars -- The great Mahahnavami  festival.    It will be well to suspend our historical narrative for a time in  order to acquire some idea of the appearance and condition of the  great city of Vijayanagar in these days. We have already noticed that  as early as 1375 A.D. Sultan Mujahid of Kulbarga had heard so much of  the beauty of this capital that he desired to see it, and it had grown  in importance and grandeur during the succeeding half-century. About  the year 1420 or 1421 A.D. there visited Vijayanagar one Nicolo, an  Italian, commonly called Nicolo Conti or Nicolo dei Conti, and if he  was not the earliest European visitor, he was at least the earliest  that we know of whose description of the place has survived to this  day. His visit must have taken place shortly after the accession of  Deva Raya II. Nicolo never apparently wrote anything"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33129"],[0,"Incidents of Travel in Yucatan, Vol. I. (#15)"],[1,"of which has been ascribed to the most ancient people in  the Old World, and to races lost, perished, and unknown.    I am happy thus early in these pages to have an opportunity of  recurring to the opinion expressed in my former volumes, in regard to  the builders of the ancient American cities.    The conclusion to which I came was, that \"there are not sufficient  grounds for belief in the great antiquity that has been ascribed to  these ruins;\" \"that we are not warranted in going back to any ancient  nation of the Old World for the builders of these cities; that they are  not the works of people who have passed away, and whose history is  lost; but that there are strong reasons to believe them the creation of  the same races who inhabited the country at the time of the Spanish  conquest, or of some not very distant progenitors.\"    This opinion was not given lightly, nor without due consideration. It  was adverse to my feelings, which would fain have thrown around the  ruins the interest of mystery and hoary age; and even now, though  gratified at knowing that my opinion has been fully sustained, I would  be willing to abandon it, and involve the reader and myself in doubt,  did circumstances warrant me in so doing; but I am obliged to say that  subsequent investigations have fortified and confirmed my previous  conclusions, and, in fact, have made conviction what before was mere  matter of opinion.    When I wrote the account of my former journey, the greatest difficulty  attending the consideration of this subject was the absence of all  historical record concerning the places visited. Copan had some  history, but it was obscure, uncertain, and unsatisfactory. Quirigua,  Palenque, and Uxmal had none whatever; but a ray of historic light  beams upon the solitary arch in the ruined convent of Merida.    In the account of the conquest of Yucatan by Cogolludo it is stated,  that on the arrival of the Spaniards at the Indian town of Tihoo, on  the site of which, it will be remembered, Merida now stands, they found  many cerros hechos a mano, _i. e._, hills made by hand, or artificial  mounds, and that on one of these mounds the Spaniards encamped.    This mound, it is stated, stood on the ground now occupied by the plaza  major. East of it was another large mound, and the Spaniards laid the  foundation of the city between these two, because, as it is assigned,  the stones in them were a great convenience in building, and economized  the labour of the Indians. These mounds were so large, it is added,  that with the stones the Spaniards built all the edifices in the city,  so that the ground which forms the plaza major remained nearly or quite  level. The buildings erected are specified, and it is added that there  was abundance of material for other edifices which the Spaniards wished  to erect.    Other mounds are mentioned as obstructing the laying out of streets  according to the plan proposed, and there is one circumstance which  bears directly upon this point, and, in my opinion, is conclusive.    In the history of the construction of the Franciscan convent, which was  founded in the year 1547, five years after the arrival of the Spaniards  in Tihoo, it is expressly stated that it was built upon a small  artificial mound, one of the many that were then in the place, on which  mound, it is added, were _some ancient buildings_. Now we must either  suppose that the Spaniards razed these buildings to the ground, and  then constructed this strange arch themselves, which supposition is, I  think, utterly untenable, or that this corridor formed part of the  ancient buildings which, according to the historical account, stood on  this artificial mound, and that for some purpose or other the monks  incorporated it with their convent.    There is but one way to overthrow this latter conclusion, and that is  by contending that these mounds were all ruined, and this building too,  at the time when it was made to form part of the convent; but then we  are reduced to the necessity of supposing that a great town, the fame  of which reached the Spaniards at Campeachy, and which made a desperate  and bloody resistance to their occupation of it, was a mere gathering  of hordes around the ruined buildings of another race; and, besides, it  is a matter of primary importance to note that these artificial mounds  are mentioned, not in the course of describing the Indian town, for no  description whatever is attempted, but merely incidentally, as  affording conveniences to the Spaniards in furnishing materials for  building the city, or as causing obstructions in the laying out of  streets regularly and according to the plan proposed. The mound on  which the convent stands would perhaps not have been mentioned at all  but for the circumstance that the Padre Cogolludo was a Franciscan  friar, and the mention of it enabled him to pay a tribute to the memory  of the blessed father Luis de Villpando, then superior of the convent,  and to show the great estimation in which he was held, for he says that  the adelantado had fixed upon this mound for the site of one of his  fortresses, but on the application of the superior he yielded it to him  readily for the site of the convent; and, more than all this, even in  the incidental way in which these mounds are referred to, there is one  circumstance which shows clearly that they were not at that time  disused and in ruins, but, on the contrary, were then in the actual use  and occupation of the Indians; for Cogolludo mentions particularly and  with much detail one that completely obstructed the running of a  particular street, which, he says, was called El grande de los Kues,  adoratorio que era de los idolos. Now the word \"Kues,\" in the Maya  language, as spoken by the Indians of Yucatan at the present day, means  their ancient places of worship, and the word \"adoratorio,\" as defined  in the Spanish dictionary, is the name given by the Spaniards to the  temples of idols in America. So that when the historian describes this  mound as El grande de los Kues el adoratorio de los idolos, he means to  say that it was the great one, or the greatest among the places of  worship of the Indians, or the temples of their idols.    It is called the \"great one\" of their places of worship, in  contradistinction to the small ones around, among which was that now  occupied by the Franciscan convent In my opinion, the solitary arch  found in this convent is very strong, if not conclusive, evidence that  all the ruined buildings scattered over Yucatan were erected by the  very Indians who occupied the country at the time of the Spanish  conquest, or, to fall back upon my old ground, that they were the work  \"of the same race of people,\" or \"their not very distant progenitors.\"    Who these races were, whence they came, or who were their progenitors,  I did not undertake to say, nor do I now.

But the reader must not suppose that our only business in Merida was  the investigation of antiquities; we had other operations in hand which  gave us plenty of employment. We had taken with us a Daguerreotype  apparatus, of which but one specimen had ever before appeared in  Yucatan. Great improvements had been since made in the instrument, and  we had reason to believe that ours was one of the best; and having  received assurances that we might do a large business in that line, we  were induced to set up as ladies' Daguerreotype portrait takers. It was  a new line for us, and rather venturesome, but not worse than for the  editor of a newspaper to turn captain of a steamboat; and, besides, it  was not like banking--we could not injure any one by a failure.    Having made trials upon ourselves until we were tired of the subjects,  and with satisfactory results, we considered ourselves sufficiently  advanced to begin; and as we intended to practice for the love of the  art, and not for lucre, we held that we had a right to select our  subjects. Accordingly, we had but to signify our wishes, and the next  morning put our house in order for the reception of our fair visiters.  We cleared everything out of the hammock, took the washhand basin off  the chair, and threw odds and ends into one corner; and as the sun was  pouring its rays warmly and brightly into our door, it was farther  lighted up by the entry of three young ladies, with their respective  papas and mammas. We had great difficulty in finding them all seats,  and were obliged to put the two mammas into the hammock together. The  young ladies were dressed in their prettiest costume, with earrings and  chains, and their hair adorned with flowers. All were pretty, and one  was much more than pretty; not in the style of Spanish beauty, with  dark eyes and hair, but a delicate and dangerous blonde, simple,  natural, and unaffected, beautiful without knowing it, and really  because she could not help it. Her name, too, was poetry itself. I am  bound to single her out, for, late on the evening of our departure from  Merida, she sent us a large cake, measuring about three feet in  circumference by six inches deep, which, by-the-way, everything being  packed up, I smothered into a pair of saddle-bags, and spoiled some of  my scanty stock of wearing apparel.
