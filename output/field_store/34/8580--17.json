He mingled with the stone-masons,  advising, helping, and giving counsel, till they pleaded with him  to rest. He was among the carpenters, sawing, hammering, enquiring,  suggesting, till they besought him to lay off. And he was night and day  with the architect's assistants, drawing, planning, revising, till the  architect told him to cut it out.    So great was his activity, that I doubt whether the new church would  ever have been finished, had not the wardens and the vestry men insisted  that Mr. Drone must take a holiday, and sent him on the Mackinaw trip up  the lakes,--the only foreign travel of the Dean's life.      So in due time the New Church was built and it towered above the maple  trees of Mariposa like a beacon on a hill. It stood so high that from  the open steeple of it, where the bells were, you could see all the  town lying at its feet, and the farmsteads to the south of it, and the  railway like a double pencil line, and Lake Wissanotti spread out like  a map. You could see and appreciate things from the height of the new  church,--such as the size and the growing wealth of Mariposa,--that you  never could have seen from the little stone church at all.    Presently the church was opened and the Dean preached his first sermon  in it, and he called it a Greater Testimony, and he said that it was an  earnest, or first fruit of endeavour, and that it was a token or pledge,  and he named it also a covenant. He said, too, that it was an anchorage  and a harbour and a lighthouse as well as being a city set upon a hill;  and he ended by declaring it an Ark of Refuge and notified them that  the Bible Class would meet in the basement of it on that and every other  third Wednesday.    In the opening months of preaching about it the Dean had called the  church so often an earnest and a pledge and a guerdon and a tabernacle,  that I think he used to forget that it wasn't paid for. It was only when  the agent of the building society and a representative of the Hosanna  Pipe and Steam Organ Co. (Limited), used to call for quarterly payments  that he was suddenly reminded of the fact. Always after these men came  round the Dean used to preach a special sermon on sin, in the course  of which he would mention that the ancient Hebrews used to put unjust  traders to death,--a thing of which he spoke with Christian serenity.    I don't think that at first anybody troubled much about the debt on the  church. Dean Drone's figures showed that it was only a matter of time  before it would be extinguished; only a little effort was needed,  a little girding up of the loins of the congregation and they could  shoulder the whole debt and trample it under their feet. Let them but  set their hands to the plough and they could soon guide it into the deep  water. Then they might furl their sails and sit every man under his own  olive tree.    Meantime, while the congregation was waiting to gird up its loins, the  interest on the debt was paid somehow, or, when it wasn't paid, was  added to the principal.    I don't know whether you have had any experience with Greater  Testimonies and with Beacons set on Hills. If you have, you will realize  how, at first gradually, and then rapidly, their position from year to  year grows more distressing. What with the building loan and the organ  instalment, and the fire insurance,--a cruel charge,--and the heat  and light, the rector began to realize as he added up the figures that  nothing but logarithms could solve them. Then the time came when not  only the rector, but all the wardens knew and the sidesmen knew that the  debt was more than the church could carry; then the choir knew and the  congregation knew and at last everybody knew; and there were special  collections at Easter and special days of giving, and special weeks of  tribulation, and special arrangements with the Hosanna Pipe and Steam  Organ Co. And it was noticed that when the Rural Dean announced a  service of Lenten Sorrow,--aimed more especially at the business  men,--the congregation had diminished by forty per cent.    I suppose things are just the same elsewhere,--I mean the peculiar kind  of discontent that crept into the Church of England congregation in  Mariposa after the setting up of the Beacon. There were those who  claimed that they had seen the error from the first, though they had  kept quiet, as such people always do, from breadth of mind. There were  those who had felt years before how it would end, but their lips were  sealed from humility of spirit. What was worse was that there were  others who grew dissatisfied with the whole conduct of the church.    Yodel, the auctioneer, for example, narrated how he had been to the city  and had gone into a service of the Roman Catholic church: I believe, to  state it more fairly, he had \"dropped in,\"--the only recognized means  of access to such a service. He claimed that the music that he had heard  there was music, and that (outside of his profession) the chanting and  intoning could not be touched.    Ed Moore, the photographer, also related that he had listened to a  sermon in the city, and that if anyone would guarantee him a sermon like  that he would defy you to keep him away from church. Meanwhile, failing  the guarantee, he stayed away.    The very doctrines were impeached. Some of the congregation began to  cast doubts on eternal punishment,--doubts so grave as to keep them  absent from the Lenten Services of Sorrow. Indeed, Lawyer Macartney took  up the whole question of the Athanasian Creed one afternoon with Joe  Milligan, the dentist, and hardly left a clause of it intact.    All this time, you will understand, Dean Drone kept on with his special  services, and leaflets, calls, and appeals went out from the Ark of  Gideon like rockets from a sinking ship. More and more with every month  the debt of the church lay heavy on his mind. At times he forgot it. At  other times he woke up in the night and thought about it. Sometimes  as he went down the street from the lighted precincts of the Greater  Testimony and passed the Salvation Army, praying around a naphtha lamp  under the open sky, it smote him to the heart with a stab.    But the congregation were wrong, I think, in imputing fault to the  sermons of Dean Drone. There I do think they were wrong. I can speak  from personal knowledge when I say that the rector's sermons were not  only stimulating in matters of faith, but contained valuable material  in regard to the Greek language, to modern machinery and to a variety  of things that should have proved of the highest advantage to the  congregation.    There was, I say, the Greek language. The Dean always showed the  greatest delicacy of feeling in regard to any translation in or out of  it that he made from the pulpit. He was never willing to accept even the  faintest shade of rendering different from that commonly given without  being assured of the full concurrence of the congregation. Either the  translation must be unanimous and without contradiction, or he could not  pass it. He would pause in his sermon and would say: \"The original Greek  is 'Hoson,' but perhaps you will allow me to translate it as equivalent  to 'Hoyon.'\" And they did. So that if there was any fault to be found it  was purely on the side of the congregation for not entering a protest at  the time.    It was the same way in regard to machinery. After all, what better  illustrates the supreme purpose of the All Wise than such a thing as  the dynamo or the reciprocating marine engine or the pictures in the  Scientific American?    Then, too, if a man has had the opportunity to travel and has seen the  great lakes spread out by the hand of Providence from where one leaves  the new dock at the Sound to where one arrives safe and thankful with  one's dear fellow-passengers in the spirit at the concrete landing stage  at Mackinaw--is not this fit and proper material for the construction  of an analogy or illustration? Indeed, even apart from an analogy, is it  not mighty interesting to narrate, anyway? In any case, why should the  church-wardens have sent the rector on the Mackinaw trip, if they had  not expected him to make some little return for it?    I lay some stress on this point because the criticisms directed  against the Mackinaw sermons always seemed so unfair. If the rector  had described his experiences in the crude language of the ordinary  newspaper, there might, I admit, have been something unfitting about it.  But he was always careful to express himself in a way that showed,--or,  listen, let me explain with an example.    \"It happened to be my lot some years ago,\" he would say, \"to find myself  a voyager, just as one is a voyager on the sea of life, on the broad  expanse of water which has been spread out to the north-west of us by  the hand of Providence, at a height of five hundred and eighty-one feet  above the level of the sea,--I refer, I may say, to Lake Huron.\" Now,  how different that is from saying: \"I'll never forget the time I went on  the Mackinaw trip.\" The whole thing has a different sound entirely. In  the same way the Dean would go on:    \"I was voyaging on one of those magnificent leviathans of the water,--I  refer to the boats of the Northern Navigation Company,--and was standing  beside the forward rail talking with a dear brother in the faith who was  journeying westward also--I may say he was a commercial traveller,--and  beside us was a dear sister in the spirit seated in a deck chair, while  near us were two other dear souls in grace engaged in Christian pastime  on the deck,--I allude more particularly to the game of deck billiards.\"    I leave it to any reasonable man whether, with that complete and  fair-minded explanation of the environment, it was not perfectly proper  to close down the analogy, as the rector did, with the simple words: \"In  fact, it was an extremely fine morning.\"    Yet"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35333"],[0,"Life of Heber C. Kimball, an Apostle (#15)"],[1,"come, we could not tell, but we sought the      Lord by fasting and prayer, to have our lives prolonged to see      this day, to see you, and to take a retrospect of the difficulties      through which we have passed. But having seen the day, it becomes      my duty to deliver to you a charge. And first, a few remarks      respecting your ministry. You have many revelations put into your      hands, revelations to make you acquainted with the nature of your      mission. You will have difficulties by reason of your visiting all      the nations of the world. You will need wisdom in a two-fold      proportion to what you have ever had. You will have to combat all      the prejudices of all nations.\" He then read the revelation and      proceeded to say, \"Have you desired this ministry with all your      hearts? If you have desired it, you are called of God, not of man,      to go into all the world.\" He read again from the revelation, what      the Lord said to the twelve brethren. \"You have your duty      presented in revelation. You have been ordained to the Holy      Priesthood. You have received it from those who had their power      and authority from an angel. You are to preach the Gospel to every      nation. Should you in the least degree come short of your duty,      great will be your condemnation, for the greater the calling, the      greater the transgression. I, therefore, warn you to cultivate      great humility, for I know the pride of the human heart. Beware      lest the flatterers of the world lift you up. Beware lest your      affections are captivated by worldly objects.        \"Let your ministry be first. Remember the souls of men are      committed to your charge, and if you mind your calling you shall      always prosper. You have been indebted to other men in the first      instance for evidence, on that you have acted. But it is necessary      that you receive a testimony from Heaven for yourselves, so that      you can bear testimony to the truth of the Book of Mormon, and      that you have seen the face of God; that is more than the      testimony of an angel. When the proper time arrives, you shall be      able to bear this testimony to the world. When you bear testimony      that you have seen God, this testimony God will never suffer to      fall, but will bear you out, although many will not give heed, yet      others will. You will therefore see the necessity of getting this      testimony from Heaven. Never cease striving until you have seen      God face to face. Strengthen your faith, cast off your doubts,      your sins and all your unbelief, and nothing can prevent you from      coming to God. Your ordination is not full and complete till God      has laid His hand upon you. We require as much to qualify us as      did those who have gone before us. God is the same. If the Savior      in former days laid His hands on His disciples, why not in the      latter days?        \"With regard to superiority I must make a few remarks. The ancient      Apostles sought to be great; but, brethren, lest the seeds of      discord be sown in this matter, understand the voice of the Spirit      on this occasion, God does not love you better or more than      others. You are to contend for the faith once delivered to the      Saints. Jacob, you know, wrestled till he obtained. It was by      fervent prayer and diligent search that you have obtained the      testimony that you are now able to bear. You are as one. You are      equal in bearing the keys of the kingdom to all nations.        \"You are called to preach the Gospel of the Son of God to the      nations of the earth. It is the will of your Heavenly Father that      you proclaim His Gospel to the ends of the earth and the islands      of the sea. Be zealous to save souls. The soul of one man is as      precious as the soul of another. You are to bear this message to      those who consider themselves wise, and such may persecute you;      they may seek your life. The adversary has always sought the lives      of the servants of God. You are, therefore, to be prepared at all      times to make a sacrifice of your lives, should the Lord require      them in the advancement and building up of His cause. Murmur not      at God. Be always prayerful, be always watchful. You will bear      with me while I relieve the feelings of my heart. We shall not see      another day like this. The time has fully come. The voice of the      Spirit has come to set these men apart. You will see the time when      you will desire to see such a day as this, and you will not see      it. Every heart wishes you peace and prosperity, but the scene      with you will inevitably change. Let no man take your Bishopric,      and beware that you lose not your crowns. It will require your      whole souls. It will require courage like Enoch's. The time is      near when you will be in the midst of congregations who will gnash      their teeth upon you. This Gospel must roll and will roll till it      fills the whole earth.        \"Did I say congregations would gnash upon you? Yea, I say nations      will gnash upon you. You will be considered the worst of men. Be      not discouraged at this. When God pours out His Spirit the enemy      will rage, but God, remember, is on your right hand and on your      left. A man, though he may be considered the worst, has joy who is      conscious that he pleases God. The lives of those who proclaim the      true Gospel will be in danger. This has been the case ever since      the days of righteous Abel.        \"The same opposition has been manifest whenever men came forward      to publish the Gospel. The time is coming when you will be      considered the worst by many, and by some the best of men. The      time is coming when you will be perfectly familiar with the things      of God. This testimony will make those who do not believe your      testimony, seek your lives. But there are whole nations who will      receive your testimony. They will call you good men. Be not lifted      up when you are called good men. Remember you are young men, and      you shall be spared. I include the other three. Bear them in mind      in your prayers, carry their cares to a throne of grace. Although      they are not present yet you and they are equal.        \"This appointment is calculated to create an affection in you, for      each other, stronger than death. You will travel to other nations.      Bear each other in mind. If one or more is cast into prison, let      the others pray for him and deliver him by their prayers.        \"Your lives shall be in great jeopardy, but the promise of God is      that you shall be delivered. Remember you are not to go to other      nations till you receive your endowment. Tarry at Kirtland until      you are endowed with power from on high. You need a fountain of      wisdom, knowledge and intelligence such as you never had. Relative      to the endowment, I make a remark or two, that there be no      mistake. The world cannot receive the things of God. He can endow      you without worldly pomp or great parade. He can give you that      wisdom, that intelligence and that power which characterized the      ancient Saints and now characterizes the inhabitants of the upper      world. The greatness of your commission consists in this; you are      to hold the keys of this ministry. You are to go to the nations      afar off; nations that sit in darkness. The day is coming when the      work of God must be done. Israel shall be gathered. The seed of      Jacob shall be gathered from their long dispersion. There will be      a feast to Israel the elect of God. It is a sorrowful tale, but      the Gospel must be preached and His (God's) ministers be rejected,      but where can Israel be found, and receive your testimony and not      rejoice? Nowhere. The prophecies are full of great things that are      to take place in the last days. After the elect is gathered out,      destruction shall come on the inhabitants of the earth. All      nations shall feel the wrath of God after they have been warned by      the Saints of the Most High. If you will not warn them others will      and you will lose your crowns. You must prepare your minds to bid      a long farewell to Kirtland, even till the great day come. You      will see what you never expected to see. You will need the mind of      Enoch or Elijah and the faith of the brother of Jared. You must be      prepared to walk by faith, however appalling the prospect to human      view. You, and each of you should feel the force of the imperious      mandate. Son, go labor in my vineyard, and cheerfully receive what      comes, but in the end you will stand while others will fall. You      have read in the revelation concerning ordination. Beware how you      ordain, for all nations are not like this nation. They will      willingly receive the ordinances at your hand to put you out of      the way. There will be times, when nothing but the angels of God      can deliver you out of their hand. We appeal to your intelligence,      we appeal to your understanding, that we have so far discharged      our duty to you. We consider it one of the greatest condescensions      of our Heavenly Father in pointing you out to us. You will be      stewards over this ministry.        \"We have work to do that no other men can do. You must proclaim      the Gospel in its simplicity and purity, and we commend you to God      and the word of His grace. You have our best wishes, you have our      most fervent prayers that you may be able to bear this testimony,      that you have seen the face of God. Therefore call upon Him in      faith and mighty prayer till you prevail, for it is your duty and      your privilege to bear such testimony for yourselves. We now      expect you to be faithful, to fulfill your calling, there must be      no lack here. You must fulfill in all "]]]
