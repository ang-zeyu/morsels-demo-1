But after the death of the apostles, these several  branches seem to be considered separate and independent organizations,  united in faith and charity, it is true, but in nothing more. There  is no evidence that there was such a thing as subordination among the  churches, or rank among the bishops. As might be expected, however,  there was a peculiar respect paid to the churches founded by the  apostles. Those churches were appealed to in controversies on points  of doctrine, as most likely to know what the apostles taught, but the  appeal had no other significance. This equality of rank among the  bishops, together with the simple form of church government, described  above, was soon changed. The bishops who lived in cities, either by  their own labors or those of the elders associated with them, raised up  new churches in the adjacent villages and hamlets. The bishops of these  rural districts being nominated and ordained by the bishops presiding  in the cities, very naturally felt themselves under the protection and  dependent upon the city bishops. This idea continued to grow until  these bishops of \"the suburbs and the fields\" were looked upon as a  distinct order of officers, possessing a dignity and authority above  the elders, and yet subordinate to the bishops of the cities who,  wherever they presided over bishops in outlying districts, soon came to  be designated as archbishops.    Gradually, and perhaps almost imperceptibly, the church in the west  in its government followed the civil divisions of the Roman empire.  The bishop of the metropolis of a civil province, in time came to be  regarded as having a general supervision of all the churches in that  province, and soon it became the custom to style them metropolitans.    The bishops of the great cities of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria,  and Antioch, after the ascension of Constantine, were made to  correspond to the four praetorian prefects created by Constantine in  the civil government; and before the end of the fourth century received  the title of patriarchs. [12] It is also said by Mosheim, though denied  by other writers, that next to the patriarchs were bishops whose  jurisdiction extended over several provinces and corresponded to the  civil exarchs; next came the metropolitan bishops whose jurisdiction,  as already stated, was limited to a single province, and corresponded  to the governor of the provinces. The arch-bishops presided over a  district including several bishoprics within a province; and lastly  came the bishops of churches.    Concurrent with these changes arose the custom, first derived from the  Greeks, of holding provincial councils. The bishops living in a single  province met in council to confer upon mattes of common interest to  their churches. At first the attending bishops looked upon themselves  as merely the representatives of their respective churches, without  further jurisdiction than to discuss and come to agreement on matters  of common concern. But gradually they usurped the power to order by  decree where at first they were wont to advise or entreat. Nor was it  long ere the decrees of these provincial councils were forced upon the  respective churches as laws to be implicitly obeyed.    There was some resistance to this from the lower clergy, but it was  quickly overcome by the activity and ambition of the bishops, who were  only too glad to escape the restraints imposed upon their movements by  the doctrine of common consent. It is said also that as many changes  occurred among the lower order of the clergy as among the bishops.  The elders and deacons aping the conduct of their file leaders became  too proud to attend to the humble duties of their offices, and hence  a number of other officers were added to the church--subdeacons,  acolythi, ostiarii, lectors, exorcists and copiatae [13]--while the  elders and deacons spent much of their time in indolence and pleasure.    If the ambition of rival bishops distracted the church in the second  and third centuries, much more did ambitious prelates--patriarchs  and metropolitans--of the fourth and fifth centuries disturb its  tranquility. They contended about the limits of their respective  jurisdiction with all the bitterness of temporal kings seeking an  enlargement of their dominions. They made conquests and reprisals  upon each other in much the same spirit, and at times were not above  resorting to violence to attain their ends. It soon happened that  the patriarchs of Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem sank below their  fellow patriarchs of Rome and Constantinople in wealth and dignity. The  prelates of these latter cities fiercely contended for the title of  universal bishop; and in that contest the bishop of Constantinople was  not always unsuccessful.    Over the protest of Leo the Great, in the fifth century, the council of  Chalcedon decreed that the bishop of \"New Rome\" ought to enjoy the same  honors and prerogatives with the pontiff of ancient Rome, on account of  the equal rank and dignity of the two cities. In the following century,  encouraged by past successes the bishop of \"New Rome,\"--John, surnamed  the Faster, because of the austerity of his life, assembled a council  of eastern bishops on his own account, to decide on charges brought  against the patriarch of Antioch. It was on this occasion that he made  such an assumption of the title of acumenical or universal bishop, that  Gregory the Great supposed him to be aiming at a supremacy over all the  Christian churches. In spite of the opposition of Gregory, the Faster,  sustained by the emperor, continued to wear the title, though, it is  said, not in the sense that Gregory supposed. The contest continued  from this time forward with little interruption until that fatal  schism came between the east and the west with which the reader has  already been made acquainted. [14] The patriarchs of New Rome retained  their hold upon the east; but the decay, moral and spiritual, which  blighted those churches steadily went on, until at the last, Mohammedan  civilization displaced Christian civilization. The crescent rose  triumphantly above the cross, and the east sank into a settled gloom  out of which it has not yet been able to rise.    In the west it was otherwise. There all was activity. The Roman  pontiffs not only sent their missionaries to the barbarians to preach  the supremacy of the popes, but the barbarians came to Rome. They came  with arms in their hands and as conquerors, it is true, and in the  closing years of the fifth century obtained an easy victory over the  western division of the empire. But if imperial Rome was vanquished,  there arose above its ruins papal Rome, in majesty no less splendid  than that possessed by imperial Rome in her palmiest days; and in the  course of time the victorious barbarians bowed in as humble submission  to the wand of the popes, as their ancestors had to the eagle-mounted  standard of the emperors. Moreover, the barbarous nations that fell  under the influence of the Roman missionaries were accustomed to hold  their priests in a superstitious reverence. In portions of Western  Europe the Druid priests had reigned over both people and magistrates,  controlling absolutely the jurisdiction of the latter; and, in the  case of the supreme priest, according to some authorities, [15] the  reverence of the barbarians amounted to worship. This reverence,  on their conversion to Christianity, was readily transferred to  the supreme pontiff of the Catholic Church; and made possible that  spiritual and temporal despotism before which monarchs trembled and the  world stood in abject fear.    Having traced the rise of the Church of Rome to this point, it yet  remains to say that the corruption of her clergy and members kept pace  with the developing splendor of the hierarchy. The pride, ambition and  wickedness which bishops and other ministers of the church practiced  in the second and third centuries have already been pointed out, and  at the same time it was suggested that in these matters there was not  likely to be any improvement after ease and luxury--ever the panderers  to immorality--had increased the appetite for sensual pleasures and  supplied the means of gratification.    Early in the history of the church the morality of the times not only  excused but justified lying and deceit whenever it was supposed that  the interests of religion could be promoted by it; and hence the  existence of that mass of childish fable and falsehood respecting  the infancy and youth of Messiah, and the wonder-working power of  the relics of the saints and martyrs which has brought the Christian  religion into contempt. Not even the greatest and most pious teachers  of the first five or six centuries are free from this leprosy; [16] and  if such characters as Ambrose, Hilary, Augustine, Gregory Nazianzen,  and Jerome are not free from it, how much more may we expect to find it  a vice with men of less reputation!    The attempt to live in a state of celibacy gave rise to many scandals  in the church. Ambitious of a peculiar sanctity, the clergy began  to abstain from marriage, but not from the pleasures supposed to be  peculiar to the married state. It became the custom for the priests  to live with \"sub-introduced women,\" who \"passed as sisters of the  priests, the correctness of whose taste was often exemplified by the  remarkable beauty of their sinful partners.\" [17] It is only fair to  say that a law of Honorius condemned this practice, but it is to be  feared that the only effect of the law upon those undertaking to live  in the unnatural condition which celibacy imposes was merely to drive  the practice from the public gaze.

This mania for Grangerizing grew till it assumed enormous proportions.  One enthusiast tried to illustrate Rees' 'Cyclopaedia,' but died before  he had accomplished very much in comparison with what remained to be  done. Mr. Crowle's copy of Pennant's 'History of London' cost that  gentleman L7,000 from first to last, and there is a book of this kind in  the Bodleian which has engulfed nearly double that amount.  It consists  of Clarendon's 'History of the Rebellion' swollen to sixty-seven large  volumes, representing forty years of intense application.  The vagaries  of a whole army of book-collectors are reflected from every page of  works such as these, for a man must necessarily be a book-collector  first, and a Grangerizer after, else would material fail him.  Happily  for the peace of books, the mania for extra-illustrating has practically  died out.  The expense is too great, life too short, the knowledge and  taste--of a kind--too laborious to acquire, to endow this pastime with a  permanent and stable interest.    And yet there is another vagary, eccentricity, freak, or what you will,  which, for cool, deliberate folly, has never been equalled even among  Ferrar's admirers.  The fun in this case consists in wilfully destroying  a certain number of scarce and valuable books in order to heighten the  importance and value of the survivors.  Three or four collectors whose  tastes are similar--that is to say, who accumulate works by the same  author--will take stock of their belongings.  Thanks to the  Grangerizers, a portrait will perhaps be missing from one volume, and a  plate from another; some disciple of an ancient Goth may have removed a  title-page or two; one copy may be fairer to look upon than another; a  leaf or two may be injured which in another copy, imperfect perhaps in  other respects, may be above suspicion.  Our collectors have duplicates,  for they have been striving all their lives to prevent anyone else from  obtaining any copy, good, bad or indifferent, of the scarcest works of  the author or authors they think they honour by their notice. They make  a 'pool' of all the volumes which are not immaculate; complete or  perfect as many of them as possible, apportion them, and destroy the  remainder.  They will burn a work which is perfect, provided each has a  copy in better condition, and this is to prevent you or me, or anyone  else, from sharing in their sacrilegious joy.  When we reflect that,  from the nature of things, it is only the scarcest books that can be so  treated with effect, we shall begin to realize the sinister importance  of the act.  Practices such as these are the product of the present age;  they are not common, far from it, but they are not unusual.  And yet the  perpetrators mean no harm, for, as they would very truly say, if their  practices were generally known and complaint were made, 'You can, if you  like, read So-and-so without the least difficulty, for his works have  been reprinted many times, and it is not either essential or advisable  that the very scarcest edition of all should be in your hands.'  There  is in this argument a little logical force, but no decency for anyone to  dissect.    Bookmen of the present day, or at least those among them who aspire to  the highest seats in the collectors' Pantheon, are invariably bound by  rule, and it is this hard and fast bondage that makes them do things  which, if left to themselves, they would probably be the first to  deprecate. To accumulate any considerable number of really scarce books  is the labour of a lifetime, and to obtain immaculate copies  necessitates not merely the possession of plenty of money, but a very  great deal of energy, discrimination, and tact. The old school of  general lovers is dying out. People now very seldom buy up whole  libraries, or send out colossal orders to gratify a mere love of  possession.  They work by the book of arithmetic, cautiously, slowly,  and with one main object ever in view.  In this they are right, but in  this also they fail, a paradox which is no paradox at all when it is  remembered that book-hunters are of many kinds and of varying degrees of  intelligence.    For instance, though there is undoubtedly something unique and strange  about the very appearance of a library of extremely diminutive books,  the collector of works of this kind is 'cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd,'  within the compass of about two square inches at the most, and probably  does not expect to derive either instruction or amusement from their  pages when he has succeeded in reading them with the aid of a  microscope.  His rule is inflexible.  Shakespeare in folio must give  place to 'The Mite'; 'The English Bijou Almanac' for 1837 is, in his  eyes one of the choicest of all volumes.  Here literature and the rule  are in conflict, and books become bric-a-brac, as they must do when any  rule is too rigidly applied to them.  Yet there are many collectors of  small books both here and abroad, and prices rule inordinately high in  consequence.    Very probably 'The Mite' is the smallest book printed from movable type  in the world.  Its size is only 3/8 in. by 3/4 in., and it would  certainly be an exceedingly difficult matter to reduce this measurement.  If anybody could do so, it would be M. Salomon of Paris, who has long  been a collector of these microscopical curiosities, or the trustees of  the British Museum, who have a box full of them.  In 1781 a little book  called the 'Alarm Almanac' made its appearance in Paris, and though  printed with movable type and not engraved, like nearly all these little  works are, measured only 19 millimetres by 14.  There are very nearly  25-1/2 millimetres to the inch, and this specimen consequently runs 'The  Mite' very close indeed.  The 'English Bijou Almanac' for 1837, however,  completely eclipses both, but unfortunately it is engraved and not  printed from type. This book measures 3/4 in. in height, 1/2 in. wide,  and 1/8 in. in thickness.  The authoress was 'L.E.L.,' Letitia Elizabeth  Landon, an almost forgotten poetess, whose sad marriage and untimely  death are known to only a few students of Victorian literature.  Some of  her poems were printed in the 'Bijou' for the first and only time, so  that this tiny volume is of some literary importance.  Its title is so  minute that a magnifying glass is necessary to read it.  Its  thirty-seven leaves are devoted, _inter alia_, to several pages of music  and some portraits, including one of James Fenimore Cooper, the  novelist.  Even small books have a history and an importance of their  own, but to collect them to the exclusion of every other book is surely  a pronounced 'vagary.'    M. Salomon has more than 200 specimens, but then he does not absolutely  confine his attention to midgets.  I never knew nor heard of more than  one collector who was so infatuated as to do so, and he had forty-five  volumes of the kind, all different, in which he took such extreme  delight that he was ever on the look out for more.    Another collector with whom I am personally acquainted has read this  chapter through at my express request, and consequently cannot  reasonably say that I have endeavoured to question the soundness of his  discretion behind his back.  He accumulates books with a history.  If a  book has no history, he will have none of it.  In his library are many  volumes which I must confess I have a great regard for, but which I know  can never be mine, for each is unique, and the whole collection is  destined for a public museum in the end.    He has a book bound in what looks like dry and hard parchment, warped  with damp, and stained here and there with reddish brown.  It is a copy  of Johnson's 'Lives and Adventures of the most Famous Highwaymen,  Murderers, and Street Robbers, etc.,' printed in folio in 1736, a scarce  book at any time, but under existing circumstances past praying for.  The parchment is human cuticle, stripped from the back of a criminal who  had swung at Tyburn for a series of atrocious butcheries, which are  chronicled with considerable minuteness in the pages of the 'Newgate  Calendar.'  When the corpse was cut down it was, according to the custom  then prevailing, carted 'home,' and exhibited to gaping crowds at so  much a head, and finally sold to the surgeons. From them a prior owner  of this delightful volume obtained the skin, which, when tanned, formed  an appropriate and never-to-be-forgotten binding, to all appearances  sweating great smears of blood. It is only the damp, of course, or  perhaps some defect in the curing process, which is responsible for  these blemishes; but they seem to cry for vengeance, still greater and  greater vengeance, against an inhuman wretch long since departed more or  less in peace.    This is the only gruesome thing in the library, and I know as a fact  that it excites more interest than all the rest of the books put  together, though many, not to say most, of them are distinctly worthy of  the closest attention.  One volume belonged to Charles Lamb, who has  made a perfect wreck of it, and half a dozen or more have the signature  of 'Will Shakespere' scribbled in an Elizabethan hand on the  title-pages, and in all sorts of places.  These were once among the  choicest possessions of Samuel Ireland, of Norfolk Street, Strand, the  father of William Henry Ireland, a liar and a solicitor's clerk, who, as  all the world knows, was for a time, and in very truth, mistaken for the  great dramatist himself. Then there are books with inscriptions,  undoubtedly genuine, of Bradshaw the regicide, Algernon Sidney, and many  other persons of the highest political eminence in their day; books,  too, which have belonged to Young the poet--distinguishable at a glance  by the multitude of turned-down leaves--and the"]]]
