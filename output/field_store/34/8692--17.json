Four years and a half from this date the war-cry of  \"Bentivoglio\" again rang through these streets; the same mob strained  their brawny sinews to level the citadel which Julius had erected  to curb them, and to shatter the colossal statue of him with which  Michael Angelo had adorned their piazza; the same Pontiff saved  himself from capture, and his legate escaped from the popular fury  to fall by the dagger of a friend. Such are the retributions of  HIM \"whose ways are unsearchable, and whose thoughts are  past finding out.\"[25]    [Footnote 24: In the same feeling, though of later date, a copy of  Raffaele's speaking portrait of his Holiness, now in the Torlonia  Gallery, and attributed to Giulio Romano, is inscribed, \"The author  of freedom, for the citizens he saved.\" This conquest became a  triumph of art as well as of arms; the colossal statue of Julius,  begun by Michael Angelo in Nov. 1506, was erected in February, 1508.  It weighed 17,500 lb. of bronze, and cost about 12,000 golden ducats,  of which 1000 went to the artist.]    [Footnote 25: See ch. xxxiii. of this work.]    The Pope remained until late in February to settle his new conquest,  keeping the Duke near him as a friend and counsellor, and on the  3rd of March, in defiance of the inclement season, repeated his  visit to Urbino for one day, with a smaller company, while on his  return to Rome. His host, after conveying him as far as Cagli on the  5th, pleaded his constitutional malady, and returned home with the  Prefect. As this was the period selected by Count Castiglione for  portraying the ducal court, it will be well to pause for a little,  and consider the representation he has left us of it.          CHAPTER XXI         The Court of Urbino, its manners and its stars.      The taste for philosophy, letters, and arts, and the patronage of  their professors which Cosimo de' Medici and his son Lorenzo the  Magnificent had introduced among the merchant-rulers of Florence,  were, as we have already seen, adopted by several petty sovereigns of  the Peninsula, but chiefly by those in the district of Romagna.[26]  Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta was the first to engraft these fruits  of peace upon a military despotism, which his restless ambition and  fierce temper ever rendered the torment of his neighbours, and the  scourge of his people. The d'Este of Ferrara, the Sforza of Pesaro,  but, above all, Duke Federigo of Urbino, improving upon his example,  had shown how mental cultivation might be brought to modify, or, as  the Latin idiom has it, to humanise, without enervating, a martial  character. The reign of Guidobaldo was peculiarly favourable to  the development of this new and attractive principle; for though  enabled partially to sustain the fame in arms which his father had  bequeathed him, his feeble health gave him greater opportunity for  the cultivation of letters, and for the society of the learned,  to which he was naturally partial. Seconded by the sympathies of  his estimable Duchess, his palace became a resort of the first  literary and political celebrities of the day, who during the few  years that succeeded his restoration, diffused over it a tone of  refinement elsewhere unrivalled. To fix for the contemplation of  posterity those graceful but transient images which flitted across  this gay and brilliant society was the pleasing task undertaken by  Castiglione,[*27] one of its most polished ornaments.

And as the fragrant influence  continued fresh upon my mind of the deceased Duke's virtues, and of  the pleasure I had for some years enjoyed in the amiable society of  the excellent persons who then frequented his court, I was induced  from these reflections to write a treatise of THE COURTIER.  This I accomplished in a few days, with the intention of subsequently  correcting the errors incidental to so hasty a composition.\"    [Footnote *28: In the _Lettera Dedicatoria_. Cf. Ed. Cian, _op.  cit._, p. 4.]    [Footnote *29: This is the opening of the _Lettera Dedicatoria_ to  Don Michel de Silva, Bishop of Viseo.]    [Illustration: _Alinari_    PORTRAIT OF A LADY, HER HAIR DRESSED IN THE MANNER OF THE FIFTEENTH  CENTURY    _From the picture by ? Verrocchio [Transcriber's Note: now attributed  to Piero del Pollaiolo] in Poldo-Pezzoli Collection, Milan_]    The point which he undertakes is \"to state what I consider the  courtiership most befitting a gentleman in attendance on princes,  whereby he may best be taught and enabled to perform towards them all  seemly service, so as to obtain their favour and general applause; to  explain, in short, what a courtier in all respects perfect ought to  be.\"[*30]    [Footnote *30: Opening paragraph of first book. Ed. Cian, p. 11.]    We cannot here follow the Count into the wide field which he thus  indicates, nor is it necessary, since his own work is accessible in  several languages. But from various passages we may offer a sketch of  the manners approved at the pattern court of Urbino, which will not  be deemed misplaced in these pages. The men who figured there were  chiefly distinguished in arms or letters. Whilst the former spent  their leisure in recollections of war and love, or in the congenial  pastimes of the field and the chase, the conversation of the  latter was often warped towards scholastic disputation, or tainted  by classic pedantry. Such manners have often been described, and  their interest has long passed away; but in a society where female  influence prevailed, and in an age when female intellect was fruitful  in prodigies, it may be well to see what were the graces expected  from a palace-dame.[*31]    [Footnote *31: Concerning Elisabetta Gonzaga. Cf. LUZIO E  RENIER, _Mantova e Urbino, Isabella d'Este, ed Elisabetta  Gonzaga_ (Torino, 1893).]    At the head of a string of common-place endowments we find a noble  bearing, an avoidance of affectation, a natural grace in every  action. Beauty is considered as most desirable, not indispensable;  and its improvement by such artificial means as painting and  enamelling the face, extirpating hairs on the eyebrows or forehead,  is derided. White teeth and hands are fully appreciated, but  their frequent display is censured. A neat _chaussure_ is lauded,  especially when veiled by long draperies. In short, natural elegance  and the absence of artifice are primary qualifications. A high-born  lady must be circumspect even beyond suspicion, avoiding ill-timed  familiarity, and all freedom of language verging upon licence; but  when casually exposed to discussions tending to pruriency, a modest  blush would be becoming, whilst shrinking or prudery might expose her  to sneers. Willingly to listen to or repeat slander of her own sex  is a fatal error, which will always be harshly construed by men. Her  accomplishments and amusements should ever be selected with feminine  delicacy, verging upon timidity; her dress chosen in tasteful  reference to what is most becoming, but with apparent absence of  study. In conversing with men she should be frank, affable, and  lively; but modest, staid, and self-possessed, with a nice observance  of tact and decorum. Noisy hilarity, a hoyden address, egotism,  prolixity, and the unseasonable combination of serious with ludicrous  topics are equally objectionable, but most of all affectation. Yet  she ought to be witty, capable of varied conversation in literature,  music, and painting, skilled in dancing and festive games. Nor should  that of a good housewife be wanting to her other qualities. In short,  the theory of a paragon lady of the 1500 might equally suit for one  of the present day. We should come to a very different conclusion  as to her real character, were we to test it by some passages of  the _Cortegiano_, wherein the Duchess Elisabetta, in chastity the  mirror of her age, listens approvingly with her courtly dames to long  passages of prurient twaddle, ever skirting and often overstepping  the limits of decency. Nor were the morals around her conformable to  her own pure example, and that of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/443"],[0,"The Love Affairs of a Bibliomaniac (#15)"],[1,"we shall go together  through green pastures and by still waters.  And, O my pen, it will be  the springtime again!        XIII    ON THE ODORS WHICH MY BOOKS EXHALE    Have you ever come out of the thick, smoky atmosphere of the town into  the fragrant, gracious atmosphere of a library?  If you have, you know  how grateful the change is, and you will agree with me when I say that  nothing else is so quieting to the nerves, so conducive to physical  health, and so quick to restore a lively flow of the spirits.    Lafcadio Hearn once wrote a treatise upon perfumes, an ingenious and  scholarly performance; he limited the edition to fifty copies and  published it privately--so the book is rarely met with. Curiously  enough, however, this author had nothing to say in the book about the  smells of books, which I regard as a most unpardonable error, unless,  properly estimating the subject to be worthy  of a separate treatise,  he has postponed its consideration and treatment to a time when he can  devote the requisite study and care to it.    We have it upon the authority of William Blades that books breathe;  however, the testimony of experts is not needed upon this point, for if  anybody be sceptical, all he has to do to convince himself is to open a  door of a bookcase at any time and his olfactories will be greeted by  an outrush of odors that will prove to him beyond all doubt that books  do actually consume air and exhale perfumes.    Visitors to the British Museum complain not unfrequently that they are  overcome by the closeness of the atmosphere in that place, and what is  known as the British Museum headache has come to be recognized by the  medical profession in London as a specific ailment due to the absence  of oxygen in the atmosphere, which condition is caused by the multitude  of books, each one of which, by that breathing process peculiar to  books, consumes several thousand cubic feet of air every twenty-four  hours.    Professor Huxley wondered for a long time why the atmosphere of the  British Museum should be poisonous while other libraries were free from  the poison; a series of experiments convinced him that the presence of  poison in the atmosphere was due to the number of profane books in the  Museum.  He recommended that these poison-engendering volumes be  treated once every six months with a bath of cedria, which, as I  understand, is a solution of the juices of the cedar tree; this, he  said, would purge the mischievous volumes temporarily of their evil  propensities and abilities.    I do not know whether this remedy is effective, but I remember to have  read in Pliny that cedria was used by the ancients to render their  manuscripts imperishable.  When Cneius Terentius went digging in his  estate in the Janiculum he came upon a coffer which contained not only  the remains of Numa, the old Roman king, but also the manuscripts of  the famous laws which Numa compiled. The king was in some such  condition as you might suppose him to be after having been buried  several centuries,  but the manuscripts were as fresh as new, and their  being so is said to have been due to the fact that before their burial  they were rubbed with citrus leaves.    These so-called books of Numa would perhaps have been preserved unto  this day but for the fanaticism of the people who exhumed and read  them; they were promptly burned by Quintus Petilius, the praetor,  because (as Cassius Hemina explains) they treated of philosophical  subjects, or because, as Livy testifies, their doctrines were inimical  to the religion then existing.    As I have had little to do with profane literature, I know nothing of  the habits of such books as Professor Huxley has prescribed an antidote  against.  Of such books as I have gathered about me and made my  constant companions I can say truthfully that a more  delectable-flavored lot it were impossible to find. As I walk amongst  them, touching first this one and then that, and regarding all with  glances of affectionate approval, I fancy that I am walking in a  splendid garden, full of charming vistas, wherein parterre after  parterre of beautiful flowers is  unfolded to my enraptured vision; and  surely there never were other odors so delightful as the odors which my  books exhale!        My garden aboundeth in pleasant nooks        And fragrance is over it all;    For sweet is the smell of my old, old books        In their places against the wall.      Here is a folio that's grim with age        And yellow and green with mould;    There's the breath of the sea on every page        And the hint of a stanch ship's hold.      And here is a treasure from France la belle        Exhaleth a faint perfume    Of wedded lily and asphodel        In a garden of song abloom.      And this wee little book of Puritan mien        And rude, conspicuous print    Hath the Yankee flavor of wintergreen,        Or, may be, of peppermint.      In Walton the brooks a-babbling tell        Where the cheery daisy grows,    And where in meadow or woodland dwell        The buttercup and the rose.      But best beloved of books, I ween,        Are those which one perceives    Are hallowed by ashes dropped between        The yellow, well-thumbed leaves.      For it's here a laugh and it's there a tear,        Till the treasured book is read;    And the ashes betwixt the pages here        Tell us of one long dead.      But the gracious presence reappears        As we read the book again,    And the fragrance of precious, distant years        Filleth the hearts of men      Come, pluck with me in my garden nooks        The posies that bloom for all;    Oh, sweet is the smell of my old, old books        In their places against the wall!      Better than flowers are they, these books of mine!  For what are the  seasons to them?  Neither can the drought of summer nor the asperity of  winter wither or change them.  At all times and under all circumstances  they are the same--radiant, fragrant, hopeful, helpful!  There is no  charm which they do not possess, no beauty that is not theirs.    What wonder is it that from time immemorial humanity has craved the  boon of carrying to the grave some book particularly beloved in life?  Even Numa Pompilius provided that his books should share his tomb with  him.  Twenty-four of these precious volumes were consigned with him to  the grave.  When Gabriel Rossetti's wife died, the poet cast into her  open grave the unfinished volume of his poems, that being the last and  most precious tribute he could pay to her cherished memory.    History records instance after instance of the consolation dying men  have received from the perusal of books, and many a one has made his  end holding in his hands a particularly beloved volume. The reverence  which even unlearned men have for books appeals in these splendid  libraries which are erected now and again with funds provided by the  wills of the illiterate.  How dreadful must be the last moments of that  person who has steadfastly refused to share the companionship and  acknowledge the saving grace of books!    Such, indeed, is my regard for these friendships that it is with misery  that I contemplate  the probability of separation from them by and by.  I have given my friends to understand that when I am done with earth  certain of my books shall be buried with me. The list of these books  will be found in the left-hand upper drawer of the old mahogany  secretary in the front spare room.                When I am done,             I'd have no son    Pounce on these treasures like a vulture;             Nay, give them half             My epitaph    And let them share in my sepulture.              Then when the crack             Of doom rolls back    The marble and the earth that hide me,             I'll smuggle home             Each precious tome    Without a fear a wife shall chide me.      The dread of being separated by death from the objects of one's love  has pursued humanity from the beginning.  The Hindoos used to have a  selfish fashion of requiring their widows to be entombed alive with  their corpses.  The North American Indian insists that his horse, his  bow and arrows, his spear, and his other cherished trinkets shall share  his grave with him.    My sister, Miss Susan, has provided that after her demise a number of  her most prized curios shall be buried with her.  The list, as I recall  it, includes a mahogany four-post bedstead, an Empire dresser, a brass  warming-pan, a pair of brass andirons, a Louis Quinze table, a  Mayflower teapot, a Tomb of Washington platter, a pewter tankard, a  pair of her grandmother's candlesticks, a Paul Revere lantern, a tall  Dutch clock, a complete suit of armor purchased in Rome, and a  collection of Japanese bric-a-brac presented to Miss Susan by a  returned missionary.    I do not see what Miss Susan can possibly do with all this trumpery in  the hereafter, but, if I survive her, I shall certainly insist upon a  compliance with her wishes, even though it involve the erection of a  tumulus as prodigious as the pyramid of Cheops.        XIV    ELZEVIRS AND DIVERS OTHER MATTERS    Boswell's \"Life of Johnson\" and Lockhart's \"Life of Scott\" are accepted  as the models of biography.  The third remarkable performance in this  line is Mrs. Gordon's memoir of her father, John Wilson, a volume so  charmingly and tenderly written as to be of interest to those even who  know and care little about that era in the history of English  literature in which \"crusty Christopher\" and his associates in the  making of \"Blackwood's\" figured.    It is a significant fact, I think, that the three greatest biographers  the world has known should have been Scotch; it has long been the  fashion to laugh and to sneer at what is called Scotch dulness; yet  what prodigies has not Scotch genius performed  in every department of  literature, and would not our literature be poor indeed to-day but for  the"]]]
