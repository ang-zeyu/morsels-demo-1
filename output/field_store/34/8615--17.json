They struggled for a century, but they  struggled against property and they were beat. As long as the monks  existed, the people, when aggrieved, had property on their side. And  now 'tis all over,\" said the stranger; \"and travellers come and stare at  these ruins, and think themselves very wise to moralize over time. They  are the children of violence, not of time. It is war that created these  ruins, civil war, of all our civil wars the most inhuman, for it was  waged with the unresisting. The monasteries were taken by storm, they  were sacked, gutted, battered with warlike instruments, blown up with  gunpowder; you may see the marks of the blast against the new tower  here. Never was such a plunder. The whole face of the country for a  century was that of a land recently invaded by a ruthless enemy; it was  worse than the Norman conquest; nor has England ever lost this character  of ravage. I don't know whether the union workhouses will remove it.  They are building something for the people at last. After an experiment  of three centuries, your gaols being full, and your treadmills losing  something of their virtue, you have given us a substitute for the  monasteries.\"    \"You lament the old faith,\" said Egremont, in a tone of respect.    \"I am not viewing the question as one of faith,\" said the stranger.  \"It is not as a matter of religion, but as a matter of right, that I am  considering it: as a matter, I should say, of private right and public  happiness. You might have changed if you thought fit the religion of the  abbots as you changed the religion of the bishops: but you had no right  to deprive men of their property, and property moreover which under  their administration so mainly contributed to the welfare of the  community.\"    \"As for community,\" said a voice which proceeded neither from Egremont  nor the stranger, \"with the monasteries expired the only type that we  ever had in England of such an intercourse. There is no community in  England; there is aggregation, but aggregation under circumstances which  make it rather a dissociating, than an uniting, principle.\"    It was a still voice that uttered these words, yet one of a peculiar  character; one of those voices that instantly arrest attention: gentle  and yet solemn, earnest yet unimpassioned. With a step as whispering  as his tone, the man who had been kneeling by the tomb, had unobserved  joined his associate and Egremont. He hardly reached the middle height;  his form slender, but well proportioned; his pale countenance, slightly  marked with the small pox, was redeemed from absolute ugliness by  a highly-intellectual brow, and large dark eyes that indicated deep  sensibility and great quickness of apprehension. Though young, he was  already a little bald; he was dressed entirely in black; the fairness  of his linen, the neatness of his beard, his gloves much worn, yet  carefully mended, intimated that his very faded garments were the result  of necessity rather than of negligence.    \"You also lament the dissolution of these bodies,\" said Egremont.    \"There is so much to lament in the world in which we live,\" said the  younger of the strangers, \"that I can spare no pang for the past.\"    \"Yet you approve of the principle of their society; you prefer it, you  say, to our existing life.\"    \"Yes; I prefer association to gregariousness.\"    \"That is a distinction,\" said Egremont, musingly.    \"It is a community of purpose that constitutes society,\" continued the  younger stranger; \"without that, men may be drawn into contiguity, but  they still continue virtually isolated.\"    \"And is that their condition in cities?\"    \"It is their condition everywhere; but in cities that condition is  aggravated. A density of population implies a severer struggle for  existence, and a consequent repulsion of elements brought into too close  contact. In great cities men are brought together by the desire of gain.  They are not in a state of co-operation, but of isolation, as to  the making of fortunes; and for all the rest they are careless of  neighbours. Christianity teaches us to love our neighbour as ourself;  modern society acknowledges no neighbour.\"    \"Well, we live in strange times,\" said Egremont, struck by the  observation of his companion, and relieving a perplexed spirit by an  ordinary exclamation, which often denotes that the mind is more stirring  than it cares to acknowledge, or at the moment is capable to express.    \"When the infant begins to walk, it also thinks that it lives in strange  times,\" said his companion.    \"Your inference?\" asked Egremont.    \"That society, still in its infancy, is beginning to feel its way.\"    \"This is a new reign,\" said Egremont, \"perhaps it is a new era.\"    \"I think so,\" said the younger stranger.    \"I hope so,\" said the elder one.    \"Well, society may be in its infancy,\" said Egremont slightly smiling;  \"but, say what you like, our Queen reigns over the greatest nation that  ever existed.\"    \"Which nation?\" asked the younger stranger, \"for she reigns over two.\"    The stranger paused; Egremont was silent, but looked inquiringly.    \"Yes,\" resumed the younger stranger after a moment's interval. \"Two  nations; between whom there is no intercourse and no sympathy; who are  as ignorant of each other's habits, thoughts, and feelings, as if they  were dwellers in different zones, or inhabitants of different planets;  who are formed by a different breeding, are fed by a different food, are  ordered by different manners, and are not governed by the same laws.\"    \"You speak of--\" said Egremont, hesitatingly.    \"THE RICH AND THE POOR.\"    At this moment a sudden flush of rosy light, suffusing the grey ruins,  indicated that the sun had just fallen; and through a vacant arch that  overlooked them, alone in the resplendent sky, glittered the twilight  star. The hour, the scene, the solemn stillness and the softening  beauty, repressed controversy, induced even silence. The last words  of the stranger lingered in the ear of Egremont; his musing spirit was  teeming with many thoughts, many emotions; when from the Lady Chapel  there rose the evening hymn to the Virgin. A single voice; but tones  of almost supernatural sweetness; tender and solemn, yet flexible and  thrilling.    Egremont started from his reverie. He would have spoken, but  he perceived that the elder of the strangers had risen from his  resting-place, and with downcast eyes and crossed arms, was on his  knees. The other remained standing in his former posture.    The divine melody ceased; the elder stranger rose; the words were on the  lips of Egremont, that would have asked some explanation of this sweet  and holy mystery, when in the vacant and star-lit arch on which his  glance was fixed, he beheld a female form. She was apparently in the  habit of a Religious, yet scarcely could be a nun, for her veil, if  indeed it were a veil, had fallen on her shoulders, and revealed her  thick tresses of long fair hair. The blush of deep emotion lingered on  a countenance, which though extremely young, was impressed with a  character of almost divine majesty; while her dark eyes and long dark  lashes, contrasting with the brightness of her complexion and the  luxuriance of her radiant locks, combined to produce a beauty as rare as  it is choice; and so strange, that Egremont might for a moment have been  pardoned for believing her a seraph, that had lighted on this sphere,  or the fair phantom of some saint haunting the sacred ruins of her  desecrated fane.          Book 2 Chapter 6        \"I understand, then,\" said Lord Marney to his brother, as on the evening  of the same day they were seated together in the drawing-room, in close  converse \"I understand then, that you have in fact paid nothing, and  that my mother will give you a thousand pounds. That won't go very far.\"    \"It will hardly pay for the chairing,\" said Egremont; \"the restoration  of the family influence was celebrated on so great a scale.\"    \"The family influence must be supported,\" said Lord Marney, \"and my  mother will give you a thousand pounds; as I said, that will not do much  for you, but I like her spirit. Contests are very expensive things, yet  I quite approve of what you have done, especially as you won. It is a  great thing in these ten pound days to win your first contest, and  shows powers of calculation which I respect. Everything in this world is  calculation; there is no such thing as luck, depend upon it; and if you  go on calculating with equal exactness, you must succeed in life. Now  the question is, what is to be done with your election bills?\"    \"Exactly.\"    \"You want to know what I will do for you, or rather what I can do for  you; that is the point. My inclination of course is to do everything  for you; but when I calculate my resources, I may find that they are not  equal to my inclination.\"    \"I am sure, George, you will do everything, and more than everything you  ought.\"    \"I am extremely pleased about this thousand pounds of my mother,  Charles.\"    \"Most admirable of her! But she always is so generous!\"    \"Her jointure has been most regularly paid,\" continued Lord Marney.  \"Always be exact in your payments, Charles. There is no end to the good  it produces. Now if I had not been so regular in paying my mother her  jointure, she would not in all probability have been able to have given  you this thousand pounds; and, therefore, to a certain extent, you are  indebted for this thousand pounds to me.\"    Egremont drew up a little, but said nothing.    \"I am obliged to pay my mother her jointure, whether ricks are burnt or  not,\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3761"],[0,"This Country of Ours (#15)"],[1,"they were filled with fear.  And  in order to find out how strong the force really was one of them  dressed himself as an Indian and crept within the French lines.  But  almost at once he was seen by a young Indian chief.  And his disguise  being thus discovered he was seized and questioned.  He owned that  there were scarce three hundred men in the fort and that, believing  the French to number at least two-thousand, they were completely  terror-stricken.  This news delighted Gourges, and next morning he  prepared to attack.    The fort was easily taken.  When the Spaniards saw the French  attack, panic seized them and they fled into the forest.  But there  the Indians, mad with the desire of blood and vengeance, met them.  Many fell before the tomahawks; others turned back choosing rather  to die at the hands of the French than of the Indians.  But which  way they turned there was no escape.  Nearly all were slain, a few  only were taken prisoner.    When the fight was over Gourges brought all the prisoners from the  three forts together.  He led them to the trees where Menendez had  hanged the Frenchmen a few months before.  There he spoke to them.    \"Did you think that such foul treachery, such, abominable cruelty  would go unpunished?\" he said. \"Nay, I, one of the most lowly of  my King's subjects, have taken upon myself to avenge it.  There is  no name shameful enough with which to brand your deeds, no punishment  severe enough to repay them.  But though you cannot be made to suffer  as you deserve you shall suffer all that an enemy may honourably  inflict.  Thus your fate shall be an example to teach others to keep  the peace and friendly alliance, which you have broken so wickedly.\"    And having spoken thus sternly to the trembling wretches Gourges  ordered his men to hang them on the very same trees upon which  Menendez had hanged the Frenchmen.  And over their heads he nailed  tablets of wood upon which were burned the words \"Not as Spaniards  or as Mariners, but as Traitors, Robbers and Murderers.\"    Then at length the vengeance of Gourges was satisfied.  But indeed  it was scarce complete, for Menendez the chief over and leader  of the Spaniards was safe in Europe, and beyond the reach of any  private man's vengeance.  The Spaniards, too, were strongly entrenched  at St.  Augustine, so strongly indeed that Gourges knew he had not  force enough to oust them.  He had not even men enough to keep the  three forts he had won.  So he resolved to destroy them.    This delighted the Indians, and they worked with such vigour that  in one day all three forts were made level with the ground.  Then,  having accomplished all that he had come to do, Gourges made ready  to depart.  Whereupon the Indians set up a wail of grief.  With  tears they begged the Frenchmen to stay, and when they refused they  followed them all the way to the shore, praising them and giving  them gifts, and praying them to return.    So leaving the savages weeping upon the shore the Frenchmen sailed  away, and little more than a month later they reached home.    When they heard of what Gourges had done the Huguenots rejoiced,  and they greeted him with honour and praise.  But Philip of Spain  was furiously angry.  He demanded that Gourges should be punished,  and offered a large sum of money for his head.  King Charles, too,  being in fear of the King of Spain, looked upon him coldly, so that  for a time he was obliged to flee away and hide himself.    Gourges had used all his money to set forth on his expedition, so  for a few years he lived in poverty.  But Queen Elizabeth at length  heard of him and his deeds.  And as she, too, hated the Spaniards  she was pleased at what he had done, and she asked him to enter  her service.  Thus at length he was restored to honour and favour.  And in honour and favour he continued all the rest of his life.    __________            Chapter 11 - The Adventures of Sir Humphrey Gilbert          The terrible disasters in Florida did not altogether stop French  adventurers from going to the New World.  But to avoid conflict with  Spain they sailed henceforth more to the northern shores of erica,  and endeavoured to found colonies there.  This made.  Englishmen  angry.  For by right of Cabot's voyages they claimed all America.  from Florida to Newfoundland, which, says a writer in the time of  Queen Elizabeth, \"they bought and annexed unto the crowne of England.\"  The English, therefore, looked upon the French as interlopers and  usurpers.  The French, however, paid little attention to the English  claims.  They explored the country, named mountains, rivers, capes,  and bays, and planted colonies where they liked.  Thus began the  long two hundred years' struggle between the French and English  for possession of North America.    The French had already planted a colony on the St.  Lawrence when  an Englishman, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, determined also to plant one  in North America.    He was the first Englishman ever to attempt to found a colony in  America.  Many Englishmen had indeed sailed there before him.  But  they had only gone in quest of gold and of adventures, and without  any thought of founding a New England across the seas.  This now,  with Queen Elizabeth's permission, was what Sir Humphrey hoped to  do.    He set out with a little fleet of five ships.  One of these was  called the Raleigh, and had been fitted out by the famous Sir Walter  Raleigh who was Gilbert's step-brother.  Walter Raleigh, no doubt,  would gladly have gone with the company himself.  But he was at the  time in high favour with Good Queen Bess, and she forbade him to  go on any such dangerous expedition.  So he had to content himself  with helping to fit out expeditions for other people.    The Raleigh was the largest ship of the little fleet, and Sir  Walter spared no cost in fitting it Out.  But before they had been  two days at sea the Captain of the Raleigh and many of his men  fell ill.  This so greatly discouraged them that they turned back  to Plymouth.    Sir Humphrey was sad indeed at the loss of the largest and best-fitted  ship of his expedition, but he held on his way undaunted.  They  had a troublous passage.  Contrary winds, fogs and icebergs delayed  them.  In a fog two of the ships named the Swallow and the Squirrel  separated from the others.  But still Sir Humphrey sailed on.    At length land came in sight.  But it was a barren, unfriendly coast,  \"nothing but hideous rocks and mountains, bare of trees, and void  of any green herbs,\" says one who went with the expedition.  And  seeing it so uninviting they sailed southward along the coast,  looking for a fairer land.    And now to their great joy they fell in again with the Swallow.  The  men in the Swallow were glad, too, to see the Golden Hind and the  Delight once more.  They threw their caps into the air and shouted  aloud for joy.    Soon after the re-appearance of the Swallow the Squirrel also turned  up, so the four ships were together again.  Together they sailed  into the harbour of St.  John's in Newfoundland.  Here they found  fishermen from all countries.  For Newfoundland had by this time  become famous as a fishing-ground, and every summer ships from all  countries went there to fish.    Sir Humphrey, armed as he was with a commission from Queen Elizabeth,  was received with all honour and courtesy by these people.  And on  Monday, August 5th, 1583, he landed and solemnly took possession  of the country for two hundred leagues north, south, east and west,  in the name of England's Queen.    First his commission was read aloud and interpreted to those of  foreign lands who were there.  Then one of Sir Humphrey's followers  brought him a twig of a hazel tree and a sod of earth, and put them  into his hands, as a sign that he took possession of the land and  all that was in it.  Then proclamation was made that these lands  belonged to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth of England by the Grace of  God. \"And if any person shall utter words sounding to the dishonour  of her Majesty, he shall lose his ears, and have his ship and goods  confiscated.\" The arms of England, engraved on lead and fixed to a  pillar of wood, were then set up, and after prayer to God the ceremony  came to an end.  Thus Newfoundland became an English possession, and  by right of Sir Humphrey Gilbert's claims it is the oldest colony  of the British Empire.    Sir Humphrey Gilbert had taken possession of the land.  But it soon  became plain that it would be impossible to found a colony with the  wild riff-raff of the sea of which his company was formed.  Troubles  began at once.  A few indeed went about their business quietly, but  others spent their time in plotting mischief.  They had no desire  to stay in that far country; so some hid in the woods waiting a  chance to steal away in one or other of the ships which were daily  sailing homeward laden with fish.  Others more bold plotted to steal  one of Sir Humphrey's ships and sail home without him.  But their  plot was discovered.  They, however, succeeded in stealing a ship  belonging to some other adventurers.  It was laden with fish and  ready to depart homeward.  In this they sailed away leaving its  owners behind.    The rest of Sir Humphrey's men now clamoured more than ever to be  taken home.  And at length he yielded to them.  But the company was  now much smaller than when he set out.  For besides those who had  stolen away, many had died and many more were sick.  There were not  enough men to man all four ships.  So the Swallow was left with the  sick and a few colonists who wished to remain, and in the other  three Sir Humphrey put to sea with the rest of his company.    He did not, however, sail straight homeward.  For he wanted to explore  still further, and find, if he could, an island to the south which  he had heard was very fertile.  But the weather was stormy, and  before they had gone far the Delight was"]]]
