Both the plain and turn-over collars were set up high in the  neck, large cut-steel buttons were introduced in the early seventies,  and many fancy china buttons, besides the gilt silver and paste ones  were in use. A new type of coat made its appearance with a high  turn-over collar and large lapels, and a sudden cut-in of the coat-front  high in the waist, giving a very long-tailed effect to the skirt. A cuff  shape with these was mostly made in one with the sleeve and buttoned at  the side towards the back, and when the cuff was additional, it seldom  had buttons, as formerly.    A greatcoat with one, two, or three capes was a picturesque garment, and  a leather-covered bottle was often carried when riding a distance, of  which I have an example in my collection.    [Illustration: FIG. 105.]    Waistcoats, which had become much shorter, were now giving place to a  type with a straight-across front and turned-back lapels at the neck;  these large lapels were mostly worn outside over the coat lapel. The  waistcoats were often double-breasted with an embroidered design down  the front between the double row of buttons, and the straight pockets of  these had no flaps; they shortened at the waist in character with the  lapelled coat, but were worn lower than the cut-in shape of the coat,  showing about 3 inches when the coat was fastened. Breeches became very  tight, and trousers begin to appear after 1790. Striped stockings and  suits were much in favour. Top-boots with rather long brown tops were  worn, or high boots with a curved top, with a gold tassel set in front,  were seen. The shoes with latchets and buckles had a low front on the  instep, and from about 1780 took a rather pointed oval toe shape; the  heels were mostly worn shorter. Swords were not so much in use except on  great occasions, but sword-sticks were carried, and heavy club-sticks  were fashionable before 1800. Patches were little used after the  seventies, but the snuff-box was still indispensable. The double long  purse with central rings and tassels at the ends was carried, of knitted  silk or of leather, the former with steel beads and coloured silks  worked together after 1780: small bag purses were also in use, usually  set in gilt mounts and made in the same methods with a tassel below.

During the later part of the 18th century, a great deal of tinsel drawn  work was done on fine muslin, and became beautifully treated in delicate  design on the hem and down the front of many of the high-waisted dresses  as in Fig. A, Plate XXIII (see p. 218). Later on towards the twenties we  see a great deal of effective coarse work in heavy gold tinsel, and at  the same time to the forties a number of dresses were ably enriched with  fine gold thread.    The white embroidery in the earlier trimmings of this period, of which I  give examples in Plate XXIV (see p. 231), was remarkable for its wealth  of fancy; the chief beauty of these dresses was the delightful treatment  of gathered effects, and with the reign of George IV we note the  gradual return of the longer pointed bodice, with the growth of very  full sleeves, also the increase in the size and fuller set-out of the  skirts over the stiff flounced drill petticoats. The =V=-shaped Bertha  setting to neck and shoulders began to establish itself, and became a  great feature through the thirties and forties; the first signs of it  appear about 1814. Varieties of materials were used to great advantage  in designing, and drawn tulle trimmings were happily introduced to  soften hard shapes and colours. The shoulder fullness also began to be  neatly drawn in and held by straps, which gave a charming character to  many bodices.    From 1816 choice work in piped shapes, often of flower forms decorated  with pearls or beads, was set on fine net, as seen in Plates XXIII and  XXIX (see pp. 218, 263). The attraction to the thirties was the happy  effects gained by the bow and flower looping on the flounces, and these  ripened in fancy and variety through the forties. Braiding was adopted  in the thirties with a rather charming treatment of tassels down the  front of the dress; the polonaises of this time were also effective and  simple, caught here and there with posies of flowers, and we find this  fashion again revived in the sixties.    With the reign of George IV we notice an increasing choice of strong  coloured effects, which culminated in the mid-Victorian era in raw  colour and violent shot silks, velvets, and heavy fringes, but one may  see that many of these dresses of bright pure tone looked exceedingly  refined and were quite stately. A remarkable dress is Fig. A, Plate  XXXII (see p. 279), which is of very strong bright blue; its only  enrichment being a curved line of folded silk. All these dresses from  1800 were delightfully embellished with embroidered fichus, light  scarves of frail gauze, crepe, or Norwich silk, and in the Victorian  times capes and =V=-shaped shawls; fascinating lace ruffles and tuck-in  fronts to the bodice necks, of frills and bands of embroidery, broke the  severity or bareness of many dresses. An endless variety of fascinating  caps and lace head-lappets was pinned or caught into the hair at the  wearer's fancy; besides the bows, flowers, and jewels (especially  pearls) which have always played an important part in the coiffure from  early times, the chatelaines and bags, fobs, fans, and lace or silk  handkerchiefs all give the artist a note of extra colour when desired.  The cruel period of taste really came with the seventies, though one can  trace many quaint and interesting cuts in the bodices and skirts of this  time; but the \"grand dress\" of complicated drapings, heavily fringed or  braided, was a \"set piece\" which, let us hope, will never appear again.    The long stocking-purse which began to appear in the late 17th century  was up to 1820 sometimes carried tucked through the belt; it was set  with a pair of metal rings and tassels of steel or gilt beads. Small and  large circular and bag-shaped purses were also in use; all these were  made in coloured silk threads enriched with steel, gilt, or coloured  beads, the latter shapes being set in chased metal mounts, the circular  ones generally having a fringe and the bag shape a small tassel or heavy  drop. These shapes can also be seen in coloured leathers with a leather  tassel, besides the plain money-bag with a draw-string.      NINETEENTH CENTURY. GEORGE III. FEMALE.    The hair up to 1808 was gathered into a knot of curls at the back of the  head, rather high up, with a small curl at the sides in front of the  ear. Later the knot was set more on the top, and the side curls were  made more of a feature, several being arranged at the sides. Numerous  varieties of large and small brimmed hats, bonnets, and turbans are  seen, and several masculine top-hats and cockade hats may be noted late  in this reign. The usual feather decorations and large ribbons or  flowers were in use, and a handkerchief was sometimes bound over the top  of the straw hat and tied under the chin.    [Illustration: FIG. 107.--Costume notes, 1811-1812.]    [Illustration: FIG. 108.--Costume notes, 1814-1816.]    The classic high-waisted dress continued till 1808, and was often  beautifully decorated with white embroidery and gold or tinsel, as in A,  Plates XX and XXIII (see pp. 199, 218), and the frontispiece is a lovely  white example. There were several interesting drapings, one being a cord  hanging from the back of the shoulder to loop up the train of the dress,  as in A, Plate XXII (see p. 215). The simple tunic shapes are better  described by the illustrations: more originality was essayed in  design after the last-mentioned date. A high Vandyked lace collar and  fan setting to the shoulders appeared, and many interesting dresses of a  plain cut, mostly in velvet and silks, were worn about 1810-12. A  gathered sleeve drawn tight at intervals was often seen up to 1816, when  embroidered ruffles and frills decorated most of the necks and skirts,  and a braided type of character, rather military in effect with  beautifully piped edgings, came in from about 1817. Spencer bodices were  an additional interest at this period, and a short puff sleeve was  generally banded or caught with bows; these being often worn over a  fairly loose long sleeve gathered by a wristband. Dresses were worn  shorter from about 1810. Charming lace and embroidered fichus crossed  the shoulders, and long scarf-capes were thrown round the neck and were  often tied round behind, as in the 18th century; long capes with points  and tassels in front fell to the knees, and a simple pelisse with cape  became a pleasing feature. Bags were always carried, of which there is a  variety of shapes in the plates; long gloves or mittens were generally  worn. Parasols of a flat shape, or others with round or pagoda shaped  tops are seen, many being edged with a deep fringe. Long purses were  often tucked through the waistband.    [Illustration: FIG. 109.]    The pointed shoe, tied sandal fashion up the leg, and with no heel,  remained through this reign, but a round-toed low shoe, tied on in the  same manner, began to supersede it about 1810.

Why is a snail called a univalve?    2. Identify the head and mouth of the snail. Watch the snail feeding  and examine the mouth of the snail with a lens. What do you notice?  If your aquarium in which the pond snail is living has a green  coating (algae) on the side, describe its appearance after the snail  has been crawling up and down over it. Explain.    3. How many tentacles has a pond snail? a land snail? Where are the  eyes located in each case? What movements of the tentacles do you  notice? What is their purpose?    4. How does the rate of locomotion of the snail compare with that of  the clam? Find out if the snail can creep backwards or on the surface  of the water. Does there seem to be any tendency for the snail to go  up and down the sides of the aquaria vertically rather than to the  right or left?    5. What does a snail do when disturbed? What is gained by this  action?    6. Search for pond snail's eggs on the side of the aquaria. Lift up  the bits of cabbage on which the slugs are feeding and search for  eggs. Describe what you find in each case, noting the size,  appearance, and whether the eggs are laid singly or in masses.    7. Find the breathing pore. Describe its position and appearance.    8. Contrast the various types of shells, and note with care in what  respects they differ. Holding the shell with the aperture toward you  and the spire pointing up, determine whether each shell has  the aperture on the right (right-handed shell) or on the left  (left-handed shell). Is the right-handed or the left-handed shell  more common?    9.
