[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4278"],[0,"An Introduction to Yoga (#15)"],[1," by constant practice (abhyasa) and by dispassion  (vai-ragya).\"[FN#9: loc. cit., VI. 35, 35]    These are the two methods, the only two methods, by which this  restless, storm-tossed mind can be reduced to peace and quietude.  Vai-ragya and abhyasa, they are the only two methods, but when  steadily practiced they inevitably bring about the result.    Let us consider what these two familiar words imply. Vai-ragya,  or dispassion, has as its main idea the clearing away of all  passion for, attraction to, the objects of the senses, the bonds  which are made by desire between man and the objects around him.  Raga is \"passion, addiction,\" that which binds a man to things.  The prefix \"vi\"--changing to \"vai\" by a grammatical rule --means  \"without,\" or \"in opposition to\". Hence vai-ragya is  \"non-passion, absence of passion,\" not bound, tied or related to  any of these outside objects. Remembering that thinking is the  establishing of relations, we see that the getting rid of  relations will impose on the mind the stillness that is Yoga. All  raga must be entirely put aside. We must separate ourselves from  it. We must acquire the opposite condition, where every passion  is stilled, where no attraction for the objects of desire  remains, where all the bonds that unite the man to surrounding  objects are broken. \"When the bonds of the heart are broken, then  the man becomes immortal.\"    How shall this dispassion be brought about? There is only one  right way of doing it. By slowly and gradually drawing ourselves  away from outer objects through the more potent attraction of the  Self. The Self is ever attracted to the Self. That attraction  alone can turn these vehicles away from the alluring and  repulsive objects that surround them; free from all raga, no more  establishing relations with objects, the separated Self finds  himself liberated and free, and union with the one Self becomes  the sole object of desire. But not instantly, by one supreme  effort, by one endeavour, can this great quality of dispassion  become the characteristic of the man bent on Yoga. He must  practice dispassion constantly and steadfastly. That is implied  in the word joined with dispassion, abhyasa or practice. The  practice must be constant, continual and unbroken. \"Practice\"  does not mean only meditation, though this is the sense in which  the word is generally used; it means the deliberate, unbroken  carrying out of dispassion in the very midst of the objects that  attract.    In order that you may acquire dispassion, you must practice it in  the everyday things of life. I have said that many confine  abhyasa to meditation. That is why so few people attain to Yoga.  Another error is to wait for some big opportunity. People prepare  themselves for some tremendous sacrifice and forget the little  things of everyday life, in which the mind is knitted to objects  by a myriad tiny threads. These things, by their pettiness, fail  to attract attention, and in waiting for the large thing, which  does not come, people lose the daily practice of dispassion  towards the little things that are around them. By curbing desire  at every moment, we become indifferent to all the objects that  surround us. Then, when the great opportunity comes, we seize it  while scarce aware that it is upon us. Every day, all day long,  practice--that is what is demanded from the aspirant to Yoga, for  only on that line can success come; and it is the wearisomeness  of this strenuous, continued endeavour that tires out the  majority of aspirants.    I must here warn you of a danger. There is a rough-and- ready way  of quickly bringing about dispassion. Some say to you: \"Kill out  all love and affection; harden your hearts; become cold to all  around you; desert your wife and children, your father and  mother, and fly to the desert or the jungle; put a wall between  youself and all objects of desire; then dispassion will be  yours.\" It is true that it is comparatively easy to acquire  dispassion in that way. But by that you kill more than desire.  You put round the Self, who is love, a barrier through which he  is unable to pierce. You cramp yourself by encircling yourself  with a thick shell, and you cannot break through it. You harden  yourself where you ought to be softened; you isolate yourself  where you ought to be embracing others; you kill love and not  only desire, forgetting that love clings to the Self and seeks  the Self, while desire clings to the sheaths of the Self, the  bodies in which the Self is clothed. Love is the desire of the  separated Self for union with all other separated Selves.  Dispassion is the non-attraction to matter--a very different  thing. You must guard love--for it is the very Self of the Self.  In your anxiety to acquire dispassion do not kill out love. Love  is the life in everyone of us, separated Selves. It draws every  separated Self to the other Self. Each one of us is a part of one  mighty whole. Efface desire as regards the vehicles that clothe  the Self, but do not efface love as regards the Self, that  never-dying force which draws Self to Self. In this great  up-climbing, it is far better to suffer from love rather than to  reject it, and to harden your hearts against all ties and claims  of affection. Suffer for love, even though the suffering be  bitter. Love, even though the love be an avenue of pain. The pain  shall pass away, but the love shall continue to grow, and in the  unity of the Self you shall finally discover that love is the  great attracting force which makes all things one.    Many people, in trying to kill out love, only throw themselves  back, becoming less human, not superhuman; by their mistaken  attempts. It is by and through human ties of love and sympathy  that the Self unfolds. It is said of the Masters that They love  all humanity as a mother loves her firstborn son. Their love is  not love watered down to coolness, but love for all raised to the  heat of the highest particular loves of smaller souls. Always  mistrust the teacher who tells you to kill out love, to be  indifferent to human affections. That is the way which leads to  the left-hand path.          Meditation With and Without Seed        The next step is our method of meditation. What do we mean by  meditation? Meditation cannot be the same for every man. Though  the same in principle, namely, the steadying of the mind, the  method must vary with the temperament of the practitioner.  Suppose that you are a strong-minded and intelligent man, fond of  reasoning. Suppose that connected links of thought and argument  have been to you the only exorcise of the mind. Utilise that past  training. Do not imagine that you can make your mind still by a  single effort. Follow a logical chain of reasoning, step by step,  link after link; do not allow the mind to swerve a hair's breadth  from it. Do not allow the mind to go aside to other lines of  thought. Keep it rigidly along a single line, and steadiness will  gradually result. Then, when you have worked up to your highest  point of reasoning and reached the last link of your chain of  argument, and your mind will carry you no further, and beyond  that you can see nothing, then stop. At that highest point of  thinking, cling desperately to the last link of the chain, and  there keep the mind poised, in steadiness and strenuous quiet,  waiting for what may come. After a while, you will be able to  maintain this attitude for a considerable time.    For one in whom imagination is stronger than the reasoning  faculty, the method by devotion, rather than by reasoning, is the  method. Let him call imagination to his help. He should picture  some scene, in which the object of his devotion forms the central  figure, building it up, bit by bit, as a painter paints a  picture, putting in it gradually all the elements of the scene He  must work at it as a painter works on his canvas, line by line,  his brush the brush of imagination. At first the work will be  very slow, but the picture soon begins to present itself at call.  Over and over he should picture the scene, dwelling less and less  on the surrounding objects and more and more on the central  figure which is the object of his heart's devotion. The drawing  of the mind to a point, in this way, brings it under control and  steadies it, and thus gradually, by this use of the imagination.  he brings the mind under command. The object of devotion will be  according to the man's religion. Suppose--as is the case with  many of you--that his object of devotion is Sri Krishna; picture  Him in any scene of His earthly life, as in the battle of  Kurukshetra. Imagine the armies arrayed for battle on both sides;  imagine Arjuna on the floor of the chariot, despondent,  despairing; then come to Sri Krishna, the Charioteer, the Friend  and Teacher. Then, fixing your mind on the central figure, let  your heart go out to Him with onepointed devotion. Resting on  Him, poise yourself in silence and, as before, wait for what may  come.    This is what is called \"meditation with seed\". The central  figure, or the last link in reasoning, that is \"the seed\". You  have gradually made the vagrant mind steady by this process of  slow and gradual curbing, and at last you are fixed on the  central thought, or the central figure, and there you are poised.  Now let even that go. Drop the central thought, the idea, the  seed of meditation. Let everything go. But keep the mind in the  position gained, the highest point reached, vigorous and alert.  This is meditation without a seed. Remain poised, and wait in the  silence and the void. You are in the \"cloud,\" before described,  and pass through the condition before sketched. Suddenly there  will be a change, a change unmistakable, stupendous, incredible.  In that silence, as said, a Voice shall be heard. In that void, a  Form shall reveal itself. In that empty sky, a Sun shall rise,  and in the light of that Sun you shall "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4294"],[0,"Tales of Aztlan; The Romance of a Hero of Our Late Spanish-American War, (#15)"],[1,"town which  gave the life of its mayor, its first, its most honored citizen, to the  nation.    On the isle of Cuba, in the battle of San Juan Hill, fell the gallant  Captain William Owen O'Neill of the regiment of Rough Riders. Peace to  his ashes!    I have been told the circumstances surrounding his death by friends,  who were soldiers of his company. They were lying under cover behind  every available shelter to dodge a hailstorm of Mauser bullets,  awaiting the order to advance. Captain O'Neill exposed himself and was  instantly killed. How could he avoid it? How could it have been  otherwise? What can keep an Irishman down in the ditch when bullets are  flying in air, \"murmuring dirges\" and \"shells are shrieking requiems?\"  You may readily imagine an Irishman on the firing line, poking his head  above the ground, exclaiming: \"Did yez see that? And where did that  Dago pill come from now? Shure it spoke Spanish, but it did not hit me  at all, at all, Begorra!\"    The activity of the Sphinx ended not with the battle of San Juan Hill,  for it cast the luster of its glorious power on the gallant Lieutenant  Colonel of the famous regiment of Rough Riders, Theodore Roosevelt, and  on him it conferred in time the greatest honor to be achieved on earth,  it made him President of the United States of America. Not knowing it,  perhaps, he still is at the time of this writing in the sphere of  influence and in the power of the Sphinx and is doing its bidding. Else  why should he, as is well known, favor the jointure of New Mexico and  Arizona into one State? Surely the loyal subjects of the Sphinx, the  Pueblo Indians of Aztec blood, live mostly in New Mexico, and the  cunning idol plans to deliver them out of the hands of the Spanish  Mexicans, and place them under the protection and care of the Americans  of Arizona, knowing full well that the Anglo-Saxon blood will rule.    Every miner and prospector of Arizona knows that there have been, and  are found to this day nuggets of pure gold and silver on the summit of  barren hills, in localities and under geological conditions which are  not to be reckoned as possible natural phenomena. Whence came the  golden nuggets on the summit of Rich Hill at Weaver, where a party of  men gathered two hundred thousand dollars worth in a week's time?  Whence came the isolated great chunk of silver at Turkey Creek, valued  at many thousands? The wisest professor of geology and expert of mines  cannot explain it. This, I say, is the gold and silver from ornaments  employed in temples of the idols of ancient races, who lived  unthinkable thousands of years ago. The very stones of their temples  have crumbled and been decomposed, but the precious metal has been  formed into nuggets, according to the natural laws of molecular  attraction, and under the impulse of gravity and in obedience to the  laws of affinity of matter.    People from Prescott in their rambles in the vicinity of Thumb Butte  have probably noticed a slag pile as comes from a furnace. I have heard  them theorize and argue on the question of its origin or use, as there  is not a sign of ore in existence thereabouts to indicate a smelting  furnace. I say this was an altar erected I by the ancient worshipers to  their idol, the Sphinx. Before it stood the awful sacrificial stone,  whereon quivered the bodies of victims while priests tore open their  breasts and offered their throbbing hearts in the sacred fire on the  altar, a sacrifice to their cruel god. Many prospectors have  undoubtedly traced a blood red vein of rock coursing from this place  toward Willow Creek--a valuable lode of cinnabar, they must have  thought. If they had tested the ore for quicksilver, they would have  received discouraging results. Porphyry stained with an unknown  petrified substance and without a trace of metal invariably read the  analytical assays.    This is the innocent, petrified blood of victims which stained a ledge  of porphyry when it ran down the mountain side in torrents, an awful  sacrifice to the ancient idols of lust and ignorance. A kindly warning  to you, fellow-prospectors and miners, who delve in the vitals of  Mother Earth! Beware Thumb Butte, beware the district of the Sphinx!  Have a care, for you know not what you may encounter in this mystic  neighborhood! Shun strange gods and set up no idols in your hearts, as  you value the salvation of your souls. But if your mine lies in this  district, be fearful not to excite the anger of the gnomes of the  mountain. Charge lightly, lest you blast the bottom out of your mine.  Disturb not the slumber of the spirits of the hills lest they throw a  horse into the shaft and push your pay-ore down a thousand feet.    Now, I who am what I am, a servant of the Sphinx, have erected the  shrine of my household gods in the beautiful town, which lies in its  shadow and is held in its paw. Even now is the Sphinx weaving on the  web of my destiny. I hope I may be spared the cumbersome burden of the  wealth of a Rockefeller, who is said to possess a billion dollars for  every hair on his head. One thousandth part of his wealth would suffice  to reward me amply.    I received a message in a dream, in a vision of the night, a promise  from the Sphinx. I fancied that I was on Lynx Creek, sitting on the  windlass at the shaft of my silver mine. This mine is within a mile of  the place where we had camped and met the party of miners. I had worked  the mine with profit until I met, through no fault of mine, with a  fault in the mine and encountered a horse in the formation which  faulted the ground in such a manner as to interrupt the pay chute and  to make further work unprofitable.    While I sat there, lighting my pipe and blessing my luck, I saw a black  tomcat come along and jump my claim. As I have always detested claim  jumpers, I threw a rock at him and with an uncanny mee-ow and bristling  tail he disappeared down the mine. When I went to the spot where he had  scratched, after the fashion of cats, probably preparing to build his  location monument and place his notice, I was thunderstruck to see that  the rock I had thrown at him had been transformed into a chunk of pure  gold. Surely where that cat jumped into the mine, there lies a bonanza,  there shall I sink to the water level.    From the time of my youth have I always possessed great bodily strength  and physical endurance, combined with good health, and now, I am, if  anything, stronger in body than ever and I am blessed with the  identical passions and thoughts I harbored in the days of my youth. To  me this signifies that my life's real task is now beginning, the Sphinx  is fitting me for glorious work. What and where, I care not; but  ambitious hope leads me on, past wealth and power to visions of a  temple of divine, pictorial art. Fain would I guide my light, frivolous  thoughts long enough into the calm channels of serious reflection to  bid you, my kind readers, a dignified farewell and express the sincere  hope that, when we have prospected life's mortal vein to the end of  time and our souls soar on the last blast of Gabriel's trumpet to  shining sands on shores of bliss eternal.          AN UNCANNY STONE.    (A sequel to the last chapter of \"Wooed by a Sphinx of Astlan.\"')      \"Gigantic shadows, dancing in the twilight    Fade with the sun's last golden ray.    On quivering bat-wings, sad and silent,    Flits darkness--night pursuing day.    Hark! as the twelfth hour sounds its knell    At midnight, tolls a whimpering bell    When yawning graves profane their secrecy.    Ghosts stalk in dreamland haunting memory    And spectral visions of departed friends arise    Who freed of sin, that fetter of mortality,    With Angels in their kingdom of Eternal Life    Grace Heaven's choir of harmony.\"    The third day of July A. D. 1907 was a gala-day for the citizens of  Prescott, a historic date for Arizona, as then our governor, in behalf  of the territory, formally accepted an equestrian statue from its  sculptor.    This monument which commemorates our war with Spain had been erected on  the public plaza of Prescott in honor of \"Roosevelt's Rough Riders,\"  the first regiment of United States Volunteer cavalry.    A master-piece of modern art the statue breathes life and action in the  perfection of its every detail, representing a Rough Rider who is about  to draw his weapon while reining his terrified horse as it rears in a  last lunge. This is indicated by the steed's gaping mouth, distended  nostrils, the bent knees, knotted chords and veins of its neck and body.    The expression of a noble beast's agony is rendered in so life-like a  manner that its protruding eyes seem to glaze into the awful stare of  death, and instinctively the spectator listens for the stifled whimper  and whinnying screams of a wounded creature.    Borglum's splendid statuary, this heroic cast of bronze which so  faithfully portrays the destiny of a dumb animal, man's most useful and  willing slave, always ready to share its master's fate, even unto  death--to my mind is a most eloquent, if silent, argument against all  warfare.    But the glory of the monument is its pedestal.    A solid stone, a bed-rock from the cradle of the idol-mountain it was  contributed by nature to the memory of one of its noblemen, \"Captain  William Owen O'Neill,\" who crowned his life with immortality, suffering  a soldier's death.    During the storming of San Juan Hill to anxious friends imploring him  not recklessly to expose himself, with smiling lips he gave this  message of death's Angel, that mysterious oracle of a Sphinx which from  the gaze of mortals veils their ordained doom: \"Comrades, sergeant! I  thank you for your kindly warning--fear not for me, the Spanish bullet  that could kill me is not molded!\"--when instantly he fell struck  dead--not by a \"Spanish\" bullet--\"no!\" but by the bullet fired from a  Mauser rifle, \"not made in Spain.\" Not an"]]]
