McGiffin won great praise for  the military arrangements and disposition of his men, but, in the same  report, he went on to describe how he armed them with a new gun known as  Baines's Rhetoric and told of the havoc he wrought in the enemy's  ranks when he fired these guns loaded with similes and metaphors and  hyperboles.    Of course, after each exhibition of this sort he was sent to the  _Santee_ and given an opportunity to meditate.    On another occasion, when one of the instructors lectured to the cadets,  he required them to submit a written statement embodying all that they  could recall of what had been said at the lecture. One of the rules  concerning this report provided that there should be no erasures or  interlineations, but that when mistakes were made the objectionable or  incorrect expressions should be included within parentheses; and that  the matter so enclosed within parentheses would not be considered a part  of the report. McGiffin wrote an excellent _resume_ of the lecture,  but he interspersed through it in parentheses such words as \"applause,\"  \"cheers,\" \"cat-calls,\" and \"groans,\" and as these words were enclosed  within parentheses he insisted that they did not count, and made a very  fair plea that he ought not to be punished for words which slipped in  by mistake, and which he had officially obliterated by what he called  oblivion marks.    He was not always on mischief bent. On one occasion, when the house of a  professor caught fire, McGiffin ran into the flames and carried out two  children, for which act he was commended by the Secretary of the Navy.    It was an act of Congress that determined that the career of McGiffin  should be that of a soldier of fortune. This was a most unjust act,  which provided that only as many midshipmen should receive commissions  as on the warships there were actual vacancies. In those days, in 1884,  our navy was very small. To-day there is hardly a ship having her full  complement of officers, and the difficulty is not to get rid of those we  have educated, but to get officers to educate. To the many boys who, on  the promise that they would be officers of the navy, had worked for  four years at the Academy and served two years at sea, the act was most  unfair. Out of a class of about ninety, only the first twelve were given  commissions and the remaining eighty turned adrift upon the uncertain  seas of civil life. As a sop, each was given one thousand dollars.    McGiffin was not one of the chosen twelve. In the final examinations on  the list he was well toward the tail. But without having studied  many things, and without remembering the greater part of them, no  one graduates from Annapolis, even last on the list; and with his one  thousand dollars in cash, McGiffin had also this six years of education  at what was then the best naval college in the world. This was his only  asset--his education--and as in his own country it was impossible to  dispose of it, for possible purchasers he looked abroad.    At that time the Tong King war was on between France and China, and he  decided, before it grew rusty, to offer his knowledge to the followers  of the Yellow Dragon. In those days that was a hazard of new fortunes  that meant much more than it does now. To-day the East is as near as San  Francisco; the Japanese-Russian War, our occupation of the Philippines,  the part played by our troops in the Boxer trouble, have made the  affairs of China part of the daily reading of every one. Now, one can  step into a brass bed at Forty-second Street and in four days at the  Coast get into another brass bed, and in twelve more be spinning down  the Bund of Yokohama in a rickshaw. People go to Japan for the winter  months as they used to go to Cairo.    But in 1885 it was no such light undertaking, certainly not for a young  man who had been brought up in the quiet atmosphere of an inland  town, where generations of his family and other families had lived and  intermarried, content with their surroundings.    With very few of his thousand dollars left him, McGiffin arrived in  February, 1885, in San Francisco. From there his letters to his family  give one the picture of a healthy, warm-hearted youth, chiefly anxious  lest his mother and sister should \"worry.\" In our country nearly every  family knows that domestic tragedy when the son and heir \"breaks home  ties,\" and starts out to earn a living; and if all the world loves a  lover, it at least sympathizes with the boy who is \"looking for a job.\"  The boy who is looking for the job may not think so, but each of those  who has passed through the same hard place gives him, if nothing else,  his good wishes. McGiffin's letters at this period gain for him from  those who have had the privilege to read them the warmest good feeling.    They are filled with the same cheery optimism, the same slurring over  of his troubles, the same homely jokes, the same assurances that he is  feeling \"bully,\" and that it all will come out right, that every boy,  when he starts out in the world, sends back to his mother.    \"I am in first-rate health and spirits, so I don't want you to fuss  about me. I am big enough and ugly enough to scratch along somehow, and  I will not starve.\"    To his mother he proudly sends his name written in Chinese characters,  as he had been taught to write it by the Chinese Consul-General in San  Francisco, and a pen-picture of two elephants. \"I am going to bring you  home _two_ of these,\" he writes, not knowing that in the strange and  wonderful country to which he is going elephants are as infrequent as  they are in Pittsburg.    He reached China in April, and from Nagasaki on his way to Shanghai  the steamer that carried him was chased by two French gunboats. But,  apparently much to his disappointment, she soon ran out of range of  their guns. Though he did not know it then, with the enemy he had  travelled so far to fight this was his first and last hostile meeting;  for already peace was in the air.    Of that and of how, in spite of peace, he obtained the \"job\" he wanted,  he must tell you himself in a letter home:    TIEN-TSIN, CHINA, April 13, 1885.    \"MY DEAR MOTHER--I have not felt much in the humor for writing, for  I did not know what was going to happen. I spent a good deal of money  coming out, and when I got here, I knew, unless something turned up,  I was a gone coon. We got off Taku forts Sunday evening and the next  morning we went inside; the channel is very narrow and sown with  torpedoes. We struck one--an electric one--in coming up, but it didn't  go off. We were until 10.30 P.M. in coming up to Tien-Tsin--thirty miles  in a straight line, but nearly seventy by the river, which is only about  one hundred feet wide--and we grounded ten times.    \"Well--at last we moored and went ashore. Brace Girdle, an engineer, and  I went to the hotel, and the first thing we heard was--that _peace was  declared!_ I went back on board ship, and I didn't sleep much--I never  was so blue in my life. I knew if they didn't want me that I might as  well give up the ghost, for I could never get away from China. Well--I  worried around all night without sleep, and in the morning I felt as  if I had been drawn through a knot-hole. I must have lost ten pounds. I  went around about 10 A.M. and gave my letters to Pethick, an American  U. S. Vice-Consul and interpreter to Li Hung Chang. He said he would fix  them for me. Then I went back to the ship, and as our captain was going  up to see Li Hung Chang, I went along out of desperation. We got in,  and after a while were taken in through corridor after corridor of the  Viceroy's palace until we got into the great Li, when we sat down and  had tea and tobacco and talked through an interpreter. When it came  my turn he asked: 'Why did you come to China?' I said: 'To enter the  Chinese service for the war.' 'How do you expect to enter?' 'I expect  _you_ to give me a commission!' 'I have no place to offer you.' 'I think  you have--I have come all the way from America to get it.' 'What would  you like?' 'I would like to get the new torpedo-boat and go down the  Yang-tse-Kiang to the blockading squadron.' 'Will you do that?' 'Of  course.'    \"He thought a little and said: 'I will see what can be done. Will you  take $100 a month for a start?' I said: 'That depends.' (Of course  I would take it.) Well, after parley, he said he would put me on the  flagship, and if I did well he would promote me. Then he looked at me  and said: 'How old are you?' When I told him I was twenty-four I thought  he would faint--for in China a man is a _boy_ until he is over thirty.  He said I would _never_ do--I was a child. I could not know anything at  all. I could not convince him, but at last he compromised--I was to pass  an examination at the Arsenal at the Naval College, in all branches,  and if they passed me I would have a show. So we parted. I reported for  examination next day, but was put off--same the next day. But to-day I  was told to come, and sat down to a stock of foolscap, and had a  pretty stiff exam. I am only just through. I had seamanship, gunnery,  navigation, nautical astronomy, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, conic  sections, curve tracing, differential and integral calculus. I had only  three questions out of five to answer in each branch, but in the first  three I answered all five. After that I only had time for three, but  at the end he said I need not finish, he was perfectly satisfied. I had  done remarkably well, and he would report to the Viceroy to-morrow. He  examined my first papers--seamanship--said I was _perfect_ in it, so I  will get _along_, you need not fear. I told the Consul--he was very well  pleased--he is a nice man.    \"I feel pretty well now--have had dinner and am smoking a good Manila  cheroot. I wrote hard all day, wrote fifteen sheets of foolscap and made  about a dozen drawings--got"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30293"],[0,"The Candy Maker's Guide (#15)"],[1,"   PROCESS.--Soak gelatine as usual, smooth off and mould fondant shapes.

Best White Sugar.    2 quarts Water.    PROCESS.--Have the goods cleaned and put in crystalizing tins; bring the  above quantity of sugar and water just to the boil and stand aside until  only milk warm; then pour it gently over the goods until covered; then  slip the hands into the middle of the goods, and with the fingers just  ease this bulk so that the syrup will flow freely between them; withdraw  the hands carefully and cover the tin; do not again disturb it for the  next twelve hours, when the goods will be ready to drain and dry. To an  experienced man, this method may seem a little dangerous and likely to  spoil the crystal; but it will not do so if done carefully. Of course,  it is understood the goods are not to be roughly stirred up, but simply  loosened.      Concentrated Flower and Essence Flavors for Confectioners.
