The  wonderful part of this is, not that he resembled the round stones and  dry grass, but that he knew he did, and was ready to profit by it.    We soon found that it was Scarface and his wife Vixen that had made our  woods their home and our barnyard their base of supplies.    Next morning a search in the pines showed a great bank of earth that had  been scratched up within a few months. It must have come from a hole,  and yet there was none to be seen. It is well known that a really cute  fox, on digging a new den, brings all the earth out at the first hole  made, but carries on a tunnel into some distant thicket. Then closing up  for good the first made and too well-marked door, uses only the entrance  hidden in the thicket.    So after a little search at the other side of a knoll, I found the real  entry and good proof that there was a nest of little foxes inside.    Rising above the brush on the hillside was a great hollow basswood. It  leaned a good deal and had a large hole at the bottom, and a smaller one  at top.    We boys had often used this tree in playing Swiss Family Robinson, and  by cutting steps in its soft punky walls had made it easy to go up and  down in the hollow. Now it came in handy, for next day when the sun was  warm I went there to watch, and from this perch on the roof, I soon saw  the interesting family that lived in the cellar near by. There were four  little foxes; they looked curiously like little lambs, with their woolly  coats, their long thick legs and innocent expressions, and yet a second  glance at their broad, sharp-nosed, sharp-eyed visages showed that each  of these innocents was the makings of a crafty old fox.    They played about, basking in the sun, or wrestling with each other  till a slight sound made them scurry under ground. But their alarm was  needless, for the cause of it was their mother; she stepped from the  bushes bringing another hen--number seventeen as I remember. A low call  from her and the little fellows came tumbling out. Then began a scene  that I thought charming, but which my uncle would not have enjoyed at  all.    They rushed on the hen, and tussled and fought with it, and each other,  while the mother, keeping a sharp eye for enemies, looked on with fond  delight. The expression on her face was remarkable. It was first a  grinning of delight, but her usual look of wildness and cunning was  there, nor were cruelty and nervousness lacking, but over all was the  unmistakable look of the mother's pride and love.    The base of my tree was hidden in bushes and much lower than the knoll  where the den was, so I could come and go at will without scaring the  foxes.    For many days I went there and saw much of the training of the young  ones. They early learned to turn to statuettes sound, and then  on hearing it again or finding other cause for fear, to run for shelter.    Some animals have so much mother-love that it overflows and benefits  outsiders. Not so old Vixen it would seem. Her pleasure in the cubs led  to most refined cruelty. For she often brought home to them mice and  birds alive, and with diabolic gentleness would avoid doing them serious  hurt so that the cubs might have larger scope to torment them.    There was a woodchuck that lived over in the hill orchard. He was  neither handsome nor interesting, but he knew how to take care of  himself. He had dug a den between the roots of an old pine stump, so  that the foxes could not follow him by digging. But hard work was not  their way of life; wits they believed worth more then elbowgrease. This  woodchuck usually sunned himself on the stump each morning. If he saw a  fox near he went down in the door of his den, or if the enemy was very  near he went inside and stayed long enough for the danger to pass.    One morning Vixen and her mate seemed to decide that it was time the  children knew something about the broad subject of Woodchucks,  and further that this orchard woodchuck would serve nicely for an  object-lesson. So they went together to the orchard-fence unseen by old  Chuckie on his stump. Scarface then showed himself in the orchard and  quietly walked in a line so as to pass by the stump at a distance, but  never once turned his head or allowed the ever-watchful woodchuck to  think himself seen. When the fox entered the field the woodchuck quietly  dropped down to the mouth of his den: here he waited as the fox passed,  but concluding that after all wisdom is the better part, went into his  hole.    This was what the foxes wanted. Vixen had kept out of sight, but now ran  swiftly to the stump and hid behind it. Scarface had kept straight on,  going very slowly. The woodchuck had not been frightened, so before long  his head popped up between the roots and he looked around. There was  that fox still going on, farther and farther away. The woodchuck grew  bold as the fox went, and came out farther, and then seeing the coast  clear, he scrambled onto the stump, and with one spring Vixen had him  and shook him till he lay senseless. Scarface had watched out of the  corner of his eye and now came running back. But Vixen took the chuck in  her jaws and made for the den, so he saw he wasn't needed.    Back to the den came Vix, and carried the chuck so carefully that he was  able to struggle a little when she got there. A low 'woof' at the den  brought the little fellows out like schoolboys to play. She threw the  wounded animal to them and they set on him like four little furies,  uttering little growls and biting little bites with all the strength of  their baby jaws, but the woodchuck fought for his life and beating them  off slowly hobbled to the shelter of a thicket. The little ones pursued  like a pack of hounds and dragged at his tail and flanks, but could not  hold him back. So Vixen overtook him with a couple of bounds and dragged  him again into the open for the children to worry. Again and again this  rough sport went on till one of the little ones was badly bitten, and  his squeal of pain roused Vix to end the woodchuck's misery and serve  him up at once.    Not far from the den was a hollow overgrown with coarse grass, the  playground of a colony of field-mice. The earliest lesson in woodcraft  that the little ones took, away from the den, was in this hollow.  Here they had their first course of mice, the easiest of all game. In  teaching, the main thing was example, aided by a deep-set instinct.  The old fox, also, had one or two signs meaning \"lie still and watch,\"  \"come, do as I do,\" and so on, that were much used.    So the merry lot went to this hollow one calm evening and Mother Fox  made them lie still in the grass. Presently a faint squeak showed that  the game was astir. Vix rose up and went on tiptoe into the grass--not  crouching but as high as she could stand, sometimes on her hind legs so  as to get a better view. The runs that the mice follow are hidden under  the grass tangle, and the only way to know the whereabouts of a mouse is  by seeing the slight shaking of the grass, which is the reason why mice  are hunted only on calm days.    And the trick is to locate the mouse and seize him first and see him  afterward. Vix soon made a spring, and in the middle of the bunch of  dead grass that she grabbed was a field-mouse squeaking his last squeak.    He was soon gobbled, and the four awkward little foxes tried to do the  same as their mother, and when at length the eldest for the first time  in his life caught game, he quivered with excitement and ground his  pearly little milk-teeth into the mouse with a rush of inborn savageness  that must have surprised even himself.    Another home lesson was on the red-squirrel. One of these noisy, vulgar  creatures, lived close by and used to waste part of each day scolding  the foxes from some safe perch. The cubs made many vain attempts to  catch him as he ran across their glade from one tree to an other, or  spluttered and scolded at them a foot or so out of reach. But old Vixen  was up in natural history--she knew squirrel nature and took the case in  hand when the proper time came. She hid the children and lay down flat  in the middle of the open glade. The saucy low-minded squirrel came  and scolded as usual. But she moved no hair. He came nearer and at last  right over head to chatter:    \"You brute you, you brute you.\"    But Vix lay as dead. This was very perplexing, so the squirrel came down  the trunk and peeping about made a nervous dash across the grass, to  another tree, again to scold from a safe perch.    \"You brute you, you useless brute, scarrr-scarrrr.\"    But flat and lifeless on the grass lay Vix. This was most tantilizing to  the squirrel. He was naturally curious and disposed to be venturesome,  so again he came to the ground and scurried across the glade nearer than  before. Still as death lay Vix, \"surely she was dead.\" And the little  foxes began to wonder if their mother wasn't asleep.    But the squirrel was working himself into a little craze of foolhardy  curiosity. He had dropped a piece of bark on Vix's head, he had used up  his list of bad words and he had done it all over again, without getting  a sign of life. So after a couple more dashes across the glade he  ventured within a few feet of the really watchful Vix, who sprang to her  feet and pinned him in a twinkling.    \"And the little ones picked the bones e-oh.\"    Thus the rudiments of their education were laid, and afterward as  they grew stronger they were taken farther afield to begin the higher  branches of trailing and scenting.    For each kind of prey they were taught a way to hunt, for every animal  has some great strength or it could not live, and some great weakness  or the others could not live. The squirrel's weakness was foolish  curiosity; the fox's that he can't climb a tree. And the training of  the little foxes was all shaped to take advantage of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30310"],[0,"Special Report on Diseases of Cattle (#15)"],[1,"important organs, and, interfering with their  natural functions, are productive of conditions of ill health which,  although not necessarily fatal, are important. Such might properly be  called chronic poisons. Poisons of themselves dangerous when administered  in large doses are used medicinally for curative purposes, and a very large  percentage of the pharmaceutical preparations used in the practice of  medicine if given in excessive quantities may produce serious results. In  the administration of medicines, therefore, care should be exercised not  only that the animal is not poisoned by the administration of an excessive  dose but that injury is not done by continued treatment with medicines the  administration of which is not called for.      MINERAL POISONS.    ARSENIC POISONING.    Of the common irritant and corrosive poisons, arsenic, especially one of  its compounds (Paris green), is likely to be the most dangerous to our  class of patients. The common practice of using Paris green and other  compounds of arsenic as insecticides for the destruction of potato beetle  and other insect enemies of the farmer and fruit grower has had the effect  of introducing it into almost all farming establishments. White arsenic is  also a principal ingredient in some popular dipping preparations, and  poisoning from this source occasionally takes place when, after dipping,  animals are allowed to run in a yard in which there is loose fodder. The  drippings from the animals falling on the fodder render it poisonous and  dangerous to animal life if eaten. Familiarity with its use has in many  instances tended to breed contempt for its potency as a poison. Rat poisons  often contain arsenic. The excessive use of arsenic as a tonic, or of  \"condition powders\" containing arsenic, has been the means of poisoning  many animals. This is the common poison used by malicious persons with  criminal intent. The poison may also be absorbed through wounds or through  the skin if used as a dip or bath.    If a large dose is given, at once acute poisoning is produced; if repeated  small doses are given, chronic poisoning may result. The poisonous dose for  an ox is from 3 drams to 1 ounce.    _Symptoms._--The symptoms of acute poisoning first appear as those of  colic; the animal is restless, stamping with the feet, lying down and  getting up. There is tenderness on pressure over the abdomen. The acute  symptoms increase; in a few hours violent diarrhea is developed; in many  cases blood and shreds of detached mucous membrane are mixed with the  evacuations. There is irregular and feeble pulse and respiration, and death  is likely to supervene between the eighteenth hour and the third day. If  the latter period is passed, there is a reasonable hope of recovery.    In chronic poisoning the symptoms are similar to those of chronic  gastrointestinal catarrh, with indigestion, diarrhea, and general weakness  and loss of condition.    _Treatment._--The antidote for arsenic is a solution of hydrated oxid of  iron in water. It should be prepared fresh by mixing a solution of sulphate  of iron, made by dissolving 4 ounces of sulphate of iron in one-half pint  water, with a suspension of 1 ounce of magnesia in one-half pint water.  This quantity is sufficient for one dose for a cow and may be repeated in  an hour, if much arsenic was taken. A solution of calcined magnesia or  powdered iron or iron filings or iron scale from a blacksmith's forge may  be given in the absence of other remedies. Powdered sulphur is of some  value as an antidote. One must also administer protectives, such as linseed  tea, barley water, whites of eggs, etc.      LEAD POISONING.    Lead poisoning of cattle sometimes comes from their having licked freshly  painted surfaces and thus swallowed compounds containing white lead. In  several instances cattle have been poisoned by silage from a silo painted  inside with lead paint shortly before filling. Sometimes cattle eat dried  paint scrapings with apparent relish and are poisoned. Cattle grazing on  rifle ranges have been poisoned by lead from the bullets. Sugar of lead has  been administered by mistake for Glauber's salt. Lead poisoning may be  acute or chronic. The fatal dose of sugar of lead is from 1 to 4 ounces.  Water drawn from lead pipes or held in a lead-lined tank may cause  poisoning.    _Symptoms._--The symptoms are generally dullness, lying down with the head  turned toward the flank, colic, rumbling in the abdomen, loss of control of  the limbs when walking, twitching, champing of the jaws, moving in a  circle, convulsions, delirium, violent bellowing, followed by stupor and  death. The symptoms generally extend over considerable time but may end in  death after 24 hours.    _Chronic lead poisoning_ occasionally occurs in districts where lead mining  is the principal industry. The waste products of the mine thrown into  streams contaminate the water supply, so that the mineral is taken into the  system gradually, and a very small per cent of any of the salts taken into  the system in this way is pernicious. Water which contains any salt of lead  to the extent of more than one-tenth of a grain to the gallon is unfit to  drink. Such water when used continually is likely to produce colic from the  resulting intestinal irritation, and in aggravated cases paralysis more or  less severe is likely to be developed. A blue line on the margin of the  gums, the last symptom, is regarded as diagnostic and its presence as  conclusive evidence of the nature of the disorder.    _Treatment._--The treatment should first be directed toward removing the  cause. A large dose of purgative medicine should be given, and the brain  symptoms be relieved by giving bromid of potassium in half-ounce doses  every 4 or 5 hours and by the application of cold water to the head. Dilute  sulphuric acid in half-ounce doses should be given with the purgative  medicine. In this case sulphate of magnesia (Epsom salt) is the best  purgative, and it may be given in doses of from 1 to 2 pounds dissolved in  warm water. After the acute symptoms have abated, iodid of potassium may be  given, in doses of 2 drams each, three times a day for a week.    No treatment is likely to be of avail until the cause is removed.      COPPER POISONING.    The soluble salts of copper, though used as a tonic in the medicinal  treatment of cattle, are poisonous when taken in large quantities. Like  lead and arsenic, they have an irritant effect upon the mucous membrane  with which they come in contact in a concentrated form. Cattle are not very  likely to be poisoned from this cause unless through carelessness. Sulphate  of copper, commonly called blue vitriol, is occasionally used for  disinfecting and cleansing stables, where it might inadvertently be mixed  with the feed. It is also used largely for making the Bordeaux mixture used  in spraying fruit trees. The general symptoms produced are those of  intestinal irritation, short breathing, stamping, and tender abdomen.    _Treatment._--Give powdered iron, or iron reduced by hydrogen, or calcined  magnesia. Sulphur may be used. This should be followed by a liberal supply  of demulcents, linseed infusion, boiled starch, whites of eggs, etc.      ZINC POISONING.    Several of the soluble salts of zinc are irritant poisons. The chlorid and  sulphate are those in most common use. In animals which have power to vomit  they are emetic in their action. In others, when retained in the stomach,  they set up more or less irritation of the mucous membrane and abdominal  pain, producing symptoms already described in the action of other poisons  which produce the same result.    _Treatment._--The treatment should be the same as for copper poisoning.      PHOSPHORUS POISONING.    Only one of the forms of phosphorus in common use--the ordinary yellow--is  poisonous. Phosphorus in this form is used for the destruction of rats and  mice and other vermin, and has been largely used in the manufacture of  matches.    _Symptoms._--The symptoms are loss of appetite, colic, diarrhea, irritation  of the mouth and throat, and paralysis of the throat. There is also  weakness, difficult breathing, and rapid pulse. The course of the poisoning  is usually rapid, terminating in either recovery or death within three  days. The toxic dose for cattle is from 5 to 30 grains. If taken in large  quantities the excreta are occasionally noticed to be luminous when  examined in the dark.    _Treatment._--Turpentine is given in an emulsion with flaxseed tea in a  single dose of from 2 to 8 ounces. Permanganate of potassium may be given  in a one-fourth of 1 per cent solution. Stimulants, such as alcohol and  ether, should be administered. Oils and milk must not be given.      MERCURY POISONING.    Mercury poisoning is not rare in cattle from the fact that these animals  have a special susceptibility to the action of this substance. Antiseptic  washes or injections containing the bichlorid of mercury (corrosive  sublimate) must be used on cattle with great care. Mercurial disinfecting  solutions or salves must be used cautiously. Calomel can not be given  freely to cattle.    _Symptoms._--The symptoms are salivation, sore mouth, indigestion,  diarrhea, skin eruption, paralysis of local groups of muscles, and  nephritis.    _Treatment._--The treatment consists in administering sulphur in large  doses (2 to 4 ounces) or iron powder. Both make insoluble compounds with  mercury. Follow with the whites of eggs mixed with water and with linseed  tea. If the case does not terminate promptly, give iodid of potash in  1-dram doses twice daily.      POISONING BY ACIDS.    MINERAL ACIDS.--The mineral acids--nitric, sulphuric, hydrochloric, etc.--  when used in a concentrated form destroy the animal tissues with which they  come in contact, and in this respect differ from most of the poisons  previously described. When taken into the stomach the mucous membrane "]]]
