Sheridan, General, United States Army â€” Complete (#15)"],[1," morning to see me and tell me of the situation Mary  informed me that she had done all in her power to bring the Indians  to reason, but without avail, and that they were determined to fight  rather than deliver up the sixteen men who had engaged in the  shooting.  She also apprised me of the fact that they had taken up a  position on the Yamhill River, on the direct road between the post  and village, where, painted and armed for war, they were awaiting  attack.    On this information I concluded it would be best to march to the  village by a circuitous route instead of directly, as at first  intended, so I had the ferry-boat belonging to the post floated about  a mile and a half down the Yamhill River and there anchored.  At 11  o'clock that night I marched my fifty men, out of the garrison, in a  direction opposite to that of the point held by the Indians, and soon  reached the river at the ferryboat.  Here I ferried the party over  with little delay, and marched them along the side of the mountain,  through underbrush and fallen timber, until, just before daylight, I  found that we were immediately in rear of the village, and thence in  rear, also, of the line occupied by the refractory Indians, who were  expecting to meet me on the direct road from the post.  Just at break  of day we made a sudden descent upon the village and took its  occupants completely by surprise, even capturing the chief of the  tribe, \"Sam,\" who was dressed in all his war toggery, fully armed and  equipped, in anticipation of a fight on the road where his comrades  were in position.  I at once put Sam under guard, giving orders to  kill him instantly if the Indians fired a shot; then forming my line  on the road beyond the edge of the village, in rear of the force  lying in wait for a front attack, we moved forward.  When the hostile  party realized that they were completely cut off from the village,  they came out from their stronghold on the river and took up a line  in my front, distant about sixty yards with the apparent intention of  resisting to the last.    As is usual with Indians when expecting a fight, they were nearly  naked, fantastically painted with blue clay, and hideously arrayed in  war bonnets.  They seemed very belligerent, brandishing their muskets  in the air, dancing on one foot, calling us ugly names, and making  such other demonstrations of hostility, that it seemed at first that  nothing short of the total destruction of the party could bring about  the definite settlement that we were bent on.  Still, as it was my  desire to bring them under subjection without loss of life, if  possible, I determined to see what result would follow when they  learned that their chief was at our mercy.  So, sending Sam under  guard to the front, where he could be seen, informing them that he  would be immediately shot if they fired upon us, and aided by the  cries and lamentations of the women of the village, who deprecated  any hostile action by either party, I soon procured a parley.    The insubordinate Indians were under command of \"Joe,\" Sam's brother,  who at last sent me word that he wanted to see me, and we met between  our, respective lines.  I talked kindly to him, but was firm in my  demand that the men who killed the woman must be given up and my  six-shooter returned.  His reply was he did not think it could be done,  but he would consult his people.  After the consultation, he returned  and notified me that fifteen would surrender and the six-shooter  would be restored, and further, that we could kill the sixteenth man,  since the tribe wished to get rid of him anyhow, adding that he was a  bad Indian, whose bullet no doubt had given the woman her death  wound.  He said that if I assented to this arrangement, he would  require all of his people except the objectionable man to run to the  right of his line at a preconcerted signal.  The bad Indian would be  ordered to stand fast on the extreme left, and we could open fire on  him as his comrades fell away to the right.  I agreed to the  proposition, and gave Joe fifteen minutes to execute his part of it.  We then returned to our respective forces, and a few minutes later  the fifteen ran to the right flank as agreed upon, and we opened fire  on the one Indian left standing alone, bringing him down in his  tracks severely wounded by a shot through the shoulder.    While all this was going on, the other bands of the reservation,  several thousand strong, had occupied the surrounding hills for the  purpose of witnessing the fight, for as the Rogue Rivers had been  bragging for some time that they could whip the soldiers, these other  Indians had come out to see it done.  The result, however,  disappointed the spectators, and the Rogue Rivers naturally lost  caste.  The fifteen men now came in and laid down their arms  (including my six-shooter) in front of us as agreed, but I compelled  them to take the surrendered guns up again and carry them to the  post, where they were deposited in the block-house for future  security.  The prisoners were ironed with ball and chain, and made to  work at the post until their rebellious spirit was broken; and the  wounded man was correspondingly punished after he had fully  recovered.  An investigation as to why this man had been selected as  the offering by which Joe and his companions expected to gain  immunity, showed that the fellow was really a most worthless  character, whose death even would have been a benefit to the tribe.  Thus it seemed that they had two purposes in view--the one to  propitiate me and get good terms, the other to rid themselves of a  vagabond member of the tribe.    The punishment of these sixteen Indians by ball and chain ended all  trouble with the Rogue River tribe.  The, disturbances arising from  the incantations of the doctors and doctresses, and the practice of  killing horses and burning all worldly property on the graves of  those who died, were completely suppressed, and we made with little  effort a great stride toward the civilization of these crude and  superstitious people, for they now began to recognize the power of  the Government.  In their management afterward a course of justice  and mild force was adopted, and unvaryingly applied.  They were  compelled to cultivate their land, to attend church, and to send  their children to school.  When I saw them, fifteen years later,  transformed into industrious and substantial farmers, with neat  houses, fine cattle, wagons and horses, carrying their grain, eggs,  and butter to market and bringing home flour, coffee, sugar, and  calico in return, I found abundant confirmation of my early opinion  that the most effectual measures for lifting them from a state of  barbarism would be a practical supervision at the outset, coupled  with a firm control and mild discipline.    In all that was done for these Indians Captain Russell's judgment and  sound, practical ideas were the inspiration.  His true manliness,  honest and just methods, together with the warm-hearted interest he  took in all that pertained to matters of duty to his Government,  could not have produced other than the best results, in what position  soever he might have been placed.  As all the lovable traits of his  character were constantly manifested, I became most deeply attached  to him, and until the day of his death in 1864, on the battle-field  of Opequan, in front of Winchester, while gallantly leading his  division under my command, my esteem and affection were sustained and  intensified by the same strong bonds that drew me to him in these  early days in Oregon.    After the events just narrated I continued on duty at the post of  Yamhill, experiencing the usual routine of garrison life without any  incidents of much interest, down to the breaking out of the war of  the rebellion in April, 1861.  The news of the firing on Fort Sumter  brought us an excitement which overshadowed all else, and though we  had no officers at the post who sympathized with the rebellion, there  were several in our regiment--the Fourth Infantry--who did, and we  were considerably exercised as to the course they might pursue, but  naturally far more so concerning the disposition that would be made  of the regiment during the conflict.    In due time orders came for the regiment to go East, and my company  went off, leaving me, however--a second lieutenant--in command of the  post until I should be relieved by Captain James J. Archer, of the  Ninth Infantry, whose company was to take the place of the old  garrison.  Captain Archer, with his company of the Ninth, arrived  shortly after, but I had been notified that he intended to go South,  and his conduct was such after reaching the post that I would not  turn over the command to him for fear he might commit some rebellious  act.  Thus a more prolonged detention occurred than I had at first  anticipated.  Finally the news came that he had tendered his  resignation and been granted a leave of absence for sixty days.  On  July 17 he took his departure, but I continued in command till  September 1, when Captain Philip A. Owen, of the Ninth Infantry,  arrived and, taking charge, gave me my release.    From the day we received the news of the firing on Sumter until I  started East, about the first of September, 1861, I was deeply  solicitous as to the course of events, and though I felt confident  that in the end the just cause of the Government must triumph, yet  the thoroughly crystallized organization which the Southern  Confederacy quickly exhibited disquieted me very much, for it alone  was evidence that the Southern leaders had long anticipated the  struggle and prepared for it.  It was very difficult to obtain direct  intelligence of the progress of the war.  Most of the time we were in  the depths of ignorance as to the true condition of affairs, and this  tended to increase our anxiety.  Then, too, the accounts of the  conflicts that had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4363"],[0,"Beyond Good and Evil (#15)"],[1," talk much about oneself may also be a means of concealing  oneself.    170. In praise there is more obtrusiveness than in blame.    171. Pity has an almost ludicrous effect on a man of knowledge, like  tender hands on a Cyclops.    172. One occasionally embraces some one or other, out of love to mankind  (because one cannot embrace all); but this is what one must never  confess to the individual.    173. One does not hate as long as one disesteems, but only when one  esteems equal or superior.    174. Ye Utilitarians--ye, too, love the UTILE only as a VEHICLE for  your inclinations,--ye, too, really find the noise of its wheels  insupportable!    175. One loves ultimately one's desires, not the thing desired.    176. The vanity of others is only counter to our taste when it is  counter to our vanity.    177. With regard to what \"truthfulness\" is, perhaps nobody has ever been  sufficiently truthful.    178. One does not believe in the follies of clever men: what a  forfeiture of the rights of man!    179. The consequences of our actions seize us by the forelock, very  indifferent to the fact that we have meanwhile \"reformed.\"    180. There is an innocence in lying which is the sign of good faith in a  cause.    181. It is inhuman to bless when one is being cursed.    182. The familiarity of superiors embitters one, because it may not be  returned.    183. \"I am affected, not because you have deceived me, but because I can  no longer believe in you.\"    184. There is a haughtiness of kindness which has the appearance of  wickedness.    185. \"I dislike him.\"--Why?--\"I am not a match for him.\"--Did any one  ever answer so?        CHAPTER V. THE NATURAL HISTORY OF MORALS      186. The moral sentiment in Europe at present is perhaps as subtle,  belated, diverse, sensitive, and refined, as the \"Science of Morals\"  belonging thereto is recent, initial, awkward, and coarse-fingered:--an  interesting contrast, which sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious  in the very person of a moralist. Indeed, the expression, \"Science  of Morals\" is, in respect to what is designated thereby, far too  presumptuous and counter to GOOD taste,--which is always a foretaste of  more modest expressions. One ought to avow with the utmost fairness WHAT  is still necessary here for a long time, WHAT is alone proper for the  present: namely, the collection of material, the comprehensive survey  and classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiments of worth,  and distinctions of worth, which live, grow, propagate, and perish--and  perhaps attempts to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common  forms of these living crystallizations--as preparation for a THEORY OF  TYPES of morality. To be sure, people have not hitherto been so modest.  All the philosophers, with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness,  demanded of themselves something very much higher, more pretentious, and  ceremonious, when they concerned themselves with morality as a science:  they wanted to GIVE A BASIC to morality--and every philosopher hitherto  has believed that he has given it a basis; morality itself, however, has  been regarded as something \"given.\" How far from their awkward pride  was the seemingly insignificant problem--left in dust and decay--of a  description of forms of morality, notwithstanding that the finest hands  and senses could hardly be fine enough for it! It was precisely owing to  moral philosophers' knowing the moral facts imperfectly, in an arbitrary  epitome, or an accidental abridgement--perhaps as the morality of  their environment, their position, their church, their Zeitgeist, their  climate and zone--it was precisely because they were badly instructed  with regard to nations, eras, and past ages, and were by no means eager  to know about these matters, that they did not even come in sight of the  real problems of morals--problems which only disclose themselves by  a comparison of MANY kinds of morality. In every \"Science of Morals\"  hitherto, strange as it may sound, the problem of morality itself  has been OMITTED: there has been no suspicion that there was anything  problematic there! That which philosophers called \"giving a basis to  morality,\" and endeavoured to realize, has, when seen in a right light,  proved merely a learned form of good FAITH in prevailing morality, a new  means of its EXPRESSION, consequently just a matter-of-fact within the  sphere of a definite morality, yea, in its ultimate motive, a sort of  denial that it is LAWFUL for this morality to be called in question--and  in any case the reverse of the testing, analyzing, doubting, and  vivisecting of this very faith. Hear, for instance, with what  innocence--almost worthy of honour--Schopenhauer represents his own  task, and draw your conclusions concerning the scientificness of a  \"Science\" whose latest master still talks in the strain of children and  old wives: \"The principle,\" he says (page 136 of the Grundprobleme der  Ethik), [Footnote: Pages 54-55 of Schopenhauer's Basis of Morality,  translated by Arthur B. Bullock, M.A. (1903).] \"the axiom about the  purport of which all moralists are PRACTICALLY agreed: neminem laede,  immo omnes quantum potes juva--is REALLY the proposition which all moral  teachers strive to establish, ... the REAL basis of ethics which  has been sought, like the philosopher's stone, for centuries.\"--The  difficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed be  great--it is well known that Schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in his  efforts; and whoever has thoroughly realized how absurdly false and  sentimental this proposition is, in a world whose essence is Will  to Power, may be reminded that Schopenhauer, although a pessimist,  ACTUALLY--played the flute... daily after dinner: one may read about  the matter in his biography. A question by the way: a pessimist, a  repudiator of God and of the world, who MAKES A HALT at morality--who  assents to morality, and plays the flute to laede-neminem morals, what?  Is that really--a pessimist?    187. Apart from the value of such assertions as \"there is a categorical  imperative in us,\" one can always ask: What does such an assertion  indicate about him who makes it? There are systems of morals which are  meant to justify their author in the eyes of other people; other systems  of morals are meant to tranquilize him, and make him self-satisfied;  with other systems he wants to crucify and humble himself, with others  he wishes to take revenge, with others to conceal himself, with others  to glorify himself and gave superiority and distinction,--this system of  morals helps its author to forget, that system makes him, or something  of him, forgotten, many a moralist would like to exercise power and  creative arbitrariness over mankind, many another, perhaps, Kant  especially, gives us to understand by his morals that \"what is estimable  in me, is that I know how to obey--and with you it SHALL not be  otherwise than with me!\" In short, systems of morals are only a  SIGN-LANGUAGE OF THE EMOTIONS.    188. In contrast to laisser-aller, every system of morals is a sort of  tyranny against \"nature\" and also against \"reason\", that is, however, no  objection, unless one should again decree by some system of morals, that  all kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful What is  essential and invaluable in every system of morals, is that it is a  long constraint. In order to understand Stoicism, or Port Royal,  or Puritanism, one should remember the constraint under which every  language has attained to strength and freedom--the metrical constraint,  the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm. How much trouble have the poets and  orators of every nation given themselves!--not excepting some of  the prose writers of today, in whose ear dwells an inexorable  conscientiousness--\"for the sake of a folly,\" as utilitarian bunglers  say, and thereby deem themselves wise--\"from submission to arbitrary  laws,\" as the anarchists say, and thereby fancy themselves \"free,\" even  free-spirited. The singular fact remains, however, that everything  of the nature of freedom, elegance, boldness, dance, and masterly  certainty, which exists or has existed, whether it be in thought itself,  or in administration, or in speaking and persuading, in art just as in  conduct, has only developed by means of the tyranny of such arbitrary  law, and in all seriousness, it is not at all improbable that precisely  this is \"nature\" and \"natural\"--and not laisser-aller! Every artist  knows how different from the state of letting himself go, is his  \"most natural\" condition, the free arranging, locating, disposing,  and constructing in the moments of \"inspiration\"--and how strictly and  delicately he then obeys a thousand laws, which, by their very rigidness  and precision, defy all formulation by means of ideas (even the most  stable idea has, in comparison therewith, something floating, manifold,  and ambiguous in it). The essential thing \"in heaven and in earth\" is,  apparently (to repeat it once more), that there should be long OBEDIENCE  in the same direction, there thereby results, and has always resulted in  the long run, something which has made life worth living; for instance,  virtue, art, music, dancing, reason, spirituality--anything whatever  that is transfiguring, refined, foolish, or divine. The long bondage of  the spirit, the distrustful constraint in the communicability of  ideas, the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think  in accordance with the rules of a church or a court, or conformable  to Aristotelian premises, the persistent spiritual will to interpret  everything that happened according to a Christian scheme, and in every  occurrence to rediscover and justify the Christian God:--all this  violence, arbitrariness, severity, dreadfulness, and unreasonableness,  has proved itself the disciplinary means whereby the European spirit has  attained its strength, its remorseless"]]]
