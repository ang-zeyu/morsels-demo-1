More cells will be added, and the construction of these will be  better; the colony grows, and there are signs of some prosperity. The  old mother finds herself now at the head of a little kingdom which might  serve as the model on which that of our honey-bee was formed. But the  model is still in the rough. The good-fortune of the humble-bee never  lasts. If they have laws, they do not obey them; the elder bees will at  times devour the larvae, the buildings still are far from perfect and  much material has been wasted in putting them up; but the most  remarkable and essential difference between the two is that the  honey-bees' city will endure forever while the poor shelter that the  humble-bees have raised will disappear when the winter comes, its two or  three hundred inhabitants all perishing, with the exception of one  single female. The others have vanished, and left no trace behind; she,  when next spring comes, will begin again, in the same solitude and  poverty as her mother before her, and with the same useless result.      Yet another stage up, and we find a more civilized class of bee, whose  organization is as complete as in our own hives. The males of this race,  which are known as the \"Meliponitae,\" are not wholly idle, and they help  in the secretion of wax. The entrance to the hive is carefully guarded;  it has a door that can be closed when nights are cold, and a sort of  curtain that will let air in when the heat is oppressive. But still  there is not the same good government, the same security and general  prosperity, as among the honey-bees. Labor is not so well distributed;  much less skill is shown in the designing of the city, and the spirit of  the hive is not so fully developed.    It is only about a hundred and ninety years ago that people first began  to study the habits of wild bees; at that time few were known, and  although since then many others have been observed, there may be  hundreds, possibly thousands, of whom we know very little. It was in the  year 1730 that the first book on the subject was published; and the  humble-bees, all powdered with gold, that were feasting then on the  flowers, were precisely the same, as regards their habits and ways, as  those that to-morrow will be noisily buzzing in the woods round about  you. A hundred and ninety years, however, are but as the twinkling of an  eye; and many lives of men, placed end to end, form but a second in the  history of Nature.      Although the highest type of bee-life is found in our domestic hives, it  must not be imagined that these reveal no faults. They contain one  masterpiece, the six-sided cell, which displays absolute perfection; a  perfection that all the geniuses in the world, were they to meet in  council, could in no way improve. No living creature, not even man, has  achieved in his sphere what the bee has achieved in her own; and if some  one from another world were to descend on this globe and to ask what was  the most perfect thing that unaided reason had produced here below, we  should have to offer the humble comb of honey.    But such perfection as the honey-comb reveals is not shown in all the  works of the bee. We have already drawn attention to some shortcomings,  such as the vast number of males and their persistent idleness, the  excessive swarming, the entire absence of pity, and the almost monstrous  sacrifice that each individual is called upon to make to the community.  To these must be added a curious inclination to store enormous masses of  pollen, often far in excess of what is required; with the result that  the pollen soon turns rancid and goes solid, blocking up the surface of  the comb.    Of these defects the most serious is the repeated swarming. But here we  must bear in mind that for thousands of years the bee has been  interfered with by man. From the Egyptian of the time of Pharaoh down  to the peasant of our own day the bee-keeper has always disregarded the  desires and the intentions of the bees. The most prosperous hives are  those which send out only one swarm after the beginning of summer. They  have done their duty; they have safeguarded the future of the swarm,  which is composed of so large a number of bees that they will have ample  time to erect solid and well-provisioned dwellings before the arrival of  autumn. If man had not come in the way, it is clear that these first  swarms and their colonies would have been the only ones to survive the  hardships of winter, which would have destroyed the others, owing to  their weakness and poverty; and the bees would gradually have learned  the folly of swarming so frequently, and would have acted accordingly.  But it is precisely these prudent, careful hives that man has always  destroyed in order to possess himself of the honey which they contained.  He allowed only the feeblest colonies to survive; the second or third  swarms, which had barely sufficient food to endure through the winter.  The result will probably have been that the habit of excessive swarming  fastened itself on the bees, in whom, particularly in the black  varieties, it is much too general. For some years, however, modern and  scientific bee-keeping has done much to correct this dangerous habit;  and it is possible, perhaps, that in time the bees themselves will learn  to abandon it.      As for the other faults which we have noticed, they are probably due to  causes unknown to us, that still remain the secrets of the hive. As for  the bees' intelligence, their power of reasoning, let every one judge  for himself. To me, many actions of theirs appear to prove that they do  possess this power; but, were it otherwise, if it could be conclusively  established that all that they do is directed by some blind instinct, my  interest in them would not be one whit the less. We are taught by them  at least that there are many things in nature that we cannot understand  and cannot explain, and this induces us to look with more eagerness on  the things around us, and is not without its effect on our thoughts and  our feelings, and on all that we try to say.    And, further, I am not at all sure that our own intellect is the proper  tribunal to judge the bees and pass a verdict upon their mistakes. Do we  not ourselves live in the midst of errors and blunders without being  aware of them; and even when aware of them, are we so quick at finding  a remedy? The bees might have much to say if they passed us in review,  and criticized our world as we do theirs; they would find a good deal  to puzzle them in our own reason and moral sense, and would be compelled  to admit that we seemed to be governed by principles quite beyond their  understanding.      I have referred to the way in which man interferes with the bees; and  truly they do here provide a most admirable lesson. No matter to what  extent their own plans have been thwarted, they will none the less do  what they know to be their profound and primitive duty. And as to what  this duty may be they are never in doubt. It is written in their tongue,  in their mouth, over every organ of their body, that they are in this  world to make honey; as it is written in our eyes, our ears, our  nerves, in every lobe of our brain, that we have been created to think,  to reason, to understand, to improve our sense of justice, our  knowledge, to cultivate our soul. The bees know not who will eat the  honey they harvest, as we know not who shall profit by the spiritual  treasure we gather. As they go from flower to flower absorbing nectar  beyond what they or their hive will need, so let us go from thought to  thought, forever seeking the truth. And let the knowledge that this is  our duty quicken the zeal, the ardor and purity with which our soul  turns to the light."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38658"],[0,"Self-Instructor in the Art of Hair Work, Dressing Hair, Making Curls, Switches, (#15)"],[1,"center of the table as fast as braided, and to balance the bobbins.  Attention should be given to have the weight balance the bobbins  properly, as too great a weight will make the braid loose, or too light  a weight will leave it rough. Use any number of weights required to  balance the bobbins.          [Illustration: FORMS FOR BRAIDING OVER.    No. 1. No. 2. No. 3. No. 4.]      The above cuts are made of wire and wood, for braiding over. The Nos. 1  and 2 are for braiding chains over--the No. 1 for small chains, and the  No. 2 for large sizes. No. 3 is used for braiding tight or open work  braids, of from thirty to forty strands. No. 4 is used for the same  braids, with from forty to sixty strands in a braid. The mold may be  made any length, to accommodate the work.          [Illustration: FORMS FOR BRAIDING OVER.    No. 5. No. 6. No. 7.]      The above cuts show the size of forms used for tight or open work  braids. The No. 5 is used for braids of from sixty to eighty strands,  No. 6 of from eighty to one hundred, and No. 7 from one hundred to one  hundred and twenty, according to the fineness of the braid.          [Illustration: EXPLANATIONS ON BRACELETS.    No. 1. No. 2.]      The above cuts represent the completed Bracelet Braid. The No. 1 is  formed from fourteen small braids, braided according to diagram and  explanation on page 104,--using, however, but thirty-two strands,  instead of eighty.    After you have the small braids all completed and prepared, as required  in the explanation, sew them together at one end, so they all lie smooth  and flat, then divide them off in twos, using each two as one strand,  and plait them together; commence at the right side, take one strand at  a time, and lift over one and under two till you get to the center, then  commence on the left side and braid the same way, and so on till  finished. Then sew the ends well, trim them, and put on a little shellac  to fasten them in the clasps.    No. 2 is from the same pattern, and is prepared and finished up in the  same manner. For this Bracelet you use fifteen small braids, divide them  into threes for each strand, and lift over one and under one, from each  side to the center.          [Illustration: EXPLANATIONS ON BRACELETS.    No. 1. No. 2.]      The No. 1 cut of the above Bracelet Braids, is formed from patterns on  pages 87 and 97, and instead of using forty and sixty strands, use but  thirty-two for each. Braid six small braids from pattern on page 87, and  three from pattern on page 97. Sew them tight together at one end,  divide them off in threes, with the open work braid between the two  tight ones, use each three as one strand, and plait them together in a  common three strand braid.    No. 2 is braided according to pattern on page 89. Have three of the  braids, sew them fast at one end, and then twist them carefully and  evenly together; then sew and fasten with shellac, and it is ready for  being gold mounted.          [Illustration: EXPLANATIONS ON BRACELETS.    No. 1. No. 2.]      The No. 1 cut of the above Bracelet Braids, is formed from patterns on  pages 26 and 86. Have two small braids from each of the patterns, lay  them side by side, as in cut, and sew them firmly together, either with  some of the hair, or with very fine silk of the same color. Then sew and  trim the ends, and fasten with shellac.    No. 2 is braided from patterns on pages 18 and 86. Have four small  braids like pattern on page 18, and two like pattern on page 86. Place  them side by side, as in cut, and prepare and finish up the same as in  the above.          [Illustration: EXPLANATIONS ON BRACELETS.    No. 1. No. 2.]      The patterns used for the No. 1, represented above, are found on pages  63 and 95. Have one braid from pattern on page 63, and two from that on  page 95. Place them side by side, as in cut, sew the ends firmly  together, either with some of the hair, or with very fine silk of the  same color. Then sew and trim the ends, and fasten with shellac.    For the No. 2, use two small braids from pattern on page 18, one from  pattern on page 63, and two from pattern on page 95. Place them as in  cut, sew them together, and prepare the same as No. 1.          [Illustration: EXPLANATIONS ON BRACELETS.    No. 1. No. 2.]      The No. 1 of the above Bracelet Braids, is made up of two small braids  from pattern on page 97, and three from pattern on page 101, using,  however, but thirty-two strands, instead of sixty. Place them side by  side, as in cut, and sew them together with some of the hair, or with  fine silk of the same color. Sew, trim and shellac the ends, and they  are ready for the gold mounting.    No. 2 is formed of four small braids, from pattern on page 97, and is  prepared, sewed and finished up the same as No. 1.          LITHOGRAPHED DESIGNS.      The following Lithographic designs of Hair Jewelry, Flowers and  Pictures, are given for the purpose of showing a few of the many  beautiful forms into which the human hair may be transposed. Each and  every one of the devices on the following pages, with the exception of  the flowers and pictures, can be braided from the diagrams and  explanations given in the first one hundred and twenty pages of this  book. Select any article you may wish to make, and by referring to the  patterns, you can easily find the style and directions whereby to braid  it. We might have given twice the number of patterns, or even more, but  any person can, after a little experience, readily invent new and  different styles of braids, and by so doing, each can satisfy their own  peculiar taste.    The making of Hair Flowers is very simple, and yet, of course, every one  has first to learn it. Supply yourself with as many different colors of  hair as you can, and by applying Gum Tragacanth, it renders it capable  of being cut in any shape you may wish--such as leaves, twigs, buds,  &c., and by judiciously arranging the colors, the effect will be very  pleasing. Pictures are made in the same manner, and any one possessing  the least artistic skill, can make any flower or picture they may  desire, and many pleasing adornments and lasting mementos may thereby be  had.    All articles intended to be worn as jewelry, should, of course, be  mounted with gold, and as this kind of work is not done in all jewelry  establishments, I wish to say that my facilities for this branch of  business is complete, and the work done is in the best possible manner.  I can guarantee satisfaction in all cases, let the style desired be what  it may. In sending braids to be mounted, draw on paper, as near as can  be, the style or design you want.

[Illustration]    The above cut represents the apparatus used for weaving hair into  Switches, Curls, Wigs, &c. It is a very simple arrangement, and can be  easily constructed. Provide two straight sticks, about twelve inches  long, and in one of them bore three small holes, two inches apart, in  which to place as many thumb-screws, to be used for tightening or  loosening the cords; in the other, have a single wooden pin or nail, to  fasten the cords to. Place the sticks in a firm, upright position, about  three feet apart, either by boring holes through a table, or by using  mortised blocks, such as is plainly shown in cut, at the right end.  After placing them in position, put on three cords, as shown in diagram,  numbered 1, 2 and 3. For this weft use linen thread, at Nos. 1, 2 and 3.    In commencing to weave, place the hair between two cards, as shown in  diagram, and draw out with the right hand, between the thumb and  fore-finger, the quantity of hair required for the size of the weft;  then change it into the left hand, and place it up to the threads, Nos.  1, 2 and 3, as shown in diagram; lay the strand over No. 1, under No. 2,  over No. 3, around under No. 3, over Nos. 2 and 1, around under Nos. 1  and 2, over No. 3, around under Nos. 3 and 2, and over No. 1. Then push  the strands together, as in cut.          [Illustration: SEWING SWITCHES.    No. 1. No. 2.]      The No. 1 of the above cuts represents the winding and sewing of the  switch after it is woven. For sewing a switch on points, after weaving,  take Berlin cord, about one-sixteenth of an inch thick, and tie a solid  knot at the end, and sew the end of the weft to the knotted end of the  cord; then wind the weft around the cord, as shown in cut, the length of  point desired, turning the end of the cord over to form a loop. Cut the  weft according to the number of points desired in the switch. Cut No. 2  shows the switch all complete.          WEAVING HAIR FOR CURLS.      [Illustration]    In commencing to weave, place the hair between two cards, or stiff  brushes, as shown in diagram, pressing them tight together, so that in  drawing out, it is perfectly free from tangles; draw out with the right  hand, between the thumb and fore-finger, the quantity of hair required  for the size of the weft; then change it into the left hand, and lift it  up to the No. 1 cord, as shown in diagram; lay the strand over No. 1,  under No. 2, over No. 3, around under No. 3, over Nos. 2 and 1, around  under Nos. 1 and 2, over No. 3, around under No. 3, over No. 2, and  under No. 1. Then push the strands together, as shown in diagram. For  this weft use fine, strong linen thread.          MAKING AND PREPARING CURLS.      [Illustration: No. 1.]    [Illustration: No. 2.]    After weaving, according to directions on page 241, take a piece of  ribbon an inch wide, the same color of hair, and as long as you wish the  curls to be in width, "]]]
