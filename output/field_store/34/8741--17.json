She could imagine the face Mercy Curtis \"pulled,\" as well,  and did not wonder that the two little ones took to their heels and  ran away as fast as ever they could.    But, thus prepared for an unpleasant greeting from, the unfortunate  and much to be pitied Mercy, Ruth smiled happily herself and waved her  hand at the lame girl's window. Mercy saw her and, for a moment, was  stricken with surprise so that she could neither greet her with frown  or smile. She knew the girl from the Red Mill, although she had seen  her so many weeks before; but Ruth ran into the yard and up the porch  steps at the side of the house, and knocked at the door before the  lame girl recovered from her amazement.    The motherly Mrs. Curtis came to the door and, the moment she saw who  it was, received Ruth with open arms.    \"You dear child! I am so glad you have come again. Did Doctor Davison  tell you?\" she whispered.    \"He told me that Mercy would be glad to see me again; but I should  have come before, as I promised, if I could have gotten in,\" Ruth  said. \"Will she see me?\"    \"She is not so well to-day,\" sighed the harassed mother. \"This is one  of her days of torment. I do not know how she will treat you, Ruth  Fielding; but don't mind what she says to you, dear. Your being here  will take her mind off her pain and off her own self.\"    Ruth laid aside her hat and coat and went into the sitting room. The  crippled girl was in her wheel chair by the window. The instant Ruth  entered she seized the wheels on either side and propelled the chair  across the room in a sudden dash that threatened to run her visitor  down. And her face was screwed up into such a mean look, and her eyes  flashed so angrily, that Ruth was startled for a moment. But she stood  her ground and instead of colliding with her, the nervous hands  brought the chair to a sudden stop right before her.    \"Thought you were going to be run down; didn't you?\" snapped Mercy.  \"I'd ought to break your legs--you run on them so fine. Showing off;  wasn't you?\"    She was offended because Ruth had run so lightly into the cottage and  the girl from the Red Mill made a decision there and then that she  would never come in to see Mercy again saving at a sedate walk. But  she laughed lightly, and said:    \"Do you want me to come on crutches, Mercy? That wouldn't help you a  bit.\"    She put out her hand to take the lame girl's, but Mercy struck it  smartly with her own, then whirled her chair around and returned to  her former position by the window. She handled the wheel chair with  remarkable dexterity, and Ruth, following her and taking a neighboring  chair said:    \"How quick you are! You get around your room so nicely. I think that's  fine.\"    \"You do; do you?\" snapped the cripple. \"If you'd been tied to this  chair like I have, you'd be quick, too. I suppose it's something for  me to be grateful for; eh?\"    \"It must be a lot better than lying abed all the time,\" said Ruth,  quietly.    \"Oh, yes! I suppose so!\" snapped Mercy. Her conversation was mostly  made up of snaps and snarls. \"Everybody tells me all about how happy I  ought to be because I'm not worse off than I am. That's their  tormenting ways--I know 'em! There!\" she added, looking out of the  window. \"Here's another of those dratted young ones!\"    Ruth glanced out, too. A lady was coming along the walk holding a  little boy by the hand. Before they reached the cottage the little boy  said something to his mother and then broke away from her hand and  went to the other side of her, nearest the curb.    \"There! he's hiding from me,\" said Mercy, bitterly.    The lady looked up and smiled pleasantly, but the cripple only  returned her pleasant salutation with a cold nod. The child peeped out  from around his mother's skirt.    \"There! go along, you nasty little thing!\" muttered Mercy. \"See him  trot on his little fat legs. I wish a dog would bite 'em!\" It was  useless, Ruth saw, to try and bring the cripple to a better mind. But  she ignored her sallies at people who went by the window, and began to  talk about the Red Mill and all that had happened to her since she had  come to live with Uncle Jabez. Gradually she drew Mercy's attention  from the street. She told about the flood, and how she, with Helen and  Tom, had raced in the big automobile down the river road to warn the  people that the water was coming. Mercy's eyes grew big with wonder  and she listened with increasing interest.    \"That's a nice place to live--that mill,\" the cripple finally  admitted, grudgingly. \"And it's right on the river, too!\"    \"I can look 'way up and down the river from my window the first thing  when I get up in the morning,\" Ruth said. \"It's very pretty at  sunrise. And then, the orchard and the fields are pretty. And I like  to see the men ploughing and working the land. And the garden stuff is  all coming up so pretty and green.\"    \"I've got a garden, too. But it's not warm enough yet to plant many  flower seeds,\" said Mercy.    \"I suppose, when it comes warm, you can sit out in the arbor?\"    \"When the grape leaves get big enough to hide me--yes,\" said Mercy.  \"I don't go into the garden excepting in schooltime. Then the young  ones aren't always running by and tormenting me,\" snapped the cripple,  chopping off her speech at the end.    She was a self-tormentor. It was plain that the poor child made  herself very miserable by believing that everybody possessing a strong  back and lively legs felt his or her superiority to her and delighted  in \"showing off\" before her. The girl of the Red Mill felt only pity  for a sufferer possessing such an unfortunate disposition.    She tried to turn the conversation always into pleasant channels. She  held Mercy's interest in the Red Mill and her life there. She told her  of the broods of downy chicks that she cared for, and the  butter-making, and the household tasks she was able to help Aunt  Alviry about.    \"And don't you go to school?\" demanded Mercy.    \"I am going now. I hope this spring and summer to prepare myself for  entering the Cheslow High.\"    \"And then you'll be in town every day?\" said Mercy, with one of her  occasional wistful looks.    \"I hope to. I don't know how I will get here. But I mean to try. Miss  Cramp says if I'll come two or three times a week this summer, after  our school closes, that she will help me to prepare for the High School  exams., so I can enter at the beginning of the fall term.    \"I know Miss Cramp,\" said Mercy. \"She lives on this street. You'll be  so busy then that you'll never get in to see me at all, I suppose.\"    \"Why, I can come much oftener,\" cried Ruth. \"Of course I will.\"    If Mercy was pleased by this statement, she would not show it.    \"I studied to enter High,\" she said, after a little silence. \"But  what's the use? I'll never go to school again. Reading books isn't any  fun. Just studying, and studying, and studying doesn't get you  anywhere.\"    \"Why, I should think that would be nice,\" Ruth declared. \"You've got  so much chance to study. You see, you don't have to work around the  house, or outside, and so you have all your time to devote to study. I  should like that.\"    \"Yah!\" snarled Mercy, in her most unpleasant way. \"That's what you  say. I wish you were here to try it, and I could be out to the Red  Mill.\" Then she paid more softly: \"I'd like to see that mill and the  river--and all the things you tell about.\"    \"You wait!\" cried Ruth. \"I'll ask Uncle Jabez and Aunt Alviry. Maybe  we can fix it so you could come out and see me. Wouldn't that be  fine?\"    \"Yah!\" snarled the cripple again. \"I'll never get that far away from  this old chair.\"    \"Perhaps not; but you might bring the chair with you,\" returned Ruth,  unshaken. \"Wait till vacation. I'll not give up the idea until I've  seen if it can't be arranged.\"    That the thought pleased Mercy, the cripple could not deny. Her eyes  shone and a warmth of unusual color appeared in her thin cheeks. Her  mother came in with a tray of cakes and lemonade, and Mercy became  quite pleasant as she did the honors. Having already eaten her fill at  the doctor's, Ruth found it a little difficult to do justice to this  collation; but she would not hurt Mercy's feelings by refusing.    The hour passed in more pleasant converse. The cripple's mind was  evidently coaxed from its wrong and unhappy thoughts. When Ruth rose  to leave, promising to come again as soon as she could get into town,  Mercy was plainly softened.    \"You just hate to come--I know you do!\" she said, but she said it  wistfully. \"Everybody hates to come to see me. But I don't mind having  you come as much as I do them. Oh, yes; you can come again if you  will,\" and she gave Ruth her hand at parting.    Mrs. Curtis put her arms about the girl from the Red Mill and kissed  her warmly at the door.    \"Dear, dear!\" said the cripple's mother, \"how your own mother would  have loved you, if she had lived until now. You are like sunshine in  the house.\"    So, after waving her hand and smiling at the cripple in the window,  Ruth went slowly back to the corner to meet Helen, and found herself  wiping some tender tears from her eyes because of Mrs. Curtis's words.      CHAPTER XVIII     THE SPELLING BEE    In spite of the fact that the big girls at the district school, led by  Julia Semple, whose father was the chairman of the board of trustees,  had very little to say to Ruth Fielding, and shunned her almost  altogether outside of the schoolroom, Ruth was glad of her chance to  study and learn. She brought home no complaints to Aunt Alvirah  regarding the treatment she received from the girls of her own class,  and of course uncle Jabez never spoke to her about her schooling, nor  she to him.    At school Ruth pleased Miss Cramp very much. She had gradually worked  her way toward the top of the class--and this fact did not make her  any more friends.

So fast did he go that Ned, Tom and Mr. Damon, following, lost sight of  him several times, and Tom finally called:    \"Wait a minute.  We'll all be lost if you keep this up.\"    \"I'll have him in another minute,\" answered the professor.  \"I can  almost reach him now.  Then---- Oh!\"    His voice ended in a scream that seemed to be one of terror.  So sudden  was the change that Tom and Ned, who were together, ahead of Mr. Damon,  looked at one another in fear.    \"What has happened?\" whispered Ned, pausing.    \"Don't stop to ask--come on!\" shouted Tom.    At that instant again came the voice of the savant.    \"Tom! Ned!\" he gasped, rather than cried.    \"I'm caught in the coils! Quick--quick if you would save me!\"    \"In the coils!\" repeated Ned.  \"What does he mean?  Can the giant  iguana----\"    Tom Swift did not stop to answer.  With his electric rifle in  readiness, he leaped forward through the jungle.          CHAPTER XVI    A MEETING IN THE JUNGLE      Before Tom and Ned reached the place whence Professor Bumper had  called, they heard strange noises, other than the imploring voice of  their friend.  It seemed as though some great body was threshing about  in the jungle, lashing the trees, bushes and leaves about, and when the  two young men, followed by Mr. Damon, reached the scene they saw that,  in a measure, this really accounted for what they heard.    Something like a great whip was beating about close to two trees that  grew near together.  And then, when the storm of twigs, leaves and  dirt, caused by the leaping, threshing thing ceased for a moment, the  onlookers saw something that filled them with terror.    Between the two trees, and seemingly bound to them by a great coiled  rope, spotted and banded, was the body of Professor Bumper.  His arms  were pinioned to his sides and there was horror and terror on his face,  that looked imploringly at the youths from above the topmost coil of  those encircling him.    \"What is it?\" cried Mr. Damon, as he ran pantingly up.  \"What has  caught him?  Is it the giant iguana?\"    \"It's a snake--a great boa!\" gasped Tom.  \"It has him in its coils.  But it is wound around the trees, too.  That alone prevents it from  crushing the professor to death.    \"Ned, be ready with your rifle.  Put in the heaviest charge, and watch  your chance to fire!\"    The great, ugly head of the boa reared itself up from the coils which  it had, with the quickness of thought, thrown about the man between the  two trees.  This species of snake is not poisonous, and kills its prey  by crushing it to death, making it into a pulpy mass, with scarcely a  bone left unbroken, after which it swallows its meal.  The crushing  power of one of these boas, some of which reach a length of thirty  feet, with a body as large around as that of a full-grown man, is  enormous.    \"I'm going to fire!\" suddenly cried Tom.  He had seen his chance and he  took it.  There was the faint report--the crack of the electric  rifle--and the folds of the serpent seemed to relax.    \"I see a good chance now,\" added Ned, who had taken the small charge  from his weapon, replacing it with a heavier one.    His rifle was also discharged in the direction of the snake, and Tom  saw that the hit was a good one, right through the ugly head of the  reptile.    \"One other will be enough to make him loosen his coils!\" cried Tom, as  he fired again, and such was the killing power of the electric bullets  that the snake, though an immense one, and one that short of  decapitation could have received many injuries without losing power,  seemed to shrivel up.    Its folds relaxed, and the coils of the great body fell in a heap at  the roots of the two trees, between which the scientist had been  standing.    Professor Bumper seemed to fall backward as the grip of the serpent  relaxed, but Tom, dropping his rifle, and calling to Ned to keep an eye  on the snake, leaped forward and caught his friend.    \"Are you hurt?\" asked Tom, carrying the limp form over to a grassy  place.  There was no answer, the savant's eyes were closed and he  breathed but faintly.    Ned Newton fired two more electric bullets into the still writhing body  of the boa.    \"I guess he's all in,\" he called to Tom.    \"Bless my horseradish! And so our friend seems to be,\" commented Mr.  Damon.  \"Have you anything with which to revive him, Tom?\"    \"Yes.  Some ammonia.  See if you can find a little water.\"    \"I have some in my flask.\"    Tom mixed a dose of the spirits which he carried with him, and this,  forced between the pallid lips of the scientist, revived him.    \"What happened?\" he asked faintly as he opened his eyes.  \"Oh, yes, I  remember,\" he added slowly.  \"The boa----\"    \"Don't try to talk,\" urged Tom.  \"You're all right.  The snake is dead,  or dying.  Are you much hurt?\"    Professor Bumper appeared to be considering.  He moved first one limb,  then another.  He seemed to have the power over all his muscles.    \"I see how it happened,\" he said, as he sat up, after taking a little  more of the ammonia.  \"I was following the iguana, and when the big  lizard came to a stop, in a little hollow place in the ground, at the  foot of those two trees, I leaned over to slip a noose of rope about  its neck.  Then I felt myself caught, as if in the hands of a giant,  and bound fast between the two trees.\"    \"It was the big boa that whipped itself around you, as you leaned  over,\" explained Tom, as Ned came up to announce that the snake was no  longer dangerous.  \"But when it coiled around you it also coiled around  the two trees, you, fortunately slipping between them.  Had it not been  that their trunks took off some of the pressure of the coils you  wouldn't have lasted a minute.\"    \"Well, I was pretty badly squeezed as it was,\" remarked the professor.  \"I hardly had breath enough left to call to you.  I tried to fight off  the serpent, but it was of no use.\"    \"I should say not!\" cried Mr. Damon.  \"Bless my circus ring! one might  as well try to combat an elephant! But, my dear professor, are you all  right now?\"    \"I think so--yes.  Though I shall be lame and stiff for a few days, I  fear.  I can hardly walk.\"    Professor Bumper was indeed unable to go about much for a few days  after his encounter with the great serpent.  He stretched out in a  hammock under trees in the camp clearing, and with his friends waited  for the possible return of Tolpec and the porters.    Ned and Tom made one or two short hunting trips, and on these occasions  they kept a lookout in the direction the Indian had taken when he went  away.    \"For he's sure to come back that way--if he comes at all,\" declared  Ned; \"which I am beginning to doubt.\"    \"Well, he may not come,\" agreed Tom, who was beginning to lose some of  his first hope.  \"But he won't necessarily come from the same direction  he took.  He may have had to go in an entirely different way to get  help.  We'll hope for the best.\"    A week passed.  Professor Bumper was able to be about, and Tom and Ned  noticed that there was an anxious look on his face.  Was he, too,  beginning to despair?    \"Well, this isn't hunting for golden idols very fast,\" said Mr. Damon,  the morning of the eighth day after their desertion by the faithless  Jacinto.  \"What do you say, Professor Bumper; ought we not to start off  on our own account?\"    \"We had better if Tolpec does not return today,\" was the answer.    They had eaten breakfast, had put their camp in order, and were about  to have a consultation on what was best to do, when Tom suddenly called  to Ned, who was whistling:    \"Hark!\"    Through the jungle came a faint sound of singing--not a harmonious air,  but the somewhat barbaric chant of the natives.    \"It is Tolpec coming back!\" cried Mr. Damon.  \"Hurray! Now our troubles  are over! Bless my meal ticket! Now we can start!\"    \"It may be Jacinto,\" suggested Ned.    \"Nonsense! you old cold-water pitcher!\" cried Tom.  \"It's Tolpec! I can  see him! He's a good scout all right!\"    And then, walking at the head of a band of Indians who were weirdly  chanting while behind them came a train of mules, was Tolpec, a  cheerful grin covering his honest, if homely, dark face.    \"Me come back!\" he exclaimed in gutteral English, using about half of  his foreign vocabulary.    \"I see you did,\" answered Professor Bumper in the man's own tongue.  \"Glad to see you.  Is everything all right?\"    \"All right,\" was the answer.  \"These Indians will take you where you  want to go, and will not leave you as Jacinto did.\"    \"We'll start in the morning!\" exclaimed the savant his own cheerful  self again, now that there was a prospect of going further into the  interior.  \"Tell the men to get something to eat, Tolpec.  There is  plenty for all.\"    \"Good!\" grunted the new guide and soon the hungry Indians, who had come  far, were satisfying their hunger.    As they ate Tolpec explained to Professor Bumper, who repeated it to  the youths and Mr. Damon, that it had been necessary to go farther than  he had intended to get the porters and mules.  But the Indians were a  friendly tribe, of which he was a member, and could be depended on.    There was a feast and a sort of celebration in camp that night.  Tom  and Ned shot two deer, and these formed the main part of the feast and  the Indians made merry about the fire until nearly midnight.  They did  not seem to mind in the least the swarms of mosquitoes and other bugs  that flew about, attracted by the light.  As for Tom Swift and his  friends, their nets protected them.    An early start was made the following morning.  Such packages of goods  and supplies as could not well be carried by the Indians in their head  straps, were loaded on the backs of the pack-mules.  Tolpec explained  that on reaching the Indian village, where he had secured the porters,  they"]]]
