A few of the seniors already had enough credits to  insure graduation, although the majority expected the results of the  January examinations to place them securely among the number to be  graduated.    The members of the Phi Sigma Tau, with the exception of Anne, were among  the latter, and had settled down to a three weeks' grind, from which no  form of pleasure could beguile them.    As for Anne, she had carried five studies the entire time she had been  in High School and had never failed in even one examination. She might  have graduated a year earlier had she been so disposed.    Away down in her heart Anne cherished a faint hope that the way for a  college career would yet be opened to her. She had made up her mind to  try for a scholarship, and she prayed earnestly that before the close of  her senior year she might hit upon some plan that would furnish the  money for her support during her freshman year in college.    Grace was optimistic in regard to Anne's college career.    \"You'll have some opportunity to earn money before the year is out, just  see if you don't,\" she said to Anne one day at recess, when the latter  had developed an unusual case of the blues. \"If you just keep wishing  hard enough for a thing you are pretty sure to get it. That is, if it's  something that's good for you to have.\"    \"I've been wishing for the same thing ever since I came to Oakdale, and  I haven't got it yet,\" replied Anne rather mournfully. \"I've been  unusually short of money this year, too, because Mrs. Gray has been  away, and the money I received from her work was a great help.\"    \"Poor little Anne,\" said Grace sympathetically. \"I wish you didn't have  to worry over money. However, Mrs. Gray will be home in February, and  you'll have her work until June.\"    \"But even so, I can't have the use of it myself,\" was Anne's response.  \"I shall have to use it at home. We need every cent of it.\"    \"Oh, dear,\" sighed Grace. \"Why doesn't some one appear all of a sudden  and offer you a fine position at about fifty dollars a week.\"    \"Yes,\" said Anne, laughing in spite of her blues. \"That is what really  ought to happen, only the day for miracles is past.\"    \"At any rate, I have always felt that you and I were going to college  together, and I believe we shall,\" predicted Grace.    \"I hope so, but I doubt it,\" replied Anne wistfully. \"By the way, Grace,  do you recite in any of Marian Barber's classes?\"    \"No,\" said Grace, \"not this term. Why?\"    \"She is in my section in astronomy,\" answered Anne, \"and lately she  fails every day in recitation. You know it's a one-term study, and she  will have to try an exam in it before long. I don't believe she'll pass,  and she told Nora at the beginning of the year that if she failed in one  study this year she wouldn't have enough credits to get through and  graduate.\"    \"Oh, she'll pull through, I think,\" said Grace. \"She is really brilliant  in mathematics, and always has kept up in other things.\"    \"I know,\" persisted Anne, \"but she has finished her mathematics' group,  and her studies this year are things she doesn't care for, and  consequently left them until the last. We wouldn't want a Phi Sigma Tau  to fail, you know.\"    \"I should say not,\" was Grace's emphatic response. \"What shall we do  about it?\"    Anne pondered for a little. \"We might take turns coaching her. We have  all passed in astronomy. I don't know how she is in her other studies,\"  she said. \"Do you suppose she'd be angry if we proposed it to her?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Grace doubtfully. \"She hasn't been to the last two  Phi Sigma Tau meetings, and she is awfully cool to me. That's because I  don't approve of Henry Hammond. To tell you the truth, I believe he  absorbs her attention so completely that she doesn't have time for her  studies.\"    \"It's a pity her mother is away just at the time when Marian needs her  most,\" Anne remarked.    \"Yes,\" said Grace. \"You know I asked her to come and stay with me, when  we came back from the judge's, but she refused rather sharply, and  practically told me that she was able to take care of herself.\"    Just then the gong sounded, and the girls had no further opportunity to  discuss the subject until school closed for the day, then while waiting  in the locker-room for Nora and Jessica, the talk was again renewed, and  after swearing Anne to secrecy, Grace imparted to her the conversation  between Marian and Henry Hammond that she and Tom had overheard on New  Year's Night.    \"I was so uneasy about it that I went all around town the next day to  see what I could find out about him. I didn't get much satisfaction,  however. He claims to be a real estate agent, and Mr. Furlow in the  First National Bank says that he has interested a number of Oakdale  citizens in land in the west. He is well liked, and it's surprising the  way the business men have taken him up,\" concluded Grace.    \"Perhaps what you heard him say to Marian was nothing of importance  after all,\" said Anne.    But Grace shook her head obstinately. \"No, Anne,\" she answered, \"my  intuitions never fail me. Henry Hammond is a rascal, and some day I  shall prove it. As for Marian we'd better have a meeting of the Phi  Sigma Tau to-morrow night and especially request her to be present. Then  we'll all turn in and offer to help her get ready for the exams. Here  come the girls now.\"    Nora, Jessica, Miriam and Eva Allen entered the senior locker-room  together.    \"Where's Marian?\" asked Grace.    \"You'd never guess if we told you,\" exclaimed Nora. \"I never was more  surprised in my life.\"    \"Why? What's the matter?\" asked Anne and Grace together.    \"Who is the last person you'd expect to see her with?\" asked Jessica.    \"I don't know,\" said Grace. \"Edna Wright?\"    \"Worse,\" was Nora's answer. \"She's up in the study hall with Eleanor  Savelli.\"    \"Eleanor Savelli?\" echoed Grace. \"Why she is Marian's pet aversion.\"    \"Past history,\" said Miriam Nesbit. \"They appear to be thicker than  thieves.\"    \"I don't at all understand what ails her, but listen, girls, while I  tell you my idea,\" and Grace rapidly narrated her plan of action.    \"I foresee trouble, but I'll be on hand,\" said Miriam.    \"We'll all be there!\" was the chorus.    \"Remember, Eva,\" were Grace's parting words, \"I rely on you to coax  Marian over to your house, then we'll surround her and make her accept  our services.\"    \"All right,\" responded Eva. \"I'll do my best. Be careful what you say  about Henry Hammond, or your mission may be in vain.\"          CHAPTER XV    THE PHI SIGMA TAUS MEET WITH A LOSS      After considerable coaxing, Eva finally wrung from Marian a promise to  visit her that evening. She arrived about eight o'clock, and Eva  tactfully producing a box of nut chocolates, a confection of which  Marian was very fond, the two girls seated themselves in the Allen's  cozy sitting room, with the box on a taboret between them.    Marian became more like her old self again, and the two girls were  laughing merrily over the antics of Eva's Angora kitten when the  doorbell rang, and Eva, looking rather conscious, went to the door.    At the sound of girlish voices, Marian rose, a look of intense annoyance  on her face, which deepened as the Phi Sigma Tau trooped into the room,  and laughingly surrounded her.    \"How are you, Marian?\" they cried. \"You wouldn't come to us, so we  planned a little surprise.\"    \"So I see,\" replied Marian stiffly. \"I am sorry, but I really must go,  Eva. You should have told me that the girls were coming.\"    \"Why, Marian Barber, what are you talking about?\" asked Nora O'Malley in  pretended surprise. \"Why should you run away from the members of your  own sorority?\"    Marian did not answer, but half tried to free herself from the detaining  hands of her friends. For a moment her expression softened, then she  tossed her head and said, \"Let me go, please.\"    \"Marian,\" said Grace bluntly, \"you have been acting very strangely  toward us since we came back from the house party, and we don't  understand it. You have stayed away from two sorority meetings and have  deliberately avoided all of us, with the exception of Eva. We feel badly  over it, because we have always liked you, and because you are a Phi  Sigma Tau.\"    \"Yes, Marian,\" interrupted Jessica, \"have you forgotten the solemn  initiation rites that were conducted at my house last year?\"    \"No,\" Marian admitted, smiling a little.    \"Then listen, while Anne, who speaks more impressive English than the  rest of us, tells you why we have thus entrapped you and used Eva for a  bait. Speechify, Anne, and we will put in the applause at the proper  intervals.\"    \"Marian,\" began Anne, \"Grace has already told you how kindly our feeling  is for you, and the reason that we tried to see you to-night is because  of something that I spoke of to Grace yesterday. I had noticed that you  were having trouble in your astronomy recitations, and, of course, we  all know that you must pass in all your subjects, both now and in June,  in order to graduate; so I suggested that as the other girls have all  passed in astronomy, we might take turns in coaching you. An hour or so  of review every night from now until the exams, would put you in good  condition.\"    \"Yes, Marian,\" interrupted Nora. \"Anne and Jessica did that for me last  year in ancient history, and I never should have passed if they hadn't  helped me.\"    Marian stood silently looking from one girl to the other, then she said  with a mixture of hurt pride, anger and obstinacy in her voice:    \"I don't need your help. In fact, I think the less we see of each other  in future the better it will be for us all. The past three months have  caused me to have an entirely different opinion than I used to have of  you girls. You are all very nice as long as things go your way, but if  one happens to make a friend or hold an opinion contrary to your views,  then the Phi Sigma Taus feel bound to step"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49507"],[0,"Siegfried & The Twilight of the Gods (#15)"],[1,"he sent      Us to battle;      Anxious and bewildered  We rode to the field.  Shunned are Walhall's bold heroes      By Warfather;      Riding alone,      Without pause or rest  He wandered and roamed through the world.  At last he returned      With his spear splintered;      In his hand the pieces;  A hero had cleft it asunder.      With silent sign      Walhall's heroes      Then he sent forth  To hew down the world-ash-tree.      He bade them pile      The logs as they hewed them,      Until they were heaped  High round the hall of the blest.      The Gods he next      Called to a council;      The high seat      He solemnly took,      Bidding them  Who gathered in fear sit beside him.      The heroes filled  The hall, ranged round in their order.      So sits he,      Speaks no word,      Upon his high seat      Grave and mute,      The splintered spear      Held fast in his hand,      Holda's apples      Touching no more.      Fear and amazement  Hold the Gods fast fettered.      He has sent his ravens      Forth to seek tidings;      If they return  And bring him comforting news,      Then the God will      With soul serene  Smile evermore and be glad.      Round his knees in sorrow      Twined lie the Valkyries;      He heeds not      Our glances beseeching;      By terror and wild anguish  We all are consumed.      Against his breast      Weeping I nestled,      Then soft grew his gaze:  He remembered, Brünnhilde, thee.  He closed his eyes      As if dreaming,      Heavily sighed      And whispered these words:  \"If to the deep Rhine's daughters  She would restore the ring that was theirs.      From the grievous curse  Both God and world were freed!\"      Then I took thought,      And from his side      Through the silent ranks      Stole noiselessly forth.      In haste, unseen,      I mounted my horse,  And stormed in tumult to thee.      Grant, O sister,      The boon I beg;      What thou canst do,      Undaunted perform!  End thou the grief of the Gods!

Within thine eyes,      So over-weary,  Gleams wavering fire;      With thy wan visage,      O pale-faced sister,  What wouldst thou, wild one, of me?    WALTRAUTE [_Vehemently._    The ring upon thy hand--  'Tis that: ah, be implored!  For Wotan fling it away!    BRÜNNHILDE    The ring--away?    WALTRAUTE    To the Rhine-daughters give it again.    BRÜNNHILDE    The Rhine-daughters--I--the ring?  Siegfried's love-pledge?      Hast thou gone crazy?    WALTRAUTE    Hear me! Hear my despair!      On this hangs  The world's undoing and woe.      Throw it from thee      Into the water;  End the anguish of Walhall;  The accurst thing cast in the waves!    BRÜNNHILDE    Ha! dost thou know what 'twould mean      How shouldst thou,      Maid unloving and cold!  Much is Walhall's rapture,  Much is the fame of the Gods;      More is my ring.  One glance at its shining gold,  One flash of its sacred fire      Is more precious      Than bliss of all the Gods  Enduring for aye!      For Siegfried's dear love  Shines from it bright and blessèd.      Love of Siegfried!  Ah, could I but utter the rapture  Bound up in the ring!        Go back to the holy      Council of Gods;      Repeat what I have told thee      Of my ring:  That love I will not forswear,  Of love they never shall rob me;      Sooner shall Walhall's glory  Perish and pass!

[_The firelight approaches from below.          Ever-brightening tongues of flame shoot up over the          edge of the rock._        Why leap so wildly  The billows that blaze round the rock?

Flames leap up, out of which Siegfried springs          forward on to a high rock, whereupon the flames          immediately withdraw and again only shine up          from below. Brünnhilde recoils in terror, flies          to the foreground, and from there, in speechless          astonishment, stares at Siegfried, who, wearing the          Tarnhelm, which covers the upper half of his face,          leaving only his eyes free, appears in Gunther's          form._    BRÜNNHILDE    Betrayed!

Siegfried catches her hand and          draws the ring from her finger. She gives a loud          scream. As she sinks helpless into his arms her          unconscious look meets Siegfried's eyes. Siegfried          lays her fainting on the stone bench at the          entrance to the cave._    SIEGFRIED        Now thou art mine!  Brünnhilde, Gunther's bride,  Lead me the way to thy cave!
