Then, continuing the rapid vibration, they move slowly  along, always holding on firmly by one or more legs, as if to still  further satisfy themselves concerning the efficiency of their wings.  Then they venture on a few short trial trips from one neighbouring  object to another, and at last gain sufficient confidence for a long  voyage.    How strange must be the feelings of a winged insect during its first  flight! After a long period during which it was a helpless, crawling  grub, and this followed by a term of imprisonment during which it was  almost or quite shut off from the world, it now suddenly acquires such  great powers of locomotion that it is often a match for ourselves.    But, alas! this life is short. A few days spent in sporting with those  it meets and in sucking the sweet juices of many flowers; then a day or  two during which the female deposits its eggs; again a few days employed  in pleasures that become less and less attractive, till, at last, the  creature becomes weary of life and settles down to die.    We have now traced the complete life history of the _Lepidoptera_ from  the egg to the perfect insect, avoiding descriptions that apply only to  certain species as far as possible, excepting where such are useful as  illustrations.    Only one thing more remains to be done before we start in real earnest  with our practical work. We shall shortly be giving hints on the modes  of capture, the 'setting' and the preservation of butterflies and moths.  And in so doing we shall often have to observe important points in which  our dealings with these two great divisions of the order will differ  very materially. Hence we must not consider ourselves ready to proceed  with the practical portion of the entomologist's labours till we are  perfectly satisfied that we know the main features that enable us to  distinguish between the butterflies and the moths, and also know just a  little concerning the subdivisions on each side.    This, then, shall form the subject of the next short chapter.          CHAPTER V    _CLASSIFICATION OF THE LEPIDOPTERA_      The _Lepidoptera_ are divided into two very unequal groups, to which we  have so frequently alluded as 'Butterflies' and 'Moths.' And, although  these two terms are popularly applied in a fairly accurate manner, yet,  strange to say, very few persons indeed have any definite knowledge of  the differences that entomologists recognise between the two groups.    Every entomologist has his circle of sympathetic and, perhaps, even  admiring friends. Consequently, many a little package is sent round to  his abode 'with great care,' accompanied by a note or a message  concerning the fine 'butterfly I have just caught, and thought you would  like to add to your collection.'    The 'butterflies' that so frequently reach us through these channels  nearly always turn out to be _brightly coloured_ moths, and this  naturally gives one the idea that the popular notion as to the  classification of the _Lepidoptera_ is based on colour or brilliancy of  design, the term 'butterfly' being applied to the gayer species, and  'moth' to the more dingy members of the race.    There is really some shadow of a reason in this method of nomenclature,  for butterflies _are usually_ more brightly clad than moths; but the  scientific classification, at least as far as the main divisions and  subdivisions are concerned, has nothing whatever to do with colour or  design; and we must at once acquaint ourselves with the fact that there  _are_ very dingy butterflies, and most beautiful and highly coloured  moths.    How shall we account for the fact that the specimens so kindly sent us  by our friends are generally moths? Is it because moths are more  numerous and more frequently seen? They are certainly more numerous;  for, while our butterflies do not number seventy species, the other  division contains about two thousand. Yet, in spite of this fact, moths  are not generally observed as much as butterflies, for the former are  nearly all night-fliers, and the latter _always_ fly by day and rest by  night.    Still our question remains unanswered. The reason is this. The captives  sent us are seldom caught on the wing. Most of our grown-up friends,  even though they admire our own pluck and general carelessness  concerning the remarks of the spectators of our entomological antics,  would not themselves like to be seen, hat in hand, chasing a butterfly;  and the night-flying moths are, of course, less frequently observed. But  they often, in the course of their daily employments, meet with a large  moth fast asleep in some corner of a dwelling house, workshop, or  outhouse. Such moths are easily caught while in the midst of their  slumbers, and, as they often make no attempt to fly by day, are as  easily transferred to a box suitable for transmission by messenger or by  post.    In the above few remarks we have alluded to some features by which the  two great groups of the _Lepidoptera_ may be distinguished; but we have  already referred (page 5) to a far more important one in our description  of the various forms of antennae. All butterflies--at least all _British_  butterflies--have knobbed or clubbed antennae, while the corresponding  organs of all our moths terminate in a sharp point.    This distinction obtains in all British _Lepidoptera_, and is so far  regarded as the most important basis of classification that naturalists  have derived from it the two Greek terms that are synonymous with our  two popular names--butterflies and moths. The scientific name for the  former group is _Rhopalocera_--a term derived from two Greek words, one  signifying a horn, and the other a club, and thus meaning 'club-horned.'  The corresponding name for moths is _Heterocera_, derived from the same  source, and meaning 'variously horned.'    But, although we find embodied in these two long and formidable names an  unerring mark of distinction between British butterflies and moths, we  must not neglect other less important facts which, though less  distinctive, are not without interest.    Observe a butterfly at rest. Its wings are turned vertically over its  back, and brought so closely together that they often touch. In this  position the 'upper' surfaces of the 'upper' wings are completely hidden  from view, and the 'under' surfaces are exposed on the two sides,  except that those of the 'upper' pair are partly hidden by the other  pair.    Now look at a moth under the same circumstances, and you will generally  find the wings lying over its body, which is almost or completely hidden  beneath them. As a rule the upper pair together form a triangular  figure, and entirely cover the second pair; but in some cases a portion  of each of the under wings extends beyond the margin of those above  them, and in others the upper pair extend so far forward that nearly the  whole of the under wings is exposed behind them.    [Illustration: FIG. 37.--A BUTTERFLY AT REST (LARGE COPPER).]    [Illustration: FIG. 38.--A MOTH AT REST (GOTHIC).]    Again, the wings of butterflies are so rigid that they can never be  folded; but you will observe that the under wings of moths are generally  very thin, soft, and pliant, and are neatly pleated lengthwise when not  in use.    Another feature deserving notice is a slight difference to be often  observed in the form of the body. The butterfly, which generally has a  slender body, has a distinct constriction or waist between the thorax  and abdomen. This is not so apparent with moths, and especially with the  thick-bodied species.    The _Rhopalocera_ or Butterflies are divided into _Families_, each of  which contains insects that possess certain features in common by which  they may all be distinguished from the members of any other family.    The British species represent eight families. They are as follows:    1. _Papilionidae._--Containing only one British species--the beautiful  Swallow-tail (Plate I, fig. 1).    2. _Pieridae._--Containing ten species. These are often known  collectively as the 'Whites,' but include four butterflies that are  distinguished by beautiful shades of yellow and orange.    3. _Nymphalidae._--This family contains seventeen insects, among them  being several splendid species. It includes the Fritillaries and  Vanessas.    4. _Apaturidae._--Of this we have only one representative--the Purple  Emperor (Plate V, fig. 1).    5. _Satyridae._--Including the 'Browns' and 'Heaths,' and numbering  eleven species.    6. _Lycaenidae._--Including the Hairstreaks, 'Coppers,' and 'Blues,' in  all seventeen species.    7. _Erycinidae._--Containing only the 'Duke of Burgundy.'    8. _Hesperiidae._--This family contains seven British butterflies  commonly known as the 'Skippers.'    Although all the members of the same family resemble each other in  certain points of structure, or in their habits, yet we can often find  among them a smaller group differing from all the others in one or two  minor particulars. Such smaller groups are called _Genera_.    To make this all quite clear we will take an example.    The Brimstone Butterfly (Plate II, fig. 4) belongs to the second  family--_Pieridae_, _all_ the members of which are distinguished from  those of the other families by the characteristics mentioned on page  141.    But our Brimstone Butterfly possesses another very prominent feature in  which it differs from all the other British _Pieridae_, and that is the  conspicuous projecting angles of both fore and hind wings. Among the  foreign species of the family we are considering there are several that  possess these angles; but as there are no others among our own members,  the 'Brimstone' is placed by itself in the list of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34175"],[0,"Domestic Animals (#15)"],[1," a milk-giving animal, the cow is the best fitted for the  purposes of civilized man; and she is made to contribute, not only to  his health, his comfort, and his economy, but to many of his choicest  luxuries. Milk contains every element of nutrition necessary to animal  existence; and man can subsist, with unimpaired health and strength, if  limited to this food alone.      The Constituents of Milk    Are butter, which varies from 2 to 6 per cent.; casein or cheese,  usually 4 to 5, but sometimes varying from 3 to 15 per cent.; (the last  excessive quantity, yielded only by the first milk after calving;)  milk-sugar, 4 to 6; salts or saline matter, 0.2 to 0.6; and water, 80 to  89.    _There is much diversity in the product and quality of milk_ from cows  of the same breed, the same food, and other circumstances and  conditions, apparently equal. Thus, of a herd of 22, chiefly Ayrshire,  one gave 84 quarts in one week, which afforded 31/2 lbs. of butter; two  others in the same time gave 86, yielding 51/2 lbs.; and a fourth gave 88  quarts, making 7 lbs.    The amount of butter, however, which a given quantity of milk will  produce, is not the only criterion of the value of the milk, except for  this purpose alone. Some cows will yield more butter, others will  produce more cheese; while for consumption, another may partially  compensate, in the increased quantity of milk-sugar, and the saline  matters, for a deficiency of both the other ingredients. But for dairy  purposes, butter and cheese are the only measure of the value of milk;  and a cow is esteemed good or indifferent, as she gives one or the other  in the greatest abundance.      Circumstances which modify the Quantity and Character of Milk.    Besides the accidental variation in the quantity and quality of milk in  different animals, before adverted to, there are many reliable causes  which influence both. Of these, parentage has a most decided and uniform  influence, frequently modified, however, in the particular individual,  by some personal and controlling causes. But a cow, whose maternal  ancestry on both sides are choice milkers, is almost certain to resemble  them.    Food influences the quantity, rather than the quality. Boussingault  tried numerous experiments, with cows fed on various kinds of food, and  found the difference hardly appreciable in the quality of milk. Its true  benefit is to be looked for in the increased quantity, through which,  the valuable ingredients are distributed in nearly the same proportion,  as when the product is materially lessened. By quality we mean to be  understood, the amount of the ingredients, _valuable for nutrition  only_; for it is certain, that there is a rich aromatic flavor, not only  in milk, but in butter and cheese, which is afforded in various articles  of food, and especially by the fresh green herbage which abounds in the  pastures from spring to autumn.    Activity or rest has a great effect on both quantity and quality. The  less action, and the more quiet and rest, the greater the amount of milk  and butter. But exercise is absolutely essential to the production of  cheese. Butter may be made from cows confined in a stable, but cheese  can only be profitably made from animals at pasture. It is supposed by  physiologists, that the exercise in gathering their food, rather than  any peculiarity in its character, is necessary to convert the  nitrogenized tissues into the nitrogenized principle of caseum or  cheese.    The time from calving, has also its effect. The first milk drawn from a  cow after calving, has been found to yield over 15 per cent. of casein,  while in its ordinary state it gives only three to five and a half. As  the quantity of milk diminishes in a farrow cow, the quality improves  within certain limits. Pregnancy affects the quality injuriously, and  especially towards its latter stages; and a cow that is predisposed to  giving milk, should be dried off a few weeks before its expiration, as  it is then unfit for use.    Fat cows give poorer milk than such as are moderately lean; and young  animals do not come up to the maximum of their quality, till after their  third or fourth calving.    The milk first drawn from the udder, will yield only an eighth, and  sometimes even a much less proportion of cream, than the strippings; and  the milk which is drawn three times a day, is greatly inferior to such  as is taken but once, though the latter is less abundant.    Excitement, or fretfulness; change of locality, or to a different herd,  with new companions; separation from her calf; periodical heat;  annoyance from flies, or worry from dogs; exposure to storms, severe  cold, or an oppressive sun, and many similar causes, diminish the  quantity of milk and butter; but some of these may reasonably be  expected to increase the proportion of its casein.    Dr. Playfair found that the quantity of butter in the evening milk,  after the cow had been at pasture all day, was 3.7 per cent., while the  casein was 5.4; after lying quietly all night, the milk from the same  cow, on the following morning, contained 5.6 per cent. of butter, and  only 3.9 of casein. In stabling the cow, the butter was invariably in  greater proportion than when allowed to ramble in the pasture; and the  casein, with a single exception, was equally diminished.    [Illustration: Fig. 17.    Lactometer, or Cream Guage.]    Fig. 17, is a number of glass tubes of equal size, set in a frame called  a _lactometer_ or _cream guage_. If milk from different cows be set in  these, the depth of the cream will indicate their comparative richness.      Cream.    If milk be immediately set away in shallow vessels, after being taken  from the cow, the cream rises to the surface, carrying with it most of  the butter contained in the milk, and much of its casein also. Hence,  the great nutritive properties of buttermilk, which retains the casein  in very large proportions, much of it being rejected by the butter in  its separation from the cream.    A temperature below 34 deg., will prevent the cream from rising in any  considerable quantity, and preserve the milk unaltered for some weeks.  Coagulating the milk from any cause, will equally prevent the separation  of the cream. The elevation of temperature within certain limits,  hastens the separation. Thus, at 50 deg., the cream will mostly have risen  in 36 hours; at 55 deg., in 24; at 68 deg., in 18 or 20; and at 77 deg., in 10 or 12  hours.    Heating the milk near the boiling point, and then setting it away and  allowing it to remain undisturbed, will soon cause the cream to rise. In  the celebrated Orange dairy, near Baltimore, Md., this system was  practised, by which, not only most of the cream was secured for butter,  but in consequence of its rapid separation, the skimmed milk was sent to  market within a few hours after being drawn; and the scalding imparted  to it an agreeable flavor and apparent richness, which it did not really  possess.    The celebrated clouted cream of Devonshire, England, and the butter made  from it, contains an unusual quantity of casein, the consequence of  heating the milk. \"It is prepared by straining the warm milk into large  shallow pans into which a little water has previously been put, allowing  these to stand from six to twelve hours, and then carefully heating them  over a slow fire, or on a hot plate, till the milk approaches the  boiling point. The milk, however, must not actually boil, nor must the  skin of the cream be broken. The dishes are now removed into the dairy,  and allowed to cool. In summer the cream should be churned on the  following day; in winter it may stand over two days. The quantity of  cream obtained is said to be one-fourth greater by this method, and the  milk which is left is proportionably poor.\"--[_Johnston._]      BUTTER.      Electricity    Has much to do with the changes in milk, as in all other substances.  Glass milk-pans might, therefore, be supposed to be the best vessels for  keeping the milk unchanged and sweet.    It may possibly not afford any practical result, yet intelligent  experiments for introducing a stream of electricity might well be  justified, to aid in the separation of the butteraceous particles in the  operation of churning.      Sour Cream.    Cream, for the purpose of churning, is usually allowed to become sour.  It ought to be at least one day old, but may with advantage be kept  several days in cool weather, if it be previously well freed from milk,  and be frequently stirred to keep it from curdling. This sour cream is  put into the churn, and worked in the usual way until the butter  separates. This is collected into lumps, well beat and squeezed free  from the milk, and in some dairies is washed with pure cold water as  long as the water is rendered milky. In other localities the butter is  not washed, but after being well beat, is carefully freed from the  remaining milk by repeated squeezings and dryings with a clean cloth.  Both methods, no doubt, have their advantages. In the same  circumstances, the washed butter may be more easily preserved in the  fresh state, while the unwashed butter will probably possess a higher  flavor.      Sweet Cream    May be put into the churn and the butter be obtained, but in most cases  it requires more labor and longer time, without, in the opinion of good  judges, affording in general a finer quality of butter. In all cases the  cream becomes sour during the agitation, and before the butter begins  distinctly to form.      Clouted Cream    The churning of the clouted cream of this and other countries, forms an  exception to the general rule just stated, that more time is required in  the churning of sweet creams. Clouted cream may be churned in the  morning after it is made, that is, within twenty-four hours of the time  when the milk was taken from the cow; and from such cream it is well  known that the butter separates with very "]]]
