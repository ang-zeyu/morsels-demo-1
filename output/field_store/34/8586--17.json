[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35514"],[0,"The Great Apostasy, Considered in the Light of Scriptural and Secular History (#15)"],[1,"prevailing during this period of Diocletian outrage is as follows:  \"The magistrates were commanded to employ every method of severity  which might reclaim them from their odious superstition, and oblige  them to return to the established worship of the gods. This rigorous  order was extended, by a subsequent edict, to the whole body of  Christians, who were exposed to a violent and general persecution.  Instead of those salutary restraints which had required the direct and  solemn testimony of an accuser, it became the duty as well as the  interest of the imperial officers to discover, to pursue, and to  torment the most obnoxious among the faithful. Heavy penalties were  denounced against all who should presume to save a proscribed sectary  from the just indignation of the gods and of the emperors.\"--(Gibbon,  \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\" ch. XVI.)    20. So general was the Diocletian persecution, and so destructive its  effect, that at its cessation the Christian Church was thought to be  forever extinct. Monuments were raised to commemorate the emperor's  zeal as a persecutor, notably two pillars erected in Spain. On one of  them is an inscription extolling the mighty Diocletian \"_For having  extinguished the name of Christians who brought the Republic to  ruin_.\" A second pillar commemorates the reign of Diocletian, and  honors the imperator \"_for having everywhere abolished the  superstition of Christ; for having extended the worship of the gods_.\"  A medal struck in honor of Diocletian bears the inscription \"_The name  of Christian being extinguished_.\"--(Milner, \"Church History,\" Cent.  IV, ch. 1:38.) To the fallacy of these assumptions subsequent events  testify.    21. The Diocletian oppression was the last of the great persecutions  brought by pagan Rome against Christianity as a whole. A stupendous  change, amounting to a revolution, now appears in the affairs of the  Church. Constantine, known in history as Constantine the Great, became  emperor of Rome A. D. 306, and reigned 31 years. Early in his reign he  espoused the hitherto unpopular cause of the Christians, and took the  Church under official protection. A legend gained currency that the  emperor's conversion was due to a supernatural manifestation, whereby  he saw a luminous cross appear in the heavens with the inscription,  \"By this sign, conquer.\" The genuineness of this alleged manifestation  is doubtful, and the evidence of history is against it. The incident  is here mentioned to show the means devised to make Christianity  popular at the time.    22. It is held by many judicious historians that Constantine's  so-called conversion was rather a matter of policy than a sincere  acceptance of the truth of Christianity. The emperor himself remained  a catechumen, that is, an unbaptized believer, until shortly before  his death, when he became a member by baptism. But, whatever his  motives may have been, he made Christianity the religion of state,  issuing an official decree to this effect in 313. \"He made the cross  the royal standard; and the Roman legions now for the first time  marched beneath the emblem of Christianity.\" (Myers.)    23. Immediately following the change there was a great competition for  church preferment. The office of a bishop came to be more highly  esteemed than the rank of a general. The emperor himself was the real  head of the Church. It became unpopular and decidedly disadvantageous  in a material sense to be known as a non-Christian. Pagan temples were  transformed into churches, and heathen idols were demolished. We read  that twelve thousand men and a proportionate number of women and  children were baptized into the Church of Rome alone within a single  year. Constantine removed the capital of the empire from Rome to  Byzantium, which city he re-named after himself, Constantinople. This,  the present capital of Turkey, became headquarters of the state  Church.    24. How empty and vain appears the Diocletian boast that Christianity  was forever extinguished! Yet how different was the Church under the  patronage of Constantine from the Church as established by Christ and  as built up by His apostles! The Church had already become apostate as  judged by the standard of its original constitution.      NOTES.    1. _Cause of Pagan Opposition to Christianity_. \"The whole body of  Christians unanimously refused to hold any communion with the gods of  Rome, of the empire, and of mankind. It was in vain that the oppressed  believer asserted the inalienable rights of conscience and private  judgment. Though his situation might excite the pity, his arguments  could never reach the understanding, either of the philosophic or of  the believing part of the pagan world. To their apprehensions, it was  no less a matter of surprise that any individuals should entertain  scruples against complying with the established mode of worship, than  if they had conceived a sudden abhorrence to the manners, the dress,  or the language of their native country. The surprise of the pagans  was soon succeeded by resentment; and the most pious of men were  exposed to the unjust but dangerous imputation of impiety. Malice and  prejudice concurred in representing the Christians as a society of  atheists, who, by the most daring attack on the religious constitution  of the empire, had merited the severest animadversion of the civil  magistrate. They had separated themselves (they gloried in the  confession) from every mode of superstition which was received in any  part of the globe by the various temper of polytheism; but it was not  altogether so evident what deity or what form of worship they had  substituted to the gods and temples of antiquity. The pure and sublime  idea which they entertained of the Supreme Being escaped the gross  conception of the pagan multitude, who were at a loss to discover a  spiritual and solitary God, that was neither represented under any  corporeal figures or visible symbol, nor was adored with the  accustomed pomp of libations and festivals, of altars and sacrifices.\"  (Gibbon, \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\" chap. XVI.)    2. _As to the Number of Persecutions by the Romans_. \"The Romans are  said to have pursued the Christians with the utmost violence in ten  persecutions, but this number is not verified by the ancient history  of the church. For if, by these persecutions, such only are meant as  were singularly severe and universal throughout the empire, then it is  certain that these amount not to the number above mentioned. And, if  we take the provincial and less remarkable persecutions into the  account, they far exceed it. In the fifth century, certain Christians  (were) led by some passages of the holy scriptures and by one  especially in the Revelations (Rev. 17:14), to imagine that the church  was to suffer ten calamities of a most grievous nature. To this  notion, therefore, they endeavored, though not all in the same way, to  accommodate the language of history, even against the testimony of  those ancient records, from whence alone history can speak with  authority.\" (Mosheim, \"Ecclesiastical History,\" Cent. I, Part I; ch.  5:4.)    Speaking on the same subject, Gibbon says: \"As often as any occasional  severities were exercised in the different parts of the empire, the  primitive Christians lamented and perhaps magnified their own  sufferings; but the celebrated number of ten persecutions has been  determined by the ecclesiastical writers of the fifth century, who  possessed a more distinct view of the prosperous or adverse fortunes  of the church from the age of Nero to that of Diocletian. The  ingenious parallels of the ten plagues of Egypt and of the ten horns  of the Apocalypse first suggested this calculation of their minds; and  in their application of the faith of prophecy to the truth of history  they were careful to select those reigns which were indeed the most  hostile to the Christian cause.\" (Gibbon, \"Decline and Fall of the  Roman Empire,\" ch. XVI.)    3. _Extent of the Neronian Persecution_. \"Learned men are not entirely  agreed concerning the extent of this persecution under Nero. Some  confine it to the city of Rome, while others represent it as having  raged throughout the whole empire. The latter opinion, which is also  the most ancient, is undoubtedly to be preferred; as it is certain  that the laws enacted against the Christians were enacted against the  whole body, and not against particular churches, and were consequently  in force in the remotest provinces.\" (Mosheim, \"Ecclesiastical  History,\" Cent. I. Part I, 5:14.)    4. _Correspondence Between Pliny and Trajan_. The inquiry of the  younger Pliny, governor of Pontus, addressed to Trajan, emperor of  Rome, and the imperial reply thereto, are of such interest as to be  worthy of reproduction in full. The version here given is that of  Milner as appears in his \"History of the Church of Christ,\" edition of  1810, Cent. II, ch. 1.    \"_Pliny to Trajan, Emperor_:    \"Health.--It is my usual custom, Sir, to refer all things, of which I  harbor any doubts, to you. For who can better direct my judgment in  its hesitation, or instruct my understanding in its ignorance? I never  had the fortune to be present at any examination of Christians, before  I came into this province. I am therefore at a loss to determine what  is the usual object either of inquiry or of punishment, and to what  length either of them is to be carried. It has also been with me a  question very problematical,--whether any distinction should be made  between the young and the old, the tender and the robust;--whether any  room should be given for repentance, or the guilt of Christianity once  incurred is not to be expiated by the most unequivocal retraction;--  whether the name itself, abstracted from any flagitiousness of  conduct, or the crimes connected with the name, be the object of  punishment. In the meantime, this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35534"],[0,"How to be Happy Though Married: Being a Handbook to Marriage (#15)"],[1,"and duties of ordinary married  life. Let them begin by forming the highest ideal of marriage. Now, and  on every anniversary of their wedding day, they should seriously reflect  upon those vows which are too often taken, either in entire ignorance of  their meaning and import, or thoughtlessly, as though they were mere  incidents of the marriage ceremony.    A Hampshire incumbent recently reported some of the blunders he had  heard made in the marriage service, by that class of persons who have to  pick up the words as best they can from hearing them repeated by others.  He said that in his own parish it was quite the fashion for the man,  when giving the ring, to say to the woman: \"With my body I thee wash  up, and with all my hurdle goods I thee and thou.\" He said the women  were generally better up in this part of the service than the men. One  day, however, a bride startled him by promising, in what she supposed to  be language of the Prayer Book, to take her husband \"to 'ave and to 'old  from this day fortn't, for betterer horse, for richerer power, in  siggerness health, to love cherries, and to bay.\" We have heard of an  ignorant bridegroom, who, confusing the baptismal and marriage services,  replied, when asked if he consented to take the bride for his wife: \"I  renounce them all!\" It is to be hoped that the times of such ignorance  are either passed or passing; still, a little instruction in reference  to marriage vows might be given with advantage in some churches.    In one of his letters Byron tells a story of a learned Jew, who was  remarkable, in the brilliant circles to which his learning gained him  admittance, for his habit of asking questions continuously and  fearlessly, in order to get at the bottom of any matter in discussion.  To a person who was complaining of the Prince Regent's bad treatment of  his old boon companions, this habitual interrogator cried across a  dinner-table: \"And why does the prince act so?\" \"Because he was told  so-and-so by Lord ----; who ought to be ashamed of himself!\" was the  answer. \"But why, sir, has the prince cut _you_?\" inquired the searcher  after truth. \"Because I stuck to my principles--yes, sir, because I  stuck to my principles!\" replied the other, testily, thinking that his  examination was ended. \"_And why did you stick to your principles?_\"  cried the interrogator, throwing the table into a roar of laughter, the  mirth being no more due to the inquisitor's persistence than to his  inability to conceive that any man would stick to his principles simply  because he believed them to be right. Are there not some educated as  well as uneducated people who seem to be quite as incapable of  conceiving that they should keep their marriage vows, simply because it  is dishonourable and wicked to break them?    A mother having become alarmed about the failing state of her daughter's  health, and not being able to get much satisfaction from a consultation  with the village doctor, took her to a London physician for further  advice. He asked a few questions as to the girl's daily habits and mode  of life, carefully stethoscoped her heart and lungs, and then gave an  involuntary sigh. The mother grew pale, and waited anxiously for a  verdict \"Madam,\" he said, \"so far as I can discover, your daughter is  suffering from a most serious complaint, which, for want of a better  name, I shall call 'dulness.' Perhaps it is in your power to cure it. I  have no medicine which is a specific for this disease.\" Girls, who  suffer in this way, too often prescribe for themselves marriage with men  whom they cannot love, honour, and obey. This is as bad as  dram-drinking, or gambling; but what else can the poor things do? They  have not been trained like their brothers to useful work, and have  always been told that woman's first, best occupation is--to be a wife.  To which it may be answered--      \"Most true; but to make a mere business of marriage,      To call it a 'living,' 'vocation,' 'career,'    Is but to pervert, to degrade, and disparage      A contract of all the most sacred and dear.\"    Nor will those vows be regarded with greater sanctity which are taken  against the inclination. Better to be as candid as the girl who, forced  by her parents into a disagreeable match, when the clergyman came to  that part of the service where the bride is asked if she will have the  bridegroom for her husband, said, with great simplicity, \"Oh dear, no,  sir; but you are the first person who has asked my opinion about the  matter!\"    Let us think now what the vows are which, at the altar of God, and in  the presence of our fellow-creatures, we solemnly vow. Both the man and  the woman vow to love, honour, cherish, and be faithful, for better for  worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and health, till death part  them. Then the husband promises to comfort his wife, and the wife to  serve and obey her husband.    A Scotch lady, whose daughter was recently married, was asked by an old  friend whether she might congratulate her upon the event. \"Yes, yes,\"  she answered; \"upon the whole it is very satisfactory; it is true  Jeannie hates her gudeman, but then there's always a something.\" The old  friend might have told this Scotch lady that in making light of love she  made light of that which was needful to hallow her daughter's marriage;  and that even the blessing of a bishop in the most fashionable church  does not prevent a loveless alliance from being a sacrifice of true  chastity.    Contrast the indifference of this Scotch lady in reference to  matrimonial love, with the value set upon it in a letter which Pliny the  Younger, who was a heathen, wrote concerning his wife, Calpurnia, to her  aunt. It is quoted by Dr. Cook as follows: \"She loves me, the surest  pledge of her virtue, and adds to this a wonderful disposition to  learning, which she has acquired from her affection to me. She reads my  writings, studies them, and even gets them by heart. You would smile to  see the concern she is in when I have a cause to plead, and the joy she  shows when it is over. She finds means to have the first news brought  her of the success I meet with in court. If I recite anything in public,  she cannot refrain from placing herself privately in some corner to  hear. Sometimes she accompanies my verses with the lute, without any  master except love--the best of instructors. From these instances I take  the most certain omens of our perpetual and increasing happiness, since  her affection is not founded on my youth or person, which must gradually  decay; but she is in love with the immortal part of me.\"    The second vow taken by both the man and the woman is to \"honour.\"  \"Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving  honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel.\" \"And the wife see that  she reverence her husband.\" The weaker vessel is to be honoured, not  because she is weak, but because, being weak, she acts her part so well.    And even if the wife's courage and endurance should sometimes fail, a  good husband would not withhold honour from her on that account. He  would remember her weaker nature, and her more delicate physical frame,  her more acute nervous sensibility, her greater sensitiveness and  greater trials, the peculiar troubles to which she is subject.    In a lately published \"Narrative of a Journey through the South China  Border Lands,\" we are told that a wife in this part of the world, when  mentioned by her husband, \"which happens as seldom as possible,\" is  called \"My dull thorn,\" \"The thorn in my ribs,\" or \"The mean one of the  inner rooms.\" This is the way _not_ to honour a wife. But the honour  which a husband should give is not merely that chivalrous bearing which  the strong owe to the weak, and which every woman has a right to expect  from every man. In describing a husband who was in the habit of  honouring his wife, Dr. Landels remarks that \"one could not be in his  presence without feeling it. Never a word escaped his lips which  reflected directly or indirectly on her. Never an action he performed  would have led to the impression that there could be any difference  between them. She was the queen of his home. All about them felt that in  his estimation, and by his desire, her authority was unimpeachable, and  her will law. And the effect of his example was that children and  friends and domestics alike hedged her about with sweet respect. A man  of strong will himself, his was never known to be in collision with  hers; and, without any undue yielding, the homage which he paid to his  wife made their union one of the happiest it has ever been our privilege  to witness.\"    And the wife, on her part, is to reverence and honour her husband as  long as she possibly can. If possible, she should let her husband  suppose that she thinks him a _good_ husband, and it will be a strong  stimulus to his being so. As long as he thinks he possesses the  character, he will take some pains to deserve it; but when he has lost  the name he will be very apt to abandon the reality altogether. \"To  treat men as if they were better than they are is the surest way to  _make_ them better than they are.\" Keats tells us that he has met with  women who would like to be married to a Poem, and given away by a  Novel; but wives must not cease to honour their husbands on discovering  that instead of being poetical and romantic they are very ordinary,  imperfect beings.    There are homes where poverty has never left its pinch nor sickness paid  its visit; homes where there is plenty on the board, and health in the  circle, and yet where a skeleton more grim than death haunts the  cupboard, and an ache harsher than consumption's tooth gnaws sharply at  the heart. Why do those shoulders stoop so early ere life's noon has  passed? Why is it that the sigh which follows the closing of the door  after the husband has gone off to business is a sigh of relief,"]]]
