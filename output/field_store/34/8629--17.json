Next she tied round her a girdle of opossum's sinews with strands  of woven opossum's hair hanging about a foot square in front. Round her  arms she bound goomils--opossum hair armlets--into which she placed  more sprays of flowers, matching those in the girl's hair.    To show that the occasion was a sacred one a sprig of Dheal tree was  placed through the hole in the septum of the nose. The toilet of a  wirreebeeun was now complete.    The old woman gave her a bunch of smoking Budtha leaves to carry, and  told her what to do. Note here the origin of bridal bouquets.    Having received her instructions, the girl, holding the smoking twigs,  went towards the big camp.    When the women there saw her coming they began to sing a song in, to  her, a strange language.    On a log, with his back towards her--for he must not yet look on her  face--sat the man to whom she was betrothed. The girl went up to him.  As the women chanted louder she threw the smoking Budtha twigs away,  placed a hand on each of his shoulders and shook him. Then she turned  and ran back to her new camp, the women singing and pelting her with  dry twigs and small sticks as she went. For another moon she stayed  with her granny in this camp, then the women made her another one  nearer.    In a few weeks they made her one on the outskirts of the main camp.  Here she stayed until they made her another in the camp, but a little  apart. In front of the opening of this dardurr they made a fire. That  night her betrothed camped on one side of this fire and she on the  other. For a moon they camped so. Then the old granny told the girl she  must camp on the same side of the fire as her betrothed, and as long as  she lived be his faithful and obedient wife, having no thought of other  men. Should he ill-treat her, her relations had the power to take her  from him. Or should he for some reason, after a while, not care for  her, he can send her back to her people; should she have a child he  leaves it with her until old enough to camp away from her, when it is  returned to him.    The wedding presents are not given to the bride and bridegroom, but by  the latter to his mother-in-law, to whom, however, he is never allowed  to speak. Failing a mother-in-law, the presents are given to the  nearest of kin to the wife. You can hardly reckon it as purchase money,  for sometimes a man gives no presents and yet gets a wife.    In books about blacks, you always read of the subjection of the women,  but I have seen henpecked black husbands.    There are two codes of morals, one for men and one for women. Old  Testament morality for men, New Testament for women. The black men keep  the inner mysteries of the Boorah, or initiation ceremonies, from the  knowledge of women, but so do Masons keep their secrets.    As to the black women carrying most of the baggage on march, naturally  so; the men want their hands free for hunting en route, or to be in  readiness for enemies in a strange country.    Black women think a great deal of the Moonaibaraban, or as they more  often call them, Kumbuy, or sister-in-law. These are spirit-women who  come a few days after the Boorah to bring presents to the women  relations of the boys who have been initiated. The Kumbuy are never  seen, but their voices are heard--voices like dogs barking; on hearing  which the women in the camp have to answer, calling out:    'Are you my Kumbuy?'    An answer comes like a muffled bark, 'Bah! bah bah!'    Then the old men--crafty old men--go out to where the 'bahing' comes  from, and bring in the gifts, which take the form of food, yams, honey,  fruit principally.    These Kumbuy are among the few beneficent spirits they never hurt any  one, simply supply the bereaved women with comfort in the shape of  food, for the temporary loss of their male relatives. Should an  uninitiate have a wife, which of course is improper, the Kumbuy decline  to recognise her; and should she presume to answer their spirit back,  they make in token of displeasure a thudding noise as if earth were  being violently banged with a yam stick. She has encroached on the  Kumbuy preserves, for prior to his initiation a man should only have a  spirit wife, never an incarnate one.    If you ask a black woman why the Kumbuy thud the earth in answer to an  initiate's wife, she will say:    'Dat one jealous.' jealousy even in the spirit world of women!    Unchaste women were punished terribly. After we went west even the  death penalty for wantonness was enforced, though at the time we did  not know it.    Should a girl be found guilty of a frailty, it being her first fault,  her brothers and nearest male relations made a ring round her, after  having bound her hands and feet, and toss her one from the other until  she is in a dazed condition and almost frightened to death.    The punishment over, she is unbound and given to her betrothed, or a  husband chosen for her.    Should a woman have been discovered to be an absolute wanton, men from  any of the clans make a ring round her, she being bound, and tossed  from one to the other, and when exhausted is unbound and left by her  relations to the men to do as they please to her--the almost inevitable  result is death. With this terror before them, it is possible the old  blacks are right who say that their women were very different in their  domestic relations in olden times.          CHAPTER VIII    THE TRAINING OF A BOY UP TO BOORAH PRELIMINARIES      At the boy manufactory, Boomayahmayahmul, the wood lizard, was the  principal worker, though Bahloo from time to time gave him assistance.    The little blacks throw their mythical origin at each other tauntingly.  A little black girl, when offended with a boy friend, says:    'Ooh, a lizard made you.'    'Wah! wah! a crow made you,' he retorts.    Up to a certain age boys are trained as are girls--charms sung over  them to make them generous, honest, good swimmers, and the rest; but  after that they are taken into the Weedegah, or bachelors' camp, and  developed on manly lines.    When he is about seven years old, his mother will paint her son up  every day for about a week with red and white colourings. After that he  would go to the Weedegah Gahreemai, bachelors' camp. He would then be  allowed to go hunting with boys and men. He would see, now when he was  out with the men, how fire was made in the olden time, almost a lost  art now when wax matches are plentiful.    No boy who had not been to a Boorah would dare to try to make fire.    The implements for fire-making are a little log about as thick as a  man's arm, of Nummaybirah wood--a rather soft white wood--and a split  flat piece about a foot long and three inches wide. The little log was  split open at one end, a wedge put in it, and the opening filled up  with dry grass broken up. This log was laid on the ground and firmly  held there; the fire-maker squatted in front, and with the flat piece  rubbed edgeways across the opening in the log. The sawdust fell quickly  into the opening. After about a minute and a half's rubbing a smoke  started out. After rubbing on a little longer the fire-maker took a  handful of dry grass, emptied the smoking sawdust and dry grass into  it, waved it about, and in three and a half minutes from starting the  process I have seen a blaze. Sometimes it has taken longer, but just  under five minutes is the longest time I have ever seen it take.    They use pine too, I believe, but whenever I timed them it was  Nummaybirah they were using.    The boys pick up the woodcraft of the tribes when they begin going out  with the men. As the boys began to grow up, when a good season came  round, and game and grass were plentiful, the old men were seen to draw  apart often and talk earnestly.    At length there came a night when was heard a whizzing, whirling boom  far in the scrub. As the first echo of it reached the camp, the women,  such as were still young enough to bear children, stopped their ears,  for should any such hear the Gurraymi, the women's name for the  Gayandi, or Boorah spirit's voice, that spirit will first make them  mad, then kill them.    The old women began to sing a Boorah song. To deaden the sound of the  dreaded voice, opossum rugs were thrown over the children, none of whom  must hear, unless they are boys old enough to be initiated; the sound  reveals the fact to such that the hour of their initiation is at hand.    The men all gathered together with the boys, except two old wirreenuns,  who earlier in the evening have seemingly quarrelled and gone away into  the scrub.    The men and boys in camp march up and down to some distance from the  camp. The old women keep on singing, and one man with a spear painted  red with a waywah fastened on top, walks up and down in the middle of  the crowd of men, holding the spear, with its emblematic belt of  manhood, aloft; as he does so, calling out the names of the bends of  the creek, beginning with the one nearest to which they are camped.  When he gets to the end of the names along that creek and comes to the  name of a big river, all the men join him in giving a loud crow like    'Wah! wah! wah!'    Then he begins with the names along the next creek across the big  river, and so on; at the mention of each main stream the crowd again  join in the cry of    'Wah! wah! wah!'    All the while, closer and still closer, comes the sound of the Gayandi,  as the men call the Gurraymi, or bull roarer.    At length the two old wirreenuns come back to the camp and the noise  ceases, to recur sometimes during the night, when I expect, did any one  search for them, the old wirreenuns would be found missing from the  camp.    After the first whirling of the bull roarers and calling of the creek  names, the Gooyeanawannah, or messengers, prepare for a journey, and  when ready, the wirreenuns start them off in various directions to  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38207"],[0,"On the Origin and Metamorphoses of Insects (#15)"],[1,"iffers, no doubt, in its general  appearance, owing to its greater clumsiness, but still essentially  agrees with that already described.    No Dipterous larva, so far as I know, belongs truly to this type; in  fact, the early stages of the pupa in the Diptera seem in some respects  to correspond to the larvae of other Insect orders. The Development of  the Diptera is, however, as Weissman[62] has shown, very abnormal in  other respects.    Thus, then, we find in many of the principal groups of insects that,  greatly as they differ from one another in their mature condition, when  they leave the egg they more nearly resemble the typical insect type;  consisting of a head; a three-segmented thorax, with three pairs of  legs; and a many-jointed abdomen, often with anal appendages. Now, is  there any mature animal which answers to this description? We need not  have been surprised if this type, through which it would appear that  insects must have passed so many ages since (for winged Neuroptera have  been found in the carboniferous strata) had long ago become extinct. Yet  it is not so. The interesting genus _Campodea_ (Pl. 3, Fig. 5) still  lives; it inhabits damp earth, and closely resembles the larva of  _Chloeon_ (Pl. 2, Fig. 1), constituting, indeed, a type which, as shown in  Pl. 4, occurs in many orders of insects. It is true that the  mouth-parts of _Campodea_ do not resemble either the strongly mandibulate  form which prevails among the larvae of Coleoptera, Orthoptera,  Neuroptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera; or the suctorial type of the  Homoptera and Heteroptera. It is, however, not the less interesting or  significant on that account, since, as I have elsewhere[63] pointed out,  its mouth-parts are intermediate between the mandibulate and haustellate  types; a fact which seems to me most suggestive.    It appears, then, that there are good grounds for considering that the  various types of insects are descended from ancestors more or less  resembling the genus _Campodea_, with a body divided into head, thorax,  and abdomen: the head provided with mouth-parts, eyes, and one pair of  antennae; the thorax with three pairs of legs; and the abdomen, in all  probability, with caudal appendages.    If these views are correct, the genus _Campodea_ must be regarded as a  form of remarkable interest since it is the living representative of a  primaeval type, from which not only the Collembola and Thysanura, but the  other great orders of insects have derived their origin.    From what lower group the _Campodea_ type was itself derived is a question  of great difficulty. Fritz Mueller indeed says,[64] \"if all the classes  of Arthropoda (Crustacea, Insecta, Myriopoda, and Arachnida) are indeed  all branches of a common stem (and of this there can scarcely be a  doubt), it is evident that the water-inhabiting and water-breathing  Crustacea must be regarded as the original stem from which the other  terrestrial classes, with their tracheal respiration, have branched  off.\" Haeckel, moreover, is of the opinion that the Tracheata are  developed from the Crustacea, and probably from the Zoepoda. For my own  part, though I feel very great diffidence in expressing an opinion at  variance with that of such high authorities, I am rather disposed to  suggest that the _Campodea_ type may possibly have been derived from a  less highly developed one, resembling the modern Tardigrade,[65] a (Fig.  56) smaller and much less highly organized being than _Campodea_. It  possesses two eyes, three anterior pairs of legs, and one at the  posterior end of the body, giving it a curious resemblance to some  Lepidopterous larvae.    [Illustration: FIG. 56, Tardigrade (after Dujardin).]    These legs, however, as will be seen, are reduced to mere projections.  But for them, the Tardigrada would closely resemble the vermiform larva  so common among insects. Among Trichoptera the larva early acquires  three pairs of legs, but as Zaddach has shown,[66] there is a stage,  though it is quickly passed through, in which the divisions of the body  are indicated, but no trace of legs is yet present. Indeed, there appear  to be reasons for considering that while among Crustacea the appendages  appear before the segments, in Insects the segments precede the  appendages, although this stage of development is very transitory, and  apparently, in some cases, altogether suppressed. I say \"apparently,\"  because, as I have already mentioned, I am not yet satisfied that it  will not eventually be found to be so in all cases. Zaddach, in his  careful observations of the embryology of _Phryganea_, only once found a  specimen in this stage, which also, according to the researches of  Huxley,[67] seems to be little more than indicated in _Aphis_. It is  therefore possible that in other cases, when no such stage has been  observed, it not really may be absent, but, from its transitoriness, may  have hitherto escaped attention.    Fritz Mueller has expressed the opinion[68] that this vermiform type is  of comparatively recent origin. He says: \"The ancient insects approached  more nearly to the existing Orthoptera, and perhaps to the wingless  Blattidae, than to any other order, and the complete metamorphosis of the  Beetles, Lepidoptera, &c., is of later origin.\" \"There were,\" he adds,  \"perfect insects before larvae and pupae.\" This opinion has been adopted  by Mr. Packard[69] in his \"Embryological Studies on Hexapodous Insects.\"    M. Brauer[70] also considers that the vermiform larva is a more recent  type than the Hexapod form, and is to be regarded not as a developmental  form, but as an adaptational modification of the earlier active hexapod  type. In proof of this he quotes the case of _Sitaris_.    Considering, however, the peculiar habits of this genus, to which I have  already referred, and also that the vermiform type is altogether lower  in organization and less differentiated than the _Campodea_ form, I cannot  but regard this case as exceptional; one in which the development has  been, as it were, to use an expression of Fritz Mueller's, \"falsified\" by  the struggle for existence, and which therefore does not truly indicate  the successive stages of evolution. On the whole, the facts seem to me  to point to the conclusion that, though the grub-like larvae of Coleoptera  and some other insects, owe their present form mainly to the influence  of external circumstances, and partially also to atavism, still the  _Campodea_ type is itself derived from earlier vermiform ancestors.  Nicolas Wagner has shown in the case of a small gnat, allied to  _Cecidomyia_, that even now, in some instances, the vermiform larvae  possess the power of reproduction. Such a larva (as, for instance, Fig.  57) very closely resembles some of the Rotatoria, such for instance as  _Albertia_ or _Notommata_, which however possess vibratile cilia. There is,  indeed, one genus--_Lindia_ (Fig. 58)--in which these ciliae are altogether  absent, and which, though resembling _Macrobiotus_ in many respects,  differs from that genus in being entirely destitute of legs. I have  never met with it myself, but it is described by Dujardin, who found it  in a ditch near Paris, as being oblong, vermiform, divided into rings,  and terminating posteriorly in two short conical appendages. The jaws  are not unlike those of the larvae of Flies, and indeed many naturalists  meeting with such a creature would, I am sure, regard it as a small  Dipterous larva; yet Dujardin figures a specimen containing an egg, and  seems to have no doubt that it is a mature form.[71]    For the next descending stage we must, I think, look among the  Infusoria, through such genera as _Chaetonotus_ or _Ichthydium_. Other  forms of the Rotatoria, such for instance as _Rattulus_, and still more  the very remarkable species discovered in 1871 by Mr. Hudson,[72] and  described under the name of _Pedalion mira_, seem to lead to the  Crustacea through the Nauplius form. Dr. Cobbold tells me that he  regards the _Gordii_ as the lowest of the Scolecida; Mr. E. Ray  Lankester considers some of the Turbellaria, such genera as  _Mesostomum_, _Vortex_, &c., to be the lowest of existing worms;  excluding the parasitic groups. Haeckel[73] also regards the Turbellaria  as forming the nearest approach to the Infusoria. The true worms seem,  however, to constitute a separate branch of the animal kingdom.    We may take, as an illustration of the lower worms, the genus  Prorhynchus (Fig. 59), which consists of a hollow cylindrical body,  containing a straight simple tube, the digestive organ.    But however simple such a creature as this may be, there are others  which are far less complex, far less differentiated; which therefore, on  Mr. Darwin's principles, may be considered still more closely to  represent the primaeval ancestor from which these more highly-developed  types have been derived, and which, in spite of their great  antiquity--in spite of, or perhaps in consequence of, their simplicity,  still maintain themselves almost unaltered.    Thus the form which Haeckel has described[74] under the name  _Protamoeba primitiva_, Pl. 5, Fig. 1-5, consists of a homogeneous and  structureless substance, which continually alters its form; putting out  and drawing in again more or less elongated processes, and creeping  about like a true _Amoeba_, from which, however, _Protamoeba_ differs,  in the absence of a nucleus. It seems difficult to imagine anything  simpler; indeed, as described, it appears to be an illustration of  properties without structure. It takes into itself any suitable particle  with which it comes in contact, absorbs that which is nutritious, and  rejects the rest. From time to time a constriction appears at the centre  (Pl. 5, Fig. 2), its form approximates more and more to that of an  hour-glass (Pl. 5, Fig. 3), and at length the two halves separate, and  each commences an independent existence (Pl. 5, Fig. 5).
