(BOOK II. OF THE \"COMMENTARIES.\")      [Sidenote: League of the Belgae. Caesar advances from Besancon to the  Aisne.]    I. The brilliant successes gained by Caesar over the Helvetii and the  Germans had delivered the Republic from an immense danger, but at the  same time they had roused the distrust and jealousy of most of the  nations of Gaul. These conceived fears for their independence, which  were further increased by the presence of the Roman army in Sequania.  The irritation was very great among the Belgae. They feared that their  turn to be attacked would come when Celtic Gaul was once reduced to  peace. Besides, they were excited by influential men who understood  that, under Roman domination, they would have less chance of obtaining  possession of the supreme power. The different tribes of Belgic Gaul  entered into a formidable league, and reciprocally exchanged hostages.    Caesar learnt these events in the Cisalpine province, through public  rumour and the letters of Labienus. Alarmed at the news, he raised two  legions in Italy, the 13th and 14th, and, in the beginning of  spring,[238] sent them into Gaul, under the command of the lieutenant  Q. Pedius.[239] It is probable that these troops, to reach Sequania  promptly, crossed the Great St. Bernard, for Strabo relates that one of  the three routes which led from Italy into Gaul passed by Mount  Poerinus (_Great St. Bernard_), after having traversed the country of  the Salassi (_Valley of Aosta_), and that this latter people offered at  first to assist Caesar's troops in their passage by levelling the roads  and throwing bridges across the torrents; but that, suddenly changing  their tone, they had rolled masses of rock down upon them and pillaged  their baggage. It was no doubt in the sequel of this defection that,  towards the end of the year 697, Caesar, as we shall see farther on, sent  Galba into the Valais, to take vengeance on the mountaineers for their  perfidious conduct and to open a safe communication with Italy.[240]    As soon as forage was abundant, he rejoined his legions in person,  probably at Besancon, since, as we have seen, they had been placed in  winter quarters in Sequania. He charged the Senones and the other Celts  who bordered upon Belgic Gaul to watch what was doing there and inform  him of it. Their reports were unanimous: troops were being raised, and  an army was assembling. Caesar then decided upon immediately entering  into campaign.    His army consisted of eight legions: they bore the numbers 7, 8, 9, 10,  11, 12, 13, and 14. As their effective force, in consequence of marches  and previous combats, cannot have been complete, we may admit a mean of  5,000 men to the legion, which would make 40,000 men of infantry. Adding  to these one-third of auxiliaries, Cretan archers, slingers, and  Numidians, the total of infantry would have been 53,000 men. There was,  in addition to these, 5,000 cavalry and a body of AEduan troops under the  command of Divitiacus. Thus the army of Caesar amounted to at least  60,000 soldiers, without reckoning the servants for the machines,  drivers, and valets, who, according to the instance cited by Orosius,  amounted to a very considerable number.[241]    After securing provisions, Caesar started from Besancon, probably in the  second fortnight in May, passed the Saone at Seveux (_see Plate 4_),  crossed the country of the Lingones in the direction of Langres, at  Bar-sur-Aube, and entered, towards Vitry-le-Francois, on the territory  of the Remi, having marched in about a fortnight 230 kilometres, the  distance from Besancon to Vitry-le-Francois.[242]    The Remi were the first Belgic people he encountered in his road (_qui  proximi Galliae ex Belgis sunt_). Astonished at his sudden appearance,  they sent two deputies, Iccius and Adecumborius, the first personages of  their country, to make their submission, and offer provisions and every  kind of succour. They informed Caesar that all the Belgae were in arms,  and that the Germans on that side of the Rhine had joined the coalition;  for themselves, they had refused to take any part in it, but the  excitement was so great that they had not been able to dissuade from  their warlike projects the Suessiones themselves, who were united with  them by community of origin, laws, and interests. \"The Belgae,\" they  added, \"proud of having been formerly the only people of Gaul who  preserved their territory from the invasion of the Teutones and Cimbri,  had the loftiest idea of their own valour. In their general assembly,  each people had engaged to furnish the following contingents:--The  Bellovaci, the most warlike, could send into the field 100,000 men; they  have promised 60,000 picked troops, and claim the supreme direction of  the war. The Suessiones, their neighbours, masters of a vast and fertile  territory, in which are reckoned twelve towns, furnish 50,000 men; they  have for their king Galba, who has been invested, by the consent of the  allies, with the chief command. The Nervii, the most distant of all, and  the most barbarous among these peoples, furnish the same number; the  Atrebates, 15,000; the Ambiani, 10,000; the Morini, 25,000; the Menapii,  7000; the Caletes, 10,000; the Veliocasses and the Veromandui, 10,000;  the Aduatuci, 19,000; lastly, the Condrusi, Eburones, Caeresi, and  Paemani, comprised under the general name of Germans, are to send 40,000;  in all, about 296,000 men.\"[243]      [Sidenote: Caesar's Camp at Berry-au-Bac.]    II. Caesar could judge, from this information, the formidable character  of the league which he had now to combat. His first care was to try to  divide the hostile forces, and, with this view, he induced Divitiacus,  in spite of the friendly relations which had long united the AEdui with  the Bellovaci, to invade and ravage the territory of the latter with the  AEduan troops. He then required the senate of the Remi to repair to his  presence, and the children of the _principes_ to be brought to him as  hostages; and then, on information that Galba was marching to meet him,  he resolved to move to the other side of the Aisne, which crossed the  extremity of the territory of the Remi (_quod est in extremis Remorum  finibus_),[244] and encamp there in a strong position, to await the  enemy's attack. The road he had hitherto followed led straight to the  Aisne, and crossed it by a bridge at the spot where now stands the  village of Berry-au-Bac. (_See Plate 7._) He marched in great haste  towards this bridge, led his army across it, and fixed his camp on the  right side of the road, on the hill situated between the Aisne and the  Miette, a small stream with marshy banks, which makes a bend in that  river between Berry-au-Bac and Pontavert. (_See Plate 8._) This hill,  called Mauchamp, is of small elevation (about 25 metres) above the  valley of the Aisne, and in its length, from east to west, it presents  sufficient space for the Roman army to deploy. Laterally, it sinks to  the level of the surrounding ground by slight undulations, and the side  which looks upon the Miette descends by a gentle slope towards the banks  of the stream. This position offered several advantages: the Aisne  defended one side of the camp; the rear of the army was protected, and  the transports of provisions could arrive in safety through the  countries of the Remi and other friendly peoples. Caesar ordered a work  to be constructed on the right bank of the Aisne, at the extremity of  the bridge, where he established a post (_see Plates 8 and 9_),[245] and  he left on the other side of the river the lieutenant Q. Titurius  Sabinus with six cohorts. The camp was surrounded by a retrenchment  twelve feet high, and by a fosse eighteen feet wide.[246]    Meanwhile the Belgae, after having concentrated their forces in the  country of the Suessiones, to the north of the Aisne, had invaded the  territory of the Remi. On their road, and at eight miles from the Roman  camp (_see Plate 7_), was a town of the Remi called Bibrax  (_Vieux-Laon_).[247] The Belgae attacked it vigorously, and it was  defended with difficulty all day. These peoples, like the Celts,  attacked fortresses by surrounding them with a crowd of combatants,  throwing from every side a great quantity of stones, to drive the  defenders away from the walls; then, forming the tortoise, they advanced  against the gates and sapped the walls. When night had put a stop to the  attack, Iccius, who commanded in the town, sent information to Caesar  that he could hold out no longer, unless he received prompt succour.  Towards midnight the latter sent him Numidians, Cretan archers, and  Balearic slingers, who had the messengers of Iccius for their guides.  This re-enforcement raised the courage of the besieged, and deprived the  enemy of the hope of taking the town; and after remaining some time  round Bibrax, laying waste the land and burning the hamlets and houses,  they marched towards Caesar, and halted at less than two miles from his  camp. Their fires, kindled on the right bank of the Miette, indicated a  front of more than 8,000 paces (twelve kilometres).    The great numbers of the enemy, and their high renown for bravery, led  the proconsul to resolve to postpone the battle. If his legions had in  his eyes an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45542"],[0,"Eighteen Months in the War Zone (#15)"],[1,"of \"Here we are--here we are--here we are  again!\" a man was borne in with his eyes blown out. He lay very still,  as if the unaccustomedness of it was yet upon him. The tears blinded  me. Then he too began to sing.    The spirits of the men are wonderful. \"It's worth losing a limb to live  through a victory!\" they say.    When our work was over we left the close, smoke-choked room (and it  is wonderful how soldiers who have had a sufficiency of open-air life  seem to revel in closed doors and windows!) for a short stroll. It was  a still, foreboding night. The barriers were well guarded, darkness  reigned over the town, and as we strolled along the rough road our path  was lighted only by the passing ambulances, whilst across the lowering  heavy heavens played the searchlights.    Ambulance after ambulance passed, a few going fast, most, alas! at the  slow, cautious speed that betokens the worst.    What untold misery these crushed bits of humanity mean, borne swiftly  to the silent city of suffering! How gladly we would suffer for them!  Yet not a moan, not a groan, in those great wards whilst mind and will  have power to cope with the agonies of the flesh.      _March 12th._ We heard interesting anecdotes of our fighters at  Christmas-time from an important man on the court martial. One private,  under cover of festivities, slipped down to the base, where for some  months he has lived in style on French bounty as an officer of the  Guards! Another man, an N.C.O. employed in office work, was told off  to write out notices forbidding the men overburdened with Christmas  gifts to return things home, as they have been doing. He handed in the  documents, and with them a big parcel to be censored, which when opened  was found to contain a quantity of socks, bearing the legend: \"These  may come in useful.\"      _March 13th._ Soup is the latest addition to our bill of fare for the  men, who greatly appreciate it as being more nourishing than tea.    Our battle with Primus stoves is never-ending. The roar of these little  indispensable instruments of torture haunts us, and an effigy of one  will assuredly be engraven on some of our tombstones! Apropos of food,  we have grown almost into vegetarians, the meat we get being mostly  horse--which, dressed in the delightfully piquant French style, is  tasty but not nourishing--or the eternal pork that occurs and recurs  with clockwork regularity alternately disguised as veal, lamb or mutton.    There are days when we envy the men--whose rations of good bully beef  they affect to scorn--with all our hearts.    The spring push continues. The rapidity with which the Neuve Chapelle  men were brought down to the base, often finding themselves in hospital  twelve hours after they fell, is incredible.    Last night a Red Cross ambulance driver, who had passed through before,  came in for some coffee. As he counted his change I noted his eyes  were dim with unshed tears. When he confessed that the strain of many  sleepless nights is beginning to tell on him, I could find few words of  comfort.    The awful groans, the prayers for release as he drives along the  jolting roads, petrify him. And these last days have been pregnant with  work for the ambulances. The culminating point was reached to-night,  when, the car breaking down on a lonely road, he stepped round to find  out how his men were, and discovered that of four only one still lived.      _March 18th._ To-day the news came that the hostel is to be officially  opened. From the batch of War Office correspondence with which I am now  inundated I glean:    1. \"Arrangements have now been made to send to France at the public  expense a limited number of relatives of soldiers reported to be in a  very serious condition in the Base Hospitals.\"    2. \"The number will be limited to six persons at each of the Bases and  to one relative in the case of each soldier, the accommodation being  provided by the Y.M.C.A., and visits will only be allowed in cases in  which the Medical Officer considers that the patient would benefit by  the presence of a relation.\"    The rest of the documents relate to the laws that govern the free  passage, and the certificates to the effect that the relative is unable  to pay necessary expenses required before passage is granted, every  emergency being admirably prepared for.    Walking out after some necessary shopping, I noticed how the Wimereux  road has changed--is changing. Often during the winter months we  tramped along in the blinding rain wondering at the loneliness of it  all, meeting none but pickets at the barricades, the storm-swept roads  lighted every twenty minutes by a passing tram!    And now? Spring is beginning to show in every cranny. The few trees  are bursting with buds. The road is one incessant rush of cars. The  once sleepy-looking fort, with its visible guns facing the sea, booms  an occasional shot across the bows of a defaulting vessel, and French  soldiers manoeuvre on the cliffs.    It seems as if spring had put life into everything. To the left a camp  hospital is springing up, and khaki figures toil away with ropes and  canvas. To the right, by the sea, walls of earth are being thrown up  that look like trenches, but are in reality drains.    Even the men from the trenches are full of the dramatic contrasts of  warfare in spring--the song of the lark or nightingale interrupted by  the bursting of the \"Jack Johnsons\"; the burned trees and sprouting  buds. They tell us, too, most extraordinary tales of women being found  in the German trenches we have recently gained: some maintain they  were French civilian prisoners; others that they were the wives of  some of the front-trench Huns. At any rate, the extraordinary fact  remains that they really _were_ there.      _March 19th._ With the aid of a fatigue party of R.A.M.C. men I  succeeded in getting the upstairs rooms of our place into a semblance  of order. The French staff, too, were invaluable, nothing being too  much trouble for the _pauvres blesses_. Anxieties never come singly,  and to-day proved our heaviest day owing to an influx of Canadians and  an army of navvies in Government employment. No sooner were things  straight than in came our first two \"wounded relatives\"--as we have  decided to dub our guests. Weary, dazed, helpless as children, there  was nothing to do but find them some hot supper and get them to bed,  with promises of conducting them to the hospital the first thing in the  morning.    There being no cupboards in the hostel, we have set to work to make  them out of old packing-cases, and with the remnants of our curtains  and old tablecloths we find them to be, if not beautiful, quite as  serviceable as could be expected.    One difficulty we cannot overcome is the odour from the cesspool that  forms our drainage system, and makes one of the valuable rooms quite  untenantable and another hardly aromatic!      _March 21st._ On our way home last night we paused a moment to look at  the sky.    Gazing from the bridge into the water, it seemed a very Paradise. Every  little star was reflected in the river, and a yellow crescent moon rode  low in the heavens. No sound save the murmur of the sea. Suddenly there  fell upon our ears the strains of a mandoline in the distance that  transported us of a sudden to the sunny shores of the Adriatic.    Our delay might have cost us dear, for on our arrival home my attic was  on fire, some clothing that my companion had put on the stove pipes to  air having caught, smouldered, and set light to linoleum and woodwork.  Another ten minutes and nothing could have saved this jerry-built  wooden villa. It was dawn before we slept, and, needless to remark, I  feel like a kipper to-day, the smell of the smoke is so strong; or some  amphibious animal, for the floor is inundated with water.      _March 23rd._ The news of victories and losses in the outside world  affects us greatly, and the fall of Przemysl to the Russians has had a  very good effect on our spirits.    For ourselves, we are growing accustomed to alarms. We have so many  Zeppelin scares that they begin to be of no interest. A horn is  sounded. The French sentries on the bridge grow seemingly agitated; the  French guard turn out. Groups of people stand gazing Calais-wards into  the sky. An aeroplane comes over--scouting--and that is all.    Apparently, however, the biplane that passed so close that it seemed  almost on top of our balcony yesterday, was one of those which dropped  bombs on Dover! Our first conscious sight of hostile craft, this,  though we saw something strangely resembling a periscope on the glassy  waters.      _March 26th._ A strange little tragedy is being enacted in our kitchen.  Our landlady's husband was reported \"missing,\" and whilst she was gone  in search of further information a neighbour, who had been fighting  by his side, came in to confirm the worst fears. He was killed by a  sniper, we were told, after only one month in the trenches; and but  yesterday the poor little woman was spending one franc fifty to send  him a fourpenny piece of sausage.    She came in happily content, having learned no particulars, talking  cheerfully of the now fashionable khaki uniforms the women are  adopting, and the weeping figures in the kitchen pulled themselves  together and pretended nothing had occurred.      _March 29th._ When the news was broken they feared for her reason. For  the last three days she has lain foodless and sleepless, hugging the  portrait of her husband to her heart, sorting out his old letters,  whilst groups of weeping, crepe-swathed friends throng the stuffy,  unventilated room.    The Boulogne regiment, it seems, has had a bad cutting-up. Hardly  a woman who is not a widow now. \"Mort pour la patrie!\" they cry  sadly--\"et apres la guerre?\"    To us any condition of \"apres la guerre\" has become unthinkable.  Sometimes it seems it must be the end of the world.      _March "]]]
