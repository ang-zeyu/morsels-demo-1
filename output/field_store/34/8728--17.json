He expressed  himself in friendly terms towards Joseph and the brethren. Being a very  rough man in his language, he cursed the judges and the governor and  everybody else that would not step forward and help our friends out  of the hands of their persecutors, for he did not believe they were  guilty of any of the crimes alleged against them. Said he, \"There is no  proof that these men have committed any crime worthy of imprisonment or  death, and the Mormons have been treated mean.\" Looking us directly in  the eye, he said, with an oath, \"Look at their eyes; see how bright and  keen they are! They are whipped but not conquered; you can see that in  their eyes.\"    There were several men in Liberty who were very friendly to the  brethren. I called on them when I went there and they treated me with  great civility. Among these were General Doniphan and Atchison and the  keeper of the tavern where I put up at, and several of the foremost men  who belonged to the masonic fraternity.    Those men whom I have named, and several others, revolted at the  scenes enacted against the \"Mormons,\" and would have liberated the  brethren, had it not been for the \"outside pressure,\" that is, the  strong prejudices imbibed by the people generally against us, and their  blood-thirsty desire to kill the Prophets.    I sent one hundred dollars by Brother Stephen Markham to Joseph, and  also various sums at different times by other individuals.    The mob continued to threaten the few Saints who remained in Far West,  and accordingly on the 14th of April, 1838, the committee, who had been  left there to look after the wants of the poor, removed thirty-six of  the helpless families into Tenney's grove, about twenty-five miles from  Far West. I was obliged to secrete myself in the corn-fields and woods  during the day and only venture out in the evening, to counsel the  committee and brethren in private houses.    On the morning of the 18th, as I was going to the committee room to  tell the brethren to wind up their affairs and be off, or their lives  would be taken, I was met on the public square by several of the mob.  One of them asked, with an oath, if I was a \"Mormon.\"    I replied, \"I am a 'Mormon.'\"    With a series of blasphemous expressions, they then threatened to blow  my brains out, and also tried to ride over me with their horses, in the  presence of Elias Smith, Theodore Turley and others of the committee.    It was but a few minutes after I had notified the committee to leave  before the mob gathered at the tithing house, and began breaking  clocks, chairs, windows, looking-glasses and furniture, and making a  complete wreck of everything they could move, while Captain Bogart, the  County judge, looked on and laughed. A mobber named Whittaker threw an  iron pot at the head of Theodore Turley and hurt him considerably, when  Whittaker jumped about and laughed like a mad man; and all this at the  time when we were using our utmost endeavors to get the Saints away  from Far West. The brethren gathered up what they could, and fled from  Far West in one hour. The mob staid until the committee left, and then  plundered thousands of dollars worth of property which had been left by  the brethren and sisters to assist the poor to remove.    One mobber rode up, and, finding no convenient place to fasten his  horse to, shot a cow that was standing near, while a girl was milking  her, and while the poor animal was struggling in death, he cut a strip  of her hide from the nose to her tail, to which he fastened his halter.    During the commotion of this day, a great portion of the records of the  committee, accounts, history, etc., were destroyed or stolen.    Hearing that Joseph and his brethren had escaped from their guard while  they were on their way from Daviess to Boone County, to which place  they had obtained a change of venue, I called on Shadrach Roundy, with  whom I started immediately towards Quincy, Illinois.    On reaching Keetsville I stopped at the house of Colonel Price. The  Colonel hearing of my arrival, came directly into the house, and,  discovering who I was, said, \"Joseph and Hyrum Smith and the other  prisoners have escaped.\"    I enquired what he knew about them, and he answered, \"Their guard took  breakfast here this morning. They have turned back, saying they were  going back to Richmond, by way of Tenney's grove. I know that the  guards have been bribed, or they would evince more interest in pursuing  them.\"    After we had partaken of refreshments, Brother Roundy and I pursued  our course towards Quincy about fourteen or fifteen miles, when, being  thoroughly satisfied that the prisoners had escaped, we turned back  towards Far West.    When we arrived at Tenney's grove, a man came to me and presented an  order drawn on me, by Joseph Smith, for five hundred dollars, saying it  was for horses furnished him. I immediately raised four hundred dollars  and paid him, when he proceeded to Richmond, Ray County, where he paid  out the money to secure some of the lands that we had been driven from.    Brother Roundy and I started a few hours afterwards for Richmond, being  on our way to Far West, for the purpose of visiting Parley P. Pratt and  others in jail.    On our arrival at Richmond, I went directly to the prison to see  Parley, but was prohibited by the guard, who said they would blow my  brains out if I attempted to go near him. In a few minutes, Sister  Morris Phelps came to me in great agitation and advised me to leave  forthwith, as Brother Pratt had told her that a large body of men had  assembled with tar, feathers and a rail, who swore they would tar and  feather me, and ride me on the rail. They suspected I was the one who  had assisted Joseph and the other prisoners to escape.    I immediately informed Brother Roundy, and we jumped on our horses and  fled towards Far West, which was forty miles distant. We rode all night  and reached Far West about the break of day. Expecting Brother Brigham  Young and the Twelve to arrive there that day, I kept myself concealed  in the woods, and passed around the country notifying the brethren and  sisters to be on hand at the appointed time to witness the work upon  the temple.    On the night of April 25th, which was pleasant, clear and moonlight,  Elders Brigham Young, Orson Pratt, John E. Page, John Taylor, Wilford  Woodruff, George A. Smith and Alphens Cutler arrived from Quincy,  Illinois, and rode into the public square early on the morning of the  26th. All seemed still as death.    We held a conference at the house of Brother Samuel Clark, cut off  thirty-one persons from the Church, and then proceeded to the building  spot of the Lord's house, where, after singing a hymn on the mission  of the Twelve, we recommenced laying the foundation, agreeable to the  revelation given July 8th, 1838, by rolling a stone, upwards of a ton  in weight, upon or near the south-east corner.    We ordained Wilford Woodruff and George A. Smith, who had been  previously nominated by the First Presidency, accepted by the Twelve,  and acknowledged by the Church at Quincy, members of the quorum of  the Twelve Apostles. We ordained as Seventies, Darwin Chase and  Norman Shearer, who had been liberated from Richmond prison two days  previously, where they had been confined about six months for the cause  of Christ.    The Twelve then, individually called upon the Lord in prayer in the  following order: Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Orson Pratt, John  E. Page, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff and George A. Smith, kneeling  on the corner stone; after which \"Adam-ondi-Ahman\" was sung, when the  Twelve took leave of the Saints, agreeable to the revelation.    The brethren wandered among our deserted houses, many of which were in  ruins, and saw the streets in many places grown over with grass.    We went to Father Clark's, got breakfast, and before sunrise we  departed. We rode thirty miles that day, and camped at night with the  families of Elders Clark and Turley.    On arriving at Quincy on the 2nd of May, I found my family well and  in good spirits; and on reading the words of inspiration which I had  written, my wife bore record to the truth of that part which says,  \"Trouble not thyself about thy family, for they are in my hands. I  will feed them and clothe them and make unto them friends,\" etc. I  learned from her that my family continued with Brother Brigham until  they crossed the Mississippi to the town of Atlas, in Illinois, where,  through the instrumentality of George Pitkin, my wife got introduced to  a Widow Ross, who let her have a comfortably-fitted-up room, and the  privilege of cooking by her fire, and who was as kind to her as an own  mother or sister. Here my wife tarried seven weeks, and only had to pay  fifty cents a week. At the end of that time, John P. Greene came with  his wagon and horses and carried my family up to Quincy, forty miles,  and rented a good room where I found her.    She had had no lack of friends and had every comfort bestowed upon  her that she could have had among her own kindred; and I can say in  my heart, God bless all who aided and assisted my family. Jesus says  every man shall be rewarded for every good deed that he doeth and even  if a man giveth a cup of cold water to a disciple he shall receive a  disciple's reward.    In relation to that part of the Lord's word to me which said I should  have many sons and daughters, my wife was rather in doubt, as she  considered she was too advanced in years, and the thought had never  entered our minds that the Lord would establish in this Church the  doctrine of plurality of wives in my day; still I believed it would be  restored to the earth in some future time.

Whilst we do not  overlook the greater increase of crimes against the person in  England (coinciding, of course, with the doubling of the  population in fifty-five years), this fact seems to me to prove  the salutary influence of English organisations against certain  social factors which lead up to delinquency (such as the care of  <p 73>foundlings, the guardianship of the poor, and so forth),  notwithstanding the great development of economic activity, which  is assuredly in no way inferior to that of France.  The figures  strengthen my conclusions as to the social factors of crime, and  refute the optimistic theory of Poletti.    But the actual participation of each country in the general  increase of crime in Europe is determined by other causes, outside  of the artificial influences of different codes of law.  And the  most general and constant of these causes, in all the various  physical and social environments, is the annual increase of  population, which, by adding to the density of the inhabitants of  each country, multiplies their material and legal relations to one  another, and, consequently, the objective and subjective  constituents of crime.    Taking the official Italian figures, which are also relied on by  M. Levasseur, we find, for the periods corresponding to the  variations of criminality, the following rates of increase in the  population of the different countries.  Ireland shows a decrease,  owing to emigration.                                                Increase.  Italy   22,104,789 in 1863--30,947,306 in 1889  40 per cent.   ''     27,165,553 in 1873--30,565,188 in 1888  12  ''  France  31,858,937 in 1826--38,218,903 in 1887  20 per cent.  Belgium  4,072,619 in 1840-- 5,583,278 in 1885  44  ''  Prussia 21,046,984 in 1852--26,614,428 in 1878  26  ''  Germany 45,717,000 in 1882--47,540,000 in 1887  4   ''  England 13,896,797 in 1831--27,870,586 in 1886  101 ''   ''     20,066,224 in 1861--27,870,586 in 1886  39  ''  Austria 20,217,531 in 1869--23,070,688 in 1886  14  ''  Ireland  5,798,967 in 1861-- 4,777,545 in 1888 dec.  17 ''      It must, however, be observed, with regard to this increase of the  population, firstly that it tells as a factor <p 74>of criminality  only in so far as it is not neutralised, wholly or in part, by  other influences, mainly social, which prevent crime or render it  less grave.  Secondly, it is not right merely to compare the  proportional rates of increase in the population with those of  crime, as was done for instance by M. Bodio, who said that in  Italy, from 1873 to 1883, ``since the population had increased by  7.5 per cent., crime might have increased during the same time by  7.5 per cent., without its being fair to say that it had actually  increased.''  In point of fact, as M. Rossi remarked, since in  Italy, and almost all the European States, the growth of the  population is due to the excess of births over deaths (for  emigration is more numerous than immigration), it is evident that,  when we confine our attention to short periods, the addition to  the population, consisting of children under ten or twelve years,  does not increase crime in an appreciable degree.  The deaths, on  the other hand, must be subtracted from all stages of human life,  but especially from the number of those who can and do commit  crimes and offences.    Now, as we cannot in this place go into detail, I must confine  myself to the statement of a few characteristic facts, as  illustrated by European crime.  Thus we perceive the influence of  the great famine of 1846-7 on crimes against property in France  and Belgium; the rapid oscillations of crime in Ireland,  indicating the unstable political and social conditions of the  country; and the parallel movements of crime in, France and  Prussia.  We see, indeed, a constant diminution of crime for the  period between 1860 and <p 75>1870, followed (after the  statistical disturbance of the terrible year 1870-1) by a period  of serious and continued increase of crime, resulting from social  and economic conditions, as shown especially by the increase of  vagrancy and theft since 1875.    All these general facts go to prove the close and intimate  connection between crime and the aggregate of its various  constituents.  So that, without pursuing more detailed inquiries  into certain social factors of crime, which are capable of  statistical enumeration, such as the increase in the number of the  police, the abundance or scarcity of corn and wine, the spread of  drunkenness, family circumstances, increase of personal  possessions, the facility or otherwise of the settlement of  disputes, commercial and industrial crises, the rate of wages, the  variation from year to year of the general conditions of  existence, and so forth, coincident with the development of  education, encouragements to thrift and the organisation of  charity, we must now proceed to draw from these statistical data  the most important conclusions of criminal sociology.      <p 76>  I.      Criminal statistics show that crime increases in the aggregate,  with more or less notable oscillations from year to year, rising  or falling in successive waves.  Thus it is evident that the level  of criminality in any one year is determined by the different  conditions of the physical and social environment, combined with  the hereditary tendencies and occasional impulses of the  individual, in obedience to a law which I have called, in analogy  with chemical phenomena, _the law of criminal saturation_.    Just as in a given volume of water, at a given temperature, we  find a solution of a fixed quantity of any chemical substance, not  an atom more or less, so in a given social environment, in certain  defined physical conditions of the individual, we find the  commission of a fixed number of crimes.    Our ignorance of many physical and psychical laws and of  innumerable conditions of fact, will prevent us from obtaining a  precise view of this level of criminality.  But none the less is  it the necessary and inevitable result of a given physical and  social environment.  Statistics show us, indeed, that the  variations of this environment are always attended by  consequential and proportional variations of crime.  In France,  for instance (and the observation will be found to apply to every  country which possesses an extended series of criminal  statistics), the number of crimes against the person varies but  little in sixty-two years.  The same thing holds good for England  and Belgium, because their special environment is also less  variable, <p 77>by reason that hereditary dispositions and human  passions cannot vary profoundly or frequently, except under the  influence of exceptional disturbances of the weather, or of social  conditions.  In fact, the more serious variations in respect of  crimes against the person in France have taken place either during  political revolutions, or in years of excessive heat, or of  exceptional abundance of meat, grain, and wine.  This is  illustrated by the exceptional increase of crime from 1849 to  1852.  Minor offences against the person, on the contrary, which  are more occasional, assaults and wounding, for example, vary in  the main, as to their annual oscillations, with the abundance of  the wine harvest, whilst in their oscillations from month to month  they display a characteristic increase during the vintage periods,  from June to December, notwithstanding the constant diminution of  other offences and crimes against the person.    On the other hand, crimes against property, and still more  offences against property, show wide oscillations on account of  the variability of the special environment, which is almost always  in a condition of unstable equilibrium, as in periods of scarcity,  and of commercial, financial and industrial crises, and so forth,  whilst they are subject also to the influence of the physical  environment.  Crimes and offences against property display  extraordinary increases in the severest winter seasons, and  diminutions in milder winters.    And this correspondence between the more general, powerful, and  variable physical and social factors of <p 78>crime, as well as  its more characteristic manifestations such as thefts, wounding,  and indecent assaults, is so constant and so direct that, when I  was studying the annual movement of criminality in France, and  perceived some extraordinary oscillation in the crimes and  offences, I foresaw that in the annals of the year I should find  mention of an agricultural or political crisis, or an exceptional  winter or summer in the records of the weather.  So that with a  single column of a table of criminal statistics I was able to  reconstruct the historical condition of a country in its more  salient features.  In this way psychological experiment again  confirmed the truth of the law of criminal saturation.    Not only so, but it may be added that as, in chemistry, over and  above the normal saturation we find that an increased temperature  of the liquid envelopes an exceptional super-saturation, so in  criminal sociology, in addition to the ordinary saturation we are  sometimes aware of an excess of criminal saturation, due to the  exceptional conditions of the social environment.    Indeed it is to be observed not only that the main and typical  criminality has a sort of reflex criminality depending upon it,  but also that an increase of more serious or more frequent crimes  induces a crop of resistance to and assaults upon the guardians of  public order, together with false witness, insults, avoidance of  supervision, absconding, and the like.  Certain crimes and  offences also have their complementary offences, which from being  consequences become in their turn the causes of new offences.  Thus concealment and <p 79>purchase of stolen goods increase  simultaneously with theft; homicide and wounding"]]]
