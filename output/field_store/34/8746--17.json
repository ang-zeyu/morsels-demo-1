But he  shivered, and the wind whistled through his rags.    \"You wait a minute,\" said Betsey, and was off across the field.    Jimmy Scarecrow stood in the corn-stubble, with the doll-baby under his  coat and waited, and soon Betsey was back again with Aunt Hannah's crazy  quilt trailing in the snow behind her.    \"Here,\" said she, \"here is something to keep you warm,\" and she folded  the crazy quilt around the Scarecrow and pinned it.    \"Aunt Hannah wants to give it away if anybody wants it,\" she explained.  \"She's got so many crazy quilts in the house now she doesn't know what  to do with them. Good-bye--be sure you keep the doll-baby covered up.\"  And with that she ran cross the field, and left Jimmy Scarecrow alone  with the crazy quilt and the doll-baby.    The bright flash of colours under Jimmy's hat-brim dazzled his eyes,  and he felt a little alarmed. \"I hope this quilt is harmless if it IS  crazy,\" he said. But the quilt was warm, and he dismissed his fears.  Soon the doll-baby whimpered, but he creaked his joints a little, and  that amused it, and he heard it cooing inside his coat.    Jimmy Scarecrow had never felt so happy in his life as he did for an  hour or so. But after that the snow began to turn to rain, and the crazy  quilt was soaked through and through: and not only that, but his coat  and the poor doll-baby. It cried pitifully for a while, and then it was  still, and he was afraid it was dead.    It grew very dark, and the rain fell in sheets, the snow melted, and  Jimmy Scarecrow stood halfway up his old boots in water. He was saying  to himself that the saddest hour of his life had come, when suddenly he  again heard Santa Claus' sleigh-bells and his merry voice talking to  his reindeer. It was after midnight, Christmas was over, and Santa was  hastening home to the North Pole.    \"Santa Claus! dear Santa Claus!\" cried Jimmy Scarecrow with a great sob,  and that time Santa Claus heard him and drew rein.    \"Who's there?\" he shouted out of the darkness.    \"It's only me,\" replied the Scarecrow.    \"Who's me?\" shouted Santa Claus.    \"Jimmy Scarecrow!\"    Santa got out of his sledge and waded up. \"Have you been standing here  ever since corn was ripe?\" he asked pityingly, and Jimmy replied that he  had.    \"What's that over your shoulders?\" Santa Claus continued, holding up his  lantern.    \"It's a crazy quilt.\"    \"And what are you holding under your coat?\"    \"The doll-baby that Betsey gave me, and I'm afraid it's dead,\" poor  Jimmy Scarecrow sobbed.    \"Nonsense!\" cried Santa Claus. \"Let me see it!\" And with that he pulled  the doll-baby out from under the Scarecrow's coat, and patted its back,  and shook it a little, and it began to cry, and then to crow. \"It's all  right,\" said Santa Claus. \"This is the doll-baby I gave Betsey, and  it is not at all delicate. It went through the measles, and the  chicken-pox, and the mumps, and the whooping-cough, before it left the  North Pole. Now get into the sledge, Jimmy Scarecrow, and bring the  doll-baby and the crazy quilt. I have never had any quilts that weren't  in their right minds at the North Pole, but maybe I can cure this one.  Get in!\" Santa chirruped to his reindeer, and they drew the sledge up  close in a beautiful curve.    \"Get in, Jimmy Scarecrow, and come with me to the North Pole!\" he cried.    \"Please, how long shall I stay?\" asked Jimmy Scarecrow.    \"Why, you are going to live with me,\" replied Santa Claus. \"I've been  looking for a person like you for a long time.\"    \"Are there any crows to scare away at the North Pole? I want to be  useful,\" Jimmy Scarecrow said, anxiously.    \"No,\" answered Santa Claus, \"but I don't want you to scare away crows.  I want you to scare away Arctic Explorers. I can keep you in work for a  thousand years, and scaring away Arctic Explorers from the North Pole  is much more important than scaring away crows from corn. Why, if they  found the Pole, there wouldn't be a piece an inch long left in a week's  time, and the earth would cave in like an apple without a core! They  would whittle it all to pieces, and carry it away in their pockets for  souvenirs. Come along; I am in a hurry.\"    \"I will go on two conditions,\" said Jimmy. \"First, I want to make a  present to Aunt Hannah and Betsey, next Christmas.\"    \"You shall make them any present you choose. What else?\"    \"I want some way provided to scare the crows out of the corn next  summer, while I am away,\" said Jimmy.    \"That is easily managed,\" said Santa Claus. \"Just wait a minute.\"    Santa took his stylographic pen out of his pocket, went with his lantern  close to one of the fence-posts, and wrote these words upon it:         NOTICE TO CROWS    Whichever crow shall hereafter hop, fly, or flop into this field  during the absence of Jimmy Scarecrow, and therefrom purloin, steal, or  abstract corn, shall be instantly, in a twinkling and a trice, turned  snow-white, and be ever after a disgrace, a byword and a reproach to his  whole race.                  Per order of Santa Claus.    \"The corn will be safe now,\" said Santa Claus, \"get in.\" Jimmy got into  the sledge and they flew away over the fields, out of sight, with merry  halloos and a great clamour of bells.    The next morning there was much surprise at the farmhouse, when Aunt  Hannah and Betsey looked out of the window and the Scarecrow was not in  the field holding out his stiff arms over the corn stubble. Betsey had  told Aunt Hannah she had given away the crazy quilt and the doll-baby,  but had been scolded very little.    \"You must not give away anything of yours again without asking  permission,\" said Aunt Hannah. \"And you have no right to give anything  of mine, even if you know I don't want it. Now both my pretty quilt and  your beautiful doll-baby are spoiled.\"    That was all Aunt Hannah had said. She thought she would send John after  the quilt and the doll-baby next morning as soon as it was light.    But Jimmy Scarecrow was gone, and the crazy quilt and the doll-baby with  him. John, the servant-man, searched everywhere, but not a trace of them  could he find. \"They must have all blown away, mum,\" he said to Aunt  Hannah.    \"We shall have to have another scarecrow next summer,\" said she.    But the next summer there was no need of a scarecrow, for not a crow  came past the fence-post on which Santa Claus had written his notice to  crows. The cornfield was never so beautiful, and not a single grain was  stolen by a crow, and everybody wondered at it, for they could not read  the crow-language in which Santa had written.    \"It is a great mystery to me why the crows don't come into our  cornfield, when there is no scarecrow,\" said Aunt Hannah.    But she had a still greater mystery to solve when Christmas came round  again. Then she and Betsey had each a strange present. They found them  in the sitting-room on Christmas morning. Aunt Hannah's present was her  old crazy quilt, remodelled, with every piece cut square and true, and  matched exactly to its neighbour.    \"Why, it's my old crazy quilt, but it isn't crazy now!\" cried Aunt  Hannah, and her very spectacles seemed to glisten with amazement.    Betsey's present was her doll-baby of the Christmas before; but the  doll was a year older. She had grown an inch, and could walk and say,  \"mamma,\" and \"how do?\" She was changed a good deal, but Betsey knew her  at once. \"It's my doll-baby!\" she cried, and snatched her up and kissed  her.    But neither Aunt Hannah nor Betsey ever knew that the quilt and the doll  were Jimmy Scarecrow's Christmas presents to them.          XII. WHY THE CHIMES RANG*    * Copyright, 1906. Used by special permission of the publishers, the  Bobbs-Merrill Company.    RAYMOND MC ALDEN    There was once in a faraway country where few people have ever  travelled, a wonderful church. It stood on a high hill in the midst of a  great city; and every Sunday, as well as on sacred days like Christmas,  thousands of people climbed the hill to its great archways, looking like  lines of ants all moving in the same direction.    When you came to the building itself, you found stone columns and dark  passages, and a grand entrance leading to the main room of the church.  This room was so long that one standing at the doorway could scarcely  see to the other end, where the choir stood by the marble altar. In  the farthest corner was the organ; and this organ was so loud, that  sometimes when it played, the people for miles around would close their  shutters and prepare for a great thunderstorm. Altogether, no such  church as this was ever seen before, especially when it was lighted  up for some festival, and crowded with people, young and old. But the  strangest thing about the whole building was the wonderful chime of  bells.    At one corner of the church was a great gray tower, with ivy growing  over it as far up as one could see. I say as far as one could see,  because the tower was quite great enough to fit the great church, and it  rose so far into the sky that it was only in very fair weather that  any one claimed to be able to see the top. Even then one could not be  certain that it was in sight. Up, and up, and up climbed the stones and  the ivy; and as the men who built the church had been dead for hundreds  of years, every one had forgotten how high the tower was supposed to be.    Now all the people knew that at the top of the tower was a chime of  Christmas bells. They had hung there ever since the church had been  built, and were the most beautiful bells in the world. Some thought it  was because a great musician had cast them and arranged them in their  place; others said it was because of the great height, which reached up  where the air was clearest and purest; however that might be no one  who had ever heard the chimes denied that they were the sweetest in the  world. Some described them as sounding like angels far up in the sky;  others as sounding like strange"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50661"],[0,"Dave Dawson at Singapore (#15)"],[1,"scar faced Serrangi took  it hook, line and sinker. After all, Freddy, that bird has to play a  very slick game or his name will be mud in nothing flat. I.... Darn  it, Freddy, I have a feeling that the test isn't over by any manner or  means.\"    \"You mean Serrangi is passing us along to this Agiz Ammarir for his  inspection and approval?\" Freddy suggested.    Dave hunched his shoulders and made a clucking sound with his tongue.    \"Could be,\" he said. \"Something like that, I think. There's one thing,  and it's this. Serrangi is pretty much burned up about not getting  action on something big. Something that has to do with a mysterious  plane flight to the north. And does the guy mean a flight to Tokio, I  wonder? Anyway, he wasn't play acting at the last. He was plenty sore.  And, brother, I wouldn't want any guy like that to get sore at me.  Slicing your ears and nose off would be just a warm-up for his type.  And there's another thing that struck me as queer, too.\"    \"Such as?\" Freddy Farmer encouraged when Dave lapsed into another spell  of brooding silence.    \"His not knowing anything of the details of this mysterious flight,\"  Dave murmured after a long pause. \"If he's the paid Nazi agent big  shot in this part of the world, you'd think he'd know everything about  what's planned as well as what's taking place. Don't you figure it that  way, too?\"    \"Yes, I guess I do,\" Freddy Farmer replied slowly. \"But I got the  impression, Dave, that this flight to the north in a plane is not  all Nazi. I have a very good feeling there's more Tokio to it than  Berlin. And, by the way, you carried off that secret work in Australia  top-hole, Dave, old fellow.\"    \"Thanks, and I sure hope so,\" Dave said in a fervent voice. \"But I hope  this Agiz Ammarir doesn't get too curious about it. And.... Holy smoke!\"    \"What, Dave?\" Freddy gasped in alarm as Dawson stopped short and gulped.    \"Wouldn't it be just too, too ducky if that's what Serrangi is checking  up!\" Dave groaned. \"Supposing this Ammarir knows all about Nazi work  in Australia, and is going to pass on us for Scar Face! Freddy, don't  look right now, but I think you and I are walking the rim of a volcano  that's liable to ring the gong on us at any moment. Yeah! I don't think  I ever wanted to see tomorrow's sun as much as I do tonight. But....  Oh, what the heck! A fellow can't live forever, so why worry?\"    \"You mean by that that we should of course carry on, don't you?\" Freddy  asked.    \"Heck, yes!\" Dawson snorted. \"It's a mess all around, but there's only  one thing to be done about it. Stay in there and keep pitching. To use  that Nazi boast I pulled on Serrangi, we're not dead men, yet. But it  certainly would have helped a lot if Bostworth had known just what he  was shooting at. After all, he just about gave us zero-minus to work  on. True, the Devil's Den tip looks like it might get us some results.  But that's just the idea. What _kind_ of results?\"    \"Quite,\" Freddy murmured. Then as though in justified defense of one  of his countrymen, he said, \"If Bostworth had known a lot, Dave, he  wouldn't have needed us at all. I really take it as an honor that he  selected us to help him in this mess.\"    \"Oh, sure, sure, me too,\" Dave hastened to soothe his friend's  feelings. \"Don't mind me. You should know me better than that. I'm just  the beefing kind. Heck! I wouldn't quit now even if Air Vice Marshal  Bostworth should suddenly pop out of one of these shacks and order me  off the job. And you know it, pal. So stop ribbing me.\"    \"Then use that big mouth for talking sense only,\" the English youth  growled. Then after giving Dave's arm a quick squeeze of friendship,  he said, \"I think there's one thing we should do, Dave. I've got a  feeling. Sort of one of your famous hunches, you might say.\"    \"Let's have it, my little man,\" Dave said. \"I'm all ears.\"    \"Yes, I know, and big ones at that,\" Freddy Farmer came right back at  him. \"Seriously speaking, though, Dave. If we're to pose as a couple  of Nazi agents, let's try to actually feel that we are. I mean, when  you do a thing by halfway measures you sometimes bump into more trouble  than if you made no effort at all to act a part.\"    \"Okay, by me, Herr Fritz von Farmer,\" Dave whispered with a chuckle as  they reached the first of the cross streets. \"From here in we're more  German than old Uncle Goering.\"    \"I mean it, Dave!\" Freddy said grimly. \"We don't know what kind of a  trap we're walking into. One slip of the tongue, when either of us is  not thinking, and it might be curtains for both of us. _Think_ that  you're a German, Dave. Make yourself _feel_ it! I can't put it into  words, but.... Well, blast it, I simply sort of sense something in the  air. Like a coming storm, or something.\"    \"Okay!\" Dave said gently. \"I'll be as dumb as any Hun you ever saw, my  boy. But lay off this hunch stuff. That's my racket, pal!\"    Freddy didn't make any reply to that crack and the two youths walked  along Bukum Street in silence. Every now and then a native or two  glided past, and every so often they passed an open shop out of which  poured the babble of high keyed voices. As they neared the corner of  the second street on which they would find Agiz Ammarir's rug shop the  lights became less and less until they were walking along in more or  less murky darkness.    And when they were but fifty yards from the single electric lighted  sign of the rug merchant ... it happened!    Dave sensed rather than saw movement on Freddy's right. But he did hear  the sound of swift movement, and as he automatically half spun and  grabbed for his friend he saw the dull gleam of a long bladed knife  that seemed to hang poised directly over the English youth's head.    A wild cry of alarm rose up to Dave's lips, but for some reason he  didn't spill it off. Perhaps it was because by then he was in the  middle of wild furious action. In what was really one continuous  movement he thrust one hand against Freddy's shoulder, kicked out a  foot to trip his friend and send him spilling to the sidewalk, and  lashed out blindly with his other clenched fist. White pain streaking  from his knuckles clear up to his shoulder socket gave him the wild  satisfaction of knowing he had hit human bone and flesh.    Then in the next instant he had leaped over Freddy's squirming body  on the sidewalk and was slamming out with both fists, and connecting  with a shadowy figure that screamed with alarm and pain. That there  was still a knife some place didn't even occur to Dave. That his pal,  Freddy Farmer, had come within a few short inches of being killed was  the one and only thing uppermost in his mind. And for that reason alone  he fought with the fury of a cornered jungle tiger.    But it was all over almost as soon as it had started. Dave was in the  act of closing his fingers about a greasy wrist when the shadowy figure  let out one last cry of pain and virtually vanished away in thin air.  Hardly realizing what he was doing, Dave bent over, scooped up a steel  bladed knife that lay at his feet on the sidewalk, and hurled it after  the shadow in the darkness. And, then suddenly, as he stood there  trembling with rage, he realized that his lips were spitting curses  at the fleeing shadow in perfect Hamburg German. The realization was  so startling that he cut himself off in the middle of a word and stood  motionless. Reaction took that moment to set in and he began trembling  like a leaf. He was unable to stop himself until Freddy Farmer managed  to scramble up and grip him hard on the arm.    \"Are you all right?\" Freddy Farmer muttered in German.    \"Fit as can be,\" Dave grunted and gave a little shake of his head. \"Did  you hear me, Freddy. Boy! Was I pouring out the old German, and not  even realizing it. Talk about taking you at your word!\"    \"As you would say, they don't make them any more perfect than you,\"  Freddy whispered and pressed Dave's arm again. \"I fancy that's about  the umpteenth time you've saved my life since we first met.\"    \"Nuts!\" Dave growled good naturedly. \"Save _your_ life? Where do you  get that stuff? I let fly because I thought the guy's knife was headed  for _my_ throat. A fine lot of money that hold-up lug would have found  on us, huh?\"    \"_If_ he was looking for money!\" Freddy Farmer grunted and scowled  around at the darkness. \"It could be for a very different reason, you  know.\"    \"Nuts again!\" Dave snapped. \"You're cutting out paper dolls, Freddy.  Serrangi, you mean? He wouldn't have waited this long, pal. Forget it!  That lad was just hoping to pick up a little small change. The knife  was just to help him do it quicker. Come on, let's get going. Maybe  he's got a pal hanging around. I'm just One Punch Dawson, you know.  Next time I'd probably be the one that got clouted. Come on.\"    Freddy Farmer mumbled something and dropped into step. They walked the  last fifty yards a little faster and finally came to a halt before Agiz  Ammarir's door. There was light inside but the glass was so dirty and  covered with rugs hung up for display they couldn't see inside. Dave  hesitated, took a deep breath, swallowed hard, and jerked the bell  cord. The echo of a pleasing tingling came to them through the door.  Presently a shadow appeared on the other side, and a moment later the  door was pulled open.    Dave opened his mouth to speak to the girl, but not a sound left his  lips because it was not a native girl who stood holding the door open.  It was Serrangi, instead, and Dave's eyes bugged out as he and Freddy  Farmer both stared in speechless amazement.          CHAPTER ELEVEN    _Flight to the North_      \"Serrangi!\" Dave finally gulped out. \"_Mein Gott!_ What kind of trick  is this you play?\"    The owner of the Devil's Den smiled crookedly, opened the door wider  and nodded them in.    \"Come inside, my friends,\" he said. \"It is sometimes necessary to be  more than one person.
