For with form enters the motor factor,  which cannot be separated from the motor innervations of the  whole body.  It is possible, however, to abstract for the moment  from the form as a unit, and to consider here only what may be  called the quality of line.  A line may be straight or broken,  and if curved, curving continuously or brokenly, etc.  That  this quality of line is distinct from form may be shown by the  simple experiment of turning a spiral--a logarithmic spiral,  let us say--in different ways about its focus.  The aesthetic  effect of the figure is absolutely different in the different  positions, and yet the feeling about the character of the line  itself seems to remain the same.  In what sense, and for what  reasons, does this curved line satisfy the demands of the eye?  The discussion of this question precipitates us at once into  one of the burning controversies of aesthetics, which may  perhaps best be dealt with at this point.    An early answer to the question would have been, that the eye  is so hung in its muscles as to move most easily in curved  lines, and this easy action in following the curve is felt as  favorable stimulation.  But recent experiment<1> has shown  that the eye in fact moves by most irregular, angular leaps  from point to point of the figure.  The theory is therefore  remodeled by substituting for the movement sensations of the  eye, the tendencies corresponding to those early movements of  touching imitative of the form, by which we learned to know a  form for what it is, and the reproduction of feeling-tones  belonging to the character of such movement.  The movements  of touching and feeling for a smooth continuous curved object  are themselves pleasant.  This complex of psychical factors  makes a pleasurably stimulating experience.  The greater the  tendency to complete reproduction of these movements, that is,  the stronger the \"bodily resonance,\" the more vivid the pleasure.  Whether we (with Groos) designate this as sympathetic reproduction,  or (with Lipps) attribute to the figure the movements and the  feelings which resound in us after this fashion, or even (with  Witasek) insist on the purely ideal character of the reproduction,  seems to me not essential to the explanation of the pleasing  character of the experience, and hence of the beauty of the  object.  Not THAT we sympathetically reproduce (\"Miterleben\"),  or \"feel ourselves into\" a form (\"Einfuhlen\"), but HOW we do so,  is the question.    <1> G.M. Stratton, _Philos. Studies_, xx.    All that Hogarth says of the beauty of the serpentine line, as  \"leading the eye a kind of chase,\" is fully in harmony with this  view, if we add to the exploiting movements of the eyes those  other more important motor innervations of the body.  But we  should still have to ask, WHAT kind of chase?  Sharp, broken,  starting lines might be the basis of a much more vivid experience,  --but it would be aesthetically negative.  \"The complete sensuous  experience of the spatial\" is not enough, unless that experience  is positively, that is, favorably toned.  Clear or vivid seeing  made possible by the form of the object is not enough.  Only as  FAVORABLY stimulating, that is, only as calling up ideal  reproductions, or physical imitations, of movements which in  themselves were suited to the functions of the organs involved,  can forms be found positively aesthetic, that is, beautiful.    Moreover, we have to note here, and to emphasize, that the  organs involved are more than the eye, as has already been made  plain.  We cannot separate eye innvervations from bodily  innervations in general.  And therefore \"the demands of the eye\"  can never alone decide the question of the beauty of visual  form.  If it were not so, the favorable stimulation combined  with repose of the eye would alone make the conditions of  beauty.  The \"demands of the eye\" must be interpreted as the  demands of the eye plus the demands of the motor system,--the  whole psychophysical personality, in short.    It is in these two principles,--\"bodily resonance,\" and favorable  as opposed to energetic functioning,--and these alone, that we  have a complete refutation of the claim made by many artists  to-day, that the phrase \"demands of the eye\" embodies a complete  aesthetic theory.  The sculptor Adolph Hildebrand, in his  \"Problem of Form in the Plastic Art\" first set it forth as the  task of the artist \"to find a form which appears to have arisen  only from the demands of the eye;\"<1> and this doctrine is  to-day so widely held, that it must here be considered at some  length.    <1> _Das Proablem der form in d. bildenden Kunst_, 1897.    It is the space-form, all that is seen, and not the object itself,  that is the object of vision.  Now in viewing a plastic object  near at hand, the focus of the eye must be constantly changed  between the nearer and further points.  In a more distant view,  on the other hand (Hildebrand's \"Fernbild\"), the contour is  denoted by differences of light and shadow, but it is nevertheless  perceived in a single act of accommodation.  Moreover, being  distant, the muscles of accommodation are relaxed; the eye acts  at rest.  The \"Fernbild\" thus gives the only unified picture of  the three-dimensional complex, and hence the only unity of space-  values.  In the perception of this unity, the author holds,  consists the essential pleasure which the work of art gives us.  Hildebrand's treatment is difficult, and lends itself to varying  interpretations, which have laid stress now on unity as the  essential of art,<1> now on \"the joy in the complete sensuous  experience of the spatial.\"<2>  The latter seems in harmony with  the passage in which Hildebrand says \"all pleasure in Form is  pleasure in our not being obliged to create this clearness for  ourselves, in its being created for us, nay, even forced upon  us, by the form itself.\"    <1> A. Riehl, _Vierteljahrschr. f. wissenensch. Philos._, xxi,  xxii.  <2> K. Groos, _Der Aesthetische Genuss_, 1902, p. 17.    But supposing the first interpretation correct:  supposing  space-unity, conditioned by the unified and reposeful act of  seeing, to be the beauty we seek--it is at once clear that the  reduction of three dimensions to two does not constitute unity  even for the eye alone; how much less for the motor system of  the whole body, which we have seen must be involved.  Hildebrand's  \"demands of the eye\" resolves itself into the stimulation plus  repose of the ciliary muscle,--the organ of accommodation.  A  real unity even for the eye alone would have to include not  only space relations in the third dimension, but relations of  line and mass and color in the flat.  As for the \"complete  sensuous experience of the spatial\" (which would seem to be  equivalent to Berenson's \"tactile values\"), the \"clearness\" of  Hildebrand's sentence above quoted, it is evident that  completeness of the experience does not necessarily involve  the positive or pleasurable toning of the experience.  The  distinction is that between a beautiful and a completely  realistic picture.    A further extension or restatement of this theory, in a recent  article,<1> seems to me to express it in the most favorable  way.  Beauty is again connected with the functioning of our  organs of perception (Auffassungorgane).  \"We wish to be put  into a fresh, lively, energetic and yet at the same time  effortless activity....  The pleasure in form is a pleasure  in this, that the conformation of the object makes possible  or rather compels a natural purposeful functioning of our  apprehending organs.\"  But purposeful for what?  For visual  form, evidently to the end of seeing clearly.  The element of  repose, of unity, hinted at in the \"effortless\" of the first  sentence, disappears in the second.  The organs of apprehension  are evidently limited to the eye alone.  It is not the perfect  moment of stimulation and repose for the whole organism which  is aimed at, but the complete sensuous experience of the  spatial, again.    <1> Th. A. Meyer, \"Das Formprinzip des Schouen,\" _Archiv. f.  Phil._, Bd. x.    Hildebrand, to return to the more famous theorist, was writing  primarily of sculpture, and would naturally confine himself to  consideration of the plastic, which is an additional reason  against making this interesting brochure, as some have done,  the foundation of an aesthetics.  It is rather the foundation  of the sculptor's, perhaps even of the painter's technique,  with reference to plastic elements alone.  What it contains  of universal significance, the demand for space-unity, based  on the state of the eye in a union of rest and action, ignores  all but one of the possible sources of rest and action for  the eye, that of accommodation, and all the allied activities  completely.    On the basis of the favorable stimulations of all these  activities taken together, must we judge as pleasing the so-  called quality of line.  But it is clear that we cannot really  separate the question of quality of line from that of form,  figure, and arrangement in space.  The motor innervations  enter with the first, and the moment we have form at all, we  have space-composition also.  But space-composition means  unity, and unity is the objective quality which must be  translated, in our investigations, into aesthetic repose.  It  is thus with the study of composition that we pass from the  study of the elements as favorably stimulating, to the study  of the beauty of visual form.      V    We may begin by asking what, as a matter of fact, has been the  arrangement of spaces to give aesthetic pleasure.  The primitive  art of all nations shows that it has taken the direction of  symmetry about a vertical line.  It might be said that this is  the result of non-aesthetic influences, such as convenience of  construction, technique, etc.  <1>It is clear"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37512"],[0,"A Revision of Snakes of the Genus Conophis (Family Colubridae, from Middle (#15)"],[1,"                 text.

For example, where  the word Mexico was used in the body of the article, the more frequent  spelling (Mexico) was substituted. However, in the reference sections,  the spelling was not altered as that may have been the spelling used  by the article's author.

On page 279 under _Variation_ there appears to be a miscalculation:      668 mm. + 182 mm. = 850 mm. not 840 as in original text.
