In the broader sense of the term, however, America  has an abundance of deserts--regions which bear a thin cover of bushy  vegetation but are too dry for agriculture without irrigation. On the  north such deserts begin in southern Canada where a dry region abounding  in small salt lakes lies at the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains.  In the United States the deserts lie almost wholly between the Sierra  Nevada and the Rocky Mountain ranges, which keep out any moisture that  might come from either the west or the east. Beginning on the north with  the sagebrush plateau of southern Washington, the desert expands to a  width of seven hundred miles in the gray, sage-covered basins of Nevada  and Utah. In southern California and Arizona the sage-brush gives place  to smaller forms like the saltbush, and the desert assumes a sterner  aspect. Next comes the cactus desert extending from Arizona far south  into Mexico. One of the notable features of the desert is the extreme  heat of certain portions. Close to the Nevada border in southern  California, Death Valley, 250 feet below sea-level, is the hottest  place in America. There alone among the American regions familiar to the  writer does one have that feeling of intense, overpowering aridity which  prevails so often in the deserts of Arabia and Central Asia. Some  years ago a Weather Bureau thermometer was installed in Death Valley at  Furnace Creek, where the only flowing water in more than a hundred miles  supports a depressing little ranch. There one or two white men, helped  by a few Indians, raise alfalfa, which they sell at exorbitant prices to  deluded prospectors searching for riches which they never find. Though  the terrible heat ruins the health of the white men in a year or two,  so that they have to move away, they have succeeded in keeping  a thermometer record for some years. No other properly exposed,  out-of-door thermometer in the United States, or perhaps in the world,  is so familiar with a temperature of 100 degrees F. or more. During the  period of not quite fifteen hundred days from the spring of 1911 to May,  1915, a maximum temperature of 100 degrees F. or more was reached on  five hundred and forty-eight days, or more than one-third of the time.  On July 10, 1913, the mercury rose to 134 degrees F. and touched the top  of the tube. How much higher it might have gone no one can tell. That  day marks the limit of temperature yet reached in this country according  to official records. In the summer of 1914 there was one night when the  thermometer dropped only to 114 degrees F., having been 128 degrees  F. at noon. The branches of a peppertree whose roots had been freshly  watered wilted as a flower wilts when broken from the stalk.    East and south of Death Valley lies the most interesting section of the  American desert, the so-called succulent desert of southern Arizona and  northern Mexico. There in greatest profusion grow the cacti, perhaps the  latest and most highly specialized of all the great families of plants.  There occur such strange scenes as the \"forests\" of suhuaros, whose  giant columns have already been described. Their beautiful crowns of  large white flowers produce a fruit which is one of the mainstays of the  Papagos and other Indians of the regions. In this same region the yucca  is highly developed, and its tall stalks of white or greenish flowers  make the desert appear like a flower garden. In fact this whole  desert, thanks to light rains in summer as well as winter, appears  extraordinarily green and prosperous. Its fair appearance has deceived  many a poor settler who has vainly tried to cultivate it.    Farther south the deserts of America are largely confined to plateaus  like those of Mexico and Peru or to basins sheltered on all sides from  rain-bearing winds. In such basins the suddenness of the transition  from one type of vegetation to another is astonishing. In Guatemala,  for instance, the coast is bordered by thick jungle which quickly gives  place to magnificent rain forest a few miles inland. This continues  two or three score miles from the coast until a point is reached where  mountains begin to obstruct the rain-bearing trade-winds. At once the  rain forest gives place to jungle; in a few miles jungle in its turn  is replaced by scrub; and shortly the scrub degenerates to mere desert  bush. Then in another fifty miles one rises to the main plateau passing  once more through scrub. This time the scrub gives place to grass-lands  diversified by deciduous trees and pines which give the country a  distinctly temperate aspect. On such plateaus the chief civilization of  the tropical Latin-American countries now centers. In the past, however,  the plateaus were far surpassed by the Maya lowlands of Yucatan and  Guatemala.    We are wont to think of deserts as places where the plants are of few  kinds and not much crowded. As a matter of fact, an ordinary desert  supports a much greater variety of plants than does either a forest or  a prairie. The reason is simple. Every desert contains wet spots near  springs or in swamps. Such places abound with all sorts of water-loving  plants. The deserts also contain a few valleys where the larger streams  keep the ground moist at all seasons. In such places the variety of  trees is as great as in many forests. Moreover almost all deserts have  short periods of abundant moisture.    At such times the seeds of all sorts of little annual plants, including  grasses, daisies, lupines, and a host of others, sprout quickly, and  give rise to a carpet of vegetation as varied and beautiful as that of  the prairie. Thus the desert has not only its own peculiar bushes and  succulents but many of the products of vegetation in swamps, grasslands,  and forests. Though much of the ground is bare in the desert, the plants  are actually crowded together as closely as possible. The showers of  such regions are usually so brief that they merely wet the surface. At  a depth of a foot or more the soil of many deserts never becomes moist  from year's end to year's end. It is useless for plants to send their  roots deep down under such circumstances, for they might not reach water  for a hundred feet. Their only recourse is to spread horizontally. The  farther they spread, the more water they can absorb after the scanty  showers. Hence the plants of the desert throttle one another by  extending their roots horizontally, just as those of the forest kill one  another by springing rapidly upward and shutting out the light.    Vegetation, whether in forests, grasslands, or deserts, is the primary  source of human sustenance. Without it man would perish miserably; and  where it is deficient, he cannot rise to great heights in the scale of  civilization. Yet strangely enough the scantiness of the vegetation of  the deserts was a great help in the ascent of man. Only in dry regions  could primitive man compete with nature in fostering the right kind  of vegetation. In such regions arose the nations which first practised  agriculture. There man became comparatively civilized while his  contemporaries were still nomadic hunters in the grasslands and the  forests.        CHAPTER V. THE RED MAN IN AMERICA    When the white man first explored America, the parts of the continent  that had made most progress were by no means those that are most  advanced today. * None of the inhabitants, to be sure, had risen above  barbarism. Yet certain nations or tribes had advanced much higher  than others. There was a great contrast, for example, between the  well-organized barbarians of Peru and the almost completely unorganized  Athapascan savages near Hudson Bay.          * In the present chapter most of the facts as to the Indians  north of Mexico are taken from the admirable \"Handbook of American  Indians North of Mexico,\" edited by F. W. Hodge, Smithsonian  Institution, Bureau of Ethnology, Bulletin 30, Washington, 1907, two  volumes. In summing up the character and achievements of the Indians  I have drawn also on other sources, but have everywhere taken pains  to make no statements which are not abundantly supported by this  authoritative publication. In some cases I have not hesitated to  paraphrase considerable portions of its articles.      In the northern continent aboriginal America reached its highest  development in three typical environments. The first of these regions  centered in the valley of Mexico where dwelt the Aztecs, but it extended  as far north as the Pueblos in Arizona and New Mexico. The special  feature of the environment was the relatively dry, warm climate with the  chief rainfall in summer. The Indians living in this environment  were notable for their comparatively high social organization and for  religious ceremonials whose elaborateness has rarely been surpassed.  On the whole, the people of this summer rain or Mexican type were not  warlike and offered little resistance to European conquest. Some tribes,  to be sure, fought fiercely at first, but yielded within a few years;  the rest submitted to the lordly Spaniards almost without a murmur.  Their civilization, if such we may call it, had long ago seen its  best days. The period of energy and progress had passed, and a time of  inertia and decay had set in. A century after the Spaniards had  overcome the aborigines of Mexico, other Europeans--French, English,  and Dutch--came into contact with a sturdier type of red man, best  represented by the Iroquois or Five Nations of central New York.  This more active type dwelt in a physical environment notable for two  features--the abundance of cyclonic storms bringing rain or snow at all  seasons and the deciduous forest which thickly covered the whole  region. Unlike the Mexican, the civilization of the Iroquois was young,  vigorous, and growing.

'10th October.--Her Majesty's Government have received with great regret  the peremptory demands of the Government of the South African Republic,  conveyed in your telegram of the 9th October. You will inform the  Government of the South African Republic in reply that the conditions  demanded by the Government of the South African Republic are such as her  Majesty's Government deem it impossible to discuss.'    And so we have come to the end of the long road, past the battle of the  pens and the wrangling of tongues, to the arbitration of the Lee-Metford  and the Mauser. It was pitiable that it should come to this. These  people were as near akin to us as any race which is not our own. They  were of the same Frisian stock which peopled our own shores. In habit  of mind, in religion, in respect for law, they were as ourselves. Brave,  too, they were, and hospitable, with those sporting instincts which are  dear to the Anglo-Celtic race. There was no people in the world who had  more qualities which we might admire, and not the least of them was  that love of independence which it is our proudest boast that we have  encouraged in others as well as exercised ourselves. And yet we had come  to this pass, that there was no room in all vast South Africa for both  of us. We cannot hold ourselves blameless in the matter. 'The evil that  men do lives after them,' and it has been told in this small superficial  sketch where we have erred in the past in South Africa. On our hands,  too, is the Jameson raid, carried out by Englishmen and led by  officers who held the Queen's Commission; to us, also, the blame of the  shuffling, half-hearted inquiry into that most unjustifiable business.  These are matches which helped to set the great blaze alight, and it is  we who held them. But the fagots which proved to be so inflammable,  they were not of our setting. They were the wrongs done to half the  community, the settled resolution of the minority to tax and vex the  majority, the determination of a people who had lived two generations in  a country to claim that country entirely for themselves. Behind them all  there may have been the Dutch ambition to dominate South Africa. It  was no petty object for which Britain fought. When a nation struggles  uncomplainingly through months of disaster she may claim to have proved  her conviction of the justice and necessity of the struggle. Should  Dutch ideas or English ideas of government prevail throughout that huge  country? The one means freedom for a single race, the other means equal  rights to all white men beneath one common law. What each means to  the coloured races let history declare. This was the main issue to  be determined from the instant that the clock struck five upon the  afternoon of Wednesday, October the eleventh, eighteen hundred and  ninety-nine. That moment marked the opening of a war destined to  determine the fate of South Africa, to work great changes in the  British Empire, to seriously affect the future history of the world, and  incidentally to alter many of our views as to the art of war. It is the  story of this war which, with limited material but with much aspiration  to care and candour, I shall now endeavour to tell.        CHAPTER 5. TALANA HILL.    It was on the morning of October 12th, amid cold and mist, that the Boer  camps at Sandspruit and Volksrust broke up, and the burghers rode to the  war. Some twelve thousand of them, all mounted, with two batteries of  eight Krupp guns each, were the invading force from the north, which  hoped later to be joined by the Freestaters and by a contingent of  Germans and Transvaalers who were to cross the Free State border. It  was an hour before dawn that the guns started, and the riflemen followed  close behind the last limber, so that the first light of day fell upon  the black sinuous line winding down between the hills. A spectator upon  the occasion says of them: 'Their faces were a study. For the most part  the expression worn was one of determination and bulldog pertinacity.  No sign of fear there, nor of wavering. Whatever else may be laid to the  charge of the Boer, it may never truthfully be said that he is a coward  or a man unworthy of the Briton's steel.' The words were written early  in the campaign, and the whole empire will endorse them to-day. Could we  have such men as willing fellow-citizens, they are worth more than all  the gold mines of their country.    This main Transvaal body consisted of the commando of Pretoria, which  comprised 1800 men, and those of Heidelberg, Middelburg, Krugersdorp,  Standerton, Wakkerstroom, and Ermelo, with the State Artillery, an  excellent and highly organised body who were provided with the best guns  that have ever been brought on to a battlefield. Besides their sixteen  Krupps, they dragged with them two heavy six-inch Creusot guns, which  were destined to have a very important effect in the earlier part of the  campaign. In addition to these native forces there were a certain number  of European auxiliaries. The greater part of the German corps were with  the Free State forces, but a few hundred came down from the north. There  was a Hollander corps of about two hundred and fifty and an Irish--or  perhaps more properly an Irish-American-corps of the same number, who  rode under the green flag and the harp.    The men might, by all accounts, be divided into two very different  types. There were the town Boers, smartened and perhaps a little  enervated by prosperity and civilisation, men of business and  professional men, more alert and quicker than their rustic comrades.  These men spoke English rather than Dutch, and indeed there were many  men of English descent among them. But the others, the most formidable  both in their numbers and in their primitive qualities, were the  back-veld Boers, the sunburned, tangle-haired, full-bearded farmers, the  men of the Bible and the rifle, imbued with the traditions of their own  guerrilla warfare. These were perhaps the finest natural warriors upon  earth, marksmen, hunters, accustomed to hard fare and a harder couch.  They were rough in their ways and speech, but, in spite of many  calumnies and some few unpleasant truths, they might compare with most  disciplined armies in their humanity and their desire to observe the  usages of war.    A few words here as to the man who led this singular host. Piet Joubert  was a Cape Colonist by birth--a fellow countryman, like Kruger himself,  of those whom the narrow laws of his new country persisted in regarding  as outside the pale. He came from that French Huguenot blood which has  strengthened and refined every race which it has touched, and from it  he derived a chivalry and generosity which made him respected and liked  even by his opponents. In many native broils and in the British campaign  of 1881 he had shown himself a capable leader. His record in standing  out for the independence of the Transvaal was a very consistent one, for  he had not accepted office under the British, as Kruger had done, but  had remained always an irreconcilable. Tall and burly, with hard grey  eyes and a grim mouth half hidden by his bushy beard, he was a fine type  of the men whom he led. He was now in his sixty-fifth year, and the fire  of his youth had, as some of the burghers urged, died down within him;  but he was experienced, crafty, and warwise, never dashing and never  brilliant, but slow, steady, solid, and inexorable.    Besides this northern army there were two other bodies of burghers  converging upon Natal. One, consisting of the commandoes from Utrecht  and the Swaziland districts, had gathered at Vryheid on the flank of the  British position at Dundee. The other, much larger, not less probably  than six or seven thousand men, were the contingent from the Free State  and a Transvaal corps, together with Schiel's Germans, who were making  their way through the various passes, the Tintwa Pass, and Van Reenen's  Pass, which lead through the grim range of the Drakensberg and open out  upon the more fertile plains of Western Natal. The total force may have  been something between twenty and thirty thousand men. By all accounts  they were of an astonishingly high heart, convinced that a path of easy  victory lay before them, and that nothing could bar their way to the  sea. If the British commanders underrated their opponents, there is  ample evidence that the mistake was reciprocal.    A few words now as to the disposition of the British forces, concerning  which it must be borne in mind that Sir George White, though in  actual command, had only been a few days in the country before war was  declared, so that the arrangements fell to General Penn Symons, aided  or hampered by the advice of the local political authorities. The main  position was at Ladysmith, but an advance post was strongly held at  Glencoe, which is five miles from the station of Dundee and forty from  Ladysmith. The reason for this dangerous division of force was to secure  each end of the Biggarsberg section of the railway, and also to cover  the important collieries of that district. The positions chosen seem in  each case to show that the British commander was not aware of the number  and power of the Boer guns, for each was equally defensible against  rifle fire and vulnerable to an artillery attack. In the case of Glencoe  it was particularly evident that guns upon the hills above would, as  they did, render the position untenable. This outlying post was held  by the 1st Leicester Regiment, the 2nd Dublin Fusiliers, and the first  battalion of Rifles, with the 18th Hussars, three companies of mounted  infantry, and three batteries of field artillery, the 13th, 67th, and  69th. The 1st Royal Irish Fusiliers were on their way to reinforce  it, and arrived before the first action. Altogether the Glencoe camp  contained some four thousand men.    The main body of the"]]]
