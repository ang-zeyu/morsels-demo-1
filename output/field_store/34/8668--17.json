Hence the ape-like tricks that he would play me,  scrawling in my own hand blasphemies on the pages of my books,  burning the letters and destroying the portrait of my father; and  indeed, had it not been for his fear of death, he would long ago  have ruined himself in order to involve me in the ruin. But his  love of life is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken    107)    and freeze at the mere thought of him, when I recall the  abjection and passion of this attachment, and when I know how he  fears my power to cut him off by suicide, I find it in my heart  to pity him.    It is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this  description; no one has ever suffered such torments, let that  suffice; and yet even to these, habit brought--no, not  alleviation--but a certain callousness of soul, a certain  acquiescence of despair; and my punishment might have gone on for  years, but for the last calamity which has now fallen, and which  has finally severed me from my own face and nature. My provision  of the salt, which had never been renewed since the date of the  first experiment, began to run low. I sent out for a fresh  supply, and mixed the draught; the ebullition followed, and the  first change of colour, not the second; I drank it and it was  without efficiency. You will learn from Poole how I have had  London ransacked; it was in vain; and I am now persuaded that my  first supply was impure, and that it was that unknown impurity  which lent efficacy to the draught.    About a week has passed, and I am now finishing this statement  under the influence of the last of the old powders. This, then,  is the last time, short of a miracle, that Henry Jekyll can think  his own thoughts or see his own face (now how sadly altered!)  in the glass. Nor must I delay    108)    too long to bring my writing to an end; for if my narrative has  hitherto escaped destruction, it has been by a combination of  great prudence and great good luck. Should the throes of change  take me in the act of writing it, Hyde will tear it in pieces;  but if some time shall have elapsed after I have laid it by, his  wonderful selfishness and Circumscription to the moment will  probably save it once again from the action of his ape-like  spite. And indeed the doom that is closing on us both, has  already changed and crushed him. Half an hour from now, when I  shall again and for ever re-indue that hated personality, I know  how I shall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair, or continue,  with the most strained and fear-struck ecstasy of listening, to  pace up and down this room (my last earthly refuge) and give ear  to every sound of menace. Will Hyde die upon the scaffold? or  will he find courage to release himself at the last moment? God  knows; I am careless; this is my true hour of death, and what is  to follow concerns another than myself. Here then, as I lay down  the pen and proceed to seal up my confession, I bring the life of  that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/420"],[0,"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#15)"],[1,"  that will bring us on top of our world again, where we belong.  So, if  we had the wings, and could escape the Gargoyles, we might fly to that  rock and be saved.\"    \"I'll get you the wings,\" said Zeb, who had thoughtfully listened to  all this.  \"That is, if the kitten will show me where they are.\"    \"But how can you get down?\" enquired the girl, wonderingly.    For answer Zeb began to unfasten Jim's harness, strap by strap, and to  buckle one piece to another until he had made a long leather strip that  would reach to the ground.    \"I can climb down that, all right,\" he said.    \"No you can't,\" remarked Jim, with a twinkle in his round eyes.  \"You  may GO down, but you can only CLIMB up.\"    \"Well, I'll climb up when I get back, then,\" said the boy, with a  laugh.  \"Now, Eureka, you'll have to show me the way to those wings.\"    \"You must be very quiet,\" warned the kitten; \"for if you make the least  noise the Gargoyles will wake up.  They can hear a pin drop.\"    \"I'm not going to drop a pin,\" said Zeb.    He had fastened one end of the strap to a wheel of the buggy, and now  he let the line dangle over the side of the house.    \"Be careful,\" cautioned Dorothy, earnestly.    \"I will,\" said the boy, and let himself slide over the edge.    The girl and the Wizard leaned over and watched Zeb work his way  carefully downward, hand over hand, until he stood upon the ground  below.  Eureka clung with her claws to the wooden side of the house and  let herself down easily.  Then together they crept away to enter the  low doorway of a neighboring dwelling.    The watchers waited in breathless suspense until the boy again  appeared, his arms now full of the wooden wings.    When he came to where the strap was hanging he tied the wings all in a  bunch to the end of the line, and the Wizard drew them up.  Then the  line was let down again for Zeb to climb up by.  Eureka quickly  followed him, and soon they were all standing together upon the  platform, with eight of the much prized wooden wings beside them.    The boy was no longer sleepy, but full of energy and excitement.  He  put the harness together again and hitched Jim to the buggy.  Then,  with the Wizard's help, he tried to fasten some of the wings to the old  cab-horse.    This was no easy task, because half of each one of the hinges of the  wings was missing, it being still fastened to the body of the Gargoyle  who had used it.  However, the Wizard went once more to his  satchel--which seemed to contain a surprising variety of odds and  ends--and brought out a spool of strong wire, by means of which they  managed to fasten four of the wings to Jim's harness, two near his head  and two near his tail.  They were a bit wiggley, but secure enough if  only the harness held together.    The other four wings were then fastened to the buggy, two on each side,  for the buggy must bear the weight of the children and the Wizard as it  flew through the air.    These preparations had not consumed a great deal of time, but the  sleeping Gargoyles were beginning to wake up and move around, and soon  some of them would be hunting for their missing wings.  So the  prisoners resolved to leave their prison at once.    They mounted into the buggy, Dorothy holding Eureka safe in her lap.  The girl sat in the middle of the seat, with Zeb and the Wizard on each  side of her.  When all was ready the boy shook the reins and said:    \"Fly away, Jim!\"    \"Which wings must I flop first?\" asked the cab-horse, undecidedly.    \"Flop them all together,\" suggested the Wizard.    \"Some of them are crooked,\" objected the horse.    \"Never mind; we will steer with the wings on the buggy,\" said Zeb.  \"Just you light out and make for that rock, Jim; and don't waste any  time about it, either.\"    So the horse gave a groan, flopped its four wings all together, and  flew away from the platform.  Dorothy was a little anxious about the  success of their trip, for the way Jim arched his long neck and spread  out his bony legs as he fluttered and floundered through the air was  enough to make anybody nervous.  He groaned, too, as if frightened, and  the wings creaked dreadfully because the Wizard had forgotten to oil  them; but they kept fairly good time with the wings of the buggy, so  that they made excellent progress from the start.  The only thing that  anyone could complain of with justice was the fact that they wobbled  first up and then down, as if the road were rocky instead of being as  smooth as the air could make it.    The main point, however, was that they flew, and flew swiftly, if a bit  unevenly, toward the rock for which they had headed.    Some of the Gargoyles saw them, presently, and lost no time in  collecting a band to pursue the escaping prisoners; so that when  Dorothy happened to look back she saw them coming in a great cloud that  almost darkened the sky.          13.  The Den of the Dragonettes      Our friends had a good start and were able to maintain it, for with  their eight wings they could go just as fast as could the Gargoyles.  All the way to the great rock the wooden people followed them, and when  Jim finally alighted at the mouth of the cavern the pursuers were still  some distance away.    \"But, I'm afraid they'll catch us yet,\" said Dorothy, greatly excited.    \"No; we must stop them,\" declared the Wizard.  \"Quick Zeb, help me pull  off these wooden wings!\"    They tore off the wings, for which they had no further use, and the  Wizard piled them in a heap just outside the entrance to the cavern.  Then he poured over them all the kerosene oil that was left in his  oil-can, and lighting a match set fire to the pile.    The flames leaped up at once and the bonfire began to smoke and roar  and crackle just as the great army of wooden Gargoyles arrived.  The  creatures drew back at once, being filled with fear and horror; for  such as dreadful thing as a fire they had never before known in all the  history of their wooden land.    Inside the archway were several doors, leading to different rooms built  into the mountain, and Zeb and the Wizard lifted these wooden doors  from their hinges and tossed them all on the flames.    \"That will prove a barrier for some time to come,\" said the little man,  smiling pleasantly all over his wrinkled face at the success of their  stratagem.  \"Perhaps the flames will set fire to all that miserable  wooden country, and if it does the loss will be very small and the  Gargoyles never will be missed.  But come, my children; let us explore  the mountain and discover which way we must go in order to escape from  this cavern, which is getting to be almost as hot as a bake-oven.\"    To their disappointment there was within this mountain no regular  flight of steps by means of which they could mount to the earth's  surface.  A sort of inclined tunnel led upward for a way, and they  found the floor of it both rough and steep.  Then a sudden turn brought  them to a narrow gallery where the buggy could not pass.  This delayed  and bothered them for a while, because they did not wish to leave the  buggy behind them.  It carried their baggage and was useful to ride in  wherever there were good roads, and since it had accompanied them so  far in their travels they felt it their duty to preserve it.  So Zeb  and the Wizard set to work and took off the wheels and the top, and  then they put the buggy edgewise, so it would take up the smallest  space.  In this position they managed, with the aid of the patient  cab-horse, to drag the vehicle through the narrow part of the passage.  It was not a great distance, fortunately, and when the path grew  broader they put the buggy together again and proceeded more  comfortably.  But the road was nothing more than a series of rifts or  cracks in the mountain, and it went zig-zag in every direction,  slanting first up and then down until they were puzzled as to whether  they were any nearer to the top of the earth than when they had  started, hours before.    \"Anyhow,\" said Dorothy, \"we've 'scaped those awful Gurgles, and that's  ONE comfort!\"    \"Probably the Gargoyles are still busy trying to put out the fire,\"  returned the Wizard.  \"But even if they succeeded in doing that it  would be very difficult for them to fly amongst these rocks; so I am  sure we need fear them no longer.\"    Once in a while they would come to a deep crack in the floor, which  made the way quite dangerous; but there was still enough oil in the  lanterns to give them light, and the cracks were not so wide but that  they were able to jump over them.  Sometimes they had to climb over  heaps of loose rock, where Jim could scarcely drag the buggy.  At such  times Dorothy, Zeb and the Wizard all pushed behind, and lifted the  wheels over the roughest places; so they managed, by dint of hard work,  to keep going.  But the little party was both weary and discouraged  when at last, on turning a sharp corner, the wanderers found themselves  in a vast cave arching high over their heads and having a smooth, level  floor.    The cave was circular in shape, and all around its edge, near to the  ground, appeared groups of dull yellow lights, two of them being always  side by side.  These were motionless at first, but soon began to  flicker more brightly and to sway slowly from side to side and then up  and down.    \"What sort of place is this?\" asked the boy, trying to see more clearly  through the gloom.    \"I cannot imagine, I'm sure,\" answered the Wizard, also peering about.    \"Woogh!\" snarled Eureka, arching her back until her hair stood straight  on end; \"it's den of alligators, or crocodiles, or some other dreadful  creatures!  Don't you see their terrible eyes?\"    \"Eureka sees better in the dark than we can,\" whispered Dorothy.  \"Tell  us, dear, what do the creatures look like?\" she asked, addressing her  pet.    \"I simply can't describe 'em,\" answered the kitten, shuddering.  \"Their  eyes are like pie-plates and their mouths like"]]]
