By the  10th the Boers had betaken themselves to Olifant's Nek in the  Magaliesberg range, and so as to secure the other pass--Magato Nek--the  Rustenburg party seized it. Unfortunately, nearer Pretoria was another  nek, the Commando Nek, and here, as we shall see anon, the Boers, on the  11th of July, managed cunningly to locate themselves, thus cutting off  General Baden-Powell from Pretoria.    FOOTNOTES:    [7] Lord Kensington, of the 2nd Life Guards, succeeded his father in  1896. He was educated at Eton, and entered the army as second lieutenant  on June 22, 1892; he was promoted to lieutenant on April 5, 1893, and  obtained his company on February 3, 1900. He was J.P. for Pembrokeshire  and for Haverfordwest.          CHAPTER IV    JULY    THE BATTLE OF BETHLEHEM AND THE SURRENDER OF PRINSLOO      The drama in Natal having been concluded, the curtain rose on the last  act of the drama in Orange River Colony, the final scenes of which went  \"on greased wheels,\" as it were, owing to the tremendous energy and  talent in the field of, first, General Sir Leslie Rundle, who had had all  the hard preliminary work to do; second, Generals Clements and Paget, and  finally of the greatest martial performer of all--General Sir Archibald  Hunter. It will be remembered that this officer, after the accident to  General Ian Hamilton, had taken over his command, but July found him  released from the eastern Transvaal and in act of assisting in the  concluding operations in the Orange River Colony. His force now consisted  of the 2nd and 3rd Brigades of Mounted Infantry, Kitchener's Horse,  Lovat's Scouts, the Composite Regiment of Cavalry from the Transvaal, the  Highland Brigade (minus the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders guarding  Heilbron), the Munsters, the Yorkshire Light Infantry, the Scottish  Rifles (Militia), and South Staffordshire (Militia), under the command of  General Arthur Paget, the 38th Battery Royal Field Artillery and Battery  of the City Imperial Volunteers, the Scottish Yeomanry, under Colonel  Burn, the 14th and 15th Imperial Yeomanry, and the Imperial Australian  Regiment. In conjunction with General Brabant and General Rundle, who  were in or around Senekal and Hammonia respectively, he moved steadily to  the south-east, the main object of the operations being to dislodge the  Boers from Bethlehem and sweep them off from the rich grain country on  the eastern side of the Orange River Colony, and prevent them from  penetrating lower and disturbing already pacified districts.    Near Lindley, as we are aware, as a commencement of the combined closing  in movement, Generals Clements and Paget had effected a junction. The  Boers clustering in the neighbourhood of Winburg and Senekal were known  to be yet active, though many of their number came in at times and  surrendered, while others, longing to do likewise, were caught sneaking  forth and were sjamboked by their compatriots. In fact, strong guards had  to be posted round the laagers to prevent the desertion of Boers of  pacific tendencies. Still, when they fought, they fought well and  tenaciously, and managed to give a vast amount of trouble at every turn  of the road.    General Paget, on the 3rd, attacked the Dutchmen in their strong position  at Pleisirfontein, driving them off across Leeuw Kop to Broncrifontein.  He bivouacked for the night in the position he had secured, not without  some fierce fighting, an account of which was given by one of the  Imperial Yeomanry:--         \"We moved from Lindley on the morning of July 2, and by midday       were in touch with the enemy, who had taken up a position on       some kopjes overlooking the road on which we had to pass. We       opened fire with the 38th Battery Field Artillery 15-pounder,       and also with the C.I.V. 12-pounder quick-firing guns. The       Boers replied with two 15-pounders, but we were too much for       them, and by 2 P.M. we had driven them off and our Mounted       Infantry and Yeomanry had taken the position. It was a       miserably cold day with drizzling rain, so you may imagine it       was anything but pleasant.         \"We camped that night at a farm which the enemy had occupied       all day. They retired some distance, and continued shelling our       camp till dark, and though some of their shells fell into our       camp and among the waggons no harm was done. Our casualties       were two of our men wounded. After we had pitched our camp it       came on to rain, so we had to lie down in our wet blankets on       the damp veldt. We were, however, able to get plenty of wood       from the farmhouse, so we made a large fire which, with some       warm tea, was a comfort. Next day we moved camp at 8 A.M. and       proceeded, after the Boers had dropped a few shells into us.       Our artillery went on ahead, and took up a position on a kopje,       and shortly after we located the Boer guns on another kopje.       To-day we found they had a large gun, a Creusot, which       outranged ours. The artillery duel lasted all day till 4 P.M.       when a general attack was made by the Infantry and Yeomanry on       the kopje. While this was going on a force of Boers dressed in       khaki and helmets, the same as those used at Lindley, managed       to creep up on the 38th Battery, who had run short of       ammunition, and shot the men down at the guns. The captain and       lieutenant were killed, and Major Oldfield was mortally       wounded.\"    [Illustration: PRINSLOO'S COMMANDO RETREATING TO THE BRANDWATER BASIN  AFTER THE FIGHT AT RETIEF'S NEK    From a Sketch by M. F. R.]    As may be imagined the situation was now verging on disaster. Major  Oldfield had received his death-blow, Captain Fitzgerald was helpless  with a bullet in the thigh, Lieutenant Belcher was shot at his guns. The  gunners and drivers of the guns had nearly all dropped dead or were  disabled--their horses in death agonies strewing the ground. It was  impossible, therefore, to remove the guns. The Bushmen had been forced to  retire at a critical moment, and it seemed as though the day were lost.  Then up came the C.I.V. Battery, and with the assistance of Captain  Budworth--whose wits and gallantry were never better displayed--fired  their two guns trail to trail over the heads of the 38th, battered the  triumphantly advancing foe on the left front and, in a word, saved the  situation. Off scudded the Boers, after them went the Bushmen,  Budworth riding at the head, and finally with the assistance of the  Infantry--the Yorkshire Light Infantry, the Munster Fusiliers, and the  Imperial Yeomanry who had rushed up the hills and scattered the remaining  Dutchmen at the point of the bayonet--they succeeded in getting the guns  limbered up and away! The dashing work cost forty killed and wounded,  besides Captain Dill, 2nd Yorkshire Light Infantry, wounded, and  Lieutenant and Adjutant A. F. C. Williams, Indian Staff Corps (Attached  Brabant's Horse), dangerously wounded.    [Illustration: RAILWAY MAP OF EASTERN PORTION OF ORANGE RIVER COLONY AND  NATAL. (Scale, 1 inch=64 miles. By permission of the Publishers of \"South  Africa.\")]    On the following day, 4th, the enemy was pursued as far as Blaauw Kop,  fifteen miles north-west of Bethlehem, where Mr. Steyn's seat of  government was now supposed to be. Mr. Steyn had cautiously betaken  himself to Fouriesburg (between Bethlehem and Ficksburg), leaving De Wet  and some 3000 men to await the attack of the British forces. Meanwhile  round Ficksburg fierce fighting was taking place, the Boers making a  midnight attack with the despairing idea of reoccupying that town. Their  furious effort lasted but an hour, when they found themselves beaten.    On the 5th the position at Doornberg, on the Winburg-Senekal road, which  the Dutchman had evacuated, was promptly taken possession of by General  Brabant, who thereby ousted them from a vantage-point whence they could  pounce on convoys proceeding to and from the base at Winburg, and secured  the line of rail in the vicinity of Zand River, round which hovering  gangs of wreckers had persistently congregated.    To return to the Dutchmen inside Bethlehem. The town, like many other  South African towns, is dominated by cliffs or kopjes, two of these being  on the north-west, while another (Wolhunter Kop) rises in the south in a  high and solitary peak above the plain, and descends steeply towards the  side of the town. Naturally these obstructive eminences were chosen as  the stronghold of the foe, and as naturally the object of the British was  now to clear the Boers from them, and to this end General Arthur Paget  marched his force to within two miles of his objective, and encamped near  the northerly spurs of the north-western kopjes.    General Clements's column, consisting of the Royal Irish, Worcesters,  Wiltshires, a battery of Field Artillery, and two 5-inch guns moved about  six miles on the left rear of General Paget's force towards the east of  the town; where, on all the available ridges and cliffs were Boer  trenches and gun emplacements, some of these knowingly and skilfully  arranged at a right angle with the cliffs and with their backs to the  town, in order that any approaching force could be swept from all  directions as they neared the position. General Clements sent to De Wet a  flag of truce demanding the surrender of the place, and on receipt of a  refusal the hammer-and-tong process of warfare began.    Both Generals simultaneously attacked from different points, but owing to  the crusted and gibbose nature of the ground in this part of the Orange  Colony it was impossible for the Cavalry to attempt any very wide turning  movement. The result was that on the dash and daring of the Infantry much  was found to depend and that eventually carried all before it.

In spite of this fact,  his spirits rose with every mile he placed behind him. He knew that it  would be impossible for Isobel and her father to stand the hardship of  fast and continued travel. At the most they would not make more than  twenty miles in a day, and even with his scrub team he could make  thirty, and would probably overtake them at the end of the next day. And  then it occurred to him, with a pleasurable thrill, that to find Isobel  again on the trail, as he had first seen her, would be a hundred times  better than finding her at Lac Bain. He would accompany her and the  colonel to Churchill. They would be together for days, and at the end of  that time--    He laughed low and joyously, and for a spell he urged the dogs into a  swifter pace. That he had correctly estimated the speed of those ahead  of him he was convinced, when, two hours later, he came upon the remains  of their mid-day camp-fire, nine or ten miles from Lac Bain. It was dark  when he reached this point. There were glowing embers still in the  fire, and these he stirred into life, adding armfuls of dry wood to the  flames. About him in the snow he found the prints of Isobel's little  feet, and in the flood of joy and hope that was sweeping more and more  into his life he sang and whistled, and forgot that he was alone in  a desolation of blackness that made even the dogs slink nearer to the  fire. He would camp here--where Isobel had been only a few hours before.  If he traveled hard he would overtake them by the next noon.    But he had underestimated his own exhaustion. After he had put up his  tent before the fire he made himself a bed of balsam boughs and tell  into a deep sleep, from which neither dawn nor the restless movements of  the dogs could awaken him. When at last he opened his eyes it was broad  day. He jumped to his feet and looked at his watch. It was nine o'clock,  and after ten before he again took up the pursuit of the two sledges.  Not until several hours later did he give up hope of overtaking Isobel  and her father as he had planned, and he reproved himself roundly for  having overslept. The afternoon was half gone before he struck their  camp of the preceding evening, and he knew that, because of his own loss  of time, Isobel was still as far ahead of him as when he had left Lac  Bain.    He made up some of this time by following the trail for an hour when the  moon was at its highest, and then pitched his tent. He was up again  the next morning and breaking camp before it was light. Scarcely had he  traveled an hour over the clear-cut trail ahead of him when he suddenly  halted his dogs with a loud cry of command and astonishment. In a small  open the trails of the two sledges separated. One continued straight  east, toward Churchill, while the other turned almost at right angles  into the south. For a few moments he could find no explanation for  this occurrence. Then he decided that one of the Indians had struck  southward, either to hunt, or on some short mission, and that he would  join the other sledge farther on. Convinced that this was the right  solution, Philip continued over the Churchill trail. A little later,  to his despair, it began to snow so heavily that the trail which he was  following was quickly obliterated. There was but one thing for him to do  now, and that was to hasten on to Fort Churchill, giving up all hope of  finding Isobel and the colonel before he met them there.    Four days later he came into the post. The news that awaited him struck  him dumb. Isobel and her father, with one Indian, had gone with the  sledge into the South. The Indian who had driven on to Churchill could  give no further information, except that he knew the colonel and his  daughter had suddenly changed their minds about coming to Churchill.  Perhaps they had gone to Nelson House, or York Factory--or even to Le  Pas. He did not know.    It was with a heavy heart that Philip turned his face once more  toward Lac Bain. He could not repress a laugh, bitter and filled with  disappointment, as he thought how fate was playing against him. If he  had not overslept he would have caught up with the sledges before they  separated, if he had not forced himself into this assignment it was  possible that Isobel and her father would have come to him. They knew  that his detachment was at Prince Albert--and they were going south. He  had little doubt but that they were striking for Nelson House, and from  Nelson House to civilization there was but one trail, that which led to  Le Pas and Etomami. And Etomami was but two hours by rail from Prince  Albert.    He carried in his breast pocket a bit of written information which he  had obtained from the Churchill factor--that helped to soften, in a  way, the sting of his disappointment. It was Colonel Becker's London  address--and Isobel's, and he quickly laid out for himself new plans of  action. He would write to MacGregor from Lac Bain, asking him to put in  at once the necessary application for the purchase of his release from  the service. As soon as he was free he would go to London. He would  call on Isobel like a gentleman, he told himself. Perhaps, after all, it  would be the better way.    But first, there was DeBar.    As he had been feverishly anxious to return into the North, so, now, he  was anxious to have this affair with DeBar over with. He lost no time at  Lac Bain, writing his letter to Inspector MacGregor on the same day that  he arrived. Only two of the dogs which the Indian had brought into the  post were fit to travel, and with these, and a light sledge on which he  packed his equipment he set off alone for Fond du Lac. A week later he  reached the post. He found Hutt, the factor, abed with a sprained knee,  and the only other men at the post were three Chippewayans, who could  neither talk nor understand English.    \"DeBar is gone,\" groaned Hutt, after Philip had made himself known. \"A  rascal of a Frenchman came in last night on his way to the Grand Rapid,  and this morning DeBar was missing. I had the Chippewayans in, and they  say he left early in the night with his sledge and one big bull of a  hound that he hangs to like grim death. I'd kill that damned Indian you  came up with. I believe it was he that told the Frenchman there was an  officer on the way.\"    \"Is the Frenchman here?\" asked Philip.    \"Gone!\" groaned Hutt again, turning his twisted knee. \"He left for the  Grand Rapid this morning, and there isn't another dog or sledge at the  post. This winter has been death on the dogs, and what few are left are  out on the trap-lines. DeBar knows you're after him, sure as fate, and  he's taken a trail toward the Athabasca. The best I can do is to let you  have a Chippewayan who'll go with you as far as the Chariot. That's the  end of his territory, and what you'll do after that God only knows.\"    \"I'll take the chance,\" said Philip. \"We'll start after dinner. I've got  two dogs, a little lame, but even at that they'll have DeBar's outfit  handicapped.\"    It was less than two hours later when Philip and the Chippewayan set off  into the western forests, the Indian ahead and Philip behind, with the  dogs and sledge between them. Both men were traveling light. Philip had  even strapped his carbine and small emergency bag to the toboggan, and  carried only his service revolver at his belt. It was one o'clock and  the last slanting beams of the winter sun, heatless and only cheering  to the eye, were fast dying away before the first dull gray approach of  desolate gloom which precedes for a few hours the northern night. As the  black forest grew more and more somber about them, he looked over the  grayish yellow back of the tugging huskies at the silent Indian striding  over the outlaw's trail, and a slight shiver passed through him, a  shiver that was neither of cold nor fear, yet which was accompanied by  an oppression which it was hard for him to shake off. Deep down in his  heart Philip had painted a picture of William DeBar--of the man--and it  was a picture to his liking. Such men he would like to know and to  call his friends. But now the deepening gloom, the darkening of the sky  above, the gray picture ahead of him--the Chippewayan, as silent as  the trees, the dogs pulling noiselessly in their traces like slinking  shadows, the ghost-like desolation about him, all recalled him to that  other factor in the game, who was DeBar the outlaw, and not DeBar  the man. In this same way, he imagined, Forbes, Bannock, Fleisham and  Gresham had begun the game, and they had lost. Perhaps they, too, had  gone out weakened by visions of the equity of things, for the sympathy  of man for man is strong when they meet above the sixtieth.    DeBar was ahead of him--DeBar the outlaw, watching and scheming as he  had watched and schemed when the other four had played against him. The  game had grown old to him. It had brought him victim after victim, and  each victim had made of him a more deadly enemy of the next. Perhaps at  this moment he was not very far ahead, waiting to send him the way of  the others. The thought urged new fire into Philip's blood. He spurted  past the dogs and stopped the Chippewayan, and then examined the trail.  It was old. The frost had hardened in the huge footprints of DeBar's  big hound; it had built a webby film over the square impressions of his  snow-shoe thongs. But what of that? Might not the trail still be old,  and DeBar a few hundred yards ahead of him, waiting--watching?    He went back to the sledge and unstrapped his carbine. In a moment the  first picture, the first sympathy, was gone. It was not the law which  DeBar was fighting now. It was himself. He walked ahead of the Indian,  alert, listening and prepared. The crackling of a frost-bitten tree  startled him into stopping; the snapping of a twig under its weight  of ice and snow sent strange thrills through"]]]
