William John, of Rigdon, Ind., has patented an improved Tire Setting and  Cooling Apparatus, by which the tire may be set by one person, easily  and quickly, without burning the fellies, and without straining the  wheel by the unequal cooling of the tire.    Joseph A. Mumford, of Avondale, Nova Scotia, Canada, has patented an  improved machine for Sawing and Jointing Shingles. This machine cannot  be properly described without engravings. It has an ingenious feeding  device, and its flywheel carries the jointing knives.           *       *       *       *       *                                 =Ill-balanced Production.=    The Philadelphia _Record_ sensibly remarks that the popular complaint of  over-production is a mistake. Though of a few things we make or mine too  much, our main trouble arises from not producing enough, in variety if  not in quantity.    \"The wants of mankind never can be satisfied. Every new means of  supplying a want creates new wants. They grow by what they feed on. As  long as humanity is so constituted, over-production, in a general and  enlarged sense, is impossible. It is this impossible thing with which  the reformers would deal who propose to work fewer hours each day, or  fewer hours in the week. The trouble they deplore does not exist; the  remedy they propose defeats itself. A man cannot get rid of his load by  shifting it from his right hand to his left hand. Production will not be  stopped by making men their own employers certain hours in the day or  certain days in the week, instead of allowing them to pursue their usual  avocations.    \"The real trouble, which the labor reformers seem incompetent to fathom,  is that there is not enough diversity in employments. What is desired is  more work in productive enterprises, a more diffused industry, and a  closer commercial connection with those countries wherein we can make  desirable exchanges both of our raw material and our manufactured  products. Every miner that drops his pick and takes up a hoe, every idle  man that turns himself into an earner of wages, every person that picks  up some loose thread of employment, every capitalist that takes  advantage of stagnating industry and cheap material to build a house or  beautify or improve a country seat, or set on foot some new process of  manufacture, does something toward working out the problem which is  puzzling the economists. In good time the surplus iron and coal will be  sold; new populations will want new railroads; recuperated capital will  gather confidence and take hold of new enterprises, and the whole nation  will move forward again to more assured prosperity and to vaster  undertakings.\"           *       *       *       *       *                                    =Labor in Germany.=    The consul at Barmen reports that for agricultural labor the pay varies  greatly, according to the proximity to or remoteness from manufacturing  centers; and ranges from fifty-six cents a day in the neighborhood of  Barmen to thirty-one cents a day in the lower Rhine valley, and as low  as eighteen cents in parts of Silesia. At Barmen, Crefeld and  Duesseldorf, carpenters, coppersmiths, plumbers, machinists and  wagonsmiths earn fifty-one to seventy-five cents daily; saddlers and  shoemakers forty-seven to fifty-two cents daily; bakers and brewers,  with board and lodging, from $1.42 to $2.14 weekly, and without board  from sixty cents a day to $4.28 a week; farm hands are paid from $107 to  $215 yearly, with maintenance; railroad laborers from fifty-six to  eighty-three cents per day, and as high as ninety-five cents daily for  piece work on tunnels; silk weavers can earn $2.15 to $2.85 a week per  loom; factory women $2.15, and children $1 a week. Business and wages  are very low. In good times wages are eighty per cent higher. The cost  of the necessaries of life has increased some fifty per cent in thirteen  years, although it is now but little higher than five years ago. A man  and wife with two or three children can live in two or three rooms in a  poor and comfortless manner for $275 a year, and to support such an  establishment all the members have to work ten or twelve hours daily.  For a family of six persons the cost is about $7 per week--an amount but  few families can earn, as the depression of trade and the reduction of  time allow few to do a full week's work, although wages are nominally a  trifle higher than five years ago.           *       *       *       *       *                                  =Petroleum June Review.=                               DRILLING WELL ACCOUNT.    The low price of oil and large accumulation of stock in the producing  regions have had the effect to lessen operations in this department  during the month of June.    The total number of drilling wells in all the districts, at the close of  the month, was 266, which was 110 less than in the preceding month. Rigs  erected and being erected 243, against 309 last month. The number of  drilling wells completed during the month was 269, being 151 less than  in May. Aggregate production of the new wells was 3,788 barrels, against  6,851 barrels in May. The total number of dry holes developed in the  month was 22, against 42 in May.    The operators in the great northern field (Bradford district) have  curtailed operations to an extent which will compare favorably with the  operators in the other portions of the producing regions, as will be  seen by the following statement, namely:    Number of wells drilling at the close of the month, 187, against 284 at  the close of the previous month. Number of drilling wells completed in  June, 193, against 346 in May. Number of rigs erected and being erected,  196, against 234 in May.                                    PRODUCTION.    The daily average production for the month was 40,575 barrels, being a  decrease of 227 barrels. The new wells completed in June failed to make  good the falling off of the old ones, by decreasing the daily average  227 barrels. Bradford district shows a daily average production of  16,000 barrels, being an increase of 1,280 barrels over last month.    The aggregate production in June of all the other districts combined,  with the aid of 76 new wells, decreased the daily average 1,507 barrels.                                     SHIPMENTS.    The shipments in June, out of the producing regions, were 174,225  barrels larger than in the preceding month. The total shipments of  crude, and refined reduced to crude equivalent, by railroad, river and  pipes to the following points, were 1,135,119 barrels:      New York took            555,794 bbls.

This year the water of the river has been  unusually warm and low, and the inflow to the lakes very slight. The  consequence has been an excessive growth of a conferva which is  indigenous to these lakes and confined to them. This alga, _Nodularia  spumigera_, is very light and floats on the water, except during  breezes, when it becomes diffused, and being driven to the lee shores,  forms a thick scum like green oil paint.    This scum, which is from two to six inches thick, and of a pasty  consistency, being swallowed by cattle when drinking, acts poisonously  and rapidly causes death. The symptoms of the poisoning are stupor and  unconsciousness, falling and remaining quiet (as if asleep), unless  touched, when convulsions are induced, the head and neck being drawn  back by a rigid spasm, subsiding before death. The poison causes the  death of sheep in from one to six or eight hours; of horses, in from  eight to twenty-four hours; of dogs, in from four to five hours; and of  pigs in three or four hours. A _post mortem_ shows the plant is rapidly  absorbed into the circulation, where it must act as a ferment, and  causes disorganization. As the cattle will not touch the puddle where  the plant scum has collected and become putrid, all they take is quite  fresh, and the poisoning is therefore not due to drinking a putrescent  fluid full of bacteria, as was suggested.    When the scum collects and dries on the banks it forms a green crust.  When, however, it is left in wet pools it rapidly decomposes, emitting a  most horrible stench, like putrid urine; but previous to reaching this  stage it gives out a smell like that of very rancid butter.    A blue pigment exudes from this decomposing matter, having some  remarkable properties. It is remarkably fluorescent, being red by  reflected and blue by transmitted light; it appears to be a product of  the decomposition, and allied to the coloring matter found in some  lichens.           *       *       *       *       *                                   =ASTRONOMICAL NOTES.=                              BY BERLIN H.

We were  obliged, therefore, to continue our course along the edge of the reeds;  which in a short time appeared in large masses in front of us, stretching  into a vast plain upon our right; and it became evident that the whole  neighbourhood was subject to extensive inundation.    ENCAMP AMIDST REEDS.    I was fearful that the reeds would have checked us; but there was a  passage between the patches, through which we managed to force our way  into a deep bight, and fortunately gained the river at the bottom of it  much sooner than we expected. We were obliged to clear away a space for  the tents; and thus, although there had been no such appearance from Mount  Foster, we found ourselves in less than seven hours after leaving it,  encamped pretty far in that marsh for which we had so anxiously looked  from its summit, and now trusting to circumstances for safety, upon  ground on which, in any ordinary state of the river, it would have been  dangerous to have ventured. Indeed, as it was, our situation was  sufficiently critical, and would not admit of hesitation on my part.    NATURE OF THE COUNTRY.    After the cattle had been turned out, Mr. Hume and I again mounted our  horses, and proceeded to the westward, with a view to examine the nature  of the country before us, and to ascertain if it was still practicable to  move along the river side. For, although it was evident that we had  arrived at what might strictly be called the marshes of the Macquarie, I  still thought we might be at some distance from the place where Mr. Oxley  terminated his journey.    There was no indication in the river to encourage an idea that it would  speedily terminate; nor, although we were on ground subject to extensive  inundation, could we be said to have reached the heart of the marshes, as  the reeds still continued in detached bodies only. We forced a path  through various portions of them, and passed over ground wholly subject to  flood, to a distance of about six miles. We then crossed a small rise of  ground, sufficiently high to have afforded a retreat, had necessity  obliged us to seek for one; and we shortly afterwards descended on the  river, unaltered in its appearance, and rather increased than diminished  in size. A vast plain extended to the N.W., the extremity of which we  could not discern; though a thick forest formed its northern boundary.    It was evident that this plain had been frequently under water, but it was  difficult to judge from the marks on the trees to what height the floods  had risen. The soil was an alluvial deposit, superficially sandy; and many  shells were scattered over its surface. To the south, the country appeared  close and low; nor do I think we could have approached the river from that  side, by reason of the huge belts of reeds that appeared to extend as far  as the the eye could reach.    MEN ATTACKED WITH OPHTHALMIA.    The approach of night obliged us to return to the camp. On our arrival,  we found that the state of Henwood and Williams would prevent our stirring  for a day or two. Not only had they a return of inflammation, but several  other of the men complained of a painful irritation of the eyes, which  were dreadfully blood-shot and weak. I was in some measure prepared for a  relapse in Henwood, as the exposure which he necessarily underwent on the  plain was sufficient to produce that effect; but I now became apprehensive  that the affection would run through the party.    Considering our situation in its different bearings, it struck me that the  men who were to return to Wellington Valley with an account our our  proceedings for the Governor's information, had been brought as far as  prudence warranted. There was no fear of their going astray, as long as  they had the river to guide them; but in the open country which we were to  all appearance approaching, or amidst fields of reeds, they might wander  from the track, and irrecoverably lose themselves. I determined,  therefore, not to risk their safety, but to prepare my dispatches for  Sydney, and I hoped most anxiously, that ere they were closed, all  symptoms of disease would have terminated.    In the course of the day, however, Spencer, who was to return with Riley  to Wellington Valley, became seriously indisposed, and I feared that he  was attacked with dysentery. Indeed, I should have attributed his illness  to our situation, but I did not notice any unusual moisture in the  atmosphere, nor did any fogs rise from the river. I therefore the rather  attributed it to exposure and change of diet, and treated him accordingly.  To my satisfaction, when I visited the men late in the evening, I found a  general improvement in the whole of them. Spencer was considerably  relieved, and those of the party who had inflammation of the eyes no  longer felt that painful irritation of which they had before complained.  I determined, therefore, unless untoward circumstances should prevent it,  to send Riley and his companion homewards, and to move the party without  loss of time.    We had not seen any natives for many days, but a few passed the camp on  the opposite side of the river on the evening of the 25th. They would not,  however, come to us; but fled into the interior in great apparent alarm.    DEPARTURE OF TWO MEN FOR WELLINGTON.    On the morning of the 26th, the men were sufficiently recovered to pursue  their journey. Riley and Spencer left us at an early hour; and about  7 a.m. we pursued a N.N.W. course along the great plain I have noticed,  starting numberless quails, and many wild turkeys, by the way. Leaving  that part of the river on which Mr. Hume and I had touched considerably to  the left, we made for the point of a wood, projecting from the river line  of trees into the plain. The ground under us was an alluvial deposit, and  bore all the marks of frequent inundation.    The soil was yielding, blistered, and uneven; and the claws of cray-fish,  together with numerous small shells, were every where collected in the  hollows made by the subsiding of the waters, between broad belts of reeds  and scrubs of polygonum.    CONSULTATION.    On gaining the point of the wood, we found an absolute check put to our  further progress. We had been moving directly on the great body of the  marsh, and from the wood it spread in boundless extent before us. It was  evidently lower than the ground on which we stood; we had therefore, a  complete view over the whole expanse; and there was a dreariness and  desolation pervading the scene that strengthened as we gazed upon it.  Under existing circumstances, it only remained for us either to skirt  the reeds to the northward, or to turn in again upon the river; and as I  considered it important to ascertain the direction of the Macquarie at so  critical and interesting a point, I thought it better to adopt the latter  measure. We, accordingly, made for the river, and pitched our tents, as at  the last station, in the midst of reeds.    There were two points at this time, upon which I was extremely anxious.  The first was as to the course of the river; the second, as to the extent  of the marshes by which we had been checked, and the practicability of the  country to the northward.    In advising with Mr. Hume, I proposed launching the boat, as the surest  means of ascertaining the former, and he, on his part, most readily  volunteered to examine the marshes, in any direction I should point out.  It was therefore, arranged, that I should take two men, and a week's  provision with me in the boat down the river; and that he should proceed  with a like number of men on an excursion to the northward.    After having given directions as to the regulations of camp during our  absence, we separated, on the morning of the 26th for the first time, in  furtherance of the objects each had in view.    BOAT EXCURSION.    In pulling down the river, I found that its channel was at first extremely  tortuous and irregular, but that it held a general N.W. course, and bore  much the same appearance as it had done since our descent from Mount  Foster.    We had a laborious task in lifting the boat over the trunks of trees that  had fallen into the channel of the river or that had been left by the  floods, and at length we stove her in upon a sunken log. The injury she  received was too serious not to require immediate repair; and we,  therefore, patched her up with a tin plate. This accident occasioned some  delay, and the morning was consumed without our having made any  considerable progress. At length, however, we got into a more open  channel.    The river suddenly increased in breadth to thirty-five or forty-five  yards, with a depth of from twelve to twenty feet of water. Its banks  shelved perpendicularly down, and were almost on a level with the surface  of the stream; and the flood mark was not more than two feet high on the  reeds by which they were lined. We had hitherto passed under the shade of  the flooded gum, which still continued on the immediate banks of the  river; but, the farther we advanced, the more did we find these trees in a  state of decay, until at length they ceased, or were only rarely met with.    TERMINATION OF THE RIVER.    About 2 p.m. I brought up under a solitary tree, in consequence of heavy  rain: this was upon the left bank. In the afternoon, however, we again  pushed forward, and soon lost sight of every other object amidst reeds of  great height. The channel of the river continued as broad and as deep as  ever, but the flood mark did not show more than a foot above the banks,  which were now almost on a level with the water; and the current was so  sluggish as to be scarcely perceptible. These general appearances  continued for about three miles, when our course was suddenly, and most  unexpectedly, checked. The channel, which had promised so well,"]]]
