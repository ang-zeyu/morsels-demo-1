For that purpose they are better made of canvas.    [Sidenote: Canvas Kyacks]    [Sidenote: Lash Ropes]    Many canvas kyacks are on the market, and most of them are worthless. It  is astonishing how many knocks they are called on to receive and how  soon the abrasion of rocks and trees will begin to wear them through.  Avoid those made of light material. Avoid also those made in imitation  of the rawhide with a stick along the top of one side to take the sling  straps. In no time the ends of that stick will punch through. The best  sort are constructed of OO canvas. The top is made of a half-inch rope  sewn firmly to the hem all around. The sling straps are long, and  riveted firmly. The ends are reinforced with leather. Such kyacks will  give you good service and last you a long time. When you wish to express  them, you pack your saddle and saddle blankets in one, telescope the  other over it, and tie up the bundle with the lash rope. The lash rope  is important, for you will have to handle it much, and a three months'  trip with a poor one would lose you your immortal soul. Most articles on  the subject advise thirty-three feet. That is long enough for the  diamond hitch and for other hitches with a very small top pack, but it  will not do for many valuable hitches on a bulky pack. Forty feet is  nearer the ticket. The best is a manila half inch or five-eighth inch.  If you boil it before starting out, you will find it soft to handle. The  boiling does not impair its strength. Parenthetically: do not become  over-enthusiastic and boil your riata, or you will make it aggravatingly  kinky. Cotton rope is all right, but apt to be stiff. I once used a  linen rope; it proved to be soft, strong, and held well, but I have  never been able to find another.    [Sidenote: Cinch Hooks]    The cinch hook sold with the outfit is sawn into shape and strengthened  with a bolt. If you will go out into the nearest oak grove, however, you  can cut yourself a natural hook which will last longer and hold much  better. The illustration shows the method of attaching such a hook.    [Sidenote: Picket Ropes]    So you have your horses ready for their burdens. Picket ropes should be  of half-inch rope and about 50 feet long. The bell for the bell horse  should be a loud one, with distinctive note not easily blended with  natural sounds, and attached to a broad strap with safety buckle.    [Illustration: _Natural Cinch Hook of Oak._]    [Sidenote: Hobbles]    Hobbles are of two patterns. Both consist of heavy leather straps to  buckle around either front leg and connected by two links and a swivel.  In one the strap passes first through the ring to which the links are  attached, and then to the buckle. The other buckles first, and then the  end is carried through the ring. You will find the first mentioned a  decided nuisance, especially on a wet or frosty morning, for the leather  tends to atrophy in a certain position from which numbed fingers have  more than a little difficulty in dislodging it. The latter, however,  are comparatively easy to undo.    [Illustration:              A--Wash Leather.            B--Heavy Leather.            C--Steel Ring.            D--Buckle.            E--Swivel.    _Hobbles--Wrong (Upper) and Right Sort._]    Hobbles should be lined. I have experimented with various materials,  including the much lauded sheepskin with the wool on. The latter when  wet chafes as much as raw leather, and when frozen is about as valuable  as a wood rasp. The best lining is a piece of soft wash leather at least  two inches wider than the hobble straps.    [Sidenote: How to Attach Hobbles]    With most horses it is sufficient to strap a pair of these around the  forelegs and above the fetlocks. A gentle animal can be trusted with  them fastened below.    But many horses by dint of practice or plain native cussedness can hop  along with hobbles nearly as fast as they could foot-free, and a lot  too fast for you to catch them single handed. Such an animal is an  unmitigated bother. Of course if there is good staking you can picket  him out; but quite likely he is unused to the picket rope, or the feed  is scant.    [Sidenote: Side Lines]    In that case it may be that side lines--which are simply hobbles by  which a hind foot and a fore foot are shackled--may work. I have had  pretty good success by fastening a short heavy chain to one fore leg. As  long as the animal fed quietly, he was all right, but an attempt at  galloping or trotting swung the chain sufficiently to rap him sharply  across the shins.    Very good hobbles can be made from a single strand unraveled from a  large rope, doubled once to make a loop for one leg, twisted strongly,  the two ends brought around the other leg and then thrust through the  fibers. This is the sort used generally by cowboys. They are soft and  easily carried, but soon wear out.          CHAPTER X    HORSE PACKS      [Sidenote: Generalities]    ALMOST any one can put together a comparatively well made back pack, and  very slight practice will enable a beginner to load a canoe. But the  packing of a horse or mule is another matter. The burden must be  properly weighted, properly balanced, properly adjusted, and properly  tied on. That means practice and considerable knowledge.    To the average wilderness traveler the possession of a pack saddle and  canvas kyacks simplifies the problem considerably. If you were to engage  in packing as a business, wherein probably you would be called on to  handle packages of all shapes and sizes, however, you would be compelled  to discard your kyacks in favor of a sling made of rope. And again it  might very well happen that some time or another you might be called on  to transport your plunder without appliances on an animal caught up from  the pasture. For this reason you must further know how to hitch a pack  securely to a naked horse.    In this brief resume of possibilities you can see it is necessary that  you know at least three methods of throwing a lash rope--a hitch to hold  your top pack and kyacks, a sling to support your boxes on the aparejos,  and a hitch for the naked horse. But in addition it will be desirable to  understand other hitches adapted to different exigencies of bulky top  packs, knobby kyacks and the like. One hitch might hold these all well  enough, but the especial hitch is better.    [Sidenote: Pack Models]    The detailment of processes by diagram must necessarily be rather dull  reading. It can be made interesting by an attempt to follow out in  actual practice the hitches described. For this purpose you do not need  a full-size outfit. A pair of towels folded compactly, tied together,  and thrown one each side over a bit of stove wood to represent the  horse makes a good pack, while a string with a bent nail for cinch hook  will do as lash rope. With these you can follow out each detail.    [Sidenote: Saddling the Horse]    First of all you must be very careful to get your saddle blankets on  smooth and without wrinkles. Hoist the saddle into place, then lift it  slightly and loosen the blanket along the length of the backbone, so  that the weight of the pack will not bind the blanket tight across the  horse's back. In cinching up, be sure you know your animal; some puff  themselves out so that in five minutes the cinch will hang loose. Fasten  your latigo or cinch straps to the _lower_ ring. Thus you can get at it  even when the pack is in place.    [Sidenote: Packing the Kyacks]    Distribute the weight carefully between the kyacks. \"Heft\" them again  and again. The least preponderance on one side will cause a saddle to  sag in that direction; that in turn will bring pressure to bear on the  opposite side of the withers, and that will surely chafe to a sore.  Then you are in trouble.    When you are quite sure the kyacks weigh alike, get your companion to  hang one on the pack saddle, at the same time you hook the straps of the  other. If you try to do it by yourself you must leave one hanging while  you pick up the other, thus running a good risk of twisting the saddle.    [Sidenote: Top Packs]    Your top pack you will build as the occasion demands. In general, try to  make it as low as possible and to get your blankets on top where the  pack rope \"bites.\" The strap connecting the kyacks is then buckled. Over  all you will throw the canvas tarpaulin that you use to sleep on. Tuck  it in back and front to exclude dust. It is now ready for the pack rope.    [Illustration: _The Jam Hitch._]    [Sidenote: Jam Hitch]    1. _The Jam Hitch._--All hitches possess one thing in common--the rope  passes around the horse and through the cinch hook. The first pull is to  tighten that cinch. Afterward other maneuvers are attempted. Now  ordinarily the packer pulls tight his cinch, and then in the further  throwing of the hitch he depends on holding his slack. It is a very  difficult thing to do. With the jam hitch, however, the necessity is  obviated. The beauty of it is that the rope renders freely one way--the  way you are pulling--but will not give a hair the other--the direction  of loosening. So you may heave up the cinch as tightly as you please,  then drop the rope and go on about your packing perfectly sure that  nothing is going to slip back on you.    The rope passes once around the shank of the hook, and then through the  jaw (see diagram). Be sure to get it around the shank and not the curve.  Simplicity itself; and yet I have seen very few packers who know of it.    [Sidenote: The Diamond Hitch]    2. _The Diamond Hitch._--I suppose the diamond in one form or another is  more used than any other. Its merit is its adaptability to different  shapes and sizes of package--in fact it is the only hitch good for  aparejo packing--its great flattening power, and the fact that it rivets  the pack to the horse's sides."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3296"],[0,"The Confessions of St. Augustine (#15)"],[1,"the language graceful. But they who held him out to me were no good  judges of things; and therefore to them he appeared understanding and  wise, because in words pleasing. I felt however that another sort of  people were suspicious even of truth, and refused to assent to it, if  delivered in a smooth and copious discourse. But Thou, O my God, hadst  already taught me by wonderful and secret ways, and therefore I believe  that Thou taughtest me, because it is truth, nor is there besides Thee  any teacher of truth, where or whencesoever it may shine upon us. Of  Thyself therefore had I now learned, that neither ought any thing to  seem to be spoken truly, because eloquently; nor therefore falsely,  because the utterance of the lips is inharmonious; nor, again, therefore  true, because rudely delivered; nor therefore false, because the  language is rich; but that wisdom and folly are as wholesome and  unwholesome food; and adorned or unadorned phrases as courtly or country  vessels; either kind of meats may be served up in either kind of dishes.    That greediness then, wherewith I had of so long time expected that man,  was delighted verily with his action and feeling when disputing, and his  choice and readiness of words to clothe his ideas. I was then delighted,  and, with many others and more than they, did I praise and extol him.  It troubled me, however, that in the assembly of his auditors, I was not  allowed to put in and communicate those questions that troubled me,  in familiar converse with him. Which when I might, and with my friends  began to engage his ears at such times as it was not unbecoming for him  to discuss with me, and had brought forward such things as moved me; I  found him first utterly ignorant of liberal sciences, save grammar, and  that but in an ordinary way. But because he had read some of Tully's  Orations, a very few books of Seneca, some things of the poets, and such  few volumes of his own sect as were written in Latin and neatly, and  was daily practised in speaking, he acquired a certain eloquence, which  proved the more pleasing and seductive because under the guidance of a  good wit, and with a kind of natural gracefulness. Is it not thus, as I  recall it, O Lord my God, Thou judge of my conscience? before Thee is  my heart, and my remembrance, Who didst at that time direct me by the  hidden mystery of Thy providence, and didst set those shameful errors of  mine before my face, that I might see and hate them.    For after it was clear that he was ignorant of those arts in which I  thought he excelled, I began to despair of his opening and solving the  difficulties which perplexed me (of which indeed however ignorant, he  might have held the truths of piety, had he not been a Manichee). For  their books are fraught with prolix fables, of the heaven, and stars,  sun, and moon, and I now no longer thought him able satisfactorily to  decide what I much desired, whether, on comparison of these things with  the calculations I had elsewhere read, the account given in the books of  Manichaeus were preferable, or at least as good. Which when I proposed  to be considered and discussed, he, so far modestly, shrunk from the  burthen. For he knew that he knew not these things, and was not ashamed  to confess it. For he was not one of those talking persons, many of whom  I had endured, who undertook to teach me these things, and said nothing.  But this man had a heart, though not right towards Thee, yet neither  altogether treacherous to himself. For he was not altogether ignorant of  his own ignorance, nor would he rashly be entangled in a dispute, whence  he could neither retreat nor extricate himself fairly. Even for this I  liked him the better. For fairer is the modesty of a candid mind, than  the knowledge of those things which I desired; and such I found him, in  all the more difficult and subtile questions.    My zeal for the writings of Manichaeus being thus blunted, and  despairing yet more of their other teachers, seeing that in divers  things which perplexed me, he, so renowned among them, had so turned  out; I began to engage with him in the study of that literature, on  which he also was much set (and which as rhetoric-reader I was at that  time teaching young students at Carthage), and to read with him, either  what himself desired to hear, or such as I judged fit for his genius.  But all my efforts whereby I had purposed to advance in that sect,  upon knowledge of that man, came utterly to an end; not that I detached  myself from them altogether, but as one finding nothing better, I had  settled to be content meanwhile with what I had in whatever way fallen  upon, unless by chance something more eligible should dawn upon me.  Thus, that Faustus, to so many a snare of death, had now neither willing  nor witting it, begun to loosen that wherein I was taken. For Thy hands,  O my God, in the secret purpose of Thy providence, did not forsake my  soul; and out of my mother's heart's blood, through her tears night and  day poured out, was a sacrifice offered for me unto Thee; and Thou didst  deal with me by wondrous ways. Thou didst it, O my God: for the steps  of a man are ordered by the Lord, and He shall dispose his way. Or how  shall we obtain salvation, but from Thy hand, re-making what it made?    Thou didst deal with me, that I should be persuaded to go to Rome, and  to teach there rather, what I was teaching at Carthage. And how I was  persuaded to this, I will not neglect to confess to Thee; because herein  also the deepest recesses of Thy wisdom, and Thy most present mercy to  us, must be considered and confessed. I did not wish therefore to go to  Rome, because higher gains and higher dignities were warranted me by my  friends who persuaded me to this (though even these things had at that  time an influence over my mind), but my chief and almost only reason  was, that I heard that young men studied there more peacefully, and were  kept quiet under a restraint of more regular discipline; so that they  did not, at their pleasures, petulantly rush into the school of  one whose pupils they were not, nor were even admitted without his  permission. Whereas at Carthage there reigns among the scholars a most  disgraceful and unruly licence. They burst in audaciously, and  with gestures almost frantic, disturb all order which any one hath  established for the good of his scholars. Divers outrages they commit,  with a wonderful stolidity, punishable by law, did not custom uphold  them; that custom evincing them to be the more miserable, in that they  now do as lawful what by Thy eternal law shall never be lawful; and they  think they do it unpunished, whereas they are punished with the very  blindness whereby they do it, and suffer incomparably worse than what  they do. The manners then which, when a student, I would not make my  own, I was fain as a teacher to endure in others: and so I was well  pleased to go where, all that knew it, assured me that the like was not  done. But Thou, my refuge and my portion in the land of the living;  that I might change my earthly dwelling for the salvation of my soul,  at Carthage didst goad me, that I might thereby be torn from it; and at  Rome didst proffer me allurements, whereby I might be drawn thither,  by men in love with a dying life, the one doing frantic, the other  promising vain, things; and, to correct my steps, didst secretly use  their and my own perverseness. For both they who disturbed my quiet were  blinded with a disgraceful frenzy, and they who invited me elsewhere  savoured of earth. And I, who here detested real misery, was there  seeking unreal happiness.    But why I went hence, and went thither, Thou knewest, O God, yet  showedst it neither to me, nor to my mother, who grievously bewailed my  journey, and followed me as far as the sea. But I deceived her, holding  me by force, that either she might keep me back or go with me, and I  feigned that I had a friend whom I could not leave, till he had a fair  wind to sail. And I lied to my mother, and such a mother, and escaped:  for this also hast Thou mercifully forgiven me, preserving me, thus full  of execrable defilements, from the waters of the sea, for the water of  Thy Grace; whereby when I was cleansed, the streams of my mother's eyes  should be dried, with which for me she daily watered the ground under  her face. And yet refusing to return without me, I scarcely persuaded  her to stay that night in a place hard by our ship, where was an Oratory  in memory of the blessed Cyprian. That night I privily departed, but she  was not behind in weeping and prayer. And what, O Lord, was she with so  many tears asking of Thee, but that Thou wouldest not suffer me to sail?  But Thou, in the depth of Thy counsels and hearing the main point of her  desire, regardest not what she then asked, that Thou mightest make me  what she ever asked. The wind blew and swelled our sails, and withdrew  the shore from our sight; and she on the morrow was there, frantic with  sorrow, and with complaints and groans filled Thine ears, Who didst then  disregard them; whilst through my desires, Thou wert hurrying me to end  all desire, and the earthly part of her affection to me was chastened  by the allotted scourge of sorrows. For she loved my being with her, as  mothers do, but much more than many; and she knew not how great joy Thou  wert about to work for her out of my absence. She knew not; therefore  did she weep and wail, and by this agony there appeared in her the  inheritance of Eve, with sorrow seeking what in sorrow she had brought  forth. And yet, after accusing my treachery and hardheartedness, she  betook herself again to intercede to Thee for me, went to her wonted  place, and I to Rome.    And lo, there was I received by the scourge of bodily sickness, and I  was going down to hell, carrying all the sins which I had committed,  both against Thee, and myself, and others,"]]]
