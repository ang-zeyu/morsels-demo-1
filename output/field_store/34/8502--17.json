After  examining it the lawyer said, \"Do you expect any painter will go to  heaven if they make such charges as these?\"--\"I never heard of but one  that went,\" said the painter, \"and he behaved so badly that they  determined to turn him out, but there being no lawyer present to draw up  the Writ of Ejectment, he remained.\"    This must be the lawyer who, being refused entrance to heaven by St.  Peter, contrived to throw his hat inside the door; and then, being  permitted to go and fetch it, took advantage of the Saint being fixed to  his post as doorkeeper and refused to come back again.    A solicitor who was known to occasionally exceed the limit at lunch  betrayed so much unsteadiness that the magistrate quickly observed, \"I  think, Mr. ----, you are not quite well, perhaps you had a little too  much wine at lunch.\"--\"Quite a mistake, your worship,\" hiccoughed Mr.  ----. \"It was brandy and water.\"    The son-in-law of a Chancery barrister having succeeded to the lucrative  practice of the latter, came one morning in breathless haste to inform  him that he had succeeded in bringing nearly to its termination a cause  which had been pending in the Court for several years. Instead of  obtaining the expected congratulations of the retired veteran of the  law, his intelligence was received with indignation. \"It was by this  suit,\" exclaimed he, \"that my father was enabled to provide for me, and  to portion your wife, and with the exercise of common prudence it would  have furnished you with the means of providing handsomely for your  children and grandchildren.\"          CHAPTER THREE    THE JUDGES OF IRELAND          \"So slow is justice in its ways        Beset by more than customary clogs,      Going to law in these expensive days        Is much the same as going to the dogs.\"        WILLOCK: _Legal Facetiae_.          CHAPTER THREE    THE JUDGES OF IRELAND      In the days of Queen Anne corruption was rife among Irish judges, as it  was also among members of the Scottish Bench at an earlier period, and  it was not uncommon to find the former concurring in Privy Council  reports issued contrary to evidence. Within the area of the Munster  Circuit in the early years of the eighteenth century a petition was  signed and presented to Parliament by clergy, resident gentry, and  others in the district, because Lord Chancellor Phipps refused to be  influenced in his decision of cases coming before him, and had thereby  incurred the displeasure of a certain section of the Irish Parliament.  Even a Lord Chief Justice was not above taking a gift; and in this  connection O'Flanagan in _The Munster Circuit_ tells a story of Chief  Justice Pyne, who was a great cattle-breeder and owner of valuable  stock. One day before starting for Cork Assizes to try a case in which a  Mr. Weller and a Mr. Nangle were concerned, he received a visit from the  former's steward, who had been sent with a herd of twenty-five splendid  heifers for his lordship. The judge was highly pleased, and returned by  the steward a gracious message of thanks to his master. On the way to  Cork the Chief Justice's coach was stopped by a drove of valuable  shorthorns on the road. Looking out, his lordship demanded of the  drover, \"Whose beasts are these, my man?\"--\"They belong, please your  honour, to a great gentleman of these parts, Judge Pyne, your honour,\"  replied the man. \"Indeed,\" cried the Chief Justice in much surprise,  \"and where are you taking them now?\"--\"They are grazing in my master Mr.  Nangle's farm, your honour; and as the Assizes are coming on at Cork my  master thought the judge might like to see that he took good care of  them, so I'm taking them to Waterpark (his lordship's estate) to show to  the judge.\" The judge felt the delicacy of Mr. Nangle's mode of giving  his present, and putting a guinea in the drover's hand said, \"As your  master has taken such good care of my cattle, I will take care of him.\"  When the case came on it appeared at first that the judge favoured the  plaintiff, Mr. Weller, but as it proceeded he changed his views and  finally decided for the defendant, Mr. Nangle. On arriving home the  judge's first question was, \"Are the cattle all safe?\"--\"Perfectly, my  lord.\"--\"Where are the beasts I received on leaving for the Cork  Assizes?\"--\"They are where you left them, my lord.\"--\"Where I left  them--that is impossible,\" exclaimed the judge. \"I left them on the  road.\" The steward looked puzzled. \"I'll have a look at them myself,\"  said Chief Justice Pyne. The steward led the way, and pointed out the  twenty-five fine heifers presented by Mr. Weller, the plaintiff. \"But  where are the shorthorns that came after I left home?\"--\"Bedad, the  long and the short of it is, them's all the cattle on the land, except  what we have bred ourselves, my lord.\" And so it was. Mr. Nangle, the  defendant, had so arranged his gift to meet the judge on the road, but  as soon as his lordship's coach was out of sight the cattle were driven  back to their familiar fields. The Chief Justice had been outwitted and  had no power of showing resentment.    In the manners and customs of the legal profession of Ireland in the  latter part of the eighteenth century, there is also a strong similarity  between the members of the Scottish Bench and their Irish brethren, in  that they were heavy port drinkers; and did not hesitate to indulge in  it while sitting on the Bench. It is reported of one Irish judge that he  had a specially constructed metal tube like a penholder, through which  he sucked his favourite liquor, from what appeared to the audience to be  a metal inkstand. Another judge on being asked if, at a social  gathering, he had seen a learned brother dance, \"Yes,\" he replied, \"I  saw him in a _reel_\"; while Curran referring to a third judge, who had  condemned a prisoner to death, said, \"He did not weep, but he had a drop  in his eye.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Unblushing effrontery and a bronzed visage gained for John Scott (Lord  Clonmel) while at the Bar the sobriquet of \"Copper-faced Jack.\" He took  the popular side in politics, which ordinarily would not have led to  promotion in his profession; but his outstanding ability attracted the  attention of Lord Chancellor Lifford, and through his influence Scott  was offered a place under the Government. On accepting it at the hands  of Lord Townshend, he said, \"My lord, you have spoiled a good patriot.\"  Some time after he met Flood, a co-patriot, and addressed him: \"Well, I  suppose you will be abusing me as usual.\" To which Flood replied: \"When  I began to abuse you, you were a briefless barrister; by abuse I made  you counsel to the revenue, by abuse I got you a silk gown, by abuse I  made you Solicitor-General, by abuse I may make you Chief Justice. No,  Scott, I'll praise you.\"    When Lord Clonmel was Lord Chief Justice he upheld the undignified  practice of demanding a shilling for administering an oath, and used to  be well satisfied, provided the coin was a _good one_. In his time the  Birmingham shilling was current, and he used the following extraordinary  precautions to avoid being imposed upon by taking a bad one. \"You shall  true answer make to such questions as shall be demanded of you touching  this affidavit, so help you God! _Is this a good shilling?_ Are the  contents of this affidavit true? Is this your name and handwriting?\"           *       *       *       *       *    The family of Henn belonging to Clare have been, generation after  generation, since the first of the name became Chief Baron in 1679,  connected with the Irish Bench and Bar. William Henn, a descendant of  the Chief Baron, was made a Judge of the King's Bench in 1767, and when  on Circuit at Wexford in 1789 two young barristers contended before him  with great zeal and pertinacity, each flatly contradicting the other as  to the law of the case; and both at each turn of the argument again and  again referred with exemplary confidence to the learned judge, as so  well knowing that what was said by him (the speaker) was right. The  judge said, \"Well, gentlemen, can I settle this matter between you? You,  sir, say positively the law is one way; and you, sir (turning to the  opponent), as unequivocally say it is the other way. I wish to God,  Billy Harris (leaning over and addressing the registrar who sat beneath  him), I knew what the law really was!\"--\"My lord,\" replied Billy Harris,  rising, and turning round with great gravity and respect, \"if I  possessed that knowledge, I assure your lordship that I would tell your  lordship with great pleasure!\"--\"Then,\" exclaimed the judge, \"we'll save  the point, Billy Harris!\"    Although more appropriate in the following chapter, we may here  introduce a story of the younger son of the Judge Henn of the previous  story. Jonathan, who was more distinguished than his elder  brother--another Judge Henn--did not attain to the Bench. In early  years he was indifferent whether briefs were given him or not, and  indeed on one occasion he is said to have sent a message to the  Attorney-General, who had called to engage him in a case, to keep \"his  d--d brief and to take himself to the d--l.\" But later he became very  industrious, and his natural ability soon brought him into a large and  lucrative practice. He was counsel for the Government at the trial of  John Mitchell, and at its close the wags of the Court declared that  \"Judge Moore _spoke_ to the evidence, but Jonathan Henn _charged the  jury_.\"           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: HUGH CARLETON, VISCOUNT CARLETON, LORD CHIEF JUSTICE OF  IRELAND.]    Chief Justice Carleton was a most lugubrious judge, and was always  complaining of something or other, but chiefly about"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3003"],[0,"Wild Flowers (#15)"],[1,"ivid, shining  brownish purple within; borne in almost leafless terminal  clusters on slender stems; Calyx 5-parted.; corolla of 5 rounded  lobes, the 2 upper ones erect, side ones ascending, lower one  bent downward; 5 staroens, 4 of them twin-like and bearing  anthers, the fifth sterile, a mere scale on roof of the globular  corolla tube; style with knot-like stigma. Stem: From 3 to 10 ft.  high, square, with grooved sides, widely. branching. Leaves: From  3 to 12 in. long, oblong, pointed, coarsely toothed, on slender  stems, strong smelling.  Preferred Habitat - Moist, shady ground.  Flowering Season - July-September.  Distribution - New York to the Carolinas, westward to Tennessee  and Kansas; possibly beyond.    An insignificant little flower by itself, conspicuous only  because it rears itself in clusters on a level with one's eyes,  lacking beauty, perfume, and all that makes a blossom charming to  the human mind - why has it been elevated by the botanists to the  dignity of lending its name to a large and important family, and  why is it mentioned at all in a popular flower book beside the  more showy ornaments of nature's garden? Both questions have the  same answer: Because it is the typical flower of the family, and  therefore serves as an illustration of the manner in which many  others are fertilized. Beautiful blossoms are by no means always  the most important ones.    It well repays one to observe the relative times of maturing  anthers and stigmas in the flowers, as thereby hangs a tale in  which some insect plays an interesting role. The figwort matures  its stigma at the lip of the style before its anthers have  ripened their pollen. Why? By having the stigma of a newly opened  flower thrust forward to the mouth of the corolla, an insect  alighting on the lip, which forms his only convenient landing  place, must brush against it and leave upon it some pollen  brought from an older flower, whose anthers are already matured.  At this early stage of the flower's development its stamens lie  curved over in the tube of the corolla; but presently, as the  already fertilized style begins to wither, and its stigma is dry  and no longer receptive to pollen, then, since there can be no  longer any fear of self-pollination - the horror of so many  flowers - the figwort uncurls and elevates its stamens. The  insect visitor in search of nectar must get dusted with pollen  from the late maturing anthers now ready for him. By this  ingenious method the flower becomes cross-fertilized and wastes  the least pollen.    Bees and wasps evidently pursue opposite routes in going to work,  the former beginning at the bottom of a spike or raceme, where  the older, more mature flowers are, and working upward; the wasps  commencing at the top, among the newly opened ones. In spite of  the fact that we usually see hive bees about this plant,  pilfering the generous supply of nectar in each tiny cup, it is  undoubtedly the wasp that is the flower's truest benefactor,  since he carries pollen from the older blossoms of the last  raceme visited to the projecting stigmas of the newly opened  flowers at the top of the next cluster. Manifestly no flower,  even though it were especially adapted to wasps, as this one is,  could exclude bees. About one-third of all its visitors are  wasps.      HAIRY BEARD-TONGUE    (Pentstemon hirsutus; P. pubescens of Gray)  Figwort family    Flowers - Dull violet or lilac and white, about 1 in. long, borne  in a loose spike. Calyx 5-parted, the sharply pointed sepals  overlapping; corolla, a gradually inflated tube widening where  the mouth divides into a 2-lobed upper lip and a 3-lobed lower  lip; the throat nearly closed by hairy palate at base of lower  lip; sterile fifth stamen densely bearded for half its length; 4  anther-bearing stamens, the anthers divergent. Stem: 1 to 3 ft.  high, erect, downy above. Leaves: Oblong to lance shape, upper  ones seated on stem; lower ones narrowed into petioles.  Preferred Habitat - Dry or rocky fields, thickets, and open  woods.  Flowering Season - May-July.  Distribution - Ontario to Florida, Manitoba to Texas.    It is the densely bearded, yellow, fifth stamen (pente =five,  stemon = a stamen) which gives this flower its scientific name  and its chief interest to the structural botanist. From the fact  that a blossom has a lip in the center of the lower half of its  corolla, that an insect must use as its landing place, comes the  necessity for the pistil to occupy a central position. Naturally,  a fifth stamen would be only in its way, an encumbrance to be  banished in time. In the figwort, for example, we have seen the  fifth stamen reduced, from long sterility, to a mere scale on the  roof of the corolla tube in other lipped flowers, the useless  organ has disappeared; but in the beard-tongue, it goes through a  series of curious curves from the upper to the under side of the  flower to get out of the way of the pistil. Yet it serves an  admirable purpose in helping close the mouth of the flower, which  the hairy lip alone could not adequately guard against pilferers.  A long-tongued bee, thrusting in his head up to his eyes only,  receives the pollen in his face. The blossom is male (staminate)  in its first stage and female (pistillate) in its second.    While this is the beard-tongue commonly found in the Eastern  United States, particularly southward, and one of the most  beautiful of its clan, the western species have been selected by  the gardeners for hybridizing into those more showy, but often  less charming, flowers now quite extensively cultivated. Several  varieties of these, having escaped from gardens in the East, are  locally common wild.    The LARGE-FLOWERED BEARD-TONGUE (P. grandiflorus), one of the  finest prairie species, whose lavender-blue, bell-shaped corolla  is abruptly dilated above the calyx, measures nearly two inches  long. Its sterile filament, curved over at the summit, is bearded  there only.    Handsomest of all is the COBEA BEARD-TONGUE, a native of the  Southwest, with a broadly rounded, bell-shaped corolla, hairy  without, like the leaves, but smooth within. The pale purple  blossom, delicately suffused with yellow, and pencilled with red  lines - pathfinders for the bees - has the base of its tube  creamy white. Few flowers hang from each stout clammy spike.    The more densely crowded spikes of the large SMOOTH BEARD-TONGUE  (P. glaber), a smaller blue or purple flowered, narrower-leaved  species, that shows an unusual preference for moist soil  throughout its range, is, like the other beard-tongues mentioned,  better known to the British gardener, perhaps, than to Americans,  who have yet to learn the value of many of their wild flowers  under cultivation.    The tall FOXGLOVE BEARD-TONGUE (P. digitalis), with large, showy  white blossoms tinged with purple, the one most commonly grown in  gardens here, escapes on the slightest encouragement to run wild  again from Maine to Virginia, west to Illinois and Arkansas.  Small bees crawl into the broad tube, and butterflies drain the  nectar evidently secreted for long-tongued bees, but without  certainly transferring pollen. To insure cross-fertilization, the  flower first develops its anthers, whose saw-edges grating  against the visitors thorax, aid in sifting out the dry pollen;  and later the style, which when immature clung to the top of the  corolla, lowers its receptive stigma to oppose the bee's  entrance. Professor Robertson has frequently detected the common  wasp nipping holes with her sharp jaws in the base of the tube.  With remarkable intelligence she invariably chose to insert her  tongue at the precise spots where the nectar is stored on either  side of the sterile filament.      BLUE-EYED MARY; INNOCENCE; BROAD-LEAVED COLLINSIA    (Collinsia verna)  Figwort family    Flowers - On slender, weak stalks; whorled in axils of upper  leaves. Blue on lower lip of corolla, its middle lobe folded  lengthwise to enclose 4 adhering stamens and pistil; upper lip  white, with scalloped margins; corolla from 1/2 to 3/4 in. long,  its throat about equaling the deeply 5-cleft calyx. Stem: Hoary,  slender, simple or branched, from 6 in. to 2 ft. high. Leaves:  Thin, opposite; upper and more acute ones clasping the stem;  lower, ovate ones on short petioles. Fruit: A round capsule to  which the enlarged calyx adheres.  Preferred Habitat - Moist meadows, woods, and thickets. Flowering  Season - April-June.  Distribution - Western New York and Pennsylvania to Wisconsin,  Kentucky, and Indian Territory.    Next of kin to the great Paulonia tree, whose deliciously sweet,  vanilla-scented, trumpet-shaped violet flowers are happily fast  becoming as common here as in their native Japan, what has this  fragile, odorless blossom of the meadows in common with it?  Apparently nothing; but superficial appearances count for little  or nothing among scientists, to whom the structure of floral  organs is of prime importance; and analysis instantly shows the  close relationship between these dissimilar-looking cousins. Even  without analysis one can readily see that the monkey flower is  not far removed.    Because few writers have arisen as yet in the newly settled  regions of the middle West and Southwest, where blue-eyed Mary  dyes acres of meadow land with her heavenly color, her praises  are little sung in the books, but are loudly buzzed by myriads of  bees that are her most devoted lovers. \"I regard the flower as  especially adapted to the early flying bees with abdominal  collecting brushes for pollen - i.e., species of Osmia - and  these bees,\" says Professor Robertson of Illinois, \"although not  the exclusive visitors, are far more abundant and important than  all the other visitors together.\" For them are the brownish marks  on the palate provided as pathfinders. At the pressure of their  strong heads the palate yields to give them entrance, and at  their removal "]]]
