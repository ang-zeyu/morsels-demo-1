Many fruits, moreover, have a  magnificent fragrance which lends to their agreeable taste. It is  somewhat of a pity that fruit is not more ordinarily eaten at meals,  particularly with the breakfast. There is an old proverb that fruit is  gold in the morning, silver at noon, and lead at night; and it is  undoubtedly a fact that it is especially beneficial when eaten early in  the day. In France, fruit is a constant part of every meal, and there  is no question but that such a proceeding is desirable. It was formerly  the custom with English people at regular dinners to have dessert on  the table all through the courses, but it is now more customary to  present it at the termination of the repast, so that it is quite fresh  and not saturated with odours absorbed from the soup, fish, etc.    The agreeable qualities of fruits may be said to reside in three  different factors. First, there is the proportion of sugar, gum,  pectin, etc., to free acid; next, the proportion of soluble to  insoluble matters; and thirdly, the aroma, which, indeed, is no  inconsiderable element therein. This latter quality--the aroma,  fragrance, or perfume of fruit--is due to the existence of delicate  and exquisite ethers. These subtle ethers Are often accompanied by  essential oils, which may render the aroma more penetrating and  continued. Those fruits like the peach, greengage, and mulberry, which  almost melt in the mouth, contain a very large amount of soluble  substances. Some fruits, like the peach and apricot, carry but a small  amount of sugar as compared with the free acid they contain. Yet the  free acid is not distinctly perceptible, because its taste is covered  by a larger proportion of gum, pectin, and other gelatinous substances.  There are other fruits again, such as the currant and gooseberry, which  are markedly acid, because there is only a small amount of gum and  pectin, and a relatively larger amount of free acid.    With regard to fruit when eaten in its raw state, the question  of ripeness is a most important ones and is always to be considered; so  that whatever views may be entertained as to the dietetic value of ripe  fruit, there is a consensus of opinion on the fact that when unripe it  is most injurious. Care must be taken, therefore, to see that it is  perfectly ripe, and no considerations of economy must be allowed to  over-ride the fact. At the same time, though ripeness is a necessary  qualification of wholesomeness, yet fruit must not be over-ripe, as  changes occur which render it undesirable for the system, and thus in  avoiding Scylla we may fall into Charybdis. The skin of fruit should  never be eaten, nor should the stones, pips, or seeds be swallowed, as  there is a danger of their accumulating in a small pouch of the bowel  known as the vermiform appendix. Their lodgment in this little pocket  is a constant source of peril, and would soon set up an inflammation,  which must always be attended with a considerable amount of danger.    As to the question of the unripeness or over-ripeness of fruit, the  following remarks by Dr. F.W. Pavy, an acknowledged authority on all  that relates to food, and worth recording:--\"Fruit forms an agreeable  and refreshing kind of food, and, eaten in moderate quantity, exerts a  favourable influence as an article of diet. It is chiefly of service  for the carbo-hydrates, vegetable acids, and alkaline salts it  contains. It enjoys, too, in a high degree, the power of counteracting  the unhealthy state found to be induced by too close a restriction to  dried and salted provisions. Whilst advantageous when consumed in  moderate quantity, fruit, on the other hand, proves injurious if eaten  in excess. Of a highly succulent nature, and containing free acids and  principles liable to undergo change, it is apt, when ingested out of  due proportion to other food, to act as a disturbing element, and  excite derangement of the alimentary canal. This is particularly  likely to occur if eaten either in the unripe or over-ripe state; in  the former case, from the quantity of acid present; in the latter, from  its strong tendency to ferment and decompose within the digestive  tract. The prevalence of stomach and bowel disorders, noticeable during  the height of the fruit season, affords proof of the inconveniences  that the too free use of fruit may give rise to.\"    The different forms of fruit, and also of vegetables, owe their great  value to the fact that they possess powerful anti-scorbutic properties.  It will be best and simplest to define the word \"anti-scorbutic\" as  \"good against the scurvy.\" This latter disease is notably dependent on  a want of fresh fruit and vegetables in the dietary, and consequently  is more often observed amongst sailors; and though accessory  conditions, such as great privations, bad provisions, or unhealthy  surroundings, may predispose to it, yet that which essentially produces  it is the deficiency of the former articles from the food. At the  present time it is not nearly so frequently seen, since, according to  the mercantile marine regulations, subject to legislative enactments  passed in 1867, in lieu of vegetables, one ounce of lime juice,  sweetened with the same quantity of sugar, must be served out to each  man daily.    In scurvy there is some great change effected in the blood, and it is  as well to refer briefly to the characters possessed by the latter. The  blood as it exists in the body is a red alkaline fluid, having a  saltish taste and possessing quite a noticeable odour. It consists of  minute bodies, the corpuscles, immersed in a liquid, the LIQUOR  SANGUINIS. Salts also enter into its composition, and include the  chlorides of potash and soda; the phosphates of lime, magnesia,-and  soda; the sulphate of potash, and free soda. Of these the salts of soda  predominate, and the chloride--that is, common salt--is  usually in excess of all the others. The uses of these salts in the  blood are to supply the different tissues with the salts they  respectively require, to take part in maintaining the proper specific  gravity and alkaline character of the blood, and to prevent any changes  going on within it.    In scurvy, as mentioned before, the blood seems to undergo some great  change, and there are accumulations of it beneath the skin. The gums  become spongy, bleeding on the slightest touch, and the teeth  frequently loosen. Blood often flows from the mouth and nose, or is  vomited from the stomach, or is passed through the bowels. Dr. Garrod  advanced the view that scurvy was dependent on a deficiency of potash  in the stem, and that vegetables which contained potash supplied the  want. It is questionable, however, whether the disease is due to this  fact alone, since beef tea, which contains a good deal of potash, may  be given freely to a scorbutic patient, yet he fails to recover till  proper anti-scorbutic diet is supplied. Dr. Ralfe found by experiments  that when acids are injected into the blood, or an excess of acid salts  administered, the same changes occur in the blood as in scurvy. Hence  he supposes that the latter disease is caused by a decrease in the  alkalinity of the blood, which results from the absence of fruit and  vegetables from the food.    Now, although characteristic cases of scurvy are as a rule to be met  with chiefly in sailors, yet there is no doubt that an insufficiency of  the preceding in the dietary brings about an unhealthy condition of the  system. Many typical examples of this are frequently seen in the  patients admitted into our hospitals. They have been living, perhaps,  in isolated districts in the country, where their sole food was mutton  and damper, with no restriction placed on tea and tobacco. As a  rule their skin presents evidences of the need of proper diet, for it  looks unhealthy and is often covered with boils. But apart from these  cases, which so plainly indicate the origin of the poor condition of  the blood, there are many instances in which, from the want of  vegetable food and fruit, the system becomes greatly deranged.  moreover, what is known as the blood being \"out of order\" is mostly due  to an unsuitable diet, consisting of animal food in excess, and a  corresponding deficiency of the other essentials.    The use of fruit, again, is especially indicated in persons disposed to  the formation of uric acid in excess. When this actually occurs, the  system becomes overloaded with deleterious matter, and the blood and  body fluids are then saturated with a MATERIES MORBI. This morbific  material is best understood by regarding it as being in an incomplete  or half-way stage, in which form it is injurious. But, on the other  hand, if it had proceeded to its final change, the completed product  would have been harmless. Indeed, it is as the latter that it mostly  leaves the body in ordinary conditions of health. Well then, the  retention within the system of this incompletely transformed material  gives rise to various symptoms. One of them is a bitter or \"coppery\"  taste in the mouth, notably in the early morning. Oftentimes, too,  patients will complain that they do not feel at all refreshed on  rising, even when they have slept fairly well--which does not happen  too frequently. There may be also a great tendency to drowsiness,  accompanied by severe pains in the limbs, coming on about an hour after  meals. Other symptoms which are commonly met with are great  irritability of the temper and lowness of spirits. There is frequently  a headache of a peculiar kind. It comes on generally in the morning,  and may last all day, or even for several days. It is a dull, heavy  pain, felt most often in the forehead. A curious feature of the  affection which sometimes exists is an incontrollable desire to grind  the teeth during the waking hours.

LECTURE III.    TRANSGRESSION AND THE FALL.         =Article 2.=--We believe that men will be punished for their own       sins, and not for Adam's transgression.      TRANSGRESSION AND ITS RESULTS.    =1. Man's Free Agency.=--The Church holds and teaches as a strictly  scriptural doctrine, that man has inherited among the inalienable  rights conferred upon him by his divine Father, absolute freedom to  choose the good or the evil in life as he may elect. This right cannot  be guarded with more jealous care than is bestowed upon it by God  Himself; for in all His dealings with man, He has left the mortal  creature free to choose and to act, with no semblance of compulsion or  restraint, beyond the influences of paternal counsel and loving  direction.[119] True, He has given commandments, and has established  statutes, with promises of blessings for compliance and dire penalties  for infraction; but in the choice of these, God's children are  untrammeled. In this respect, man is no less free than are the angels  and the Gods, except as he has fettered himself with the bonds of sin,  and forfeited his power of will and force of soul. The individual has  as full a measure of liberty to violate the laws of health, the  requirements of nature, and the commandments of God in matters both  temporal and spiritual, as he has to obey all such; in the one case he  brings upon himself the sure penalties that belong to the broken law;  as in the other he inherits the specific blessings and the added  freedom that attend a law-abiding life. Obedience to law is the habit  of the free man; 'tis the transgressor who fears the law, for he  brings upon himself deprivation and restraint, not because of the law,  which would have protected him in his freedom, but because of his  antagonism to law.      [119] See Note 1.    =2.= The predominant attribute of justice, recognized as part of the  Divine nature, forbids the thought that man should receive promises of  reward for righteousness, and threats of punishment for evil deeds, if  he possessed no power of independent action. It is no more a part of  God's plan to compel men to work righteousness, than it is His purpose  to permit evil powers to force His children into sin. In the days of  Eden, the first man had placed before him commandment and law,[120]  with an explanation of the penalty which would follow a violation of  that law. No law could have been given him in righteousness had he not  been free to act for himself. \"Nevertheless thou mayest choose for  thyself, for it is given unto thee, but remember that I forbid  it,\"[121] said the Lord God to Adam. Concerning His dealings with the  first patriarch of the race, God has declared in this day, \"Behold, I  gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself.\"[122]      [120] Genesis ii, 17; Pearl of Great Price, Moses ii, 27-29; iii,    15-17.      [121] Pearl of Great Price, Moses iii, 17.      [122] Doctrine and Covenants, xxix, 35.    =3.= When the brothers Cain and Abel brought their sacrifices before  the Lord, the elder one became angry because his offering was  rejected; then the Lord reasoned with Cain, and endeavored to teach  him that he must expect results of his actions to follow in kind, good  or evil, as he might elect:--\"If thou doest well, shalt thou not be  accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door.\"[123]      [123] Genesis iv, 7.    =4.= A knowledge of good and evil is essential to the advancement  which God has made possible for His children to achieve; this  knowledge can be best gained by actual experience, with the contrasts  of good and its opposite before the eyes; therefore has man been  placed upon the earth subject to the influence of good and wicked  powers, with a knowledge of the conditions surrounding him, and the  heaven-born right to choose for himself. The words of the prophet,  Lehi, are particularly explicit: \"Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto  man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for  himself, save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the  other.... Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all  things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free  to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great mediation of all  men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and  power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable  like unto himself.\"[124]      [124] II Nephi ii, 16 and 27; x, 23. See also Alma iii, 26; xii,    31; xxix, 4, 5; xxx, 9; Hel. xiv, 30.    =5.= Alma, another Nephite prophet, in speaking of those who had died,  said they had gone \"that they might reap their rewards, according to  their works, whether they were good or whether they were bad, to reap  eternal happiness or eternal misery, according to the spirit which  they listed to obey, whether it be a good spirit or a bad one; For  every man receiveth wages of him whom he listeth to obey, and this  according to the words of the spirit of prophecy.\"[125]      [125] Alma iii, 26-27.    =6.= Samuel, the converted Lamanite, upon whom the spirit of the  prophets had fallen, admonished his wayward fellows in this wise: \"And  now remember, remember my brethren, that whosoever perisheth,  perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto  himself; for behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for  yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge, and He  hath made you free; He hath given unto you that ye might know good  from evil, and He hath given unto you that ye might choose life or  death.\"[126]      [126] Helaman xiv, 30-31.    =7.= When the plans for creating and peopling the earth were under  discussion in heaven, Satan sought to destroy the free agency of man,  by obtaining power to force the human family to do his will, promising  the Father that by such means he would redeem all mankind, and that  not one of them should be lost.[127] This proposition was rejected,  while the original purpose of the Father,--to use persuasive  influences of wholesome precept and sacrificing example with the  inhabitants of the earth, then to leave them free to choose for  themselves, was agreed upon, and the Only Begotten Son was chosen as  the chief instrument in carrying that purpose into effect.      [127] Moses iv. 1; see also Abraham iii, 27-28; and \"Jesus the    Christ,\" ch. ii.    =8. Man's Responsibility= for his individual acts is as complete as is  his agency to elect for himself. The natural result of good deeds is  happiness; the consequence of evil is misery; these follow in every  man's life by inviolable laws. There is a plan of judgment[128]  divinely fore-ordained, by which every man will be called to answer  for his deeds; and not for deeds alone but for his words also, and  even for the thoughts of his heart. \"But I say unto you, that every  idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the  day of judgment.\"[129] These are the words of the Savior Himself. \"And  let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbor, and  love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith the  Lord.\"[130] John the Revelator was permitted to learn in vision  something of the scenes connected with the last judgment; he says:  \"And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books  were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life;  and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the  books, according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which  were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in  them: and they were judged every man according to their works.\"[131]      [128] Matt. x, 15; xi, 22; II Peter ii, 9; iii, 7; I John iv, 17.      [129] Matt. xii, 36.      [130] Zech. viii, 17.      [131] Rev. xx, 12, 13.    =9.= The judgment of God is not always made to follow immediately the  acts of men; good deeds may not be at once rewarded, evil is rarely  peremptorily punished; and this is according to Divine wisdom; were it  appointed otherwise, the test of individual nature, and the trial of  human faith, for which purposes this mortal probation was primarily  ordained, would be greatly lessened; for the certainty of immediate  pleasure or pain would almost universally determine human acts to  secure the one and to avoid the other. Judgment, therefore, is  postponed, that every one may fully prove his nature, the good man  increasing in righteousness, and the evil doer possessing opportunity  of repentance and reparation before the great and terrible day. On  rare occasions, speedy judgment of a temporal nature has been  executed, the physical results of worldly blessing for good,[132] and  calamity for evil deeds[133]"]]]
