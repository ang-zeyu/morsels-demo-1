He freed his arm quickly, and, regardless of the clawing thing that tore  at his face and eyes, he launched one long swing for the horrible face  above him. He saw the awkward fall of a lean body, and he swayed  helplessly out to follow when the grip of Sykes' hand pulled him back  and up to momentary safety.    McGuire's mind held only the desire to kill, and he would have begun a  staggering rush toward the shrieking mob that broke from the cover  behind them, had not Sykes held him fast. At sight of the weapon, their  own gas projector, still clutched in the flyer's hand, the pursuers  halted. Their long arms pointed and their shrill calls joined in a  chorus that quavered and fell uncertainly.           *       *       *       *       *    One, braver than the rest, dashed forward and discharged his weapon. The  spurting gas failed to reach its intended victims; it blew gently back  toward the others who fled quickly to either side. Above the trees a  giant ship nosed swiftly down, and McGuire pointed to it grimly and in  silence. The men before them were massed now for a rush.    \"This is the end,\" said the flyer softly. \"I wonder how this devilish  thing works; there's a trigger here. I will give them a shot with the  wind helping, then we'll jump for it.\"    The ship was above them as the slim figure of Lieutenant McGuire threw  itself a score of paces toward the waiting group. From the metal tube  there shot a stream of pale vapor that swept downward upon the others  who ran in panic from its touch.    Then back--and a grip of a hand!--and two Earth-men who threw themselves  out and downward from a sheer rock wall to the cool embrace of deep  water.    They came to the top, battered from their fall, but able to dive under a  wave and emerge again near one another.    \"Swim!\" urged Sykes. \"Swim out! They may get us here--recover our  bodies--resuscitate us. And that wouldn't do!\"    Another wave, and the two men were swimming beyond it; swimming feebly  but steadily out from shore, while above them a great cylinder of  shining metal swept past in a circling flight. They kept on while their  eyes, from the wave tops, saw it turn and come slowly back in a long  smooth descent.    It was a hundred feet above the water a short way out at sea, and the  two men made feeble motions with arms and legs, while their eyes  exchanged glances of dismay.           *       *       *       *       *    A door had opened in the round under-surface, and a figure, whose  gas-suit made it a bloated caricature of a man, was lowered from beneath  in a sling. From the stern of the ship gaseous vapor belched downward to  spread upon the surface of the water. The wind was bringing the misty  cloud toward them. \"The gas!\" said McGuire despairingly. \"It will knock  us out, and then that devil will get us! They'll take us back! Our last  chance--gone!\"    \"God help us!\" said Sykes weakly. \"We can't--even--die--\" His feeble  strokes stopped, and he sank beneath the water. McGuire's last picture  as he too sank and the waters closed over his head, was the shining ship  hovering beyond.    He wondered only vaguely at the sudden whirling of water around him. A  solid something was rising beneath his dragging feet; a firm, solid  support that raised him again to the surface. He realized dimly the air  about him, the sodden form of Professor Sykes some few feet distant. His  numbed brain was trying to comprehend what else the eyes beheld.    A metal surface beneath them rose higher, shining wet, above the water;  a metal tube raised suddenly from its shield, to swing in quick aim upon  the enemy ship approaching from above.    His eyes moved to the ship, and to the man-thing below in the sling. Its  clothes were a mass of flame, and the figure itself was falling headlong  through the air. Above the blazing body was the metal of the ship  itself, and it sagged and melted to a liquid fire that poured, splashing  and hissing, to the waters beneath. In the wild panic the great shape  threw itself into the air; it swept out and up in curving flight to  plunge headlong into the depths....    The gas was drifting close, as McGuire saw an opening in the structure  beside him. The voice of a man, human, kindly, befriending, said  something of \"hurry\" and \"gas,\" and \"lift them carefully but make  haste.\" The white faces of men were blurred and indistinct as McGuire  felt himself lowered into a cool room and laid, with the unconscious  form of Sykes, upon a floor.    He tried to remember. He had gone down in the water--Sykes had drowned,  and he himself--he was tired--tired. \"And this,\"--the thought seemed a  certainty in his mind--\"this is death. How--very--peculiar--\" He was  trying to twist his lips to a weak laugh as the lighted ports in the  wall beside him changed from gold to green, then black--and a rushing of  torn waters was in his ears....

Meek_      The trail of mystery gold leads Carnes and Dr. Bird to a    tremendous monster of the deep.    [Illustration: \"_The mass hung over the ship._\"]      \"I beg your pardon, sir. I'm looking for Dr. Bird.\"    The famous Bureau of Standards scientist appraised the speaker rapidly.  Keen blue eyes stared questioningly at him from a mahogany brown face,  criss-crossed with a thousand tiny wrinkles. The tattooed anchor on his  hand and the ill-fitting blue serge suit smacked of the sea while the  squareness of his shoulders and the direct gaze of his eye spoke  eloquently of authority.    \"I'm Dr. Bird, Captain. What can I do for you?\"    \"Thank you, Doctor, but I'm not a captain. My name is Mitchell and I am,  or was, the first mate of the _Arethusa_.\"    \"The _Arethusa_!\" Operative Carnes of the United States Secret Service  sprang to his feet. \"You said the _Arethusa_? There _were_ no  survivors!\"    \"I believe that I am the only one.\"    \"Where have you been hiding and why haven't you reported the fact of  your rescue to the proper authorities? Tell the truth; I'm a federal  officer!\"    Carnes flashed the gold badge of the Secret Service and an expression of  anger crossed Mitchell's face.    \"If I had wished to talk to an officer I could have found plenty in New  York,\" he said shortly. \"I came to Washington in order to tell my story  to Dr. Bird.\"    The seaman and the detective glared at one another for a moment and then  Dr. Bird intervened.    \"Pipe down, Carnes,\" he said softly. \"Mr. Mitchell undoubtedly has  reasons, excellent reasons, for his actions. Sit down, Mr. Mitchell, and  have a cigar.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mitchell accepted the cigar which the doctor proferred and took a chair.  He lighted the weed and after another glance of hostility toward the  detective he pointedly ignored him and addressed his remarks to Dr.  Bird.    \"I have no objection to telling you why I haven't spoken earlier,  Doctor,\" he said. \"When the _Arethusa_ sank, I must have hit my head on  something, for the next thing I knew, I was in the Marine Hospital in  New York. I had been picked up unconscious by a fishing boat and brought  in, and I lay there a week before I knew anything. When I knew what I  was doing I heard about the loss of my ship and was told that there were  no survivors, and I didn't know what to do. The story I had to tell was  so weird and improbable that I hesitated to speak to anyone about it. I  was not sure at first that it was not a trick of a disordered brain, but  since my head has cleared I am convinced of the truth of it ... and yet  I know that it _can't_ be so. I have read about you and some of the  things you have done, and so as soon as I was able to travel I came  here to tell you about it. You will be better able to judge than I,  whether what I tell you really happened or was only a vision.\"    Dr. Bird leaned back in his chair and put the tips of his fingers  together. Long, tapering fingers they were, sensitive and well shaped,  though sadly marred by acid stains. It was in his hands alone that Dr.  Bird showed the genius in his make-up, the artistry which inspired him  to produce those miracles of experimentation which had made his name a  household word in the realm of science. Aside from those hands he more  resembled a pugilist than a scientist. A heavy shock of unruly black  hair surmounted a face with beetling black brows and a prognathous jaw.  His enormous head, with a breadth and height of forehead which were  amazing, rose from a pillar-like neck which sprang from a pair of  massive shoulders and the arching chest of the trained athlete. Dr. Bird  stood six feet two inches in his socks, and weighed over two hundred  stripped. As he leaned back a curious glitter, which Carnes had learned  to associate with keen interest, showed for an instant in his eyes.    \"I will be glad to hear your story, Mr. Mitchell,\" he said softly. \"Tell  it in your own way and try not to omit any detail, no matter how trivial  it may be.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The seaman nodded and sat silent for a moment as though marshaling his  thoughts.    \"The story really starts the afternoon of May 12th,\" he said, \"although  I didn't realize the importance of the first incident at the time. We  were steaming along at good speed, hoping to make New York before too  late for quarantine, when a hail came from the forward lookout. I was on  watch and I went forward to see what was the matter. The lookout was  Louis Green, an able bodied seaman and a good one, but a confirmed  drunkard. I asked him what the trouble was and he turned toward me a  face that was haggard with terror.    \"'I've seen a sea serpent, Mr. Mitchell,' he said.    \"'Nonsense!' I replied sharply. 'You've been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/307"],[0,"Three Elephant Power, and Other Stories (#15)"],[1," that is the case with the dog--Art before  everything.    It is a grand sight to see a really good setter or pointer working up to  a bird, occasionally glancing over his shoulder to see if the man with  the gun has not lost himself. He throws his whole soul into his work,  questing carefully over the cold scent, feathering eagerly when the bird  is close, and at last drawing up like a statue. Not Paganini himself  ever lost himself in his art more thoroughly than does humble Spot or  Ponto. It is not amusement and not a mere duty to him; it is a sacred  gift, which he is bound to exercise.    A pointer in need of amusement will play with another dog--the pair  pretending to fight, and so on, but when there is work to be done, the  dog is lost in the artist. How crestfallen he looks if by any chance he  blunders on to a bird without pointing it! A fiddler who has played  a wrong note in a solo is the only creature who can look quite so  discomfited. Humanity, instead of going to the ant for wisdom, should  certainly go to the dog.    Sporting dogs are like other artists, in that they are apt to get  careless of everything except their vocation. They are similarly quite  unreliable in their affections. They are not good watch dogs, and take  little interest in chasing cats. They look on a little dog that catches  rats much as a great musician looks on a cricketer--it's clever, but it  isn't Art.    Hunting and fighting dogs are the gladiators of the animal world.  A fox-hound or a kangaroo-dog is always of the same opinion as Mr.  Jorrocks:--\"All time is wasted what isn't spent in 'untin'.\"    A greyhound will start out in the morning with three lame legs, but as  soon as he sees a hare start he _must_ go. He utterly forgets his sorrows  in the excitement, just as a rowing-man, all over boils and blisters,  will pull a desperate race without feeling any pain. Such dogs are not  easily excited by anything but a chase, and a burglar might come and rob  the house and murder the inmates without arousing any excitement among  them. Guarding a house is \"not their pidgin\" as the Chinese say. That  is one great reason for the success of the dog at whatever branch of his  tribe's work he goes in for--he is so thorough. Dogs who are forced to  combine half-a-dozen professions never make a success at anything. One  dog one billet is their motto.    The most earnest and thorough of all the dog tribe is the fighting  dog. His intense self-respect, his horror of brawling, his cool  determination, make him a pattern to humanity. The bull-dog or  bull-terrier is generally the most friendly and best-tempered dog in the  world; but when he is put down in the ring he fights till he drops, in  grim silence, though his feet are bitten through and through, his ears  are in rags, and his neck a hideous mass of wounds.    In a well-conducted dog-fight each dog in turn has to attack the other  dog, and one can see fierce earnestness blazing in the eye of the  attacker as he hurls himself on the foe. What makes him fight like  that? It is not bloodthirstiness, because they are neither savage nor  quarrelsome dogs: a bulldog will go all his life without a fight, unless  put into a ring. It is simply their strong self-respect and stubborn  pride which will not let them give in. The greyhound snaps at his  opponent and then runs for his life, but the fighting dog stands to it  till death.    Just occasionally one sees the same type of human being--some  quiet-spoken, good-tempered man who has taken up glove-fighting for a  living, and who, perhaps, gets pitted against a man a shade better than  himself. After a few rounds he knows he is overmatched, but there is  something at the back of his brain that will not let him cave in. Round  after round he stands punishment, and round after round he grimly comes  up, till, possibly, his opponent loses heart, or a fluky hit turns the  scale in his favour. These men are to be found in every class of life.  Many of the gamest of the game are mere gutter-bred boys who will  continue to fight long after they have endured enough punishment to  entitle them to quit.    You can see in their eyes the same hard glitter that shows in the  bulldog's eyes as he limps across the ring, or in the eye of the  racehorse as he lies down to it when his opponent is outpacing him. It  is grit, pluck, vim, nerve force; call it what you like, and there is no  created thing that has more of it than the dog.    The blood-lust is a dog-phase that has never been quite understood.  Every station-owner knows that sometimes the house-dogs are liable to  take a sudden fit of sheep-killing. Any kind of dog will do it, from the  collie downward. Sometimes dogs from different homesteads meet in the  paddocks, having apparently arranged the whole affair beforehand. They  are very artful about it, too. They lie round the house till dark, and  then slink off and have a wild night's blood-spree, running down the  wretched sheep and tearing their throats open; before dawn they  slink back again and lie around the house as before. Many and many a  sheep-owner has gone out with a gun and shot his neighbour's dogs for  killing sheep which his own wicked, innocent-looking dogs had slain.          CONCERNING A STEEPLECHASE RIDER      Of all the ways in which men get a living there is none so hard and so  precarious as that of steeplechase-riding in Australia. It is bad enough  in England, where steeplechases only take place in winter, when the  ground is soft, where the horses are properly schooled before being  raced, and where most of the obstacles will yield a little if struck and  give the horse a chance to blunder over safely.    In Australia the men have to go at racing-speed, on very hard ground,  over the most rigid and uncompromising obstacles--ironbark rails clamped  into solid posts with bands of iron. No wonder they are always coming  to grief, and are always in and out of hospital in splints and bandages.  Sometimes one reads that a horse has fallen and the rider has \"escaped  with a severe shaking.\"    That \"shaking\", gentle reader, would lay you or me up for weeks, with  a doctor to look after us and a crowd of sympathetic friends calling to  know how our poor back was. But the steeplechase-rider has to be out and  about again, \"riding exercise\" every morning, and \"schooling\" all sorts  of cantankerous brutes over the fences. These men take their lives in  their hands and look at grim death between their horses' ears every time  they race or \"school\".    The death-record among Australian cross-country jockeys and horses is  very great; it is a curious instance of how custom sanctifies all things  that such horse-and-man slaughter is accepted in such a callous way. If  any theatre gave a show at which men and horses were habitually crippled  or killed in full sight of the audience, the manager would be put on his  trial for manslaughter.    Our race-tracks use up their yearly average of horses and men without  attracting remark. One would suppose that the risk being so great the  profits were enormous; but they are not. In \"the game\" as played on  our racecourses there is just a bare living for a good capable horseman  while he lasts, with the certainty of an ugly smash if he keeps at it  long enough.    And they don't need to keep at it very long. After a few good \"shakings\"  they begin to take a nip or two to put heart into them before they go  out, and after a while they have to increase the dose. At last they  cannot ride at all without a regular cargo of alcohol on board, and are  either \"half-muzzy\" or shaky according as they have taken too much or  too little.    Then the game becomes suicidal; it is an axiom that as soon as a man  begins to funk he begins to fall. The reason is that a rider who has  lost his nerve is afraid of his horse making a mistake, and takes a  pull, or urges him onward, just at the crucial moment when the horse is  rattling up to his fence and judging his distance. That little, nervous  pull at his head or that little touch of the spur, takes his attention  from the fence, with the result that he makes his spring a foot too far  off or a foot too close in, and--smash!    The loafers who hang about the big fences rush up to see if the jockey  is killed or stunned; if he is, they dispose of any jewellery he may  have about him; they have been known almost to tear a finger off in  their endeavours to secure a ring. The ambulance clatters up at a  canter, the poor rider is pushed in out of sight, and the ladies in the  stand say how unlucky they are--that brute of a horse falling after  they backed him. A wolfish-eyed man in the Leger-stand shouts to  a wolfish-eyed pal, \"Bill, I believe that jock was killed when the  chestnut fell,\" and Bill replies, \"Yes, damn him, I had five bob on  him.\" And the rider, gasping like a crushed chicken, is carried into the  casualty-room and laid on a little stretcher, while outside the window  the bookmakers are roaring \"Four to one bar one,\" and the racing is  going on merrily as ever.    These remarks serve to introduce one of the fraternity who may be  considered as typical of all. He was a small, wiry, hard-featured  fellow, the son of a stockman on a big cattle-station, and began life as  a horse-breaker; he was naturally a horseman, able and willing to ride  anything that could carry him. He left the station to go with cattle on  the road, and having picked up a horse that showed pace, amused himself  by jumping over fences. Then he went to Wagga, entered the horse in a  steeplechase, rode him himself, won handsomely, sold the horse at a good  price to a Sydney buyer, and went down to ride it in his Sydney races.    In Sydney he did very well; he got a name as a fearless and clever  rider, and was offered several mounts on fine animals. So he pitched  his camp in Sydney, and became a fully-enrolled member of the worst  profession in the world. I had known "]]]
