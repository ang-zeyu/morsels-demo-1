A good cuff or two when he saw me pinning an insect to a  cork was all the encouragement that I received from him. Perhaps he was  right.    The conclusion is positive: there is nothing in heredity to explain my  taste for observation. You may say that I do not go far enough back.  Well, what should I find beyond the grandparents where my facts come to  a stop? I know, partly. I should find even more uncultured ancestors:  sons of the soil, plowmen, sowers of rye, neat herds; one and all, by  the very force of things, of not the least account in the nice matters  of observation.    And yet, in me, the observer, the inquirer into things began to take  shape almost in infancy. Why should I not describe my first discoveries?  They are ingenuous in the extreme, but will serve notwithstanding to  tell us something of the way in which tendencies first show themselves.  I was five or six years old. That the poor household might have one  mouth less to feed, I had been placed in grandmother's care, as I have  just been saying. Here, in solitude, my first gleams of intelligence  were awakened amidst the geese, the calves and the sheep. Everything  before that is impenetrable darkness. My real birth is at that  moment when the dawn of personality rises, dispersing the mists of  unconsciousness and leaving a lasting memory. I can see myself plainly,  clad in a soiled frieze frock flapping against my bare heels; I  remember the handkerchief hanging from my waist by a bit of string, a  handkerchief often lost and replaced by the back of my sleeve.    There I stand one day, a pensive urchin, with my hands behind my back  and my face turned to the sun. The dazzling splendor fascinates me. I am  the Moth attracted by the light of the lamp. With what am I enjoying the  glorious radiance: with my mouth or my eyes? That is the question put  by my budding scientific curiosity. Reader, do not smile: the future  observer is already practicing and experimenting. I open my mouth wide  and close my eyes: the glory disappears. I open my eyes and shut my  mouth: the glory reappears. I repeat the performance, with the same  result. The question's solved: I have learnt by deduction that I see the  sun with my eyes. Oh, what a discovery! That evening, I told the whole  house all about it. Grandmother smiled fondly at my simplicity: the  others laughed at it. 'Tis the way of the world.    Another find. At nightfall, amidst the neighboring bushes, a sort of  jingle attracted my attention, sounding very faintly and softly through  the evening silence. Who is making that noise? Is it a little bird  chirping in his nest? We must look into the matter and that quickly.  True, there is the wolf, who comes out of the woods at this time, so  they tell me. Let's go all the same, but not too far: just there, behind  that clump of groom. I stand on the look out for long, but all in vain.  At the faintest sound of movement in the brushwood, the jingle ceases.  I try again next day and the day after. This time, my stubborn watch  succeeds. Whoosh! A grab of my hand and I hold the singer. It is not a  bird; it is a kind of Grasshopper whose hind legs my playfellows have  taught me to like: a poor recompense for my prolonged ambush. The best  part of the business is not the two haunches with the shrimpy flavor,  but what I have just learnt. I now know, from personal observation, that  the Grasshopper sings. I did not publish my discovery, for fear of the  same laughter that greeted my story about the sun.    Oh, what pretty flowers, in a field close to the house! They seem to  smile to me with their great violet eyes. Later on, I see, in their  place, bunches of big red cherries. I taste them. They are not nice  and they have no stones. What can those cherries be? At the end of the  summer, grandfather comes with a spade and turns my field of observation  topsy-turvy. From under ground there comes, by the basketful and  sackful, a sort of round root. I know that root; it abounds in the  house; time after time I have cooked it in the peat stove. It is the  potato. Its violet flower and its red fruit are pigeonholed for good and  all in my memory.    With an ever watchful eye for animals and plants, the future observer,  the little six-year-old monkey, practiced by himself, all unawares.  He went to the flower, he went to the insect, even as the large white  butterfly goes to the cabbage and the red admiral to the thistle. He  looked and inquired, drawn by a curiosity whereof heredity did not know  the secret. He bore within him the germ of a faculty unknown to his  family; he kept alive a glimmer that was foreign to the ancestral  hearth. What will become of that infinitesimal spark of childish fancy?  It will die out, beyond a doubt, unless education intervene, giving it  the fuel of example, fanning it with the breath of experience. In that  case, schooling will explain what heredity leaves unexplained. This is  what we will examine in the next chapter.          CHAPTER VI. MY SCHOOLING    I am back in the village, in my father's house. I am now seven years  old; and it is high time that I went to school. Nothing could have  turned out better: the master is my godfather. What shall I call the  room in which I was to become acquainted with the alphabet? It would  be difficult to find the exact word, because the room served for every  purpose. It was at once a school, a kitchen, a bedroom, a dining room  and, at times, a chicken house and a piggery. Palatial schools were not  dreamt of in those days; any wretched hovel was thought good enough.    A broad fixed ladder led to the floor above. Under the ladder stood  a big bed in a boarded recess. What was there upstairs? I never quite  knew. I would see the master sometimes bring down an armful of hay for  the ass, sometimes a basket of potatoes which the housewife emptied into  the pot in which the little porkers' food was cooked. It must have been  a loft of sorts, a storehouse of provisions for man and beast. Those two  apartments composed the whole building.    To return to the lower one, the schoolroom: a window faces south, the  only window in the house, a low, narrow window whose frame you can touch  at the same time with your head and both your shoulders. This sunny  aperture is the only lively spot in the dwelling, it overlooks the  greater part of the village, which straggles along the slopes of a  slanting valley. In the window recess is the master's little table.    The opposite wall contains a niche in which stands a gleaming copper  pail full of water. Here the parched children can relieve their thirst  when they please, with a cup left within their reach. At the top of the  niche are a few shelves bright with pewter plates, dishes and drinking  vessels, which are taken down from their sanctuary on great occasions  only.    More or less everywhere, at any spot which the light touches, are  crudely colored pictures, pasted on the walls. Here is Our Lady of the  Seven Dolours, the disconsolate Mother of God opening her blue cloak  to show her heart pierced with seven daggers. Between the sun and moon,  which stare at you with their great, round eyes, is the Eternal Father,  whose robe swells as though puffed out with the storm. To the right  of the window, in the embrasure, is the Wandering Jew. He wears a  three-cornered hat, a large, white leather apron, hobnailed shoes and a  stout stick. 'Never was such a bearded man seen before or after,' says  the legend that surrounds the picture. The draftsman has not forgotten  this detail: the old man's beard spreads in a snowy avalanche over the  apron and comes down to his knees. On the left is Genevieve of Brabant,  accompanied by the roe, with fierce Golo hiding in the bushes, sword in  hand. Above hangs The Death of Mr. Credit, slain by defaulters at the  door of his inn; and so on and so on, in every variety of subject, at  all the unoccupied spots of the four walls.    I was filled with admiration of this picture gallery, which held one's  eyes with its great patches of red, blue, green and yellow. The master,  however, had not set up his collection with a view to training our minds  and hearts. That was the last and least of the worthy man's ambitions.  An artist in his fashion, he had adorned his house according to his  taste; and we benefited by the scheme of decoration.    While the gallery of halfpenny pictures made me happy all the year  round, there was another entertainment which I found particularly  attractive in winter, in frosty weather, when the snow lay long on the  ground. Against the far wall stands the fireplace, as monumental in size  as at my grandmother's. Its arched cornice occupies the whole width of  the room, for the enormous redoubt fulfils more than one purpose. In the  middle is the hearth, but, on the right and left, are two breast-high  recesses, half wood and half stone. Each of them is a bed, with a  mattress stuffed with chaff of winnowed corn. Two sliding planks serve  as shutters and close the chest if the sleeper would be alone. This  dormitory, sheltered under the chimney mantel, supplies couches for the  favored ones of the house, the two boarders. They must lie snug in there  at night, with their shutters closed, when the north wind howls at the  mouth of the dark valley and sends the snow awhirl. The rest is occupied  by the hearth and its accessories: the three-legged stools; the salt  box, hanging against the wall to keep its contents dry; the heavy shovel  which it takes two hands to wield; lastly, the bellows similar to those  with which I used to blow out my cheeks in grandfather's house. They  consist of a mighty branch of pine, hollowed throughout its length with  a red-hot iron. By means of this channel, one's breath is applied, from  a convenient distance, to the spot which is to be revived. With a couple  of stones for supports, the master's bundle of sticks and our own logs  blaze and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3424"],[0,"For the Term of His Natural Life (#15)"],[1,"it might be--had been discovered; but  Pine, accustomed to convict ships, overruled this decision.    \"You don't know these fellows as well as I do,\" said he. \"In the first  place there may be no mutiny at all. The whole thing is, perhaps, some  absurdity of that fellow Dawes--and should we once put the notion of  attacking us into the prisoners' heads, there is no telling what they  might do.\"    \"But the man seemed certain,\" said the other. \"He mentioned my wife's  maid, too!\"    \"Suppose he did?--and, begad, I dare say he's right--I never liked the  look of the girl. To tell them that we have found them out this time  won't prevent 'em trying it again. We don't know what their scheme is  either. If it is a mutiny, half the ship's company may be in it. No,  Captain Vickers, allow me, as surgeon-superintendent, to settle our  course of action. You are aware that--\"    \"--That, by the King's Regulations, you are invested with full powers,\"  interrupted Vickers, mindful of discipline in any extremity. \"Of course,  I merely suggested--and I know nothing about the girl, except that she  brought a good character from her last mistress--a Mrs. Crofton I think  the name was. We were glad to get anybody to make a voyage like this.\"    \"Well,\" says Pine, \"look here. Suppose we tell these scoundrels that  their design, whatever it may be, is known. Very good. They will  profess absolute ignorance, and try again on the next opportunity,  when, perhaps, we may not know anything about it. At all events, we  are completely ignorant of the nature of the plot and the names of the  ringleaders. Let us double the sentries, and quietly get the men under  arms. Let Miss Sarah do what she pleases, and when the mutiny breaks  out, we will nip it in the bud; clap all the villains we get in irons,  and hand them over to the authorities in Hobart Town. I am not a cruel  man, sir, but we have got a cargo of wild beasts aboard, and we must be  careful.\"    \"But surely, Mr. Pine, have you considered the probable loss of life?  I--really--some more humane course perhaps? Prevention, you know--\"    Pine turned round upon him with that grim practicality which was a part  of his nature. \"Have you considered the safety of the ship, Captain  Vickers? You know, or have heard of, the sort of things that take place  in these mutinies. Have you considered what will befall those half-dozen  women in the soldiers' berths? Have you thought of the fate of your own  wife and child?\"    Vickers shuddered.    \"Have it your way, Mr. Pine; you know best perhaps. But don't risk more  lives than you can help.\"    \"Be easy, sir,\" says old Pine; \"I am acting for the best; upon my soul  I am. You don't know what convicts are, or rather what the law has made  'em--yet--\"    \"Poor wretches!\" says Vickers, who, like many martinets, was in reality  tender-hearted. \"Kindness might do much for them. After all, they are  our fellow-creatures.\"    \"Yes,\" returned the other, \"they are. But if you use that argument to  them when they have taken the vessel, it won't avail you much. Let me  manage, sir; and for God's sake, say nothing to anybody. Our lives may  hang upon a word.\"    Vickers promised, and kept his promise so far as to chat cheerily with  Blunt and Frere at dinner, only writing a brief note to his wife to tell  her that, whatever she heard, she was not to stir from her cabin until  he came to her; he knew that, with all his wife's folly, she would obey  unhesitatingly, when he couched an order in such terms.    According to the usual custom on board convict ships, the guards  relieved each other every two hours, and at six p.m. the poop guard was  removed to the quarter-deck, and the arms which, in the daytime,  were disposed on the top of the arm-chest, were placed in an arm-rack  constructed on the quarter-deck for that purpose. Trusting nothing to  Frere--who, indeed, by Pine's advice, was, as we have seen, kept in  ignorance of the whole matter--Vickers ordered all the men, save those  who had been on guard during the day, to be under arms in the barrack,  forbade communication with the upper deck, and placed as sentry at the  barrack door his own servant, an old soldier, on whose fidelity he could  thoroughly rely. He then doubled the guards, took the keys of the prison  himself from the non-commissioned officer whose duty it was to keep  them, and saw that the howitzer on the lower deck was loaded with grape.  It was a quarter to seven when Pine and he took their station at the  main hatchway, determined to watch until morning.    At a quarter past seven, any curious person looking through the window  of Captain Blunt's cabin would have seen an unusual sight. That gallant  commander was sitting on the bed-place, with a glass of rum and water in  his hand, and the handsome waiting-maid of Mrs. Vickers was seated on a  stool by his side. At a first glance it was perceptible that the captain  was very drunk. His grey hair was matted all ways about his reddened  face, and he was winking and blinking like an owl in the sunshine.  He had drunk a larger quantity of wine than usual at dinner, in sheer  delight at the approaching assignation, and having got out the rum  bottle for a quiet \"settler\" just as the victim of his fascinations  glided through the carefully-adjusted door, he had been persuaded to go  on drinking.    \"Cuc-come, Sarah,\" he hiccuped. \"It's all very fine, my lass, but you  needn't be so--hic--proud, you know. I'm a plain sailor--plain s'lor,  Srr'h. Ph'n'as Bub--blunt, commander of the Mal-Mal- Malabar. Wors' 'sh  good talkin'?\"    Sarah allowed a laugh to escape her, and artfully protruded an ankle at  the same time. The amorous Phineas lurched over, and made shift to take  her hand.    \"You lovsh me, and I--hic--lovsh you, Sarah. And a preshus tight little  craft you--hic--are. Giv'sh--kiss, Sarah.\"    Sarah got up and went to the door.    \"Wotsh this? Goin'! Sarah, don't go,\" and he staggered up; and with the  grog swaying fearfully in one hand, made at her.    The ship's bell struck the half-hour. Now or never was the time. Blunt  caught her round the waist with one arm, and hiccuping with love and  rum, approached to take the kiss he coveted. She seized the moment,  surrendered herself to his embrace, drew from her pocket the laudanum  bottle, and passing her hand over his shoulder, poured half its contents  into the glass.    \"Think I'm--hic--drunk, do yer? Nun--not I, my wench.\"    \"You will be if you drink much more. Come, finish that and be quiet, or  I'll go away.\"    But she threw a provocation into her glance as she spoke, which belied  her words, and which penetrated even the sodden intellect of poor  Blunt. He balanced himself on his heels for a moment, and holding by  the moulding of the cabin, stared at her with a fatuous smile of drunken  admiration, then looked at the glass in his hand, hiccuped with much  solemnity thrice, and, as though struck with a sudden sense of duty  unfulfilled, swallowed the contents at a gulp. The effect was almost  instantaneous. He dropped the tumbler, lurched towards the woman at the  door, and then making a half-turn in accordance with the motion of the  vessel, fell into his bunk, and snored like a grampus.    Sarah Purfoy watched him for a few minutes, and then having blown out  the light, stepped out of the cabin, and closed the door behind her. The  dusky gloom which had held the deck on the previous night enveloped all  forward of the main-mast. A lantern swung in the forecastle, and swayed  with the motion of the ship. The light at the prison door threw a glow  through the open hatch, and in the cuddy, at her right hand, the usual  row of oil-lamps burned. She looked mechanically for Vickers, who was  ordinarily there at that hour, but the cuddy was empty. So much the  better, she thought, as she drew her dark cloak around her, and tapped  at Frere's door. As she did so, a strange pain shot through her temples,  and her knees trembled. With a strong effort she dispelled the dizziness  that had almost overpowered her, and held herself erect. It would never  do to break down now.    The door opened, and Maurice Frere drew her into the cabin. \"So you have  come?\" said he.    \"You see I have. But, oh! if I should be seen!\"    \"Seen? Nonsense! Who is to see you?\"    \"Captain Vickers, Doctor Pine, anybody.\"    \"Not they. Besides, they've gone off down to Pine's cabin since dinner.  They're all right.\"    Gone off to Pine's cabin! The intelligence struck her with dismay.  What was the cause of such an unusual proceeding? Surely they did not  suspect! \"What do they want there?\" she asked.    Maurice Frere was not in the humour to argue questions of probability.  \"Who knows? I don't. Confound 'em,\" he added, \"what does it matter to  us? We don't want them, do we, Sarah?\"    She seemed to be listening for something, and did not reply. Her nervous  system was wound up to the highest pitch of excitement. The success of  the plot depended on the next five minutes.    \"What are you staring at? Look at me, can't you? What eyes you have! And  what hair!\"    At that instant the report of a musket-shot broke the silence. The  mutiny had begun!    The sound awoke the soldier to a sense of his duty. He sprang to his  feet, and disengaging the arms that clung about his neck, made for  the door. The moment for which the convict's accomplice had waited  approached. She hung upon him with all her weight. Her long hair swept  across his face, her warm breath was on his cheek, her dress exposed  her round, smooth shoulder. He, intoxicated, conquered, had half-turned  back, when suddenly the rich crimson died away from her lips, leaving  them an ashen grey colour. Her eyes closed in agony; loosing her hold  of him, she staggered to her feet, pressed her hands upon her bosom, and  uttered a sharp cry of pain.    The fever which had been on her two days, and which, by a strong  exercise of will, she had"]]]
