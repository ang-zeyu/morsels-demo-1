He was eager to be the guide, the mentor, the  manager of a bull-fighter, but all the _maestros_ had their own and so  the advent of Gallardo was a stroke of fortune for him. The slightest  aspersion cast upon the merits of his favorite turned him red with fury  and converted the tauromachic dispute into a personal question. He  counted it as a glorious act of war to have come to blows in a _cafe_  with a couple of contemptuous amateurs who criticised _his matador_ as  being too boastful.    He felt as though there were not enough papers printed to publish  Gallardo's glory, and on winter mornings he would go and place himself  on a corner touched by a ray of sunlight at the entrance of Sierpes  Street, and as his friends passed, he would say in a loud voice, \"No!  there is only one man!\" as if he were talking to himself, affecting to  not see those who were drawing near. \"The greatest man in the world! And  let him that thinks to the contrary speak out. The only one!\"    \"Who?\" asked his friends, jestingly, pretending not to understand him.    \"Who can it be? Juan!\"    \"What Juan?\"    With a gesture of indignation and surprise he would answer, \"What Juan  could it be? As if there were many Juans! Juan Gallardo.\"    \"But, man alive,\" some of them would say to him, \"one might think you  two lie down together! It is thou, may be, that is going to get married  to him?\"    \"Only because he don't want it so,\" Don Jose would stoutly answer, with  the fervor of idolatry.    And on seeing other friends approach, he forgot their jibes and  continued repeating:    \"No! there is only one man. The greatest in the world. And he that  doesn't believe it let him open his beak, for here am I!\"    Gallardo's wedding was a great event. The new house was opened with  it--the house of which the leather-worker was so proud, where he showed  the courtyard, the columns, the tiles, as if all were the work of his  hands.    They were married in San Gil, before the Virgin of Hope, called the  Virgin of Macarena. At the church door the hundreds of Chinese shawls  embroidered with exotic flowers and birds, in which the bride's friends  were draped, glistened in the sunshine.    A deputy to the Cortes stood as best man.    Above the black and white felts of the majority of the guests rose the  shining tall hats of the manager and other gentlemen, Gallardo's  devotees. All of them smiled with satisfaction at the deference of  popularity that was shown them on going about with the bull-fighter.    Alms were given at the door of the house during the day. The poor came  even from the distant towns, attracted by the fame of this gorgeous  wedding.    There was a great feast in the courtyard. Photographers took  instantaneous views for the Madrid newspapers. Gallardo's wedding was a  national event. Far into the night guitars strummed with melancholy  plaint, accompanied by hand-clapping and the click of castanets. The  girls, their arms held high, beat the marble floor with their little  feet, whirling their skirts and _mantillas_ around their slender bodies,  moving with the rhythm characteristic of the _Sevillanas_. Bottles of  rich Andalusian wines were uncorked by the dozen; from hand to hand  passed cups of ardent sherry, of strong _montilla_, and of the wine of  San Lucar, pale and perfumed. Every one was drunk but their intoxication  left them sweet, subdued, and sad, with no other manifestation than  sighs and songs, many starting at once to intone melancholy chants that  told of prisons, of deaths, and of the poor mother, the eternal theme of  the popular songs of Andalusia.    The last guests took their leave at midnight and the bride and groom  were left in the house with Senora Angustias. The leather-worker, going  out with his wife, made a gesture of desperation. He was drunk and  furious because no one had paid him any attention during the entire  day. As if he were nobody! As if the family did not exist!    [Illustration: Gallardo's wedding was a national event. Far into the  night guitars strummed with melancholy plaint.... Girls, their arms held  high, beat the marble floor with their little feet]    \"They cast us out, Encarnacion. That girl, with her little face like the  Virgin of Hope, is going to be mistress of everything and there won't be  even a crumb left for us. Thou shalt see how they will fill the place  with children.\"    And the prolific man grew indignant thinking of Gallardo's future  offspring being brought into the world with no other purpose than to  harm his own.    Time went on. A year passed without Senor Antonio's prediction being  fulfilled. Gallardo and his wife appeared at all the functions with the  pomp and show of a rich and popular bridal pair; she with _mantillas_  that drew forth screams of admiration from the poor women; he, wearing  his brilliants and ever ready to draw out his pocket-book to treat the  people and to succor the beggars that came in bands. The gypsies,  coppery of skin and chattering like witches, besieged Carmen with happy  prophesies. Might God bless her! She was going to have a boy, a little  prattling babe, more beautiful than the sun itself. They read it in the  white of her eyes.    But in vain Carmen flushed with joy and modesty, lowering her eyes; in  vain the _espada_ walked erect, proud of his achievements, believing  that the coveted fruit would soon appear.    And then another year passed without the realization of their hopes.  Senora Angustias was sad when they spoke to her about it. She had other  grandchildren, Encarnacion's little ones, who by order of the  leather-worker spent the day in their grandmother's house trying in  every way to please their uncle. But she, wishing to compensate  Gallardo for the hardships of the past, prayed with fervent affection  for a child of his to care for, yearning to shower upon him all the love  she could not give the father in his infancy because of her poverty.    \"I know what is the matter,\" said the old woman sadly, \"poor Carmen has  no peace of mind. Thou shouldst see that unhappy creature when Juan is  travelling about the world.\"    During the winter, in the season of rest when the bull-fighter was at  home or went to the country testing bullocks and joining in the hunt,  all was well. Carmen was then content knowing that her husband was in no  danger. She laughed on the slightest pretext; she ate heartily; her face  was animated by the color of health; but as soon as the spring came and  Juan left home to fight bulls in the rings of Spain the poor girl, pale  and weak, would fall into a painful stupefaction, her eyes enlarged by  fear and ready to shed tears.    \"Seventy-two bull-fights this year,\" said the friends of the house,  commenting on the swordsman's contracts. \"No one is so sought after as  he.\"    And Carmen smiled with a grimace of pain. Seventy-two afternoons of  agony like a criminal doomed to death, awaiting the arrival of the  telegram at nightfall and at the same time dreading it! Seventy-two days  of terror, of vague superstitions, thinking that a word forgotten in a  prayer might influence the luck of the absent one! Seventy-two days of  painful paradox, living in a tranquil house, seeing the same people, her  accustomed existence running on, calm and peaceful as though nothing  extraordinary were happening in the world, hearing the play of her  husband's nephews in the courtyard and the flower-seller's song on the  street, while far, very far away, in unknown cities, her Juan, in the  presence of thousands of eyes, fought with wild beasts, seeing death  pass close to his breast at each movement of the red rag he held in his  hands!    Ah! those days of bull-fights, feast-days, on which the sky seemed more  beautiful and the once solitary street resounded beneath the feet of the  holiday crowd, when guitars strummed with accompaniment of hand-clapping  and song in the tavern at the corner. Carmen, plainly dressed, with her  _mantilla_ over her eyes, left the house as if fleeing from evil dreams,  going to take refuge in the churches. Her simple faith, which  uncertainty burdened with superstitions, made her go from altar to altar  as she recalled to mind the merits and miracles of each image. She went  to San Gil, the church that had seen the happiest day of her existence,  she knelt before the Virgin of Macarena, provided candles, many candles,  and by their ruddy glow contemplated the brown face of the image with  its black eyes and long lashes, which, it was said, resembled her own.  In her she trusted. For a good reason was she Our Lady of Hope. Surely  at this very hour she was protecting Juan by her divine power.    But suddenly indecision and fear rudely burst through her beliefs,  tearing them asunder. The Virgin was a woman and women are so weak! Her  destiny was to suffer and weep, as she wept for her husband, as the  other had wept for her Son. She must confide in stronger powers; she  must implore the aid of a more vigorous protection. And, in the stress  of her agony, abandoning the Macarena without scruple as a useless  friendship is forgotten, she went at other times to the church of San  Lorenzo in search of Jesus, He of the Great Power, the Man-God crowned  with thorns with the cross on his back, sweaty and tearful, the work of  the sculptor Montanes, an awe-inspiring image.    The dramatic sadness of the Nazarene stumbling against the stones and  bent beneath the weight of the cross seemed to console the poor wife.  Lord of the Great Power! This vague and grandiose title tranquillized  her. If the god dressed in brown velvet and gold would but deign to  listen to her sighs, to her prayers repeated in eager haste, with dizzy  rapidity, she was sure that Juan would walk unscathed out of the ring  where he was at that moment. Again she would give money to a sacristan  to light candles, and she passed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33830"],[0,"Fur Farming (#15)"],[1,"to the house and they are always located deep under water.    The food of the beaver consists principally of bark of poplar, birch,  willow, cottonwood, alder and wild cherry. They are also fond of the  roots of the water lily. In the South it is said that they quite often  feed on corn, when located near the farms. They would doubtless eat many  kinds of roots and vegetables if same could be procured. In some few  sections, where the nature of the stream is such that houses and dams  are not a success, the beavers live in holes in the bank of the stream  and are called \"bank beavers\"; however, they are the same variety as the  house building kind.    In the Northern districts, where the ponds are covered with ice six  months of the year, the beavers spend the entire winter under the ice.  For this long period of imprisonment they must lay up a large store of  food. This food consists of small, green saplings and brush, cut into  suitable lengths and stored under water, in front of the house. They eat  only the bark and the peeled sticks are used to repair the house and  dam. The young beavers are born in April and May and there are usually  only two at a birth, but sometimes there will be three. These young  animals remain two years with the parents, so that a full family will  consist of the two old ones, two or three medium size and two or three  small beavers. However, there are \"bachelor beavers\", old males who  always live alone, and have a small house somewhere along the shore of a  stream or pond.    It was the beaver that was most sought by the early trappers, for the  fur was more in demand than the fur of any other animal. At present it  is not as popular as in days of old, but we do not believe that its  value will decrease, as the catch becomes lighter each succeeding year.  The skins do not become prime as early as those of some other animals,  but are in good condition in advance of the muskrat. The fur of the  beaver, otter, muskrat and bear remains in good condition until late in  the spring.    During the summer months many of the beavers travel about on the streams  and if a house is found at this time it may be deserted, or at the best,  only one or two animals will be found there. As fall approaches, they  all return to the lodge and from that time until the water is frozen  they will be hard at work laying up the winter's store of food.    THE OTTER.--The otter is occasionally met with in almost all parts of  North America, in some places fairly plentiful, in others very rare, but  they are found in greatest numbers in the swamps of some of the Southern  States, and in the wilder portions of Canada, Alaska and Newfoundland.  There are two species, the common otter and the sea otter, which latter  is only found in the North Pacific and is now quite rare. Of the common  otter there are some three or four varieties, differing only in size and  color. The habits of the otter are very little known by the average man,  and many of the trappers know little about this animal. They are  rambling animals, traveling the streams and lakes for great distances.  They will travel sometimes ten or fifteen miles to visit some certain  lake and perhaps will only stay there over night. Again, if undisturbed,  they may remain for a month or more on some small pond.    They are on very friendly terms with the beaver and will frequently  spend several weeks or months with a beaver family, apparently living in  the same house. If an otter knows the location of two or more families  of beavers, it will spend practically all of its time with one or other  of the beaver families, or may make frequent visits from one to the  other.    The otter is an exceedingly active animal and is so much at home in the  water that it is able to catch fish with ease, and they are its  principal food. Where fish are plentiful, they will kill them merely for  pleasure, and what they can not eat, they will store up in some little  bay or inlet along the shore. These, however, are not placed there for  future use, as the otter will only eat food that is strictly fresh.  Besides fish, they also eat large numbers of frogs, which are easily  secured. They also eat muskrats and sometimes surprise these animals by  coming up into the houses from below, thus preventing the inmates from  escaping.    The otter does not travel much on land, except when crossing country  from one lake or stream to another. Their bodies being long and their  legs short, walking is, for them, rather difficult and their mode of  locomotion is a series of plunging leaps. On the snow or ice they move  along rapidly by throwing themselves forward, sliding on their bellies.  They are very playful animals and sometimes amuse themselves by sliding  down a slippery bank. They also have landing places where they go to  roll in the leaves and grass. In the spring they often lay for hours on  some old log by the side of the stream, basking in the warm sun. They  can remain a long time under water, and in winter travel long distances  under the ice,--in fact, they prefer to travel this way whenever  possible.    The home of the otter is a burrow in the bank of a stream, the entrance  under water. At the end of the burrow is a nest lined with leaves and  grass. They also, sometimes, den in hollow logs and the trunks of hollow  trees. The dens are always located in the most secluded places, as far  as possible removed from danger of discovery. The young are born in  April or May and the number is from two to four.    With regard to raising the beaver and otter for profit, we will say that  there has been comparatively few attempts at the business and we are  unable to get any authentic data with regard to these experiments.  However, the animals do well in captivity, in zoos, and when kept by  private individuals, as pets, and it is our opinion that if one will but  go slowly and learn the habits and nature of the animals, a fair degree  of success may be attained. It should be understood that conditions must  be favorable and the animals should be given a range as nearly like  their natural home as possible. Of course, one could not make a success  of raising beavers in an open field. They must have wooded land where  their natural food, quaking aspen (sometimes poplar), birch, willow,  cottonwood, alder, is plentiful. A pool on some quiet little stream,  bordered by a large tract of forest, would be the proper place. Beavers  are not given to roaming, except during the summer months, and in such  cases they always return to their home before cold weather comes.    We believe that the animals could not be raised successfully by any of  the plans recommended for the rearing of other fur-bearing animals, but  should simply be placed in a large enclosure, in the proper location,  and allowed to take care of themselves. The animals will breed perfectly  without any attention and there will be no danger of them killing their  offspring, as is the case with other fur bearers. There is no doubt that  the beaver and the otter will do well in the same enclosure, for in the  wild state they are very sociable and are fond of one another's company.    If otters are kept in an enclosed pond, it will be necessary to keep  them supplied with food, and perhaps the best way would be to keep the  ponds stocked with live fish and frogs. With the beaver the matter of  providing food is more simple, as it will only be necessary to make the  enclosure where their natural food is found in abundance.          CHAPTER XII.    KILLING, SKINNING AND STRETCHING.      When \"killing time\" comes, care should be taken to not frighten the  animals left for breeding purposes more than is absolutely necessary.  All animals that are tame enough should be driven into a separate  enclosure and out of sight of the others before being killed. Perhaps as  good a method of killing as any is to use a good club, striking on the  head just over the eyes or ears.    The above method is not for skunk, as they should be killed without the  enclosure becoming so strongly scented. A pole several feet long with a  strong loop on the end can be slipped over their head and well back on  the neck. The animal can now be lifted clear off the ground and carried  wherever the killing is desired. If the killer does not mind a little  perfume he knocks them on the head, or if a barrel of water is handy  they can be drowned and few scent. The drowning, however, is not  recommended, as it takes the fur hours to dry and is therefore extra  work. Some even claim that the water spoils the luster of the fur to a  certain extent.    Some animals, such as coon and skunk, do not leave their dens during  severe weather, so that it is advisable to begin selecting those that  are to be killed days and even weeks in advance of the time decided  upon. These should be placed in an enclosure or pen by themselves so  that the remaining ones will not be disturbed.    Even those animals that come out to their feed regularly during the cold  days should be handled in a similar manner so as not to disturb those to  be kept.    The animals that are to be kept for breeding purposes need not be fed so  heavily during the winter months or after those that were intended for  market have been killed. Of course in the spring after the females have  young, they must be fed heavily.    Some raisers, as soon as the young are weaned, select those that are to  be killed the coming winter, keeping them separate from the breeding  stock so that they can be fed properly. That is a great saving of food,  as those for market should be fed much more than the breeders at this  season--say during the months of September, October and November.    Much importance should be attached to the skinning and stretching of all  kinds of skins so as to command the highest commercial value. The otter,  foxes, marten, mink, opossum, civet and skunk should be cased, that is,  "]]]
