Now Messer Cane, being  minded to hold high festival at Verona, whereof fame should speak marvellous  things, and many folk from divers parts, of whom the greater number were  jesters of every order, being already arrived, Messer Cane did suddenly (for  some cause or another) abandon his design, and dismissed them with a partial  recompense. One only, Bergamino by name, a speaker ready and polished in a  degree credible only to such as heard him, remained, having received no  recompense or conge, still cherishing the hope that this omission might yet  turn out to his advantage. But Messer Cane was possessed with the idea that  whatever he might give Bergamino would be far more completely thrown away  than if he had tossed it into the fire; so never a word of the sort said he  or sent he to him. A few days thus passed, and then Bergamino, seeing that  he was in no demand or request for aught that belonged to his office, and  being also at heavy charges at his inn for the keep of his horses and  servants, fell into a sort of melancholy; but still he waited a while, not  deeming it expedient to leave. He had brought with him three rich and goodly  robes, given him by other lords, that he might make a brave show at the  festival, and when his host began to press for payment he gave him one of  the robes; afterwards, there being still much outstanding against him, he  must needs, if he would tarry longer at the inn, give the host the second  robe; after which he began to live on the third, being minded remain there,  as long as it would hold out, in expectation of better luck, and then to  take his departure. Now, while he was thus living on the third robe, it  chanced that Messer Cane encountered him one day as he sate at breakfast  with a very melancholy visage. Which Messer Cane observing, said, rather to  tease him than expecting to elicit from him any pleasant retort:--\"What ails  thee, Bergamino, that thou art still so melancholy? Let me know the reason  why.\" Whereupon Bergamino, without a moment's reflection, told the following  story, which could not have fitted his own case more exactly if it had been  long premeditated.    My lord, you must know that Primasso was a grammarian of great eminence, and  excellent and quick beyond all others in versifying; whereby he waxed so  notable and famous that, albeit he was not everywhere known by sight, yet  there were scarce any that did not at least by name and report know who  Primasso was. Now it so happened that, being once at Paris in straitened  circumstances, as it was his lot to be most of his time by reason that  virtue is little appreciated by the powerful, he heard speak of the Abbot of  Cluny, who, except the Pope, is supposed to be the richest prelate, in  regard of his vast revenues, that the Church of God can shew; and marvellous  and magnificent things were told him of the perpetual court which the abbot  kept, and how, wherever he was, he denied not to any that came there either  meat or drink, so only that he preferred his request while the abbot was at  table. Which when Primasso heard, he determined to go and see for himself  what magnificent state this abbot kept, for he was one that took great  delight in observing the ways of powerful and lordly men; wherefore he asked  how far from Paris was the abbot then sojourning. He was informed that the  abbot was then at one of his places distant perhaps six miles; which  Primasso concluded he could reach in time for breakfast, if he started early  in the morning. When he had learned the way, he found that no one else was  travelling by it, and fearing lest by mischance he should lose it, and so  find himself where it would not be easy for him to get food, he determined  to obviate so disagreeable a contingency by taking with him three loaves of  bread--as for drink, water, though not much to his taste, was, he supposed,  to be found everywhere. So, having disposed the loaves in the fold of his  tunic, he took the road and made such progress that he reached the abbot's  place of sojourn before the breakfast-hour. Having entered, he made the  circuit of the entire place, observing everything, the vast array of tables,  and the vast kitchen well-appointed with all things needful for the  preparation and service of the breakfast, and saying to himself:--\"In very  truth this man is even such a magnifico as he is reported to be.\" While his  attention was thus occupied, the abbot's seneschal, it being now  breakfast-time, gave order to serve water for the hands, which being washen,  they sat them all down to breakfast. Now it so happened that Primasso was  placed immediately in front of the door by which the abbot must pass from  his chamber, into the hall, in which, according to rule of his court,  neither wine, nor bread, nor aught else drinkable or eatable was ever set on  the tables before he made his appearance and was seated. The seneschal,  therefore, having set the tables, sent word to the abbot, that all was now  ready, and they waited only his pleasure. So the abbot gave the word, the  door of his chamber was thrown open, and he took a step or two forward  towards the hall, gazing straight in front of him as he went. Thus it fell  out that the first man on whom he set eyes was Primasso, who was in very  sorry trim. The abbot, who knew him not by sight, no sooner saw him, than,  surprised by a churlish mood to which he had hitherto been an entire  stranger, he said to himself:--\"So it is to such as this man that I give my  hospitality;\" and going back into the chamber he bade lock the door, and  asked of his attendants whether the vile fellow that sate at table directly  opposite the door was known to any of them, who, one and all, answered in  the negative. Primasso waited a little, but he was not used to fast, and his  journey had whetted his appetite. So, as the abbot did not return, he drew  out one of the loaves which he had brought with him, and began to eat. The  abbot, after a while, bade one of his servants go see whether Primasso were  gone. The servant returned with the answer:--\"No, sir, and (what is more) he  is eating a loaf of bread, which he seems to have brought with him.\" \"Be it  so then,\" said the abbot, who was vexed that he was not gone of his own  accord, but was not disposed to turn him out; \"let him eat his own bread, if  he have any, for he shall have none of ours today.\" By and by Primasso,  having finished his first loaf, began, as the abbot did not make his  appearance, to eat the second; which was likewise reported to the abbot, who  had again sent to see if he were gone. Finally, as the abbot still delayed  his coming, Primasso, having finished the second loaf, began upon the third;  whereof, once more, word was carried to the abbot, who now began to commune  with himself and say:--\"Alas! my soul, what unwonted mood harbourest thou  to-day? What avarice? what scorn? and of whom? I have given my hospitality,  now for many a year, to whoso craved it, without looking to see whether he  were gentle or churl, poor or rich, merchant or cheat, and mine eyes have  seen it squandered on vile fellows without number; and nought of that which  I feel towards this man ever entered my mind. Assuredly it cannot be that he  is a man of no consequence, who is the occasion of this access of avarice in  me. Though he seem to me a vile fellow, he must be some great man, that my  mind is thus obstinately averse to do him honour.\" Of which musings the  upshot was that he sent to inquire who the vile fellow was, and learning  that he was Primasso, come to see if what he had heard of his magnificent  state were true, he was stricken with shame, having heard of old Primasso's  fame, and knowing him to be a great man. Wherefore, being zealous to make  him the amend, he studied to do him honour in many ways; and after  breakfast, that his garb might accord with his native dignity, he caused him  to be nobly arrayed, and setting him upon a palfrey and filling his purse,  left it to his own choice, whether to go or to stay. So Primasso, with a  full heart, thanked him for his courtesy in terms the amplest that he could  command, and, having left Paris afoot, returned thither on horseback.\"    Messer Cane was shrewd enough to apprehend Bergamino's meaning perfectly  well without a gloss, and said with a smile:--\"Bergamino, thy parable is  apt, and declares to me very plainly thy losses, my avarice, and what thou  desirest of me. And in good sooth this access of avarice, of which thou art  the occasion, is the first that I have experienced. But I will expel the  intruder with the baton which thou thyself hast furnished.\" So he paid  Bergamino's reckoning, habited him nobly in one of his own robes, gave him  money and a palfrey, and left it for the time at his discretion, whether to  go or to stay.      NOVEL VIII.    --  Guglielmo Borsiere by a neat retort sharply censures avarice in Messer  Ermino de' Grimaldi.  --    Next Filostrato was seated Lauretta, who, when the praises bestowed on  Bergamino's address had ceased, knowing that it was now her turn to speak,  waited not for the word of command, but with a charming graciousness thus  began:--    The last novel, dear gossips, prompts me to relate how a worthy man,  likewise a jester, reprehended not without success the greed of a very  wealthy merchant; and, though the burden of my story is not unlike the last,  yet, perchance, it may not on that account be the less appreciated by you,  because it has a happy termination.    Know then that in Genoa there dwelt long ago a gentleman, who was known as  Messer Ermino de' Grimaldi, and whose wealth, both in lands and money, was  generally supposed to be far in excess of that of any other burgher then in  Italy, and as in wealth he was without a rival in Italy, so in meanness and  avarice there was not any in the entire world, however richly endowed with  those qualities, whom "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37329"],[0,"The Domestic Cat (#15)"],[1,"it in a very remarkable degree.  They know by some means, which I will not pretend to understand, those  individuals who have a soft side towards them.  Why, for instance, did  that strange cat at Lincoln single me out from dozens of people who were  on the street, and ask me to go to the rescue of her kitten?    Why do cats often pass other people by, and come up to me on the  pavement, requesting me to ring the bell, that they may get in out of  the wet?  There are two strange cats who sleep in the sun almost daily  in a corner of my front garden.  If any one comes along they bolt at  once, but when I pass up and down, they merely look at me and lie still;  and I never speak to them, unless, perhaps, just a passing word.  But,  what is still more strange, Theodore Nero walks up and down past them  without causing them the slightest alarm.  Yet, what a tremendous  monster he must appear to them!  They just look at him, wonderingly, as  much as to say: \"Oh, you great, good-natured-looking brute, however you  can catch mice and sparrows enough to fill your enormous stomach, I  can't tell?\"    I know a lady who is very fond of cats, and when out walking or shopping  in town, it is quite a usual thing for her to be accosted by some poor  half-starved waif or stray, and very often she goes into a shop and buys  food for them, for which, no doubt, they are grateful, and for which, no  doubt, she will one day receive her reward from Him who careth even for  the humble sparrows.  This lady was passing a house one time where a  poor cat was confined, the usual occupants having gone to the seaside,  and left pussy shut up in the empty house.  As soon as she stopped at  the door of the house, the cat's cries were quite pitiable to hear.  As  soon as this lady left the door, the cries ceased, only to be renewed  whenever she returned.  But pussy did not make the same noises when  others stopped in front of the door.    _A Cat deserting one Home for another_.--A tortoiseshell-and-white cat,  belonging now to a friend of mine, came into his possession in rather a  singular way.  The cat was originally the property of a neighbour of my  friend, whose house was on the opposite side of the street, and about  thirty yards off.  There she stayed, apparently perfectly contented and  happy, until she became the mother of four kittens.  Then, for some  reason or other known only to herself, she determined to shift her  quarters, and one day my friend was astonished to see Kate, as she was  called, march into his house with a kitten in her mouth, which she  deposited in a safe and comfortable corner, and then set off for the  others, which she brought one by one.  Remember this, the cat had never  been in my friend's house before!  Kate's kittens were taken back again  to her old home, and Kate marched them all over again to the home of her  choice.  And this was done every day for a whole week.    \"It's no earthly use, you know,\" Kate seemed to say.  \"What I says I  means, and what I does I sticks to.\"    And so my friend had to adopt both Kate and her family, previously  having failed in an attempt to starve her out, for Kate had adopted a  system of house-to-house begging, but always came home in the evening.    This cat for fourteen years used to sit patiently on the arm of her  master's chair until dinner was done and she was helped.    It is exceedingly rude, I know, to doubt a lady's word, but _can you  believe_ what follows?  'A lady assures me that she has such an  inexplicable and innate antipathy to cats, that if she enters a strange  room she can tell at once if there is a cat there, whether she sees it  or not.  And if a cat is carried suddenly into a room where she is, she  \"faints dead away.\"    Another lady friend of mine, who is very fond of animals of all sorts,  while living down in Brighton last October, was hastening home one  evening just about dusk, when she suddenly found that she was not alone,  but accompanied by some little black creature, which, immediately she  came under the gas-lamp, she found was a poor little stray kitten.  As  this wee puss bounded into the house as soon as the door was opened, of  course she believed it belonged to the house.  Going to her bedroom to  dress for dinner, there was little Miss Puss sitting on the bed singing,  and apparently perfectly satisfied with her new quarters, for the lady  soon found it did not belong to the house.    Pussy was treated to a saucerful of milk, and then sent adrift out into  the street, chased out with a broom, in fact, for the housemaid hated  cats.  This kitten didn't mean to be put off like this, however.  She  stopped out all night, certainly, but quietly came in with the charwoman  at five o'clock in the morning, and came directly to my friend's  bedroom.  There is no getting rid of a cat when it once concludes to  board itself upon you, and this little waif soon established herself for  good at Ashburnham House.  But here is the strange part of the business.  She seemed to know that my friend Mrs W. was only a visitor here, and  constantly showed great discretion, by sticking close to her apartments  and back-yard.  Just once she ventured down to the kitchen, and the old  residential cat bit a piece out of her ear.  \"If that is how you treat  visitors,\" said kitty, \"I'll stick to my own rooms in future.\"  And so  she did.    It is sometimes rather a difficult thing finding suitable apartments  when you are accompanied with pets.  It takes considerable tact, I can  assure you, to convince Mrs 'Arris, or whatever is the name of your  intended landlady, that your Newfoundland is so clean that you never can  see even a hair on the carpet; that your Pomeranian is an angel in  canine form; that your Persian cat wouldn't steal, if surrounded even by  the most tempting viands; that your macaw doesn't scream loud enough to  give all the terrace \"an 'eadache;\" and that your white rats never  escape and run all over the house.  Mrs W. had some difficulty about  her kitten when she went to the lodgings she had taken at Norwood.    \"I certainly did expect,\" her landlady observed, \"a lady with birds, and  a mouse, and a very large dog; but a cat I couldn't have, because I've  one of my own.\"    Mrs W. of course promised all sorts of impossibilities regarding her  pet, and her landlady finally gave in.    But, strange to say, this very house became the kitten's future home,  for the landlady's grandchild struck up a friendship with the wee pussy,  and when the child fell sick, the kitten would hardly ever leave her  little crib, nor would the child bear Miss Brighton, as she called her  feline favourite, out of her sight for a single moment.  Who shall say  how far the simple companionship, of this loving and affectionate wee  kitten, might not have tended to the child's restoration to perfect  health?    CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.    LOVE OF CHILDREN AND AFFECTION FOR OWNER.    There is hardly a domestic animal we possess that is not fond, to a  greater or less extent, of children.  How carefully a horse will pick  his steps if a child happens to fall amongst his feet!  I saw a bull one  day escape, wounded and furious, from a killing-house, and dash madly  along the turnpike road.  He knocked down and injured several people,  who could not get quickly enough out of his way; then there stood,  paralysed with fear, and right in the wild brute's path, a child of  tender years, which everyone who saw it gave up for lost; but the bull,  who did not hesitate to attack grown-up people, suddenly veered to one  side, and left this child unhurt!    My large Newfoundland dog is in the habit of careering along the street  with a speed which, considering his size, is quite incompatible with the  safety of the lieges.  Policemen, especially, very often find themselves  in the line of his rush, and Nero never hesitates to run clean through  these men, so to speak, leaving them sprawling on the ground with heels  in air; but the other day this dog, on suddenly rounding a corner, found  himself confronted with four little toddling infants, who, hand in hand,  were coming along the pavement.  There was no time to slacken speed, and  to proceed was certain death to one or more of the poor children, and  what do you think this noble fellow did? why lifted himself clean off  the pavement, and sprang high and clear over their heads.    The same dog was once in a hotel, when a friend of mine offered him a  biscuit.  Master Nero wasn't hungry; he would neither eat the biscuit  from my friend's hand nor from my own, but when the landlord's pretty  little daughter came running in, and threw her arms about his neck, and  caressed him, he hadn't the heart to refuse the biscuit from _her_  hands, and even accepted several from her, although still refusing them  from us.    But the domestic cat is, _par excellence_, the playmate and friend of  childhood.  What is it, indeed, that pussy will not bear from the hands  of its little child-mistress?  She may pull and lug pussy about any way  she pleases, or walk up and down the garden-walk with it slung over her  shoulder by the tail.  If such treatment does hurt the poor cat, she  takes good care not to show it.  It is amusing enough sometimes to watch  a little girl making a baby of her favourite pussy.  They are wearied  with gambolling together on the flowery lawn, and playing at  hide-and-seek among the shrubbery, and pussy \"_must_ be tired,\" says  little Alice.  Pussy enters into the joke at once, and seems positively  dead beat; so the basket is brought, the little night-cap is put on, the  shawl is carefully pinned around its shoulders, and this embryo mamma  puts her feline baby to bed and bids it sleep.  There is always two  words, however, with pussy as regards the sleeping part of the contract,  for little Alice never can get her baby to close more than one eye at a  time.  Pussy must see what is going on.  Anon the baby \"mu"]]]
