The gemmules are single and closely adherent at the base of the sponge.  Their spicules are very slender and minutely spined.    VI. _S._ (? _Stratospongilla_) _coggini_*, Annandale (W. China). Rec.  Ind. Mus. v, p. 198 (1910).    The gemmules apparently lack microscleres. They resemble those of _S.  clementis_, to which the species is probably related, in other respects.  The skeleton-spicules are spiny and rather stout, the species being  strongly developed at the two ends.    VII. _S._ (_Stratospongilla_) _sumatrana_*, Weber (Malay Archipelago).  Zool. Ergebnisse einer Reise in Niederlaendisch Ost-Indien, i. p. 38  (1890).    Closely allied to _S. indica_ (p. 100) but with pointed  skeleton-spicules.    VIII. _Ephydatia fortis_, Weltner (Philippines). Arch. Naturgesch.  lxi(i), p. 141 (1895).    This species is remarkable for the great development of the spines on  the shaft of the gemmule-spicules.    IX. _Ephydatia bogorensis_*, Weber (Malay Archipelago). Zool. Ergebnisse  einer Reise in Niederlaendisch Ost-Indien, i, p. 33 (1890).    The gemmule-spicules have rather narrow flattish disks, the edge of  which is feebly but closely serrated.    X. _E. blembingia_*, Evans (Malay Peninsula). Q. J. Microsc. Sci.  London, xliv, p. 81 (1901).    The gemmules resemble those of _Dosilia plumosa_ but are spherical.  There are no free microscleres.    XI. _Tubella vesparium_*, v. Martens (Borneo). Arch. Naturg.    Berlin, xxxiv, p. 62 (1868).    Closely related to _T. vesparioides_ (p. 189), but with spiny  megascleres.    As regards _Spongilla decipiens_*, Weber, from the Malay Archipelago,  see p. 97.      II.    HISTORY OF THE STUDY OF FRESHWATER SPONGES.    The bath-sponge was known to the Greeks at an early date, and Homer  refers to it as being used for cleansing furniture, for expunging  writing, and for ablutionary purposes. He also mentions its peculiar  structure, \"with many holes.\" \"Many things besides,\" wrote the English  naturalist Ray in his 'Historia Plantarum' (1686), \"regarding the powers  and uses of sponges have the Ancients: to them refer.\" Ray himself  describes at least one freshwater species, which had been found in an  English river, and refers to what may be another as having been brought  from America. In the eighteenth century Linne, Pallas and other authors  described the commoner European Spongillidae in general terms, sometimes  as plants and sometimes as animals, more usually as zoophytes or  \"plant-animals\" partaking of the nature of both kingdoms. The gemmules  were noted and referred to as seeds. The early naturalists of the  Linnaean Epoch, however, added little to the general knowledge of the  Spongillidae, being occupied with theory in which theological disputes  were involved rather than actual observation, and, notwithstanding the  fact that the animal nature of sponges was clearly demonstrated by  Ellis[U] in 1765, it was not until the nineteenth century was well  advanced that zoologists could regard sponges in anything like an  impartial manner.              [Footnote U: Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. lv, p. 280.]    One of the pioneers in the scientific study of the freshwater forms was  the late Dr. H. J. Carter, who commenced his investigations, and carried  out a great part of them, in Bombay with little of the apparatus now  considered necessary, and with a microscope that must have been grossly  defective according to modern ideas. His long series of papers  (1848-1887) published in the 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' is  an enduring monument to Indian zoology, and forms the best possible  introduction to the study of the Spongillidae. Even his earlier mistakes  are instructive, for they are due not so much to actual errors in  observation as to a faithful transcription of what was observed with  faulty apparatus.    Contemporary with Carter were two authors whose monographs on the  freshwater sponges did much to advance the study of the group, namely,  J. S. Bowerbank, whose account of the species known at the time was  published in the 'Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London' in  1882, and the veteran American naturalist Mr. Edward Potts, whose study  of the freshwater sponges culminated in his monograph published in the  'Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia' in  1887. Carter's own revision of the group was published in the 'Annals  and Magazine of Natural History' in 1881. The names of Vejdovsky, who  prefaced Potts's monograph with an account of the European species, and  of Dybowsky, who published several important papers on classification,  should also be mentioned, while Weltner's catalogue of the known species  (1895) is of the greatest possible value to students of the group.    Many authors have dealt with the physiology, reproduction and  development of the Spongillidae, especially in recent years; Dr. R.  Evans's description of the larva of _Spongilla lacustris_ (1899), and  his account of the development of the gemmule in _Ephydatia blembingia_  (1901), Zykoff's account of the development of the gemmule and of the  sponge from the gemmule (1892), and Weltner's observations on colour and  other points (1893, 1907), may be mentioned in particular. Laurent's  observations on development (1844), which were published in the 'Voyage  de la Bonite,' and especially the exquisite plates which accompany them,  have not received the notice they deserve, probably on account of their  method of publication.      LITERATURE.    The fullest account of the literature on the Spongillidae as yet  published will be found in the first of Weltner's 'Spongillidenstudien'  (Archiv fuer Naturgeschichte, lix (i), p. 209, 1893). Unfortunately it  contains no references of later date than 1892.

Upon after consideration, when all anger and irritation was gone, I  began to think it was hardly right or fair, or Christian either, to oppose  this marriage so strongly, without some better reason than I have to  assign. Marlow is a gentleman in all respects, of very good family too, I  believe. He is a good and excellent young man. His fortune, too, is not  inconsiderable, his prospects good, and his conduct under the deprivations  which we have lately suffered, and the loss of at least two-thirds of the  fortune he had a right to expect with Emily, has been all that is kind, and  amiable, and generous.\"    Mrs. Hazleton sat by the bedside, fixing her eyes full upon the countenance  of the invalid, and betraying not in the least the rage and disappointment  that were at her heart. They were not a whit the less bitter, however, or  fierce, or malignant; but rather the more so from the effort to smother  them. No one for a moment could have imagined that she was angry, even in  the least degree; and yet no disappointed demon ever felt greater fury at  being frustrated by the weakness or vacillation of a tool.    After staying for a moment to take breath, Lady Hastings proceeded, saying,  \"All these considerations, dear Mrs. Hazleton, have made me resolve to make  amends for what I have said--to withdraw the opposition I have hitherto  shown--and consent to the marriage.\"    Mrs. Hazleton retired for a moment into herself. For a minute or two she  was as silent as death--her cheek grew a little paler--her eyes lost their  lustre, and became dead and cold--they seemed looking at nothing, seeing  nothing--there was no speculation in them. The only thing that indicated  life and emotion was a slight quivering of the beautifully-chiselled lip.  There was a word echoing in the dark chambers of her heart in replying to  Lady Hastings. It was \"Never!\" but it was not spoken; and after a short and  thoughtful pause she recovered herself fully, and set about her work again.    \"My dear friend,\" she said, in a sweet tone, \"you have doubtless good  reasons for what you do. Far be it from me to say one word against your  doing what you think fit; only I should like to know what has made such a  change in your views, because I think perhaps you may be deceived.\"    \"Oh, no, I am not deceived,\" replied Lady Hastings, \"but really I cannot  enter into explanations. I have heard a great deal lately about many  things--especially this morning; but I--I--in fact, I promised not to tell  you.\"    Lady Hastings thought that in making this distinct declaration she was  performing a very magnanimous feat; but her little speech, short as it was,  contained three separate clauses or propositions, with each of which Mrs.  Hazleton proposed to deal separately. First, she asserted that she was not  deceived, and to this her companion replied, with a slight incredulous  smile, \"Are you quite sure, my friend? Here you are lying on a bed of  sickness, with no power of obtaining accurate information; while those who  are combined to win you to their wishes have every opportunity of conveying  hints to you, both directly and indirectly, which may not be altogether  false, but yet bear with them a false impression.\"    \"Oh, but there can be no possible doubt,\" said Lady Hastings, \"that Marlow  is the heir of the Earl of Launceston.\"    Mrs. Hazleton's brow contracted, and a quick flush passed over her cheek.  She had never before given attention to the fact--she had never thought of  it at all--but the moment it was mentioned, her knowledge of the families  of the nobility, and Mr. Marlow's connections, showed her that the  assertion was probably true. \"It may be so,\" she said, \"but I am very  doubtful. However, I will inquire, and let you know the truth, to-morrow.  And now, my dear friend, let us turn to something else. You say you have  heard a great deal to-day, and that you have promised not to tell  _me_--me--for you marked that word particularly. Now here I have a right to  demand some explanation; for your very words show that some person or  persons endeavor to prejudice your mind against me. What you have heard  must be some false charge. Otherwise the one who has been your friend for  years, who has been faithful, constant, attentive, kind, to the utmost  limit of her poor abilities, would not be selected for exclusion from your  confidence. They seek, in fact, by some false rumor, or ridiculous tale,  which you have not the means of investigating yourself, to deprive you of  advice and support. I charge no one in particular; but some one has done  this--if they had nothing to fear from frankness, they would not inculcate  a want of candor towards one who loves you, as they well know.\"    \"Why the fact is Emily said,\" replied Lady Hastings, \"that could only be  for a short time, and----\"    \"Emily!\" cried Mrs. Hazleton with a laugh, \"Emily indeed! Oh, then the  matter is easily understood--but pray what did Emily say? Dear Emily, she  is a charming girl--rather wayward--rather wilful--not always quite so  candid to her friends as I could wish; but these are all thoughts which,  will pass away with more knowledge of the world. She will learn to  discriminate between true friends and false ones--to trust and confide  entirely and without hesitation in those who really love her, and not to  repose her confidence in the dark and mysterious. Now I will undertake to  say that Emily has thrown out hints and inuendoes, without giving you very  clear and explicit information. She has asked you to wait patiently for a  time. It is always the dear child's way; but I did not think she would  practice it upon her own mother.\"    Now most people would have imagined, as Lady Hastings did imagine, that  Mrs. Hazleton's words proceeded from spite--mere spite; but such was not  the case: it was all art. She sought to pique Lady Hastings, knowing very  well that when once heated or angry, she lost all caution; and her great  object at that moment was to ascertain what Emily knew, and what Emily had  said. She was successful to a certain degree. She did pique Lady Hastings,  who replied at once, and somewhat sharply, though with the ordinary forms  of courtesy. \"I do not think you altogether do Emily justice, dear Mrs.  Hazleton, although you have in some degree divined the course she has  pursued. She did not exactly throw out inuendoes; but she made bold and  distinct charges, and though she did not proceed to the proofs, because  there was no time to do so, and also because there were particular reasons  for not doing so, yet she promised within a very few hours to establish  every assertion that she made beyond the possibility of doubt.    \"I thought so,\" said Mrs. Hazleton, in a somewhat abstracted tone, casting  her eyes round the room and taking up, apparently unconcerned, the vial of  medicine which stood by Lady Hastings' bedside. \"Pray, my dear friend, when  the revelation is made--if it ever be made--inform me of the particulars.\"    \"If it ever be made,\" exclaimed Lady Hastings. \"No revelation needs to be  made, Mrs. Hazleton--nothing is wanting but the proofs. Emily was explicit  enough as to the facts. She said that you had aided and assisted in  depriving my husband of his property, that in that and many other  particulars you had acted any thing but a friendly part, that you were  moved by a spirit of hatred against us all, and that very seldom had there  been any communications between our house and yours without some evil  following it--which is true enough.\"    She spoke with a good deal of vehemence, and raised herself somewhat on her  elbow, as if to utter her words more freely. In the mean while Mrs.  Hazleton sat silent and calm--as far as the exterior went at least--with  her eyes fixed upon a particular spot in the quilt from which they never  moved till Lady Hastings had done.    \"Grave charges,\" she said at length, \"very grave charges to bring against  one whom she has known from her infancy, and for whom she has professed  some regard--but no less false than grave, my dear friend. Now either one  of two things has happened: the first, which I mention merely as a  possibility, but without at all believing that such is the case--the first  is, I say, that Emily, judging your opposition to her proposed unequal  marriage to be abetted by myself, has devised these charges out of her own  head, in order to withdraw your confidence from me and gain her own  objects: the second is--and this is much more likely--that she has been  informed by some one, either maliciously or mistakenly, of some suspicions  and doubts such as are always more or less current in a country place, and  has perhaps embellished them a little in their transmission to you.--The  latter is certainly the most probable.--I suppose she did not tell you from  whom she received the information.\"    \"Not exactly,\" answered Lady Hastings, \"but one thing I know, which is,  that Mr. Dixwell the rector has all the same information, and if I  understood her rightly, has got it down in writing.\"    Mrs. Hazleton's cheek grew a shade paler; but she answered at once \"I am  glad to hear that; for now we come to something definite. All these charges  must be substantiated, dear friend--that is, if they can be  substantiated--\" she added with a smile.    \"You can easily understand that, attached to you by the bonds of a long  friendship, I cannot suffer my name to be traduced, or my conduct  impeached, even by your own daughter, without insisting upon a full  explanation, and clear, satisfactory proofs, or a recantation of"]]]
