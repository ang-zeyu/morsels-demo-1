The sphere of action for the military chiefs does not extend  beyond the natural frontiers of the peninsula, and their ambition,  restrained in their duty by public opinion, does not exceed a legitimate  object, the union of all Italy under one dominion. The members of the  aristocracy seem to inherit the exploits as well as the virtues of their  ancestors, and neither poverty nor obscurity of birth prevent merit from  reaching it. Curius Dentatus, Fabricius, and Coruncanius, can show  neither riches nor the images of their ancestors, and yet they attain to  the highest dignities; in fact, the plebeian nobility walks on a footing  of equality with the patrician. Both, in separating from the multitude,  tend more and more to amalgamate together;[222] but they remain rivals  in patriotism and disinterestedness.    In spite of the taste for riches introduced by the war of the  Sabines,[223] the magistrates maintained their simplicity of manners,  and protected the public domain against the encroachments of the rich by  the rigorous execution of the law, which limited to five hundred acres  the property which an individual was allowed to possess.[224]    The first citizens presented the most remarkable examples of integrity  and self-denial. Marcus Valerius Corvus, after occupying twenty-one  curule offices, returns to his fields without fortune, though not  without glory (419). Fabius Rullianus, in the midst of his victories and  triumphs, forgets his resentment towards Papirius Cursor, and names him  dictator, sacrificing thus his private feelings to the interests of his  country (429). Marcus Curius Dentatus keeps for himself no part of the  rich spoils taken from the Sabines, and, after having vanquished  Pyrrhus, resumes the simplicity of country life (479).[225] Fabricius  rejects the money which the Samnites offer him for his generous  behaviour towards them, and disdains the presents of Pyrrhus (476).  Coruncanius furnishes an example of all the virtues.[226] Fabius Gurges,  Fabius Pictor, and Ogulnius, pour into the treasury the magnificent  gifts they had brought back from their embassy to Alexandria.[227] M.  Rutilius Censorinus, struck with the danger of entrusting twice in  succession the censorship in the same hands, refuses to be re-elected to  that office (488).    The names of many others might be cited, who, then and in later ages,  did honour to the Roman Republic; but let us add, that if the ruling  class knew how to call to it all the men of eminence, it forgot not to  recompense brilliantly those especially who favoured its interests:  Fabius Rullianus, for instance, the victor in so many battles, received  the name of \"most great\" (_Maximus_) only for having, at the time of his  censorship, annulled in the comitia the influence of the poor class,  composed of freedmen, whom he distributed among the urban tribes (454),  where their votes were lost in the multitude of others.[228]    The popular party, on its own side, ceased not to demand new  concessions, or to claim the revival of those which had fallen out of  use. Thus, it obtained, in 428, the re-establishment of the law of  Servius Tullius, which decided that the goods only of the debtor, and  not his body, should be responsible for his debt.[229] In 450, Flavius,  the son of a freedman, made public the calendar and the formulae of  proceedings, which deprived the patricians of the exclusive knowledge of  civil and religious law.[230] But the lawyers found means of weakening  the effects of the measure of Flavius by inventing new formulae, which  were almost unintelligible to the public.[231] The plebeians, in 454,  were admitted into the college of the pontiffs, and into that of the  augurs; the same year, it was found necessary to renew for the third  time the law Valeria, _de provocatione_.    In 468, the people again withdrew to the Janiculum, demanding the  remission of debts, and crying out against usury.[232] Concord was  restored only when they had obtained, first, by the law Hortensia, that  the plebiscita should be obligatory on all; and next, by the law Marcia,  that the orders obtained through Publilius Philo in 415 should be  restored to vigour. These orders, as we have seen above, obliged the  Senate to declare in advance whether or not the laws presented to the  comitia were contrary to public and religious law.[233]    The ambition of Rome seemed to be without bounds; yet all her wars had  for reason or pretext the defence of the weak and the protection of her  allies. Indeed, the cause of the wars against the Samnites was sometimes  the defence of the inhabitants of Capua, sometimes that of the  inhabitants of Palaeopolis, sometimes that of the Lucanians. The war  against Pyrrhus had its origin in the assistance claimed by the  inhabitants of Thurium; and the support claimed by the Mamertines will  soon lead to the first Punic war.    The Senate, we have seen, put in practice the principles which found  empires and the virtues to which war gives birth. Thus, for all the  citizens, equality of rights; in face of danger to their country,  equality of duties and even suspension of liberty. To the most worthy,  honours and the command. No magisterial charge for him who has not  served in the ranks of the army. The example is furnished by the most  illustrious and richest families: at the battle of Lake Regillus (258),  the principal senators were mingled in the ranks of the legions;[234] at  the combat near the Cremera, the three hundred and six Fabii, who all,  according to Titus Livius, were capable of filling the highest offices,  perished fighting. Later, at Cannae, eighty senators, who had enrolled  themselves as mere soldiers, fell on the field of battle.[235] The  triumph is accorded for victories which enlarged the territory, but not  for those which only recovered lost ground. No triumph in civil  wars:[236] in such case, success, be what it may, is always a subject  for public mourning. The consuls or proconsuls seek to be useful to  their country without false susceptibility; to-day in the first rank,  to-morrow in the second, they serve with the same devotion under the  orders of him whom they commanded the previous day. Servilius, consul in  281, becomes, the year following, the lieutenant of Valerius. Fabius,  after so many triumphs, consents to be only lieutenant to his son. At a  later period, Flamininus, who had vanquished the King of Macedonia,  descends again through patriotism, after the victory of Cynoscephalae,  to the grade of tribune of the soldiers;[237] the great Scipio himself,  after the defeat of Hannibal, serves as lieutenant under his brother in  the war against Antiochus.    To sacrifice everything to patriotism is the first duty. By devoting  themselves to the gods of Hades, like Curtius and the two Decii, people  believed they bought, at the price of their lives, the safety of the  others or victory.[238] Discipline is enforced even to cruelty: Manlius  Torquatus, after the example of Postumius Tubertus, punishes with death  the disobedience of his son, though he had gained a victory. The  soldiers who have fled are decimated; those who abandon their ranks or  the field of battle are devoted, some to execution, others to dishonour;  and those who have allowed themselves to be made prisoners by the enemy  are disdained as unworthy of the price of freedom.[239]    Surrounded by warlike neighbours, Rome must either triumph or cease to  exist; hence her superiority in the art of war, for, as Montesquieu  says, in transient wars most of the examples are lost; peace brings  other ideas, and its faults and even its virtues are forgotten; hence  that contempt of treason and that disdain for the advantages it  promises: Camillus sends home to their parents the children of the first  families of Falerii, delivered up to him by their schoolmaster; the  Senate rejects with indignation the offer of the physician of Pyrrhus,  who proposes to poison that prince;--hence that religious observance of  oaths and that respect for engagements which have been contracted: the  Roman prisoners to whom Pyrrhus had given permission to repair to Rome  for the festival of Saturn, all return to him faithful to their word;  and Regulus leaves the most memorable example of faithfulness to his  oath!--hence that skilful and inflexible policy which refuses peace  after a defeat, or a treaty with the enemy so long as he is on the soil  of their country; which makes use of war to divert people from domestic  troubles;[240] gains the vanquished by benefits if they submit, and  admits them by degrees into the great Roman family; and, if they resist,  strikes them without pity and reduces them to slavery;[241]--hence that  anxious provision for multiplying upon the conquered territories the  race of agriculturists and soldiers;--hence, lastly, the improving  spectacle of a town which becomes a people, and of a people which  embraces the world.          CHAPTER IV.    PROSPERITY OF THE BASIN OF THE MEDITERRANEAN BEFORE THE PUNIC WARS.      [Sidenote: Commerce of the Mediterranean.]    I. Rome had required two hundred and forty-four years to form her  constitution under the kings, a hundred and seventy-two to establish and  consolidate the consular Republic, seventy-two to complete the conquest  of Italy, and now it will cost her nearly a century and a half to obtain  the domination of the world--that is, of Northern Africa, Spain, the  south of Gaul, Illyria, Epirus, Greece, Macedonia, Asia Minor, Syria,  and Egypt. Before undertaking the recital of these conquests, let us  halt an instant to consider the condition of the basin of the  Mediterranean at this period, of that sea round which were successively  unfolded all the great dramas of ancient history. In this examination we "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45464"],[0,"The Mormon Doctrine of Deity: The Roberts-Van Der Donckt Discussion (#15)"],[1," or  in any sense or manner a creature, but that he is the eternal and only  Son of God, God of God, Light of Light; the expression of the Eternal  Father, with whom he is one in nature and substance, and to whom he is  equal in all divine attributes, power and glory.\"--_Improvement Era_,  vol. i, p. 14.]    On the other hand, if it be contended that besides the Son of God,  Jesus, a personage of flesh and bone and spirit, there exists God,  a spirit, then there is likely to arise again the conception of the  \"substance\" being divided, and the existence of two individual Gods  instead of one. The one a spirit unembodied, and the other a spirit  enclosed in a body of flesh and bone--the glorified, exalted Man,  Christ. This danger is also increased by the part of the creed now  being considered, _viz_., \"Such as the Father is, such is the Son;\" for  it must follow, if this be true that such as the Son is, such is the  Father also. And this, must hold with reference to God, wholly; to his  substance, essence, personality, form, as well as to all attributes  possessed, or else it is not true at all. And if true, since we know  that Jesus is an immortal being of flesh and bone and spirit united  into one glorious personage (and Mr. V. admits that, and also that the  blessed in heaven shall see him as such a personage, literally \"face to  face\"), then God the Father must be the same, a personage of flesh and  bone and spirit united--a thing most abhorrent to Mr. V.'s principles.    At this point, I must complain of the gentleman's argument a little.  However able and fair his article may be considered on the whole, I  think, on the question of the \"form of God,\" I am justified in charging  that he has not dealt at all with my strong scripture proofs relative  to that matter. He makes but the very slightest reference to the  passage:          And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. * *      * So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created      he him; male and female created he them (Genesis 1:26, 27).    And he considered nowhere the very definite passage:          God * * hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son. * * *      who, being the brightness of his glory _and the express image of      his person_, and upholding all things by the word of his power,      when he hath by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand      of the Majesty on high (Heb. 1:3).    \"Now,\" to use the solemn words of the Reverend gentleman himself, \"we  must believe whatever God reveals to us upon one single word of his,  just as firmly as upon a thousand\"--I shall hold that it was incumbent  upon Mr. V. to deal with these passages, and set forth in what way they  are to be understood, if _not_ to be understood as they read.[A] I can  think of no language that could express the truth more forcibly, that  man was created in the form of God and, therefore, that God in form is  like man, than the language of these two passages. When the word of God  says: \"God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he  him;\" and then again, in speaking of Jesus, who certainly bore all the  semblance, figure and stature of a man--who was a man--when the divine  Spirit, I say, in speaking of him, says that _he was the express image  of God's person_--I shall despair of human language expressing any fact  whatsoever, if this language does not say that in form God and man are  alike. And what the word of God in plainness teaches--so plain that he  who \"runs may read,\" so plain that \"wayfaring men though fools need not  err therein\"--\"is not to be set aside by the gratuitous assertions\" of  \"religious innovators\" of early Christian centuries who corrupted the  plain meaning of God's word by their vain philosophies, and oppositions  of science, falsely so called. Mr. Van Der Donckt makes no reference  to this plain passage in Hebrews 1:3; and I am under the necessity of  thinking that in respect of this passage and the one in Genesis, he had  no means at his command by which he could satisfactorily explain away  their force. They stand, therefore, with their strength unimpaired, in  proof of the doctrines taught in the discourse at which Mr V. leveled  his Reply.    [Footnote A: The meaning of this language from the 26th verse of the  first chapter of Genesis is made perfectly clear when compared with  the third verse of the 5th chapter of Genesis where it is written:  \"And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his  own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth.\" What do  these words imply but that Seth was like his father in features and  also doubtless in intellectual and moral qualities? And if when it  is said Adam begat a son in his \"own likeness, after his image,\" it  simply means that Seth in form and features and intellectual and moral  qualities was like his father--then there can be no other conclusion  formed upon the passage that says God created man in his own image  and likeness than that man, in a general way, in form and feature and  intellectual and moral qualities was like God.]    Of God Being Invisible.    Mr. Van Der Donckt thinks he sees further proof of God's being a  \"Spirit,\" and therefore immaterial or bodiless, in the fact that he  is spoken of in the Bible as being \"invisible.\" Moses \"was strong as  seeing him that is invisible,\" (Heb. 11:27;) \"No man hath seen God at  any time\" (I John 4:12;) \"The King of kings--whom no man hath seen nor  can see,\" (I Tim. 6:16); are the passages he relies upon for the proof  of his contention.    Of course, Mr. V. is aware of the fact--for he mentions it--that these  passages are confronted with the explicit statement of scripture  that God has been seen by men. Moses saw him. At one stage of his  experience, the great Hebrew prophet was told that he could not see  God's face; \"for,\" said the Lord, \"there shall no man see me and live.\"  But even at that time, Moses was placed in a cleft of the rock, \"and  thou shalt see my back parts,\" said the Lord to him; \"but my face shall  not be seen\" (Exodus 23:18-23). On another occasion, Moses, Aaron,  Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, saw God.          And they saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it      were a paved work of sapphire stone, and as it were the body of      heaven in his clearness. And upon the nobles of the children of      Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and      drink (Ex. 24:9-11).    Isaiah saw him: \"I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted  up, and his train filled the temple.\" At the same time the seraphims  proclaimed his holiness, saying, \"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of  hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.\" Then said Isaiah: \"Woe  is me! for lam undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell  in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have seen the  King, the Lord of hosts\" (Isaiah 6:1-5).    To harmonize these apparitions of God to men with his theory of the  invisibility of God, Mr. V. appeals to the writings of some of the  Christian fathers, and Cardinal Newman, from whose teachings he  concludes that God the Father is called \"invisible\" because \"he never  appeared to bodily eyes; whereas the Son manifested himself as an  angel, and as a man after his incarnation. * * * Whenever the Eternal  Son of God, or angels at God's behest, showed themselves to man, they  became visible only through a body, _or a material garb assumed for the  occasion!_\"    Surely Tertullian, Ambrose, Augustine, the great English Cardinal  of the Roman church, and Mr. V. are in sore straits when they must  needs take refuge in the belief of such jugglery with matter as this,  in order to reconcile apparently conflicting scriptures. And what a  shuffling off and on of material garbs there must have been, as from  time to time hosts of angels and spirits appeared unto men!    It is but the materialization of the spiritualist mediums on a little  larger scale. But there is a better way of harmonizing the seeming  contradictions; and better authority for the conclusion to be reached  than the Christian fathers and Cardinal Newman. I mean the scriptures  themselves.    Take this expression of the scripture, \"No man hath seen God at any  time\" (I John 4:12). Standing alone, it seems emphatic and conclusive.  And in the same connection this also, from the testimony of John:  \"No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son which is in  the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him\" (St. John 1:18). But  consider these texts in connection with what the Master himself said  on the same subject: \"It is written in the prophets, And they shall  be all taught of God. Every man, therefore, that hath heard, and hath  learned of the Father, cometh unto me. Not that any man hath seen the  Father, _save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father_\" (St. John  6:45, 46). Now we have the key to the matter. \"No man hath seen God  at any time, _save_ [except] _he which is of God, he hath seen the  Father._\" If any one shall contend that this \"_he which is of God_\"  has reference to Jesus only, the complete answer to that will be found  in the account of the Martyr Stephen's glorious view of the Father and  the Son together and at one time: \"But he [Stephen] being full of the  Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven, _and saw the glory or  God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, and said, \"Behold,  I see the heavens opened, and the ton of Man standing on the right  hand of God_.\" (Acts 7:55-6). Undoubtedly, for reasons that are wise,  God the Father has been \"invisible\" to men except under very special  conditions; for the most part the \"Only Begotten hath declared him,\"  and stood as his representative; and in the absence of those special  conditions, no man hath seen God the Father; no man in the absence of  these conditions can see"]]]
