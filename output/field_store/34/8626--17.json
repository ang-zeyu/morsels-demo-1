For simpler cases or lighter objects strips of sacking, or even  paper, applied with flour and water, suffice, or pieces of sacking  soaked in thin plaster may be laid over the bone, first covering it with  thin paper in order that the plaster jacket may simply stiffen and not  adhere to it. Collecting has not always been carried on in this  systematic manner, for the development of the present methods has been  the result of years of experience; formerly there was a mere  skimming-over of the surface in what Professor Marsh used to term the  potato-gathering style, but now the effort is made to remove specimens  intact, often imbedded in large masses of rock, in order that all parts  may be preserved.    We will take it for granted that our specimens have safely passed  through all perils by land and water, road and rail; that they have been  quarried, boxed, carted over a roadless country to the nearest railway,  and have withstood 2,000 miles of jolting in a freight-car. The first  step in reconstruction has been taken; the problem, now that the boxes  are reposing on the work-room floor, is to make the blocks of stone give  up the secrets they have guarded for ages, to free the bones from their  enveloping matrix in order that they may tell us something of the life  of the past. The method of doing this varies with the conditions under  which the material has been gathered, and if from hard clay, chalk, or  shale, the process, though tedious enough at best, is by no means so  difficult as if the specimens are imbedded in solid rock. In this case  the fragments from a given section of quarry must be assembled according  to the plan which has been carefully made as the work of exhumation  progressed, all pieces containing bone must be stuck together, and weak  parts strengthened with gum or glue. Now the mass is attacked with  hammer and chisel, and the surrounding matrix slowly and carefully cut  away until the contained bone is revealed, a process much simpler and  more expeditious in the telling than in the actuality; for the  preparator may not use the heavy tools of the ordinary stone-cutter:  sometimes an awl, or even a glover's needle, must suffice him, and the  chips cut off are so small and such care must be taken not to injure the  bone that the work is really tedious. This may, perhaps, be better  appreciated by saying that to clean a single vertebra of such a huge  Dinosaur as Diplodocus may require a month of continuous labor, and that  a score of these big and complicated bones, besides others of simpler  structure, are included in the backbone. The finished specimen weighs  over 120 pounds, while as originally collected, with all the adherent  rock, the weight was twice or thrice as great. Such a mass as this is  comparatively small, and sometimes huge blocks are taken containing  entire skulls or a number of bones, and not infrequently weighing a  ton. The largest single specimen is a skull of Triceratops, collected by  Mr. J. B. Hatcher, which weighed, when boxed, 3,650 pounds.    Or, as the result of some mishap, or through the work of an  inexperienced collector, a valuable specimen may arrive in the shape of  a box full of irregular fragments of stone compared with which a  dissected map or an old-fashioned Chinese puzzle is simplicity itself,  and one may spend hours looking for some piece whose proper location  gives the clew to an entire section, and days, even, may be consumed  before the task is completed. While this not only tries the patience,  but the eyes as well, there is, nevertheless, a fascination about this  work of fashioning a bone out of scores, possibly hundreds, of  fragments, and watching the irregular bits of stone shaping themselves  into a mosaic that forms a portion of some creature, possibly quite new  to science, and destined to bear a name as long as itself. And thus,  after many days of toil, the bone that millions of years before sank  into the mud of some old lake-bottom or was buried in the sandy shoals  of an ancient river, is brought to light once more to help tell the tale  of the creatures of the past.    One bone might convey a great deal of information; on the other hand it  might reveal very little; for, while it is very painful to say so, the  popular impression that it is possible to reconstruct an animal from a  single bone, or tell its size and habits from a tooth is but partially  correct, and sometimes \"the eminent scientist\" has come to grief even  with a great many bones at his disposal. Did not one of the ablest  anatomists describe and figure the hip-bones of a Dinosaur as its  shoulder-blade, and another, equally able, reconstruct a reptile \"hind  side before,\" placing the head on the tail! This certainly sounds absurd  enough; but just as absurd mistakes are made by men in other walks of  life, often with far more deplorable results.    Before passing to the restoration of the exterior of animals it may be  well to say something of the manner in which the skeleton of an extinct  animal may be reconstructed and the meaning of its various parts  interpreted. For the adjustment of the muscles is dependent on the  structure of the skeleton, and putting on the muscles means blocking out  the form, details of external appearance being supplied by the skin and  its accessories of hair, scales, or horns. Let us suppose in the present  instance that we are dealing with one of the great reptiles known as  Triceratops whose remains are among the treasures of the National Museum  at Washington, for the reconstruction of the big beast well illustrates  the methods of the palaeontologist and also the troubles by which he is  beset. Moreover, this is not a purely imaginary case, but one that is  very real, for the skeleton of this animal which was shown at Buffalo  was restored in papier-mache in exactly the manner indicated. We have a  goodly number of bones, but by no means an entire skeleton, and yet we  wish to complete the skeleton and incidentally to form some idea of the  creature's habits. Now we can interpret the past only by a knowledge of  the present, and it is by carefully studying the skeletons of the  animals of to-day that we can learn to read the meaning of the symbols  of bones left by the animals of a million yesterdays. Thus we find that  certain characters distinguish the bone of a mammal from that of a bird,  a reptile, or a fish, and these in turn from one another, and this  constitutes the A B C of comparative anatomy. And, in a like manner, the  bones of the various divisions of these main groups have to a greater or  less extent their own distinguishing characteristics, so that by first  comparing the bones of extinct animals with those of creatures that are  now living we are enabled to recognize their nearest existing relative,  and then by comparing them with one another we learn the relations they  bore in the ancient world. But it must be borne in mind that some of the  early beasts were so very different from those of to-day that until  pretty much their entire structure was known there was nothing with  which to compare odd bones. Had but a single incomplete specimen of  Triceratops come to light we should be very much in the dark concerning  him; and although remains of some thirty individuals have been  discovered, these have been so imperfect that we are very far from  having all the information we need. A great part of the head, with its  formidable looking horns, is present, and although the nose is gone, we  know from other specimens that it, too, was armed with a knob, or horn,  and that the skull ended in a beak, something like that of a snapping  turtle, though formed by a separate and extra bone; similarly the end of  the lower jaw is lacking, but we may be pretty certain that it ended in  a beak, to match that of the skull. The large leg-bones of our specimen  are mostly represented, for these being among the more solid parts of  the skeleton are more frequently preserved than any others, and though  some are from one side and some from another, this matters not. If the  hind legs were disproportionately long it would indicate that our animal  often or habitually walked erect, but as there is only difference enough  between the fore and hind limbs to enable Triceratops to browse  comfortably from the ground we would naturally place him on all fours,  even were the skull not so large as to make the creature too top-heavy  for any other mode of locomotion. Were the limbs very small in  comparison with the other bones, it would obviously mean that their  owner passed his life in the water. For a skeleton has a twofold  meaning, it is the best, the most enduring, testimony we have as to an  animal's place in nature and the relationships it sustains to the  creatures that lived with it, before it, and after it. More than this, a  skeleton is the solution of a problem in mechanics, the problem of  carrying a given weight and of adaptation to a given mode of life. Thus  the skeleton varies according as a creature dwells on land, in the  water, or in the air, and according as it feeds on grass or preys upon  its fellows.    And so the mechanics of a skeleton afford us a clew to the habits of the  living animal. Something, too, may be gathered from the structure of the  leg-bones, for solid bones mean either a sluggish animal or a creature  of more or less aquatic habits, while hollow bones emphatically declare  a land animal, and an active one at that; and this, in the case of the  Dinosaurs, hints at predatory habits, the ability to catch and eat their  defenceless and more sluggish brethren.

Many people would sacrifice five years of their lives for three  hundred and fifty thousand francs.\"    \"But monsieur, had I calculated in the manner you describe, I should not  have been content with three hundred and fifty thousand francs; I should  have waited for an opportunity to steal half a million. I often have  that sum in charge.\"    \"Oh! it is not always convenient to wait.\"    Prosper was buried in deep thought for some minutes.    \"Monsieur,\" he finally said, \"there is one detail I forgot to mention  before, and it may be of importance.\"    \"Explain, if you please.\"    \"The office messenger whom I sent to the Bank of France for the money  must have seen me tie up the bundle, and put it away in the safe. At any  rate, he knows that I left the bank before he did.\"    \"Very well; the man shall be examined. Now you can return to your  cell; and once more I advise you to consider the consequences of your  persistent denial.\"    M. Patrigent thus abruptly dismissed Prosper because he wished to  immediately act upon this last piece of information.    \"Sigault,\" said he as soon as Prosper had left the room, \"is not this  Antonin the man who was excused from testifying because he sent a  doctor's certificate declaring him too ill to appear?\"    \"It is, monsieur.\"    \"Where doe he live?\"    \"Fanferlot says he was so ill that he was taken to the hospital--the  Dubois Hospital.\"    \"Very well. I am going to examine him to-day, this very hour. Take your  pen and paper, and send for a carriage.\"    It was some distance from the Palais de Justice to the Dubois Hospital;  but the cabman, urged by the promise of a large fee, made his sorry  jades fly as if they were blooded horses.    Would Antonin be able to answer any questions?    The physician in charge of the hospital said that, although the man  suffered horribly from a broken knee, his mind was perfectly clear.    \"That being the case, monsieur,\" said the judge, \"I wish to examine him,  and desire that no one be admitted while he makes his deposition.\"    \"Oh! you will not be intruded upon, monsieur; his room contains four  beds, but they are just now unoccupied.\"    When Antonin saw the judge enter, followed by a little weazened man in  black, with a portfolio under his arm, he at once knew what he had come  for.    \"Ah,\" he said, \"monsieur comes to see me about M. Bertomy's case?\"    \"Precisely.\"    M. Patrigent remained standing by the sick-bed while Sigault arranged  his papers on a little table.    In answer to the usual questions, the messenger swore that he was named  Antonin Poche, was forty years old, born at Cadaujac (Gironde), and was  unmarried.    \"Now,\" said the judge, \"are you well enough to clearly answer any  questions I may put?\"    \"Certainly, monsieur.\"    \"Did you, on the 27th of February, go to the Bank of France for the  three hundred and fifty thousand francs that were stolen?\"    \"Yes, monsieur.\"    \"At what hour did you return with the money?\"    \"It must have been five o'clock when I got back.\"    \"Do you remember what M. Bertomy did when you handed him the notes? Now,  do not be in a hurry; think before you answer.\"    \"Let me see: first he counted the notes, and made them into four  packages; then he put them in the safe; and then--it seems to me--and  then he locked the safe; and, yes, I am not mistaken, he went out!\"    He uttered these last words so quickly, that, forgetting his knee, he  half started up, but, with a cry of pain, sank back in bed.    \"Are you sure of what you say?\" asked the judge.    M. Patrigent's solemn tone seemed to frighten Antonin.    \"Sure?\" he replied with marked hesitation, \"I would bet my head on it,  yet I am not sure!\"    It was impossible for him to be more decided in his answers. He had been  frightened. He already imagined himself in difficulty, and for a trifle  would have retracted everything.    But the effect was already produced; and when they retired M. Patrigent  said to Sigault:    \"This is a very important piece of evidence.\"          VI    The Archangel Hotel, Mme. Gypsy's asylum, was the most elegant building  on the Quai St. Michel.    A person who pays her fortnight's board in advance is treated with  consideration at this hotel.    Mme. Alexandre, who had been a handsome woman, was now stout, laced till  she could scarcely breathe, always over-dressed, and fond of wearing a  number of flashy gold chains around her fat neck.    She had bright eyes and white teeth; but, alas, a red nose. Of all her  weaknesses, and Heaven knows she had indulged in every variety, only one  remained; she loved a good dinner, washed down with plenty of good wine.    She also loved her husband; and, about the time M. Patrigent was leaving  the hospital, she began to be worried that her \"little man\" had not  returned to dinner. She was about to sit down without him, when the  hotel-boy cried out:    \"Here is monsieur.\"    And Fanferlot appeared in person.    Three years before, Fanferlot had kept a little office of secret  intelligence; Mme. Alexandre was a trader without a license in perfumery  and toilet articles, and, finding it necessary to watch some of her  suspicious customers, engaged Fanferlot's services; this was the origin  of their acquaintance.    If they went through the marriage ceremony for the good of the mayoralty  and the church, it was because they imagined it would, like a baptism,  wash out the sins of the past.    Upon this momentous day, Fanferlot gave up his secret intelligence  office, and entered the police, where he had already been occasionally  employed, and Mme. Alexandre retired from trade.    Uniting their savings, they hired and furnished the \"Archangel,\"  which they were now carrying on prosperously well, esteemed by their  neighbors, who were ignorant of Fanferlot's connection with the police  force.    \"Why, how late you are, my little man!\" she exclaimed, as she dropped  her knife and fork, and rushed forward to embrace him.    He received her caresses with an air of abstraction.    \"My back is broken,\" he said. \"I have been the whole day playing  billiards with Evariste, M. Fauvel's valet, and allowed him to win as  often as he wished, a man who does not know what 'the pool' is! I became  acquainted with him yesterday, and now I am his best friend. If I wish  to enter M. Fauvel's service in Antonin's place, I can rely upon M.  Evariste's good word.\"    \"What, you be an office messenger? you?\"    \"Of course I would. How else am I to get an opportunity of studying my  characters, if I am not on the spot to watch them all the time?\"    \"Then the valet gave you no news?\"    \"He gave me none that I could make use of, and yet I turned him inside  out, like a glove. This banker is a remarkable man; you don't often meet  with one of his sort nowadays. Evariste says he has not a single vice,  not even a little defect by which his valet could gain ten sous. He  neither smokes, drinks, nor plays; in fact, he is a saint. He is worth  millions, and lives as respectably and quietly as a grocer. He is  devoted to his wife, adores his children, is lavishly hospitable, and  seldom goes into society.\"    \"Then his wife is young?\"    \"She must be about fifty.\"    Mme. Alexandre reflected a minute, then asked:    \"Did you inquire about the other members of the family?\"    \"Certainly. The younger son is in the army. The elder son, Lucien, lives  with his parents, and is as proper as a young lady; so good, indeed,  that he is stupid.\"    \"And what about the niece?\"    \"Evariste could tell me nothing about her.\"    Mme. Alexandre shrugged her fat shoulders.    \"If you have discovered nothing, it is because there is nothing to be  discovered. Still, do you know what I would do, if I were you?\"    \"Tell me.\"    \"I would consult with M. Lecoq.\"    Fanferlot jumped up as if he had been shot.    \"Now, that's pretty advice! Do you want me to lose my place? M. Lecoq  does not suspect that I have anything to do with the case, except to  obey his orders.\"    \"Nobody told you to let him know you were investigating it on your own  account. You can consult him with an air of indifference, as if you were  not at all interested; and, after you have got his opinion, you can take  advantage of it.\"    The detective weighed his wife's words, and then said:    \"Perhaps you are right; yet M. Lecoq is so devilishly shrewd, that he  might see through me.\"    \"Shrewd!\" echoed Mme. Alexandre, \"shrewd! All of you at the police  office say that so often, that he has gained his reputation by it: you  are just as sharp as he is.\"    \"Well, we will see. I will think the matter over; but, in the meantime,  what does the girl say?\"    The \"girl\" was Mme. Nina Gypsy.    In taking up her abode at the Archangel, the poor girl thought she  was following good advice; and, as Fanferlot had never appeared in her  presence since, she was still under the impression that she had obeyed  a friend of Prosper's. When she received her summons from M. Patrigent,  she admired the wonderful skill of the police in discovering her  hiding-place; for she had established herself at the hotel under a  false, or rather her true name, Palmyre Chocareille.    Artfully questioned by her inquisitive landlady, she had, without any  mistrust, confided her history to her.    Thus Fanferlot was able to impress the judge with the idea of his being  a skilful detective, when he pretended to have discovered all this  information from a variety of sources.    \"She is still upstairs,\" answered Mme. Alexandre. \"She suspects nothing;  but to keep her in her present ignorance becomes daily more difficult.  I don't know what the judge told her, but she came home quite beside  herself with anger. She wanted to go and make a fuss at M. Fauvel's;  then she wrote a letter which she told Jean to post for her; but I kept  it to show you.\"    \"What!\" interrupted Fanferlot, \"you have a letter, and did not tell  me before?"]]]
