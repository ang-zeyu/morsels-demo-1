Our situation at that time, though very alarming, would not permit us to  spend much time in reflection; so we loaded our sledges to the best  advantage (but were obliged to throw away some bags of shot and ball),  and immediately set out on our return. In the course of the day's walk  we were fortunate enough to kill several partridges, for which we were  all very thankful, as it was the first meal we had had for several days:  indeed, for the five preceding days we had not killed as much as  amounted to half a partridge for each man; and some days had not a  single mouthful. While we were in this distress, the Northern Indians  were by no means in want; for as they always walked foremost, they {7}  had ten times the chance to kill partridges, rabbits, or any other thing  which was to be met with, than we had. Beside this advantage, they had  great stocks of flour, oatmeal, and other English provisions, which they  had embezzled out of my stock during the early part of the journey; and  as one of my home Indians, called Mackachy, and his wife, who is a  Northern Indian woman, always resorted to the Northern Indians tents,  where they got amply supplied with provisions when neither I nor my men  had a single mouthful, I have great reason to suspect they had a  principal hand in the embezzlement: indeed, both the man and his wife  were capable of committing any crime, however diabolical.    [Sidenote: 1769. December. 1st.]    This day we had fine pleasant weather for the season of the year: we set  out early in the morning, and arrived the same day at Seal River, along  which we continued our course for several days. In our way we killed  plenty of partridges, and saw many deer; but the weather was so  remarkably serene that the Indians only killed two of the latter. By  this time game was become so plentiful, that all apprehensions of  starving were laid aside; and though we were heavily laden, and  travelled pretty good days' journeys, yet as our spirits were good, our  strength gradually returned.    [Sidenote: 5th.]    In our course down Seal River we met a stranger, a Northern Indian, on a  hunting excursion; and though {8} he had not met with any success that  day, yet he kindly invited us to his tent, saying he had plenty of  venison at my service; and told the Southern Indians, that as there were  two or three beaver houses near his tent, he should be glad of their  assistance in taking them, for there was only one man and three women at  the tent.    [Sidenote: 1769. December.]    Though we were at that time far from being in want of provisions, yet we  accepted his offer, and set off with our new guide for his tent, which,  by a comparative distance, he told us, was not above five miles from the  place where we met him, but we found it to be nearer fifteen; so that it  was the middle of the night before we arrived at it. When we drew near  the tent, the usual signal for the approach of strangers was given, by  firing a gun or two, which was immediately answered by the man at the  tent. On our arrival at the door, the good man of the house came out,  shook me by the hand, and welcomed us to his tent; but as it was too  small to contain us all, he ordered his women to assist us in pitching  our tent; and in the mean time invited me and as many of my crew as his  little habitation could contain, and regaled us with the best in the  house. The pipe went round pretty briskly, and the conversation  naturally turned on the treatment we had received from Chawchinahaw and  his gang; which was always answered by our host with, \"Ah! if I had  been there, it should not have been so!\" when, notwithstanding his  hospitality on the present occasion, he {9} would most assuredly have  acted the same part as the others had done, if he had been of the party.    Having refreshed ourselves with a plentiful supper, we took leave of our  host for a while, and retired to our tent; but not without being made  thoroughly sensible that many things would be expected from me before I  finally left them.    [Sidenote: 6th.]    Early in the morning, my Indians assisted us in taking the beaver houses  already mentioned[27]; but the houses being small, and some of the  beavers escaping, they only killed six, all of which were cooked the  same night, and voraciously devoured under the denomination of a feast.  I also received from the Indians several joints of venison, to the  amount of at least two deer; but notwithstanding I was to pay for the  whole, I found that Mackachy and his wife got all the prime parts of the  meat; and on my mentioning it to them, there was so much clanship among  them, that they preferred making a present of it to Mackachy, to selling  it to me at double the price for which venison sells in those parts: a  sufficient proof of the singular advantage which a native of this  country has over an Englishman, when at such a distance from the  Company's Factories as to depend entirely on them for subsistence.    [Sidenote: 7th.]    {10} Thinking I had made my stay here long enough, I gave orders to  prepare for our departure; and as I had purchased plenty of meat for  present use while we were at this tent, so I likewise procured such a  supply to carry with us, as was likely to last us to the Fort.    [Sidenote: 8th.]    [Sidenote: 1769. December. 11th.]    Early in the morning we took a final leave of our host, and proceeded on  our journey homewards. One of the strangers accompanied us, for which at  first I could not see his motive; but soon after our arrival at the  Factory, I found that the purport of his visit was to be paid for the  meat, said to be given _gratis_ to Mackachy while we were at his tent.  The weather continued very fine, but extremely cold; and during this  part of my journey nothing material happened, till we arrived safe at  Prince of Wales's Fort on the eleventh of December, to my own great  mortification, and to the no small surprise of the Governor, who had  placed great confidence in the abilities and conduct of Chawchinahaw.

One of those Indians called Conne-e-quese, said he had been very  near to the famous river I was engaged to go in quest of.

On the 3d I wrote General Jackson,  in the Shenandoah Valley, proposing to join him with sufficient  reinforcements to strike the Federal force in front of him a sudden,  severe blow, and thus compel a change in the movements of McClellan's  army. I explained that the responsibility of the move could not be taken  unless I was with the detachment to give it vigor and action to meet my  views, or give time to get back behind the Rapidan in case the authorities  discovered the move and ordered its recall.    I had been left in command on the Rapidan, but was not authorized to  assume command of the Valley district. As the commander of the district  did not care to have an officer there of higher rank, the subject was  discontinued.    General Johnston, assigned to the Department of the Peninsula and  Norfolk, made an inspection of his new lines, and on his return  recommended that they should be abandoned. Meanwhile, his army had been  ordered to Richmond. He was invited to meet the President to discuss  military affairs, and asked General G. W. Smith and myself to go with him.  The Secretary of War and General R. E. Lee were with the President when we  met.    It was the first time that I had been called to such august presence, to  deliberate on momentous matters, so I had nothing to say till called on.  The views intended to be offered were prefaced by saying that I knew  General McClellan; that he was a military engineer, and would move his  army by careful measurement and preparation; that he would not be ready to  advance before the 1st of May. The President interrupted, and spoke of  McClellan's high attainments and capacity in a style indicating that he  did not care to hear any one talk who did not have the same appreciation  of our great adversary. McClellan had been a special favorite with Mr.  Davis when he was Secretary of War in the Pierce administration, and he  seemed to take such reflections upon his favorites as somewhat personal.  From the hasty interruption I concluded that my opinion had only been  asked through polite recognition of my presence, not that it was wanted,  and said no more. My intention was to suggest that we leave Magruder to  look after McClellan, and march, as proposed to Jackson a few days before,  through the Valley of Virginia, cross the Potomac, threaten Washington,  and call McClellan to his own capital.    At the time of McClellan's landing on the peninsula, the Confederate army  on that line was commanded by Major-General J. Bankhead Magruder, and  consisted of eleven thousand men of all arms. The defensive line was  pitched behind the Warwick River, a sluggish stream that rises about a  mile south of Yorktown, and flows south to its confluence with James  River. The Warwick was dammed at different points, thus flooding the  intervening low lands as far as Lee's Mills, where the river spreads into  marsh lands. The dams were defended by batteries and rifle-trenches. The  left rested at Yorktown, which was fortified by continuous earthworks,  strong water and land batteries, and rifle-trenches reaching to the right,  connecting with those behind the Warwick. Yorktown is on the right bank of  York River, which narrows at that point, with Gloucester Point on the  opposite bank. This point was also fortified, and held by a strong  garrison. On the south side of the James, General Huger held Norfolk, near  its mouth, fortified and garrisoned by about ten thousand men, while the  James River floated the Confederate vessels \"Virginia\" (\"Merrimac\"),  \"Yorktown,\" \"Jamestown,\" and \"Teaser.\"    McClellan's army, embarked from Alexandria and moved by transports to the  vicinity of Fortress Monroe, as first collected, numbered one hundred and  eight thousand of all arms, including the garrison at Fortress Monroe.    Magruder was speedily reinforced by a detachment from Huger's army, and  afterwards by Early's brigade of Johnston's army, and after a few days by  the balance of Johnston's army, the divisions of G. W. Smith, D. H. Hill,  and Longstreet, with Stuart's cavalry, General Johnston in command.    General McClellan advanced towards the Confederate line and made some  efforts at the dams, but it was generally understood that his plan was to  break the position by regular approaches. After allowing due time for the  completion of his battering arrangements, Johnston abandoned his line the  night of May 3 and marched back towards Richmond, ordering a corresponding  move by the troops at Norfolk; but the Confederate authorities interfered  in favor of Norfolk, giving that garrison time to withdraw its army  supplies. The divisions of G. W. Smith and D. H. Hill were ordered by the  Yorktown and Williamsburg road, Magruder's and Longstreet's by the Hampton  and Lee's Mill road, Stuart's cavalry to cover both routes.    Anticipating this move as the possible result of operations against his  lower line, General Magruder had constructed a series of earthworks about  two miles in front of Williamsburg. The main work, Fort Magruder, was a  bastion. On either side redoubts were thrown up reaching out towards the  James and York Rivers. The peninsula is about eight miles wide at that  point. College Creek on the right flows into James River, and Queen's  Creek on the left into the York, both giving some defensive strength,  except at mill-dams, which were passable by vehicles. The redoubts on the  left of Fort Magruder commanded the dam in Queen's Creek at Sanders's  Pond, but the dam in College Creek was beyond protection from the  redoubts.    The four redoubts on the right of Fort Magruder had commanding positions  of the fort.    Finding the entire line of intrenchments at Yorktown empty on the morning  of May 4, McClellan ordered pursuit by his cavalry under its chief,  General Stoneman, with four batteries of horse artillery, supported by  Hooker's division on the Yorktown road and W. F. Smith's on the Hampton  road.    They were followed on the Hampton road by General Heintzelman (Kearny's  division), Third Corps, and Couch's and Casey's divisions of Keyes's  (Fourth) Corps, Sumner's (Second) Corps on the Yorktown road. Nearing  Williamsburg, the roads converge and come together in range of field  batteries at Fort Magruder. About eight miles out from Yorktown, on the  Hampton road, Stuart, hearing of severe cavalry fight by the part of his  command on the Yorktown road, thought to ride across to the enemy's rear  and confuse his operations, but presently found a part of the enemy's  cavalry and a battery under General Emory marching in his rear by a  cross-road from the Yorktown road. He formed and charged in column of  fours, gaining temporary success, but fell upon the enemy's battery, and  found Benson prompt in getting into action, and in turn, with dismounted  troopers, drove him back, cutting his line of retreat and forcing him off  to the beach road along the James River. The march of Emory's cavalry  across to the Hampton road misled Hooker's division to the same march, and  that division, crowding the highway, caused Smith's division to diverge by  a cross-road, which led it over into the Yorktown road. These misleadings  delayed the advance on both roads. Emory followed Stuart until the latter  in turn came upon strong grounds, where pursuit became isolated and  hazardous.    The removal of the Confederate cavalry from the Hampton road left Hooker's  march free of molestation. But not advised of the opportunity, he took the  precautions usual on such occasions. His early approach, however, hurried  the movements of the Confederate cavalry on the Yorktown road, and let the  enemy in upon us on that road before we were advised of his approach.    General Johnston rode near the rear of his army to receive despatches from  his cavalry commander. General Stuart wrote and sent them, but his  couriers found the enemy's cavalry in the way and returned to him. The  cavalry fight on the Yorktown road was also damaging to the Confederates,  and not reported to the commanding general.    About four P.M., General Cook's cavalry and the horse artillery under  Gibson debouched from the woodlands on the Yorktown road and began to  examine the open ground in front of the Confederate field-works. General  Johnston, who was at the rear, hurried Semmes's brigade of McLaws's  division into the nearest redoubts, and ordered McLaws to call back  another brigade. Kershaw was ordered, and Manly's battery. The battery had  to go at a run to be sure of their cover in the redoubts. Another battery  was ordered by McLaws, who rode and took command. When Kershaw got to the  fort, part of his men were deployed in the wood beyond, to his left.    Meanwhile, the Federal cavalry was advancing, Gibson's horse artillery and  Manly's Confederate battery were in severe combat, the latter having the  benefit of gun-proof parapets. Observing the approach of cavalry near his  left, McLaws ordered two of Manly's guns into Fort Magruder, which, with  the assistance of Kershaw's infantry, drove off that column. Some cavalry,  riding near the left redoubt with little concern, were first taken for  Confederates, but the next moment were identified as Federals, when the  artillery was turned upon them, and, with the Confederate cavalry, pushed  them quite away. When the left redoubt, commanding the dam at Sanders's  Pond, was occupied by a part of Kershaw's men, McCarthy's battery came  into action, and, with the assistance of others, gave Gibson's battery, in  the open, serious trouble. McLaws ordered an advance of part of Semmes's  brigade, led by Colonel Cummings. This, with the severe artillery fire  from the redoubts and guns afield, cleared the open, leaving one of  Gibson's guns in the mud, which was secured by McCarthy's men as a trophy  of the day's work. Ten horses had been sent back to haul the piece off,  but the mud was too heavy for them."]]]
