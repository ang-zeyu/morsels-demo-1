At bottom this is the same thing,  since the second case only adds to the first the idea of  substitution, which may seem an idle subtlety; practically, the  consequences are surprising, and beneficial or fatal by turns.    Consequently, the distinction established in value is based on  facts, and is not at all arbitrary: it is for man, in submitting  to this law, to use it to increase his welfare and liberty.  Labor, as an author (M. Walras) has beautifully expressed it, is  a war declared against the parsimony of Nature; by it wealth and  society are simultaneously created.  Not only does labor produce  incomparably more wealth than Nature gives us,--for instance, it  has been remarked that the shoemakers alone in France produce  ten times more than the mines of Peru, Brazil, and Mexico  combined,--but, labor infinitely extending and multiplying its  rights by the changes which it makes in natural values, it  gradually comes about that all wealth, in running the gauntlet of  labor, falls wholly into the hands of him who creates it, and  that nothing, or almost nothing, is left for the possessor of the  original material.    Such, then, is the path of economic progress: at first,  appropriation of the land and natural values; then, association  and distribution through labor until complete equality is  attained.  Chasms are scattered along our road, the sword is  suspended over our heads; but, to avert all dangers, we have  reason, and reason is omnipotence.    It results from the relation of useful value to exchangeable  value that if, by accident or from malice, exchange should be  forbidden to a single producer, or if the utility of his product  should suddenly cease, though his storehouses were full, he would  possess nothing.  The more sacrifices he had made and the more  courage he had displayed in producing, the greater would be his  misery.  If the utility of the product, instead of wholly  disappearing, should only diminish,--a thing which may happen in  a hundred ways,--the laborer, instead of being struck down and  ruined by a sudden catastrophe, would be impoverished only;  obliged to give a large quantity of his own value for a small  quantity of the values of others, his means of subsistence would  be reduced by an amount equal to the deficit in his sale: which  would lead by degrees from competency to want.  If, finally, the  utility of the product should increase, or else if its production  should become less costly, the balance of exchange would turn to  the advantage of the producer, whose condition would thus be  raised from fatiguing mediocrity to idle opulence.  This  phenomenon of depreciation and enrichment is manifested under a  thousand forms and by a thousand combinations; it is the essence  of the passional and intriguing game of commerce and industry.  And this is the lottery, full of traps, which the economists  think ought to last forever, and whose suppression the Academy of  Moral and Political Sciences unwittingly demands, when, under the  names of profit and wages, it asks us to reconcile value in use  and value in exchange; that is, to find the method of rendering  all useful values equally exchangeable, and, vice versa, all  exchangeable values equally useful.    The economists have very clearly shown the double character of  value, but what they have not made equally plain is its  contradictory nature.  Here begins our criticism.    Utility is the necessary condition of exchange; but take away  exchange, and utility vanishes: these two things are indissolubly  connected.  Where, then, is the contradiction?    Since all of us live only by labor and exchange, and grow richer  as production and exchange increase, each of us produces as much  useful value as possible, in order to increase by that amount his  exchanges, and consequently his enjoyments.  Well, the first  effect, the inevitable effect, of the multiplication of values is  to LOWER them: the more abundant is an article of merchandise,  the more it loses in exchange and depreciates commercially.  Is  it not true that there is a contradiction between the necessity  of labor and its results?    I adjure the reader, before rushing ahead for the explanation, to  arrest his attention upon the fact.    A peasant who has harvested twenty sacks of wheat, which he with  his family proposes to consume, deems himself twice as rich  as if he had harvested only ten; likewise a housewife who has  spun fifty yards of linen believes that she is twice as rich as  if she had spun but twenty- five.  Relatively to the household,  both are right; looked at in their external relations, they may  be utterly mistaken.  If the crop of wheat is double throughout  the whole country, twenty sacks will sell for less than ten would  have sold for if it had been but half as great; so, under similar  circumstances, fifty yards of linen will be worth less than  twenty-five: so that value decreases as the production of utility  increases, and a producer may arrive at poverty by continually  enriching himself.  And this seems unalterable, inasmuch as there  is no way of escape except all the products of industry become  infinite in quantity, like air and light, which is absurd.  God  of my reason!  Jean Jacques would have said: it is not the  economists who are irrational; it is political economy itself  which is false to its definitions.  Mentita est iniquitas sibi.    In the preceding examples the useful value exceeds the  exchangeable value: in other cases it is less.  Then the same  phenomenon is produced, but in the opposite direction: the  balance is in favor of the producer, while the consumer suffers.  This is notably the case in seasons of scarcity, when the high  price of provisions is always more or less factitious.  There are  also professions whose whole art consists in giving to an article  of minor usefulness, which could easily be dispensed with, an  exaggerated value of opinion: such, in general, are the arts of  luxury.  Man, through his aesthetic passion, is eager for the  trifles the possession of which would highly satisfy his vanity,  his innate desire for luxury, and his more noble and more  respectable love of the beautiful: upon this the dealers in this  class of articles speculate.  To tax fancy and elegance is no  less odious or absurd than to tax circulation: but such a tax is  collected by a few fashionable merchants, whom general  infatuation protects, and whose whole merit generally consists in  warping taste and generating fickleness.  Hence no one complains;  and all the maledictions of opinion are reserved for the  monopolists who, through genius, succeed in raising by a few  cents the price of linen and bread.    It is little to have pointed out this astonishing contrast  between useful value and exchangeable value, which the economists  have been in the habit of regarding as very simple: it must be  shown that this pretended simplicity conceals a profound mystery,  which it is our duty to fathom.    I summon, therefore, every serious economist to tell me,  otherwise than by transforming or repeating the question, for  what reason value decreases in proportion as production augments,  and reciprocally what causes this same value to increase in  proportion as production diminishes.  In technical terms, useful  value and exchangeable value, necessary to each other, are  inversely proportional to each other; I ask, then, why scarcity,  instead of utility, is synonymous with dearness.  For--mark it  well--the price of merchandise is independent of the amount of  labor expended in production; and its greater or less cost does  not serve at all to explain the variations in its price.  Value  is capricious, like liberty: it considers neither utility nor  labor; on the contrary, it seems that, in the ordinary course of  affairs, and exceptional derangements aside, the most useful  objects are those which are sold at the lowest price; in other  words, that it is just that the men who perform the most  attractive labor should be the best rewarded, while those whose  tasks demand the most exertion are paid the least.  So that, in  following the principle to its ultimate consequences, we  reach the most logical of conclusions: that things whose use is  necessary and quantity infinite must be gratuitous, while those  which are without utility and extremely scarce must bear an  inestimable price.  But, to complete the embarrassment, these  extremes do not occur in practice: on the one hand, no human  product can ever become infinite in quantity; on the other, the  rarest things must be in some degree useful, else they would not  be susceptible of value.  Useful value and exchangeable value  remain, then, in inevitable attachment, although it is their  nature continually to tend towards mutual exclusion.    I shall not fatigue the reader with a refutation of the  logomachies which might be offered in explanation of this  subject: of the contradiction inherent in the idea of value there  is no assignable cause, no possible explanation.  The fact of  which I speak is one of those called primitive,--that is, one of  those which may serve to explain others, but which in themselves,  like the bodies called simple, are inexplicable.  Such is the  dualism of spirit and matter.  Spirit and matter are two terms  each of which, taken separately, indicates a special aspect of  spirit, but corresponds to no reality.  So, given man's needs of  a great variety of products together with the obligation of  procuring them by his labor, the opposition of useful value to  exchangeable value necessarily results; and from this opposition  a contradiction on the very threshold of political economy.  No  intelligence, no will, divine or human, can prevent it."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44414"],[0,"The Mormon Prophet and His Harem (#15)"],[1,"concealment or apology, before       the arrival of the American forces. The jury thus instructed,       though kept in session two weeks, utterly refused to do       anything, and were finally discharged, as an evidently useless       appendage of a court of justice. But the court was determined       to try a last resource, to bring to light and to punishment       those guilty of the atrocious crimes which confessedly had       been committed in the Territory, and the session continued.       Bench warrants, based upon sworn information, were issued       against the alleged criminals, and United States Marshal       Dotson, a most excellent and reliable officer, aided by a       military _posse_, procured on his own request, had succeeded       in making a few arrests. A general stampede immediately took       place among the Mormons, and what I wish to call your       attention to, as particularly noticeable, is the fact that       this occurred more especially among the church officials and       civil officers. . . .         \"Sitting as a committing magistrate, complaint after complaint       was made before me of murders and robberies. Among these I may       mention, as peculiarly and shockingly prominent, the murder of       Forbes, the assassination of the Parrishes and Potter, of       Jones and his mother, of the Aiken party, of which there were       six in all; and, worst and darkest in the appalling catalogue       of blood, the cowardly, cold-blooded butchery and robbery at       the Mountain Meadows. At that time there still lay, all       ghastly, under the sun of Utah, the unburied skeletons of one       hundred and nineteen men, women, and children, the hapless,       hopeless victims of the Mormon creed. . . .         \"The scene of this horrible massacre at the Mountain Meadows       is situate about three hundred and twenty miles west of south       from Great Salt Lake City, on the road leading to Los Angelos,       in California. I was the first federal Judge in that part of       the Territory after the occurrence,--my district extending       from a short distance below Salt Lake City to the south end of       the Territory. I determined to visit that part of my district,       and, if possible, expose the persons engaged in the massacre,       which I did in the early part of the year 1859. I accordingly       embraced an opportunity of accompanying a small detachment of       soldiers, who were being sent to that section by Gen.       Johnson,--having requested the Marshal of the Territory to       accompany, or to send a deputy. He accordingly sent deputy       William H. Rodgers, who went with me.         \"The command went as far south as the St. Clara, twenty miles       beyond the Mountain Meadows, where we camped, and remained       about a week. During our stay there I was visited by the       Indian chiefs of that section, who gave me their version of       the massacre. They admitted that a portion of their men were       engaged in the massacre, but were not there when the attack       commenced. One of them told me, in the presence of the others,       that after the attack had been made, a white man came to their       camp with a piece of paper, which, he said, _Brigham Young had       sent_, that directed them to go and help to whip the       emigrants. A portion of the band went, but did not assist in       the fight. He gave as a reason, that the emigrants had long       guns, and were good shots. He said that his brother [this       chief's name was Jackson] was shot while running across the       Meadow, at a distance of two hundred yards from the corral       where the emigrants were. He said the Mormons were all       painted. He said the Indians got a part of the clothing; and       gave the names of John D. Lee, President Haight, and Bishop       Higbee, as the big captains. It might be proper here to remark       that the Indians in the southern part of the Territory of Utah       are not numerous, and are a very low, cowardly, beastly set,       very few of them being armed with guns. They are not       formidable. I believe all in the southern part of the       Territory would, under no circumstances, carry on a fight       against ten white men.         \"From our camp on the St. Clara we again went back to the       Mountain Meadows, camping near where the massacre had       occurred. The Meadow is about five miles in length and one in       width, running to quite a narrow point at the southwest end,       being higher at the middle than either end. It is the divide       between the waters that flow into the Great Basin and those       emptying into the Colorado River. A very large spring rises in       the south end of the narrow part. It was on the north side of       this spring the emigrants were camped. The bank rises from the       spring eight or ten feet, then extends off to the north about       two hundred yards, on a level. A range of hills is there       reached, rising perhaps fifty or sixty feet. Back of this       range is quite a valley, which extends down until it has an       outlet, three or four hundred yards below the spring, into the       main meadow.         \"The first attack was made by going down this ravine, then       following up the bed of the spring to near it, then at       daylight firing upon the men who were about the       camp-fires,--in which attack ten or twelve of the emigrants       were killed or wounded; the stock of the emigrants having       been previously driven behind the hill, and up the ravine.         \"The emigrants soon got in condition to repel the attack,       shoved their wagons together, sunk the wheels in the earth,       and threw up quite an intrenchment. The fighting after       continued as a siege; the assailants occupying the hill, and       firing at any of the emigrants that exposed themselves, having       a barricade of stones along the crest of the hill as a       protection. The siege was continued for five days, the       besiegers appearing in the garb of Indians. The Mormons,       seeing that they could not capture the train without making       some sacrifice of life on their part, and getting weary of the       fight, resolved to accomplish by strategy what they were not       able to do by force. The fight had been going on for five       days, and no aid was received from any quarter, although the       family of Jacob Hamlin, the Indian agent, were living in the       upper end of the Meadow, and within hearing of the reports of       the guns.         \"Who can imagine the feelings of these men, women, and       children, surrounded, as they supposed themselves to be, by       savages? Fathers and mothers only can judge what they must       have been. Far off, in the Rocky Mountains, without       transportation,--for their cattle, horses and mules had been       run off,--not knowing what their fate was to be,--we can but       poorly realize, the gloom that pervaded the camp.         \"A wagon is descried, far up the Meadows. Upon its nearer       approach, it is observed to contain armed men. See! now they       raise a white flag! All is joy in the corral. A general shout       is raised, and in an instant, a little girl, dressed in white,       is placed at an opening between two of the wagons, as a       response to the signal. The wagon approaches; the occupants       are welcomed into the corral, the emigrants little suspecting       that they were entertaining the fiends that had been besieging       them.         \"This wagon contained President Haight and Bishop John D. Lee,       among others of the Mormon Church. They professed to be on       good terms with the Indians, and represented the Indians as       being very mad. They also proposed to intercede, and settle       the matter with the Indians. After several hours of parley,       they, having apparently visited the Indians, gave the       ultimatum of the Indians; which was, that the emigrants should       march out of their camp, leaving everything behind them, even       their guns. It was promised by the Mormon bishops that they       would bring a force, and guard the emigrants back to the       settlements.         \"The terms were agreed to,--the emigrants being desirous of       saving the lives of their families. The Mormons retired, and       subsequently appeared at the corral with thirty or forty armed       men. The emigrants were marched out, the women and children in       front, and the men behind, the Mormon guard being in the rear.       When they had marched in this way about a mile, at a given       signal, the slaughter commenced. The men were most all shot       down at the first fire from the guard. Two only escaped, who       fled to the desert, and were followed 150 miles before they       were overtaken and slaughtered.         \"The women and children ran on, two or three hundred yards       further, when they were overtaken, and with the aid of the       Indians they were slaughtered. Seventeen only of the small       children were saved, the eldest being only seven years. Thus,       on the 10th day of September, 1857, was consummated one of the       most cruel, cowardly, and bloody murders known in our history.       Upon the way from the Meadows, a young Indian pointed out to       me the place where the Mormons painted and disguised       themselves.         \"I went from the Meadows to Cedar City; the distance is       thirty-five or forty miles. I contemplated holding an       examining court there, should Gen. Johnson furnish me       protection, and also protect witnesses, and furnish the       Marshal a _posse_ to aid in making arrests. While there I       issued warrants, on affidavits filed before me, for the arrest       of the following named persons:--         \"Jacob Haight, President of the Cedar City Stake; Bishop John       M.
