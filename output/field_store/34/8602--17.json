[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36764"],[0,"In the Track of the Bookworm (#15)"],[1,"o'er my books,      So vainly seeking a receding rest,    I read the wonder in her steadfast looks:      \"Is this my son who lay upon my breast?\"      And when for me there is an end of time,      And this unsatisfying work is done,    If I shall meet thee in thy peaceful clime,      Young mother, wilt thou know thy gray-haired son?    There is one other work of art which adorns my library--a medallion by a  dear friend of mine, an eminent sculptor, the story of which I will put  into his mouth. He calls the face      MY SCHOOLMATE.      The snows have settled on my head      But not upon my heart,    And incidents of years long fled      From out my memory start.    My hand is cunning to contrive      The shapes my brain invents,    And keep in marble forms alive      That which my soul contents;    And I have wife, and children tall,      Grandchildren cluster near,    And sweet the applause of men doth fall      On my undeafened ear.    But still my mind will backward turn      For half a century,    And without reasoning will yearn      For sight or news of thee,    Thou playmate of my boyhood days,      When life was all aglow,    When the sweetest thing was thy girlish praise,      As I drew thee o'er the snow    To the old red school-house by the road,      Where we learned to spell and read,    When thou wert all my fairy load      And I was thy prancing steed.      Oh! thou wert simple then and fair.      Artless and unconstrained,    With quaintly knotted auburn hair      From which the wind refrained,    And from thine earnest steady eyes      Shone out a nature pure,    Formed by kind Heaven, a man's best prize,      To love and to endure.      Oh! art thou still in life and time,      Or hast thou gone before?    And hath thy lot been like to mine,      Or pinched and bare and sore?    And didst thou marry, or art thou      Still of the spinster tribe?    Perchance thou art a widow now,      Steeled against second bribe?    Do grandsons round thy hearthstone play,      Or dost thou end thy race?    And could that auburn hair grow gray,      And wrinkles line thy face?    I cannot make thee old and plain--      I would not if I could--    And I recall thee without stain,      Simply and sweetly good;    And I have carved thy pretty head      And hung it on my wall,    And to all men let it be said,      I like it best of all;    For on a far-off snowy road,      Before I had learned to read,    Thou wert all my fairy load      And I was thy prancing steed!    I have reserved my queerest library companion till the last. It is not a  book, although it is good for nothing but to read. It is not an autograph,  although it is simply the name of an individual. It is my office sign  which I have cherished, as a memento of busier days. Some singular  reflections are roused when I gaze at      MY SHINGLE.      My shingle is battered and old,      No longer deciphered with ease,    So I've taken it in from the cold,      And fastened it up on a frieze.      A long generation ago,      With feelings of singular pride    I regarded its glittering show,      And pointed it out to my bride.      Companions of youth have grown few,      Its loves and aversions are faint;    No spirit to make friends anew--      An old enemy seems like a saint.      My clients have paid the last fee      For passage in Charon's sad boat,    Imposing no duty on me      Save to utter this querelous note;      And still as I toil in life's mills,      In loneliness growing profound,    To attend on the proof of their wills      And swear that their wits were quite sound!      So I work with the scissors and pen,      And to show of old courage a spark,    I must utter a jest now and then,      Like whistling of boys in the dark.      I tack my old friend on the wall,      So that infantile grandson of mine    May not think, if my life he recall,      That I died without making a sign.      When at court on the great judgment day      With penitent suitors I mingle,    May my guilt be washed cleanly away,      Like that on my faded old shingle!    Of course my chief occupation in my library is reading and writing. To be  sure, I do a good deal of thinking there. But there is another occupation  which I practice to a great extent, which does not involve reading or  writing at all, nor thinking to any considerable degree. That is playing  solitaire. I play only one kind of this and that I have played for many  years. It requires two packs of cards, and requires building on the aces  and kings, and so I have them tacked down on a lap-board to save picking  out and laying down every time. This particular game is called \"St.  Elba,\" probably because Napoleon did not play it, and it can be \"won\" once  in about sixty trials. I do not care for card-playing with others, but I  have certain reasons for liking      SOLITAIRE.      I like to play cards with a man of sense,      And allow him to play with me,    And so it has grown a delight intense      To play solitaire on my knee.      I love the quaint form of the sceptered king,      The simplicity of the ace,    The stolid knave like a wooden thing,      And her majesty's smirking face.      Diamonds, aces, and clubs and spades--      Their garb of respectable black    A moiety brilliant of red invades,      As they mingle in motley pack.      Independent of anyone's signal or leave,      Relieved from the bluffing of poker,    I've no apprehension of ace up a sleeve,      And fear no superfluous joker.      I build up and down; all the cards I hold,      And the game is always fair,    For I am honest, and so is my old      Companion at solitaire.      Let kings condescend to the lower grades,      Queens glitter with diamonds rare,    Knaves flourish their clubs, and peasants wield spades,      But give me my solitaire.          XIX.    THE FRIENDSHIP OF BOOKS.      To many peaceful men of the legal robe the companionship of books is  inexpressibly dear. What a privilege it is to summon the greatest and most  charming spirits of the past from their graves, and find them always  willing to talk to us! How delightful to go to our well-known  book-shelves, lay hands on our favorite authors--even in the dark, so well  do we know them--take any volume, open it at any page, and in a few  minutes lose all sense and remembrance of the real world, with its strife,  its bitterness, its disappointments, its hollowness, its unfaithfulness,  its selfishness, in the pictures of an ideal world! The real world, do we  say? Which is the real world, that of history or that of fiction? In this  age of historic doubt and iconoclasm, are not the heroes of our favorite  romances much more real than those of history? Captain Ed'ard Cuttle,  mariner, is much more real to us than Captain Joseph Cook; Cooper's Two  Admirals than the great Nelson; Leather-Stocking than the yellow-haired  Custer; Henry Esmond than any of the Pretenders; Hester Prynne and Becky  Sharp than Catherine of Russia or Aspasia or Lucrezia; Sidney Carton than  Philip Sidney. Even the kings and heroes who have lived in history live  more vividly for us in romance. We know the crooked Richard and the  crafty Louis XI. most familiarly, if not most accurately, through  Shakespeare and Scott; and where in history do we get so haunting a  picture of the great Napoleon and Waterloo as in Victor Hugo's wondrous  but inaccurate chapter? Happy is the man who has for his associates David,  Solomon, Job, Paul, and John, in spite of the assaults of modern criticism  upon the Scriptures! No one can shake our faith in Don Quixote, although  the accounts of the Knight \"without fear and without reproach\" are so  short and vague. There is no doubt about the travels of Christian,  although those of Stanley may be questioned. The Vicar of Wakefield is a  much more actual personage than Peter who preached the Crusades. Sir Roger  de Coverley and his squire life are much more probable to us than Sir  William Temple in his gardens. There is no character in romance who has  not or might not have lived, but we are thrown into grave doubts of the  saintly Washington and the devilish Napoleon depicted three quarters of a  century ago. We cast history aside in scepticism and disgust; we cling to  romance with faith and delight. \"The things that are seen are temporal;  the things that are not seen are eternal.\" So let the writer hereof sing a  song in praise of      MY FRIENDS THE BOOKS.      Friends of my youth and of my age      Within my chamber wait,    Until I fondly turn the page      And prove them wise and great.      At me they do not rudely glare      With eye that luster lacks,    But knowing how I hate a stare,      Politely turn their backs.      They never split my head with din,      Nor snuffle through their noses,    Nor admiration seek to win      By inartistic poses.      If I should chance to fall asleep,      They do not scowl or snap,    But prudently their counsel keep      Till I have had my nap.      And if I choose to rout them out      Unseasonably at night,    They do not chafe nor curse nor pout,      But rise all clothed and bright.      They ne'er intrude with silly say,      They never scold nor worry;    They ne'er suspect and ne'er betray,      They're never in a hurry.      Anacreon never gets quite full,      Nor Horace too flirtatious;    Swift makes due fun of Johnny Bull,      And Addison is gracious.      Saint-Simon and Grammont rehearse      Their tales of court with glee;    For all their scandal I'm no worse,--      They never peach on me.      For what I owe Montaigne, no dread      To meet him on the morrow;    And better still, it must be said,      He never wants to borrow.      Paul never asks, though sure to preach,      Why I don't come to church;    Though Dr. Johnson strives to teach,      I do not fear his birch.      My Dickens never is away      Whene'er I choose to call;    I need not wait for Thackeray      "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36844"],[0,"In New England Fields and Woods (#15)"],[1," till, alarmed by some keener sense  than is given us, up rise wood duck, dusky duck, and teal from their  reedy cover. Then the ready gun belches its thunder, and suddenly  consternation pervades the marshes. All the world has burst forth in a  burning of powder. From end to end, from border to border, the fenny  expanse roars with discharge and echo, and nowhere within it is there  peace or rest for the sole of a webbed foot. Even the poor bittern and  heron, harmless and worthless, flap to and fro from one to another now  unsafe retreat, in constant danger of death from every booby gunner who  can cover their slow flight.    The upland woods, too, are awakened from the slumber of their late  summer days. How silent they had grown when their songsters had  departed, rarely stirred but by the woodpecker's busy hammer, the  chatter and bark of squirrels, and the crows making vociferous  proclamation against some winged or furred enemy. The grouse have waxed  fat among the border patches of berry bushes, rarely disturbed in the  seclusion of the thickets but by the soft footfall of the fox, the  fleeting shadow of a cruising hawk, and the halloo of the cowboy driving  home his herd from the hillside pasture. Now come enemies more  relentless than beast or bird of prey, a sound more alarming than the  cowboy's distant call--man and his companion the dog, and the terrible  thunder of the gun. A new terror is revealed to the young birds, a  half-forgotten one brought afresh to the old. The crows have found fresh  cause for clamor, and the squirrels lapse into a silence of fear.    Peace and the quietness of peace have departed from the realm of the  woods, and henceforth while the green leaves grow bright as blossoms  with the touch of frost, then brown and sere, and till long after they  lie under the white shroud of winter, its wild denizens shall abide in  constant fear and unrest.    So fares it with the wood-folk, these days of September, wherein the  sportsman rejoiceth with exceeding gladness.          XXXI    A PLEA FOR THE UNPROTECTED      Why kill, for the mere sake of killing or the exhibition of one's skill,  any wild thing that when alive harms no one and when killed is of no  worth? The more happy wild life there is in the world, the pleasanter it  is for all of us.    When one is duck-shooting on inland waters, sitting alert in the bow of  the skiff with his gun ready for the expected gaudy wood duck, or plump  mallard, or loud quacking dusky duck, or swift-winged teal, to rise with  a splashing flutter out of the wild rice, and there is a sudden beating  of broad wings among the sedges with a startled guttural quack, and  one's heart leaps to his throat and his gun to his shoulder, and  then--only an awkward bittern climbs the September breeze with a slow  incline, there is a vengeful temptation to let drive at the  disappointing good-for-nothing. But why not let the poor fellow go? If  you dropped him back into the marsh to rot unprofitably there, disdained  even by the mink, unattainable to the scavenger skunk, what good would  it do you? If he disappointed you, you disturbed him in his meditations,  or in the pursuit of a poor but honest living. Perhaps a great heron too  intent on his fishing or frogging, or dozing in the fancied seclusion of  his reedy bower, springs up within short range and goes lagging away on  his broad vans. He may be taken home to show, for he is worth showing  even when killed. But if you wish your friends to see him at his best,  bring them to him and let them see how well he befits these sedgy  levels--a goodly sight, whether he makes his lazy flight above them or  stands a motionless sentinel in the oozy shallows. The marshes would be  desolate without him, or if one desires the charm of loneliness, his  silent presence adds to it.    A kingfisher comes clattering along the channel. As he jerks his swift  way over the sluggish water he may test your marksmanship, but as he  hangs with rapid wing-beats over a school of minnows, as steadfast for  a minute as a star forever, needing no skill to launch him to his final  unrewarded plunge, do not kill him! In such waters he takes no fish that  you would, and he enlivens the scene more than almost any other  frequenter of it, never skulking and hiding, but with metallic,  vociferous clatter heralding his coming. One never tires of watching his  still mid-air poise, the same in calm or wind, and his unerring headlong  plunge.    When one wanders along a willowy stream with his gun, cautiously  approaching every lily-padded pool and shadowed bend likely to harbor  wood duck or teal, and finds neither, and his ears begin to ache for the  sound of his gun--if a green heron flaps off a branch before him he is  sorely tempted to shoot the ungainly bird, but if the gun must be heard,  let it speak to a stump or a tossed chip, either as difficult a target  as he, and let the poor harmless little heron live. Uncouth as he is, he  comes in well in the picture of such a watercourse, which has done with  the worry of turning mills, left far behind with their noise and bustle  on foaming rapids among the hills, and crawls now in lazy ease through  wide intervales, under elms and water maples and thickets of willows.    On the uplands, where the meadow lark starts out of the grass with a  sharp, defiant \"zeet!\" and speeds away on his steady game-like flight,  remember before you stop it, or try to, of how little account he is when  brought to bag; and how when the weary days of winter had passed, his  cheery voice welcomed the coming spring, a little later than the  robin's, a little earlier than the flicker's cackle; and what an  enlivening dot of color his yellow breast made where he strutted in the  dun, bare meadows.    In some States the woodpeckers are unprotected and are a mark for every  gunner. Their galloping flight tempts the ambitious young shooter to try  his skill, but they are among the best friends of the arboriculturist  and the fruit-grower, for though some of them steal cherries and peck  early apples, and one species sucks the sap of trees, they are the only  birds that search out and kill the insidious, destructive borer.    In some States, too, the hare is unprotected by any law, and it is  common custom to hunt it, even so late as April, for the mere sake of  killing, apparently; or perhaps the charm of the hound's music, which  makes the butchery of Adirondack deer so delightful a sport to some,  adds a zest to the slaughter of these innocents--though, be it said,  there is no comparison in the marksmanship required. Alive, the northern  hare is one of the most harmless of animals; dead, he is, in the opinion  of most people, one of the most worthless; so worthless that hunters  frequently leave the result of all their day's \"sport\" in the woods  where they were killed. Yet the hare is legitimate game, and should be  hunted as such, and only in proper seasons, and not be ruthlessly  exterminated. A woodland stroll is the pleasanter if one sees a hare  there in his brown summer suit, or white as the snow about him in his  winter furs.    Where there are no statute laws for the protection of game and harmless  creatures not so classed, an unwritten law of common sense, common  decency, and common humanity should be powerful enough to protect all  these. The fox is an outlaw; it is every one's legal right to kill him  whenever and however he may, and yet wherever the fox is hunted with any  semblance of fair play, whether in New England with gun and hound, or  elsewhere with horse and hound, the man who traps a fox, or kills one  unseasonably, or destroys a vixen and her cubs, bears an evil  reputation. A sentiment as popular and as potent ought to prevail to  protect those that, though harmless, are as unshielded by legislative  enactments as the fox, and much less guarded by natural laws and inborn  cunning.          XXXII    THE SKUNK      Always and everywhere in evil repute and bad odor, hunted, trapped, and  killed, a pest and a fur-bearer, it is a wonder that the skunk is not  exterminated, and that he is not even uncommon.    With an eye to the main chance, the fur-trapper spares him when fur is  not prime, but when the letter \"R\" has become well established in the  months the cruel trap gapes for him at his outgoing and incoming, at the  door of every discovered burrow, while all the year round the farmer,  sportsman, and poultry-grower wage truceless war against him.    Notwithstanding this general outlawry, when you go forth of a winter  morning, after a night of thaw or tempered chill, you see his authentic  signature on the snow, the unmistakable diagonal row of four footprints  each, or short-spaced alternate tracks, where he has sallied out for a  change from the subterranean darkness of his burrow, or from his as  rayless borrowed quarters beneath the barn, to the starlight or pale  gloom of midnight winter landscape.    More often are you made aware of his continued survival by another sense  than sight, when his far-reaching odor comes down the vernal breeze or  waft of summer air, rankly overbearing all the fragrance of springing  verdure, or perfume of flowers and new-mown hay, and you well know who  has somewhere and somehow been forced to take most offensively the  defensive.    It may be said of him that his actions speak louder than his words. Yet  the voiceless creature sometimes makes known his presence by sound, and  frightens the belated farm boy, whom he curiously follows with a  mysterious, hollow beating of his feet upon the ground.    Patches of neatly inverted turf in a grub-infested pasture tell those  who know his ways that the skunk has been doing the farmer good service  here, and making amends for poultry stealing, and you are inclined to  regard him with more favor. But when you come upon the empty shells of a  raided partridge nest, your sportsman's wrath is enkindled"]]]
