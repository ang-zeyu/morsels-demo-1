When Pizarro and his companions  disembarked in Peru, the great Inca, Huayna Capac, had but recently  completed the empire by the conquest of the kingdom of Quito.    It has been asked, which was the more marvellous feat, the conquest of  Mexico by Fernando Cortes, or that of Peru by Pizarro. One consideration  weighs heavily in favour of Cortes. It is that he was the first. When  Francisco Pizarro threw himself with his handful of adventurers upon  Peru in 1531, he had before him the example of his brilliant precursor,  to teach him how a few Europeans might impose by sheer audacity on the  amazed and superstitious peoples; and in many respects he simply copied  his model. Like him, he took advantage of the divisions and rivalries  of the natives; like him, he found means of securing the person of the  sovereign, and was thereby enabled to quell the subjects. On the other  hand, he had even fewer followers than Cortes. His company scarcely  numbered over two hundred men at first, and the Peruvian empire was more  compact and more wisely organized than that of Mexico. We shall  presently see the principal cause to which his incredible success must  be ascribed; but the net result seems to be, that one hesitates to  pronounce the feats of either adventurer more astounding than those of  the other, especially when we remember that Pizarro was without the  political genius of Fernando Cortes, and was so profoundly ignorant that  he could not so much as read!    The family of the Incas, whose scourge Pizarro proved to be, must have  numbered many fine politicians in its ranks. Never has what is called a  \"dynastic policy\" been pursued more methodically and ably. The proofs  assail us at every moment. The Incas were a family of priest-kings, who  reigned, as children of the Sun, over the Peruvian land, and the Sun  himself was the great deity of the country. To obey the Incas was to  obey the supreme god. Their person was the object of a veritable cultus,  and they had succeeded so completely in identifying the interests of  their own family with those of religion, of politics and of  civilization, that it was no longer possible to distinguish them one  from another. And yet it was this very method, so essentially  theocratic, of insisting on the minute regulation of all the actions of  human life in the name of religion, which finally ruined the Incas.  Peru, in the sixteenth century, had become one enormous convent, in  which everything was mechanically regulated, in which no one could take  the smallest initiative, in which everything depended absolutely upon  the will of the reigning Inca; so that the moment Pizarro succeeded in  laying hold of this Inca, this \"father Abbe,\" everything collapsed in a  moment, and nothing was left of the edifice constructed with such  sagacity but a heap of sand. And indeed this is the fatal result of  every theocracy, for it can never really be anything but a _hierocracy_  or rule of priests. On the one hand it must be absolute, for the  sovereign priest rules in the name of God; and on the other hand it is  fatally impelled to concern itself with every minutest affair, to  interfere vexatiously in all private concerns (since they too affect  religious ethics and discipline), and to multiply regulations against  every possible breach of the ruling religion. It is a general lesson of  religious history that is illustrated so forcibly by the fate of the  Inca priest-kings.    I will not weary you in this case, any more than in that of Mexico, with  the enumeration of the authors to whom we must go for information on the  political and religious history of the strange country with which we are  dealing. I must, however, say a few words concerning a certain writer  who long enjoyed the highest of reputations, and was regarded throughout  the last century as the most trustworthy and complete authority in  Peruvian matters. The Peruvians, far as their civilization had advanced  in many respects, were behind even the Mexicans in the art of preserving  the memory of the past; for they had not so much as the imperfect  hieroglyphics known to the latter. They made use of _Quipus_ or  _Quipos_, indeed, which were fringes, the threads of which were  variously knotted according to what they were intended to represent; but  unfortunately the Peruvians anticipated on a large scale what so often  happens on the small scale amongst ourselves to those persons of  uncertain memory who tie knots on their handkerchiefs to remind them of  something important. They find the knot, indeed, but have forgotten what  it means! And so with the Peruvians. They were not always at one as to  the meaning of their ancient Quipos, and there were several ways of  interpreting them. Moreover, after the conquest, the few Peruvians who  might still have made some pretension to a knowledge of them did not  trouble themselves to initiate the Europeans into their filiform  writing. All that is left of it is the practice of the Peruvian women  who preserve this method of registering the sins they intend to record  against themselves in the confessional.[39] Let us hope that they at  least never experience any analogous infirmity to that which besets the  knot-tiers amongst ourselves.[40]    To return to the Peruvian author of whom I intended to speak. He is the  celebrated Garcilasso de la Vega, who published his _Commentarios  reales_ in 1609 and 1617.[41] Garcilasso's father was a European, but  his mother was a Peruvian, and, what is more, a _Palla_, that is to say,  a princess of the family of the Incas. Born in 1540, this Garcilasso had  received from his mother and a maternal uncle a great amount of  information as to the family, the history and the persons of the ancient  sovereigns. He was extremely proud of his origin; so much so, indeed,  that he issued his works under the name of \"Garcilasso _el Inca_ de la  Vega,\" though he had no real title to the name of Inca, which could not  be transmitted by women. A genuine fervour breathes through his accounts  of the history of his Peruvian country and his glorious ancestors, and  it is to him that we owe the knowledge of many facts that would  otherwise have been lost. The interest of his narrative explains the  reputation so long enjoyed by his work, but the more critical spirit of  recent times has discovered that his filial zeal has betrayed him into  lavish embellishments of the situation created by the clever and  cautious policy of his forebears, the Incas. He has passed in silence  over many of their faults, and has attributed more than one merit to  them to which they have no just claim. But in spite of all this, when we  have made allowance for his family weakness, we may consult him with  great advantage as to the institutions and sovereigns of ancient Peru.    We must allow, with Garcilasso, that from the year 1000 A.D. onwards  (for he places the origin of their power at about this date) the Incas  had accomplished a work that may well seem marvellous in many respects.  Had there been any relations between Peru and Central America? Can we  explain the Peruvian civilization as the result of an emigration from  the isthmic region, or an imitation of what had already been realized  there? There is not the smallest trace of any such thing. No doubt it  would be difficult to justify a categorical assertion on a subject so  obscure; but it is certain that when they were discovered, Peru and the  kingdom of Quito were separated from North America by immense regions  plunged in the deepest savagery. Beginning at the Isthmus of Panama,  this savage district stretched over the whole northern portion of South  America, broken only by the demi-civilization of the Muyscas or Chibchas  (New Granada); and the Peruvians knew nothing of the Mexicans. Neither  the one nor the other were navigators, and nothing in the Peruvian  traditions betrays the least connection with Central America. The most  probable supposition is, that an indigenous civilization was  spontaneously developed in Peru by causes analogous to those which had  produced a similar phenomenon in the Maya country. In Peru, as in  Central America, the richness of the soil, the variety of its products,  the abundance of vegetable food, especially maize, secured the first  conditions of civilization. The Peruvian advance was further favoured by  the fact that it was protected towards the East by almost impassable  mountains, and towards the West by the sea, while to the North and South  it might concentrate its defensive forces upon comparatively narrow  spaces.    The whole territory of the empire was divided into three parts. The  first was the property of the Sun, that is to say of the priests who  officiated in his numerous temples; the second belonged to the reigning  Inca; and the third to the people. The people's land was divided out  every year in lots apportioned to the needs of each family, but the  portions assigned to the _Curacas_, or nobles, were of a magnitude  suited to their superior dignity. Taxes were paid in days of labour  devoted to the lands of the Inca and those of the Sun, or in  manufactured articles of various kinds, for the cities contained a  number of artizans. Indeed, it was one of the maxims of the Incas that  no part of the empire, however poor, should be exempt from paying  tribute of one kind or another. To such a length was this carried, that  so grave a historian as Herrera tells us how the Inca Huayna Capac,  wishing to determine what kind of tribute the inhabitants of Pasto were  to pay, and being assured that they were so entirely without resources  or capacity of any kind that they could give him nothing at all, laid on  them the annual tribute of a certain measure "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34834"],[0,"A Text-Book of Astronomy (#15)"],[1," temperature and then back again to a minimum,  repeating substantially the same variation day after day. But it must be  understood that minor causes not taken into account above, such as  winds, water, etc., produce other fluctuations from day to day which  sometimes obscure or even obliterate the diurnal variation of  temperature caused by the sun.    Expose the back of your hand to the sun, holding the hand in such a  position that the sunlight strikes perpendicularly upon it; then turn  the hand so that the light falls quite obliquely upon it and note how  much more vigorous is the warming effect of the sun in the first  position than in the second. It is chiefly this difference of angle that  makes the sun's warmth more effective when he is high up in the sky than  when he is near the horizon, and more effective in summer than in  winter.    We have seen in Chapter III that the sun's motion among the stars takes  place along a path which carries it alternately north and south of the  equator to a distance of 23.5°, and the stars show by their earlier  risings and later settings, as we pass from the equator toward the north  pole of the heavens, that as the sun moves northward from the equator,  each day in the northern hemisphere will become a little longer, each  night a little shorter, and every day the sun will rise higher toward  the zenith until this process culminates toward the end of June, when  the sun begins to move southward, bringing shorter days and smaller  altitudes until the Christmas season, when again it is reversed and the  sun moves northward. We have here another periodic variation, which runs  its complete course in a period of a year, and it is easy to see that  this variation must have a marked effect on the warming of the earth,  the long days and great altitudes of summer producing the greater warmth  of that season, while the shorter days and lower altitudes of December,  by diminishing the daily supply of solar heat, bring on the winter's  cold. The succession of the seasons, winter following summer and summer  winter, is caused by the varying altitude of the sun, and this in turn  is due to the obliquity of the ecliptic, or, what is the same thing, the  amount by which the axis of the earth is tipped from being perpendicular  to the plane of its orbit, and the seasons are simply a periodic change  in the warming of the earth, quite comparable with the diurnal change  but of longer period.    It is evident that the period within which the succession of winter and  summer is completed, the year, as we commonly call it, must equal the  time required by the sun to go from the vernal equinox around to the  vernal equinox again, since this furnishes a complete cycle of the sun's  motions north and south from the equator. On account of the westward  motion of the equinox (precession) this is not quite the same as the  time required for a complete revolution of the earth in its orbit, but  is a little shorter (20m. 23s.), since the equinox moves back to meet  the sun.    48. RELATION OF THE SUN TO CLIMATE.--It is clear that both the northern  and southern hemispheres of the earth must have substantially the same  kind of seasons, since the motion of the sun north and south affects  both alike; but when the sun is north of the equator and warming our  hemisphere most effectively, his light falls more obliquely upon the  other hemisphere, the days there are short and winter reigns at the  time we are enjoying summer, while six months later the conditions are  reversed.    In those parts of the earth near the equator--the torrid zone--there is  no such marked change from cold to warm as we experience, because, as  the sun never gets more than 23.5° away from the celestial equator, on  every day of the year he mounts high in the tropic skies, always coming  within 23.5° of the zenith, and usually closer than this, so that there  is no such periodic change in the heat supply as is experienced in  higher latitudes, and within the tropics the temperature is therefore  both higher and more uniform than in our latitude.    In the frigid zones, on the contrary, the sun never rises high in the  sky; at the poles his greatest altitude is only 23.5°, and during the  winter season he does not rise at all, so that the temperature is here  low the whole year round, and during the winter season, when for weeks  or months at a time the supply of solar light is entirely cut off, the  temperature falls to a degree unknown in more favored climes.    If the obliquity of the ecliptic were made 10° greater, what would be  the effect upon the seasons in the temperate zones? What if it were made  10° less?    Does the precession of the equinoxes have any effect upon the seasons or  upon the climate of different parts of the earth?    If the axis of the earth pointed toward Arcturus instead of Polaris,  would the seasons be any different from what they are now?    49. THE ATMOSPHERE.--Although we live upon its surface, we are not  outside the earth, but at the bottom of a sea of air which forms the  earth's outermost layer and extends above our heads to a height of many  miles. The study of most of the phenomena of the atmosphere belongs to  that branch of physics called meteorology, but there are a few matters  which fairly come within our consideration of the earth as a planet. We  can not see the stars save as we look through this atmosphere, and the  light which comes through it is bent and oftentimes distorted so as to  present serious obstacles to any accurate telescopic study of the  heavenly bodies. Frequently this disturbance is visible to the naked  eye, and the stars are said to twinkle--i. e., to quiver and change  color many times per second, solely in consequence of a disturbed  condition of the air and not from anything which goes on in the star.  This effect is more marked low down in the sky than near the zenith, and  it is worth noting that the planets show very little of it because the  light they send to the earth comes from a disk of sensible area, while a  star, being much smaller and farther from the earth, has its disk  reduced practically to a mere point whose light is more easily affected  by local disturbances in the atmosphere than is the broader beam which  comes from the planets' disk.    50. REFRACTION.--At all times, whether the stars twinkle or not, their  light is bent in its passage through the atmosphere, so that the stars  appear to stand higher up in the sky than their true positions. This  effect, which the astronomer calls refraction, must be allowed for in  observations of the more precise class, although save at low altitudes  its amount is a very small fraction of a degree, but near the horizon it  is much exaggerated in amount and becomes easily visible to the naked  eye by distorting the disks of the sun and moon from circles into ovals  with their long diameters horizontal. The refraction lifts both upper  and lower edge of the sun, but lifts the lower edge more than the upper,  thus shortening the vertical diameter. See Fig. 27, which shows not only  this effect, but also the reflection of the sun from the curved surface  of the sea, still further flattening the image. If the surface of the  water were flat, the reflected image would have the same shape as the  sun's disk, and its altered appearance is sometimes cited as a proof  that the earth's surface is curved.    The total amount of the refraction at the horizon is a little more than  half a degree, and since the diameters of the sun and moon subtend an  angle of about half a degree, we have the remarkable result that in  reality the whole disk of either sun or moon is below the horizon at the  instant that the lower edge appears to touch the horizon and sunset or  moonset begins. The same effect exists at sunrise, and as a consequence  the duration of sunshine or of moonshine is on the average about six  minutes longer each day than it would be if there were no atmosphere and  no refraction. A partial offset to this benefit is found in the fact  that the atmosphere absorbs the light of the heavenly bodies, so that  stars appear much less bright when near the horizon than when they are  higher up in the sky, and by reason of this absorption the setting sun  can be looked at with the naked eye without the discomfort which its  dazzling luster causes at noon.    [Illustration: FIG. 27.--Flattening of the sun's disk by refraction and  by reflection from the surface of the sea.]    51. THE TWILIGHT.--Another effect of the atmosphere, even more marked  than the preceding, is the twilight. As at sunrise the mountain top  catches the rays of the coming sun before they reach the lowland, and at  sunset it keeps them after they have faded from the regions below, so  the particles of dust and vapor, which always float in the atmosphere,  catch the sunlight and reflect it to the surface of the earth while the  sun is still below the horizon, giving at the beginning and end of day  that vague and diffuse light which we call twilight.    [Illustration: FIG. 28.--Twilight phenomena.]    Fig. 28 shows a part of the earth surrounded by such a dust-laden  atmosphere, which is illuminated on the left by the rays of the sun, but  which, on the right of the figure, lies in the shadow cast by the earth.  To an observer placed at _1_ the sun is just setting, and all the  atmosphere above him is illumined with its rays, which furnish a bright  twilight. When, by the earth's rotation, this observer has been carried  to _2_, all the region to the east of his zenith lies in the shadow,  while to the west there is a part of the atmosphere from which there  still comes a twilight, but now comparatively faint, because the lower  part of the atmosphere about our observer lies in the shadow, and it is  mainly its upper regions from which the light comes, and here the dust  and moisture are much less abundant than in the lower strata."]]]
