[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34259"],[0,"Hunting Dogs (#15)"],[1,"    There is a disease that kills more dogs in Florida than all the other  causes put together. It is called sore mouth, black tongue, new  disease and other names. I lost some fine hounds of this disease,  usually dying from six to eight days from the time of showing  disease. Symptoms of it are generally languor, dullness about the  eyes, little or no appetite, sometimes feverish and a dryness about  the mouth and at other times slobbers hang down from the mouth.    They seem anxious to drink water but are unable to swallow it. Their  tongues seem to be somewhat paralyzed, they can hardly pick up  anything. They usually want to roam around where they will not be  molested. I will give a remedy that I have which has cured several  cases of this disease with the only ones I ever knew to survive it. I  will give it for it may be the means of saving the lives of some good  dogs.    \"A gelatin coated pill or capsule of quinine containing five grains  twice a day for two days, then one each day for a week.\" Also swab  out their mouth with the following: \"Chlorate potassium half ounce,  murvate tincture iron half ounce. Put into one pint of water and  shake well. Tie rag or cotton to stick, letting it protrude over the  end, and swab out the mouth two or three times a day.\"    You want to go right at once to giving the remedy for if the disease  runs 36 hours I don't think there is any cure for it. The size doses  mentioned here are for good-sized dogs as grown hounds. Smaller ones  and pups reduce accordingly.    There is another disease that dogs are sometimes taken with in this  country. Some say it is caused by ticks. It is called \"staggers\" as  the dog that is affected with it staggers as he walks. It seems as  though they can't manage their hind parts. Sometimes they break down  and have to drag their hind parts (sled fashion.)    A remedy that I have never known to fail yet for that is: Lard and  spirits of turpentine about equal parts mixed and bathe in well  across the kidneys and also across the back of head where it joins to  neck. Usually two or three applications makes a cure.        PART III.    DOG LORE.        CHAPTER XVII.    STILL TRAILERS VS. TONGUERS. MUSIC.    Perhaps no more mooted question enters in for so widely separated  opinion as the comparative superiority of the Still Trailing dog and  the Tonguers.    The still or mute trailer is the deer, rabbit or night dog which does  not give tongue on the trail. He keeps his silence, until his game is  treed or in sight and about to tree.    The tonguer gives forth a joyous and lusty cry as soon as he makes a  strike, and continues to do so until the chase terminates. When treed  he changes his bark, so that usually the hunter can distinguish  between the signals.    We shall withhold personal opinion as to the preferable style, and  present the arguments of a number of adherents on both sides of the  question, allowing the reader to come to his own conclusion.    A West Virginia 'coon expert says, in favor of the tonguer: I have  had several good 'coon dogs, both tonguers and silent trailers. This  is a hilly, brushy country, with lots of deep hollows. The best 'coon  dog I ever had was a three-fourths fox hound, one-fourth bull dog. He  was very fast with a good nose and a wide hunter. He never struck a  cold trail and went straight ahead all the time. He has started a  'coon half a mile away from me and would go right out of hearing of  me, and I would follow the way I would judge the 'coon to travel and  would be hours finding him barking treed. If he had been a mute  trailer I would have left him in the woods without the slightest idea  where he was and that is no fun when you have gone three or four  miles walk from home to get a 'coon chase.    Another brother puts it this way: Some hunters prefer a still trailer  on a cold trail. I have handled both kinds but it is an advantage to  the hunter in keeping in touch with his hound if the hound will \"wind  his horn\" occasionally on a cold trail for very often a wide hound  will travel a couple of miles on a cold trail before starting the  game. In windy weather, the hunters might be at a loss to know in  which direction his dog was working, if he did not hear him. I like a  dog with a loud, clear voice and one that keeps the music going  steady once the game is afoot.    Still another gives voice to his sentiment thus: I want a good  tonguer, one that will give me no trouble in keeping the direction  they are going. One that is a courser, that is, that never foots  around trying to find every track a 'coon makes, but keeps on finding  ahead anywhere from a hundred yards to a quarter of a mile. That kind  of a dog keeps you awake when cold trailing, and is apt to warm up at  any time.    A Western tonguer adherent says: For 'coon I like the cold trailer  that lets you know where he is going, and don't believe they will  hole any sooner for him than a still trailer, and I never saw a full  blooded hound still track. My hounds give a long whoop every few rods  on cold trail, and will \"back brush\" a 'coon or wolf that is many  hours old but will find him, and you can follow up so as to keep in  hearing. My dogs are quite fast but I do not go back on a moderately  slow dog to shoot after. I think they circle better.    From Indian Territory comes this addition to the testimony: The  thoroughbred hound for 'coon is my view after 40 years' experience. A  good many are giving their idea as to which is best, the still  trailer or the dog that gives tongue. I have never known a  thoroughbred hound fail to give tongue on trail. The thoroughbred has  the greatest powers of scent and this is very important as you do not  have to travel so much ground to find a trail that he can run. What  we want when we go after 'coon is to start and catch all we can. If  we cannot start one we cannot catch him, sure. I have followed behind  over the same ground with my hound that another party had been over  with their still trailers and caught more 'coon than they.    And again if you are out on a windy night and your still trailer gets  a 'coon treed to the windward of you, you might as well go home as  there will be no more fun for you if he is a good tree dog.    Now just one thing more in regard to still trailers catching 'coon on  the ground. That has not been my experience, for you all know when  you go a rabbit hunting with a still trailer, how soon the rabbit  will hole. He has no warning where the dog is, so in trailing 'coon,  the 'coon will wait and listen to the hound and if he is a fast  runner, Mr. 'Coon has waited too long. He must make for the nearest  tree or get caught. With the still trailer, the 'coon hears the  leaves and brush snapping and without any more warning makes for his  home tree.    Hundreds of hunters take this view, that is, favor the dog which  barks from the time he takes up the trail. The principal advantage as  has been pointed out, is that the hound and hunter may thus keep in  closer touch, and that the hunter is treated to \"music,\" so sweet to  the ear of the average enthusiast.    Another considerable following, however, at once take issue and  present an array of argument in favor of the dog which keeps his  silence.    Let us first consider the views of a conservative Pennsylvania  brother, in favor of the still trailer: I see a good many 'coon  hunters disagree on 'coon dogs, still trailers vs. tongueing dogs.  Now in my experience, I have used nearly all kinds of 'coon dogs,  some good ones and some not so good. I think the difference is in the  kind of country to be hunted, for hunting in a very rough country  that is cut up by long hollows and large tracts of timber I prefer a  tongueing dog.    For hunting in this locality where it is all cut up into small fields  with principally all rail fences and timber in small blocks, mostly  cut over by lumbermen and nothing left but hollow trees and brush, I  prefer a still trailer by long odds, as the noisy dog gives the 'coon  warning as soon as he strikes the trail, then Mr. 'Coon takes to the  rail fence or a jungle of briers and old tree tops and begins to get  busy and is soon in one of those hollow trees, where he is perfectly  safe as far as I am concerned, for I never cut down any den trees.    The still trailer does his work quietly and is right on to the 'coon  before it is aware that the dog is after it. So Mr. 'Coon is obliged  to climb whatever kind of a tree there is handy and very often is  taken on the ground.    From a Central States hunter's letter: I used to be a dear lover of a  dog that would bark on trail and raise some of them, but now my  choice is a still trailer, as a quiet trailer suits this locality  best on account of the thickly populated country and the great amount  of stock raised, and a great many farmers claim the constant barking  of dogs frightens their sheep. For that reason fox chasing is fast  losing its interest and foxes are becoming quite a nuisance in the  destruction of quail, pheasant, rabbit and such like game.    A brother of conviction on this question writes: It takes patience,  perseverance and skill to properly train a hound for 'coon. First,  the dog must be silent until he finds the hot scent, so as not to  give Mr. Coon time to commence his sunny ways, as the 'coon has a  good knowledge box and lots of strings to his bow which he uses to  evade Mr. Hound. He will swim down and sometimes up stream and often  crosses them. Will never miss a hollow log and comes out at the other  end, and will climb leaning trees and leap from them to others and  may return to the stream for a good long swim before he will make  quietly for his den. This is what an old 'coon will often do with a  noisy dog, but with a swift and silent one he will have to climb at  once and stay there.    Another telling stroke for silence: Regarding silent trailers: By  silent trailer I mean a dog that will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3434"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#15)"],[1,"it up, and given it its expanse;    And the Earthwe have stretched it out like a carpet; and how    smoothly have we spread it forth!    And of everything have we created pairs: that haply ye may reflect.    Fly then to God: I come to you from him a plain warner.    And set not up another god with God: I come to you from him a plain warner.    Even thus came there no apostle to those who flourished before them, but they  exclaimed, \"Sorcerer, or Possessed.\"    Have they made a legacy to one another of this scoff? Yes, they are a rebel  people.    Turn away, then, from them, and thou shalt not incur reproach:    Yet warn them, for, in truth, warning will profit the believers.    I have not created Djinn and men, but that they should worship me:    I require not sustenance from them, neither require I that they feed me:    Verily, God is the sole sustainer: possessed of might: the unshaken!    Therefore to those who injure thee shall be a fate like the fate of    their fellows of old. Let them not challenge me to hasten it.    Woe then to the infidels, because of their threatened day.      _______________________    1 Lit.

Reeling on that day the Heaven shall reel,    And stirring shall the mountains stir.2    And woe, on that day, to those who called the apostles liars,    Who plunged for pastime into vain disputes    On that day shall they be thrust with thrusting to the fire of Hell:    \"This is the fire which ye treated as a lie.    What! is this magic, then? or, do ye not see it?    Burn ye therein: bear it patiently or impatiently 'twill be the same to you:  for ye shall assuredly receive the reward of your doings.\"    But mid gardens and delights shall they dwell who have feared God,    Rejoicing in what their Lord hath given them; and that from the pain of hell-  fire hath their Lord preserved them.    \"Eat and drink with healthy enjoyment, in recompense for your deeds.\"    On couches ranged in rows shall they recline; and to the damsels with large  dark eyes will we wed them.    And to those who have believed, whose offspring have followed them in the  faith, will we again unite their offspring; nor of the meed of their works  will we in the least defraud them. Pledged to God is every man for his  actions and their desert.3    And fruits in abundance will we give them, and flesh as they shall desire:    Therein shall they pass to one another the cup which shall engender no light  discourse, no motive to sin:    And youths shall go round among them beautiful as imbedded pearls:    And shall accost one another and ask mutual questions.    \"A time indeed there was,\" will they say, \"when we were full of care as to  the future lot of our families;    But kind hath God been to us, and from the pestilential torment hath he  preserved us;    For, heretofore we called upon Himand He is the Beneficent, the Merciful.\"    Warn thou, then. For thou by the favour of thy Lord art neither soothsayer  nor possessed.    Will they say, \"A poet! let us await some adverse turn of his fortune?\"    SAY, wait ye, and in sooth I too will wait with you.    Is it their dreams which inspire them with this? or is it that they are a  perverse people?    Will they say, \"He hath forged it (the Koran) himself?\" Nay, rather it is  that they believed not.    Let them then produce a discourse like it, if they speak the Truth.    Were they created by nothing? or were they the creators of themselves?    Created they the Heavens and Earth? Nay, rather, they have no faith.    Hold they thy Lord's treasures? Bear they the rule supreme?    Have they a ladder for hearing the angels? Let any one who hath heard them  bring a clear proof of it.    Hath God daughters and ye sons?    Asketh thou pay of them? they are themselves weighed down with debts.    Have they such a knowledge of the secret things that they can write them  down?    Desire they to lay snares for thee? But the snared ones shall be they who do  not believe.    Have they any God beside God? Glory be to God above what they join with Him.    And should they see a fragment of the heaven falling down, they would say,  \"It is only a dense cloud.\"    Leave them then until they come face to face with the day when they shall  swoon away:    A day in which their snares shall not at all avail them, neither shall they  be helped.    And verily, beside this is there a punishment for the evildoers: but most of  them know it not.    Wait thou patiently the judgment of thy Lord, for thou art in our eye; and  celebrate the praise of thy Lord when thou risest up,    And in the night-season: Praise him when the stars are setting.      _______________________    1 Of the Caaba.    2 Comp.

Day that shall exalt!    When the earth shall be shaken with a shock,    And the mountains shall be crumbled with a crumbling,    And shall become scattered dust,    And into three bands shall ye be divided:2    Then the people of the right hand3Oh! how happy shall be the people of the  right hand!    And the people of the left handOh! how wretched shall be the people of the  left hand!    And they who were foremost on earththe foremost still.4    These are they who shall be brought nigh to God,    In gardens of delight;    A crowd of the former    And few of the latter generations;    On inwrought couches    Reclining on them face to face:    Aye-blooming youths go round about to them    With goblets and ewers and a cup of flowing wine;    Their brows ache not from it, nor fails the sense:    And with such fruits as shall please them best,    And with flesh of such birds, as they shall long for:    And theirs shall be the Houris, with large dark eyes, like pearls  hidden in  their shells,    In recompense of their labours past.    No vain discourse shall they hear therein, nor charge of sin,    But only the cry, \"Peace! Peace!\"    And the people of the right handoh! how happy shall be the people of the  right hand!    Amid thornless sidrahs5    And talh6 trees clad with fruit,    And in extended shade,    And by flowing waters,    And with abundant fruits,7    Unfailing, unforbidden,    And on lofty couches.    Of a rare creation have we created the Houris,    And we have made them ever virgins,    Dear to their spouses, of equal age with them,8    For the people of the right hand,    A crowd of the former,    And a crowd of the latter generations.9    But the people of the left handoh! how wretched shall be the people of the  left hand!    Amid pestilential10 winds and in scalding water,    And in the shadow of a black smoke,    Not cool, and horrid to behold.11    For they truly, ere this, were blessed with worldly goods,    But persisted in heinous sin,    And were wont to say,    \"What! after we have died, and become dust and bones, shall we be raised?    And our fathers, the men of yore?\"    SAY: Aye, the former and the latter:    Gathered shall they all be for the time of a known day.    Then ye, O ye the erring, the gainsaying,    Shall surely eat of the tree Ez-zakkoum,    And fill your bellies with it,    And thereupon shall ye drink boiling water,    And ye shall drink as the thirsty camel drinketh.    This shall be their repast in the day of reckoning!    We created you, will ye not credit us?12    What think ye? The germs of life13    Is it ye who create them? or are we their creator?    It is we who have decreed that death should be among you;    Yet are we not thereby hindered14 from replacing you with others, your likes,  or from producing you again in a form which ye know not!    Ye have known the first creation: will ye not then reflect?    What think ye? That which ye sow    Is it ye who cause its upgrowth, or do we cause it to spring forth?    If we pleased we could so make your harvest dry and brittle that ye would  ever marvel and say,    \"Truly we have been at cost,15 yet are we forbidden harvest.\"    What think ye of the water ye drink?    Is it ye who send it down from the clouds, or send we it down?    Brackish could we make it, if we pleased: will ye not then be thankful?    What think ye?
