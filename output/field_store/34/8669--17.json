CHAPTER IV    RIVER DEPOSITS      The characteristic features of river deposits and the forms which  they assume may be treated under three heads: (1) valley deposits,  (2) basin deposits, and (3) deltas.    VALLEY DEPOSITS    FLOOD PLAINS are the surfaces of the alluvial deposits which  streams build along their courses at times of flood. A swift  current then sweeps along the channel, while a shallow sheet of  water moves slowly over the flood plain, spreading upon it a thin  layer of sediment. It has been estimated that each inundation of  the Nile leaves a layer of fertilizing silt three hundredths of an  inch thick over the flood plain of Egypt.    Flood plains may consist of a thin spread of alluvium over the  flat rock floor of a valley which is being widened by the lateral  erosion of a graded stream (Fig. 60). Flood-plain deposits of  great thickness may be built by aggrading rivers even in valleys  whose rock floors have never been thus widened.    A cross section of a flood plain shows that it is highest next the  river, sloping gradually thence to the valley sides. These wide  natural embankments are due to the fact that the river deposit is  heavier near the bank, where the velocity of the silt-laden  channel current is first checked by contact with the slower-moving  overflow.    Thus banked off from the stream, the outer portions of a flood  plain are often ill-drained and swampy, and here vegetal deposits,  such as peat, may be interbedded with river silts.    A map of a wide flood plain, such as that of the Mississippi or  the Missouri (Fig. 77), shows that the courses of the tributaries  on entering it are deflected downstream. Why?    The aggrading streams by which flood plains are constructed  gradually build their immediate banks and beds to higher and  higher levels, and therefore find it easy at times of great floods  to break their natural embankments and take new courses over the  plain. In this way they aggrade each portion of it in turn by  means of their shifting channels,    BRAIDED CHANNELS. A river actively engaged in aggrading its valley  with coarse waste builds a flood plain of comparatively steep  gradient and often flows down it in a fairly direct course and  through a network of braided channels. From time to time a channel  becomes choked with waste, and the water no longer finding room in  it breaks out and cuts and builds itself a new way which reunites  down valley with the other channels. Thus there becomes  established a network of ever-changing channels inclosing low  islands of sand and gravel.    TERRACES. While aggrading streams thus tend to shift their  channels, degrading streams, on the contrary, become more and more  deeply intrenched in their valleys. It often occurs that a stream,  after having built a flood plain, ceases to aggrade its bed  because of a lessened load or for other reasons, such as an uplift  of the region, and begins instead to degrade it. It leaves the  original flood plain out of reach of even the highest floods. When  again it reaches grade at a lower level it produces a new flood  plain by lateral erosion in the older deposits, remnants of which  stand as terraces on one or both sides of the valley. In this way  a valley may be lined with a succession of terraces at different  levels, each level representing an abandoned flood plain.    MEANDERS. Valleys aggraded with fine waste form well-nigh level  plains over which streams wind from side to side of a direct  course in symmetric bends known as meanders, from the name of a  winding river of Asia Minor. The giant Mississippi has developed  meanders with a radius of one and one half miles, but a little  creek may display on its meadow as perfect curves only a rod or so  in radius. On the flood plain of either river or creek we may find  examples of the successive stages in the development of the  meander, from its beginning in the slight initial bend sufficient  to deflect the current against the outer side. Eroding here and  depositing on the inner side of the bend, it gradually reaches  first the open bend whose width and length are not far from equal,  and later that of the horseshoe meander whose diameter transverse  to the course of the stream is much greater than that parallel  with it. Little by little the neck of land projecting into the  bend is narrowed, until at last it is cut through and a \"cut-off\"  is established. The old channel is now silted up at both ends and  becomes a crescentic lagoon, or oxbow lake, which fills gradually  to an arc-shaped shallow depression.    FLOOD PLAINS CHARACTERISTIC OF MATURE RIVERS. On reaching grade a  stream planes a flat floor for its continually widening valley.  Ever cutting on the outer bank of its curves, it deposits on the  inner bank scroll-like flood-plain patches. For a while the valley  bluffs do not give its growing meanders room to develop to their  normal size, but as planation goes on, the bluffs are driven back  to the full width of the meander belt and still later to a width  which gives room for broad stretches of flood plain on either  side.    Usually a river first attains grade near its mouth, and here first  sinks its bed to near baselevel. Extending its graded course  upstream by cutting away barrier after barrier, it comes to have a  widened and mature valley over its lower course, while its young  headwaters are still busily eroding their beds. Its ungraded  branches may thus bring down to its lower course more waste than  it is competent to carry on to the sea, and here it aggrades its  bed and builds a flood plain in order to gain a steeper gradient  and velocity enough to transport its load.    As maturity is past and the relief of the land is lessened, a  smaller and smaller load of waste is delivered to the river. It  now has energy to spare and again degrades its valley, excavating  its former flood plains and leaving them in terraces on either  side, and at last in its old age sweeping them away.    ALLUVIAL CONES AND FANS. In hilly and mountainous countries one  often sees on a valley side a conical or fan-shaped deposit of  waste at the mouth of a lateral stream. The cause is obvious: the  young branch has not been able as yet to wear its bed to accordant  level with the already deepened valley of the master stream. It  therefore builds its bed to grade at the point of juncture by  depositing here its load of waste,--a load too heavy to be carried  along the more gentle profile of the trunk valley.    Where rivers descend from a mountainous region upon the plain they  may build alluvial fans of exceedingly gentle slope. Thus the  rivers of the western side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains have  spread fans with a radius of as much as forty miles and a slope  too slight to be detected without instruments, where they leave  the rock-cut canyons in the mountains and descend upon the broad  central valley of California.    As a river flows over its fan it commonly divides into a  branchwork of shifting channels called DISTRIBUTARIES, since they  lead off the water from the main stream. In this way each part of  the fan is aggraded and its symmetric form is preserved.    PIEDMONT PLAINS. Mountain streams may build their confluent fans  into widespread piedmont (foot of the mountain) alluvial plains.  These are especially characteristic of arid lands, where the  streams wither as they flow out upon the thirsty lowlands and are  therefore compelled to lay down a large portion of their load. In  humid climates mountain-born streams are usually competent to  carry their loads of waste on to the sea, and have energy to spare  to cut the lower mountain slopes into foothills. In arid regions  foothills are commonly absent and the ranges rise, as from  pedestals, above broad, sloping plains of stream-laid waste.    THE HIGH PLAINS. The rivers which flow eastward from the Rocky  Mountains have united their fans in a continuous sheet of waste  which stretches forward from the base of the mountains for  hundreds of miles and in places is five hundred feet thick (Fig.  80). That the deposit was made in ancient times on land and not in  the sea is proved by the remains which it contains of land animals  and plants of species now extinct. That it was laid by rivers and  not by fresh-water lakes is shown by its structure. Wide stretches  of flat-lying, clays and sands are interrupted by long, narrow  belts of gravel which mark the channels of the ancient streams.  Gravels, and sands are often cross bedded, and their well worn  pebbles may be identified with the rocks of the mountains. After  building this sheet of waste the streams ceased to aggrade and  began the work of destruction. Large uneroded remnants, their  surfaces flat as a floor, remain as the High Plains of western  Kansas and Nebraska.    RIVER DEPOSITS IN SUBSIDING TROUGHS. To a geologist the most  important river deposits are those which gather in areas of  gradual subsidence; they are often"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/421"],[0,"Kidnapped (#15)"],[1,"looked after.    For all that, when I saw what care he took to pluck out the threads  where the button had been cut away, I put a higher value on his gift.    He was still so engaged when we were hailed by Mr. Riach from the deck,  asking for a parley; and I, climbing through the skylight and sitting on  the edge of it, pistol in hand and with a bold front, though inwardly in  fear of broken glass, hailed him back again and bade him speak out. He  came to the edge of the round-house, and stood on a coil of rope, so  that his chin was on a level with the roof; and we looked at each other  awhile in silence. Mr. Riach, as I do not think he had been very forward  in the battle, so he had got off with nothing worse than a blow upon the  cheek: but he looked out of heart and very weary, having been all night  afoot, either standing watch or doctoring the wounded.    \"This is a bad job,\" said he at last, shaking his head.    \"It was none of our choosing,\" said I.    \"The captain,\" says he, \"would like to speak with your friend. They  might speak at the window.\"    \"And how do we know what treachery he means?\" cried I.    \"He means none, David,\" returned Mr. Riach, \"and if he did, I'll tell ye  the honest truth, we couldnae get the men to follow.\"    \"Is that so?\" said I.    \"I'll tell ye more than that,\" said he. \"It's not only the men; it's me.  I'm frich'ened, Davie.\" And he smiled across at me. \"No,\" he continued,  \"what we want is to be shut of him.\"    Thereupon I consulted with Alan, and the parley was agreed to and  parole given upon either side; but this was not the whole of Mr. Riach's  business, and he now begged me for a dram with such instancy and such  reminders of his former kindness, that at last I handed him a pannikin  with about a gill of brandy. He drank a part, and then carried the rest  down upon the deck, to share it (I suppose) with his superior.    A little after, the captain came (as was agreed) to one of the windows,  and stood there in the rain, with his arm in a sling, and looking stern  and pale, and so old that my heart smote me for having fired upon him.    Alan at once held a pistol in his face.    \"Put that thing up!\" said the captain. \"Have I not passed my word, sir?  or do ye seek to affront me?\"    \"Captain,\" says Alan, \"I doubt your word is a breakable. Last night ye  haggled and argle-bargled like an apple-wife; and then passed me your  word, and gave me your hand to back it; and ye ken very well what was  the upshot. Be damned to your word!\" says he.    \"Well, well, sir,\" said the captain, \"ye'll get little good by  swearing.\" (And truly that was a fault of which the captain was quite  free.) \"But we have other things to speak,\" he continued, bitterly.  \"Ye've made a sore hash of my brig; I haven't hands enough left to work  her; and my first officer (whom I could ill spare) has got your sword  throughout his vitals, and passed without speech. There is nothing left  me, sir, but to put back into the port of Glasgow after hands; and there  (by your leave) ye will find them that are better able to talk to you.\"    \"Ay?\" said Alan; \"and faith, I'll have a talk with them mysel'! Unless  there's naebody speaks English in that town, I have a bonny tale for  them. Fifteen tarry sailors upon the one side, and a man and a halfling  boy upon the other! O, man, it's peetiful!\"    Hoseason flushed red.    \"No,\" continued Alan, \"that'll no do. Ye'll just have to set me ashore  as we agreed.\"    \"Ay,\" said Hoseason, \"but my first officer is dead--ye ken best how.  There's none of the rest of us acquaint with this coast, sir; and it's  one very dangerous to ships.\"    \"I give ye your choice,\" says Alan. \"Set me on dry ground in Appin,  or Ardgour, or in Morven, or Arisaig, or Morar; or, in brief, where ye  please, within thirty miles of my own country; except in a country of  the Campbells. That's a broad target. If ye miss that, ye must be as  feckless at the sailoring as I have found ye at the fighting. Why, my  poor country people in their bit cobles* pass from island to island in  all weathers, ay, and by night too, for the matter of that.\"         *Coble: a small boat used in fishing.    \"A coble's not a ship, sir,\" said the captain. \"It has nae draught of  water.\"    \"Well, then, to Glasgow if ye list!\" says Alan. \"We'll have the laugh of  ye at the least.\"    \"My mind runs little upon laughing,\" said the captain. \"But all this  will cost money, sir.\"    \"Well, sir,\" says Alan, \"I am nae weathercock. Thirty guineas, if ye land  me on the sea-side; and sixty, if ye put me in the Linnhe Loch.\"    \"But see, sir, where we lie, we are but a few hours' sail from  Ardnamurchan,\" said Hoseason. \"Give me sixty, and I'll set ye there.\"    \"And I'm to wear my brogues and run jeopardy of the red-coats to please  you?\" cries Alan. \"No, sir; if ye want sixty guineas earn them, and set  me in my own country.\"    \"It's to risk the brig, sir,\" said the captain, \"and your own lives  along with her.\"    \"Take it or want it,\" says Alan.    \"Could ye pilot us at all?\" asked the captain, who was frowning to  himself.    \"Well, it's doubtful,\" said Alan. \"I'm more of a fighting man (as ye  have seen for yoursel') than a sailor-man. But I have been often enough  picked up and set down upon this coast, and should ken something of the  lie of it.\"    The captain shook his head, still frowning.    \"If I had lost less money on this unchancy cruise,\" says he, \"I would  see you in a rope's end before I risked my brig, sir. But be it as ye  will. As soon as I get a slant of wind (and there's some coming, or I'm  the more mistaken) I'll put it in hand. But there's one thing more. We  may meet in with a king's ship and she may lay us aboard, sir, with no  blame of mine: they keep the cruisers thick upon this coast, ye ken who  for. Now, sir, if that was to befall, ye might leave the money.\"    \"Captain,\" says Alan, \"if ye see a pennant, it shall be your part to  run away. And now, as I hear you're a little short of brandy in the  fore-part, I'll offer ye a change: a bottle of brandy against two  buckets of water.\"    That was the last clause of the treaty, and was duly executed on both  sides; so that Alan and I could at last wash out the round-house and be  quit of the memorials of those whom we had slain, and the captain and  Mr. Riach could be happy again in their own way, the name of which was  drink.          CHAPTER XII    I HEAR OF THE \"RED FOX\"    Before we had done cleaning out the round-house, a breeze sprang up from  a little to the east of north. This blew off the rain and brought out  the sun.    And here I must explain; and the reader would do well to look at a map.  On the day when the fog fell and we ran down Alan's boat, we had been  running through the Little Minch. At dawn after the battle, we lay  becalmed to the east of the Isle of Canna or between that and Isle  Eriska in the chain of the Long Island. Now to get from there to the  Linnhe Loch, the straight course was through the narrows of the Sound of  Mull. But the captain had no chart; he was afraid to trust his brig so  deep among the islands; and the wind serving well, he preferred to go by  west of Tiree and come up under the southern coast of the great Isle of  Mull.    All day the breeze held in the same point, and rather freshened than  died down; and towards afternoon, a swell began to set in from round the  outer Hebrides. Our course, to go round about the inner isles, was to  the west of south, so that at first we had this swell upon our beam, and  were much rolled about. But after nightfall, when we had turned the end  of Tiree and began to head more to the east, the sea came right astern.    Meanwhile, the early part of the day, before the swell came up, was  very pleasant; sailing, as we were, in a bright sunshine and with  many mountainous islands upon different sides. Alan and I sat in the  round-house with the doors open on each side (the wind being straight  astern), and smoked a pipe or two of the captain's fine tobacco. It was  at this time we heard each other's stories, which was the more important  to me, as I gained some knowledge of that wild Highland country on which  I was so soon to land. In those days, so close on the back of the great  rebellion, it was needful a man should know what he was doing when he  went upon the heather.    It was I that showed the example, telling him all my misfortune; which  he heard with great good-nature. Only, when I came to mention that good  friend of mine, Mr. Campbell the minister, Alan fired up and cried out  that he hated all that were of that name.    \"Why,\" said I, \"he is a man you should be proud to give your hand to.\"    \"I know nothing I would help a Campbell to,\" says he, \"unless it was a  leaden bullet. I would hunt all of that name like blackcocks. If I lay  dying, I would crawl upon my knees to my chamber window for a shot at  one.\"    \"Why, Alan,\" I cried, \"what ails ye at the Campbells?\"    \"Well,\" says he, \"ye ken very well that I am an Appin Stewart, and the  Campbells have long harried and wasted those of my name; ay, and got  lands of us by treachery--but never with the sword,\" he cried loudly,  and with the word brought down his fist upon the table. But I paid the  less attention to this, for I knew it was usually said by those who have  the underhand. \"There's more than that,\" he continued, \"and all in the  same story: lying words, lying papers, tricks fit for a peddler, and the  show of what's legal over all, to make a man the more angry.\"    \"You that are so wasteful of your buttons,\" said I, \"I can hardly think  you would be a good judge of business.\"    \"Ah!\" says he, falling again to smiling, \"I got my wastefulness from  the same man I got the buttons from; and that was my poor father, Duncan  Stewart, grace be to him! He was the prettiest man of his kindred; and  the best swordsman in the Hielands, David, and that is the same as to  say, in all the"]]]
