That power is plainly given; and if a new  State is admitted, it needs no further legislation by Congress,  because the Constitution itself defines the relative rights and  powers, and duties of the State, and the citizens of the State, and  the Federal Government. But no power is given to acquire a Territory  to be held and governed permanently in that character.    And indeed the power exercised by Congress to acquire territory and  establish a Government there, according to its own unlimited  discretion, was viewed with great jealousy by the leading statesmen  of the day. And in the Federalist, (No. 38,) written by Mr. Madison,  he speaks of the acquisition of the Northwestern Territory by the  confederated States, by the cession from Virginia, and the  establishment of a Government there, as an exercise of power not  warranted by the Articles of Confederation, and dangerous to the  liberties of the people. And he urges the adoption of the Constitution  as a security and safeguard against such an exercise of power.    We do not mean, however, to question the power of Congress in this  respect. The power to expand the territory of the United States by the  admission of new States is plainly given; and in the construction of  this power by all the departments of the Government, it has been held  to authorize the acquisition of territory, not fit for admission at  the time, but to be admitted as soon as its population and situation  would entitle it to admission. It is acquired to become a State, and  not to be held as a colony and governed by Congress with absolute  authority; and as the propriety of admitting a new State is committed  to the sound discretion of Congress, the power to acquire territory  for that purpose, to be held by the United States until it is in a  suitable condition to become a State upon an equal footing with the  other States, must rest upon the same discretion. It is a question for  the political department of the Government, and not the judicial; and  whatever the political department of the Government shall recognise as  within the limits of the United States, the judicial department is  also bound to recognise, and to administer in it the laws of the  United States, so far as they apply, and to maintain in the Territory  the authority and rights of the Government, and also the personal  rights and rights of property of individual citizens, as secured by  the Constitution. All we mean to say on this point is, that, as there  is no express regulation in the Constitution defining the power which  the General Government may exercise over the person or property of a  citizen in a Territory thus acquired, the court must necessarily look  to the provisions and principles of the Constitution, and its  distribution of powers, for the rules and principles by which its  decision must be governed.    Taking this rule to guide us, it may be safely assumed that citizens  of the United States who migrate to a Territory belonging to the  people of the United States, cannot be ruled as mere colonists,  dependent upon the will of the General Government, and to be governed  by any laws it may think proper to impose. The principle upon which  our Governments rest, and upon which alone they continue to exist, is  the union of States, sovereign and independent within their own limits  in their internal and domestic concerns, and bound together as one  people by a General Government, possessing certain enumerated and  restricted powers, delegated to it by the people of the several  States, and exercising supreme authority within the scope of the  powers granted to it, throughout the dominion of the United States. A  power, therefore, in the General Government to obtain and hold  colonies and dependent territories, over which they might legislate  without restriction, would be inconsistent with its own existence in  its present form. Whatever it acquires, it acquires for the benefit of  the people of the several States who created it. It is their trustee  acting for them, and charged with the duty of promoting the interests  of the whole people of the Union in the exercise of the powers  specifically granted.    At the time when the Territory in question was obtained by cession  from France, it contained no population fit to be associated together  and admitted as a State; and it therefore was absolutely necessary to  hold possession of it, as a Territory belonging to the United States,  until it was settled and inhabited by a civilized community capable of  self-government, and in a condition to be admitted on equal terms with  the other States as a member of the Union. But, as we have before  said, it was acquired by the General Government, as the representative  and trustee of the people of the United States, and it must therefore  be held in that character for their common and equal benefit; for it  was the people of the several States, acting through their agent and  representative, the Federal Government, who in fact acquired the  Territory in question, and the Government holds it for their common  use until it shall be associated with the other States as a member of  the Union.    But until that time arrives, it is undoubtedly necessary that some  Government should be established, in order to organize society, and to  protect the inhabitants in their persons and property; and as the  people of the United States could act in this matter only through the  Government which represented them, and through which they spoke and  acted when the Territory was obtained, it was not only within the  scope of its powers, but it was its duty to pass such laws and  establish such a Government as would enable those by whose authority  they acted to reap the advantages anticipated from its acquisition,  and to gather there a population which would enable it to assume the  position to which it was destined among the States of the Union. The  power to acquire necessarily carries with it the power to preserve and  apply to the purposes for which it was acquired. The form of  government to be established necessarily rested in the discretion of  Congress. It was their duty to establish the one that would be best  suited for the protection and security of the citizens of the United  States, and other inhabitants who might be authorized to take up their  abode there, and that must always depend upon the existing condition  of the Territory, as to the number and character of its inhabitants,  and their situation in the Territory. In some cases a Government,  consisting of persons appointed by the Federal Government, would best  subserve the interests of the Territory, when the inhabitants were few  and scattered, and new to one another. In other instances, it would be  more advisable to commit the powers of self-government to the people  who had settled in the Territory, as being the most competent to  determine what was best for their own interests. But some form of  civil authority would be absolutely necessary to organize and preserve  civilized society, and prepare it to become a State; and what is the  best form must always depend on the condition of the Territory at the  time, and the choice of the mode must depend upon the exercise of a  discretionary power by Congress, acting within the scope of its  constitutional authority, and not infringing upon the rights of person  or rights of property of the citizen who might go there to reside, or  for any other lawful purpose. It was acquired by the exercise of this  discretion, and it must be held and governed in like manner, until it  is fitted to be a State.    But the power of Congress over the person or property of a citizen can  never be a mere discretionary power under our Constitution and form of  Government. The powers of the Government and the rights and privileges  of the citizen are regulated and plainly defined by the Constitution  itself. And when the Territory becomes a part of the United States,  the Federal Government enters into possession in the character  impressed upon it by those who created it. It enters upon it with its  powers over the citizen strictly defined, and limited by the  Constitution, from which it derives its own existence, and by virtue  of which alone it continues to exist and act as a Government and  sovereignty. It has no power of any kind beyond it; and it cannot,  when it enters a Territory of the United States, put off its  character, and assume discretionary or despotic powers which the  Constitution has denied to it. It cannot create for itself a new  character separated from the citizens of the United States, and the  duties it owes them under the provisions of the Constitution. The  Territory being a part of the United States, the Government and the  citizen both enter it under the authority of the Constitution, with  their respective rights defined and marked out; and the Federal  Government can exercise no power over his person or property, beyond  what that instrument confers, nor lawfully deny any right which it has  reserved.    A reference to a few of the provisions of the Constitution will  illustrate this proposition.    For example, no one, we presume, will contend that Congress can make  any law in a Territory respecting the establishment of religion, or  the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of  the press, or the right of the people of the Territory peaceably to  assemble, and to petition the Government for the redress of  grievances.    Nor can Congress deny to the people the right to keep and bear arms,  nor the right to trial by jury, nor compel any one to be a witness  against himself in a criminal proceeding.    These powers, and others, in relation to rights of person, which it is  not necessary here to enumerate, are, in express and positive terms,  denied to the General Government; and the rights of private property  have been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31427"],[0,"Miscellaneous Writings, 1883-1896 (#15)"],[1,"  spurious works on mental healing. By rendering error  such a service, you lose much more than can be gained  by mere unity on the single issue of opposition to unjust  medical laws. [5]    A league which obligates its members to give money  and influence in support and defense of medical char-  latans in general, and possibly to aid individual rights  in a wrong direction--which Christian Science eschews  --should be avoided. Anybody and everybody, who [10]  will fight the medical faculty, can join this league. It is  better to be friendly with cultured and conscientious  medical men, who leave Christian Science to rise or fall  on its own merit or demerit, than to affiliate with a wrong  class of people. [15]    Unconstitutional and unjust coercive legislation and  laws, infringing individual rights, must be \"of few days,  and full of trouble.\" The _vox populi_, through the provi-  dence of God, promotes and impels all true reform; and,  at the best time, will redress wrongs and rectify injus- [20]  tice. Tyranny can thrive but feebly under our Govern-  ment. God reigns, and will \"turn and overturn\" until  right is found supreme.    In a certain sense, we should commiserate the lot of  regular doctors, who, in successive generations for cen- [25]  turies, have planted and sown and reaped in the fields  of what they deem pathology, hygiene, and therapeutics,  but are now elbowed by a new school of practitioners,  outdoing the healing of the old. The old will not patronize  the new school, at least not until it shall come to understand [30]  the medical system of the new.    Christian Science Mind-healing rests demonstrably on    [Page 81.]    the broad and sure foundation of Science; and this is [1]  not the basis of _materia medica_, as some of the most skil-  ful and scholarly physicians openly admit.    To prevent all unpleasant and unchristian action--as  we drift, by right of God's dear love, into more spiritual [5]  lines of life--let each society of practitioners, the matter-  physicians and the metaphysicians, agree to disagree, and  then patiently wait on God to decide, as surely He will,  which is the true system of medicine.    _Do we not see in the commonly accepted teachings of the_ [10]  _day, the Christ-idea mingled with the teachings of John_  _the Baptist? or, rather, Are not the last eighteen centuries_  _but the footsteps of Truth being baptized of John, and com-_  _ing up straightway out of the ceremonial (or ritualistic)_  _waters to receive the benediction of an honored Father, and_ [15]  _afterwards to go up into the wilderness, in order to over-_  _come mortal sense, before it shall go forth into all the cities_  _and towns of Judea, or see many of the people from beyond_  _Jordan? Now, if all this be a fair or correct view of this_  _question, why does not John hear this voice, or see the_ [20]  _dove,--or has not Truth yet reached the shore?_    Every individual character, like the individual John  the Baptist, at some date must cry in the desert of  earthly joy; and his voice be heard divinely and  humanly. In the desolation of human understanding, [25]  divine Love hears and answers the human call for help;  and the voice of Truth utters the divine verities of being  which deliver mortals out of the depths of ignorance  and vice. This _is_ the Father's benediction. It gives  lessons to human life, guides the understanding, peoples [30]    [Page 82.]    the mind with spiritual ideas, reconstructs the Judean [1]  religion, and reveals God and man as the Principle and  idea of all good.    Understanding this fact in Christian Science, brings  the peace symbolized by a dove; and this peace floweth [5]  as a river into a shoreless eternity. He who knew the  foretelling Truth, beheld the forthcoming Truth, as it  came up out of the baptism of Spirit, to enlighten and  redeem mortals. Such Christians as John cognize the  symbols of God, reach the sure foundations of time, stand [10]  upon the shore of eternity, and grasp and gather--in all  glory--what eye hath not seen.    _Is there infinite progression with man after the destruc-_  _tion of mortal mind?_    Man is the offspring and idea of the Supreme Being, [15]  whose law is perfect and infinite. In obedience to this  law, man is forever unfolding the endless beatitudes of  Being; for he is the image and likeness of infinite Life,  Truth, and Love.    Infinite progression is concrete being, which finite [20]  mortals see and comprehend only as abstract glory. As  mortal mind, or the material sense of life, is put off,  the spiritual sense and Science of being is brought to  light.    Mortal mind is a myth; the one Mind is immortal. [25]  A mythical or mortal sense of existence is consumed  as a moth, in the treacherous glare of its own flame--  the errors which devour it. Immortal Mind is God,  immortal good; in whom the Scripture saith \"we live,  and move, and have our being.\" This Mind, then, is not [30]  subject to growth, change, or diminution, but is the divine    [Page 83.]    intelligence, or Principle, of all real being; holding [1]  man forever in the rhythmic round of unfolding bliss,  as a living witness to and perpetual idea of inexhaustible  good.    _In your book, Science and Health,_(_3_)_ page 181, you_ [5]  _say: __\"__Every sin is the author of itself, and every_  _invalid the cause of his own sufferings.__\"__ On page_  _182 you say: __\"__Sickness is a growth of illusion, spring-_  _ing from a seed of thought,--either your own thought_  _or another's.__\"__ Will you please explain this seeming_ [10]  _contradiction?_    No person can accept another's belief, except it be  with the consent of his own belief. If the error which  knocks at the door of your own thought originated in  another's mind, you are a free moral agent to reject or [15]  to accept this error; hence, you are the arbiter of your  own fate, and sin is the author of sin. In the words  of our Master, you are \"a liar, and the father of it  [the lie].\"    _Why did Jesus call himself __\"__the Son of man__\"__?_ [20]    In the life of our Lord, meekness was as conspicuous  as might. In John xvii. he declared his sonship with  God: \"These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his  eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come;  glorify Thy Son, that Thy Son also may glorify Thee.\" [25]  The hour had come for the avowal of this great truth,  and for the proof of his eternal Life and sonship. Jesus'    [Page 84.]    wisdom ofttimes was shown by his forbearing to speak, [1]  as well as by speaking, the whole truth. Haply he waited  for a preparation of the human heart to receive start-  ling announcements. This wisdom, which character-  ized his sayings, did not prophesy his death, and thereby [5]  hasten or permit it.    The disciples and prophets thrust disputed points on  minds unprepared for them. This cost them their lives,  and the world's temporary esteem; but the prophecies  were fulfilled, and their motives were rewarded by [10]  growth and more spiritual understanding, which dawns  by degrees on mortals. The spiritual Christ was infal-  lible; Jesus, as material manhood, was not Christ. The  \"man of sorrows\" knew that the man of joys, his spiritual  self, or Christ, was the Son of God; and that the mor- [15]  tal mind, not the immortal Mind, suffered. The human  manifestation of the Son of God was called the Son of  man, or Mary's son.    _Please explain Paul's meaning in the text, __\"__For to me_  _to live is Christ, and to die is gain.__\"_ [20]    The Science of Life, overshadowing Paul's sense of  life in matter, so far extinguished the latter as forever  to quench his love for it. The discipline of the flesh is  designed to turn one, like a weary traveller, to the home  of Love. To lose error thus, is to live in Christ, Truth. [25]  A true sense of the falsity of material joys and sorrows,  pleasures and pains, takes them away, and teaches Life's  lessons aright. The transition from our lower sense of  Life to a new and higher sense thereof, even though it be  through the door named death, yields a clearer and [30]  nearer sense of Life to those who have utilized the present,    [Page 85.]    and are ripe for the harvest-home. To the battle- [1]  worn and weary Christian hero, Life eternal brings  blessings.    _Is a Christian Scientist ever sick, and has he who is_  _sick been regenerated?_ [5]    The Christian Scientist learns spiritually all that he  knows of Life, and demonstrates what he understands.  God is recognized as the divine Principle of his being,  and of every thought and act leading to good. His pur-  pose must be right, though his power is temporarily lim- [10]  ited. Perfection, the goal of existence, is not won in a  moment; and regeneration leading thereto is gradual,  for it culminates in the fulfilment of this divine rule in  Science: \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father  which is in heaven is perfect.\" [15]    The last degree of regeneration rises into the rest of  perpetual, spiritual, individual existence. The first  feeble fluttering of mortals Christward are infantile  and more or less imperfect. The new-born Christian  Scientist must mature, and work out his own salvation. [20]  Spirit and flesh antagonize. Temptation, that mist of  mortal mind which seems to be matter and the environ-  ment of mortals, suggests pleasure and pain in matter;  and, so long as this temptation lasts, the warfare is not  ended and the mortal is not regenerated. The pleas- [25]  ures--more than the pains--of sense, retard regenera-  tion; for pain compels human consciousness to escape  from sense into the immortality and harmony of Soul.  Disease in error, more than ease in it, tends to destroy  error: the sick often are thereby led to Christ, Truth, [30]  and to learn their way out of both sickness and sin.
