He says:--\"About three hours after the sun  went down, I called to my men to come and take their coffee and supper  which was ready for them at my fire; and after supper, three of them  returned before their comrades to their own fireside and lay down.... In  a few minutes an ox came out by the gate of the kraal and walked round  the back of it. Hendrick got up and drove him again and then went back  to his fireside and lay down. Hendrick and Ruyter lay on one side of the  fire under one blanket and John Stofolus lay on the other.... Suddenly  the appalling and murderous voice of an angry bloodthirsty lion, within  a few yards of us, burst upon my ear, followed by the shrieking of the  Hottentots. Again and again the murderous roar of the attack was  repeated. We heard John and Ruyter shriek, 'the Lion! the Lion!...' Next  instant John Stofolus rushed into the midst of us almost speechless with  fear and terror, and eyes bursting from their sockets, and shrieked out,  'the lion! the lion! He has got Hendrick, he dragged him away from the  fire beside me. I struck him with the burning brands upon his head, but  he would not let go his hold. Hendrick is dead! O God! Hendrick is dead!  Let us take fire and seek him....' It appeared that when the unfortunate  Hendrick rose to drive in the ox, the lion had watched him to his  fireside, and he had scarcely lain down, when the brute sprang upon him  and Ruyter (for both lay under one blanket) with his appalling murderous  roar, and roaring as he lay, grappled him with his fearful claws and  kept biting him on the breast and shoulder, all the while feeling for  his neck; having got hold of which, he at once dragged him away  backwards round the bush into the dense shade.... The next morning, just  as the day began to dawn we heard the lion dragging something up the  river side under cover of the bank. We drove the cattle out of the kraal  and then proceeded to inspect the scene of the night's awful tragedy. In  the hollow where the lion had lain, consuming his prey, we found one leg  of the unfortunate Hendrick, bitten off below the knee, the shoe still  on the foot, the grass and bushes were all stained with his blood, and  fragments of his pea-coat lay around. Hendrick was by far the best man I  had about my waggons ... his loss to us all was very serious.\"      A Lion Outwitted.    In the southern part of Africa, where the Hottentots live, lions were  very common, and the adventures of the inhabitants with them very  frequent. One evening a Hottentot saw that he was pursued by a lion. He  was very much alarmed, and devised the following means of escape. He  went to the edge of a precipice, and placed himself a little below it.  He then put his cloak and hat on a stick, and elevated them over his  head, giving them a gentle motion. The lion came crouching along, and,  mistaking the cloak and hat for the man, as the Hottentot intended he  should do, he sprang upon them with a swift leap, and, passing over the  head of the Hottentot, was plunged headlong down the precipice.      Old Instincts and new Opportunities.    In the \"Miscellany of Natural History,\" from which several of these  anecdotes are taken there is a story illustrating the way in which old  instincts will show themselves in the presence of new opportunities. On  the evening of the 20th October 1816, a lioness made her escape from a  travelling menagerie which was drawn up on the road-side, about seven  miles from the town of Salisbury. It was about eight o'clock, and quite  dark, and the Exeter mail was passing when the animal suddenly darted  forward, and springing at the throat of the off-leader, fastened the  talons of her fore-feet on each side of the neck, close to the horse's  head, while those of the hind-feet were forced into the chest. In this  situation she hung, while the blood streamed from the agonized creature,  as if a vein had been opened by a lancet. It may be easily supposed,  that the alarm excited by this encounter, was very great. Two inside  passengers instantly dashed out of the coach and fled to a house on the  road-side. The keeper of the caravan came, and immediately set a large  Newfoundland dog on the animal. The lioness, on finding herself seized  by the leg, quitted the horse, and turned upon the dog, which the  spectators expected would very soon become the victim of her fury; but  she was contented with giving him only a slight punishment, and on  hearing the voice of her keeper, retired under a neighbouring straw  rick, and gently allowed herself to be secured. \"This anecdote,\" says  the writer, \"is remarkably characteristic, the moment that the animal  found herself at liberty, and an object of prey presented itself, all  her original propensities, hitherto restrained, were instantly called  into action; but no sooner did the voice of her keeper reach her ears,  than the force of long habit prevailed, she became calm, and allowed  herself to be bound, and led again to her den.\"      The Tiger.    The tiger is one of the most beautiful, but at the same time one of the  most rapacious and destructive of the whole animal race. It is found in  the warm climates of the East, especially in India and Siam. It so much  resembles the cat, as almost to induce us to consider the latter a tiger  in miniature. It lurks generally near a fountain, or on the brink of a  river, to surprise such animals as come to quench their thirst; and like  the lion bounds upon its prey, easily making a spring of twenty feet and  upwards. When it has killed one animal it often attacks others,  swallowing their blood for which it has an insatiable thirst in large  draughts; for even when satisfied with food, it is not satiated with  slaughter. The tiger is said by some to prefer human flesh to that of  any other animal; and it is certain, that it does not, like many other  beasts of prey, shun the presence of man, but has been even known on  more than one occasion to spring upon a hunting party when seated at  their refreshment, and carry off one of the number, rushing through the  shrubs into the forest, and devouring the unfortunate victim at its  leisure. The strength as well as the agility of this animal is  remarkable; it carries off a deer with the greatest ease.    The tiger is ornamented with long streaks across its body. The ground  colour is yellow, very deep on the back, but growing lighter towards the  belly, where it softens to white, as it does also on the throat and the  inside of the legs. The bars which cross the body from the back to the  belly are of the most beautiful black, and the skin altogether is so  extremely fine and glossy, that it is much esteemed, and sold at a high  price in all the eastern countries, especially China. \"The colouring of  the tiger,\" says the Rev. J. G. Wood, \"is a good instance of the manner  in which animals are protected by the similarity of their external  appearance to the particular locality in which they reside. The stripes  on the tiger's skin so exactly assimilate with the long jungle grass  amongst which it lives, that it is impossible for unpractised eyes to  discern the animal at all, even when a considerable portion of its body  is exposed.\"      Ravages Committed by Tigers.    The ravages committed by tigers have often led to the organisation of  hunting parties formed with a view to exterminate the more aggressive of  the enemy. The following narrative of a tiger excursion at Doongal is  from the \"East India Government Gazette.\"    \"There were five tigers killed by the party, besides one bear killed,  and another wounded; a wolf, a hyA|na, a panther, a leopard, and some  immense rock and cobra capella snakes. Among the occurrences during the  excursion, some were of a peculiar and pathetic nature. The first  happened to a poor Bunnia, or dealer, of the village of Doongal, who had  been to the city of Hydrabad, to collect some money, and who was  returning, after having gathered together a small sum, when on the way,  a little beyond the cantonment of Secunderabad, he saw an armed PA|on  seated, and apparently a traveller in the same direction. After mutual  inquiries, the PA|on told the Bunnia he was going to the same place; and,  as the Bunnia was glad to have somebody to accompany him, he gave him a  part of his victuals; and, on their way, they mutually related their  histories. The Bunnia innocently mentioned the object of his visit to  the city, and the fact of his returning with the money he had collected;  this immediately raised the avarice of the PA|on, who decided in his mind  to kill the poor Bunnia in a suitable place, and strip him of his money.  They proceeded together, with this design in the mind of the PA|on, until  they came to a place where the ravages of the tiger were notorious, and  he prepared to kill the Bunnia; and while he was struggling with him,  and in the act of drawing his sword to slay him, a tiger sprang upon the  PA|on, and carried him off, leaving his shield and sword, which the  Bunnia carried to Doongal, as trophies of retributive justice in his  favour. The next victim was the wife of a Bunjarra. They were resting  under a tree, when a tiger sprang up, and seized the woman by the head.  The husband, from mere impulse to save his wife, held her by the legs;  and a struggle ensued between the tiger pulling her by the head, and the  man by the legs, until the issue, which could not be doubted, when the  tiger carried off the woman. The man seemed to be rather partial to his  wife, and devoted himself to revenge her death,--forsook his cattle and  property,--resigned them to his brother, and offered his services to be  of the tiger-killing party, and strayed about the jungles, until he was  heard of no more.\"    \"A camel driver, who had been just married, was bringing home his bride,  when a tiger followed, and kept them in view a great part of the road,  for an opportunity to seize one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3796"],[0,"Rilla of Ingleside (#15)"],[1,"tonight, Susan?\"    A baby by day was dreadful enough; a baby by night was unthinkable.    \"Set the basket on a chair by your bed and keep it covered. You will  have to feed it once or twice in the night, so you would better take  the oil heater upstairs. If you cannot manage it call me and I will go,  doctor or no doctor.\"    \"But, Susan, if it cries?\"    The baby, however, did not cry. It was surprisingly good--perhaps  because its poor little stomach was filled with proper food. It slept  most of the night but Rilla did not. She was afraid to go to sleep for  fear something would happen to the baby. She prepared its three o'clock  ration with a grim determination that she would not call Susan. Oh, was  she dreaming? Was it really she, Rilla Blythe, who had got into this  absurd predicament? She did not care if the Germans were near  Paris--she did not care if they were in Paris--if only the baby  wouldn't cry or choke or smother or have convulsions. Babies did have  convulsions, didn't they? Oh, why had she forgotten to ask Susan what  she must do if the baby had convulsions? She reflected rather bitterly  that father was very considerate of mother's and Susan's health, but  what about hers? Did he think she could continue to exist if she never  got any sleep? But she was not going to back down now--not she. She  would look after this detestable little animal if it killed her. She  would get a book on baby hygiene and be beholden to nobody. She would  never go to father for advice--she wouldn't bother mother--and she  would only condescend to Susan in dire extremity. They would all see!    Thus it came about that Mrs. Blythe, when she returned home two nights  later and asked Susan where Rilla was, was electrified by Susan's  composed reply.    \"She's upstairs, Mrs. Dr. dear, putting her baby to bed.\"        CHAPTER VIII    RILLA DECIDES    Families and individuals alike soon become used to new conditions and  accept them unquestioningly. By the time a week had elapsed it seemed  as it the Anderson baby had always been at Ingleside. After the first  three distracted nights Rilla began to sleep again, waking  automatically to attend to her charge on schedule time. She bathed and  fed and dressed it as skilfully as if she had been doing it all her  life. She liked neither her job nor the baby any the better; she still  handled it as gingerly as if it were some kind of a small lizard, and a  breakable lizard at that; but she did her work thoroughly and there was  not a cleaner, better-cared-for infant in Glen St. Mary. She even took  to weighing the creature every day and jotting the result down in her  diary; but sometimes she asked herself pathetically why unkind destiny  had ever led her down the Anderson lane on that fatal day. Shirley,  Nan, and Di did not tease her as much as she had expected. They all  seemed rather stunned by the mere fact of Rilla adopting a war-baby;  perhaps, too, the doctor had issued instructions. Walter, of course,  never had teased her over anything; one day he told her she was a brick.    \"It took more courage for you to tackle that five pounds of new infant,  Rilla-my-Rilla, than it would be for Jem to face a mile of Germans. I  wish I had half your pluck,\" he said ruefully.    Rilla was very proud of Walter's approval; nevertheless, she wrote  gloomily in her diary that night:--    \"I wish I could like the baby a little bit. It would make things  easier. But I don't. I've heard people say that when you took care of a  baby you got fond of it--but you don't--I don't, anyway. And it's a  nuisance--it interferes with everything. It just ties me down--and now  of all times when I'm trying to get the Junior Reds started. And I  couldn't go to Alice Clow's party last night and I was just dying to.  Of course father isn't really unreasonable and I can always get an hour  or two off in the evening when it's necessary; but I knew he wouldn't  stand for my being out half the night and leaving Susan or mother to  see to the baby. I suppose it was just as well, because the thing did  take colic--or something--about one o'clock. It didn't kick or stiffen  out, so I knew that, according to Morgan, it wasn't crying for temper;  and it wasn't hungry and no pins were sticking in it. It screamed till  it was black in the face; I got up and heated water and put the  hot-water bottle on its stomach, and it howled worse than ever and drew  up its poor wee thin legs. I was afraid I had burnt it but I don't  believe I did. Then I walked the floor with it although 'Morgan on  Infants' says that should never be done. I walked miles, and oh, I was  so tired and discouraged and mad--yes, I was. I could have shaken the  creature if it had been big enough to shake, but it wasn't. Father was  out on a case, and mother had had a headache and Susan is squiffy  because when she and Morgan differ I insist upon going by what Morgan  says, so I was determined I wouldn't call her unless I had to.    \"Finally, Miss Oliver came in. She has rooms with Nan now, not me, all  because of the baby, and I am broken-hearted about it. I miss our long  talks after we went to bed, so much. It was the only time I ever had  her to myself. I hated to think the baby's yells had wakened her up,  for she has so much to bear now. Mr. Grant is at Valcartier, too, and  Miss Oliver feels it dreadfully, though she is splendid about it. She  thinks he will never come back and her eyes just break my heart--they  are so tragic. She said it wasn't the baby that woke her--she hadn't  been able to sleep because the Germans are so near Paris; she took the  little wretch and laid it flat on its stomach across her knee and  thumped its back gently a few times, and it stopped shrieking and went  right off to sleep and slept like a lamb the rest of the night. I  didn't--I was too worn out.    \"I'm having a perfectly dreadful time getting the Junior Reds started.  I succeeded in getting Betty Mead as president, and I am secretary, but  they put Jen Vickers in as treasurer and I despise her. She is the sort  of girl who calls any clever, handsome, or distinguished people she  knows slightly by their first names--behind their backs. And she is sly  and two-faced. Una doesn't mind, of course. She is willing to do  anything that comes to hand and never minds whether she has an office  or not. She is just a perfect angel, while I am only angelic in spots  and demonic in other spots. I wish Walter would take a fancy to her,  but he never seems to think about her in that way, although I heard him  say once she was like a tea rose. She is too. And she gets imposed  upon, just because she is so sweet and willing; but I don't allow  people to impose on Rilla Blythe and 'that you may tie to,' as Susan  says.    \"Just as I expected, Olive was determined we should have lunch served  at our meetings. We had a battle royal over it. The majority was  against eats and now the minority is sulking. Irene Howard was on the  eats side and she has been very cool to me ever since and it makes me  feel miserable. I wonder if mother and Mrs. Elliott have problems in  the Senior Society too. I suppose they have, but they just go on calmly  in spite of everything. I go on--but not calmly--I rage and cry--but I  do it all in private and blow off steam in this diary; and when it's  over I vow I'll show them. I never sulk. I detest people who sulk.  Anyhow, we've got the society started and we're to meet once a week,  and we're all going to learn to knit.    \"Shirley and I went down to the station again to try to induce Dog  Monday to come home but we failed. All the family have tried and  failed. Three days after Jem had gone Walter went down and brought  Monday home by main force in the buggy and shut him up for three days.  Then Monday went on a hunger strike and howled like a Banshee night and  day. We had to let him out or he would have starved to death.    \"So we have decided to let him alone and father has arranged with the  butcher near the station to feed him with bones and scraps. Besides,  one of us goes down nearly every day to take him something. He just  lies curled up in the shipping-shed, and every time a train comes in he  will rush over to the platform, wagging his tail expectantly, and tear  around to every one who comes off the train. And then, when the train  goes and he realizes that Jem has not come, he creeps dejectedly back  to his shed, with his disappointed eyes, and lies down patiently to  wait for the next train. Mr. Gray, the station master, says there are  times when he can hardly help crying from sheer sympathy. One day some  boys threw stones at Monday and old Johnny Mead, who never was known to  take notice of anything before, snatched up a meat axe in the butcher's  shop and chased them through the village. Nobody has molested Monday  since.    \"Kenneth Ford has gone back to Toronto. He came up two evenings ago to  say good-bye. I wasn't home--some clothes had to be made for the baby  and Mrs. Meredith offered to help me, so I was over at the manse, and I  didn't see Kenneth. Not that it matters; he told Nan to say good-bye to  Spider for him and tell me not to forget him wholly in my absorbing  maternal duties. If he could leave such a frivolous, insulting message  as that for me it shows plainly that our beautiful hour on the  sandshore meant nothing to him and I am not going to think about him or  it again.    \"Fred Arnold was at the manse and walked home with me. He is the new  Methodist minister's son and very nice and clever, and would be quite  handsome if it were not for his nose. It is a really dreadful nose.  When he talks of commonplace things it does not matter so much, but  when he talks of poetry and ideals the contrast between his nose and  his conversation is too much for me and I want to shriek with laughter.  It is really not fair, because everything he said was perfectly  charming and if somebody like Kenneth had said it"]]]
