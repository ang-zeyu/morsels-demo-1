A little more than a month later they mature into  butterflies which are Ajax, the summer form.    In a similar way the Telamonides or late spring butterflies lay eggs  soon after they appear, also upon papaw leaves, and these eggs in  about a month mature into Ajax, the summer form.    So we have Ajax, the summer form, developing directly from both the  early spring or Marcellus and the late spring or Telamonides  butterflies.    These Ajax butterflies in their turn lay eggs for caterpillar young.  These soon mature into a brood of butterflies which are of this same  Ajax form. There may be successive broods through the summer,  practically all of them being this same Ajax summer form.    The last brood of caterpillars, however, change to chrysalids which do  not disclose the butterflies until the following spring. And then the  first that come out are the Marcellus form and the last the  Telamonides form. So we may have these two forms maturing from the  same brood of autumn caterpillars.    This seems a sufficiently complicated life-history to suit the most  persistent solver of puzzle problems, but there is an additional  factor which adds much to the possible confusion of the broods. In  each brood of caterpillars from the earliest to the latest there are a  certain number of chrysalids which remain dormant through the  remainder of the season and the following winter, maturing into  butterflies the next spring. Consequently at the end of every winter  there are a miscellaneous lot of chrysalids which represent every  brood of caterpillars that lived the previous season, and all of these  develop into either Marcellus or Telamonides butterflies.    Such a condition of affairs certainly represents what an old New  Englander would be likely to call a \"mixed-up mess,\" and it is  difficult for science to find rhyme or reason to explain it. It speaks  eloquently for the perseverance of W. H. Edwards that he was able with  infinite patience through years of study and experiment to untangle  this intricate web of butterfly existence.    While the preferred food plant of this species is papaw, the  caterpillars are also known to feed upon the spice bush and upland  huckleberry. When full grown these caterpillars are about two inches  long and of a general pea-green color, banded transversely with yellow  and black, and having an especially conspicuous band of this sort on  the third ring behind the head. The scent organs are protruded when  the larva is disturbed and emit an offensive odor. The chrysalids are  green or brown according to the surroundings.    The Zebra Swallowtail is a southern butterfly found as far west as  Texas and the Rocky Mountains and having its northern limits in a zone  ranging approximately from Massachusetts to Nebraska. It is especially  abundant in the Southern states east of the Mississippi River.    Mr. S. F. Denton found this species abundant in southern Ohio where  the females laid their eggs upon the small papaw bushes. They selected  the leaves of these bushes for sleeping quarters, \"clinging to the  under side of the leaves where early in the morning they might be  taken with the fingers.\"      _Other Swallowtails_    Several other Swallowtail butterflies are found within the limits of  the United States, especially in the Far West and along the southern  boundaries. Some of these occasionally migrate east or north so that  they are collected in the Central states. Thus _Papilio daunus_, _P.  oregonia_, and _P. zolicoan_ are all found in the \"List of Nebraska  Butterflies,\" published by Mr. H. G. Barber, and the same species have  been taken in other states in or near the Mississippi Valley. These  and various others are described and pictured in Dr. Holland's  excellent \"Butterfly Book.\"      _Synopsis of the Swallowtails_    _Tiger Swallowtail_: _Yellow form_ (_Papilio glaucus turnus_).

THE WHITES, ORANGE-TIPS, AND YELLOWS    FAMILY _Pieridae_      The most familiar and abundant American butterflies are classified  together under the family name _Pieridae_, or the Pierids. Three  groups or tribes of them are popularly known as the Whites, the  Orange-tips, and the Yellows. Our two commonest butterflies, the White  or Imported Cabbage Butterfly and the Sulphur Yellow Butterfly, are  typical representatives of this family. Most of the rest, like these,  are of moderate size with rounded wings which are more or less marked  with black. There are six well-developed legs and the caterpillars of  practically all the species are cylindrical greenish worms which under  a lens are seen to be covered with short hairs. When the caterpillars  are ready to change to chrysalids they spin a web of silk upon the  supporting surface and just back of it, a loop of silk that serves to  hold the chrysalis in place and keep it from swaying back and forth.  The chrysalids are characterized by having a pointed projection on the  front of the head, the rest of the body being more or less angular.    Notwithstanding their close general resemblance to their food plants,  the caterpillars of this family suffer from attack by various enemies.  Birds find many of them, not only eating them themselves but also  using them freely for feeding the nestlings. Parasitic insects also  take a heavy toll from these caterpillars. This attack of enemies is  doubtless a chief reason why many of the common species are not much  more destructive.      THE TRIBE OF THE WHITES    Three white butterflies of approximately the same size are found  widely distributed over the United States. The most abundant species  is the White or Imported Cabbage butterfly. The next in abundance is  probably the Checkered White, and the rarest in most localities is the  Gray-veined White which is a northern form.       =The White or Imported Cabbage Butterfly=    _Pieris rapae_    There is probably no butterfly which one can generally find so easily  in its early stages as the White or Imported Cabbage butterfly which  is found practically wherever cabbages are grown and is generally so  abundant that caterpillars and chrysalids are readily discovered. In  the Northern states the insect passes through the winter within the  chrysalis, coming forth rather early in spring as the familiar white  butterfly with black dots upon the wings and blackish front angles of  the fore wings. (_See plates, pages 64-65 and 81._)    The butterflies that thus appear in spring flit freely about over  fields, meadows, and gardens, sipping the nectar of various early  flowers through their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3708"],[0,"An Introduction to Chemical Science (#15)"],[1,"other end into an open  receptacle for collecting the distilled water. Into the other  perforations lead short tubes,-- the one for water to flow into  the large tube from a jet; the other, for the same to flow out.  This condenses the steam by circulating cold water around it. The  apparatus is called a Liebig's condenser. Put water into the  flask, boil it, and notice the condensed liquid. It is  comparatively pure water; for most of the substances in solution  have a higher boiling-point than water, and are left behind when  it is vaporized.    (Fig. 32a.)    136. Test.    Experiment 81.--Test the purity of distilled water by slowly  evaporating a few drops on Pt foil in a room free from dust.  There should be no spot or residue left on the foil. Test in the  same way undistilled water. 137. Water exists in Three States,--  solid, liquid, and vaporous. It freezes at 0 degrees, suddenly  expanding considerably as it passes into the solid state. It  boils, i.e. overcomes atmospheric pressure and is vaporized, at  100 degrees (760 mm pressure). If the pressure is greater, the  boiling-point is raised, i.e. it takes a higher temperature to  overcome a greater pressure. If there be less pressure, as on a  mountain, the boiling-point is lowered below 100 degrees. Salts  dissolved in water raise its boiling-point, and lower its  freezing-point to an extent depending on the kind and quantity of  the salt. Water, however, evaporates at all temperatures, even  from ice.    Pure water has no taste or smell, and, in small quantities, no  color. It is rarely if ever found on the earth. What is taken up  by the air in evaporation is nearly pure; but when it falls as  rain or snow, impurities are absorbed from the atmosphere. Water  falling after a long rain, especially in the country, is  tolerably free from impurities. Some springs have also nearly  pure water; but to separate all foreign matter from it, water  must be distilled. Even then it is liable to contain traces of  ammonia, or some other substance which vaporizes at a lower  temperature than water.    138. Sea-Water.--The ocean is the ultimate source of all water.  From it and from lakes, rivers, and soils, water is taken into  the atmosphere, falls as rain or snow, and sinks into the ground,  reappearing in springs, or flowing off in brooks and rivers to  the ocean or inland seas. Ocean water must naturally contain  soluble salts; and many salts which are not soluble in pure water  are dissolved in sea-water. In fact, there is a probability that  all elements exist to some extent in sea-water, but many of them  in extremely minute quantities. Sodium and magnesium salts are  the two most abundant, and the bitter taste is due to MgSO4 and  MgCl2. A liter of sea- water, nearly 1000 g., holds over 37 g. of  various salts, 29 of which are NaCl. See Hard Water.    139. River Water.--River water holds fewer salts, but has a great  deal of organic matter, living and dead, derived from the regions  through which it flows. To render this harmless for drinking,  such water should be boiled, or filtered through unglazed  porcelain. Carbon filters are now thought to possess but little  virtue for separating harmful germs.    140. Spring Water.--The water of springs varies as widely in  composition as do the rocks whence it bubbles forth. Sulphur  springs contain much H2S; many geysers hold SiO2 in solution;  chalybeate waters have compounds of Fe; others have Na2SO4, MgSO4  NaCl, etc.    CHAPTER XXIX.    THE CHEMISTRY OF FLAME.    141. Candle Flame.    Experiment 82.--Examine a candle flame, holding a dark object  behind it. Note three distinct portions: (1) a colorless interior  about the wick, (2) a yellow light-giving portion beyond that,  (3) a thin blue envelope outside of all, and scarcely  discernible. Hold a small stick across the flame so that it may  lie in all three parts, and observe that no combustion takes  place in the inner portion.    142. Explanation.--A candle of paraffine, or tallow, is chiefly  composed of compounds of C and H, in the solid state. The burning  wick melts the solid; the liquid is then drawn up by the wick  till the heat vaporizes and decomposes it, and O of the air comes  in contact with the outer heated portion of gas, and burns it  completely. Air tends to penetrate the whole body of the flame,  but only N can pass through uncombined, for the O that is left  after combustion in the outer portion seizes upon the compounds  of C and H in the next, or yellow, part. There is not enough O  here for complete combustion; at this temperature H burns before  C, and the latter is set free. In that state it is of course a  solid. Now an incandescent solid, or one glowing with heat, gives  light, while the combustion of a gas gives scarcely any light,  though it may produce great heat. While C in the middle flame is  glowing, during the moment of its dissociation from H, it gives  light. In the outer flame the temperature is high enough to burn  entirely the gaseous compounds of C and H together, so that no  solid C is set free, and hence no light is given except the faint  blue. No combustion takes place in the inner blue cone, because  no O reaches there.    By packing a wick into a cylindrical tin cup 5 or 10 cm high and  4 cm in diameter, containing alcohol, and lighting it, gunpowder  can be held in the middle of the flame in a def. spoon, without  burning. This shows the low temperature of that portion. Burning  P will also be extinguished, thus showing the exclusion of O.    143. Bunsen Flame.    Experiment 83.--Examine a Bunsen burner. Unscrew the top, and  note the orifices for the admission of gas and of air. Make a  drawing. Replace the parts; then light the gas at the top,  opening the air-holes at the base. Notice that the flame burns  with very little color. Try to distinguish the three parts, as in  the candle flame. These parts can best be seen by allowing direct  sunlight to fall on the flame and observing its shadow on a white  ground. Make a drawing of the flame. Hold across it a Pt wire and  note at what part the wire glows most. Also press down on the  flame for an instant with a cardboard or piece of paper; remove  before it takes fire, and notice the charred circle. Put the end  of a match into the blue cone, and note that it does not burn.  Put the end of a Pt wire into this blue cone, and observe that it  glows when near the top of the cone. What do these experiments  show? Ascertain whether this inner portion contains a combustible  material, by holding in it one end of a small d.t., and trying to  ignite any gas escaping at the other end. It should burn. This  shows that no combustion takes place in the interior of the  flame, because sufficient free O is not present.    Next, close the air-holes, and note that the flame is yellow and  gives much light. From this we infer the presence of solid  particles in an incandescent state. But these could not come from  the air. They must be C particles which have been set free from  the C and H compounds of the gas, just as in the candle flame.  The smoke that rises proves this. Hold an e.d. in the flame and  collect some C. Try the same with the air-holes open. 144. Light  and Heat of Flame.--Which of the two flames is hotter, the one  with the air-holes open, or that with them closed? Evidently the  former; for air is drawn in and mixes with the gas as it rises in  the tube, and, on reaching the flame at the top, the two are well  mingled, and the gaseous compounds of C and H burn at so high a  temperature that solid C is not freed; hence there is little  light. On closing the air-holes, no O can reach the flame except  from the outside, and the heat is much less intense.    (Fig 33.)                               (Fig 34.)    The H burns first, and sets the C free, which, while glowing,  gives the light. This again illustrates the facts (1) that flame  is caused by burning gas; (2) that light is produced by  incandescent solids. Charcoal, coke, and anthracite coal burn  without flame, or with very little, because of the absence of  gases.    145. Temperature of Combustion.    Experiment 84.--Light a Bunsen flame, with the basal orifices  open, and hold over it a fine wire gauze. Notice that the flame  does not rise above the gauze. Extinguish the light, and try to  ignite the gas above the gauze, holding the latter within 5 or 6  cm of the burner tube. Notice that it does not burn below the  gauze (Fig. 33).    Gas and O are both present. Evidently, then, the only condition  wanting for combustion is a sufficiently high temperature. The  gauze cools the gas below its kindling- point.    This principle is made use of in the miner's lamp of Davy (Fig.  34). In coal mines a very inflammable gas, CH4, called fire-damp,  issues from the coal. If this collects in large quantities and  mixes with O of the air, a kindling-point is all that is needed  to make a violent explosion. An ordinary lamp would produce this,  but the gauze lamp prevents it; for, though the inside may be  filled with burning gas, CH4, the flame cannot communicate with  the outside.

Oxidizing and Reducing Flames.--The hottest part of a Bunsen  flame is just above the inner blue cone (b, Fig. 36). Evidently  there is more O at that point. If a reducing agent, i.e. a  substance which takes up O, be put into this part of the flame,  the latter will remove the O and appropriate it, forming an  oxide. Cu heated there would become copper oxide. This part is  called the oxidizing flame. The inner blue part of the Bunsen  flame is devoid of O. It ought to remove O from an oxidizing  agent, i.e. a substance which supplies O. If copper oxide be  heated there (a, Fig. 36) by means of a mouth blow-pipe (Fig.  35), the flame will appropriate the O and leave the copper. This  is called the reducing flame. Only the "]]]
