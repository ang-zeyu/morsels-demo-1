[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3008"],[0,"The Jargon File, Version 4.2.2, 20 Aug 2000 (#15)"],[1,"character has one or more names -- some     formal, some concise, some silly. Common jargon names for ASCII     characters are collected here. See also individual entries for     [632]bang, [633]excl, [634]open, [635]ques, [636]semi, [637]shriek,     [638]splat, [639]twiddle, and [640]Yu-Shiang Whole Fish.       This list derives from revision 2.3 of the Usenet ASCII pronunciation     guide. Single characters are listed in ASCII order; character pairs     are sorted in by first member. For each character, common names are     given in rough order of popularity, followed by names that are     reported but rarely seen; official ANSI/CCITT names are surrounded by     brokets: <>. Square brackets mark the particularly silly names     introduced by [641]INTERCAL. The abbreviations \"l/r\" and \"o/c\" stand     for left/right and \"open/close\" respectively. Ordinary parentheticals     provide some usage information.       !            Common: [642]bang; pling; excl; shriek; ball-bat; <exclamation            mark>.

Rare: approx;            wiggle; swung dash; enyay; [sqiggle (sic)].       The pronunciation of # as `pound' is common in the U.S. but a bad     idea; [650]Commonwealth Hackish has its own, rather more apposite use     of `pound sign' (confusingly, on British keyboards the pound graphic     happens to replace #; thus Britishers sometimes call # on a U.S.-ASCII     keyboard `pound', compounding the American error). The U.S. usage     derives from an old-fashioned commercial practice of using a # suffix     to tag pound weights on bills of lading. The character is usually     pronounced `hash' outside the U.S. There are more culture wars over     the correct pronunciation of this character than any other, which has     led to the [651]ha ha only serious suggestion that it be pronounced     `shibboleth' (see Judges 12:6 in an Old Testament or Tanakh).       The `uparrow' name for circumflex and `leftarrow' name for underline     are historical relics from archaic ASCII (the 1963 version), which had     these graphics in those character positions rather than the modern     punctuation characters.       The `swung dash' or `approximation' sign is not quite the same as     tilde in typeset material but the ASCII tilde serves for both (compare     [652]angle brackets).       Some other common usages cause odd overlaps. The #, $, >, and &     characters, for example, are all pronounced \"hex\" in different     communities because various assemblers use them as a prefix tag for     hexadecimal constants (in particular, # in many assembler-programming     cultures, $ in the 6502 world, > at Texas Instruments, and & on the     BBC Micro, Sinclair, and some Z80 machines). See also [653]splat.       The inability of ASCII text to correctly represent any of the world's     other major languages makes the designers' choice of 7 bits look more     and more like a serious [654]misfeature as the use of international     networks continues to increase (see [655]software rot). Hardware and     software from the U.S. still tends to embody the assumption that ASCII     is the universal character set and that characters have 7 bits; this     is a major irritant to people who want to use a character set suited     to their own languages. Perversely, though, efforts to solve this     problem by proliferating `national' character sets produce an     evolutionary pressure to use a smaller subset common to all those in     use.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:ASCII art, Next:[656]ASCIIbetical order, Previous:[657]ASCII,     Up:[658]= A =       ASCII art n.

Currey says, upon examining the fructification,         he was surprised to find that, although in its external         characters it was a perfect _Hydnum_, it bore the fruit of a         _Tremella_. If one of the teeth be examined with the         microscope, it will be seen to consist of threads bearing         four-lobed sporophores, and spores exactly similar to         _Tremella_. It will thus be seen, he adds, that the plant         is exactly intermediate between _Hydnei_ and _Tremellini_,         forming, as it were, a stepping-stone from one to the other.

It would hardly avail to  enter too minutely into details, yet sufficient should be attempted to  enable the reader to comprehend the value and relations of the  different groups into which fungi are divided. The arrangement  generally adopted is based upon the \"Systema Mycologicum\" of Fries, as  modified to meet the requirements of more recent microscopical  researches by Berkeley in his \"Introduction,\"[A] and adopted in  Lindley's \"Vegetable Kingdom.\" Another arrangement was proposed by  Professor de Bary,[B] but it has never met with general acceptance.    In the arrangement to which we have alluded, all fungi are divided  into two primary sections, having reference to the mode in which the  fructification is produced. In one section, the spores (which occupy  nearly the same position, and perform similar functions, to the seeds  of higher plants) are naked; that is, they are produced on spicules,  and are not enclosed in cysts or capsules. This section is called  SPORIFERA, or spore-bearing, because, by general consent, the term  _spore_ is limited in fungi to such germ-cells as are not produced in  cysts. The second section is termed SPORIDIIFERA, or sporidia-bearing,  because in like manner the term _sporidia_ is limited to such  germ-cells as are produced in cells or cysts. These cysts are  respectively known as _sporangia_, and _asci_ or _thecae_. The true  meaning and value of these divisions will be better comprehended when  we have detailed the characters of the families composing these two  divisions.    First, then, the section SPORIFERA contains four families, in two of  which a hymenium is present, and in two there is no proper hymenium.  The term _hymenium_ is employed to represent a more or less expanded  surface, on which the fructification is produced, and is, in fact, the  fruit-bearing surface. When no such surface is present, the fruit is  borne on threads, proceeding direct from the root-like filaments of  the mycelium, or an intermediate kind of cushion or stroma. The two  families in which an hymenium is present are called _Hymenomycetes_  and _Gasteromycetes_. In the former, the hymenium is exposed; in the  latter, it is at first enclosed. We must examine each of these  separately.    The common mushroom may be accepted, by way of illustration, as a type  of the family _Hymenomycetes_, in which the hymenium is exposed, and  is, in fact, the most noticeable feature in the family from which its  name is derived. The pileus or cap bears on its under surface  radiating plates or gills, consisting of the hymenium, over which are  thickly scattered the basidia, each surmounted by four spicules,"]]]
