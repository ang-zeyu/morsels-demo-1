During the process of dyeing, the straw should be turned and moved  about in the boiling water to insure an even color. The straw should  never be boiled too long, or it will be cooked and become tender  and weak. After the straw has taken on the shade desired, it is  removed from the can and thrown on the ground. When the bundles are  cool enough to be handled, they are untied and the straws spread out  to dry, preferably in the shade. After it is thoroughly dried the  material is rebundled and thus kept for weaving.    Before weaving, the straws are flattened by drawing each one separately  between the edge of the knife and the heel of the weaver's foot or  the sole of the chinela. Damp days are best for this process. Weaving  is done under the house or under trees. Evenings and nights are  most suitable for this work on account of the dampness of the  atmosphere. The embroidered mats of Bohol are decorated with split  straws.    The mats of Bohol are bought by traders who exchange cloth and other  goods for them. These men carry them to the towns of Bohol which do  not produce mats, and to other islands, where they sell or exchange  them at a good profit. When once the supply of mats on hand has been  bought up in a mat producing town, several months elapse before the  market there is replenished by a new supply. After completing a mat,  the weaver has no immediate desire to begin another. It is quite  probable that the output of mats could be increased considerably  if the market and the price were better. It is estimated that the  weavers earn not more than 20 centavos per day at the industry.        Other Tikug Mats.    Tikug also grows in large quantities in Leyte. Its chief use there  is in the weaving of matting on a crude loom, an adaptation of the  common textile loom.    Tikug is apparently generally used throughout Surigao in making  mats. The best mats of this region come from the upper Agusan and the  island of Dinagat. They are usually made for local consumption, though  the people of Dinagat exchange their mats with Bohol traders. The  sedge grows in great abundance in the lake of Talacogon near the town  of the same name in Agusan.    Tikug is also found in many parts of the Moro Province. It abounds  in the swamp lands of the Lanao region, from which mats are exported  via Iligan. If it is to be colored, the straws are soaked in water  for about two days, after which they are cooked in the boiling  dye. Bleached straw is prepared by exposing it to the sun, after  which the material is polished and flattened at the same time by  rubbing the stalks with ashes, between the fingers.        The Cultivation of Tikug.    The question of the cultivation of tikug is one of considerable  importance. It is a well known fact that the finest Leghorn hat  straw is produced in Italy by sewing wheat closely and reaping the  straw before the grain ripens. The best mat straws of China and  Japan are produced from cultivated sedges. The Bureau of Education  is therefore encouraging experiments in the cultivation of tikug,  but as yet these have not been extensive enough to determine whether  the sedge can be propagated for industrial purposes. There are no  data as to cost. A quantity of seed was procured and forwarded to  various parts of the Islands in which tikug had not been reported  as growing. These were sent out to various persons with the idea of  determining (1) soils suitable to the plant, (2) whether it could be  cultivated in the rice paddies between harvest and planting, (3) how  closely the seeds should be planted, (4) how old the plants should be  at harvest. [33] No results have as yet been obtained from the seeds  so sent out. Fair results, however, have been realized in Samar, where  approximately 5,000 stalks were grown to the square foot in very rich  soil fertilized with manure secured from the military stables. The  straws obtained were 3 meters long. It was found that the thicker  the seeds are planted the finer and longer are the straws obtained.    Reports differ as to whether tikug should be considered a pest or  not. In Leyte it is stated that it grows in the rice fields along with  the rice crop and appreciably diminishes the crop. There it is a weed  pest; in Samar it is not so considered. In Bohol one teacher states  that the plant is not a pest as it will not grow in dry localities,  and hence does not interfere with crops. Where it is found in the  rice paddies, a covering of earth will easily destroy it. It does  not scatter quickly, for, while the roots will grow if transplanted,  the sedge is mostly propagated by seeds and these are distributed  principally by water and not by wind. No great chances are taken in  planting tikug. On the other hand, some teachers state that the seeds  are scattered by the wind and that the roots impede the plowing of  the fields.    It is probable that where the tikug obtains a good foothold on  irrigated rice land it proves a considerable annoyance to farmers;  but its growth as a pest can be regulated by plowing.        Tayoc-Tayoc.    This plant, F. diphylla, one of the most widely distributed of all  sedges, is found at all altitudes up to 2,000 meters throughout the  warm regions of the world. The stems may be smooth or hairy and the  leaves one-third to two-thirds as long as the stem. F. diphylla  is generally smaller than F. utilis. Its stem is only 2 mm. in  diameter. The flowers, densely clustered into spikelets, are generally  of two colors--straw and brown. They reach 1 cm. in length and 4 mm. in  diameter. Below the spikelet the stem has from 3 to 5 sides. The  roots are fibrous; underground stems may occur, but they are never  more than 2.5 cm. long.    This plant is known as tayoc-tayoc in Iloilo, Capiz, and Occidental  Negros. It is reported from Pampanga and is called \"tab-tabin\"  in Zambales.    The straw produced by tayoc-tayoc is much finer but considerably  stiffer than that from tikug, and cannot be considered so good an  industrial material. Nevertheless, it is used to some extent in the  production of hats and mats, especially in the provinces of Iloilo  and Capiz. In Dumalag, Capiz Province, hats are of considerable  importance. Mats of tayoc-tayoc are reported as made in Banate and  Janiuay, Iloilo Province, but this has not yet been verified.    As with tikug, seeds of tayoc-tayoc were obtained and distributed  among various provinces to determine whether the propagation of the  straw was practicable and if the cultivation of the plant would result  in a better material. As yet no definite results have been obtained.        A Rush Straw.    But one rush straw has been brought to the attention of the Bureau  of Education; it is the Japanese matting rush, Juncus effusus. This  species is distributed over a large part of the globe, being the  candle rush of Europe and the common plant of wet ground in the United  States. In Japan it is made into beautiful mattings, the handsomest  and most costly produced. The pith is also employed for lamp wicks,  and probably the \"timsim\" imported from China and used in oil lamps  in the Philippines is obtained from this plant. Juncus effusus has no  native name in the Philippines. It is found throughout the Mountain  Province and in the Apo region of Mindanao. It attains a height of  almost 2 meters where soil and moisture conditions are favorable. The  stalk is cylindrical and at the end tapers to a point. It is from 2  to 3 mm. in diameter. The flowers grow in a bunch on the side of the  stalk near the top and are light brown in color. At the present time  this rush is not utilized in the Philippines, though it is probable  that it can be used in the weaving of many articles. If split, a flat  straw is obtained by removing the pith.            EMBROIDERED MAT DESIGNS. [34]      It is better not to decorate a mat at all than to have the design ill  fitting. Design is the pleasing arrangement of all spaces unfilled  as well as filled. Decoration is for beauty wholly. If all the spaces  are not well arranged, the design is not beautiful. If the design is  startling or gaudy in color, it is not beautiful. If the arrangement of  colors is inharmonious, the design is not beautiful. All mats cannot  be in the same proportion and suitable for all designs. Plate LXV,  for instance, shows a long design; it requires a long mat, and would  not look well on a square one.    All mats here considered are about 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch in width of  straw. Some of the designs are used exactly as they are, counting  a straw for a square which represents a straw in the design; the  others are double in size and contain four times as many squares  in the weave as in the design. In such cases twice the count of the  design will always give the right number for the weave.    In circular mats the directions are given in inches. The sizes of  the mats should be taken into consideration, but a variance of a few  inches will not matter if that variance always makes the mat larger  rather than smaller. In these mats more is left to the judgment of  the weaver than in rectangular mats. Designs should never be crowded  on circular mats. Repeated groups should always be made exactly alike.    In the color notes, a series of colors set off by commas indicates  that each series may be used alone for the whole design. Often the  deep colors, especially No. 1, have been left out, as the effect of  a very dark color on a very light mat is often startling. Designs on  mats or hangings should not be more conspicuous than the mat itself,  but should rather present a complete and harmonious appearance when  both mat and design are considered as a whole.        Circular Mats.      Design A.    The straws of a circular mat cannot be counted and then divided  equally by numbers, as straws are continually added at irregular  intervals as the circumference is being reached.

I have seen a singer pull himself together, and with a tremendous effort  shout a high A in the thick register. His neck swelled out, his face  became blood-red, and altogether the \"performance\" was of an acrobatic  rather than of an artistic nature. The general public, of course, loudly  applauded, but people of taste and refinement shuddered. Such  exhibitions are, unfortunately, not rare. If this little book should  contribute, however remotely, to discourage them, it will not have been  written in vain.          APPENDIX TO THE THIRD EDITION      It has been suggested to me that the usefulness of my little book would  be enlarged if I were to add an appendix containing some application to  practical work of the physiological laws already explained. This I have  endeavoured to do in the following chapter, and I trust the simplicity  of the directions will enable the reader to carry out my instructions,  to vary them, and to enlarge upon them according to circumstances.      HINTS ON TEACHING.    One of the most important lessons taught us by the study of Vocal  Physiology is the correct method of breathing and of obtaining control  over the respiratory muscles. I will now give a few exercises for this  purpose.    Divest yourself of any article of clothing which at all interferes with  the freedom of the waist. Lie down flat on your back. Place one hand  lightly on the abdomen and the other upon the lower ribs. Inhale,  through the nostrils, slowly, deeply, and evenly, without interruption  or jerking. If this is done properly the abdomen will, gradually and  without any trembling movement, increase in size, and the lower ribs  will expand sideways, while the upper part of the chest and the  collar-bones remain undisturbed. Now hold the breath, _not_ by shutting  the glottis, but by keeping the midriff down and the chest walls  extended, and count four mentally, at the rate of sixty per minute. Then  let the breath go _suddenly_. The result of this will be a flying up of  the midriff, and a falling down of the ribs; in other words, there will  be a collapse of the lower part of the body. This collapse may not at  first be very distinct, as the extension has probably been insufficient;  but both will become more and more perfect as the result of continued  practice.    Let it be clearly understood: The _in_spiration is to be slow and deep,  the _ex_piration sudden and complete. In _in_spiration the abdomen and  the lower part of the chest expand, and in _ex_piration they collapse.    The time of holding the breath is not, at the outset, to exceed four  seconds, and the student must never, on any account, fatigue himself  with these exercises; they may, however, be frequently repeated at  intervals. It will be found by occasional trials upon the spirometer  that the breathing capacity increases with these exercises. The process  of abdominal respiration becomes easy and no longer requires constant  watchfulness, and the student will soon be able to carry it on, not only  lying down, but while he is standing or walking, though not at once with  the same ease. He must now, for a time, be careful to see that he has  the same physical sensations in breathing which he noticed while making  his first experiment when lying down; and he must exercise special care  when running, going upstairs, &c., and, of course, in speaking or  singing.    The criterion of correct inspiration is, as I have said before, an  increase of size of the abdomen and of the lower part of the chest.  Whoever draws in the abdomen and raises the upper part of the chest in  the act of filling his lungs does wrong.    Meanwhile, in continuing the breathing exercises, the time of holding  the breath may be increased at the rate of two seconds per week; so that  the student who, during the first fortnight, limited himself to four  seconds will, at the end of six weeks, hold his breath during twelve  seconds. I have, in some instances, with students of mine, gone as far  as twenty seconds; but I desire very earnestly to warn my readers to be  cautious and not to go to extremes. Nothing will be gained, but infinite  harm may ensue by over-doing these lung gymnastics, and persons at all  inclined to bleeding from the lungs should not undertake the exercises  at all, except with the sanction of their medical adviser, who will  limit the practice according to circumstances.    The second breathing exercise is the exact opposite of the first, and  consists in taking a rapid _in_spiration and making the _ex_piration  slow, even, uninterrupted and without jerking or trembling. My musical  readers will at once see the importance of this exercise for the purpose  of singing sustained tones and florid passages; but it would be quite  useless to attempt it before No. 1 has been sufficiently practised.    The third and last breathing exercise consists in taking the  _in_spiration as in No. 1, and the _ex_piration as in No. 2. After the  two preceding ones have been fully mastered this last is easy enough;  and the student who has persevered so far will now have overcome one of  the greatest difficulties of a vocalist, namely, the proper management  of the breath, an accomplishment which seems to become more and more  rare in our go-ahead times of electricity.    I feel that my description of these breathing exercises is far from  complete, and what is worse, that it may lead to misunderstandings, the  results of which will hereafter be laid to my charge. But writing,  however lucid and careful, can never take the place of _viva voce_  instruction; and I wish it to be distinctly understood that the  explanations here given are not by any means intended to supersede the  aid of a competent and painstaking teacher.    I will take leave of this part of my subject by warning my readers  against the mistake, which may be caused by a superficial perusal of  these pages, that it is the chief aim of the above breathing exercises  to enable the singer or speaker to cram as much air as possible into  the lungs. I have pointed out some of the evils which are likely to  arise from exaggerated breathing efforts; yet I wish to say again, most  emphatically, that it is quite possible to _overcrowd_ the lungs with  air. This is a matter of every-day occurrence, which is not, however, on  that account any the less reprehensible; for, as I have already  mentioned, it is sure to lead, sooner or later, to forcing and  inequality of voice, and to congestion of the vessels and tissues of the  throat and of the lungs.    Now we come to the question of the production and cultivation of the  voice, including the nature and the proper treatment of the registers.  In this connection I shall endeavour to explain a series of exercises  based upon physiological facts, which will enable the reader to strike  out a safe and direct path, avoiding much useless drudgery, and leading  to eminently satisfactory results. As it is not my object to supply a  singing manual, but simply to point out the way of treating the voice  upon scientific principles, I shall not attempt to deal separately with  the different classes of voices, or to go into minute details; but it  will rather be my aim to lay down general principles, leaving my readers  to carry them into practice, and to elaborate them according to  individual circumstances. It must also be borne in mind that the  exercises I am going to recommend will here be taken as they suggest  themselves, while passing in review the various parts which unitedly  form the mechanism of the human voice. Therefore, in the actual process  of training a voice, they will have to be taken in a different order  from that in which they are discussed here, in accordance with the  general plan of this book.    The movements of the pyramids with the vocal ligaments attached to them  are governed by two sets of muscles pulling them either together or away  from each other. These have been fully described under the names of the  \"Closing Muscles\" and the \"Opening Muscles;\" and the reader will at once  see the importance of devising a set of exercises which shall call these  opening and closing muscles into play, thereby making them powerful, and  bringing them under the control of the will.    This is, fortunately, a very simple matter; for all we have to do is to  sing a series of short tones, each tone to be followed by a short  inspiration. We have learnt that every time we strike a tone the vocal  ligaments are made to approximate; by so doing we therefore exercise the  closing muscles. Every time we take an inspiration the vocal ligaments  are separated; by so doing therefore we exercise the opening muscles. It  is plain from these explanations that, by practising in the manner just  indicated, we shall gain the same results in five minutes which it  would take us half an hour to obtain by singing sustained tones after  the usual method of teaching.    Let me now give as clear a description of the exercise as possible. Find  the pitch of your speaking voice, which we will say is _F_. Then sing  the following:--    [Illustration: musical notation    _o_  _o_  _o_  _o_  _ah_ _ah_ _ah_ _ah_  _ai_ _ai_ _ai_ _ai_    Strike the tone firmly and clearly, avoiding alike the _check_ of the  glottis and the _glide_ of the glottis. This is often a matter of great  difficulty, requiring much patience and perseverance on the part of the  teacher as well as on that of the student. The _glide_ of the glottis is  particularly hard to eradicate, and in many instances the case seems to  be hopeless. Do not, however, despair, but try this: Pronounce  vigorously the word \"Up.\" Then _whisper_, but still very vigorously and  distinctly, three times the vowel _u_, as you just had it in the word  \"up.\" Immediately afterwards _sing_ \"Ah.\" Thus--        UP!       _u_, _u_, _u_,     Ah.  (_spoken_)    (_whispered_)    (_sung_)    I recommend this device from extended personal"]]]
