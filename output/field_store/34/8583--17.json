This is true with respect to  intrinsic beauty only; for in many instances, utility comes in to cast the  balance on the side of the parallelogram: this figure for the doors and  windows of a dwelling-house, is preferred because of utility; and here we  find the beauty of utility prevailing over that of regularity and  uniformity.\"    Thus regularity and uniformity contribute to intrinsic beauty.    \"A parallelogram, again, depends for its beauty on the proportion [or  relation of quantity] of its sides. Its beauty is lost by a great  inequality of these sides: it is also lost by their approximating toward  equality; for proportion there degenerates into imperfect uniformity, and  the figure appears an unsuccessful attempt toward a square.\"    Thus proportion contributes to beauty.    \"An equilateral triangle yields not to a square in regularity nor in  uniformity of parts, and it is more simple. Its inferiority in beauty is  at least partly owing to inferiority of order in the position of its  parts: the sides of an equilateral triangle incline to each other in the  same angle, which is the most perfect order they are susceptible of; but  this order is obscure, and far from being so perfect as the parallelism of  the sides of a square.\"    Thus order contributes to the beauty of visible objects.    \"A mountain, it may be objected, is an agreeable object, without so much  as the appearance of regularity; and a chain of mountains is still more  agreeable, without being arranged in any order. But though regularity,  uniformity, and order, are causes of beauty, there are also other causes  of it, as color; and when we pass from small to great objects, and  consider grandeur instead of beauty, very little regularity is required.\"    It follows, from all that has been here said, and this has been shown by  Burke, that any rugged, any sudden projection, any sharp angle, is in the  highest degree contrary to the idea of beauty. Such projections and angles  are destitute of all the qualities which have just been  enumerated--simplicity, regularity, uniformity, proportion, order; and  conformably to the principles I have laid down in a previous chapter, they  can present only relations which are naturally disagreeable. This view is  corroborated by the fact, that all very sharp, broken, or angular objects,  were disagreeable to the boy couched by Cheselden, as they are to all eyes  of very nice sensibility.    Now, as angular forms give, to the sense of touch, sharpness, roughness,  or harshness, so do opposite forms give smoothness or fineness. Hence,  Burke makes smoothness his second characteristic of beauty, and that far  more truly than he makes littleness its first, for, as he observes,  \"smoothness is a quality so essential to beauty, that I do not now  recollect anything beautiful that is not smooth.\"    Such being really the case, I am bound to expose Knight's sophistry on  this point. \"This elegant author,\" says he, \"has expatiated upon the  gratifications of feeling smooth and undulating surfaces in general: but,  I believe, these gratifications have been confined to himself; and  probably to his own imagination acting through the medium of his favorite  system: for, except in the communication of the sexes, which affords no  general illustration, and ought therefore to be kept entirely out of the  question, I have never heard of any person being addicted to such  luxuries; though a feeling-board would certainly afford as cheap and  innocent a gratification, as either a smelling-bottle, a picture, or a  flute, provided it were capable of affording any gratification at all.\"    This is a good specimen of the kind of perverted reasoning, which  peculiarly distinguishes Knight.    A man affecting the character of philosopher, ought calmly to have  observed that, by young people before puberty, and, consequently, when  there is not the slightest sexual bias, smooth objects are generally found  to be agreeable, and rough or harsh ones to be the reverse. This would at  once have set him right upon this point.    If, to such a man, it should for a moment have appeared worth while to ask  why we do not make use of feeling-boards, as well as of smelling-bottles,  he ought to have sought the solution of his difficulty in the nature of  the senses; and then, with a trifle more of ability than Payne Knight  hereby shows himself to have possessed, he would have seen that smoothness  affords us as much pleasure as any smell, but that, as it would have been  always troublesome, and often impossible, to apply our fingers to smooth  surfaces, we generally receive the varied and incessant pleasure it  affords, by means of sight; that it is borne by light to the eye, as smell  is by the air; and that this is the reason why, except when contact is  indispensable, we have no need of anything in the way of a feeling-board.    But Knight says: \"Smoothness being properly a quality, perceivable only by  the touch, and applied metaphorically to the objects of the other senses,  we often apply it, very improperly, to those of vision; assigning  smoothness as a cause of visible beauty, to things which, though smooth to  the touch, cast the most sharp, harsh, and angular reflections of light  upon the eyes; and these reflections are all that the eye feels, or  naturally perceives.... Such are all objects of cut-glass or polished  metal; as may be seen by the manner in which painters imitate them: for,  as the imitations of painting extend only to the visible qualities of  bodies, they show those visible qualities fairly and impartially.... Yet  the imitative representation of such objects in painting is far less harsh  and dazzling than the effects of them in reality: for there are no  materials that a painter can employ, capable of expressing the sharpness  and brilliancy of those angular reflections of the collected and  condensed rays, which are emitted from the surfaces of polished metals.\"    It seems, to me, scarcely possible to find sophistry more worthless than  this, or rather a more contemptible quibble; for that which, availing  himself of our technicalities about light, he calls angularity, sharpness,  &c., has no analogy with disagreeable angularity of form. To produce the  brilliance and splendor which he calls angular, and describes as so  _offensive_, we polish crystalline and metallic bodies in the highest  degree!--we value precisely those which thus admit of greatest  splendor!--and, on that very account, the diamond (rightly or wrongly, is  not the question) is deemed the most valuable object on earth!    So much for those elements of beauty, in inanimate things, which fall  under the cognizance of our fundamental sense, or that of touch.    As to sight and its objects, it is true that, as this organ varies in  different persons, their taste is modified, with regard to colors. But the  preference of light and delicate colors to dark and glaring ones, is  almost universal among persons of sensibility.    Alison, indeed, ascribes the effects of all colors to association.  \"White,\" he says, \"as it is the color of day, is expressive to us of the  cheerfulness or gayety which the return of day brings: black, as the color  of darkness [night], is expressive of gloom and melancholy.\" And he adds:  \"Whether some colors may not of themselves produce agreeable sensations,  and others disagreeable sensations, I am not anxious to dispute.\" But  this is the very point into which Alison ought to have inquired. Nature  does nothing without foundation in the simplest principles; and this  foundation is not only anterior to, but is the cause of all association.    That, independent of any association, blackness is naturally disagreeable,  if not painful, is happily determined by the case of the boy restored to  sight by Cheselden, who tells us that the first time the boy saw a black  object, it gave him great uneasiness; and that, some time after, upon  accidentally seeing a negro-woman, he was struck with great horror at the  sight. This appears to be perfectly conclusive.    Knight indeed says: \"As to the uneasiness which the boy, couched by  Cheselden, felt at the first sight of a black object, it arose either from  the harshness of its outline, or from its appearing to act as a partial  extinguisher applied to his eyes, which, as every object that he saw,  seemed to touch them, would, of course, be its effect.\" It is highly  probable that black operates in both these ways; and it has therefore  natural effects, independent of all association.    As to sounds, Alison observes, that the cries of some animals are sublime,  as the roar of the lion, the scream of the eagle, &c.; and he thinks they  become so, because we associate them with the strength and ferocity of the  animals which utter them. By opposite associations, he accounts for the  beauty of the notes of birds. And he says, that there is a similar  sublimity or beauty, in the tones of the human voice, and that \"such  sounds are associated, in our imaginations, with the qualities of mind of  which they are in general expressive, and naturally produce in us the  conception of these qualities.\"    This writer endeavors to establish his views on this subject, by  observing, that \"grandeur or sublimity of sound, can no otherwise arise  from its loudness, than as that loudness excites an idea of power in the  sonorous object, or in some other associated with it in the mind: for a  child's drum, close to the ear, fills it with more real noise, than the  discharge of a cannon a mile off; and the rattling of a carriage in the  street, when faintly and indistinctly heard, has often been mistaken for  thunder at a distance. Yet no one ever imagined the beating of a child's  drum, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35413"],[0,"A Review of the Middle American Tree Frogs of the Genus Ptychohyla (#15)"],[1," groups that have been generically separated from _Hyla_. Of the  daughter genera in Middle America only _Plectrohyla_ has  stream-adapted tadpoles, but these large frogs are not closely related  to _Ptychohyla_. Stuart (1954:169) suggested that certain montane  species of _Hyla_ in lower Central America and _Hyla salvadorensis_ in  El Salvador may be related to _Ptychohyla_ or even congeneric. I have  had experience with most of these species in the field and believe  that Stuart was correct in his suggestion of relationships. The  species concerned are four red-eyed stream-breeding _Hyla_ in Costa  Rica--_H. alleei_, _H. legleri_, _H. rufioculis_, and _H. uranochroa_,  plus _Hyla salvadorensis_ in the mountains of El Salvador.  Morphologically all of the species are similar; _Hyla uranochroa_, _H.  legleri_, and _H. rufioculis_ have a lateral white stripe that is  expanded to form a spot beneath the eye, as in _Ptychohyla  schmidtorum_. The tadpoles of _Hyla rufioculis_ and _H. uranochroa_  have large funnel-shaped mouths and long slender tails like those of  _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_. Lips of the tadpoles of _H. legleri_ and _H.  salvadorensis_ are folded laterally, in this respect resembling those  of the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group. I do not know the tadpoles and  the breeding call of _Hyla alleei_. The breeding calls of _Hyla  rufioculis_ and _H. uranochroa_ consist of high melodious notes; the  calls of _H. legleri_ and _H. salvadorensis_ consist of series of  short notes that have the general characteristics of the call of  _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_. Affinities of the genus _Ptychohyla_ seem to  me to be with the red-eyed species forming the _Hyla uranochroa_ group  in Costa Rica. All of the species in the _Hyla uranochroa_ group have  large frontoparietal fontanelles, rather small ethmoids, and small  nasals that are not in contact with one another or with the ethmoid.  Some species have a complete quadratojugal-maxillary arch; others do  not. Assuming that the parental stock that gave rise both to the _Hyla  uranochroa_ group and to _Ptychohyla_ was widespread in Central  America at a time of cooler, more humid conditions, it is possible  that with subsequent warming temperatures and seasonal rainfall in the  lowlands the parental stock was restricted to the Costa Rican  highlands, where the _Hyla uranochroa_ group developed, and to the  Chiapas-Guatemala highlands, where _Ptychohyla_ evolved.                               Interspecific Relationships    _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ is thought to resemble more closely the  parental stock of the genus than does any other species of  _Ptychohyla_ now extant. This parental stock is discussed above in the  account of the generic relationships. _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ has a  red eye, white lateral stripe, frontoparietal fontanelle,  funnel-shaped mouth in tadpoles, and lacks nuptial spines; in all of  these characters it resembles members of the _Hyla uranochroa_ group.  Probably during times of glaciation during the Pleistocene, when  climates in Mexico and Central America were depressed, the  _Ptychohyla_ stock was more widespread than it is now. Subsequent  elevation of climatic zones during interglacial periods would have  isolated populations as they are today in regions of cloud forests.  Thus, through geographic isolation populations could have  differentiated and evolved into the present species. Climatic  fluctuation in the Pleistocene must have been of sufficient magnitude  to permit the spread of cool, moist forests containing _Ptychohyla_  across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec into the mountains of Oaxaca.    Because of its small nuptial spines, small triangular vomers,  coloration, and absence of a rostral keel, _Ptychohyla euthysanota_,  more than any of the other species in the _P. euthysanota_ group,  resembles _P. schmidtorum_. At the present time _P. euthysanota_ and  _P. schmidtorum_ are sympatric.    As I have mentioned previously, ecological segregation and  interspecific competition probably is highly developed in the tadpoles  of _Ptychohyla_. If this ecological segregation resulted from  intraspecific competition in a stock of _Ptychohyla_, possibly _P.  euthysanota_ and _P. schmidtorum_ differentiated sympatrically in this  way. Specific identity is maintained, at least in part, by different  breeding calls in males.    _Ptychohyla spinipollex_ and _P. leonhardschultzei_ seem to be more  closely related to one another than either is to _P. euthysanota_.  Probably a stock of _P. euthysanota_ was isolated on the Atlantic  slopes of northern Central America from _P. euthysanota_ on the  southern slopes. The frogs on the Atlantic slopes differentiated and  spread into the mountains of Oaxaca, where through isolation by the  barrier of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec they developed into _P.  leonhardschultzei_, while the stock on the northern slopes of Central  America evolved into _P. spinipollex_. Subsequent to the  differentiation of _P. leonhardschultzei_ and _P. spinipollex_ from  _P. euthysanota_ and during a time of cooler more equable climate than  exists now, _P. euthysanota_ and _P. schmidtorum_ invaded the Central  Highlands of Chiapas. Subsequent climatic changes isolated populations  of each in the Central Highlands, where _P. euthysanota macrotympanum_  and _P. schmidtorum chamulae_ evolved. _Ptychohyla ignicolor_ probably  represents stock of _P. schmidtorum_ that crossed the Isthmus of  Tehuantepec and became isolated in Oaxaca on the western side of the  isthmus.
