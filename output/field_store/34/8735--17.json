From the size of the abdomen I  could see that it was a female heavily weighted with eggs.  Possibly she had mated the previous night, and if I could secure  her, Luna life history would be mine.    So I set my  teeth and advanced.  My shoes were spoiled, and my  skirts bedraggled, but I captured the moth and saw no indication of  snakes.  Soon after she was placed in a big pasteboard box and  began dotting eggs in straight lines over the interior.  They  were white but changed colour as the caterpillars approached time  to hatch.  The little yellow-green creatures, nearly a quarter of  an inch long, with a black line across the head, emerged in about  sixteen days, and fed with most satisfaction on oak, but they  would take hickory, walnut or willow leaves also.  When the weather  is cold the young develop slower, and I have had the egg period  stretched to three weeks at times.  Every few days the young  caterpillars cast their skins and emerged in brighter colour and  larger in size.  It is usually supposed they mature in four moults,  and many of them do, but some cast a fifth skin before transforming.  When between seven and eight weeks of age, they were three inches  long, and of strong blue-green colour.  Most of them had tubercles  of yellow, tipped with blue, and some had red.    They spun a leaf-cover cocoon, much the size and shape of that of  Polyphemus, but whiter, very thin, with no inner case, and against  some solid surface whenever possible.  Fearing I might not handle  them rightly, and lose some when ready  to spin, I put half on our  walnut tree so they could weave their cocoons according to  characteristics.    They are fine, large, gaudy caterpillars.  The handsomest one I  ever saw I found among some gifts offered by Molly-Cotton for the  celebration of my birthday.  It had finished feeding, soon pupated  in a sand pail and the following spring a big female emerged that  attracted several males and they posed on a walnut trunk for beautiful  studies.    Once under the oak trees of a summer resort, Miss Katherine Howell,  of Philadelphia, intercepted a Luna caterpillar in the preliminary  race before pupation and brought it to me.  We offered young oak  leaves, but they were refused, so it went before the camera.  Behind the hotel I found an empty hominy  can in which it soon began  spinning, but it seemed to be difficult to fasten the threads to the  tin, so a piece of board was cut and firmly wedged inside.  The  caterpillar clung to this and in the darkness of the can spun the  largest and handsomest Luna winter quarters of all my experience.    Luna hunters can secure material from which to learn this exquisite  creature of night, by searching for the moths on the trunks of  oak, walnut, hickory, birch or willow, during the month of June.  The moths emerge on the ground, and climb these trees to unfold and  harden their wings.  The females usually remain where they are,  and the males are attracted to them.  If undisturbed they do not  fly until after mating and egg depositing are accomplished.  The  males take wing as soon as dusk of the first night arrives, after  their wings are matured.  They usually find the females by ten  o'clock or midnight, and remain with them until morning.  I have  found mated pairs as late as ten o'clock in the forenoon.    The moths do not eat, and after the affairs of life are  accomplished, they remain in the densest shade they can find for  a few days, and fly at night, ending their life period in from  three days to a week.  Few of these gaudily painted ones have the  chance to die naturally, for both birds and squirrels prey upon  them, tearing away the delicate wings, and feasting on the big  pulpy bodies.    White eggs on the upper side of leaves of the trees mentioned are a  sign of Luna caterpillars in deep woods, and full-grown larvae can  be found on these trees in August.  By breaking off a twig on  which they are feeding, carrying them carefully, placing them in a  box where they cannot be preyed upon by flies and parasites, and  keeping a liberal supply of fresh damp leaves, they will finish  the feeding days, and weave their cocoons.    Or the cocoons frequently can be found already spun among the  leaves, by  nutting parties later in the fall.  There is small  question if Luna pupae be alive, for on touching the cocoons they  squirm and twist so vigorously that they can be heard plainly.  There is so little difference in the size of male and female Lunas,  that I am not sure of telling them apart in the cocoon, as I am  certain I can Cecropia.    Cocoon gathering in the fall is one of the most delightful  occupations imaginable.  When flowers are gone; when birds have  migrated; when brilliant foliage piles knee deep underfoot;  during those last few days of summer, zest can be added to a ramble  by a search for cocoons.  Carrying them home with extreme care not  to jar or dent them, they are placed in the conservatory among  the flowers.  They hang from cacti spines and over thorns on the  big century plant and lemon tree.  When sprinkling, the hose is  turned on them, as they would take the rain outside.  Usually  they are placed in the coolest spots, where ventilation is good.    There is no harm whatever in taking them _if the work is carefully  and judiciously done_.  With you they are safe.  Outside they have  precarious chance for existence, for they are constantly sought by  hungry squirrels and field mice, while the sharp eyes and sharper  beaks of jays, and crows, are for ever searching for them.  The only  danger is in keeping them too warm, and so causing their emergence  before they can be placed out safely at night, after you have made  yourself acquainted with Luna history.    If they are kept cool enough that they do not emerge until May  or June, then you have one of the most exquisite treats nature has  in store for you, in watching the damp spot spread on the top of  the cocoon where an acid is ejected that cuts and softens the tough  fibre, and allows the moth to come pushing through in the full  glory of its gorgeous birth.  Nowhere in nature can you find such  delicate and daintily shaded markings or colours so brilliant and  fresh as on the wings of these creatures of night.    After you have learned the markings and colours, and secured  pictures if you desire, and they begin to exhibit a restlessness,  as soon as it is dusk, release them.  They are as well prepared  for all life has for them as if they had emerged in the woods.  The chances are that they are surer of life at your hands than  they would have been if left afield, provided you keep them cool  enough that they do not emerge too soon.  If you want to  photograph them, do it when the wings are fully  developed, but  before they have flown.  They need not be handled; their wings  are unbroken; their down covering in place to the last scale;  their colours never so brilliant; their markings the plainest  they ever will be; their big pursy bodies full of life; and  they will climb with perfect confidence on any stick, twig, or  limb held before them.  Reproductions of them are even more  beautiful than those of birds.  By all means photograph them out  of doors on a twig or leaf that their caterpillars will eat.  Moths  strengthen and dry very quickly outside in the warm crisp air of  May or June, so it is necessary to have some one beside you with  a spread net covering them, in case they want to fly  before you  are ready to make an exposure.  In painting this moth the colours  always should be copied from a living specimen as soon as it is dry.  No other moth of my acquaintance fades so rapidly.    Repeatedly I am asked which I think the most beautiful of these  big night moths.  I do not know.  All of them are indescribably  attractive.  Whether a pale green moth with purple markings is  lovelier than a light yellow moth with heliotrope decorations;  or a tan and brown one with pink lines, is a difficult thing to  determine.  When their descriptions are mastered, and the colour  combinations understood, I fancy each person will find the one  bearing most of his favourite colour the loveliest.  It may be  that on account of its artistically cut and coloured trailers,  Luna has a touch of grace above any.        CHAPTER VII  King of the Hollyhocks:  Protoparce Celeus      Protoparce Celeus was the companion of Deilephila Lineata in the  country garden where I first studied Nature.  Why I was taught that  Lineata was a bird, and Celeus a moth, it is difficult to understand,  for they appear very similar when poising before flowers.  They  visit the same blooms, and vary but little in size.  The distinction  that must have made the difference was that while Lineata kept  company with the hummingbirds and fed all day, Celeus came forth at  dusk, and flew in the evening and at night.  But that did not  conclusively prove it a moth, for nighthawks and whip-poor-wills did  the same; yet unquestionably they were birds.    Anyway, I always knew Celeus was a moth, and that every big, green  caterpillar killed on the tomato vines meant one less of its kind  among the flowers.  I never saw one of these moths close a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4912"],[0,"Wacousta : a tale of the Pontiac conspiracy (Complete) (#15)"],[1,"fools ye are,\" interrupted the leading sergeant;  \"who ever saw an Ingian with light hair? and sure this hair in the neck  is that of a Christian.\"    At that moment Captain Erskine, attracted by the sudden halt produced  by the falling of the body, came quickly up to the front.    \"What is the meaning of all this, Cassidy?\" he sternly demanded of the  sergeant; \"why is this halt without my orders, and how comes the body  here?\"    \"Carter stumbled against a root, sir, and the body rolled over upon the  ground.\"    \"And was the body to roll back again?\" angrily rejoined his  captain.--\"What mean ye, fellows, by standing there; quick, replace it  upon the litter, and mind this does not occur again.\"    \"They say, sir,\" said the sergeant, respectfully, as the men proceeded  to their duty, \"that it is not Captain de Haldimar after all, but an  Ingian.\"    \"Not Captain de Haldimar! are ye all mad? and have the Indians, in  reality, turned your brains with fear?\"    What, however, was his own surprise, and that of Lieutenant Johnstone,  when, on a closer examination of the corpse, which the men had now  placed with its face uppermost, they discovered the bewildering fact  that it was not, indeed, Captain de Haldimar who lay before them, but a  stranger, dressed in the uniform of that officer.    There was no time to solve, or even to dwell on the singular mystery;  for the Indians, though now retired, might be expected to rally and  renew the attack. Once more, therefore, the detachment moved forward;  the officers dropping as before to the rear, to watch any movements of  the enemy should he re-appear. Nothing, however, occurred to interrupt  their march; and in a few minutes the heavy clanking sound of the  chains of the drawbridge, as it was again raised by its strong pullies,  and the dull creaking sound of the rusty bolts and locks that secured  the ponderous gate, announced the detachment was once more safely  within the fort.    While the wounded men were being conveyed to the hospital, a group,  comprising almost all the officers of the garrison, hastened to meet  Captain Erskine and Lieutenant Johnstone. Congratulations on the escape  of the one, and compliments, rather than condolences, on the accident  of the other, which the arm en echarpe denoted to be slight, were  hastily and warmly proffered. These felicitations were the genuine  ebullitions of the hearts of men who really felt a pride, unmixed with  jealousy, in the conduct of their fellows; and so cool and excellent  had been the manner in which Captain Erskine had accomplished his  object, that it had claimed the undivided admiration of all who had  been spectators of the affair, and had, with the aid of their  telescopes, been enabled to follow the minutest movements of the  detachment.    \"By heaven!\" he at length replied, his chest swelling with gratified  pride at the warm and generous approval of his companions, \"this more  than repays me for every risk. Yet, to be sincere, the credit is not  mine, but Wentworth's. But for you, my dear fellow,\" grasping and  shaking the hand of that officer, \"we should have rendered but a  Flemish account of ourselves. How beautifully those guns covered our  retreat! and the first mortar that sent the howling devils flying in  air like so many Will-o'the-wisps, who placed that, Wentworth?\"    \"I did,\" replied the officer, with a quickness that denoted a natural  feeling of exultation; \"but Bombardier Kitson's was the most effective.  It was his shell that drove the Indians finally out of the bomb-proof,  and left the coast clear for your retreat.\"    \"Then Kitson, and his gunners also, merit our best thanks,\" pursued  Captain Erskine, whose spirits, now that his detachment was in safety,  were more than usually exhilarated by the exciting events of the last  hour; \"and what will be more acceptable, perhaps, they shall each have  a glass of my best old Jamaica before they sleep,--and such stuff is  not to be met with every day in this wilderness of a country. But,  confound my stupid head! where are Charles de Haldimar and Sir Everard  Valletort?\"    \"Poor Charles is in a high fever, and confined to his bed,\" remarked  Captain Blessington, who now came up adding his congratulations in a  low tone, that marked the despondency of his heart; \"and Sir Everard I  have just left on the rampart with the company, looking, as he well  may, the very image of despair.\"    \"Run to them, Sumners, my dear boy,\" said Erskine, hastily addressing  himself to a young ensign who stood near him; \"run quickly, and relieve  them of their error. Say it is not De Haldimar who has been killed,  therefore they need not make themselves any longer uneasy on that  score.\"    The officers gave a start of surprise. Sumners, however, hastened to  acquit himself of the pleasing task assigned him, without waiting to  hear the explanation of the singular declaration.    \"Not De Haldimar!\" eagerly and anxiously exclaimed Captain Blessington;  \"who then have you brought to us in his uniform, which I clearly  distinguished from the rampart as you passed? Surely you would not  tamper with us at such a moment, Erskine?\"    \"Who it is, I know not more than Adam,\" rejoined the other; \"unless,  indeed, it be the devil himself. All I do know, is, it is not our  friend De Haldimar; although, as you observe, he most certainly wears  his uniform. But you shall see and judge for yourselves, gentlemen.  Sergeant Cassidy,\" he enquired of that individual, who now came to ask  if the detachment was to be dismissed, \"where have you placed the  litter?\"    \"Under the piazza of the guard-room, Sir,\" answered the sergeant.    These words had scarcely been uttered, when a general and hasty  movement of the officers, anxious to satisfy themselves by personal  observation it was not indeed De Haldimar who had fallen, took place in  the direction alluded to, and in the next moment they were at the side  of the litter.    A blanket had been thrown upon the corpse to conceal the loathsome  disfigurement of the face, over which masses of thick coagulated blood  were laid in patches and streaks, that set all recognition at defiance.  The formation of the head alone, which was round and short, denoted it  to be not De Haldimar's. Not a feature was left undefiled; and even the  eyes were so covered, it was impossible to say whether their lids were  closed or open. More than one officer's cheek paled with the sickness  that rose to his heart as he gazed on the hideous spectacle; yet, as  the curiosity of all was strongly excited to know who the murdered man  really was who had been so unaccountably inducted in the uniform of  their lost companion, they were resolved to satisfy themselves without  further delay. A basin of warm water and a sponge were procured from  the guard-room of Ensign Fortescue, who now joined them, and with these  Captain Blessington proceeded to remove the disguise.    In the course of this lavation, it was discovered the extraordinary  flow of blood and brains had been produced by the infliction of a deep  wound on the back of the head, by the sharp and ponderous tomahawk of  an Indian. It was the only blow that had been given; and the  circumstance of the deceased having been found lying on his face,  accounted for the quantity of gore, that, trickling downwards, had so  completely disguised every feature. As the coat of thick encrusted  matter gave way beneath the frequent application of the moistening  sponge, the pallid hue of the countenance denoted the murdered man to  be a white. All doubt, however, was soon at an end. The ammunition  shoes, the grey trowsers, the coarse linen, and the stiff leathern  stock encircling the neck, attested the sufferer to be a soldier of the  garrison; but it was not until the face had been completely denuded of  its unsightly covering, and every feature fully exposed, that that  soldier was at length recognised to be Harry Donellan, the trusty and  attached servant of Captain de Haldimar.    While yet the officers stood apart, gazing at the corpse, and forming a  variety of conjectures, as vague as they were unsatisfactory, in regard  to their new mystery, Sir Everard Valletort, pale and breathless with  the speed he had used, suddenly appeared among them.    \"God of heaven! can it be true--and is it really not De Haldimar whom I  have shot?\" wildly asked the agitated young man. \"Who is this,  Erskine?\" he continued, glancing at the litter. \"Explain, for pity's  sake, and quickly.\"    \"Compose yourself, my dear Valletort,\" replied the officer addressed.  \"You see this is not De Haldimar, but his servant Donellan. Neither has  the latter met his death from your rifle; there is no mark of a bullet  about him. It was an Indian tomahawk that did his business; and I will  stake my head against a hickory nut the blow came from the same rascal  at whom you fired, and who gave back the shot and the scalp halloo.\"    This opinion was unanimously expressed by the remainder of the  officers. Sir Everard was almost as much overpowered by his joy, as he  had previously been overwhelmed by his despair, and he grasped and  shook the hand of Captain Erskine, who had thus been the means of  relieving his conscience, with an energy of gratitude and feeling that  almost drew tears from the eyes of that blunt but gallant officer.    \"Thank God, thank God!\" he fervently exclaimed: \"I have not then even  the death of poor Donellan to answer for;\" and hastening from the  guard-room, he pursued his course hurriedly and delightedly to the  barrack-room of his friend.

The hour fixed for the trial of the prisoner Halloway had now arrived,  and the officers composing the court were all met in the mess-room of  the garrison, surrounding a long table covered with green cloth, over  which were distributed pens, ink, and paper for taking minutes of the  evidence, and such notes of the proceedings as the several"]]]
