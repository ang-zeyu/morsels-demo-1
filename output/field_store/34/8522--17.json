But more grateful still to him was the sight  of people everywhere reading the Scriptures and the Prayer Book.  Wherever he went he was received with the utmost veneration. The heathen  fired off muskets and executed war dances; the Christians showed their  feelings in gentler ways. One chief sat upon the ground gazing upon him  in silence, without moving a limb or uttering a single word, for several  hours. \"Let me alone,\" he said, when urged to move away; \"let me take a  last look; I shall never see him again.\" At Kaitaia, Marsden held a  constant levee, sitting in an arm-chair, in an open field before the  mission house. More than a thousand Maoris came to see him there, some  of them having travelled for many miles.    During this tour the old hero visited all the stations, except those  which had been abandoned in the south. John King was the one link of  connection between this farewell visit and the first. He had removed his  dwelling in 1832 from its original position in the historic bay of  Rangihoua to a more suitable spot at Te Puna, on the other side of the  hill. His work had been greatly interrupted by a curious sabbatarian  sect which had arisen among his little flock; nor had the faithful man  any striking success to show; but he had held the fort amidst manifold  discouragements, and he had gained the respect of the people around.    At the departure of the patriarch from our shores, the feelings of his  converts reached their climax. From Kerikeri and from Waimate they came  in crowds to the Bay to bid him farewell, and the scene on the beach  resembled that at Miletus when the people of Ephesus \"fell on Paul's  neck, and kissed him.\" A warship conveyed Marsden to Australia, and  during the voyage he spoke much of his lately-deceased wife, and of the  many friends who had preceded him to the eternal world. On a friend  remarking that the separation would not be for long, \"God grant it,\" he  replied; and lifting his eyes to the bright moon, which laid a shining  pathway across the heaving waters, he exclaimed with intense feeling:      Prepare me, Lord, for Thy right hand,      Then come the joyful day!    That day indeed was not far distant, for he died some nine months later,  on May 12th, 1838, and was buried in his family vault in the cemetery  at Parramatta. Seldom, surely, has it been granted to anyone to see such  a rich result of his labours before his death. The New Zealand mission,  be it remembered, was only one of the fields of his activity: the  Tahitian mission of the London Missionary Society was almost equally  indebted to his care and generosity; while his own proper work among the  convicts of New South Wales was enough to try the most ardent faith.  Yet, in every field, he lived to see enormous difficulties overcome, and  a plentiful harvest gathered in. Next to his heroic faith must be placed  his almost boundless liberality. No one ever discovered the amount of  money he provided from his own private funds for the New Zealand work,  but it was known to be very great. As to his whole career we may quote  the words of Saunders, who would not be likely to show any favour: \"He  was not a great preacher, nor a great writer, nor a great actor; but he  was a good man and wrought righteousness. His patience and courage were  unbounded; his unselfish purity was brilliant; his benevolence was  universal. He obtained no title, he acquired no landed estate, no  monument was erected to his memory, his bones rest not in New Zealand  soil; but the blessing of those who were ready to perish has come upon  him; and the proud and secure position which the Maori now holds in  civilised society is mainly due to the stedfast faith and trust in his  ultimate capability, which nothing could drive from the breast of Samuel  Marsden.\"    [Illustration: BISHOP SELWYN.]          CHAPTER VI.    \"YEARS OF THE RIGHT HAND.\"    (1838-1840).      The right hand of the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass.      --_Psalms._      We now approach the climax of the missionary period. The plant which had  been rooted with so much difficulty, nursed with so much care, watered  with so many tears of disappointment, was now to break into sudden and  wonderful bloom.    The check caused by the Rotorua-Thames (or \"bonnet\") war was but of  short duration. Long before its close, Chapman was back at Rotorua, with  Morgan as his colleague. They built a new station on the island in the  lake (Mokoia), and here their families and their wardrobes were in  peace. Before long every village round the lake had its raupo chapel;  and Chapman himself pressed on southward to Lake Taupo, where the  effects of his labours will meet us later on.    In the same year (1838) Brown and Wilson re-occupied Tauranga, which  soon became a particularly powerful centre. Not only were the  catechetical classes large and enthusiastic, but the native teachers  itinerated through the villages of the district, and a party of fifteen  set off on a missionary tour to Taupo and Cook Strait. The history of  this bold undertaking is hard to discover, but local traditions seem to  show that these dimly-remembered pioneers must have descended the  Wanganui River, and that at least one must have penetrated as far south  as Otaki.    From Tauranga also an occasional visit was paid to Matamata, which was  not again to become the residence of a white missionary. But it had  Tamihana Waharoa with his model _pa_, and its graveyard contained the  grave of Tarore, \"who, being dead, yet spake.\" Her father, Ngakuku, did  not indulge in useless grief, but in 1839 accompanied Wilson from  Tauranga along the Bay of Plenty to Opotiki near its eastern end, and  there they founded a station amid a people more savage than any yet  encountered. Yet even these accepted the new teaching with eagerness. A  curious evidence of this was given by a deputation which came one day to  Opotiki from a village 30 miles in the interior. The object of these  strangers was not blankets or powder, but simply to ask the white man  whether the words of the burial service might be read over the  unbaptised!    Outside the region of the \"bonnet\" war, changes also were in progress.  The tribes were moving toward the coast, and their teachers found it  wise to follow. The Puriri station was for this reason broken up, and  two new ones established on the Hauraki Gulf--Fairburn settling at  Maraetai, and Preece near the mouth of the Thames. Hamlin, too,  abandoned his post at Mangapouri, and sailed down the Waikato to its  mouth. Proceeding northwards to the Manukau Harbour, he found there the  Rev. R. Maunsell already established. They worked together for three  years; then Maunsell, leaving Hamlin at Manukau, opened a new station at  Waikato Heads. Maunsell was a Dublin graduate of great eloquence and  strong personality. He soon acquired a commanding influence over the  people of his district, and an examination held by him in 1839 rivalled  those of the Bay of Islands ten years before. Fifteen hundred people  were present at this gathering. A class of 450 were examined in the  Catechism in the open air, while 300 more advanced scholars inside the  schoolhouse displayed their proficiency in varied subjects, some of them  repeating correctly whole chapters out of the Epistles. At the close  came a baptismal service, when 100 Maoris were received into the fold of  Christ's Church; and afterwards a celebration of the Holy Communion,  when more than that number participated. The service was followed by a  feast, at which whole pigs were deftly carved and carefully apportioned,  with their share of corn and kumeras, to each tribe: \"In a few moments  the whole vanished as if by magic. All was animation and cheerfulness,  and even those who had come four and five days' distance seemed to  forget their fatigue in the general excitement.\"    While the mission was thus spreading through the island in cheering  fashion, the older stations at the Bay were privileged to receive an  episcopal visit. The able and devoted Dr. Broughton had lately (1836)  been appointed Bishop of Australia, and had been requested by the C.M.S.  to extend his pastoral care, as far as possible, to the islands of New  Zealand. The mention of such a visit calls up imaginative pictures of  its probable course. Would there not have been intense expectation and  busy preparations beforehand? The Maoris would doubtless welcome their  august visitor with characteristic heartiness, and would come forward in  hundreds, if not in thousands, to receive the gift of Confirmation at  his hands. His journeys from one station to another would be like a  triumphal progress; there would have been feastings, gifts, and  rejoicings everywhere.    The actual facts were just the reverse. No one knew beforehand of his  lordship's intention. He arrived unexpectedly on Dec. 21, 1838, and at a  time when any sort of public welcome was well-nigh impossible. A violent  epidemic of influenza had just spread through the settlements, and  hardly a person was unaffected. Everyone was ill and weak. It was not  without a certain appropriateness that the first distinctively episcopal  acts performed upon our soil were those of the consecration of  burial-grounds at Paihia and at Kororareka. The bishop went inland to  Waimate, but the missionary in charge (R. Davis) could hardly, for  weakness, show his visitor round the village. To judge by his journals,  his thoughts were more taken up with his dying Maoris than with the  living prelate. At the confirmation held when the bishop returned to  Paihia (Jan. 5), only 44 Maoris were able to be presented, besides 20  white people--mostly missionaries' children. At the Hauraki station the  bishop found a mere handful able to receive the laying-on of hands.  Owing to the shortness of his visit and to the difficulty of  communication, he was unable to visit more than these three stations;  and"]]]
