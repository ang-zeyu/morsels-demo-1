In effect, the Suite was a kind of \"international  Potpourri\" of the dances most in vogue, and affords us a vivid  reflection of the manners and customs of the period. Many of the  English Suites begin with an elaborate polyphonic Prelude. We shall  not give a detailed analysis of all these dance movements; for the  main characteristics the tabulated list will suffice, and in the book  of Supplementary examples (see No. 35) will be found the 6th French  Suite complete. It will be more useful to center attention on those  dances which, in rhythmic pattern, are especially typical and are most  frequently employed in modern music; and we shall select, as examples  drawn from various sources, those dances which make a direct appeal.  The most characteristic of the dances are the Sarabande, the Gavotte,  the Minuet and the Gigue; and with the last, as exemplifying the same  spirit, may be grouped the Rigaudon, Furiant, Tarantella and  Saltarello.    The Sarabande is a slow, stately dance; always in triple meter  indicated by 3/2 or 3/4. Its striking features are the frequent  occurrence of the rhythmic pattern    [Music] or [Music]    in which it is evident that there is a strong accent on the weak  beats; and the prevalence of feminine endings in the cadences. The  Sarabande always displays great depth of emotion--often of a tragic  and impassioned kind; and, in the Suite, seems to have served the  composer for the same outpouring of feeling which we associate with  the slow movement in the later Sonata or Symphony. The example cited  in the Supplement (See No. 28)--taken from one of Bach's Sonatas for  'cello--is considered one of the most beautiful in existence. Other  eloquent Sarabandes may be found in the Second and Third English  Suites and in Handel's noble Air \"Lascia ch'io pianga\" from the opera  of _Rinaldo_. Two fine modern examples of this dance are the second  number in Paderewski's _Humoresques de Concert_, op. 14, and the  second number in the set of pieces by Debussy, _Pour le  Piano_--_Prelude_, _Sarabande_, _Toccata_. Composers sometimes employ  the Sarabande rhythm for its inherent beauty, or for dramatic purposes  without indication of the fact. Examples are the theme for variations  in Beethoven's Sonata, op. 109, and the opening measures of the  _Egmont Overture_ where, by means of the characteristic Spanish  dance-rhythm, an atmosphere of oppression and dejection is  established, _e.g._    [Music]    The Gavotte is an energetic yet dignified dance in duple rhythm (it is  almost always played too fast)--the characteristics of which are its  beginning on the half-measure and its strongly marked cadences. One of  the most stirring examples is that cited from the Third English Suite  (See Supplement No. 29) which, with its subdued middle portion, La  Musette,[73] is an early example of tripartite arrangement. Other  gavottes[74] are the favorite one from the Fifth French Suite, that  from Handel's opera _Ottone_ (so often played in organ or pianoforte  transcriptions) and, from modern literature, the charming one in  d'Albert's _Suite for Pianoforte_, op. 1.    [Footnote 73: So-called because it is written on a sustained bass note  or pedal point; a feature of the Musette (the French name for Bagpipe)  being its persistent drone bass on the tonic and the dominant.]    [Footnote 74: An interesting example may also be found in Grieg's  _Holberg Suite for Pianoforte_.]    The Minuet is of particular interest, not alone because of the many  beautiful examples of its use but because it is the only dance which,  carried over from the Suite, has remained an integral movement of  Symphonic compositions. The Minuet, in its older form, was a stately  dance; the derivation of the term (French menu) referring to the  dainty steps of the dancers, always in 3/8 or 3/4 metre and beginning  on the first beat of the measure. By Haydn the character of the Minuet  was considerably changed; the tempo becomes much faster, the music  begins on the third beat of the measure instead of the first and the  mood is one of playful humor--at times even of downright jollity. In  the Minuets of Mozart the peculiar characteristics are grace and  tenderness rather than rollicking fun, _e.g._, the charming examples  in the E-flat major and G minor Symphonies. Concerning the  transformation by Beethoven of the Minuet into the Scherzo, with its  fantastic and freakish atmosphere, we shall speak more fully in  connection with his Symphonies. Of the examples cited in the  Supplement (see Nos. 30 and 31) the former, from the first Finale of  Mozart's opera _Don Giovanni_, remains one of the most famous minuets  in existence; and the two from Rameau's opera, _Castor and Pollux_,  are of inimitable spontaneity and rhythmic grace. They are grouped in  contrasting, tripartite arrangement. In modern literature every one  knows of the melodious example for Pianoforte by Paderewski (No. 1 of  the _Humoresques de Concert_) and the _Menuet Italien_ by Mrs. Beach;  that in the last scene of Verdi's _Falstaff_ is also well worth  acquaintance.    The last of the particularly characteristic dances is the Gigue with  its counterparts mentioned above. This is a rapid, animated dance in  6/8, 3/8, 12/8, 12/16 (sometimes 4/4) with marked rhythm; the term  being derived from giga (German, geige)--an early name for fiddle--on  account of the power of accent associated with the violin family. The  Gigue is always the closing number of Bach's Suites, in order to give  a final impression of irrepressible vitality and gaiety, and is  treated with considerable polyphonic complexity; in fact, his gigues  often begin like a complete Fugue. They are all in clear-cut Two-part  form; and it became the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30576"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#15)"],[1,"he go home and get took with yellow fever and die.    \"They was the old lady what die. She was a terrible soul. One time after  she die I go to get water out of her rain barrel and I had a lamp in one  hand. That old lady's ghost blowed out the lamp and slapped the pitcher  out my hand.

We have seven children but  four live now. Frank my only boy live now, in Iowa, in Louisiana, and my  two girls live, Enziede De Querive and Rose Baptiste.          420199           JULIA BLANKS was born of a slave mother and a three-quarter Indian       father, in San Antonio, in the second year of the Civil War. Her       mother, part French and part Negro, was owned by Mrs. John G.       Wilcox, formerly a Miss Donaldson, who had lived at the White       House, and who gave Julia to her daughter. After the slaves were       freed, Julia continued to live with her mother in San Antonio       until, at fifteen, she married Henry Hall. Five years later her       second marriage took place, at Leon Springs, Texas, where she lived       until moving to the Adams ranch, on the Frio River. Here she raised       her family. After leaving the Adams ranch, Julia and Henry bought       two sections of state land, but after four years they let it go       back because of Henry's ill health, and moved to Uvalde.      \"I was born in San Antonio, in 1862. My mother's name was Rachael  Miller. I don't know if she was born in Tennessee or Mississippi. I  heard her talk of both places. I don't know nothing about my father,  because he run off when I was about three months old. He was  three-quarter Cherokee Indian. They were lots of Indians then, and my  husband's people come from Savannah, Georgia, and he said they was lots  of Indians there. I had two sisters and one brother and the sisters are  dead but my brother lives somewhere in Arizona. My mother's master's  name was John C. Wilcox.    \"When we was small chillen, they hired my sisters out, but not me. My  grandfather bought my grandmother's time and they run a laundry house.  They hired my mother out, too.    \"You see, my grandmother was free born, but they stole her and sold her  to Miss Donaldson. She was half French. She looked jes' like a French  woman. She wasn't a slave, but she and her brother were stolen and sold.  She said the stage coach used to pass her aunt's house, and one day she  and her brother went down to town to buy some buns, and when they were  comin' back, the stage stopped and asked 'em to ride. She wanted to  ride, but her brother didn't. But they kep' coaxin' 'em till they got  'em in. They set her down between the two women that was in there and  set her brother between two men, and when they got close to the house,  they threw cloaks over their heads and told the driver to drive as fast  as he could, and he sure drove. They taken 'em to Washin'ton, to the  White House, and made her a present to Mary Wilcox (Miss Donaldson) and  her brother to somebody else. Then this woman married John C. Wilcox and  they come to Texas.    \"She saw a cousin of hers when they got to Washin'ton, and she knew,  after that, he had somethin' to do with her and her brother bein'  stolen. One day she found a piece of yellow money and took it to her  cousin and he told her it wasn't no good and gave her a dime to go get  her some candy. After that, she saw gold money and knew what it was.    \"She said she had a good time, though, when she was growing up. They  were pretty good to her, but after they came to San Antonio, Mrs. Wilcox  began bein' mean. She kep' my mother hired out all the time and gave me  to her daughter and my sister to her son. My mother was kep' hired out  all the time, cooking; and after freedom, she just took to washin' and  ironin'. My grandfather bought his time and my grandmother's time out.  They didn't stay with her.    \"I've heard my mother talk about coffee. They roasted beans and made  coffee. She says, out on the plantation, they would take bran and put it  in a tub and have 'em stir it up with water in it and let all the white  go to the bottom and dip it off and strain it and make starch. I have  made starch out of flour over and often, myself. I had four or five  little girls; and I had to keep 'em like pins. In them days they wore  little calico dresses, wide and full and standin' out, and a bonnet to  match every dress.    \"I used to hear my grandmother tell about the good times they used to  have. They would go from one plantation to another and have quiltin's  and corn huskin's. And they would dance. They didn't have dances then  like they do now. The white people would give them things to eat. They  would have to hoof it five or six miles and didn't mind it.    \"They had what they called _patros_, and if you didn't have a pass they  would whip you and put you in jail. Old Man Burns was hired at the  courthouse, and if the marsters had slaves that they didn't want to  whip, they would send them to the courthouse to be whipped. Some of the  marsters was good and some wasn't. There was a woman, oh, she was the  meanest thing! I don't know if she had a husband--I never did hear  anything about him. When she would get mad at one of her slave women,  she would make the men tie her down, and she had what they called  cat-o'-nine-tails, and after she got the blood to come, she would dip it  in salt and pepper and whip her again. Oh, she was mean! My mother's  marster was good; he wouldn't whip any of his slaves. But his wife  wasn't good. If she got mad at the women, when he would come home she  would say: 'John, I want you to whip Liza.' Or Martha. And he would say,  'Them are your slaves. You whip them.' He was good and she was mean.    \"When my aunt would go to clean house, she (Mrs. Wilcox) would turn all  the pictures in the house but one, the meanest looking one--you know how  it always looks like a picture is watching you everywhere you go--and  she would tell her if she touched a thing or left a bit of dirt or if  she didn't do it good, this picture would tell. And she believed it.    \"My grandmother told a tale one time. You know in slave time they had an  old woman to cook for the chillen. One day they were going to have  company. This woman that was the boss of the place where the chillen was  kept told the old cullud woman to take a piece of bacon and grease the  mouths of all the chillen. Then she told a boy to bring them up to these  people, and the woman said: 'Oh, you must feed these chillen good, just  look at their mouths!' And the woman said, 'Oh, that's the way they  eat.' They didn't get meat often. That was just to make them believe  they had lots to eat.    \"No. They were cut off from education. The way my stepfather got his  learning was a cullud blacksmith would teach school at night, and us  chillen taught our mother. She didn't know how to spell or read or  nothin'. She didn't know B from bull's foot. Some of them were allowed  to have church and some didn't. Mighty few read the Bible 'cause they  couldn't read. As my mother used to say, they were raised up as green  as cucumbers. That old blacksmith was the onlyist man that knew how to  read and write in slavery time that I knew of. My grandmother or none of  them knew how to read; they could count, but that was all. That's what  makes me mad. I tell my grandchillen they ought to learn all they can  'cause the old people never had a chance. My husband never did have any  schooling, but he sure could figger. Now, if you want me to get tangled  up, just give me a pencil and paper and I don't know nothing.\" She  tapped her skull. \"I figger in my head! The chillen, today, ought to  appreciate an education.    \"Oh, yes, they were good to the slaves when they were sick. They would  have the doctor come out and wait on them. Most plantations had what  they called an old granny cullud woman that treated the chillen with  herbs and such things.    \"Games? I don't know. We used to play rap jacket. We would get switches  and whip one another. You know, after you was hit several times it  didn't hurt much. I've played a many time. In slave time the men used to  go huntin' at night, and hunt 'possums and 'coons. They would have a dog  or two along. They used to go six or seven miles afoot to corn huskin's  and quiltin's. And those off the other plantations would come over and  join in the work. And they would nearly always have a good dinner.  Sometimes some of the owners would give 'em a hog or somethin' nice to  eat, but some of 'em didn't.    \"No'm, I don't know if they run off to the North, but some of them  runned off and stayed in the swamps, and they was mean. They called them  runaways. If they saw you, they would tell you to bring them something  to eat. And if you didn't do it, if they ever got you they sure would  fix you.    \"I don't know when my mother was set free. My husband's marster's name  was King. He was from Savannah, Georgia, but at the time was living  close to Boerne. My husband's father was killed in the war. When my  husband was about ten years old, his marster hadn't told them they was  free. You know some of them didn't tell the slaves they was free until  they had to. After freedom was declared, lots of people didn't tell the  slaves they were free. One morning, my husband said, he happended to  look out and he saw a big bunch of men coming down the road, and he  thought he never saw such pretty men in his life on"]]]
