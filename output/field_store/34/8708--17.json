Its language (the best butt of cavaliers) is said  not to harmonize with the philological rules of the nineteenth  century. One word in reply. Peter and John were illiterate men, who  spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and their language was  accredited to unlearned men by their hearers. Now, if redundant and  ungrammatical language may be the medium through which the Holy Ghost  communicates by men in speaking, may it not with equal propriety be  employed in _writing_, by a similar class of men? It is not denied,  that there is something wonderful about all this matter. The prophet  Isaiah considered it wonderful, when he calls it a \"marvellous work:  a marvellous work and a wonder.\" \"The wisdom of their wise men shall  perish, and the understanding of their prudent shall be hid.\" All the  learned commentaries of divines, as this gospel advances, shall be  buried in oblivion, as so much rubbish.    God declares, by the same prophet, that he has seen the wickedness of  the wicked, and the oppression of the poor and upright, until he rises  up to \"_do his work, his strange work_, and bring to pass his act,  his strange act.\" He warns men against making a mock of this strange  and marvellous work, lest their \"bands be made strong,\" for he has  \"_decreed a consumption upon the whole earth_.\" This is what John also  says;--\"The hour of His judgment\" is measurably simultaneous with the  proclamation of the gospel. Habakkuk, the prophet, told men to wait  for this same vision of American prophets, written on tables (tabular  plates), which would be a long time before it made its appearance; but  it would \"surely come,\" because God had promised these seers that a  remnant of their seed, on that continent, should be saved. No pen can  describe the joy and exultation that they must have felt in obtaining  such a promise, or the bliss now experienced by them in the fulfilment  of it. But for the fulfilment of this promise, none of them or their  righteous contemporaries would ever have been made perfect.    Oh! how great the goodness and mercy of God to every nation, without  respect of persons! How great, too, the indebtedness of this generation  to Almighty God for that most precious \"_stone_\" of prophetic records,  that reveals at once the history of the American continent--a continent  of otherwise unfathomable antiquities and wonders--a land that  embowels the bones of a numerous and mighty race of people, with all  their implements of husbandry and of art! Where, also, are the ruins of  splendid cities, the former glory of which might surpass even gigantic  London! Within that stone, too, was written with a pen of iron, as  infallibly as the marks on Belshazzar's palace, the future destiny of  the American people.    In conclusion, do you ask if the Apostolic Church is again  re-established, where is it? I reply, it is in the mountains where  the Lord's House is to be built in the last days. Driven by the cruel  hand of persecution to the very place where the Lord has declared He  will \"_hide_ them till the indignation be overpast.\" Do you also ask  what kind of organization this Church has? The answer is, the same  as that of the Apostolic Church in the days of Peter, consisting of  Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, &c.; with the gifts of healing,  tongues, interpretation, casting out devils, prophesyings, &c. Do  you ask who has seen any of these miraculous fruits of this Church?  I answer a _hundred thousand_ living witnesses are ready to testify  that the \"signs\" which Christ said \"shall follow them that believe,\"  _do_, in very deed, follow believers in _this_ Church. Do you say,  are they credible witnesses? They were generally accounted credible  persons, until they believed and obeyed this gospel. Do their lives  show that they do sincerely believe and love the apostolic gospel which  they profess? Nothing as yet, has been able to separate them from it;  neither home nor country, nor the inheritances of their fathers, nor  penury or reproach, or evil report, or cold, or nakedness, and no  certain dwelling-place for years!    I now close this simple and unembellished statement of truth, being  written in a state of convalescence from severe sickness, hoping a  portion of your inquiries will have been satisfactorily answered,    Your friend and servant,    ORSON SPENCER.        LETTER VIII.    THE TRUE AND LIVING GOD.    _Liverpool, September_ 13, 1847.    Reverend and Dear Sir,--In this epistle I shall endeavour to set before  you a description of the person, abode, and character of THE TRUE AND  LIVING GOD. In so doing I trust it will not be imputed to arrogance if  I borrow my apology from the language of St. Paul:--\"As I passed by I  beheld an altar with this inscription, 'To the Unknown God.' Whom ye  ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.\"    The people of Paul's day had for several generations been unaccustomed  to receive revelations from the true God, believing, generally, that  revelations from God had ceased with Malachi. They supposed that  the canon of scripture was complete long before their time, and  they considered that the great law-giver, Moses, had established an  immutable code of laws and government, suited to the condition of  people of all ages and circumstances whatever, to the end of time; and  the Jews, to this very day, entertain the same opinion.    Labouring under this most blighting and soul-darkening opinion for  several centuries, without the light of any new revelation, and  without the aid of that immediate inspiration which attended Moses  and the prophets, their foolish hearts became darkened as a necessary  consequence. Inflated with pride, and a false but sincere reverence for  the scriptures of a previous age, they became a conspicuous and warning  example to this generation of ignorance, not only of the scriptures,  which they carefully memorized, but also of all the essential  attributes of the person, character, and doctrine of God.    Now, sir, during the long period of sixteen or eighteen hundred years,  in which the light of immediate revelation has not shone, the religious  world have fallen into similar and even far greater darkness. The true  and living God is not known as I shall proceed to show.    The religious world have an abundance of zeal for God, and diligence in  spreading the scriptures and their missionaries over the face of the  earth; but, alas! the God they profess to worship is an unknown God,  and this ignorance of God is the legitimate consequence of not having  immediate revelation from him, during a _long_ period of near eighteen  hundred years; and unaided by the spirit of inspiration, the ancient  scriptures have become a dark and obscure book--their import has been  warmly debated by a thousand learned disputants, without any prospect  of approximation to unity.    A very general conviction concerning the character of God now is, that  He is a Being without body, or parts, or passions. A greater absurdity  cannot be furnished in all the annals of heathenism. Even images of  wood, and brass, and stone, are scarcely more remote from the picture  of the true God, than the theory of a passionless, matterless God--an  inconceivable sort of chaotic being, that is without form, or void,  or dwelling place! a being whose circumference is everywhere, and his  centre nowhere!    Another theory concerning God, that is entertained by Jewish Rabbies,  though of an opposite character, is not much more extravagant than the  common orthodox theory, viz, the Rabbies suppose that God is a Being of  some \"_millions of miles in length_.\"    Again, the popular notion of modern Jews, as expressed in a recent  number of the _Jewish Chronicle_, is, that the Almighty God is a  Being of such infinite _dimension_, that He cannot _condense_ himself  sufficiently to speak to men, or be tangible or visible by mortals.  Accordingly, when he gives revelation to men, He creates a fictitious  or imaginary messenger, through whom he communicates his will, and this  messenger has no real existence in the eye of God, and _only_ in the  momentary perception of the person addressed.--(See _Millennial Star_  No. 15, also _Jewish Chronicle_.)    From the foregoing it may be seen how grossly ignorant both Jews and  Christians are of the person of God, the Creator and Saviour of the  world! All this, too, in an age of the world boasting of blazing light!  of a millennial dawn! of the unparalleled march of improvement! but,  alas! the very God and Father of us all, who ought to be _truly_ known  in order to be rightly worshipped, is regarded as the most insensible  (a God without \"_passion_\" must be insensible), and irrational, and  unattractive as to form, of all beings that can be conceived of; and  the most surprising feature in all modern theology in an age of sanity  is, that this notion concerning the person of God, is deducible from  the scriptures of the Old and New Testament.    The New Testament tells us most unequivocally what kind of person God  has, and whether he is a Being having both passion and physical form.  It tells whether he can be so \"_condensed_\" as to speak to men, and  be seen of them, and talk to them face to face, as a man talks to his  fellow man. The New Testament declares that in Jesus Christ dwelt the  \"FULNESS OF THE GODHEAD, BODILY.\"    Now, if the Godhead dwelt in the body of Christ, then it is certain  that God is not without a _body_. But He has a body; and what is His  body like unto? The New Testament tells us what His body is like. It  is so nearly and exactly like unto the body of Christ, that there is  no difference. Paul says, that Christ was the \"_express image of his  person_.\" It is then beyond all dispute that the body and person of  Jesus Christ and the Father are alike. Language cannot express the  similitude of the Father and the Son in plainer or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45899"],[0,"Studies of Travel: Italy (#15)"],[1,"of Horace and his friends than he to whom Brindisi is  the haven for Egypt or India, and who rushes thither as fast as he  can along the Italian side of the Hadriatic. The three routes will  of necessity coincide at Bari. To Bari the traveller who starts from  Rome must add Benevento, and he may, without much trouble, add Aricia.  But the sites that lie around the Alban mount, the Alban lake, and  its lesser fellow--the relics in short of so many volcanoes, wet and  dry, the possible place of Alba, the more certain relics of its child  Albano, the path by which the chariot of Marcellus climbed to the  temple of which the last Stewart swept away what time had left--all  these seem naturally to form a group and a subject by themselves. So  may the objects for which Velletri supplies the best centre,--the  hill, the walls, the temples of Cori, \"Norba's ancient wall,\" with  neither an inhabitant nor an habitation within it--Ninfa's more modern  wall, equally without an inhabitant, but with ruined habitations,  ruined churches, in abundance--all these may be connected with an  _iter ad Brundisium_, but they hardly form an actual part of it. Let  our traveller design to start in modern fashion by railway--we were  going to say in prosaic modern fashion, only no way of going could  well be more prosaic than that followed by Horace; let him study his  time-tables, and he will find that he can, if so minded, visit Segni  and go back to Rome in a single day; he can hardly do so by Anagni.  Not that we should counsel such a way of dealing with the walks, the  gates, the temple-foundations, that crown the height of Signia. It  would most likely be found possible to sleep at Segni. Gsell-fels,  prince of guidebook-makers, recommends the _locanda_ there as \"reinlich  und eidlich,\" and the second adjective does not mean that the traveller  will be in any danger of being sworn at. Still some may be more  inclined to go to Segni and back again from Velletri, where there is  no doubt as to living quite happily at the sign of the Cock. Anagni,  Anagnia of the Hernicans, is the beginning of something new. It is  the first point distinctly beyond the neighbourhood of Rome. It is  not unlikely then that such a traveller as we have supposed may make  Anagni his first halting-place. And at Anagni he may certainly rest  for the night, though his quarters may be a comedown not only from Rome  but from Velletri. But if, by any chance, he takes the earlier points  in some other course; above all, if he visits Segni by any course, he  will be all the more open to visit Anagni. The city of Boniface VIII.,  almost beckons to him to cross the valley and the stream. For it is  as the city of Boniface VIII., the place where he so strangely met  his end, the prisoner--not the last Pope who was fated so to be--of  a French ruler, that Anagni will most likely present itself to the  mind. In mediaeval history Anagni is a thoroughly Papal city, and to  this day it keeps a Papal impress on its buildings, a Papal impress  meaning something different at Anagni from what it means at Rome.  Anagni did not remain a favourite Papal dwelling-place; it therefore  did not suffer at the hands of _Renaissance_ Popes as Rome lived to  suffer. But, even in the first glimpse of the hill-city, we may well  go back to much earlier times. We may remember that first Pyrrhos,  then Hannibal, halted thither, each on his vain march towards the Rome  which neither was to conquer. And when we have reached Hannibal and  Pyrrhos, we may go back to earlier ages. There is a point of view in  which Anagnia is, before all things, the head of the confederation  of the Hernicans. There is no people of ancient Italy of whom it is  harder to get any distinct idea than this stout hill folk. In treading  Old-Latin or Volscian ground we can, even without book, call up a few  personal names, a few personal figures, of particular Volscians or  Old-Latins; we cannot call up the name of a single Hernican, historical  or legendary. All that we know of them is their geographical position,  and the one great event in their political history; and those tell us  a great deal. They must have been a people of no small account whom  Spurius Cassius thought worthy to fill the third place in the great  Triple League along with Rome and Latium. And this, though, as having  neither one great city like Rome, nor a crowd of cities like Latium,  they hardly seem to form a power on the level with their two comrades.  But their geographical position gave them a special importance. Thrust  in as they were between AEquians and Volscians, no alliance could  be more precious than theirs to Rome and Latium. They were the most  exposed member of the League, the outpost of Latium, as Latium itself  was the outpost of Rome. Of all the three, the brunt of the struggle  must have fallen most fiercely upon them; the hills of Anagni must  have looked down on many a fierce struggle with the invading occupants  of the opposite range of mountains. The walls of Anagni must have  endured or yielded to many a fierce attack of their ever-threatening  neighbours. As we look out from one of the heights of this region to  another, we better understand the political relations of the endless  little communities which thus lived on in one another's sight. The  ally or the enemy was close at the door; there was not even any need  to climb up an akropolis to see what was coming in the way of attack  or deliverance. Rome and Veii could not see one another; between them  therefore there could be long periods of simple peace, without warfare  and without alliance. Rome and Tusculum could see one another; but  they were not, so to speak, ostentatiously thrust into one another's  sight. But look out from Segni, and your chief business is to look at  Anagni; look out from Anagni, and your chief business is to look either  at Segni or at Ferentino, according to which way you are looking. If  in some lights the long circuit of Segni on its mountain-top is less  clearly seen, the lesser hill of Gavignano shows itself in front as  its symbol or substitute. Cities standing in this relation to one  another could not fail to be either bitter enemies or close allies.  They must be always doing something to one another in the way either  of friendship or of enmity. It was then no small stroke of policy when  Spurius Cassius, of whom it has been so truly said that he was the  first Roman whose greatness is really historical, won the Hernican land  and its head Anagnia to the alliance of Rome and Latium. He did indeed  put a bit in the mouth of the advancing Volscian.    We come then to Hernican Anagnia, Papal Anagni, to a hill-city girded  in by mighty walls. The hill of Anagni is not, like the hills of Segni  and Norba, an actual piece of the mountain itself; it is a hill, an  isolated hill, a hill so large that, no less than at Segni and Norba,  the city is wholly on the height; the walls merely fence in the  hill-top. That hill-top is in some parts wonderfully narrow; in the  middle of the town there is hardly more than the width of the chief  street between the slopes on either side. And at its eastern end the  hill rises to form a truer akropolis, with a steeper path up to it,  than can be seen at Segni or Norba. Round the whole of this space,  allowing for some late patchings, run the ancient walls of Anagnia,  and a mighty and wonderful work they are. But who built them? We must  confess that we walked round about them and, as we thought, marked well  their bulwarks, in the full belief that we were studying the works  of the ancient Hernicans. Let no one fancy that we did not mark the  difference between the walls of Anagnia and the strange and mysterious  forms which may be seen at Cori and Segni. The walls of Anagni bring  us back within the ordinary range of wall-building as practised by  ordinary mortals. Hernican Anagnia did not come within either Lord  Macaulay's Latin or his Etruscan catalogue; but, had it done so, there  would have been no temptation to speak of its bulwarks as \"no work of  earthly men,\" or as--         Reared by the hands of giants         For godlike kings of old.    The walls of Anagni are wonderful only as the great works of Rome  are wonderful. They are built by men to whom it was more natural to  put together rectangular stones with some kind of regularity than it  was to pile together huge polygons anyhow. They were built by men who  thoroughly understood the principle of the arch, and knew how to use  it with all boldness. They remain, in various degrees of preservation,  round the greater part of the circuit of the town. In some parts they  are broken down altogether; in some they are supplanted, in others  merely patched, by walls of later date; in short, they have gone  through all the casualties which a wall is likely to go through in the  course of two millenniums or so; but the wall of modern Anagni, as a  whole, is still the old wall of Anagnia. The construction differs a  good deal in different parts as to the size of the stones and as to  their nature, and as to the degree of rudeness or finish in the work.  In some parts the wall stands single; in others it is strengthened by  further defences, buttresses rather than towers--defences, by-the-way,  which must be carefully distinguished from the additions of later  times. But one general character reigns throughout. The stones,  greater and smaller, smoother and rougher, are always rectangular, and  always laid with some measure of regularity. In some cases ranges of  larger and smaller stones alternate; in one part of the wall stones  of two natures and colours almost alternate. The chief material is a  light-coloured stone exactly like the _puff-stone_ of Gloucestershire,  the material of Berkeley Castle and of not a few other buildings  in that neighbourhood. This is eked out here and there by the dark  volcanic _peperino_, which, towards"]]]
