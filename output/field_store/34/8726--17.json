I have for a long time felt a weariness and  distaste for the life I am leading, without a notion or a hope of  anything better; I do not know why, except that at thirty one begins to  tire of the eternal sameness of the mess table, country quarters, slow  promotion, and no very particular occupation. Up to five and twenty,  military life may have its charms, but then it begins to lose its _soi  disant_ attractions. I suppose it was the dearth of variety, and the  vain hope of getting up something like excitement, that induced me to  make a fool of myself by plunging into various extravagances of late;  they will cost me dear enough; I wish they had put me to a desk instead  of buying me a commission. It's too bad to think that at my age I am no  further on in the world than I was at eighteen, and unfit for anything  except leading a charge or riding a steeple chase; and the brute that  gave us a great dinner the other day, and bored Sedley about his 'Ock,'  what was his name? 'Mogg?' ay Mogg! How old do you think the savage?\"    \"Fifty-five, perhaps.\"    \"Not more than twenty-five years my senior, and began life, as an  errand boy! I should like to know what and where I shall be at  fifty-five; a wretched old half-pay; speculating how long I can make  a ten-and-sixpenny hat last; with a bed-room in Leicester Square, and  my address at the Senior United Service Club; and mine was a boyhood of  _bon bons_, bowing tutors, and Shetland ponies.\"    \"Why, Egerton, you are quite eloquent! I think your excursion to A----  has only served to open your eyes to the miseries you were before  unconscious of; I'd prefer happy ignorance; I conclude the English  of all this is, that Miss Vernon's angelic voice and beautiful eyes  incline you to matrimony, while common sense warns you off, eh?\"    \"Pshaw! nonsense! I am not going to declare Miss Vernon is essential to  my existence; I dare say I shall have to scramble through life without  such companionship; but I do not hesitate to say, I would be a happier  man if I thought I had a chance of it; ay, and a better one,\" I added,  after a pause. \"I might have some pretension to think of matrimony but  for my own confounded folly in incumbering my younger son's portion,  as I have done;\" and I stuck the spurs into my unfortunate horse's  sides, who resented the injustice, by a series of wild plunges, and  gave me some trouble to reduce him to order.    After walking our horses on for a few paces in silence, Burton said  gravely, \"I see this is more serious than I at first thought, but  whatever your feelings may be, for God's sake, do not rush into any  imprudent marriage; it is the most fatal mistake any man ever made;  there's not one in a thousand who has the stuff in him to stand its  accompaniments unflinchingly; a hundred to one but the consciousness  of having dragged himself and the woman he loved into such a scrape,  sours his temper and makes him a brute to his wife and a tyrant to  his children. I have seen such examples, that I do believe the best  proof of affection a poor man can give, is to fly at the first fire  from Cupid's battery; and my advice to you is to avoid A---- and its  attractions. Do not go on looking and insinuating a thousand things  you can never accomplish; but which, in spite of all we say of their  inconstancy, live in a girl's memory for many a day after we have  forgotten all about it.\"    \"By Jove! I must be a more conceited fellow than any in England, if  I could for a moment imagine that Miss Vernon would waste a thought  on me when I was out of her sight; I wish you could just hear her  easy unembarrassed way of begging me to be sure to return; it was the  coolest address I ever received from a young lady; her heart and mind  seem too well filled to be easily accessible; yet--but I dare not try;  you speak truly, Burton, about imprudent marriages; still, I think, it  would be worth a struggle to get my affairs into training. I would not  ask any woman to marry into poverty, but one might be satisfied with  competence and\"--    \"Just the way all men argue when they want to do a foolish act; what  would be competence to a man of your habits?\"    \"Nevertheless, I'll think about it, and look up Egerton; he ought  to have bowels of compassion for his brother as well as for every  benighted blackamoor under the sun; and his expenses are, I believe,  limited to subscribing to all kinds of Evangelical Missions.\"    \"Do you mean then seriously to contemplate ----?\"    \"Burton! pray do not look so dismal; I tell you it's a long look out; I  do not know what I shall do.\"    \"You'll go over to A---- in spite of my warning?\"    \"Oh, I must; I promised Miss Vernon; believe me, I am the only one  likely to suffer from my imprudence; and then I will return no more  till I have seen Egerton; or--in short, let us just cross the country  here, the corn seems all cut, and it will break in the horses for the  hunting.\"    In accordance with my determination, I seized the first interval in a  rather professional conversation between Colonel Dashwood and a retired  General he had invited to dinner, to tell him of my accidental meeting  with his old acquaintance; sinking the fact, however, of his having a  grand-daughter.    \"What, old D'Arcy Vernon, of Dungar,\" he exclaimed; \"how curious! and  so he is living there, is he? I am sorry to hear it, he must have left  Dungar then _in toto_?\"    \"Or Dungar left him,\" sneered Hauton. \"It was _en route_, if I am not  much mistaken, when we were there.\"    \"The first day I can, I'll go over to A----, and bring back the  old Colonel with me,\" said our good natured Commander. \"I owe him  a vast amount of hospitality, and shall be too glad to show him I  have not forgotten it; poor fellow! at his age; he must be more than  seventy-five!\"    \"He looks remarkably well,\" I said, \"just the same as ever.\"    \"The Irish have such happy temperaments,\" said Dashwood, turning to the  General.    \"Yes, they are like the Niggers in many respects,\" said Hauton; \"the  more you beat them the better they be.\"    I restrained my inclination to shy a decanter at his head with great  difficulty.    The ten succeeding days went over wonderfully well; I found the  promised drawings of Dungar for Kate, and worked up the sketch I had  taken of the Priory, to the very best of my abilities. I took long  rides with Burton, and often without him, not finding him so congenial  as I wished. I wrote a long letter to my sister, and made all proper  enquiries for Lady Desmond, without, however, explaining the cause of  my curiosity. It was so long since I had seen Mary; I did not know how  her heart had stood the wear and tear of four years' dissipation. How  fond we were of each other, as children!    Finally, I wrote to Colonel Vernon, telling him about Dashwood and all  the gossip I could think would amuse him; sending a message to Kate as  to the drawings, and promising to be over with them in the course of  the following week.    Altogether, I was much too busy to look into my own affairs, but  promised myself to overhaul them completely on my return from A----. I  secured a week's leave, and determined to throw care to the dogs, and  enjoy myself thoroughly. I started before almost any one, except Burton  (whose habits were quiet and regular), was visible. He joined me as  I stood on the steps, while my servant was placing my carpet bag and  portfolio in the cab which was to convey me to the Railway.    \"So you're going, are you?\"        \"Whatever skies above,      Here's a heart for any fate!\"    Said I, laughing, and too much elated at the week's freedom and  enjoyment before me to be damped by his lugubrious tone. We shook  hands, and I left him whistling with a reflective air.    I little thought where we would meet again.          CHAPTER VII.    MAN PROPOSES, GOD DISPOSES.      Though I loitered about at the Hotel as much as possible, I found I had  made the usual mistake of impatient people; wasted as much time by too  rapid as by too slow a movement; and it still wanted some minutes to  twelve o'clock when I took the now familiar path to the Priory, smiling  to myself at the natural home-like feeling with which I looked forward  to seeing them all again. It is extraordinary what rapid strides to  intimacy sympathy enables one to make! All was profoundly still in the  churchyard as I opened the wicket and bent my head to enter the low  arch. All looked as neat and well kept as ever.    Nurse answered my ring, in bonnet and cloak, and welcomed me with a  joyous \"Ah! Captin jew'l, is it yerself that's in it?\"    Her loud exclamations brought Miss Vernon to the drawing-room door. She  paused for a moment; and, then advancing, seconded nurse's greeting  very warmly.    \"We did not expect you quite so soon; and grandpapa has gone with Mr.  Winter to look at a farm of his a little way out of the town; I hope  Cyclops will not upset them,\" she added, laughing. \"I am so glad you  are come.\"    \"And I have been counting the hours till I escaped from Carrington to  the ecclesiastical repose of your retreat,\" said I, following her into  the the drawing room, as usual redolent of flowers.    \"You are the most tranquilly disposed Dragoon I ever met,\" she  returned; \"but I see you have got your portfolio.\"    \"Yes, I have brought you the sketches you wished for.\"    \"Oh, thank you, Captain Egerton, it is so good of you; you do not know  what pleasure you give me; let me look at them.\"    \"Here is a view of the house from the east.\"    \"Oh yes, yes, how like! that was my school room window, and the flower  garden"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47449"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 8 (of 8) (#15)"],[1," words: \"In itself acknowledging no single form of Government  as the only suitable form, and whilst acknowledging the form of  Government existing at present, it (the Bond) means that the aim of our  national development must be a United South Africa under its own flag.\"  With the subtlety which always distinguished the party, a change was  made in this some years afterwards.    The language of the Bond organ, _De Patriot_, is perfectly explicit, and  shows very clearly the spirit and intentions of the party. The English  must be boycotted. There must be no English shops, signboards,  advertisements, or bookkeepers. Manufacture of munitions of war must be  started in the two Republics. \"At Heidelberg there are already 4000  cartridges made daily, and a few skilful Africanders have begun to make  shells too. That is right; so we must become a nation.\" It must be  considered a disgrace to speak English, and war must be waged in the  Church against that language. \"It is the Dutch Reformed Church. What has  England to do with it?\" In family life no quarter was to be given.    [Illustration: THE LOW VELDT FROM BOTHA'S HILL    Photo by Wilson, Aberdeen]    As we have already said, the junction of the Farmers' Protection Society  with the Bond exercised a moderating influence, but the spirit,  intentions, and object of the party remained the same, although Mr.  J. H. Hofmeyr attempted, in a manner as astute as it was dangerous, to  unite the Dutch and English people in South Africa in a common  antagonism to Great Britain's power, influence, and presence. Even Mr.  Merriman saw through this trick, as he declared in a speech delivered at  Grahamstown in 1885. \"It is now the cue of the Bond to pretend to be  loyal, and if it were not painful it would be ridiculous to hear the  editor of _De Zuid Afrikaan_ cheering the Queen, and to hear Du Toit  praying for her while resolutions are passed round to the branches in  direct opposition to the honour of England.... Each one of you will have  to make up his mind whether he is prepared to see the colony remain a  part of the British Empire, which carries with it obligations as well as  privileges, or whether he is prepared to obey the dictates of the Bond.  From the very first time, some years ago, when first the poison began to  be distilled in this country, I felt that it must come to this: Was  England or the Transvaal to be the paramount force in South Africa?...  What could they think of the objects of the Bond when they found Judge  Reitz advocating a Republic of South Africa under one flag?... No one  who wishes well to the British Government could have read the leading  articles of the _Zuid Afrikaan_ and _Express_ and _De Patriot_, in  expounding the Bond principles, without seeing that the maintenance of  law and order under the British Crown and the object they have in view  are absolutely different things.... My quarrel with the Bond is that it  stirs up race difference. Its main object is to make the South African  Republic the paramount power in South Africa.\"    To do justice to the Bond, we must quote Mr. Theron, their secretary,  who is reported by the _South African News_ of May 5, 1900, to have  said:--    \"One other question may be asked, 'What is the object of the Bond?' My  reply is, its object, its only object, is expressed in sec. 2 of the  General Constitution, which is worded as follows: 'The nearest object of  the Bond is the formation of a South African Nationality by means of  union and co-operation, as a preparation for the ultimate object, a  united South Africa. The Bond tries to attain this object by  constitutional means, giving to respective governments and legislatures  all the support they are entitled to, and respecting everybody's  rights.'\" This was perfectly understood. It was a Dutch Nationality and  a Dutch Republican South Africa that was aimed at, and the context fully  proved this assertion when the vast majority of the Bond party fought  against England, either as belligerents in the Republics or as  rebels--active and passive--within the Cape Colony. Nine out of every  ten ministers of the Dutch Reformed Church were rebels, according to  the testimony of one of their own number--the Rev. Mr. Vlok of  Piquetberg. In such circumstances it is impossible to come to any other  conclusion than that the departure from the original, straightforward  declaration of the aims of the Bond was nothing but a diplomatic effort  to throw dust in the eyes of the enemy.    Certainly such a man as Mr. Cronwright Schreiner was in no way deceived  by this attitude, as we find him saying in 1893[8] that the Africander  Bond is anti-English in its aims; its officers and its language are  Dutch, and it is striving to gain such power as absolutely to control  the Cape Parliament. It had \"paralysed our political life.\" \"In fact,\"  he goes on to say, \"the Bond has sacrificed the welfare of the country  for years to the selfish attainment of one object, namely, the supremacy  of the Dutch-speaking inhabitants of the Cape Colony, regardless of the  rights of others; the imagined good of an ignorant clique of the Dutch  has been preferred to the good of the country. These men must not have  power; they are wholly unfit to have it. The Bond is a body striving  solely for its own benighted ends, and founded and conducted on race  lines.\" This was a correct judgment passed from the English Cape Colony  farmer's point of view; men who, quite unlike the pro-Boers in England,  perfectly understood their subject by means of adequate evidence  obtained on the spot, as well as by bitter personal experience.    Can anything be more significant than the following facts. The Hon. Mr.  Bellingan, a Dutch member of the Legislative Council, in the session  immediately previous to the war is reported by the _Cape Times_ to have  said: \"If the policy of annexation were adhered to, they (the  Africanders) would take advantage of England's calamity;\" while the Bond  paper, _Ons Land_, reports the honourable member as saying that when the  Queen came to die and storms burst over the empire the Africanders would  not side with England if the Republics were annexed. Then the member  himself, in a letter to the _Cape Times_, declared that what he said  was: \"He saw difficulty for the British Empire after the death of our  beloved Queen. By giving the Republicans their independence England  could reckon upon them as friends, but if the Republics were annexed she  could not do so.\"    The Bond undoubtedly during many years prepared the materials for a  conflagration. The great never-dying, ever-present aspiration was fully  expressed in its motto, \"Africa for the Africanders.\" It was nothing if  not diplomatic, and professed very loudly a loyalty which showed itself  in its true colours when the Bond party was in power just prior to the  war. Then we find its aims exhibited by the Bond party in Parliament,  backed up by the Bond Congress, fighting most strenuously against the  absurdly lenient provisions of the Treason Bill.    As Mr. Theo. Schreiner aptly says, \"Rebellion in fact is no rebellion in  the eyes of the Bond so long as it be in accord with the Africander  national ideal.\" The ministers of their political party allowed  ammunition and guns to be carried to the Republics over the railways of  the Colony in immense quantities, and the W. P. Schreiner ministry was  split up rather than consent to the very mild punishment of deprivation  of the franchise being inflicted on rebels. Then came the war, when a  large majority of the Bond party were either active or passive rebels.    But no one more clearly points out the real objects of the Bond than Mr.  Reitz, one of its original founders, and to the end one of its principal  leaders. He does not hesitate to say in his brochure entitled \"A Century  of Wrong,\" largely circulated in more than one language over the  continent of Europe:--    \"May the hope which glowed in our hearts during 1880, and which buoyed  us up during that struggle, burn on steadily. May it prove a beacon of  light in our path, invincibly moving onwards through blood and through  tears until it leads us to a real union of South Africa.... Whether the  result be victory or death, liberty will assuredly rise in South Africa  ... just as freedom dawned over the United States of America a little  more than a century ago. Then from Zambesi to Simonstown it will be  'AFRICA FOR THE AFRICANDER.'\"    A Bond object-lesson was really to be seen in a practical manner in the  South African Republic under the rule of Dutch Africanders. There indeed  the Transvaal portion of Africa was clearly ruled for one section of the  population--the Africander--to the utter exclusion of the rights of the  English population largely in a majority within Johannesburg. There was  an election system leading to the corrupt and unjust rule of Boer Raads  and a Boer oligarchy. Protection, Concessions, the Master and Servants  Acts were all managed in accordance with Africander ideas. Bond views of  native policy were carried out in such a way that no coloured person  however civilised could vote, nor hold title to fixed property nor trade  freely, nor even marry as white people might. All this found  encouragement in the Cape Colony, and eventually the absurd fiction of  Boers fighting for liberty in the Transvaal was proclaimed as a fact  over all Europe, although literally they commenced a war in which they  felt sure of success for the purpose of subverting liberty and obtaining  complete freedom to carry on government by a section of the people  purely for the interests of a section--the Africanders--ignoring  altogether equal rights for all other men.    When we consider clearly and definitely all the facts, remember that  history repeats itself and that the Africanders are profoundly tenacious  of their political opinions and have proved themselves to be a people  who are able "]]]
