In an earlier, less civilized age, he would  have been expert with sword and stick, I could not doubt. A man who  could capture the hearts of women with a look. He had always been to me  a romantic figure, and a mystery that seemed to shroud him made him no  less so.    A friendship had sprung up between Derek Mason and me, perhaps because  we were such opposite types! I am an American, of medium height, and  medium build. Ruddy, with sandy hair. Derek Mason was as meticulous of  his clothes, his swagger uniforms, as the most perfect Beau Brummel. Not  so myself. I am careless of dress and speech.    I had not seen Derek Mason for at least a month when, one June  afternoon, a note came from him. I went to his apartment at eight  o'clock the same evening. Even about his home there seemed a mystery. He  lived alone with one man servant. He had taken quarters in a high-class  bachelor apartment building near lower Fifth Avenue, at the edge of  Greenwich Village.    All of which no doubt was rational enough, but in this building he had  chosen the lower apartment at the ground-floor level. It adjoined the  cellar. It was built for the janitor, but Derek had taken it and fixed  it up in luxurious fashion. Near it, in a corner of the cellar, he had  boarded off a square space into a room. I understood vaguely that it was  a chemical laboratory. He had never discussed it, nor had I ever been  shown inside it. Unusual, mysterious enough, and that a captain of the  British military should be an experimental scientist was even more  unusual. Yet I had always believed that for a year or two Derek had been  engaged in some sort of chemical or physical experiment. With all his  military swagger he had the precise, careful mode of thought  characteristic of the man of scientific mind.           *       *       *       *       *    I recall that when I got his note with its few sentences bidding me come  to see him, I had a premonition that it marked the beginning of  something strange. As though the portals of a mystery were opening to  me!    Nothing is impossible! Nevertheless I record these events into which I  was plunged that June evening with a very natural reluctance. I expect  no credibility. If this were the year 2000, my narrative doubtless would  be tame enough. Yet in 1929 it can only be called a fantasy. Let it go  at that. The fantasy of to-day is the sober truth of to-morrow. And by  the day after, it is a mere platitude. Our world moves swiftly.    Derek received me in his living-room. He admitted me himself. He told me  that his man servant was out. It was a small room, with leather-covered  easy chairs, rugs on its hardwood floor, and sober brown portieres at  its door and windows. A brown parchment shade shrouded the electrolier  on the table. It was the only light in the room. It cast its mellow  sheen upon Derek's lean graceful figure as he flung himself down and  produced cigarettes.    He said, \"Charlie, I want a little talk with you. I've something to tell  you--something to offer you.\"    He held his lighter out to me, with its tiny blue alcohol flame under my  cigarette. And I saw that his hand was trembling.           *       *       *       *       *    \"But I don't understand what you mean,\" I protested.    He retorted, \"I'm suggesting that you might be tired of being a clerk in  a brokerage office. Tired of this humdrum world that we call  civilization. Tired of Wall Street.\"    \"I am, Derek. Heavens, that's true enough.\"    His eyes held me. He was smiling half whimsically: his voice was only  half serious. Yet I could see, in the smoldering depths of those  luminous dark eyes, a deadly seriousness that belied his smiling lips  and his gay tone.    He interrupted me with, \"And I offer you a chance for deeds of high  adventuring. The romance of danger, of pitting your wits against  villainy to make right triumph over wrong, and to win for yourself power  and riches--and perhaps a fair lady....\"    \"Derek, you talk like a swashbuckler of the middle ages.\"    I thought he would grin, but he turned suddenly solemn.    \"I'm offering to make you henchman to a king, Charlie.\"    \"King of what? Where?\"    He spread his lean brown hands with a gesture. He shrugged. \"What  matter? If you seek adventure, you can find it--somewhere. If you feel  the lure of romance--it will come to you.\"    I said, \"Henchman to a king?\"    But still he would not smile. \"Yes. If I were king. I'm serious.  Absolutely. In all this world there is no one who cares a damn about me.  Not in this world, but....\"    He checked himself. He went on, \"You are the same. You have no  relatives?\"    \"No. None that ever think of me.\"    \"Nor a sweetheart. Or have you?\"    \"No,\" I smiled. \"Not yet. Maybe never.\"    \"But you are too interested in Wall Street to leave it for the open  road?\" He was sarcastic now. \"Or do you fear deeds of daring? Do you  want to right a great wrong? Rescue an oppressed people, overturn the  tyranny of an evil monarch, and put your friend and the girl he loves  upon the throne? Or do you want to go down to work as usual in the  subway to-morrow morning? Are you afraid that in this process of  becoming henchman to a king you may perchance get killed?\"    I matched his caustic tone. \"Let's hear it, Derek.\"          CHAPTER II    _The Challenge of the Unknown_      Incredible! Impossible! I did not say it, though my thoughts were  written on my face, no doubt.    Derek said quietly, \"Difficult to believe, Charlie? Yes! But it happens  to be true. The girl I love is not of this world, but she lives  nevertheless. I have seen her, talked with her. A slim little  thing--beautiful....\"    He sat staring. \"This is nothing supernatural, Charlie. Only  the ignorant savages of our past called the unknown--the  unusual--supernatural. We know better now.\"    I said, \"This girl--\"    He gestured. \"As I told you, I have for years been working on the theory  that there is another world, existing here in this same space with us.  The Fourth Dimension! Call it that it you like. I have found it, proved  its existence! And this girl--her name is Hope--lives in it. Let me tell  you about her and her people. Shall I?\"    My heart was pounding so that it almost smothered me. \"Yes, Derek.\"    \"She lives here, in this Space we call New York City. She and her people  use this same Space at the same time that we use it. A different world  from ours, existing here now with us! Unseen by us. And we are unseen by  them!    \"A different form of matter, Charlie. As tangible to the people of the  other realm as we are to our own world. Humans like ourselves.\"    He paused, but I could find no words to fill the gap. And presently he  went on:    \"Hope's world, co-existing here with us, is dependent upon us. They  speak what we call English. They shadow us.\"    I murmured, \"Phantoms of reality.\"    \"Yes. A world very like ours. But primitive, where ours is civilized.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He paused again. His eyes were staring past me as though he could see  through the walls of the cellar room into great reaches of the unknown.  What a strange mixture was this Derek Mason! What a strange compound of  the cold reality of the scientist and the fancy of the romantic dreamer!  Yet I wonder if that is not what science is. There is no romantic lover  gawping at the moon who could have more romance in his soul, or see in  the moonlit eyes of his loved one more romance than the scientist finds  in the wonders of his laboratory.    Derek went on slowly:    \"A primitive world, primitive nation, primitive passions! As I see it  now, Charlie--as I know it to be--it seems as though perhaps Hope's  world is merely a replica of ours, stripped to the primitive. As though  it might be the naked soul of our modern New York, ourselves as we  really are, not as we pretend to be.\"    He roused himself from his reverie.    \"Hope's nation is ruled by a king. An emperor, if you like. A monarch,  beset with the evils of luxury and ease, and wine and women. He is  surrounded by his nobles, the idle aristocracy, by virtue of their birth  proclaiming themselves of too fine a clay to work. The crimson nobles,  they are called. Because they affect crimson cloaks, and their beautiful  women, voluptuous, sex-mad, are wont to bedeck themselves in veils and  robes of crimson.    \"And there are workers, toilers they call them. Oppressed, down-trodden  toilers, with hate for the nobles and the king smoldering within them.  In France there was such a condition, and the bloody revolution came of  it. It exists here now. Hope was born in the ranks of these toilers, but  has risen by her grace and beauty to a position in the court of this  graceless monarch.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He leaped from his chair and began pacing the room. I sat silent,  staring at him. So strange a thing! Impossible? I could not say that. I  could only say, incredible to me. And as I framed the thought I knew its  incredibility was the very measure of my limited intelligence, my lack  of knowledge. The vast unknown of nature, so vast that everything which  was real to me, understandable to me, was a mere drop in the ocean of  the existing unknown.    \"Don't you understand me now?\" Derek added vehemently. \"I'm not talking  fantasy. Cold reality! I've found a way to transport myself--and  you--into this different state of matter, into this other world! I've  already made a test. I went there and stayed just for a few moments, a  night or so ago.\"    It made my heart leap wildly. He went on:--    \"There is chaos there. Smoldering revolution which at any time--to-night  perhaps--may burst into conflagration and destroy this wanton ruling  class.\" He laughed harshly. \"In Hope's world the workers are a primitive,  ignorant people. Superstitious.
