[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38777"],[0,"Lad: A Dog (#15)"],[1," struggled crazily to break away. Lad stood his  ground like a furry martyr, and awaited his fate.    In an hour or so the ride ended. The car drew up at Madison Square--beside  the huge yellowish building, arcaded and Diana-capped, which  goes by the name of \"Garden\" and which is as nearly historic as  any landmark in feverish New York is permitted to be.    Ever since the car had entered Manhattan Island, unhappy Lad's  nostrils had been aquiver with a million new and troublous odors. Now,  as the car halted, these myriad strange smells were lost in one--an  all-pervasive scent of dog. To a human, out there in the street, the  scent was not observable. To a dog it was overwhelming.    Lad, at the Master's word, stepped down from the tonneau onto the  sidewalk. He stood there, dazedly sniffing. The plangent roar of the  city was painful to his ears, which had always been attuned to the  deep silences of forest and lake. And through this din he caught the  muffled noise of the chorused barks and howls of many of his own kind.    The racket that bursts so deafeningly on humans as they enter the  Garden, during a dog-show, was wholly audible to Lad out in the street  itself. And, as instinct or scent makes a hog flinch at going into a  slaughterhouse, so the gallant dog's spirit quailed for a moment as he  followed the Mistress and the Master into the building.    A man who is at all familiar with the ways of dogs can tell at once  whether a dog's bark denotes cheer or anger or terror or grief or  curiosity. To such a man a bark is as expressive of meanings as are  the inflections of a human voice. To another dog these meanings are  far more intelligible. And in the timbre of the multiple barks and  yells that now assailed his ears, Lad read nothing to allay his own  fears.    He was the hero of a half-dozen hard-won fights. He had once risked  his life to save life. He had attacked tramps and peddlers and other  stick-wielding invaders who had strayed into the grounds of The  Place. Yet the tiniest semblance of fear now crept into his heart.    He looked up at the Mistress, a world of sorrowing appeal in his  eyes. At her gentle touch on his head and at a whisper of her loved  voice, he moved onward at her side with no further hesitation. If  these, his gods, were leading him to death, he would not question  their right to do it, but would follow on as befitted a good soldier.    Through a doorway they went. At a wicket a yawning veterinary glanced  uninterestedly at Lad. As the dog had no outward and glaring signs of  disease, the vet' did not so much as touch him, but with a nod  suffered him to pass. The vet' was paid to inspect all dogs as they  entered the show. Perhaps some of them were turned back by him,  perhaps not; but after this, as after many another show, scores of  kennels were swept by distemper and by other canine maladies, scores  of deaths followed. That is one of the risks a dog-exhibitor must  take--or rather that his luckless dogs must take--in spite of the fees  paid to yawning veterinaries to bar out sick entrants.    As Lad passed in through the doorway, he halted involuntarily in  dismay. Dogs--dogs--DOGS! More than two thousand of them, from Great  Dane to toy terrier, benched in row after row throughout the vast  floor-space of the Garden! Lad had never known there were so many dogs  on earth.    Fully five hundred of them were barking or howling. The hideous volume  of sound swelled to the Garden's vaulted roof and echoed back again  like innumerable hammer-blows upon the eardrum.    The Mistress stood holding Lad's chain and softly caressing the  bewildered dog, while the Master went to make inquiries. Lad pressed  his shaggy body closer to her knee for refuge, as he gazed blinkingly  around him.    In the Garden's center were several large inclosures of wire and  reddish wood. Inside each inclosure were a table, a chair and a  movable platform. The platform was some six inches high and four feet  square. At corners of these \"judging-rings\" were blackboards on which  the classes next to be inspected were chalked up.    All around the central space were alleys, on each side of which were  lines of raised \"benches,\" two feet from the ground. The benches were  carpeted with straw and were divided off by high wire partitions into  compartments about three feet in area. Each compartment was to be the  abiding-place of some unfortunate dog for the next four days and  nights. By short chains the dogs were bound into these open-fronted  cells.    The chains left their wearers just leeway enough to stand up or lie  down or to move to the various limits of the tiny space. In front of  some of the compartments a wire barrier was fastened. This meant that  the occupant was savage--in other words, that under the four-day  strain he was likely to resent the stares or pokes or ticklings or  promiscuous alien pattings of fifty thousand curious visitors.    The Master came back with a plumply tipped attendant. Lad was  conducted through a babel of yapping and snapping thoroughbreds of all  breeds, to a section at the Garden's northeast corner, above which, in  large black letters on a white sign, was inscribed \"COLLIES.\" Here his  conductors stopped before a compartment numbered \"658.\"    \"Up, Laddie!\" said the Mistress, touching the straw-carpeted bench.    Usually, at this command, Lad was wont to spring to the indicated  height--whether car-floor or table-top--with the lightness of a  cat. Now, one foot after another, he very slowly climbed into the  compartment he was already beginning to detest--the cell which was  planned to be his only resting-spot for four interminable days. There  he, who had never been tied, was ignominiously chained as though he  were a runaway puppy. The insult bit to the depths of his sore  soul. He curled down in the straw.    The Mistress made him as comfortable as she could. She set before him  the breakfast she had brought and told the attendant to bring him some  water.    The Master, meantime, had met a collie man whom he knew, and in  company with this acquaintance he was walking along the collie-section  examining the dogs tied there. A dozen times had the Master visited  dog-shows; but now that Lad was on exhibition, he studied the other  collies with new eyes.    \"Look!\" he said boastfully to his companion, pausing before a bench  whereon were chained a half-dozen dogs from a single illustrious  kennel. \"These fellows aren't in it with old Lad. See--their noses  are tapered like tooth-picks, and the span of their heads, between the  ears, isn't as wide as my palm; and their eyes are little and they  slant like a Chinaman's; and their bodies are as curved as a  grayhound's. Compared with Lad, some of them are freaks. That's all  they are, just freaks--not all of them, of course, but a lot of them.\"    \"That's the idea nowadays,\" laughed the collie man patronizingly. \"The  up-to-date collie--this year's style, at least--is bred with a borzoi  (wolfhound) head and with graceful, small bones. What's the use of  his having brain and scenting-power? He's used for exhibition or kept  as a pet nowadays--not to herd sheep. Long nose, narrow head----\"    \"But Lad once tracked my footsteps two miles through a snowstorm,\"  bragged the Master; \"and again on a road where fifty people had walked  since I had; and he understands the meaning of every simple word.  He----\"    \"Yes?\" said the collie man, quite unimpressed. \"Very interesting--but  not useful in a show. Some of the big exhibitors still care for sense  in their dogs, and they make companions of them--Eileen Moretta, for  instance, and Fred Leighton and one or two more; but I find most of  the rest are just out for the prizes. Let's have a look at your dog.  Where is he?\"    On the way down the alley toward Cell 658 they met the worried  Mistress.    \"Lad won't eat a thing,\" she reported, \"and he wouldn't eat before we  left home this morning, either. He drinks plenty of water, but he  won't eat. I'm afraid he's sick.\"    \"They hardly ever eat at a show,\" the collie man consoled her, \"hardly  a mouthful--most of the high-strung ones, but they drink quarts of  water. This is your dog, hey?\" he broke off, pausing at 658. \"H'm!\"    He stood, legs apart, hands behind his back, gazing down at Lad. The  dog was lying, head between paws, as before. He did not so much as  glance up at the stranger, but his great wistful eyes roved from the  Mistress to the Master and back again. In all this horrible place they  two alone were his salvation.    \"H'm!\" repeated the collie man thoughtfully. \"Eyes too big and not  enough slanted. Head too thick for length of nose. Ears too far  apart. Eyes too far apart, too. Not enough 'terrier expression' in  them. Too much bone, too much bulk. Wonderful coat, though--glorious  coat! Best coat I've seen this five years. Great brush, too! What's he  entered for? Novice, hey? May get a third with him at that. He's the  true type--but old-fashioned. I'm afraid he's too old-fashioned for  such fast company as he's in. Still, you never can tell. Only it's a  pity he isn't a little more----\"    \"I wouldn't have him one bit different in any way!\" flashed the  Mistress. \"He's perfect as he is. You can't see that, though, because  he isn't himself now. I've never seen him so crushed and woe-begone. I  wish we had never brought him here.\"    \"You can't blame him,\" said the collie man philosophically. \"Why, just  suppose _you_ were brought to a strange place like this and chained  into a cage and were left there four days and nights while hundreds of  other prisoners kept screaming and shouting and crying at the top of  their lungs every minute of the time! And suppose about a hundred  thousand people kept jostling past your cage night and day, rubbering  at you and pointing at you and trying to feel your ears and mouth, and  chirping at you to shake hands, would _you_ feel very hungry or very"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38827"],[0,"Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan, Volume 1 (of 2) (#15)"],[1," to men  as it is to women.    The _haram_ reception-rooms here are large and bright, with roofs and  cornices worked daintily in very white plaster, and there are superb  carpets on the floors, and divans covered with Damascus embroidery in  gold silk on cream muslin.    Each day the demands for my presence in the sick-room are more  frequent, and though I say that I can scarcely aspire to be a nurse,  they persist in thinking that I am a _Haki[=i]m_, and possibly a  useful spy on the doctor. I have become aware that unscrupulous  jealousy of the principal wife exists, and, as is usual in the East,  everybody distrusts everybody else, and prefers to trust strangers.  The husband frequently asks me to remove what seems a cancerous  tumour, and the doctor says that an operation is necessary to save the  lady's life, but when I urge him to perform it, and offer a nurse's  help, he replies that if she were to die he would be at once accused  of murder, and would run a serious risk.    The Governor to-day was so anxious that I should persuade the lady to  undergo an operation that he even brought Hadji into the room to  interpret what I said in Arabic. His ceaseless question is, \"Will she  die?\" and she asks me the same many times every day. She insists that  I shall be present each day when the wound is dressed, and give help,  lest the doctor without her leave should plunge a knife into the  swelling. These are most distressing occasions, for an hour of  struggle and suffering usually ends in delirium.    This afternoon, however, she was much freer from pain, and sent for me  to amuse her. She wore some fine jewels, and some folds of tinselled  gauze round her head, and looked really handsome and intelligent. Her  husband wished that we could converse without his imperfect  interpreting, and repeated many times, \"She is a learned woman, and  can write and read several languages.\" The room was as usual full of  women, who had removed their veils at their lord's command. I showed  the lady some Tibetan sketches, but when I came to one of a man the  women replaced their veils!    When I showed some embroidery, the Governor said he had heard that the  Queen of England employed herself with her needle in leisure hours,  but that it is not _comme il faut_ here for ladies to work. It seems  that the making of sweetmeats is the only occupation which can be  pursued without loss of dignity. Is it wonderful that intolerable  _ennui_ should be productive of the miserable jealousies, rivalries,  intrigues, and hatreds which accompany the system of polygamy?    The host, although civil governor of a large district, also suffers  from _ennui_. The necessary official duties are very light, and the  accounts and reports are prepared by others. If money is wanted he  makes \"an exaction\" on a village, and subordinates screw it out of the  people. Justice, or the marketable commodity which passes for such, is  administered by a _kadi_. He clatters about the balconies with  slippered feet, is domestic, that is, he spends most of the day in the  _haram_, smokes, eats two meals of six or seven courses each, and  towards evening takes a good deal of wine, according to a habit which  is becoming increasingly common among the higher classes of Moslems.  He is hospitable, and is certainly anything but tyrannical in his  household.    The customs and ways of the first Turkish house I have visited in  would be as interesting to you as they were to myself, but it would be  a poor return for hospitality to dwell upon anything, unless, like the  difficulties regarding the illness of the principal wife, it were a  matter of common notoriety.    It is a punishable act in Persia, and possibly here also, to look into  a neighbour's house, but I cannot help it unless I were to avoid the  window altogether. Wealth and poverty are within a few feet of each  other, and as Moslems are charitable to a degree and in a manner  which puts us to shame, the juxtaposition is advantageous.    My neighbour's premises consist of a very small and mean yard, now a  foot deep in black mire, a cow-shed, and a room without door or  windows, with a black uneven floor, and black slimy rafters--neither  worse nor better than many hovels in the Western Isles of Scotland. A  man in middle life, a woman of dubious age, two girls from eight to  ten years old, and a boy a little older are the occupants. The  furniture consists of some wadded quilts, a copper pot, an iron  girdle, a clay ewer or two, a long knife, a wooden spoon, a clay  receptacle for grain, two or three earthenware basins, glazed green,  and a wicker tray. The cow-shed contains--besides the cow, which is  fed on dried thistles--a spade, an open basket, and a baggage pad. A  few fowls live in the house, and are disconcerted to find that they  cannot get out of it without swimming.    The weather is cold and raw, fuel is enormously dear, work is at a  standstill, and cold and _ennui_ keep my neighbours in bed till the  day is well advanced. \"Bed\" consists of a wadded quilt laid on the  floor, with another for a covering. The man and boy sleep at one end  of the room, the woman and girls at the other, with covered heads.  None make any change in their dress at night, except that the man  takes off the _pagri_ of his turban, retaining only a skull cap.    The woman gets up first, lights a fire of tamarisk twigs and thistles  in a hole in the middle of the floor, makes porridge of some coarse  brownish flour and water, and sets it on to warm--to _boil_ it, with  the means at her disposal, is impossible. She wades across the yard,  gives the cow a bunch of thistles, milks it into a basin, adds a  little leaven to the milk, which she shakes in a goat skin till it is  thick, carries the skin and basket to the house, feeds the fowls from  the basket, and then rouses her lord. He rises, stretches himself,  yawns, and places himself cross-legged by the fire, after putting on  his _pagri_. The room is dense with pungent wood smoke, which escapes  through the doorway, and only a few embers remain. The wife hands him  an earthen bowl, pours some porridge into it, adds some \"thick milk\"  from the goat skin, and stands before him with her arms crossed while  he eats, then receives the bowl from his hands and kisses it, as is  usual with the slaves in a household.    Then she lights his pipe, and while he enjoys it she serves her boy  with breakfast in the same fashion, omitting the concluding ceremony,  after which she and the girls retire to a respectful distance with the  big pot, and finish its contents simultaneously. The pipe over, she  pours water on her lord's hands, letting it run on the already damp  floor, and wipes them with her _chadar_. No other ablution is  customary in the house.    Poor as this man is, he is a Hadji, and having brought from Mecca a  \"prayer stone,\" with the Prophet's hand upon it, he takes it from his  girdle, puts it on the floor, bows his forehead on it, turning  Mecca-ward, and says his prayers, repeating his devotions towards  evening. The first day or two he went out, but the roads now being  almost impassable, he confines himself to the repairing of a small  dyke, which keeps the water from running into the room, which is lower  than the yard, and performs its duty very imperfectly, the soak from  the yard and the drip from the roof increasing the sliminess hourly.  These repairs, an occasional pipe, and much sleep are the record of  this man's day till an hour before sunset, when the meal of the  morning is repeated with the addition of some cheese.    The children keep chiefly in bed. Meanwhile the woman, the busy bee of  the family, contrives to patter about nearly all day in wet clothing,  carrying out rubbish in single handfuls, breaking twigs, cleaning the  pot, and feeding the cow. The roof, which in fine weather is the scene  of most domestic occupations, is reached by a steep ladder, and she  climbs this seven times in succession, each time carrying up a fowl,  to pick for imaginary worms in the slimy mud. Dyed yarn is also  carried up to steep in the rain, and in an interval of dryness some  wool was taken up and carded. An hour before sunset she lights the  fire, puts on the porridge, and again performs seven journeys with  seven fowls, feeds them in the house, attends respectfully to her  lord, feeds her family, including the cow, paddles through mire to  draw water from the river, and unrolls and spreads the wadded quilts.  By the time it is dark they are once more in bed, where I trust this  harmless, industrious woman enjoys a well-earned sleep.    The clouds are breaking, and in spite of adverse rumours it is decided  _coute que coute_ to start to-morrow. For my own part I prefer the  freedom even with the \"swinishness\" of a caravanserai to receiving  hospitality for which no fitting return can be made.         I. L. B.          LETTER IV           SARIPUL-I-ZOHAB, _Jan. 21_.    The rain at last ceased, and after the _katirgis_ had squabbled for an  hour over the baggage, we got off at ten, two days ago, very grateful  for shelter and hospitality under such untoward circumstances. Six  Bashi Bazouks and two _zaptiehs_ on foot in ragged and incongruous  uniforms escorted us to the Turkish frontier.    The streets were in a terrible condition, and horse and footmen, after  an attempt to march in pairs, fell perforce into a floundering and  disorderly single file, the footmen occasionally pulling themselves  out of mud holes by the tails of the horses. Outside the town there  was an expanse of mud and flooded water-channels which broke up the  last attempt at a procession, and led to a general _sauve qui peut_.  The mire was tenacious and up to the horses' knees, half the mules  were down with their loads, Hadji rolled into the mud, my capable  animal snorted and struggled, some went on banks and some took to  streams, the asses had to be relieved of their loads, and"]]]
