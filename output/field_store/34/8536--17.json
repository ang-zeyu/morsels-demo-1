But ask on!\"    I said: \"We have heard about London and the manufacturing districts and  the ordinary towns: how about the villages?\"    Said Hammond: \"You must know that toward the end of the nineteenth  century the villages were almost destroyed, unless where they became mere  adjuncts to the manufacturing districts, or formed a sort of minor  manufacturing districts themselves.  Houses were allowed to fall into  decay and actual ruin; trees were cut down for the sake of the few  shillings which the poor sticks would fetch; the building became  inexpressibly mean and hideous.  Labour was scarce; but wages fell  nevertheless.  All the small country arts of life which once added to the  little pleasures of country people were lost.  The country produce which  passed through the hands of the husbandmen never got so far as their  mouths.  Incredible shabbiness and niggardly pinching reigned over the  fields and acres which, in spite of the rude and careless husbandry of  the times, were so kind and bountiful.  Had you any inkling of all this?\"    \"I have heard that it was so,\" said I \"but what followed?\"    \"The change,\" said Hammond, \"which in these matters took place very early  in our epoch, was most strangely rapid.  People flocked into the country  villages, and, so to say, flung themselves upon the freed land like a  wild beast upon his prey; and in a very little time the villages of  England were more populous than they had been since the fourteenth  century, and were still growing fast.  Of course, this invasion of the  country was awkward to deal with, and would have created much misery, if  the folk had still been under the bondage of class monopoly.  But as it  was, things soon righted themselves.  People found out what they were fit  for, and gave up attempting to push themselves into occupations in which  they must needs fail.  The town invaded the country; but the invaders,  like the warlike invaders of early days, yielded to the influence of  their surroundings, and became country people; and in their turn, as they  became more numerous than the townsmen, influenced them also; so that the  difference between town and country grew less and less; and it was indeed  this world of the country vivified by the thought and briskness of town-  bred folk which has produced that happy and leisurely but eager life of  which you have had a first taste.  Again I say, many blunders were made,  but we have had time to set them right.  Much was left for the men of my  earlier life to deal with.  The crude ideas of the first half of the  twentieth century, when men were still oppressed by the fear of poverty,  and did not look enough to the present pleasure of ordinary daily life,  spoilt a great deal of what the commercial age had left us of external  beauty: and I admit that it was but slowly that men recovered from the  injuries that they inflicted on themselves even after they became free.  But slowly as the recovery came, it _did_ come; and the more you see of  us, the clearer it will be to you that we are happy.  That we live amidst  beauty without any fear of becoming effeminate; that we have plenty to  do, and on the whole enjoy doing it.  What more can we ask of life?\"    He paused, as if he were seeking for words with which to express his  thought.  Then he said:    \"This is how we stand.  England was once a country of clearings amongst  the woods and wastes, with a few towns interspersed, which were  fortresses for the feudal army, markets for the folk, gathering places  for the craftsmen.  It then became a country of huge and foul workshops  and fouler gambling-dens, surrounded by an ill-kept, poverty-stricken  farm, pillaged by the masters of the workshops.  It is now a garden,  where nothing is wasted and nothing is spoilt, with the necessary  dwellings, sheds, and workshops scattered up and down the country, all  trim and neat and pretty.  For, indeed, we should be too much ashamed of  ourselves if we allowed the making of goods, even on a large scale, to  carry with it the appearance, even, of desolation and misery.  Why, my  friend, those housewives we were talking of just now would teach us  better than that.\"    Said I: \"This side of your change is certainly for the better.  But  though I shall soon see some of these villages, tell me in a word or two  what they are like, just to prepare me.\"    \"Perhaps,\" said he, \"you have seen a tolerable picture of these villages  as they were before the end of the nineteenth century.  Such things  exist.\"    \"I have seen several of such pictures,\" said I.    \"Well,\" said Hammond, \"our villages are something like the best of such  places, with the church or mote-house of the neighbours for their chief  building.  Only note that there are no tokens of poverty about them: no  tumble-down picturesque; which, to tell you the truth, the artist usually  availed himself of to veil his incapacity for drawing architecture.  Such  things do not please us, even when they indicate no misery.  Like the  mediaevals, we like everything trim and clean, and orderly and bright; as  people always do when they have any sense of architectural power; because  then they know that they can have what they want, and they won't stand  any nonsense from Nature in their dealings with her.\"    \"Besides the villages, are there any scattered country houses?\" said I.    \"Yes, plenty,\" said Hammond; \"in fact, except in the wastes and forests  and amongst the sand-hills (like Hindhead in Surrey), it is not easy to  be out of sight of a house; and where the houses are thinly scattered  they run large, and are more like the old colleges than ordinary houses  as they used to be.  That is done for the sake of society, for a good  many people can dwell in such houses, as the country dwellers are not  necessarily husbandmen; though they almost all help in such work at  times.  The life that goes on in these big dwellings in the country is  very pleasant, especially as some of the most studious men of our time  live in them, and altogether there is a great variety of mind and mood to  be found in them which brightens and quickens the society there.\"    \"I am rather surprised,\" said I, \"by all this, for it seems to me that  after all the country must be tolerably populous.\"    \"Certainly,\" said he; \"the population is pretty much the same as it was  at the end of the nineteenth century; we have spread it, that is all.  Of  course, also, we have helped to populate other countries--where we were  wanted and were called for.\"    Said I: \"One thing, it seems to me, does not go with your word of  'garden' for the country.  You have spoken of wastes and forests, and I  myself have seen the beginning of your Middlesex and Essex forest.  Why  do you keep such things in a garden? and isn't it very wasteful to do  so?\"    \"My friend,\" he said, \"we like these pieces of wild nature, and can  afford them, so we have them; let alone that as to the forests, we need a  great deal of timber, and suppose that our sons and sons' sons will do  the like.  As to the land being a garden, I have heard that they used to  have shrubberies and rockeries in gardens once; and though I might not  like the artificial ones, I assure you that some of the natural rockeries  of our garden are worth seeing.  Go north this summer and look at the  Cumberland and Westmoreland ones,--where, by the way, you will see some  sheep-feeding, so that they are not so wasteful as you think; not so  wasteful as forcing-grounds for fruit out of season, _I_ think.  Go and  have a look at the sheep-walks high up the slopes between Ingleborough  and Pen-y-gwent, and tell me if you think we _waste_ the land there by  not covering it with factories for making things that nobody wants, which  was the chief business of the nineteenth century.\"    \"I will try to go there,\" said I.    \"It won't take much trying,\" said he.          CHAPTER XI: CONCERNING GOVERNMENT      \"Now,\" said I, \"I have come to the point of asking questions which I  suppose will be dry for you to answer and difficult for you to explain;  but I have foreseen for some time past that I must ask them, will I 'nill  I.  What kind of a government have you?  Has republicanism finally  triumphed? or have you come to a mere dictatorship, which some persons in  the nineteenth century used to prophesy as the ultimate outcome of  democracy?  Indeed, this last question does not seem so very  unreasonable, since you have turned your Parliament House into a dung-  market.  Or where do you house your present Parliament?\"    The old man answered my smile with a hearty laugh, and said: \"Well, well,  dung is not the worst kind of corruption; fertility may come of that,  whereas mere dearth came from the other kind, of which those walls once  held the great supporters.  Now, dear guest, let me tell you that our  present parliament would be hard to house in one place, because the whole  people is our parliament.\"    \"I don't understand,\" said I.    \"No, I suppose not,\" said he.  \"I must now shock you by telling you that  we have no longer anything which you, a native of another planet, would  call a government.\"    \"I am not so much shocked as you might think,\" said I, \"as I know  something about governments.  But tell me, how do you manage, and how  have you come to this state of things?\"    Said he: \"It is true that we have to make some arrangements about our  affairs, concerning which you can ask presently; and it is also true that  everybody does not always agree with the details of these arrangements;  but, further, it is true that a man no more needs an elaborate system of  government, with its army, navy, and police, to force him to give way to  the will of the majority of his _equals_, than he wants a similar  machinery to make him understand that his head and a stone wall cannot  occupy the same space at the same moment.  Do you want further  explanation?\"    \"Well, yes, I do,\" quoth I.    Old "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32677"],[0,"The Invention of the Sewing Machine (#15)"],[1,"yardage.  When in excess of the repairing needs, this fabric was made into  garments and sold with the second-hand items. Many visitors who passed  through New York City were found to be potential buyers of this  merchandise if a better class of ready-made clothes was made available.  Manufacture began to increase. Tailors of the city began to keep an  assortment of finished garments on hand. When visitors bought these,  they were also very likely to buy additional garments for resale at  home. The latter led to the establishment of the wholesale  garment-manufacturing industry in New York about 1834-35.    Most of the ready-made clothing establishments were small operations,  not large factories. Large quantities of cloth were purchased; cutting  was done in multiple layers with tailor's shears. Since many  seamstresses were needed, the garments were farmed out to the girls in  their homes. The manufacture of garments in quantity meant that the  profit on each garment was larger than a tailor could make on a single  custom-made item. The appeal of increased profits influenced many to  enter the new industry and, due to the ensuing competition, the retail  cost of each garment was lowered. Just as the new businesses were  getting underway, the Panic of 1837 ruined most of them. But the lower  cost and the convenience of ready-made clothing had left its mark. Not  only was the garment-manufacturing business re-established soon after  the Panic had subsided, but by 1841 the value of clothing sold at  wholesale in New York was estimated at $2,500,000 and by 1850--a year  before sewing machines were manufactured in any quantity--there were  4,278 clothing manufacturing establishments in the United States. Beside  New York City, Cincinnati was also one of the important ready-made  clothing centers. In 1850 the value of its products amounted to  $4,427,500 and in 1860 to $6,381,190. Boston was another important  center with a ready-made clothing production of $4,567,749 in 1860.  Philadelphia, Baltimore, Louisville, and St. Louis all had a large  wholesale clothing trade by 1860. Here was the ready market for a  practical sewing machine.[73]    Clothing establishments grew and began to have agencies in small towns  and the sewing work was distributed throughout the countryside. The new,  competing sewing-machine companies were willing to deliver a machine for  a small sum and to allow the buyer to pay a dollar or two a month until  the full amount of the sale was paid. This was an extension of the  hire-purchase plan (buying on credit) initiated by Clark of the Singer  Company. The home seamstresses were eager to buy, for they were able to  produce more piecework with a sewing machine and therefore earn more  money. An example of the effect that the sewing machine had on the  stitching time required was interestingly established through a series  of experiments conducted by the Wheeler and Wilson company. Four hand  sewers and four sewing-machine operators were used to provide the  average figures in this comparative time study, the results of which  were published in 1861;[74]      NUMBER OF STITCHES PER MINUTE                                        _By Hand_  _By Machine_    Patent leather, fine stitching        7          175    Binding hats                         33          374    Stitching vamped shoes               10          210    Stitching fine linen                 23          640    Stitching fine silk                  30          550      TIME FOR GARMENTS STITCHED                                    _By Hand_          _By Machine_    Frock coats                16 hrs. 35 min.     2 hrs. 38 min.

The factory manufacturer, with the sewing work done at the factory, was  also developing. In 1860, Oliver F. Winchester, a shirt manufacturer of  New Haven, Connecticut, stated that his factory turned out 800 dozen  shirts per week, using 400 sewing machines and operators to do the work  of 2,000 hand sewers. The price for hand sewing was then $3 per week,  which made labor costs $6000 per week. The 400 machine operators  received $4 per week, making the labor cost $1600 per week. Allowing  $150 as the cost of each machine, the sewing machines more than paid for  themselves in less than 14 weeks, increased the operators pay by $1 a  week, and lowered the retail cost of the item.[75] The greatest savings  of time, which was as much as fifty percent, was in the manufacture of  light goods--such items as shirts, aprons, and calico dresses. The  Commissioner of Patents weighed the monetary effect that this or any  invention had on the economy against the monetary gain received by the  patentee. When he found that the patentee had not been fairly  compensated, he had the authority to grant a seven-year extension to the  patent.[76]    The sewing machine also contributed to the popularity of certain  fashions. Ready-made cloaks for women were a business of a few years'  standing when the sewing machine was adopted for their manufacture in  1853. Machine sewing reduced the cost of constructing the garment by  about eighty percent, thereby decreasing its price and increasing its  popularity. In New York City alone, the value of the \"cloak and  mantilla\" manufacture in 1860 was $618,400.[77] Crinolines and  hoopskirts were easier to stitch by machine than by hand, and these  items had a spirited period of popularity due to the introduction of the  sewing machine. Braiding, pleating, and tucking adorned many costume  items because they could be produced by machine with ease and rapidity.    In addition to using the sewing machine for the manufacture of shirts,  collars, and related men's furnishings, the machine was also used in the  production of men's and boy's suits and reportedly gave \"a vast impetus  to the trade.\"[78] The Army, however, was not quite convinced of the  sewing machine's practical adaptation to its needs. Although a sewing  machine was purchased for the Philadelphia Quartermaster Depot as early  as 1851, they had only six by 1860. On March 31, 1859, General Jesup of  the Philadelphia Depot wrote to a Nechard & Company stating that the  machine sewing had been tried but was not used for clothing, only for  stitching caps and chevrons. In another letter, on the same day, to  \"Messers Hebrard & Co., Louisiana Steam Clothing Factory, N. Orleans,\"  Jesup states: \"Machine sewing has been tried with us, and though it  meets the requirements of a populous and civilized life, it has been  found not to answer for the hard wear and tear and limited means of our  frontier service. Particular attention has been paid to this subject,  and we have abandoned the use of machines for coats, jackets and  trousers, etc. and use them on caps and bands that are not exposed to  much hard usage....\"[79] At this period prior to the Civil War, the Army  manufactured its own clothing. As the demands of war increased, more and  more of the Army's clothing supplies were furnished on open  contract--with no specifications as to stitching.[80] Machine  stitching, in fact, is found in most of the Civil War uniforms. One of  the problems that most probably affected the durability of the machine  stitching in the 1850s was the sewing thread, a problem that was not  solved until the 1860s and which is discussed later under \"thread for  the machine.\"    [Illustration: Figure 55.--BLAKE'S LEATHER-STITCHING MACHINE patent  model of July 6, 1858; the inventor claimed the arrangement of the  mechanism used and an auxiliary arm capable of entering the shoe, which  enabled the outer sole to be stitched both to the inner sole and to the  upper part of the shoe. (Smithsonian photo 50361.)]      SHOE MANUFACTURE    Another industry that was aided by the new invention was that of shoe  manufacture. Although the earliest sewing-machine patents in the United  States reflect the inventors' efforts to solve the difficult task of  leather stitching, and, although machines were used to a limited extent  in stitching some parts of the shoe in the early and mid-1850s, it was  not until 1858 that a machine was invented that could stitch the sole to  the inner sole and to the upper part of the shoe. This was the invention  of Lyman R. Blake and was patented by him on July 8, 1858; the patent  model is shown in figure 55. Blake formed a chainstitch by using a  hooked needle, which descended from above, to draw a thread through the  supporting arm. Serving as the machine's bedplate, the arm was shaped to  accommodate the stitching of all the parts of the shoe.    [Illustration: Figure 56.--HARRIS' patent thread cutter, 1872.  (Smithsonian photo P-6397.)]    [Illustration: Figure 57.--WEST'S patent thread cutter, 1874.  (Smithsonian photo P-63100.)]    [Illustration: Figure 58.--KARR'S patent needle threader, 1871.  (Smithsonian photo P-63101.)]    The increased number of shoes required by the Army during the Civil War  spurred the use of the sewing machine in their manufacture. The first  \"machine sewed bootees\" were purchased by the Army in 1861. Inventors  continued their efforts; the most prominent of these was Gordon McKay,  who worked on an improvement of the Blake machine with Robert Mathies in  1862 and then with Blake in 1864. Reportedly, the Government at first  preferred the machine-stitched shoes as they lasted eight times longer  than those stitched by hand; during the war the Army purchased 473,000  pairs, but in 1871 the Quartermaster General wrote:         No complaints regarding the quality of these shoes were received up       to February 1867 when a Board of Survey, which convened at Hart's       Island, New York Harbor"]]]
