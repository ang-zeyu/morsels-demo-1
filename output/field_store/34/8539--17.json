The  detectives and I must have echoed it, when we were aware of a man who  seemed to have emerged from the wall, who advanced now from the gloom  of the corner in which he had appeared. Mrs. Douglas turned, and in  an instant her arms were round him. Barker had seized his outstretched  hand.    \"It's best this way, Jack,\" his wife repeated; \"I am sure that it is  best.\"    \"Indeed, yes, Mr. Douglas,\" said Sherlock Holmes, \"I am sure that you  will find it best.\"    The man stood blinking at us with the dazed look of one who comes from  the dark into the light. It was a remarkable face, bold gray eyes, a  strong, short-clipped, grizzled moustache, a square, projecting chin,  and a humorous mouth. He took a good look at us all, and then to my  amazement he advanced to me and handed me a bundle of paper.    \"I've heard of you,\" said he in a voice which was not quite English and  not quite American, but was altogether mellow and pleasing. \"You are the  historian of this bunch. Well, Dr. Watson, you've never had such a story  as that pass through your hands before, and I'll lay my last dollar on  that. Tell it your own way; but there are the facts, and you can't miss  the public so long as you have those. I've been cooped up two days, and  I've spent the daylight hours--as much daylight as I could get in that  rat trap--in putting the thing into words. You're welcome to them--you  and your public. There's the story of the Valley of Fear.\"    \"That's the past, Mr. Douglas,\" said Sherlock Holmes quietly. \"What we  desire now is to hear your story of the present.\"    \"You'll have it, sir,\" said Douglas. \"May I smoke as I talk? Well, thank  you, Mr. Holmes. You're a smoker yourself, if I remember right, and  you'll guess what it is to be sitting for two days with tobacco in your  pocket and afraid that the smell will give you away.\" He leaned against  the mantelpiece and sucked at the cigar which Holmes had handed him.  \"I've heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I never guessed that I should meet you.  But before you are through with that,\" he nodded at my papers, \"you will  say I've brought you something fresh.\"    Inspector MacDonald had been staring at the newcomer with the greatest  amazement. \"Well, this fairly beats me!\" he cried at last. \"If you  are Mr. John Douglas of Birlstone Manor, then whose death have we been  investigating for these two days, and where in the world have you  sprung from now? You seemed to me to come out of the floor like a  jack-in-a-box.\"    \"Ah, Mr. Mac,\" said Holmes, shaking a reproving forefinger, \"you  would not read that excellent local compilation which described the  concealment of King Charles. People did not hide in those days without  excellent hiding places, and the hiding place that has once been used  may be again. I had persuaded myself that we should find Mr. Douglas  under this roof.\"    \"And how long have you been playing this trick upon us, Mr. Holmes?\"  said the inspector angrily. \"How long have you allowed us to waste  ourselves upon a search that you knew to be an absurd one?\"    \"Not one instant, my dear Mr. Mac. Only last night did I form my views  of the case. As they could not be put to the proof until this evening, I  invited you and your colleague to take a holiday for the day. Pray what  more could I do? When I found the suit of clothes in the moat, it at  once became apparent to me that the body we had found could not have  been the body of Mr. John Douglas at all, but must be that of the  bicyclist from Tunbridge Wells. No other conclusion was possible.  Therefore I had to determine where Mr. John Douglas himself could be,  and the balance of probability was that with the connivance of his wife  and his friend he was concealed in a house which had such conveniences  for a fugitive, and awaiting quieter times when he could make his final  escape.\"    \"Well, you figured it out about right,\" said Douglas approvingly. \"I  thought I'd dodge your British law; for I was not sure how I stood under  it, and also I saw my chance to throw these hounds once for all off my  track. Mind you, from first to last I have done nothing to be ashamed  of, and nothing that I would not do again; but you'll judge that for  yourselves when I tell you my story. Never mind warning me, Inspector:  I'm ready to stand pat upon the truth.    \"I'm not going to begin at the beginning. That's all there,\" he  indicated my bundle of papers, \"and a mighty queer yarn you'll find it.  It all comes down to this: That there are some men that have good cause  to hate me and would give their last dollar to know that they had got  me. So long as I am alive and they are alive, there is no safety in  this world for me. They hunted me from Chicago to California, then they  chased me out of America; but when I married and settled down in this  quiet spot I thought my last years were going to be peaceable.    \"I never explained to my wife how things were. Why should I pull her  into it? She would never have a quiet moment again; but would always be  imagining trouble. I fancy she knew something, for I may have dropped a  word here or a word there; but until yesterday, after you gentlemen had  seen her, she never knew the rights of the matter. She told you all she  knew, and so did Barker here; for on the night when this thing happened  there was mighty little time for explanations. She knows everything now,  and I would have been a wiser man if I had told her sooner. But it was a  hard question, dear,\" he took her hand for an instant in his own, \"and I  acted for the best.    \"Well, gentlemen, the day before these happenings I was over in  Tunbridge Wells, and I got a glimpse of a man in the street. It was only  a glimpse; but I have a quick eye for these things, and I never doubted  who it was. It was the worst enemy I had among them all--one who has  been after me like a hungry wolf after a caribou all these years. I  knew there was trouble coming, and I came home and made ready for it. I  guessed I'd fight through it all right on my own, my luck was a proverb  in the States about '76. I never doubted that it would be with me still.    \"I was on my guard all that next day, and never went out into the park.  It's as well, or he'd have had the drop on me with that buckshot gun of  his before ever I could draw on him. After the bridge was up--my mind  was always more restful when that bridge was up in the evenings--I put  the thing clear out of my head. I never dreamed of his getting into the  house and waiting for me. But when I made my round in my dressing  gown, as was my habit, I had no sooner entered the study than I scented  danger. I guess when a man has had dangers in his life--and I've had  more than most in my time--there is a kind of sixth sense that waves  the red flag. I saw the signal clear enough, and yet I couldn't tell you  why. Next instant I spotted a boot under the window curtain, and then I  saw why plain enough.    \"I'd just the one candle that was in my hand; but there was a good light  from the hall lamp through the open door. I put down the candle and  jumped for a hammer that I'd left on the mantel. At the same moment he  sprang at me. I saw the glint of a knife, and I lashed at him with the  hammer. I got him somewhere; for the knife tinkled down on the floor. He  dodged round the table as quick as an eel, and a moment later he'd got  his gun from under his coat. I heard him cock it; but I had got hold of  it before he could fire. I had it by the barrel, and we wrestled for it  all ends up for a minute or more. It was death to the man that lost his  grip.    \"He never lost his grip; but he got it butt downward for a moment too  long. Maybe it was I that pulled the trigger. Maybe we just jolted it  off between us. Anyhow, he got both barrels in the face, and there I  was, staring down at all that was left of Ted Baldwin. I'd recognized  him in the township, and again when he sprang for me; but his own mother  wouldn't recognize him as I saw him then. I'm used to rough work; but I  fairly turned sick at the sight of him.    \"I was hanging on the side of the table when Barker came hurrying down.  I heard my wife coming, and I ran to the door and stopped her. It was no  sight for a woman. I promised I'd come to her soon. I said a word or two  to Barker--he took it all in at a glance--and we waited for the rest to  come along. But there was no sign of them. Then we understood that they  could hear nothing, and that all that had happened was known only to  ourselves.    \"It was at that instant that the idea came to me. I was fairly dazzled  by the brilliance of it. The man's sleeve had slipped up and there was  the branded mark of the lodge upon his forearm. See here!\"    The man whom we had known as Douglas turned up his own coat and cuff  to show a brown triangle within a circle exactly like that which we had  seen upon the dead man.    \"It was the sight of that which started me on it. I seemed to see it all  clear at a glance. There were his height and hair and figure, about the  same as my own. No one could swear to his face, poor devil! I brought  down this suit of clothes, and in a quarter of an hour Barker and I had  put my dressing gown on him and he lay as you found him. We tied all his  things into a bundle, and I weighted them with the only weight I could  find and put them through the window. The card he had meant to lay upon  my body was lying beside his own.    \"My rings were put on his finger; but when it came to the wedding ring,\"  he held out his muscular hand, \"you can see for yourselves that I had  struck the limit. I have not moved it since the day I was married, and  it would have taken a file to get it off.

Nevertheless  when, thirty years later, Story, Marshall's friend and pupil, was in  search of the best judicial definition of treason within the meaning of  the Constitution, he selected this sentence from the case of Bollmann  and Swartwout and passed by the elaborate opinion in Burr's case in  significant silence. But reputation is a great magician in transmuting  heresy into accepted teaching. Posthumously Marshall's opinion has  attained a rank and authority with the legal profession that it never  enjoyed in his own time. Regarding it, therefore, as today established  doctrine, we may say that it has quite reversed the relative importance  of conspiracy and overt act where the treason is by levying war. At  the Common Law, and in the view of the framers of the Constitution, the  importance of the overt act of war was to make the conspiracy visible,  to put its existence beyond surmise. By Marshall's view each traitor  is chargeable only with his own overt acts, and the conspiracy is of  importance merely as showing the intention of such acts. And from this  it results logically, as Marshall saw, though he did not venture to say  so explicitly, that the procurer of treason is not a traitor unless he  has also participated personally in an overt act of war. As Wirt very  justifiably contended, such a result is \"monstrous,\" and, what is  more, it has not been possible to adhere to it in practice. In recent  legislation necessitated by the Great War, Congress has restored the old  Common Law view of treason but has avoided the constitutional difficulty  by labeling the offense \"Espionage.\" Indeed, the Espionage Act of June  15, 1917, scraps Marshall's opinion pretty completely. *       * See especially Title I, Section 4, of the Act. For evidence of  the modern standing of Marshall's opinion, see the chorus of approval  sounded by the legal fraternity in Dillon's three volumes. In support  of the Common Law doctrine, see the authorities cited in 27 \"Yale  Law Journal\", p. 342 and footnotes; the chapter on Treason in Simon  Greenleaf's well-known \"Treatise on the Law of Evidence;\" United States  w. Mitchell, 2 Dallas, 348; and Druecker vs. Salomon, 21 Wis., 621.      On the day following the reading of Marshall's opinion, the prosecution,  unable to produce two witnesses who had actually SEEN Burr procure  the assemblage on the island, abandoned the case to the jury. Shortly  thereafter the following verdict was returned: \"We of the jury say  that Aaron Burr is not proved to be guilty under this indictment by  any evidence submitted to us. We therefore find him not guilty.\" At  the order of the Chief Justice this Scotch verdict was entered on the  records of the court as a simple Not Guilty.    Marshall's conduct of Burr's trial for treason is the one serious  blemish in his judicial record, but for all that it was not without a  measure of extenuation. The President, too, had behaved deplorably and,  feeling himself on the defensive, had pressed matters with most unseemly  zeal, so that the charge of political persecution raised by Burr's  attorneys was, to say the least, not groundless. Furthermore, in  opposing the President in this matter, Marshall had shown his usual  political sagacity. Had Burr been convicted, the advantage must all have  gone to the Administration. The only possible credit the Chief Justice  could extract from the case would be from assuming that lofty tone of  calm, unmoved impartiality of which Marshall was such a master--and  never more than on this occasion--and from setting himself sternly  against popular hysteria. The words with which his opinion closes have  been often quoted:    \"Much has been said in the course of the argument on points on which  the Court feels no inclination to comment particularly, but which may,  perhaps not improperly receive some notice.    \"That this Court dare not usurp power is most true.    \"That this Court dare not shrink from its duty is not less true.    \"No man is desirous of placing himself in a disagreeable situation.  No man is desirous of becoming the popular subject of calumny. No man,  might he let the bitter cup pass from him without self-reproach, would  drain it to the bottom. But if he have no choice in the case, if there  be no alternative presented to him but a dereliction of duty or the  opprobrium of those who are denominated the world, he merits the  contempt as well as the indignation of his country who can hesitate  which to embrace.\"    One could not require a better illustration of that faculty of  \"apparently deep self-conviction\" which Wirt had noted in the Chief  Justice.    Finally, it must be owned that Burr's case offered Marshall a tempting  opportunity to try out the devotion of Republicans to that ideal of  judicial deportment which had led them so vehemently to criticize  Justice Chase and to charge him with being \"oppressive,\" with  refusing to give counsel for defense an opportunity to be heard, with  transgressing the state law of procedure, with showing too great liking  for Common Law ideas of sedition, with setting up the President as a  sort of monarch beyond the reach of judicial process. Marshall's conduct  of Burr's trial now exactly reversed every one of these grounds of  complaint. Whether he intended it or not, it was a neat turning of the  tables.    But Jefferson, who was at once both the most theoretical and the least  logical of men, was of course hardly prepared to see matters in that  light. As soon as the news reached him of Burr's acquittal, he ordered  Hay to press the indictment for misdemeanor--not for the purpose of  convicting Burr, but of getting the evidence down in a form in which it  should be available for impeachment proceedings against Marshall.  For some weeks longer, therefore, the Chief Justice sat listening to  evidence which was to be used against himself. But the impeachment never  came, for a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and the weakest  link in the combination against the Chief Justice was a very fragile one  indeed--the iniquitous Wilkinson. Even the faithful and melancholy Hay  finally abandoned him. \"The declaration, which I made in court in his  favor some time ago,\" he wrote the President, \"was precipitate.... My  confidence in him is destroyed.... I am sorry for it, on his account,  on the public account, and because you have expressed opinions in his  favor.\" It was obviously impossible to impeach the Chief Justice for  having prevented the hanging of Aaron Burr on the testimony of such a  miscreant.      Though the years immediately following the Burr trial were not a time of  conspicuous activity for Marshall, they paved the way in more than one  direction for his later achievement. Jefferson's retirement from the  Presidency at last relieved the Chief Justice from the warping influence  of a hateful personal contest and from anxiety for his official  security. Jefferson's successors were men more willing to identify  the cause of the Federal Judiciary with that of national unity. Better  still, the War of 1812 brought about the demise of the Federalist  party and thus cleared the Court of every suspicion of partisan bias.  Henceforth the great political issue was the general one of the nature  of the Union and the Constitution, a field in which Marshall's talent  for debate made him master. In the meantime the Court was acquiring that  personnel which it was to retain almost intact for nearly twenty years;  and, although the new recruits came from the ranks of his former party  foes, Marshall had little trouble in bringing their views into general  conformity with his own constitutional creed. Nor was his triumph an  exclusively personal one. He was aided in very large measure by the fact  that the war had brought particularism temporarily into discredit in  all sections of the country. Of Marshall's associates in 1812, Justice  Washington alone had come to the bench earlier, yet he was content  to speak through the mouth of his illustrious colleague, save on the  notable occasion when he led the only revolt of a majority of the Court  from the Chief Justice's leadership in the field of Constitutional  Law. * Johnson of South Carolina, a man of no little personal vanity,  affected a greater independence, for which he was on one occasion warmly  congratulated by Jefferson; yet even his separate opinions, though they  sometimes challenge Marshall's more sweeping premises and bolder method  of reasoning, are after all mostly concurring ones. Marshall's really  invaluable aid among his associates was Joseph Story, who in 1811,  at the age of thirty-two, was appointed by Madison in succession to  Cushing. Still immature, enthusiastically willing to learn, warmly  affectionate, and with his views on constitutional issues as yet  unformed, Story fell at once under the spell of Marshall's equally  gentle but vastly more resolute personality; and the result was one  of the most fruitful friendships of our history. Marshall's \"original  bias,\" to quote Story's own words, \"as well as the choice of his mind,  was to general principles and comprehensive views, rather than to  technical or recondite learning.\" Story's own bias, which was supported  by his prodigious industry, was just the reverse. The two men thus  supplemented each other admirably. A tradition of some venerability  represents Story as having said that Marshall was wont to remark: \"Now  Story, that is the law; you find the precedents for it.\" Whether true or  not, the tale at least illustrates the truth. Marshall owed to counsel a  somewhat similar debt in the way of leading up to his decisions, for, as  Story points out, \"he was solicitous to hear arguments and not to decide  cases without them, nor did any judge ever profit more by them.\" But  in the field of Constitutional Law, at least, Marshall used counsel's  argument not so much to indicate what his own"]]]
