[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3462"],[0,"More Hunting Wasps (#15)"],[1,"Breguet chronometer both have trains of cogwheels  geared in almost a similar fashion. (Louis Breguet (1803-1883), a famous  Parisian watchmaker and physicist.--Translator's Note.) Are we to  class the two mechanisms together? Shall we forget that the one turns a  shoulder of mutton before the hearth, while the other divides time into  seconds?    In the same way, the organic scaffolding is dominated from on high by  the aptitudes of the animal, especially that superior characteristic,  the psychical aptitudes. That the Chimpanzee and the hideous Gorilla  possess close resemblances of structure to our own is obvious. But  let us for a moment consider their aptitudes. What differences, what a  dividing gulf! Without exalting ourselves as high as the famous reed of  which Pascal speaks, that reed which, in its weakness, by the mere  fact that it knows itself to be crushed, is superior to the world that  crushes it, we may at least ask to be shown, somewhere, an animal making  an implement, which will multiply its skill and its strength, or  taking possession of fire, the primordial element of progress. (Blaise  Pascal(1623-1662). The allusion is to a passage in the philosopher's  \"Pensees.\" Pascal describes man as a reed, the weakest thing in nature,  but \"a thinking reed.\"--Translator's Note.) Master of implements and  of fire! These two aptitudes, simple though they be, characterize man  better than the number of his vertebrae and his molars.    You tell us that man, at first a hairy brute, walking on all fours,  has risen on his hind-legs and shed his fur; and you complacently  demonstrate how the elimination of the hairy pelt was effected. Instead  of bolstering up a theory with a handful of fluff gained or lost, it  would perhaps be better to settle how the original brute became the  possessor of implements and fire. Aptitudes are more important than  hair; and you neglect them because it is there that the insurmountable  difficulty really resides. See how the great master of evolution  hesitates and stammers when he tries, by fair means or foul, to fit  instinct into the mould of his formulae. It is not so easy to handle as  the colour of the pelt, the length of the tail, the ear that droops or  stands erect. Yes, our master well knows that this is where the shoe  pinches! Instinct escapes him and brings his theory crumbling to the  ground.    Let us return to what the Scoliae teach us on this question, which  incidentally touches on our own origin. In conformity with the Darwinian  ideas, we have accepted an unknown precursor, who by dint of repeated  experiment, adopted as the victuals to be hoarded the larvae of the  Scarabaeidae. This precursor, modified by varying circumstances, is  supposed to have subdivided herself into ramifications, one of which,  digging into vegetable mould and preferring the Cetonia to any other  game inhabiting the same heap, became the Two-banded Scolia; another,  also addicted to exploring the soil, but selecting the Oryctes, left as  its descendant the Garden Scolia; and a third, establishing itself  in sandy ground, where it found the Anoxia, was the ancestress of the  Interrupted Scolia. To these three ramifications we must beyond a doubt  add others which complete the series of the Scolia. As their habits are  known to me only by analogy, I confine myself to mentioning them.    The three species at least, therefore, with which I am familiar would  appear to be derived from a common precursor. To traverse the distance  from the starting-point to the goal, all three have had to contend with  difficulties, which are extremely grave if considered one by one and are  aggravated even more by this circumstance, that the overcoming of one  would lead to nothing unless the others were surmounted as successfully.  Success, then, is contingent upon a series of conditions, each one of  which offers almost no chance of victory, so that the fulfilment of them  all becomes a mathematical absurdity if we are to invoke accident alone.    And, in the first place, how was it that the Scolia of antiquity, having  to provide rations for her carnivorous family, adopted for her prey only  those larvae which, owing to the concentration of their nervous systems,  form so remarkable and so rare an exception in the insect order? What  chance would hazard offer her of obtaining this prey, the most suitable  of all because the most vulnerable? The chance represented by unity  compared with the indefinite number of entomological species. The odds  are as one to immensity.    Let us continue. The larva of the Scarabaeid is snapped up underground,  for the first time. The victim protests, defends itself after its  fashion, coils itself up and presents to the sting on every side a  surface on which a wound entails no serious danger. And yet the Wasp, an  absolute novice, has to select, for the thrust of its poisoned weapon,  one single point, narrowly restricted and hidden in the folds of the  larva's body. If she miscalculates, she may be killed: the larva,  irritated by the smarting puncture, is strong enough to disembowel her  with the tusks of its mandibles. If she escapes the danger, she will  nevertheless perish without leaving any offspring, since the necessary  provisions will be lacking. Salvation for herself and her race depends  on this: whether at the first thrust she is able to reach the little  nervous plexus which measures barely one-fiftieth of an inch in width.  What chance has she of plunging her lancet into it, if there is nothing  to guide her? The chance represented by unity compared with the number  of points composing the victim's body. The odds are as one against  immensity.    Let us proceed still further. The sting has reached the mark; the fat  grub is deprived of movement. At what spots should the egg now be laid?  In front, behind, on the sides, the back or the belly? The choice is  not a matter of indifference. The young grub will pierce the skin of  its provender at the very spot on which the egg was fixed; and, once an  opening is made, it will go ahead without hesitation. If this point of  attack is ill-chosen, the nurseling runs the risk of presently finding  under its mandibles some essential organ, which should have been  respected until the end in order to keep the victuals fresh. Remember  how difficult it is to complete the rearing when the tiny larva is moved  from the place chosen by the mother. The game promptly becomes putrid  and the Scolia dies.    It is impossible for me to state the precise motives which lead to the  adoption of the spot on which the egg is laid; I can perceive general  reasons, but the details escape me, as I am not well enough versed in  the more delicate questions of anatomy and entomological physiology.  What I do know with absolute certainty is that the same spot is  invariably chosen for laying the egg. With not a single exception, on  all the victims extracted from the heap of garden mould--and they are  numerous--the egg is fixed behind the ventral surface, on the verge of  the brown patch formed by the contents of the digestive system.    If there be nothing to guide her, what chance has the mother of gluing  her egg to this point, which is always the same because it is that most  favourable to successful rearing? A very small point, represented by  the ratio of two or three square millimetres (About 1/100 square  inch.--Translator's Note.) to the entire surface of the victim's body.    Is this all? Not yet. The grub is hatched; it pierces the belly of the  Cetonia-larva at the requisite point; it plunges its long neck into the  entrails, ransacking them and filling itself to repletion. If it bite at  random, if it have no other guide in the selection of tit-bits than the  preference of the moment and the violence of an imperious appetite, it  will infallibly incur the danger of being poisoned by putrid food, for  the victim, if wounded in those organs which preserve a remnant of life  in it, will die for good and all at the first mouthfuls.    The ample joint must be consumed with prudent skill: this part must be  eaten before that and, after that, some other portion, always according  to method, until the time approaches for the last bites. This marks the  end of life for the Cetonia, but it also marks the end of the Scolia's  feasting. If the grub be a novice in the art of eating, if no special  instinct guide its mandibles in the belly of the prey, what chance has  it of completing its perilous meal? As much as a starving Wolf  would have of daintily dissecting his Sheep, when he tears at her  gluttonously, rends her into shreds and gulps them down.    These four conditions of success, with chance so near to zero in each  case, must all be realized together, or the grub will never be reared.  The Scolia may have captured a larva with close-packed nerve-centres,  a Cetonia-grub, for instance; but this will go for nothing unless she  direct her sting towards the only vulnerable point. She may know the  whole secret of the art of stabbing her victim, but this means nothing  if she does not know where to fasten her egg. The suitable spot may be  found, but all the foregoing will be useless if the grub be not versed  in the method to be followed in devouring its prey while keeping it  alive. It is all or nothing.    Who would venture to calculate the final chance on which the future of  the Scolia, or of her precursor, is based, that complex chance whose  factors are four infinitely improbable occurrences, one might almost  say four impossibilities? And such a conjunction is supposed to be a  fortuitous result, to which the present instinct is due! Come, come!    From another point of view again, the Darwinian theory is at variance  with the Scoliae and their prey. In the heap of garden mould which I  exploited in order to write this record, three kinds of larvae dwell  together, belonging to the Scarabaeid group: the Cetonia,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34645"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 3 (of 6) (#15)"],[1,"S.  Catherine; and there are also other saints well executed in the Mantegna  style, as is observed by the Cav. Gio. de Lazara, whose authority I  esteem excellent. It bears the inscription, \"Franciscus Verlus de  Vicentia pinxit xx. Junii. M. D. XII.;\" and to this is added by Faccioli  another old painting by the same hand, remaining at Sercedo. Now I  contend that the name of this painter, being reported to Vasari, with  its diminutive termination, like many others, borrowed either from the  stature or the age, (in the Venetian dialect it was Verlucio or Verluzo)  it was afterwards given by him in his history as Veruzio. The critics of  the Greek writers will know how to do me justice in this, for this mode  of discovering and correcting names I have derived from them.]    [Footnote 38: To judge from some pictures at Bergamo, we might suppose  him educated in the style of the fourteenth century; but he afterwards  approached nearer to the modern, as we perceive at Padua, where he  resembles Palma Vecchio; and this is sufficiently conspicuous also in  Friuli, where we make mention of him at a more cultivated era.]    [Footnote 39: In this character is the larger picture at S. Niccolo, a  church of the Dominicans in Treviso, in which the cupola, the columns,  and the perspective, with the throne of the virgin seated with the  infant Jesus, and surrounded by saints standing, the steps ornamented by  a harping seraph, all discover Bellini's composition; but I had not seen  the work, until after the former edition of my history at Bassano. It  was painted in 1520, by P. Marco Pensaben, assisted by P. Marco  Maraveia, both Dominican priests, engaged for the purpose from Venice.  They remained there until July, 1521, when the first of them secretly  fled from the convent, and the altarpiece of Treviso was completed in a  month by one Gian-Girolamo, a painter invited from Venice; supposed to  be Girolamo Trevisano, the younger. This artist is not, however,  mentioned, as I am aware, either, by the citizens, or by foreigners, by  any other name than Girolamo, and calculating from the chronology of  Ridolfi, he must then have been thirteen years of age. Until this  subject be more clearly investigated, I must confess my ignorance of  such a Gian-Girolamo. But I am better acquainted with the name of  Pensaben, who was afterwards found, and in 1524 was, as before, a  Dominican friar at Venice; but a few years after, in 1530, is mentioned  in authentic books belonging to the order, being registered among those  who had either left the order or were dead. P. Federici believes him to  have been the same as F. Bastiano del Piombo, an untenable supposition,  as I have elsewhere shown. I believe Pensaben to have been an excellent  artist in the Bellini manner, though not commemorated in history, nor by  his order. In an order so prolific with genius, and in an age abounding  with great names, he is by no means a solitary instance of this: the  present work being found to contain many other examples.]    [Footnote 40: As early as the eleventh century, or thereabouts, it would  appear that some similar kind of art was in repute in Germany. The monk  Theophilus, in the works before mentioned, \"De omni scientia artis  pingendi,\" alluding, at the commencement, to the most esteemed  productions of every country, observes: \"quidquid in fenestrarum  varietate preciosa diligit Francia; quidquid in auri, argenti, cupri,  ferri, lignorum, lapidumque subtilitate sollers laudat Germania.\"  _Codice Viennese._]            VENETIAN SCHOOL.      SECOND EPOCH.      _Giorgione, Titian, Tintoret, Jacopo da Bassano, Paolo    Veronese._      Behold us at length arrived at the golden period of the Venetian School,  which like the others of Italy, produced its most distinguished  ornaments about the year 1500; artists who at once eclipsed the fame of  their predecessors, and the hopes of attaining to equal excellence on  the part of their successors. In reaching this degree of eminence, it is  true they pursued different paths, though they all aimed at acquiring  the same perfection of colouring; the most natural, the most lively, and  the most applauded of any single school of the age; a distinction they  likewise conferred upon their posterity, forming the distinguishing  characteristic of the Venetian painters. The merit of this has been  attributed to the climate by some, who assert, that in Venice, and the  adjacent places, nature herself has bestowed a warmer and deeper colour  upon objects than elsewhere; a frivolous supposition, and undeserving of  much of our attention, inasmuch as the artists of Holland and Flanders,  in climates so extremely opposite, have obtained the same meed of  praise. Neither is it to be attributed to the quality of the colours;  both Giorgione and Titian having been known to make use of few, and  these, so far from being selected or procured elsewhere, exposed to sale  in all the public shops in Venice. If it should again be objected, that  in those days the colours were sold purer and less adulterated, I admit  there may be some degree of truth in this, inasmuch as Passeri, in his  life of Orbetto, complained at that time of the early decay of many  pictures, \"owing to the quality of the colours fraudulently sold by the  retailers.\" But I would merely inquire, if it were possible, that  materials thus pure and uncontaminated should so often fall into the  hands of the Venetians and their Flemish imitators, yet be so seldom met  with in the rest of the schools. The cause of their superiority is to be  sought, therefore, in their mechanism and art of colouring; in regard to  which the best Venetian painters conformed, in some points, to the most  celebrated artists of Italy. In other points, however, they differed  from them. It was a common practice at that period, to prepare with a  chalk surface the altarpieces and pictures which were intended to be  executed; and that white ground, favourable to every variety of tint the  painter could lay upon it, equally favoured the production of a certain  polish, floridity, and surprising transparency; a custom which, being  laid aside out of indolence and avarice, I am happy to perceive seems  about to be renewed. But in addition to this the Venetians were in  possession of an art that may be considered peculiar to themselves. For  it may be observed, that the chief part of them during these three  centuries, produced the effect of their paintings, not so much by a  strong layer of colours, as by separate strokes of the pencil; and each  colour being thus adapted to its place, without much repeating or  refining it, they still continued augmenting the work, by which the  tints were preserved clear and virgin; a result which requires no less  promptness of hand than of intellect, besides education, and a taste  cultivated from the earliest period. Hence the artist Vecchia was  accustomed to say, that by dint of copying pictures executed with  diligence, a painter will acquire the same quality; but to succeed in  copies from a Titian or a Paolo, and to imitate their stroke, is a task  surmounted only by the Venetians, whether natives or educated in their  school. (_Boschini_, p. 274.)    Should it here be inquired what good result may attend such a method, I  reply that Boschini points out two very considerable ones. The first of  them is, that by this mode of colouring, which he terms _di macchia_ and  _di pratica_, a certain hardness of style may more easily be avoided;  and the other, that, better than any other, it gives a bolder relief to  paintings in the distance: and pictures being intended to be thus  viewed, rather than closer to the eye, such an object is by this process  most easily attainable. I am aware of the moderns having misapplied and  abused these maxims; but they were meant to have been judiciously  employed, and I only wish to propose as examples the most celebrated of  the school who so ably comprehended the method, and the limits of such a  practice. Nor was the harmony of colours better understood by any other  artists, insomuch, that the mode of assimilating and of contrasting  them, may be considered as the second source of the delightful and  lively, so predominant in their works, and more especially in those of  Titian and his contemporaries.    Such skill was not merely confined to the fleshy parts, in whose colour  the disciples of Titian have so far excelled every other school; it  extended also to the drapery. For indeed, there are no pieces of  velvets, of stuffs, or of crapes, which they did not imitate to  perfection, more particularly in their portraits, in which the Venetians  of that period abounded, displaying specimens the most ornamental and  beautiful. The cavalier Mengs is of opinion, that also to this branch of  the art, requiring the strictest attention to truth, and conferring a  peculiar kind of interest upon a picture, may be in some measure  attributed the degree of power and truth acquired by those eminent  colourists. Their merit was moreover conspicuous in imitating every kind  of work in gold, in silver, and every species of metal; so much so, that  there are no royal palaces or lordly feasts, read of in any poet, which  do not appear more nobly represented in some Venetian paintings. It was  equally remarkable in point of landscape, which sometimes surpassed the  efforts of the Flemish painters, and in architectural views, which, with  a magnificence unknown elsewhere, they succeeded in introducing into  their compositions, as we had before occasion to observe of the artists  of the fourteenth century; a species of industry extremely favourable,  likewise, to the distribution, the variety, and to the complete effect  of groups of figures.    In these extensive compositions, which about the period of the Bellini  abounded in half-length or diminutive figures, there has since been  displayed a grandeur of proportions"]]]
