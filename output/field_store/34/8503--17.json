It  was reported that her captain had said she was overloaded and that  he feared that she would be helpless in a gale. But after the  disaster his mouth was stopped by the waters of the North Sea.    [Illustration: _A German Dirigible, Hansa Type._    (C) U.& U.]    This calamity was not permitted long to stand alone. Indeed one of  the most curious facts about the Zeppelin record is the regular,  periodical recurrence of fatal accidents at almost equal intervals  and apparently wholly unaffected by the growing perfection of the  airships. While _L-I_ was making her successful cross-country  flights, _L-II_ was reaching completion at Friedrichshaven. She was  shorter but bulkier than her immediate predecessor and carried  engines giving her nine hundred horse power, or four hundred more  than _L-I._ On its first official trip this ship exploded a thousand  feet in air, killing twenty-eight officers and men aboard, including  all the officials who were conducting the trials. The calamity, as  explained on an earlier page, was due to the accumulation of gas in  the communicating passage between the three cars.    [Illustration: _A Wrecked Zeppelin at Salonika._    Photo by Press Illustrating Service.]    This new disaster left the faith and loyalty of the German people  unshaken. But it did decidedly estrange the scientific world from  Count von Zeppelin and all his works. It was pointed out, with  truth, that the accident paralleled precisely one which had  demolished the _Severo Pax_ airship ten years earlier, and which had  caused French inventors to establish a hard and fast rule against  incorporating in an airship's design any inclosed space in which  waste gas might gather. This rule and its reason were known to Count  von Zeppelin and by ignoring both he lent new colour to the charge,  already current in scientific circles, that he was loath to profit  by the experiences of other inventors.    Whether this feeling spread to the German Government it is  impossible to say. Nor it is easy to estimate how much official  confidence was shaken by it. The government, even before the war,  was singularly reticent about the Zeppelins, their numbers and  plans. It is certain that orders were not withheld from the Count.  Great numbers of his machines were built, especially after the war  was entered upon. But he was not permitted longer to have a monopoly  of government aid for manufacturers of dirigibles. Other types  sprung up, notably the Schutte-Lanz, the Gross, and the Parseval.  But being first in the field the Zeppelin came to give its name to  all the dirigibles of German make and many of the famous--or  infamous--exploits credited to it during the war may in fact have  been performed by one of its rivals.    It would be futile to attempt to enumerate all these rivals here.  Among them are the semi-rigid Parseval and Gross types which found  great favour among the military authorities during the war. The  latter is merely an adaptation of the highly successful French ship  the _Lebaudy_, but the Parseval is the result of a slow evolution  from an ordinary balloon. It is wholly German, in conception and  development, and it is reported that the Kaiser, secretly disgusted  that the Zeppelins, to the advancement of which he had given such  powerful aid, should have recorded so many disasters, quietly  transferred his interest to the new and simpler model. Despite the  hope of a more efficient craft, however, both the Gross and the  Parseval failed in their first official trials, though later they  made good.    The latter ship was absolutely without any wooden or metallic  structure to give her rigidity. Two air ballonets were contained in  the envelope at bow and stern and the ascent and descent of the  ship was regulated by the quantity of air pumped into these. A most  curious device was the utilization of heavy cloth for the propeller  blades. Limp and flaccid when at rest, heavy weights in the hem of  the cloth caused these blades to stand out stiff and rigid as the  result of the centrifugal force created by their rapid revolution.  One great military advantage of the Parseval was that she could be  quickly deflated in the presence of danger at her moorings, and  wholly knocked down and packed in small compass for shipment by rail  in case of need. To neither of these models did there ever come such  a succession of disasters as befell the earlier Zeppelins. It is  fair to say however that prior to the war not many of them had been  built, and that both their builders and navigators had opportunity  to learn from Count von Zeppelin's errors.    Among the chief German rivals to the Zeppelin is the Schutte-Lanz,  of the rigid type, broader but not so long as the Zeppelin, framed  of wood bound with wire and planned to carry a load of five or six  tons, or as many as thirty passengers. No. I of this type met its  fate as did so many Zeppelins by encountering a storm while  improperly moored. Called to earth to replenish its supply of gas it  was moored to an anchor sunk six feet in the ground, and as an  additional precaution three hundred soldiers were called from a  neighbouring barracks to handle it. It seems to have been one of the  advantages of Germany as a place in which to manoeuvre dirigibles,  that, even in time of peace, there were always several hundred  soldiers available wherever a ship might land. But this force was  inadequate. A violent gust tore the ship from their hands. One poor  fellow instinctively clung to his rope until one thousand feet in  the air when he let go. The ship itself hovered over the town for an  hour or more, then descended and was dashed to pieces against trees  and stone walls.    The danger which was always attached to the landing of airships has  led some to suggest that they should never be brought to earth, but  moored in mid-air as large ships anchor in midstream. It is  suggested that tall towers be built to the top of which the ship be  attached by a cable, so arranged that she will always float to the  leeward of the tower. The passengers would be landed by gangplanks,  and taken up and down the towers in elevators. Kipling suggests this  expedient in his prophetic sketch _With the Night Mail_. The airship  would only return to earth--as a ship goes into dry dock--when in  need of repairs.    A curious mishap that threatened for a time to wreck the peace of  the world, occurred in April, 1913, when a German Zeppelin was  forced out of its course and over French territory. The right of  alien machines to pass over their territory is jealously guarded by  European nations, and during the progress of the Great War the Dutch  repeatedly protested against the violation of their atmosphere by  German aviators. At the time of this mischance, however, France and  Germany were at peace--or as nearly so as racial and historic  antipathies would permit. Accordingly when officers of a brigade of  French cavalry engaged in manoeuvring near the great fortress of  Luneville saw a shadow moving across the field and looking up saw a  huge Zeppelin betwixt themselves and the sun they were astonished  and alarmed. Signs and faint shouts from the aeronauts appeared to  indicate that their errand was at least friendly, if not  involuntary. The soldiers stopped their drill; the townspeople  trooped out to the Champs de Mars where the phenomenon was exhibited  and began excitedly discussing this suspicious invasion. Word was  speedily sent to military headquarters asking whether to welcome or  to repel the foe.    [Illustration: (C) U. & U.    _British Aviators about to Ascend._    _Note position of gunner on lower seat._]    Meantime the great ship was drifting perilously near the housetops,  and the uniformed officers in the cars began making signals to the  soldiers below. Ropes were thrown out, seized by willing hands and  made fast. The crew of Germans descended to find themselves  prisoners. The international law was clear enough. The ship was a  military engine of the German army. Its officers, all in uniform,  had deliberately steered her into the very heart of a French  fortress. Though the countries were at peace the act was technically  one of war--an armed invasion by the enemy. Diplomacy of course  settled the issue peacefully but not before the French had made  careful drawings of all the essential features of the Zeppelin, and  taken copies of its log. As Germany had theretofore kept a rigid  secrecy about all the details of Zeppelin construction and operation  this angered the military authorities beyond measure. The unlucky  officers who had shared in the accident were savagely told that they  should have blown the ship up in mid-air and perished with it rather  than to have weakly submitted it to French inspection. They suffered  court-martial but escaped with severe reprimands.    The story of the dirigibles of France and Germany is practically the  whole story of the development to a reasonable degree of perfection  of the lighter-than-air machine. Other nations experimented  somewhat, but in the main lagged behind these pioneers. Out of Spain  indeed came a most efficient craft--the Astra-Torres, of which the  British Government had the best example prior to the war, while both  France and Russia placed large orders with the builders. How many  finally went into service and what may have been their record are  facts veiled in the secrecy of wartime. Belgium and Italy both  produced dirigibles of distinctive character. The United States is  alone at the present moment in having contributed nothing to the  improvement of the dirigible balloon.

What? Who gave you any clues to point to my son?\"    \"Do you really wish to know?\"    \"I certainly do,\" was the sharp reply. Mr. Swift, the police and  several bank officials were now in the president's office. The latter  pressed an electric bell, and, when a messenger answered, he said:    \"Send young Foger here.\"    At the mention of this name, Mr. Swift started. He well knew the  red-haired bully was an enemy of his son. Andy entered, walking rather  proudly at the attention he attracted.    \"This is Mr. Swift,\" said the president.    \"Aw, I know him,\" blurted out Andy.    \"You will please tell him what you told us,\" went on Mr. Pendergast.    \"Well, I seen Tom Swift hanging around this bank with burglar tools in  his possession last night, just before it was robbed,\" exclaimed the  squint-eyed lad triumphantly.    \"Hanging around the bank last night with burglar tools?\" repeated Mr.  Swift, in dazed tones.    \"That's right,\" from Andy.    \"How do you know they were burglar tools?\"    \"Because I saw 'em!\" cried Andy. \"He had 'em in a valise on his  motor-cycle. He was standing at the corner, waiting for a chance to  break into the bank, and when me and Sam Snedecker saw him, he  pretended to be fixin' his machine. Then the bag of burglar tools fell  off, the satchel came open, and I seen 'em! That's how I know.\"    \"And you're sure they were burglar tools?\" asked the chief, for he  depended on Andy to be his most important witness.    \"Sure I am. I seen a picture of burglar tools once, and the ones Tom  had was just like 'em. Long-handled wrenches, brace an' bits, an' all.  He tried to hide 'em, but me an' Sam was too quick for him. He wanted  to lick me, too.\"    \"No doubt you deserved it,\" murmured Mr. Swift. \"But how do you know my  son was waiting for a chance to break into the bank?\"    \"'Cause, wasn't it robbed right after he was hangin' around here with  the burglar tools?\" inquired Andy, as if that was unanswerable.    \"What were you hanging around here for?\" Mr. Swift demanded quickly.    \"Me? Oh, well, me an' Sam Snedecker was out takin' a walk. That's all.\"    \"You didn't want to rob the bank, did you?\" went on the inventor,  keenly.    \"Of course not,\" roared the bully, indignantly. \"I ain't got no burglar  tools.\"    Andy told more along the same line, but his testimony of having seen  Tom near the bank, with a bag of odd tools could not be shaken. In fact  it was true, as far as it went, but, of course, the tools were only  those for the airship; the same ones Mr. Sharp had sent the lad after.  Sam Snedecker was called in after Andy, and told substantially the same  story.    Mr. Swift could not understand it, for he knew nothing of Tom being  sent for the tools, and had not heard any talk at home of the bag of  implements ordered by the balloonist. Still, of course, he knew Tom had  nothing to do with the robbery, and he knew his son had been at home  all the night previous. Still this was rather negative evidence.  But  the inventor had one question yet to ask.    \"You say you also suspect Mr. Damon of complicity in this affair?\" he  went on, to the chief of police.    \"We sure do,\" replied Mr. Simonson.    \"Then can you explain?\" proceeded the inventor, \"how it is that Mr.  Damon has on deposit in this bank a large sum. Would he rob the bank  where his own funds were?\"    \"We are prepared for that,\" declared the president. \"It is true that  Mr. Damon has about ten thousand dollars in our bank, but we believe he  deposited it only as a blind, so as to cover up his tracks. It is a  deep-laid scheme, and escaping in the airship is part of it. I am  sorry, Mr. Swift, that I have to believe your son and his accomplice  guilty, but I am obliged to. Chief, you had better send out a general  alarm. The airship ought to be easy to trace.\"    \"I'll telegraph at once,\" said the official.    \"And you believe my son guilty, solely on the testimony of these two  boys, who, as is well known, are his enemies?\" asked Mr. Swift.    \"The clue they gave us is certainly most important,\" said the  president. \"Andy came to us and told what he had seen, as soon as it  became known that the bank had been robbed.\"    \"And I'm going to get the reward for giving information of the robbers,  too!\" cried the bully.    \"I'm going to have my share!\" insisted Sam.    \"Ah, then there is a reward offered?\" inquired Mr. Swift.    \"Five thousand dollars,\" answered Mr. Pendergast. \"The directors, all  of whom are present save Mr. Foger, Andy's father, met early this  morning, and decided to offer that sum.\"    \"And I'm going to get it,\" announced the red-haired lad again.    Mr. Swift was much downcast. There seemed to be nothing more to say,  and, being a man unversed in the ways of the world, he did not know  what to do. He returned hone. When Mrs. Baggert was made acquainted  with the news, she waxed indignant.    \"Our Tom a thief!\" she cried. \"Why don't they accuse me and Mr. Jackson  and you? The idea! You ought to hire a lawyer, Mr. Swift, and prosecute  those men for slander.\"    \"Do you think it would be a good plan?\"    \"I certainly do. Why they have no evidence at all! What does that mean,  sneaking Andy Foger amount to? Get a lawyer, and have Tom's interests  looked after.\"    Mr. Swift, glad to have someone share the responsibility with, felt  somewhat better when a well-known Shopton attorney assured him that the  evidence against Tom was of such a flimsy character that it would  scarcely hold in a court of justice.    \"But they have warrants for him and Mr. Damon,\" declared the inventor.    \"Very true, but it is easy to swear out a warrant against any one.  It's a different matter to prove a person guilty.\"    \"But they can arrest my son.\"    \"Yes--if they catch him. However, we can soon have him released on  bail.\"    \"It's disgraceful,\" said Mrs. Baggert.    \"Not at all, my dear madam, not at all. Good and innocent persons have  been arrested.\"    \"They are going to send out a general alarm for my son,\" bewailed Mr.  Swift.    \"Yes, but I fancy it will be some time before they catch him and Mr.  Damon, if the airship holds together. I can't think of a better way to  keep out of the clutches of the police, and their silly charge,\"  chuckled the lawyer. \"Now don't worry, Mr. Swift. It will all come out  right.\"    The inventor tried to believe so, but, though he knew his son was  innocent, it was rather hard to see, within the next few days, big  posters on all the vacant walls and fences, offering a reward of five  thousand dollars for the arrest of Tom Swift and Wakefield Damon, who  were charged with having flown away in an airship with seventy-five  thousand dollars of the bank's money.    \"I guess Tom Swift will wish he'd been more decent to me when I collect  that money for his arrest,\" said Andy to his crony, Sam, the day the  bills were posted.    \"Yes, but I get my share, don't I?\" asked Sam.    \"Sure,\" answered the bully. \"I wish they'd hurry up and arrest him.\"    Within the next few days the country was covered with posters telling  of the robbery and the reward, and police officials in cities large and  small, and in towns and villages, were notified by telegraph to arrest  and capture, at any cost the occupants of a certain large, red airship.    Mr. Swift, on the advice of his lawyer, sent several telegrams to Tom,  apprising him of what had happened. The telegraph company was asked to  rush the telegrams to the first city when word came in that the Red  Cloud had landed.          Chapter 15    Fired Upon      Tom's excited call to the aeronaut, telling of the mishap to Mr. Damon,  was answered immediately. Mr. Sharp jumped forward from the motor  compartment, and, passing on his way the electric switch, he yanked it  out, stopping the machinery, and the great propellers. Then he leaped  out on the platform.    But something else happened. Just before the accident to the eccentric  man, desiring to give a further test to the planes, the gas had been  shut off, making the airship an aeroplane instead of a dirigible  balloon. Consequently, as soon as the forward motion ceased the great  ship began falling.    \"We're sinking! We're sinking!\" cried Tom, forgetting for a moment that  he was not in his motor-boat.    \"Slant your rudder up, and glide downward as slowly as you can!\"  directed Mr. Sharp. \"I'll start the engine again as soon as I rescue  him,\" for it was risky to venture out on the platform with the  propeller whirring, as the dangling piece of scarf might whip around  the balloonist and toss him off.    Mr. Sharp was soon at Mr. Damon's side. He saw that the man was  unconscious, whether from fright or some injury could not then be  determined. There was, however, no sign of a wound.    It was no easy task to carry, half dragging it, the heavy body of Mr.  Damon off the platform, but the aeronaut was a muscular individual, and  long hanging from a trapeze, at great heights, stood him in good stead.    He brought the unconscious man into the cabin, and then, quickly  returning to the platform, he detached the piece of scarf from the  propeller blade. Next he started the motor, and also turned on the gas  tank, so that the airship, in a few minutes, could float in space  without motion.    \"You needn't steer now, Tom,\" said the balloonist. \"Just give me a hand  here.\"    \"Is--is he dead?\" inquired the lad, his voice faltering.    \"No, his heart's beating. I can't understand what happened.\"    Mr. Sharp was something of a rough and ready surgeon and doctor, and a  small box of medicines had been brought along in case of emergencies.  With the Red Cloud now lazily floating in the air, for, once the  falling motion had been checked by the engine, the motor had been  stopped again, Mr. Sharp set about restoring Mr. Damon to consciousness.    It was not long before the man opened his eyes. The color that had left  his cheeks came back, and, after a drink of cold water he was able to  sit up. "]]]
