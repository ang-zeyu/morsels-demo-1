SIEGMUND            [_Bends tenderly over Sieglinde, kisses her softly          on the brow, and turns again quietly to Brünnhilde._          Then greet for me Walhall,        Greet for me Wotan,        Greet for me Wälse        And all the heroes,        Wishmaidens lovely        Greet thou also,    And tell them I will not come!    BRÜNNHILDE          Nay, having looked        On the Valkyrie's face,    Thou must follow her forth!    SIEGMUND          Where Sieglinde dwells        In weal or woe,    There will Siegmund dwell also;        My face grew not pale        When I beheld thee:    Thou canst not force me to go!    BRÜNNHILDE          Force thee can none        While thou dost live;    Fool, what will force thee is death        Warning of death        Is what I bring.    SIEGMUND          What hero to-day        Shall hew me down?    BRÜNNHILDE          Hunding's hand in the fight.    SIEGMUND          Use threats more baleful        Than blows from Hunding!        Lurkest thou here        Longing for strife,    Fix on him for thy prey.    I think it is he who will fall!    BRÜNNHILDE          Nay, Wälsung,        Doubt not my word;    Thine is the death decreed.    SIEGMUND          Knowest this sword?        Who gave the sword        Gave triumph sure:    With this sword I laugh at thy threats.    BRÜNNHILDE [_In a loud voice._          He whose it was        Now dooms thee to death,    For the magic spell he withdraws!    SIEGMUND [_Vehemently._          Hush! Alarm not        The slumberer here!            [_In an outburst of grief he bends tenderly over          Sieglinde._          Woe! Woe!        Woman most sweet!    Most sad and ill-starred of all true ones!        Against thee rages        The whole world in arms,    And I who was all thy defence,    For whom thou the world hast defied--        To think I cannot        Shield thee, but, beaten    In battle, thy trust must betray!        O shame on him        Who bestowed the sword,    And triumph now turns to scorn!        If I must fall thus,        I fare to no Walhall--    Hella hold me for aye!            [_He bends low over Sieglinde._    BRÜNNHILDE [_Moved._          So little prizest thou        Life everlasting?            [_Slowly and with hesitation._          All thy care        Is thy helpless wife        Who, sad and weary,    Heavily hangs in thy arms?    Precious only is she?    SIEGMUND [_Looking up at her bitterly._          Though young and fair        Thou shinest to me,        In my heart I know thee        Cruel and cold!        Canst thou do nothing        But mock me, begone,    Malicious, merciless maid!        Or if thou must gloat        Upon my distress,    Then gloat and feast thyself full!        With my woe        Solace thy envious soul:--    But of Walhall's loveless raptures    Nothing more let me hear!    BRÜNNHILDE          I see the distress        That is tearing thy heart;        The doomed hero's holy        Sorrow I feel.    Siegmund, thy wife be my charge,    Protected safely by me.    SIEGMUND          No other than I    While my wife is living shall guard her.        If death be my lot    I will slay the slumberer first!    BRÜNNHILDE [_With increasing emotion._          Wälsung! Madman!        Listen to me!        Entrust her to me        For the pledge's sake    That she carries of thee and thy love!    SIEGMUND [_Drawing his sword._          This sword    That a true man received from a false--        This sword    That fails me when facing the foe;    Worthless when turned on the foe,    Will serve me when turned on the friend.            [_He points the sword at Sieglinde._          Two lives now        Laugh to thee here:        Take them, Nothung,        Envious steel!    Take them with one fell stroke!    BRÜNNHILDE [_With a passionate outburst of sympathy._          Forbear, Walsung!        Listen to me!        Sieglinde spare thou,    And Siegmund too shall be spared!        'Tis thus decreed,        Recast the lot is!        Thou, Siegmund,    Shalt be blest and prevail!    [_Horns are heard in the distance._          Hark to the horn!        Prepare for the fray;        Trust to the sword        And strike without fear:    Thy sword shall prove strong    Thee the Valkyrie faithfully shields!        Farewell, Siegmund,        Hero most blest!    On the field again I shall find thee.    [_She rushes away and disappears with her horse down  a gorge on the right. Siegmund gazes after her  joyful and exultant. The stage has gradually grown  dark. Heavy storm-clouds have gathered in the  background, and hide the cliffs, gorge, and rocky pass  completely from view._    SIEGMUND [_Bending over Sieglinde, listens to her breathing._          Charmèd slumber        Softly soothes    The dear one's pain and grief.    When the Valkyrie came, perchance    She brought her this blissful repose;    Else would the grimly fought fight    Have terrified one in such woe.        Lifeless seems she,        And yet she lives;        The sad one by smiling        Dreams is caressed.        In slumber lie soft        Till the fight is won    And peace shall end thy pain!    [_He lays her gently on the rocky seat and  kisses her brow in farewell. Then, hearing  Hunding's horn sound, he starts up  with resolution._          Thou who dost call,        Arm for the fray;        Thy dues in full        Thou shalt have:            [_He draws his sword._      Nothung pays him his debt.            [_He hastens to the back and, on reaching the pass,          immediately disappears in a dark thunder-cloud,          from which, the next instant, a flash of lightning          breaks._    SIEGLINDE [_Begins to move uneasily in her dreams._      Would but my father come back!    With the boy he still roams in the wood.        Mother! Mother!        I am afraid--        The strangers seem        So harsh and unfriendly!        Fumes that stifle--        Dense and black smoke--        Fierce are the flames,        And closer they flare--        On fire the house!        O help us, brother!        Siegmund! Siegmund!            [_She starts up. Violent thunder and lightning._          Siegmund! Ha!            [_She stares about her in growing terror. Almost          the whole of the stage is veiled by black          thunder-clouds. Hunding's horn is heard close at          hand._    HUNDING'S VOICE [_From the mountain pass in the background._          Wehwalt! Wehwalt!        Stand there and fight,    Or with the hounds I will hold thee!    SIEGMUND'S VOICE [_From farther back in the gorge._          Where hidest thou,    That I have missed thee thus?    Halt, that I may find thee!    SIEGLINDE [_Listening in terrible fear._          Hunding--Siegmund--        Could I but see them!    HUNDING      Come hither, impious wooer!    Here by Fricka be slain!    SIEGMUND [_Also from the pass now._          Thou thinkest me weaponless,        Coward, still.        Threat not with women!        Thyself now fight me,    Lest Fricka fail thee at need!        For see, from the tree        That grows by thy hearth    I drew undaunted the sword;    Come and try the taste of its steel!    SIEGLINDE [_With all her strength._          Hold your hands, ye men there!        Strike me dead first!            [_She rushes towards the pass, but is suddenly          dazzled by a light which flashes forth from above          the combatants to the right, and staggers aside as          if blinded._    BRÜNNHILDE'S VOICE          Strike him, Siegmund!        Trust to the sword!            [_Brünnhilde appears in the glare of light,          floating above Siegmund, and protecting him with          her shield. Just as Siegmund is aiming a deadly          blow at Hunding a glowing red light breaks through          the clouds from the left, in which Wotan appears,          standing over Hunding and holding his spear across          in front of Siegmund._    WOTAN'S VOICE          Back! Back from the spear!        In splinters the sword!            [_Brünnhilde with her shield recoils in terror          before Wotan; Siegmund's sword breaks in splinters          on the outstretched spear. Hunding plunges his          sword into the disarmed man's breast. Siegmund          falls down dead, and Sieglinde, who has heard his          death-sigh, sinks to the ground as if lifeless.          With Siegmund's fall the lights on both sides          disappear. Dense clouds shroud all but the          foreground in darkness. Through these Brünnhilde is          dimly seen turning in wild haste to Sieglinde._    BRÜNNHILDE          To horse, that I may save thee!            [_She lifts Sieglinde up quickly on to her horse,          which is standing near the side ravine, and          immediately disappears. Thereupon the clouds divide          in the middle, so that Hunding, who has just drawn          his sword out of Siegmund's breast, is distinctly          seen. Wotan, surrounded by clouds, stands on a rock          behind, leaning on his spear and gazing sorrowfully          on Siegmund's body._    WOTAN [_To Hunding._          Begone, slave!        Kneel before Fricka;    Tell her that Wotan's spear    Has slain what mocked her might.        Go! Go!            [_Before the contemptuous wave of his hand Hunding          falls dead to the ground. Suddenly breaking out in          terrible anger._          But Brünnhilde!        Woe to the guilty one!        Woe to her        As soon as my horse    Shall overtake her in flight!

On the left is the entrance  to a cave, above which the rock rises to its highest point. At the  back the view is quite open. Rocks of varying heights form the edge  of the precipice.

I am sorry, Shaggy Man, that I can not offer you a change  of clothing; but I dress only in tin, myself, and I suppose that would  not suit you.\"    \"I care little about dress,\" said the shaggy man, indifferently.    \"So I should imagine,\" replied the Emperor, with true politeness.    They were shown to their rooms and permitted to make such toilets as  they could, and soon they assembled again in the grand tin dining-hall,  even Toto being present.  For the Emperor was fond of Dorothy's little  dog, and the girl explained to her friends that in Oz all animals were  treated with as much consideration as the people--\"if they behave  themselves,\" she added.    Toto behaved himself, and sat in a tin high-chair beside Dorothy and  ate his dinner from a tin platter.    Indeed, they all ate from tin dishes, but these were of pretty shapes  and brightly polished; Dorothy thought they were just as good as silver.    Button-Bright looked curiously at the man who had \"no appetite inside  him,\" for the Tin Woodman, although he had prepared so fine a feast for  his guests, ate not a mouthful himself, sitting patiently in his place  to see that all built so they could eat were well and plentifully  served.    What pleased Button-Bright most about the dinner was the tin orchestra  that played sweet music while the company ate.  The players were not  tin, being just ordinary Winkies; but the instruments they played upon  were all tin--tin trumpets, tin fiddles, tin drums and cymbals and  flutes and horns and all.  They played so nicely the \"Shining Emperor  Waltz,\" composed expressly in honor of the Tin Woodman by Mr. H. M.  Wogglebug, T.E., that Polly could not resist dancing to it.  After she  had tasted a few dewdrops, freshly gathered for her, she danced  gracefully to the music while the others finished their repast; and  when she whirled until her fleecy draperies of rainbow hues enveloped  her like a cloud, the Tin Woodman was so delighted that he clapped his  tin hands until the noise of them drowned the sound of the cymbals.    Altogether it was a merry meal, although Polychrome ate little and the  host nothing at all.    \"I'm sorry the Rainbow's Daughter missed her mist-cakes,\" said the Tin  Woodman to Dorothy; \"but by a mistake Miss Polly's mist-cakes were  mislaid and not missed until now.  I'll try to have some for her  breakfast.\"    They spent the evening telling stories, and the next morning left the  splendid tin castle and set out upon the road to the Emerald City.  The  Tin Woodman went with them, of course, having by this time been so  brightly polished that he sparkled like silver.  His axe, which he  always carried with him, had a steel blade that was tin plated and a  handle covered with tin plate beautifully engraved and set with  diamonds.    The Winkies assembled before the castle gates and cheered their Emperor  as he marched away, and it was easy to see that they all loved him  dearly.          16.  Visiting the Pumpkin-Field      Dorothy let Button-Bright wind up the clock-work in the copper man this  morning--his thinking machine first, then his speech, and finally his  action; so he would doubtless run perfectly until they had reached the  Emerald City.  The copper man and the tin man were good friends, and  not so much alike as you might think.  For one was alive and the other  moved by means of machinery; one was tall and angular and the other  short and round.  You could love the Tin Woodman because he had a fine  nature, kindly and simple; but the machine man you could only admire  without loving, since to love such a thing as he was as impossible as  to love a sewing-machine or an automobile.  Yet Tik-tok was popular  with the people of Oz because he was so trustworthy, reliable and true;  he was sure to do exactly what he was wound up to do, at all times and  in all circumstances.  Perhaps it is better to be a machine that does  its duty than a flesh-and-blood person who will not, for a dead truth  is better than a live falsehood.    About noon the travelers reached a large field of pumpkins--a vegetable  quite appropriate to the yellow country of the Winkies--and some of the  pumpkins which grew there were of remarkable size.  Just before they  entered upon this field they saw three little mounds that looked like  graves, with a pretty headstone to each one of them.    \"What is this?\"  asked Dorothy, in wonder.    \"It's Jack Pumpkinhead's private graveyard,\" replied the Tin Woodman.    \"But I thought nobody ever died in Oz,\" she said.    \"Nor do they; although if one is bad, he may be condemned and killed by  the good citizens,\" he answered.    Dorothy ran over to the little graves and read the words engraved upon  the tombstones.  The first one said:      Here Lies the Mortal Part of        JACK PUMPKINHEAD    Which Spoiled April 9th.      She then went to the next stone, which read:      Here Lies the Mortal Part of        JACK PUMPKINHEAD    Which Spoiled October 2nd.      On the third stone were carved these words:      Here Lies the Mortal Part of        JACK PUMPKINHEAD    Which Spoiled January 24th.      \"Poor Jack!\" sighed Dorothy.  \"I'm sorry he had to die in three parts,  for I hoped to see him again.\"    \"So you shall,\" declared the Tin Woodman, \"since he is still alive.  Come with me to his house, for Jack is now a farmer and lives in this  very pumpkin field.\"    They walked over to a monstrous big, hollow pumpkin which had a door  and windows cut through the rind.  There was a stovepipe running  through the stem, and six steps had been built leading up to the front  door.    They walked up to this door and looked in.  Seated on a bench was a man  clothed in a spotted shirt, a red vest, and faded blue trousers, whose  body was merely sticks of wood, jointed clumsily together.  On his neck  was set a round, yellow pumpkin, with a face carved on it such as a boy  often carves on a jack-lantern.    This queer man was engaged in snapping slippery pumpkin-seeds with his  wooden fingers, trying to hit a target on the other side of the room  with them.  He did not know he had visitors until Dorothy exclaimed:    \"Why, it's Jack Pumpkinhead himself!\"    He turned and saw them, and at once came forward to greet the little  Kansas girl and Nick Chopper, and to be introduced to their new friends.    Button-Bright was at first rather shy with the quaint Pumpkinhead, but  Jack's face was so jolly and smiling--being carved that way--that the  boy soon grew to like him.    \"I thought a while ago that you were buried in three parts,\" said  Dorothy, \"but now I see you're just the same as ever.\"    \"Not quite the same, my dear, for my mouth is a little more one-sided  than it used to be; but pretty nearly the same.  I've a new head, and  this is the fourth one I've owned since Ozma first made me and brought  me to life by sprinkling me with the Magic Powder.\"    \"What became of the other heads, Jack?\"    \"They spoiled and I buried them, for they were not even fit for pies.  Each time Ozma has carved me a new head just like the old one, and as  my body is by far the largest part of me, I am still Jack Pumpkinhead,  no matter how often I change my upper end.  Once we had a dreadful time  to find another pumpkin, as they were out of season, and so I was  obliged to wear my old head a little longer than was strictly healthy.  But after this sad experience I resolved to raise pumpkins myself, so  as never to be caught again without one handy; and now I have this fine  field that you see before you.  Some grow pretty big--too big to be  used for heads--so I dug out this one and use it for a house.\"    \"Isn't it damp?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Not very.  There isn't much left but the shell, you see, and it will  last a long time yet.\"    \"I think you are brighter than you used to be, Jack,\" said the Tin  Woodman.  \"Your last head was a stupid one.\"    \"The seeds in this one are better,\" was the reply.    \"Are you going to Ozma's party?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Yes,\" said he, \"I wouldn't miss it for anything.  Ozma's my parent,  you know, because she built my body and carved my pumpkin head.  I'll  follow you to the Emerald City to-morrow, where we shall meet again.  I  can't go to-day, because I have to plant fresh pumpkin-seeds and water  the young vines.  But give my love to Ozma, and tell her I'll be there  in time for the jubilation.\"    \"We will,\" she promised; and then they all left him and resumed their  journey.          17.  The Royal Chariot Arrives      The neat yellow houses of the Winkies were now to be seen standing here  and there along the roadway, giving the country a more cheerful and  civilized look.  They were farm-houses, though, and set far apart; for  in the Land of Oz there were no towns or villages except the  magnificent Emerald City in its center.    Hedges of evergreen or of yellow roses bordered the broad highway and  the farms showed the care of their industrious inhabitants.  The nearer  the travelers came to the great city the more prosperous the country  became, and they crossed many bridges over the sparkling streams and  rivulets that watered the lands.    As they walked leisurely along the shaggy man said to the Tin Woodman:    \"What sort of a Magic Powder was it that made your friend the  Pumpkinhead live?\"    \"It was called the Powder of Life,\" was the answer; \"and it was  invented by a crooked Sorcerer who lived in the mountains of the North  Country.  A Witch named Mombi got some of this powder from the crooked  Sorcerer and took it home with her.  Ozma lived with the Witch then,"]]]
