[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49131"],[0,"Wings over England (#15)"],[1," a veteran fighter had said to him, \"Wick may be a coward. I  wouldn't doubt that. But he's been a long time in the air. And that  means just one thing, he knows how to pick brave men to do his fighting  for him.\"    \"Brave men,\" Dave whispered as he clutched his 'joy stick' with a firmer  grip. Then, through his radio headset, above the roar of motors, he  caught a familiar sound. It was one of the tunes Fiddlin' Johnny had  played back there in the Hideout. It was \"Londonderry Air.\" Startled, as  if expecting to see the strange boy fiddling as he flew, he glanced  back. Johnny was in his place, all right, staring straight ahead.    \"Whistling!\" Dave murmured. \"How do they do it?\"    \"Those Messerschmitts are looking for bombers, not fighters,\" he told  himself. \"Haven't seen us yet.\"    The young Lord barked an order into his receiver. \"We'll climb into the  sun, then drop down upon them.\"    They climbed. They circled until the sun was at their backs. Then, with  motors booming, they swept down upon the enemy.    With a sudden burst of speed the Messerschmitts scattered. Two planes  alone remained in formation.    \"That will be Wick and his bravest guard,\" Dave told himself as a thrill  coursed up his spine.    He was all for the fight now. Gladly he would have followed that pair,  but it had been agreed that in a case of this kind the flight leader and  the Lark, most experienced men of the flight, should step in where  danger called most loudly.    With the hot blood of battle at last coursing in his veins, Dave went  after a single, fleeing Messerschmitt.    He was faster than the enemy. Now a mile lay between them, now a half  mile, a quarter. The enemy darted this way, then that. \"Trying to shake  me off,\" Dave muttered. He was thinking at that moment of their  shattered home. He should have sweet revenge.    He was all but upon the Messerschmitt. One more burst of speed. Now it  was time to press the button. One thousand shots a minute! No! He'd  better drop a little, to come up from below. Three hundred and fifty  miles an hour. This was life.    Suddenly the air was torn by the rip and rattle of machine-gun fire, not  his fire but another's. Slugs tore into his right wing. Gripping his  emergency boost, he set his plane banking madly to the left. Forty  seconds of this, then he let go that emergency lever.    Standing on one wing, he executed a mad whirl, then righted himself.    \"What had happened?\" As his eyes swept the sky he heard again that weird  whistle, the Fiddler's, doing \"Londonderry Air.\"    Next instant he spotted the Whistler. Right on the tail of a plane, he  was at that very instant gripping the firing button. Once again the sky  was torn with the haunting rip-rip-rip that spelled death.    What effect did the fiddler's shots have upon the enemy? Dave was not to  know, at least not for a long time. At that instant he caught sight of a  Messerschmitt zooming up from behind and below his comrade. He watched  with horror as a great burst of fire seemed to blot Fiddlin' Johnny from  the sky.    One second the Messerschmitt was there. The next it was gone. With  sinking heart Dave saw Fiddlin' Johnny's plane go into a spin, then  spiral down, down until it was lost in a cloud.    He listened. Save for the roar of his own motor, a muffled roar it was  now, he caught no sound. The whistle was dead. But what of the whistler?    Not until then did Dave become conscious of his own motor. He was losing  altitude. His hand was brown with oil. His motor had been hit, perhaps  more than once. Just when a Messerschmitt came zooming at him he slipped  into a cloud.    He was thinking hard and fast now. He was out of the fight, that was  sure. Was he too far out over the ocean to make landing before his motor  died? Where was land? A glance at his compass, a slow half-swing about,  then he flew straight ahead.    He was losing altitude faster now. In vain did he attempt to get more  power from the motor.    There was the sea, and there, seeming far, far away, was land. He'd  never make it. A cold, calm sea lay beneath him. How long could one live  in that water? He'd have a try. Unsnapping his safety belt, he waited.  How long before his ship sank? Not long, he guessed.    Then his eye caught something on the surface of the sea. A boat?  Perhaps. Didn't look quite like that. At least it was fairly large and  it floated.    Swinging half about, he went into a slow spiral, that would land him, he  hoped, close to that mysterious, floating gray spot.    It did. Leaping from his plane, he did a slow crawl, waiting to see if  his plane would sink. Three minutes more and it was gone.    Turning, he swam toward that floating thing. What was it? He could not  tell. All he knew was that once he reached it he would escape from the  bitter, biting chill of the sea.                                       _Chapter_ XVII                                Playing War      Meantime the young Lord had gone streaking after the self-appointed ace  of the Huns and his most trusted guard. The Lark and Brand had remained  in formation behind their leader. A fast and furious race had followed.  The Nazis had climbed to dizzy heights. Turning on the oxygen, the young  Lord and the Lark followed on their tails, but always a little too far  behind for attack.    Unaccustomed to the climb, Brand was thinking of dropping out. Turning  to look back, he caught his breath, stared again, then leveled off for  greater speed. He had seen Fiddlin' Johnny go into a spin and had read  in this disaster for his good pal Dave. He went to the rescue but too  late. By the time he reached the scene both Dave and pursuer had  vanished into the clouds.    Swinging about, he searched the sky for the young Lord and his fighting  companion.    \"There! There they are!\" he exclaimed excitedly. \"They win!\" He was just  in time to see an enemy plane go streaking down all in flames. At the  same instant, some distance away, he saw a second enemy craft vanish  into a cloud.    \"Tough luck,\" the young Lord grumbled into his speaker as Brand came up.  \"We got Wick's favorite guard but the big boaster got away. Well, better  luck next time. Where's Dave and the Fiddler?\"    \"Johnny's gone for good.\" Brand's voice was low and solemn. \"He seemed a  real fellow. I--I'm sorry. He went down in a spin, quite out of control.  He can't have come out of it. It's taps for him.\"    \"Taps for poor old Johnny.\" No more shouting today for The Lark. The  flight's scant triumph had cost them too dearly.    \"I lost Dave in a cloud,\" Brand went on. \"I--I don't know about him.\"    \"We'll drop down and have a look,\" said the young Lord. They did have a  look. They fairly scoured the sea. All that met the eye was wide  stretches of leaden, grey sea--that and a lone flock of wild ducks  streaking away to the south.    \"Ducks. Little old wild things,\" The Lark grumbled. \"Got more sense than  humans.\"    And so, with heavy hearts, they turned their planes landward. After that  not a word was spoken until their Spitfires bump-bumped on the landing  field.    That same afternoon Cherry walked alone to the village. She wanted time  to think. And, indeed there was need for thinking. That morning her  mother had driven out and had taken her to the city. There they visited  the office of a famous specialist.    \"This,\" said Mrs. Ramsey, \"is Cherry.\"    \"Cherry, the Singing Angel!\" exclaimed the doctor. \"I am surely glad to  meet you. It's a wonderful work you are doing.\"    \"That I _was_ doing,\" Cherry whispered hoarsely.    \"Why! What's up? Voice troubling you? Let's have a look! We'll fix it up  right away.\"    After a long and painstaking examination the good doctor looked at her  with trouble in his eyes. \"Nothing the matter with your throat,  absolutely nothing,\" he said solemnly.    \"But I can't talk. I--\"    \"Yes, yes, I'm not doubting you.\" The doctor walked slowly back and  forth. \"It's just one more case of war shock.    \"You see,\" he began, after waving the ladies into chairs, \"it's like  this. You, my child, are not afraid of bombs. That is, you are  determined not to be. So are we all. We won't let the enemy get us down.  That's grand! Magnificent! The true British spirit.    \"But, my dear,\" his voice dropped, \"that is all in your mind. Your body  has other things to say. It is truly afraid, and you can do nothing  about it.    \"In such a case your body breaks down at its weakest point. In your case  it is your voice. I have a patient who buys old stamps. He's forever  peering through a glass, examining stamps, using his eyes. He wasn't  afraid of bombs. But his body was. He went totally blind. Since he was  an American, I packed him into the Clipper and sent him home. And now,\"  the doctor spread his arms wide, \"he's quite all right again.\"    \"But doctor, what am I to do?\" There was agony in Cherry's whisper.    \"Go to America. Two weeks there and you will be well. Then come back and  take up your work once more. It's your only chance. Is it worth the  trouble?\"    \"But I can't. I--\"    \"Yes, you can.\" Mrs. Ramsey was on her feet. \"I have it. The very thing!  The boat sails next Monday.\"    \"The boat? What boat, mother?\" Cherry stared.    \"They have chartered a boat to carry refugee children to America. I was  discussing the sending of Peggy and Tillie this very morning. The  welfare workers wish to send a grown person with each group of ten  children to look after them, direct their play, keep them cheerful and  happy. Cherry, you shall be one of these. I shall see to it at once.\"    \"But mother!\" Cherry's whisper was pathetic. \"It's so sudden. I must  have time to think.\"    \"Very well,\" said her mother, dismissing the whole affair for a moment  by a wave of her hand. \"Think as much as you please until this time  tomorrow.\"    And so now Cherry, as she walked slowly toward the village, was thinking  hard. Could she do it? Leave Alice, Brand, and Dave, all her friends to  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4932"],[0,"A Knight of the White Cross: A Tale of the Siege of Rhodes (#15)"],[1,"take with you?\"    \"Two will be sufficient, for we shall have no fighting to do, as we  shall have to trust to our speed if we fall in with an enemy. I will  take, with your permission, Sir Ralph Harcourt and Sir Gervaise Tresham,  both of whom have today fought with distinguished bravery. Indeed, I  owe my life to them, for more than once, when I was hotly pressed, they  freed me from my assailants. Truly none bore themselves better in the  fray than they did.\"    Three or four others joined in hearty commendations of the two young  knights.    \"Indeed,\" one said, \"I was greatly surprised to see how Tresham bore  himself. He is but a lad, with scarce, one would think, strength to hold  his own in such a fray. It chanced that he was next to me in the circle,  and for a time I kept my eye on him, thinking he might require my aid;  but I soon saw that I need not trouble myself on his account, for he  wielded his weapon as doughtily as the best knight of the Order could  have done, and one of the proofs is that, while most of us bear marks of  the conflict, he has escaped without scratch. I trust, Sir Louis, that  when you give an account of the fighting you will specially mention that  this, the youngest knight of the Order, bore himself as stoutly as any  of them. I say this, Sir John, because, not being of your langue, I can  speak more warmly than you can do of his skill and bravery.\"    \"I thank you, De Boysey,\" Sir John Boswell said, \"and I am proud that  my young countryman should have so gained your approbation. And now,\"  he went on, \"while the galley slaves are getting a meal--which they have  right well earned today--I should like to see what there is under the  hatches of these ships, so that I can give our comrades in the other  galleys some idea of the value of this booty we have taken.\"    They rose from the table, and, going on board the prizes, lifted the  hatches.    \"Beware!\" De Boysey exclaimed, looking down into the hold, when the  first hatch was taken off. \"There are people below.\"    A chorus of cries followed his exclamation.    \"They are the voices of women and children,\" Sir Louis exclaimed. \"They  must be captives.\"    This turned out to be so. In the holds of the four ships were found over  a hundred and fifty women and children; these had been brought on board  in the first boat loads by the pirates, and when the Christian galley  had been seen coming round the point, had been thrust below, and the  hatches thrown over them. They had heard the din of battle above, but  knew not how the conflict had terminated, and, being afraid to cry out,  had remained silent until, on the hatch being lifted, they had seen the  figures of Christian knights standing in the bright sunshine. All had  come from the village on the other side of the island. They related how  the pirates had suddenly burst upon them, had slaughtered all the men,  set fire to the village, and had driven them before them across the  island to the ships. The poor creatures were delighted at their escape  from slavery, but at the same time were full of grief at the loss of  husbands, fathers, and sons.    Some laughed, others cried; while some thanked God for their rescue  others heaped imprecations upon the authors of their misfortunes.    The knights explained to them that for a short time they must remain on  board, as half the pirates were still on shore, but that aid would soon  arrive that would enable them to clear the island.    Half an hour later Sir John Boswell, with the two young knights, started  in a rowing boat, manned by ten of the galley slaves. The wind had  sprung up since the fight ceased, and as it was nearly astern, they  anticipated that they would make a good passage, and be at the little  islet, named as the place of rendezvous, before nightfall.    Among the many bales of rich merchandise in the hold of the pirate  vessels an abundance of wine had been discovered, and of this a tankard  had been given to each of the slaves, by Sir Louis's orders, as a token  of satisfaction at their work in the morning.    They had gone some two miles when, from one of the inlets in the island  they had left a large fishing boat was seen to issue out.    \"By St. George!\" Sir John exclaimed, \"that boat must be full of pirates.  And if they see us, which they cannot help doing, and take it in their  heads to chase us, we shall have a hard time of it.\"    The fishing boat for a few minutes kept along the coast, and then  suddenly her course was altered, and her head directed towards their  boat.    \"Now stretch to your oars,\" Sir John, who spoke some Turkish, said to  the slaves. \"Keep ahead of that boat, and I promise you, on my honour as  a Christian knight, that I will myself purchase your freedom as soon as  we get to Rhodes.\"    With a shout of delight, the galley slaves bent to their oars, and the  boat flew along at a greatly increased speed.    \"There is but small chance of our getting away,\" Sir John said quietly.  \"At present we must be rowing as fast as they sail; but wind never  tires, while there are limits to the powers of muscle and bone. If those  fellows follow us--and I doubt not that they will, for they must be  thirsting for vengeance--they will overtake us long before we get to the  rendezvous; and even did we reach it, the chances are that we should not  find either of the galleys there. We must hold on as long as we can,  and as a last resource must run ashore. Unfortunately there are no large  islands on our way. Nor have we any hope of assistance from our friends  behind. The inlet looks east, and they will know nothing of our danger;  nor, if they did, could they help us. The galley is short handed now,  and there are the captured ships to look after, and the captives we  rescued. We have only ourselves to depend on.\"    At the end of an hour's rowing the boat astern had gained little; but  the exertions of the rowers were telling severely upon them. They were  still doing their best, but their breath came in short gasps, the rowing  was getting short and unsteady, and there was a sensible decrease in the  speed of the boat. Three miles ahead of them was an islet about half  a mile in diameter. In some parts it was covered with foliage, but  elsewhere it was bare rock.    \"That must be our goal,\" Sir John said. \"They will be close to us by the  time we get there.\" Then he said to the rowers, \"Stop for a minute to  get breath. We will land at that islet ahead, and I shall hold to my  promise if we get there in time. Those of you who like can remain in the  boat until your countrymen come up; those who choose can leave the boat  and hide yourselves as best you may. I leave the choice to yourselves.  If we are overtaken and fall, I cannot keep my promise, and it will be  best then for you to remain in the boat.\"    For three or four minutes the slaves bent forward over their oars; but  as soon as Sir John gave the word they straightened themselves up and  began rowing again. The rest had done them good, and they again fell  into a long, steady stroke.    \"Shall we buckle on our armour again?\" Sir Ralph Harcourt asked; for  they had not put it on when they left the ship, as the heat was very  great.    \"I think we had better don our mail shirts only. In climbing about that  rock ahead of us, the less weight we carry the better, and with this  heat I would rather fight unprotected than in casque and armour.  Besides, there can be little doubt that, if they come upon us, it will  be our last battle. That craft behind is crowded with men, and, armour  or no armour, it will come to the same in the end. If it were not that  we have a mission to fulfil, and that it is of all things important to  send the galleys to aid our friends, I would say let us choose a spot  at the foot of the rocks there, where they cannot attack us in the rear,  and there fight it out as becomes knights of the Cross; but as it is our  duty above all things to carry this message, we must strive to preserve  our lives, and must, if we can, conceal ourselves from these paynims.\"    \"What are you going to do?\" Sir John asked the slaves, when they were  within a quarter of a mile of the islet. \"I should think, after we have  left the boat, it will be best for you to sit quietly on your benches  till our pursuers arrive.\"    \"They would cut our throats at once, Sir Knight; they will be furious at  our having given them so long a chase. Hassan Ali's men care little whom  they slay, and, irritated by their misfortune, it will be naught to them  whether we are Moslem or Christian. I, for one, shall take to the woods,  and hide.\"    There was a chorus of assent among the other rowers.    \"I trust that you may escape,\" the knight said. \"It is for us they  will be hunting, and if they catch and slay us they will not trouble to  search the island further.\"    \"It seems to me, Sir John,\" Gervaise said, \"that with the aid of these  good fellows we may yet have a chance of escape.\"    \"What is your plan, Sir Gervaise?\"    \"I think, Sir John, that if, when we land, we climb straight up that  hill, in full sight of the shore, the pirates, when they see us, will  follow at once. The slaves should, therefore, be safe for a time if they  hide in that wood to the left of the spot we are making for. Will you  tell them to keep down by the water's edge among the bushes, and that  after crossing that crest, we will try to make a dash round, so as to  join them there. 'Tis probable that most of the pirates will start in  pursuit of us, and if we and the slaves make a rush for the shore we may  seize our boat, push off, and capture their craft, if there are but  a few left on board, knock out a plank and scuttle her, and then row  away.\"    \"By St. George, your plan is a good one, Tresham! A right good scheme,  and we will try it.\"    He at once translated what Gervaise had said to the rowers, by whom  it was received with short exclamations of"]]]
