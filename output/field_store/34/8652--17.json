Mine were far more beautiful and more durable than the Turkish,  and this for divers reasons. One was that I cut my grooves much deeper  and with wider trenches in the steel; for this is not usual in Turkish  work. Another was that the Turkish arabesques are only composed of arum  leaves a few small sunflowers; [1] and though these have a certain  grace, they do not yield so lasting a pleasure as the patterns which we  use. It is true that in Italy we have several different ways of  designing foliage; the Lombards, for example, construct very beautiful  patterns by copying the leaves of briony and ivy in exquisite curves,  which are extremely agreeable to the eye; the Tuscans and the Romans  make a better choice, because they imitate the leaves of the acanthus,  commonly called bears-foot, with its stalks and flowers, curling in  divers wavy lines; and into these arabesques one may excellently well  insert the figures of little birds and different animals, by which the  good taste of the artist is displayed. Some hints for creatures of this  sort can be observed in nature among the wild flowers, as, for instance,  in snap-dragons and some few other plants, which must be combined and  developed with the help of fanciful imaginings by clever draughtsmen.  Such arabesques are called grotesques by the ignorant. They have  obtained this name of grotesques among the moderns through being found  in certain subterranean caverns in Rome by students of antiquity; which  caverns were formerly chambers, hot-baths, cabinets for study, halls,  and apartments of like nature. The curious discovering them in such  places (since the level of the ground has gradually been raised while  they have remained below, and since in Rome these vaulted rooms are  commonly called grottoes), it has followed that the word grotesque is  applied to the patterns I have mentioned. But this is not the right term  for them, inasmuch as the ancients, who delighted in composing monsters  out of goats, cows, and horses, called these chimerical hybrids by the  name of monsters; and the modern artificers of whom I speak, fashioned  from the foliage which they copied monsters of like nature; for these  the proper name is therefore monsters, and not grotesques. Well, then, I  designed patterns of this kind, and filled them in with gold, as I have  mentioned; and they were far more pleasing to the eye than the Turkish.    It chanced at that time that I lighted upon some jars or little antique  urns filled with ashes, and among the ashes were some iron rings inlaid  with gold (for the ancients also used that art), and in each of the  rings was set a tiny cameo of shell. On applying to men of learning,  they told me that these rings were worn as amulets by folk desirous of  abiding with mind unshaken in any extraordinary circumstance, whether of  good or evil fortune. Hereupon, at the request of certain noblemen who  were my friends, I undertook to fabricate some trifling rings of this  kind; but I made them of refined steel; and after they had been well  engraved and inlaid with gold, they produced a very beautiful effect;  and sometimes a single ring brought me more than forty crowns, merely in  payment for my labour.    It was the custom at that epoch to wear little golden medals, upon which  every nobleman or man of quality had some device or fancy of his own  engraved; and these were worn in the cap. Of such pieces I made very  many, and found them extremely difficult to work. I have already  mentioned the admirable craftsman Caradosso, who used to make such  ornaments; and as there were more than one figure on each piece, he  asked at least a hundred gold crowns for his fee. This being so-not,  however, because his prices were so high, but because he worked so  slowly-I began to be employed by certain noblemen, for whom, among other  things, I made a medal in competition with that great artist, and it had  four figures, upon which I had expended an infinity of labour. These men  of quality, when they compared my piece with that of the famous  Caradosso, declared that mine was by far the better executed and more  beautiful, and bade me ask what I liked as the reward of my trouble; for  since I had given them such perfect satisfaction, they wished to do the  like by me. I replied that my greatest reward and what I most desired  was to have rivalled the masterpieces of so eminent an artist; and that  if their lordships thought I had, I acknowledged myself to be most amply  rewarded. With this I took my leave, and they immediately sent me such a  very liberal present, that I was well content; indeed there grew in me  so great a spirit to do well, that to this event I attributed what will  afterwards be related of my progress.    Note 1. 'Gichero,' arum maculatum, and 'clizia,' the sunflower.    XXXII    I SHALL be obliged to digress a little from the history of my art,  unless I were to omit some annoying incidents which have happened in the  course of my troubled career. One of these, which I am about to  describe, brought me into the greatest risk of my life. I have already  told the story of the artists club, and of the farcical adventures  which happened owing to the woman whom I mentioned, Pantasilea, the one  who felt for me that false and fulsome love. She was furiously enraged  because of the pleasant trick by which I brought Diego to our banquet,  and she swore to be revenged on me. How she did so is mixed up with the  history of a young man called Luigi Pulci, who had recently come to  Rome. He was the son of one of the Pulcis, who had been beheaded for  incest with his daughter; and the youth possessed extraordinary gifts  for poetry together with sound Latin scholarship; he wrote well, was  graceful in manners, and of surprising personal beauty; he had just left  the service of some bishop, whose name I do not remember, and was  thoroughly tainted with a very foul disease. While he was yet a lad and  living in Florence, they used in certain places of the city to meet  together during the nights of summer on the public streets; and he,  ranking among the best of the improvisatori, sang there. His recitations  were so admirable, that the divine Michel Agnolo Buonarroti, that prince  of sculptors and of painters, went, wherever he heard that he would be,  with the greatest eagerness and delight to listen to him. There was a  man called Piloto, a goldsmith, very able in his art, who, together with  myself, joined Buonarroti upon these occasions. [1] Thus acquaintance  sprang up between me and Luigi Pulci; and so, after the lapse of many  years, he came, in the miserable plight which I have mentioned, to make  himself known to me again in Rome, beseeching me for Gods sake to help  him. Moved to compassion by his great talents, by the love of my  fatherland, and by my own natural tenderness of heart, I took him into  my house, and had him medically treated in such wise that, being but a  youth, he soon regained his health. While he was still pursuing his  cure, he never omitted his studies, and I provided him with books  according to the means at my disposal. The result was that Luigi,  recognising the great benefits he had received from me, oftentimes with  words and tears returned me thanks, protesting that if God should ever  put good fortune in his way, he would recompense me for my kindness. To  this I replied that I had not done for him as much as I desired, but  only what I could, and that it was the duty of human beings to be  mutually serviceable. Only I suggested that he should repay the service  I had rendered him by doing likewise to some one who might have the same  need of him as he had had of me.    The young man in question began to frequent the Court of Rome, where he  soon found a situation, and enrolled himself in the suite of a bishop, a  man of eighty years, who bore the title of Gurgensis. [2] This bishop  had a nephew called Messer Giovanni: he was a nobleman of Venice; and  the said Messer Giovanni made show of marvellous attachment to Luigi  Pulcis talents; and under the pretence of these talents, he brought him  as familiar to himself as his own flesh blood. Luigi having talked of  me, and of his great obligations to me, with Messer Giovanni, the latter  expressed a wish to make my acquaintance. Thus then it came to pass,  that when I had upon a certain evening invited that woman Pantasilea to  supper, and had assembled a company of men of parts who were my friends,  just at the moment of our sitting down to table, Messer Giovanni and  Luigi Pulci arrived, and after some complimentary speeches, they both  remained to sup with us. The shameless strumpet, casting her eyes upon  the young mans beauty, began at once to lay her nets for him;  perceiving which, when the supper had come to an agreeable end, I took  Luigi aside, and conjured him, by the benefits he said he owed me, to  have nothing whatever to do with her. To this he answered: Good  heavens, Benvenuto! do you then take me for a madman? I rejoined: Not  for a madman, but for a young fellow; and I swore to him by God: I do  not give that woman the least thought; but for your sake I should be  sorry if through her you come to break your neck. Upon these words he  vowed and prayed to God, that, if ever he but spoke with her, he might  upon the moment break his neck. I think the poor lad swore this oath to  God with all his heart, for he did break his neck, as I shall presently  relate. Messer Giovanni showed signs too evident of loving him in a  dishonourable way; for we began to notice that Luigi had new suits of  silk and velvet every morning, and it was known that he abandoned  himself altogether to bad courses. He neglected his fine talents, and  pretended not to see or recognise me, because I had once rebuked"]]]
