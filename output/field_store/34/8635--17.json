Birds found on the Arctic slope of northern Alaska."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38478"],[0,"Narrative of the Circumnavigation of the Globe (#15)"],[1,"at the same time a lever by which to effect a moral reformation  in the disposition of criminals.\" He foresees the time \"when the colonists  of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land need no longer feel ashamed at  the historic recollection of their original convict associations, but  might rather, viewing the prosperity of their country, and the tone and  extent of their civilization, feel grateful to the criminals who landed in  1788 to become the pioneers of the country, and do them the justice of  believing that the good which they were compelled to do to the soil still  existed, while the evil they might have done was left undone of their own  accord, or was gradually assimilated under substantial progress.\"    The greatest obstacle to be encountered by the transportation system will  be found in the difficulty of hitting upon suitable localities. When we  consider the many conditions which must be satisfied, some referring to  the general objects aimed at in all punishment, some to considerations of  humanity and utility, when selecting a site for a penal colony, such as  climate, soil, distance, importance of the country as a market for the  products of the mother country, &c., it will be found that the number of  unclaimed or unbespoken territories, in which a scheme of compulsory  colonization could be carried out on a large scale, is exceedingly  limited.    For Germany, however, at least under her present political composition,  the foundation of penal colonies oversea seems all but entirely  impracticable. She must, in the first place, have her maritime power more  developed. On this subject the agreement is of importance which was  entered into in 1836 between Mr. James Colquhon, Consul-General for the  city of Hamburg, and the agents of the Australian Agricultural Society on  the other, as, although nothing resulted from it, it nevertheless  indicates how States that have no colonies can set about the system of  transportation. The gist of that scheme was the subscription of a sum for  the passage of such convicts as voluntarily accepted the offer, on their  engaging to remain for a certain period at compulsory labour in Australia  on the same terms as those of English convicts.[27]    Once the wish and the necessity shall arise in Germany, owing to the  expansion of her population, for possessions beyond sea, and her navy  shall increase on a scale adapted to their protection and defence, then,  although the choice of locality may be limited, the idea will no longer  remain impracticable. In the Indian Ocean as well as the Pacific there are  numbers of island groups, which, by their hypsometric conditions,  geographical position, and fertility of soil, are admirably suited for  settlement by white labour. The prejudice against the climatic  adaptability of the majority of these falls to the ground, when we  recollect what entirely altered conditions in that respect have been  brought about by the industry and energy of the colonists of Singapore and  Pulo-Penang, on islands which, from being in the worst possible repute  for their deadly climate and dreaded forest malaria, are now favourite  invalid resorts of the wealthy white residents of the islands of Eastern  Asia. But German statesmen must no longer hesitate, or continue to  sacrifice the future to the exigencies, even the most pressing in  political eyes, of the present, for England noiselessly but systematically  is possessing herself one after the other of all the islands that are as  yet untenanted by the white man, as, for instance, quite lately of the  Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal, or, as in the case of the Feejee  Islands,[28] accept a suspicious protectorate got up by an influential  missionary; while the Emperor of the French, with his irresistible  inclination for annexation, is incessantly occupied in seizing on points  important either by geographical position or for trade purposes, of which  New Caledonia furnishes the latest example. Too long delay and expectation  may have for the contemplative German results similar to those which in  Schiller's beautiful poem, punished the dallying of the son of the Muses,  whose fate, as compared with the actual political circumstances of  Germany, suggests but too many painful analogies!    On 6th December the frigate was made ready for prosecuting her voyage, and  the same evening all was ataunto. The following morning we were to be  towed out of the many-coved port, till quite clear of \"the Heads.\" The  steamer, however, sustained an accident to her machinery, and we had her  services little more than half a day. Early on the 7th, a breeze had  sprung up from S.W. by S., accompanied by squalls and rain, which  gradually freshened into squally weather from the S., and determined the  Commodore to make all sail at once. Already, even while we were still in  the port, the weather began to be stormy; we had to take in a reef in the  mainsail, and by 9 A.M. found ourselves outside of \"North Head.\" By the  afternoon the low flat coast of Australia had sunk below the horizon, and  the south wind had now become a gale. It seemed as though winds and waves  had conspired to put to the severest test the operations of the caulkers,  carpenters, and sail-makers of Sydney. But although the frigate rolled  tremendously, and the frequent squalls propelled the sea against her hull  with frightful violence, she did not ship a drop of water below. The  repairs in dock had been most effectually performed. After a couple of  days both wind and sea fell, the sun shone out with the mildness of early  spring, and we bowled along in the most delicious weather and with every  stitch of canvas set, swiftly careering towards our next goal, New  Zealand.    On the 9th at 5 P.M. we buried the corpse of one of the gunners, who had  died the same morning of dysentery, the remains being committed to the  deep with the customary ceremonies and marks of respect.    On the morning of the 19th we sighted Barrier Island off Cape Butt,  distant 35 miles. The more we neared the land, the more balmy did the  atmosphere become. Innumerable Albatrosses and _Procellariae_ swarmed  around us, and the result of half an hour's shooting from a small boat  dropped over the side for the purpose, resulted in our securing eleven  different species of storm-birds. A whale about 50 feet in length also  came close under our quarter, and only retreated after he had been  repeatedly fired upon and had received a number of balls in his carcase.    We steered for the South Point of Barrier Island, the outline of which is  very beautiful, relieved as it is by two hills, of which that to the south  is about 2000 feet in height, running up into a sharp peak, while the more  northerly rises gradually, being only precipitous on the northern face.  The broken conical rocks which ascend out of the sea near the northern  point of the island unmistakeably indicate their volcanic origin.    Our arrival off New Zealand was signalized by most unusual calms, which  indeed materially delayed our entrance into Huraka Gulf, a sort of lateral  bay, entering from the harbour of Auckland. A bark, which had sailed from  Sydney three days before us, had, as we were informed by our pilot, been  one day in harbour. We now had to tack slowly up under faint puffs of wind  towards the anchorage, which we reached finally at 5.30 P.M. of the 22nd  December, 1858.    The country round Auckland has none of those majestic features which are  presented by New Zealand further south. The enormous volcanic peaks, such  as Mount Egmont, 8000 feet high, have dwindled down in this region to  numerous but small extinct cones, rarely rising above 800 feet. Instead of  the hills covered with perpetual snow of the central island, one sees here  only low chains of hills, about 2000 feet high, and a rolling country,  which dips into the sea in steep cliffs of sandstone. In the various bays  and channels of the wide gulf might be seen numbers of natives in their  elegant canoes engaged in fishing. We found but five ships in harbour, and  here also the _Novara_ was the largest man-of-war that had ever entered  the port. The population of Auckland turned out on the beach as we  approached, and began to exchange the usual salutes with the little fort.                                     FOOTNOTES:    [1] A National System of Political Economy. Stuttgart, 1840. (J. C.  Cotta.)    [2] In an old map of the year 1542, the Australian continent is named New  Java.    [3] The mean of thermometrical readings on the north coast is 80 deg.6  Fahr.;--at Port McQuarrie, in S.E. Australia (31 deg. S.), 68 deg. Fahr.; at Port  Jackson (34 deg. S.) 66 deg.5 Fahr.; at Port Philip on the south coast (33 deg. S.),  61 deg.3 Fahr.; at Perth on the west coast (32 deg. S.) 62 deg.6 to 64 deg.4 Fahr. The  annual rain-fall in New South Wales is 45 inches.    [4] The total superficial area of the somewhat oval-shaped continent lying  between 10 deg. and 45 deg. S. and 112 deg. and 154 deg. E., is about 2,100,000  geographical square miles in extent, the coast outline of which is about  7000 miles, so that for each mile of coast there are about 300 square  miles of surface, or rather more than double the proportion in Europe. The  united English population of the different colonies founded in Australia  (exclusive of Tasmania or Van Diemen's Land) and New Zealand amounts to  about 1,400,000 souls. Within twenty years the population has increased  six-fold, and the value of the exports twenty-fold.
