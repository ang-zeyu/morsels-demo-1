My mouth was more closed up than  ever before. I felt that the house was filled with devils and with an  awful darkness. I felt horrible. I did not understand why the Lord  should send me into the midst of such spirits to bear testimony of his  work. I felt very strange. My tongue seemed glued to my mouth. I could  not {53} speak. I arose to my feet to leave the house. I felt as though  the floor moved under my feet and when I stepped upon the ground I felt  as though I was surrounded by evil spirits. I had a desire to flee  as Lot did when he went out of Sodom, without looking behind me. Mr.  Akeman followed me out of the door and kept within about four rods of  me. Neither of us spoke a word. I knew he was following, but when he  was about four rods from the house, the strange feeling left me. When  Mr. Akeman reached the place where my feelings so instantly changed, he  fell dead at my feet as though he had been struck with a thunderbolt  from heaven. I heard him fall to the earth, but I did not look behind  me. His daughter stood in the doorway and saw him fall. She fainted and  fell at about the same time. Neither of them spoke a word that I could  hear. I continued to walk down to Mr. Hubbel's as fast as I could,  meditating all the while upon the strange dealings of God with me. I  still did not know that Mr. Akeman was dead. I arrived at Mr. Hubbel's  just at dark in a peculiar state of mind. Supper was ready. We all sat  down to the table. The blessing was asked, and I took up my knife and  fork and began to eat, when I heard a horse coming up on the full ran.  I dropped my knife and fork and listened. A man rode up to our door and  cried out: 'Mr. Akeman is dead. I want you to go there immediately.' In  a moment my eyes were opened, so that I understood the whole matter.  I felt satisfied with the dealings of God with me in calling me to go  and warn him. As soon as his daughter, who fell to the ground about the  same time, came to her senses, she ran to her nearest brother and gave  the alarm.    \"We walked up to Mr. Akeman's house as soon as we could. When we  arrived there, we found all his sons in the house around his body  wailing in an awful manner. He was naturally a large man, but his body  was swollen to a great extent. It appeared as though his skin were  ready to burst open. He was black as an African. We at once went to  work and made a large box in which to put him. I continued to think of  my dream, which I had had some time before the events here related took  place.    \"His family, as well as ourselves, felt it was the judgment of God upon  him. I preached his funeral sermon. Many of the {54} mob died suddenly.  We stayed about two weeks after Akeman's death and preached, baptized  Mr. Hubbel and his wife, and then continued on our journey.    \"We concluded to go down the Arkansas River and cross into Tennessee.  We could not get passage on the boat, because of the low water; so we  went on the bank of the river and cut down a sound cottonwood tree,  three feet through, and cut off a twelve foot length from the butt  end; in two days we dug out a canoe. We made a pair of oars and a  rudder, and on the 11th day of March, 1835, we launched our canoe, and  commenced our voyage down the Arkansas River, without provisions.    \"The first day we sailed twenty-five miles, and stopped at night with a  poor family who lived on the bank of the river. These kind folks gave  us supper and breakfast, and, in the morning, gave us johnny-cake and a  piece of pork to take with us on our journey. We traveled about fifty  miles that day, and at night stopped at an old tavern, in a village  called Cadron, which was deserted because it was believed to be haunted  by evil spirits. We made a fire in the tavern, roasted a piece of our  pork, ate our supper, said our prayers, went into a chamber, lay down  on the bare floor, and were soon asleep. I dreamed I was at my father's  house in a good feather bed, and I had a good night's rest. When I  awoke the bed vanished, and I found myself on the bare floor and well  rested, not having been troubled with evil spirits or anything else.    \"We thanked the Lord for His goodness to us, ate the remainder of our  provisions, and continued our journey down the river to Little Rock,  the capital of Arkansas, which then consisted of only a few cabins.  After visiting the place, we crossed the river and tied up our canoe,  which had carried us safely one hundred and fifty miles. We then took  the old military road leading from Little Rock to Memphis, Tennessee.  This road lay through swamps, and was covered with mud and water most  of the way for one hundred and seventy miles. We walked forty miles in  a day, through mud and water knee-deep.    \"On the 24th of March, after traveling some ten miles through mud, I  was made lame with a sharp pain in my knee, and sat down on a log. My  companion, who was anxious to get to his home in Kirtland, left me  sitting in an alligator swamp. {55} I did not see him again for two  years. I knelt down in the mud and prayed, and the Lord healed me and I  went on my way rejoicing.    \"On the 27th of March I arrived at Memphis, weary and hungry. I went  to the best tavern in the place, kept by Mr. Josiah Jackson. I told  him I was a stranger and had no money, and asked him if he would keep  me over night. He inquired what my business was, and I told him I was  a preacher of the gospel. He laughed and said that I did not look much  like a preacher. I did not blame him, as most of the preachers he ever  had been acquainted with rode on fine horses or in fine carriages,  dressed in broadcloth, had large salaries, and would likely see this  whole world sink to perdition before they would wade through one  hundred and seventy miles of mud to save the people.    \"The landlord wanted a little fun, so said he would keep me if I would  preach. He wanted to see if I could preach. I must confess that by  this time I became a little mischievous, and pleaded with him not to  set me preaching. The more I pleaded to be excused the more determined  Mr. Jackson was that I should preach. He took my valise, and the  landlady got me a good supper. I sat down in a large hall to eat.  Before I got through, the room began to be filled by some of the rich  and fashionable people of Memphis, dressed in their broadcloth and  silk, while my appearance was such as you can imagine, after traveling  through the mud as I had done. When I had finished eating, the table  was carried out of the room over the heads of the people. I was placed  in the corner of the room, with a stand having a Bible, hymn book, and  candle on it, hemmed in by a dozen men, with the landlord in the center.    \"There were present some five hundreds persons, who had come together,  not to hear a gospel sermon, but to have some fun. I read a hymn, and  asked them to sing. Not a soul would sing a word. I told them I had  not the gift of singing; but with the help of the Lord, I would both  pray and preach. I knelt down to pray, and the men around me dropped  on their knees. I prayed to the Lord to give me His spirit and to show  me the hearts of the people. I promised the Lord, in my prayer, that  I would deliver to that congregation whatever He would give to me. I  arose and spoke one hour and a half, and it was one of {56} the best  sermons of my life. The lives of the congregation were open to the  vision of my mind, and I told them of their wicked deeds and the reward  they would obtain. The men who surrounded me dropped their heads. Three  minutes after I closed, I was the only person in the room.    \"Soon I was shown to a bed, in a room adjoining a large one in which  were assembled many of the men whom I had been preaching to. I could  hear their conversation. One man said he would like to know how that  Mormon boy knew of their past lives. In a little while they got to  disputing about some doctrinal point. One suggested calling me to  decide the point. The landlord said, 'No; we have had enough for once.'  In the morning, I had a good breakfast. The landlord said if I came  that way again to stop at his house, and stay as long as I might choose.    \"After leaving Memphis, I traveled through the country to Benton  County, and preached on the way, as I had opportunity. I stopped one  night with a Squire Hardman, an Episcopalian. Most of the night was  spent by the family in music and dancing. In the morning, at the  breakfast table, Mr. Hardman asked me if we believed in music and  dancing. I told him we did not really consider them essential to  salvation. He said he did, and therefore should not join our Church.    \"On the 4th of April, 1835, I had the happy privilege of meeting Elder  Warren Parrish at the house of Brother Frye. He had been preaching  in that part of Tennessee, in company with David W. Patten, and had  baptized a number of persons and organized several small branches.  Brother Patten had returned home, and Brother Parrish was laboring  alone. I joined him in the ministry, and we labored together three  months and nineteen days, when he was called to Kirtland. During  the time we were together, we traveled through several counties in  Tennessee for the distance of seven hundred and sixty miles, and  preached the gospel daily, as we had opportunity. We baptized some  twenty persons.    \"By the counsel of the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, Elder  Parrish ordained me an elder, and left me to take charge of the  branches that had been raised up in that neighborhood. As soon as I was  left alone I extended my circuit {57} and labors. For a season I had  large congregations; many seemed to believe, and I baptized a number.    \"On the 15th of August I had an appointment at the house of Brother  Taylor, the step-father of Abraham O. Smoot. I had to cross Bloody  River, which I had to swim, in consequence of heavy rains. While"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47707"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 3 (#15)"],[1,"by a vaulting ambition which  overleaped itself, the Hebrew scriptures give us little information  concerning Lucifer. No cause for the rebellion is assigned, though  evidence {LVIII} of the fact and reality of the rebellion is abundant.  [50] In some ancient scripture revealed to Joseph Smith, however, the  cause of that Lucifer-led rebellion is stated. It was immediately  connected with man's earth-life, and the means and conditions of his  salvation.    In order that the reader may appreciate the force of the truth to  be presented, it is necessary to remind him that the spirit of man  had an existence before he dwelt in his body of flesh and bones--a  self-conscious existence, in which he possessed all the faculties and  attributes that the spirit or mind of man now possesses; that the  time had come when the present earth-life became necessary to his  continued progress; that all that would take place in that earth-life  was known to God--the fall of man, the wickedness of the human race,  the redemption through the atonement of a sinless sacrifice--all was  known, and for all these events ample provisions were to be made; one  chosen to open the series of dispensations that should make up the  history of man's earth-life; one chosen to redeem man from his fallen  state. It was at this point that Lucifer came before the grand council  in heaven saying: Behold--here am I, send me, I will be Thy son, and I  will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely  _I will do it_; wherefore give me Thine honor. \"But, behold,\" said  the Lord, \"My Beloved Son, which was My Beloved and Chosen from the  beginning, said unto Me--Father, Thy will be done, and the glory be  Thine forever. Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against Me, and  sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given  him; and also that I should give unto him Mine own power; by the power  of Mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down; and he  became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive  and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as  would not hearken unto My voice.\" [51]    This discloses the reason of Lucifer's rebellion--opposition to the  plan of man's redemption--a counter plan that involved the destruction  of the agency of man. Then what?    \"I beheld Satan,\" says Jesus, \"as lightning fall from heaven.\" [52]    \"And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own  habitation. He hath reserved in everlasting chains, under darkness,  unto the judgment of the great day.\" [53]    \"And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought {LIX}  against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed  not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great  dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and Satan,  which deceiveth the whole world; he was cast out into the earth, and  his angels were cast out with him. And I heard a loud voice saying  in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of  our God, and the power of His Christ: for the accuser of our brethren  is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. And  they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their  testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. Therefore  rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters  of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you,  having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.\"  [54]    Lucifer, then, becomes a factor to be reckoned with in the persecution  of the Saints. In heaven he opposed the gospel of Jesus Christ; cast  out into the earth will he not oppose it there? Herein lies the real  cause of the persecution of the Christians within the Roman empire.  So long as the inhabitants of the earth were content with the pagan  superstitions, wherein there was no power of God unto salvation; so  long as they were content with conflicting pagan philosophies, wherein  was no power of God unto salvation, it was a matter of indifference  to Lucifer whether they worshiped Jupiter Olympus, or Isis; Apollo,  or Minerva; or bowed at the philosopher's shrine of the Unknown  God--all were equally barren of saving power and left the kingdom of  Lucifer undiminished in its strength and numbers; left all nations  in his thraldom. But when the Christ and His apostles came preaching  repentance and the coming of the kingdom of heaven; making known the  origin of man and his relationship to Deity; making known the purpose  of God to redeem him from his fallen state; establishing His Church as  the depository of divine truth, and the instrumentality for conveying  to man divine instruction--then Lucifer saw cause for alarm, for it  was evident that the days of his dominion were numbered; his kingdom  must decline if Christianity prevailed; his sway over the kingdoms of  the earth must be broken if Christ was preached: and hence in all the  bitterness of hatred, with all the strength of his cunning, with all  the power of his resourcefulness, and using every instrumentality he  could command--corrupted human nature over which he had influence; the  apprehension of magistrates; the jealousy of pagan priesthoods--all  were employed to destroy that institution wrought out in the wisdom  of God to bring to pass the salvation of man; and hence the fire, the  {LX} sword and the rack; the lions, the dungeons,--in a word, the pagan  persecutions of the Saints of God; Lucifer and his hatred of the truth  the primary cause of all, all other causes and pretexts but secondary,  mere instrumentalities used by him to impede the progress of and  destroy, if possible, the truth, the gospel, wherein lies the power of  man's salvation.    It is said that history repeats itself; and this in matters of religion  as in other things. In the introduction to the first volume of the  Church History, the paganization of Christianity was discussed at  some length, and when the Lord would again prepare the way for the  incoming of the last dispensation of the Gospel--the dispensation of  the fullness of times--as part of that preparation, He established a  great republic in the New World, the chief corner stone of whose temple  of liberty was religious freedom. The Congress of the United States,  by express provision of the Constitution, is prohibited from making  any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the  free exercise thereof. [55] Similar guarantees of religious freedom  are provided for in the constitutions of all the states. The clause in  Missouri's constitution on the subject was as follows:    \"All men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty  God according to the dictates of their own consciences; that no man  can be compelled to erect, support or attend any place of worship,  or to maintain any minister of the gospel or teacher of religion;  that no human authority can control or interfere with the rights of  conscience; that no person can ever be hurt, molested or restrained in  his religious professions or sentiments, if he do not disturb others in  their religious worship: that no person, on account of his religious  opinions, can be rendered ineligible to any office of trust or profit  under this state; that no preference can ever be given by law to any  sect or mode of worship; and that no religious corporation can ever be  established in this state.\"    Under these guarantees of religious liberty, in both state and national  constitutions, infidels, Jews, and all sects of the Christian religion  lived in unbroken peace. In the colonial history of the country there  had been some intolerance and acts of violence practiced by the sects  of Christians on one another, but in the main, and especially since  the establishment of the republic of the United States, under its  present Constitution, there had been absolute religious freedom. But  now a strange thing occurred. A youth, yet in his early teens, startled  the neighborhood in which he resided with the announcement that he  had received a revelation from God: a new dispensation of the Gospel  of Christ had been committed to him; he is authorized to found again  the very {LXI} Church of Christ; men are to teach once more by divine  authority; and the world is to be made ready for the incoming of the  glorious kingdom, whose king shall be the resurrected, glorified  Christ; and peace and truth and righteousness are to abound. Strangely  enough, notwithstanding all the guarantees of religious freedom in the  state and national constitutions, this proclamation is resented by the  people, and those who advocate it are persecuted in various ways, until  at the last, as set forth in the three volumes of the Church History  now published, it culminated in the death and misery of many souls, and  the final expulsion of from twelve to fifteen thousand Saints from the  state of Missouri, under all the circumstances of cruelty detailed in  this history.    Why is this violence done to the principle of religious freedom, a  principle that is both the pride and boast of the American people?  Why are constitutions and institutions violated in efforts made  by the authorities of the sovereign state of Missouri to destroy  this religion and this Church of Christ? What is the cause of these  Missouri persecutions? In view of the principles already set forth  in these pages, the primary cause of these persecutions in Missouri  will not be difficult to find. In them, as in the Roman persecutions  of the Christians, the cunning and power of Lucifer will be apparent.  So long as only apostate forms of Christianity obtained; so long as  men adhered to mere forms of godliness and denied the power thereof,  so long Lucifer cared not with what devotion they clung to these  lifeless forms of religion.
