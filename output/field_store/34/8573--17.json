[M] (yy) denotes young-of-year only.    Some measure was gained of the amount of movement exhibited by several  species of fish. Results are biased in favor of a conclusion that a  species is sedentary because a large percentage of the recaptures were  made in collections taken in the same immediate area three hours after  release of marked fish, the total area checked was not large (one mile),  and collecting was limited to an eleven-day period. Nevertheless, some  species were shown to be definitely mobile and others exhibited  pronounced sedentary tendencies. The results of experiments on movement  are presented in Table 16. Marked fish (dyed and fin-clipped) were taken  as long as seven days after being marked. Only those species in which  more than ten individuals were marked are included.    Blunt-nosed minnow, red shiner, and channel catfish (yearlings and  older) are more mobile than other species.    The mobility of channel catfish has been discussed by Muncy (1958) and  Funk (1957). My records show that of 36 marked channel catfish that were  recaptured, 11 were taken in areas other than the one into which they  had been returned. A pronounced mobile tendency on the part of the red  shiner and blunt-nosed minnow is shown by the fact that of 152 marked  red shiners recaptured, 73 had moved from the area of release; and of 32  marked blunt-nosed minnows recaptured, 11 had moved from the area of  release. The fact that the habitat occupied by these species is not  precise (ranging from swift riffles to quiet pools) supports a  conclusion that the species are mobile.    The fat-headed minnow, stoneroller, channel catfish (young-of-the-year),  green sunfish and long-eared sunfish form a sedentary element of the  population. With the exception of the fat-headed minnow, the sedentary  group also maintained relatively stable numbers in Areas 1, 3 and 6  throughout the study (Table 14). It is interesting to note that, in  contrast to the mobile group, the species forming the sedentary group  have rather well-defined habitat preferences.    A third group of species, represented by the red-finned shiner,  stonecat, slender-headed darter and orange-throated darter, was  characterized by having a low rate of recapture. I suspect that  mortality is a factor contributing to the failure to recapture  red-finned shiners, because in one collection only four of 31 red-finned  shiners captured were successfully marked and released, in another case  70 of 818. The red-finned shiner occurs most often in pools but is also  taken in other areas, is pelagic, and probably is a mobile species.    The stonecat, slender-headed darter and orange-throated darter are  generally restricted to riffle-habitats, and are probably sedentary. The  low number of recaptures for these three species probably is due either  to a slow rate of dispersal from the point of release or to latent  mortality resulting from shock. Table 14 shows that these three species  maintain comparatively stable populations, but there seems to be a  tendency for a reduction in numbers with continued collecting, even  though all fish captured were returned to the stream.    Golden redhorse showed a high rate of recapture. All individuals marked  were recaptured three hours after release in Areas 1 (two fish) and 3  (five fish). Nine individuals were taken from Area 4 on 11 September;  seven of these were marked and released in the next pool downstream  (Area 3). On 15 September, two fish were retaken in Area 3 and two were  retaken in Area 2, the next pool downstream. The species was common in  Area 5 also where five of eight marked individuals were recaptured two  days after release. It seems that the golden redhorse is somewhat  restricted in movement, at least for short periods.    The sucker-mouthed minnow and black bullhead showed some movement--less  than such mobile species as red shiners and channel catfish, but more  than the sedentary group. Seven of 27 marked sucker-mouthed minnows were  taken in areas adjacent to the one to which they had been returned. Two  of six black bullheads that were recaptured had moved. The black  bullhead moved the greater distance. The extent of short-term movement  by several of the species in the Upper Neosho correlates well with  redistribution subsequent to drought in the Wakarusa River, discussed by  Deacon and Metcalf (1961).      Similarity of the Fauna at the Upper Neosho Station to the Faunas of  Nearby Streams    The fauna that I found to be characteristic at the upper Neosho station  has affinity with the upland tributary-fauna described by Metcalf (1959)  for Chautauqua, Cowley and Elk Counties, Kansas. The primary difference  is a nearly complete absence at my station of the Ozarkian element of  the population. Some species (red-finned shiner, long-eared sunfish, and  spotted bass) listed by Metcalf as characteristic of the mainstream of  smaller rivers occur at the upper Neosho station in greater abundance  then elsewhere in the Neosho. This difference is probably due to the  fact that the upper Neosho station is somewhat larger and slightly more  turbid than Metcalf's \"upland tributaries.\"    Hall (1952) reported on the distribution of fishes in the vicinity of  Fort Gibson Reservoir, an impoundment on the Grand (Neosho) River in  Oklahoma. He separated the fishes into three groups according to  habitat-preference: species restricted to upland tributaries on the east  side of Grand (Neosho) River, species restricted to lowland tributaries  on the west side of Grand (Neosho) River, and species occurring in the  Grand River proper and/or tributaries on one or both sides.    Several species found in the upper Neosho River also occur in the area  studied by Hall. Of these, only the creek chub was restricted to upland  tributaries on the east side of Grand (Neosho) River. The sucker-mouthed  minnow and red-finned shiner were restricted to the lowland tributaries  on the west side of Grand (Neosho) River in the Fort Gibson Reservoir  Area. Golden redhorse, stoneroller, yellow bullhead, spotted bass, green  sunfish, long-eared sunfish, and orange-throated darter were present in  collections from the Grand River proper and/or tributaries on both sides  of the river, most commonly in tributaries.    Hall's data show that black bullhead, large-mouthed bass, white crappie,  and logperch occurred most frequently in or near the quiet water of the  reservoir. In my study these fish were most common in the larger, quiet  pools at the upper Neosho station.          COMPARISON OF THE FISH FAUNAS OF THE NEOSHO AND MARAIS DES CYGNES RIVERS      The Marais des Cygnes River has less gradient (especially in the  upstream portions), fewer and shorter riffles, and more mud bottom than  does the Neosho River. Stream-flow during drought was reduced to a  proportionately greater degree in the Neosho River than it was in the  Marais des Cygnes River. Average flow of the Neosho River near Parsons  (drainage area: 4905 square miles), Kansas, was less than average flow  of the Marais des Cygnes River at Trading Post (drainage area: 2880  square miles), Kansas, in 1953, 1955 and 1956. In normal times the  Neosho River carries a larger volume of water than the Marais des  Cygnes. The Neosho River has a greater variety of habitat-conditions and  a more diversified fish-fauna than the Marais des Cygnes.    The following species were taken in the Neosho River but not in the  Marais des Cygnes River: blue sucker, high-finned carpsucker, golden  redhorse, gravel chub, mimic shiner, mountain minnow, parrot minnow,  Neosho madtom (the only endemic in either river), mosquitofish, spotted  bass, smallmouth, black crappie, logperch and fan-tailed darter. Most of  the above species are usually found in association with gravel-bottom,  which is prevalent in Neosho River. The blue sucker, high-finned  carpsucker, gravel chub, mountain minnow, and parrot minnow normally  occur in the larger streams in Kansas. The last three species became  more abundant in the Neosho River following"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/348"],[0,"Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns, and Homerica (#15)"],[1," the house of  Amphitryon, together with warlike Iolaus, destroyed with the unpitying  sword through the plans of Athene the spoil-driver. She was the mother  of Chimaera who breathed raging fire, a creature fearful, great,  swift-footed and strong, who had three heads, one of a grim-eyed lion;  in her hinderpart, a dragon; and in her middle, a goat, breathing forth  a fearful blast of blazing fire. Her did Pegasus and noble Bellerophon  slay; but Echidna was subject in love to Orthus and brought forth the  deadly Sphinx which destroyed the Cadmeans, and the Nemean lion, which  Hera, the good wife of Zeus, brought up and made to haunt the hills  of Nemea, a plague to men. There he preyed upon the tribes of her own  people and had power over Tretus of Nemea and Apesas: yet the strength  of stout Heracles overcame him.    (ll. 333-336) And Ceto was joined in love to Phorcys and bare her  youngest, the awful snake who guards the apples all of gold in the  secret places of the dark earth at its great bounds. This is the  offspring of Ceto and Phorcys.    (ll. 334-345) And Tethys bare to Ocean eddying rivers, Nilus, and  Alpheus, and deep-swirling Eridanus, Strymon, and Meander, and the  fair stream of Ister, and Phasis, and Rhesus, and the silver eddies of  Achelous, Nessus, and Rhodius, Haliacmon, and Heptaporus, Granicus,  and Aesepus, and holy Simois, and Peneus, and Hermus, and Caicus fair  stream, and great Sangarius, Ladon, Parthenius, Euenus, Ardescus, and  divine Scamander.    (ll. 346-370) Also she brought forth a holy company of daughters [1615]  who with the lord Apollo and the Rivers have youths in their keeping--to  this charge Zeus appointed them--Peitho, and Admete, and Ianthe, and  Electra, and Doris, and Prymno, and Urania divine in form, Hippo,  Clymene, Rhodea, and Callirrhoe, Zeuxo and Clytie, and Idyia, and  Pasithoe, Plexaura, and Galaxaura, and lovely Dione, Melobosis and Thoe  and handsome Polydora, Cerceis lovely of form, and soft eyed Pluto,  Perseis, Ianeira, Acaste, Xanthe, Petraea the fair, Menestho, and  Europa, Metis, and Eurynome, and Telesto saffron-clad, Chryseis and Asia  and charming Calypso, Eudora, and Tyche, Amphirho, and Ocyrrhoe, and  Styx who is the chiefest of them all. These are the eldest daughters  that sprang from Ocean and Tethys; but there are many besides. For there  are three thousand neat-ankled daughters of Ocean who are dispersed far  and wide, and in every place alike serve the earth and the deep waters,  children who are glorious among goddesses. And as many other rivers are  there, babbling as they flow, sons of Ocean, whom queenly Tethys bare,  but their names it is hard for a mortal man to tell, but people know  those by which they severally dwell.    (ll. 371-374) And Theia was subject in love to Hyperion and bare great  Helius (Sun) and clear Selene (Moon) and Eos (Dawn) who shines upon  all that are on earth and upon the deathless Gods who live in the wide  heaven.    (ll. 375-377) And Eurybia, bright goddess, was joined in love to Crius  and bare great Astraeus, and Pallas, and Perses who also was eminent  among all men in wisdom.    (ll. 378-382) And Eos bare to Astraeus the strong-hearted winds,  brightening Zephyrus, and Boreas, headlong in his course, and Notus,--a  goddess mating in love with a god. And after these Erigenia [1616] bare  the star Eosphorus (Dawn-bringer), and the gleaming stars with which  heaven is crowned.    (ll. 383-403) And Styx the daughter of Ocean was joined to Pallas and  bare Zelus (Emulation) and trim-ankled Nike (Victory) in the house. Also  she brought forth Cratos (Strength) and Bia (Force), wonderful children.  These have no house apart from Zeus, nor any dwelling nor path except  that wherein God leads them, but they dwell always with Zeus the  loud-thunderer. For so did Styx the deathless daughter of Ocean plan on  that day when the Olympian Lightener called all the deathless gods to  great Olympus, and said that whosoever of the gods would fight with him  against the Titans, he would not cast him out from his rights, but each  should have the office which he had before amongst the deathless gods.  And he declared that he who was without office and rights under Cronos,  should be raised to both office and rights as is just. So  deathless Styx came first to Olympus with her children through the  wit of her dear father. And Zeus honoured her, and gave her very great  gifts, for her he appointed to be the great oath of the gods, and her  children to live with him always. And as he promised, so he performed  fully unto them all. But he himself mightily reigns and rules.    (ll. 404-452) Again, Phoebe came to the desired embrace of Coeus.    Then the goddess through the love of the god conceived and brought forth  dark-gowned Leto, always mild, kind to men and to the deathless gods,  mild from the beginning, gentlest in all Olympus. Also she bare Asteria  of happy name, whom Perses once led to his great house to be called his  dear wife. And she conceived and bare Hecate whom Zeus the son of Cronos  honoured above all. He gave her splendid gifts, to have a share of the  earth and the unfruitful sea. She received honour also in starry heaven,  and is honoured exceedingly by the deathless gods. For to this day,  whenever any one of men on earth offers rich sacrifices and prays for  favour according to custom, he calls upon Hecate. Great honour comes  full easily to him whose prayers the goddess receives favourably, and  she bestows wealth upon him; for the power surely is with her. For as  many as were born of Earth and Ocean amongst all these she has her due  portion. The son of Cronos did her no wrong nor took anything away of  all that was her portion among the former Titan gods: but she holds,  as the division was at the first from the beginning, privilege both in  earth, and in heaven, and in sea. Also, because she is an only child,  the goddess receives not less honour, but much more still, for Zeus  honours her. Whom she will she greatly aids and advances: she sits by  worshipful kings in judgement, and in the assembly whom she will is  distinguished among the people. And when men arm themselves for the  battle that destroys men, then the goddess is at hand to give victory  and grant glory readily to whom she will. Good is she also when men  contend at the games, for there too the goddess is with them and profits  them: and he who by might and strength gets the victory wins the rich  prize easily with joy, and brings glory to his parents. And she is good  to stand by horsemen, whom she will: and to those whose business is  in the grey discomfortable sea, and who pray to Hecate and the  loud-crashing Earth-Shaker, easily the glorious goddess gives great  catch, and easily she takes it away as soon as seen, if so she will.  She is good in the byre with Hermes to increase the stock. The droves  of kine and wide herds of goats and flocks of fleecy sheep, if she will,  she increases from a few, or makes many to be less. So, then. albeit her  mother's only child [1617], she is honoured amongst all the deathless  gods. And the son of Cronos made her a nurse of the young who after  that day saw with their eyes the light of all-seeing Dawn. So from the  beginning she is a nurse of the young, and these are her honours.    (ll. 453-491) But Rhea was subject in love to Cronos and bare splendid  children, Hestia [1618], Demeter, and gold-shod Hera and strong Hades,  pitiless in heart, who dwells under the earth, and the loud-crashing  Earth-Shaker, and wise Zeus, father of gods and men, by whose thunder  the wide earth is shaken. These great Cronos swallowed as each came  forth from the womb to his mother's knees with this intent, that no  other of the proud sons of Heaven should hold the kingly office amongst  the deathless gods. For he learned from Earth and starry Heaven that  he was destined to be overcome by his own son, strong though he was,  through the contriving of great Zeus [1619]. Therefore he kept no blind  outlook, but watched and swallowed down his children: and unceasing  grief seized Rhea. But when she was about to bear Zeus, the father of  gods and men, then she besought her own dear parents, Earth and starry  Heaven, to devise some plan with her that the birth of her dear child  might be concealed, and that retribution might overtake great, crafty  Cronos for his own father and also for the children whom he had  swallowed down. And they readily heard and obeyed their dear daughter,  and told her all that was destined to happen touching Cronos the king  and his stout-hearted son. So they sent her to Lyetus, to the rich land  of Crete, when she was ready to bear great Zeus, the youngest of her  children. Him did vast Earth receive from Rhea in wide Crete to nourish  and to bring up. Thither came Earth carrying him swiftly through the  black night to Lyctus first, and took him in her arms and hid him in a  remote cave beneath the secret places of the holy earth on thick-wooded  Mount Aegeum; but to the mightily ruling son of Heaven, the earlier king  of the gods, she gave a great stone wrapped in swaddling clothes. Then  he took it in his hands and thrust it down into his belly: wretch!  he knew not in his heart that in place of the stone his son was left  behind, unconquered and untroubled, and that he was soon to overcome him  by force and might and drive him from his honours, himself to reign over  the deathless gods.    (ll. 492-506) After that, the strength and glorious limbs of the prince  increased quickly, and as the years rolled on, great Cronos the wily  was beguiled by the deep suggestions of Earth, and brought up again  his offspring, vanquished by the arts and might of his own son, and he  vomited up first the stone which he had swallowed last. And Zeus set  it fast in the wide-pathed earth at goodly Pytho under the glens of  Parnassus, to be a sign thenceforth and a marvel to mortal men [1620]."]]]
