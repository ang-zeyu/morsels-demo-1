Put the potatoes in the boiling water,  cover closely, and keep the water at high boiling pitch until you can  thrust a sharp sliver through the largest potato. Then drain off the  water, and set the kettle in a hot place with the lid partly off. Take  them out only as they are wanted; luke-warm potatoes are not good. They  will be found about as good as potatoes can be, when cooked in their  jackets. But there is a better way, as thus: Select enough for a mess,  of smooth, sound tubers; pare them carefully, taking off as little as  possible, because the best of the potato lies nearest the skin, and cook  as above. When done, pour the water off to the last drop; sprinkle a  spoonful of salt and fine cracker crumbs over them; then shake, roll,  and rattle them in the kettle until the outsides are white and floury.  Keep them piping hot until wanted. It is the way to have perfect boiled  potatoes.    Many outers are fond of roast potatoes in camp; and they mostly spoil  them in the roasting, although there is no better place than the  camp-fire in which to do it. To cook them aright, scoop out a basinlike  depression under the fore-stick, three or four inches deep, and large  enough to hold the tubers when laid side by side; fill it with bright,  hard-wood coals, and keep up a strong heat for half an hour or more.  Next, clean out the hollow, place the potatoes in it, and cover them  with hot sand or ashes, topped with a heap of glowing coals, and keep up  all the heat you like. In about forty minutes commence to try them with  a sharpened hard-wood sliver; when this will pass through them they are  done, and should be raked out at once. Run the sliver through them from  end to end, to let the steam escape, and use immediately, as a roast  potato quickly becomes soggy and bitter. I will add that, in selecting a  supply of potatoes for camp, only the finest and smoothest should be  taken.    A man may be a trout-crank, he may have been looking forward for ten  weary months to the time when he is to strike the much dreamed of  mountain stream, where trout may be taken and eaten without stint.  Occasionally--not often--his dream is realized. For two or three days he  revels in fly-fishing, and eating brook trout. Then his enthusiasm  begins to subside. He talks less of his favorite flies, and hints that  wading hour after hour in ice-water gives him cramps in the calves of  his legs. Also, he finds that brook trout, eaten for days in succession,  pall on the appetite. He hankers for the flesh-pots of the restaurant,  and his soul yearns for the bean-pot of home.    Luckily, some one has brought a sack of white beans, and the  expert--there is always an expert in camp--is deputed to cook them. He  accepts the trust, and proceeds to do it. He puts a quart of dry beans  and a liberal chunk of pork in a two-quart kettle, covers the mess with  water, and brings it to a rapid boil. Presently the beans begin to swell  and lift the lid of the kettle; their conduct is simply demoniacal. They  lift up the lid of the kettle, they tumble out over the rim in a way to  provoke a saint, and they have scarcely begun to cook. The expert is not  to be beaten. As they rise, he spoons them out and throws them away,  until half of the best beans being wasted, the rest settle to business.  He fills the kettle with water and watches it for an hour. When  bean-skins and scum arise he uses the spoon; and when a ring of greasy  salt forms around the rim of the kettle, he carefully scrapes it off,  but most of it drops back into the pot. When the beans seem cooked to  the point of disintegration, he lifts off the kettle, and announces  dinner. It is not a success. The largest beans are granulated rather  than cooked, while the mealy portion of them has fallen to the bottom of  the kettle, and become scorched thereon, and the smaller beans are too  hard to be eatable. The liquid, that should be palatable bean soup, is  greasy salt water, and the pork is half raw. The party falls back,  hungry and disgusted. Even if the mess were well cooked, it is too salt  for eating. And why should this be so? Why should any sensible man spend  years in acquiring an education that shall fit him for the struggle of  life, yet refuse to spend a single day in learning how to cook the food  that must sustain the life? It is one of the conundrums no one will ever  find out.    [Sidenote: _Beans_]    There is no article of food more easily carried, and none that contains  more nourishment to the pound, than the bean. Limas are usually  preferred, but the large white marrow is just as good. It will pay to  select them carefully. Keep an eye on grocery stocks, and when you  strike a lot of extra large, clean beans, buy twice as many as you need  for camp use. Spread them on a table, a quart at a time, and separate  the largest and best from the others. Fully one-half will go to the side  of the largest and finest, and these may be put in a muslin bag, and  kept till wanted. Select the expeditionary pork with equal care, buying  nothing but thick, solid, \"clear,\" with a pink tinge. Reject that which  is white and lardy. With such material, if you cannot lay over Boston  baked beans, you had better sweep the cook out of camp.    This is how to cook them: Put a pound or a little more of clean pork in  the kettle, with water enough to cover it. Let it boil slowly half an  hour. In the meantime, wash and parboil one pint of beans. Drain the  water from the pork and place the beans around it; add two quarts of  water and hang the kettle where it will boil steadily, but not rapidly,  for two hours. Pare neatly and thinly five or six medium sized potatoes,  and allow them from thirty to forty minutes (according to size and  variety), in which to cook. They must be pressed down among the beans so  as to be entirely covered. If the beans be fresh and fine they will  probably fall to pieces before time is up. This, if they are not allowed  to scorch, makes them all the better. If a portion of pork be left over,  it is excellent sliced very thin when cold, and eaten with bread. The  above is a dinner for three or four hungry men.    It is usually the case that some of the party prefer baked beans. To  have these in perfection, add one gill of raw beans and a piece of pork  three inches square to the foregoing proportions. Boil as above, until  the beans begin to crack open; then fork out the smaller piece of pork,  place it in the center of your largest cooking tin, take beans enough  from the kettle to nearly fill the tin, set it over a bright fire on the  range, invert the second sized tin for a cover, place live, hard-wood  coals on top, and bake precisely as directed for bread--only, when the  coals on top become dull and black, brush them off, raise the cover, and  take a look. If the beans are getting too dry, add three or four  spoonfuls of liquor from the kettle, replace cover and coals, and let  them bake until they are of a rich light brown on top. Then serve. It is  a good dish. If Boston can beat it, I don't want to lay up anything for  old age.    Brown bread and baked beans have a natural connection in the average  American mind, and rightly. They supplement each other, even as spring  lamb and green peas with our transatlantic cousins. But there is a  better recipe for brown bread than is known to the dwellers of the  Hub--one that has captured first prizes at country fairs, and won the  approval of epicures from Maine to Minnesota; the one that brought  honest old Greeley down, on his strictures anent \"country bread.\" And  here is the recipe; take it for what it is worth, and try it fairly  before condemning it. It is for home use: One quart of sweet milk, one  quart of sour, two quarts of Indian meal and one quart of flour, and a  cupful of dark, thin Porto Rico molasses. Use one teaspoonful of soda  only. Bake in a steady, moderate oven, for four hours. Knead thoroughly  before baking.    Soup is, or should be, a leading food element in every woodland camp. I  am sorry to say that nothing is, as a rule, more badly botched, while  nothing is more easily or simply cooked as it should be. Soup requires  time, and a solid basis of the right material. Venison is the basis, and  the best material is the bloody part of the deer, where the bullet went  through. We used to throw this away; we have learned better. Cut about  four pounds of the bloody meat into convenient pieces, and wipe them as  clean as possible with leaves or a damp cloth, but don't wash them. Put  the meat into a five-quart kettle nearly filled with water, and raise it  to a lively boiling pitch. Let it boil for two hours. Have ready a  three-tined fork made from a branch of birch or beech, and with this  test the meat from time to time; when it parts readily from the bones,  slice in a large onion. Pare six large, smooth potatoes, cut five of  them into quarters, and drop them into the kettle; scrape the sixth one  into the soup for thickening. Season with salt and white pepper to  taste.    When, by skirmishing with the wooden fork, you can fish up bones with no  meat on them, the soup is cooked, and the kettle may be set aside to  cool. Any hungry sportsman can order the next motion. Squirrels--red,  black, gray or fox--make nearly as good a soup as venison, and better  stew. Hares, rabbits, grouse, quail, or any of the smaller game birds,  may be used in making soup; but all small game is better in a stew.    [Sidenote: _Stews and Fries_]    To make a stew, proceed for the first two hours precisely as directed  for soup; then slice in a couple of good-sized onions and six medium  potatoes. When the meat begins to fall from the bones, make a thickening  by rubbing three tablespoonfuls of flour and two spoonfuls of melted  butter together; thin to the consistency of cream with liquor from the  kettle, and drip slowly into the stew, stirring briskly meanwhile.

He is a good man ... but  were he as wicked as the hussar who ruined Esther.... O my God! desert  me not....\"    Crying thus in the agony of her soul, she did not hear the door open, or  a man's step behind her. A hand was laid upon her shoulder. She looked  up, her husband stood before her.    \"Thank God!\" he cried, joyfully, \"I am home at last. The storm has made  the roads....\" He stopped and looked at her.... \"Chane,\" he added,  anxiously, \"how ill you look! what is the matter?\"    She did not answer, and his glance fell on the letter. He reached toward  it, and she did not try to stop him. He read the first line, and became  as pale as death. \"To you--writing to you thus!\" He read a little  further, and then looked at the signature. \"From him! This is a blow I  did not expect.\" He read on. His eyes seemed starting out of their  sockets, his hand trembled, and his face showed how he suffered. \"What?\"  he cried, when he had reached a certain point. \"What? Is this true?\" He  ceased, and she slipped on to the floor and clasped his knees, while he  finished reading the letter.    He then threw it on the table, and bending over her, said sternly, \"Rise  and be seated.\"    She obeyed.    \"I only wish to know one thing,\" he went on, standing in front of  her--\"the Christian writes that you love him.... Is it not a lie?...  Chane, the Christian lies?...\"    Lower and lower she bent her head. \"Kill me,\" she said, \"for I deserve  it. What he writes is true. I do love him.\"    Nathan started convulsively. His usually placid features were strangely  agitated. \"The truth!\" he hissed; \"and you remain in my house, you false  wife?\"    She looked him in the face with flashing eyes.    \"Nathan!\" she cried, \"I swear by my dead mother that he touched my hand  to-day for the first time.\"    He gave a short laugh.    \"What if I believe you?\" he said. \"Shall we divide you between us? Shall  I possess you, and he have your love? Are you not mine, body and soul?  and if you could not be altogether mine, why did you become my wife?\"    She stepped close up to him, and said, with a despairing gesture, and a  sharp ring in her voice: \"Do not be so hard, Nathan. I have been a true  wife to you; but when you ask why I married you, I reply, that my wishes  were never consulted.\"    Her words seemed to strike him, for he could not answer, and there was a  long silence.    She buried her face in the sofa-cushions.    At last he said, \"Go--we will talk of this to-morrow.\"    She left the room.    He bolted the door and resumed his restless pacing up and down. The old  servant knocked at the door--she had brought the supper-tray, but he  dismissed her at once. She went away grumbling, and he heard her  afterward saying to the cook: \"God knows what is the matter! The master  has locked himself into the parlor, and the mistress is in her bedroom.  Neither of them will have any supper.\"    A hot flush of shame mounted quickly to Nathan's face.    \"The servants suspect something already,\" he thought, \"and soon all the  world will wonder what has happened. Old Jutta is right; God alone knows  what misery has fallen on my house, and God alone can help, for I know  not what to do.\"    He threw himself down on the sofa, and thought it all over again, but he  could not keep still, and soon started up and began to walk up and down  the room again.    \"How foolish it was of me to say that God alone could help!\" he thought.  \"God can not be expected to work miracles for our individual needs. What  can God do but let him die, or me?--that would solve the difficulty.\"    He pressed his burning brow on the window-pane, and stared out into the  darkness. \"I possessed a treasure, and I did not know its value until  another, who was wiser than I, came and took it from me.  Perhaps--perhaps I deserve it....    \"Deserve it!\" he repeated. \"No, no, she is my wife, and whoever takes  her from me is a robber and a coward....    \"He is a coward!... He, who always used to be such a good,  straightforward man. I can scarcely believe that he could have been so  wicked.... It must have been her fault--her fault alone.    \"But oh, is a wife like other property, as I have always thought? Is she  no more than any other chattel, such as an ornament or a house? Has she  not a will like every other human being? And has that will ever been  consulted?...    \"That was the sin, and now we are suffering from its consequences.    \"I was not to blame in those old days; nor was she. And we have lived  irreproachably for many years. The punishment for that sin has come upon  us now; and on which of us is the expiation to fall?...    \"Can I give her up? If I do, my heart will break; but my heart must not  decide. I must not think of myself; but try to find out whether it would  not be a sin against God and the law. Ought I to let my wife leave me,  and become the mistress of a Christian, or even become a Christian  herself? Ought I to bring such shame upon the name of our God and upon  his people?\"    He drew himself up to his full height, and stretched out his hand toward  heaven: \"Though my heart and hers should break, Thy name shall not be  dishonored, my Lord and my God.\"    His hand fell slowly, and he paused. \"Alas!\" he whispered, \"has not Thy  name even now been dishonored? Has she not spread her hands out to Thee  above the lights in my house, with the image of the Christian in her  heart? Could any sin be greater? Is it Thy will that this wickedness  should go on for the rest of our lives? Is it Thy will, O God?\"    He sat down, and bent his head upon the table. \"I do not know what to  do,\" he exclaimed aloud. \"Help me, O God! Thou hast revealed Thy will  through Thy priests and Thy prophets. I will study the law.\"    He went to the bookcase and took out a large folio. As he did so, a  little book that had been lying behind it fell on the floor. He did not  observe it, and carried the folio to the table, opened it, and began to  read.    He read for a long time, consulting different parts of it. At last he  closed the book sharply, stood up, and resting his clinched fist heavily  upon it, said, mournfully:    \"The law does not help me; there is nothing in it at all applicable to a  case such as this. The oldest law ordains that 'she should be stoned.'  And the law of the Talmud is this: 'Let her die because of her sin, if  the laws of the land in which ye live permit. If not, let the guilty  woman be thrust out of her husband's house, and let her return to her  father, who shall then punish and correct her as shall seem good in his  eyes. She shall be without honor and without rights, excluded from all  inheritance, and deprived of family ties....'    \"The law does not apply to us,\" he repeated. \"She has been weak, not  criminal. She has not deceived me--she is mine; but, alas! her heart  does not belong to me. It never did, and I never thought of trying to  make it mine. The law does not apply; and who can show me a higher law?\"    Sighing deeply, he replaced the folio on the shelf, but when he tried to  close the doors of the bookcase, he found that the little volume which  had fallen unobserved prevented his doing so. He picked it up and looked  at it. Memories of the past came back in a flood as he recognized the  German book he had read so often as a youth. He had never quite  understood its contents, and yet had studied it again and again, because  of the sympathetic emotion it aroused in him. Schiller's poems, which he  had laid aside for so many years, came into his hands again at this dark  hour of his life....    He sat down at the table, opened the book, and began to read. His  youthful days returned vividly to his mind. One poem he had read beneath  the old oak-tree in the park, and another he had surreptitiously studied  in a corner of the cellar when he was overlooking his father's workmen.  As he read on, he found to his surprise that he understood the whole  meaning of the poems, and yet he had learned nothing new since these old  days, except perhaps the secrets of the wine-trade. Each poem made a  deep impression on him. It was so different from all that he had found  in it before! Whether better or worse he did not stop to inquire; but  the influence must have been good, for his heart felt relieved of the  load that had oppressed it.    He rose and walked about the room in the stillness of the early Sabbath,  repeating in a whisper some of the words he had just read. The only  sound that was to be heard was the sputtering of one or other of the  numerous wax-lights, or the fall of a heavy rain-drop against the  window-pane.           *       *       *       *       *    Morning came at last. The rain had ceased falling, and the last clouds  were being driven by the wind across the leaden sky. In the east the sun  was beginning to redden, and send its first bright rays upon the sodden  plain: it had also penetrated to Nathan's parlor.    It found him still awake, but he was no longer restless, or speaking to  himself. He stood quietly by the window, his face turned toward the  east. The reflection of the sunrise lighted up his pale worn face, on  which the calmness and peace of determined action were expressed. His  eyes were fixed steadily on the east, and he seemed to be praying,  though his lips did not move.    He had stood there a long time communing with God in the silence of the  early morning.    The other inmates of the house began to stir. The servants held  whispered consultations; they guessed that something unusual had  happened.    Chane left her room. Her face was pale, and her eyes were red with  weeping. She approached Nathan with bent head.    \"Chane,\" he said, gently, \"I have made up my mind. I hope that what I  mean to do will be for the best for you--and for him. As for me, our God  is a merciful God--He will not forsake me.\"    He spoke the last words in"]]]
