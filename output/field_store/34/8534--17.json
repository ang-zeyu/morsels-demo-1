On the other hand, the  text keeps the promise of the title, and the advice that is given is good.  Each breed of dog has a chapter to itself, which opens with a few  introductory remarks of a general nature: then follow the points briefly  and plainly; next come average of the pup from six weeks old until he  attains maturity. A couple of pages at the end of the work are devoted to  the relation, and a few useful hints on buying, feeding, and breeding.  Needless to add that like all Mr. Vero Shaw's writings on canine subjects  the information is founded on practical experience and imparted in easy  excellent English.\"      NUNN, VETY. CAPT. J.

The first edition was out of print in six months, but, instead of  reprinting it, Capt. Hayes thought it better to wait until he had enough  material in hand to enable him to make to the second edition those  additions and improvements he had proposed to himself to add. The result  is in every way satisfactory, and in this handsome book the searcher after  sound information on the make and shape of the horse will find what will  be of the utmost use to him. Those who have been, or who contemplate being  at no distant date, in the position of judges at horse shows, will derive  great benefit from a careful perusal of Capt. Hayes's pages.\"      HAYES, CAPT. M. HORACE, F.R.C.V.S.    Illustrated Horsebreaking. Second Edition.

Upper parts gray to blackish; tail with black mid-dorsal  stripe extending onto back; never all white in winter. On the tableland  of Mexico and in the southwestern United States where this species  occurs together with the white-sided jack rabbits, _L. californicus_ can  be recognized by the terminal black patch on the outside of each ear and  by the less extensive area of white on the flank. To the eastward, in  Tamaulipas, where only the black-tailed jack rabbit occurs, it too, has  extensively white flanks and some individuals lack the terminal black  patch on the ear.    A certain means for distinguishing the skulls of the black-tailed jack  rabbit from those of all of the white-sided jack rabbits has not yet  been found. The same is true of the skulls of the white-tailed jack  rabbit and the black-tailed jack rabbit in the Great Basin region of  Nevada. The skulls, at least of adults, of these two species, in the  region east of the Rocky Mountains can be readily distinguished by the  pattern of infolding of the enamel on the front of the first upper  incisor teeth; _L. townsendii_ has a simple groove on the anterior face  of the tooth and _L. californicus_, east of the Rocky Mountains, has a  bifurcation, or even trifurcation, of the infold that can readily be  seen by examining the occlusal surface of the incisor.    In Arizona, Vorhies and Taylor (1933:478) found the weight of 23 adult  males to average 5.1 (4.4-6.1) lbs. In that state, 70 pregnant females  averaged 2.24 (1-6) young per litter and the authors (_op. cit._)  thought that a female had three or four litters each year.
