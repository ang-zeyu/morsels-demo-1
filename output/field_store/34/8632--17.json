Snakebite in the United States    Many estimates have been made of the number of bites of poisonous snakes  that occur annually in the United States. The occurrence of poisonous  snakebite has been nearly as badly underestimated as fatal results of  their envenomations have been overrated. For important data on number of  persons bitten by poisonous snakes in the United States, see the  following: Allen and Swindell (1948:15); Githens (1935:172); Klauber  (1956:811); Parrish (1963); Sowder and Gehres (1963:973); Stimson and  Engelhardt (1960:153); Swaroop and Grab (1956:441); Swartzwelder  (1950:579); Willson (1908:530); and Wood (1954b:937).    Judging from estimates made in several states, the number of poisonous  snakebites in the United States would be about 5000 per year. In the  region where the cottonmouth occurs there are approximately 2000 persons  bitten annually by poisonous snakes. Of these approximately 39 per cent  are copperhead bites, 30 per cent each are cottonmouth and rattlesnake  bites, and I per cent are coral snake bites. These percentages vary  considerably from place to place, because of the distribution and  abundance of the eight species of poisonous snakes whose ranges overlap  that of the cottonmouth.    According to Parrish (1963), about 14 people die of snakebite each year  in the United States. Of these deaths, about 6.6 per cent are  attributable to cottonmouths, 77.0 per cent to rattlesnakes, and 1.6 per  cent to coral snakes; 14.8 per cent are unidentified. Almost half of the  fatalities are in persons less than 20 years of age, the high mortality  rate being partially due to the greater ratio of venom to body weight.          SUMMARY      In my study, 306 living and preserved cottonmouths were examined. This  species occurs throughout the coastal plains of the southeastern United  States, usually at altitudes of less than 500 feet but occasionally up  to altitudes of more than 2000 feet.    Two subspecies are recognized: the eastern cottonmouth, _A. p.  piscivorus_, occurring from extreme eastern Mississippi to southeastern  Virginia and Florida; and the western cottonmouth, _A. p. leucostoma_,  occurring from eastern Mississippi northward to southern Illinois and  Missouri and westward to central Texas. Intergradation occurs in eastern  Mississippi.    The northern edge of the range is probably limited by low temperatures  in winter, and the western edge by lack of available habitat resulting  from insufficient precipitation. Old records of occurrence indicate that  the range has decreased in the last 100 years. The species inhabits  mostly areas where water is found, but at times wanders a mile or more  from the nearest water.    The ground color is predominantly a brown, but varies from a  brownish-green to almost black with a pattern of 10 to 17 irregular  bands of a darker shade of brown. The pattern is better defined in the  eastern subspecies than in the western.    The scutellation resembles that of other species of _Agkistrodon_. In  the specimens examined supralabials ranged from 7 to 9, and infralabials  from 8 to 12. The number of dorsal scale rows on the neck, at mid-body,  and immediately anterior to the anus is relatively constant at 27-25-21,  respectively. Ventral scales of 34 males averaged 134.4 (128 to 139),  and those of 48 females 133.5 (128 to 137). The number of caudal scales  showed some degree of sexual dimorphism; the average was 45.4 (41 to 50)  in 34 males and 42.6 (39 to 49) in 44 females. In general, caudal scales  on the basal half of the tail are undivided, whereas those on the distal  half are divided. No marked geographical variation was found in any  scale character.    The poison fangs vary in length from 1.3 per cent of snout-vent length  in juveniles to 1.0 per cent in large adults. Fangs of captive  cottonmouths were shed and replaced at intervals of about 21 days, but  the interval was variable. Relationships in distance between the base of  fangs and between fang punctures in an actual bite indicate that  examination of the wound does not provide a good basis for judging  accurately the size of the snake that inflicted the bite.    In general, females less than 450 millimeters in snout-vent length were  juveniles; those more than 450 millimeters were classified as post  partum or reproductive on the basis of sizes of ovarian follicles. Since  about half the adult females were fecund, it was concluded that a  biennial reproductive cycle occurs in this species. An annual cycle may  occur in areas where temperature permits year-round activity. It was  estimated that females become sexually mature at an age of approximately  two and one-half years. Mating is probably most concentrated in early  spring at about the time when females ovulate, but copulation is not a  stimulus for ovulation. Sperm retention and delayed fertilization allow  young to be produced without copulation occurring in each breeding  season. The testes increase in size gradually rather than rapidly at  maturity or in each breeding season, but seasonal cycles in sperm  production occur.    The gestation period is three and one-half to four months. Determination  of sex in the embryos is possible by late June, because the hemipenes of  males are evaginated until the time of birth. Parturition generally  occurs in August or September, but captivity may delay birth for a month  or more. From one to 16 young per litter are born, depending on size of  the mother and other factors; but the average is between six and seven.  Mortality rate at birth is high in captive individuals but has not been  determined in natural populations. The sex ratio in embryos and adults  examined revealed about 53 per cent females. Because sufficient  information on population composition is not available, an estimate of  the percentage of adults in a natural population was based upon the  number found in my study. The reproductive potential was estimated from  these figures.    Normal young at birth are 230 to 240 millimeters in snout-vent length,  but their size is influenced by the condition of the mother. Comparison  of newborn young with those captured in spring indicates that little  growth occurs during winter. Early growth is largely dependent upon  feeding before winter quiescence.    The umbilical cord is broken at birth and the navel closes within a few  days, but the scar remains throughout life. Sexual dimorphism in the  position of the scar is characteristic of some snakes but is minimal in  cottonmouths.    In those snakes more than 700 millimeters in length, males outnumber  females three to one. The maximum age of cottonmouths in nature is  unknown, but one has been kept in captivity for more than 18 years.    Allometric growth is striking in cottonmouths. The head and tail are  proportionately longer in young individuals than in adults; and in males  the tail is, on the average, slightly longer than in females of the same  size.    Shedding of the skin provides for growth and wear in snakes. The young  shed within a few days after birth and generally shed more frequently  than adults. Frequency of shedding depends mostly on amount of food  consumed, and there is some evidence that injuries on the head and neck  increase the frequency of shedding. Before shedding, the eyes become  cloudy for about five and one-half days, then clear up again for about  four days before the skin is shed.    The food of cottonmouths consists mainly of small vertebrates and  occasionally invertebrates that are found near water. Fish, amphibians,  and reptiles make up nearly 70 per cent of the diet. Carrion is also  eaten and cannibalism occurs occasionally. Food is obtained by lying in  ambush or by active searching. The young are known to lure their prey  within striking range by waving their yellow tails in a manner  suggestive of writhing grubs. The method of obtaining prey differs  according to the kind of prey. Generally, cottonmouths retain their hold  on fish or frogs but release mice and larger prey after delivering a  bite.    The major causes of mortality of cottonmouths are obscure. Predators are  known to include alligators, indigo snakes, king-snakes, largemouth  bass, and blue herons; there are probably numerous others. Heavy  parasitic infestations were found among the snakes examined. Snake  mites, _Ophionyssus natricus_, became increasingly abundant on almost  all captive snakes in April and May of 1963. Lung flukes (_Ochetosoma_  sp.) were in 16 of 20 captive snakes, and many preserved specimens  contained nematodes (_Kalicephalus_ sp.) in the stomach and/or tapeworms  (_Ophiotaenia_ sp.) in the intestine. Although parasitic infestation  causes discomfort and may lower resistance to other detrimental factors,  it is difficult to attribute death to the effect of any particular kind  of parasite. Miscellaneous causes of death of some captive snakes also  were discussed.    The maximal body temperatures tolerated by four cottonmouths were  between 38 deg. and 40 deg. C., but a temperature of 38 deg. was lethal to a fifth  individual. Cottonmouths have been found on occasion when other snakes  were inactive because of low temperatures, but minimal temperatures  tolerated by this species are not known. The annual cycle of activity is  dependent upon temperature and thus varies from north to south.  Cottonmouths generally migrate inland in autumn, usually to dry forested  hillsides, where they den along with other species of snakes. After a  few warm days in spring they migrate back to the water's edge. The diel  activity cycle likewise depends upon temperatures but is influenced by  other factors as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38315"],[0,"Artistic Anatomy of Animals (#15)"],[1,"which is directed inwards. This forms a kind of hook curved  towards the inside; it represents the coracoid process. The scapula is  surmounted by the cartilage of prolongation, of which the superior  border, which is thin and curved, is parallel to the superior border of  the prominence of the withers; the cartilage forms, consequently, the  lateral surface of this region. The cartilage of prolongation undergoes  ossification in old horses. The humerus is short; the bicipital groove,  situated on the anterior surface of the superior extremity, separates  the greater tuberosity from the lesser, and is divided into two parts by  a median ridge; it is this portion of the humerus which forms the  prominence known as the _point of the shoulder_, or _point of the arm_.  The deltoid impression well deserves the name of tuberosity which has  been given to it, for it is very prominent; the musculo-spiral groove is  very deep.

The olecranon fossa is deep. The epicondyle  and the epitrochlea are somewhat different from those of the human bone.  In the latter, the epitrochlea is salient towards the inner side,  causing an increased transverse diameter of the inferior extremity of  the humerus. In the horse--it is the same in ruminants--this tuberosity  projects backwards, folds on itself in forming the internal boundary of  the olecranon cavity, and exceeds in diameter, in the antero-posterior  direction, the prominence of the epicondyle, which presents a nearly  similar arrangement. This latter has, however, a part which, projecting  externally, is situated at the inferior part of a crest, that forms the  posterior boundary of the musculo-spiral groove. The result is that,  contrary to the condition found in the human being, the epicondyle is  more prominent transversely than the epitrochlea, but this latter is  more salient on the posterior aspect. The epitrochlea and the epicondyle  offer a larger surface for the origin of muscles of the forearm than the  same prominences in the human bone do for the analogous muscles of the  same region.    Some veterinary anatomists have given to the inferior and external  articular surface of the humerus the name of trochlea; and to the  internal one, that of condyle. On this account they designate the  external prominence as the epitrochlea, and the internal one as the  epicondyle. In addition to the fact that this point of view is not  legitimate, it produces inevitable confusion when comparing the parts  with those of the human humerus, and this confusion exists, not alone in  describing the bone, but also in the description of the muscular  attachments, and in the comparison of the muscles of the forearm of  quadrupeds with the corresponding muscles in the human species.    The radius is placed in front of the ulna; its body, slightly convex  forwards, has the anterior surface convex transversely, and the  posterior surface plane in the same direction. It is to the external  part of this latter that the ulna is applied, which is completely fused  with the radius.    The superior extremity of the radius is a little larger than the  inferior. Its superior aspect, concavo-convex, moulded on the inferior  articular surface of the humerus, presents internally two cavities,  which receive the lips of the trochlea, and, externally, another,  smaller, cavity, which receives the condyle. The radius articulates with  the trochlea and the condyle, having appropriated a portion of the ulna,  as is proved by the presence of the coronoid process, which belongs to  the former. This superior extremity presents, internally, a tuberosity  into which the biceps is inserted; this is the bicipital tuberosity; and  on the other side is another tuberosity, which is a little more  prominent than the preceding.    The inferior extremity, which is flattened from before backwards, is  furrowed on its anterior surface by grooves for the passage of muscles  (the names of the muscles whose tendons pass in these grooves have  already been given on p. 43). It articulates at the lower end with the  superior row of the carpus, and it terminates laterally in tuberosities:  one, external, on which is found a groove for the tendon of the lateral  extensor of the phalanges, the homologue of the special extensor of the  little finger; the other, internal, is a little more prominent than the  one we have just described. These tuberosities are visible under the  skin which covers the superior and lateral parts of the region known as  the _knee_; but which, we again repeat, is no other than the wrist.    The ulna has a triangular shaft, situated at the posterior surface of  the radius, with which it is fused. It disappears completely at the  level of the inferior third of the forearm. Occasionally, in some  horses, the ulna is abnormally long, in the form of a slender tongue of  bone; and extends to the neighbourhood of the external tuberosity of the  inferior extremity of the radius (see Fig. 79, p. 196). Its superior  extremity is chiefly represented by the olecranon process, which is  voluminous in bulk, and forms the projection known as the point of the  elbow. This process is flattened laterally; its internal surface is  excavated; the anterior surface, which is concave, forms a part of the  great sigmoid cavity; the remainder of the cavity is formed by the  radius.    In the ass, the ulna is a little longer than in the horse--that is to  say, it descends lower; and the radius is a little more convex  anteriorly.    The carpal bones are seven in number--four in the superior row, and  three in the inferior. The trapezium is wanting in the latter.  Sometimes, however, in certain varieties of horses the trapezium is  developed, but then it is no more than a very small osseous nodule. The  pisiform bone, situated at the external part of the first row of bone,  is prominent posteriorly. It is of rounder form and flattened from  without inwards. It articulates with the trapezium and the radius. It  presents, on its external surface, a groove for the passage of the  tendon of the posterior ulnar muscle, which is named by veterinary  anatomists the _external flexor of the metacarpus_.    The carpus, as a whole, is of an irregularly cuboid shape; its anterior  surface, slightly convex from side to side, forms the skeleton of the  region of the _knee_ (wrist). The metacarpus is formed of three bones:  the principal metacarpal and the two rudimentary ones.    The principal metacarpal, which forms the region of the _canon_, is  directed vertically; its anterior surface is slightly convex  transversely. This surface is covered by a number of tendons, which  slightly alter its appearance; so that it is the principal base of this  part of the fore-limb. Its posterior surface is flattened. The superior  extremity of this metacarpal presents plane surfaces, variously  inclined, with which the bones of the inferior row of the carpus  articulate. On the anterior surface, and a little to the inner side, is  found a tuberosity, which is destined for the insertion of _the anterior  extensor of the metacarpus_, the homologue of the radial muscles. The  inferior extremity is formed by two condyles, an internal and an  external; between which is found a median crest.    This extremity, the superior extremity of the first phalanx, which  articulates with it, together with two sesamoid bones--the great  sesamoids--which are situated on its posterior surface, collectively  form the region which from its rounded outlines is called the _ball_.    With regard to the rudimentary metacarpals, external and internal, to  which some authors give the name of _fibulae_, they are applied to the  sides of the posterior surface of the principal metacarpal. They are  elongated bones, of which the superior extremity, which is a little  thickened, is called the _head_; the lateral bones of the second row of  the carpus partly rest on the heads of these. They become more slender  as they descend, and terminate opposite the inferior fourth of the  principal metacarpal. Each ends in a slight swelling, to which the name  _button_ has been given. The internal one is the better developed.    The rudimentary metacarpals are vestiges of atrophied digits, as will be  explained further on.    The single finger of the horse consists of three phalanges. The first  phalanx, which is directed obliquely downwards and forwards, corresponds  to the constricted region situated below the 'ball,' and known as the  _pastern_. It is flattened from before backwards; its anterior surface  is convex transversely, while the posterior surface is plane. Its  superior extremity is moulded on the "]]]
