Then the rest of you may  attempt it, and soon we shall free all those who are enslaved.\"    \"What if we fail?\" enquired the Scarecrow.  \"I'd look nice as a piece  of bric-a-brac, wouldn't I?\"    \"We must not fail!\" cried Ozma, courageously.  \"Having come all this  distance to free these poor people, it would be weak and cowardly in us  to abandon the adventure.  Therefore I will accept the Nome King's  offer, and go at once into the royal palace.\"    \"Come along, then, my dear,\" said the King, climbing down from his  throne with some difficulty, because he was so fat; \"I'll show you the  way.\"    He approached a wall of the cave and waved his hand.  Instantly an  opening appeared, through which Ozma, after a smiling farewell to her  friends, boldly passed.    She found herself in a splendid hall that was more beautiful and grand  than anything she had ever beheld.  The ceilings were composed of great  arches that rose far above her head, and all the walls and floors were  of polished marble exquisitely tinted in many colors.  Thick velvet  carpets were on the floor and heavy silken draperies covered the arches  leading to the various rooms of the palace.  The furniture was made of  rare old woods richly carved and covered with delicate satins, and the  entire palace was lighted by a mysterious rosy glow that seemed to come  from no particular place but flooded each apartment with its soft and  pleasing radiance.    Ozma passed from one room to another, greatly delighted by all she saw.  The lovely palace had no other occupant, for the Nome King had left her  at the entrance, which closed behind her, and in all the magnificent  rooms there appeared to be no other person.    Upon the mantels, and on many shelves and brackets and tables, were  clustered ornaments of every description, seemingly made out of all  sorts of metals, glass, china, stones and marbles.  There were vases,  and figures of men and animals, and graven platters and bowls, and  mosaics of precious gems, and many other things.  Pictures, too, were  on the walls, and the underground palace was quite a museum of rare and  curious and costly objects.    After her first hasty examination of the rooms Ozma began to wonder  which of all the numerous ornaments they contained were the  transformations of the royal family of Ev.  There was nothing to guide  her, for everything seemed without a spark of life.  So she must guess  blindly; and for the first time the girl came to realize how dangerous  was her task, and how likely she was to lose her own freedom in  striving to free others from the bondage of the Nome King.  No wonder  the cunning monarch laughed good naturedly with his visitors, when he  knew how easily they might be entrapped.    But Ozma, having undertaken the venture, would not abandon it.  She  looked at a silver candelabra that had ten branches, and thought: \"This  may be the Queen of Ev and her ten children.\" So she touched it and  uttered aloud the word \"Ev,\" as the Nome King had instructed her to do  when she guessed.  But the candelabra remained as it was before.    Then she wandered into another room and touched a china lamb, thinking  it might be one of the children she sought.  But again she was  unsuccessful.  Three guesses; four guesses; five, six, seven, eight,  nine and ten she made, and still not one of them was right!    The girl shivered a little and grew pale even under the rosy light; for  now but one guess remained, and her own fate depended upon the result.    She resolved not to be hasty, and strolled through all the rooms once  more, gazing earnestly upon the various ornaments and trying to decide  which she would touch.  Finally, in despair, she decided to leave it  entirely to chance.  She faced the doorway of a room, shut her eyes  tightly, and then, thrusting aside the heavy draperies, she advanced  blindly with her right arm outstretched before her.    Slowly, softly she crept forward until her hand came in contact with an  object upon a small round table.  She did not know what it was, but in  a low voice she pronounced the word \"Ev.\"    The rooms were quite empty of life after that.  The Nome King had  gained a new ornament.  For upon the edge of the table rested a pretty  grasshopper, that seemed to have been formed from a single emerald.  It  was all that remained of Ozma of Oz.    In the throne room just beyond the palace the Nome King suddenly looked  up and smiled.    \"Next!\" he said, in his pleasant voice.    Dorothy, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Woodman, who had been sitting in  anxious silence, each gave a start of dismay and stared into one  another's eyes.    \"Has she failed?\" asked Tiktok.    \"So it seems,\" answered the little monarch, cheerfully.  \"But that is  no reason one of you should not succeed.  The next may have twelve  guesses, instead of eleven, for there are now twelve persons  transformed into ornaments.  Well, well!  Which of you goes next?\"    \"I'll go,\" said Dorothy.    \"Not so,\" replied the Tin Woodman.  \"As commander of Ozma's army, it is  my privilege to follow her and attempt her rescue.\"    \"Away you go, then,\" said the Scarecrow.  \"But be careful, old friend.\"    \"I will,\" promised the Tin Woodman; and then he followed the Nome King  to the entrance to the palace and the rock closed behind him.          13.  The Nome King Laughs      In a moment the King returned to his throne and relighted his pipe, and  the rest of the little band of adventurers settled themselves for  another long wait.  They were greatly disheartened by the failure of  their girl Ruler, and the knowledge that she was now an ornament in the  Nome King's palace--a dreadful, creepy place in spite of all its  magnificence.  Without their little leader they did not know what to do  next, and each one, down to the trembling private of the army, began to  fear he would soon be more ornamental than useful.    Suddenly the Nome King began laughing.    \"Ha, ha, ha!  He, he, he!  Ho, ho, ho!\"    \"What's happened?\" asked the Scarecrow.    \"Why, your friend, the Tin Woodman, has become the funniest thing you  can imagine,\" replied the King, wiping the tears of merriment from his  eyes.  \"No one would ever believe he could make such an amusing  ornament.  Next!\"    They gazed at each other with sinking hearts.  One of the generals  began to weep dolefully.    \"What are you crying for?\" asked the Scarecrow, indignant at such a  display of weakness.    \"He owed me six weeks back pay,\" said the general, \"and I hate to lose  him.\"    \"Then you shall go and find him,\" declared the Scarecrow.    \"Me!\" cried the general, greatly alarmed.    \"Certainly.  It is your duty to follow your commander.  March!\"    \"I won't,\" said the general.  \"I'd like to, of course; but I just  simply WON'T.\"    The Scarecrow looked enquiringly at the Nome King.    \"Never mind,\" said the jolly monarch.  \"If he doesn't care to enter the  palace and make his guesses I'll throw him into one of my fiery  furnaces.\"    \"I'll go!--of course I'm going,\" yelled the general, as quick as scat.  \"Where is the entrance--where is it?  Let me go at once!\"    So the Nome King escorted him into the palace, and again returned to  await the result.  What the general did, no one can tell; but it was  not long before the King called for the next victim, and a colonel was  forced to try his fortune.    Thus, one after another, all of the twenty-six officers filed into the  palace and made their guesses--and became ornaments.    Meantime the King ordered refreshments to be served to those waiting,  and at his command a rudely shaped Nome entered, bearing a tray.  This  Nome was not unlike the others that Dorothy had seen, but he wore a  heavy gold chain around his neck to show that he was the Chief Steward  of the Nome King, and he assumed an air of much importance, and even  told his majesty not to eat too much cake late at night, or he would be  ill.    Dorothy, however, was hungry, and she was not afraid of being ill; so  she ate several cakes and found them good, and also she drank a cup of  excellent coffee made of a richly flavored clay, browned in the  furnaces and then ground fine, and found it most refreshing and not at  all muddy.    Of all the party which had started upon this adventure, the little  Kansas girl was now left alone with the Scarecrow, Tiktok, and the  private for counsellors and companions.  Of course the Cowardly Lion  and the Hungry Tiger were still there, but they, having also eaten some  of the cakes, had gone to sleep at one side of the cave, while upon the  other side stood the Sawhorse, motionless and silent, as became a mere  thing of wood.  Billina had quietly walked around and picked up the  crumbs of cake which had been scattered, and now, as it was long after  bed-time, she tried to find some dark place in which to go to sleep.    Presently the hen espied a hollow underneath the King's rocky throne,  and crept into it unnoticed.  She could still hear the chattering of  those around her, but it was almost dark underneath the throne, so that  soon she had fallen fast asleep.    \"Next!\" called the King, and the private, whose turn it was to enter  the fatal palace, shook hands with Dorothy and the Scarecrow and bade  them a sorrowful good-bye, and passed through the rocky portal.    They waited a long time, for the private was in no hurry to become an  ornament and made his guesses very slowly.  The Nome King, who seemed  to know, by some magical power, all that took place in his beautiful  rooms of his palace, grew impatient finally and declared he would sit  up no longer.    \"I love ornaments,\" said he, \"but I can wait until tomorrow to get more  of them; so, as soon as that stupid private is transformed, we will all  go to bed and leave the job to be finished in the morning.\"    \"Is it so very late?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Why, it is after midnight,\" said the King, \"and that strikes me as  being"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48991"],[0,"Leyte: The Return to the Philippines (#15)"],[1,"Philippines. It  was estimated that from 1 September to 15 September 105 merchant  vessels were sunk in those waters by carrier planes, destroyers,  cruisers, and submarines. Although exact information was lacking on  the number of enemy vessels present in the Visayan and Mindanao areas,  it was thought that 50 percent of the Japanese merchant marine in  those areas was eliminated. A successful attrition of the Japanese  air and naval strength in the Philippines had been accomplished. [144]    The Third Fleet's carriers then started to neutralize the approaches  to the Philippine Islands. The carrier-based aircraft launched  strikes against enemy aircraft staging areas in the Ryukyus, of which  Okinawa is the largest and most important. As a result of attacks on  10 October, they destroyed an estimated 23 enemy planes in the air  and 88 on the ground or in the water. Admiral Halsey reported that  his flyers sank 1 subtender, 1 mine sweeper, 1 destroyer escort,  2 mine-craft, 4 midget submarines, 20 cargo ships, and 45 other  craft. In addition, nearly as many ships, mostly of small size,  were damaged. [145] On 11 October the flyers struck at Luzon.        Air and Naval Action in the Formosa Area    The plans of the Third Fleet called for strong carrier-based strikes  against Formosa on 12 and 13 October. The four task groups of Task  Force 38 were assigned targets in the southern Formosa, northern  Formosa, central Formosa, and the Takao areas, respectively. (Takao  is a port city on the southwest coast of Formosa.) After a fast run  on the night of 11-12 October the carriers of Task Force 38 arrived  in position off Formosa in the early morning. Although the Japanese  were aware of the approach of the task force, they made no attacks  against it before dawn. As the first fighters started sweeps over  their respective areas, heavy opposition developed, but it dropped  markedly during the day. From 12 to 14 October the Japanese lost some  280 aircraft, [146] while the Americans lost 76. As a result of the  operation, the Japanese lost half of their naval air strength. This  loss gave assurance that the U. S. forces would have air superiority  over the Leyte area on A Day. [147]    On the evening of 13 October the American heavy cruiser Canberra  was torpedoed eighty-five miles off Formosa. Admiral Halsey kept  his forces in the area another day in order to afford protection to  the Canberra. Attacks, therefore, continued against enemy aircraft,  airfields, and installations. By this time, Japanese reinforcements  had arrived. On the evening of 14 October an aerial torpedo hit the  heavy cruiser Houston.    Admiral Halsey decided to capitalize on the damage inflicted on the two  cruisers. He ordered two task groups, which included the battleships,  to retire eastward out of sight; he sent another of the task groups  to conduct intermittent air raids against northern Luzon; and he  assigned the remaining task group to protect the crippled Canberra and  Houston. Halsey instructed this last task group to send out messages in  the clear begging piteously for assistance. He hoped that by this ruse,  which he called the \"Lure of the Streamlined Bait,\" the Japanese fleet  would be led to believe that this task group was all that remained of  the task force and would therefore sweep down for the kill. The two  task groups which had retired eastward would then appear and engage  the enemy. The Japanese swallowed the bait and dispatched destroyers  and cruisers toward the \"crippled\" American force. Unfortunately,  their search planes uncovered the two task forces off Formosa, and  the Japanese surface ships hastily withdrew.    The enemy pilots made such greatly exaggerated claims of success that  Imperial General Headquarters decided to order out the 2d Diversion  Attack Force against the Americans. The flying units of Carrier  Divisions 3 and 4 were transferred to the 2d Air Fleet. These air  units proceeded to Formosa on the 12th of October. Carrier Divisions  3 and 4, however, remained in the Inland Sea until they sortied forth  for the Battle of Leyte Gulf. [148] The exaggerated claims of the  Japanese air force were accepted jubilantly on the home islands. The  people felt that the American Navy had indeed been given a death  blow, and the Finance Ministry distributed \"celebration sake\" to  all households in the country to commemorate the event. The Tokyo  radio made the unfounded claim that \"a total of 57 enemy warships  including 19 aircraft carriers and four battleships were sunk or  heavily damaged by the Japanese forces ... the enemy task forces  lost the majority of their strength and were put to rout....\" [149]  It also predicted that the Allied losses would delay the invasion of  the Philippine Islands by two months. [150]    Admiral Halsey's reaction was to report that \"all 3d Fleet Ships  reported by radio Tokyo as sunk have now been salvaged and are retiring  towards the enemy.\" [151]    The convoy, as it steamed toward Leyte, received the news of the  United States success with considerable satisfaction. At this time,  however, Admiral Halsey announced that the Third Fleet was being  deployed for action, since he was expecting the Japanese to rise  to his bait. Consequently the Third Fleet, except for the current  strike at Luzon, could not furnish any more carrier support for the  operation. [152] The Third Fleet task group which went to the Luzon  area successfully struck at enemy airfields and shipping. From 17 to  19 October it destroyed an estimated ninety-nine enemy aircraft on  the ground and ninety-five in the air. [153]        Realignment of Air Support    On the heels of Admiral Halsey's announcement that no assistance in  connection with the Leyte landings could be expected from the Third  Fleet, Far East Air Forces stated that the Fifth Air Force would  support the Leyte operation as a \"priority mission.\" [154] At the  same time the Seventh Fleet requested intensive reconnaissance of  San Bernardino and Surigao Straits in the Leyte area. This mission  was assigned to the Fifth Air Force, which was also charged with  neutralizing the Visayan airfields. The Thirteenth Air Force was to  expedite the basing on Morotai of heavy bombers which could be called  forward in support when requested by the Fifth Air Force. From 18 to  19 October the carrier aircraft of the Seventh Fleet protected the  convoy and struck at small vessels and airfields in northern Mindanao  as well as defense and communications installations and airfields on  Leyte. [155]    Although the missions Admiral Halsey had assigned his carriers  apparently prevented any aircraft of the Third Fleet from participating  in direct support of the landings, Halsey nevertheless ordered one  of the task groups to strike at the Leyte, Samar, Cebu, and Negros  areas on 18-19 October and to provide direct air support for the  Leyte operation on 20 October. [156] Moreover, by 18 October news  was received that the Japanese had discovered the ruse and withdrawn  their warships from the Formosa area, thus leaving Admiral Halsey's  forces free to protect the operation by covering San Bernardino and  Surigao Straits. [157]    The carrier force of the Seventh Fleet was to bear the brunt of the  tactical air support. By the afternoon and night of 17 October the  weather had cleared, and flying conditions were perfect as the carriers  moved into their operation areas the following morning. The force was  divided into three units: one unit operated in the southern part of  Leyte Gulf to protect the landings at Panaon Strait; another operated  near the entrance to the gulf in order to support the landings of  the Southern Attack Force at Dulag; and the last operated southeast  of Samar Island to support the landings of the Northern Attack Force  at Tacloban.    During 18 and 19 October, aircraft from the carriers struck at  enemy airfields on Cebu, Negros, and Panay Islands. There was very  little enemy activity from the Japanese airfields in the Leyte area,  since they were still sodden from the recent storms. In the two days'  strikes, the Seventh Fleet aircraft destroyed an estimated thirty-six  enemy planes and damaged twenty-eight more. [158]          Japanese Plan of Defense    The air blows on the Philippines served as a warning that the Americans  were ready to return to the Islands--an event long expected by the  Japanese. By the end of June 1944, the Japanese military situation  had considerably worsened. The outer circle of Japan's perimeter had  been pierced and the impetus of the American drive showed no signs  of slackening. (Map 4)    The Allied nations had hit the Japanese from east and west and  seriously interfered with their seaborne commerce. Japan was in grave  danger of being separated from her stolen southern area--the source  of her raw materials. Units within this area were also being forcibly  isolated from each other. The fall of Saipan had brought about a  \"most serious crisis.\" Premier Tojo was removed and Kuniaki Koiso  formed a new cabinet. [159]    In the summer of 1944 Imperial General Headquarters had started to  strengthen the Philippines, the Ryukyus, the Kurile Islands, and Japan  itself--the \"first line of sea defense.\" If the Allies landed forces  in any of these areas, the Japanese would concentrate their land,  air, and sea forces and attempt to repel the landing force. These  operations were known as the SHO (Victory) Operations. Defense of  the Philippines was SHO I. [160]    The Japanese strategy was simple. Japan wished to remain in the war,  and to do so she must at all costs keep open the lines of communication  to the sources of her raw materials in the Netherlands Indies.    In the first part of August 1944, the headquarters of the 14th Area  Army, which was to be charged with the defense of the Philippine  Archipelago, was organized under the command of the Southern Army,  while the 35th Army,"]]]
