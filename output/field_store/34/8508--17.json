A more brilliant member  of the Pennsylvania delegation, and one of the most brilliant of the  Convention, was Gouverneur Morris, who shone by his cleverness and quick  wit as well as by his wonderful command of language. But Morris was  admired more than he was trusted; and, while he supported the efforts  for a strong government, his support was not always as great a help as  might have been expected. A crippled arm and a wooden leg might detract  from his personal appearance, but they could not subdue his spirit and  audacity.*            * There is a story which illustrates admirably the audacity of  Morris and the austere dignity of Washington. The story runs that Morris  and several members of the Cabinet were spending an evening at the  President's house in Philadelphia, where they were discussing the  absorbing question of the hour, whatever it may have been. \"The  President,\" Morris is said to have related on the following day, \"was  standing with his arms behind him--his usual position--his back to the  fire. I started up and spoke, stamping, as I walked up and down, with my  wooden leg; and, as I was certain I had the best of the argument, as  I finished I stalked up to the President, slapped him on the back, and  said. \"Ain't I right, General?\" The President did not speak, but the  majesty of the American people was before me. Oh, his look! How I wished  the floor would open and I could descend to the cellar! You know me,\"  continued Mr. Morris, \"and you know my eye would never quail before  any other mortal.\"--W. T. Read, Life and Correspondence of George Read  (1870) p.441.      There were other prominent members of the Pennsylvania delegation, but  none of them took an important part in the Convention, not even the aged  Benjamin Franklin, President of the State. At the age of eighty-one his  powers were failing, and he was so feeble that his colleague Wilson read  his speeches for him. His opinions were respected, but they do not seem  to have carried much weight.    Other noteworthy members of the Convention, though hardly in the first  class, were the handsome and charming Rufus King of Massachusetts,  one of the coming men of the country, and Nathaniel Gorham of the same  State, who was President of Congress--a man of good sense rather than of  great ability, but one whose reputation was high and whose presence was  a distinct asset to the Convention. Then, too, there were the delegates  from South Carolina: John Rutledge, the orator, General Charles  Cotesworth Pinckney of Revolutionary fame, and his cousin, Charles  Pinckney. The last named took a conspicuous part in the proceedings in  Philadelphia but, so far as the outcome was concerned, left his mark on  the Constitution mainly in minor matters and details.    The men who have been named were nearly all supporters of the plan for  a centralized government. On the other side were William Paterson of New  Jersey, who had been Attorney-General of his State for eleven years  and who was respected for his knowledge and ability; John Dickinson  of Delaware, the author of the \"Farmer's Letters\" and chairman of  the committee of Congress that had framed the Articles of  Confederation--able, scholarly, and sincere, but nervous, sensitive,  and conscientious to the verge of timidity--whose refusal to sign the  Declaration of Independence had cost him his popularity, though he was  afterward returned to Congress and became president successively  of Delaware and of Pennsylvania; Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, a  successful merchant, prominent in politics, and greatly interested  in questions of commerce and finance; and the Connecticut delegates,  forming an unusual trio, Dr. William Samuel Johnson, Roger Sherman, and  Oliver Ellsworth. These men were fearful of establishing too strong a  government and were at one time or another to be found in opposition to  Madison and his supporters. They were not mere obstructionists, however,  and while not constructive in the same way that Madison and Wilson  were, they must be given some credit for the form which the Constitution  finally assumed. Their greatest service was in restraining the tendency  of the majority to overrule the rights of States and in modifying the  desires of individuals for a government that would have been too strong  to work well in practice.    Alexander Hamilton of New York, as one of the ablest members of the  Convention, was expected to take an important part, but he was out of  touch with the views of the majority. He was aristocratic rather than  democratic and, however excellent his ideas may have been, they were too  radical for his fellow delegates and found but little support. He threw  his strength in favor of a strong government and was ready to aid the  movement in whatever way he could. But within his own delegation he was  outvoted by Robert Yates and John Lansing, and before the sessions were  half over he was deprived of a vote by the withdrawal of his colleagues.  Thereupon, finding himself of little service, he went to New York and  returned to Philadelphia only once or twice for a few days at a time,  and finally to sign the completed document. Luther Martin of Maryland  was an able lawyer and the Attorney-General of his State; but he was  supposed to be allied with undesirable interests, and it was said that  he had been sent to the Convention for the purpose of opposing a strong  government. He proved to be a tiresome speaker and his prosiness, when  added to the suspicion attaching to his motives, cost him much of the  influence which he might otherwise have had.    All in all, the delegates to the Federal Convention were a remarkable  body of men. Most of them had played important parts in the drama of  the Revolution; three-fourths of them had served in Congress, and  practically all were persons of note in their respective States and had  held important public positions. They may not have been the \"assembly of  demigods\" which Jefferson called them, for another contemporary insisted  \"that twenty assemblies of equal number might be collected equally  respectable both in point of ability, integrity, and patriotism.\"  Perhaps it would be safer to regard the Convention as a fairly  representative body, which was of a somewhat higher order than would  be gathered together today, because the social conditions of those  days tended to bring forward men of a better class, and because the  seriousness of the crisis had called out leaders of the highest type.    Two or three days were consumed in organizing the Convention--electing  officers, considering the delegates' credentials, and adopting rules of  procedure; and when these necessary preliminaries had been accomplished  the main business was opened with the presentation by the Virginia  delegation of a series of resolutions providing for radical changes  in the machinery of the Confederation. The principal features were the  organization of a legislature of two houses proportional to population  and with increased powers, the establishment of a separate executive,  and the creation of an independent judiciary. This was in reality  providing for a new government and was probably quite beyond the ideas  of most of the members of the Convention, who had come there under  instructions and with the expectation of revising the Articles of  Confederation. But after the Virginia Plan had been the subject of  discussion for two weeks so that the members had become a little more  accustomed to its proposals, and after minor modifications had been made  in the wording of the resolutions, the Convention was won over to its  support. To check this drift toward radical change the opposition headed  by New Jersey and Connecticut presented the so-called New Jersey  Plan, which was in sharp contrast to the Virginia Resolutions, for it  contemplated only a revision of the Articles of Confederation, but after  a relatively short discussion, the Virginia Plan was adopted by a vote  of seven States against four, with one State divided.    The dividing line between the two parties or groups in the Convention  had quickly manifested itself. It proved to be the same line that had  divided the Congress of the Confederation, the cleavage between the  large States and the small States. The large States were in favor  of representation in both houses of the legislature according to  population, while the small States were opposed to any change which  would deprive them of their equal vote in Congress, and though outvoted,  they were not ready to yield. The Virginia Plan, and subsequently the  New Jersey Plan, had first been considered in committee of the whole,  and the question of \"proportional representation,\" as it was then  called, would accordingly come up again in formal session. Several weeks  had been occupied by the proceedings, so that it was now near the end of  June, and in general the discussions had been conducted with remarkably  good temper. But it was evidently the calm before the storm. And the  issue was finally joined when the question of representation in the two  houses again came before the Convention. The majority of the States on  the 29th of June once more voted in favor of proportional representation  in the lower house. But on the question of the upper house, owing to a  peculiar combination of circumstances--the absence of one delegate and  another's change of vote causing the position of their respective States  to be reversed or nullified--the vote on the 2d of July resulted in a  tie. This brought the proceedings of the Convention to a standstill. A  committee of one member from each State was appointed to consider the  question, and, \"that time might be given to the Committee, and to  such as chose to attend to the celebration on the anniversary of  Independence, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3034"],[0,"The Anti-Slavery Crusade: A Chronicle of the Gathering Storm (#15)"],[1,"part of the owner. The  negro Sam had himself gone to a trader begging that he would buy him and  preferring to take his chances on a Mississippi plantation rather than  return to his master. The trader offered the customary price and was  met with the reply that he could have the rascal if he would wait until  after the enraged owner had taken his revenge, otherwise the price  would be twice the amount offered. A large proportion of the fugitives  belonged to this maltreated class. Others were goaded to escape by the  prospect of deportation to the Gulf States. The fugitives generally  followed the beaten line of travel to the North and West.    In 1826 Levi Coffin became a merchant in Newport, Indiana, a town near  the Ohio line not far from Richmond. In the town and in its neighborhood  lived a large number of free negroes who were the descendants of former  slaves whom North Carolina Quakers had set free and had colonized in the  new country. Coffin found that these blacks were accustomed to assist  fugitives on their way to Canada. When he also learnt that some had been  captured and returned to bondage merely through lack of skill on the  part of the negroes, he assumed active operations as a conductor on the  Underground Railroad.    Coffin used the Underground Railroad as a means of making converts to  the cause. One who berated him for negro-stealing was adroitly induced  to meet a newly arrived passenger and listen to his pathetic story. At  the psychological moment the objector was skillfully led to hand the  fugitive a dollar to assist him in reaching a place of safety. Coffin  then explained to this benevolent non-abolitionist the nature of his  act, assuring him that he was liable to heavy damages therefor. The  reply was in this case more forcible than elegant: \"Damn it! You've  got me!\" This conversion he publicly proclaimed for the sake of its  influence upon others. Many were the instances in which those of  supposed pro-slavery convictions were brought face to face with an  actual case of the threatened reenslavement of a human being escaping  from bondage and were, to their own surprise, overcome by the natural,  humane sentiment which asserted itself. For example, a Cincinnati  merchant, who at the time was supposed to be assisting one of his  Southern customers to recover an escaped fugitive, was confronted at  his own home by the poor half-starved victim. Yielding to the impulse of  compassion, he gave the slave food and personal assistance and directed  the destitute creature to a place of refuge.    The division in the Quaker meeting in Indiana with which Levi Coffin was  intimately associated may serve to exemplify a corresponding attitude  in other churches on the question of slavery. The Quakers availed  themselves of the first great anti-slavery movement to rid themselves  completely of the burden. Their Society itself became an anti-slavery  organization. Yet even so the Friends had differences of opinion as to  fit methods of action. Not only did many of them disapprove of rendering  aid to fugitives but they also objected to the use of the meetinghouses  for anti-slavery lectures. The formation of the Liberty party served to  accentuate the division. The great body of the Friends were anti-slavery  Whigs.    A crisis in the affairs of the Society of Friends in the State of  Indiana was reached in 1843 when the radicals seceded and organized an  independent \"Anti-Slavery Friends Society.\" Immediately there appeared  in numerous localities duplicate Friends' meeting-houses. In and around  one of these, distinguished as \"Liberty Hall,\" were gathered those whose  supreme religious interest was directed against the sin of slavery.  Never was there a church division which involved less bad blood or sense  of injury or injustice. Members of the same family attended separate  churches without the least difference in their cordial relations. No  important principle was involved; there were apparently good reasons  for both lines of policy, and each party understood and respected the  other's position. After the adoption of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850  and the passing of the Whig party, these differences disappeared, the  separate organization was disbanded, and all Friends' meetinghouses  became \"liberty halls.\"    The disposition to aid the fugitive was by no means confined to the  North nor to Quakers in the South. Richard Dillingham, a young Quaker  who had yielded to the solicitations of escaped fugitives in Cincinnati  and had undertaken a mission to Nashville, Tennessee, to rescue their  relatives from a \"hard master,\" was arrested with three stolen slaves  on his hands. He made confession in open court and frankly explained  his motives. The Nashville Daily Gazette of April 13, 1849, has words of  commendation for the prisoner and his family and states that \"he was not  without the sympathy of those who attended the trial.\" Though Dillingham  committed a crime to which the death penalty was attached in some of  the States, the jury affixed the minimum penalty of three years'  imprisonment for the offense. As Nashville was far removed from Quaker  influence or any sort of anti-slavery propaganda, Dillingham was himself  astonished and was profoundly grateful for the leniency shown him by  Court, jury, and prosecutors. This incident occurred in the year before  the adoption of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. It is well known that in  all times and places which were free from partizan bitterness there  was a general natural sympathy for those who imperiled their life and  liberty to free the slave. Throughout the South men of both races were  ready to give aid to slaves seeking to escape from dangers or burdens  which they regarded as intolerable. While such a man as Frederick  Douglass, when still a slave, was an agent of the Underground Railroad,  Southern anti-slavery people themselves were to a large extent the  original projectors of the movement. Even members of the families of  slaveholders have been known to assist fugitives in their escape to the  North.    The fugitives traveled in various ways which were determined partly by  geographical conditions and partly by the character of the inhabitants  of a region. On the Atlantic coast, from Florida to Delaware, slaves  were concealed in ships and were thus conveyed to free States. Thence  some made their way towards Canada by steamboat or railroad, though most  made the journey on foot or, less frequently, in private conveyances.  Stalwart slaves sometimes walked from the Gulf States to the free  States, traveling chiefly by night and guided by the North Star. Having  reached a free State, they found friends among those of their own race,  or were taken in hand by officers of the Underground Railroad and were  thus helped across the Canadian border.    From the seacoast the valley of the Connecticut River furnished a  convenient route for completing the journey northward, though the way of  the fugitives was often deflected to the Lake Champlain region. In later  years, when New England became generally sympathetic, numerous lines of  escape traversed that entire section. Other courses extended northward  from the vicinity of Philadelphia, Delaware, and Maryland. Here, through  the center of American Quakerdom, all conditions favored the escape  of fugitives, for slavery and freedom were at close quarters. The  activities of the Quakers, who were at first engaged merely in  preventing the reenslavement of those who had a legal right to freedom,  naturally expanded until aid was given without reservation to any  fugitive. From Philadelphia as a distributing point the route went by  way of New York and the Hudson River or up the river valleys of eastern  Pennsylvania through western New York.    In addition to the routes to freedom which the seacoast and river  valleys afforded, the Appalachian chain of mountains formed an  attractive highway of escape from slavery, though these mountain paths  lead us to another branch of our subject not immediately connected with  the Underground Railroad--the escape from bondage by the initiative of  the slaves themselves or by the aid of their own people. Mountains have  always been a refuge and a defense for the outlaw, and the few  dwellers in this almost unknown wilderness were not infrequently either  indifferent or friendly to the fugitives. The escaped slaves might, if  they chose, adopt for an indefinite time the free life of the hills;  but in most cases they naturally drifted northward for greater security  until they found themselves in a free State. Through the mountainous  regions of Virginia many thus escaped, and they were induced to remain  there by the example and advice of residents of their own color. The  negroes themselves excelled all others in furnishing places of refuge to  fugitives from slavery and in concealing their status. For this reason  John Brown and his associates were influenced to select this region for  their great venture in 1859.    But there were other than geographical conditions which helped to  determine the direction of the lines of the Underground Railroad. West  of the Alleghanies are the broad plains of the Mississippi Valley, and  in this great region human elements rather than physical characteristics  proved influential. Northern Ohio was occupied by settlers from the  East, many of whom were anti-slavery. Southern Ohio was populated  largely by Quakers and other people from the slave States who abhorred  slavery. On the east and south the State bordered on slave territory,  and every part of the region was traversed by lines of travel for the  slave. In eastern and northern Indiana a favorable attitude prevailed.  Southwestern Indiana, however, and southern Illinois were occupied by  those less friendly to the slave, so that in these sections there is  little evidence of systematic aid to fugitives. But with St. Louis,  Missouri, as a "]]]
