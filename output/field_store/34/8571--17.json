But he controlled himself by a strong effort.    \"How much of him's above ground?\" he asked.    \"(Adv.) little on'y his horns; or else I'd 'a' knowed him--Wub--back, Major,\"  replied Mosey reluctantly, as he chained his last pair.    Then, I grieve to say, Thompson let himself out.  No puerile repetition;  no slovenly, slipshod work there.  It was the performance of a born orator  and poet, and one who, like Timothy, had known the Scriptures  from a child--a long, involved litany of seething malediction, delivered,  moreover, with a measured and effortless eloquence and a grammatical exactitude  which left St.  Ernulphus a bad second.  The other fellows pursued their work  in awe-stricken silence, till at length Cooper, glancing toward  the ram-paddock, said deprecatingly:    \"--it, man, don't swear; not now, anyway.  I'll fetch these ten across,  an' they'll (adv.) soon snake him out.  Git that spare rope off o' my wagon,  an' foller me quick.\"    He brought his yoked bullocks through the gap, and drove them rapidly  to the spot indicated by Mosey.  Thompson mounted his horse and cantered after,  with the heavy coil of rope across the front of his saddle.  I accompanied him.  At the very extremity of the clump, and not fifty yards  from the house, was one of those bottomless quagmires too common in Riverina.  It was about twenty yards across; and, in the very centre,  Damper's head and the line of his back appeared above the surface;  the straight furrow behind him showing that he had been bogged at the edge,  but being unable to turn, and being exceedingly strong and sound,  had worked himself along to the middle, where he was slowly settling down.    In a couple of minutes, one end of the wool-rope--sixty feet long  and an inch and a-half in diameter--was looped round the roots  of the bullock's horns, and the team was attached to the fall.  Then a slow, steady strain drove Damper's nose into the ground,  and gently shifted him, first forward, then upward, then on to the surface,  where he slid smoothly to the solid ground.  We released him there,  and he staggered to his feet, shook himself thoroughly, and followed the team  to the camp, ravenously snatching mouthfuls of grass as he went along.    Price and Mosey had just got under way.  Willoughby was trying  to yoke Dixon's leaders, while Dixon, owing to his screwmatics,  could do nothing but sit on his horse, cursing with wearisome tautology,  and casting glances of frantic apprehension toward the ram-paddock.  His anxiety was not unreasonable, for there had just come into sight  an upright speck, too small to be a horseman; and it was easy to guess  who was the likeliest person to be coming on foot from that direction.  There is a limit to the dignified sufficiency even of a bullock driver;  and the unhappy conjecture of circumstances had driven Dixon past this point.    \"Stiddy, now; go stiddy, an' keep yer (adj.) mouth shut.  Now lay right (adv.) bang up to him; jam him agen the off-sider,  so's he can't shift.  There! block him! (Sheol)! Let him rip now.  O may the\" &c., &c    \"Dixon! Dixon! I must protest\"----    \"Purtest be (verbed).  Fetch 'em up agen.  Don't be frightened;  they 'on't bite.  Yoke on yer other (adj.) shoulder.  Right.  Git well up agen him this time.  Lay yer whole (adj.) weight on-to him,  an' jam him, so's he can't budge if it was to save his (adj.) life.\"    Willoughby, with the yoke on his shoulder, and the off-side bow in his hand,  gingerly approached the excited bullocks, essaying a light touch  on the near-sider's shrinking shoulder.  The next moment,  he was reeling backward, and both bullocks were gone.  Eve's curse on Cain,  in Byron's fine drama, is mere balderdash to what followed on Dixon's part.    \"Dem your soul, you uncultivated savage! you force me to inform you  that your helpless condition was my incentive to these well-meant efforts  on your behalf--as, begad! it is now the only consideration which restrains\"--    \"O, go to (sheol).  You're no (adj.) good.  You ain't fit  to (purvey offal to Bruin).  An' here's them (adj.) sneaks gone;  an' Martin he'll be on top o' me in about two (adj.) twos;  an' me left by my own (adj.) self, like a (adj.) natey cat in a (adj.) trap.  May the holy\" &c., &c.  \"If I'd that horse,\" he continued,  glancing furiously at Cleopatra, \"I'd make him smell (adj.  sheol).\"    \"Nonsense, Dixon,\" said I pleasantly; \"the horse is not annoying you.  Ah! Willoughby; Ne ultra-no, let's see--Ne sutor ultra crepidam.  Let me try my hand there.  I took my degree of B.D.--which doesn't always  signify Bachelor of Divinity--before you took your B.A.  Will you just bring up the unspeakables as Dixon points them out.\"    \"Palmam qui meruit ferat,\" responded Willoughby, instantly recovering  his temper.  \"Smoker--Nelson--dem your skins, come up once more!\"    Dixon's bullocks were exceptionally docile, for that uncultivated animal  was one of the most humane and skilful drivers in Riverina; therefore,  about twenty-five minutes sufficed to place his team in readiness for a start.    \"You might as well come along o' me for a change,\" said he to Willoughby.  \"We'll git on grand together.  I'm a quiet, agreeable sort o' (person),  though I say it myself; an' I would n't wish for better (adj.) company nor you.  Come on; you won't be sorry after.\"    \"Quocunque trahunt fata sequamur,\" rejoined Willoughby, bowing gaily to me.  Then taking up the whip--Dixon was a virtuoso in whips, and always carried one  with six feet of handle and twelve feet of lash--he aimed at the team,  collectively, a clip which, in the most literal sense, recoiled on himself.  And so the officer's son and the sojer's son took their way together;  to become, as I afterward learned, the most attached and mutually considerate  friends on the track.  Such is life.    Thompson and Cooper, now ready for the road, were repairing the fence  as well as they could.  This being done, and the relics of the fire  kicked about, they put their teams in motion, leaving little trace of the camp,  except Bum's mare, standing asleep outside the fence.  The ominous speck  on the plain had approached much nearer, but had taken definite form  as an emu; and now the negative blessing of escape seemed like  a positive benefaction.  \"If,\" says Carlyle, \"thou wert condemned  to be hanged--which is probably less than thou deservest--thou wouldest  esteem it happiness to be shot.\"    Serene gratitude therefore shone in the frank faces of the outlaws;  tempered, however, in Thompson's case, by salutary remorse,  for his companion had reproachfully asked him what the (adj.  sheol) good  his swearing had done.    We could see Price's teams stopped, half a mile away; one of the loads  appearing low, and canted over to the off side; bogged, evidently.  Dixon's wagon was close in front of us; Willoughby was zealously  flogging himself, and occasionally we could hear Dixon's voice  in encouragement and counsel.    The place where Price's wagon was stuck was not a creek, but merely  a narrow belt of treacherous ground.  Mosey had n't gone down six inches,  but Price had happened on a bad place, and his wagon had found the bottom.  All Mosey's team, except the polers, had been hooked on,  but with no result beyond the breaking of a well-worn chain.    \"Ain't got puddin' enough, Thompson,\" said Mosey, as my companions  stopped their teams and went on to survey the place.  \"The (adv.) thunderin'  ole morepoke he goes crawlin' into the rottenest place he could fine.  You shove your team in nex' the polers, an' I'll hook our lot on in front.  Your chains'll stan' to fetch (sheol) out by the (adj.) roots.  Please the pigs, we'll git out o' sight afore that ole (overseer) comes.\"    Thompson did as desired; and the first pull brought the wagon  on to solid ground.  Meanwhile Dixon and Willoughby had taken their team  through, and were hurrying along.  Cooper, growling maledictions  on everything connected with Port Phillip--roads in particular--  had selected his route, and started his team.  Thompson hooked on  to his own wagon, and crossed safely, but with very little to spare.    \"Touch-and-go,\" he remarked to me; \"another bale would have anchored her.  Ah! Cooper's in it, with all his cleverness.\"    Cooper was in it.  The two-ton Hawkesbury, with seven-and-a-half tons of load,  was down to the axle-beds; and the Cornstalk was endeavouring,  by means of extracts from the sermons of Knox's soundest followers, to do  something like justice to the contingency.  Thompson sighed, glanced toward  the ram-paddock, and hooked his team in front of Cooper's.  Mosey,  who had been mending his broken chain with wire, now came over with Price.    \"We'll give you a lend of our whips,\" said he with cheap complaisance.  \"Take the leaders yerself, Thompson.  Stiddy now, till I give the word,  or we'll be fetching the (adj.) handle out of her.  Now--pop it on--to 'em!\"    Then thirty-six picked bullocks planted their feet and prised,  and a hundred and seventy feet of bar chain stretched tense and rigid  from the leaders' yoke to the pole-cap.  The wagon crept forward.  A low grumble, more a growl than a bellow, passed from beast to beast  along the team--sure indication that the wagon would n't stop again  if it could be taken through.  The off front wheel rose slowly  on harder ground; the off hind wheel rose in its turn; both near wheels  ploughed deeper beneath the top-heavy weight of thirty-eight bales----    \"She's over!\" thundered Cooper.  \"Keep her goin'--it's her on'y chance!\"    Then the heavy pine whipsticks bent like bulrushes in the drivers'  skilful hands, while a spray of dissevered hair, and sometimes a line  of springing blood, followed each detonation--the libretto being in keeping.  A few yards forward still, while both off wheels rose to the surface,  and both near wheels sank till the naves burrowed in the ground;  then the wagon "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34736"],[0,"True Christianity (#15)"],[1,"and noble.    6. This yoke of Christ is the real cross, which when a man bears he truly  dies to the world. It is not to retire into monasteries and cloisters, nor  to adopt a set of rules and orders for the regulation of life; for while  the heart remains disordered, and the love corrupt; while the man is  puffed up with spiritual pride, and a pharisaical contempt of others;  while he is devoted to lust, envy, hypocrisy, secret hatred and malice; he  does not die to the world, but altogether lives to it. This is not the  Christian yoke nor is it the cross of Christ; for these consist in  mortifying the flesh, with its sinful propensities; in turning away from  the world to God; in an inward and constant secret sorrow for our sins; in  a daily dying to the world, and living to Christ by faith; in following  his steps with sincere lowliness and humility; and in confiding only in  the grace of God in Christ Jesus.    7. To this unfeigned repentance, this true and inward conversion from the  world unto God, hath our blessed Lord called us. The imputation of his  righteousness and obedience, together with the remission of all our sins,  apprehended by faith, is promised to it alone. If we are destitute of  repentance, Christ profiteth us nothing; that is, we cannot then become  partakers of his grace and favor, nor of the efficacy of his merits;  because these can be applied only by a contrite, penitent, lowly, and  believing heart. And truly this is the fruit of the passion of Christ in  us, that we die to sin by a sincere repentance; as the fruit of his  resurrection is, that Christ may live in us, and we in him.    8. All this is necessary to render man that _new creature_ in Christ  Jesus, without which nothing availeth in the sight of God. 2 Cor. 5:17;  Gal. 6:15.    9. Hence, therefore, let us be instructed in the nature of true  repentance; lest we be led away into that common error, that the mere  relinquishment of some gross enormity, as theft, fornication, profaneness,  blasphemy, is the genuine and only repentance. It is certain, that this is  a kind of _external_ repentance; but it is no less so, that all the  Scriptures alike inculcate the necessity of an _inward_ repentance, which  takes possession of the whole soul. A man under the influence of this  repentance, not only supports a fair conversation in the world, but he  also denies and hates himself. Renouncing the world and all he calls his  own, and crucifying the flesh, he commits himself by faith to God alone;  and offers up to him a broken and contrite heart, as the sacrifice most  acceptable in his sight. This character of inward repentance is eminently  set forth in the Psalms of David, and particularly in those termed  Penitential.(4)    10. This is, therefore, the only true repentance, when the heart of the  sinner is inwardly torn with grief, and weighed down by heaviness; and  when, on the other hand, it is healed by faith and the remission of sin,  quickened by the infusion of divine joy, provoked to good works, and  thoroughly transformed and changed. Such a frame of mind cannot fail to be  attended also with an _external_ reformation of life and manners.    11. But, on the other hand, though a man be very serious in the  performance of bodily penances, and, from a dread of punishment, abstain  from the commission of notorious sins; yet if he continue unreformed and  unregenerate in his heart, and enter not upon that new and inward life  which it has been our object to describe, he will prove but a _castaway_  (1 Cor. 9:27) at last, notwithstanding the whole train of his external  acts. It will avail him nothing to cry, \"Lord, Lord!\" He will hear the  tremendous declaration, \"I never knew you!\" For most certain it is, that  not every one that saith, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of  heaven, but those only who do the will of their Heavenly Father. Matt.  7:21-23. And under this awful sentence of divine majesty, all men are  comprised, of what rank or order so-ever, who do not truly and inwardly  repent, and who are not new creatures in Christ, for \"if any man have not  the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.\" Rom. 8:9.          Chapter V.                           Wherein Does True Faith Consist?          _Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God._--1      JOHN 5:1.      Faith is a sincere confidence, and a firm persuasion of the grace of God  promised to us in Christ Jesus, for the remission of sin and eternal life;  and it is enkindled in the heart, by the word of God and the Holy Spirit.  Through this faith we obtain the forgiveness of our sins, without any  merits of our own, of mere grace (Eph. 2:8), and for the sake of the  merits of Christ alone; that so, our faith might rest on a firm and solid  foundation, and remain unmoved by perplexity and doubts. This forgiveness  of sin constitutes our justification before God, which is true, solid, and  eternal; for this righteousness is purchased neither by men nor angels,  but by the obedience, merit, and the blood of the Son of God himself. We  appropriate and apply it to ourselves by faith; and hence the  imperfections which still adhere to us cannot condemn us, since, for the  sake of Christ, who now lives and works within us, they are covered with a  veil of grace. Ps. 32:1.    2. By this cordial and unshaken faith, man wholly dedicates his heart to  the Almighty, in whom alone he seeks his rest. To him only is he now  united, and with him alone he enters into delightful fellowship. He  partakes of all things that are of God and of Christ, and is made one  spirit with the Lord. From him he receives divine power and strength;  together with a new life, attended with new joys, new pleasures, new  consolations, in which are found peace, inward ease, and durable  satisfaction, together with righteousness and holiness. And thus man is  born anew of God by faith. For wherever there is true faith, _there_  Christ is verily present with all his righteousness, holiness, and  remission of sin; with all his merits, justification, grace, adoption, and  inheritance of eternal life. This is the new birth and the new creature,  springing from faith in Christ. Hence, the apostle calls faith a  _substance_ (Heb. 11:1); understanding by it, a sure, solid, and unshaken  confidence in \"things hoped for,\" and a lively conviction of \"things not  seen.\" For the consolation conveyed by a vital faith is so powerful, as to  convince the heart of the divine truth by inward experience, and by the  tasting of the heavenly goodness in the soul, and of the peace of God,  that passes all understanding; yea, it is so mighty as to enable its  possessors to die with a joyful heart. In this consist that strength of  the spirit, that might of the inner man, that vigor of faith, that holy  boldness; this is that confidence toward God, that exceeding and abounding  assurance, which are so copiously set forth by the holy apostles. 2 Tim.  2:1; Eph. 3:12, 16; Phil. 1:14; 1 John 3:21; 1 Thess. 1:5; 2:2.    3. That for which a man will dare to die, must be rooted in the soul, and,  by the operation of the Spirit of God, afford an inward assurance. It must  be a cordial, powerful, and eternal comfort, infusing heavenly and  supernatural strength into the soul, by which the fear of death and the  love of the world may both be subdued. Now all this begets so solid a  trust in Christ, and so close a union with him, as neither death nor life  is able to dissolve. Rom. 8:38; 2 Tim. 1:12. Hence St. John says:  \"Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world.\" 1 John 5:4.    4. _To be born of God_ is in truth no vain figure, no empty name; it must  necessarily be a lively and powerful change, worthy of the majesty of an  omnipotent God. To believe that the living God could beget a dead  offspring, that lifeless members and useless organs could proceed from  him, were very wickedness. It is sure and undoubted that God, being a  _living_ God, cannot but beget a _living_ man, even the new man in Christ  Jesus. And our faith is the victory which overcomes the world. 1 John 5:4.  Who can question whether it be endued with strength sufficient for the  conquest? It is, it _must be_ a lively, vigorous, potent, divine, and  victorious principle; but all its power is derived from him who is  embraced by it, even Christ. By means of faith, we return into God again,  and become one with him; and from Adam, as from an accursed vine, we are  transplanted into Christ, the living and blessed vine. John 15:4. In  Christ, we possess everything that is good, and in him, are justified.    5. As a scion, when grafted on a good tree, grows, flourishes, and bears  fruit, but, without it, withers away; so man, when out of Christ, is as an  accursed vine, whose grapes are bitterness and gall; and all his works are  sin. Deut. 32:32, 33; Rom. 14:23. But when he is _in_ Christ, he is  righteous and blessed; because \"_he_ was made to be sin for us, who knew  no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.\" 2 Cor.  5:21.    6. It is most evident, from what has been advanced, that works cannot  possibly justify a sinner; because, before we can perform any good work,  we must be engrafted into Christ by faith: and it is equally clear, that  justification is entirely the gift of God, freely conferred on man and  preceding all human merit. How shall a dead man see, hear, stand, walk, or  do any good thing, unless he be first raised from the dead, and endued  with a new principle of life? So neither canst thou, O man, who art dead  in sins, do any work that is good or acceptable, unless thou be first  raised unto life by Jesus Christ. Thus righteousness proceeds only from  faith in Christ. Faith is like a new-born babe, weak and naked, poor and  destitute, and laid before the eyes of the Saviour; from whom, as from its  author, it receives righteousness and sanctification, godliness, grace and  the Holy Ghost.
