We comprehend our own existence by inward feeling  or reflexion, and that of other spirits by reason. We may be said to have  some knowledge or notion of our own minds, of spirits and active beings,  whereof in a strict sense we have not ideas. In like manner, we know and  have a notion of relations between things or ideas--which relations are  distinct from the ideas or things related, inasmuch as the latter may be  perceived by us without our perceiving the former. To me it seems that  ideas, spirits, and relations are all in their respective kinds the  object of human knowledge and subject of discourse; and that the term  idea would be improperly extended to signify everything we know or have  any notion of.    90. EXTERNAL THINGS EITHER IMPRINTED BY OR PERCEIVED BY SOME OTHER  MIND.--Ideas imprinted on the senses are real things, or do really exist;  this we do not deny, but we deny they can subsist without the minds which  perceive them, or that they are resemblances of any archetypes existing  without the mind; since the very being of a sensation or idea consists in  being perceived, and an idea can be like nothing but an idea. Again, the  things perceived by sense may be termed external, with regard to their  origin--in that they are not generated from within by the mind itself,  but imprinted by a Spirit distinct from that which perceives them.  Sensible objects may likewise be said to be \"without the mind\" in another  sense, namely when they exist in some other mind; thus, when I shut my  eyes, the things I saw may still exist, but it must be in another mind.    91. SENSIBLE QUALITIES REAL.--It were a mistake to think that what  is here said derogates in the least from the reality of things.  It is acknowledged, on the received principles, that extension,  motion, and in a word all sensible qualities have need of a support,  as not being able to subsist by themselves. But the objects perceived  by sense are allowed to be nothing but combinations of those qualities,  and consequently cannot subsist by themselves. Thus far it is agreed  on all hand. So that in denying the things perceived by sense an  existence independent of a substance of support wherein they may  exist, we detract nothing from the received opinion of their reality, and  are guilty of no innovation in that respect. All the difference is that,  according to us, the unthinking beings perceived by sense have no  existence distinct from being perceived, and cannot therefore exist in  any other substance than those unextended indivisible substances or  spirits which act and think and perceive them; whereas philosophers  vulgarly hold that the sensible qualities do exist in an inert, extended,  unperceiving substance which they call Matter, to which they attribute a  natural subsistence, exterior to all thinking beings, or distinct from  being perceived by any mind whatsoever, even the eternal mind of the  Creator, wherein they suppose only ideas of the corporeal substances  created by him; if indeed they allow them to be at all created.    92. OBJECTIONS OF ATHEISTS OVERTURNED.--For, as we have shown the  doctrine of Matter or corporeal substance to have been the main  pillar and support of Scepticism, so likewise upon the same foundation  have been raised all the impious schemes of Atheism and Irreligion.  Nay, so great a difficulty has it been thought to conceive Matter  produced out of nothing, that the most celebrated among the ancient  philosophers, even of those who maintained the being of a God,  have thought Matter to be uncreated and co-eternal with Him. How  great a friend material substance has been to Atheists in all ages were  needless to relate. All their monstrous systems have so visible and  necessary a dependence on it that, when this corner-stone is once  removed, the whole fabric cannot choose but fall to the ground, insomuch  that it is no longer worth while to bestow a particular consideration on  the absurdities of every wretched sect of Atheists.    93. AND OF FATALISTS ALSO.--That impious and profane persons should  readily fall in with those systems which favour their inclinations,  by deriding immaterial substance, and supposing the soul to be  divisible and subject to corruption as the body; which exclude all  freedom, intelligence, and design from the formation of things,  and instead thereof make a self--existent, stupid, unthinking  substance the root and origin of all beings; that they should  hearken to those who deny a Providence, or inspection of a Superior  Mind over the affairs of the world, attributing the whole series  of events either to blind chance or fatal necessity arising from  the impulse of one body or another--all this is very natural. And,  on the other hand, when men of better principles observe the enemies  of religion lay so great a stress on unthinking Matter, and all  of them use so much industry and artifice to reduce everything to it,  methinks they should rejoice to see them deprived of their grand support,  and driven from that only fortress, without which your Epicureans,  Hobbists, and the like, have not even the shadow of a pretence, but  become the most cheap and easy triumph in the world.    94. OF IDOLATORS.--The existence of Matter, or bodies unperceived,  has not only been the main support of Atheists and Fatalists,  but on the same principle doth Idolatry likewise in all its various  forms depend. Did men but consider that the sun, moon, and stars,  and every other object of the senses are only so many sensations  in their minds, which have no other existence but barely being  perceived, doubtless they would never fall down and worship their  own ideas, but rather address their homage to that ETERNAL INVISIBLE MIND  which produces and sustains all things.    95. AND SOCINIANS.--The same absurd principle, by mingling itself with  the articles of our faith, has occasioned no small difficulties to  Christians. For example, about the Resurrection, how many scruples and  objections have been raised by Socinians and others? But do not the  most plausible of them depend on the supposition that a body is  denominated the same, with regard not to the form or that which is  perceived by sense, but the material substance, which remains the  same under several forms? Take away this material substance, about  the identity whereof all the dispute is, and mean by body what every  plain ordinary person means by that word, to wit, that which is  immediately seen and felt, which is only a combination of sensible  qualities or ideas, and then their most unanswerable objections  come to nothing.    96. SUMMARY OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF EXPELLING MATTER.--Matter being once  expelled out of nature drags with it so many sceptical and impious  notions, such an incredible number of disputes and puzzling questions,  which have been thorns in the sides of divines as well as philosophers,  and made so much fruitless work for mankind, that if the arguments  we have produced against it are not found equal to demonstration  (as to me they evidently seem), yet I am sure all friends to knowledge,  peace, and religion have reason to wish they were.    97. Beside the external existence of the objects of perception, another  great source of errors and difficulties with regard to ideal knowledge is  the doctrine of abstract ideas, such as it has been set forth in the  Introduction. The plainest things in the world, those we are most  intimately acquainted with and perfectly know, when they are considered  in an abstract way, appear strangely difficult and incomprehensible.  Time, place, and motion, taken in particular or concrete, are what  everybody knows, but, having passed through the hands of a metaphysician,  they become too abstract and fine to be apprehended by men of ordinary  sense. Bid your servant meet you at such a time in such a place, and he  shall never stay to deliberate on the meaning of those words; in  conceiving that particular time and place, or the motion by which he is  to get thither, he finds not the least difficulty. But if time be taken  exclusive of all those particular actions and ideas that diversify the  day, merely for the continuation of existence or duration in abstract,  then it will perhaps gravel even a philosopher to comprehend it.    98. DILEMMA.--For my own part, whenever I attempt to frame a simple idea  of time, abstracted from the succession of ideas in my mind, which flows  uniformly and is participated by all beings, I am lost and embrangled in  inextricable difficulties. I have no notion of it at all, only I hear  others say it is infinitely divisible, and speak of it in such a manner  as leads me to entertain odd thoughts of my existence; since that  doctrine lays one under an absolute necessity of thinking, either that he  passes away innumerable ages without a thought, or else that he is  annihilated every moment of his life, both which seem equally absurd.  Time therefore being nothing, abstracted from the sucession of ideas in  our minds, it follows that the duration of any finite spirit must be  estimated by the number of ideas or actions succeeding each other in that  same spirit or mind. Hence, it is a plain consequence that the soul  always thinks; and in truth whoever shall go about to divide in his  thoughts, or abstract the existence of a spirit from its cogitation,  will, I believe, find it no easy task.    99. So likewise when we attempt to abstract extension and motion from all  other qualities, and consider them by themselves, we presently lose sight  of them, and run into great extravagances. All which depend on a twofold  abstraction; first, it is supposed that extension, for example, may be  abstracted from all other sensible qualities; and secondly, that the  entity of extension may"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4724"],[0,"Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous in Opposition to Sceptics and (#15)"],[1,"is another.    PHIL.  _I_ am content, Hylas, to appeal to the common sense of the world  for the truth of my notion. Ask the gardener why he thinks yonder  cherry-tree exists in the garden, and he shall tell you, because he sees  and feels it; in a word, because he perceives it by his senses. Ask him  why he thinks an orange-tree not to be there, and he shall tell you,  because he does not perceive it. What he perceives by sense, that he  terms a real, being, and saith it IS OR EXISTS; but, that which is not  perceivable, the same, he saith, hath no being.    HYL.  Yes, Philonous, I grant the existence of a sensible thing consists  in being perceivable, but not in being actually perceived.    PHIL.  And what is perceivable but an idea? And can an idea exist  without being actually perceived? These are points long since agreed  between us.    HYL.  But, be your opinion never so true, yet surely you will not deny  it is shocking, and contrary to the common sense of men. Ask the  fellow whether yonder tree hath an existence out of his mind: what answer  think you he would make?    PHIL.  The same that I should myself, to wit, that it doth exist out of  his mind. But then to a Christian it cannot surely be shocking to say,  the real tree, existing without his mind, is truly known and comprehended  by (that is EXISTS IN) the infinite mind of God. Probably he may not at  first glance be aware of the direct and immediate proof there is of this;  inasmuch as the very being of a tree, or any other sensible thing,  implies a mind wherein it is. But the point itself he cannot deny. The  question between the Materialists and me is not, whether things have a  REAL existence out of the mind of this or that person, but whether they  have an ABSOLUTE existence, distinct from being perceived by God, and  exterior to all minds. This indeed some heathens and philosophers have  affirmed, but whoever entertains notions of the Deity suitable to the  Holy Scriptures will be of another opinion.    HYL.  But, according to your notions, what difference is there between  real things, and chimeras formed by the imagination, or the visions of a  dream--since they are all equally in the mind?    PHIL.  The ideas formed by the imagination are faint and indistinct;  they have, besides, an entire dependence on the will. But the ideas  perceived by sense, that is, real things, are more vivid and clear; and,  being imprinted on the mind by a spirit distinct from us, have not the  like dependence on our will. There is therefore no danger of confounding  these with the foregoing: and there is as little of confounding them with  the visions of a dream, which are dim, irregular, and confused. And,  though they should happen to be never so lively and natural, yet, by  their not being connected, and of a piece with the preceding and  subsequent transactions of our lives, they might easily be distinguished  from realities. In short, by whatever method you distinguish THINGS FROM  CHIMERAS on your scheme, the same, it is evident, will hold also upon  mine. For, it must be, I presume, by some perceived difference; and I am  not for depriving you of any one thing that you perceive.    HYL.  But still, Philonous, you hold, there is nothing in the world but  spirits and ideas. And this, you must needs acknowledge, sounds very  oddly.    PHIL.  I own the word IDEA, not being commonly used for THING,  sounds something out of the way. My reason for using it was, because a  necessary relation to the mind is understood to be implied by that  term; and it is now commonly used by philosophers to denote the immediate  objects of the understanding. But, however oddly the proposition may  sound in words, yet it includes nothing so very strange or shocking in  its sense; which in effect amounts to no more than this, to wit, that  there are only things perceiving, and things perceived; or that every  unthinking being is necessarily, and from the very nature of its  existence, perceived by some mind; if not by a finite created mind, yet  certainly by the infinite mind of God, in whom \"we five, and move, and  have our being.\" Is this as strange as to say, the sensible qualities are  not on the objects: or that we cannot be sure of the existence of things,  or know any thing of their real natures--though we both see and feel  them, and perceive them by all our senses?    HYL.  And, in consequence of this, must we not think there are no such  things as physical or corporeal causes; but that a Spirit is the  immediate cause of all the phenomena in nature? Can there be anything  more extravagant than this?    PHIL.  Yes, it is infinitely more extravagant to say--a thing which is  inert operates on the mind, and which is unperceiving is the cause of our  perceptions, without any regard either to consistency, or the old known  axiom, NOTHING CAN GIVE TO ANOTHER THAT WHICH IT HATH NOT ITSELF.  Besides, that which to you, I know not for what reason, seems so  extravagant is no more than the Holy Scriptures assert in a hundred  places. In them God is represented as the sole and immediate Author of  all those effects which some heathens and philosophers are wont to  ascribe to Nature, Matter, Fate, or the like unthinking principle. This  is so much the constant language of Scripture that it were needless to  confirm it by citations.    HYL.  You are not aware, Philonous, that in making God the immediate  Author of all the motions in nature, you make Him the Author of murder,  sacrilege, adultery, and the like heinous sins.    PHIL.  In answer to that, I observe, first, that the imputation of guilt  is the same, whether a person commits an action with or without an  instrument. In case therefore you suppose God to act by the mediation of  an instrument or occasion, called MATTER, you as truly make Him the  author of sin as I, who think Him the immediate agent in all those  operations vulgarly ascribed to Nature. I farther observe that sin or  moral turpitude doth not consist in the outward physical action or  motion, but in the internal deviation of the will from the laws of reason  and religion. This is plain, in that the killing an enemy in a battle, or  putting a criminal legally to death, is not thought sinful; though the  outward act be the very same with that in the case of murder. Since,  therefore, sin doth not consist in the physical action, the making God an  immediate cause of all such actions is not making Him the Author of sin.  Lastly, I have nowhere said that God is the only agent who produces all  the motions in bodies. It is true I have denied there are any other  agents besides spirits; but this is very consistent with allowing to  thinking rational beings, in the production of motions, the use of  limited powers, ultimately indeed derived from God, but immediately under  the direction of their own wills, which is sufficient to entitle them to  all the guilt of their actions.    HYL.  But the denying Matter, Philonous, or corporeal Substance; there  is the point. You can never persuade me that this is not repugnant to the  universal sense of mankind. Were our dispute to be determined by most  voices, I am confident you would give up the point, without gathering the  votes.    PHIL.  I wish both our opinions were fairly stated and submitted to the  judgment of men who had plain common sense, without the prejudices of a  learned education. Let me be represented as one who trusts his senses,  who thinks he knows the things he sees and feels, and entertains no  doubts of their existence; and you fairly set forth with all your doubts,  your paradoxes, and your scepticism about you, and I shall willingly  acquiesce in the determination of any indifferent person. That there is  no substance wherein ideas can exist beside spirit is to me evident. And  that the objects immediately perceived are ideas, is on all hands agreed.  And that sensible qualities are objects immediately perceived no one can  deny. It is therefore evident there can be no SUBSTRATUM of those  qualities but spirit; in which they exist, not by way of mode or  property, but as a thing perceived in that which perceives it. I deny  therefore that there is ANY UNTHINKING-SUBSTRATUM of the objects of  sense, and IN THAT ACCEPTATION that there is any material substance.  But if by MATERIAL SUBSTANCE is meant only SENSIBLE BODY, THAT  which is seen and felt (and the unphilosophical part of the world, I dare  say, mean no more)--then I am more certain of matter's existence than you  or any other philosopher pretend to be. If there be anything which makes  the generality of mankind averse from the notions I espouse, it is  a misapprehension that I deny the reality of sensible things. But, as it  is you who are guilty of that, and not I, it follows that in truth their  aversion is against your notions and not mine. I do therefore assert that  I am as certain as of my own being, that there are bodies or corporeal  substances (meaning the things I perceive by my senses); and that,  granting this, the bulk of mankind will take no thought about, nor think  themselves at all concerned in the fate of those unknown natures, and  philosophical quiddities, which some men are so fond of.    HYL.  What say you to this? Since, according to you, men judge of the  reality of things by their senses, how can a man be mistaken in thinking  the moon a plain lucid surface, about a foot in diameter; or a square  tower, seen at a distance, round; or an oar, with one end in the water,  crooked?    PHIL.  He is not mistaken with regard to the ideas he actually  perceives, but in the inference he makes from his present perceptions.  Thus, in the case of the oar, what he immediately perceives by sight is  certainly crooked; and so far he is in the right. But if he thence  conclude that upon taking the oar out of the water he shall perceive the  same crookedness; or that it would affect his touch as crooked things are  wont to do:"]]]
