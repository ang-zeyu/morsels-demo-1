M. W.  Turner. But there are sometimes more valuable lessons to be learned in  the school of nature than in that of Vitruvius, and a fragment of  building among the Alps is singularly illustrative of the chief feature  which I have at present to develope as necessary to the perfection of  the wall veil.    It is a fragment of some size; a group of broken walls, one of them  overhanging; crowned with a cornice, nodding some hundred and fifty feet  over its massy flank, three thousand above its glacier base, and  fourteen thousand above the sea,--a wall truly of some majesty, at once  the most precipitous and the strongest mass in the whole chain of the  Alps, the Mont Cervin.    Sec. II. It has been falsely represented as a peak or tower. It is a vast  ridged promontory, connected at its western root with the Dent d'Erin,  and lifting itself like a rearing horse with its face to the east. All  the way along the flank of it, for half a day's journey on the Zmutt  glacier, the grim black terraces of its foundations range almost without  a break; and the clouds, when their day's work is done, and they are  weary, lay themselves down on those foundation steps, and rest till  dawn, each with his leagues of grey mantle stretched along the grisly  ledge, and the cornice of the mighty wall gleaming in the moonlight,  three thousand feet above.    Sec. III. The eastern face of the promontory is hewn down, as if by the  single sweep of a sword, from the crest of it to the base; hewn concave  and smooth, like the hollow of a wave: on each flank of it there is set  a buttress, both of about equal height, their heads sloped out from the  main wall about seven hundred feet below its summit. That on the north  is the most important; it is as sharp as the frontal angle of a bastion,  and sloped sheer away to the north-east, throwing out spur beyond spur,  until it terminates in a long low curve of russet precipice, at whose  foot a great bay of the glacier of the Col de Cervin lies as level as a  lake. This spur is one of the few points from which the mass of the Mont  Cervin is in anywise approachable. It is a continuation of the masonry  of the mountain itself, and affords us the means of examining the  character of its materials.    Sec. IV. Few architects would like to build with them. The slope of the  rocks to the north-west is covered two feet deep with their ruins, a  mass of loose and slaty shale, of a dull brick-red color, which yields  beneath the foot like ashes, so that, in running down, you step one  yard, and slide three. The rock is indeed hard beneath, but still  disposed in thin courses of these cloven shales, so finely laid that  they look in places more like a heap of crushed autumn leaves than a  rock; and the first sensation is one of unmitigated surprise, as if the  mountain were upheld by miracle; but surprise becomes more intelligent  reverence for the great builder, when we find, in the middle of the mass  of these dead leaves, a course of living rock, of quartz as white as the  snow that encircles it, and harder than a bed of steel.    Sec. V. It is one only of a thousand iron bands that knit the strength  of the mighty mountain. Through the buttress and the wall alike, the  courses of its varied masonry are seen in their successive order, smooth  and true as if laid by line and plummet,[34] but of thickness and  strength continually varying, and with silver cornices glittering along  the edge of each, laid by the snowy winds and carved by the  sunshine,--stainless ornaments of the eternal temple, by which \"neither  the hammer nor the axe, nor any tool, was heard while it was in  building.\"    Sec. VI. I do not, however, bring this forward as an instance of any  universal law of natural building; there are solid as well as coursed  masses of precipice, but it is somewhat curious that the most noble  cliff in Europe, which this eastern front of the Cervin is, I believe,  without dispute, should be to us an example of the utmost possible  stability of precipitousness attained with materials of imperfect and  variable character; and, what is more, there are very few cliffs which  do not display alternations between compact and friable conditions of  their material, marked in their contours by bevelled slopes when the  bricks are soft, and vertical steps when they are harder. And, although  we are not hence to conclude that it is well to introduce courses of bad  materials when we can get perfect material, I believe we may conclude  with great certainty that it is better and easier to strengthen a wall  necessarily of imperfect substance, as of brick, by introducing  carefully laid courses of stone, than by adding to its thickness; and  the first impression we receive from the unbroken aspect of a wall veil,  unless it be of hewn stone throughout, is that it must be both thicker  and weaker than it would have been, had it been properly coursed. The  decorative reasons for adopting the coursed arrangement, which we shall  notice hereafter, are so weighty, that they would alone be almost  sufficient to enforce it; and the constructive ones will apply  universally, except in the rare cases in which the choice of perfect or  imperfect material is entirely open to us, or where the general system  of the decoration of the building requires absolute unity in its  surface.    [Illustration: Fig. III.]    Sec. VII. As regards the arrangement of the intermediate parts themselves,  it is regulated by certain conditions of bonding and fitting the stones  or bricks, which the reader need hardly be troubled to consider, and  which I wish that bricklayers themselves were always honest enough to  observe. But I hardly know whether to note under the head of aesthetic  or constructive law, this important principle, that masonry is always  bad which appears to have arrested the attention of the architect more  than absolute conditions of strength require. Nothing is more  contemptible in any work than an appearance of the slightest desire on  the part of the builder to _direct attention_ to the way its stones are  put together, or of any trouble taken either to show or to conceal it  more than was rigidly necessary: it may sometimes, on the one hand, be  necessary to conceal it as far as may be, by delicate and close fitting,  when the joints would interfere with lines of sculpture or of mouldings;  and it may often, on the other hand, be delightful to show it, as it is  delightful in places to show the anatomy even of the most delicate human  frame: but _studiously_ to conceal it is the error of vulgar painters,  who are afraid to show that their figures have bones; and studiously to  display it is the error of the base pupils of Michael Angelo, who turned  heroes' limbs into surgeons' diagrams,--but with less excuse than  theirs, for there is less interest in the anatomy displayed. Exhibited  masonry is in most cases the expedient of architects who do not know how  to fill up blank spaces, and many a building, which would have been  decent enough if let alone, has been scrawled over with straight lines,  as in Fig. III., on exactly the same principles, and with just the same  amount of intelligence as a boy's in scrawling his copy-book when he  cannot write. The device was thought ingenious at one period of  architectural history; St. Paul's and Whitehall are covered with it, and  it is in this I imagine that some of our modern architects suppose the  great merit of those buildings to consist. There is, however, no excuse  for errors in disposition of masonry, for there is but one law upon the  subject, and that easily complied with, to avoid all affectation and  all unnecessary expense, either in showing or concealing. Every one  knows a building is built of separate stones; nobody will ever object to  seeing that it is so, but nobody wants to count them. The divisions of a  church are much like the divisions of a sermon; they are always right so  long as they are necessary to edification, and always wrong when they  are thrust upon the attention as divisions only. There may be neatness  in carving when there is richness in feasting; but I have heard many a  discourse, and seen many a church wall, in which it was all carving and  no meat.

We have lastly to consider the close of the wall's existence, or  its cornice. It was above stated, that a cornice has one of two offices:  if the wall have nothing to carry, the cornice is its roof, and defends  it from the weather; if there is weight to be carried above the wall,  the cornice is its hand, and is expanded to carry the said weight.    There are several ways of roofing or protecting independent walls,  according to the means nearest at hand: sometimes the wall has a true  roof all to itself; sometimes it terminates in a small gabled ridge,  made of bricks set slanting, as constantly in the suburbs of London; or  of hewn stone, in stronger work; or in a single sloping face, inclined  to the outside. We need not trouble ourselves at present about these  small roofings, which are merely the diminutions of large ones; but we  must examine the important and constant member of the wall structure,  which prepares it either for these small roofs or for weights above, and  is its true cornice.    Sec. II. The reader will, perhaps, as heretofore, be kind enough to think  for himself, how, having carried up his wall veil as high as it may be  needed, he will set about protecting it from weather, or preparing it  for weight. Let him imagine the top of the unfinished wall, as it would  be seen from above with all the joints, perhaps uncemented, or  imperfectly filled up with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30755"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 2 (of 3), (#15)"],[1,", and deep wooden cornices and eaves painted cream color  and white, and small porches to their doors in the shape of  cockle-shells, or little, crooked, thick, indescribable wooden gables  warped a little on one side; and so forward till we come to larger  houses, also old-fashioned, but of red brick, and with gardens behind  them, and fruit walls, which show here and there, among the nectarines,  the vestiges of an old cloister arch or shaft, and looking in front on  the cathedral square itself, laid out in rigid divisions of smooth grass  and gravel walk, yet not uncheerful, especially on the sunny side where  the canons' children are walking with their nurserymaids. And so, taking  care not to tread on the grass, we will go along the straight walk to  the west front, and there stand for a time, looking up at its  deep-pointed porches and the dark places between their pillars where  there were statues once, and where the fragments, here and there, of a  stately figure are still left, which has in it the likeness of a king,  perhaps indeed a king on earth, perhaps a saintly king long ago in  heaven; and so higher and higher up to the great mouldering wall of  rugged sculpture and confused arcades, shattered, and grey, and grisly  with heads of dragons and mocking fiends, worn by the rain and swirling  winds into yet unseemlier shape, and colored on their stony scales by  the deep russet-orange lichen, melancholy gold; and so, higher still, to  the bleak towers, so far above that the eye loses itself among the  bosses of their traceries, though they are rude and strong, and only  sees like a drift of eddying black points, now closing, now scattering,  and now settling suddenly into invisible places among the bosses and  flowers, the crowed of restless birds that fill the whole square with  that strange clangor of theirs, so harsh and yet so soothing, like the  cries of birds on a solitary coast between the cliffs and sea.    Sec. XI. Think for a little while of that scene, and the meaning of all  its small formalisms, mixed with its serene sublimity. Estimate its  secluded, continuous, drowsy felicities, and its evidence of the sense  and steady performance of such kind of duties as can be regulated by the  cathedral clock; and weigh the influence of those dark towers on all who  have passed through the lonely square at their feet for centuries, and  on all who have seen them rising far away over the wooded plain, or  catching on their square masses the last rays of the sunset, when the  city at their feet was indicated only by the mist at the bend of the  river. And then let us quickly recollect that we are in Venice, and land  at the extremity of the Calle Lunga San Moise, which may be considered  as there answering to the secluded street that led us to our English  cathedral gateway.    Sec. XII. We find ourselves in a paved alley, some seven feet wide  where it is widest, full of people, and resonant with cries of itinerant  salesmen,--a shriek in their beginning, and dying away into a kind of  brazen ringing, all the worse for its confinement between the high  houses of the passage along which we have to make our way. Over-head an  inextricable confusion of rugged shutters, and iron balconies and  chimney flues pushed out on brackets to save room, and arched windows  with projecting sills of Istrian stone, and gleams of green leaves here  and there where a fig-tree branch escapes over a lower wall from some  inner cortile, leading the eye up to the narrow stream of blue sky high  over all. On each side, a row of shops, as densely set as may be,  occupying, in fact, intervals between the square stone shafts, about  eight feet high, which carry the first floors: intervals of which one is  narrow and serves as a door; the other is, in the more respectable  shops, wainscoted to the height of the counter and glazed above, but in  those of the poorer tradesmen left open to the ground, and the wares  laid on benches and tables in the open air, the light in all cases  entering at the front only, and fading away in a few feet from the  threshold into a gloom which the eye from without cannot penetrate, but  which is generally broken by a ray or two from a feeble lamp at the  back of the shop, suspended before a print of the Virgin. The less pious  shop-keeper sometimes leaves his lamp unlighted, and is contented with a  penny print; the more religious one has his print colored and set in a  little shrine with a gilded or figured fringe, with perhaps a faded  flower or two on each side, and his lamp burning brilliantly. Here at  the fruiterer's, where the dark-green water-melons are heaped upon the  counter like cannon balls, the Madonna has a tabernacle of fresh laurel  leaves; but the pewterer next door has let his lamp out, and there is  nothing to be seen in his shop but the dull gleam of the studded  patterns on the copper pans, hanging from his roof in the darkness. Next  comes a \"Vendita Frittole e Liquori,\" where the Virgin, enthroned in a  very humble manner beside a tallow candle on a back shelf, presides over  certain ambrosial morsels of a nature too ambiguous to be defined or  enumerated. But a few steps farther on, at the regular wine-shop of the  calle, where we are offered \"Vino Nostrani a Soldi 28.32,\" the Madonna  is in great glory, enthroned above ten or a dozen large red casks of  three-year-old vintage, and flanked by goodly ranks of bottles of  Maraschino, and two crimson lamps; and for the evening, when the  gondoliers will come to drink out, under her auspices, the money they  have gained during the day, she will have a whole chandelier.    Sec. XIII. A yard or two farther, we pass the hostelry of the Black  Eagle, and, glancing as we pass through the square door of marble, deeply  moulded, in the outer wall, we see the shadows of its pergola of vines  resting on an ancient well, with a pointed shield carved on its side;  and so presently emerge on the bridge and Campo San Moise, whence to the  entrance into St. Mark's Place, called the Bocca di Piazza (mouth of the  square), the Venetian character is nearly destroyed, first by the  frightful facade of San Moise, which we will pause at another time to  examine, and then by the modernizing of the shops as they near the  piazza, and the mingling with the lower Venetian populace of lounging  groups of English and Austrians. We will push fast through them into the  shadow of the pillars at the end of the \"Bocca di Piazza,\" and then we  forget them all; for between those pillars there opens a great light,  and, in the midst of it, as we advance slowly, the vast tower of St.  Mark seems to lift itself visibly forth from the level field of  chequered stones; and, on each side, the countless arches prolong  themselves into ranged symmetry, as if the rugged and irregular houses  that pressed together above us in the dark alley had been struck back  into sudden obedience and lovely order, and all their rude casements and  broken walls had been transformed into arches charged with goodly  sculpture, and fluted shafts of delicate stone.    Sec. XIV. And well may they fall back, for beyond those troops of ordered  arches there rises a vision out of the earth, and all the great square  seems to have opened from it in a kind of awe, that we may see it far  away;--a multitude of pillars and white domes, clustered into a long low  pyramid of colored light; a treasure-heap, it seems, partly of gold, and  partly of opal and mother-of-pearl, hollowed beneath into five great  vaulted porches, ceiled with fair mosaic, and beset with sculpture of  alabaster, clear as amber and delicate as ivory,--sculpture fantastic  and involved, of palm leaves and lilies, and grapes and pomegranates,  and birds clinging and fluttering among the branches, all twined  together into an endless network of buds and plumes; and, in the midst  of it, the solemn forms of angels, sceptred, and robed to the feet, and  leaning to each other across the gates, their figures indistinct among  the gleaming of the golden ground through the leaves beside them,  interrupted and dim, like the morning light as it faded back among the  branches of Eden, when first its gates were angel-guarded long ago. And  round the walls of the porches there are set pillars of variegated  stones, jasper and porphyry, and deep-green serpentine spotted with  flakes of snow, and marbles, that half refuse and half yield to the  sunshine, Cleopatra-like, \"their bluest veins to kiss\"--the shadow, as  it steals back from them, revealing line after line of azure undulation,  as a receding tide leaves the waved sand; their capitals rich with  interwoven tracery, rooted knots of herbage, and drifting leaves of  acanthus and vine, and mystical signs, all beginning and ending in the  Cross; and above them, in the broad archivolts, a continuous chain of  language and of life--angels, and the signs of heaven, and the labors of  men, each in its appointed season upon the earth; and above these,  another range of glittering pinnacles, mixed with white arches edged  with scarlet flowers,--a confusion of delight, amidst which the breasts  of the Greek horses are seen blazing in their breadth of golden  strength, and the St. Mark's Lion, lifted on a blue field covered with  stars, until at last, as if in ecstasy, the crests of the arches break  into a marble foam, and toss themselves far into the blue sky in flashes  and wreaths of sculptured spray, as if the breakers on the Lido shore  had been frost-bound before they fell, and the sea-nymphs had inlaid  them with coral and amethyst.    Between that grim cathedral of England and this, what an interval! There  is a type of it in the very birds that haunt them; for, instead of the  restless crowd, hoarse-voiced and sable-winged, drifting on the bleak  upper air, the St. Mark's porches are full of doves, that nestle among  the marble foliage, and mingle the soft iridescence of"]]]
