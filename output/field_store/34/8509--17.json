George Grenville.[4]    In 1841, Mr. N. W. Simons, of the British Museum, refuted the  supposition that Sir Philip Francis was directly or indirectly  concerned in the writing; and, in the same year, appeared M. Jaques's  review of the controversy, in which he arrived at the conclusion that  Lord George Sackville composed the Letters, and that Sir Philip Francis  was his amanuensis, thus combining the theory of Mr. Taylor with that of  Mr. Coventry.    The question was reviewed and revived in a volume published by Mr.  Britton, F.S.A., in June 1848, entitled \"The Authorship of the Letters  of Junius Elucidated;\" in which is advocated with great care the opinion  that the Letters were, to a certain extent, the joint productions of  Lieut.-Colonel Isaac Barre, M.P., Lord Shelburne, (afterwards Marquess  of Lansdowne,) and Dunning, Lord Ashburton. Of these three persons the  late Sir Francis Baring commissioned Sir Joshua Reynolds, in 1784-5, to  paint portraits in one picture, which is regarded as evidence of joint  authorship.    Only a week before his death, 1804, the Marquess of Lansdowne was  personally appealed to on the subject of _Junius_, by Sir Richard  Phillips. In conversation, the Marquess said, \"No, no, I am not equal to  _Junius_; I could not be the author; but the grounds of secrecy are now  so far removed by death (Dunning and Barre were at that time dead), and  change of circumstances, that it is unnecessary the author of _Junius_  should much longer be unknown. The world is curious about him, and I  could make a very interesting publication on the subject. I knew Junius,  and _I know all about_ the writing and production of these Letters.\"  The Marquess added, \"If I live over the summer, which, however, I don't  expect, I promise you a very interesting pamphlet about Junius. I will  put my name to it; I will set the question at rest for ever.\" The death  of the Marquess, however, occurred in a week. In a letter to the _Monthly  Magazine_, July 1813, the son of the Marquess of Lansdowne says:--\"It  is not impossible my father may have been acquainted with the fact; but  perhaps he was under some obligation to secrecy, as he never made any  communication to me on the subject.\"    Lord Mahon (now Earl Stanhope) at length and with minuteness enters, in  his History, into a vindication of the claims of Sir Philip Francis,  grounding his partisanship on the close similarity of handwriting  established by careful comparison of facsimiles; the likeness of the  style of Sir Philip's speeches in Parliament to that of _Junius_--biting,  pithy, full of antithesis and invective; the tenderness and bitterness  displayed by _Junius_ towards persons to whom Sir Philip stood well or  ill affected; the correspondence of the dates of the letters with those  of certain movements of Sir Philip; and the evidence of _Junius_' close  acquaintance with the War Office, where Sir Philip held a post. It seems  generally agreed that the weight of proof is on the side of Sir Philip  Francis; but there will always be found adherents of other names--as  O'Connell, in the following passage, of Burke:--        \"It is my decided opinion,\" said O'Connell, \"that Edmund Burke      was the author of the 'Letters of Junius.' There are many      considerations which compel me to form that opinion. Burke was the      only man who made that figure in the world which the author of      'Junius' _must_ have made, if engaged in public life; and the      entire of 'Junius's Letters' evinces that close acquaintance with      the springs of political machinery which no man could possess      unless actively engaged in politics. Again, Burke was fond of      chemical similes; now chemical similes are frequent in Junius.      Again; Burke was an Irishman; now Junius, speaking of the      Government of Ireland, twice calls it 'the Castle,' a familiar      phrase amongst Irish politicians, but one which an Englishman,      in those days, would never have used. Again; Burke had this      peculiarity in writing, that he often wrote many words without      taking the pen from the paper. The very same peculiarity existed      in the manuscripts of Junius, although they were written in a      feigned hand. Again; it may be said that the style is not Burke's.      In reply, I would say that Burke was master of many styles. His      work on natural society, in imitation of Lord Bolingbroke, is as      different in point of style from his work on the French Revolution,      as _both_ are from the 'Letters of Junius.' Again; Junius speaks      of the King's insanity as a divine visitation; Burke said the very      same thing in the House of Commons. Again; had any one of the      other men to whom the 'Letters' are, with any show of probability,      ascribed, been really the author, such author would have had no      reason for disowning the book, or remaining incognito. Any one of      them but Burke would have claimed the authorship and fame--and      proud fame. But Burke had a very cogent reason for remaining      incognito. In claiming Junius he would have claimed his own      condemnation and dishonour, for Burke died a pensioner. Burke      was, moreover, the only pensioner who had the commanding talent      displayed in the writings of Junius. Now, when I lay all these      considerations together, and especially when I reflect that a      cogent reason exists for Burke's silence as to his own authorship,      I confess I think I have got a presumptive proof of the very      strongest nature, that Burke was the writer.\"[5]     [4] Supported by the following note, written by Dr. Parr, in his copy   of  \"The Letters of Junius:\"--\"The writer of 'Junius' was Mr. Lloyd,   secretary to George Grenville, and brother to Philip Lloyd, Dean of   Norwich.

Daunt.           *       *       *       *       *      LITERARY COFFEE-HOUSES IN THE LAST CENTURY.    Three of the most celebrated resorts of the _literati_ of the last  century were _Will's Coffee-house_, No. 23, on the north side of Great  Russell-street, Covent Garden, at the end of Bow-street. This was the  favourite resort of Dryden, who had here his own chair, in winter by the  fireside, in summer in the balcony: the company met in the first floor,  and there smoked; and the young beaux and wits were sometimes honoured  with a pinch out of Dryden's snuff-box. Will's was the resort of men of  genius till 1710: it was subsequently occupied by a perfumer.    _Tom's_, No. 17, Great Russell-street, had nearly 700 subscribers, at a  guinea a-head, from 1764 to 1768, and had its card, conversation, and  coffee-rooms, where assembled Dr. Johnson, Carrick, Murphy, Goldsmith,  Sir Joshua Reynolds, Foote, and other men of talent: the tables and  books of the club were not many years since preserved in the house, the  first floor of which was then occupied by Mr. Webster, the medallist.    _Button's_, \"over against\" Tom's, was the receiving-house for  contributions to _The Guardian_, in a lion-head box, the aperture for  which remains in the wall to mark the place. Button had been servant to  Lady Warwick, whom Addison married; and the house was frequented by  Pope, Steele, Swift, Arbuthnot, and Addison. The lion's head for a  letter-box, \"the best head in England,\" was set up in imitation of  the celebrated lion at Venice: it was removed from Button's to the  Shakspeare's Head, under the arcade in Covent Garden; and in 1751, was  placed in the Bedford, next door. This lion's head is now treasured as a  relic by the Bedford family.           *       *       *       *       *      LORD BYRON AND \"MY GRANDMOTHER'S REVIEW.\"    At the close of the first canto of _Don Juan_, its noble author, by way  of propitiating the reader for the morality of his poem, says:--     \"The public approbation I expect,      And beg they'll take my word about the moral,    Which I with their amusement will connect,      As children cutting teeth receive a coral;    Meantime, they'll doubtless please to recollect      My epical pretensions to the laurel;    For fear some prudish reader should grow skittish,      I've bribed my Grandmother's Review--the British.      I sent it in a letter to the editor,      Who thank'd me duly by return of post--    I'm for a handsome article his creditor;      Yet if my gentle muse he please to roast,    And break a promise after having made it her,      Denying the receipt of what it cost,    And smear his page with gall instead of honey,      All I can say is--that he had the money.\"                              _Canto I. st._ ccix. ccx.    Now, \"the British\" was a certain staid and grave high-church review, the  editor of which received the poet's imputation of bribery as a serious  accusation; and, accordingly, in his next number after the publication  of _Don Juan_, there appeared a postscript, in which the receipt of any  bribe was stoutly denied, and the idea of such connivance altogether  repudiated; the editor adding that he should continue to exercise his  own judgment as to the merits of Lord Byron, as he had hitherto done  in every instance! However, the affair was too ludicrous to be at once  altogether dropped; and, so long as the prudish publication was in  existence, it enjoyed the _sobriquet_ of \"My Grandmother's Review.\"    By the way, there is another hoax connected with this poem. One day  an old gentleman gravely inquired of a printseller for a portrait of  \"Admiral Noah\"--to illustrate _Don Juan_!           *       *       *       *       *      WALPOLE'S WAY TO WIN THEM.    Sir Robert Walpole, in one of his letters, thus describes the relations  of a skilful Minister with an accommodating Parliament--the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3043"],[0,"The Quaker Colonies: A Chronicle of the Proprietors of the Delaware (#15)"],[1,"rewards for prisoners and scalps, closed by saying, \"and  for the scalp of a female Indian fifty pieces of eight.\" William Penn's  Indian policy had been admired for its justice and humanity by all the  philosophers and statesmen of the world, and now his grandson, Governor  of the province, in the last days of the family's control, was offering  bounties for women's scalps.    Franklin while in England had succeeded in having the proprietary lands  taxed equally with the lands of the colonists. But the proprietors  attempted to construe this provision so that their best lands were taxed  at the rate paid by the people on their worst. This obvious quibble of  course raised such a storm of opposition that the Quakers, joined by  classes which had never before supported them, and now forming a large  majority, determined to appeal to the Government in England to abolish  the proprietorship and put the colony under the rule of the King. In the  proposal to make Pennsylvania a Crown colony there was no intention  of confiscating the possessions of the proprietors. It was merely the  proprietary political power, their right to appoint the Governor, that  was to be abolished. This right was to be absorbed by the Crown with  payment for its value to the proprietors; but in all other respects  the charter and the rights and liberties of the people were to remain  unimpaired. Just there lay the danger. An act of Parliament would be  required to make the change and, having once started on such a change,  Parliament, or the party in power therein, might decide to make other  changes, and in the end there might remain very little of the original  rights and liberties of the colonists under their charter. It was by  no means a wise move. But intense feeling on the subject was aroused.  Passionate feeling seemed to have been running very high among the  steady Quakers. In this new outburst the Quakers had the Scotch-Irish on  their side, and a part of the Churchmen. The Germans were divided, but  the majority enthusiastic for the change was very large.    There was a new alignment of parties. The eastern Presbyterians, usually  more or less in sympathy with the Scotch-Irish, broke away from them  on this occasion. These Presbyterians opposed the change to a royal  governor because they believed that it would be followed by the  establishment by law of the Church of England, with bishops and all the  other ancient evils. Although some of the Churchmen joined the Quaker  side, most of them and the most influential of them were opposed to the  change and did good work in opposing it. They were well content with  their position under the proprietors and saw nothing to be gained under  a royal governor. There were also not a few people who, in the increase  of the wealth of the province, had acquired aristocratic tastes and were  attached to the pleasant social conditions that had grown up round the  proprietary governors and their followers; and there were also those  whose salaries, incomes, or opportunities for wealth were more or less  dependent on the proprietors retaining the executive offices and the  appointments and patronage.    One of the most striking instances of a change of sides was the case of  a Philadelphia Quaker, John Dickinson, a lawyer of large practice, a man  of wealth and position, and of not a little colonial magnificence when  he drove in his coach and four. It was he who later wrote the famous  \"Farmer's Letters\" during the Revolution. He was a member of the  Assembly and had been in politics for some years. But on this question  of a change to royal government, he left the Quaker majority and opposed  the change with all his influence and ability. He and his father-in-law,  Isaac Norris, Speaker of the Assembly, became the leaders against  the change, and Franklin and Joseph Galloway, the latter afterwards a  prominent loyalist in the Revolution, were the leading advocates of the  change.    The whole subject was thoroughly thrashed out in debates in the Assembly  and in pamphlets of very great ability and of much interest to students  of colonial history and the growth of American ideas of liberty. It must  be remembered that this was the year 1764, on the eve of the Revolution.  British statesmen were planning a system of more rigorous control of the  colonies; and the advisability of a stamp tax was under consideration.  Information of all these possible changes had reached the colonies.  Dickinson foresaw the end and warned the people. Franklin and the Quaker  party thought there was no danger and that the mother country could be  implicitly trusted.    Dickinson warned the people that the British Ministry were starting  special regulations for new colonies and \"designing the strictest  reformations in the old.\" It would be a great relief, he admitted, to  be rid of the pettiness of the proprietors, and it might be accomplished  some time in the future; but not now. The proprietary system might  be bad, but a royal government might be worse and might wreck all the  liberties of the province, religious freedom, the Assembly's control  of its own adjournments, and its power of raising and disposing of the  public money. The ministry of the day in England were well known not  to be favorably inclined towards Pennsylvania because of the frequently  reported willfulness of the Assembly, on which the recent disturbances  had also been blamed. If the King, Ministry, and Parliament started  upon a change, they might decide to reconstitute the Assembly entirely,  abolish its ancient privileges, and disfranchise both Quakers and  Presbyterians.    The arguments of Franklin and Galloway consisted principally of  assertions of the good intentions of the mother country and the  absurdity of any fear on the part of the colonists for their privileges.  But the King in whom they had so much confidence was George III, and the  Parliament which they thought would do no harm was the same one which  a few months afterwards passed the Stamp Act which brought on the  Revolution. Franklin and Galloway also asserted that the colonies like  Massachusetts, the Jerseys, and the Carolinas, which had been changed to  royal governments, had profited by the change. But that was hardly the  prevailing opinion in those colonies themselves. Royal governors  could be as petty and annoying as the Penns and far more tyrannical.  Pennsylvania had always defeated any attempts at despotism on the part  of the Penn family and had built up a splendid body of liberal laws and  legislative privileges. But governors with the authority and power of  the British Crown behind them could not be so easily resisted as the  deputy governors of the Penns.    The Assembly, however, voted--twenty-seven to three--with Franklin  and Galloway. In the general election of the autumn, the question was  debated anew among the people and, though Franklin and Galloway were  defeated for seats in the Assembly, yet the popular verdict was strongly  in favor of a change, and the majority in the Assembly was for practical  purposes unaltered. They voted to appeal to England for the change, and  appointed Franklin to be their agent before the Crown and Ministry. He  sailed again for England and soon was involved in the opening scenes of  the Revolution. He was made agent for all the colonies and he spent  many delightful years there pursuing his studies in science, dining with  distinguished men, staying at country seats, and learning all the arts  of diplomacy for which he afterwards became so distinguished.    As for the Assembly's petition for a change to royal government,  Franklin presented it, but never pressed it. He, too, was finally  convinced that the time was inopportune. In fact, the Assembly itself  before long began to have doubts and fears and sent him word to let  the subject drop; and amid much greater events it was soon entirely  forgotten.        Chapter VIII. The Beginnings Of New Jersey    New Jersey, Scheyichbi, as the Indians called it, or Nova Caesarea,  as it was called in the Latin of its proprietary grant, had a history  rather different from that of other English colonies in America.  Geographically, it had not a few attractions. It was a good sized  dominion surrounded on all sides but one by water, almost an island  domain, secluded and independent. In fact, it was the only one of the  colonies which stood naturally separate and apart. The others were  bounded almost entirely by artificial or imaginary lines.    It offered an opportunity, one might have supposed, for some  dissatisfied religious sect of the seventeenth century to secure a  sanctuary and keep off all intruders. But at first no one of the various  denominations seems to have fancied it or chanced upon it. The Puritans  disembarked upon the bleak shores of New England well suited to the  sternness of their religion. How different American history might have  been if they had established themselves in the Jerseys! Could they,  under those milder skies, have developed witchcraft, set up blue laws,  and indulged in the killing of Quakers? After a time they learned about  the Jerseys and cast thrifty eyes upon them. Their seafaring habits and  the pursuit of whales led them along the coast and into Delaware Bay.  The Puritans of New Haven made persistent efforts to settle the southern  part of Jersey, on the Delaware near Salem. They thought, as their  quaint old records show, that if they could once start a branch colony  in Jersey it might become more populous and powerful than the New  Haven settlement and in that case they intended to move their seat of  government to the new colony. But their shrewd estimate of its value  came too late. The Dutch and the Swedes occupied the Delaware at that  time and drove them out. Puritans, however, entered northern Jersey  and, while they were not numerous enough to make it a thoroughly Puritan  community, they largely tinged "]]]
