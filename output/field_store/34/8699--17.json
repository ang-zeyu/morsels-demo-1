If the metal seeds were once obtained, might they  not entertain hopes of their growth?    Such ideas could only be entertained when nothing was known of the  atmosphere, and its participation with the earth, in administering  to the vital processes of plants and animals. Modern chemistry  indeed produces the elements of water, and, combining them, forms  water anew; but it does not create those elements--it derives them  from water; the new-formed artificial water has been water before.    Many of our farmers are like the alchemists of old,--they are  searching for the miraculous seed,--the means, which, without any  further supply of nourishment to a soil scarcely rich enough to be  sprinkled with indigenous plants, shall produce crops of grain a  hundred-fold.    The experience of centuries, nay, of thousands of years, is  insufficient to guard men against these fallacies; our only security  from these and similar absurdities must be derived from a correct  knowledge of scientific principles.    In the first period of natural philosophy, organic life was supposed  to be derived from water only; afterwards, it was admitted that  certain elements derived from the air must be superadded to the  water; but we now know that other elements must be supplied by the  earth, if plants are to thrive and multiply.    The amount of materials contained in the atmosphere, suited to the  nourishment of plants, is limited; but it must be abundantly  sufficient to cover the whole surface of the earth with a rich  vegetation. Under the tropics, and in those parts of our globe where  the most genial conditions of fertility exist,--a suitable soil, a  moist atmosphere, and a high temperature,--vegetation is scarcely  limited by space; and, where the soil is wanting, it is gradually  supplied by the decaying leaves, bark and branches of plants. It is  obvious there is no deficiency of atmospheric nourishment for plants  in those regions, nor are these wanting in our own cultivated  fields: all that plants require for their development is conveyed to  them by the incessant motions of the atmosphere. The air between the  tropics contains no more than that of the arctic zones; and yet how  different is the amount of produce of an equal surface of land in  the two situations!    This is easily explicable. All the plants of tropical climates, the  oil and wax palms, the sugar cane, &c., contain only a small  quantity of the elements of the blood necessary to the nutrition of  animals, as compared with our cultivated plants. The tubers of the  potato in Chili, its native country, where the plant resembles a  shrub, if collected from an acre of land, would scarcely suffice to  maintain an Irish family for a single day (Darwin). The result of  cultivation in those plants which serve as food, is to produce in  them those constituents of the blood. In the absence of the elements  essential to these in the soil, starch, sugar and woody fibre, are  perhaps formed; but no vegetable fibrine, albumen, or caseine. If we  intend to produce on a given surface of soil more of these latter  matters than the plants can obtain from the atmosphere or receive  from the soil of the same surface in its uncultivated and normal  state, we must create an artificial atmosphere, and add the needed  elements to the soil.    The nourishment which must be supplied in a given time to different  plants, in order to admit a free and unimpeded growth, is very  unequal.    On pure sand, on calcareous soil, on naked rocks, only a few genera  of plants prosper, and these are, for the most part, perennial  plants. They require, for their slow growth, only such minute  quantities of mineral substances as the soil can furnish, which may  be totally barren for other species. Annual, and especially summer  plants, grow and attain their perfection in a comparatively short  time; they therefore do not prosper on a soil which is poor in those  mineral substances necessary to their development. To attain a  maximum in height in the short period of their existence, the  nourishment contained in the atmosphere is not sufficient. If the  end of cultivation is to be obtained, we must create in the soil an  artificial atmosphere of carbonic acid and ammonia; and this surplus  of nourishment, which the leaves cannot appropriate from the air,  must be taken up by the corresponding organs, i.e. the roots, from  the soil. But the ammonia, together with the carbonic acid, are  alone insufficient to become part of a plant destined to the  nourishment of animals. In the absence of the alkalies, the  phosphates and other earthy salts, no vegetable fibrine, no  vegetable caseine, can be formed. The phosphoric acid of the  phosphate of lime, indispensable to the cerealia and other  vegetables in the formation of their seeds, is separated as an  excrement, in great quantities, by the rind and barks of ligneous  plants.    How different are the evergreen plants, the cacti, the mosses, the  ferns, and the pines, from our annual grasses, the cerealia and  leguminous vegetables! The former, at every time of the day during  winter and summer, obtain carbon through their leaves by absorbing  carbonic acid which is not furnished by the barren soil on which  they grow; water is also absorbed and retained by their coriaceous  or fleshy leaves with great force. They lose very little by  evaporation, compared with other plants. On the other hand, how very  small is the quantity of mineral substances which they withdraw from  the soil during their almost constant growth in one year, in  comparison with the quantity which one crop of wheat of an equal  weight receives in three months!    It is by means of moisture that plants receive the necessary  alkalies and salts from the soil. In dry summers a phenomenon is  observed, which, when the importance of mineral elements to the life  of a plant was unknown, could not be explained. The leaves of plants  first developed and perfected, and therefore nearer the surface of  the soil, shrivel up and become yellow, lose their vitality, and  fall off while the plant is in an active state of growth, without  any visible cause. This phenomenon is not seen in moist years, nor  in evergreen plants, and but rarely in plants which have long and  deep roots, nor is it seen in perennials in autumn and winter.    The cause of this premature decay is now obvious. The  perfectly-developed leaves absorb continually carbonic acid and  ammonia from the atmosphere, which are converted into elements of  new leaves, buds, and shoots; but this metamorphosis cannot be  effected without the aid of the alkalies, and other mineral  substances. If the soil is moist, the latter are continually  supplied to an adequate amount, and the plant retains its lively  green colour; but if this supply ceases from a want of moisture to  dissolve the mineral elements, a separation takes place in the plant  itself. The mineral constituents of the juice are withdrawn from the  leaves already formed, and are used for the formation of the young  shoots; and as soon as the seeds are developed, the vitality of the  leaves completely ceases. These withered leaves contain only minute  traces of soluble salts, while the buds and shoots are very rich in  them.    On the other hand, it has been observed, that where a soil is too  highly impregnated with soluble saline materials, these are  separated upon the surface of the leaves. This happens to culinary  vegetables especially, whose leaves become covered with a white  crust. In consequence of these exudations the plant sickens, its  organic activity decreases, its growth is disturbed; and if this  state continues long, the plant dies. This is most frequently seen  in foliaceous plants, the large surfaces of which evaporate  considerable quantities of water. Carrots, pumpkins, peas, &c., are  frequently thus diseased, when, after dry weather, the plant being  near its full growth, the soil is moistened by short showers,  followed again by dry weather. The rapid evaporation carries off the  water absorbed by the root, and this leaves the salts in the plant  in a far greater quantity than it can assimilate. These salts  effloresce upon the surface of the leaves, and if they are  herbaceous and juicy, produce an effect upon them as if they had  been watered with a solution containing a greater quantity of salts  than their organism can bear.    Of two plants of the same species, this disease befalls that which  is nearest its perfection; if one should have been planted later, or  be more backward in its development, the same external cause which  destroys the one will contribute to the growth of the other.          LETTER XII      My dear Sir,    Having now occupied several letters with the attempt to unravel, by  means of chemistry, some of the most curious functions of the animal  body, and, as I hope, made clear to you the distinctions between the  two kinds of constituent elements in food, and the purposes they  severally subserve in sustaining life, let me now direct your  attention to a scarcely less interesting and equally important  subject--the means of obtaining from a given surface of the earth  the largest amount of produce adapted to the food of man and  animals.    Agriculture is both a science and an art. The knowledge of all the  conditions of the life of vegetables, the origin of their elements,  and the sources of their nourishment, forms its scientific basis.    From this knowledge we derive certain rules for the exercise of the  ART, the principles upon which the mechanical operations of farming  depend, the usefulness or necessity of these for preparing the soil  to support the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45303"],[0,"The Life of John Taylor (#15)"],[1,"y; or with a pleasing fear had seen the storm-clouds gather  about her island home, and saw old ocean's mighty waves lashed into  fury, break into harmless spray on Mona's rugged shores. These thoughts  suggested others. He dwelt in fond remembrance on the occasion of her  becoming his wife, and called to mind her trust and love, and all the  happy scenes and hours they had shared together.    Recollection once at work, stopped not at their joys, but brought up to  his vision their sorrows, their afflictions and the persecutions they  had passed through for the sake of the truth--for the cause of God; and  in conclusion he exclaimed:    \"Thou hast passed through trials, Nora, but thou shalt rejoice! Thou  hast been driven from thy home for the truth's sake, but thou and thy  children shall have a home in the Kingdom of God! Thou hast suffered  the bereavement of thy husband--the tender association has been  severed--that others may be made partakers of endless life; but thou  and thy husband shall yet reign together in the celestial kingdom of  God. A few more struggles and the battle will be fought, the victory  will be ours, and with the redeemed out of every nation we will sing,  'Glory, and honor, and power, and might, and majesty, and dominion be  ascribed to Him that sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb, forever  and forever?'\"    A day or two after their arrival it was decided that Elders Clark and  Brother Mitchel should go to Ramsey and Elder Taylor remain to labor  in Douglas. He accompanied the two brethren a short distance on their  journey, and before separating they repaired to a lovely spot in a  field, some distance from the road, and there engaged in prayer. The  burden of that prayer was that an effectual door might be opened to  them in that island for the proclamation of the gospel; that gainsayers  might be put to shame, and that the word might be confirmed by signs  following the believers. After prayer they each sought a stone and  placed it at the foot of a tree, on which Elder Taylor carved their  names and the date of their being there. He also ordained Brother  Mitchel a Deacon; and at the request of Elder Clark he also laid  hands upon his head that he might have the gift of tongues and the  interpretation thereof; and afterwards Elder Clark blessed Elder  Taylor. For some time they spoke in tongues, sang, prophesied, and  finally separated to their respective fields of labor, each to thrust  in his sickle and reap.    Elder Taylor, on returning to Douglas, called on Mr. Cain, a  book-binder and seller, and a Primitive Methodist preacher. Although  he was a minister, he was sensible that his church fell far short of  having a fullness of truth, and hence was ready to listen to one who  claimed to have the fullness of the gospel.    He also called upon a number of his wife's girlhood friends, some of  whom were pleased to see him. In this way he made a large circle of  acquaintances, and taught them the gospel. Finally he engaged the  Wellington Rooms, the largest hall in Douglas, capable of seating one  thousand persons.    In this hall he delivered several lectures amid considerable opposition  from sectarian priests. One of their number, Rev. Thomas Hamilton,  was particularly offensive and made some disturbance, but the Elder  found many who befriended him, and indeed, the people generally seemed  indignant at the course pursued by his opponents. At length Mr.  Hamilton sent a challenge to meet him in public discussion, the body of  which was as follows:    \"SIR:--Conceiving that the principles advocated by you in the lectures  which you delivered in the Wellington Rooms have no support from the  word of God, but are diametrically opposed to it, and as you _misquoted  that word, mutilated it, took from_ and _added_ to it; I hereby invite  you to a public discussion of the truth of what I conceive to be mere  assertions, and design to prove you guilty of blasphemy against God and  of decoying souls to perdition.\"    To this Elder Taylor made the following reply:    \"I am not aware of having mutilated, misquoted, taken from or added to  the word of God, or of speaking or teaching blasphemy, or trying to  lead men to perdition, as I am charged with in your note; but have been  conscientiously discharging a duty devolving upon me in unfolding the  principles of eternal truth. But as I never shrink from the task of  supporting those principles, in the strength of the Lord, I comply with  your request on the following terms:    \"First. That each of us choose a chairman for the preserving of order  in the meeting.    \"Second. That the lectures I have delivered in the Wellington Rooms  be the subject of debate, and that you engage to prove that in those  lectures I have advanced doctrines that are unscriptural.    \"Third. That the word of God be the test.    \"Fourth. That you have an hour to repudiate those supposed errors, and  that I have the same time to reply; that you then have half an hour to  speak and that I have half an hour to reply, and that the meeting then  close for the evening.    \"As you have not said anything in your note about the room being taken  by you, I propose that we take it between us, and make a collection to  pay the charge for its use.    \"If these propositions, sir, should meet with your approbation, you may  expect me there at the appointed time.    \"As I am a stranger in the town I have not as yet made choice of a  chairman, but as Mr. Cain, in the midst of the confusion the other  evening, spoke a few words in my favor, perhaps I may choose him, if he  will accept it.\"    The discussion came off in accordance with this arrangement, and Mr.  Hamilton was vanquished. \"No great honor, however,\" says Elder Taylor,  in his account of this affair, \"as he was a very ignorant man.\"    Another minister delivered a course of lectures against him, to which  he replied in his own hall--the Wellington Rooms. Another--a Mr. J.  Curran--published a series of newspaper articles against Mormonism, to  which he replied. At the same time the Rev. Robert Heys, a Wesleyan  Methodist, published three pamphlets in opposition to his doctrines, to  each of which he published a reply. Unfortunately, only one of these  pamphlets--the second--has been preserved; but from it we may learn  something of Elder Taylor's power as a debater, the power by which  he earned his title of \"Champion of Truth.\" It is not my purpose to  follow the discussion in all its details, or even give an outline of  it, but simply introduce a single paragraph that is a specimen of Elder  Taylor's cogent reasoning.    His reverend opponent stoutly objected to Mormonism because it was  based on a new revelation, and in his view the day of revelation had  passed--the volume thereof was complete; and he maintained that the  Bible itself forbids any more revelation being added to it, and as  Mormonism claimed to have come into existence through revelation, it  violated the prohibitions of the Bible, and therefore Mormonism was an  imposture.    In support of this argument, he quoted three passages of scripture:  First from Deuteronomy, \"Ye shall not _add_ unto the word which I  command you, neither shall ye diminish aught from it, that ye may keep  the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you;\" second from  Proverbs, \"Every word of the Lord is pure, * * * _Add_ thou not unto  his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar;\" lastly,  from Revelation, \"I testify unto every man that heareth the words of  the prophecy of this book, if any man shall _add_ unto these things,  God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book.\"    To this argument Elder Taylor replied:    \"With astonishing confidence in the infallibility of his skill in  biblical lore, Mr. Heys rapidly carries his readers along with him  through the Old and New Testaments, and then, after showing them why  they were written, he reveals the perfection of his knowledge by  giving publicity to the following, which, for aught I know, he may  consider a new discovery: 'Now of this complete and infallible rule  (meaning the HOLY BIBLE) God has decreed and declared that _nothing  shall be either added to it or taken from it!_' This certainly must  be a _new revelation_, for such a _decree_ or _declaration_ is not to  be found in the whole of the sacred writings! It is true, he quotes  three passages--one from Deuteronomy, one from Proverbs, and another  from Revelation; but not one of them contains the decree! That in  Deuteronomy refers exclusively to the Book of the Law. If they declared  the revelation of God to be _complete_, the other scriptures could  never have been written. That in Proverbs refers to the portion of  the sacred writings then in existence. If it is declared the Holy  Scriptures were _complete_, there would not have been afterwards a  continued written revelation. That in the Revelation refers to the  Apocalypse alone, it being, when written, a separate book, unconnected  with the other books of the New Testament which were not then  collected; it could not, therefore, have reference to any other book  or books of the Holy Scriptures. According to his own interpretation  of the above scriptures, in quoting from Proverbs, he would reject the  New Testament and all the prophets that prophesied after Solomon's day;  and in his quotation from Deuteronomy, he would reject all the Bible  but the five books of Moses. But let Mr. Hays take care that he himself  is not incurring the curse by altering the meaning of the words of the  very books to which the prohibition positively and particularly refers!\"    Thus he followed his opponent in all his wanderings, as he promises to  do in the beginning of the reply from which the above is taken--\"lest  he should 'pervert the truth' and 'darken counsel by words without  knowledge.'\" \"And while pursuing him,\" he continues, \"it will afford  me no small degree"]]]
