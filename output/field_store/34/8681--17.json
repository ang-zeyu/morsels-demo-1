That habit being established, _you are free from the woman at the  next desk._ She cannot irritate you nor wear upon you, no matter how  she tries, no matter what she says, or what she does.    There is, however, this trouble about dropping the contraction. We  are apt to have a feeling of what we might call \"righteous  indignation\" at annoyances which are put upon us for no reason;  that, so-called, \"righteous indignation\" takes the form of  resistance and makes physical contractions.    It is useless to drop the physical contraction if the indignation is  going to rise and tighten us all up again. If we drop the physical  and mental contractions we must have something good to fill the open  channels that have been made. Therefore let us give our best  attention to our work, and if opportunity offers, do a kindness to  the woman at the next desk.    Finally, when she finds that her ways do not annoy, she will stop  them. She will probably, for a time at first, try harder to be  disagreeable, and then after recovering from several surprises at  not being able to annoy, she will quiet down and grow less  disagreeable.    If we realize the effect of successive and continued resistance upon  ourselves and realize at the same time that we can drop or hold  those resistances as we choose to work to get free from them, or  suffer and hold them, then we can appreciate the truth that if the  woman at the next desk continues to annoy us, it is our fault  entirely, and not hers.          CHAPTER XIV    _Telephones and Telephoning_      MOST men--and women--use more nervous force in speaking through the  telephone than would be needed to keep them strong and healthy for  years.    It is good to note that the more we keep in harmony with natural  laws the more quiet we are forced to be.    Nature knows no strain. True science knows no strain. Therefore _a  strained high-pitched voice does not carry over the telephone wire  as well as a low one._    If every woman using the telephone would remember this fact the good  accomplished would be thricefold. She would save her own nervous  energy. She would save the ears of the woman at the other end of the  wire. She would make herself heard.    Patience, gentleness, firmness--a quiet concentration--all tell  immeasurably over the telephone wire.    Impatience, rudeness, indecision, and diffuseness blur communication  by telephone even more than they do when one is face to face with  the person talking.    It is as if the wire itself resented these inhuman phases of  humanity and spit back at the person who insulted it by trying to  transmit over it such unintelligent bosh.    There are people who feel that if they do not get an immediate  answer at the telephone they have a right to demand and get good  service by means of an angry telephonic sputter.    The result of this attempt to scold the telephone girl is often an  impulsive, angry response on her part--which she may be sorry for  later on--and if the service is more prompt for that time it reacts  later to what appears to be the same deficiency.    No one was ever kept steadily up to time by angry scolding. It is  against reason.    To a demanding woman who is strained and tired herself, a wait of  ten seconds seems ten minutes. I have heard such a woman ring the  telephone bell almost without ceasing for fifteen minutes. I could  hear her strain and anger reflected in the ringing of the bell. When  finally she \"got her party\" the strain in her high-pitched voice  made it impossible for her to be clearly understood. Then she got  angry again because \"Central\" had not \"given her a better  connection,\" and finally came away from the telephone nearly in a  state of nervous collapse and insisted that the telephone would  finally end her life. I do not think she once suspected that the  whole state of fatigue which had almost brought an illness upon her  was absolutely and entirely her own fault.    The telephone has no more to do with it than the floor has to do  with a child's falling and bumping his head.    The worst of this story is that if any one had told this woman that  her tired state was all unnecessary, it would have roused more  strain and anger, more fatigue, and more consequent illness.    Women must begin to find out their own deficiencies before they are  ready to accept suggestions which can lead to greater freedom and  more common sense.    Another place where science and inhuman humanity do not blend is in  the angry moving up and down of the telephone hook.    When the hook is moved quickly and without pause it does not give  time for the light before the telephone girl to flash, therefore she  cannot be reminded that any one is waiting at the other end.    When the hook is removed with even regularity and a quiet pause  between each motion then she can see the light and accelerate her  action in getting \"the other party.\"    I have seen a man get so impatient at not having an immediate answer  that he rattled the hook up and down so fast and so vehemently as to  nearly break it. There is something tremendously funny about this.  The man is in a great hurry to speak to some one at the other end of  the telephone, and yet he takes every means to prevent the operator  from knowing what he wants by rattling his hook. In addition to this  his angry movement of the hook is fast tending to break the  telephone, so that he cannot use it at all. So do we interfere with  gaining what we need by wanting it overmuch!    I do not know that there has yet been formed a telephone etiquette;  but for the use of those who are not well bred by habit it would be  useful to put such laws on the first page of the telephone book. A  lack of consideration for others is often too evident in telephonic  communication.    A woman will ask her maid to get the number of a friend's house for  her and ask the friend to come to the telephone, and then keep her  friend waiting while she has time to be called by the maid and to  come to the telephone herself. This method of wasting other people's  time is not confined to women alone. Men are equal offenders, and  often greater ones, for the man at the other end is apt to be more  immediately busy than a woman under such circumstances.    To sum up: The telephone may be the means of increasing our  consideration for others; our quiet, decisive way of getting good  service; our patience, and, through the low voice placed close to  the transmitter, it may relieve us from nervous strain; for nerves  always relax with the voice.    Or the telephone may be the means of making us more selfish and  self-centered, more undecided and diffuse, more impatient, more  strained and nervous.    In fact, the telephones may help us toward health or illness. We  might even say the telephone may lead us toward heaven or toward  hell. We have our choice of roads in the way we use it.    It is a blessed convenience and if it proves a curse--we bring the  curse upon our own heads.    I speak of course only of the public who use the telephone. Those  who serve the public in the use of the telephone must have many  trials to meet, and, I dare say, are not always courteous and  patient. But certainly there can be no case of lagging or  discourtesy on the part of a telephone operator that is not promptly  rectified by a quiet, decided appeal to the \"desk.\"    It is invariably the nervous strain and the anger that makes the  trouble.    There may be one of these days a school for the better use of the  telephone; but such a school never need be established if every  intelligent man and woman will be his and her own school in  appreciating and acting upon the power gained if they compel  themselves to go with science--and never allow themselves to go  against it.          CHAPTER XV    _Don't Talk_      THERE is more nervous energy wasted, more nervous strain generated,  more real physical harm done by superfluous talking than any one  knows, or than any one could possibly believe who had not studied  it. I am not considering the harm done by what people say. We all  know the disastrous effects that follow a careless or malicious use  of the tongue. That is another question. I simply write of the  physical power used up and wasted by mere superfluous words, by  using one hundred words where ten will do--or one thousand words  where none at all were needed.    I once had been listening to a friend chatter, chatter, chatter to  no end for an hour or more, when the idea occurred to me to tell her  of an experiment I had tried by which my voice came more easily.  When I could get an opportunity to speak, I asked her if she had  ever tried taking a long breath and speaking as she let the breath  out. I had to insist a little to keep her mind on the suggestion at  all, but finally succeeded. She took a long breath and then stopped.    There was perhaps for half a minute a blessed silence, and then what  was my surprise to hear her remark: \"I--I--can't think of anything  to say.\" \"Try it again,\" I told her. She took another long breath,  and again gave up because she could not think of anything to say.  She did not like that little game very much, and thought she would  not make another effort, and in about three minutes she began the  chatter, and went on talking until some necessary interruption  parted us.    This woman's talking was nothing more nor less than a nervous habit.  Her thought and her words were not practically connected at all. She  never said what she thought for she never thought. She never said  anything in answer to what was said to her, for she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4341"],[0,"Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (#15)"],[1,"  inch or two in height and breadth, the line continuing without  interruption for miles at the edge of the water.\"(35) Myriads of ants  are thus destroyed amidst a nature which might support a hundred times  as many ants as are actually living. Dr. Altum, a German forester, who  wrote a very interesting book about animals injurious to our forests,  also gives many facts showing the immense importance of natural checks.  He says, that a succession of gales or cold and damp weather during the  exodus of the pine-moth (Bombyx pini) destroy it to incredible amounts,  and during the spring of 1871 all these moths disappeared at once,  probably killed by a succession of cold nights.(36) Many like examples  relative to various insects could be quoted from various parts of  Europe. Dr. Altum also mentions the bird-enemies of the pine-moth, and  the immense amount of its eggs destroyed by foxes; but he adds that the  parasitic fungi which periodically infest it are a far more terrible  enemy than any bird, because they destroy the moth over very large areas  at once. As to various species of mice (Mus sylvaticus, Arvicola  arvalis, and A. agrestis), the same author gives a long list of their  enemies, but he remarks: \"However, the most terrible enemies of mice are  not other animals, but such sudden changes of weather as occur almost  every year.\" Alternations of frost and warm weather destroy them in  numberless quantities; \"one single sudden change can reduce thousands of  mice to the number of a few individuals.\" On the other side, a warm  winter, or a winter which gradually steps in, make them multiply in  menacing proportions, notwithstanding every enemy; such was the case in  1876 and 1877.(37) Competition, in the case of mice, thus appears a  quite trifling factor when compared with weather. Other facts to the  same effect are also given as regards squirrels.    As to birds, it is well known how they suffer from sudden changes of  weather. Late snow-storms are as destructive of bird-life on the English  moors, as they are in Siberia; and Ch. Dixon saw the red grouse so  pressed during some exceptionally severe winters, that they quitted the  moors in numbers, \"and we have then known them actually to be taken in  the streets of Sheffield. Persistent wet,\" he adds, \"is almost as fatal  to them.\"    On the other side, the contagious diseases which continually visit most  animal species destroy them in such numbers that the losses often cannot  be repaired for many years, even with the most rapidly-multiplying  animals. Thus, some sixty years ago, the sousliks suddenly disappeared  in the neighbourhood of Sarepta, in South-Eastern Russia, in consequence  of some epidemics; and for years no sousliks were seen in that  neighbourhood. It took many years before they became as numerous as they  formerly were.(38)    Like facts, all tending to reduce the importance given to competition,  could be produced in numbers. Of course, it might be replied, in  Darwin's words, that nevertheless each organic being \"at some period of  its life, during some season of the year, during each generation or at  intervals, has to struggle for life and to suffer great destruction,\"  and that the fittest survive during such periods of hard struggle for  life. But if the evolution of the animal world were based exclusively,  or even chiefly, upon the survival of the fittest during periods of  calamities; if natural selection were limited in its action to periods  of exceptional drought, or sudden changes of temperature, or  inundations, retrogression would be the rule in the animal world. Those  who survive a famine, or a severe epidemic of cholera, or small-pox, or  diphtheria, such as we see them in uncivilized countries, are neither  the strongest, nor the healthiest, nor the most intelligent. No progress  could be based on those survivals--the less so as all survivors usually  come out of the ordeal with an impaired health, like the Transbaikalian  horses just mentioned, or the Arctic crews, or the garrison of a  fortress which has been compelled to live for a few months on half  rations, and comes out of its experience with a broken health, and  subsequently shows a quite abnormal mortality. All that natural  selection can do in times of calamities is to spare the individuals  endowed with the greatest endurance for privations of all kinds. So it  does among the Siberian horses and cattle. They are enduring; they can  feed upon the Polar birch in case of need; they resist cold and hunger.  But no Siberian horse is capable of carrying half the weight which a  European horse carries with ease; no Siberian cow gives half the amount  of milk given by a Jersey cow, and no natives of uncivilized countries  can bear a comparison with Europeans. They may better endure hunger and  cold, but their physical force is very far below that of a well-fed  European, and their intellectual progress is despairingly slow. \"Evil  cannot be productive of good,\" as Tchernyshevsky wrote in a remarkable  essay upon Darwinism.(39)    Happily enough, competition is not the rule either in the animal world  or in mankind. It is limited among animals to exceptional periods, and  natural selection finds better fields for its activity. Better  conditions are created by the elimination of competition by means of  mutual aid and mutual Support.(40) In the great struggle for life--for  the greatest possible fulness and intensity of life with the least waste  of energy--natural selection continually seeks out the ways precisely  for avoiding competition as much as possible. The ants combine in nests  and nations; they pile up their stores, they rear their cattle--and thus  avoid competition; and natural selection picks out of the ants' family  the species which know best how to avoid competition, with its  unavoidably deleterious consequences. Most of our birds slowly move  southwards as the winter comes, or gather in numberless societies and  undertake long journeys--and thus avoid competition. Many rodents fall  asleep when the time comes that competition should set in; while other  rodents store food for the winter, and gather in large villages for  obtaining the necessary protection when at work. The reindeer, when the  lichens are dry in the interior of the continent, migrate towards the  sea. Buffaloes cross an immense continent in order to find plenty of  food. And the beavers, when they grow numerous on a river, divide into  two parties, and go, the old ones down the river, and the young ones up  the river and avoid competition. And when animals can neither fall  asleep, nor migrate, nor lay in stores, nor themselves grow their food  like the ants, they do what the titmouse does, and what Wallace  (Darwinism, ch. v) has so charmingly described: they resort to new kinds  of food--and thus, again, avoid competition.    \"Don't compete!--competition is always injurious to the species, and you  have plenty of resources to avoid it!\" That is the tendency of nature,  not always realized in full, but always present. That is the watchword  which comes to us from the bush, the forest, the river, the ocean.  \"Therefore combine--practise mutual aid! That is the surest means for  giving to each and to all the greatest safety, the best guarantee of  existence and progress, bodily, intellectual, and moral.\" That is what  Nature teaches us; and that is what all those animals which have  attained the highest position in their respective classes have done.  That is also what man--the most primitive man--has been doing; and that  is why man has reached the position upon which we stand now, as we shall  see in the subsequent chapters devoted to mutual aid in human societies.

All birds rose in such case and  attacked the enemy with great vigour. The females, which had five or six  nests together on each knoll of the marsh, kept a certain order in  leaving their nests in search of food. The fledglings, which otherwise  are extremely unprotected and easily become the prey of the rapacious  birds, were never left alone (\"Family Habits among the Aquatic Birds,\"  in Proceedings of the Zool. Section of St. Petersburg Soc. of Nat., Dec.  17, 1874).    5. Brehm Father, quoted by A. Brehm, iv. 34 seq. See also White's  Natural History of Selborne, Letter XI.    6.

It has often been intimated that larger birds may occasionally  transport some of the smaller birds when they cross together the  Mediterranean, but the fact still remains doubtful. On the other side,  it is certain that some smaller birds join the bigger ones for  migration. The fact has been noticed several times, and it was recently  confirmed by L. Buxbaum at Raunheim. He saw several parties of cranes  which had larks flying in the midst and on both sides of their migratory  columns (Der zoologische Garten, 1886, p. 133).    8. H. Seebohm and Ch.
