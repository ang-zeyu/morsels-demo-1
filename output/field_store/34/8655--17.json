He had the manager up,  harangued him, and swore him to secrecy--which the poor manager was  only too glad to agree to, because it wouldn't have done the hotel  any good to have it known. And the manager harangued the servants,  and the servants harangued one another, and everybody talked at the  same time; and father and I promised not to tell a soul; so Lady  Julia doesn't know a word about it to this day. And I don't see why  she ever should--though, one of these days, I've a good mind to tell  Lord Dreever. Think what a hold he would have over them! They'd  never be able to bully him again.\"    \"I shouldn't,\" said Jimmy, trying to keep a touch of coldness out of  his voice. This championship of Lord Dreever, however sweet and  admirable, was a little distressing.    She looked up quickly.    \"You don't think I really meant to, do you?\"    \"No, no,\" said Jimmy, hastily. \"Of course not.\"    \"Well, I should think so!\" said Molly, indignantly. \"After I  promised not to tell a soul about it!\"    Jimmy chuckled.    \"It's nothing,\" he said, in answer to her look of inquiry.    \"You laughed at something.\"    \"Well,\" said Jimmy apologetically, \"it's only--it's nothing really--only,  what I mean is, you have just told one soul a good deal about  it, haven't you?\"    Molly turned pink. Then, she smiled.    \"I don't know how I came to do it,\" she declared. \"It just rushed  out of its own accord. I suppose it is because I know I can trust  you.\"    Jimmy flushed with pleasure. He turned to her, and half-halted, but  she continued to walk on.    \"You can,\" he said, \"but how do you know you can?\"    She seemed surprised.    \"Why--\" she said. She stopped for a moment, and then went on  hurriedly, with a touch of embarrassment. \"Why, how absurd! Of  course, I know. Can't you read faces? I can. Look,\" she said,  pointing, \"now you can see the castle. How do you like it?\"    They had reached a point where the fields sloped sharply downward. A  few hundred yards away, backed by woods, stood the gray mass of  stone which had proved such a kill-joy of old to the Welsh sportsmen  during the pheasant season. Even now, it had a certain air of  defiance. The setting sun lighted the waters of the lake. No figures  were to be seen moving in the grounds. The place resembled a palace  of sleep.    \"Well?\" said Molly.    \"It's wonderful!\"    \"Isn't it! I'm so glad it strikes you like that. I always feel as if  I had invented everything round here. It hurts me if people don't  appreciate it.\"    They went down the hill.    \"By the way,\" said Jimmy, \"are you acting in these theatricals they  are getting up?\"    \"Yes. Are you the other man they were going to get? That's why Lord  Dreever went up to London, to see if he couldn't find somebody. The  man who was going to play one of the parts had to go back to London  on business.\"    \"Poor brute!\" said Jimmy. It seemed to him at this moment that there  was only one place in the world where a man might be even reasonably  happy. \"What sort of part is it? Lord Dreever said I should be  wanted to act. What do I do?\"    \"If you're Lord Herbert, which is the part they wanted a man for,  you talk to me most of the time.\"    Jimmy decided that the piece had been well cast.     The dressing-gong sounded just as they entered the hall. From a  door on the left, there emerged two men, a big man and a little one,  in friendly conversation. The big man's back struck Jimmy as  familiar.    \"Oh, father,\" Molly called. And Jimmy knew where he had seen the  back before.    The two men stopped.    \"Sir Thomas,\" said Molly, \"this is Mr. Pitt.\"    The little man gave Jimmy a rapid glance, possibly with the object  of detecting his more immediately obvious criminal points; then, as  if satisfied as to his honesty, became genial.    \"I am very glad to meet you, Mr. Pitt, very glad,\" he said. \"We have  been expecting you for some time.\"    Jimmy explained that he had lost his way.    \"Exactly. It was ridiculous that you should be compelled to walk,  perfectly ridiculous. It was grossly careless of my nephew not to  let us know that you were coming. My wife told him so in the car.\"    \"I bet she did,\" said Jimmy to himself. \"Really,\" he said aloud, by  way of lending a helping hand to a friend in trouble, \"I preferred  to walk. I have not been on a country road since I landed in  England.\" He turned to the big man, and held out his hand. \"I don't  suppose you remember me, Mr. McEachern? We met in New York.\"    \"You remember the night Mr. Pitt scared away our burglar, father,\"  said Molly.    Mr. McEachern was momentarily silent. On his native asphalt, there  are few situations capable of throwing the New York policeman off  his balance. In that favored clime, savoir faire is represented by a  shrewd blow of the fist, and a masterful stroke with the truncheon  amounts to a satisfactory repartee. Thus shall you never take the  policeman of Manhattan without his answer. In other surroundings,  Mr. McEachern would have known how to deal with the young man whom  with such good reason he believed to be an expert criminal. But  another plan of action was needed here. First and foremost, of all  the hints on etiquette that he had imbibed since he entered this  more reposeful life, came the maxim: \"Never make a scene.\" Scenes,  he had gathered, were of all things what polite society most  resolutely abhorred. The natural man in him must be bound in chains.  The sturdy blow must give way to the honeyed word. A cold, \"Really!\"  was the most vigorous retort that the best circles would  countenance. It had cost Mr. McEachern some pains to learn this  lesson, but he had done it. He shook hands, and gruffly acknowledged  the acquaintanceship.    \"Really, really!\" chirped Sir Thomas, amiably. \"So, you find  yourself among old friends, Mr. Pitt.\"    \"Old friends,\" echoed Jimmy, painfully conscious of the  ex-policeman's eyes, which were boring holes in him.    \"Excellent, excellent! Let me take you to your room. It is just  opposite my own. This way.\"    In his younger days, Sir Thomas had been a floor-walker of no mean  caliber. A touch of the professional still lingered in his brisk  movements. He preceded Jimmy upstairs with the restrained suavity  that can be learned in no other school.    They parted from Mr. McEachern on the first landing, but Jimmy could  still feel those eyes. The policeman's stare had been of the sort  that turns corners, goes upstairs, and pierces walls.          CHAPTER XIII    SPIKE'S VIEWS      Nevertheless, it was in an exalted frame of mind that Jimmy dressed  for dinner. It seemed to him that he had awakened from a sort of  stupor. Life, so gray yesterday, now appeared full of color and  possibilities. Most men who either from choice or necessity have  knocked about the world for any length of time are more or less  fatalists. Jimmy was an optimistic fatalist. He had always looked on  Fate, not as a blind dispenser at random of gifts good and bad, but  rather as a benevolent being with a pleasing bias in his own favor.  He had almost a Napoleonic faith in his star. At various periods of  his life (notably at the time when, as he had told Lord Dreever, he  had breakfasted on bird-seed), he had been in uncommonly tight  corners, but his luck had always extricated him. It struck him that  it would be an unthinkable piece of bad sportsmanship on Fate's part  to see him through so much, and then to abandon him just as he had  arrived in sight of what was by far the biggest thing of his life.  Of course, his view of what constituted the biggest thing in life  had changed with the years. Every ridge of the Hill of Supreme  Moments in turn had been mistaken by him for the summit; but this  last, he felt instinctively, was genuine. For good or bad, Molly was  woven into the texture of his life. In the stormy period of the  early twenties, he had thought the same of other girls, who were now  mere memories as dim as those of figures in a half-forgotten play.  In their case, his convalescence had been temporarily painful, but  brief. Force of will and an active life had worked the cure. He had  merely braced himself, and firmly ejected them from his mind. A week  or two of aching emptiness, and his heart had been once more in  readiness, all nicely swept and garnished, for the next lodger.    But, in the case of Molly, it was different. He had passed the age  of instantaneous susceptibility. Like a landlord who has been  cheated by previous tenants, he had become wary. He mistrusted his  powers of recuperation in case of disaster. The will in these  matters, just like the mundane \"bouncer,\" gets past its work. For  some years now, Jimmy had had a feeling that the next arrival would  come to stay; and he had adopted in consequence a gently defensive  attitude toward the other sex. Molly had broken through this, and he  saw that his estimate of his will-power had been just. Methods that  had proved excellent in the past were useless now. There was no  trace here of the dimly consoling feeling of earlier years, that  there were other girls in the world. He did not try to deceive  himself. He knew that he had passed the age when a man can fall in  love with any one of a number of types.    This was the finish, one way or the other. There would be no second  throw. She had him. However it might end, he belonged to her.    There are few moments in a man's day when his brain is more  contemplative than during that brief space when he is lathering his  face, preparatory to shaving. Plying the brush, Jimmy reviewed the  situation. He was, perhaps, a little too optimistic. Not  unnaturally, he was inclined to look upon his luck as a sort of  special train which would convey him without effort to Paradise.  Fate had behaved so exceedingly handsomely up till now! By a series  of the most workmanlike miracles, it had brought him to the point of  being Molly's fellow-guest at a country-house."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40780"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: King AEthelbert - King George III, 600 A.D. - 1776 (#15)"],[1,"  great earls, the majority of bishops, some abbots, and a number of  thegns and clerics. Edward had a witan of wise men to advise him, but  sometimes the King would speak in the hall after dinner and listen to  what comments were made from the mead-benches. As the court moved about  the country, many men came to pay their respects and attend to local  business. Edward started the practice of King's touching people to cure  them of scrofula, a disease which affected the glands, especially in  the head and neck. It was done in the context of a religious ceremony.            The main governmental activities were: war, collection of  revenue, religious education, and administration of justice. For war,  the shires had to provide a certain number of men and the ports quotas  of ships with crews. The king was the patron of the English church. He  gave the church peace and protection. He presided over church councils  and appointed bishops. As for the administration of justice, the public  courts were almost all under members of Edward's court, bishops, earls,  and reeves. Edward's mind was often troubled and disturbed by the  threat that law and justice would be overthrown, by the pervasiveness  of disputes and discord, by the raging of wicked presumption, by money  interfering with right and justice, and by avarice kindling all of  these. He saw it as his duty to courageously oppose the wicked by  taking good men as models, by enriching the churches of God, by  relieving those oppressed by wicked judges, and by judging equitably  between the powerful and the humble. He was so greatly revered that a  comet was thought to accompany his death.            The king established the office of the Chancery to draft  documents and keep records. It created the writ, which was a small  piece of parchment [sheep skin] addressed to a royal official or  dependent commanding him to perform some task for the King. By the  1000s A.D., the writ contained a seal: a lump of wax with the impress  of the Great Seal of England which hung from the bottom of the  document. Writing was done with a sharpened goose-wing quill. Ink was  obtained from mixing fluid from the galls made by wasps for their eggs  on oak trees, rainwater or vinegar, gum arabic, and iron salts for  color.            A King's grant of land entailed two documents: a charter giving  boundaries and conditions and a writ, usually addressed to the shire  court, listing the judicial and financial privileges conveyed with the  land. These were usually sac [jurisdiction of a lord to hold court and  to impose fines and amercements] and soke [jurisdiction of a private  court of a noble or institution to execute the laws and administer  justice over inhabitants and tenants of the estate], toll [right to  have a market and to collect a payment on the sale of cattle and other  property on one's own estate] and team [a privilege granted by royal  charter to the lord of a manor for the having, restraining, and judging  of villeins with their children, goods, and chattels], and  infangenetheof [the authority to hang and take the chattels of a thief  caught on his estate].            The town of Coventry consisted of a large monastery estate,  headed by an abbot, and a large private estate headed by a lord. The  monastery was granted by Edward the Confessor full freedom and these  jurisdictions: sac and soke, toll and team, hamsocne [the authority to  fine a person for breaking into and making entry by force into the  dwelling of another], forestall [the authority to fine a person for  robbing others on the road], bloodwite [the authority to impose a  forfeiture for assault involving bloodshed], fightwite [the authority  to fine for fighting], weordwite [the authority to fine for  manslaughter, but not for willful murder], and mundbryce [the authority  to fine for any breach of the peace, such as trespass on lands].            Every man was expected to have a lord to whom he gave fealty.  He swore by a fealty oath such as: \"By the Lord, before whom this relic  is holy, I will be to faithful and true, and love all that he loves,  and shun all that he shuns, according to God's law, and according to  the world's principle, and never, by will nor by force, by word nor by  work, do ought of what is loathful to him; on condition that he keep me  as I am willing to deserve, and all that fulfill that our agreement  was, when I to him submitted and chose his will.\" If a man was homeless  or lordless, his brothers were expected to find him such, e.g. in the  folkmote. Otherwise, he was to be treated as a fugitive and could be  slain, and anyone who had harbored him would pay a penalty. Brothers  were also expected to protect their minor kinsmen. When the oath of  fealty was sworn, the man usually did homage to this lord symbolized by  holding his hands together between those of his lord.            Marriages were determined by men asking women to marry them. If  a woman said yes, he paid a sum to her kin for her \"mund\" [jurisdiction  or protection over her] and gave his oath to them to maintain and  support the woman and any children born. As security for this oath, he  gave a valuable object or \"wed\". The couple were then betrothed.  Marriage ceremonies were performed by priests in churches. The groom  had to bring friends to his wedding as sureties to guarantee his oath  to maintain and support his wife and children. Those who swore to take  care of the children were called their \"godfathers\". The marriage was  written into church records. After witnessing the wedding, friends ate  the great loaf, or first bread made by the bride. This was the  forerunner of the wedding cake. They drank special ale, the \"bride ale\"  (from hence the work \"bridal\"), to the health of the couple.            Women could own land, houses, and furniture and other property.  They could even make wills that disinherited their sons. This marriage  agreement with an Archbishop's sister provides her with land, money,  and horsemen:            \"Here in this document is stated the agreement which Wulfric  and the archbishop made when he obtained the archbishop's sister as his  wife, namely he promised her the estates at Orleton and Ribbesford for  her lifetime, and promised her that he would obtain the estate at  Knightwick for her for three lives from the community at Winchcombe,  and gave her the estate at Alton to grant and bestow upon whomsoever  she pleased during her lifetime or at her death, as she preferred, and  promised her 50 mancuses of gold and 30 men and 30 horses.  The witnesses that this agreement was made as stated were Archbishop  Wulfstan and Earl Leofwine and Bishop AEthelstan and Abbot AElfweard  and the monk Brihtheah and many good men in addition to them, both  ecclesiastics and laymen. There are two copies of this agreement, one  in the possession of the archbishop at Worcester and the other in the  possession of Bishop AEthelstan at Hereford.\"            This marriage agreement provided the wife with money, land,  farm animals and farm laborers; it also names sureties, the survivor of  whom would receive all this property:    \"Here is declared in this document the agreement which Godwine made  with Brihtric when he wooed his daughter. In the first place he gave  her a pound's weight of gold, to induce her to accept his suit, and he  granted her the estate at Street with all that belongs to it, and 150  acres at Burmarsh and in addition 30 oxen and 20 cows and 10 horses and  10 slaves.  This agreement was made at Kingston before King Cnut, with the  cognizance of Archbishop Lyfing and the community at Christchurch, and  Abbot AElfmaer and the community at St. Augustine's, and the sheriff  AEthelwine and Sired the old and Godwine, Wulfheah's son, and AElfsige  cild and Eadmaer of Burham and Godwine, Wulfstan's son, and Carl, the  King's cniht. And when the maiden was brought from Brightling AElfgar,  Sired's son, and Frerth, the priest of Forlstone, and the priests  Leofwine and Wulfsige from Dover, and Edred, Eadhelm's son, and  Leofwine, Waerhelm's son, and Cenwold rust and Leofwine, son of Godwine  of Horton, and Leofwine the Red and Godwine, Eadgifu's son, and  Leofsunu his brother acted as security for all this. And whichever of  them lives the longer shall succeed to all the property both in land  and everything else which I have given them. Every trustworthy man in  Kent and Sussex, whether thegn or commoner, is cognizant of these terms.  There are three of these documents; one is at Christchurch, another at  St. Augustine's, and Brihtric himself has the third.\"            Nuns and monks lived in segregated nunneries and monasteries on  church land and grew their own food. The local bishop usually was also  an abbot of a monastery. The priests and nuns wore long robes with  loose belts and did not carry weapons. Their life was ordered by the  ringing of the bell to start certain activities, such as prayer; meals;  meetings; work in the fields, gardens, or workshops; and copying and  illuminating books. They chanted to pay homage and to communicate with  God or his saints. They taught justice, piety, chastity, peace, and  charity; and cared for the sick. Caring for the sick entailed mostly  praying to God as it was thought that only God could cure. They bathed  a few times a year. They got their drinking water from upstream of  where they had located their latrines over running water. The large  monasteries had libraries, dormitories, guesthouses, kitchens,  butteries to store wine, bakehouses, breweries, dairies, granaries,  barns, fishponds, orchards, vineyards, gardens, workshops, laundries,  lavatories with long stone or marble washing troughs, and towels.  Slavery was diminished by the church by excommunication for the sale of  a child over seven. The clergy taught that manumission of slaves was  good for the soul of the dead, so it became frequent in wills. The  clergy were to abstain"]]]
