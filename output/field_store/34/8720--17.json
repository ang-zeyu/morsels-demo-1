THE USE OF FREEDOM AND HUMAN JUDGMENT. I think that in the realms of  liberty, and the exercise of human judgment all men should exercise  extreme caution, that they do not change nor abolish those things  which God has willed and has inspired to be done. It has been in this  realm of freedom, and the exercise of human judgment that most of the  evils that have occurred in the world have been done--the martyrdom  of Saints, the crucifixion of the Son of God himself, and much of the  apostasy and departure from the work of righteousness, and from the  laws of God, have occurred in this realm of freedom and the exercise  of human judgment. God in his boundless wisdom and gracious mercy has  provided means, and has shown the way to the children of men whereby,  even in the realms of freedom and the exercise of their own judgment,  they may individually go unto God in faith and prayer, and find out  what should guide and direct their human judgment and wisdom; and I do  not want the Latter-day Saints to forget that this is their privilege.  I would rather that they should seek God for a counselor and guide,  than to follow the wild harangues of political leaders, or leaders of  any other cult.--_Oct. C. R.,_ 1912, pp. 41-42.    LATTER-DAY SAINTS SHOULD EXERCISE FREE AGENCY. We desire that the  Latter-day Saints will exercise the liberty {60} wherewith they have  been made free by the gospel of Jesus Christ; for they are entitled  to know the right from the wrong, to see the truth and draw the  line between it and error; and it is their privilege to judge for  themselves and to act upon their own free agency with regard to their  choice as to sustaining or otherwise those who should exercise the  presiding functions among them. We desire the Latter-day Saints at this  conference to exercise their prerogative, which is, to vote as the  Spirit of the Lord prompts them on the measures and the men that may be  presented unto them.--_Apr. C. R.,_ 1904, p. 73.    HOW TO OBTAIN BLESSINGS OF GOD. There are blessings which pertain to  the gospel of Jesus Christ and to the world to come, which cannot be  secured by personal influence, nor be bought with money, and which  no man by his own intelligence or wisdom can obtain except through  compliance with certain ordinances, laws and commandments which  have been given. And it is well, in my judgment, for the Latter-day  Saints to continue to bear in mind that the inestimable blessings of  the gospel have been bestowed upon them through their faith, that a  remission of sins has been obtained by baptism and repentance, and that  it is only through continuing faithful that they can retain the gifts  and blessings which pertain to eternal life. There are many blessings,  however, which are common to the human family, which all enjoy, without  regard to their moral status or religious convictions. God has given  to all men an agency and has granted to us the privilege to serve him  or serve him not, to do that which is right or that which is wrong,  and this privilege is given to all men irrespective of creed, color or  condition. The wealthy have this agency, the poor have this agency,  and no man is deprived by any power of God from exercising it in the  fullest and in the freest manner. This agency has been given to all.  This is a blessing that God has bestowed upon the world of mankind,  upon all {61} his children alike. But he will hold us strictly to an  account for the use that we make of this agency, and as it was said  of Cain, so it will be said of us; \"If thou doest well, shalt thou  not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door.\"  There are, however, certain blessings which God bestows upon the  children of men only upon the condition of the rightful exercise of  this agency. For instance, no man can obtain a remission of his sins  but by repentance, and baptism by one having authority. If we would  be free from sin, from its effects, from its power, we must obey this  law which God has revealed, or we never can obtain a remission of  sins. Therefore, while God has bestowed upon all men, irrespective  of condition, this agency to choose good or evil, he has not and  will not bestow upon the children of men a remission of sins but by  their obedience to law. Therefore, the whole world lies in sin and is  under condemnation, inasmuch as light has come unto the world and men  will not place themselves in a proper position before the Lord. And  this condemnation rests with tenfold force upon all who have yielded  obedience to this law, and have once received a remission of their  sins, but have returned unto sin, and have forgotten or disregarded the  covenants they made in the waters of baptism. All men are blessed with  the strength of their bodies, with the use of their minds, and with the  right to exercise the faculties with which they are endowed in a way  that seemeth good to their sight, without regard to religion. But God  has not and will not suffer the gift of the Holy Ghost to be bestowed  upon any man or woman, except through compliance with the laws of God.  Therefore, no man can obtain a remission of sins; no man can obtain the  gift of the Holy Ghost; no man can obtain the revelations of God; no  man can obtain the priesthood, and the rights, powers and privileges  thereof; no man can become an heir of God and a joint heir with Jesus  Christ, except through compliance with the requirements of heaven.  These are universal {62} blessings, they are great and inestimable  privileges which pertain to the gospel and to the plan of life and  salvation, which are open and free to all on certain conditions, but  which no persons beneath the heavens can enjoy, but through walking  in the channel that God has marked out by which they can obtain them.  And these privileges and blessings when obtained may be forfeited, and  perhaps lost for all eternity, unless we continue steadfast in the  course that is marked out for us to pursue. It is well, in my judgment,  that the Latter-day Saints do not lose sight of the great privilege  that has been bestowed upon them. No man can become a citizen of the  kingdom of God but by entering in at the door; there are thousands  and tens of thousands, aye, millions of people who will never become  citizens of the kingdom of God in this world, because they fail to  exercise the agency and the power that have been given to them, in the  right direction. Nevertheless, they enjoy many of the blessings that  are bestowed upon the world in common. The sun shines upon the evil  and the good; but the Holy Ghost descends only upon the righteous and  upon those who are forgiven of their sins. The rain descends upon the  evil and upon the good; but the rights of the priesthood are conferred,  and the doctrine of the Priesthood distils as the dews of heaven  upon the souls of those only who receive it in God's own appointed  way. The favor of heaven, the acknowledgment of the Almighty of his  children upon the earth as his sons and his daughters, can only be  secured through obedience to the laws which he has revealed. Riches,  or the wealth of the world, cannot purchase these things. Simon Magus  desired to purchase the power to bestow the Holy Ghost, but Peter said  unto him, \"Thy money perish with thee.\" These blessings, powers and  privileges are not to be purchased except by the atonement of Christ;  they are not to be obtained by personal influence, wealth, position or  power, or in any other way except the {63} direct way in which God has  decreed that they should be obtained. Now, so long as the Latter-day  Saints are content to obey the commandments of God, to appreciate the  privileges and blessings which they enjoy in the Church, and will use  their time, their substance, in honor to the name of God, to build up  Zion, and to establish truth and righteousness in the earth, so long  our heavenly Father is bound by his oath and covenant to protect them  from every opposing foe, and to help them to overcome every obstacle  that can possibly be arrayed against them, or thrown in their pathway;  but the moment a community begin to be wrapt up in themselves, become  selfish, become engrossed in the temporalities of life, and put their  faith in riches, that moment the power of God begins to withdraw from  them, and if they repent not the Holy Spirit will depart from them  entirely, and they will be left to themselves. That which was given  them will be taken away, they will lose that which they had, for they  will not be worthy of it. God is just, as well as merciful, and we need  not expect favors at the hand of the Almighty except as we merit them,  at least in the honest desires of our hearts; and the desire and intent  will not always avail unless our acts correspond. For we are engaged  in a literal work, a reality; and we must practice as well as profess.  We must be what God requires us to be, or else we are not his people,  nor the Zion which he designs to gather together and to build up in the  latter days upon the earth.--_Journal of Discourses,_ Vol. 24, 1884,  pp. 173-178.    {64}        CHAPTER V    GOD AND MAN    GOD HAS DIRECTED HIS LATTER-DAY WORK. It has not been by the wisdom  of man that this people have been directed in their course until the  present; it has been by the wisdom of him who is above man, whose  knowledge is greater than that of man, and whose power is above the  power of man; for it is unto God, our Father, we are indebted for the  mercies we have enjoyed and for the present prosperous condition of  the people of God throughout this intermountain region and throughout  the world.

Meanwhile the  37th had pushed forward and gained some kopjes in front. Here they  came in touch with General Babington's column. Thus the two columns  practically met, and then Delarey, Smuts, and De Camp drew up the bulk  of their forces on highly advantageous ground on Methuen's right front  and Babington's left. Wheeling his mounted troops round into position,  Lord Methuen began to attack the enemy without delay, but the position  in front was deemed almost impregnable. I saw swarms of mounted Boers  on the hillside, and several rode down to try to draw us on to the  attack. The general quickly ordered Colonel Meyrick, who was in  command of the Yeomanry, to execute a flank movement on the right,  leaving General Babington to take the matter in hand on the other  side. Hereabouts the 37th rejoined the main body after a long gallop,  and again took up their original position at the head of the regiment.  Colonel Meyrick led his men along at a smart pace, and as we breasted  a rise in the road we viewed several Boers breaking away across the  open. Soon afterwards the brigadier sent the 5th out on the right,  whilst he himself led the main body to the left with the idea of  driving the enemy from his positions in front. The Boers, however, did  not show much inclination to fight.    \"All the time Colonel Meyrick was being seconded by Colonel Lawson of  the 10th, who now dismounted his men and led them to the attack. A few  volleys sufficed, however, for at this moment a pom-pom made its  appearance on the scene, and after waiting long enough to receive a  few well-directed shells from it the Boers gave way and galloped off  in little parties as hard as they could go. In a few minutes the  Yeomanry were in hot pursuit of the enemy. 'Ware hole' was a constant  cry all day long, and casualties occurred from the treacherous state  of the ground. Now before us lay a vast plain, beyond which was a long  straggling range of kopjes. Thither the Boers had retreated in haste.  The 5th were still on our right, and I saw a body of mounted men on  our left. All the troops Colonel Meyrick had with him were Colonel  Lawson and four broken squadrons of the 10th. But there was no drawing  rein. Four men were sent forward to scout the country on the left  front and four somewhere else. The remainder galloped to the left  flank. Hereabouts some troops were detached from the main body in  order to capture some waggons; and a few minutes later two men of the  37th--Nichols and Brown--who had been sent forward to reconnoitre,  captured a gun (a twelve-pounder, O Battery, Royal Horse Artillery,  lost at Colenso). Three Boers were in charge of it, but one  immediately took to his heels and escaped, and the other two--two  beardless boys--were too much out of breath with their efforts of  whipping up and shouting at the jaded team of mules to do anything but  throw up their arms. One of the youngsters burst into tears when he  was disarmed.    \"Notwithstanding all this, the two colonels still kept up the pursuit,  and came across some more waggons four miles ahead. Here, however, the  enemy were in strong numbers, and a few of our men fell foul of some  Boers in a mealie field, but miraculously escaped. Soon afterwards the  officer commanding received a message from the General recalling him,  but it was not till then that Colonel Meyrick led back his scanty  followers to escort the plunder into camp. It was a curious procession  that wended its way across the veldt. Jolting along in front were  several captured waggons with a slender escort. Then came Colonel  Meyrick, on his good dun horse, with his injured arm still in a sling,  followed by his orderlies. Next in order a pom-pom and the captured  gun, which was being driven along by the two ragged Dutch boys; two  waggons, a Cape cart, and an ambulance waggon, the officers and the  remnant of the 10th bringing up the rear. Just before we reached camp  we passed Lord Methuen, sitting on the ground, writing his despatches.  The troops bivouacked near Paarde Plaats (where Methuen captured  Sellers's laager a short time ago), after having been in the saddle or  on foot for twelve hours.    \"Next morning the mounted troops marched as far as Hartebeestefontein,  and the men took advantage of a brief halt in the picturesque village  to loot oranges, of which there were any quantity in the orchards and  gardens, though mostly green ones. Eventually the troops bivouacked  about six miles from the village. The General ordered a rest on the  next day; but afterwards the men did some very heavy marching in order  to keep in touch with the other columns. Although Babington made  another big haul and Rawlinson shelled the Boers, Methuen did not get  another chance of having a smack at the enemy. The column reached  Mafeking on Sunday, 12th inst.--a cold, dusty morning.    \"Lord Methuen's old yeomen entrained at Mafeking _en route_ for the  south at 1 P.M. yesterday, 14th inst. The General himself paid his  'old comrades-in-arms' the high compliment of coming down to the  station in order to see them off. He met with a splendid ovation, and  was carried shoulder-high and safely deposited on a temporary platform  amidst rounds of applause. Then every yeoman pressed eagerly forward  to shake the outstretched hand of their gallant leader. Lord Methuen  seemed deeply impressed with the enthusiastic reception accorded him.  But it was the only way we had of expressing our gratitude and  admiration. There was no speech.\"    The above letter describes not only the last operations but the last  farewell of the \"Old Yeomanry.\" Before parting with them, some  statistics regarding the brave and serviceable men who were leaving  the scene of their activities may not be out of place.    According to the official record of the casualties in South Africa  during the twelve months ending March 27, the Imperial Yeomanry losses  had been 185 killed, 642 wounded, 388 died of disease, 49 died of  wounds, 571 invalided; deaths from accidents, 20; missing, 205;  prisoners, 497--total, 2557. The majority of the missing had  reappeared, and the prisoners were released. At the end of July 1900,  the strength of the Yeomanry in South Africa was: 536 officers, 10,195  men--total, 10,731; in February, before the reinforcements had  arrived, the strength had been reduced to 495 officers, 7500  men--total, 7995; on May 1 the figures read 800 officers, 22,304  men--total, 23,104. The Imperial Yeomanry Hospitals had also done  invaluable work. Both Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener eulogised the  scheme, and the most eminent surgeons endorsed the opinions of the  military authorities. The movement, it may be remembered, was started  by Lady Georgiana Curzon (now Countess Howe), and an influential  committee was appointed to carry out the work. The total record of  patients treated at Deelfontein, Mackenzie's Farm (now taken over by  the Government), Pretoria, and Bloemfontein, and by the Field Hospital  up to the middle of May was 17,070. During April, May, and June, the  whole of the original force (together with the Australian and New  Zealand contingents) was withdrawn from the country and their places,  in course of time, were taken by 16,000 new yeomen and new Colonial  contingents, but these, though apt and willing, were naturally  incapable of filling at once the huge gap made by the loss of these  trained and seasoned men.           *       *       *       *       *    To resume. During April, energetic measures were set on foot in  Namaqualand by Colonel Smith and Colonel Shelton. Colonel Shelton had  now organised a field column to work in the arid district,  Bushmanland, the first contingent of sixty men and three officers,  commanded by Captain Montagu, having started to reinforce the advance  post at Agenthuis, which was held by Lieutenant Rich and a small  patrol. These, meanwhile, were attacked by the enemy, and fought with  them for five hours. They then had to evacuate the place.    Zeerust was still in a state of siege, but the North Lancashire  Regiment and some Yeomen engaged the raiders and gave them a warm day,  fighting being pursued with unabated zeal from daylight till dusk. The  New Zealanders next shelled the Boers' meeting-place and disturbed  their little plans, and showed them that the inconvenience of the  besieged might be shared by the besiegers. A party of the North  Lancashires surprised the Boers and wounded three of their number, and  later, on the 29th, driven desperate by want of sufficient provisions,  the scouts made a grand sortie, and captured a plentiful supply of  oxen.    Everywhere in the west there was unrest, owing to the damage created  by the desperadoes. Belmont Station was attacked and the telegraph  instruments damaged, and in the Montzani district Captain Tupper,  Liverpool Regiment, and twelve men had an unpleasant time near  Taaiboshpan, but gained the day after three hours' fighting. Elsewhere  Lieutenant Barton (Bedfordshire Regiment) found himself surrounded in  a farm. A day of tussle was spent there, but in the night the British  escaped. Colonel Walford thereupon set himself to work to scour and  purge the district.      APRIL. ORANGE RIVER COLONY--OPERATIONS OF GENERAL BRUCE-HAMILTON AND  GENERAL RUNDLE    Now that the Boers, in small bands, were being forced northward from  Cape Colony and from Kruitzinger's hunting-ground, preparations were  made near Bethulie and along the Orange River for their reception. To  this end General Lyttelton moved the troops of General Bruce-Hamilton  and Colonel Hickman from Dewetsdorp and Wepener, and these--in  conjunction with Colonel Haig's columns--were so ranged by the 5th  April, as to defeat any great incursion of marauders into the Orange  River Colony.
