But they would not  come. And when the Father of the household heard this, He said to  His Servant: \"Compel them to come in, that My house may be filled.\"  Then that Servant thought within Himself: \"How shall I be able  without violence to compel these men to come, that rebellion may be  avoided and yet that their privilege and power of free will may  remain unimpaired? For if I compel them to come by iron chains, and  blows, and whips, I shall have asses and not men.\" Then He said to  Himself: \"I perceive that man is so constituted as to be prone to  love. Therefore I will show him such love as shall pass all his  understanding, love than which no other love can be greater. If man  will observe this, he will be so caught in its toils, that he will  not be able to escape its heat and flame, and will be constrained to  turn to God, and love Him in return. For, turn where he will, he  will always be met by the immeasurable benefits, the infinite  goodness, and the wonderful love of God; and at the same time he  will feel more and more compelled to return love for love, till he  will be no more able to resist it, and will be gently constrained to  follow.\" When this was done, Jesus Christ, this faithful and wise  Servant, said to His Lord and Father, \"It is finished. I have  finished the work which Thou gavest Me to do. What more could I have  done, and have not done it? I have no member left that is not weary  and worn with toil and pain. My veins are dry, My blood is shed; My  marrow is spent, My throat is hoarse with crying. Such love have I  shown to man, that his heart cannot be human, cannot even be stony,  or the heart of a brute beast, but must be quite devilish and  desperate, if it be not moved by the thought of these things.\"    Moreover, this word of our Lord Jesus is a word of sorrow, not of  joy. He spoke it not as if He had now escaped from all His  suffering. No; when He said, \"It is finished,\" He meant all that had  been ordained and decreed by the eternal Truth for Him to suffer.  Besides, all the sufferings which had been inflicted upon Him by  degrees and singly, He now endures together with immeasurable  anguish. Who can have such a heart of adamant as not to be moved by  such torment as this? How short were the words which our Lord Jesus  spoke on the Cross, yet how full of sacramental mysteries! Now were  fulfilled the words of Exodus: \"And all things were finished which  belonged to the sacrifice of the Lord.\"    Moreover by this word our Lord declared the glorious victory of the  Passion, and how the old enemy, the jealous serpent, was overcome  and thrown down; for this was the cause for which He suffered. For  this He had taken upon Himself the garment of human nature, that He  might vanquish and confound the enemy, by the same weapons wherewith  the enemy boasted that he had conquered man. This was the chief  purpose of His Passion, and now He confesses that it is finished. O  how wonderful are the mysteries, and the victories, included in this  little but deep word: \"It is finished!\" All that the eternal Wisdom  had decreed, all that strict justice had demanded for each man, all  that love had asked for, all the promises made to the fathers, all  the mysteries, types, ceremonies in Scripture, all that was meet and  necessary for our redemption, all that was needed to wipe out our  debts, all that must repair our negligences, all that was glorious  and loving for the exhibition of this splendid love, all that we  could desire, for our spiritual instruction--in a word, all that was  good and fitting for the celebration of the glorious triumph of our  redemption, all is included in that one word, \"It is finished.\"  What, then, remains for Him, but to finish and perfect His life in  this glorious conflict; and, because nothing remains for Him to do,  to commend His precious soul into His Father's hands, seeing that He  has fought the good fight, and finished His course in all holiness?  It is meet, then, that He should obtain the crown of glory which His  heavenly Father will give Him on the day of His exaltation.    Lastly, by this word Christ offered up all His toil, sorrow, and  affliction for all the elect, as the Apostle saith: \"Who in the days  of His flesh offered up prayer and supplications with strong crying  and tears unto Him who was able to save Him from death, and was  heard in that He feared. For if the blood of bulls and of goats and  the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the  purifying of the flesh, how much more shall the blood of Christ, who  through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God,  purge our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?\"    THE SEVENTH WORD    OUR Lord Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and said, \"Father,  into Thy hands I commend My Spirit.\" O all ye who love our Lord  Jesus Christ, come, I beseech you, and let us watch, with all  devotion and pity, His passing away. Let us see what must have been  His sorrow and agony and torment, when His glorious soul was now at  last forced to pass out of His worthy and most sacred body, in which  for thirty and three years it had rested so sweetly, peacefully,  joyfully, and holily, even as two lovers on one bed. How hard was it  for them to be rent asunder, between whom no disagreement had ever  arisen, no strife, or quarrel, or treachery. How unspeakably  grievous was that Cross, when His sacred body was compelled to part  with so faithful a friend, so gentle an occupant, so loving a  teacher and master; and how great was the sorrow with which His  glorious and pure soul was torn away from so faithful a servant,  which had ever served obediently, never sparing any trouble, never  shrinking from cold or heat or hunger or thirst; always enduring  labour and sorrow in gentleness and patience. O how great was this  affliction! For, as the philosopher says: \"Of all terrible things  death is the most terrible, on account of the natural and mutual  affection, which is very great, between soul and body.\" How much  greater must have been the anguish and sorrow, when the most holy  soul and body of Christ were sundered, between which there had  always been such wonderful harmony and love. Therefore, with inward  pity and anxious sorrow, let us meditate on this sad parting; for  the death of Christ is our life.    Let us meditate devoutly how His sacred body, the instrument of our  salvation, was steeped in anguish, when all His members, as if to  bid a last farewell, were bowing themselves down to die! Who can  look without remorse and sorrow and pity upon the most gracious face  of Christ, and behold how it is changed into the pallor and likeness  of death; how tears still flow from His dimmed eyes; how His sacred  head is bent; how all His members prove to us, by signs and motions,  the love which they can no longer show by deeds. Let us pity Him, I  pray you, for He is our own flesh and blood, and it is for our sins,  not His own, that He is shamefully slain. O ye who up till now have  passed by the Cross of Jesus with tepid or cold hearts, and whom all  these torments and tears, and His blood shed like water, have not  been able to soften; now at last let this loud voice, this terrible  cry, rend and pierce your hearts through and through. Let that voice  which shook the heaven and the earth and hell with fear, which rent  the rocks and laid open ancient graves, now soften your stony  hearts, and lay bare the old sepulchres of your conscience, full of  dead men's bones--that is to say, of wicked deeds, and call again  into life your departed spirits. For this is the voice which once  cried: \"Adam, where art thou; and what hast thou done?\" This is the  voice which brought Lazarus from Hades, saying, \"Lazarus, come  forth: arise from the grave of sin, and let them free thee from thy  grave-clothes.\" Truly it was not so much the grievousness of His  sufferings, as the greatness of our sins, which made our Lord utter  this cry. He cried also, to show that He had the dominion over life  and death, over the living and the dead. For though he was quite  worn out, and destitute of strength, and though He had borne the  bitter pangs of death so long, beyond the power of man, yet He would  not allow Death to put forth its power against Him, until it pleased  Him.    With a loud voice He cried, that earthly men, who care only for the  things of earth, might quake with fear and trembling, and to cause  them to meditate and see how naked and helpless the Lord of lords  departed from this life. With a terrible voice He cried, to stir up  all those who live in wantonness, and who have grown old in their  defilement, and send forth a foul savour, like dead dogs, so that at  last these miserable men may rise from their lusts and pleasures and  sensual delights, and see how the Son of God, who was never strained  with any spot of defilement, went forth to His Father; and with what  toil and pain and anguish He departed from the light of day, and  what He had to suffer before He reached his Father's Kingdom. He  also cried with a loud voice, that He might inflame the lukewarm and  slothful to devotion and love.    Moreover He cried with a loud voice as a sign of the glorious  victory which He had gained, when after a single combat with His  strong and cruel enemy, and having descended into the arena--the  battlefield of this world--He had routed him on Mount Calvary and  stripped him bare of his spoils. This victory, this glorious  triumph, Christ proclaimed with a loud voice, and thus departing  from the battlefield triumphant and victorious, He departed to the  place of all delights, to the heart and breast of God, His Father,  commending to it, as to a safe refuge, both Himself and all His own,  with the words, \"Father, into Thy hands I commend My"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4667"],[0,"Seven Wives and Seven Prisons (#15)"],[1,"hole and  asked me if I would come out and work.    \"No, no!\" I always answered, \"never!\" Then I paced the stone floor in  the dark, or lay on my straw. I lay there till my hips were worn raw.  No human being can conceive the agony, the suffering endured in this  dungeon. At last I was nearly blind, and was scarcely able to stand up.  I presume that the attendant who brought my daily dole of bread and my  cup of water, reported my condition. One day the door opened and I was  ordered out. They were obliged to bring me out; I was so reduced that I  was but the shadow of myself. They meant to cure my obstinacy or to kill  me, and had not quite succeeded in doing either.    There was no use in asking me if I would go to work then; I was just  alive. A few days in my own cell, in the daylight, and with something  beside bread and water to eat, partially restored me. I was then taken  into the shop where the snaths were finished by scraping and varnishing,  the lightest part of the work, but I would not learn, would not do,  would not try to do anything at all. They gave me up. The whole struggle  nearly killed me, but I beat them. I was turned into the halls and told  to do what I could, which, I knew well enough, meant what I would.    After that I worked about the halls and yard, sometimes sweeping, and  again carrying something, or doing errands for the keepers from one part  of the prison to another. I was what theatrical managers call a general  utility man, and, not at all strangely, for it is human nature, now  that I could do what I pleased, I pleased to do a great deal, and was  tolerably useful, and far more agreeable than I had been in the past.    There was a young fellow, twenty-two years of age, in one of the cells,  serving out a sentence of six years. When I was sweeping around I used  to stop and talk to him every day. One day he was missing. He had been  supposed to be sick or asleep for several hours, for apparently lie  lay in bed, and was lying very still. But that was only an ingeniously  constructed dummy. The young man himself had made a hole under his bed  into an adjoining vacant cell, the door of which stood open. He had  crawled through his hole, come out of the vacant cell door, and gone up  to the prison garret, where he found some old pieces of rope. These he  tied together, and getting out at the cupola upon the roof, he managed  to let himself down on the outside of the building and got away. He was  never recaptured. The Warden said that some one must have told him about  the adjoining vacant cell, with its always open door, else how would the  young man have known it?    I was accused of imparting this valuable information, and I suffered  four weeks' confinement in that horrible dungeon on the mere suspicion.  This made ten weeks in all of my prison-life in a hole in which I  suffered so that I hoped I should die there.    One of the prisoners was a desperate man, named Hall. He was a convicted  murderer, and was sentenced for life. He too, worked about in the prison  and the yards, dragging or carrying a heavy ball and chain. When bundles  of snaths were to be carried from one shop to the other in the various  processes of finishing, Hall had to do it, and to carry his ball and  chain as well, so that he was loaded like a pack-horse. No pack-horse  was ever so abused.    Of course he was ugly; the wardens and the keepers knew it, and  generally kept away from him.    I talked with him more than once, and he told me that with better  treatment he should be a better man. \"Look at the loads which are put on  me every day,\" he would say; as if this ball and chain were not as much  as I can carry; and this for life, for life!    One day when Hall and I were working together in the prison, Deputy  Warden Morey came in and said something to him, and in a moment the man  sprung upon him. He had secured somehow, perhaps he had picked it up in  the yard, a pocket knife, and with this he stabbed the Warden, striking  him in the shoulder, arm, and where he could.    Morey was a man sixty-five years of age, and he made such resistance  as he could, crying out loudly for help. I turned, ran to Hall, and with  one blow of my fist knocked him nearly senseless; then help came and we  secured the mad man. Morey was profuse in protestations of gratitude to  me for saving his life.    There was a great excitement over this attempt to murder the Deputy, and  for a few hours, with wardens and keepers, I was a hero. I had been in  the prison more than a year, and was generally regarded as one of the  worst prisoners, one of the \"hardest cases;\" a mere chance had suddenly  made me one of the most commendable men within those dreary walls. As  for Hall, he was taken to the dungeon and securely chained by the feet  to a ring in the center of the stone floor. There is no doubt whatever  that the man was a raving maniac. He howled night and day so that he  could be heard everywhere in the prison--\"Murder, murder! they are  murdering me in this black hole; why don't they take me out and kill  me?\"    The Warden said it could not be helped; that the man must be kept there;  he was dangerous to himself and others; the dark cell was the only place  for him. So Hall stayed there and howled, his cries growing weaker from  day to day; by-and-by we heard him only at intervals, and after that  not at all.    One morning there was a little knot of men around the open dungeon door,  the Deputy Warden and two or three keepers. Mr. Morey called to me to go  and get the tools and come there and take off Hall's irons. I went into  the cell and in a few minutes I unfastened his feet from the ring;  then I took the shackles off his limbs. I thought he held his legs very  stiff, but knew he was obstinate, and only wondered he was so quiet.    Somebody brought in a candle and I looked at Hall's face. I never saw a  more ghastly sight. The blood from his mouth and nostrils had clotted  on the lower part of his face, and his wild eyes, fixed and glassy, were  staring at the top wall of the dungeon. He must have been dead several  hours. The Deputy and the rest knew he was dead--the man who carried in  the bread and water told them--me it came with a shock from which I did  not soon recover.    They buried Hall in the little graveyard which was in the yard of the  prison. An Episcopal clergyman, who was chaplain of the prison, read the  burial service over him. The prisoners were brought out to attend the  homely funeral. The ball and chain, all the personal property left by  Hall, were put aside for the next murderer sentenced for life, or for  the next \"ugly\" prisoner. \"If I were only treated better, and not abused  so, I should be a better man.\" This is what Hall used to say to me  whenever he had an opportunity. The last and worst and best in that  prison had been done for him now.    From the day when I rescued Morey from the hands of Hall, his whole  manner changed towards me, and he treated me with great kindness,  frequently bringing me a cup of tea or coffee, and something good to  eat. He also promised to present the circumstances of the Hall affair to  the Governor, and to urge my pardon, but I do not think he ever did so,  at least I heard nothing of it. When I pressed the matter upon Morey's  attention he said it would do no good till I had served out half my  sentence, and then he would see what could be done.    I served half my sentence, and then the other half, every day of it. But  during the last two years I had very little to complain of except the  loss of my liberty. I was put into the cook shop where I could get  better food, and I did pretty much what I pleased. By general consent  I was let alone. They had found out that ill usage only made me \"ugly,\"  while kindness made me at least behave myself. And so the three weary  years of my confinement were on to an end.        CHAPTER XI. ON THE TRAMP.    THE DAY OF MY DELIVERANCE--OUT OF CLOTHES--SHARING WITH A BEGGAR--A  GOOD FRIEND--TRAMPING THROUGH THE SNOW--WEARY WALKS--TRUSTING TO  LUCK--COMFORT AT CONCORD--AT MEREDITH BRIDGE--THE BLAISDELLS--LAST  OF THE \"BLOSSOM\" BUSINESS--MAKING MONEY AT PORTSMOUTH--REVISITING  WINDSOR--AN ASTONISHED WARDEN--MAKING FRIENDS OF OLD ENEMIES--INSPECTING  THE PRISON--GOING TO PORT JERVIS.        At last the happy day of my deliverance came. The penalty for pretending  to marry one milliner and for being married by another milliner was  paid. My sentence was fulfilled. I had looked forward to this day for  months. Of all my jail and prison life in different States, this in  Vermont was the hardest, the most severe. My obstinacy, no doubt, did  much at first to enhance my sufferings, and it was the accident only  of my saving Morey's life that made the last part of my imprisonment  a little more tolerable. When I was preparing to go, it was discovered  that the fine suit of clothes I wore into the prison had been given by  mistake or design to some one else, and my silk hat and calf-skin boots  had gone with the clothes. But never mind! I would have gone out into  the world in rags--my liberty was all I wanted then. The Warden gave me  one of his own old coats, a ragged pair of pantaloons, and a new pair  of brogan shoes. He also gave me three dollars, which was precisely a  dollar a year for my services, and this was more than I ever meant to  earn there. Thus equipped and supplied I was sent out into the streets  of Windsor.    I had not gone half a mile before I met a poor old woman whom I had  known very well in Rutland. She recognized me at once, though I know I  was sadly changed for the worse. She was on her way to Fall River, where  she had relatives, and where she hoped for help, but had no money to pay  her fare, so I divided my small stock with her, and that left me just  one dollar and a half with which to begin the world again. I went down  to the bridge and the toll--gatherer gave me as much as I could "]]]
