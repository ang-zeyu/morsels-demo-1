All this happened not  unfrequently in days gone by, when many were the rajahs murdered  or deposed. History tells us of rajahs being deposed, re-elected,  and deposed again.\"    There can be no doubt that in old days the people benefited by the  system of constant revolutions, as a rajah was obliged to keep in touch  with his subjects if he wished to occupy the throne for any length of  time, and many concessions were made to gain a strong following. The  average intelligence of the Manipuris being higher than that found  among the cultivators of many other native states, the people knew  what reforms to ask for, and often insisted on their being granted.    Nothing can be harder on the people of a native state, than for the  paramount power to hold a ruler on the throne with a firm grasp,  and protect him against internal revolution, and at the same time to  refrain from insisting on needful reform.    Chandra Kirtee Singh's long reign and strong government, were in many  ways a great benefit to the people, because he was a man of sound  sense, and though selfish and unscrupulous, naturally of a kindly  disposition, a fact proved by the few executions that took place in his  reign. In his earlier years he had the benefit of Colonel McCulloch's  good advice, enforced by his great influence. All the same there  can be no doubt that a little more interference judiciously applied,  would have vastly improved the state of affairs during the time he  occupied the throne. Of course an individual Political Agent might  bring about improvements in the administration, but these all rested  on his personal influence and lasted only while he remained. Had the  Government of India stepped in and exerted its authority they would  have been permanent.    Bularam Singh was a typical Manipuri in face and had good manners,  but he had no force of character, and gradually yielded to his more  able colleague. He was generally known as the Toolee-Hel major, i.e.,  the major or commander of the Hel regiment.    Thangal Major was a remarkable character, and had a chequered  history. His uncle had saved the life of Rajah Ghumbeer Singh (Chandra  Kirtee Singh's father), then a child, when his older brother Marjeet  attempted the murder of all his relations. Thangal Major was one of  the props of the throne when Ghumbeer Singh ascended it. He had been  introduced at Court at an early age, and accompanied the Rajah in  an expedition against the village of Thangal inhabited by a tribe  of Nagas. He was given the name Thangal in memory of the event. He  accompanied the old Ranee with her infant son Chandra Kirtee Singh  into exile, when she fled after attempting the Regent Nursing's  life while he was engaged in worship in the temple of Govindjee in  1844; had stayed with him and carefully watched over his childhood  and youth. When in 1850 the young Rajah came to Manipur to assert  his rights, Thangal accompanied him and greatly contributed to his  success. This naturally made him a favourite, and his bold, active,  energetic character always brought him to the front when hard or  dangerous work had to be done. For a time he fell into disfavour,  but Colonel McCulloch, recognising his strong and useful qualities,  and the fact that he was an exceedingly able man, interceded for him  with the Maharajah, and he again came to the front. In person he was  short and thickset, darker than the average of Manipuris, with piercing  eyes and rather a prominent nose, a pleasant and straightforward but  abrupt manner, and, though a very devoted and patriotic Manipuri,  was extremely partial to Europeans. He knew our ways well, and soon  took a man's measure. He was acquainted with every part of Manipur,  and, though ignorant of English, could point out any village in  the state, on an English map. In fact, he had studied geography in  every branch to enable him to defend the cause of Manipur against  the survey officers who were suspected by the Manipuris of wishing  to include all they could within British territory. He knew all our  technical terms such as \"watershed\" in English, and had gained much  credit for enabling the survey to carry on their work in 1872, when  the patriotic but ill-judged zeal of an older officer, Rooma Singh,  nearly brought about a rupture. Thangal Major's knowledge of us and  our customs, as well as of our moral code, was astonishing. He realised  the power of the British Government, and though he would resist us to  the utmost in the interests of Manipur, nothing would have induced  him to join in any plot against our rule in India. When I say that  he was unscrupulous and capable of anything, I only say that he was  what circumstances and education had made him, and would make any  man under similar conditions. He had not the polish of a native of  Western India, and had not had the advantage of English training that  many ministers in other states have. The internal administration of  Manipur had never been interfered with by us, and Thangal Major was  the strong able man of the old type. A strong and capable political  agent might do well with him, but a weak one would soon go to the  wall. He commanded the Toolee Nehah, and was often called by that  title, but was better known as Thangal Major.    One of my predecessors had quarrelled with Thangal Major, and this  had led to recrimination, and very unseemly conduct on the part of the  Durbar. This conduct I had rebuked as directed, but it was a question  as to how Thangal Major was to be dealt with. I was authorised to  demand his dismissal from office, and for some time he had not been  received by my two immediate predecessors. I made careful inquiries,  and feeling convinced that there was a good deal to be said on  Thangal's side, and that by careful management I should be able to  keep him well in hand, I sent for him. The old man, he was then sixty,  having been born in 1817, came in a quiet unostentatious way, and after  a severe rebuke, and receiving an ample apology from him, I forgave  him, and restored him to the position of minister in attendance upon  me; and thenceforth I saw him daily, generally for an hour or two.    In addition to the Minister, two Subadars, Lowremba and Moirang,  were placed in attendance on me, but as time went on, and I and the  Durbar became friends, we transacted business in a friendly way,  through any one.                CHAPTER IX.        Manipur--Early history--Our connection with it--Ghumbeer      Singh--Burmese war.      Manipur consists of about 8000 square miles, chiefly hills surrounding  a valley 650 square miles in extent. This valley from north to south  is about 35 miles, and from east to west 25. The capital Imphal,  as it formerly existed, was a large mass of villages looking like a  forest from the neighbouring heights, and covering about 15 square  miles. Every house was in the centre of its own well-planted garden,  and every garden contained a few forest trees. The census of 1881 gave  the population of the capital as 60,000, that of the rest of the valley  an equal number, while the hills were estimated to have 100,000. It  was only in the capital that pure Manipuris lived, except the soldiers  in the military posts which were scattered all over the country.    The valley itself is 2600 feet above the sea, and the hills rise  on an average to an equal height above it, though here and there  some of the distant peaks are 10,000 to 12,000 feet in height. Thus  Manipur contains within its borders a variety of climate from almost  tropical, to a greater cold than that of England. The heat is never  very excessive in the valley, and for eight months in the year it is  most enjoyable. Foreigners suffer much from bronchial affections,  doubtless owing to the waterlogged soil, but these complaints are  not more prevalent among the native population than elsewhere, and  if sanitary laws were properly observed, the valley might be a most  healthy place and the population would rapidly overflow.    The capital is almost intersected by the 25th parallel north latitude,  and 95 deg. east longitude, and is 132 miles by road from Silchar, the  capital of Cachar, and 70 from Tamu in the Kubo valley. The valley of  Manipur forms the centre of a chain of valleys, viz., Cachar, Manipur,  and Kubo, connecting Bengal with Burmah proper. The sides of the  hills facing the valley of Manipur are generally covered with grass  or scant jungle which rapidly dries up as the cold season advances,  but when once the crest is passed, a fine forest is reached; except  where the hill-tribes have destroyed it, to raise one crop and then  let it relapse into grass and scrub. Alas, I have seen noble oak  forests laid low and burned for this purpose. It is an abominable  custom, and nothing can justify our permitting it where we hold  sway. That it is not necessary is shown by the Angamis and some of  the Tankhool tribes, who though they do occasionally indulge in this  wasteful cultivation are quite independent of it, as they terrace  their hillsides and cultivate the same tract for generations. The  forests of Manipur are plentifully supplied with fine timber trees;  several varieties of oak and chestnut exist, and many others unknown  in England such as Woo-Ningtho, an excellent timber said to resist the  ravages of white ants; wang, which can be worked in its green state  as it never warps; teak, etc. Fir trees are found in abundance to the  south, east, and north-east of the valley, and bamboos of many kinds,  including the giant, are plentiful.    Rhododendrons and wild azaleas of several kinds, as well as many  species of brilliant orchids, add greatly to the beauty of the forests,  and in some parts tree ferns are abundant.

He was fully aware that the task he had undertaken might be  full of danger; but to a healthy and active English lad a spice of  danger is by no means a deterrent. He could, of course, have left  his employment before the family left their chateau; but after  his arrival in Paris it would have been difficult for him to have  traversed the country and crossed the frontier, and he thought that  the danger which he now ran was not much greater than would have  been entailed by such a step.    In the next place he was greatly attached to the family of the  marquis; and the orgies of the mob had filled him with such horror  and disgust that he would have risked much to save any unfortunate, even  a stranger, from their hands; and lastly, he felt the fascination  of the wild excitement of the times, and congratulated himself  that he should see and perhaps be an actor in the astonishing drama  which was occupying the attention of the whole civilized world.    As he sat there he arranged his own plans. After seeing his charge  in safety he would take a room in some quiet locality, alleging  that he was the clerk of a notary, and would, in the dress of one  of that class, or the attire of one of the lower orders, pass his  days in the streets, gathering every rumour and watching the course  of events.    Morning was just breaking when he heard the sound of many feet  coming along the street, and looking out saw a crowd of men with  torches, headed by two whose red scarfs showed them to be officials.  As they reached the entrance gate the men at the head of the  procession stopped. Harry at once darted away to the long gallery,  and as he did so, heard a loud knocking at the door.    Scarcely had he reached the gallery when a door at the further end  opened, and three figures, the tallest carrying a lamp, appeared.  The girls, too, had been keeping watch with their father and  mother.  They were dressed in the attire of respectable peasant  girls. Virginie was weeping loudly, but the elder girls, although  their cheeks bore traces of many tears they had shed during the  night, restrained them now. When they reached Harry, the  lad,  without a word, took the lamp from Marie's hand, and led the way  along the corridor and down the stairs towards the back of the  house.    Everything was quiet. The knocking, loud as it was, had not yet  aroused the servants, and, drawing the bolt quietly, and blowing  out the lamp, Harry led the way into the garden behind the house.  Then for a moment he paused. There was a sound of axes hewing down  the gate which led from the garden into the street behind.    \"Quick, mesdemoiselles!\" he said. \"There is no time to lose.\"    He took they key out of the door, and closed and locked it after  him. Then throwing the key among the shrubs he took Virginie's hand,  and led the way rapidly towards the gate, which was fortunately a  strong one.    \"In here, mesdemoiselles,\" he said to Marie, pointing to some shrubs  close to the gate. \"They will rush straight to the house when the  gate gives way, and we will slip out quietly.\"    For nearly five minutes the gate, which was strongly bound with iron,  resisted the attack upon it. Then there was a crash, and a number  of men with torches, and armed with muskets and pikes, poured in.  Virginie was clinging to Marie, who, whispering to her to be calm  and brave, pressed the child closely to her, while Jeanne stood  quiet and still by the side of Harry, looking through the bushes.    Some twenty men entered, and a minute later there was the sound of  battering at the door through which the fugitives had sallied out.    \"Now,\" Harry said, \"let us be going.\" Emerging from the shelter, a  few steps took them to the gate, and stepping over the door, which  lay prostrate on the ground, they turned into the lane.    \"Let us run,\" Harry said; \"we must get out of this lane as soon as  possible. We are sure to have the mob here before long, and should  certainly be questioned.\"    They hurried down the lane, took the first turning away from the  house, and then slackened their pace. Presently they heard a number  of footsteps clattering on the pavement; but fortunately they  reached another turning before the party came up. They turned down  and stood up in a doorway till the footsteps had passed, and then  resumed their way.    \"It is still too early for us to walk through the streets without  exciting attention,\" Harry said. \"We had better make down to the  river and wait there till the town is quite astir.\"    In ten minutes they reached the river, and Harry found a seat for  them at the foot of a pile of timber, where they were partially  screened from observation. Hitherto the girls had not spoken a  word since they had issued from the house. Virginie was dazed and  frightened by the events of the night, and had hurried along almost  mechanically holding Marie's hand. Marie's brain was too full to  talk; her thoughts were with her father and mother and with her  absent lover. She wondered that he had not come to her in spite of  everything. Perhaps he was already a captive; perhaps, in obedience  to his father's orders, he was in hiding, waiting events. That  he could, even had his father commanded him, have left Paris as a  fugitive without coming to see her, did not even occur to her as  possible.    With these thoughts there was mingled a vague wonder at her own  position. A few weeks since petted and cared for as the eldest  daughter of one of the noblest families of France, now a fugitive  in the streets under the sole care of this English boy. She had,  the evening before, silently sided with Ernest. It had seemed to  her wrong that he should be sent away, and the assertion of Harry  that he intended to stay and watch over her and her sisters seemed  at once absurd and presumptuous; but she already felt that she had  been wrong in that opinion.    The decision and coolness with which he had at once taken the  command from the moment he met them in the gallery, and the quickness  with which he had seized the only mode of escape, had surprised  and dominated her. Her own impulse, when on opening the door she  heard the attack that was being made on the gate, was to draw back  instantly and return to the side of her parents, and it was due to  Harry only that she and her sisters had got safely away.    Hitherto, although after the incident of the mad dog she had exchanged  her former attitude of absolute indifference to one of cordiality  and friendliness, she had regarded him as a boy. Indeed she had  treated and considered him as being very much younger than Ernest,  and in some respects she had been justified in doing so, for in  his light-hearted fun, his love of active exercise, and his entire  absence of any assumption of age, he was far more boyish than  Ernest. But although her thoughts were too busy  now to permit her  to analyse her feelings, she knew that she had been mistaken, and  felt a strange confidence in this lad who had so promptly and coolly  assumed the entire command of the party, and had piloted them with  such steady nerve through the danger.    As for Jeanne, she felt no surprise and but little alarm. Her  confidence in her protector was unbounded. Prompt and cool as he  was himself, she was ready on the instant to obey his orders, and  felt a certain sensation of pride at the manner in which her previous  confidence in him was being justified.    After placing the girls in their shelter Harry had left them and  stood leaning against the parapet of the quay as if carelessly  watching the water, but maintaining a vigilant look-out against  the approach of danger. The number of passers-by increased rapidly.  The washerwomen came down to the boats moored in the stream and  began their operation of banging the linen with wooden beaters.  Market-women came along with baskets, the hum and stir of life  everywhere commenced, and Paris was fairly awake.    Seeing that it was safe now to proceed, Harry returned to his  companions. He had scarcely glanced at them before, and now looked  approvingly at their disguises, to which the marquise had, during  the long hours of the night, devoted the most zealous attention.  Marie had been made to look much older than she was. A few dark  lines carefully traced on her forehead, at the corners of her eyes  and mouth, had added many years to her appearance, and she could  have passed, except to the closest observer, as the mother of  Virginie, whose dress was calculated to make her look even younger  than she was. The hands and faces of all three had been slightly  tinged with brown to give them a sun-burnt aspect in accordance  with their peasant dresses, and so complete was the transformation  that Harry could scarcely suppress a start of surprise as he looked  at the group.    \"It would be safe now, mademoiselle,\" he said to Marie, \"for us to  proceed. There are plenty of people about in the streets; but as  the news has, no doubt, already been spread that the daughters of  the Marquis de St. Caux had left the house before those charged  with their father's arrest arrived, it will be better for you not  to keep together. I would suggest that you should walk on with  Virginie.  I will follow with Jeanne a hundred yards behind, so  that I can keep you in sight, and will come up if anyone should  accost you.\"    Marie at once rose, and taking the child's hand set out. They had  to traverse the greater part of Paris to reach their destination.  It was a trial for Marie, who had never before been in the streets  of Paris except with her mother and closely followed by two domestics,  and even then only through the quiet streets of a fashionable  quarter.  However, she went steadily forward, tightly holding  Virginie's hand and trying to walk as if accustomed to them in the  thick heavy shoes which felt so strangely different to those which  she was in the habit of wearing.
