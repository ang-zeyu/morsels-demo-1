I was very sorry that I had not brought my rifle, as I badly  wanted a specimen and never had another chance of obtaining one.          CHAPTER XI    THE SWAHILI AND OTHER NATIVE TRIBES      I have always been very keenly interested in the different native races  of Africa, and consequently availed myself of every opportunity of  studying their manners and customs. I had little scope for this at  Tsavo, however, as the district around us was practically uninhabited.  Still there was of course a good number of Swahili among my workmen,  together with a few Wa Kamba, Wa N'yam Wezi, and others, so I soon  became more or less acquainted with the habits of these tribes. The  Swahili live principally along the coast of British East Africa and at  Zanzibar. They are a mixed race, being the descendants of Arab fathers  and negro mothers. Their name is derived from the Arabic word suahil,  coast; but it has also been said, by some who have found them scarcely  so guileless as might have been expected, to be really a corruption of  the words sawa hili, that is, \"those who cheat all alike.\" However that  may be, the men are as a rule of splendid physique and well qualified  for the calling that the majority of them follow, that of caravan  porters. They are a careless, light-hearted, improvident people, and  are very fond of all the good things of this world, enjoying them  thoroughly whenever they get the chance. Their life is spent in  journeying to and from the interior, carrying heavy loads of provisions  and trade-goods on the one journey, and returning with similar loads of  ivory or other products of the country. They are away for many months  at a time on these expeditions, and consequently--as they cannot spend  money on the march--they have a goodly number of rupees to draw on  their return to Mombasa. These generally disappear with wonderful  rapidity, and when no more fun can be bought, they join another caravan  and begin a new safari to the Great Lakes, or even beyond. Many a time  have I watched them trudging along the old caravan road which crossed  the Tsavo at a ford about half a mile from the railway station: here a  halt was always called, so that they might wash and bathe in the cool  waters of the river.    Nothing ever seems to damp the spirits of the Swahili porter. Be his  life ever so hard, his load ever so heavy, the moment it is off his  back and he has disposed of his posho (food), he straightway forgets  all his troubles, and begins to laugh and sing and joke with his  fellows as if he were the happiest and luckiest mortal alive. Such was  my cook, Mabruki, and his merry laugh was quite infectious. I remember  that one day he was opening a tin of biscuits for me, and not being  able to pull off the under-lid with his fingers, he seized the flap in  his magnificent teeth and tugged at it. I shouted to him to stop,  thinking that he might break a tooth; but he misunderstood my  solicitude and gravely assured me that he would not spoil the tin!    The Swahili men wear a long white cotton garment, like a night-shirt,  called a kanzu; the women--who are too liberally endowed to be entirely  graceful--go about with bare arms and shoulders, and wear a long  brightly-coloured cloth which they wind tightly round their bosoms and  then allow to fall to the feet. All are followers of the Prophet, and  their social customs are consequently much the same as those of any  other Mohammedan race, though with a good admixture of savagedom. They  have a happy knack of giving a nickname to every European with whom  they have to do, such nickname generally making reference to something  peculiar or striking in his habits, temper, or appearance. On the  whole, they are a kindly, generous folk, whom one cannot help liking.    Of the many tribes which are to be seen about the railway on the way up  from the coast, perhaps the most extraordinary-looking are the Wa  Nyika, the people who inhabit the thorny nyika (wilderness) which  borders on the Taru Desert. They are exceedingly ugly and of a low  type. The men wear nothing in the way of dress but a scanty and very  dirty cloth thrown over the shoulders, while the women attire  themselves only in a short kilt which is tied round them very low at  the waist. Both men and women adorn themselves with brass chains round  the neck and coils of copper and iron wire round the arms.    The nearest native inhabitants to Tsavo are the Wa Taita, who dwell in  the mountains near N'dii, some thirty miles away. My work often took me  to this place, and on one of my visits, finding myself with some spare  time on my hands, I set out to pay a long promised visit to the  District Officer. A fairly good road ran from N'dii Station to his  house at the foot of the mountains, about four miles away, and on my  arrival I was not only most hospitably entertained but was also  introduced to M'gogo, the Head Chief of the Wa Taita, who had just come  in for a shauri (consultation) about some affair of State. The old  fellow appeared delighted to meet me, and promptly invited me to his  kraal, some way up the hills. I jumped at the prospect of seeing the Wa  Taita at home, so presently off we started on our heavy climb, my  Indian servant, Bhawal, coming with us. After a couple of hours' steady  scramble up a steep and slippery goatpath, we arrived at M'gogo's  capital, where I was at once introduced to his wives, who were busily  engaged in making pombe (a native fermented drink) in the hollowed-out  stump of a tree. I presented one of them with an orange for her child,  but she did not understand what it was for on tasting it she made a wry  face and would not eat it. Still she did not throw it away, but  carefully put it into a bag with her other treasures--doubtless for  future investigation. As soon as the women saw Bhawal, however, he  became the centre of attraction, and I was eclipsed. He happened to  have on a new puggaree, with lots of gold work on it, and this took  their fancy immensely; they examined every line most carefully and went  into ecstasies over it--just as their European sisters would have done  over the latest Parisian creation.    We made a short halt for rest and refreshment, and then started again  on our journey to the top of the hills. After a stiff climb for another  two hours, part of it through a thick black forest, we emerged on the  summit, where I found I was well rewarded for my trouble by the  magnificent views we obtained on all sides. The great Kilima N'jaro  stood out particularly well, and made a very effective background to  the fine panorama. I was surprised to find a number of well-fed cattle  on the mountain top, but I fancy M'gogo thought I was casting an evil  spell over them when he saw me taking photographs of them as they  grazed peacefully on the sweet grass which covered the plateau.    Like most other natives of Africa, the Wa Taita are exceedingly  superstitious, and this failing is turned to good account by the  all-powerful \"witch-doctor\" or \"medicine-man.\" It is, for instance, an  extraordinary sight to see the absolute faith with which a Ki Taita  will blow the simba-dawa, or \"lion medicine \", to the four points of  the compass before lying down to sleep in the open. This dawa--which  is, of course, obtainable only from the witch-doctor--consists simply  of a little black powder, usually carried in a tiny horn stuck through  a slit in the ear; but the Ki Taita firmly believes that a few grains  of this dust blown round him from the palm of the hand is a complete  safeguard against raging lions seeking whom they may devour; and after  the blowing ceremony he will lie down to sleep in perfect confidence,  even in the midst of a man-eater's district. In the nature of things,  moreover, he never loses this touching faith in the efficacy of the  witch-doctor's charm; for if he is attacked by a lion, the brute sees  to it that he does not live to become an unbeliever, while if he is not  attacked, it is of course quite clear that it is to the dawa that he  owes his immunity.    For the rest, the Wa Taita are essentially a peace-loving and  industrious people; and, indeed, before the arrival of the British in  the country, they hardly ever ventured down from their mountain  fastnesses, owing to their dread of the warlike Masai. Each man has as  many wives as he can afford to pay for in sheep or cattle; he provides  each spouse with a separate establishment, but the family huts are  clustered together, and as a rule all live in perfect harmony. The most  curious custom of the tribe is the filing of the front teeth into sharp  points, which gives the whole face a most peculiar and rather  diabolical expression. As usual, their ideas of costume are rather  primitive; the men sometimes wear a scrap of cloth round the loins,  while the women content themselves with the same or with a short kilt.  Both sexes adorn themselves with a great quantity of copper or iron  wire coiled round their arms and legs, and smear their bodies all over  with grease, the men adding red clay to the mixture. Many of the women  also wear dozens of rows of beads, while their ears are hung with  pieces of chain and other fantastic ornaments. The men always carry  bows and poisoned arrows, as well as a seemie (a short,  roughly-fashioned sword) hung on a leathern thong round the waist. A  three-legged stool is also an important part of their equipment, and is  slung on the shoulder when on the march.    The next people met with on the road to the Great Lakes are the Wa  Kamba, who inhabit the Ukambani province, and may be seen from M'toto  Andei to the Athi River. They are a very large tribe, but have little  cohesion, being split up, into many clans under chiefs who govern in a  patriarchal kind of way. In appearance and dress--or the want of  it--they are very like the Wa Taita, and they have the same custom of  filing the front teeth. As a rule, too, they are a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38189"],[0,"A Treatise on Sheep: (#15)"],[1," New South Wales_). \"Both the climate and the soil  appear by nature intended to produce fine wool, and fine animals too,  _even from the worst beginnings_. The latter seems a paradox. The  extensive range afforded to every animal keeps it in good condition,  and, perhaps, the natural grasses may have more of good in them than  their appearance indicates. However this may be, the climate clearly  has a wonderful effect on the size of all animals, even upon man, who  is universally tall here, though born of diminutive parents. From this  I am led to believe, that the climate governs chiefly, and thus every  breeding animal introduced here will attain a size not known in  Europe.\"    (71.) _Extent of the Alterations produced by Climate._--Changes  occasioned by climate are always limited to the fleece, horns, and  disposal of the fat, and never extend to those parts, on the  permanence of which the animal depends for its station in the scale of  being, as the feet, teeth, and digestive organs. In tropical countries  we find the fleece approaching more to hair than wool, as in the sheep  of Thibet, so celebrated for the silky nature of their coat. Burchell  remarks, that the skins he brought from the Cape of Good Hope were  often taken for those of an unknown quadruped, from the _furry_ nature  of their wool, if such it can be called, and thinks it is owing as  much to the pasture, which is well adapted for giving these animals a  soft and useful _fur_, though not suited, like New South Wales, for  the growth of the finest wool, and that the colony might turn this to  great advantage. In cold regions the hairy covering is more developed  and fully coarser, but always mingled with a proportion of hard rough  wool. The influence of climate on portions of the fleece and skin is  well illustrated by circumstances which have occurred in Galloway,  even within the limits of our traditionary writings.[11] The native  sheep of the Highlands of that district is supposed to have been a  small, handsome, _white-faced_ breed; at least so thinks John  MacLellan, who wrote an account of Galloway in 1650, from the wool  being much praised, and eagerly bought up by merchants, which would  not have been the case if taken from the _black-faced_ animal; yet how  happens it that at present the native breed exists only in the lower  parts of Kirkcudbrightshire, the high country exhibiting _black-faced_  sheep, which, after every trial, have been found best adapted to the  climate, and pasture of the moors and Highlands; while Chalmers owns  that it has not been ascertained when or whence this hardy breed were  brought to their present locality? Why, it is tolerably plain, that  though the _white-faced_ sheep might be placed there originally, yet  they would speedily lose every trace of their origin, and become  _black-faced_ when placed on a hilly country, and subjected to the  slow but certain influence of peculiar food and climate.            [11] Chalmers' Caledonia--Article, Galloway.    Mr Culley imagines, that the dun-faced sheep were the earliest tenants  of the Scottish hills, but so far as my researches extend, that  supposition is entirely contradicted. Chalmers remarks, that the  black-faced animals superseded the goats, which were at one time a  source of subsistence to the farmers, and it is exceedingly probable,  that as the old white-faced began to change their appearance, and  became gradually able to withstand the rigours of a mountain fare, and  winter under a dun skin, and short rough wool, so would they recommend  themselves as the best of all stock to the hard-driven agriculturalist.    (72.) _Increase of the Number of the Horns._--As much wonder is sure to  be excited by the fact, that bony prominences are subjected with as  great certainty to the modelling hand of climate as softer parts, I  give the following from a recent work, entitled, \"_Gardens and  Menagerie of the Zoological Society Delineated_,\" premising, however,  that, in my opinion, temperature has a vast deal more to do with  alterations in the horns than domestication or cultivation. \"One of the  most curious modifications produced by cultivation in the domesticated  sheep consists in the augmentation of the number of its horns; two,  three, or even four supplementary appendages of this description being  occasionally produced in addition to the normal number. Under these  circumstances the additional horns usually occupy the upper and fore  part of the head, and are of a more slender shape, and take a more  upright direction than the others, thus approaching in character to  those of the goats, while the true horns retain more or less of the  spiral curve that distinguishes those of the sheep. There exists a  strong tendency to the propagation of this monstrosity, which is  extremely frequent in the Asiatic races, but is also met with in a  breed that is common in the north of Europe, and is said to have been  originally derived from Iceland, and the Feroe Islands. In this case it  is unconnected with any other anomaly, but in the flocks of the nomad  hordes of Tartary, it is usually combined with an enlargement of the  tail, and adjacent parts, by the deposition of fat, frequently to an  enormous extent.\"    (73.) _Causes of the various forms of the Horn._--Horns are seldom met  with in the sheep of hot climates, occurring more frequently in cold  and temperate regions; thus following closely the development of the  other coverings, to which, as before stated (19), they are strictly  analogous. The fleece consists of two portions--hair and wool, the one  predominating more or less over the other, as the climate may direct.  The form of the horns is always in unison with the character of the  fleece: thus, if the animal is covered with hair, as in the goat, the  horns will be straight; but if it is clothed with wool, as in the  sheep, the horns will be curved. The same holds good in other animals.  The reason of this appears to lie in the tendency which the hair or  wool, constituting the horny sheath, has to model the form of the  supporting bone. The fibre of hair is nearly straight; that of wool is,  on the other hand, remarkable for the number of tufted curls, or small  spiral ringlets, into which it naturally contracts; so that a Merino  ram, for example, will never be found with rectilinear horns, nor a  true goat with twisted ones. The truth of these remarks is borne out by  observations on animals on whose heads more than two horns are  occasionally met with. We always in such instances notice, that the  additional horns are straight, thus indicating the presence of a  considerable quantity of hair among the wool. The curve will be more  decided, and the twists more numerous, in proportion as the fibre comes  nearer and nearer to a perfect wool--evidence of which we have in the  beautifully-tufted and spiral horns of the Merino ram, which are as  opposite in this respect to those of the goat, as is its fleece to the  hairy coat of the latter. From these considerations I am led to  believe, that the form of the horn, when present, is an excellent guide  to the nature and quality of the other coverings, and an index to every  gradation which can possibly occur between wool and hair.    (74.) _The proper Temperature required for Sheep._--Regular warmth is  absolutely necessary for the production of a good animal and a fine  fleece, and is only to be obtained by attending to the draining and  clearing of land, so as to dissipate moisture, and allow currents of  air to play freely across the country.[12] An atmosphere which holds  suspended a large quantity of watery vapour, is always extremely  chilling to an animal body. This is accounted for by the well-known  fact, that a moist air, being a better conductor of caloric than a dry  one, robs an animal more quickly of heat. Thus, in passing from the dry  air of the hills into the vapour of the valleys in a winter morning, we  feel as if the transition had been from a temperate to an icy region.  Hence one of the reasons why sheep thrive best in a rather elevated  situation. Moist air, however, is exceedingly oppressive in hot  weather, because evaporation, from the surface of the body, is to a  great extent diminished; and it is only by the perspiration being  allowed to escape rapidly, and to convey away the heated particles,  that we can manage to be in any degree comfortable during the heat of  summer. This free evaporation we endeavour in every way to obtain, and  often in a manner that ignorant people would consider as the reverse of  sensible. It is well known that draughts of _cold liquids_ are very far  from answering the purpose of lowering our temperature when above a  pleasant standard; but we find that a basin _of hot soup, or tea_, will  speedily bring about the desired end, by producing a copious  determination of fluid to the skin. Yet, if the air contained no  moisture, we should experience sensations just as unpleasant as those  already mentioned; for evaporation from our bodies would proceed at  such a rate, that we would soon be parched. It is to counteract this  tendency of dry air that the Americans are in the habit of placing a  small vessel of water on their stoves, by which contrivance a quantity  of vapour is diffused through the apartment, sufficient to balance the  loss from the arid warmth of the fire.            [12] It is to secure equality of temperature that the Spanish          flocks are twice in the year exposed to the hazard of an          overland journey of 400 miles, that they may pass the summer          in the mountains of the north, and the winter in the southern          plains.    That an equable temperature is only to be obtained by draining and  clearing a marshy and wooded country, is sufficiently authenticated. In  the thickly wooded and swampy territories of Guiana, rain falls  continually during nearly eight months of the year; and the cold"]]]
