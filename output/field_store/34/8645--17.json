No art of  breeding can counteract these established laws of Nature.    In instituting a comparison between breeds of sheep for _wool-growing_  purposes, it is undeniable that the question is not, what variety will  shear the heaviest or even the most valuable fleece, irrespective of  the cost of production. Cost of feed and care, and every other expense,  must be deducted, in order to fairly test the profits of an animal.  If a large sheep consume twice as much food as a small one, and give  but once and a-half as much wool, it is obviously more profitable--other  things being equal--to keep two of the smaller sheep. The next question,  then, is,--_from what breed_--with the same expense in other  particulars--_will the verdure of an acre of land produce the greatest  value of wool_?    And, first, as to the comparative amount of food consumed by the several  breeds. There are no satisfactory experiments which show that _breed_,  in itself considered, has any particular influence on the quantity of  food consumed. It is found, with all varieties, that the consumption is  in proportion to the live weight of the grown animal. Of course, this  rule is not invariable in its individual application; but its general  soundness has been satisfactorily established. Grown sheep take up  between two and a half and three and a third per cent. of their weight,  in what is equivalent to dry hay, to keep themselves in store condition.    The consumption of food, then, being proportioned to the weight, it  follows that, if one acre is capable of sustaining three Merinos,  weighing one hundred pounds each, it will sustain two Leicesters,  weighing one hundred and fifty each, and two and two-fifth South-Downs,  weighing one hundred and twenty-five each. Merinos of this weight often  shear five pounds per fleece, taking flocks through. The herbage of an  acre, then, would give fifteen pounds of Merino wool, twelve of  Leicester, and but nine and three-fifths of South-Down--estimating the  latter as high as four pounds to the fleece. Even the finest and  lightest-fleeced sheep known as Merinos average about four pounds to the  fleece; so that the feed of an acre would produce as much of the highest  quality of wool sold under the name of Merino as it would of New  Leicester, and more than it would of South-Down, while the former would  be worth from fifty to one hundred per cent. more per pound than either  of the latter.    Nor does this indicate all the actual difference, as in the foregoing  estimate the live weight of the English breeds is placed low, and that  of the Merinos high. The live weight of the five-pound fine-fleeced  Merino does not exceed ninety pounds; it ranges, in fact, from eighty to  ninety; so that three hundred pounds of live weight--it being understood  that all of these live weights refer to ewes in fair ordinary, or what  is called store, condition--would give a still greater product of wool  to the acre. It is perfectly safe, therefore, to say that the herbage of  an acre will uniformly give nearly double the value of Merino that it  will of any of the English long or middle wools.    What are the other relative expenses of these breeds? The full-blooded  Leicester is in no respect a hardier sheep than the Merino, though some  of its crosses are much hardier than the pure-bred sheep: indeed, it is  less hardy, under the most favorable circumstances. It is more subject  to colds; its constitution more readily gives way under disease; the  lambs are more liable to perish from exposure to cold, when newly  dropped. Under unfavorable circumstances--herded in large flocks,  famished for feed, or subjected to long journeys--its capacity to  endure, and its ability to rally from sad drawbacks, do not compare,  with those of the Merino. The high-bred South-Down, though considerably  less hardy than the unimproved parent stock, is still fairly entitled to  the appellation of a hardy animal; it is, in fact, about on a pace with  the Merino, though it will not bear as hard stocking, without a rapid  diminution in size and quality. If the peculiar merits of the animal are  to be considered in determining the expenses, as they surely should be,  the superior fecundity of the South-Down is a point in its favor, as  well for a wool-producing as a mutton sheep. The ewe not only frequently  produces twin lambs--as do both the Merino and Leicester--but, unlike  the latter, she possesses nursing properties to do justice to them. This  advantage, however, is fully counterbalanced by the superior longevity  of the Merino. All the English mutton breeds begin to rapidly  deteriorate in amount of wool, capacity to fatten, and general vigor, at  about five years old; and their early maturity is no offset to this, in  an animal kept for wool-growing purposes. This early decay requires  earlier and more rapid slaughter than is always economically convenient,  or even possible.    It is well, on properly stocked farms, to slaughter or turn off the  Merino wether at four or five years old, to make room for the breeding  stock; but he will not particularly deteriorate, and he will richly pay  the way with his fleece for several years longer. Breeding ewes are  rarely turned off before eight, and are frequently kept until ten years  old, at which period they exhibit no greater marks of age than do the  Downs and Leicester at five or six. Instances are known of Merino ewes  breeding uniformly until fifteen years old. The improved Cotswold is  said to be hardier than the Leicester; but this variety, from their  great size, and the consequent amount of food consumed by them, together  with the other necessary incidents connected with the breeding of such  large animals, is incapacitated from being generally introduced as a  wool-growing sheep. All the coarse races have one advantage over the  Merino: they are less subject to the visitation of the hoof-ail, and  when untreated, this disease spreads with less violence and malignity  among them. This has been explained by the fact that their hoofs do not  grow long and turn under from the sides, as do those of the Merino, and  thus retain dirt and filth in constant contact with the foot.    Taking into account all the circumstances connected with the peculiar  management of each race, together with all the incidents, exigencies,  and risks of the husbandry of each, it may be confidently asserted that  the expenses, other than those of feed, are not smaller per head, or  even in the number required to stock an acre, in either of the English  breeds above referred to, than in the Merino. Indeed, it may well be  doubted whether any of those English breeds, except the South-Down, is  on an equality, even, with the Merino, in these respects. For  wool-growing purposes, the Merino, then, possesses a marked and decided  superiority over the best breeds and families of coarse-woolled sheep.  As a mutton sheep, it is inferior to some of those breeds; although not  so much as is popularly supposed. Many persons, who have never tasted  Merino mutton, and who have, consequently, an unfavorable impression of  it, would, if required to consume the fat and lean together, find it  more palatable than the luscious and over-fat New Leicester. The mutton  of the cross between the Merino and the Native would certainly be  preferred to the Leicester, by anybody but an English laborer,  accustomed to the latter, since it is short-grained, tender, and of good  flavor. The same is true of the crosses with the English varieties,  which will hereafter be treated of more particularly. Grade Merino  wethers, half-bloods, for example, are favorites with the drover and  butcher, being of good size, extraordinarily heavy for their apparent  bulk, by reason of the shortness of their wool, compared with the coarse  breeds, making good mutton, tallowing well, and their pelts, from the  greater weight of wool on them, commanding an extra price. In speaking  of the Merino in this connection, no reference is made to the Saxons,  though they are, as is well known, pure-blooded descendants of the  former.    Assuming it, then, as settled, that it is to the Merino race that the  wool-grower must look for the most profitable sheep, a few  considerations are subjoined as to the adaptability of the widely  diverse sub-varieties of the race to the wants and circumstances of  different portions of the country.    Upon the first introduction of the Saxons, they were sought with avidity  by the holders of the fine-woolled flocks of the country, consisting at  that time of pure or grade Merinos. Under the decisive encouragement  offered both to the wool-grower and the manufacturer by the tariff of  1828, a great impetus was given to the production of the finest wools,  and the Saxon everywhere superseded, or bred out by crossing, the  Spanish Merinos. In New York and New England, the latter almost entirely  disappeared. In the fine-wool mania which ensued, weight of fleece,  constitution, and every thing else, were sacrificed to the quality of  the wool. Then came the tariff of 1832, which, as well as that of 1828,  gave too much protection to both wool-grower and manufacturer, into  whose pursuits agricultural and mercantile speculators madly rushed.  Skill without capital, capital without skill, and in some cases,  probably, thirst for gain without either, laid hold of these favored  avocations. The natural and inevitable result followed. In the financial  crisis of 1837, manufacturing, and all other monetary enterprises which  had not been conducted with skill and providence, and which were not  based on an adequate and vast capital, were involved in a common  destruction; and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39235"],[0,"A Manual of Toy Dogs: How to breed, rear, and feed them (#15)"],[1,"pea, should be  gently introduced under the lid of the affected eye with a camel's hair  brush. Do not, on any account, accept \"golden ointment,\" if the chemist  happens to offer you this old-fashioned remedy (I believe) for styes! It  is made of the _red_ oxide of mercury, and is a very great deal stronger  than the yellow oxide of mercury ointment, which, by the way, should be  made in the strength of 2 grs. to the ounce. This latter ointment may  also be used where, after distemper, a bluish film lingers in the eye.  Amaurosis is not uncommon in the dog. The eyes look perfectly right,  but the dog is blind. This may be an hereditary condition, but sometimes  comes in as a result of weakness pure and simple. Iron tonics, cod liver  oil, nux vomica, etc., may be given, and sometimes prove effectual. Good  living is essential. These cases are occasionally cured rather suddenly,  but as a rule are incurable.    Simple cold in the eyes--or more often, only in one--is a very ordinary  ailment, but distressing both to sufferer and owner. The affected eye  waters more or less profusely, and is kept partly closed. Within, there  is the same appearance as in catarrhal ophthalmia, but in a less degree,  and there may be fever and constitutional disturbance, in which case the  patient must be treated for a coryza, or \"common cold.\" A boracic and  poppy-head lotion is the quickest cure for cold in the eyes, and is also  useful in the ophthalmic condition. It soothes the pain greatly, and is  best applied by means of a small all-indiarubber ball syringe. On no  account must a syringe with a bone or glass or vulcanite point be used:  the indiarubber nozzle is soft, and from it one or two drops can easily  be inserted between the eyelids. The amount of resistance the patient  makes will be proportionate to the severity of the inflammation, and as  this lessens he will endure the operation with serenity. To make the  lotion at home, buy a poppy-head, price about a halfpenny, from any  chemist, and boil it for an hour or longer in half a pint of water,  adding to this as it evaporates. When the water is sherry-coloured,  dissolve 10 grs. of boracic acid powder in each fluid ounce, allow to  cool, and use as frequently as convenient--once every hour, while the  congestion of the lining membrane of the eyelids is active.      =Sore Feet.=--Eczema, or little boils between the toes and round the  dew-claw on the front legs, is a trouble which besets some dogs.  Constitutional treatment, as laid down for eczema, is needful, and as  the dog will invariably worry the sores incessantly by licking, they  should be dusted with zinc or ichthyol powder, and then bandaged or  socked. If a dog is constantly licking its dew-claw, look at it to make  sure it is not growing in. In this case it needs to be cut rather short,  preferably by a veterinary surgeon, and the sore dressed. Dew-claws on  the hind legs should always be removed by a veterinary surgeon in  puppy-hood.      =Colds and Coughs.=--Colds, or coryza, beset dogs as they do humans, but  in lesser degree. A chest cold needs a flannel cross-over, sometimes a  hot linseed poultice (in treating dogs it is much better to use, if  possible, some dry poultice which will not leave the dog sopping after  it is removed), or a mustard-leaf. Rubbing with white vaseline oil and  ten drops of turpentine to each ounce, if vigorously done, is as good  for colds as for rheumatism. Everyone knows what a cold is, and the toy  dog's cold should be treated like one's own. The clinical thermometer  should be used, and if the temperature exceeds 100 deg., a pill of 5 grs. of  nitrate of potash should be given every four hours until it is normal  again, or, if it cannot be got down thus, give 1/2 gr. of sulphate of  quinine and 1 gr. of phenacetin, using the tabloids, and dividing them  as desired. The strength must be well kept up. _Coughs_--the dog's  hollow, deep-drawn brand--are a sore trial to the hearer. They sound  terrible, but are seldom of much moment. If from cold, put a little  vaseline or glycerine on the nose three or four times a day. It will be  licked off, and give relief, while some dogs will eat glycerine lozenges  if not flavoured with lemon. Vaseline, again, is an excellent thing for  bronchial wheezing, such as pugs are especially subject to, and will  always be taken if put on the nose. Cream also is soothing, and where is  the dog that does not like it?      =Chest Diseases.=--The worst-sounding coughs are often the least  important, and may pass off in a few days without treatment, but a  bronchial rattling in the throat calls for care. Bronchitis in toy dogs  must be treated exactly as in children, and, needless to say, the dog  must not go out until the acute stage is passed. Most clean dogs will go  to a box of earth in a cellar. A bronchitis kettle must be kept going in  the room, and the patient will need an invalidish diet and much petting  and amusement to carry him through the dull hours of discomfort. Dogs  have congestion of the lungs, pleurisy, pneumonia, just as people do,  and need the same careful nursing. Medicine in such cases is usually  unnecessary, because it worries the patient and can do little good. A  mild fever mixture may be prescribed by the vet, who should always be  called in the moment the breathing goes wrong. Dulness, lassitude,  shivering, and a high temperature--the clinical thermometer is of all  things needed here--with troubled breathing, are symptoms of the highest  importance, and skilled aid should be immediately called to them. The  amateur cannot diagnose these lung and chest troubles.      =Stomach Coughs.=--Very dreadful coughs are sometimes heard proceeding  entirely from the stomach. For these a little course of indigestion  treatment often does wonders. Or, again, coughing _may_ be caused by a  fish-bone or something similar in the throat, though this is the rarest  of all causes in the dog, owing to his possessing a most tremendous  gullet, quite out of proportion to his size.      =Shivering.=--Shivering is a bad trick some dogs acquire, and others  have by nature. It generally, if unaccompanied by a high temperature,  means nothing whatever, unless it be nerves. But, short of the Weir  Mitchell treatment, I imagine nothing benefits these latter more than a  mild scolding, with admonitions \"not to be so silly.\"      =Hysteria.=--There are, most certainly, hysterical dogs, and their  temperament is that of the habitual shiverer, though very thin-skinned  toys sometimes really shiver from cold. A hysterical dog will bark  itself quite out of breath at the least disturbance, and shriek exactly  like its prototype human. Nature cannot be changed, but a tonic  sometimes does good. Excitability and nervousness are characteristic of  some breeds. Poms are, perhaps, the most excitable of small dogs, and  pugs certainly the least so.      =Obesity.=--Extreme fatness may be a disease in the dog as in the human  being, and in this case it is cruel to accuse the poor creature of  systematic over-eating, as it is everyone's impulse to do. The bromides  and iodides are useful, but cannot be prescribed haphazard. Thyroid  gland tabloids may also be tried, beginning with one once a day, and  gradually creeping up to three a day, according to the dog's size. Their  effect on the digestion is not always happy, so that the dog must be  watched to assure the owner of its toleration of them.      =Poison.=--Not an ailment, but a subject which needs a few words, is the  taking of poison by toy dogs. Unluckily, there is always risk in a town,  not only of the wilful poisoner, who apparently exists, but of the  ingestion of poisoned meat or bread and butter put for rats or beetles,  and afterwards thrown out. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred a  poisoned dog has had strychnine, this being the favourite drug of all  those who employ poison at all. Arsenic is too slow, and of other  poisons, thank Providence! the vulgar have mostly no knowledge. The  symptoms of strychnine poisoning are, firstly, excitement--the patient  runs about, and barks with a peculiar strident shriek. According to the  quantity of the poison taken and the quantity of food in the stomach at  the time, this stage occupies a longer or shorter period. Taken shortly  after a good meal, the poison seems less rapid in action than when the  stomach is empty. Presently come convulsions, and constant shrieking;  then the limbs stick out and are perfectly stiff and rigid. Even at this  stage the dog can often be saved if means are at hand. Never be without  a bottle of syrup of chloral in the house; it will keep indefinitely.  First make the dog sick. Use sulphate of zinc in water, or weak mustard  and warm water, and give plenty of this latter. The best way is by  putting it in a phial, and running it down the throat by way of a pouch  of lower lip drawn out from the teeth at the angle of the mouth. As soon  as the patient has been sick, give a teaspoonful of the syrup of chloral  in water. This is the antidote to strychnine. If you cannot wait to make  the patient sick, give the chloral at once--but give it: and the dose  may be repeated every two hours until the convulsions cease. For a tiny  pup or dog under 5 lbs. the dose may be halved. Recovery from strychnine  is very rapid, and it leaves, as a rule, no ill effects, though there is  a widespread belief, and a mistaken one, that it subsequently affects  the kidneys.    All the other kinds of poison dogs are likely to get or be given work as  irritants, and these need veterinary diagnosis. Salt, I may here remark,  is so violent and irritating a purgative to the dog that it is next door  to a poison, and the effects of castor oil in his intestine are not so  very far behind. Constant drugging is a thing as much to be avoided in  dogs as in their owners, and I cannot too strongly deprecate the foolish  practice--foolish or worse--of "]]]
