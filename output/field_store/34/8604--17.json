Just over the gizzard blazes a great red eye, of a square or  oblong form, and it reposes upon a large mass of soft granular-looking  brain, which well justifies Mr. Gosse's epithet \"enormous.\" Whether this  brain is highly organized enough to be a _thinking_ apparatus, we do not  know, but it is evidently the cause of a very vigorous and consentaneous  action of the various organs the Brachion possesses.    A description of the Brachion would be very incomplete if it omitted  that important organ the tail, which in this family reaches the highest  point of development. It is a powerful muscular organ, of great size in  proportion to the animal, capable of complete retraction within the  carapace, and of being everted wholly, or partially, at will. It  terminates in two short conical toes, protruded from a tube-like sheath,  and capable of adhering firmly even to a substance so slippery as glass.  This tail may be observed to indicate a variety of emotions, if we can  ascribe such feelings to a rotifer, and it answers many purposes. Now we  see it cautiously thrust forth, and turned this way and that, exploring  like an elephant's trunk, and almost as flexible. Now it seizes firm  hold of some substance, and anchors its proprietor hard and fast. A few  moments afterwards it lashes out right and left with fury, like the tail  of a cat in a passion. Then again it will be retracted, and a casual  observer might not imagine the Brachion to be furnished with such a  terminal implement.    The Brachiones may often be seen with one or more large eggs stuck  about the upper part of the tail, and others may be discerned inside.  One specimen before us has three eggs attached to her in this way. They  are large oval bodies, with a firm shell. These creatures differ very  much in appearance, according to the direction in which they are seen,  and a side view makes them look so different from a full front or back  aspect, that it would be easy to suppose another animal was under  observation. The extent to which the ciliary apparatus is protruded, and  the pattern it forms likewise differs continually; and hence no drawing,  however correct, is sure to resemble the arrangement that may be  presented to the observer's eye. But however our little \"Pitcher\" may be  viewed, it is sure to prove a spectacle of interest and delight.          CHAPTER IX.    SEPTEMBER.

Scattered about Hampstead Heath are a number of little pools, not big  enough to be dignified by the name of ponds. They are generally  surrounded by furze bushes, and would escape attention if not actually  looked for. Those which are mere puddles, and have only a brief  existence in rainy weather, seldom reward the labour of investigation;  but others are permanent, except after prolonged drought, and afford  convenient situations for the growth of confervae, star-weed, and other  plants. These will nearly always repay the microscopic collector during  the winter, when he must break the ice to get at their contents; in  spring, when long chains of frog-spawn afford ocular evidence of the  prolific properties of the Batrachian reptiles; and in summer, when  they afford both shade and sunshine to their numerous inhabitants. Small  beetles, water-spiders, larvae of gnats, and other insects, rotifers,  including the tubicolar sorts, and several varieties of infusoria may be  expected and generally found. There is, however, a curious fact about  ponds, big and little, which Pritchard remarks upon in his 'Infusoria,'  and which corresponds with our own experience, that those which have  proved to be well stocked with any particular creature during one year,  will very likely contain none of it in the next. There are of course  exceptions to this rule, but we have often been astonished and  disappointed at finding the complete change, both in populousness and  population, that a revolution of twelve months will make; and it would  be extremely interesting to notice the changes that took place during a  term of years.    Such researches might unfold some unexpected laws in the succession of  infusorial life. Those germs which are most widely diffused, will be the  most likely to be developed in any mass of convenient water; but how and  why the rarer forms come and go is very imperfectly understood. Slight  modifications in surrounding circumstances will materially affect the  result. Thus, if we bring home a handful of conferva, and a few  water-plants of higher organisation, such as duckweed and anacharis, and  place the whole in a glass jar full of pond-water, we shall at first  have a good stock of objects; but they will usually grow less and less,  until scarcely anything is left. If, however, we introduce a few pieces  of straw, or a tiny wisp of hay, we shall succeed much better, and not  only preserve our population longer, but enjoy a succession of animated  crops. Extensive decomposition of vegetable matter kills off all but  certain families, such as Paramecia, who enjoy it; on the other hand,  too little decomposition proves fatal to some creatures, by depriving  them of their food, and when they have died off, those who depended upon  them for a living, die too. Different vegetables in decomposition suit  different creatures, and hay and straw in that state seem to please the  largest number. An animalcule tank will succeed best when it contains  two or three kinds of growing plants, which oxygenize the air, and a  moderate variety of decomposing organisms will supply food without  making the water offensive.    From these considerations it will be apparent that not only the nature  of the vegetation of a pond, which is often changed by accidental  circumstances, but also the quality of the odds and ends that the winds  may blow into it, or which may fall through the air, will do much to  determine the character and number of its inhabitants, while the  quantity of shade or sunshine it enjoys, will also exercise an important  influence. Hay and other infusions have from the beginning of  microscopic investigations been employed to obtain the creatures which  the Germans call \"Infusions thierchen\" (infusion animalcules), and the  English \"Infusoria;\" but very little has yet been done in the way of  their scientific culture and management.    To return from this digression to our little Hampstead ponds, we  obtained from one, in September, that was full of star-weed, a number of  sugar-loaf bodies, adhering to one another, and of a pale yellow brown  colour. The specimens first examined looked complete in themselves, and  were taken for eggs of some water creature. Further search, however,  disclosed aggregations of similar sugar-loaves that had evidently formed  part of a tubular structure, and the idea at once occurred that they  were fragments of a Melicerta tube, a conclusion that was verified by  finding some tubes entire and a dead Melicerta in the rubbish at the  bottom. All the specimens of Melicerta tubes we had hitherto examined  were composed of _rounded_ pellets, but these were made of pointed cones  or sugar-loaves, with the points projecting outwards from the general  surface. In Pritchard's 'Infusoria,' these pellets are described \"as  small lenticular bodies.\" The 'Micrographic Dictionary' states that the  tubes of the Melicerta are composed of \"numerous rounded or discoidal  bodies;\" and Mr. Gosse, in his 'Tenby,' which contains an admirable  description, and an exquisite drawing of this interesting rotifer, calls  the pellets \"round.\"    [Illustration: Melicerta ringens.]    Not being able to obtain a living specimen of the Melicerta, who made  her tube of long sugar-loaves, I could not tell whether she differed in  structure from the usual pattern of her race, but the general appearance  of the dead body was the same. It is possible that these creatures  possess some power of modifying the form of their singular bricks, or  they may at different ages vary the patterns, which matters some  fortunate possessor of a colony of these animals may be able to  verify.    [Illustration: Scaridium longicaudum.]    In the sediment of the water containing the Melicerta cases was found an  animalcule about 1--120\" long, covered with cilia, and having a  proboscis seldom more than a quarter of the length assumed by the body,  which continually changed its form, sometimes elongating, sometimes  shortening, and often contracting one side into a deep fissure. It was,  probably, an _Amphileptus_, though not precisely agreeing with any  drawing or description I am acquainted with. Another inmate of the same  water was a lively long-tailed rotifer, with a small oval body, a tuft  of vibrating cilia and a curved bristle visible among them on one side.  This creature had a jointed tail-foot, ending in two long style-shaped  toes, and by means of this appendage executed rapid leaps or springs. It  was the _Scaridium longicaudum_, and agreed in dimensions tolerably well  with the size given in the books, namely, total length 1--72\". With a  power of five hundred diameters the muscles of the tail-foot presented  a beautifully striated appearance.    Towards the end of the month I passed the Vale of Heath Pond, Hampstead,  and although I had not gone out for the purpose of collecting, was  fortunately"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36922"],[0,"Antarctic Penguins: A Study of Their Social Habits (#15)"],[1,"flippers or legs, I spared, and  the next day nearly all of these seemed to be doing well. One bird I  found sitting on two eggs which were in the middle of a rivulet of  water, so I lifted them out and put them on dry ground close by, but the  parent would have nothing to do with them after this.      [Illustration: Fig. 64. ADELIES ON THE ICE-FOOT]    A feature of the above scene, which one could not help noticing, was  that however badly a penguin was injured it was never molested by the  others, as is almost invariably the rule among other birds, including  their near neighbours the skuas. I have seen a sick skua hunted  continuously for over an hour by a mob of its own kind who would not  allow it to settle on the ice for a moment's rest.    Another item of my list requiring explanation is \"snow-drifts.\"    During both spring and summer there are occasional snowstorms, and  during these the birds sit tight on their nests, sometimes being covered  up by drift. As a rule the bird on the nest keeps a space open by poking  its head upwards through the snow, but sometimes it becomes completely  buried. Air diffuses so rapidly through snow that death does not take  place by suffocation, and the bird can live for weeks beneath a drift,  sitting on its nest in the little chamber which it has thawed out by its  own warmth. Generally after a few hours the snow abates and settles down  sufficiently to expose the nest once more, but sometimes a breeze  springs up which is not strong enough to blow the snow away, but simply  hardens the surface of the drift into a crust which lasts for several  weeks, and the birds are imprisoned in consequence. Then little black  dots are seen about the surface of the drift, which are the heads of  penguins thrust through their breathing holes.    On one such occasion I witnessed an interesting little incident. An  imprisoned hen was poking her neck up through her breathing hole when  her mate spied her and came up. He appeared to be very angry with her  for remaining so long on the nest, being unable to grasp the reason, and  after swearing at her for some time he started to peck at her head, she  retaliating as far as her cramped position would allow. When she  withdrew her head, he thrust his down the hole till she drove it out  again, and as this state of things seemed to be going on indefinitely, I  came up and loosened the crust of snow which imprisoned her, on which  she burst out, and seemed glad to do so. She was covered with mire,  having for many days been sitting in a pool of thaw water which had  swamped her nest and evidently spoilt the eggs. When I put her back on  the nest, she sat there for some time, but eventually they both  deserted. I should say that some hundreds of nests were spoilt in this  way.      [Illustration: Fig. 65. ADELIES ON THE ICE-FOOT]    As I photographed the above incident at intervals, different stages are  seen on Figs. 67 to 69.    I have mentioned that eggs got lost owing to cocks fighting among the  nests. When hens are incubating the eggs they never leave the nest under  any circumstances until relieved by their mates, being most reliable and  faithful to their charge. They squabble continually with their nearest  neighbours, whom they seem to hate, but only retaliate on those within  reach, using their bills only to peck at each other's heads without  shifting their position.    The cocks, however, are less dependable. Starting a quarrel in the same  way as the hens do, their militant instincts soon became aroused, on  which they are apt to jump up and start a furious fight with flippers,  staggering to and fro over their nests, and very often spilling the  eggs, which are lost in consequence. On certain occasions I was able to  interfere between the combatants, and replace the eggs, on which they  would return to their domestic duties and seem to forget the incident. A  good many eggs must have been lost in this way during the season.    Late in the season an occurrence took place for which I have never been  able to find any explanation. Occasionally I had noticed that the  penguins had crowded together more than usual on the ice-foot,  multitudes of them standing for hours without any apparent purpose. A  good idea of this scene may be got from the frontispiece.    One morning Mr. Priestley came into the hut and told me that \"the  penguins were drilling on the sea-ice,\" and that I had better come and  look at them. I went with him to the ice-foot, and this is what we saw.    Many thousands of Adelies were on the sea-ice between the ice-foot and  the open water leads, then some quarter of a mile distant. Near the  ice-foot they were congregating in little bands of a few dozen, whilst  farther out near the water, massed bands some thousands strong stood  silent and motionless. Both the small and the large bands kept an almost  rectangular formation, whilst in each band all the birds faced the same  way, though different bands faced in different directions.      [Illustration: Fig. 66. ADELIES ON THE ICE-FOOT]    As we watched it became evident that something very unusual was going  on. First, from one of the small bands, a single bird suddenly appeared,  ran a few yards in the direction of another small band, and stopped. In  the flash of a moment the entire band from which he came executed the  movement \"left turn,\" this bringing them all into a position facing him.  So well ordered was the movement that we could scarcely believe our  eyes. Then from the small band our single bird had approached, another  single bird ran out, upon which his own party did exactly as the first  had done, so that the two bands now stood facing one another, some  fifteen yards apart.      [Illustration: ARROW SHOWS DIRECTION IN WHICH ALL THE BIRDS FACED]    Then spontaneously, the two bands marched straight toward one another,  and joined to form one body. After this we saw the same procedure being  enacted in many other places, the penguins coming down from the rookery  and forming small bands which joined together. Then the augmented bodies  would join other augmented bodies, to form still larger ones, which then  joined together, and so on until a great mass of birds stood together in  rows all facing in one direction like a regiment of soldiers. One of  these masses stood not far from us, a compact rectangular gathering, as  shown on page 109.    They stood thus for a long time, quite motionless and silent, when  suddenly as before, a single bird darted out from among the crowd and  ran a few yards toward the open water, when, as if it had received a  word of command, every bird faced left as in the diagram below.      [Illustration: ARROW SHOWS DIRECTION IN WHICH ALL THE BIRDS FACED]    After this the whole crowd marched for the water, keeping its formation  almost unchanged till it arrived at the edge of the ice, when it halted,  and subsequently entered the water in batches.      [Illustration: Fig. 67. \"An Imprisoned Hen was Poking her Head up    through her Breathing Hole\"]      [Illustration: Fig. 68. \"Her mate appeared to be very angry with her,    being unable to grasp the reason why she could not come off the nest\"    (Page 106)]    This procedure continued for many hours, the penguins that day observing  this extraordinary behaviour, the most astonishing part of which lay in  the accuracy of their drill-like movements, so that we might have been  watching a lot of soldiers on parade. Perhaps the sudden motions of  these bodies of birds were brought about by a sound uttered by the  single bird which acted as leader, though we did not hear this. The  actual reason for this departure from their usual customs is beyond my  knowledge. There was nothing to be seen to account for it, but the  penguins evidently obeyed some instinct which affected them all on this  and two subsequent occasions, when the same thing took place.    My own idea is that in former times the penguins used to mass together  as other birds do, before their annual migration, perhaps as far back as  the day when their wings were adapted for flight, and that the  phenomenon described above was a relic of their bygone instincts.    When the chicks' down has been moulted and their plumage acquired, they  proceed to the water's edge and here they learn to swim.    In the autumn of 1912, at a small rookery which I came upon on  Inexpressible Island, I had an opportunity of watching their first  attempts in this direction. Crowds of young Adelies were to be seen on  the pebbly beach below their rookery, much of the ice having disappeared  at this late season, leaving bare patches of shingle which were very  suitable for the first swimming lesson.    Many old birds paddled in for a short distance, and crouching in a few  inches of water, splashed about with their flippers to give the  youngsters a lead. Some of the latter needed little encouragement, and  took readily to the strange element, very soon swimming about in deep  water, but others seemed more timid, and these latter were urged in  every possible way by the old birds, some of whom could be seen walking  in and out of the water, and so doing what they could to give their  charges confidence.    In this duty one or two old birds might be seen with a little crowd of  youngsters, so that evidently the social instincts which gave rise to  the creche system in the first place were extended to the tuition of the  young and thus to their preparation for the journey north.      [Illustration: Fig. 69. \"When she broke out, they became reconciled\"    (Page 106)]      [Illustration: Fig. 70. Adelie's Nests on Top of Cape Adare, to reach    which they must make a Precipitous Climb of 1000 feet (Page 98)]    Up in the rookery, fully fledged youngsters could be seen clamouring in  vain for food, the old birds resolutely refusing to feed them now that  they were able to forage for themselves.
