First, our sample has the basic theoretical form expected of a stable  deer herd; i.e., the youngest year class contained the most members,  and each older cohort included fewer (fig. 7). Second, the age  structure of our sample has the same form as most other deer age  structures from widely diverse areas, (Ontario, Pimlott _et al._ 1969;  southern Minnesota, Erickson _et al._ 1961; Massachusetts, Shaw 1951).  Third, there is no reason to believe that in our area rifle hunting is  especially selective for any particular age classes. In talking with  large numbers of hunters, we have learned that most shoot at any and  all deer they happen to see.    Even if the age structure of the hunter-kill sample did not approximate  that of the actual herd, the comparison of the wolf-kill with the  theoretical population dictates the same conclusion: the rate of kill  of older deer by wolves was several times greater than that of younger  deer, excluding fawns (fig. 13). In any case, if the actual deer  population in our study area had an age structure similar to that of  our sample of wolf-kills (which would be the only age structure that  would contradict our conclusion), its numbers would be declining by  orders of magnitude each year, and there would now be only a remnant  population. Such obviously is not the case.    The only other question that might arise from a comparison of the age  structure of our wolf-killed deer with that of the hunter-killed deer  concerns the area from which each sample was taken. Fifty of our  wolf-kills came from a region almost inaccessible to hunters (fig. 1).  However, the other 92 came from the same general area as the  hunter-kills. Nevertheless, there was no statistically significant  difference in age structure between the wolf-kills from the wilderness  versus those from the hunted area (table 1). This fact also suggests  that the human hunting in the area is relatively light and has little  effect on the age structure of the deer population in the area.    Wolves may also be taking a disproportionately high number of fawns,  although our data do not show this. Nevertheless, there may be a bias  against fawns in our method. It is not unusual to discover the remains  of a wolf-killed deer so completely eaten that there is no indication  left of the animal's age. Because fawns often are only about half the  size of adult deer, and their skeletons have not yet completely  ossified, the chances are better that fawns will be more completely  eaten. Pimlott _et al._ (1969) also recognized this possible bias,  although their data did indicate that wolves were killing a higher  percentage of fawns than occurred in the population.    Our study does support the other conclusion of Pimlott _et al._ (1969),  based on a study of 331 kills, that wolf predation on deer during  winter shows a definite selection for older animals. It does not agree  with the tentative conclusion of Stenlund (1955) that wolves in the  Superior National Forest do not prey disproportionately on old deer.  However, Stenlund's conclusion was based on 36 kills and on the  assumption that only deer at least 7 years old were \"old.\" Deer 5 years  old and older composed 33 percent of Stenlund's sample, a figure  considerably higher than the 10 percent in these age classes in our  hunter-kill sample (table 4). Thus Stenlund's data do not contradict  our conclusion.    The age of 5 years seems to be the beginning of the period of  vulnerability for adult deer. Although 5 years might not seem  especially old, there are two aspects of significance concerning deer  of this age and older. First, they are in the second half of the life  span for most members of the species, and their alertness and ability  to bolt quickly away might be expected to decline. It is of interest in  this regard that Klein and Olson (1960, p. 87) believed 5 years of age  to be \"the upper limit of physiological efficiency\" of black-tailed  deer (_Odocoileus hemionus_) in Alaska. Second, up to the age of at  least 4-1/2 years, and perhaps beyond, the apparent  weight-load-on-track of deer increases with age (Kelsall 1969). Thus  older deer would sink farther into the snow than younger ones, and  their escape might be slowed and hindered more. For further discussion  of the effect of snow on the vulnerability of deer, see Mech _et al._  (p. 51).      Sex Ratio    Statistical tests comparing a number of subsamples of both wolf-killed  deer and hunter-killed deer showed a series of significantly different  sex ratios (tables 1-3). The ratio of males to females in the fawn  cohort of the hunter-kill, which is probably the most representative of  the actual fawn sex ratio, was even (table 2). With wolf-kills,  however, a significantly higher percentage of females was taken in the  fawn subsample (59 percent) than in the adult subsample (46 percent).  These results compare favorably with those of Stenlund (1955), who  found that from 1948 to 1953 in the same area as the present study 68  percent of 19 sexable fawn wolf-kills were females and 44 percent of 63  sexable adult wolf-kills were females.    If the sex ratio of fawns began even, and more females than males were  killed by wolves, then a higher proportion of males would be left in  the adult population, unless some other mortality factor kills more  male fawns. Thus it is not surprising that in the wilderness area,  where little or no hunting is done, the sex ratio of wolf-kills in the  adult cohort is significantly heavy toward males (71 percent: 29  percent). This was also true of the wolf-kills in Algonquin Provincial  Park, where males made up 57 percent of the total sexable wolf-kill  (Pimlott _et al._ 1969). The latter figure may even have been higher if  calculated for adults alone, for a preponderance of female fawns in the  Algonquin Park data (such as occurred in our and Stenlund's samples)  would tend to obscure the preponderance of males in the adult sample.    The adult subsample of hunter-kills also contained a higher percentage  of males (66 percent : 34 percent). Although this might also reflect  the influence of wolf predation on female fawns, it probably is more a  result of the greater movement of bucks during the hunting season,  which overlaps with the rutting season. Even the sex ratio of adult  deer killed in wolf-free areas shows a preponderance of males (Erickson  _et al._ 1961).    However, it appears that the higher harvest of bucks by human hunters  does markedly affect the sex ratio of the deer population in the hunted  area, for the wolf-kill of adults in that area contained a  significantly higher percentage of does (56 percent) than did the  wolf-kill of adults in the wilderness area (29 percent).    Evidently the hunter harvest is not heavy enough to affect the age  structure of the deer population to any marked degree, for no  significant difference in age structure was found between the wolf-kill  in the hunted area and that in the wilderness area (table 1). This does  not conflict with the conclusion that hunting affects the sex ratio of  the deer herd, because it would take much less to influence a  population characteristic having two classes (sex) than one having 14  (age).    One additional difference in the sex ratio was found between two other  subsamples of the wolf-kill--that is, the wolf-kill before and after an  unusually high snow accumulation, which reached its peak about February  1, 1969 (table 1). Of a total of 77 animals killed before this snow  condition occurred (including those from previous years), 38 percent  were females. Of 44 animals killed after the heavy accumulation, 57  percent were females. One possible explanation for this is that females  may normally be less vulnerable to wolf predation, for Kelsall (1969)  has shown that they probably have a lighter weight-load-on-track than  males. Thus when snow conditions changed greatly, making deer generally  much more vulnerable to wolves (see Mech _et al._, p. 35), a  preponderance of does suddenly might have become available. There is  some evidence that does may be generally less vulnerable under most  conditions, for all seven of our wolf-killed deer over 10 years old  were females, and the oldest was over 14.      Condition of Wolf-Killed Deer    Because the data show that wolves in our study area tend to kill a  disproportionate number of older deer, it is not surprising to discover  that wolves also tend to capture a disproportionate number of  individuals with abnormalities and pathological conditions (table 8).  The explanation for such selection is obvious in regard to the  abnormalities of the lower limbs (figs. 14-17): deer with injured or  abnormal limbs simply cannot run as fast or as agilely as normal  animals (table 7). Our observations show that deer usually depend on  their alertness and speed to escape approaching wolves (Mech 1966b,  Mech _et al._, p. 1). Any trait or condition that tended to interfere  with either alertness or speed would decrease an individual's chance of  escape.    It is more difficult to explain how dental abnormalities or  pathological conditions of the mandible (figs. 8-10) would predispose  an individual to wolf predation. However, in the case of dental  abnormalities the genetic or environmental conditions that caused the  abnormality might also have caused some other trait that increased the  animal's vulnerability. Or the abnormal condition itself may have  caused a further, more critical, disruption of the animal's physiology  or behavior, which in turn predisposed it to wolf predation.    The finding of several wolf-kills with poor fat stores could indicate  that primary or secondary malnutrition was a factor in the animals'  deaths. However, it would take a statistical comparison between the fat  stores of the deer at large and those of the wolf-kills to establish  this.

And  with this good store of money he departed from Rome and set out to  return again to the land of Flanders.    But he had to pay seven ducats for the certificate of his pardon,  all scribed upon parchment.              XXXI      In those days there came to Damme two brothers of the Premonstratensian  Order, sellers of indulgences. And over their monastic robes they  wore beautiful jackets bordered with lace.    When it was fine they stood outside the porch of the church, and under  the porch when it was wet, and there they stuck up their tariff;  and this was the scale of charges: for six liards a hundred years'  indulgence, for one patard two hundred years, three hundred years  for half a sovereign, four hundred years for seven florins, and  so on according to the price--indulgences plenary or semi-plenary,  and pardons for all the most terrible crimes.    And they gave to their patrons, in exchange for payment, little  parchment certificates on which were written out the number of years  of indulgence, and below was the following inscription:              Who wants not to be          Stewed, roasted, fricasseed,          Burning in hell for evermore,          Indulgences let him buy.          Pardon and forgiveness,          For a little money,          God will return to him.      And the eager purchasers came thronging round the monks. One of whom  never left off addressing his audience. This brother had a blooming  countenance, and displayed three chins at least, and a portentous  belly, all without the least embarrassment.    \"Unhappy ones!\" he cried, fixing with his eye now one, now another  of the crowd. \"Unhappy ones! Let me show you a picture. Behold! You  are in hell! The fire burns you most cruelly. You are boiling in  that cauldron full of oil wherein are prepared the olie-koekjes of  Astarte. You are nothing better than a sausage on the frying-pan  of Lucifer, or a leg of mutton on the spit of Guilguiroth, biggest  of all the devils. And first they cut you up in little pieces. Ah,  woe is me! Behold this sinner who despised indulgences! Behold this  plate of daintiness! 'Tis he! 'Tis he! His wicked body thus reduced  by damnation. And for sauce, brimstone and pitch and tar! Thus are  those poor sinners eaten alive to be born again continually to their  pain! And here in all reality is the place of tears and of grinding  of teeth. Have mercy, God of mercy! For now, poor damned one, you are  in hell, and you suffer unspeakable woes. And yet if any there were  to subscribe a denier for you, straightway one of your hands would  find relief; and let but some other give a half a denier and your two  hands would be freed entirely from the pain of the fire. But as for  the remainder of your body, let some one only give a florin, and there  falls the dew of indulgence over all! O freshness of delight! And now  for ten days, a hundred days, a thousand years maybe, according as one  pays, no more roast meat, no more olie-koekjes, no more fricassees  for you! And even if it is not for yourself, is there no one else,  there in the secret depths of the fire, no one else for whom you  would wish to gain relief--one of your parents perhaps, a dear wife,  or some lovely girl with whom you have committed wilful sin?\"    And as he spoke these words, the monk jogged the elbow of his brother  that stood by holding in his hands a silver bowl. And that brother,  lowering his eyes at this signal, shook the bowl unctuously, as if  inviting contributions.    Whereat the preacher continued in this wise: \"Or perhaps you have  a son or a daughter, maybe, in the midst of this terrible fire,  or some beloved little child? Hark, how they cry aloud, and weep,  and call to you by name. Can you remain deaf to their pitiful  voices? You cannot. Even a heart of ice must melt, though it cost  you a carolus! And behold, at the very sound of the carolus as it  strikes this vile metal\" (and here his comrade shook the plate again),  \"a space opens out in the midst of the fire, and the tormented soul  ascends to some volcano mouth where it meets the air, the fresh,  free air! Where are the pains of the fire now? For the sea is close  at hand, and straight into the sea the soul plunges. She swims on her  back, on her stomach, floats upon the waves, dives beneath them. Oh,  listen how she sings aloud in her joy! See how she rolls about in  the water! The very angels gaze down upon her from heaven and are  glad. Eagerly they await her coming; but not yet, not yet has she  had her fill of the sea. If she might only turn into a fish! She  knoweth not how there are prepared for her up aloft sweet baths,  perfumed and scented, with fine bits of sugar-candy floating therein,  all white and fresh like bits of ice. Now a shark appears. She  fears it not at all, but clambers upon its back, and sits there all  unnoticed, hoping he will take her with him down into the depths of  the sea. And now she goes to greet the little water-angels that feed  on waterzoey from coral cauldrons, and on freshest oysters from plates  of mother-of-pearl. And she is welcomed and feted and made much of,  but still the angels in heaven beckon her on high, till at last,  refreshed and happy, you may see her rise aloft, singing like a lark,  up to the highest heaven where God sits in glory on his throne. There  she finds again all her earthly friends and loved ones (save only  those, forsooth, that in this life have spoken ill of indulgences  and of our Holy Mother Church and who burn now for their sin upon the  floor of hell. And so for ever and for ever and for ever to all ages,  in an all-consuming eternity). But that other soul, now dear to God,  refreshes herself in soft baths and crunches sugar-candy. Buy then, my  brothers, buy your indulgences. We sell them for crusats, for florins,  or for English sovereigns. Even copper coin is not refused. Buy then,  buy! This is the Holy Mart! And we have indulgences adapted to the  poor man's purse as well as to the rich man's. Only, I am sorry to  say, my brothers, no credit is allowed. For to buy without paying  cash is a crime most grievous in the eyes of Our Lord.\"    Hereupon the monk who had kept silent shook his platter, and the  florins, crusats, patards, sols, and deniers fell into it as thick  as hail.    Claes, feeling himself rich, paid a florin for an indulgence of ten  thousand years; and the monks delivered to him a piece of parchment  in exchange.    At last, seeing that there was no one left in Damme but the miserly  folk who would not buy indulgences at any price, the two monks left  the village and proceeded on their way to Heyst.              XXXII      In those days the country round Liege was in a disturbed and dangerous  state by reason of the heresy hunts, and Lamme Goedzak came again  to live in Damme. He was married now, and his wife followed him  willingly because the people of Liege, who had a mocking nature,  used to make fun of her husband's meekness.    Lamme often visited Claes, who, since coming into his fortune,  was always to be found at the tavern of the Blauwe Torre, and  had even appropriated one of the tables for himself and his boon  companions. This table was next to the one where sat the Dean of the  Fishmongers, Josse Grypstuiver by name, drinking sparingly from his  half-pint tankard. For he was a miser, a stingy fellow who thought the  world of himself, and lived for the most part on smoked herrings, and  thought more of money than of the safety of his own soul. Now Claes  carried in his pocket that piece of parchment whereon was inscribed  the tale of his ten-thousand-year indulgence.    One evening Claes was drinking at the Blauwe Torre in the company  of Lamme Goedzak, Jan van Roosebeke, and Matthys van Assche, Josse  Grypstuiver also being present. Claes had been imbibing freely, and  Jan Roosebeke was remonstrating with him, saying that it was sin to  drink so much. But Claes replied that a pint too much meant nothing  more serious than an extra half-day in purgatory.    \"Besides,\" said he, \"I have a ten-thousand-year indulgence in my  pocket! Is there any one here that would like a hundred years of  them, I wonder, so that he may indulge his stomach without fear of  the consequences?\"    Every one shouted at once:    \"How much are you selling them at?\"    \"For a pint of beer,\" Claes answered, \"I will give you one hundred  days, but for a muske conyn you shall have a hundred and fifty!\"    Some of the revellers gave Claes a pint of beer, others a piece of ham,  and for each and all Claes cut off a little strip of his parchment. It  was not Claes, forsooth, who consumed the price of his indulgences,  but Lamme Goedzak; and he gorged himself so that he began to swell  visibly; and all the time Claes went on distributing his merchandise  up and down the tavern.    The man Grypstuiver turned a sour face towards him, and asked if he  had an indulgence for ten days.    \"No,\" said Claes, \"that's too small a piece to cut.\"    Every one laughed, and Grypstuiver ate his anger as best he could. Then  Claes went home, followed by Lamme, walking as if his legs were made  of wool.              XXXIII      Towards the end of the third year of her banishment, Katheline returned  to her home in Damme. And continually she cried aloud in her madness:  \"Fire, fire! My head is on fire! My soul is knocking, make a hole,  she wants to get out!\" And if ever she saw an ox or a sheep she would  run from it as if in terror. And she would sit on the bench at the back  of her cottage, under the lime-trees, wagging her head and staring at  the people of Damme as they passed by. But she did not recognize them,  and they called her \"The mad-woman.\"    Meanwhile Ulenspiegel went wandering along the roads and pathways of  the world, and one day he met a donkey on the highway, harnessed with  leather and studs of brass, and its head ornamented with tassels and  plumes of scarlet wool....
