The head is round for  a she-cat, and the ears somewhat large and pointed, but thin and fine in  the hair, the cavity of the ear has _less hair within it_ (also a trait  of the Siamese) than some other short-haired cats, the neck is long and  thin, as are the shoulders. Its habits are the same as those of most  cats. I may add that Mr. Thomas, who is an old friend of mine, has had  this breed many years, and kept it perfectly pure.    [Illustration]          VARIOUS COLOURS.      Those who have had much to do with breeding, and crossing of animals,  birds, or plants, well know that with time, leisure, and patience, how  comparatively easy it is to improve, alter, enlarge, or diminish any of  these, or any part of them; and looking at the cat from this standpoint,  now that it is becoming \"a fancy\" animal, there is no prophesying what  forms, colours, markings, or other variations will be made by those who  understand what can be done by careful, well-considered matching, and  skilful selection. We have now cats with no tails, short tails, and some  of moderate length, long tails bushy and hairy; but should a very long  tail be in request, I have no doubt whatever but that in a few years it  would be produced; and now that there is a cat club constituted for the  welfare and improvement of the condition, as well as the careful  breeding of cats, curious and unforeseen results are most likely to be  attained; but whether any will ever excel the many beautiful varieties  we now have, is a problem that remains to be solved.    This concludes the numerous varieties of _colours_ and the proper  markings of the domestic cat, as regards beauty and the points of  excellence to be observed for the purposes of exhibition. These are  distinct, and as such, nearly all have classes for each individual  colour and marking, and therefore it is imperative that the owner should  note carefully the different properties and beauties of his or her  particular specimen, and also as carefully read the schedule of prizes  with such attention as to be enabled to enter his or her pet in the  proper class; for, it is not only annoying to the exhibitor but to the  judge to find an animal sometimes of extraordinary merit placed in the  \"wrong class\" by _sheer inattention_ to the _printed rules_ and  instructions prepared by the committee or promoters of the show. It is  exceedingly distasteful, and I may say almost distressing, to a judge  to find a splendid animal wrongly entered, and so to feel himself  compelled to \"pass it,\" and to affix the words fatal to all chance of  winning--\"Wrong class.\" Again let me impress on exhibitors to be  careful--very careful--in this matter--this matter of entry--for I may  say it is one of the reasons which has led to my placing these notes on  paper, though I have done so with much pleasure, and with earnest hope  that they will be found of some value and service to the \"uninitiated.\"    Of course there are, as there must be, a number of beautiful shades of  colour, tints, and markings that are difficult to define or describe;  colours and markings that are intermediate with those noticed; but  though in themselves they are extremely interesting, and even very  beautiful, they do not come within the range of the classes for certain  definite forms of lines, spots, or colourings, as I have endeavoured to  point out, and, indeed, it was almost impossible to make a sufficient  number of classes to comprehend the whole. Therefore it has been  considered wisest and even necessary as the most conducive to the best  interests of the exhibitor and also to simplify the difficulties of  judging, and for the maintenance of the various forms of beauty of the  cat, to have classes wherein they are shown under rules of colour,  points of beauty and excellence that are \"hard and fast,\" and by this  means all may not only know how and in what class to exhibit, but also  what their chance is of \"taking honours.\"    As I have just stated, there are intermediate colours, markings, and  forms, so extra classes have been provided for these, under the heading  of \"any other variety of colour,\" and \"any other variety not before  mentioned,\" and \"any cats of peculiar structure.\" In this last case, the  cats that have abnormal formations, such as seven toes, or even nine on  their fore and hind legs, peculiar in other ways, such as three legs, or  only two legs, as I have seen, may be exhibited. I regard these,  however, as malformations, and not to be encouraged, being generally  devoid of beauty, and lacking interest for the ordinary observer, and  they also tend to create a morbid taste for the unnatural and ugly,  instead of the beautiful; the beautiful, be it what it may, is always  pleasant to behold; and there is but little, if any, doubt in my mind  but that the constant companionship of even a beautiful cat must have a  soothing effect. Therefore, not in cats only, but in all things have the  finest and best. Surround yourself with the elegant, the graceful, the  brilliant, the beautiful, the agile, and the gentle. Be it what it may,  animal, bird, or flower, be careful to have the best. A man, it is said,  is made more or less by his environments, and doubtless this is to a  great extent, if not entirely, a fact; that being so, the contemplation  of the beautiful must have its quieting, restful influences, and tend to  a brighter and happier state of existence. I am fully aware there are  many that may differ from me, though I feel sure I am not far wrong when  I aver there are few animals really more beautiful than a cat. If it is  a good, carefully selected specimen, well kept, well cared for, in high  condition, in its prime of life, well-trained, graceful in every line,  bright in colour, distinct in markings, supple and elegant in form,  agile and gentle in its ways, it is beautiful to look at and must  command admiration. Yes! the contemplation of the beautiful elevates the  mind, if only in a cat; beauty of any kind, is beauty, and has its  refining influences.    [Illustration]          USEFULNESS OF CATS.      In our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cats? In our  sitting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchens and storerooms, our  farms, barns, and rickyards, in our docks, our granaries, our ships, and  our wharves, in our corn markets, meat markets, and other places too  numerous to mention, how useful they are! In our ships, however, the  rats oft set them at defiance; still they are of great service.    How wonderfully patient is the cat when watching for rats or mice,  awaiting their egress from their place of refuge or that which is their  home! How well Shakespeare in _Pericles_, Act iii., describes this keen  attention of the cat to its natural pursuit!        The cat, with eyne of burning coal,      Now crouches from (before) the mouse's hole.    A slight rustle, and the fugitive comes forth; a quick, sharp, resolute  motion, and the cat has proved its usefulness. Let any one have a plague  of rats and mice, as I once had, and let them be delivered therefrom by  cats, as I was, and they will have a lasting and kind regard for them.    A friend not long since informed me that a cat at Stone's Distillery was  seen to catch two rats at one time, a fore foot on each. All the cats  kept at this establishment, and there are several, are of the red tabby  colour, and therefore most likely all males.    I am credibly informed of a still more extraordinary feat of a cat in  catching mice, that of a red tabby cat which on being taken into a  granary at Sevenoaks where there were a number of mice, dashed in among  a retreating group, and secured four, one with each paw and two in her  mouth.    At the office of _The Morning Advertiser_, I am informed by my old  friend Mr. Charles Williams, they boast of a race of cats bred there for  nearly half a century. In colour these are mostly tortoiseshell, and  some are very handsome.    The Government, mindful also of their utility, pay certain sums, which  are regularly passed through the accounts quarterly, for the purpose of  providing and keeping cats in our public offices, dockyards, stores,  shipping, etc., thereby proving, if proof were wanting, their  acknowledged worth.    In Vienna four cats are employed by the town magistrates to catch mice  on the premises of the municipality. A regular allowance is voted for  their keep, and, after a limited period of active service, they are  placed on the \"retired list,\" with a comfortable pension.           *       *       *       *       *    There are also a number of cats in the service of the United States Post  Office. These cats are distributed over the different offices to protect  the bags from being eaten by rats and mice, and the cost of providing  for them is duly inscribed in the accounts. When a birth takes place,  the local postmaster informs the district superintendent of the fact,  and obtains an addition to his rations.           *       *       *       *       *    A short time ago, the budget of the Imperial Printing Office in France,  amongst other items, contained one for cats, which caused some merriment  in the legislative chamber during its discussion. According to the  _Pays_ these cats are kept for the purpose of destroying the numerous  rats and mice which infest the premises, and cause considerable damage  to the large stock of paper which is always stored there. This feline  staff is fed twice a day, and a man is employed to look after them; so  that for cats' meat and the keeper's salary no little expense is  annually incurred; sufficient, in fact, to form a special item in the  national expenditure.    Mr. W. M. Acworth, in his excellent book, \"The Railways of England,\"  gives a very interesting account of the usefulness of the cat. He says,  writing of the Midland Railway: \"A few miles further off, however--at  Trent--is a still more remarkable portion of"]]]
