I have little doubt more than one species exist among the supposed  varieties of the true _Bulla fasciata_ of Linn., which I take to be the  shell figured by Lister.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 42    [Illustration]    OLIVA Braziliana,    _Brazilian Olive_           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Testa cylindrica, polita; spira conica, acuminata, brevissima; labium      exterius simplex, interius incrassatum, tumidum; columella plicis      numerosis gracilibus; apertura basi truncata, emarginata._    Typus Genericus _Voluta Porphyrea_ Lin.

The strict followers of Linnaeus, by thus  rejecting generic distinctions, which at once convey a definite idea of  form and structure, contribute to render systematic arrangement less  expressive of ideas than the common nomenclature of our sale catalogues: a  striking proof of the pertinacity with which we cherish those particular  doctrines we first imbibed, although an unbiassed reasoning and an  attentive observance of nature would convince us of their fallacy.    The great Linnaeus, at the time he formed that system which laid the  foundation of systematic nomenclature, had not the materials for gathering  and combining those natural genera which the immense discoveries made since  his death have given us a knowledge of. He accordingly arranged those few  shells known to him, in large, and for the most part natural, groups. That  of _Voluta_ I consider as one of these last (excepting the first division);  but the great accession of species now known, and which is still  increasing, has long ago induced the principal Continental writers to  divide this very extensive family into the following genera: _Marginella_  (Date shells), _Oliva_ (Olives), _Mitra_ (Mitres), _Turbinellus_ (Turnip  shells), _Voluta_ (Volutes), ...; all possessing not only clear but natural  characters; inasmuch as, by such an arrangement, those interesting links  and ramifications that connect this family with the _Bullae_, _Cones_,  _Cowries_, _Murices_, and other genera, can be traced; and which perhaps  affords the most fascinating and intellectual source of contemplation and  study the science can bestow.    The peculiarity of this species will distinguish it among this numerous and  intricate family. The basal suture is deeply channeled; those on the spire  covered by the polished callosity which spreads from the inner lip.    Mr. Dillwyn has adopted the unpublished name of Solander, although the  shell had long ago been described and named by Martini and Lamarck. I  consider this as contrary to that principle of nomenclature which awards a  preference to priority of publication; and I have therefore restored the  name of those authors who have this undoubted claim. Mr. Dillwyn's  description is very clear and good.    I cannot learn from what particular part of Brazil this species has been  received.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 43    [Illustration]    MELLIPHAGA auricomis,    _Yellow-tufted Honeysucker._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.

It is singular, that while our first ornithological writers were  distributing the numerous species of these birds in their systems, under  such of the Linnaean genera as they thought most adapted for their  reception, a naturalist of a remote colony should be the first who, by  creating a new genus, brought them all into their proper situation in  systematic arrangement; one of the many proofs that Nature, and Nature  only, is to be studied; and that no system, however ingenious or however  applauded, can be considered as infallible.    By an error (no doubt of the press) in the specific character of this bird  in Latham's Index, the eye stripe is called _white_, though in the  description it is termed black. Mr. Stephens has copied this error into  \"General Zoology;\" and his description of this bird, as well as numberless  others, seems merely an abridgement or alteration of Latham's; a practice  highly detrimental to science; for, when an original description cannot be  obtained, it is much better, and safer, to copy without disguise that of  another.    How far all the birds included by Temminck in this genus really belong to  it, admits of very great doubt; I have therefore constructed the generic  character from those birds of New Holland only which Lewin, who founded the  genus, must have had before him.    Total length seven inches and a half; bill seven-tenths, the frontal  feathers advancing half its length to the nostrils; those of the ears are  lengthened, but the yellow tuft behind them is much more so; the feathers  of the chin are small, thick-set, and ending in fine setaceous hairs curved  outwards; the breast and body pale brownish-yellow. Quills and tail  dark-brown, margined with deep-yellowish; the two lateral tail-feathers  tipt with dirty white; plumage above olive-brown; front and crown of the  head dark brownish-yellow; bill black; legs brownish, inner-toe very deeply  cleft. Tail, from the rump, three inches and a half long, and slightly  rounded.    Latham, who first described this bird, says, \"it makes its nest on the  extreme pendent branches of low trees or shrubs, and by this means escapes  the plunder of smaller quadrupeds.\" It appears not uncommon in New South  Wales.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 44    [Illustration]    PTEROGLOSUS sulcatus,    _Grooved-bill Aracari._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Rostrum capite longius, crassum, inane, cultratum, basali margine      incrassatum, maxillae angulo frontali obtuso; tomia serrata: nares      superae in maxillae basi: lingua angusta, pennacea.

Legs and claws short, slender,  and pale.    This bird would obviously belong to the second division which I had  proposed in my former remarks on _Platyrhynchus_, and it is in every  respect allied to _P. Ceylonensis_, _Pl._ 13. My reasons for disturbing  this previous arrangement have been already given; and, until a complete  investigation is made of the immense genus of Flycatchers, I concur with M.  Temminck in the distribution which he has proposed; viz. the arrangement of  the European species under the old genus of _Muscicapa_, and of the exotic  under that of _Muscipeta_; the characters of which, however, are very  imperfect: they are, indeed, at variance with this bird, which has the  outer and middle toe connected only to the _first_ joint, and the inner toe  cleft to the base.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 117    [Illustration]    NECTARINIA cyanocephala,    _Blue-headed Nectarinia._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.

According to the  Linnaean system it should have been rather placed with the Creepers than  the Warblers; an error which has been continued by every subsequent writer,  even by Professor Temminck, whose skilful and accurate perception of  natural affinities is, in general, so remarkably correct.    That these two birds, however dissimilar in colour, are the sexes only of  one species, repeated dissections in their native country have put beyond  all doubt; and that it is a genuine _Nectarinia_ (or _Caereba_ of Temminck)  will appear from submitting it to a rigorous comparison with the characters  the Professor himself has laid down for that genus.    Its habits are no less perfectly the same as the rest of the _Nectariniae_;  it is one of the commonest birds of Brazil, and appears spread over the  whole extent of that country. It frequents the same trees as the  Humming-birds, hopping from flower to flower, and extracting the nectar  from each; but this is not done on the wing, because its formation is  obviously different from the Humming-birds, which, on the contrary, poise  themselves in the air during feeding. The shortness of the bill has  evidently given rise to this bird being placed with the Warblers; but this  organ is not shorter in proportion than it is in _Nectarinia spiza_,  (_Certhia spiza_ of Latham).    I am unacquainted with the other varieties of this species mentioned by  authors. Of the bird here described, I have never seen any variety, either  in Brazil or in our museums. The young males, as usual before moulting,  have the colours of the female; one of them, in an intermediate state, is  in my possession. As both the figures are of the size of life, and  accurately coloured, a fuller description is unnecessary. The rich sky-blue  of the male, in some lights, becomes greenish, and in others dark blue. The  bill, like that of all the genuine _Nectariniae_, is slightly notched a  little way from the tip, and the base is much broader than high.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 118    [Illustration]    CONUS Generalis,    _Flambeau Cone._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 65.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _C. testa gracili, fusca, fasciis albidis strigis undatis      longitudinalibus interruptis ornata; spirae productae apice acuto,      anfractibus concavis, laevibus; basi nigra._        Shell slender, brown, with white bands, interrupted by longitudinal      stripes; spire produced, the tip acute, whorls concave, smooth; base      black.

These relative distinctions may be comprised in a few words; they rest  principally on the spire, which in _C. generalis_ has the upper half much  lengthened, slender, and acuminated: in _C. maldivus_ the spire is thick  and much shorter: the whorls in both these species are quite plain, and  nearly flat: the spire of _C. cinctus_ resembles the last in form, but is  deeply concave and striated. These characters are, I think, very  satisfactory as specific distinctions.    On the other hand, some attention to these shells lately, has convinced me  that many of the species formed both by Bruguiere and Lamarck should be  more correctly considered as varieties; inasmuch as their specific  distinctions rest, for the most part, on _colour_ alone: this appears,  indeed, to be the leading character selected by these eminent  conchologists, and to which, therefore, they have attached the greatest  importance. From this opinion, however, I completely dissent; on the  principle, that no character which is variable can, with any consistency,  be made use of to express permanent distinctions, when not supported by  peculiarity of formation or sculpture. The great art in framing the  description of a species consists in singling out those characters alone  which are most permanent, and exist in every variety of that species; for,  when once a character is found to be variable, it no longer becomes a  distinction by which a species can be recognised. I consider, therefore,  formation and sculpture as the only certain characters of species, and that  variation of colour should alone distinguish varieties.    It is therefore not surprising that the specific characters given by MM.  Bruguiere and Lamarck, and resting principally on the colours of these  shells, are frequently obscure, and always long; two inevitable evils  attending every attempt to describe minutely the colour, form, and  disposition of the markings of shells. In justice, however, to these great  naturalists, it should be observed, that in this attempt they have done  that best which no writer has ever done well.    The spire of _C. generalis_ is generally spotted, and the white band on the  margin of the body whorl, more or less crossed by broad waved stripes of a  dark brown. It is an inhabitant of many parts of the Indian Ocean.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 119    [Illustration]    AMPULLARIA globosa,    _Round Apple Snail._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 103.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _A. testa globosa, laevissima, olivacea; spira depressa; aperturae      margine crasso, fulvo, sulcato; umbilico parvo, contracto, juxta basin      posito; operculo testaceo._        Shell globose, very smooth, olive; spire depressed; margin of the      aperture thick, fulvous, grooved; umbilicus small, contracted, placed      near the base; operculum shelly.
