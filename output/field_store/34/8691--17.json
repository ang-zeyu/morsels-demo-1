Thea got her music-book and stole quietly out of the garden. She did not  go home, but wandered off into the sand dunes, where the prickly pear  was in blossom and the green lizards were racing each other in the  glittering light. She was shaken by a passionate excitement. She did not  altogether understand what Wunsch was talking about; and yet, in a way  she knew. She knew, of course, that there was something about her that  was different. But it was more like a friendly spirit than like anything  that was a part of herself. She thought everything to it, and it  answered her; happiness consisted of that backward and forward movement  of herself. The something came and went, she never knew how. Sometimes  she hunted for it and could not find it; again, she lifted her eyes from  a book, or stepped out of doors, or wakened in the morning, and it was  there,--under her cheek, it usually seemed to be, or over her breast,--a  kind of warm sureness. And when it was there, everything was more  interesting and beautiful, even people. When this companion was with  her, she could get the most wonderful things out of Spanish Johnny, or  Wunsch, or Dr. Archie.    On her thirteenth birthday she wandered for a long while about the sand  ridges, picking up crystals and looking into the yellow prickly-pear  blossoms with their thousand stamens. She looked at the sand hills until  she wished she WERE a sand hill. And yet she knew that she was going to  leave them all behind some day. They would be changing all day long,  yellow and purple and lavender, and she would not be there. From that  day on, she felt there was a secret between her and Wunsch. Together  they had lifted a lid, pulled out a drawer, and looked at something.  They hid it away and never spoke of what they had seen; but neither of  them forgot it.          XII    One July night, when the moon was full, Dr. Archie was coming up from  the depot, restless and discontented, wishing there were something to  do. He carried his straw hat in his hand, and kept brushing his hair  back from his forehead with a purposeless, unsatisfied gesture. After he  passed Uncle Billy Beemer's cottonwood grove, the sidewalk ran out of  the shadow into the white moonlight and crossed the sand gully on high  posts, like a bridge. As the doctor approached this trestle, he saw a  white figure, and recognized Thea Kronborg. He quickened his pace and  she came to meet him.    \"What are you doing out so late, my girl?\" he asked as he took her hand.    \"Oh, I don't know. What do people go to bed so early for? I'd like to  run along before the houses and screech at them. Isn't it glorious out  here?\"    The young doctor gave a melancholy laugh and pressed her hand.    \"Think of it,\" Thea snorted impatiently. \"Nobody up but us and the  rabbits! I've started up half a dozen of 'em. Look at that little one  down there now,\"--she stooped and pointed. In the gully below them there  was, indeed, a little rabbit with a white spot of a tail, crouching down  on the sand, quite motionless. It seemed to be lapping up the moonlight  like cream. On the other side of the walk, down in the ditch, there was  a patch of tall, rank sunflowers, their shaggy leaves white with dust.  The moon stood over the cottonwood grove. There was no wind, and no  sound but the wheezing of an engine down on the tracks.    \"Well, we may as well watch the rabbits.\" Dr. Archie sat down on the  sidewalk and let his feet hang over the edge. He pulled out a smooth  linen handkerchief that smelled of German cologne water. \"Well, how goes  it? Working hard? You must know about all Wunsch can teach you by this  time.\"    Thea shook her head. \"Oh, no, I don't, Dr. Archie. He's hard to get at,  but he's been a real musician in his time. Mother says she believes he's  forgotten more than the music-teachers down in Denver ever knew.\"    \"I'm afraid he won't be around here much longer,\" said Dr. Archie. \"He's  been making a tank of himself lately. He'll be pulling his freight one  of these days. That's the way they do, you know. I'll be sorry on your  account.\" He paused and ran his fresh handkerchief over his face. \"What  the deuce are we all here for anyway, Thea?\" he said abruptly.    \"On earth, you mean?\" Thea asked in a low voice.    \"Well, primarily, yes. But secondarily, why are we in Moonstone? It  isn't as if we'd been born here. You were, but Wunsch wasn't, and I  wasn't. I suppose I'm here because I married as soon as I got out of  medical school and had to get a practice quick. If you hurry things, you  always get left in the end. I don't learn anything here, and as for the  people--In my own town in Michigan, now, there were people who liked me  on my father's account, who had even known my grandfather. That meant  something. But here it's all like the sand: blows north one day and  south the next. We're all a lot of gamblers without much nerve, playing  for small stakes. The railroad is the one real fact in this country.  That has to be; the world has to be got back and forth. But the rest of  us are here just because it's the end of a run and the engine has to  have a drink. Some day I'll get up and find my hair turning gray, and  I'll have nothing to show for it.\"    Thea slid closer to him and caught his arm. \"No, no. I won't let you get  gray. You've got to stay young for me. I'm getting young now, too.\"    Archie laughed. \"Getting?\"    \"Yes. People aren't young when they're children. Look at Thor, now; he's  just a little old man. But Gus has a sweetheart, and he's young!\"    \"Something in that!\" Dr. Archie patted her head, and then felt the shape  of her skull gently, with the tips of his fingers. \"When you were  little, Thea, I used always to be curious about the shape of your head.  You seemed to have more inside it than most youngsters. I haven't  examined it for a long time. Seems to be the usual shape, but uncommonly  hard, some how. What are you going to do with yourself, anyway?\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"Honest, now?\" He lifted her chin and looked into her eyes.    Thea laughed and edged away from him.    \"You've got something up your sleeve, haven't you? Anything you like;  only don't marry and settle down here without giving yourself a chance,  will you?\"    \"Not much. See, there's another rabbit!\"    \"That's all right about the rabbits, but I don't want you to get tied  up. Remember that.\"    Thea nodded. \"Be nice to Wunsch, then. I don't know what I'd do if he  went away.\"    \"You've got older friends than Wunsch here, Thea.\"    \"I know.\" Thea spoke seriously and looked up at the moon, propping her  chin on her hand. \"But Wunsch is the only one that can teach me what I  want to know. I've got to learn to do something well, and that's the  thing I can do best.\"    \"Do you want to be a music-teacher?\"    \"Maybe, but I want to be a good one. I'd like to go to Germany to study,  some day. Wunsch says that's the best place,--the only place you can  really learn.\" Thea hesitated and then went on nervously, \"I've got a  book that says so, too. It's called 'My Musical Memories.' It made me  want to go to Germany even before Wunsch said anything. Of course it's a  secret. You're the first one I've told.\"    Dr. Archie smiled indulgently. \"That's a long way off. Is that what  you've got in your hard noddle?\" He put his hand on her hair, but this  time she shook him off.    \"No, I don't think much about it. But you talk about going, and a body  has to have something to go TO!\"    \"That's so.\" Dr. Archie sighed. \"You're lucky if you have. Poor Wunsch,  now, he hasn't. What do such fellows come out here for? He's been asking  me about my mining stock, and about mining towns. What would he do in a  mining town? He wouldn't know a piece of ore if he saw one. He's got  nothing to sell that a mining town wants to buy. Why don't those old  fellows stay at home? We won't need them for another hundred years. An  engine wiper can get a job, but a piano player! Such people can't make  good.\"    \"My grandfather Alstrom was a musician, and he made good.\"    Dr. Archie chuckled. \"Oh, a Swede can make good anywhere, at anything!  You've got that in your favor, miss. Come, you must be getting home.\"    Thea rose. \"Yes, I used to be ashamed of being a Swede, but I'm not any  more. Swedes are kind of common, but I think it's better to be  SOMETHING.\"    \"It surely is! How tall you are getting. You come above my shoulder  now.\"    \"I'll keep on growing, don't you think? I particularly want to be tall.  Yes, I guess I must go home. I wish there'd be a fire.\"    \"A fire?\"    \"Yes, so the fire-bell would ring and the roundhouse whistle would blow,  and everybody would come running out. Sometime I'm going to ring the  fire-bell myself and stir them all up.\"    \"You'd be arrested.\"    \"Well, that would be better than going to bed.\"    \"I'll have to lend you some more books.\"    Thea shook herself impatiently. \"I can't read every night.\"    Dr. Archie gave one of his low, sympathetic chuckles as he opened the  gate for her. \"You're beginning to grow up, that's what's the matter  with you. I'll have to keep an eye on you. Now you'll have to say  good-night to the moon.\"    \"No, I won't. I sleep on the floor now, right in the moonlight. My  window comes down to the floor, and I can look at the sky all night.\"    She shot round the house to the kitchen door, and Dr. Archie watched her  disappear with a sigh. He thought of the hard, mean, frizzy little woman  who kept his house for him; once the belle of a Michigan town, now dry  and withered up at thirty. \"If I had a daughter like Thea to watch,\" he  reflected, \"I wouldn't mind anything. I wonder if all of my life's going  to be a mistake just because I made a big one then? Hardly seems fair.\"    Howard Archie was \"respected\" rather than popular in Moonstone. Everyone"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44114"],[0,"A Jay of Italy (#15)"],[1,"such a rich possession and life so  cheap?  Here is one would prolong the body's pleasure to eternity, yet  at any moment will risk its destruction for a spite.  Nathless she is  warm, loamy soil for the bearing of our right lily of love, and some day  shall be fruitful in cleanliness.    'Now the Fool--poor Fool!  I have won to temperance, and so Carlo  growleth, \"A murrain on thee, spoil-sport! What want I with a sober  Fool?  Take him, thou, to be valet to thy temperance!\" by which gibe he  seeks to cover a gracious act.  And, lo!  I have a Fool for servant, a  most notable Fool and auxiliary, who, having sworn himself to  abstinence, would unplug and sink to the bottomless abyss every floating  hogshead.  In sooth the good soul is my shadow, and so they call him.  \"Well,\" says he, \"so be it.  But what sort of fool art thou, to cast a  fool for shadow?\"  \"Why, look,\" says I, for it was sunset on the  grass--\"at least not so great a fool as thou.\"  \"That may well be,\" says  he, \"for you do not serve Messer Bembo.\"  So caustic is he--a biting  love; yet, as is proper between a man and his shadow, equal attached to  me as I to him.  And so, talking of his gift to me, brings me to the  greater gifts of the Duke.    'O my father!  How can I speak my gratitude to heaven and thy teaching,  which brought me so swiftly, so wonderfully, to prevail with that dread  man!  I think evil is like the false opal, which needs but the first  touch of pure light to shatter it.  I have come with no weapon but my  little lamp of sunshine; and behold! in its flash the base is  discredited and the truth acknowledged.  It is all so easy, Christ guard  me!  There is a Providence in what men call chance.  Only, my father,  pray that thy child be not misled by flattery to usurp its prerogatives.  Men, in this dim world, are all too prone to worship the visible symbols  of Immortality--to accept the prophet for the Master.  I am already  feted and caressed as if I were a god.  The Duke hath impropriated to me  an income of a thousand ducatos, with free residence in the castello,  and a retinue to befit a prince.  At all this I cavil not, sith it  affords me the sinews to a crusade.  But what shall I say to his  delegating me to the chief magistracy of Milan during his forthcoming  absence? for he is on the eve of an expedition into Piedmont, touching  the lordship of Vercelli, which he claims through his wife Bona of  Savoy.  Carlo, it is true, warns me against this perilous exaltation.  \"Seek'st thou,\" says he, \"to depose the devil?  Well, the devil, on his  return, will treat thee like any other palace revolutionist.\"  \"Nay,\"  says I, \"the devil was never the devil from choice.  Restore him to a  converted dukedom, and he will aspire to be the saint of all.\"  \"Yes,\"  he said, \"I can imagine Galeazzo endowing a hospital for Magdalenes and  washing the poor's feet.  But I will stick to thee.\"  A dear worldling  he is, and only less uncertain than his master in these first infant  steps towards godliness.  For vice is very childlike in its  self-plumings upon a little knowledge.  Desiring beauty, it tears the  rose-bush or clutches the moth, and so sickens on disillusionment.  Forbearance is the wisdom of the great.    'The more destructive is a man, the simpler is he. Now, my father, this  destroying Duke covets nothing so much as the applause of the world for  gifts with which, in truth, he is ill-endowed.  He cannot sing, or  rhyme, or improvise but with the worst, yet, thinks he, they shall call  me poet and musician, or burn.  Well, he might fiddle over the  holocaust, like Nero, and still be first cousin to a peacock.  I told  him so, but in gentler words, when he asked me to teach him my method.  \"To every soul its capacities,\" says I, \"and mine are not in ruling a  great duchy greatly.\"  \"So we are neither of us omnipotent,\" says he,  with a smile. \"Well, I will take the lesson to heart.\"  Now, could so  simple a creature be all corrupt?    'Of more complicated fibre is his brother, the Signior Ludovico.  Very  politic and abiding, he rushes at nothing; yet in the end, I think, most  things come to him.  He is gracious to thy child, as indeed are all;  yet, God forgive me, I find something more inhuman in his gentleness  than in Galeazzo's passion.  These inexplicable antipathies are surely  the weapons of Satan; whereby it behoves us to overcome them.  That same  Lascaris attributes them to an accidental re-fusion of particles,  opposed to other chance re-combinations, in a present body, of particles  similarly antipathetic to us in a former existence--a long \"short cut\"  over the way again.    'Now, as for my days in this poignant city--where even the benches and  clothes-chests, not to speak of most walls and ceilings, yea, and the  very stair-posts themselves, are painted with crowded devices of scrolls  and figures in loveliest gold and azure and vermilion--thou mayest  believe they are strange to me.  Amidst this wealth I, thy simple  acolyte, am glorified, I say, and courted beyond measure.  Yet fear  nothing for me.  I appraise this distinction at its right market value.  The higher the Duke's favour, the greater my presumptive influence.  Believe me, dear, my urbanity towards his attentions is an investment  for my Master. I am an honest factor.    'In a week the Duke sets out.  In the meantime, like an ambassador that  must suffer present festival for the sake of future credit, I sit at  feasts and plays; or, perchance, rise to denounce the latter for no  better than whores' saturnalia.  (O my father! to see fair ladies, the  Duchess herself, smile on such shameless bawdry!)  Whereon the Duke  thunders all to stop, with threats of fury on the actors to mend their  ways, making the poor fools gasp bewildered.  For how had _they_  presumed upon custom?  Bad habit is like the moth in fur, so easily  shaken out when first detected; so hardly when established.  Once, more  to my liking, we have a mummers' dance, with clowns in rams' heads  butting; and again a harvest ballet, with all the seasons pictured very  pretty.  Another day comes a Mantuan who plays on three lutes at once,  more curious than tuneful; and after him one who walks on a rope in the  court, a steel cuirass about his body.  Now happens their festival of  the _Bacchidae_, a pagan survival, but certes sweet and graceful, with  its songs and vines and dances.  Maybe for my sake they purge it of some  licence.  Well, Heaven witness to them what loss or gain thereby to  beauty.    'Often the court goes hunting the wolf or deer--I care not; or  a-picnicking by the river, which I like, and where we catch trouts and  lampreys to cook and eat on the green; then run we races, perchance, or  play at ball.  So merry and light-hearted--how can wickedness be other  than an accident with these children of good-nature?  To mark the jokes  they play on one another--mischievous sometimes--suggests to one a  romping nursery, which yet I know not.  Father, who was my mother?  I  trow we romped somewhere in heaven. Once some gallants of them, being in  collusion with the watch, enter, in the guise of robbers, Messer  Secretary Simonetta's house at midnight, and bind and blindfold that  great man, and placing him on an ass in his night-gear (which is an  excuse for nothing), carry him through the streets as if to their  quarters.  Which, having gained, they unbind; and lo! he is in the inner  ward of the castello, the Duke and a great company about him and shouts  of laughter; in which I could not help but join, though it was shameful.  Next day the Duchess herself does not disdain a wrestling match with the  lady Catherine, her adoptive daughter; when the lithe little serpent,  enwreathing that stately Queen, doth pull her sitting on her lap,  whereby she conquers.  For all improvising and stories they have as  great a passion as ingenuity; and therein, my gifts by Christ's ensample  lying, comes my opportunity.  Dear Father, am I presumptuous in my  feeble might, like the boy Phaeton when he coaxed the Sun's reins from  Ph[oe]bus, and scorched the wry road since called the Milky Way? That is  such an old tale as we tell by moonlight under trees--such as Christ  Himself, the child-God, hath recounted to us, sitting shoulder-deep in  meadow-grass, or by the pretty falling streams.  Is He that exacting,  that exotic Deity, lusting only for adoration, eternally gluttonous of  praise and never surfeited, whom squeamish indoor men, making Him the  fetish of their closets, have reared for heaven's type?  O, find Him in  the blown trees and running water; in the carol of sweet birds; in the  mines from whose entrails are drawn our ploughshares; yea, in the  pursuit of maid by man!  So, in these long walks and rests of life,  shall He be no less our Prince because He is our joyous comrade.  For  this I know: Not to a pastor, a lord, a parent himself, doth the soul of  the youth go out as to the companion of his own age and freedom.    'Christ comes again as He journeyed with His Apostles, the bright wise  comrade, fitting earth to heaven in the puzzle of the spheres.  We know  Him Human, my father, feeling the joy of weariness for repose' sake; not  disdaining the cool inn's sanctuary; expounding love by forbearance.  He  beareth Beauty redeemed on His brow.  Before the clear gaze of His eyes  all heaped sophistries melt away like April snow. He calleth us to the  woods and meadows.  _Quasimodo geniti infantes rationabile sine dolo lac  concupiscete_.  O, mine eyelids droop!  We are seldom at rest here  before two o' the morning.  The beds have trellised gratings by day, to  keep the dogs from smirching their coverlets. _Ora pro me_!'                                       *CHAPTER VIII*      The castle at the Porta Giovia had its glooms as well as its pleasances.  Indeed, it may be questioned if the latter were not rather in proportion  to the former as a tiger's gay hide is "]]]
