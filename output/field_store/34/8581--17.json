He pointed out to us his best wheat, which looks tolerable, and  may perhaps yield 13 or 14 bushels per acre**. Next came the oats which are  in ear, though not more than six inches high: they will not return as much  seed as was sown. The barley, except one patch in a corner of a field,  little better than the oats. Crossed the river and inspected the south  side. Found the little patch of wheat at the bottom of the crescent very  bad. Proceeded and examined the large field on the ascent to the westward:  here are about twenty-five acres of wheat, which from its appearance we  guessed would produce perhaps seven bushels an acre. The next patch to this  is in maize, which looks not unpromising; some of the stems are stout, and  beginning to throw out large broad leaves, the surest sign of vigour. The  view from the top of the wheat field takes in, except a narrow slip, the  whole of the cleared land at Rose Hill. From not having before seen an  opening of such extent for the last three years, this struck us as grand  and capacious. The beautiful diversity of the ground (gentle hill and dale)  would certainly be reckoned pretty in any country. Continued our walk, and  crossed the old field, which is intended to form part of the main street of  the projected town. The wheat in this field is rather better, but not much,  than in the large field before mentioned. The next field is maize, inferior  to what we have seen, but not despicable. An acre of maize, at the bottom  of the marine garden, is equal in luxuriancy of promise to any I ever saw  in any country.    [*The best crop of barley ever produced in New South Wales, was sown by a  private individual, in February 1790, and reaped in the following October.]    [**As all the trees on our cleared ground were cut down, and not grubbed  up, the roots and stumps remain, on which account a tenth part of surface  in every acre must be deducted. This is slovenly husbandry; but in a  country where immediate subsistence is wanted, it is perhaps necessary.  None of these stumps, when I left Port Jackson, showed any symptoms of  decay, though some of the trees had been cut down four years. To the  different qualities of the wood of Norfolk Island and New South Wales,  perhaps the difference of soil may in some measure be traced. That of  Norfolk Island is light and porous: it rots and turns into mould in two  years. Besides its hardness that of Port Jackson abounds with red corrosive  gum, which contributes its share of mischief.]      The main street of the new town is already begun. It is to be a mile long,  and of such breadth as will make Pall Mall and Portland Place \"hide their  diminished heads.\" It contains at present thirty-two houses completed, of  twenty-four feet by twelve each, on a ground floor only, built of wattles  plastered with clay, and thatched. Each house is divided into two rooms, in  one of which is a fire place and a brick chimney. These houses are designed  for men only; and ten is the number of inhabitants allotted to each;  but some of them now contain twelve or fourteen, for want of better  accommodation. More are building. In a cross street stand nine houses for  unmarried women; and exclusive of all these are several small huts where  convict families of good character are allowed to reside. Of public  buildings, besides the old wooden barrack and store, there is a house of  lath and plaster, forty-four feet long by sixteen wide, for the governor,  on a ground floor only, with excellent out-houses and appurtenances  attached to it. A new brick store house, covered with tiles, 100 feet long  by twenty-four wide, is nearly completed, and a house for the store-keeper.  The first stone of a barrack, 100 feet long by twenty-four wide, to which  are intended to be added wings for the officers, was laid to-day. The  situation of the barrack is judicious, being close to the store-house, and  within a hundred and fifty yards of the wharf, where all boats from Sydney  unload. To what I have already enumerated, must be added an excellent barn,  a granary, an inclosed yard to rear stock in, a commodious blacksmith's  shop, and a most wretched hospital, totally destitute of every conveniency.  Luckily for the gentleman who superintends this hospital, and still more  luckily for those who are doomed in case of sickness to enter it, the air  of Rose Hill has hitherto been generally healthy. A tendency to produce  slight inflammatory disorders, from the rapid changes* of the temperature  of the air, is most to be dreaded.    [*In the close of the year 1788, when this settlement was established, the  thermometer has been known to stand at 50 degrees a little before sunrise,  and between one and two o' clock in the afternoon at above 100 degrees.]      'The hours of labour for the convicts are the same here as at Sydney. On  Saturdays after ten o'clock in the morning they are allowed to work in  their own gardens. These gardens are at present, from the long drought and  other causes, in a most deplorable state. Potatoes, I think, thrive better  than any other vegetable in them. For the public conveniency a baker is  established here in a good bakehouse, who exchanges with every person bread  for flour, on stipulated terms; but no compulsion exists for any one to  take his bread; it is left entirely to every body's own option to consume  his flour as he pleases. Divine service is performed here, morning and  afternoon, one Sunday in every month, when all the convicts are obliged  to attend church, under penalty of having a part of their allowance of  provisions stopped, which is done by the chaplain, who is a justice of the  peace.    'For the punishment of offenders, where a criminal court is not judged  necessary, two or more justices, occasionally assemble, and order the  infliction of slight corporal punishment, or short confinement in a strong  room built for this purpose. The military present here consists of two  subalterns, two sergeants, three corporals, a drummer, and twenty-one  privates. These have been occasionally augmented and reduced, as  circumstances have been thought to render it necessary.    Brick-kilns are now erected here, and bricks manufactured by a convict  of the name of Becket, who came out in the last fleet, and has fifty-two  people to work under him. He makes 25,000 bricks weekly. He says that they  are very good, and would sell at Birmingham, where he worked about eighteen  months ago, at more than 30 shillings per thousand.    Nothing farther of public nature remaining to examine, I next visited a  humble adventurer, who is trying his fortune here. James Ruse, convict, was  cast for seven years at Bodmin assizes, in August 1782. He lay five years  in prison and on board the 'Dunkirk' hulk at Plymouth, and then was sent  to this country. When his term of punishment expired, in August 1789, he  claimed his freedom, and was permitted by the governor, on promising to  settle in the country, to take in December following, an uncleaned piece of  ground, with an assurance that if he would cultivate it, it should not be  taken from him. Some assistance was given him, to fell the timber, and he  accordingly began. His present account to me was as follows.      I was bred a husbandman, near Launcester in Cornwall. I cleared my land as  well as I could, with the help afforded me. The exact limit of what ground  I am to have, I do not yet know; but a certain direction has been pointed  out to me, in which I may proceed as fast as I can cultivate. I have now  an acre and a half in bearded wheat, half an acre in maize, and a small  kitchen garden. On my wheat land I sowed three bushels of seed, the produce  of this country, broad cast. I expect to reap about twelve or thirteen  bushels. I know nothing of the cultivation of maize, and cannot therefore  guess so well at what I am likely to gather. I sowed part of my wheat  in May, and part in June. That sown in May has thrived best. My maize I  planted in the latter end of August, and the beginning of September. My  land I prepared thus: having burnt the fallen timber off the ground, I dug  in the ashes, and then hoed it up, never doing more than eight, or perhaps  nine, rods in a day, by which means, it was not like the government farm,  just scratched over, but properly done. Then I clod-moulded it, and dug in  the grass and weeds. This I think almost equal to ploughing. I then let it  lie as long as I could, exposed to air and sun; and just before I sowed my  seed, turned it all up afresh. When I shall have reaped my crop, I purpose  to hoe it again, and harrow it fine, and then sow it with turnip-seed,  which will mellow and prepare it for next year. My straw, I mean to bury in  pits, and throw in with it every thing which I think will rot and turn  to manure. I have no person to help me, at present, but my wife, whom I  married in this country; she is industrious. The governor, for some time,  gave me the help of a convict man, but he is taken away. Both my wife  and myself receive our provisions regularly at the store, like all other  people. My opinion of the soil of my farm, is, that it is middling, neither  good or bad. I will be bound to make it do with the aid of manure, but  without cattle it will fail. The greatest check upon me is, the dishonesty  of the convicts who, in spite of all my vigilance, rob me almost every  night.      The annexed return will show the number of persons of all descriptions  at Rose Hill, at this period. On the morning of the 17th, I went down to  Sydney.    Here terminates the transcription of my diary. It were vain to suppose,  that it can prove either agreeable or interesting to a majority of readers  but as this work is intended not only for amusement, but information, I  considered it right to present this detail unaltered, either in its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35345"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 5, No. 4, April, 1852 (#15)"],[1,"and perennial as       this, the preliminary investigations could have been only a       delight to him. Other men might be forced to them as a       revolting duty; he chose the inquiry, with very dubious       hopes of bettering himself by prosecuting it, because his       heart was full of compassion, and he thought he might do       good. We repeat, what we can state from personal knowledge,       that the bent of Mr. Warburton's mind was latterly towards       works of general utility; and it is with great satisfaction       we learn, what we had not been aware of until the public       papers announced it, that his projected visit to the New       World was a mission, in which the interests of humanity were       to have in him an advocate and champion.         \"Into his private life we feel that, under present       circumstances, it would be indelicate, as well as out of       place, to enter. Surrounded as he was with all the blessings       which the domestic relations can bestow, beloved by his       intimates, caressed by the gifted and the good, Eliot       Warburton lived the centre of a radiating circle of       happiness. His personal qualities were of no common order.       His society was eagerly sought after. With a fastidious       lassitude of air, and an apparent disinclination to       exertion, he possessed remarkable force of thought and       fluency of diction; and it was no uncommon thing to see him,       when he had begun to relate passages from his experience in       foreign countries, or adventures in his own, the centre of a       gradually increasing audience, amidst which he sat,       improvisating a sort of romantic recitation, until he was       completely carried away on the current of his own eloquence,       and lost every sense of where he was or what he was doing,       in the enthusiasm he had fanned up and saw reflected around       him. This power was a peculiar gift; and he loved to       exercise it. In this form many of his happiest effusions       have been given utterance to; and every body who has heard       him at such inspired moments has felt regret that the       brilliant bursts which so delighted him, should have been       stamped upon no more retentive tablets than the ears of       ordinary listeners.         \"Of this amiable, refined and gifted individual, we are       afraid to speak as warmly as our heart would dictate. Before       us lie the few hasty lines--but not too hurried to be the       channel of a parting kindness--scrawled to us on the first       day of this year--the last day the writer was ever to pass       in England. They are, perhaps, amongst the latest words he       ever wrote. 'I am off,' they run 'for the West Indies       to-morrow. _But I have accomplished your affair._' Oh,       vanity of human purpose! Man proposes--God disposes. We were       next to hear of him, standing on the deck of the burning       vessel in the Atlantic, alone with the captain, after every       other soul had disappeared, surveying--we feel convinced,       with a courage of a lion--the awful twofold death close       before him, and which he had in probability deliberately       preferred to an early relinquishment of his companions to       their fate. It is a fine picture--one that shall every hang       framed with his image in our memory; helping us to believe       that        \"'-----Lycidas our sorrow is not dead.      Sunk though he be beneath the watery flood,'--         But that he hath mounted to a higher sphere--        \"'Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves.'\"          AUTHOR OF \"THE FOOL OF QUALITY.\"      Of the interesting papers in the February Dublin University Magazine, we  have read none with more satisfaction than the biographical sketch and  portrait of one of the most distinguished Irishmen of his own or any  age, the gifted and pure minded author of _Gustavus Vasa_ and _The Fool  of Quality_, HENRY BROOKE. Of his literary fate it might be said that  the most unfortunate thing he did was to assert the patriotism of Dean  Swift; and the most unfortunate thing was to be left out of Doctor  Johnson's \"Lives of the Poets.\" Trials had he to undergo, although not  absolutely driven to the wall, like many children of \"the fatal dowry,\"  and those of Irish complexion, in particular; but he bravely bore up  against them. Those who deem that relatives may live more happily apart,  and that friendship is best preserved in full dress, may look at the  picture of Henry Brooke, the poet and politician, and Robert Brooke, the  painter, with their wives and children, not less than twenty, living  together in perfect peace and amity at Daisy Park, in the flattest part  of Kildare, where, in those dull seats and distant times, a family  breeze might now and then have been looked on in the Irish sense as a  \"convenience and a comfort.\" \"While Henry wrote,\" says the biographer,  \"Robert painted, and sold his pictures; and thus these two loving  brothers, having lost their property, made a right and manful use of  their intellectual gifts, and supported their large families by the  sweat of their brows.\"         \"In his politics, Brooke was of the old whig school; and,       had he lived in 1829, he would probably have been an       emancipator. He was a right-minded, ardent Irishman in his       love for fatherland; hated oppression; idolized liberty;       wrote most keenly against Poyning's infamous laws; mourned       over the misrule and misgovernment of his country, under the       tyranny and rapacity of the Stuart dynasty; admired King       William, and was an exulting Protestant; yet greatly loved       his Roman Catholic neighbors, and would preserve to them       their properties, though he disliked their principles, and       deprecated their ascendency.\"    Dr. Johnson's feelings respecting Brooke are accounted for, not  improbably, as follows:         \"It may be asked why did Dr. Johnson exclude Brooke from his       'Lives of the Poets,' where so many names of little note are       to be found? In 1739, Johnson had written in Brooke's praise       in his 'Complete Vindication,' and twenty years afterwards,       when the learned Dr. Campbell showed a spirited 'Prospectus       of a History of Ireland' written by him, to the great       moralist, he read it with much pleasure and praise, saying       that 'every line breathed the true fire of genius.' It is       recorded that, on this occasion, Johnson lamented that 'the       vanity of Irishmen, even if their patriotism were extinct,       did not enable Brooke to carry his design into execution.'       In Johnson's letter to Charles O'Connor we have his mind on       the subject. To Brooke he appears never to have written;       there had been an ancient quarrel between them. They had       argued and disagreed; and the traditionary story in Brooke's       family bears _so_ heavily on the manner of the philosopher,       and is _so_ flattering to the courtesy of the poet, that we       should prefer not to write it down. Brooke was at all times       strangely careless of fame; independent to a fault, and more       proud than vain; and though much urged by his friends to       humble himself, yet he could not be induced to 'bow down' to       the cap of this literary Gesler, much as he regarded his       learning and noble intellect. This dislike of the Doctor       continued during his life; and Boswell narrates that on the       occasion of a play being read to him (it was Brooke's       _Gustavus Vasa_) and a circle of friends, on coming to the       line--        \"Who rules o'er free men should himself be free!'         the company applauded, but Johnson said it might as well be       said--        \"'Who drives fat oxen should himself be fat--'         a stupid and inapt verbal sophism, and unworthy of his great       and good mind; but such was often his way. In this fashion       one might string endless parodies on the line, and equally       inapplicable; for example:--        \"'Who keeps a madhouse should himself be mad!'         \"Mr. Brooke's elegant and honest mind probably had in view       that word of Scripture which saith, 'he that ruleth his own       spirit is better than he who taketh a city'--(Prov. xvi.       32.)    \"By this unhappy difference Brooke lost his Johnsonian niche in the  temple of biographical fame. Yet we must remember that a better fate was  his,--'his record is on high,'--and his spirit with that Saviour who  loved him and made him what he was. Faults and inconsistency were in  him, no doubt, but still we know not of any of whom it could be so well  and suitably said--        \"'His life was gentle, and the elements      So mixed him, that Nature might stand up      And say to all the world, 'This was a man.'\"          BANCROFT'S AMERICAN REVOLUTION.[5]    From the Westminster Review.      Among the historians who have attained a high and deserved reputation in  the United States, within the last few years, we are inclined to yield  the first place to George Bancroft. His great work on the history of the  United States has been brought down from the commencement of American  colonization to the opening of the Revolutionary War, to which subject  it is understood that he intends devoting the three succeeding volumes.  His researches in the public offices of England, while he was Minister  of the United States at the Court of St. James, have brought to light a  great mass of documentary evidence on the antecedents and course of the  Revolution, which have not yet been made public. With his critical  sagacity in sifting evidence, his hound-like instinct in scenting every  particle of testimony that can lead him on the right-track, and his  plastic skill in moulding the most confused and discordant materials  into a compact, symmetrical, and truthful narrative, he cannot fail to  present the story of that great"]]]
