I pleaded guilty to all the charges  except the last, and explained the case as clearly as I could. The  Conservancy solicitor, who prosecuted, did then what he had never done  before. It was a bad case he said, but added that I had never before  been charged with netting during \"close-time,\" and had never used lime  or other wholesale methods of poisoning. He pointed out, too, to the  presiding Justice that I always claimed to \"poach square\"--at which all  the young ones laughed. He did not press for the heaviest penalty. But  this was quite unnecessary, as I got it without. I never quite  understood how they made it up, but I was fined ninety-seven pounds. I  told the Chairman that I should pay it \"in kind,\" and went to \"hard\" for  nine months.          WORKS BY JOHN WATSON.        NATURE AND WOODCRAFT.    Crown 8vo, 5/.    With Illustrations by G.

The old man and his wife and  their son Jesse were surrendered to Col. Johnson. Benjamin Peart, Mrs.  Gilbert's son, was carried off to the Genesee. The other members of the  party were held in captivity in various places; but I may only stay now  to note what befel the little Rebecca and her sister-in-law, Elizabeth  Peart.    As already stated, Rebecca had been adopted by Rowland Montour's wife.  In the general allotment of prisoners, her cousin, Benjamin Gilbert, the  lad of eleven, also fell to this daughter of Sayenqueraghta. She took  the children to a cabin where her father's family, eleven in number,  were assembled. After the usual grand lamentation for the dead, whose  places were supposed now to be filled by the white prisoners, this royal  household departed by easy stages for their summer's corn-planting. They  tarried at the Landing, while clothing was had from the fort. The little  Quaker girl was dressed after the Indian fashion, \"with short-clothes,  leggins and a gold-laced hat\"; while Benjamin, \"as a badge of his  dignity, wore a silver medal hanging from his neck.\" They moved up to  Fort Schlosser (just above the falls, near where the present power-house  stands), thence by canoe to Fort Erie; then \"four miles further, up  Buffalo Creek, where they pitched their tent for a settlement.\" Here the  women planted corn; but the little Rebecca, not being strong, was  allowed to look after the cooking. The whole household, queen, princess  and slave, had to work. The men of course were exempt; but the chief  advantage of Sayenqueraghta's high rank was that he could procure more  provisions from the King's stores at Fort Niagara than could the humbler  members of the tribe. The boy Ben had an easy time of it. He roamed at  will with the Indian boys over the territory that is now Buffalo;  fished in the lake, hunted or idled without constraint, and it is  recorded that he was so pleased with the Indian mode of life, that but  for his sister's constant admonition he would have dropped all thought  of return to civilization, and cheerfully have become as good an Indian  as the best of them. At eleven years of age savagery takes easy hold.    These children lived with Montour's Indian relatives for over two years;  sharing in the feasts when there was plenty, going pinched with hunger  on the frequent occasions when improvidence had exhausted the supply.  There were numerous expeditions, afoot and by canoe, to Fort Niagara. On  one occasion Rebecca, with her Indian family, were entertained by  British officers at Fort Erie, when Old Smoke drank so much wine that  when he came to paddle his canoe homeward, across the river, he narrowly  escaped an upset on the rocky reef, just outside the entrance to Buffalo  Creek. On every visit to Fort Niagara Rebecca would look for release;  but although the officers were kind to her, they did not choose to  interfere with so powerful a family as Montour's. It was shortly after  one of these disappointments that she heard of her father's death. For  some months she was sick; then came news of the death of her Indian  father, Rowland Montour, who succumbed to wounds received in the attack  already noted. There was great mourning in the lodge on Buffalo Creek,  and Rebecca had to make a feint of sorrow, weeping aloud with the rest.    In the winter of '81-'82 a scheme was devised by friends at the fort  for abducting her from the Indians, but it was not undertaken. In the  spring of '82 peremptory orders came from Gen. Haldimand that all the  remaining members of the Gilbert family who were still in captivity  should be taken from the Indians; but after a council fire had been  lighted, Old Smoke, Montour's widow, and the rest of the family, Rebecca  and Ben included, moved six miles up the lake shore--apparently to  Smoke's Creek--where they stayed several weeks making maple sugar. Then,  a great pigeon roost being reported, men and boys went off to it, some  fifty miles, and the delighted young Ben went too. Of all the Gilbert  captives he alone seems to have had experiences too full of wholesome  adventure and easy living to warrant the expenditure of the least bit of  sympathy upon him. But sooner or later the wily Indians had to heed Sir  Frederick's command, and on the 1st of June, 1782, after upwards of two  years of captivity, Rebecca and her cousin were released at Fort  Niagara, and two days later, with others, embarked for Montreal.    Far more cheerless were the experiences of Elizabeth Peart. She was  parted from her husband, adopted by a Seneca family, and was also  brought to raise corn on Buffalo Creek. Early in her servitude among the  Indians her babe was taken from her and carried across to Canada. She  was but twenty years old herself; the family that had taken her came by  canoe to Buffalo Creek, where they settled for the corn-planting. This  was in the spring of 1780. All manner of drudgery and burdens were put  upon her. Her work was to cultivate the corn. Falling sick, the Indians  built a hut for her by the side of the cornfield, and then utterly  neglected her. Here she remained through the summer, regaining strength  enough to care for and gather the corn; when this was done, her Indian  father permitted her to come and live again in the family lodge. At one  time a drunken Indian attacked her, knocked her down, and dragged her  about, beating her. At another, all provision failing, she tramped with  others four days through the snow to Fort Niagara. Here Capt. Powell's  wife--who had been a prisoner herself--interceded in Elizabeth's behalf,  but to no avail. She was however given an opportunity to see her babe,  which was being cared for by an Indian family on the Canadian side of  the river, opposite Fort Niagara. This privilege was gained for the poor  mother by bribing her Indian father with a bottle of rum. So far as I am  aware, this was the best use to which a bottle of rum was put during the  Revolutionary War. But back to Buffalo Creek the unhappy mother had to  come. Her release was finally obtained by artifice. Being allowed to  visit Fort Niagara, where she had some needlework to do for the white  people, she feigned sickness, and by one excuse and another the Indians  were put off until she could be shipped away to Montreal.    Of the Gilbert family and those taken with them by Montour, only the old  man died in captivity. The adventures of each one would make a long  story, but may not be entered upon here. By the close of '82 they were  all released from the Indians, and after a detention at Montreal,  reached their friends in Pennsylvania and set about the reestablishment  of homes.    Beyond question, Elizabeth Peart and Rebecca Gilbert were the first  white women ever on the site of the present city of Buffalo. They were  brave, patient, patriotic girls; no truer Daughters of the American  Revolution are known to history. It would seem fitting that their memory  should be preserved and their story known--much fuller than I have here  sketched it--by the patriotic Daughters of the Revolution of our own  day, who give heed to American beginnings in this region.    I have dwelt at length on the Gilbert captivity, not more because of its  own importance than to illustrate the responsibilities which constantly  rested on the commandant at Niagara, at this period. We now turn to  other phases of the service which engaged the attention and taxed the  endurance of Col. Bolton.    From the time of the conquest of Canada in 1760 down to the opening of  the Revolution, there had been a slow but steady growth of shipping on  the lakes, especially on Lake Ontario. On this lake, as early as 1767,  there were four brigs of from forty to seventy tons, and sixteen armed  deck-cutters. Besides the \"King's ships\" there were still much travel  and traffic by means of canoes and batteaux. One of the first effects of  the war with the American colonies was to beget active ship-building  operations by the British; for Lake Ontario, at Oswegatchie, Oswego and  Niagara; and for Lake Erie, at Navy Island, Detroit and Pine River. An  official return made in July, 1778, the summer after Col. Bolton assumed  command at Niagara, enumerates twelve sailing craft built for Lake  Ontario since the British gained control of that lake in 1759, and  sixteen for Lake Erie; seven of the Lake Ontario boats had been cast  away, two were laid up and decayed; so that at this time--midsummer of  '78--there were still in service only the snow Haldimand, eighteen guns,  built at Oswegatchie in 1771; the snow Seneca, eighteen guns, built in  1777; and the sloop Caldwell, two guns, built in 1774. A memorandum  records that Capt. Andrews, in the spring of 1778, sought permission to  build another vessel at Niagara, to take the place of the Haldimand,  which, he was informed, could not last more than another year. The  vessel built, in accordance with this recommendation, was a schooner;  her construction was entrusted to Capt. Shank, at Niagara, across the  river from the fort. We may be sure that Col. Bolton visited the yard  from time to time to note the progress of the work. There was discussion  over her lines. \"Capt. Shank was told that he was making her too  flat-bottomed, and that she would upset.\" The builder laughed at his  critics and stuck to his model. She was launched, named the Ontario, and  was hastened forward to completion, for the King's service had urgent  need of her.    Col. Bolton had long been in bad health, wearied with the cares and  perplexities of his position and eager to get away from Fort Niagara.  One source of constant annoyance to his military mind was the traders'  supplies, which turned the fort into a warehouse and laid "]]]
