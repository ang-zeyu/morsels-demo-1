Symbolism intense as this, is the creation of a special  temper, in which a certain simplicity, taking all things literally,  au pied de la lettre, is united to a vivid pre-occupation with the  aesthetic beauty of the image itself, the figured side of figurative  expression, the form of the metaphor.  When it is said, \"Out of his  mouth goeth a sharp sword,\" that temper is ready to deal directly and  boldly with that difficult image, like that old designer of the  fourteenth century, who has depicted this, and other images of the  Apocalypse, in a coloured window at Bourges.  Such symbolism cares a  great deal for the hair of Temperance, discreetly bound, for some  subtler likeness to the colour of the sky in the girdle of Hope, for  the inwoven flames in the red garment of Charity.  And what was  specially peculiar to the temper of the old Florentine painter,  Giotto, to the temper of his age in general, doubtless, more than to  that of ours, was the persistent and universal mood of the age in  which the story of Demeter and Persephone was first created.  If some  painter of our own time has conceived the image of The Day so  intensely, that we hardly think of distinguishing between the image,  with its girdle of dissolving morning mist, and the meaning of the  image; if William Blake, to our so great delight, makes the morning  stars [100] literally \"sing together,\"--these fruits of individual  genius are in part also a \"survival\" from a different age, with the  whole mood of which this mode of expression was more congruous than  it is with ours.  But there are traces of the old temper in the man  of to-day also; and through these we can understand that earlier  time--a very poetical time, with the more highly gifted peoples--in  which every impression men received of the action of powers without  or within them suggested to them the presence of a soul or will, like  their own--a person, with a living spirit, and senses, and hands, and  feet; which, when it talked of the return of Kore to Demeter, or the  marriage of Zeus and Here, was not using rhetorical language, but  yielding to a real illusion; to which the voice of man \"was really a  stream, beauty an effluence, death a mist.\"    The gods of Greek mythology overlap each other; they are confused or  connected with each other, lightly or deeply, as the case may be, and  sometimes have their doubles, at first sight as in a troubled dream,  yet never, when we examine each detail more closely, without a  certain truth to human reason.  It is only in a limited sense that it  is possible to lift, and examine by itself, one thread of the network  of story and imagery, which, in a certain age of civilisation, wove  itself over every detail of life and thought, over every name in the  past, and almost every place in [101] Greece.  The story of Demeter,  then, was the work of no single author or place or time; the poet of  its first phase was no single person, but the whole consciousness of  an age, though an age doubtless with its differences of more or less  imaginative individual minds--with one, here or there, eminent,  though but by a little, above a merely receptive majority, the  spokesman of a universal, though faintly-felt prepossession,  attaching the errant fancies of the people around him to definite  names and images.  The myth grew up gradually, and at many distant  places, in many minds, independent of each other, but dealing in a  common temper with certain elements and aspects of the natural world,  as one here, and another there, seemed to catch in that incident or  detail which flashed more incisively than others on the inward eye,  some influence, or feature, or characteristic of the great mother.  The various epithets of Demeter, the local variations of her story,  its incompatible incidents, bear witness to the manner of its  generation.  They illustrate that indefiniteness which is  characteristic of Greek mythology, a theology with no central  authority, no link on historic time, liable from the first to an  unobserved transformation.  They indicate the various, far-distant  spots from which the visible body of the goddess slowly collected its  constituents, and came at last to have a well-defined existence in  the popular mind.  In this sense, Demeter appears to one in [102] her  anger, sullenly withholding the fruits of the earth, to another in  her pride of Persephone, to another in her grateful gift of the arts  of agriculture to man; at last only, is there a general recognition  of a clearly-arrested outline, a tangible embodiment, which has  solidified itself in the imagination of the people, they know not  how.    The worship of Demeter belongs to that older religion, nearer to the  earth, which some have thought they could discern, behind the more  definitely national mythology of Homer.  She is the goddess of dark  caves, and is not wholly free from monstrous form.  She gave men the  first fig in one place, the first poppy in another; in another, she  first taught the old Titans to mow.  She is the mother of the vine  also; and the assumed name by which she called herself in her  wanderings, is Dôs--a gift; the crane, as the harbinger of rain, is  her messenger among the birds.  She knows the magic powers of certain  plants, cut from her bosom, to bane or bless; and, under one of her  epithets, herself presides over the springs, as also coming from the  secret places of the earth.  She is the goddess, then, at first, of  the fertility of the earth in its wildness; and so far, her  attributes are to some degree confused with those of the Thessalian  Gaia and the Phrygian Cybele.  Afterwards, and it is now that her  most characteristic attributes begin to concentrate themselves, [103]  she separates herself from these confused relationships, as specially  the goddess of agriculture, of the fertility of the earth when  furthered by human skill.  She is the preserver of the seed sown in  hope, under many epithets derived from the incidents of vegetation,  as the simple countryman names her, out of a mind full of the various  experiences of his little garden or farm.  She is the most definite  embodiment of all those fluctuating mystical instincts, of which  Gaia,* the mother of the earth's gloomier offspring, is a vaguer and  mistier one.  There is nothing of the confused outline, the mere  shadowiness of mystical dreaming, in this most concrete human figure.  No nation, less aesthetically gifted than the Greeks, could have thus  lightly thrown its mystical surmise and divination into images so  clear and idyllic as those of the solemn goddess of the country, in  whom the characteristics of the mother are expressed with so much  tenderness, and the \"beauteous head\" of Kore, then so fresh and  peaceful.    In this phase, then, the story of Demeter appears as the peculiar  creation of country-people of a high impressibility, dreaming over  their work in spring or autumn, half consciously touched by a sense  of its sacredness, and a sort of [104] mystery about it.  For there  is much in the life of the farm everywhere which gives to persons of  any seriousness of disposition, special opportunity for grave and  gentle thoughts.  The temper of people engaged in the occupations of  country life, so permanent, so \"near to nature,\" is at all times  alike; and the habitual solemnity of thought and expression which  Wordsworth found in the peasants of Cumberland, and the painter  François Millet in the peasants of Brittany, may well have had its  prototype in early Greece.  And so, even before the development, by  the poets, of their aweful and passionate story, Demeter and  Persephone seem to have been pre-eminently the venerable, or aweful,  goddesses.  Demeter haunts the fields in spring, when the young lambs  are dropped; she visits the barns in autumn; she takes part in mowing  and binding up the corn, and is the goddess of sheaves.  She presides  over all the pleasant, significant details of the farm, the  threshing-floor and the full granary, and stands beside the woman  baking bread at the oven.  With these fancies are connected certain  simple rites; the half-understood local observance, and the half-  believed local legend, reacting capriciously on each other.  They  leave her a fragment of bread and a morsel of meat, at the cross-  roads, to take on her journey; and perhaps some real Demeter carries  them away, as she wanders through the country.  The incidents of  their yearly labour become to [105] them acts of worship; they seek  her blessing through many expressive names, and almost catch sight of  her, at dawn or evening, in the nooks of the fragrant fields.  She  lays a finger on the grass at the road-side, and some new flower  comes up.  All the picturesque implements of country life are hers;  the poppy also, emblem of an inexhaustible fertility, and full of  mysterious juices for the alleviation of pain.  The countrywoman who  puts her child to sleep in the great, cradle-like, basket, for  winnowing the corn, remembers Demeter Courotrophos, the mother of  corn and children alike, and makes it a little coat out of the dress  worn by its father at his initiation into her mysteries.  Yet she is  an angry goddess too, sometimes--Demeter Erinnys, the goblin of the  neighbourhood, haunting its shadowy places.  She lies on the ground  out of doors on summer nights, and becomes wet with the dew.  She  grows young again every spring, yet is of great age, the wrinkled  woman of the Homeric hymn, who becomes the nurse of Demophoon.  Other  lighter, errant stories nest themselves, as time goes on, within the  greater.  The water-newt, which repels the lips of the traveller who  stoops to drink, is a certain urchin, Abas, who spoiled by his  mockery the pleasure of the thirsting goddess, as she drank once of a  wayside spring in her wanderings.

I therefore beg you to ponder on the cause of your  indignation. A little confession of your thoughtless conduct  would have made all well,--if you do not take it ill, dear friend,  may still make all well. From this you see how much I love you.  I do not flare up as you do; I think, I consider, and I feel. If  you have any feeling I am sure that I will be able to say to  myself before night: Constanze is the virtuous, honor-loving,  sensible and faithful sweetheart of just and well-meaning Mozart.\"    (Vienna, April 29, 1782, to his fiancee, Constanze Weber. She had  played at a game of forfeits such as was looked upon lightly by  the frivolous society of the period in Vienna. Mozart rebuked her  and she broke off the engagement. The letter followed and soon  thereafter a reconciliation. Mozart had said to her: \"No girl who  is jealous of her honor would do such a thing.\")    195. \"She is an honest, good girl of decent parents;--I am able  to provide her with bread;--we love each other and want each  other!...It is better to put one's things to rights and be an  honest fellow!--God will give the reward! I do not want to have  anything to reproach myself with.\"    (Vienna, July 31, 1782, to his father, who had given his consent,  hesitatingly and unwillingly, to the marriage of his son who was  twenty-six years old. On August 7 Mozart wrote to him: \"I kiss  your hands and thank you with all the tenderness which a son  should feel for his father, for your kind permission and paternal  blessing.\")    196. \"If I were to tell you all the things that I do with your  portrait, you would laugh heartily. For instance when I take it  out of its prison house I say 'God bless you, Stanzerl! God bless  you, you little rascal,--Krallerballer--Sharpnose--little  Bagatelle!' And when I put it back I let it slip down slowly and  gradually and say 'Nu,--Nu,--Nu,--Nu;' but with the emphasis  which this highly significant word demands, and at the last,  quickly: 'Good-night, little Mouse, sleep well!' Now, I suppose,  I have written down a lot of nonsense (at least so the world  would think); but for us, who love each other so tenderly, it  isn't altogether silly.\"    (Dresden, April 13, 1789, to his wife in Vienna.)    197. \"Dear little wife, I have a multitude of requests;  1mo, I beg of you not to be sad.    \"2do, that you take care of your health and not trust the spring  air.    \"3tio, that you refrain from walking out alone, or, better, do  not walk out at all.    \"4to, that you rest assured of my love. Not a letter have I  written to you but that your portrait was placed in front of  mine.    \"5to, I beg of you to consider not only my honor and yours in  your conduct but also in appearances. Do not get angry because of  this request. You ought to love me all the more because I make so  much of honor.\"    (Dresden, April 16, 1789, to his wife, in Vienna, who was fond of  life's pleasures.)    198. \"You can not imagine how slowly time goes when you are not  with me! I can't describe the feeling; there is a sort of sense  of emptiness, which hurts--a certain longing which can not be  satisfied, and hence never ends, but grows day by day. When I  remember how childishly merry we were in Baden, and what  mournful, tedious hours I pass here, my work gives me no  pleasure, because it is not possible as was my wont, to chat a  few words with you when stopping for a moment. If I go to the  Clavier and sing something from the opera (Die Zauberflote) I  must stop at once because of my emotions.--Basta!\"    (Vienna, July 7, 1791, to his wife, who was taking the waters at  Baden.)    199. \"I call only him or her a friend who is a friend under all  circumstances, who thinks day or night of nothing else than to  promote the welfare of a friend, who urges all well-to-do friends  and works himself to make the other person happy.\"    (Kaisersheim, December 18, 1778, to his father. Mozart was making  the journey from Mannheim to Munich in the carriage of a prelate.  The parting with his Mannheim friends, especially with Frau  Cannabich, his motherly friend, was hard. \"For me, who never made  a more painful parting than this, the journey was only half  pleasant--it would even have been a bore, if from childhood I had  not been accustomed to leave people, countries and cities.\")    200. \"Permit me to beg for a continuance of your precious  friendship, and to ask you to accept mine for now and forever;  with an honest heart I vow it to you everlastingly. True it will  be of little use to you; but it will be the more durable and  honest for that reason. You know that the best and truest friends  are the poor. Rich people know nothing of friendship!--especially  those who are born rich and those who have become rich  fortuitously,--they are too often wrapped up completely in their  own luck! But there is nothing to fear from a man who has been  placed in advantageous circumstances, not through blind, but  deserved good fortune, through merit,--a man who did not lose  courage because of his first failures,--who remained true to his  religion and trust in God, was a good Christian and an honest man  and cherished and valued his true friend,--in a word,--a man who  has deserved better fortune--from such a man, there is nothing to  fear.\"    (Paris, August 7, 1778, to his friend Bullinger, in Salzburg, to  whom he felt beholden for the gentle and considerate way in which  he had broken the news of his mother's death to the family.)    201. \"My friend, had I but the money which many a man who does  not deserve it wastes so miserably,--if I only had it! O, with  what joy would I not help you!--But, alas! those who can will  not, and those who would like to can not!\"    (Paris, July 29, 1778, to Fridolin Weber, father of Constanze.  The letter was found but recently among some Goethe autographs.)        WORLDLY WISDOM        Mozart's father brought him up to be worldly wise. While  journeying at a tender age through the world with his father the  lad became an eye witness of the paternal business management  with all its attention to detail; of the art of utilizing persons  and conditions in order to achieve material results. As a youth  he repeats the journeys accompanied by his mother whom he loses  by death in Paris. Regularly from Salzburg his father sends him  letters full of admonitions and advice, the subjects almost  systematically grouped. The worldly wisdom of the son is the  fruit of paternal education, which he did not outgrow up to the  day of his death. But life, experience, was also an educator; a  seeming distrust of mankind speaks out of many a passage in his  letters, but on the whole he thought too well of his fellow men,  and remained blind to the faults of his false friends who basely  exploited him for their own ends. Although gifted with keen  powers of observation he always followed his kind heart instead  of his better judgment and his sister spoke no more than the  truth when she said after his death: \"Outside of music he was,  and remained, nearly always, a child. This was the chief trait of  his character on its shady side; he always needed a father,  mother, or other guardian.\"    202. \"Reflect, too, on this only too certain truth: it is not  always wise to do all the things contemplated. Often one thinks  one thing would be most advisable and another unadvisable and  bad, when, if it were done, the opposite results would disclose  themselves.\"    (Mannheim, December 10, 1777, to his father, when a plan for an  appointment in Mannheim came to naught.)    203. \"I am not indifferent but only resolved, and therefore, I  can endure everything with patience,--provided, only, that  neither my honor nor the good name of Mozart shall suffer  therefrom. Well, since it must be so, so be it; only I beg, do  not rejoice or sorrow prematurely; for let happen what may it  will be all right so long as we remain well--happiness exists  only in the imagination.\"    (Mannheim, November 29, 1777, to his father, who had upbraided  him because of his reckless expenditures. At the time Mozart was  hoping for an appointment at Mannheim.)    204. \"Dearest and best of fathers:--You shall see that things go  better and better with me. What use is this perpetual turmoil,  this hurried fortune? It does not endure.--Che va piano va, sano.  One must adjust himself to circumstances.\"    (Vienna, December 22, 1781, to his father, just before Mozart's  marriage engagement to Constanze Weber.)    205. \"Now, to put your mind at ease, I am doing nothing without  reasons, and well-founded ones, too.\"    (Vienna, October 21, 1781, to his \"little cousin,\" who may still  have cherished hopes of capturing her merry kinsman.)    206. \"I have no news except that 35, 59, 60, 61, 62, were the  winning numbers in the lottery, and, therefore, that if we had  played those numbers we would have won; but that inasmuch as we  did not play those numbers we neither won nor lost but had a good  laugh at others.\"    (Milan, October 26, 1771, to his sister.)    207. \"Everybody was extremely courteous, and therefore I was also  very courteous; for it is my custom to conduct myself towards  others as they conduct themselves towards me,--it's the best way  to get along.\"    (Augsburg, October 14, 1777, to his father.)    208. \"In Vienna and all the imperial hereditaments the theatres  will all open in six weeks. It is wisely designed; for the dead  are not so much benefited by the long mourning as many people are  harmed.\"    (Munich, December 13, 1780, to his father. Empress Maria Theresa  had died on November 29. Mozart had greatly revered her from his  youth. Nevertheless he takes a practical view of the situation  since the production of his opera \"Idomeneo\" is imminent. He  requests of his father to have his \"black coat thoroughly dusted,  cleaned and put to rights,\" and to send it to him, since  \"everybody would go into mourning, and I, who will be summoned  hither and"]]]
