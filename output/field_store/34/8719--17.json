The lubras secretly enjoyed the discomfiture of their lords and masters,  and taking me into their confidence, made it very plain that a lubra's  life at times is anything but a happy one; particularly if \"me boy all  day krowl (growl).\" As for the lords and masters themselves, the insult  rankled so that they spent the next few days telling great and valiant  tales of marvellous personal daring, hoping to wipe the stain of  cowardice from their characters. Fortunately for themselves, Billy Muck  and Jimmy had been absent from the wood-heap, and, therefore, not having  committed themselves on the subject of wild blacks, bragged excessively.  Had they been present, knowing the old fellows well, I venture to think  there would have been no intimidation scheme floated.    As the Dandy put it, \"altogether the time passed pleasantly,\" and when  the Maluka returned we were all on the best of terms, having reached  the phase of friendship when pet names are permissible. The missus had  become \"Gadgerrie\" to the old men and certain privileged lubras. What  it means I do not know, excepting that it seemed to imply fellowship.  Perhaps it meant \"old pal\" or \"mate,\" or, judging from the tone of  voice that accompanied it, \"old girl,\" but more probably, like \"Maluka,\"  untranslatable. The Maluka was always \"Maluka\" to the old men, and to  some of us who imitated them.    Dan came in the day after the Maluka, and, hearing of our \"affairs,\"  took all the credit of it to himself.    \"Just shows what a bit of educating'll do,\" he said. \"The Dandy would  have had a gay old time of it if I hadn't put you up to their capers\";  and I had humbly to acknowledge the truth of all he said.    \"I don't say you're not promising well,\" he added, satisfied with my  humility. \"If Johnny'll only stay away long enough, we'll have you  educated up to doing without a house.\"    Within a week it seemed as though Johnny was aiding and abetting Dan in  his scheme of education; for he sent in word that his \"cross-cut saw,\"  or something equally important, had doubled up on him, and he was going  back to Katherine to \"see about it straight off.\"        CHAPTER IX        Before the mustered horses were drafted out, every one at the homestead,  blacks, whites, and Chinese, went up to the stockyard to \"have a look at  them.\"    Dan was in one of his superior moods. \"Let's see if she knows anything  about horses,\" he said condescendingly, as the Quiet Stockman opened the  mob up a little to show the animals to better advantage. \"Show us your  fancy in this lot, missus.\" \"Certainly,\" I said, affecting particular  knowledge of the subject, and Jack wheeled with a quick, questioning  look, suddenly aware that, after all, a woman MIGHT be only a  fellow-man; and as I glanced from one beautiful animal to another he  watched keenly, half expectant and half incredulous.    It did not take long to choose. In the foreground stood a magnificent  brown colt, that caught and held the attention, as it watched every  movement with ears shot forward, and nostrils quivering; and as I  pointed it out Jack's boyish face lit up with surprise and pleasure.    \"Talk of luck!\" Dan cried, as usual withholding the benefit of the  doubt. \"You've picked Jack's fancy.\"    But it was Jack himself who surprised every one, for, forgetting his  monosyllables, he said with an indescribable ring of fellowship in his  voice, \"She's picked out the best in the whole mob,\" and turned back to  his world among the horses with his usual self-possession.    Dan's eyes opened wide. \"Whatever's come to Jack?\" he said; but seemed  puzzled at the Maluka's answer that he was \"only getting educated.\"  The truth is, that every man has his vulnerable point, and Jack's was  horses.    When the mob had been put through the yards, all the unbroken horses  were given into the Quiet Stockmas's care, and for the next week or two  the stockyard became the only place of real interest; for the homestead,  waiting for the Wet to lift, had settled down to store lists, fencing,  and stud books.    It was not the horses alone that were of interest at the yards; the  calm, fearless, self-reliant man who was handling them was infinitely  more so. Nothing daunted or disheartened him; and in those hours spent  on the stockyard fence, in the shade of a spreading tree, I learnt to  know the Quiet Stockman for the man he was.    If any one would know the inner character of a fellow man, let him put  him to horse-breaking, and he will soon know the best or the worst of  him. Let him watch him handling a wild, unbroken colt, and if he is  steadfast of purpose, just, brave, and true-hearted, it will all be  revealed; but if he lacks self-restraint, or is cowardly, shifty, or  mean-spirited, he will do well to avoid the test, for the horse will  betray him.    Jack's horse-breaking was a battle for supremacy of mind over mind, not  mind over matter a long course of careful training and schooling, in  which nothing was broken, but all bent to the control of a master. To  him no two horses were alike; carefully he studied their temperaments,  treating each horse according to its nature using the whip freely with  some, and with others not at all; coercing, coaxing, or humouring, as  his judgment directed. Working always for intelligent obedience, not  cowed stupidity, he appeared at times to be almost reasoning with the  brute mind, as he helped it to solve the problems of its schooling;  penetrating dull stupidity with patient reiteration, or wearing down  stubborn opposition with steady, unwavering persistence, and always  rewarding ultimate obedience with gentle kindness and freedom.    Step by step, the training proceeded. Submission first, then an  establishment of perfect trust and confidence between horse and man,  without which nothing worth having could be attained.    After that, in orderly succession the rest followed: toleration of  handling, reining, mouthing, leading on foot, and on horseback and in  due time saddling and mounting. One thing at a time and nothing new  until the old was so perfected that when all was ready for the  mounting from a spectacular point of view the mounting was generally  disappointing. Just a little rearing and curvetting, then a quiet,  trusting acceptance of this new order of things.    Half a dozen horses were in hand at once, and, as with children at  school, some quickly got ahead of the others, and every day the interest  grew keener and keener in the individual character of the horses. At  the end of a week Jack announced that he was \"going to catch the brown  colt,\" next day. \"It'll be worth seeing,\" he said; and from the Quiet  Stockman that was looked upon as a very pressing invitation.    From the day of the draughting he had ceased altogether to avoid me, and  in the days that followed had gradually realised that a horse could be  more to a woman than a means of locomotion; and now no longer drew the  line at conversations.    When we went up to the yards in the morning, the brown colt was in a  small yard by itself, and Jack was waiting at the gate, ready for its  \"catching.\"    With a laugh at the wild rush with which the colt avoided him, he  shut himself into the yard with it, and moved quietly about, sometimes  towards it and sometimes from it; at times standing still and looking  it over, and at other times throwing a rope or sack carelessly down,  waiting until his presence had become familiar, and the colt had learned  that there was nothing to fear from it.    There was a curious calmness in the man's movements, a fearless repose  that utterly ignored the wild rushes, and as a natural result they  soon ceased; and within just a minute or two the beautiful creature was  standing still, watching in quivering wonder.    Gradually a double rope began to play in the air with ever-increasing  circles, awakening anew the colt's fears; and as these in turn subsided,  without any apparent effort a long running noose flickered out from the  circling rope, and, falling over the strong young head, lay still on the  arching neck.    The leap forward was terrific; but the rope brought the colt up with a  jerk; and in the instant's pause that followed the Quiet Stockman  braced himself for the mad rearing plunges that were coming. There was  literally only an instant's pause, and then with a clatter of hoofs the  plungings began, and were met with muscles of iron, and jaw set like  a vice, as the man, with heels dug into the ground dragged back on  the rope, yielding as much as his judgment allowed--enough to ease the  shocks, but not an inch by compulsion.    Twice the rearing, terrified creature circled round him and then the  rope began to shorten to a more workable length. There was no haste, no  flurry. Surely and steadily the rope shortened (but the horse went to  the man not the man to the horse; that was to come later). With the  shortening of the rope the compelling power of the man's will forced  itself into the brute mind, and, bending to that will, the wild leaps  and plungings took on a vague suggestion of obedience--a going WITH  the rope, not against it; that was all. An erratic going, perhaps, but  enough to tell that the horse had acknowledged a master. That was all  Jack asked for at first, and, satisfied, he relaxed his muscles, and as  the rope slackened the horse turned and faced him; and the marvel was  how quickly it was all over.    But something was to follow, that once seen could never be forgotten the  advance of the man to the horse.    With barely perceptible movement, the man's hands stole along the rope  at a snail's pace. Never hurrying never stopping, they did on, the colt  watching them as though mesmerised. When within reach of the dilated  nostrils, they paused and waited, and slowly the sensitive head came  forward snuffing, more in bewilderment than fear at this "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/470"],[0,"Heretics (#15)"],[1,"because it is not  even a servility to the strong. But all who begin with force and  conquest will end in this.    The chief characteristic of the \"New journalism\" is simply that it is  bad journalism.  It is beyond all comparison the most shapeless,  careless, and colourless work done in our day.    I read yesterday a sentence which should be written in letters of gold  and adamant; it is the very motto of the new philosophy of Empire. I  found it (as the reader has already eagerly guessed) in Pearson's  Magazine, while I was communing (soul to soul) with Mr. C. Arthur  Pearson, whose first and suppressed name I am afraid is Chilperic. It  occurred in an article on the American Presidential Election. This is  the sentence, and every one should read it carefully, and roll it on  the tongue, till all the honey be tasted.    \"A little sound common sense often goes further with an audience of  American working-men than much high-flown argument.  A speaker who, as  he brought forward his points, hammered nails into a board, won  hundreds of votes for his side at the last Presidential Election.\"    I do not wish to soil this perfect thing with comment; the words of  Mercury are harsh after the songs of Apollo. But just think for a  moment of the mind, the strange inscrutable mind, of the man who wrote  that, of the editor who approved it, of the people who are probably  impressed by it, of the incredible American working-man, of whom, for  all I know, it may be true. Think what their notion of \"common sense\"  must be!  It is delightful to realize that you and I are now able to  win thousands of votes should we ever be engaged in a Presidential  Election, by doing something of this kind.  For I suppose the nails and  the board are not essential to the exhibition of \"common sense;\" there  may be variations. We may read--    \"A little common sense impresses American working-men more than  high-flown argument.  A speaker who, as he made his points, pulled  buttons off his waistcoat, won thousands of votes for his side.\" Or,  \"Sound common sense tells better in America than high-flown argument.  Thus Senator Budge, who threw his false teeth in the air every time he  made an epigram, won the solid approval of American working-men.\" Or  again, \"The sound common sense of a gentleman from Earlswood, who stuck  straws in his hair during the progress of his speech, assured the  victory of Mr. Roosevelt.\"    There are many other elements in this article on which I should love to  linger.  But the matter which I wish to point out is that in that  sentence is perfectly revealed the whole truth of what our  Chamberlainites, hustlers, bustlers, Empire-builders, and strong,  silent men, really mean by \"commonsense.\"  They mean knocking, with  deafening noise and dramatic effect, meaningless bits of iron into a  useless bit of wood.  A man goes on to an American platform and behaves  like a mountebank fool with a board and a hammer; well, I do not blame  him; I might even admire him. He may be a dashing and quite decent  strategist.  He may be a fine romantic actor, like Burke flinging the  dagger on the floor. He may even (for all I know) be a sublime mystic,  profoundly impressed with the ancient meaning of the divine trade of  the Carpenter, and offering to the people a parable in the form of a  ceremony. All I wish to indicate is the abyss of mental confusion in  which such wild ritualism can be called \"sound common sense.\" And it is  in that abyss of mental confusion, and in that alone, that the new  Imperialism lives and moves and has its being. The whole glory and  greatness of Mr. Chamberlain consists in this: that if a man hits the  right nail on the head nobody cares where he hits it to or what it  does.  They care about the noise of the hammer, not about the silent  drip of the nail.  Before and throughout the African war, Mr.  Chamberlain was always knocking in nails, with ringing decisiveness.  But when we ask, \"But what have these nails held together? Where is  your carpentry?  Where are your contented Outlanders? Where is your  free South Africa?  Where is your British prestige? What have your  nails done?\" then what answer is there? We must go back (with an  affectionate sigh) to our Pearson for the answer to the question of  what the nails have done: \"The speaker who hammered nails into a board  won thousands of votes.\"    Now the whole of this passage is admirably characteristic of the new  journalism which Mr. Pearson represents, the new journalism which has  just purchased the Standard.  To take one instance out of hundreds, the  incomparable man with the board and nails is described in the Pearson's  article as calling out (as he smote the symbolic nail), \"Lie number  one. Nailed to the Mast!  Nailed to the Mast!\"  In the whole office  there was apparently no compositor or office-boy to point out that we  speak of lies being nailed to the counter, and not to the mast. Nobody  in the office knew that Pearson's Magazine was falling into a stale  Irish bull, which must be as old as St. Patrick. This is the real and  essential tragedy of the sale of the Standard. It is not merely that  journalism is victorious over literature. It is that bad journalism is  victorious over good journalism.    It is not that one article which we consider costly and beautiful is  being ousted by another kind of article which we consider common or  unclean. It is that of the same article a worse quality is preferred to  a better. If you like popular journalism (as I do), you will know that  Pearson's Magazine is poor and weak popular journalism.  You will know  it as certainly as you know bad butter.  You will know as certainly  that it is poor popular journalism as you know that the Strand, in the  great days of Sherlock Holmes, was good popular journalism. Mr. Pearson  has been a monument of this enormous banality. About everything he says  and does there is something infinitely weak-minded. He clamours for  home trades and employs foreign ones to print his paper.  When this  glaring fact is pointed out, he does not say that the thing was an  oversight, like a sane man. He cuts it off with scissors, like a child  of three.  His very cunning is infantile.  And like a child of three,  he does not cut it quite off. In all human records I doubt if there is  such an example of a profound simplicity in deception.  This is the  sort of intelligence which now sits in the seat of the sane and  honourable old Tory journalism. If it were really the triumph of the  tropical exuberance of the Yankee press, it would be vulgar, but still  tropical.  But it is not. We are delivered over to the bramble, and  from the meanest of the shrubs comes the fire upon the cedars of  Lebanon.    The only question now is how much longer the fiction will endure that  journalists of this order represent public opinion. It may be doubted  whether any honest and serious Tariff Reformer would for a moment  maintain that there was any majority for Tariff Reform in the country  comparable to the ludicrous preponderance which money has given it  among the great dailies. The only inference is that for purposes of  real public opinion the press is now a mere plutocratic oligarchy.  Doubtless the public buys the wares of these men, for one reason or  another. But there is no more reason to suppose that the public admires  their politics than that the public admires the delicate philosophy of  Mr. Crosse or the darker and sterner creed of Mr. Blackwell. If these  men are merely tradesmen, there is nothing to say except that there are  plenty like them in the Battersea Park Road, and many much better.  But  if they make any sort of attempt to be politicians, we can only point  out to them that they are not as yet even good journalists.        IX.  The Moods of Mr. George Moore    Mr. George Moore began his literary career by writing his personal  confessions; nor is there any harm in this if he had not continued them  for the remainder of his life.  He is a man of genuinely forcible mind  and of great command over a kind of rhetorical and fugitive conviction  which excites and pleases. He is in a perpetual state of temporary  honesty.  He has admired all the most admirable modern eccentrics until  they could stand it no longer.  Everything he writes, it is to be fully  admitted, has a genuine mental power.  His account of his reason for  leaving the Roman Catholic Church is possibly the most admirable  tribute to that communion which has been written of late years. For the  fact of the matter is, that the weakness which has rendered barren the  many brilliancies of Mr. Moore is actually that weakness which the  Roman Catholic Church is at its best in combating. Mr. Moore hates  Catholicism because it breaks up the house of looking-glasses in which  he lives.  Mr. Moore does not dislike so much being asked to believe in  the spiritual existence of miracles or sacraments, but he does  fundamentally dislike being asked to believe in the actual existence of  other people. Like his master Pater and all the aesthetes, his real  quarrel with life is that it is not a dream that can be moulded by the  dreamer. It is not the dogma of the reality of the other world that  troubles him, but the dogma of the reality of this world.    The truth is that the tradition of Christianity (which is still the  only coherent ethic of Europe) rests on two or three paradoxes or  mysteries which can easily be impugned in argument and as easily  justified in life. One of them, for instance, is the paradox of hope or  faith--that the more hopeless is the situation the more hopeful must be  the man. Stevenson understood this, and consequently Mr. Moore cannot  understand Stevenson.  Another is the paradox of charity or chivalry  that the weaker a thing is the more it should be respected, that the  more indefensible a thing is the more it should appeal to us for a  certain kind of defence."]]]
