While this way  of keeping fowls on farms is not in itself commendable, it is not to be  altogether condemned, because circumstances often compel the farmer to  treat his fowls as a sort of volunteer or self-producing crop. The  conditions on a farm admit of this, and as a matter of fact the greater  part of our enormous total production of eggs and poultry comes from the  half-neglected flocks on the ordinary farms. Hence the conditions are  tolerable where they are necessary, but whenever it is possible to give  farm fowls enough attention to obviate the faults of common practice,  the product and the profits can be greatly increased with very little  increase in the cost of production. In this section we consider the  best methods of securing this result when all the old stock is to be  kept as one flock. Old stock and young ought always to be separated  unless the old birds constitute an insignificant portion of the flock.    [Illustration: Fig. 82. Good poultry house on Texas farm. (Photograph  from Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of  Agriculture)]    =Single houses for farm flocks.= It is as true on a farm as elsewhere  that the greatest yields of eggs and the best growth in young birds are  secured when the flock is divided into small groups. But a farm flock of  the class under consideration, while it makes its headquarters in such  buildings as may be provided, will forage a considerable distance in  every direction, going among growing crops from which the larger farm  animals must be excluded, and also following the larger animals in their  stables, yards, and pastures and picking up food left by them. As fowls  also eat many weeds and seeds of weeds, and all kinds of destructive  insects, the advantages of letting them run at large more than make up  for lower production. Also the production is normal and can be easily  maintained from year to year in the same line of stock, while high  production secured by extra care is forced and can be maintained in the  same line of stock for only a few generations. A flock of one hundred  fowls or less, that run together, may all be kept in one house just as  well as in several, if the size of the house and the equipment are in  proportion to the size of the flock.    [Illustration: Fig. 83. Rude poultry house on a Kansas farm. (Photograph  from Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of  Agriculture)]    If the snow lies long on the ground, so that the fowls are confined to  the house much of the time in winter, the allowance of floor space  should be about 5 sq. ft. per bird. Where the snow rarely lies more than  a day or two at a time, less space may be given, because the birds will  not occupy the house much of the time during the day. Under such  conditions the allowance of floor space may be as low as 3 sq. ft. per  bird. Those who go to this limit, however, should consider that, in the  unusual case of a snowstorm keeping the hens confined to the house for  more than a very few days, overcrowding may cause losses that more than  offset what was gained by using the highest capacity of the house.    Usually a flock of fifty hens needs a house with a floor surface of  about 250 sq. ft. This is obtained in a house 16 ft. square or in a  house 12 ft. x 24 ft. A house 20 ft. square is about right for  seventy-five or eighty hens, and is not badly overcrowded if one hundred  medium-sized birds are put into it. If an oblong building is preferred,  a house 12 ft. wide by 42 ft. long gives one hundred birds 5 sq. ft. of  floor space per bird. Houses of such size should be from 4 ft. to 7 ft.  high at the sides, and from 7 ft. to 10 ft. high at the highest point of  the roof, according to the style of construction.    [Illustration: Fig. 84. Good poultry house on a Kansas farm. (Photograph  from Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of  Agriculture)]    =Feeding.= In the feeding of a farm flock the first thing to consider is  what the birds can pick up by foraging. The poultry keeper on a farm,  even more than the poultry keeper elsewhere, should make it a rule to do  nothing for poultry that they can do for themselves. Fowls can do more  for themselves at some seasons than at others, because natural food is  more abundant. As fowls do not usually go very far from their house, the  larger the flock the less food each bird will secure. On some farms  quite a large flock of fowls can get all the food they need about the  barns and stockyards and in orchards and fields near the homestead.    [Illustration: Fig. 85. Poultry house at Mississippi Agricultural  College.[10] (Photograph from the college)]    [10] In this house the part of the rear wall above the roost platform is  made to open wide, thus affording perfect ventilation in summer.    When the conditions are such that it may reasonably be supposed that the  fowls can get all the food they require without going farther than fowls  usually wander, the best way to determine whether this supposition is  correct is to give them no food until evening, then throw out a little  grain and see how much they will eat. If it appears that they need to be  fed a considerable quantity, it is better to give a light feed in the  morning and another in the evening than to give a heavy feed once a day,  because if they learn to expect a full feed at a regular time, they will  not forage so well. Fowls that have an opportunity to secure  considerable food by foraging should never be fed so much in the  morning that they will sit around for hours. When hens on a farm need  only one or two light feeds a day, whatever grain is most convenient may  be given them. Where they get so much exercise and a good variety of  other foods, whole corn is as good as anything. A good way to feed it is  to break the ears into short pieces and let the birds pick the grain  from the cob.    In winter the feeding of the farm flock should have more attention,  especially if little food can be secured around the stables and  stockyards. It is a good plan to give, once a day, a warm mash made of 1  part (by measure) of corn meal and 2 parts of bran, and to give as much  grain at one other feeding as the hens will eat. Some farmers use sheaf  oats for litter in the floors of their poultry houses, throwing in a  sheaf or two as often as is necessary to keep a good depth of litter on  the floor, and then give as much corn in addition as the hens will eat  readily.    [Illustration: Fig. 86. Open-front house with hood. (Photograph from  Department of Agriculture, Victoria, British Columbia)]    If it is not convenient to make a mash, what grain the fowls will eat  quickly from a trough may be prepared for a warm breakfast for them by  pouring boiling water on it in the evening and letting it soak  overnight. Any of the small grains and cracked corn may be fed in this  way; whole corn needs longer soaking. In hard, freezing weather no more  mash or soaked grain should be given than the fowls will eat before it  can freeze. A favorite old-time practice still used on many farms is to  heat shelled corn in the oven and feed it while warm.    The best vegetable foods for fowls in winter are cabbages and  mangel-wurzels. The cabbages can be hung up by the roots and the fowls  will eat all but the stump. The most convenient way to feed the beets  is to split them and impale the pieces on spikes in the wall at a  convenient distance from the floor. Sound, sweet turnips are also good,  but bitter turnips and those that have begun to spoil are likely to give  an unpleasant flavor to the eggs. A little freezing does not seem to  affect the value of these vegetables for poultry food, and the birds  will usually eat them when frozen. The quantity fed at one time,  however, should not be so large that it may freeze and thaw several  times before it is all eaten.    [Illustration: Fig. 87. Movable poultry house on United States  Government farm, Beltsville, Maryland. (Photograph from Bureau of Animal  Industry)]    When hogs and cattle are killed on a farm, the blood and other offal,  and the small trimmings when the carcasses are cut up, should be saved  and fed to the fowls regularly in moderate quantities, but care should  be taken not to leave fat trimmings where the fowls can help themselves,  for if fowls have been short of animal food, they eat meat very  greedily and are often made sick by it. Blood and lean meat are not  very injurious, but too much fat meat has very bad effects.    [Illustration: Fig. 88. The upper shutter is closed only at night in  extreme cold weather]    [Illustration: Fig. 89. Lower part of front open for hot weather]    ANOTHER STYLE OF MOVABLE HOUSE AT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FARM,  BELTSVILLE, MARYLAND. (Photograph from Bureau of Animal Industry)    It is not necessary to give the fowls water when there is snow on the  ground. Delicate fowls that are accustomed to close confinement may not  be able to stand running out on the snow, but if they have a comfortable  house, with a good supply of litter on the floor, and are free to go and  come at will, rugged birds that are out in all kinds of weather are not  in the least hurt by going out on snow and ice and wet ground in cold  weather, and will usually take snow in preference to water when they can  get it. When the ground is bare and frozen, water or finely chipped ice  should be supplied. In extreme cold weather the latter is better,  because the water soon freezes and the fowls go thirsty until a fresh  supply is given them.    [Illustration: Fig. 90.

A  little above I mentioned basket-makers: at that time, all kinds of  furniture, such as cupboards, benches, and chests, were wrought by  mechanics, and then painted, especially when intended as the furniture  of new married women. Many ancient cabinet pictures have been cut out of  such pieces of furniture, and, by this means, preserved to later ages.  As for images on altars, through the whole of the fourteenth century,  they were not formed, as at present, on a separate piece from the  surrounding ornaments. There were made little altars, or dittici,[57] in  many parts of Italy, called _Ancone_; they first shaped the wood, and  laboriously ornamented it with carving. The design was conformed to the  Teutonic, or, as it is called, the Gothic architecture, seen in the  facades of churches built in that age. The whole work was a load of  minuteness, consisting of little tabernacles, pyramids, and niches; and  various doors and windows, with semi-circular and pointed arches, were  represented on the surface of the panel; a style very characteristic of  that period. I have sometimes there observed, in the middle, little  statues in mezzo-relievo.[58] Most frequently the painter designed these  figures or busts of saints: sometimes there were also prepared various  sorts of little forms, or moulds--formelle--in which to represent  histories. Often there was a step added to the little altar, where, in  several compartments, were likewise exhibited histories of our Saviour,  of the Virgin, and of the martyrs, either real or feigned.[59] Sometimes  various compartments were prepared, in which their lives were  represented. The carvers in wood were so vain of their craft, that they  often inscribed their own names before that of the painter.[60]    Even pictures for rooms were fashioned by the carvers into triangular  and square forms, which they surrounded with heavy borders, with rude  foliage, lace, or Arabesque ornaments around them. In that age, pictures  were rarely committed to canvass alone, though some such are to be seen  at Florence, and more among the Venetians and people of Bologna; but  panels were most frequently employed. The borders often inclosed  portions of canvass, not unfrequently of parchment, and sometimes of  leather, which, in all probability, were prepared by those who usually  wrought in such materials; and this is the reason why such artists, and  even in some instances saddlers, were sometimes associated with  painters.    History informs us that shields for war, or the tournament, and also  various equestrian accoutrements, as the saddles and trappings of  horses, were ornamented with painting, a custom which was retained till  the time of Francia, as Vasari mentions in his life; hence, armourers  and saddlers became associated with painters. Among them in like manner  might be included those who prepared walls for painting in fresco, and  who covered them with a reddish ground, which not unfrequently is still  discovered in the flaws. On this colour the figures were designed, and  such walls were the cartoons of the old masters. The stucco workers also  assisted them in those relieved ornaments we see in fresco paintings. I  believe they used moulds in those works, which seem nothing else than  globules, flowerets, and little stars, formed with a stamp, such as we  see on gilt plaister, on leather, on board, and on playing-cards. On  whatever substance they painted, some gold was usually added; with it  they ornamented the ground of their pictures, the glories of their  saints, their garments, and fringes. Although painters themselves were  skilled in such labours, it appears that they sought the assistance of  gilders, and therefore gilders were classed with painters, and like them  inscribed works with their names.    This was the practice of Cini and Saracini, just before recorded, and  particularly of a native of Ferrara, who, in the pictures of the  Vivarini, at Venice, subscribes his name before theirs. (_See Zanetti,  Pittura Ven._ p. 15.) And in the cathedral of Ceneda, below an  Incoronation of the Virgin, in which the artist did not care to exhibit  himself to posterity, the engraver, already noticed, left the following  inscription, which Signor Lorenzo Giustiniani, a Venetian patrician of  great taste and cultivation of mind, has very politely communicated to  me; \"1438, A DI 10. FREVER CHRISTOFALO DA FERARA INTAJO.\"    Towards the end of the fourteenth century, when the gothic style was  disappearing from architecture, the design of the carvers improved, and  they began to erect over altars oblong panels, divided by partitions,  which were fashioned into pilasters, or small columns, and often between  these last feigned gates or windows, so that the ancona or altar bore  some resemblance to the facade of a palace or a church; over them was  placed a frieze, and above the frieze was a place like a stage with some  figures. The saints were placed below, and their histories were painted  in the compartments; and often there appeared their histories painted  upon some little form, or upon the steps. The partitions were gradually  removed, the proportions of the figures enlarged, and the saints were  disposed in a single piece around the throne of our Lord, not so erect  as formerly, after the manner of statues, but in different actions and  positions, a custom which prevailed even in the sixteenth century. The  practice of gilding grounds declined towards the end of the fifteenth  century, but it was increased on the garments, and fringes were never so  deep as at that period. About the close of that century gold was more  sparingly employed, and it was almost wholly abandoned in the following.  No little benefit would be conferred upon the art by any one who would  undertake to point out with accuracy what were the colours, gums, and  other mixtures employed by the Greeks. They were undoubtedly in  possession of the best methods transmitted to them by a tradition, which  though in some measure corrupted, was confessedly derived from their  ancestors. Even subsequent to the invention of oils, their colouring is  in some degree deserving of our admiration. In the Medicean Museum there  is a Madonna, subscribed with the following Latin inscription, _Andreas  Rico de Candia pinxit_, the forms of which are stupid, the folds  inelegant, and the composition coarse; but with all this, the colour is  so fresh, vivid, and brilliant, that there is no modern work that would  not lose by a comparison; indeed, the colouring is so extremely strong  and firm, that when tried with the iron, it does not liquefy, but rather  scales off, and breaks in minute portions. The frescos, likewise, of the  earliest Greek and Italian painters, are surprisingly strong, and more  particularly in upper than in lower Italy. There are some figures of  saints upon the pilasters of the church of San Niccolo, at Trevigi,  quite remarkable for their durability, an account of which is given in  the first volume of Padre Federici, (p. 188). I have understood from  professors that such a degree of _consistency_ must have been produced  by a certain portion of wax, which was employed at that period, as will  be explained in the subsequent chapter, on the subject of painting in  oil. It must, however, be admitted, that we are very little advanced in  these inquiries into the ancient methods of preparing colour. Were they  once satisfactorily explored, it would prove highly useful in the  restoration of ancient pictures, nor superfluous in regard to the  adoption of that firm, fused, and lucid colouring, which we shall have  occasion to commend in various Lombard and Venetian pictures, and more  especially in those of Coreggio.    These observations will not be useless to the connoisseur, who doubts  the age of a picture on which there are no characters. Where there are  letters he may proceed with still greater certainty. The letters  vulgarly called gothic, began to be used after the year 1200, in some  places more early than in others; and characters were loaded with a  superfluity of lines, through the whole of the fourteenth, until about  the middle of the fifteenth century, when the use of the Roman alphabet  was revived. What forms were adopted by artists in subscribing their  names, will be more conveniently explained in the course of a few pages  further. I have judged it proper to give here a sort of paleology of  painting; because inattention to this has been, and still is, a fruitful  source of error. The reader, however, may observe, that though the rules  here proposed, afford some light to resolve doubtful points, they are  not to be considered as infallible and universal, and he may further  recollect, that in matters of antiquity nothing is more dangerous and  ridiculous, than to form general rules, which a single example may be  sufficient to overthrow.
