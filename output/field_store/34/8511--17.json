He said at first:  Belike someone hath been here, and hath had the carcase away.  Then he  laughed in very despite, and said: How may that be, since there are no  signs of dragging away of so huge a body, and no blood or fur on the  grass if they had cut him up, and moreover no trampling of feet, as if  there had been many men at the deed.  Then was he all abashed, and again  laughed in scorn of himself, and said: Forsooth I deemed I had done  manly; but now forsooth I shot nought, and nought there was before the  sword of my father's son.  And what may I deem now, but that this is a  land of mere lies, and that there is nought real and alive therein save  me.  Yea, belike even these trees and the green grass will presently  depart from me, and leave me falling down through the clouds.    Therewith he turned away, and gat him to the road that led to the Golden  House, wondering what next should befall him, and going slowly as he  pondered his case.  So came he to that first thicket where they had lost  their quarry by water; so he entered the same, musing, and bathed him in  the pool that was therein, after he had wandered about it awhile, and  found nothing new.    So again he set him to the homeward road, when the day was now waning,  and it was near sunset that he was come nigh unto the house, though it  was hidden from him as then by a low bent that rose before him; and there  he abode and looked about him.    Now as he looked, over the said bent came the figure of a woman, who  stayed on the brow thereof and looked all about her, and then ran swiftly  down to meet Walter, who saw at once that it was the Maid.    She made no stay then till she was but three paces from him, and then she  stooped down and made the sign to him, and then spake to him  breathlessly, and said: \"Hearken! but speak not till I have done: I bade  thee to-night's meeting because I saw that there was one anigh whom I  must needs beguile.  But by thine oath, and thy love, and all that thou  art, I adjure thee come not unto me this night as I bade thee! but be  hidden in the hazel-copse outside the house, as it draws toward midnight,  and abide me there.  Dost thou hearken, and wilt thou?  Say yes or no in  haste, for I may not tarry a moment of time.  Who knoweth what is behind  me?\"    \"Yes,\" said Walter hastily; \"but friend and love--\"    \"No more,\" she said; \"hope the best;\" and turning from him she ran away  swiftly, not by the way she had come, but sideways, as though to reach  the house by fetching a compass.    But Walter went slowly on his way, thinking within himself that now at  that present moment there was nought for it but to refrain him from  doing, and to let others do; yet deemed he that it was little manly to be  as the pawn upon the board, pushed about by the will of others.    Then, as he went, he bethought him of the Maiden's face and aspect, as  she came running to him, and stood before him for that minute; and all  eagerness he saw in her, and sore love of him, and distress of soul, all  blent together.    So came he to the brow of the bent whence he could see lying before him,  scarce more than a bow-shot away, the Golden House now gilded again and  reddened by the setting sun.  And even therewith came a gay image toward  him, flashing back the level rays from gold and steel and silver; and lo!  there was come the King's Son.  They met presently, and the King's Son  turned to go beside him, and said merrily: \"I give thee good even, my  Lady's Squire!  I owe thee something of courtesy, whereas it is by thy  means that I shall be made happy, both to-night, and to-morrow, and many  to-morrows; and sooth it is, that but little courtesy have I done thee  hitherto.\"    His face was full of joy, and the eyes of him shone with gladness.  He  was a goodly man, but to Walter he seemed an ill one; and he hated him so  much, that he found it no easy matter to answer him; but he refrained  himself, and said: \"I can thee thank, King's Son; and good it is that  someone is happy in this strange land.\"    \"Art thou not happy then, Squire of my Lady?\" said the other.    Walter had no mind to show this man his heart, nay, nor even a corner  thereof; for he deemed him an enemy.  So he smiled sweetly and somewhat  foolishly, as a man luckily in love, and said: \"O yea, yea, why should I  not be so?  How might I be otherwise?\"    \"Yea then,\" said the King's Son, \"why didst thou say that thou wert glad  someone is happy?  Who is unhappy, deemest thou?\" and he looked on him  keenly.    Walter answered slowly: \"Said I so?  I suppose then that I was thinking  of thee; for when first I saw thee, yea, and afterwards, thou didst seem  heavy-hearted and ill-content.\"    The face of the King's Son cleared at this word, and he said: \"Yea, so it  was; for look you, both ways it was: I was unfree, and I had sown the  true desire of my heart whereas it waxed not.  But now I am on the brink  and verge of freedom, and presently shall my desire be blossomed.  Nay  now, Squire, I deem thee a good fellow, though it may be somewhat of a  fool; so I will no more speak riddles to thee.  Thus it is: the Maid hath  promised me all mine asking, and is mine; and in two or three days, by  her helping also, I shall see the world again.\"    Quoth Walter, smiling askance on him: \"And the Lady? what shall she say  to this matter?\"    The King's Son reddened, but smiled falsely enough, and said: \"Sir  Squire, thou knowest enough not to need to ask this.  Why should I tell  thee that she accounteth more of thy little finger than of my whole body?  Now I tell thee hereof freely; first, because this my fruition of love,  and my freeing from thralldom, is, in a way, of thy doing.  For thou art  become my supplanter, and hast taken thy place with yonder lovely tyrant.  Fear not for me! she will let me go.  As for thyself, see thou to it!  But  again I tell thee hereof because my heart is light and full of joy, and  telling thee will pleasure me, and cannot do me any harm.  For if thou  say: How if I carry the tale to my Lady?  I answer, thou wilt not.  For I  know that thine heart hath been somewhat set on the jewel that my hand  holdeth; and thou knowest well on whose head the Lady's wrath would fall,  and that would be neither thine nor mine.\"    \"Thou sayest sooth,\" said Walter; \"neither is treason my wont.\"    So they walked on silently a while, and then Walter said: \"But how if the  Maiden had nay-said thee; what hadst thou done then?\"    \"By the heavens!\" said the King's Son fiercely, \"she should have paid for  her nay-say; then would I--\"  But he broke off, and said quietly, yet  somewhat doggedly: \"Why talk of what might have been?  She gave me her  yea-say pleasantly and sweetly.\"    Now Walter knew that the man lied, so he held his peace thereon; but  presently he said: \"When thou art free wilt thou go to thine own land  again?\"    \"Yea,\" said the King's Son; \"she will lead me thither.\"    \"And wilt thou make her thy lady and queen when thou comest to thy  father's land?\" said Walter.    The King's Son knit his brow, and said: \"When I am in mine own land I may  do with her what I will; but I look for it that I shall do no otherwise  with her than that she shall be well-content.\"    Then the talk between them dropped, and the King's Son turned off toward  the wood, singing and joyous; but Walter went soberly toward the house.  Forsooth he was not greatly cast down, for besides that he knew that the  King's Son was false, he deemed that under this double tryst lay  something which was a-doing in his own behalf.  Yet was he eager and  troubled, if not down-hearted, and his soul was cast about betwixt hope  and fear.          CHAPTER XX: WALTER IS BIDDEN TO ANOTHER TRYST      So came he into the pillared hall, and there he found the Lady walking to  and fro by the high-seat; and when he drew nigh she turned on him, and  said in a voice rather eager than angry: \"What hast thou done, Squire?  Why art thou come before me?\"    He was abashed, and bowed before her and said: \"O gracious Lady, thou  badest me service, and I have been about it.\"    She said: \"Tell me then, tell me, what hath betided?\"    \"Lady,\" said he, \"when I entered the thicket of thy swooning I found  there no carcase of the lion, nor any sign of the dragging away of him.\"    She looked full in his face for a little, and then went to her chair, and  sat down therein; and in a little while spake to him in a softer voice,  and said: \"Did I not tell thee that some enemy had done that unto me? and  lo! now thou seest that so it is.\"    Then was she silent again, and knit her brows and set her teeth; and  thereafter she spake harshly and fiercely: \"But I will overcome her, and  make her days evil, but keep death away from her, that she may die many  times over; and know all the sickness of the heart, when foes be nigh,  and friends afar, and there is none to deliver!\"    Her eyes flashed, and her face was dark with anger; but she turned and  caught Walter's eyes, and the sternness of his face, and she softened at  once, and said: \"But thou! this hath little to do with thee; and now to  thee I speak: Now cometh even and night.  Go thou to thy chamber, and  there shalt thou find raiment worthy of thee, what thou now art, and what  thou shalt be; do on the same, and make thyself most goodly, and then  come thou hither and eat and drink with me, and afterwards depart whither  thou wilt, till the night has worn to its midmost; and then come thou to  my chamber, to wit, through the ivory door in the gallery above; and then  and there shall I tell thee a thing, and it shall be for the weal both of  thee and of me, but for the grief and woe of the Enemy.\"    Therewith she reached her hand to him, and he kissed it, and departed and  came to his chamber, and found raiment therebefore rich beyond measure;  and he wondered if any new snare lay "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30550"],[0,"Finn The Wolfhound (#15)"],[1,"to the  rings closed, and a hurdle brought in. Then the Lady Iseult was  invited to run at and leap the hurdle. She did so, and with a good  grace, returning docilely enough to her master. Then the Master  loosed Finn, and the Mistress of the Kennels called him from the  far side of the ring. Finn bounded forward with the elasticity of a  cat, and cleared the hurdle with a perfect spring and fully two  feet to spare. The Judge stroked his imperial, laid a hand on the  shoulders of both hounds, and said--    \"The young dog has it--the finest hound I ever saw!\"          [Illustration]    CHAPTER VII    REVELATIONS      It is the custom at dog shows for the authorities to distribute  certificates on coloured cardboard of all the awards made by the  judges. At this show of Finn's great triumph, first prize cards  were all blue, second prize cards red, and third prize cards  yellow. The custom was for exhibitors proudly to affix these cards  to the wire net-work stretched above the bench of the winning dog.  So it fell out that soon after the judging of Wolfhounds was over,  two red cards and two blue cards were fixed over Kathleen's bench,  and the Mistress of the Kennels lavished considerable attention  upon her, lest she should be moved to jealousy of Finn. The  decoration of the wire-work over Finn's bench was most striking.    First, there were four blue first prize cards, for his sensational  win in Open, Limit, Novice, and Junior classes. Then there was a  very handsome card with ribbons attached, signifying that Finn had  won the Challenge Shield for the best Irish Wolfhound in the Show.  And then there were two other blue cards telling that Finn had won  two special prizes; one, a medal offered by a member of the Irish  Wolfhound Club for the best hound at the Show bred by its  exhibitor; and another, of two guineas, offered by a well-known  Irish sportsman for the biggest Irish Wolfhound in the Show. And so  Finn sat in state beneath a sort of dome consisting of no fewer  than seven trophies. It seemed a little hard on that magnificent  hound, his sire, who occupied the next bench, under the shelter of  but one solitary red card. But Dermot Asthore was a philosopher,  and, as has been said, weary of shows. He lay curled, like a great  cat, and slept stolidly, presenting nothing more conscious to the  passing throng than a small triangular section of one blood-shot  eye.    With Finn matters were otherwise. His numerous trophies won him  much attention, even from the large majority who were ignorant of  his great technical claims to fame. There was always a little group  in front of Finn's bench, and those of his admirers who had claims  upon the Master--besides many who had none--were continually begging  that he should be taken down from the bench, so that they might  admire his full stature. Then there were newspaper men with cameras  and note-books; and there were dealers with cheque-books, and a  ready hand and eye for deprecation. But these were given no sort of  encouragement by the Master. Finn received as much attention in the  evening papers that day as any leader of human society; and in the  papers devoted to doggy interests, a great deal more. He was  conscious of more of this than you might suppose, even though he  could not read newspapers: but the thing he was most keenly  conscious of was the fact that he had managed greatly to please the  Master and the Mistress of the Kennels. Finn felt happy and proud  about this, but, although he was taken down from the bench several  times and led into out-of-the-way corners where his chain could be  removed and he was able to stretch his limbs, still, he became  pretty thoroughly tired of the publicity and racket of the Dog Show  before he was led out of the building at ten o'clock that night,  with Kathleen, by the Master. The Mistress had gone home to Tara,  early in the evening; but the Master was sleeping in lodgings near  the Palace, which he had engaged on the clear understanding that he  was allowed to bring the Wolfhounds there with him. Finn had not  realized as yet that one of the penalties of the fame that he had  won lay in the fact that he was obliged to spend another two whole  days in the show building.    But though Finn and Kathleen knew it not, their lot was a far more  fortunate one than that of the great majority of their kind at the  Show. Knowing that they would be unhappy if left in the building at  night, that they probably would be too much wrought up to eat  there, and that they would feel being chained up for so long more  than most dogs, the Master had arranged to take them out at night,  in order that they might have half an hour's freedom before supper  and retirement to a sleeping place in the room he had taken for  himself. There were dogs in the Show whose masters did not come  near them after the judging on the first day, until the end of the  third day. These unfortunates were left to the rather chancy  attentions of the show attendants, who, with thousands of dogs to  care for, could hardly be expected to give any of them much  individual notice.    On the evening of the second day of the Show, while the Master was  engaged in conversation at some distance from Finn's bench, the  young hounds from the cottage by the Downs received a visit from a  man who showed the utmost admiration for them, and particularly, of  course, for Finn. This man, whose appearance rather reminded Finn  of one whom he had heard referred to as the gamekeeper, down in  Sussex, looked up Finn's name and ancestry in the show catalogue,  and gave particular heed to the fine display of prize cards over  his head. He fondled Finn for several minutes, and Finn knew by the  various smells which hung about the man that he was accustomed to  mixing a good deal with dog-folk. Before turning away, this  friendly and admiring man presented Finn with a small piece of meat  which he took from a paper-bag in one of his pockets; and, of all  the meat that Finn had ever tasted, this piece had the most  fascinating smell and the most provocatively exciting and pleasing  flavour. He meditated over this piece of meat for quite a long  time, and when, during the last afternoon of the Show, the friendly  stranger appeared before him again, Finn welcomed the man  effusively, and, with nose and paw, plainly asked for some more of  that fascinating meat. The man chuckled, and rubbed the backs of  Finn's ears in an affectionate manner for several minutes. What  Finn found more to the point was that, before leaving, the man did  present him with another small section of this delicious meat with  the fascinating smell. Finn wished there was more of it, but he  felt exceedingly grateful to the stranger for the one piece and for  the rest of his friendly attention.    By payment of a small fee the Master was enabled to take Finn and  Kathleen away from the Show much earlier on that evening than  before, and a few hours later they were all three being welcomed at  home by the Mistress of the Kennels and Tara. Tara, by the way, was  hardly able to spare time for a remark at first; she was so busy  sniffing all round Finn and Kathleen, and reading for herself the  sort of record of their recent adventures which their coats and her  delicate sense of smell provided. The three hounds dined  sumptuously, and in a row, while the Master and the Mistress sat  before them fighting their battles over again and discussing their  triumph in the show-ring. Then, the night being fine, the three  were allowed to wander out into the orchard for a quarter of an  hour or so before going to bed. The Master remained in his den  talking.    Directly Tara reached the orchard she barked out loud, \"Who's  there?\"--an unmistakable sort of bark one would have thought. But  the Master was pretty thoroughly tired, and, perhaps, the fact that  he was chatting with the Mistress prevented his understanding  Tara's bark. At all events, he paid no heed to it. Tara promptly  trotted across to the gate between the orchard and the open down,  followed closely by Finn and Kathleen. There, much to Finn's  delight, they found the friendly stranger of the Show. Tara eyed  the man with hauteur, as one whose acquaintance she had not made.  Kathleen remained modestly in the background. Finn, with lively  recollections of the peculiarly savoury meat which the stranger  dealt in, placed his fore-paws, on the top of the gate, and lolled  his tongue at the man in friendly greeting. The man gave Finn a  provokingly tiny fragment of the savoury meat, and rubbed the young  hound's ears in the coaxing way he had. Then he stepped back a pace  or two, and produced a large piece of the meat.    \"Here, boy! Here, Finn! Jump, then, Finn!\" The gate was less than  five feet high, and the seductive odour of this peculiar meat  floated just beyond it in the still night air. Finn drew back a  pace or two, and then, with a beautiful spring, cleared the gate  easily. While giving Finn the piece of meat he had been holding,  the man slipped a swivel on to the ring of the handsome green  collar, and attached to the swivel there was a strong leather lead.  The man moved on slowly, with another piece of meat in his hand,  and Finn paced with him, willingly enough. When Finn had finished  the next piece of meat he was a hundred yards away from the  orchard. He looked back then, and an uncomfortable thrill passed  through his young heart; a vague thrill it was, conveying no  definite fear or impression to his mind. Still, it was  uncomfortable. He had half a mind to go back and rejoin Tara and  Kathleen, and so, tentatively, he halted. If the friendly stranger  had tried to force Finn then, there would have been trouble. But he  did not. Instead, he bent down and played with Finn's ears, and  then brought another piece of meat out of his pocket. Holding this  out, he moved on again; and the dog followed, forgetful now of his"]]]
