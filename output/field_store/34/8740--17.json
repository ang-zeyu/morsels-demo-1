My eyes, however, were mostly bent upon the high  peak in the northern line; and Mr. Carmichael and I decided to walk  over to, and ascend it. It was apparently no more than seven or eight  miles away.    As my reader is aware, I left the Finke issuing through an  impracticable gorge in these same ranges, now some seventy-five miles  behind us, and in that distance not a break had occurred in the line  whereby I could either get over or through it, to meet the Finke  again; indeed, at this distance it was doubtful whether it were worth  while to endeavour to do so, as one can never tell what change may  take place, in even the largest of Australian streams, in such a  distance. When last seen, it was trending along a valley under the  foot of the highest of three tiers of hills, and coming from the west;  but whether its sources are in those hills, or that it still runs on  somewhere to the north of us, is the question which I now hope to  solve. I am the more anxious to rediscover the Finke, if it still  exists, because water has been by no means plentiful on the route  along which I have lately been travelling; and I believe a better  country exists upon the other side of the mountains.    At starting, Carmichael and I at first walked across the plain, we  being encamped upon its southern end. It was beautifully grassed, and  had good soil, and it would make an excellent racecourse, or ground  for a kangaroo hunt. We saw numbers of kangaroos, and emus too, but  could get no shots at them. In three miles the plain ended in thick,  indeed very dense, scrub, which continued to the foot of the hills; in  it the grass was long, dry, and tangled with dead and dry burnt sticks  and timber, making it exceedingly difficult to walk through. Reaching  the foot of the hills, I found the natives had recently burnt all the  vegetation from their sides, leaving the stones, of which it was  composed, perfectly bare. It was a long distance to the top of the  first ridge, but the incline was easy, and I was in great hopes, if it  continued so, to be able to get the horses over the mountains at this  spot. Upon arriving at the top of the slope, I was, however,  undeceived upon that score, for we found the high mount, for which we  were steering, completely separated from us by a yawning chasm, which  lay, under an almost sheer precipice, at our feet. The high mountain  beyond, near the crown, was girt around by a solid wall of rock, fifty  or sixty feet in height, from the edge of which the summit rose. It  was quite unapproachable, except, perhaps, in one place, round to the  northward.    The solid rock of which it had formerly been composed had, by some  mighty force of nature, been split into innumerable fissures and  fragments, both perpendicularly and horizontally, and was almost  mathematically divided into pieces or squares, or unequal cubes,  simply placed upon one another, like masons' work without mortar. The  lower strata of these divisions were large, the upper tapered to  pieces not much larger than a brick, at least they seemed so from a  distance. The whole appearance of this singular mount was grand and  awful, and I could not but reflect upon the time when these colossal  ridges were all at once rocking in the convulsive tremblings of some  mighty volcanic shock, which shivered them into the fragments I then  beheld. I said the hill we had ascended ended abruptly in a precipice;  by going farther round we found a spot, which, though practicable, was  difficult enough to descend. At the bottom of some of the ravines  below I could see several small pools of water gleaming in little  stony gullies.    The afternoon had been warm, if not actually hot, and our walking and  climbing had made us thirsty; the sight of water made us all the more  so. It was now nearly sundown, and it would be useless to attempt the  ascent of the mountain, as by the time we could reach its summit, the  sun would be far below the horizon, and we should obtain no view at  all.    It was, however, evident that no gap or pass existed by which I could  get my horses up, even if the country beyond were ever so promising. A  few of the cypress or Australian pines (Callitris) dotted the summits  of the hills, they also grew on the sides of some of the ravines below  us. We had, at least I had, considerable difficulty in descending the  almost perpendicular face to the water below. Carmichael got there  before I did, and had time to sit, laving his feet and legs in a fine  little rock hole full of pure water, filled, I suppose, by the late  rains. The water, indeed, had not yet ceased to run, for it was  trickling from hole to hole. Upon Mr. Carmichael inquiring what  delayed me so long, I replied: \"Ah, it is all very easy for you; you  have two circumstances in your favour. You are young, and therefore  able to climb, and besides, you are in the tropic.\" To which he very  naturally replies, \"If I am in the tropic you must be also.\" I  benignly answer, \"No, you are in the tropic clime of youth.\" While on  the high ground no view of any kind, except along the mountains for a  mile or two east and west, could be obtained. I was greatly  disappointed at having such a toilsome walk for so little purpose. We  returned by a more circuitous route, eventually reaching the camp very  late at night, thoroughly tired out with our walk. I named this  mountain Mount Musgrave. It is nearly 1700 feet above the level of the  surrounding country, and over 3000 feet above the sea. The next day  Mr. Carmichael went out to shoot game; there were kangaroos, and in  the way of birds there were emus, crows, hawks, quail, and  bronze-winged pigeons; but all we got from his expedition was nil. The  horses now being somewhat refreshed by our stay here, we proceeded  across the little plain towards another high bluff hill, which loomed  over the surrounding country to the west-north-west. Flies were  troublesome, and very busy at our eyes; soon after daylight, and  immediately after sunrise, it became quite hot.    Traversing first the racecourse plain, we then entered some mulga  scrub; the mulga is an acacia, the wood extremely hard. It grows to a  height of twenty to thirty feet, but is by no means a shady or even a  pretty tree; it ranges over an enormous extent of Australia. The scrub  we now entered had been recently burnt near the edge of the plain; but  the further we got into it, the worse it became. At seven miles we  came to stones, triodia, and mallee, a low eucalyptus of the gumtree  family, growing generally in thick clumps from one root: its being  rooted close together makes it difficult travelling to force one's way  through. It grows about twenty feet high. The higher grade of  eucalypts or gum-trees delight in water and a good soil, and nearly  always line the banks of watercourses. The eucalypts of the mallee  species thrive in deserts and droughts, but contain water in their  roots which only the native inhabitants of the country can discover. A  white man would die of thirst while digging and fooling around trying  to get the water he might know was preserved by the tree, but not for  him; while an aboriginal, upon the other hand, coming to a  mallee-tree, after perhaps travelling miles through them without  noticing one, will suddenly make an exclamation, look at a tree, go  perhaps ten or twelve feet away, and begin to dig. In a foot or so he  comes upon a root, which he shakes upwards, gradually getting more and  more of it out of the ground, till he comes to the foot of the tree;  he then breaks it off, and has a root perhaps fifteen feet long--this,  by the way, is an extreme length. He breaks the root into sections  about a foot long, ties them into bundles, and stands them up on end  in a receptacle, when they drain out a quantity of beautifully sweet,  pure water. A very long root such as I have mentioned might give  nearly a bucketful of water; but woe to the white man who fancies he  can get water out of mallee. There are a few other trees of different  kinds that water is also got from, as I have known it obtained from  the mulga, acacia trees, and from some casuarina trees; it depends  upon the region they are in, as to what trees give the most if any  water, but it is an aboriginal art at any time or place to find it.    The mallee we found so dense that not a third of the horses could be  seen together, and with great difficulty we managed to reach the foot  of a small pine-clad hill lying under the foot of the high bluff  before mentioned--there a small creek lined with eucalypts ran under  its foot. Though our journey to-day was only twelve miles, that  distance through such horrible scrubs took us many hours. From the top  of the piny hill I could see a watercourse to the south two or three  miles away; it is probably Carmichael's Creek, reformed, after  splitting on the plain behind; Carmichael found a little water-hole up  this channel, with barely sufficient water for our use. The day had  been disagreeably warm. I rode over to the creek to the south, and  found two small puddles in its bed; but there was evidently plenty of  water to be got by digging, as by scratching with my hands I soon  obtained some. The camp which Carmichael and Robinson had selected,  while I rode over to the other creek, was a most wretched place, in  the midst of dense mallee and amidst thick plots of triodia, which we  had to cut away before we could sit down.    The only direction in which we could see a yard ahead of us was up  towards the sky; and as we were not going that way, it gave us no idea  of our next line of route. The big bluff we had been steering for all  day was, I may say, included in our skyward view, for it towered above  us almost overhead. Being away when the camp was selected, I was sorry  to hear that the horses had all been let go without hobbles; as they  had been in such fine quarters for three nights at the last camp "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4975"],[0,"Spinifex and Sand (#15)"],[1,"rings of his  hobble-chain in the broken stump of a bush, so that he was held captive  all night.    The advance of civilisation was marked by the appearance of a small herd  of bullocks, evidently stragglers from \"Hannan's,\" and had we been further  from that place I do not doubt that our desire for fresh beef might have  overcome our conscientious scruples. Virtue, however, was rewarded, for on  awakening one morning I saw advancing towards our camp, with slow and  solemn curiosity, two emus, peering now this way, now that, examining our  packs and other gear with interest and delight. Choosing the younger bird,  I took aim with my Winchester, and dropped him; the report of the rifle  startled my companions from their sleep with the thought that we were  perhaps attacked by the blacks, for emus are even less numerous than they.  But their surprise was not greater than that of the surviving bird, as he  gazed spellbound at his dead mate, whom we found most excellent eating.  Great as the temptation was to have a shot at the remaining bird, I  resisted it, as from the one we could get sufficient meat for our  requirements, and it seemed a shame to take the life, for mere pleasure,  of the only wild creature we had seen for many weeks.    Tiring at length of prospecting reefs, blows, and alluvial with no better  result than an occasional pin's-head of gold, we turned our faces to the  north, passing again the herd of cattle wallowing in the swamps and pans  of rain water.    Clay-pans usually occur in the neighbourhood of salt lakes, and are merely  shallow depressions with smooth clay bottoms. Though as a rule not more  than a few inches to a foot in depth, I have seen them in places holding  four to five feet of water. Immediately after rain all clay-pans are  fresh, before long some will turn salt; those containing drinkable water  are often distinguishable by the growth of cane grass which covers the  bed, a coarse, rush-like grass of no value as food for stock. Dry for  three-quarters of the year, these pans, with their impervious bottoms,  hold the rain, when it fills them, for a considerable period.    Salt-water pans are pellucid and clear, as the inexperienced may find at  his cost. One thirsty day, having tramped many miles horse-hunting,  deceived by a crystal-clear sheet of water, I plunged in my head and  hands, and, before I realised my mistake, took a deep draught with most  unpleasant results. I have been more careful since that catastrophe. An  effective method of clearing muddy clay-pan water is by dropping into it a  sort of powdery gypsum, called \"Kopi\" by the natives, which is usually to  be found round the margin of the salt lakes--a wonderful provision  of Nature, without which the water after a short time would be useless,  becoming as it does red and thick, and of the consistency of strong cocoa.  Amongst the many industries started on the goldfields is the novel  occupation of clearing clay-water for salt. The process was carried out by  means of a series of settling tanks, into which the water was led by  drains, and into the last tank the kopi was thrown; the cleared water was  then bailed into vessels or casks, and carted up to whatever mining camp  was being thus supplied.    Whilst on the subject of industries, I may mention that of obtaining  solder from meat-tins by piling them into large heaps and lighting a fire  over them. The melted lumps of solder thus formed were collected by the  ordinary process of dry-blowing, and sold to tinsmiths and others engaged  in the manufacture of condensers. Certainly the scarcity of water was not  an unmixed curse, for it gave employment to many who would otherwise have  been hard put to it to gain a living. Dam-makers, well-sinkers,  water-carters, tinsmiths, condenser-fitters, wood-cutters, employees on  condensing plants, water-bag makers, caretakers at Government wells, dams,  and soaks, engineers, and many more, all found employment either directly  or indirectly in connection with water supply.    By sinking in the bed of dry clay-pans water can usually be obtained, but  unfortunately it is almost sure to be salt. The difference between  clay-pans before and after rain is most marked. First we have the dry,  hard bed of red clay, blistered and cracked into all manner of patterns by  the sun's heat; around us the stillness of death, nothing astir unless it  be the constant shimmering haze of heat which strikes our faces like the  blast from a furnace. Rain falls, and within a few hours the air will be  filled with the croaking of frogs and the cackling of ducks.* To my mind  it is one of the most incomprehensible things in Nature that wildfowl  (for not only ducks, but sometimes swans and geese are seen) know when and  where rain has fallen.    [* Sir John Forrest, in his exploration of 1874, found ducks, geese, and  swans on Lake Augusta--a salt lake in the arid interior, five hundred  miles from the coast.]    But, stranger still, how do they know it is going to fall? That they would  seem to do so the following will go to show. Whilst we were condensing on  Lake Lapage, one moonlight night we saw a flight of ducks fly over us to  the northward. No surface water then existed anywhere near us. This was on  December 16th. No rain fell in the district until December 25th, but I  ascertained afterwards that rain fell at Lake Carey, one hundred miles  north of Lake Lapage about the same date that we had seen the ducks. The  exact date I am not sure of, but in any case the ducks either foresaw the  rain or knew that rain had fallen at least two hundred miles away; for  they must have come from water (and at that season there was no surface  water within one hundred miles of us) and probably from the coast. In  either case, I think it is an extremely interesting fact, and however they  arrive the ducks are a welcome addition to the prospector's \"tucker-bags.\"          CHAPTER IV        A CAMEL FIGHT      Leaving Hannan's on our left, we continued our northerly course, over flat  country timbered with the usual gum-forest, until we reached the  auriferous country in which our camp had been robbed by the blacks;  nothing of interest occurring until January 17th, when we found ourselves  without water. Knowing that we must soon strike the road from Broad Arrow  to Mount Margaret, this gave us no anxiety, and, beyond the necessity of  travelling without having had a drink for eighteen hours, but little  discomfort.    We struck the road as expected, and, following it some five miles, came to  a small, dry creek running down from a broken range of granite. Sinking in  its bed, we got a plentiful supply. Mosquitoes are very rarely found in  the interior, but on this little creek they swarmed, and could only be  kept away by fires of sticks and grass, in the smoke of which we slept.    From the granite hills a fine view to the eastward was obtained, across a  rich little plain of saltbush and grass, and dotted here and there over it  was a native peach tree, or \"quondong,\" a species of sandalwood. We had  now left the timber behind us, its place being taken by a low, straggling  scrub of acacia, generally known as \"Mulga,\" which continues in almost  unbroken monotony for nearly two hundred miles; the only change in the  landscape is where low cliffs of sandstone and ranges of granite, slate,  or diorite, crop up, from which creeks and watercourses find their way  into salt swamps and lakes; and occasional stretches of plain country.    Through these thickets we held on our course, passing various  watering-places and rocks on the several roads leading to the then popular  field of Mount Margaret.    All such rocks bear names given to them by travellers and diggers, though  one can seldom trace the origin or author of the name, \"Black Gin Soak,\"  \"George Withers' Hole,\" \"The Dead Horse Rocks,\" and the \"Donkey Rocks,\"  are fair samples.    It was at the last named that we had a slight entertainment in the shape  of a camel-fight. On arrival we found another camel-man (i.e., a man who  prospects with camels instead of horses, not necessarily a camel-driver)  in whose train was a large white bull. Misery, with his usual precocity,  at once began to show fight. The owner of the white camel, a gentleman  much given to \"blowing,\" warned me that his bull was the \"strongest in  the ---- country,\" and advised me to keep my camels away. Anxious to see  how Misery would shape in a genuine bout, I paid no heed, but took the  precaution to remove his hobbles, thus placing him on equal terms with his  older and stronger adversary.    Before very long they were at it hammer and tongs, roaring and grunting to  the music of the bells on their necks; wrestling and struggling, using  their great long necks as flails, now one down on his knees and almost  turned over, and now the other, taking every opportunity of doing what  damage they could with their powerful jaws, they formed a strange picture.  Misery was nearly exhausted, and the white bull's master in triumph  shouted, \"Take 'em off, beat 'em off; your ---- camel'll be chewed up!\"  But no! With a last expiring effort, brave little Misery dived his long  neck under the body of his enemy, and grabbed his hind leg by the fetlock,  when a powerful twist turned him over as neatly as could be. It was now  time for us to interfere before the white bull's head was crushed by his  conqueror's knees and breast-bone. With sticks and stones we drove him  off, and the white bull retired abashed--but not more so than his master.    Leaving the rocks in possession of our late adversary we once more plunged  into the scrub, altering our course to the west with the object of  revisiting the country around Mount Ida, where Luck and I had found  colours. Our way lay between salt lakes on our left, and a low terrace or  tableland of what is locally known as \"conglomerate\" on our right. At the  head of a gully running from this"]]]
