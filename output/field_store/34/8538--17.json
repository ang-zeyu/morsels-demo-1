Still they were big marks, and I determined  on doing my best before they had time to wind us; so stepping out,  with the sheikh's boys behind me carrying the second rifle to meet all  emergencies, I planted a ball in the larger one, and brought him round  with a roar and whooh-whooh, exactly to the best position I could wish  for receiving a second shot; but, alas! on turning sharply round for the  spare rifle, I had the mortification to see that both the black boys had  made off, and were scrambling like monkeys up a tree. At the same time  the rhinoceros, fortunately for me, on second consideration turned to  the right-about, and shuffled away, leaving, as is usually the case when  conical bullets are used, no traces of blood.    Thus ended the night's work. We now went home by dawn to apprise all the  porters that we had flesh in store for them, when the two boys who had  so shamelessly deserted me, instead of hiding their heads, described all  the night's scenes with such capital mimicry as to set the whole camp  in a roar. We had all now to hurry back to the carcass before the Wagogo  could find it; but though this precaution was quickly taken, still,  before the tough skin of the beast could be cut through, the Wagogo  began assembling like vultures, and fighting with my men. A more savage,  filthy, disgusting, but at the same time grotesque, scene than that  which followed cannot be conceived. All fell to work armed with swords,  spears, knives, and hatchets--cutting and slashing, thumping and  bawling, fighting and tearing, tumbling and wrestling up to their knees  in filth and blood in the middle of the carcass. When a tempting morsel  fell to the possession of any one, a stronger neighbour would seize and  bear off the prize in triumph. All right was now a matter or pure might,  and lucky it was that it did not end in a fight between our men and  the villagers. These might be afterwards seen, one by one, covered with  blood, scampering home each with his spoil--a piece of tripe, or liver,  or lights, or whatever else it might have been his fortune to get off  with.    We were still in great want of men; but rather than stop a day, as all  delays only lead to more difficulties, I pushed on to Magomba's palace  with the assistance of some Wagogo carrying our baggage, each taking one  cloth as his hire. The chief wazir at once come out to meet me on the  way, and in an apparently affable manner, as an old friend, begged that  I would live in the palace--a bait which I did not take, as I knew  my friend by experience a little too well. He then, in the politest  possible manner, told me that a great dearth of food was oppressing the  land--so much so, that pretty cloths only would purchase grain. I now  wished to settle my hongo, but the great chief could not hear of such  indecent haste.    The next day, too, the chief was too drunk to listen to any one, and I  must have patience. I took out this time in the jungles very profitably,  killing a fine buck and doe antelope, of a species unknown. These  animals are much about the same size and shape as the common Indian  antelope, and, like them, roam about in large herds. The only marked  difference between the two is in the shape of their horns, as may be  seen by the woodcut; and in their colour, in which, in both sexes, the  Ugogo antelopes resemble the picticandata gazelle of Tibet, except that  the former have dark markings on the face.    At last, after thousands of difficulties much like those I encountered  in Uzaramo, the hongo was settled by a payment of one kisutu, one  dubani, four yards bendera, four yards kiniki, and three yards merikani.  The wazir then thought he would do some business on his own account, and  commenced work by presenting me with a pot of ghee and flour, saying at  the same time \"empty words did not show true love,\" and hoping that I  would prove mine by making some slight return. To get rid of the animal  I gave him the full value of his present in cloth, which he no sooner  pocketed than he had the audacity to accuse Grant of sacrilege for  having shot a lizard on a holy stone, and demanded four cloths to pay  atonement for this offence against the \"church.\" As yet, he said, the  chief was not aware of the damage done, and it was well he was not; for  he would himself, if I only paid him the four cloths, settle matters  quietly, otherwise there would be no knowing what demands might be made  on my cloth. It was necessary to get up hot temper, else there was no  knowing how far he would go; so I returned him his presents, and told  the sheikh, instead of giving four, to fling six cloths in his face, and  tell him that the holy-stone story was merely a humbug, and I would take  care no more white men ever came to see him again.    Some Wanyamuezi porters, who had been left sick here by former caravans,  now wished to take service with me as far as Kaze; but the Wagogo,  hearing of their desire, frightened them off it. A report also at this  time was brought to us, that a caravan had just arrived at our last  ground, having come up from Whindi, direct by the line of the Wami  river, in its upper course called Mukondokua, without crossing a single  hill all the way; I therefore sent three men to see if they had any  porters to spare, as it was said they had; but the three men, although  they left their bows and arrows behind, never came back.    Another mule died to-day. This was perplexing indeed, but to stop longer  was useless; so we pushed forward as best we could to a pond at the  western end of the district where we found a party of Makua sportsmen  who had just killed an elephant. They had lived in Ugogo one year and  a half, and had killed in all seventeen elephants; half the tusks of  which, as well as some portion of the flesh, they gave to Magomba for  the privilege of residing there. There were many antelopes there, some  of which both Grant and I shot for the good of the pot, and he also  killed a crocute hyena. From the pond we went on to the middle of a  large jungle, and bivouacked for the night in a shower of rain, the  second of the season.    During a fierce downpour of rain, the porters all quivering and quaking  with cold, we at length emerged from the jungle, and entered the  prettiest spot in Ugogo--the populous district of Usekhe--where little  hills and huge columns of granite crop out. Here we halted.    Next day came the hongo business, which was settled by paying one  dubani, one kitambi, one msutu, four yards merikani, and two yards  kiniki; but whilst we were doing it eight porters ran away, and four  fresh ones were engaged (Wanyamuezi) who had run away from Kanyenye.    With one more march from this we reached the last district in Ugogo,  Khoko. Here the whole of the inhabitants turned out to oppose us,  imagining we had come there to revenge the Arab, Mohinna, because the  Wagogo attacked him a year ago, plundered his camp, and drove him back  to Kaze, for having shot their old chief \"Short-legs.\" They, however, no  sooner found out who we were than they allowed us to pass on, and encamp  in the outskirts of the Mgunda Mkhali wilderness. To this position in  the bush I strongly objected, on the plea that guns could be best  used against arrows in the open; but none would go out in the field,  maintaining that the Wagogo would fear to attack us so far from their  villages, as we now were, lest we might cut them off in their retreat.    Hori Hori was now chief in Short-leg's stead, and affected to be much  pleased that we were English, and not Arabs. He told us we might, he  thought, be able to recruit all the men that we were in want of, as many  Wanyanuezi who had been left there sick wished to go to their homes;  and I would only, in addition to their wages, have to pay their \"hotel  bills\" to the Wagogo. This, of course, I was ready to do, though I knew  the Wanyamuezi had paid for themselves, as is usual, by their work in  the fields of their hosts. Still, as I should be depriving these of  hands, I could scarcely expect to get off for less than the value of a  slave for each, and told Sheikh said to look out for some men at once,  whilst at the same time he laid in provisions of grain to last us eight  days in the wilderness, and settle the hongo.    For this triple business, I allowed three days, during which time,  always eager to shoot something, either for science or the pot, I killed  a bicornis rhinoceros, at a distance of five paces only, with my small  40-gauge Lancaster, as the beast stood quietly feeding in the bush; and  I also shot a bitch fox of the genus Octocyon lalandii, whose ill-omened  cry often alarms the natives by forewarning them of danger. This was  rather tame sport; but next day I had better fun.    Starting in the early morning, accompanied by two of Sheikh Said's boys,  Suliman and Faraj, each carrying a rifle, while I carried a shot-gun, we  followed a footpath to the westward in the wilderness of Mgunda Mkhali.  There, after walking a short while in the bush, as I heard the grunt  of a buffalo close on my left, I took \"Blissett\" in hand, and walked  to where I soon espied a large herd quietly feeding. They were quite  unconscious of my approach, so I took a shot at a cow, and wounded her;  then, after reloading, put a ball in a bull and staggered him also. This  caused great confusion among them; but as none of the animals knew where  the shots came from, they simply shifted about in a fidgety manner,  allowing me to kill the first cow, and even fire a fourth shot, which  sickened the great bull, and induced him to walk off, leaving the herd  to their fate, who, considerably puzzled, began moving off also.    I now called up the boys, and determined on following the herd down  before either skinning the dead cow or following the bull,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3287"],[0,"The Man from Glengarry: A Tale of the Ottawa (#15)"],[1,"first thing you do with the sap,\" he said.    \"How? Carry every trough to the kettle?\"    \"Oh, I see,\" laughed Ranald. \"You must have every step.\"    \"Yes, indeed,\" she replied, with determination.    \"Well, here it is.\"    He seized a bucket, went to another tree, emptied the sap from the  trough into the bucket, and thence into the barrel, and from the barrel  into the big kettle.    \"Then from the big kettle into the little one,\" he said, catching up a  big dipper tied to a long pole, and transferring the boiling sap as he  spoke from one kettle to another.    \"But how can you tell when it is ready?\" asked Mrs. Murray.    \"Only by tasting. When it is very sweet it must go into the little  kettle.\"    \"And then?\"    Her eager determination to know all the details delighted him beyond  measure.    \"Then you must be very careful indeed, or you will lose all your day's  work, and your sugar besides, for it is very easy to burn.\"    \"But how can you tell when it is ready?\"    \"Oh, you must just keep tasting every few minutes till you think you  have the syrup, and then for the sugar you must just boil it a little  longer.\"    \"Well,\" said Mrs. Murray, \"when it is ready what do you do?\"    \"Then,\" he said, \"you must quickly knock the fire from under it, and  pour it into the pans, stirring it till it gets nearly cool.\"    \"And why do you stir it?\" she asked.    \"Oh, to keep it from getting too hard.\"    \"Now I have learned something I never knew before,\" said the minister's  wife, delightedly, \"and I am very grateful to you. We must help each  other, Ranald.\"    \"Indeed, it is little I can do for you,\" he said, shyly.    \"You do not know how much I am going to ask you to do,\" she said,  lightly. \"Wait and see.\"    At that moment a series of shrieks rose high above the shouting and  laughter of the games, and Maimie came flying down toward the camp,  pursued by Don, with the others following.    \"Oh, auntie!\" she panted, \"he's going to--going to--\" she paused, with  cheeks burning.    \"It's forfeits, Mrs. Murray,\" explained Don.    \"Hoot, lassie,\" said Mrs. Cameron; \"it will not much hurt you, anyway.  They that kiss in the light will not kiss in the dark.\"    \"She played, and lost her forfeit,\" said Don, unwilling to be jeered at  by the others for faint-heartedness. \"She ought to pay.\"    \"I'm afraid, Don, she does not understand our ways,\" said Mrs. Murray,  apologetically.    \"Be off, Don,\" said his mother. \"Kiss Marget there, if you can--it will  not hurt her--and leave the young lady alone.\"    \"It's just horrid of them, auntie,\" said Maimie, indignantly, as the  others went back to their games.    \"Indeed,\" said Mrs. Cameron, warmly, \"if you will never do worse than  kiss a laddie in a game, it's little harm will be coming to you.\"    But Maimie ignored her.    \"Is it not horrid, auntie?\" she said.    \"Well, my dear, if you think so, it is. But not for these girls, who  play the game with never a thought of impropriety and with no shock to  their modesty. Much depends on how you think about these things.\"    But Maimie was not satisfied. She was indignant at Don for offering  to kiss her, but as she stood and watched the games going on under the  trees--the tag, the chase, the catch, and the kiss--she somehow began to  feel as if it were not so terrible after all, and to think that perhaps  these girls might play the game and still be nice enough. But she had  no thought of going back to them, and so she turned her attention to  the preparations for tea, now almost complete. Her aunt and Ranald were  toasting slices of bread at the big blazing fire, on forks made out of  long switches.    \"Let me try, auntie,\" she said, pushing up to the fire between her aunt  and Ranald. \"I am sure I can do that.\"    \"Be careful of that fire,\" said Ranald, sharply, pulling back her skirt,  that had blown dangerously near the blaze. \"Stand back further,\" he  commanded.    Mamie looked at him, surprise, indignation, and fear struggling for the  mastery. Was this the awkward boy that had blushed and stammered before  her a week ago?    \"It's very dangerous,\" he explained to Mrs. Murray, \"the wind blows out  the flames.\"    As he spoke he handed Maimie his toasting stick and retired to the other  side of the fire, and began to attend to the boiling sap.    \"He needn't be such a bear,\" pouted Maimie.    \"My dear,\" replied her aunt, \"what Ranald says is quite true. You cannot  be too careful in moving about the fire.\"    \"Well, he needn't be so cross about it,\" said Maimie. She had never been  ordered about before in her life, and she did not enjoy the experience,  and all the more at the hands of an uncouth country boy. She watched  Ranald attending to the fire and the kettles, however, with a new  respect. He certainly had no fear of the fire, but moved about it and  handled it with the utmost sang-froid. He had a certain grace, too, in  his movements that caught her eye, and she wished he would come nearer  so that she could speak to him. She had considerable confidence in her  powers of attraction. As if to answer her wish, Ranald came straight to  where her aunt and she were standing.    \"I think it will be time for tea now,\" he said, with a sudden return of  his awkward manner, that made Maimie wonder why she had ever been afraid  of him. \"I will tell Don,\" he added, striding off toward the group of  boys and girls, still busy with their games under the trees.    Soon Don's shout was heard: \"Tea, ladies and gentlemen; take your seats  at the tables.\" And speedily there was a rush and scramble, and in a few  moments the great heaps of green balsam boughs arranged around the fire  were full of boys and girls pulling, pinching, and tumbling over one  another in wild glee.    The toast stood in brown heaps on birch-bark plates beside the fire, and  baskets were carried out of the shanty bulging with cakes; the tea  was bubbling in the big tin tea-pail, and everything was ready for the  feast. But Ranald had caught Mrs. Murray's eye, and at a sign from her,  stood waiting with the tea-pail in his hand.    \"Come on with the tea, Ranald,\" cried Don, seizing a plate of toast.    \"Wait a minute, Don,\" said Ranald, in a low tone.    \"What's the matter?\"    But Ranald stood still, looking silently at the minister's wife. Then,  as all eyes turned toward her, she said, in a gentle, sweet voice,  \"I think we ought to give thanks to our Father in heaven for all this  beauty about us and for all our joy.\"    At once Ranald took off his hat, and as the boys followed his example,  Mrs. Murray bowed her head and in a few, simple words lifted up the  hearts of all with her own in thanksgiving for the beauty of the woods  and sky above them, and all the many gifts that came to fill their lives  with joy.    It was not the first time that Ranald had heard her voice in prayer, but  somehow it sounded different in the open air under the trees and in the  midst of all the jollity of the sugaring-off. With all other people  that Ranald knew religion seemed to be something apart from common days,  common people, and common things, and seemed, besides, a solemn and  terrible experience; but with the minister's wife, religion was a part  of her every-day living, and seemed to be as easily associated with her  pleasure as with anything else about her. It was so easy, so simple, so  natural, that Ranald could not help wondering if, after all, it was the  right kind. It was so unlike the religion of the elders and all the good  people in the congregation. It was a great puzzle to Ranald, as to many  others, both before and since his time.    After tea was over the great business of the evening came on. Ranald  announced that the taffy was ready, and Don, as master of ceremonies,  immediately cried out: \"The gentlemen will provide the ladies with  plates.\"    \"Plates!\" echoed the boys, with a laugh of derision.    \"Plates,\" repeated Don, stepping back to a great snowbank, near a balsam  clump, and returning with a piece of \"crust.\" At once there was a scurry  to the snowbank, and soon every one had a snow plate ready. Then Ranald  and Don slid the little kettle along the pole off the fire, and with  tin dippers began to pour the hot syrup upon the snow plates, where it  immediately hardened into taffy. Then the pulling began. What fun there  was, what larks, what shrieks, what romping and tumbling, till all were  heartily tired, both of the taffy and the fun.    Then followed the sugar-molding. The little kettle was set back on the  fire and kept carefully stirred, while tin dishes of all sorts, shapes,  and sizes--milk-pans, pattie-pans, mugs, and cups--well greased with  pork rind, were set out in order, imbedded in snow.    The last act of all was the making of \"hens' nests.\" A dozen or so of  hens' eggs, blown empty, and three goose eggs for the grown-ups, were  set in snow nests, and carefully filled from the little kettle. In a few  minutes the nests were filled with sugar eggs, and the sugaring-off was  over.    There remained still a goose egg provided against any mishap.    \"Who wants the goose egg?\" cried Don, holding it up.    \"Me!\" \"me!\" \"me!\" coaxed the girls on every side.    \"Will you give it to me, Don, for the minister?\" said Mrs. Murray.    \"Oh, yes!\" cried Maimie, \"and let me fill it.\"    As she spoke, she seized the dipper, and ran for the kettle.    \"Look out for that fire,\" cried Don, dropping the egg into its snowbed.  He was too late. A little tongue of flame leaped out from under the  kettle, nipped hold of her frock, and in a moment she was in a blaze.  With a wild scream she sprang back and turned to fly, but before she had  gone more than a single step Ranald, dashing the crowd right and left,  had seized and flung her headlong into the snow, beating out the flames  with his bare hands. In a moment all danger was over, and Ranald lifted  her up. Still screaming, she clung to him, while the women all ran to  her. Her aunt"]]]
