Stud., 13:128, 1940.         Boca de Apiza (2); Playa Azul (2).    The crocodile or \"caiman\" is abundant in the brackish lagoons along the  cost of Michoacan; three large adults and several juveniles were  observed at Estero Pichi at Playa Azul; others were seen at Mexiquillo  and Maruata. Residents of the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin frequently have  reported \"caimanes\" in the Rio Balsas and Rio Tepalcatepec, but the  existence of the crocodile in these rivers has not been verified by  specimens.      Sauria      ~Phyllodactylus duellmani~ Dixon         _Phyllodactylus duellmani_ Dixon, Southwest Nat., 5:37,       April 15, 1960.--Rancho El Espinal, Michoacan, Mexico.         Fourteen km. SSW of Apatzingan; Capirio; Cafradia (3); El       Espinal (3).    This species is known only from the Tepalcatepec Valley, where it has  been found in open arid situations from 180 to 500 meters. Specimens  were found in the daytime in stumps, dead cacti, and the hollow branches  of the legume, _Apoplanesia paniculata_. In life adults were pale gray  or grayish tan above and creamy white below. A juvenile having a  snout-vent length of 18 mm. had a pale orange tail with gray  cross-bands. In the adults the tail was colored like the body. The  specimen from 14 kilometers south-southwest of Apatzingan (KU 29764) and  those from Cofradia (BMNH 1914.1.28.28-30) were not listed by Dixon  (1960).      ~Phyllodactylus homolepidurus~ Smith         _Phyllodactylus homolepidurus_ Smith, Univ. Kansas Sci.       Bull., 22:121, November 15, 1935.--Five miles southwest of       Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico.         El Ticuiz (2); La Placita; Ostula (2); Pomaro; San Pedro       Naranjestila.    These specimens have been referred to _Phyllodactylus homolepidurus_ by  James R. Dixon (_in litt._), who is currently studying the American  members of the genus. Geckos of this species have been found in tropical  semi-deciduous forest in the coastal lowlands to elevations of 500  meters. Most specimens were found beneath the bark of standing dead  trees or stumps. Two individuals from El Ticuiz (UMMZ 115102) in life  were dark gray above with brownish tubercles; the belly was a dusty  cream-color. Apparently this species does not enter the Tepalcatepec  Valley, where _Phyllodactylus lanei_ is abundant.      ~Phyllodactylus lanei~ Smith         _Phyllodactylus lanei_ Smith, Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull.,       22:125, November 15, 1935.--Tierra Colorado, Guerrero,       Mexico.         Apatzingan (13); 21 km. S of Arteaga: El Sabino (53); La       Playa; Ostula (2); Rio Marquez, 10 km. S of Lombardia (8);       16 km. N of Tafetan.    This widespread species has been taken at elevations of less than 1100  meters in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin, where it occurs in riparian  situations in the foothills. Specimens have been collected in tropical  semi-deciduous forest at Ostula and in oak forest south of Arteaga; both  of these localities are on the Pacific slopes of the Sierra de  Coalcoman, a region inhabited by _Phyllodactylus homolepidurus_. Both  species have been collected at Ostula.    A juvenile from 21 kilometers south of Arteaga (UMMZ 118933) had  alternating black and white bands on the tail. In life most of the  lizards are dull ashy gray or grayish tan above and white below.  According to Dixon (_in litt._), one specimen from Apatzingan (UMMZ  115102) resembles _Phyllodactylus magnus_ in scutellation, but it lacks  the distinctive yellow venter of that species.    Apparently _Phyllodactylus lanei_ is restricted to rather mesic  environments in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Valley and surrounding  foothills; in the more open arid environments on the floor of the valley  it seems to be replaced by _Phyllodactylus duellmani_.      ~Phyllodactylus paucituberculatus~ Dixon         _Phyllodactylus paucituberculatus_ Dixon, Southwest. Nat.,       5:40, April 15, 1960.--Rio Cupatitzio (= Rio Marquez), 6.5       miles south of Lombardia, Michoacan, Mexico.         Rio Marquez, 10 km. S of Lombardia (6).    Two of these specimens (UMMZ 112692-3) were discussed in detail by Dixon  (1960:40) in his description of the species. On August 25, 1960, Dixon  collected four additional specimens at the type locality, a conglomerate  cliff along the Rio Marquez. These will be reported by him in his  forthcoming study of the genus.      ~Anolis dunni~ Smith         _Anolis dunni_ Smith, Copeia, no. 1:9, May 10, 1936.--Agua       del Obispo, Guerrero, Mexico.         Arteaga (3); 19 km. S of Arteaga.    Three females from Arteaga (UMMZ 119075) have snout-vent lengths of 41,  41, and 44 mm. In life the pale grayish brown dorsum was marked with  dark brown; the belly was white, and the throat was pale pink. All have  a dark interorbital bar and dark vertical bars on the upper labials. In  two specimens there are only scattered dark flecks on the dorsum; in the  third there is a dark postorbital stripe, a dark lateral stripe, and  four narrow transverse bands on the body. A male from 19 kilometers  south of Arteaga (UMMZ 119076) having a snout-vent length of 49 mm. had  in life a tan dorsum, a broad white stripe from the ear to the groin,  scattered small white spots on the dorsum, and indistinct pale  cream-colored spots on the posterior surfaces of the thighs. This male  has the dark labial bars, but lacks the dark interorbital bar, found in  the females. The large rose-pink throat fan extends to about the middle  of the belly. In all of the specimens the middorsal scales are keeled  and much smaller than the smooth pavementlike or slightly imbricate  ventrals. All have two gulars in contact with the mental, five scales  between the nasals, five scales (not including the first labials) in  contact with the rostral, and four rows of loreals. In these characters  these specimens agree well with _Anolis dunni_ from Guerrero, as  diagnosed by Davis (1954b).    Previously _Anolis dunni_ has been reported only from the vicinity of  Agua del Obispo, Guerrero, a locality situated at an elevation of about  900 meters in pine-oak forest in the Sierra del Sur. All known close  relatives of _Anolis dunni_ occur only in Guerrero: _A. taylori_ Smith  and Spieler from Acapulco, _A. gadowi_ Boulenger from Tierra Colorado,  _A. liogaster_ Boulenger, and _A. omiltemanus_ Davis from Omiltemi. The  present specimens from elevations of about 900 meters in riparian stream  vegetation and oak forest represent the northern known limits of this  group of _Anolis_.      ~Anolis nebulosus~ (Wiegmann)         _Dactyloa nebulosa_ Wiegmann, Herpetologia Mexicana, p. 47,       1834.--Mexico. Type locality restricted to Mazatlan,       Sinaloa, Mexico, by Smith and Taylor (1950b:66).         _Anolis nebulosas_, Bocourt, Mission Scientifique au Mexique       et dan l'Amerique Centrale.

Even with the abundance of material the assignment of a specific name to  these anoles is only tentative, for definite determination between  _Anolis nebulosus_ Wiegmann and _A. nebuloides_ Bocourt is uncertain.  Bocourt (1873:75) distinguished _A. nebuloides_ from _A. nebulosus_ by  the following characters: (1) head scales keeled, not smooth; (2) snout  narrower; (3) ear opening larger; (4) supraorbital semicircles separated  by a row of small scales and not in contact; (5) dorsal scales larger  and subequal in size to the belly scales. Boulenger (1885:77) used the  same characters; Smith and Taylor (1950b:58) in their key to the Mexican  species of _Anolis_ stated that the dorsal scales are slightly smaller  than the ventrals in _A. nebulosus_ and markedly smaller in _A.  nebuloides_. Smith (_in litt._) stated that the characters of the  relative sizes of the dorsal and ventral scales were incorrect in that  key.    The application of the above criteria to specimens from Michoacan has  not resulted in the recognition of two species. The majority of the  specimens have the supraorbital semicircles separated by at least one  small scale; the head scales, with the exception of those on the snout  in a few individuals, are smooth; the dorsal scales are only slightly  smaller than the ventrals. In other characters of scutellation the  specimens are highly variable. The males in life have an orange throat  fan. Anoles of this kind have been found in Michoacan, Colima, Jalisco,  Nayarit, and southern Sinaloa. Near Oaxaca, Oaxaca, specimens were  collected that superficially resemble those from Michoacan and farther  north. These have low keels on the snout scales, dorsals somewhat larger  than the ventrals, and a pink throat fan. In ten males from Oaxaca the  size of the dorsal scales relative to that of the ventrals is 1.00:0.83;  the same ratio for 25 males from Michoacan is 1.00:1.08. In both samples  there are specimens in which the dorsal and ventral scales are about  equal in size.    Investigations by Richard E. Etheridge on the osteology of _Anolis_,  including those species here being considered, have revealed relatively  constant differences in the parasternalia"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33619"],[0,"Maori and Settler: A Story of The New Zealand War (#15)"],[1,"to the west of north, for I knew that when it  began our position was, as near as may be, due north of them. I guessed  what you were thinking of when you told the man at the wheel to edge  away to the east as much as he dared, though that was mighty little.\"    \"By my reckoning,\" the captain said, \"we could not have passed more than  thirty miles to the east of them. We have made about eighty miles of  westing since we got on our course, and we are now just on the longitude  of the westermost point of the islands. They are about a hundred miles  to the north of us.\"    The wind continued from the same quarter, and on taking his observation  on the following day the captain announced that if there were no change  he reckoned upon just making the mouth of the Straits between Tierra del  Fuego and the islands. On going on deck two mornings later land was seen  on the port bow.    \"There is Cape Horn,\" the captain said; \"that lofty peak covered with  snow. The island nearest to us is Herschel Island. The large island not  far from the Horn is Wollaston Island. As you see, there are several  others. It is not the sort of place one would like to come down upon in  a gale, and if I had had my choice I would rather have gone a hundred  miles south of the Horn. But the wind would not allow us to lie that  course, and after the gale we had the other day we have a right to  reckon upon finer weather, and in light winds it might have taken us  another two or three days beating round.\"    \"The wind is very light now,\" Mr. Renshaw remarked.    \"Yes, and I am afraid it will be lighter still presently,\" the captain  said.    The vessel made but slow way, and in the afternoon the wind dropped  altogether. The _Flying Scud_ was now two or three miles from the coast  of Tierra del Fuego, and the passengers examined the inhospitable-looking  coast through their glasses. At one or two points light wreaths of smoke  were seen curling up, telling of encampments of the natives.    \"I think, Mr. Ryan,\" the captain said, \"I will take her in and anchor in  one of the bays This breath of air might be enough to move her through  the water if she were going free, but it is nearly dead ahead of us now.  I do not like the idea of drifting all night along this coast. Besides,  we may be able to get some fish from the natives, which will be a change  for the passengers.\"    The vessel's head was turned towards the shore, and now that the light  air was well on the beam it sufficed to enable the vessel to steal  through the water at the rate of about a knot an hour. At about four  o'clock the anchor was dropped in a bay at a distance of half a mile  from land, the sails were furled, and the passengers watched the shores  in hopes that some native craft might make its appearance; but there was  no sign of life.    \"Either the natives have no fish to sell, or rather exchange,\" the  captain said, \"for, of course, money is of no use to them, or they are  afraid of us. Maybe they have been massacring some shipwrecked crew, and  believe we are a ship-of-war come down to punish them. At any rate, they  seem determined not to show.\"    The next morning the sea was as smooth as glass, and there was not a  breath of air.    \"Would you let us have a boat, captain?\" Mr. Atherton asked. \"It will  make a pleasant change, and perhaps some of the natives might come off  and sell us fish, as they would not be afraid of us as they might be of  the ship.\"    \"Yes, if you like to make up a party, Mr. Atherton, you can have a boat;  but you must not land. The natives are very treacherous, and it would  not be safe to set foot on shore. Mr. Ryan, will you get the cutter into  the water after breakfast? You had better take with you two or three  muskets. I do not think there is any fear of an attack, and besides you  could out-row the native craft, still it is always as well to be  prepared.\"    Mr. Atherton soon made up his party. Wilfrid and the two Allens were  delighted at the offer, and Marion and the Miss Mitfords also petitioned  to be allowed to go, although Mr. Atherton had not intended to take  ladies with him. Two other young men named Hardy and Wilson were also  invited to join, and this made up the complement that the cutter could  carry in comfort. The crew consisted of six sailors at the oars, and Mr.  Ryan himself took the helm.    \"You had better wrap up well,\" Mr. Atherton said to the girls, \"for you  will find it cold sitting in a boat. The thermometer must be down near  freezing-point.\"    Mr. Atherton was the last to take his seat, and he brought with him his  rifle.    \"Why, what are you going to shoot, Mr. Atherton?\" Marion asked.    \"I do not know that I am going to shoot anything,\" he replied; \"but it  is always well to be prepared. You see I have made preparations in other  ways,\" he added as the steward handed him down a large basket, which he  placed in the stern-sheets.    \"But we are only going for an hour or two, Mr. Atherton,\" Wilfrid  remarked. \"We cannot want anything to eat when we have only just  finished breakfast.\"    \"I do not think it at all likely we shall want to open the hamper,  Wilfrid; but you see it is always best to be prepared. The weather looks  perfectly settled, but, like the natives of these parts, it is  treacherous. As I proposed this expedition I feel a sort of  responsibility, and have therefore, you see, taken precautions against  every contingency.\"    \"I do not think there is any chance of a change,\" Mr. Ryan said. \"It  looks as if the calm might last for a week. Still, one can never be  wrong in preparing for the worst. Besides, this cold weather gives one a  wonderful appetite, and a drop of the cratur never comes amiss.\"    By this time the boat was fairly away from the ship, and the sailors,  who like the passengers regarded the expedition as a pleasant change,  stretched out to their oars. The mate steered for the headland to the  west, and after passing it kept the boat at a distance of a few hundred  yards from the shore.    \"Is there any current here, Mr. Ryan?\" Wilfrid asked as he watched the  rocks and low stunted trees.    \"Very little,\" the mate replied. \"Sometimes it runs very strongly here,  but at present it is not much to speak of. I do not think it was running  more than a quarter of a mile an hour past the ship, but no doubt there  is a good deal more farther out.\"    To the disappointment of those on board there were no signs of natives.    \"It will be very tiresome if they do not come out,\" Marion said. \"I want  to see a real cannibal.\"    \"I do not so much care about the cannibals, Miss Renshaw, but I want to  see their fish. I have not tasted a really decent fish since I left  England; but in these cold waters they ought to be as good as they are  at home. I believe the natives catch them by spearing them by  torch-light, and in that case they ought to be good-sized fellows.\" The  men after the first start had dropped into a long, steady stroke, and as  the boat glided along past bay and headland no one paid any attention to  time, until the mate, looking at his watch, said:    \"Faith, we have been gone an hour and a half; I clean forgot all about  time. I think we had better be turning. It will be dinner-time before we  reach the ship as it is.\" The boat's head was turned. \"I think,\" the  mate went on, \"we may as well steer from headland to headland, instead  of keeping round the bays. It will save a good bit of distance, and the  natives evidently do not mean to show themselves.\"    \"They are very provoking,\" Miss Mitford said. \"I can see smoke among the  trees over there, and I have no doubt that they are watching us although  we cannot see them.\"    \"You ought to have waved your handkerchief as we came along, Miss  Mitford,\" James Allen remarked; \"or to have stood up and shown  yourselves. They would no doubt have come off then and offered presents  in token of admiration.\"    The girls laughed. \"I do not suppose they would appreciate our charms,\"  Miss Mitford said. \"They are not in their line, you see.\"    \"That they certainly are not, Miss Mitford,\" the mate laughed. \"I saw  some of them the last time I came through here, and hideous-looking  creatures they are, and wear no clothes to speak of.\"    So laughing and chatting with their eyes fixed on the shore the party  never looked seaward, until a sudden exclamation from the mate called  their attention to that direction.    \"Be Jabers!\" he exclaimed, \"here is a sea-fog rolling down on us from  the south!\"    They looked and saw what seemed like a wall of white smoke rolling along  the water towards them. At this moment the boat was about half-way  between two headlands, which were a mile and a half apart, and the shore  abreast of it was three-quarters of a mile distant. The sun was shining  brightly upon the rolling mist, and the girls uttered an exclamation of  admiration.    \"How fast it comes!\" Marion said. \"Why, it will be here directly!\"    The mate put the tiller a-starboard. \"Row, men!\" he said in a sharp  voice; for they had for a moment ceased to pull.    \"Have you a compass?\" Mr. Atherton asked in low tones.    The mate shook his head. \"I am no better than an idiot to have come  without one,\" he said. \"But who could have dreamt we should want it?\"    A minute later a light wreath of mist crossed the boat, and almost  immediately the great fog-bank rolled over it. An exclamation broke  from several of those on board. So sudden was the change of temperature  that it seemed as if an icy hand had been laid upon them.    \"It is fortunate that we are not far from shore,\" Mr. Atherton said to  the mate. \"There is nothing for it but to coast along close in.\"    \"That is the only thing to do,\" Mr. Ryan replied. \"But it will be an  awkward business; for, as we noticed when we came along, the shore is in  many places studded with rocks. However, we must risk that, and by going  on slowly and carefully we may get off with"]]]
