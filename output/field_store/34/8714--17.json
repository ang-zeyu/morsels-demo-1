As master and man we  performed the pilgrimage together; but, on my return to Egypt after the  pilgrimage, Shaykh (become Haji) Nur, finding me to be a Sahib,[FN#25]  changed for the worse. He would not work, and reserved all his energy  for the purpose of pilfering, which he practised so audaciously upon my  friends, as well as upon myself, that he could not be kept in the house.    Perhaps the reader may be curious to see the necessary expenses of a  bachelor residing at Cairo. He must observe, however, in the following  list that I was not a strict economist, and, besides that, I was a  stranger in the country: inhabitants and old settlers would live as  well for little more than two-thirds the sum.

[p.66]In these days who at Cairo without a Shaykh? I thought it right  to conform to popular custom, and accordingly, after having secured a  servant, my efforts were directed to finding a teacher; the pretext  being that as an Indian doctor I wanted to read Arabic works on  medicine, as well as to perfect myself in divinity and  pronunciation.[FN#26] My theological studies were in the Shafe'i school  for two reasons: in the first place, it is the least rigorous of the  Four Orthodox, and, secondly, it most resembles the Shi'ah heresy, with  which long intercourse    [p.67]with Persians had made me familiar.[FN#27] My choice of doctrine,  however, confirmed those around me in their conviction that I was a  rank heretic, for the 'Ajami, taught by his religion to conceal  offensive tenets[FN#28] in lands where the open expression would be  dangerous, always represents himself to be a Shafe'i. This, together  with the original mistake of appearing publicly at Alexandria as a  \"Mirza\" in a Persian dress, caused me infinite small annoyance at  Cairo, in spite of all precautions and contrivances. And throughout my  journey, even in Arabia, though I drew my knife every time an offensive  hint was thrown out, the ill-fame clung to me like the shirt of Nessus.    It was not long before I happened to hit upon a proper teacher, in the  person of Shaykh Mohammed al-Attar, or the \"Druggist.\" He had known  prosperity, having once been a Khatib (preacher) in one of Mohammed  Ali's mosques. But His Highness the late Pasha had dismissed him, which  disastrous event, with its subsequent train of misfortunes, he dates  from the melancholy day when he took to himself a wife. He talks of her  abroad as a stern and rigid master dealing with a naughty slave,  though, by the look that accompanies his rhodomontade, I am convinced  that at home he is the very model of \"managed men.\" His dismissal was  the reason that compelled him to fall back upon the trade of a  druggist, the refuge for the once wealthy, though now destitute, Sages  of Egypt.    His little shop in the Jamaliyah Quarter is a perfect gem of Nilotic  queerness. A hole, about five feet long    [p.68]and six deep, pierced in the wall of some house, it is divided  into two compartments separated by a thin partition of wood, and  communicating by a kind of arch cut in the boards. The inner box, germ  of a back parlour, acts as store-room, as the pile of empty old baskets  tossed in dusty confusion upon the dirty floor shows. In the front is  displayed the stock in trade, a matting full of Persian tobacco and  pipe-bowls of red clay, a palm-leaf bag containing vile coffee and  large lumps of coarse, whity-brown sugar wrapped up in browner paper.  On the shelves and ledges are rows of well-thumbed wooden boxes,  labelled with the greatest carelessness, pepper for rhubarb, arsenic  for Tafl, or wash-clay, and sulphate of iron where sal-ammoniac should  be. There is also a square case containing, under lock and key, small  change and some choice articles of commerce, damaged perfumes, bad  antimony for the eyes, and pernicious rouge. And dangling close above  it is a rusty pair of scales, ill poised enough for Egyptian Themis  herself to use. To hooks over the shop-front are suspended reeds for  pipes, tallow candles, dirty wax tapers and cigarette paper; instead of  plate-glass windows and brass-handled doors, a ragged net keeps away  the flies when the master is in, and the thieves when he goes out to  recite in the Hasanayn Mosque his daily chapter \"Ya Sin.[FN#29]\" A  wooden shutter which closes down at night-time, and by day two  palm-stick stools intensely dirty and full of fleas, occupying the  place of the Mastabah or earthen bench,[FN#30] which accommodated  purchasers, complete the furniture of my preceptor's establishment.    [p.69]There he sits, or rather lies (for verily I believe he sleeps  through three-fourths of the day), a thin old man about  fifty-eight,[FN#31] with features once handsome and regular; a sallow  face, shaven head, deeply wrinkled cheeks, eyes hopelessly bleared, and  a rough grey beard ignorant of oil and comb. His turband, though large,  is brown with wear; his coat and small-clothes display many a hole;  and, though his face and hands must be frequently washed preparatory to  devotion, still they have the quality of looking always unclean. It is  wonderful how fierce and gruff he is to the little boys and girls who  flock to him grasping farthings for pepper and sugar. On such occasions  I sit admiring to see him, when forced to exertion, wheel about on his  place, making a pivot of that portion of our organisation which mainly  distinguishes our species from the other families of the Simiadae, to  reach some distant drawer, or to pull down a case from its accustomed  shelf. How does he manage to say his prayers, to kneel and to prostrate  himself upon that two feet of ragged rug, scarcely sufficient for a  British infant to lie upon? He hopelessly owns that he knows nothing of  his craft, and the seats before his shop are seldom occupied. His great  pleasure appears to be when the Haji and I sit by him a few minutes in  the evening, bringing with us pipes, which he assists us to smoke, and  ordering coffee, which he insists upon sweetening with a lump of sugar  from his little store. There we make him talk and laugh, and  occasionally quote a few lines strongly savouring of the jovial: we  provoke him to long stories about the love borne him in his  student-days by the great and holy Shaykh Abd al-Rahman, and the  antipathy with which he was regarded by the equally    [p.70]great and holy Shakh Nasr al-Din, his memorable single  imprisonment for contumacy,[FN#32] and the temperate but effective  lecture, beginning with \"O almost entirely destitute of shame!\"  delivered on that occasion in presence of other under-graduates by the  Right Reverend principal of his college. Then we consult him upon  matters of doctrine, and quiz him tenderly about his powers of  dormition, and flatter him, or rather his age, with such phrases as,  \"The water from thy hand is of the Waters of Zemzem;\" or, \"We have  sought thee to deserve the Blessings of the Wise upon our  undertakings.\" Sometimes, with interested motives it must be owned, we  induce him to accompany us to the Hammam,[FN#33] where he insists upon  paying the smallest sum, quarrelling with everything and    [p.71]everybody, and giving the greatest trouble. We are generally his  only visitors; acquaintances he appears to have few, and no friends; he  must have had them once, for he was rich, but is not so now, so they  have fallen away from the poor old man.    When the Shaykh Mohammed sits with me, or I climb up into his little  shop for the purpose of receiving a lesson from him, he is quite at his  ease, reading when he likes, or making me read, and generally beginning  each lecture with some such preamble as this[FN#34]:-    \"Aywa! aywa! aywa![FN#35]\"-Even so, even so, even so! we take refuge  with Allah from Satan the Stoned! In the name of Allah, the  Compassionate, the Merciful, and the Blessings of Allah upon our Lord  Mohammed, and his Family and his Companions one and all! Thus saith the  author, may Almighty Allah have mercy upon him! Section I. of chapter  two, upon the orders of prayer,' &c.\"    He becomes fiercely sarcastic when I differ from him in opinion,  especially upon a point of grammar, or the theology over which his  beard has grown grey.    \"Subhan' Allah! (Allah be glorified![FN#36]) What words are these? If  thou be right, enlarge thy turband,[FN#37]\" (i.e., set up as a learned  man), \"and throw away thy    [p.72]drugs, for verily it is better to quicken men's souls than to  destroy their bodies, O Abdullah!\"    Oriental-like, he revels in giving good counsel.    \"Thou art always writing, O my brave![FN#38]\" (this is said on the few  occasions when I venture to make a note in my book), \"what evil habit  is this? Surely thou hast learned it in the lands of the Frank. Repent!\"    He loathes my giving medical advice gratis.    \"Thou hast two servants to feed, O my son! The doctors of Egypt never  write A, B, without a reward. Wherefore art thou ashamed?

The landward faces of the hills are  disposed at a sloping angle, contrasting strongly with the  perpendicularity of their seaward sides, and I found no inner range  corresponding with, and parallel to, the maritime chain. Nowhere had I  seen a land in which Earths anatomy lies so barren, or one richer in  volcanic and primary formations.[FN#19] Especially    [p.74] towards the South, the hills were abrupt and highly vertical,  with black and barren flanks, ribbed with furrows and fissures, with  wide and formidable precipices and castellated summits like the work of  man. The predominant formation was basalt, called the Arabs Hajar  Jahannam, or Hell-stone; here and there it is porous and cellular; in  some places compact and black; and in others coarse and gritty, of a  tarry colour, and when fractured shining with bright points. Hornblende  is common at Al-Madinah and throughout this part of Al-Hijaz: it crops  out of the ground edgeways, black and brittle. Greenstone, diorite, and  actinolite are found, though not so abundantly as those above  mentioned. The granites, called in Arabic Suwan,[FN#20] abound. Some  are large-grained, of a pink colour, and appear in blocks, which,  flaking off under the influence of the atmosphere, form ooidal blocks  and boulders piled in irregular heaps. Others are grey and compact  enough to take a high polish when cut. The syenite is generally coarse,  although there is occasionally found a rich red variety of that stone.  I did not see eurite or euritic porphyry except in small pieces, and  the same may be said of the petrosilex and the milky and waxy  quartz.[FN#21] In some parts, particularly between Yambu and Al-Madinah,  there is an abundance of tawny    [p.75] yellow gneiss markedly stratified. The transition formations are  represented by a fine calcareous sandstone of a bright ochre colour: it  is used at Meccah to adorn the exteriors of houses, bands of this stone  being here and there inserted into the courses of masonry. There is  also a small admixture of the greenish sandstone which abounds at Aden.  The secondary formation is represented by a fine limestone, in some  places almost fit for the purposes of lithography, and a coarse gypsum  often of a tufaceous nature. For the superficial accumulations of the  country, I may refer the reader to any description of the Desert  between Cairo and Suez.    [FN#1] The distance from Baghdad to Al-Madinah is 180 parasangs,  according to Abd al-Karim: Voyage de lInde, a la Mecque; translated by M.  Langles, Paris, 1797. This book is a disappointment, as it describes  everything except Al-Madinah and Meccah: these gaps are filled up by  the translator with the erroneous descriptions of other authors, not  eye-witnesses.  [FN#2] Here, it is believed, was fought the battle of Buas, celebrated  in the pagan days of Al-Madinah (A.D. 615). Our dictionaries translate  Ghadir by pool or stagnant water. Here it is applied to places where water  stands for a short time after rain.  [FN#3] Travels in Arabia, vol. 2, p, 217. The Swiss traveller was  prevented by sickness from visiting it. The Jazb al-Kulub affords the  following account of a celebrated eruption, beginning on the Salkh  (last day) of Jamadi al-Awwal, and ending on the evening of the third  of Jamadi al-Akhir, A.H. 654. Terrible earthquakes, accompanied by a  thundering noise, shook the town; from fourteen to eighteen were  observed each night. On the third of Jamadi al-Akhir, after the Isha  prayers, a fire burst out in the direction of Al-Hijaz (eastward); it  resembled a vast city with a turretted and battlemental fort, in which  men appeared drawing the flame about, as it were, whilst it roared,  burned, and melted like a sea everything that came in its way.  Presently red and bluish streams, bursting from it, ran close to  Al-Madinah; and, at the same time, the city was fanned by a cooling  zephyr from the same direction. Al-Kistlani, an eye-witness, asserts  that the brilliant light of the volcano made the face of the country as  bright as day; and the interior of the Harim was as if the sun shone  upon it, so that men worked and required nought of the sun and moon  (the latter of which was also eclipsed?). Several saw the light at  Meccah, at Tayma (in Nijd, six days journey from Al-Madinah), and at  Busra, of Syria, reminding men of the Prophets saying, A fire shall burst  forth from the direction of Al-Hijaz; its light shall make visible the  necks of the camels at Busra. Historians relate that the length of the  stream was four parasangs (from fourteen to sixteen miles), its breadth  four miles (56? to the degree), and its depth about nine feet. It  flowed like a torrent with the waves of a sea; the rocks, melted by its  heat, stood up as a wall, and, for a time, it prevented the passage of  Badawin, who, coming from that direction, used to annoy the citizens.  Jamal Matari, one of the historians of Al-Madinah, relates that the  flames, which destroyed the stones, spared the trees; and he asserts  that some men, sent by the governor to inspect the fire, felt no heat;  also that the feathers of an arrow shot into it were burned whilst the  shaft remained whole. This he attributes to the sanctity of the trees  within the Harim. On the contrary, Al-Kistlani asserts the fire to have  been so vehement that no one could approach within two arrow-flights,  and that it melted the outer half of a rock beyond the limits of the  sanctuary, leaving the inner parts unscathed. The Kazi, the Governor,  and the citizens engaged in devotional exercises, and during the whole  length of the Thursday and the Friday nights, all, even the women and  children, with bare heads wept round the Prophets tomb. Then the lava  current turned northwards. (I remarked on the way to Ohod signs of a  lava-field.) This current ran, according to some, three entire months.  Al-Kistlani dates its beginning on Friday, 6 Jamadi al-Akhir, and its  cessation on Sunday, 27 Rajab: in this period of fifty-two days he  includes, it is supposed, the length of its extreme heat. That same  year (A.H. 654) is infamous in Al-Islam for other portents, such as the  inundation of Baghdad by the Tigris, and the burning of the Prophets  Mosque. In the next year first appeared the Tartars, who slew Al-Mutasim  Billah, the Caliph, massacred the Moslems during more than a month,  destroyed their books, monuments, and tombs, and stabled their  war-steeds in the Mustansariyah College.  [FN#4] In this part of Al-Hijaz they have many names for a pass:Nakb,  Saghrah, and Mazik are those best known.  [FN#5] This is the palm, capped with large fan-shaped leaves, described  by every traveller in Egypt and in the nearer East.  [FN#6] The charge for a cup of coffee is one piastre and a half. A  pipe-bearer will engage himself for about £1 per mensem: he is always a  veteran smoker, and, in these regions, it is an axiom that the flavour  of your pipe mainly depends upon the filler. For convenience the  Persian Kaliun is generally used.  [FN#7] A days journey in Arabia is generally reckoned at twenty-four or  twenty-five Arab miles. Abulfeda leaves the distance of a Marhalah (or  Manzil, a station) undetermined. Al-Idrisi reckons it at thirty miles,  but speaks of short as well as long marches. The common literary  measures of length are these:3 Kadam (mans foot) = 1 Khatwah (pace): 1000  paces = 1 Mil (mile); 3 miles = 1 Farsakh (parasang); and 4 parasangs =  1 Barid or post. The Burhan i Katia gives the table thus:24 finger  breadths (or 6 breadths of the clenched hand, from 20 to 24 inches!) =  1 Gaz or yard; 1000 yards = 1 mile; 3 miles = 1 parasang. Some call the  four thousand yards measure a Kuroh (the Indian Cos), which, however,  is sometimes less by 1000 Gaz. The only ideas of distance known to the  Badawi of Al-Hijaz are the fanciful Saat or hour, and the uncertain  Manzil or halt: the former varies from 2 to 3½ miles, the latter from 15  to 25.  [FN#8] Khabt is a low plain; Midan, Fayhah, or Sath, a plain generally; and  Batha, a low, sandy flat.  [FN#9] In Burckhardts day there were 5,000 souls and 15,000 camels.  Capt. Sadlier, who travelled during the war (1819), found the number  reduced to 500. The extent of this Caravan has been enormously  exaggerated in Europe. I have heard of 15,000, and even of 20,000 men.  I include in the 7,000 about 1,200 Persians. They are no longer placed,  as Abd al-Karim relates, in the rear of the Caravan, or post of danger.  [FN#10] Lane has accurately described this article: in the Hijaz it is  sometimes made to resemble a little tent.  [FN#11] The vehicle mainly regulates the expense, as it evidences a mans  means. I have heard of a husband and wife leaving Alexandria with three  months provision and the sum of £5. They would mount a camel, lodge in  public buildings when possible, probably be reduced to beggary, and  possibly starve upon the road. On the other hand the minimum  expenditure,for necessaries, not donations and luxuries,of a man who  rides in a Takht-rawan from Damascus and back, would be about £1,200.  [FN#12] On the line of march the Mahmil, stripped of its embroidered  cover, is carried on camel-back, a mere framewood. Even the gilt silver  balls and crescent are exchanged for similar articles in brass.  [FN#13] Mahattah is a spot where luggage is taken down, i.e., a  station. By some Hijazis it is used in the sense of a halting-place,  where you spend an hour or two.  [FN#14] Khalik ma al-Badu is a favourite complimentary saying, among this  people, and means that you are no greasy burgher.
