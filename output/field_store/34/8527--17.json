The right and left edges of the rug are  woven over the rods to keep them straight. Both narrow borders were  woven before the center was commenced. The pattern in the illustration  is for a Wilton or Axminster rug, but can be used for mats, or box,  sachet, and cushion covers. It is made with cross-stitch embroidery on  burlap, silk, or wool canvas. (See also page 120.)    [Illustration: _A pattern for a rug or square_]    [Sidenote: _Turkish patterns laid with tablets_]    The children can lay these Turkish patterns with square tablets upon  their desks, the pattern being drawn upon the board, or on paper with a  rubber pen. It will be a delight to the children to transfer them to  paper by drawing and then coloring, or by cutting and pasting colored  papers.    [Sidenote: _Stitches for Khiva and Bokhara rugs_]    The genuine Khiva and Bokhara rugs are made by weaving and knotting  alternately. It will be easier at first to weave a web, or foundation.  Choose a tight twisted yarn about the color of the rug to be woven.  String a close warp of the wool and weave plain up and down, one string  at a time, until you have a rug of the desired size. Put in the pattern  first, and then the filling. This work will be almost too difficult for  _little_ children. Carpet wools and Germantown wool can be used. It will  not be found difficult to follow the pattern, especially if one is used  to cross-stitch embroidery. Each stitch counts for one of cross-stitch.  Keep the stitches very close together so that the nap will stand up well  when finished. Silk rugs can be copied in the same way, using floss or  rope silk for the pile. If one prefers, a piece of burlap may be  stretched across the loom and secured to the rods, instead of weaving a  foundation, as suggested.    [Illustration: _Stitches for pile weaving_]    [Sidenote: _Stitches for pile weaving_]    [Sidenote: _The first stitch_]    Stitches for pile weaving are very easily made. This illustration  showing examples of stitches for pile weaving illustrates the methods  used in the stitches, and may be used for Axminster or Wilton rugs, for  boxes, sachet cases, and other articles. The tape needle is the kind  used for weaving when the large needle cannot be used. It is preferable  to use one of this kind on account of the eye and blunt point, and it  may be obtained at the notion counter in department stores for a few  cents. There are two stitches, each occupying half of the illustration  and numbered from left to right, beginning at the top. Make No. 1 by  passing a tape needle threaded with wool down through the web, leaving a  short end, then up one stitch to the left. This is the first step. In  No. 2 continue over on the right side, _past_ the stitch where you  started, to the stitch on the right; then down and up through the first  hole, and cut off the wool the same length as the end you left at first.  No. 3 shows a stitch completed. No. 4, one row of stitches, and No. 5,  three rows, showing how one row overlaps another. When the rug is  finished, the ends should be cut evenly, so that the nap is like velvet.  The children would say that this stitch looks like a two-legged stool,  and so it does.    [Sidenote: _The second stitch_]    The second stitch is made so that the nap lies sideways from left to  right. No. _a_ is just like the preceding stitch. No. _b_ shows the  needle passing down the stitch where you started and up one stitch to  the right. Cut off the wool and pull the end left at first over the  last one. This pile should stand very straight and even. No. _c_ shows a  completed stitch; No. _d_ one row, and No. _e_ three rows. These  stitches are useful in mending Khiva and Bokhara rugs.    [Sidenote: _Wilton and Axminster rugs_]    Wilton, Axminster, or any rugs having a pile, can be woven with the same  stitches. The pattern in the illustration may be used for either a  Wilton or Axminster rug, for a box cover, cushion, sachet case, or mat;  and can be cross-stitched embroidery, on burlap, silk or woolen canvas.    [Illustration: _Pattern for a rug, mat or cover_]          Chapter Thirteen    NAVAJO BLANKETS      [Illustration: _A miniature Indian loom_]    [Sidenote: _A sketch_]    [Sidenote: _Indian weaving_]    [Sidenote: _The colors used_]    [Sidenote: _Old Indian blankets are rare_]    [Sidenote: _Description of the illustration_]    Navajo blankets were first made by the Pueblo Indians, from whom the  Navajo Indians learned the art, and not long after the latter excelled  in the making of them. Among the Pueblo Indians the men do the work; but  women are the weavers among the Navajos. In the illustration on this  page is seen a miniature Navajo loom with the blanket commenced. The two  cords woven at the sides with the woof can be easily seen. Simple looms  are suspended between two posts or trees, and the weaver sits upon the  ground. A twig is used for a shuttle, and a reed, fork-shaped like a  hand, is used to push down the woof threads. The blanket is made  waterproof by pounding down the threads with a batten, a good picture of  which is seen in Dr. Washington Matthews' article on Navajo weavers in  the Third Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology. Separate balls of  color are used to carry out the pattern, which is sometimes traced in  the sand before the work is commenced. As many as twenty-nine different  balls have been seen hanging from a single blanket. Some of the designs  have been handed down from one generation to another, and are carried  entirely in the memory. They are often symbolical \"and unfold a whole  legend to the knowing eye of the native.\" The weaving is done from the  bottom up, some working in one direction, while others weave first at  the bottom, then turn the loom upside down, and, after weaving about the  same distance there, finish in the middle. The last part of the weaving  is like darning, and is often done with a needle. The colors most used  are white, gray, black, a bright yellow, red (a scarlet, generally  obtained by raveling bayeta cloth), and sometimes blue. In former times,  when the Indians used vegetable dyes, the colors were beautiful and  lasting. These old blankets are becoming more and more rare, and to-day  in their places we have the bright and not always satisfactory results  of aniline dyes. The blanket in the illustration facing this page has  narrow stripes in the following colors: On each end (seven stripes) red,  black, white, orange, green, white, black. The two groups of six stripes  in the middle are: Black, white, red, green, white, black. Before the  advent of the present squaw dress, the black, red, and dark blue  blankets were used as clothing, but the best blankets were, and still  are, worn at sacred dances. Dr. Matthews, in his report, gives an  interesting description of the method of making these blankets, with  several pictures of the better examples. Navajo blankets are finished  with four border cords, which are secured as the weaving progresses, and  the ends are fastened at the four corners by small tassels.    [Illustration: _A Navajo Indian woman weaving a blanket_]    [Sidenote: _Method of making_]    [Sidenote: _Indian blankets_]    Small Navajo blankets can be woven on the loom. Draw the pattern and  place under the warp, fastening it to the side rods. Use warp or carpet  thread for the warp, and weave with a tape or upholstery needle. One may  weave all the pattern first, and then put in the filling; while another  will weave as the Indians do, filling in from one part of the pattern to  the other by threading the needle with a different color. This can be  done, without running the thread underneath, by hooking it in the loop  of the pattern just finished. These little blankets are very fascinating  things to make, and the children become much interested in them, and in  Indian life as well.    [Illustration: _A Navajo blanket_]    [Sidenote: _The colors in the blanket on page 141_]    This very beautiful Navajo blanket, shown in the illustration, has three  broad red stripes, two narrow red stripes about one-half the width of  the former, and four gray stripes about one-half the width of narrow red  stripes. The centers of all the figures are red, like the filling--a  brilliant scarlet. The colors of the large figures, beginning at the  center of each, and counting from left to right, are as follows: Nos. 1,  3, and 5, red, green, and light yellow. Nos. 2 and 4, red, white, and  black. The small figures, counting the same way, are: Nos. 1, 3, and 5,  red, white, and black. Nos. 2 and 4, red, yellow, and green. The four  corners are finished with twisted red cord-like tassels. This cord also  extends across the warp ends. Dr. Matthews tells in his article on  \"Navajo Weavers\" how two cords are twisted and woven at the sides with  the woof.    [Illustration: _A very beautiful Navajo Indian blanket, showing the  manner of decoration_]    The two Navajo Indian blankets illustrated in this chapter, and the  pattern on the following page, may be easily adapted for the loom.  Germantown knitting wool or carpet ravelings can be used, although to  obtain softer wool is better. Some of the handsomest Navajo blankets  have a long nap.    [Sidenote: _Navajo patterns laid with tablets_]    The children will take pleasure in laying Navajo patterns with  triangular tablets, and then transferring the pattern to paper by  drawing and coloring, or by cutting and pasting in colors.    [Illustration: _A pattern for a Navajo blanket_]          Chapter Fourteen    SONGS, GAMES, AND STORIES      There are many beautiful songs which can be sung during the weaving.  Thomas Carlyle has said:    [Sidenote: _Songs and games lighten work_]    \"Give us, O give us the man who sings at his work! He will do more in  the same time; he will do it better; he will persevere longer. One is  scarcely sensible of fatigue whilst he marches to music, and the very  stars are said to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3165"],[0,"Rashi (#15)"],[1,"Rashi stands before us a teacher distinguished and original, a  religious leader full of tact and delicate feeling, a scholar  clear-headed and at the same time loving-hearted.  In which  capacity, as teacher, religious leader, scholar, does he evoke  our deepest admiration?  Shall we accord it to the one who made a  home for Talmudic studies on the banks of the Seine, and so gave  a definite impetus to French Jewish civilization?  Or shall we  accord it to the one who for nearly forty years presided over the  spiritual destinies of an active and studious population and  fulfilled the duties of a rabbi; with all the more devotion,  without doubt, because he did not have the title of rabbi?  Or  should we not rather pay our highest tribute to Rashi the man, so  upright and modest, so simple and amiable, who has won for  himself the veneration of posterity as much by the qualities of  his heart as by those of his intellect, as much by his goodness  and kindliness as by the subtlety and acumen of his mind, in a  word, as much by his character as by his knowledge? Nevertheless  his knowledge was extraordinary and productive of great works,  which we shall consider in the following chapters.    As spiritual chief of the French Jews, it was natural that Rashi  should occupy himself with the source of their intellectual and  religious activity, with the Bible.  But in his capacity of  Talmudist and teacher, it was equally natural that he should  devote himself to the explanation of the Talmud, which formed the  basis of instruction in the schools, besides serving to regulate  the acts of everyday life and the practices of religion.  And as  a rabbinical authority he was called upon to resolve the problems  that arose out of individual difficulties or out of communal  questions.  We need no other guide than this to lead us to an  understanding of his works.  But not to omit anything essential,  it would be well to mention some collections which were the  result of his instruction, and some liturgical poems attributed  to him.           *       *       *       *       *    Rashi owes his great reputation to his commentaries on the two  great works that comprehend Jewish life in its entirety, and lie  at the very root of the intellectual development of Judaism, the  Bible and the Talmud.  His commentaries involving an enormous  amount of labor are all but complete; they fail to cover only a  few books of the Bible and a few treatises of the Talmud.  The  conjecture has been made that at first he set himself to  commenting on the Talmud, and then on the Bible, because at the  end of his life he expressed the wish that he might begin the  Biblical commentary all over again.  But this hypothesis is not  justified.  The unfinished state of both commentaries, especially  the one on the Talmud, shows that he worked on them at the same  time.  But they were not written without interruption, not \"in one  spurt,\" as the college athlete might say.  Rashi worked at them  intermittently, going back to them again and again.  It is certain  that so far as the Talmudic treatises are concerned, he did not  exert himself to follow the order in which they occur.  He may  have taken them up when he explained them in his school.  But in  commenting on the Bible, it seems, he adhered to the sequence of  the books, for it was on the later books that he did not have the  time to write commentaries.  Moreover, he sometimes went back to  his commentary on a Biblical book or a Talmudic treatise, not  because he worked to order, like Ibn Ezra, and as circumstances  dictated, but because he was not satisfied with his former  attempt, and because, in the course of his study, the same  subject came up for his consideration.  Though the commentaries,  then, were not the result of long, steady application, they  demanded long-continued efforts, and they were, one may say, the  business of his whole life.  The rabbi Isaac of Vienna, who  possessed an autograph commentary of Rashi, speaks of the  numerous erasures and various marks with which it was  embroidered.    The commentaries of Rashi, which do not bear special titles, are  not an uninterrupted exposition of the entire work under  consideration, and could not be read from cover to cover without  recourse to the text explained; they are rather detached glosses,  postils, to borrow an expression from ecclesiastical literature,  upon terms or phrases presenting some difficulties.  They are  always preceded by the word or words to be explained.    It is evident, then, that Rashi's works do not bear witness to  great originality, or, better, to great creative force.  Rashi  lacks elevation in his point of view, breadth of outlook, and  largeness of conception.  He possessed neither literary taste nor  esthetic sense.  He was satisfied to throw light upon an  obscurity, to fill up a lacuna, to justify an apparent  imperfection, to explain a peculiarity of style, or to reconcile  contradictions.  He never tried to call attention to the beauties  of the text or to give a higher idea of the original; he never  succeeded in bringing into relief the humanity of a law, or the  universal bearing of an event.    Rashi failed also to regard a thing in its entirety.  He did not  write prefaces to his works setting forth the contents of the  book and the method to be pursued.[51]  In the body of the  commentaries, he hardly ever dwells on a subject at length, but  contents himself with a brief explanation.  In short, his horizon  was limited and he lacked perspective.  It is to be regretted that  he did not know the philosophic works of Saadia, who would have  opened up new worlds to him, and would have enlarged the circle  of his ideas.  If he had read only the Biblical commentaries of  the great Gaon, he would have learned from him how to grasp a  text in its entirety and give a general idea of a work.    Even if he had limited himself to the Talmud, Rashi, without  doubt, would have been incapable of raising a vast and harmonious  edifice, like the <I>Mishneh Torah</I> of Maimonides.  He did not  possess the art of developing the various sides of a subject so  as to produce a well-ordered whole.  He lacked not only literary  ambition, but also that genius for organizing and systematizing  which classifies and co-ordinates all the laws.  Though  methodical, he lacked the power to generalize.    This defect, common to his contemporaries, arose, possibly, from  a certain timidity.  He believed that he ought to efface himself  behind his text, and not let his own idea take the place of the  author's, especially when the text was a religious law and the  author the Divine legislator.  But it seems that his power of  creative thought was not strong, and could exercise itself only  upon the more original works of others.  We find analogous  features in scholastic literature, which developed wholly in the  shadow of the Scriptures, the Fathers of the Church, and  Aristotle.    This narrow criticism, this eye for detail, this lack of general  ideas and of guiding principles at least guarded Rashi against a  danger more original spirits failed to escape, namely, of reading  preconceived notions into the text, of interpreting it by an  individual method, and, thus, of gathering more meaning, or  another meaning, than was intended by the author.  Unlike the  Jewish and Christian theologians, Rashi felt no need to do  violence to the text in order to reconcile it with his scientific  and philosophic beliefs.    Though Rashi, as I said, had not a creative intellect, he yet had  all the qualities of a commentator.  First of all, he possessed  clearness, the chief requisite for a commentary, which undertakes  to explain a work unintelligible to its readers.  \"To write like  Rashi\" has become a proverbial expression for \"to write clearly  and intelligibly.\" Rashi always or nearly always uses the  expression one expects.  He finds the explanation that obtrudes  itself because it is simple and easy; he excels in unravelling  [unraveling sic] difficulties and illuminating obscurities.  To  facilitate comprehension by the reader Rashi resorted to the use  of pictures and diagrams, some of which still appear in his  Talmudic commentary, though a number have been suppressed by the  editors.  Once, when asked for the explanation of a difficult  passage in Ezekiel, he replied that he had nothing to add to what  he had said in his commentary, but he would send a diagram which  would render the text more intelligible.  It is remarkable with  what ease, even without the aid of illustrations, he unravelled  [unraveled sic] the chapters of Ezekiel in which the Prophet  describes the Temple of his fancy; or the equally complicated  chapters of Exodus which set forth the plan of the Tabernacle.    Essentially this power of exposition is the attribute of  intelligent insight.  Rashi's was the clearest, the most  transparent mind-no clouds nor shadows, no ambiguities, no  evasions.  He leaves nothing to be taken for granted, he makes no  mental reservations.  He is clearness and transparency itself.    But Rashi's language is not merely clear; it is extremely  precise.  It says with accuracy exactly what it sets out to say.  Rashi did not hesitate sometimes to coin new words for the sake  of conveying his thought.  He always heeded the connotation of a  word, and took the context into account.  Once, in citing a  Talmudic explanation of a verse in Jeremiah, he rejected it,  because it did not square with the development of the thought;  and often he would not accept an interpretation, because a word  in the text was given a meaning which it did not have in any  other passage.  He grasped, and rendered in turn with perfect  accuracy, shades of meaning and subtleties of language; and the  fine expression of relations difficult to solve surprises and  charms the reader by its precision.
