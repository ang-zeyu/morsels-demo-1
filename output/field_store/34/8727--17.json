[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4747"],[0,"The River's End (#15)"],[1,"his intention had been to avoid  the possibility of a personal discussion of the situation. That, at  least, was Keith's first impression.    He turned to examine the window. There was no doubt that Shan Tung had  come in that way. Both the sill and curtain bore stains of water and  mud, and there was wet dirt on the floor. For once the immaculate  oriental had paid no attention to his feet. At the door leading into  the big room Keith saw where he had stood for some time, listening,  probably when McDowell and Mary Josephine were in the outer room  waiting for him. Suddenly his eyes riveted themselves on the middle  panel of the door. Brady had intended his color scheme to be old  ivory--the panel itself was nearly white--and on it Shan Tung had  written heavily with a lead pencil the hour of his presence, \"10.45  P.M.\" Keith's amazement found voice in a low exclamation. He looked at  his watch. It was a quarter-hour after twelve. He had returned to the  Shack before ten, and the clever Shan Tung was letting him know in this  cryptic fashion that for more than three-quarters of an hour he had  listened at the door and spied upon him and Mary Josephine through the  keyhole.    Had even such an insignificant person as Wallie been guilty of that  act, Keith would have felt like thrashing him. It surprised himself  that he experienced no personal feeling of outrage at Shan Tung's frank  confession of eavesdropping. A subtle significance began to attach  itself more and more to the story his room was telling him. He knew  that Shan Tung had left none of the marks of his presence out of  bravado, but with a definite purpose. Keith's psychological mind was at  all times acutely ready to seize upon possibilities, and just as his  positiveness of Conniston's spiritual presence had inspired him to act  his lie with Mary Josephine, so did the conviction possess him now that  his room held for him a message of the most vital importance.    In such an emergency Keith employed his own method. He sat down,  lighted his pipe again, and centered the full resource of his mind on  Shan Tung, dissociating himself from the room and the adventure of the  night as much as possible in his objective analysis of the man. Four  distinct emotional factors entered into that analysis--fear, distrust,  hatred, personal enmity. To his surprise he found himself drifting  steadily into an unusual and unexpected mental attitude. From the time  he had faced Shan Tung in the inspector's office, he had regarded him  as the chief enemy of his freedom, his one great menace. Now he felt  neither personal enmity nor hatred for him. Fear and distrust remained,  but the fear was impersonal and the distrust that of one who watches a  clever opponent in a game or a fight. His conception of Shan Tung  changed. He found his occidental mind running parallel with the  oriental, bridging the spaces which otherwise it never would have  crossed, and at the end it seized upon the key. It proved to him that  his first impulse had been wrong. Shan Tung had not expected him to  seek safety in flight. He had given the white man credit for a larger  understanding than that. His desire, first of all, had been to let  Keith know that he was not the only one who was playing for big stakes,  and that another, Shan Tung himself, was gambling a hazard of his own,  and that the fraudulent Derwent Conniston was a trump card in that game.    To impress this upon Keith he had, first of all, acquainted him with  the fact that he had seen through his deception and that he knew he was  John Keith and not Derwent Conniston. He had also let him know that he  believed he had killed the Englishman, a logical supposition under the  circumstances. This information he had left for Keith was not in the  form of an intimidation. There was, indeed, something very near  apologetic courtesy in the presence of the card bearing Shan Tung's  compliments. The penciling of the hour on the panel of the door,  without other notation, was a polite and suggestive hint. He wanted  Keith to know that he understood his peculiar situation up until that  particular time, that he had heard and possibly seen much that had  passed between him and Mary Josephine. The partly opened window, the  mud and wet on curtains and floor, and the cigarette stubs were all to  call Keith's attention to the box on the table.    Keith could not but feel a certain sort of admiration for the Chinaman.  The two questions he must answer now were, What was Shan Tung's game?  and What did Shan Tung expect him to do?    Instantly Miriam Kirkstone flashed upon him as the possible motive for  Shan Tung's visit. He recalled her unexpected and embarrassing question  of that evening, in which she had expressed a suspicion and a doubt as  to John Keith's death. He had gone to Miriam's at eight. It must have  been very soon after that, and after she had caught a glimpse of the  face at the window, that Shan Tung had hurried to the Shack.    Slowly but surely the tangled threads of the night's adventure were  unraveling themselves for Keith. The main facts pressed upon him, no  longer smothered in a chaos of theory and supposition. If there had  been no Miriam Kirkstone in the big house on the hill, Shan Tung would  have gone to McDowell, and he would have been in irons at the present  moment. McDowell had been right after all. Miriam Kirkstone was  fighting for something that was more than her existence. The thought of  that \"something\" made Keith writhe and his hands clench. Shan Tung had  triumphed but not utterly. A part of the fruit of his triumph was still  just out of his reach, and the two--beautiful Miss Kirkstone and the  deadly Shan Tung--were locked in a final struggle for its possession.  In some mysterious way he, John Keith, was to play the winning hand.  How or when he could not understand. But of one thing he was convinced;  in exchange for whatever winning card he held Shan Tung had offered him  his life. Tomorrow he would expect an answer.    That tomorrow had already dawned. It was one o'clock when Keith again  looked at his watch. Twenty hours ago he had cooked his last camp-fire  breakfast. It was only eighteen hours ago that he had filled himself  with the smell of Andy Duggan's bacon, and still more recently that he  had sat in the little barber shop on the corner wondering what his fate  would be when he faced McDowell. It struck him as incongruous and  impossible that only fifteen hours had passed since then. If he  possessed a doubt of the reality of it all, the bed was there to help  convince him. It was a real bed, and he had not slept in a real bed for  a number of years. Wallie had made it ready for him. Its sheets were  snow-white. There was a counterpane with a fringe on it and pillows  puffed up with billowy invitation, as if they were on the point of  floating away. Had they risen before his eyes, Keith would have  regarded the phenomenon rather casually. After the swift piling up of  the amazing events of those fifteen hours, a floating pillow would have  seemed quite in the natural orbit of things. But they did not float.  They remained where they were, their white breasts bared to him, urging  upon him a common-sense perspective of the situation. He wasn't going  to run away. He couldn't sit up all night. Therefore why not come to  them and sleep?    There was something directly personal in the appeal of the pillows and  the bed. It was not general; it was for him. And Keith responded.    He made another note of the time, a half-hour after one, when he turned  in. He allotted himself four hours of sleep, for it was his intention  to be up with the sun.          XII      Necessity had made of Keith a fairly accurate human chronometer. In the  second year of his fugitivism he had lost his watch. At first it was  like losing an arm, a part of his brain, a living friend. From that  time until he came into possession of Conniston's timepiece he was his  own hour-glass and his own alarm clock. He became proficient.    Brady's bed and the Circe-breasted pillows that supported his head were  his undoing. The morning after Shan Tung's visit he awoke to find the  sun flooding in through the eastern window of his room, The warmth of  it as it fell full in his face, setting his eyes blinking, told him it  was too late. He guessed it was eight o'clock. When he fumbled his  watch out from under his pillow and looked at it, he found it was a  quarter past. He got up quietly, his mind swiftly aligning itself to  the happenings of yesterday. He stretched himself until his muscles  snapped, and his chest expanded with deep breaths of air from the  windows he had left open when he went to bed. He was fit. He was ready  for Shan Tung, for McDowell. And over this physical readiness there  surged the thrill of a glorious anticipation. It fairly staggered him  to discover how badly he wanted to see Mary Josephine again.    He wondered if she was still asleep and answered that there was little  possibility of her being awake--even at eight o'clock. Probably she  would sleep until noon, the poor, tired, little thing! He smiled  affectionately into the mirror over Brady's dressing-table. And then  the unmistakable sound of voices in the outer room took him curiously  to the door. They were subdued voices. He listened hard, and his heart  pumped faster. One of them was Wallie's voice; the other was Mary  Josephine's.    He was amused with himself at the extreme care with which he proceeded  to dress. It was an entirely new sensation. Wallie had provided him  with the necessaries for a cold sponge and in some mysterious interim  since their arrival had brushed and pressed the most important of  Conniston's things. With the Englishman's wardrobe he had brought up  from barracks a small chest which was still locked. Until this morning  Keith had not noticed it. It was less than half as large as a steamer  trunk and had the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4748"],[0,"Baree, Son of Kazan (#15)"],[1," the pantomimic actions of Wapoos, who was having his  vengeance inside him. For the life of him Baree could not keep from  dancing about, while the wire grew tighter and tighter about his neck.  When he snapped at the wire and flung the weight of his body to the  ground, the sapling would bend obligingly, and then--in its  rebound--would yank him for an instant completely off the earth.  Furiously he struggled. It was a miracle that the fine wire held him.  In a few moments more it must have broken--but McTaggart had heard him!  The factor caught up his blanket and a heavy stick as he hurried toward  the snare. It was not a rabbit making those sounds--he knew that.  Perhaps a fishercat--a lynx, a fox, a young wolf--    It was the wolf he thought of first when he saw Baree at the end of the  wire. He dropped the blanket and raised the club. If there had been  clouds overhead, or the stars had been less brilliant, Baree would have  died as surely as Wapoos had died. With the club raised over his head  McTaggart saw in time the white star, the white-tipped ear, and the jet  black of Baree's coat.    With a swift movement he exchanged the club for the blanket.    In that hour, could McTaggart have looked ahead to the days that were  to come, he would have used the club. Could he have foreseen the great  tragedy in which Baree was to play a vital part, wrecking his hopes and  destroying his world, he would have beaten him to a pulp there under  the light of the stars. And Baree, could he have foreseen what was to  happen between this brute with a white skin and the most beautiful  thing in the forests, would have fought even more bitterly before he  surrendered himself to the smothering embrace of the factor's blanket.  On this night Fate had played a strange hand for them both, and only  that Fate, and perhaps the stars above, held a knowledge of what its  outcome was to be.        CHAPTER 12    Half an hour later Bush McTaggart's fire was burning brightly again. In  the glow of it Baree lay trussed up like an Indian papoose, tied into a  balloon-shaped ball with babiche thong, his head alone showing where  his captor had cut a hole for it in the blanket. He was hopelessly  caught--so closely imprisoned in the blanket that he could scarcely  move a muscle of his body. A few feet away from him McTaggart was  bathing a bleeding hand in a basin of water. There was also a red  streak down the side of McTaggart's bullish neck.    \"You little devil!\" he snarled at Baree. \"You little devil!\"    He reached over suddenly and gave Baree's head a vicious blow with his  heavy hand.    \"I ought to beat your brains out, and--I believe I will!\"    Baree watched him as he picked up a stick close at his side--a bit of  firewood. Pierrot had chased him, but this was the first time he had  been near enough to the man-monster to see the red glow in his eyes.  They were not like the eyes of the wonderful creature who had almost  caught him in the web of her hair, and who had crawled after him under  the rock. They were the eyes of a beast. They made him shrink and try  to draw his head back into the blanket as the stick was raised. At the  same time he snarled. His white fangs gleamed in the firelight. His  ears were flat. He wanted to sink his teeth in the red throat where he  had already drawn blood.    The stick fell. It fell again and again, and when McTaggart was done,  Baree lay half stunned, his eyes partly closed by the blows, and his  mouth bleeding.    \"That's the way we take the devil out of a wild dog,\" snarled  McTaggart. \"I guess you won't try the biting game again, eh, youngster?  A thousand devils--but you went almost to the bone of this hand!\"    He began washing the wound again. Baree's teeth had sunk deep, and  there was a troubled look in the factor's face. It was July--a bad  month for bites. From his kit he got a small flask of whisky and turned  a bit of the raw liquor on the wound, cursing Baree as it burned into  his flesh.    Baree's half-shut eyes were fixed on him steadily. He knew that at last  he had met the deadliest of all his enemies. And yet he was not afraid.  The club in Bush McTaggart's hand had not killed his spirit. It had  killed his fear. It had roused in him a hatred such as he had never  known--not even when he was fighting Oohoomisew, the outlaw owl. The  vengeful animosity of the wolf was burning in him now, along with the  savage courage of the dog. He did not flinch when McTaggart approached  him again. He made an effort to raise himself, that he might spring at  this man-monster. In the effort, swaddled as he was in the blanket, he  rolled over in a helpless and ludicrous heap.    The sight of it touched McTaggart's risibilities, and he laughed. He  sat down with his back to the tree again and filled his pipe.    Baree did not take his eyes from McTaggart as he smoked. He watched the  man when the latter stretched himself out on the bare ground and went  to sleep. He listened, still later, to the man-monster's heinous  snoring. Again and again during the long night he struggled to free  himself. He would never forget that night. It was terrible. In the  thick, hot folds of the blanket his limbs and body were suffocated  until the blood almost stood still in his veins. Yet he did not whine.    They began to journey before the sun was up, for if Baree's blood was  almost dead within him, Bush McTaggart's was scorching his body. He  made his last plans as he walked swiftly through the forest with Baree  under his arm. He would send Pierrot at once for Father Grotin at his  mission seventy miles to the west. He would marry Nepeese--yes, marry  her! That would tickle Pierrot. And he would be alone with Nepeese  while Pierrot was gone for the missioner.    This thought flamed McTaggart's blood like strong whisky. There was no  thought in his hot and unreasoning brain of what Nepeese might say--of  what she might think. His hand clenched, and he laughed harshly as  there flashed on him for an instant the thought that perhaps Pierrot  would not want to give her up. Pierrot! Bah! It would not be the first  time he had killed a man--or the second.    McTaggart laughed again, and he walked still faster. There was no  chance of his losing--no chance for Nepeese to get away from him.  He--Bush McTaggart--was lord of this wilderness, master of its people,  arbiter of their destinies. He was power--and the law.    The sun was well up when Pierrot, standing in front of his cabin with  Nepeese, pointed to a rise in the trail three or four hundred yards  away, over which McTaggart had just appeared.    \"He is coming.\"    With a face which had aged since last night he looked at Nepeese. Again  he saw the dark glow in her eyes and the deepening red of her parted  lips, and his heart was sick again with dread. Was it possible--    She turned on him, her eyes shining, her voice trembling.    \"Remember, Nootawe--you must send him to me for his answer,\" she cried  quickly, and she darted into the cabin. With a cold, gray face Pierrot  faced Bush McTaggart.        CHAPTER 13    From the window, her face screened by the folds of the curtain which  she had made for it, the Willow could see what happened outside. She  was not smiling now. She was breathing quickly, and her body was tense.  Bush McTaggart paused not a dozen feet from the window and shook hands  with Pierrot, her father. She heard McTaggart's coarse voice, his  boisterous greeting, and then she saw him showing Pierrot what he  carried under his arm. There came to her distinctly his explanation of  how he had caught his captive in a rabbit snare. He unwrapped the  blanket. Nepeese gave a cry of amazement. In an instant she was out  beside them. She did not look at McTaggart's red face, blazing in its  joy and exultation.    \"It is Baree!\" she cried.    She took the bundle from McTaggart and turned to Pierrot.    \"Tell him that Baree belongs to me,\" she said.    She hurried into the cabin. McTaggart looked after her, stunned and  amazed. Then he looked at Pierrot. A man half blind could have seen  that Pierrot was as amazed as he.    Nepeese had not spoken to him--the factor of Lac Bain! She had not  LOOKED at him! And she had taken the dog from him with as little  concern as though he had been a wooden man. The red in his face  deepened as he stared from Pierrot to the door through which she had  gone, and which she had closed behind her.    On the floor of the cabin Nepeese dropped on her knees and finished  unwrapping the blanket. She was not afraid of Baree. She had forgotten  McTaggart. And then, as Baree rolled in a limp heap on the floor, she  saw his half-closed eyes and the dry blood on his jaws, and the light  left her face as swiftly as the sun is shadowed by a cloud. \"Baree,\"  she cried softly. \"Baree--Baree!\"    She partly lifted him in her two hands. Baree's head sagged. His body  was numbed until he was powerless to move. His legs were without  feeling. He could scarcely see. But he heard her voice! It was the same  voice that had come to him that day he had felt the sting of the  bullet, the voice that had pleaded with him under the rock!    The voice of the Willow thrilled Baree. It seemed to stir the sluggish  blood in his veins, and he opened his eyes wider and saw again the  wonderful stars that had glowed at him so softly the day of Wakayoo's  death. One of the Willow's long braids fell over her shoulder, and he  smelled again the sweet scent of her hair as her hand caressed him and  her voice talked to him. Then she got up suddenly and left him, and he  did not move while he waited for her. In a moment she was back with a  basin of water and a cloth. Gently she washed the blood from his eyes  and mouth. And still Baree made no move. He scarcely breathed. But  Nepeese saw the little quivers that shot through his body when her hand  touched him, like electric shocks.    \"He beat you with a club,\" she was saying, her dark eyes"]]]
