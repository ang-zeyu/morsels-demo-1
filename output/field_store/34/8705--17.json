Of course, the diligence stops  sometimes and the people get out, and there would be many opportunities  for your being suddenly seized and gagged and carried off.\"    \"They would have to be very sudden about it,\" Frank laughed. \"I do  think, mother, that you have been building mountains out of molehills.  Beppo may not be a spy, after all; he may have heard you talking of this  ten thousand pounds, and the temptation of trying to get it may be too  much for him. He will know now that I shall be on my guard, and that,  even if I have the money on my person, his chance of getting it is small  indeed. I believe that you and the signora have talked the matter over  till you have frightened yourselves, and built up a wonderful story,  based only on the fact that Mary thought that she caught Beppo listening  at the door.\"    \"How about the photographs?\" Mrs. Percival asked.    \"Possibly he has a hidden affection for me,\" Frank laughed, \"and has  taken these as mementos of his stay here. Well, don't say anything more  about it, mother; I am not in the least nervous, and with a brace of  loaded pistols in my pocket and the fair warning that I have had, I do  not think I need be afraid of two or three of these miserable Neapolitan  spies.\"    Accordingly, Frank started by the morning mail, as they had arranged.  The carriage was full to Dover; and at Calais he waited on the platform  until he saw an English gentleman with two ladies enter a compartment,  and in this he took a vacant corner seat. On his arrival at Paris he  drove across at once to the terminus of the railway to Marseilles,  breakfasted there, and sat in the waiting-room reading till the door on  to the platform opened, and an official shouted, \"Passengers for Melun,  Sens, Dijon, Macon, Lyons, and Marseilles.\" There was a general movement  among those in the waiting-room. Frank found that there was no fear of  his being in a compartment by himself, for only one carriage door was  opened at a time, and not until the compartment was full was the next  unlocked. He waited until he saw his opportunity, and was the first to  enter and secure a corner seat. In a short time it filled up.    He had slept most of the way between Calais and Paris, feeling  absolutely certain that he would not be interfered with in a carriage  with three English fellow-passengers. It was twelve o'clock now, and he  would not arrive at Marseilles until seven the next morning, and he  wondered where all his fellow-passengers, who were packed as closely as  possible, were going, for although he did not wish to be alone, it was  not a pleasant prospect to be for eighteen hours wedged in so tightly  that he could scarcely move. Then he wondered whether any of the men who  might be following were also in the train. He had quite come to the  conclusion that his mother and grandmother had frightened themselves  most unnecessarily; but he admitted that this was natural enough, after  the losses they had had. At Dijon several passengers got out, but others  took their places; and so the journey continued throughout the day. The  carriage was generally full, though once or twice there were for a time  but five besides himself. He read most of the way, for although he spoke  Italian as fluently as English, he could not converse in French. When  tired of reading he had several times dozed off to sleep, though he had  determined that he would keep awake all night.    At ten o'clock in the evening the train arrived at Lyons. Here there was  a stop of twenty minutes, and he got out and ate a hearty meal, and  drank two or three cups of strong coffee. He was not surprised to find,  on returning to his carriage, that all the passengers with two  exceptions had left it. These had got in at Macon, and were evidently  men of good circumstances and intimate with each other; he had no  suspicions whatever of them, for it was certain that men who had any  intention of attacking him would appear as strangers to each other. At  Vienne both left the carriage. Frank was not sorry to see them do so.    \"If there are really fellows watching me,\" he said to himself, \"the  sooner they show themselves and get it over the better; it is a nuisance  to keep on expecting something to take place when as likely as not  nothing will happen at all.\" He examined his pistols. They were loaded  but not capped, and he now put caps on the nipples, and replaced them in  his pocket.    Just before they had left Vienne a man had come to the window as if  intending to enter, but after glancing in for a moment had gone to  another carriage.    [Illustration: \"HIS ASSAILANT FELL BACK AND DISAPPEARED\"]    \"That is rather queer,\" Frank thought. \"As I am alone here, there was  plenty of room for him. Perhaps he had made a mistake in the carriage.  At any rate, they won't catch me napping.\"    The strong coffee that he had taken at Lyons had sharpened his  faculties, and he never felt more awake than he did after leaving  Vienne. He sat with his eyes apparently closed, as if asleep, with a  warm rug wrapped round his legs. An hour later he saw a face appear at  the opposite window. At first it was but for an instant; a few seconds  later it appeared again and watched him steadily; then the man moved  along to the door and another joined him. Frank without moving cocked  the pistol in his right-hand pocket, and took a firm hold of the butt  with his finger on the trigger. The door opened noiselessly, and the  second man thrust in an arm holding a pistol; so it remained for half a  minute. Frank was convinced that there was no intention of shooting if  it could be avoided, and remained perfectly still; then the arm was  withdrawn, and another man, holding a knife in one hand and a roll of  something in the other, entered. In a moment Frank's right arm flew up  and his pistol cracked out: his assailant fell back and disappeared  through the open door. Frank sprang to his feet as he fired, and stood  with his pistol levelled towards the window, where the head of the  second man had disappeared as his comrade fell backwards.    \"He knows I have the best of him now,\" Frank muttered to himself; \"I  don't think that he will have another try.\"    Advancing cautiously, he pulled the door to, lowered the window, and  putting a hand out without exposing his head, turned the handle, and  then drew up the window again. His foot struck against something as he  backed to his seat in the corner. As he still kept his eyes fixed on the  window, he paid no attention to this for a minute or two; then he became  conscious of a faint odour.    \"I expect that is chloroform or ether or something of that sort,\" he  said, as he lowered the window next to him; and then, still keeping an  eye on the door opposite, moved a step forward and picked up a large  handkerchief, steeped in a liquid of some sort or other. He was about to  open the window and throw it out, when an idea struck him.    \"I had better keep it,\" he said: \"there may be a beastly row over the  business, and this handkerchief may be useful in confirming my story.\"    He therefore put it up on the rack, lowered the window a few inches, and  did the same to the one opposite to it. Then wrapping the handkerchief  up in two or three newspapers he had bought by the way, to prevent the  liquid from evaporating, he sat down in his corner again. He felt  confident that the attack would not be renewed, now he was found to be  on the watch and armed. It was probable that the two men were alone, and  the one remaining would hardly venture single-handed to take any steps  whatever against one who was certain to continue to be vigilant. He had  no doubt that he had killed the man he fired at, and that, even if the  wound had not been instantly fatal, he would have been killed by his  fall from the train.    \"It seems horrid,\" he muttered, \"to have shot a man; but it was just as  much his life or mine as it would have been in battle. I hope no one  heard the shot fired. I expect that most of the passengers were asleep;  and if any one did hear it, he might suppose that a door had come open,  or had been opened by a guard, and had been slammed to. Of course, the  man's body will be found on the line in the morning, and I expect there  will be some fuss over it; but I hope we shall all be out of the train  and scattered through the town before any inquiries are set on foot. If  they traced it to me, I might be kept at Marseilles for weeks. Of  course, I should be all right; but the delay would be a frightful  nuisance. There is one thing,--the guard looked at my ticket just before  the train started from the last station, and would know that I was alone  in the carriage.\"    In a few minutes the speed of the train began to slacken. He knew that  the next station was Valence. He closed his eyes and listened as the  train stopped. As soon as it did so, he heard a voice from the next  carriage shouting for the guard. Then he heard an animated conversation,  of which he was able to gather the import.    \"The sound of a gun,\" the guard said. \"Nonsense; you must have been  dreaming!\"    \"I am sure I was not,\" a voice said indignantly. \"It seemed to me as if  it was in the next carriage.\"    The guard came to Frank's window. \"Ah, bah!\" he said. \"There is only one  passenger there, an Englishman. He was alone when we left Vienne, and he  is sound asleep now.\"    \"Perhaps he is dead.\"    It was possible, and therefore the guard opened the door. \"Are you  asleep, monsieur?\"    Frank opened his eyes. \"My ticket?\" he asked drowsily. \"Why, I showed it  you at Vienne.\"    \"Pardon, monsieur,\" the guard said. \"I am sorry that I disturbed you. It  was a mistake,\" and he closed the door, and said angrily to the man who  had called him: \"It is as I said. You have been asleep; and I have woke  the English gentleman up for nothing.\"    A minute later the train"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4558"],[0,"Barry Lyndon (#15)"],[1," to make. The sergeant was  putting us through our exercise on deck (the seamen and officers of the  transport looking grinning on) when a boat came from the shore bringing  our captain to the ship; and though I started and blushed red as he  recognised me--a descendant of the Barrys--in this degrading posture, I  promise you that the sight of Fagan's face was most welcome to me, for  it assured me that a friend was near me. Before that I was so melancholy  that I would certainly have deserted had I found the means, and had not  the inevitable marines kept a watch to prevent any such escapes.  Fagan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of  acquaintance; it was not until two days afterwards, and when we had  bidden adieu to old Ireland and were standing out to sea, that he called  me into his cabin, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me  news, which I much wanted, of my family. 'I had news of you in Dublin,'  he said. ''Faith you've begun early, like your father's son; and I think  you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write  home to your poor mother? She has sent a half-dozen letters to you at  Dublin.'    I said I had asked for letters at the post-office, but there were none  for Mr. Redmond. I did not like to add that I had been ashamed, after  the first week, to write to my mother.    'We must write to her by the pilot,' said he, 'who will leave us in  two hours; and you can tell her that you are safe, and married to Brown  Bess.' I sighed when he talked about being married; on which he said  with a laugh, 'I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Brady's  Town.'    'Is Miss Brady well?' said I; and indeed, could hardly utter it, for I  certainly WAS thinking about her: for, though I had forgotten her in  the gaieties of Dublin, I have always found adversity makes man very  affectionate.    'There's only seven Miss Bradys now,' answered Fagan, in a solemn voice.  'Poor Nora'--    'Good heavens! what of her?' I thought grief had killed her.    'She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console  herself with a husband. She's now Mrs. John Quin.'    'Mrs. John Quin! Was there ANOTHER Mr. John Quin?' asked I, quite  wonder-stricken.    'No; the very same one, my boy. He recovered from his wound. The ball  you hit him with was not likely to hurt him. It was only made of tow.  Do you think the Bradys would let you kill fifteen hundred a year out of  the family?' And then Fagan further told me that, in order to get me out  of the way--for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry  from fear of me--the plan of the duel had been arranged. 'But hit him  you certainly did, Redmond, and with a fine thick plugget of tow; and  the fellow was so frightened, that he was an hour in coming to. We  told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made; she  despatched a half-score of letters to Dublin after you, but I suppose  addressed them to you in your real name, by which you never thought to  ask for them.'    'The coward!' said I (though, I confess, my mind was considerably  relieved at the thoughts of not having killed him). 'And did the Bradys  of Castle Brady consent to admit a poltroon like that into one of the  most ancient and honourable families in the world?'    'He has paid off your uncle's mortgage,' said Fagan; 'he gives Nora  a coach-and-six; he is to sell out, and Lieutenant Ulick Brady of the  Militia is to purchase his company. That coward of a fellow has been the  making of your uncle's family. 'Faith! the business was well done.' And  then, laughing, he told me how Mick and Ulick had never let him out  of their sight, although he was for deserting to England, until the  marriage was completed and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  'Are you in want of cash, my boy?' continued the good-natured Captain.  'You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Quin  for my share, and while they last you shall never want.'    And so he bade me sit down and write a letter to my mother, which I did  forthwith in very sincere and repentant terms, stating that I had been  guilty of extravagances, that I had not known until that moment under  what a fatal error I had been labouring, and that I had embarked for  Germany as a volunteer. The letter was scarcely finished when the pilot  sang out that he was going on shore; and he departed, taking with him,  from many an anxious fellow besides myself, our adieux to friends in old  Ireland.    Although I was called Captain Barry for many years of my life, and have  been known as such by the first people of Europe, yet I may as well  confess I had no more claim to the title than many a gentleman who  assumes it, and never had a right to an epaulet, or to any military  decoration higher than a corporal's stripe of worsted. I was made  corporal by Fagan during our voyage to the Elbe, and my rank was  confirmed on TERRA FIRMA. I was promised a halbert, too, and afterwards,  perhaps, an ensigncy, if I distinguished myself; but Fate did not intend  that I should remain long an English soldier: as shall appear presently.  Meanwhile, our passage was very favourable; my adventures were told  by Fagan to his brother officers, who treated me with kindness; and my  victory over the big chairman procured me respect from my comrades of  the fore-deck. Encouraged and strongly exhorted by Fagan, I did my duty  resolutely; but, though affable and good-humoured with the men, I never  at first condescended to associate with such low fellows: and, indeed,  was called generally amongst them 'my Lord.' I believe it was the  ex-link-boy, a facetious knave, who gave me the title; and I felt that I  should become such a rank as well as any peer in the kingdom.    It would require a greater philosopher and historian than I am to  explain the causes of the famous Seven Years' War in which Europe was  engaged; and, indeed, its origin has always appeared to me to be  so complicated, and the books written about it so amazingly hard to  understand, that I have seldom been much wiser at the end of a chapter  than at the beginning, and so shall not trouble my reader with any  personal disquisitions concerning the matter. All I know is, that after  His Majesty's love of his Hanoverian dominions had rendered him most  unpopular in his English kingdom, with Mr. Pitt at the head of the  anti-German war-party, all of a sudden, Mr. Pitt becoming Minister,  the rest of the empire applauded the war as much as they had hated it  before. The victories of Dettingen and Crefeld were in every-body's  mouths, and 'the Protestant hero,' as we used to call the godless old  Frederick of Prussia, was adored by us as a saint, a very short time  after we had been about to make war against him in alliance with the  Empress-queen. Now, somehow, we were on Frederick's side: the Empress,  the French, the Swedes, and the Russians, were leagued against us; and  I remember, when the news of the battle of Lissa came even to our remote  quarter of Ireland, we considered it as a triumph for the cause of  Protestantism, and illuminated and bonfired, and had a sermon at church,  and kept the Prussian king's birthday; on which my uncle would get  drunk: as indeed on any other occasion. Most of the low fellows enlisted  with myself were, of course, Papists (the English army was filled with  such, out of that never-failing country of ours), and these, forsooth,  were fighting the battles of Protestantism with Frederick; who was  belabouring the Protestant Swedes and the Protestant Saxons, as well as  the Russians of the Greek Church, and the Papist troops of the Emperor  and the King of France. It was against these latter that the English  auxiliaries were employed, and we know that, be the quarrel what it may,  an Englishman and a Frenchman are pretty willing to make a fight of it.    We landed at Cuxhaven, and before I had been a month in the Electorate  I was transformed into a tall and proper young soldier, and having a  natural aptitude for military exercise, was soon as accomplished at the  drill as the oldest sergeant in the regiment. It is well, however, to  dream of glorious war in a snug arm-chair at home; ay, or to make it as  an officer, surrounded by gentlemen, gorgeously dressed, and cheered by  chances of promotion. But those chances do not shine on poor fellows in  worsted lace: the rough texture of our red coats made me ashamed when I  saw an officer go by; my soul used to shudder when, on going the rounds,  I would hear their voices as they sat jovially over the mess-table;  my pride revolted at being obliged to plaster my hair with flour and  candle-grease, instead of using the proper pomatum for a gentleman.  Yes, my tastes have always been high and fashionable, and I loathed the  horrid company in which I was fallen. What chances had I of promotion?  None of my relatives had money to buy me a commission, and I became soon  so low-spirited, that I longed for a general action and a ball to finish  me, and vowed that I would take some opportunity to desert.    When I think that I, the descendant of the kings of Ireland, was  threatened with a caning by a young scoundrel who had just joined from  Eton College--when I think that he offered to make me his footman, and  that I did not, on either occasion, murder him! On the first occasion I  burst into tears (I do not care to own it) and had serious thoughts of  committing suicide, so great was my mortification. But my kind friend  Fagan came to my aid in the circumstance, with some very timely  consolation. 'My poor boy,' said he, 'you must not take the matter to  heart so. Caning is only a relative disgrace. Young Ensign Fakenham was  flogged himself at Eton School only a month ago: I would lay a wager  that his scars are not yet healed. You must cheer up, my boy; do your  duty, be a gentleman, and no serious harm can fall on you.' "]]]
