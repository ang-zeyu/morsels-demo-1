[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36866"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 3 (of 8) (#15)"],[1," GENERAL GATACRE      On the 18th of December, General Gatacre withdrew from Putter's Kraal,  his original advance post, to Sterkstroom. At this time, in the central  sphere, Generals French and Gatacre, while guarding the lines of  communication, were merely waiting the turn of events. Owing to a series  of successful skirmishes, in which a patrol under Captain de  Montmorency, V.C., was engaged, the Boers thought discretion the better  part of valour, and cleared out of Dordrecht, with the result that on  the 24th of December Colonel Dalgety, of the Cape Mounted Rifles, with  his force occupied the town. At Bushman's Hoek were four companies of  the Royal Scots, two 12-pounders, three Maxim guns, about 800 Kaffrarian  Rifles, and about thirty Engineers. Owing to scarcity of water General  Gatacre's force had to be divided, the rest remaining at Sterkstroom.  There water had to be conveyed by rail, whence, with some difficulty, it  was hauled to Bushman's Hoek in water-tanks by mules. The railway in  these parts, a species of South African switchback on two narrow rails,  rambled up hill and down dale with engaging ingenuity. Though water was  dependent on the trains, fresh foods were sometimes obtainable. At  neighbouring farms it was possible to purchase butter-milk, grain, and  bread, but to \"go a marketing\" it was necessary to start in full  marching order, for there was no knowing when the Boers might block the  road, or what nefarious tricks might be taking place. It was quite  impossible to be even with the Dutchmen's ruses. For instance, one who  knew their ways said that if a Boer horse went lame or knocked up,  twenty chances to one a \"loyal\" would place a mount at his disposal,  give him bed, \"tucker,\" forage, &c., while he would also watch the  horizon for the approach of the military, and should they come the Boer  would be a man of peace, without uniform, arms, or anything else to  incriminate him. Therefore, as may be imagined, life was never too  easy-going. The day began at 3.15 A.M., but night itself, short as it  was, was scarcely restful. The troops slept with their straps on, 150  rounds of ammunition apiece by their side, in hourly expectation of  attack. Niceties of the toilet were unknown, and gallant fellows with  black faces and whiskers whose acquaintance with water was only weekly,  were the rule. Some even presented the appearance of opera-house  brigands, having locks so redundant and long, that jocose Tommies  suggested writing home to their sweethearts for the loan of hairpins.    In other respects the daily routine was not unpleasant. Bullocks and  sheep were killed regularly and found their way into the camp-kettle;  bread was still served out, and supplemented with biscuits. For  recreation there was football; and to enliven the spirits there were  four cheery pipers, who at night-time made the welkin ring, and caused  their compatriots to start up and indulge in reels and Highland flings,  and almost to forget that they were in the land of the enemy.    On the 29th, a pouring day, Captain de Montmorency started with his  scouts and thirty Cape Mounted Rifles in hope of catching the enemy. But  the Boers, under cover of the mist, took themselves off in the direction  of the Barkly East district.    On the 30th of December a hundred of Flannigan's Squadron of Brabant's  Horse had a smart brush with an equal number of Dutchmen, who, however,  were promptly reinforced. Thereupon the squadron retired, but  unfortunately Lieutenant Milford Turner and twenty-seven men were left  behind in a donga which none would leave, determining to remain there  and protect Lieutenant Warren of Brabant's Horse, who was wounded. To  their assistance went Captain Goldsworthy the next day, accompanied by  Captain de Montmorency's scouts, 110 men, and four guns. These arrived  on the scene so early as to surprise the Boers, who, after having been  kept at bay by the small force of Colonials, had continued to snipe at  them from a distance throughout the night. A sharp fight now ensued,  and, after some clever manoeuvring on both sides, the enemy retired  with the loss of eight killed, while the party in the donga was  relieved, and returned in safety to Dordrecht. The rescue was highly  exciting, as the Boers were finally sent helter-skelter just as our men,  worn out with a night's anxiety in the nullah, had almost given up hope  of release. As it was, they were restored to their friends in camp amid  a storm of cheers.    Early on the 3rd of January a force was sent out from the advanced camp  at Bushman's Hoek to meet a hostile horde that occupied Molteno. The  Boers had mounted a big gun on a kopje in front of Bushman's Hoek, and  from thence commenced to fire at about eight o'clock. Around the  neighbourhood the Boers were seen to be swarming; therefore the force,  composed of Kaffrarian Rifles, Mounted Infantry of the Berkshire  Regiment, and the Cape Mounted Police, at once engaged them.    [Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL SIR W. F. GATACRE, K.C.B.    Photo by Elliott & Fry, London.]    Two hours later General Gatacre and Staff started from headquarters with  half a battalion of the Royal Scots and the 78th Battery of Artillery.  The Boers from their point of vantage were firing from the hill on  which was placed their big gun, and they continued to fire on the  Infantry as they advanced over an undulating plain to right of  Cypherghat, whence the population had fled panic-stricken at the outset  of the fight. Fortunately the hostile shells burst without doing damage,  and the troops continued to advance.    The Artillery made a detour to the right, secured a commanding position  on a kopje, and from thence began a ten minutes' cannonade which had the  effect of silencing the Boers. They withdrew their gun and retreated,  the bulk of their force now advancing, now retiring, to cover the  movement.    At this juncture the Mounted Infantry, which had worked its way round  with a view to outflanking the enemy's position, came on the scene only  to learn of the withdrawal. This was carried on without check owing to  our lack of cavalry. While General Gatacre's force were thus engaged,  the enemy was making a determined attack on 140 men of the Cape Police  and 60 men of the Kaffrarian Rifles at Molteno. They were splendidly  repulsed, though the Police had an unpleasant experience. Five shells  dropped into their camp, but all miraculously escaped injury. The Boers  now retired as mysteriously as they had come, and none knew the exact  reason for their arrival. It was suspected that it was a \"slim\" trick to  draw General Gatacre into another trap.    A strong force left Sterkstroom before dawn on the morning of the 8th of  January for the dual purpose of reconnoitring in the direction of  Stormberg and taking possession of the meal and flour from Molteno  Mills. The force comprised the Derbyshire Regiment, the 77th and 79th  Field Batteries, 400 mounted men of the Cape Police and Berkshire  Regiment, the Kaffrarian Rifles, and the Frontier Rifles. The expedition  was eminently successful. The operation of removing the food-stuffs and  detaching the vital parts of the machinery of the mills was carried on  under the protection of the Derbyshire Regiment and the 77th Battery.  That of reconnoitring was undertaken by the force under Colonel  Jefferies, R.A., and it was discovered that the Boers, who were supposed  to have evacuated Stormberg, were within a two-mile range. A survey of  the Boer position was made by the Engineers, and the troops returned to  camp well satisfied with the result of their labours.    No larger martial moves could be attempted, for General Gatacre lived in  a chronic state of suspended activity for lack of reinforcements. The  Dutchmen had now fallen back from Stormberg, leaving only a small  garrison there, and established themselves near Burghersdorp. The Boer  strength in this district was estimated at about 4500, a force made up  for the most part of Free Staters and Cape rebels. On the 18th of  January General Gatacre moved some three hundred of all ranks from  Bushman's Hoek to Loperberg, and the 74th Field Battery, with one  company of Mounted Infantry, from Sterkstroom to Bushman's Hoek. The  Boers continued a system of annoyance and petty progress by destroying  railway bridges in the neighbourhood of Steynsburg and Kromhoogte, about  eleven miles from Sterkstroom, and damaging portions of the line near  Stormberg.    Though General Gatacre's Division was merely the shadow of the division  it should have been, and his strength, such as it was, materially  thinned by reverse, he had at his elbow one man who was a host in  himself. This man was Captain de Montmorency. He kept the Boers who were  holding Stormberg in a simmering state of excitement and suspense. He  and his active party of scouts were perpetually reconnoitring and  skirmishing and emerging from very tight corners, getting back to camp  by what in vulgar phrase is called \"the skin of their teeth.\" One of  these narrow escapes was experienced on the 16th January, when Captain  de Montmorency and his men went out from Molteno to gain information  regarding the whereabouts of the enemy. A smart combat was the result of  their efforts, and when they were almost surrounded Major Heylen with  sixty Police came to the rescue, and the whole force, after some  animated firing, returned safely to Molteno, plus horses, mares, foals,  and oxen, which had been captured from the enemy.    At this time a curious correspondence took place between the Boer  Commandant, General Olivier, and General Gatacre. It was a species of  Dutch _tu quoque_--the Boer leader thinking to charge the British one  with the same tricks as those in which his countrymen had been detected.    General Olivier solemnly declared that a store of ammunition had been  found in an abandoned British waggon--a waggon marked with red crosses  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3689"],[0,"Letters of Franz Liszt -- Volume 1 (#15)"],[1,"arrive at Weimar between the 10th and 15th of May, in order to  prepare a suitable house or suite of apartments for the Princess.    I should be so pleased if you had an opportunity of getting to  know the P. W. She is without doubt an uncommonly and thoroughly  brilliant example of soul and mind and understanding (with  immense esprit as well).    It won't take you long to understand that henceforth I can dream  of very little personal ambition and future wrapped up in myself.  In political relations serfdom may have an end, but the dominion  of one soul over another in the region of spirit, is not that  indestructible?...You, my dear, honored friend, will assuredly  not answer this question with a negative.    In three weeks I hope we shall see each other again. Be so good  as to present my respects to our young Duke. What you tell me of  him pleases me. As soon as possible you shall hear more, and more  fully, from me, but do not write to me till then, as my address  meanwhile will be very uncertain. But continue to love me, as I  love and honor you.    F. Liszt        55. To Bernhard Cossmann in Baden-Baden    [The addressee became in 1850 solo-violoncellist and chamber  virtuoso in Weimar, and, later, in Moscow, and has been, since  1878, a Professor at the Hoch Conservatorium at Frankfort-on-  Maine.]    Circumstances! Conditions! My dear sir, these are now the very  ceremonious expressions and excuses of theatrical and directorial  beings. Unfortunately that is the case here too, although our  dear Weymar continuing free, not only from the real cholera, but  also from the slighter, but somewhat disagreeable, periodical  political cholerina, may peacefully dream by its elm,  yet...yet...I am sorry to say I am obliged not to answer your  kind letter affirmatively. Should circumstances and conditions,  however, turn out as I wish, then the Weymar band would consider  it an honor and a pleasure to possess you, my dear sir, as soon  as possible as one of its members.    Meanwhile accept the assurance of high regard of yours very  sincerely,    F. Liszt    Weymar, September 18th, 1848        56. To Carl Reinecke    [The present conductor of the Gewandhaus Concerts in Leipzig  (born 1824), and celebrated composer, pianist, and conductor]    Dear Sir,    Your kind letter has given me much pleasure, and the prospect  which you hold out to me, of seeing you soon again at Weymar, is  very agreeable to me. But come soon, and if possible for a few  days; I on my side shall certainly do all I can to prolong your  stay here and make it seem short to you. The promised Concerto  interests me keenly; it will be sure to give us ample material  for musical talks, and perhaps after many a talk we shall set to  work again and both write a new Concerto.    Would not the best results of criticism altogether be to incite  to new creation?    However that may be, do not put off too long taking up your  quarters at the Erbprinz, and rest assured that your visit is  much desired by me.    Yours very sincerely,    F. Liszt    Weymar, March 25th, 1849    My very best thanks for the splendid stuff for the coat, which  will give me quite an important, well-to-do, stately appearance!        57. To Count Sandor Teleky(?)    [The original (without address) in the possession of Count Albert  Amadei in Vienna.--The recipient of this letter was presumably  Count Teleky, a friend of Liszt's, who often accompanied the  latter on his triumphal European journeys, and who was himself an  active musician and literary man. He died in June, 1892.]    I have to give you threefold thanks, dear Count, and I feel that  I can undisguisedly do so! Your verses, in addition to your prose  and music, are three times welcome to me at Weymar, and the  Fantaisie dedicated to the royal hours of leisure of H.R.H. has  also charmed my leisure hours, as rare as they are modest.    If it would not be a trouble to you to come to Weymar, it would  be most kind of you to give us the pleasure of your company for a  day or two during our theatrical season, which concludes on the  15th of June. We could then chat and make music at our ease (with  or without damages, ad libitum), and if the fantasy took us, why  should we not go to some new Fantasie of leisure on the \"Traum-  lied (dream song) of Tony, [No doubt meaning Baron Augusz,  Liszt's intimate friend at Szegzard, who died in 1878.] for  instance, at the hour when our peaceable inhabitants are  sleeping, dreaming, or thinking of nothing? We two should at  least want to make a pair.    May I beg you, dear Count, to recall me most humbly to the  indulgent remembrance of your charming and witty neighbor  [Nachbarin, feminine.] of the Erbprinz, and accept once more my  most cordial expressions for yourself?    F. Liszt    Weymar, May 5th, 1849        58. To Belloni(?)    [The letter written apparently to Belloni (who has already been  mentioned) was, like the present one, published by Wilhelm  Tappert, in a German translation and in an incomplete form, in  the Neue Musik-Zeitung (Cologne, Tonger) of October 1st, 1881.  The editor unfortunately could not obtain possession of it  complete and in the original. According to Tappert, a Belgian  musical paper pronounced it spurious, for reasons unknown to the  former.]    Weimar, May 14th, 1849    Dear B.,    Richard Wagner, a Dresden conductor, has been here since  yesterday. That is a man of wonderful genius, such a brain-  splitting genius indeed as beseems this country,--a new and  brilliant appearance in Art. Late events in Dresden have forced  him to a decision in the carrying out of which I am firmly  resolved to help him with all my might. When I have had a long  talk with him, you shall hear what we have devised and what must  also be thoroughly realized. In the first place we want to create  a success for a grand, heroic, enchanting musical work, the score  of which was completed a year ago. [Lohengrin.] Perhaps this  could be done in London? Chorley, [Chorley (1808-72) had  considerable influence in London as author, critic, and writer in  the Athenoeum.] for instance, might be very helpful to him in  this undertaking. If Wagner next winter could go to Paris backed  up by this success, the doors of the Opera would stand open to  him, no matter with what he might knock. It is happily not  necessary for me to go into long further discussions with you;  you understand, and must learn whether there is at this moment in  London an English theater (for the Italian Opera would not help  our friend!), and whether there is any prospect that a grand and  beautiful work from a master hand could have any success there.    [It was not in London, but in Weimar, as is well known, that the  first performance of \"Lohengrin\" took place (on August 28th,  1850). It was not until twenty-five years later that London made  acquaintance with Wagner's work on the stage, in the Italian  Opera and with Nicolini in the title-role; and the composer  himself heard it for the first time in Vienna on May 15th, 1861.]    Let me have an answer to this as quickly as possible. Later on--  that is, about the end of the month--Wagner will pass through  Paris. You will see him, and he will talk with you direct about  the tendency and expansion of the whole plan, and will be  heartily grateful for every kindness. Write soon and help me as  ever. It is a question of a noble end, toward the fulfillment of  which everything must tend.        59. To Carl Reinecke    Weymar, May 30th, 1849    Thank you much, dear M. Reinecke, for your welcome lines, and I  am glad to hope that you are happily arrived at Bremen, which  ought to be proud to possess you. The musical taste of that town  has always been held up to me, and I feel assured that the  inhabitants will have the good taste to appreciate you at your  full value, and that you will create a good and fine position for  yourself there without many obstacles.    Wagner, who will probably be obliged to lose his post at Dresden  in consequence of recent events, has been spending some days with  me here. Unluckily the news of the warrant against him arrived  the day of the performance of \"Tannhauser\", which prevented him  from being present. By this time he must have arrived in Paris,  where he will assuredly find a more favorable field for his  dramatic genius. With the aid of success he will end, as I have  often said, by being acknowledged as a great German composer in  Germany, on condition that his works are first heard in Paris or  London, following the example of Meyerbeer, to say nothing of  Gluck, Weber, and Handel!    Wagner expressed his regret to me that he had not been able to  send a better reply to the few lines of introduction which I had  given you for him. If ever you should be in the same place with  him do not fail to go and see him for me, and you may be sure of  being well received.    I am very much obliged to you for having spoken of me to Schumann  in such a manner as he at least ought to think of me. It  interested me much to make acquaintance with his composition of  the epilogue to \"Faust\". If he publishes it I shall try to have  it performed here, either at the Court or at the theater. In  passing lately through Frankfort I had a glance at the score of  \"Genoveva\", a performance of which had been announced to me at  Leipzig for the middle of May at latest. I am very much afraid  that Schumann will have a struggle with the difficulties and  delays which usually occur in trying to get any lofty work  performed. One would say that a bad fairy, in order sometimes to  counterbalance the works of genius, gives a magic success to the  most vulgar works and presides over the propagation of them,  favoring those whom inspiration has disdained, in order to push  its elect into the shade. That is no reason for discouragement,  for what matters the sooner or the later?    A thousand thanks for your exact and obliging packet of cigars."]]]
