Matrimony, which was once          a fixed fact among us, must lose its present slippery foot-  65:27   ing, and man must find permanence and peace in a more          spiritual adherence.            The mental chemicalization, which has brought con-  65:30   jugal infidelity to the surface, will assuredly throw off          this evil, and marriage will become purer when the scum          is gone.            Thou art right, immortal Shakespeare, great poet of          humanity:  66:3           Sweet are the uses of adversity;               Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,               Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.                                 Salutary sorrow    66:6    Trials teach mortals not to lean on a material staff, -          a broken reed, which pierces the heart. We do not          half remember this in the sunshine of joy  66:9    and prosperity. Sorrow is salutary. Through          great tribulation we enter the kingdom. Trials are          proofs of God's care. Spiritual development germi-  66:12   nates not from seed sown in the soil of material hopes,          but when these decay, Love propagates anew the higher          joys of Spirit, which have no taint of earth. Each suc-  66:15   cessive stage of experience unfolds new views of divine          goodness and love.            Amidst gratitude for conjugal felicity, it is well to re-  66:18   member how fleeting are human joys. Amidst conjugal          infelicity, it is well to hope, pray, and wait patiently on          divine wisdom to point out the path.                               Patience is wisdom    66:21   Husbands and wives should never separate if there          is no Christian demand for it. It is better to await the          logic of events than for a wife precipitately  66:24   to leave her husband or for a husband to          leave his wife. If one is better than the other, as must          always be the case, the other pre-eminently needs good  66:27   company. Socrates considered patience salutary under          such circumstances, making his Xantippe a discipline for          his philosophy.                               The gold and dross    66:30   Sorrow has its reward. It never leaves us          where it found us. The furnace separates          the gold from the dross that the precious metal may  67:1    be graven with the image of God. The cup our Father          hath given, shall we not drink it and learn the lessons  67:3    He teaches?                              Weathering the storm            When the ocean is stirred by a storm, then the clouds          lower, the wind shrieks through the tightened shrouds,  67:6    and the waves lift themselves into mountains.          We ask the helmsman: \"Do you know your          course? Can you steer safely amid the storm?\" He  67:9    answers bravely, but even the dauntless seaman is not          sure of his safety; nautical science is not equal to the          Science of Mind. Yet, acting up to his highest under-  67:12   standing, firm at the post of duty, the mariner works on          and awaits the issue. Thus should we deport ourselves          on the seething ocean of sorrow. Hoping and work-  67:15   ing, one should stick to the wreck, until an irresistible          propulsion precipitates his doom or sunshine gladdens          the troubled sea.                                 Spiritual power    67:18   The notion that animal natures can possibly give force          to character is too absurd for consideration, when we          remember that through spiritual ascendency  67:21   our Lord and Master healed the sick, raised          the dead, and commanded even the winds and waves to          obey him. Grace and Truth are potent beyond all other  67:24   means and methods.            The lack of spiritual power in the limited demonstration          of popular Christianity does not put to silence the labor  67:27   of centuries. Spiritual, not corporeal, consciousness is          needed. Man delivered from sin, disease, and death          presents the true likeness or spiritual ideal.                             Basis of true religion    67:30   Systems of religion and medicine treat of physical pains          and pleasures, but Jesus rebuked the suffering from any          such cause or effect. The epoch approaches when the  68:1    understanding of the truth of being will be the basis of          true religion. At present mortals progress slowly for  68:3    fear of being thought ridiculous. They are          slaves to fashion, pride, and sense. Some-          time we shall learn how Spirit, the great architect, has  68:6    created men and women in Science. We ought to weary          of the fleeting and false and to cherish nothing which          hinders our highest selfhood.    68:9    Jealousy is the grave of affection. The presence of          mistrust, where confidence is due, withers the flowers          of Eden and scatters love's petals to decay. Be not  68:12   in haste to take the vow \"until death do us part.\"          Consider its obligations, its responsibilities, its rela-          tions to your growth and to your influence on other  68:15   lives.                            Insanity and agamogenesis            I never knew more than one individual who believed          in agamogenesis; she was unmarried, a lovely charac-  68:18   ter, was suffering from incipient insanity, and          a Christian Scientist cured her. I have named          her case to individuals, when casting my bread upon  68:21   the waters, and it may have caused the good to ponder          and the evil to hatch their silly innuendoes and lies, since          salutary causes sometimes incur these effects. The per-  68:24   petuation of the floral species by bud or cell-division is          evident, but I discredit the belief that agamogenesis          applies to the human species.                              God's creation intact    68:27   Christian Science presents unfoldment, not accretion;          it manifests no material growth from molecule to mind,          but an impartation of the divine Mind to man  68:30   and the universe. Proportionately as human          generation ceases, the unbroken links of eternal, har-          monious being will be spiritually discerned; and man,  69:1    not of the earth earthly but coexistent with God, will          appear. The scientific fact that man and the universe  69:3    are evolved from Spirit, and so are spiritual, is as fixed in          divine Science as is the proof that mortals gain the sense          of health only as they lose the sense of sin and disease.  69:6    Mortals can never understand God's creation while believ-          ing that man is a creator. God's children already created          will be cognized only as man finds the truth of being.  69:9    Thus it is that the real, ideal man appears in proportion          as the false and material disappears. No longer to marry          or to be \"given in marriage\" neither closes man's con-  69:12   tinuity nor his sense of increasing number in God's in-          finite plan. Spiritually to understand that there is but          one creator, God, unfolds all creation, confirms the Scrip-  69:15   tures, brings the sweet assurance of no parting, no pain,          and of man deathless and perfect and eternal.            If Christian Scientists educate their own offspring  69:18   spiritually, they can educate others spiritually and not          conflict with the scientific sense of God's creation. Some          day the child will ask his parent: \"Do you keep the First  69:21   Commandment? Do you have one God and creator, or          is man a creator?\" If the father replies, \"God creates          man through man,\" the child may ask, \"Do you teach  69:24   that Spirit creates materially, or do you declare that          Spirit is infinite, therefore matter is out of the ques-          tion?\" Jesus said, \"The children of this world marry,  69:27   and are given in marriage: But they which shall be ac-          counted worthy to obtain that world, and the resur-          rection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in  69:30   marriage.\"                  CHAPTER IV - CHRISTIAN SCIENCE VERSUS SPIRITUALISM            And when they shall say unto you,          Seek unto them that have familiar spirits,          And unto wizards that peep and that mutter;          Should not a people seek unto their God? - ISAIAH.            Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he          shall never see death. Then said the Jews unto him, Now we          know that thou hast a devil. - JOHN.                             The infinite one Spirit    70:1    MORTAL existence is an enigma. Every day is a          mystery. The testimony of the corporeal senses  70:3    cannot inform us what is real and what is delusive, but          the revelations of Christian Science unlock the treasures          of Truth. Whatever is false or sinful can  70:6    never enter the atmosphere of Spirit. There          is but one Spirit. Man is never God, but spiritual man,          made in God's likeness, reflects God. In this scientific  70:9    reflection the Ego and the Father are inseparable. The          supposition that corporeal beings are spirits, or that there          are good and evil spirits, is a mistake.                            Real and unreal identity    70:12   The divine Mind maintains all identities, from a blade          of grass to a star, as distinct and eternal. The          questions are: What are God's identities?  70:15   What is Soul? Does life or soul exist in the thing          formed?    71:1    Nothing is real and eternal, - nothing is Spirit, - but          God and His idea. Evil has no reality. It is neither  71:3    person, place, nor thing, but is simply a belief, an illusion          of material sense.

This is Raffaello's chief excellence; and he may justly be  denominated the painter of mind. If in this faculty be included all that  is difficult, philosophical, and sublime, who shall compete with him in  the sovereignty of art?    Another quality which Raffaello possessed in an eminent degree was  grace, a quality which may be said to confer an additional charm on  beauty itself. Apelles, who was supremely endowed with it among the  ancients, was so vain of the possession that he preferred it to every  other attribute of art.[49] Raffaello rivalled him among the moderns,  and thence obtained the name of the new Apelles. Something might,  perhaps, be advantageously added to the forms of his children, and other  delicate figures which he represented, but nothing can add to their  gracefulness, for if it were attempted to be carried further it would  degenerate into affectation, as we find in Parmegiano. His Madonnas  enchant us, as Mengs observes, not because they possess the perfect  lineaments of the Medicean Venus, or of the celebrated daughter of  Niobe; but because the painter in their portraits and in their  expressive smiles, has personified modesty, maternal love, purity of  mind, and, in a word, grace itself. Nor did he impress this quality on  the countenance alone, but distributed it throughout the figure in its  attitude, gesture, and action, and in the folds of the drapery, with a  dexterity which may be admired, but can never be rivalled. His freedom  of execution was a component part of this grace, which indeed vanishes  as soon as labour and study appear; for it is with the painter as with  the orator, in whom a natural and spontaneous eloquence delights us,  while we turn away with indifference from an artificial and studied  harangue.    In regard to the province of colour, Raffaello must yield the palm to  Titian and Correggio, although he himself excelled Michelangiolo and  many others. His frescos may rank with the first works of other schools  in that line: not so his pictures in oil. In the latter he availed  himself of the sketches of Giulio, which were composed with a degree of  hardness and timidity; and though finished by Raffaello, they have  frequently lost the lustre of his last touch. This defect was not  immediately apparent, and if Raffaello's life had been prolonged, he  would have been aware of the injuries his pictures received from the  lapse of time, and would not have finished them in so light a manner. He  is on this account more admired in his first subject in the Vatican,  painted under Julius II., than in those he executed under Leo X., for  being there pressed by a multiplicity of business, and an idea of the  importance of a grander style, he became less rich and firm in his  colouring. That, however, he excelled in these respects is evinced by  his portraits, when not having an opportunity of displaying his  invention, composition, and beautiful style of design, he appears  ambitious to distinguish himself by his colouring. In this respect his  two portraits of Julius II. are truly admirable, the Medicean and the  Corsinian: that of Leo X. between the two cardinals; and above all, in  the opinion of an eminent judge, Renfesthein, that of Bindo Altoviti, in  the possession of his noble descendants at Florence, by many regarded as  a portrait of Raphael himself.[50] The heads in his Transfiguration are  esteemed the most perfect he ever painted, and Mengs extols the  colouring of them as eminently beautiful. If there be any exception, it  is in the complexion of the principal female, of a greyish tint, as is  often the case in his delicate figures; in which he is therefore  considered to excel less than in the heads of his men. Mengs has made  many exceptions to the chiaroscuro of Raffaello, as compared with that  of Correggio, on which connoisseurs will form their own decision. We are  told that he disposed it with the aid of models of wax; and the relief  of his pictures, and the beautiful effect in his Heliodorus, and in the  Transfiguration, are ascribed to this mode of practice. To his  perspective, too, he was most attentive. De Piles found, in some of his  sketches, the scale of proportion.[51] It is affirmed by Algarotti, that  he did not attempt to paint _di sotto in su_. But to this opinion we may  oppose the example we find in the third arch of the gallery of the  Vatican, where there is a perspective of small columns, says Taja,  imitated _di sotto in su_. It is true, that in his larger works he  avoided it; and in order to preserve the appearance of nature, he  represented his pictures as painted on a tapestry, attached by means of  a running knot to the entablature of the room.    But all the great qualities which we have enumerated, would not have  procured for Raffaello such an extraordinary celebrity, if he had not  possessed a wonderful felicity in the invention and disposition of his  subjects, and this circumstance is, indeed, his highest merit. It may  with truth be said, that in aid of this object he availed himself of  every example, ancient and modern; and that these two requisites have  not since been so united in any other artist. He accomplishes in his  pictures that which every orator ought to aim at in his speech--he  instructs, moves, and delights us. This is an easy task to a narrator,  since he can regularly unfold to us the whole progress of an event. The  painter, on the contrary, has but the space of a moment to make himself  understood, and his talent consists in describing not only what is  passing, and what is likely to ensue, but that which has already  occurred. It is here that the genius of Raffaello triumphs. He embraces  the whole subject. From a thousand circumstances he selects those alone  which can interest us; he arranges the actors in the most expressive  manner; he invents the most novel modes of conveying much meaning by a  few touches; and numberless minute circumstances, all uniting in one  purpose, render the story not only intelligible, but palpable. Various  writers have adduced in example the S. Paul at Lystra, which is to be  seen in one of the tapestries of the Vatican. The artist has there  represented the sacrifice prepared for him and S. Barnabas his  companion, as to two gods, for having restored a lame man to the use of  his limbs. The altar, the attendants, the victims, the musicians, and  the axe, sufficiently indicate the intentions of the Lystrians. S. Paul,  who is in the act of tearing his robe, shews that he rejects and abhors  the sacrilegious honours, and is endeavouring to dissuade the populace  from persisting in them. But all this were vain, if it had not indicated  the miracle which had just happened, and which had given rise to the  event. Raffaello added to the group the lame man restored to the use of  his limbs, now easily recognized again by all the spectators. He stands  before the apostles rejoicing in his restoration; and raises his hands  in transport towards his benefactors, while at his feet lie the crutches  which had recently supported him, now cast away as useless. This had  been sufficient for any other artist; but Raffaello, who wished to carry  reality to the utmost point, has added a throng of people, who, in their  eager curiosity, remove the garment of the man, to behold his limbs  restored to their former state. Raffaello abounds with examples like  these, and he may be compared to some of the classical writers, who  afford the more matter for reflection the more they are studied. It is  sufficient to have noticed in the inventive powers of Raffaello, those  circumstances which have been less frequently remarked; the movement of  the passions, which is entirely the work of expression, the delight  which proceeds from poetical conceptions, or from graceful episodes, may  be said to speak for themselves, nor have any occasion to be pointed out  by us.    Other things might contribute to the beauty of his works, as unity,  sublimity, costume, and erudition; for which it is sufficient to refer  to those delightful poetical pieces, with which he adorned the gallery  of Leo X., and which were engraved by Lanfranco and Badalocchi, and are  called the Bible of Raffaello. In the Return of Jacob, who does not  immediately discover, in the number and variety of domestic animals, the  multitude of servants, and the women carrying with them their children,  a patriarchal family migrating from a long possessed abode into a new  territory? In the Creation of the World, where the Deity stretches out  his arms, and with one hand calls forth the sun and with the other the  moon, do we not see a grandeur, which, with the simplest expression,  awakes in us the most sublime ideas? And in the Adoration of the Golden  Calf, how could he better have represented the idolatrous ceremony, and  its departure from true religion, than by depicting the people as  carried away by an insane joy, and mad with fanaticism? In point of  erudition it is sufficient to notice the Triumph of David, which Taja  describes and compares with the ancient bassirelievi, and is inclined to  believe that there is not any thing in marble that excels the art and  skill of this picture. I am aware that on another occasion he has not  been exempted from blame, as when he repeated the figure of S. Peter out  of prison, which hurts the unity of the subject; and in assigning to  Apollo and to the muses instruments not proper to antiquity. Yet it is  the glory of Raffaello to have introduced into his pictures numberless  circumstances unknown to his predecessors, and to have left little to be  added by his successors.    In composition also he is at the head of his art. In every picture the  principal figure is obvious to the spectator; we have no occasion to  inquire for it; the groups,"]]]
