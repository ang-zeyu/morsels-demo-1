Then, on December 21, three were taken       in widely separated nets, and the species was then seen nearly       every day for a week. Such sporadic and unpredictable local       occurrences may indicate wide separation of the loosely-organized       foraging groups of this species. The call is a harsh, jaylike note.    _=Criniger phaeocephalus connectens=_ (Chasen and Kloss): Crestless  White-throated Bulbul.--_Specimens_, 31: Cocoa Research Station:  [Female], December 1, 1962, MCT 3406; [Male] testis 5 x 4 mm., 35.0 gm.,  July 31, 1962, MCT 2689; [Male], May 2, 1963, ADG 104; [Male], June 22,  1963, ADG 122. 12 mi.

Lamag: [Male], October 15,  1963, ADG 308.         This species of the primary forest was common both at Cocoa       Research Station and 12 miles north of Kalabakan. Although not       frequently seen, it was caught in mist nets with regularity.       Specimens taken near Kalabakan on November 8 and 15, 1962, were in       heavy molt.    _=Criniger finschii=_ Salvadori: Finsch's Bulbul.--_Specimens_, 9: Cocoa  Research Station: [Male] testis 5 x 4 mm., 23.1 gm., August 23, 1962,  MCT 2798; [Female], 24.4 gm., August 23, 1962, MCT 2799; [Male] testis 6  x 4 mm., 24.5 gm., September 13, 1962, MCT 2914; [Female], 24.0 gm.,  September 13, 1962, MCT 2915; [Male] testis 4 x 3 mm., September 24,  1962, MCT 2942; [Male] testis, 6 x 5 mm., September 26, 1962, MCT 2969;  [Female], September 27, 1962, MCT 2972; [Female], November 27, 1962, MCT  3341. 12 mi. N Kalabakan: [Female], October 19, 1962, heavy molt, MCT  3077.         This bulbul was common in the cocoa at the Cocoa Research Station.       It fed in the company of other bulbuls in shade trees (_Trema       orientalis_). The size of the testes of the males taken is       characteristic of the beginning or ending of the breeding season,       but ovaries of the females showed no signs of being in breeding       condition.         According to Smythies (1960:385), this species had never been taken       in North Borneo. These specimens, therefore, are the first recorded       from there. Specimens previously were saved from Sarawak and       Indonesian Borneo.    _=Hypsipetes criniger viridis=_ (Bonaparte): Hairy-backed  Bulbul.--_Specimens_, 26: Cocoa Research Station: [Male], September 26,  1962, MCT 2963; [Female], September 27, 1962, MCT 2971; [Female],  November 27, 1962, MCT 3337; [Male], November 27, 1962, MCT 3356;  [Female], July 7, 1963, ADG 169; [Male], June 14, 1963, ADG 139; [Male],  June 12, 1963, ADG 125. 12 mi.

I       saw these bulbuls darting out after insects from branches, much as       flycatchers would do, and have noticed a tendency toward       flycatching in other bulbuls, but not so commonly as in this       species. In using the name _Hypsipetes_ instead of _Microscelis_ I       follow Rand and Rabor (1959:102).    _=Hypsipetes malaccensis=_ Blyth: Streaked Bulbul.--_Specimens_, 4:  Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 8 x 5 mm., 41.0 gm., August 20,  1962, MCT 2787. 12 mi. N Kalabakan: [Female], October 19, 1962, MCT  3092. 5.5 mi. SW Tenom: [Male], December 22, 1962, MCT 3497; [Male],  December 22, 1962, MCT 3498.         I did not find this species common at any collecting locality.       Smythies (1957:707) considered it a lowland species, but its       occasional occurrence in the highlands is indicated by the specimen       from Tenom.         Deignan (_in_ Peters, 1960:291) regards _Hypsipetes virescens_ and       _Hypsipetes malaccensis_ as specifically distinct.    _=Hypsipetes charlottae perplexus=_ (Riley): Crested Olive  Bulbul.--_Specimens_, 5: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 5 x 3  mm., August 27, 1962, MCT 2818; [Male] testis 5 x 4 mm., September 25,  1962, MCT 2951; [Female], September 25, 1962, MCT 2952; [Male], November  27, 1962, MCT 3333; [Female] imm., 32.6 gm., July 22, 1962, MCT 2638.         This species was occasionally observed in the cocoa, where it fed       on berries of _Trema orientalis_. The size of the testes in males       taken in August suggests that the species had been breeding       earlier.    _=Hypsipetes flavalus connectens=_ (Sharpe): Ashy Bulbul.--_Specimens_,  7: 5.5 mi. SW Tenom: [Female], December 23, 1962, MCT 3508; [Female]  largest ova 1 mm., December 17, 1962, MCT 3447; [Male], December 17,  1962, MCT 3448; [Male] testis 4 x 3 mm., December 19, 1962, MCT 3466;  [Male], December 19, 1962, MCT 3467; [Male] testis 6 x 6 mm., December  20, 1962, MCT 3476; [Male] testis 5 x 4 mm., December 20, 1962, MCT  3477.         This was a common and conspicuous bird in the moss forest. Males       called and sang there. The call note sounds like the mew of a cat.       The Ashy Bulbul could easily be \"squeaked in,\" at which time it       approached silently. When observed in the forest it was noisy and       gregarious.    _=Aegithina viridissima viridissima=_ (Bonaparte): Green  Iora.--_Specimens_, 7: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] largest ovum 1  mm., 13.5 gm., August 10, 1962, MCT 2755; [Male] testis 8 x 5 mm., 14.8  gm., August 10, 1962, MCT 2756; sex?, 13.2 gm., August 25, 1962, MCT  2805; [Male], 12.5 gm., September 10, 1962, MCT 2895; [Female] 13.0 gm.,  September 14, 1962, MCT 2921; [Female], November 27, 1962, MCT 3345. 5.5  mi. SW Tenom: [Male], December 20, 1962, MCT 3479.         In the cocoa this abundant bird usually occurred in flocks of five       to 10 and fed 10 to 15 feet up in shade trees. On December 17, I       saw singing males in the moss forest at 4,000 feet, 5.5 miles       southwest of Tenom. This is considered a lowland species by       Smythies (1957:698).    _=Aegithina tiphia aequanimis=_ Bangs: Common Iora.--_Specimens_, 2:  Tenom: [Male], January 5, 1963, MCT 3581; [Male], January 5, 1963, MCT  3582.         Two were netted in secondary forest near Tenom.    _=Chloropsis cyanopogon cyanopogon=_ (Temminck): Lesser Green  Leafbird.--_Specimens_, 8: Cocoa Research Station: [Female], 19.8 gm.,  July 21, 1962, MCT 2630; [Male] testis 2 x 1 mm., 25.3 gm., July 21,  1962, MCT 2631; [Male] testis 8 x 5 mm., August 27, 1962, MCT 2819;  [Female], 22.2 gm., September 14, 1962, MCT 2923; [Female], November 27,  1962, MCT 3342; [Female], November 27, 1962, MCT 3352; [Female], April  28, 1963, ADG 77; [Female], May 28, 1963, ADG 116.         It was seen regularly in the cocoa at the research station and was       the most common leafbird.    _=Chloropsis sonnerati zosterops=_ Vigors: Greater Green  Leafbird.--_Specimens_, 2: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 3 x 2  mm., 45.8 gm., MCT 2707; [Male], 46.0 gm., August 8, 1962, MCT 2740.         It was seen many times in the cocoa.    _=Irena puella criniger=_ Sharpe: Fairy Bluebird.--_Specimens_, 10:  Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 3 x 1 mm., 63.6 gm., July 4, 1962,  heavy molt, MCT 2588; [Female], 70.3 gm., July 28, 1962, MCT 2680;  [Female], 69.8 gm., August 2, 1962, MCT 2711; [Male] testis 13 x 10  mm., 65.0 gm., August 2, 1962, MCT 2714; sex?, August 2, 1962, MCT 2715;  sex?, 64.5 gm., August 2, 1962, MCT 2716; [Female], June 15, 1963, ADG  143; [Female], July 11, 1963, ADG 189; [Female], June 27, 1963, ADG 163.  Tiger Estate: [Male], June 23, 1963, ADG 157.         This was a common species around the Research Station in the cocoa       and much-disturbed primary forest.    _=Erithacus cyane=_ (Pallas): Siberian Blue Robin.--_Specimen_, 1: 12  mi.

A young slave is  commonly addressed by his master and mistress as \"My Child.\" A slave  is seldom beaten or subjected to any punishment save scolding, and  he bears his part freely in the life of the family, sharing in its  labours and its recreations, its ill or its good fortunes. Nothing  in the dress or appearance of the slave distinguishes him from the  other members of the village.        The Family    Very few men have more than one wife. Occasionally a chief whose wife  has borne him no children during some years of married life, or has  found the labours of entertaining his guests beyond her strength,  will with her consent, or even at her request, take a second younger  wife. In such a case each wife has her own sleeping apartment within  the chief's large chamber, and the younger wife is expected to defer  to the older one, and to help her in the work of the house and of  the field. The second wife would be chosen of rather lower social  standing than the first wife, who in virtue of this fact maintains  her ascendancy more easily. A third wife is probably unknown; public  opinion does not easily condone a second wife, and would hardly  tolerate a third. In spite of the presence of slave women in the  houses, concubinage is not recognised or tolerated.    The choice of a wife is not restricted by the existence of any law  or custom prescribing marriage without or within any defined group;  that is to say, exogamous and endogamous groups do not exist. Incest  is regarded very seriously, and the forbidden degrees of kinship are  clearly defined. They are very similar to those recognised among  ourselves. A man may under no circumstances marry or have sexual  relations with his sister, mother, daughter, father's or mother's  sister or half sister, his brother's or sister's daughter; and in  the case of those women who stand to him in any of these relations  in virtue of adoption, the prohibitions and severe penalties are  if possible even more strictly enforced. First cousins may marry,  but such marriages are not regarded with favour, and certain special  ceremonies are necessitated; and it seems to be the general opinion  that such marriages are not likely to prove happy. Many young men of  the upper class marry girls of the same class belonging to neighbouring  villages of their own people, aid in some cases this choice falls  on a girl of a village of some other tribe. A marriage of the latter  kind is often encouraged by the chiefs and elder people, in order to  strengthen or to restore friendly relations between the villages.    The initiative is taken in nearly all cases by the youth. He begins  by paying attentions somewhat furtively to the girl who attracts his  fancy. He will often be found passing the evening in her company  in her parents' room. There he will display his skill with the  KELURI, or the Jew's harp, or sing the favourite love-song of the  people, varying the words to suit the occasion. If the girl looks  with favour on his advances, she manages to make the fact known to  him. Politeness demands that in any case he shall be supplied by the  women with lighted cigarettes. If the girl wishes him to stay, she  gives him a cigarette tied in a peculiar manner, namely by winding  the strip which confines its sheath of dried banana leaf close to  the narrow mouth-piece; whereas on all other occasions this strip is  wound about the middle of the cigarette. The young man thus encouraged  will repeat his visits. If his suit makes progress, he may hope that  the fair one will draw out with a pair of brass tweezers the hairs  of his eyebrows and lashes, while he reclines on his back with his  head in her lap. If these hairs are very few, the girl will remark  that some one else has been pulling them out, an imputation which  he repudiates. Or he complains of a headache, and she administers  scalp-massage by winding tufts of hair about her knuckles and sharply  tugging them. When the courtship has advanced to this stage, the girl  may attract her suitor to the room by playing on the Jew's harp,  with which she claims to be able to speak to him -- presumably the  language of the heart. The youth thus encouraged may presume to remain  beside his sweetheart till early morning, or to return to her side  when the old people have retired. When the affair has reached this  stage, it becomes necessary to secure the public recognition which  constitutes the relation a formal betrothal. The man charges some  elderly friend of either sex, in many cases his father or mother,  to inform the chief of his desire. The latter expresses a surprise  which is not always genuine; and, if the match is a suitable one,  he contents himself with giving a little friendly advice. But if  he is aware of any objections to the match he will point them out,  and though he will seldom forbid it in direct terms, he will know  how to cause the marriage to be postponed.    If the chief and parents favour the match, the young man presents  a brass gong or a valuable bead to the girl's family as pledge of  his sincerity. This is returned to him if for any reason beyond his  control the match is broken off. The marriage may take place with  very little delay; but during the interval between betrothal and  marriage the omens are anxiously observed and consulted. All accidents  affecting any members of the village are regarded as of evil omen,  the more so the more nearly the betrothed parties are concerned in  them. The cries of birds and deer are important; those heard about the  house are likely to be bad omens, and it is sought to compensate for  these by sending a man skilled in augury to seek good omens in the  jungle, such as the whistle of the Trogan and of the spider-hunter,  and the flight of the hawk from right to left high up in the sky. If  the omens are persistently and predominantly bad, the marriage is put  off for a year, and after the next harvest fresh omens are sought. The  man is encouraged in the meantime to absent himself from the village,  in the hope that he may form some other attachment. But if he remains  true and favourable omens are obtained, the marriage is celebrated if  possible at the close of the harvest. If the marriage takes place at  any other time, the feast will be postponed to the end of the following  harvest.[40] After the marriage the man lives with his wife in the room  of his father-in-law for one, two, or at most three years. During this  time he works in the fields of his father-in-law and generally helps  in the support of the household, showing great deference towards  his wife's parents. Before the end of the third year of marriage,  the young couple will acquire for themselves a room in the house and  village of the husband, in which they set up housekeeping on their  own account. In addition to these personal services rendered to the  parents of the bride, the man or his father and other relatives give  to the girl's parents at the time of the marriage various articles  which are valuable in proportion to the social standing of the parties,  and which are generally appropriated by the girl's parents.[41]    Divorce is rare but not unknown among the Kayans. The principal grounds  of divorce are misconduct, desertion, incompatibility of temper and  family quarrels; or a couple may terminate their state of wedlock  by mutual consent on payment of a moderate fine to the chief. Such  separation by mutual consent is occasioned not infrequently by the  sterility of the marriage, especially if the couple fails to obtain a  child for adoption; the parties hope to procure offspring by taking  new partners; for the desire for children and pride and joy in the  possession of them are strongly felt by all. The husband of a sterile  wife may leave the house for a long period, living in the jungle and  visiting other houses, in the hope that his wife may divorce him on  the ground of desertion, or give him ground for divorcing her. On  discovery of misconduct on the woman's part the husband will usually  divorce her; the man then retains all property accumulated since  the marriage, and the children are divided between the parents. The  co-respondent and respondent are fined by the chief, and half the  amount of the fine goes to the injured husband. Misconduct on the  part of the man must be flagrant before it constitutes a sufficient  ground for his divorce by his wife. In this case the same rules are  followed. Among the Kayans the divorce is not infrequently followed  by a reconciliation brought about by the intervention of friends;  the parties then come together again without further ceremony. There  is little formality about the divorce procedure. In the main it takes  the form of separation by mutual consent and the condonation of the  irregularity by the community on the payment of a fine to the chief.      Adoption    Adoption is by no means uncommon. The desire for children, especially  male children, is general and strong; but sterile marriages seem to be  known among all the peoples and are common among the Kenyahs. When a  woman has remained infertile for some years after her marriage, the  couple usually seek to adopt one or more children. They generally  prefer the child of a relative, but may take any child, even a  captive or a slave child, whose parents are willing to resign all  rights in it. A child is often taken over from parents oppressed  by poverty, in many cases some article of value or a supply of PADI  being given in exchange. Not infrequently the parents wish to have  the child returned to them when their affairs take a turn for the  better, owing to a good harvest or some stroke of luck, and this is  a frequent cause of dissensions. Usually the adopted child takes in  every way the position of a child born to the parents.    Some of the Klemantans (Barawans"]]]
