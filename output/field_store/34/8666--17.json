And this is the first and highest work of God in  us and the best training, that we cease from our works, that we let our  reason and will be idle, that we rest and commend ourselves to God in  all things, especially when they seem to be spiritual and good.    XIX. After this comes the discipline of the flesh, to kill its gross,  evil lust, to give it rest and relief. This we must kill and quiet with  fasting, watching and labor, and from this we learn how much and why we  shall fast, watch and labor.    There are, alas! many blind men, who practise their castigation,  whether it be fasting, watching or labor, only because they think these  are good works, intending by them to gain much merit. Far blinder still  are they who measure their fasting not only by the quantity or  duration, as these do, but also by the nature of the food, thinking  that it is of far greater worth if they do not eat meat, eggs or  butter. Beyond these are those who fast according to the saints, and  according to the days; one fasting on Wednesday, another on Saturday,  another on St. Barbara's day, another on St. Sebastian's day, and so  on. These all seek in their fasting nothing beyond the work itself:  when they have performed that, they think they have done a good work. I  will here say nothing of the fact that some fast in such a way that  they none the less drink themselves full; some fast by eating fish and  other foods so lavishly that they would come much nearer to fasting if  they ate meat, eggs and butter, and by so doing would obtain far better  results from their fasting. For such fasting is not fasting, but a  mockery of fasting and of God.    Therefore I allow everyone to choose his day, food and quantity for  fasting, as he will, on condition that he do not stop with that, but  have regard to his flesh; let him put upon it fasting, watching and  labor according to its lust and wantonness, and no more, although pope,  Church, bishop, father-confessor or any one else whosoever have  commanded it. For no one should measure and regulate fasting, watching  and labor according to the character or quantity of the food, or  according to the days, but according to the withdrawal or approach of  the lust and wantonness of the flesh, for the sake of which alone the  fasting, watching and labor is ordained, that is, to kill and to subdue  them. If it were not for this lust, eating were as meritorious as  fasting, sleeping as watching, idleness as labor, and each were as good  as the other without all distinction.    XX. Now, if some one should find that more wantonness arose in his  flesh from eating fish than from eating eggs and meat, let him eat meat  and not fish. Again, if he find that his head becomes confused and  crazed or his body and stomach injured through fasting, or that it is  not needful to kill the wantonness of his flesh, he shall let fasting  alone entirely, and eat, sleep, be idle as is necessary for his health,  regardless whether it be against the command of the Church, or the  rules of monastic orders: for no commandment of the Church, no law of  an order can make fasting, watching and labor of more value than it has  in serving to repress or to kill the flesh and its lusts. Where men go  beyond this, and the fasting, eating, sleeping, watching are practised  beyond the strength of the body, and more than is necessary to the  killing of the lust, so that through it the natural strength is ruined  and the head is racked; then let no one imagine that he has done good  works, or excuse himself by citing the commandment of the Church or the  law of his order. He will be regarded as a man who takes no care of  himself, and, as far as in him lies, has become his own murderer.    For the body is not given us that we should kill its natural life or  work, but only that we kill its wantonness; unless its wantonness were  so strong and great that we could not sufficiently resist it without  ruin and harm to the natural life.  For, as has been said, in the  practice of fasting, watching and labor, we are not to look upon the  works in themselves, not on the days, not on the number, not on the  food, but only on the wanton and lustful Adam, that through them he may  be cured of his evil appetite.    XXI. From this we can judge how wisely or foolishly some women act when  they are with child, and how the sick are to be treated.  For the  foolish women cling so firmly to their fasting that they run the risk  of great danger to the fruit of their womb and to themselves, rather  than not to fast when the others fast. They make a matter of conscience  where there is none, and where there is matter of conscience they make  none. This is all the fault of the preachers, because they continually  prate of fasting, and never point out its true use, limit, fruit, cause  and purpose.  So also the sick should be allowed to eat and to drink  every day whatever they wish. In brief, where the wantonness of the  flesh ceases, there every reason for fasting, watching, laboring,  eating this or that, has already ceased, and there no longer is any  binding commandment at all.    But then care must be taken, lest out of this freedom there grow a lazy  indifference about killing the wantonness of the flesh; for the roguish  Adam is exceedingly tricky in looking for permission for himself, and  in pleading the ruin of the body or of the mind; so some men jump right  in and say it is neither necessary nor commanded to fast or to mortify  the flesh, and are ready to eat this and that without fear, just as if  they had for a long time had much experience of fasting, although they  have never tried it.    No less are we to guard against offending those who, not sufficiently  informed, regard it a great sin if we do not fast or eat as they do.  These we must kindly instruct, and not haughtily despise, nor eat this  or that in despite of them, but we must tell them the reason why it is  right to do so, and thus gradually lead them to a correct  understanding. But if they are stubborn and will not listen, we must  let them alone, and do as we know it is right to do.    XXII. The second form of discipline which we receive at the hands of  others, is when men or devils cause us suffering, as when our property  is taken, our body sick, and our honor taken away; and everything that  may move us to anger, impatience and unrest. For God's work rules in us  according to His wisdom, not according to our wisdom, according to His  purity and chastity, not according to the wantonness of our flesh; for  God's work is wisdom and purity, our work is foolishness and impurity,  and these shall rest: so in like manner it should rule in us according  to His peace, not our anger, impatience and lack of peace. For peace  too is God's work, impatience is the work of our flesh; this shall rest  and be dead, that we thus in every way keep a spiritual holiday, let  our works stand idle, and let God work in us.    Therefore in order to kill our works and the Adam in us, God heaps many  temptations upon us, which move us to anger, many sufferings, which  rouse us to impatience, and last of all death and the world's abuse;  whereby He seeks nothing else than that He may drive out anger,  impatience and lack of peace, and attain to His work, that is, to  peace, in us. Thus says Isaiah xxviii, \"He does the work of another  that He may come to His own work.\" What does this mean? He sends us  suffering and trouble that He may teach us to have patience and peace;  He bids us die that He may make us live, until a man, thoroughly  trained, becomes so peaceful and quiet that he is not disturbed,  whether it go well or ill with him, whether he die or live, be honored  or dishonored. There God Himself dwells alone, and there are no works  of men. This is rightly keeping and hallowing the day of rest; then a  man does not guide himself, then he desires nothing for himself, then  nothing troubles him; but God Himself leads him, there is naught but  godly pleasure, joy and peace with all other works and virtues.    XXIII. These works He considers so great that He commands us not only  to keep the day of rest, but also to hallow it or regard it as holy,  whereby He declares that there are no more precious things than  suffering, dying, and all manner of misfortune. For they are holy and  sanctify a man from his works to God's works, just as a church is  consecrated from natural works to the worship of God. Therefore a man  shall also recognise them as holy things, be glad and thank God when  they come upon him. For when they come they make him holy, so that he  fulfils this Commandment and is saved, redeemed from all his sinful  works. Thus says David: \"Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death  of His saints.\"    In order to strengthen us thereto He has not only commanded us to keep  such a rest (for nature is very unwilling to die and to suffer, and it  is a bitter day of rest for it to cease from its works and be dead);  but He has also comforted us in the Scriptures with many words and told  us, Psalm xci, \"I will be with him in all his trouble, and will deliver  him.\" Likewise Psalm xxxiv: \"The Lord is nigh unto all them that  suffer, and will help them.\"    As if this were not enough, He has given us a powerful, strong example  of it, His only, dear Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord, who on the Sabbath  lay in the tomb the entire day of rest, free from all His works, and  was the first to fulfil this Commandment, although He needed it not for  Himself, but only for our comfort, that we also in all suffering and  death should be quiet and have peace. Since, as Christ was raised up  after His rest and henceforth lives only in God and God in Him, so also  shall we by the death of our Adam, which is perfectly accomplished only  through natural death and burial, be lifted up into God, that God "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/419"],[0,"The Magic of Oz (#15)"],[1,"sick he 'members the time he was  well, an' wishes that time would come back.  Most folks forget to thank  God for givin' 'em two good legs, till they lose one o' 'em, like I  did; and then it's too late, 'cept to praise God for leavin' one.\"    \"Your wooden leg ain't so bad, Cap'n,\" she remarked, looking at it  critically.  \"Anyhow, it don't take root on a Magic Island, like our  meat legs do.\"    \"I ain't complainin',\" said Cap'n Bill.  \"What's that swimmin' towards  us, Trot?\" he added, looking over the Magic Flower and across the water.    The girl looked, too, and then she replied.    \"It's a bird of some sort.  It's like a duck, only I never saw a duck  have so many colors.\"    The bird swam swiftly and gracefully toward the Magic Isle, and as it  drew nearer its gorgeously colored plumage astonished them.  The  feathers were of many hues of glistening greens and blues and purples,  and it had a yellow head with a red plume, and pink, white and violet  in its tail.  When it reached the Isle, it came ashore and approached  them, waddling slowly and turning its head first to one side and then  to the other, so as to see the girl and the sailor better.    \"You're strangers,\" said the bird, coming to a halt near them, \"and  you've been caught by the Magic Isle and made prisoners.\"    \"Yes,\" returned Trot, with a sigh; \"we're rooted.  But I hope we won't  grow.\"    \"You'll grow small,\" said the Bird.  \"You'll keep growing smaller every  day, until bye and bye there'll be nothing left of you.  That's the  usual way, on this Magic Isle.\"    \"How do you know about it, and who are you, anyhow?\" asked Cap'n Bill.    \"I'm the Lonesome Duck,\" replied the bird.  \"I suppose you've heard of  me?\"    \"No,\" said Trot, \"I can't say I have.  What makes you lonesome?\"    \"Why, I haven't any family or any relations,\" returned the Duck.    \"Haven't you any friends?\"    \"Not a friend.  And I've nothing to do.  I've lived a long time, and  I've got to live forever, because I belong in the Land of Oz, where no  living thing dies.  Think of existing year after year, with no friends,  no family, and nothing to do!  Can you wonder I'm lonesome?\"    \"Why don't you make a few friends, and find something to do?\" inquired  Cap'n Bill.    \"I can't make friends because everyone I meet--bird, beast, or  person--is disagreeable to me.  In a few minutes I shall be unable to  bear your society longer, and then I'll go away and leave you,\" said  the Lonesome Duck.  \"And, as for doing anything, there's no use in it.  All I meet are doing something, so I have decided it's common and  uninteresting and I prefer to remain lonesome.\"    \"Don't you have to hunt for your food?\" asked Trot.    \"No.  In my diamond palace, a little way up the river, food is  magically supplied me; but I seldom eat, because it is so common.\"    \"You must be a Magician Duck,\" remarked Cap'n Bill.    \"Why so?\"    \"Well, ordinary ducks don't have diamond palaces an' magic food, like  you do.\"    \"True; and that's another reason why I'm lonesome.  You must remember  I'm the only Duck in the Land of Oz, and I'm not like any other duck in  the outside world.\"    \"Seems to me you LIKE bein' lonesome,\" observed Cap'n Bill.    \"I can't say I like it, exactly,\" replied the Duck, \"but since it seems  to be my fate, I'm rather proud of it.\"    \"How do you s'pose a single, solitary Duck happened to be in the Land  of Oz?\" asked Trot, wonderingly.    \"I used to know the reason, many years ago, but I've quite forgotten  it,\" declared the Duck.  \"The reason for a thing is never so important  as the thing itself, so there's no use remembering anything but the  fact that I'm lonesome.\"    \"I guess you'd be happier if you tried to do something,\" asserted Trot.  \"If you can't do anything for yourself, you can do things for others,  and then you'd get lots of friends and stop being lonesome.\"    \"Now you're getting disagreeable,\" said the Lonesome Duck, \"and I shall  have to go and leave you.\"    \"Can't you help us any,\" pleaded the girl.  \"If there's anything magic  about you, you might get us out of this scrape.\"    \"I haven't any magic strong enough to get you off the Magic Isle,\"  replied the Lonesome Duck.  \"What magic I possess is very simple, but I  find it enough for my own needs.\"    \"If we could only sit down a while, we could stand it better,\" said  Trot, \"but we have nothing to sit on.\"    \"Then you will have to stand it,\" said the Lonesome Duck.    \"P'raps you've enough magic to give us a couple of stools,\" suggested  Cap'n Bill.    \"A duck isn't supposed to know what stools are,\" was the reply.    \"But you're diff'rent from all other ducks.\"    \"That is true.\"  The strange creature seemed to reflect for a moment,  looking at them sharply from its round black eyes.  Then it said:  \"Sometimes, when the sun is hot, I grow a toadstool to shelter me from  its rays.  Perhaps you could sit on toadstools.\"    \"Well, if they were strong enough, they'd do,\" answered Cap'n Bill.    \"Then, before I do I'll give you a couple,\" said the Lonesome Duck, and  began waddling about in a small circle.  It went around the circle to  the right three times, and then it went around to the left three times.  Then it hopped backward three times and forward three times.    \"What are you doing?\" asked Trot.    \"Don't interrupt.  This is an incantation,\" replied the Lonesome Duck,  but now it began making a succession of soft noises that sounded like  quacks and seemed to mean nothing at all.  And it kept up these sounds  so long that Trot finally exclaimed:    \"Can't you hurry up and finish that 'cantation?  If it takes all summer  to make a couple of toadstools, you're not much of a magician.\"    \"I told you not to interrupt,\" said the Lonesome Duck, sternly.  \"If  you get TOO disagreeable, you'll drive me away before I finish this  incantation.\"    Trot kept quiet, after the rebuke, and the Duck resumed the quacky  muttering.  Cap'n Bill chuckled a little to himself and remarked to  Trot in a whisper: \"For a bird that ain't got anything to do, this  Lonesome Duck is makin' consider'ble fuss.  An' I ain't sure, after  all, as toadstools would be worth sittin' on.\"    Even as he spoke, the sailor-man felt something touch him from behind  and, turning his head, he found a big toadstool in just the right place  and of just the right size to sit upon.  There was one behind Trot,  too, and with a cry of pleasure the little girl sank back upon it and  found it a very comfortable seat--solid, yet almost like a cushion.  Even Cap'n Bill's weight did not break his toadstool down, and when  both were seated, they found that the Lonesome Duck had waddled away  and was now at the water's edge.    \"Thank you, ever so much!\" cried Trot, and the sailor called out: \"Much  obliged!\"    But the Lonesome Duck paid no attention.  Without even looking in their  direction again, the gaudy fowl entered the water and swam gracefully  away.          16.  The Glass Cat Finds the Black Bag      When the six monkeys were transformed by Kiki Aru into six giant  soldiers fifty feet tall, their heads came above the top of the trees,  which in this part of the forest were not so high as in some other  parts; and, although the trees were somewhat scattered, the bodies of  the giant soldiers were so big that they quite filled the spaces in  which they stood and the branches pressed them on every side.    Of course, Kiki was foolish to have made his soldiers so big, for now  they could not get out of the forest.  Indeed, they could not stir a  step, but were imprisoned by the trees.  Even had they been in the  little clearing they could not have made their way out of it, but they  were a little beyond the clearing.  At first, the other monkeys who had  not been enchanted were afraid of the soldiers, and hastily quitted the  place; but soon finding that the great men stood stock still, although  grunting indignantly at their transformation, the band of monkeys  returned to the spot and looked at them curiously, not guessing that  they were really monkeys and their own friends.    The soldiers couldn't see them, their heads being above the trees; they  could not even raise their arms or draw their sharp swords, so closely  were they held by the leafy branches.  So the monkeys, finding the  giants helpless, began climbing up their bodies, and presently all the  band were perched on the shoulders of the giants and peering into their  faces.    \"I'm Ebu, your father,\" cried one soldier to a monkey who had perched  upon his left ear, \"but some cruel person has enchanted me.\"    \"I'm your Uncle Peeker,\" said another soldier to another monkey.    So, very soon all the monkeys knew the truth and were sorry for their  friends and relations and angry at the person--whoever it was--who had  transformed them.  There was a great chattering among the tree-tops,  and the noise attracted other monkeys, so that the clearing and all the  trees around were full of them.    Rango the Gray Ape, who was the Chief of all the monkey tribes of the  forest, heard the uproar and came to see what was wrong with his  people.  And Rango, being wiser and more experienced, at once knew that  the strange magician who looked like a mixed-up beast was responsible  for the transformations.  He realized that the six giant soldiers were  helpless prisoners, because of their size, and knew he was powerless to  release them.  So, although he feared to meet the terrible magician, he  hurried away to the Great Clearing to tell Gugu the King what had  happened and to try to find the Wizard of Oz and get him to save his  six enchanted subjects.    Rango darted into the Great Clearing just as the Wizard had restored  all the enchanted ones around him to their proper shapes, and the Gray  Ape was glad to hear that the wicked magician-beast had been conquered.    \"But now, O mighty Wizard, you must come with me to where six of my  people are transformed into six great giant men,\""]]]
