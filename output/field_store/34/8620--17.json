[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37856"],[0,"The Determined Angler and the Brook Trout (#15)"],[1,"I know  where more trout can be caught on the fly than by bait, one hundred to  two hundred trout have been caught in one day on the fly, but in most  instances these trout take the fly _not_ when it alights upon the  water but _after_ it has been played. Such occurrences as these,  however, take place where countless numbers of small trout are found  in the shallow waters of remarkable and wonderful natural breeding and  propagating sections. Instances of this kind prove nothing because  they are the great exception and the art of fly-fishing is not brought  into play, for one fly is as good as another and the small boy with  his fifty-cent pole can catch just as many trout as the man of  experience with his thirty-dollar rod of split bamboo. Yet in  expressing my opinion about trout rising to a fly when it first  alights upon the water I took into consideration just such instances  as I have cited.    \"'For your own satisfaction and education,' to quote from my book,  'when the opportunity offers, keep an account of the number of rises  you get when your fly first strikes the water and the number you get  after you have begun to fish the fly, and so prove for yourself what  the real facts are on this subject.'    \"It is unquestionably true that all trout both large and small, when  in clear, still water that is shallow, easily see a cast fly before it  alights upon the surface.    \"At times, under certain conditions both on streams and lakes, trout  will leap into the air and take small as well as large flies in the  air. But seldom will large or very large trout rise above the surface  for any kind of fly either real or artificial.    \"In order that there may be no misunderstanding I would say that I  classify the size of trout as follows:    \"Small trout, 8 inches and under.    \"Medium sized trout, 9 to 13 inches.    \"Large trout, 14 to 18 inches.    \"Very large trout, 19 inches and over.    \"Trout found in rapid streams are more alert than trout found  elsewhere; they in most cases represent the perfection of trout life  in all its different phases. Trout in rapid streams are snappy risers  to both the real and artificial fly but owing to the current they  frequently 'fall short' and fail to strike and take the fly. Such  trout when they do take the fly are the easiest to hook because they  often hook or help to hook themselves owing to the current.    \"Your experience can hardly be said to differ materially from my own  in the instances you mention, but I cannot help thinking that you have  failed to take into account the many times when you have returned with  an empty or very nearly empty creel or to consider the number of times  you have actually cast your fly on the days when the creel was full to  overflowing.    \"If you have cited your usual experience then I heartily congratulate  you upon your skill and upon your good fortune in knowing such  remarkable fishing waters wherein there dwells 'the most beautiful  fish that swims.'\"    I fully agree with Mr. Southard, and I, too, should have worded my  comment differently, though I didn't declare, fortunately, that most  of my trout were taken the instant the fly touched the water. I used  the word \"many\" in both instances where I spoke of the trout taking  the fly. I think I should have considered more deeply Mr. Southard's  line \"once in thirty casts\"; then we'd have understood each other.  However, no crime has been committed; far from it, for look you,  reader, what you have gained--all this delightful extra practical  reading; and remember ye, \"one of the charms of angling,\" as Pritt  says, \"is that it presents an endless field for argument, speculation,  and experiment.\"          CHAPTER XIII    THE BROOK TROUT'S RIVAL      When the German brown trout was introduced in the brook trout streams  of Pennsylvania some years ago fly-fishermen condemned the act because  they believed the brook trout (_S. fontinalis_) was superior to the  brown trout as a game fish. Deforestation, rendering the streams too  warm for the brook trout, has changed the fly-fisherman's feeling in  the matter. The brown trout can thrive in warm water, and with the  brook trout's gradual extermination the brown trout is being welcomed  as the next best thing. A correspondent at Reading, Pa., signing  himself \"Mourner\"--he mourns the passing of the true brook  trout--declares the brown trout strikes harder than the brook trout  and after being hooked, unlike the brook trout, makes two or three  leaps out of the water, but is not so gamey and cunning as the brook  trout and tires out much quicker. The German species has been popular  because it attains a larger size quickly and destroys almost every  fish in the streams, including the brook trout. \"The fly-fishermen who  for years have matched their skill, cunning, artifice, and prowess  against the genuine brook trout that since creation dawned have  inhabited the mountain brooks that flow down every ravine,\" says  Mourner, \"have had forced on them, as never before, the sad truth  that, like the deer, bear, quail, woodcock, and grouse, brook trout  are slowly but surely passing. There never was a fish so gamy,  elusive, and eccentric, so beautiful and so hard to deceive and  capture by scientific methods as the native brook trout. No orator has  yet risen to fully sound its praises; no poet to sing its merits as  they deserve; no painter to produce its varied hues. The brook trout  was planted in the crystal waters by the Creator 'when the morning  stars sang together' and _fontinalis_ was undisturbed, save as some  elk, deer, bear, panther, or wildcat forded the shallows of his abode,  or some Indian or mink needed him for food. In this environment the  brook trout grew and thrived. Much warfare made him shy and suspicious  until he became crafty to a degree. The brook trout successfully  combated man's inventive genius in the shape of agile rods, artificial  flies and other bait calculated to fool the most wary, and automatic  reels, landing nets, and other paraphernalia designed to rob a game  fish of 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.' But it was not  until the tanner and acid factory despoiler turned poisoned refuse  into the streams and the dynamiter came upon the scene and the  sheltering trees were cut away by the lumberman, letting in the sun  and warming the water to a nauseous tepidity, that the brave trout  faltered, hesitated, and then quit the uneven conquest. Carp and bass  were planted in the streams to further endanger the brook trout's  existence. Next the California trout and the German brown trout, who  prey upon the true brook trout's progeny, followed, till finally,  beaten, baffled, dismayed, poisoned, routed, and overwhelmed by the  superior numbers and size of a cannibalistic race, he gradually began  his retreat. It is good-bye to the brook trout now. With him it was  either cool pools, solitude, and freedom, or extermination. The waters  that pour down into larger streams are sad memories now of his school  playgrounds. No more will the sportsman's honest hunger be appeased by  the brook trout's fine-grained flesh from hardening waters of nearby  mountain brooks. But memory of the brook trout cannot be wrested from  those who knew him at his best, and braved personal danger from  rattler, bear, and wildcat to win him from the crystal waters. The  brook trout has been butchered to make a carp's holiday. Gone he may  be now, but he will live forever in the dreams of all true fishermen  as the real aristocrat of the mountain streams. The like of him will  not soon be seen again.\" The Fish Commission has mastered the science  of the artificial propagation of the brook trout--millions are now  produced with little trouble and expense--and the stocking of waters  is a common practice, but the Fish Commission can't propagate forests  and woodland streams. Mourner must know that the brook trout itself is  not hard to save; it is the preservation of its wild habitat that is  the great puzzle. If the United States Forestry Department will  protect the trout streams from the greedy lumberman, the factoryman,  and acid maker, the Fish Commission will have no trouble in saving the  brook trout.          CHAPTER XIV    TROUT ON BARBLESS HOOKS      Most women who indulge in fishing are, like children, mere fish  takers, not Anglers, but the craft is honored by the association of  many fine female devotees who study and practice the gentle art in its  fullest meaning--a devotion to the poetic, artistic, healthful, and  humane elements in piscatorial pursuits. Dame Juliana Berners, who  wrote the earliest volume on gentle fishing (1500), was the first  celebrated example of the artful and merciful woman fisher, and  Cleopatra the first female to make notorious the coarse and ungodly  method in fishing for pastime. Sweet Dame Berners believed in  angling--the desire of fair treatment to the quarry, correct tackle, a  love of the pursuit superior to greed for number in the catch, and a  heavenly admiration of the general beauties of nature in the day as  well as in the play; and brutal Cleopatra believed in mere fishing,  the killing of the greatest number, regardless of means, mercy, or  method.    Our modern Dame Bernerses and Cleopatras in the fishing fold are many.  The wife who aids the net fisherman--the marine farmer whose calling  emulates the professional duties of Jesus' disciples, Peter. Andrew,  James, and John--does not count. Her part in fishing, while by no  means angling, is as honest as the work of the upland farmer's  helpmate, and God Himself will not condemn little children, male or  female, who fish indiscriminately, \"because they do not know.\" Fishing  for the modern market is just as honorable as market fishing was in  the ancient days when Jesus praised the net fishermen and made them  His nearest and dearest friends, and angling--merciful ungreedy  fishing with humane tackle and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37872"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 2, No. 1, December, 1850 (#15)"],[1," offered up.\"           *       *       *       *       *    John Ruskin, who has written of painting, sculpture and architecture, in  a manner more attractive to mere amateurs than any other author, will  soon publish his elaborate work, \"The Authors of Venice.\"  Notwithstanding his almost blind idolatry of Turner, and his other  heresies, Ruskin is one of the few writers on art who open new vistas to  the mind; vehement, paradoxical, and one-sided he may be, but no other  writer _clears_ the subject in the same masterly manner--no other writer  suggests more even to those of opposite opinions.           *       *       *       *       *    The first two volumes of Oehlenschlager's _Lebens Erinnerungen_ have  appeared at Vienna, and attract more observation than anything else in  the late movements in the German literature. The poet's early struggles  give one kind of interest to this work, and his friendship with  illustrious litterateurs another. Madame de Stael, Goethe, Schiller, the  Schlegels, Steffens, Hegel, and other representatives of German thought,  pass in succession through these pages, mingled with pictures of Danish  life, and criticisms on the Danish drama. Like most German biographies,  this deals as much with German literature as with German life.           *       *       *       *       *    Gustave Planche, a clever Parisian critic, has in the last number of _La  Revue des Deux Mondes_, an article on Lamartine's novels and  Confessions, issued within the year. He spares neither the prose nor  poetry of the romantic statesman. He classes the _History of the  Girondists_ with the novels. On the whole he thinks there is less of  fact, or more of transmutation of fact, than in Sir Walter Scott's  Waverley series: as in Scott's Life of Napoleon there was less of  veracity than in any even of his professed fictions founded upon  history. These romancists are never to be trusted, except in their own  domains.           *       *       *       *       *    Prosper Merimee, known among the poets by his _Theatre de Clara Gazul_,  and who by his _Chronique du Temps de Charles IX._ and _Colomba_, was  entitled to honorable mention in literature, has written a very clever  book about the United States--the fruit of a visit to this country last  year--which an accomplished New-Yorker is engaged in translating. His  last previous performance was a Life of Pedro the Cruel, which has been  translated and published in London, and is thus spoken of in the  _Literary Gazette_:--         \"The subject hardly yields in romantic variety, strange turns of       fortune, characters of strong expression, and tragedies of the       deepest pathos, to anything created by the imagination. Within the       period and in the land which was marked by the fortunes of Pedro of       Castile, the scene is crowded with figures over which both history       and song have thrown a lasting interest. The names of Planche of       France, Inez de Castro of Portugal, Du Guesclin,--the Black Prince,       the White Company--belong alike to romance and to reality. The very       'Don Juan' of Mozart and Byron plays his part for an hour as no       fabulous gallant at the court of Seville; Moors and Christians join       in the council or in the field here, as well as in the strains of       the Romancero; and the desperate game played for a crown by the       rival brothers whose more than Theban strife was surrounded by such       various objects of pity, admiration or terror, wants no incident,       from its commencement to its climax, to fill the just measure of a       tragic theme. One more striking could scarcely have been desired by       a poet; yet M. Merimee, who claims that character, has handled it       with the judgment and diligence of an historian.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Nathaniel Hawthorne, the greatest living American writer born in the  present century, has just published, through Ticknor, Reed and Fields, a  volume for juvenile readers, in the preface to which he says:         \"It has not been composed without a deep sense of responsibility.       The author regards children as sacred, and would not for the world       cast anything into the fountain of a young heart that might       embitter and pollute its waters. And even in point of the literary       reputation to be aimed at, juvenile literature is as well worth       cultivating as any other. The writer, if he succeed in pleasing his       little readers, may hope to be remembered by them till their own       old age--a far longer period of literary existence than is       generally attained by those who seek immortality from the judgments       of full grown men.\"           *       *       *       *       *    An attentive correspondent of the _International_, at Vienna, mentions  that letters have been received there from the eccentric but daring and  intelligent American, Dr. Mathews, formerly of Baltimore, who, some  years since, assumed the style of the Arabs, with a view to discovery in  Northern and Central Africa. We hope to obtain further information of  Dr. Mathews, respecting whose adventures there has not hitherto been  anything in the journals for several years.           *       *       *       *       *    Professor G.J. Adler, of the New York University, the learned author of  the German and English Dictionary, is now printing a translation which  he has just completed, of the _Iphigenia in Taurus_, by Goethe. Of the  eighteen that remain of the sixty to ninety plays of Euripides, the  _Iphigenia at Tauri_ is one of the most remarkable. When Goethe returned  from Italy, his spirit was infused with the love of ancient art, and his  ambition tempting him to a rivalry of its masters, he selected this  subject, to which he brought, if not his finest powers, his severest  labor; and the drama of Iphigenia--which is in many respects very  different from that of Euripides,--is, next to Faust, perhaps the  noblest of his works. We are not aware that it has hitherto appeared in  English. The forthcoming translation, (which is in the press of the  Appletons,) strikes us very favorably. It is exact, and is generally  flowing and elegant.           *       *       *       *       *    The Official Paper of China has a name which means the _Pekin Gazette_.  It is impossible to ascertain when its publication was first commenced,  but it seems to be the oldest newspaper in the world. There is a  tradition that it began under the Sung dynasty in the latter part of the  tenth century. It is originally a sort of handbill, containing official  notices, posted up on the walls of the Capital and sent in manuscript to  provincial officers. At Canton it is printed for the public at large and  sold. It appears every other day in the form of a pamphlet of ten or  twelve pages. It consists of three parts; the first is devoted to Court  news, such as the health and other doings of the Imperial family; the  second gives the decrees of the Sovereign; the third contains the  reports and memorials of public functionaries made to the imperial  government on all subjects concerning the interests of the country. The  decrees are concise in style; the reports and memorials are the  perfection of verbiage. The former have the force of laws, the Emperor  being both legislative and executive. As a record of materials for  history the _Gazette_ is of little value, for a little study shows that  lies are abundant in it, and that its statements are designed as much to  conceal as to make known the facts. Since the English war the number of  documents published relating to affairs with foreign nations is very  small. Something is given respecting the finances, but that too, is of  very little value.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Williams, who wrote \"Shakspeare and his Friends,\" &c., has just  published a novel entitled \"The Luttrells.\" It was very high praise of  his earlier works that they were by many sagacious critics attributed to  Savage Landor. His novels on the literature of the Elizabethan age  evince taste and feeling, and his sketches of the Chesterfield and  Walpole period in \"Maids of Honor,\" are happily and gracefully done.  \"The Luttrells\" has passages occasionally more powerful but hardly so  pleasing as some in the books we have named. In mere style it is an  improvement on his former efforts. In the early passages of the story  there is nice handling of character, and frequent touches of genuine  feeling.           *       *       *       *       *    The fifth volume of Vaulabelle's _Histoire de la Restauration_, a  conscientious and carefully written history of France and the Bourbon  family, from the restoration in 1815 down to the overthrow of Charles  X., has just been published at Paris. It receives the same praise as the  preceding volumes. M. Vaulabelle it may be remembered was for a brief  period, in 1848, General Cavaignac's Minister of Education and Public  Worship.           *       *       *       *       *    Captain Sir Edward Belcher, C.B., R.N., &c., whose presence in New York  we noted recently, is now in Texas, superintending the settlement of a  large party of first class English emigrants. A volume supplemental to  his \"Voyage of H.M.S. Samarang,\" illustrative of the zoology of the  expedition, has been published in London by Arthur Adams, F.L.S.           *       *       *       *       *    M. Guizot, it is said, is going back to his old profession of editor. He  is to participate in the conduct of the _Journal des Debats_, in which,  of course, he will sign his articles. We do not always agree with M.  Guizot, but we cannot help thinking him, upon the whole, the most  respectable man who for a long time has been conspicuous in affairs in  France.           *       *       *       *       *    The sixth and concluding volume of the life and correspondence of Robert  Southey, edited by C.C."]]]
