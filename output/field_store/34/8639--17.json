No Stosstruppen, (shock troops,) no  expert grenadiers or flame pumpers this time. Mixed in the same ranks,  the British colonials in khaki and the French in light blue went forward  irresistibly with the bayonet.    \"The Canadians,\" says one of my informants, \"performed prodigies of  valor, and when the boches fell back they had lost half their  effectives.\"    Full of their success, our troops turned northward and would not be  satisfied till they had been firmly set on the wooded heights near the  town. Later in the day several violent enemy attacks were made south of  the Somme, but they seem to have been of rather a local and scattered  kind, as though, at least for the moment, fresh efforts of the  dimensions of those of Friday and Saturday were impossible.    The British have made some progress in the valley of the Luce, and two  strong German attacks were repulsed between Marcelcave and the Somme,  as were others in the British sphere on the north of the river. On the  other hand, the British line was beaten back to the village of Hangard,  [Hangard was lost and finally retaken and held by the French,] on the  north bank of the Luce, nearly opposite Demuin.    Like the actions of the preceding days, this battle has been in the main  a conflict of infantry. On neither side has it been possible to get  heavy artillery in position in time, but on the allied side French and  British guns, freshly detrained, gave support of moral as well as  material importance. When the 75 has a target of masses advancing in  close, deep waves, its effects are terrible beyond words. In the open  country the air squadrons of the Allies have also worked havoc in the  enemy's ranks, besides bursting tons of explosives on his camps and  lines of communication.      AGAINST ENORMOUS ODDS    April 8.--It is evident that the German onslaught has failed to break  through. What the Allies have lost in ground they have saved in men;  and, on the other hand, the enemy, who wanted not these miles of  desolate territory, but a final decision, has paid inordinately without  getting any nearer the desired result.    For five days his advance, though somewhat behind his ambitious program,  was not seriously interrupted. On March 25 a certain General reached the  region of Montdidier and began to build a human barrier. On March 23  began what may be called a four days' battle of arrest. Three French  divisions had to meet and did meet the onset of fifteen German  divisions. There were smaller units that fought one against ten.    The main German effort was against the Moreuil-Grivesnes-Montchel line,  the object being (with 150,000 men in play there could be no less  ambitious aim) to break right through to the south of Amiens and  completely separate the French and British Armies. It culminated on the  31st with a suicidal assault by the pick of the Prussian Guards and  other chosen divisions at Grivesnes, when a certain gallant Colonel,  rifle in hand, directed the barricading of the windows of the chateau,  and with not more than 500 men kept off three or four times as many  assailants and had strength enough left at last to sweep those who  remained out of the park.    I need not measure again the trivial gain for the enemy of this four  days' battle. Perhaps the most significant fact about it is that while,  overwhelming as was his original force, the enemy had repeatedly to  withdraw and renew his units, not one French unit was relieved in that  time. At Mesnil St. Georges one infantry battalion, with some groups of  chasseurs, drove off five successive attacks by a whole German division.  I might multiply such instances, but space would fail me to make them  real with detail.    A pause of four days followed this failure. Then, on April 4, twelve  divisions were again launched in the northern part of the same narrow  field--10,000 men per mile of front. They won at great cost the ruins of  two hamlets and a slice of fields beside them.      FIRST PHASE REVIEWED    April 14.--The first phase or act of the offensive, launched with  unprecedented masses of troops, completely failed to reach its aim and  entailed losses that no lesser success could warrant. Begun on March 21,  with three armies--those of von Below, von der Marwitz, and von  Hutier--counting nearly fifty divisions, about forty more had to be  brought in before the first week was out.    By that time the French armies had been pushed northwestward with  admirable rapidity and characteristically splendid spirit, and by the  last day of the month the host of the Prussian Crown Prince, including  the Guard and others of the best German units, had been fought to a  standstill from Noyon and Lassigny to the Avre and the Somme.    Several hard combats in the last fortnight, the latest ending in the  French recovering the village of Hangard on Friday and their useful  advance yesterday near Arvillers, do but confirm this result. That the  German losses are fully commensurate with the ambition of their aims and  the prodigal method pursued is shown by another fact unprecedented in  the history of war.    At the end of three weeks of the offensive about 1,500,000 men have been  cast into the battle, and seventy-five divisions have become so  dislocated as to have to be withdrawn for reorganization. It is  therefore probable that the total German casualties up to date approach  500,000.      SECOND PHASE SUMMARIZED    The second phase may be regarded as having opened March 28 with the  entry of General von Below's right wing into action east of Arras, and  as culminating with the battle of Armentieres, involving the army of  General von Quest and the left wing of General von Arnim's army at  Ypres, while a subsidiary operation by General von Boehm's army  threatened the French between the Oise and St. Gobain Forest.    This northern battle began in a much smaller way than the original  offensive, with about twenty divisions on a twenty-mile front, and it  may have been its initial success that determined its prompt extension.    While it may fairly be said to have constituted a confession of failure  in the earlier adventure, its development not only creates a new danger,  but strengthens the German position athwart the Somme. The situation,  therefore, must be looked at straightforwardly and spoken of without  mincing words.    In the middle of March the German armies consisted of 4,000,000 men at  the front, 1,300,000 on the lines of communication and in the interior,  and others who can be added to the present effectiveness.    From the village of Hangard to Abbeville is about forty miles; from  Merville to Calais is the same distance; to Boulogne a little more; from  the Ypres front to Dunkirk is about thirty miles; to Nieuport a little  less. These are the limits of the allied power of manoeuvre for the  defense of the Channel.          Caring for Thousands of Refugees      Long processions of civilian refugees lined the roadsides in the invaded  area during the days of battle--the pitiful hosts of those fleeing from  the German guns and the terrors of German occupation. Many thousands of  villagers and farmers whose little homes had been devastated by the  first German occupation and by the battle of the Somme had been trying  bravely to restore their ruined houses and cultivate the tortured soil  again. With the aid of American friends hundreds of cottages had been  built, heaps of shattered masonry cleared away, shops and schools  opened, and French, British, and American committees had formed a  nucleus around which new life was gradually growing up. No less than  5,500 acres of the devastated land evacuated by the Germans a year ago  were again under cultivation--enough to feed 16,000 persons a year.    All this work of the stricken inhabitants, with their replanted fruit  trees and scanty stores of new implements, had to be abandoned almost at  a moment's notice. Many of the peasants, stunned by the new catastrophe,  had to be aroused to flight by the friendly orders of the retreating  British officers. The Red Cross workers, the Dames de France, and a  group of courageous American women--the Smith College girls--aided the  refugees day and night in their retreat from town to town until the  German advance was checked a few miles short of Amiens.    The American Red Cross transported thousands from the towns and villages  behind the British lines, working thirty automobiles night and day, and  carrying 2,000 to friends in Paris in the first few days. These were  mostly women, children, and aged persons who had been awakened by the  Red Cross workers on the morning of the 25th, taken to the railroad in  trucks, and thence transported by rail in special trains. Most of the  refugees were able to save only a few of their belongings, which were  wrapped up in shawls and bed sheets, or carried in baskets or handbags.  One woman, 81 years old, carried only a basket of live chickens, and  cried because she had been unable to save two rabbits. Another woman  carried a few cooking utensils under her arm. Many women and children  were crying because they had been separated from relatives and friends.  Children only a month old and people who had reached the age of 90 were  alike numbered among the unfortunates.      TRAGIC SCENES    \"I saw the first tide of these poor people when the Germans came near to  Ham and Peronne and Roye,\" wrote Philip Gibbs on March 29. \"Some of them  had been once in the hands of the Germans, and at this second menace  they left their homes and their fields and their shops, and came  trekking westward and southward.    \"One's heart bleeds to see these refugees, and it is the most tragic  aspect of these days. There are many old people among them, old women in  black gowns and caps who come hobbling very slowly down the highway of  war, and old men with bent backs who lean"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38767"],[0,"Spanish Highways and Byways (#15)"],[1," second brotherhood of San Lorenzo, bearing the Most Blessed  Virgin in her Solitude. The gold of her mantle seemed one with the  gold of the candle rays, and, for many a silent watcher, those  gliding, gleaming, spiritlike forms will move forever down a shining  path in memory. So closed the Holy Week processions.    \"How sorry I am,\" said our host, with the Andalusian twinkle in his  eye. \"It is almost eleven o'clock. Ladies and gentlemen, will you  please walk out to dinner?\"    On Saturday morning we went early to the cathedral for the closing  rite. The Sagrario was thronged. Some of the senoras had brought low  folding chairs with them, others sat upon the floor, but most of that  innumerable congregation knelt or stood. We were all facing the great  purple veil which concealed the high altar, with Roldan's retablo of  the Descent from the Cross. There was an hour or more of expectation,  during which rosaries slipped through the fingers of many a veiled  nun, and the soft murmur of prayer came from strong men as well as  from pale-faced women. Suddenly, while a shock of thunder crashed from  the organ, hidden ministrants sharply drew on hidden cords, the purple  curtain parted in the midst, and the two folds rolled asunder,  revealing the high altar, with its carving of the accomplished  Passion. The organ poured forth jubilees of victory, all the bells of  the cathedral pealed together, _Gloria in Excelsis_ soared in choral  chant, and amid the awe-stricken multitudes fallen to their knees, _Su  Majestad_ was borne in priestly procession from the tomb in the Royal  Chapel to the candles and incense which awaited at the high altar that  triumphal coming.    Easter Sunday was celebrated by a bull-fight.          VII    TRACES OF THE INQUISITION         \"I live a life more great than I.       The life I hope is life so high,       I die because I cannot die.\"                                  --_Santa Teresa de Jesus._      All Spaniards venerate the name of _Isabel la Catolica_, nor is the  impressionable De Amicis the only foreigner who has trembled and wept  at Granada before the enshrined memorials, jewel box, mirror, missal,  and crown, of her royal womanhood. She is a precious figure in Spain's  sunset revery--a saint beneath a conquering standard, a silken lady in  a soldier's tent. Yet this peerless queen, merciful, magnanimous,  devout, \"the shield of the innocent,\" caring supremely for the glory  of God and the good of her country, gave consent, albeit reluctant, to  the establishment of the Inquisition, Christianity's chief scandal and  Spain's most fatal blight. So ironic were the stars of Isabel.    The Inquisition, it is true, originated in Italy early in the  thirteenth century and followed the flight of some of the Albigenses  into Aragon, but its work in Spain had been comparatively slight and  merciful until the \"Catholic Kings,\" in the interests of religious  reform, for the purification of the national faith, let its horrors  loose. Wherever one moves in Spain the sickening breath of the _auto  de fe_ lingers in the air. In such a square, we read, was once a  mighty bonfire of Jews; beneath our feet, we are told, is a mass of  human bones and cinders. This sunshiny Seville, with her parks and  patios, her palms and orange groves, a city seemingly fashioned only  for love and song, had her army of nearly twoscore thousand martyrs,  who, dressed in the hateful _San Benitos_, yellow coats painted with  flames and devils, were burned to death here in our gay _Plaza de la  Constitucion_, then known as the _Plaza de San Francisco_, and in the  _Quemadero_ beyond the walls. As one mingles with some outdoor throng,  all intent on pageant, dance, or other spectacle, one shudders to  remember that just such dark, eager faces were ringed about the  agonies of those heroic victims. For there are two sides to the  Spanish Inquisition. If Spaniards were the inquisitors, Spaniards,  too, were the dauntless sufferers. The sombre gaze of the torturer was  met, as steel meets iron, by the unflinching eye of the tortured. But  \"the unimaginable touch of Time\" transforms all tragedy to beauty, and  red poppies, blowing on the grassy plain of the _Quemadero_, translate  into poetry to-day that tale of blazing fagots.    Sometimes the victims were of foreign blood. Hakluyt has preserved the  simple narratives of two English sailors, who were brought by their  Spanish captors from the Indies as a sacrifice to the Holy House of  Seville. One, a happy-go-lucky fellow, Miles Phillips, who had been  too well acquainted in Mexico with the dungeons of the Inquisition,  slipped over the ship's side at San Lucar, made his way to shore, and  boldly went to Seville, where he lived a hidden life as a silk-weaver,  until he found his chance to steal away and board a Devon  merchantman. The other, Job Hortop, added to his two years of Mexican  imprisonment two more years in Seville. Then \"they brought us out in  procession, every one of us having a candle in his hand, and the coat  with S. Andrew's cross on our backs; they brought us up on an high  scaffold, that was set up in the place of S. Francis, which is in the  chief street of Seville; there they set us down upon benches, every  one in his degree, and against us on another scaffold sate all the  Judges and the Clergy on their benches. The people wondered, and gazed  on us, some pitying our case, others said, burn those heretics. When  we had sat there two hours, we had a sermon made to us, after which  one called Bresinia, secretary to the Inquisition, went up into the  pulpit with the process, and called Robert Barret, ship-master, and  John Gilbert, whom two Familiars of the Inquisition brought from the  scaffold before the Judges, where the secretary read the sentence,  which was that they should be burnt, and so they returned to the  scaffold, and were burnt.    \"Then I, Job Hortop, and John Bone, were called, and brought to the  place, as before, when we heard our sentence, which was, that we  should go to the Galleys, and there to row at the oar's end ten years,  and then to be brought back to the Inquisition House, to have the coat  with S. Andrew's cross put on our backs, and from thence to go to the  everlasting prison remediless.    \"I with the rest were sent to the Galleys, where we were chained four  and four together.... Hunger, thirst, cold, and stripes we lacked  none, till our several times expired, and after the time of twelve  years, for I served two years above my sentence, I was sent back to  the Inquisition House in Seville, and there having put on the coat  with S. Andrew's cross, I was sent to the everlasting prison  remediless, where I wore the coat four years, and then upon great suit  I had it taken off for fifty duckets, which Hernando de Soria,  treasurer of the king's mint, lent me, whom I was to serve for it as a  drudge seven years.\"    But this victim, too, escaped in a fly-boat at last, and on a certain  Christmas Eve, about the time when people in London were beginning to  like the comedies of a certain poor player, one Will Shakespeare, did  Job Hortop, Powder-maker and Gunner, walk quietly, after twenty-three  years of martyrdom, into the village of Redcliffe, where he had been a  ruddy English boy with no dream of the day when he should be \"prest  forth\" by Sir John Hawkins and compelled, sore against his will, to  embark for the West Indian adventure.    Religious liberty now exists under the laws of Spain, although the  administration of those laws leaves much to be desired. In three old  conventual churches of Seville gather her three Protestant  congregations. Beneath the pavements of two of these heretic  strongholds old inquisitors sleep what uneasy sleep they may, while  one of the Protestant pastors, formerly a Catholic priest, has quietly  collected and stored in his church-study numerous mementos of the Holy  Office. Here may be seen two of those rare copies of the 1602 revision  of the Spanish Bible, by Cipriano de Valera, whom the Inquisition  could burn only in effigy, since the translator, who had printed his  book in Amsterdam, did not return to accompany the Familiars to the  _Quemadero_. Here are old books with horrible woodcuts of the  torments, and time-stained manuscripts, several bearing the seal and  signatures of the \"Catholic Kings,\" these last so ill written that it  is hard to tell the name of Ferdinand from that of Isabella. Among  these are royal commissions, or licenses, granted to individual  inquisitors, records of _autos de fe_, and wills of rich inquisitors,  the sources of whose wealth would hardly court a strict examination.  Here, too, is the standard of the Holy Office, the very banner borne  through Seville in those grim processions. Its white silk is saffroned  now, but the strange seal of the Inquisition, a bleeding Christ upon  the cross, is clearly blazoned in the centre, while the four corners  show the seal of San Domingo.    The Inquisition prison, the dreaded Holy House of Seville, is used as  a factory at present, and heresy no longer secures admission there;  but I looked up at its grated windows, and then, with a secret shiver,  down on the ground, where the Spanish pastor of antiquarian tastes was  marking out with his cane the directions of the far-branching  subterranean cells. We slipped into an outer court of the _fabrica_,  where the two gentlemen, effectively aided by a couple of sturdy lads,  pried up and flung back a sullen door in the pavement and invited me  to grope my darkling way down some twenty crumbling steps, overgrown  with a treacherous green mould. There was no refusing, in face of the  cloud of witnesses whose groans these stones had heard, and I took a  heart-breaking plunge into the honeycomb of chill, foul-smelling,  horror-haunted dungeons, whose roofs let fall a constant drip of water  and from whose black recesses I was the unwilling means of"]]]
