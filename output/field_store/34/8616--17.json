The wish of the nation is, that the government shall not  be obstructed in its endeavors to act for the public good, and  that the head of Medusa shall no longer show itself, either in  our tribunes or in our assemblies. The conduct of Sieyes, on this  occasion, completely proves that having contributed to the destruction  of all the constitutions since '91, he wishes now to try his hand  against the present. He ought to burn a wax candle to Our Lady, for  having got out of the scrape so fortunately and in so unexpected  a manner. But the older I grow, the more I perceive that each man  must fulfill his destiny. I recommend you to ascertain whether the  provisions for St. Domingo have actually been sent off. I take it  for granted that you have taken proper measures for demolishing  the Chatelet.

I also wish some  individual, like citizen Royer, to perform the same duty for the  13th and 14th divisions. It is complained that the receivers keep  the money as long as they can, and that the paymasters postpone  payment as long as possible. The paymasters and the receivers are  the greatest nuisance in the state.\"    \"Yesterday I visited several factories. I was pleased with the  industry and the severe economy which pervaded these establishments.  Should the wintry weather continue severe, I do not think that the  $25,000 a month, which the Minister of the Interior grants for the  purposes of charity, will be sufficient. It will be necessary to  add five thousand dollars for the distribution of wood, and also  to light fires in the churches and other large buildings to give  warmth to a great number of people.\"    Napoleon arrived in Paris on the 31st of January. In the mean time,  there had been a new election of members of the Tribunate and of  the Legislative body. All those who had manifested any opposition  to the measures of Napoleon, in the re-establishment of Christianity,  and in the adoption of the new civil code, were left out, and their  places supplied by those who approved of the measures of the First  Consul. Napoleon could now act unembarrassed. In every quarter  there was submission. All the officers of the state, immediately  upon his return, sought an audience, and in that pomp of language  which his majestic deeds and character inspired, presented to him  their congratulations. He was already a sovereign, in possession  of regal power, such as no other monarch in Europe enjoyed. Upon  one object all the energies of his mighty mind were concentrated.  France was his estate, his diadem, his all. The glory of France  was his glory, the happiness of France his happiness, the riches of  France his wealth. Never did a father with more untiring self-denial  and toil labor for his family, than did Napoleon through days of  Herculean exertion and nights of sleeplessness devote every energy  of body and soul to the greatness of France. He loved not ease, he  loved not personal indulgence, he loved not sensual gratification.  The elevation of France to prosperity, wealth, and power, was  a limitless ambition. The almost supernatural success which had  thus far attended his exertions, did but magnify his desires and  stimulate his hopes. He had no wish to elevate France upon the ruins  of other nations. But he wished to make France the pattern of all  excellence, the illustrious leader at the head of all nations,  guiding them to intelligence, to opulence, and to happiness. Such,  at this time, was the towering ambition of Napoleon, the most noble  and comprehensive which was ever embraced by the conception of man.  Of course, such ambition was not consistent with the equality of  other nations for he determined that France should be the first. But  he manifested no disposition to destroy the prosperity of others;  he only wished to give such an impulse to humanity in France, by  the culture of mind, by purity of morals, by domestic industry, by  foreign commerce, by great national works, as to place France in  the advance upon the race course of greatness. In this race France  had but one antagonist--England. France had nearly forty millions  of inhabitants. The island of Great Britain contained but about  fifteen millions. But England, with her colonies, girdled the globe,  and, with her fleets, commanded all seas. \"France,\" said Napoleon,  \"must also have her colonies and her fleets.\" \"If we permit that,\"  the statesman of England rejoined, \"we may become a secondary  power, and may thus be at the mercy of France.\" It was undeniably  so. Shall history be blind to such fatality as this? Is man, in the  hour of triumphant ambition, so moderate, that we can be willing  that he should attain power which places us at his mercy? England  was omnipotent upon the seas. She became arrogant, and abused that  power, and made herself offensive to all nations. Napoleon developed  no special meekness of character to indicate that he would be, in  the pride of strength which no nation could resist, more moderate  and conciliating. Candor can not censure England for being unwilling to  yield her high position to surrender her supremacy on the seas--to  become a secondary power--to allow France to become her master. And  who can censure France for seeking the establishment of colonies,  the extension of commerce, friendly alliance with other nations,  and the creation of fleets to protect her from aggression upon  the ocean, as well as upon the land? Napoleon himself, with that  wonderful magnanimity which ever characterized him, though at  times exasperated by the hostility which he now encountered yet  often spoke in terms of respect of the influences which animated  his foes. It is to be regretted that his antagonists so seldom  reciprocated this magnanimity. There was here, most certainly, a  right and a wrong. But it is not easy for man accurately to adjust  the balance. God alone can award the issue. The mind is saddened as  it wanders amid the labyrinths of conscientiousness and of passion,  of pure motives and impure ambition. This is, indeed, a fallen  world. The drama of nations is a tragedy. Melancholy is the lot of  man.    England daily witnessed, with increasing alarm, the rapid and  enormous strides which France was making. The energy of the First  Consul seemed superhuman. His acts indicated the most profound  sagacity, the most far-reaching foresight. To-day the news reaches  London that Napoleon has been elected President of the Italian  Republic. Thus in an hour five millions of people are added to  his empire! To-morrow it is announced that he is establishing a  colony at Elba, that a vast expedition is sailing for St. Domingo,  to re-organize the colony there. England is bewildered. Again it  is proclaimed that Napoleon has purchased Louisiana of Spain, and  is preparing to fill the fertile valley of the Mississippi with  colonists. In the mean time, all France is in a state of activity.  Factories, roads, bridges, canals, fortifications are every where  springing into existence. The sound of the ship hammer reverberates  in all the harbors of France, and every month witnesses the increase  of the French fleet. The mass of the English people contemplate  with admiration this development of energy. The statesmen of England  contemplate it with dread.    For some months, Napoleon, in the midst of all his other cares, had  been maturing a vast system of public instruction for the youth of  France. He drew up, with his own hand, the plan for their schools,  and proposed the course of study. It is a little singular that,  with his strong scientific predilections, he should have assigned  the first rank to classical studies. Perhaps this is to be accounted  for from his profound admiration of the heroes of antiquity. His  own mind was most thoroughly stored with all the treasures of Greek  and Roman story. All these schools were formed upon a military  model, for situated as France was, in the midst of monarchies, at  heart hostile, he deemed it necessary that the nation should be  universally trained to bear arms. Religious instruction was to be  communicated in all these schools by chaplains, military instruction  by old officers who had left the army, and classical and scientific  instruction by the most learned men Europe could furnish. The First  Consul also devoted special attention to female schools. \"France  needs nothing so much to promote her regeneration,\" said he, \"as  good mothers.\" To attract the youth of France to these schools,  one millions of dollars was appropriated for over six thousand  gratuitous exhibitions for the pupils. Ten schools of law were  established, nine schools of medicine, and an institution for the  mechanical arts, called the \"School of Bridges and Roads,\" the  first model of those schools of art which continue in France until  the present day, and which are deemed invaluable. There were no  exclusive privileges in these institutions. A system of perfect  equality pervaded them. The pupils of all classes were placed upon  a level, with an unobstructed arena before them. \"This is only  a commencement,\" said Napoleon, \"by-and-by we shall do more and  better.\"    Another project which Napoleon now introduced was vehemently  opposed--the establishment of the Legion of Honor. One of the leading  principles of the revolution was the entire overthrow of all titles  of distinction. Every man, high or low, was to be addressed simply  as Citizen . Napoleon wished to introduce a system of rewards which  should stimulate to heroic deeds, and which should ennoble"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3777"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle; Or, Daring Adventures in Elephant Land (#15)"],[1,"tive, who was unconscious now, toppled to one side.    \"Tom's killed him with the electric rifle!\" cried Mr. Durban.    \"Bless my incandescent lamp! so he has,\" agreed Mr. Damon. \"Bless my  dynamo! but that's a wonderful gun, it's as powerful as a  thunderbolt, or as gentle as a summer shower.\"    Mr. Durban seeing that the lion was dead, in that brief glance he  had had of the brute, called to some of the natives to come and get  their tribesman. They came, timidly enough at first, carrying many  torches, but when they understood that the lion was dead, they  advanced more boldly. They carried the wounded black to a hut, where  they applied their simple but effective remedies for the cruel bite  in his shoulder.    After Tom had shot several other of the illuminated charges into the  jungle, to see if he could discover any more lions, but failed to do  so, he and his friends returned to the anchored airship, amid the  murmured thanks of the Africans.    Bright fires were kept blazing all the rest of the night, but,  though lions could be heard roaring in the jungle, and though they  approached alarmingly close to the place where our friends were  encamped, none of the savage brutes ventured within the clearing.    With the valuable store of ivory aboard the Black Hawk, which was  now completely repaired, an early start was made the next morning.  The Africans besought Tom and his companions to remain, for it was  not often they could have the services of white men in slaying  elephants and lions.    \"But, we've got to get on the trail,\" decided Tom, when the natives  had brought great stores of food, and such simple presents as they  possessed, to induce the travelers to remain.    \"Every hour may add to the danger of the missionaries in the hands  of the red pygmies.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mr. Anderson gravely, \"it is our duty to save them.\"    And so the airship mounted into the air, our friends waving  farewells to the simple-hearted blacks, who did a sort of farewell  war-dance in their honor, shouting their praises aloud, and beating  the drums and tom-toms, so that the echoes followed for some time  after the Black Hawk had begun to mount upward toward the sky.    The craft was in excellent shape, due to the overhauling Tom had  given it while making the repairs. With the propellers beating the  air, and the rudder set to hold them about two thousand feet high,  the travelers moved rapidly over clearings, forests and jungles.    It was agreed that now, when they had made such a good start in  collecting ivory, that they would spend the next few days in trying  to get on the trail of the red pygmies. It might seem a simple  matter, after knowing the approximate location of the land of these  fierce little natives, to have proceeded directly to it. But Africa  is an immense continent, and even in an airship comparatively little  of the interior can be seen at a time.    Besides, the red pygmies had a habit of moving from place to place,  and they were so small, and so wild, capable of living in very tiny  huts or caves, and so primitive, not building regular villages as  the other Africans do, that as Ned said, they were as hard to locate  as the proverbial flea.    Our friends had a general idea of where to look for them, but on  nearing that land, and making inquiries of several friendly tribes,  they learned that the red pygmies had suddenly disappeared from  their usual haunts.    \"I guess they heard that we were after them,\" said Tom, with a grim  smile one day, as he sent the airship down toward the earth, for  they were over a great plain, and several native villages could be  seen dotted on its surface.    \"More likely they are in hiding because they have as captives two  white persons,\" said Mr. Anderson. \"They are fierce and fearless,  but, nevertheless, they have, in times past, felt the vengeance of  the white man, and perhaps they dread that now.\"    They made a descent, and spent several days making inquiries from  the friendly blacks about the race of little men. But scarcely  anything was learned. Some of the negro tribes admitted having heard  of the red pygmies, and others, with superstitious incantations and  imprecations, said they had never heard of them.    One tribe of very large negroes had heard a rumor to the effect that  the band of the pygmies was several days' journey from their  village, across the mountains, and when Tom sent his airship there,  the searchers only found an impenetrable jungle, filled with lions  and other wild beasts, but not a sign of the pygmies, and with no  elephants to reward their search.    \"But we're not going to give up,\" declared Tom, and the others  agreed with him. Forward went the Black Hawk in the search for the  imprisoned ones, but, as the days passed, and no news was had, it  seemed to grow more and more hopeless.    \"I'm afraid if we do find them now,\" remarked Mr. Anderson at  length, \"that we'll only recover the bodies of the missionaries.\"    \"Then we'll avenge them,\" said Tom quietly.    They had stopped at another native village to make inquiries, but  without result, and were about to start off again that night when a  runner came in to announce that a herd of big elephants was feeding  not many miles away.    \"Well, we'll stay over a day or so, and get some more ivory,\"  decided Mr. Durban and that night they got ready for what was to  prove a big hunt.          CHAPTER XVII    SHOTS FROM ABOVE      \"There they are!\"    \"My, what a lot of big ones!\"    \"Jove! Mr. Anderson, see those tusks!\"    \"Yes, you ought to get what you want this time, Mr. Durban.\"    \"Bless my hatband! There must be two hundred of them!\" exclaimed Mr.  Damon.    \"I'm glad I recharged my rifle last night!\" exclaimed Tom Swift.  \"It's fully loaded now.\"    Then followed exulting cries and shouts of the natives, who were  following our friends, the elephant hunters, who had given voice to  the remarks we have just quoted.    It was early in the morning, and the hunt was about to start, for  the news brought in by the runner the night before had been closely  followed by the brutes themselves, and at dawn our friends were  astir, for scouts brought in word that the elephants, including many  big ones, were passing along only a few miles from the African  village.    Cautiously approaching, with the wind blowing from the elephants to  them, the white hunters made their way along. Mr. Durban was in the  lead, and when he saw a favorable opportunity he motioned for the  others to advance. Then, when he noticed the big bull sentinels of  the herd look about as if to detect the presence of enemies, he gave  another signal and the hunters sank out of sight in the tall grass.    As for the natives, they were like snakes, unseen but ever present,  wriggling along on their hands and knees. They were awaiting the  slaughter, when there would be fresh meat in abundance.    At length the old elephant hunter decided that they were near enough  to chance some shots. As a matter of fact, Tom Swift, with his  electric rifle, had been within range some time before, but as he  did not want to spoil the sport for the others, by firing and  killing, and so alarming the herd, he had held back. Now they could  all shoot together.    \"Let her go!\" suddenly cried Mr. Durban, and they took aim.    There was a fusillade of reports and several of the big brutes  toppled over.    \"Bless my toothbrush!\" cried Mr. Damon, \"that's the time I got one!\"    \"Yes, and a fine specimen, too!\" added Mr. Durban, who had only  succeeded in downing a small bull, with an indifferent pair of  tusks. \"A fine specimen, Mr. Damon, I congratulate you!\"    As for Tom Swift, he had killed two of the largest elephants in the  herd.    But now the hunters had their work cut out for them, since the  beasts had taken fright and were charging away at what seemed an  awkward gait, but which, nevertheless, took them rapidly over the  ground.    \"Come on!\" cried Mr. Durban. \"We must get some more. Some of the  finest tusks I have ever seen are running away from us!\"    He began to race after the retreating herd, but it is doubtful if he  would have caught up to them had not a band of natives, who had  crept up and surrounded the beasts, turned them by shouts and the  beating of tom-toms. Seeing an enemy in front of them, the elephants  turned, and our friends were able to get in several more shots. Tom  Swift picked out only those with immense tusks, and soon had several  to his credit. Ned Newton also bagged some prizes.    But finally the elephants, driven to madness by the firing and the  yells of the natives, broke through the line of black men, and  charged off into the jungle, where it was not only useless but  dangerous to follow them.    \"Well, we have enough,\" said Mr. Durban, and when the tusks had been  collected it was found that indeed a magnificent and valuable supply  had been gathered.    \"But I have yet to get my prize ones,\" said the old hunter with a  sigh. \"Maybe we'll find the elephant with them when we locate the  red pygmies.\"    \"If we do, we'll have our work cut out for us,\" declared Tom.    As on the other occasion after the hunt, there was a great feast for  the natives, who invited tribes from miles around, and for two days,  while the tusks were being cut out and cleaned, there were barbeques  on every side.    It was one afternoon, when they were seated in the shade of the  airship, cleaning their guns, and discussing the plans they had best  follow next, that our travellers suddenly heard a great commotion  amongst the Africans, who had for the past hour been very quiet,  most of them sleeping after the feasts. They yelled and shouted, and  began to beat their drums.    \"Something is coming,\" said Ned.    \"Perhaps there's going to be a fight,\" suggested Tom.    \"Maybe it's the red pygmies,\" said Mr. Damon. \"Bless my--\"    But what he was going to bless he did not say, for at that instant  it"]]]
