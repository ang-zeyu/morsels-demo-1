As the bushes about them were stripped of the best fruit, the shaggy  feasters moved around the shoulder of the mountain from the gold of  the sun into the silver of the moon. Soon the sunset had faded, and  the moon had it all her own way except for a broad expanse of  sea-green sky in the west, deepening through violet to a narrow streak  of copper on the horizon. By this time the shadows, especially on the  eastern slope, were very sharp and black, and the open spaces very  white and radiant, with a strange transparency borrowed from that  high, pure atmosphere.    It chanced that the little hollow on which the bears were just now  revelling,--a hollow where the blueberries were unbelievably large and  abundant--was bounded on its upper side, toward the steep, by a narrow  and deep crevice. At one end of the cleft, from a rocky and shallow  roothold, a gnarled birch grew slantingly. From its unusual situation,  and from the fact that the bushes grew thick to its very edge, this  crevice constituted nothing less than a most insidious trap.    One of the cubs, born with the instinct of caution, kept far away from  the dangerous brink without having more than half realized that there  was any danger there whatever. The other cub was one of those  blundering fellows, to be found among the wild kindreds no less than  among the kindreds of men, who only get caution hammered into them by  experience. He saw a narrow break, indeed, between the berry patch and  the bare steep above,--but what was a little crevice in a position  like this, where it could not amount to anything? Had it been on the  other side of the hollow, he would have feared a precipice, and would  have been on his guard. But, as it was, he never gave the matter a  second thought, because it did not look dangerous! He found the best  berries growing very near the edge of the crevice; and in his  satisfaction he turned his back to the height and settled himself  solidly upon his haunches to enjoy them. As he did so the bushes gave  way behind him, he pitched abruptly backwards, and vanished with a  squeal of terror into the narrow cleft of darkness.    The crevice was perhaps twelve feet deep, and from five to eight in  width all the way to the bottom. The bottom held a layer of earth and  dead leaves, which served to ease the cub's fall; but when he landed  the wind was so bumped out of him that for a minute or two he could  not utter a sound. As soon as he recovered his voice, however, he  began to squeal and whine piteously for his mother.    The old bear, at the sound of his cry as he fell, had rushed so  hastily to his aid that she barely escaped falling in after him.  Checking herself just in time, by digging all her mighty claws into  the roots of the blueberries, she crouched at the brink, thrust her  head as far over as she could, and peered down with anxious cries. But  when the cub's voice came back to her from the darkness she knew he  was not killed, and she also knew that he was very near,--and her  whinings changed at once to a guttural murmur that must have been  intended for encouragement. The other cub, meanwhile, had come  lumbering up with ears wisely cocked, taken a very hasty and careful  glance over the edge, and returned to his blueberries with an air of  disapproval. It was as if he said he always knew that blundering  brother of his would get himself into trouble.    For some minutes the old bear crouched where she was, straining her  eyes to make out the form of her little one. Becoming accustomed to  the gloom at last, she could discern him. She could see that he was  moving about, and standing on his hind legs, and striving valiantly to  claw his way up the perpendicular surface of smooth rock. She began to  reach downwards first one big forepaw and then the other, testing the  rock beneath her for some ledge or crack that might give her foothold  by which to climb down to his aid. Finding none, she again set up her  uneasy whining, and moved slowly along the brink, trying every inch of  the way for some place rough enough to give her strong claws a chance  to take hold. In the full, unclouded light of the white moon she was a  pathetic figure, bending and crouching and straining, and reaching  down longingly, then stopping to listen to the complaints of pain and  terror that came up out of the dark.    At last she came to the end of the crevice where grew the solitary  birch tree,--the frightened captive following exactly below her and  stretching up toward her against the rock. At this point, close beside  the tree, some roots and tough turf overhung the edge, and the old  bear's paws detected a roughness on the face of the rock just below.  This was enough for her brave and devoted heart. She turned around and  let her hind quarters carefully over the brink, intending to climb  down backwards as bears do. But beyond the first unevenness there was  absolutely nothing that her claws could take hold of. Her great body  was half way over, when she felt herself on the point of falling.  Making a sudden startled effort to recover herself, she clutched  desperately at the trunk of the birch tree with one arm, at the roots  of the berry-bushes with the other,--and just managed to regain the  level.    For herself, this mighty effort was just enough. But for the  birch-tree it was just too much. The shallow earth by which it held  gave way; and the next moment, with a clatter of loosened stones and a  swish of leafy branches, it crashed majestically down into the  crevice, closing one end of it with a mass of boughs and foliage, and  once more frightening the imprisoned cub almost out of his senses.    At the first sound of this cataclysm, at the first rattle of loose  earth about his ears, the cub had bounced madly to the other end of  the crevice, where he crouched, whimpering. The old bear, too, was  daunted for some seconds; but then, seeing that the cub was not hurt,  she was quick to perceive the advantage of the accident. Standing at  the upturned roots of the tree, she called eagerly and encouragingly  to the cub, pointing out the path of escape thus offered to him. For  some minutes he was too terrified to approach. At last she set her own  weight on the trunk, testing it, and prepared to climb down and lead  him out. At this, however, the youngster's nerve revived. With a  joyful and understanding squeal, he rushed forward, sprawled and  clawed his way over the tangle of branches, gained the firm  trunk,--and presently found himself again beside his mother among the  pleasant, moonlit berry-bushes. Here he was fondled and nosed and  licked and nursed by the delighted mother, till his bruised little  body forgot its hurts and his shaken little heart its fears. His  cautious brother, too, came up with a wise look and sniffed at him  patronizingly; but went away again with his nose in the air, as if to  say that here was much fuss being made over a very small matter.          THE GLUTTON OF THE GREAT SNOW      I    NORTHWARD interminably, and beneath a whitish, desolate sky, stretched  the white, empty leagues of snow, unbroken by rock or tree or hill, to  the straight, menacing horizon. Green-black, and splotched with snow  that clung here and there upon their branches, along the southward  limits of the barren crowded down the serried ranks of the ancient fir  forest. Endlessly baffled, but endlessly unconquered, the hosts of the  firs thrust out their grim spire-topped vanguards, at intervals, into  the hostile vacancy of the barren. Between these dark vanguards, long,  silent aisles of whiteness led back and gently upward into the heart  of the forest.    Out across one of these pale corridors of silence came moving very  deliberately a dark, squat shape with blunt muzzle close to the snow.  Its keen, fierce eyes and keener nostrils were scrutinizing the white  surface for the scent or trail of some other forest wanderer.  Conscious of power, in spite of its comparatively small stature--much  less than that of wolf or lynx, or even of the fox--it made no effort  to conceal its movements, disguise its track or keep watch for  possible enemies. Stronger than any other beast of thrice its size, as  cunning as the wisest of the foxes, and of a dogged, savage temper  well known to all the kindred of the wild, it seemed to feel secure  from ill-considered interference.    Less than three feet in length, but of peculiarly massive build, this  dark, ominous-looking animal walked flat-footed, like a bear, and with  a surly heaviness worthy of a bear's stature. Its fur, coarse and  long, was of a sooty gray-brown, streaked coarsely down each flank  with a broad yellowish splash meeting over the hind quarters. Its  powerful, heavy-clawed feet were black. Its short muzzle and massive  jaw, and its broad face up to just above the eyes, where the fur came  down thickly, were black also. The eyes themselves, peering out  beneath overhanging brows, gleamed with a mixture of sullen  intelligence and implacable savagery. In its slow, forbidding  strength, and in its tameless reserve, which yet held the capacity for  outbursts of ungovernable rage, this strange beast seemed to incarnate  the very spirit of the bitter and indomitable North. Its name was  various, for hunters called it sometimes wolverene, sometimes  carcajou, but oftener \"Glutton,\" or \"Injun Devil.\"    Through the voiceless desolation the carcajou--it was a female--continued  her leisurely way. Presently, just upon the edge of the forest-growth,  she came upon the fresh track of a huge lynx. The prints of the lynx's  great pads were several times broader than her own, but she stopped  and began to examine them without the slightest trace of apprehension. For  some reason best known to herself, she at length made up her mind to  pursue the stranger's back trail,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30000"],[0,"The Bird Book (#15)"],[1,"Gulf. The males of these birds may be identified  by the white speculum and the chestnut wing coverts. Gadwalls nest on  the ground among the reeds of marshes or in the long grass of bordering  fields; they make little or no nest but line the cavity with down from  their breasts. They lay from seven to twelve eggs of a creamy buff  color. Size 2.10 x 1.60. Data.--Benson Co., North Dakota, June 19, 1898.  Eight eggs. Nest on the ground among rank grass on a low island in  Devils Lake. Made of weeds lined with down. Collector, E. S. Rolfe.      136. WIDGEON. _Mareca penelope_.    Range.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding in America, only in the Aleutian  Islands; rare or accidental in other parts of the country.    The European Widgeon is similar in build and plumage to the following  species, except that the whole head, with the exception of the white  crown, is chestnut. They build their nests in the rushes, making them of  reeds and grass and lining them with feathers. They lay from six to ten  light buff colored eggs. Size 2.20 x 1.50.    [Illustration 093: Creamy buff.]  [Illustration: Gadwall. Widgeon.]  [Illustration: Pale buff.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 92    137. BALDPATE. _Mareca americana._    Range.--North America, breeding in the interior from Texas north to  Hudson Bay.    The Baldpate (so-called because of the white crown) or American Widgeon  is a handsomely marked bird and is regarded as a great table delicacy.  The male birds cannot be mistaken for any other species because of the  white crown, wing coverts and underparts and the broad green stripe,  back of the eye. They breed locally in many parts of the country,  building their nests of grass and weeds, neatly lined with feathers, on  the ground in marshes. They lay from six to twelve creamy eggs. Size  2.15 x 1.50. Data.--Lac Aux Morts, North Dakota. Eight eggs. Nest of  grass and down on ground in a grassy meadow. Collector, E. S. Bryant.      138. EUROPEAN TEAL. _Nettion crecca._    An old world species that is casually found on both coasts of America.      139. GREEN-WINGED TEAL. _Nettion carolinense._    Range.--Whole of North America, breeding chiefly north of the United  States.    A small, handsome species, the male of which can readily be identified  by the reddish brown head and neck, with the large green patch behind  each ear; length fourteen inches. Green-winged Teals are our smallest  representative of the Duck family. They are eagerly sought by sportsmen,  both because of their beauty and the excellence of their flesh. They are  among the most common of Ducks in the interior, where they nest  generally in tufts of grass along ponds, lakes or brooks. Nest of grass  and weeds, lined with down from the bird. Eggs buffy, four to ten in  number. Size 1.85 x 1.25.    [Illustration 094: Creamy white.]  [Illustration: Baldpate. Green-winged Teal.]  [Illustration: Buff.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 93    140. BLUE-WINGED TEAL. _Querquedula discors_.    Range.--North America, breeding from northern United States northward;  rare on the Pacific coast.    Another small species, known by the blue wing coverts and the white  crescent in front of eye. They nest in the same localities with the  preceding species, placing their nest of grass and weeds on the ground  in meadows near water. Eggs buffy white. Six to twelve in number. Size  1.90 x 1.30.      141. CINNAMON TEAL. _Querquedula cyanoptera_.    Range.--Western United States, chiefly west of the Rocky Mountains.  Casually east to Texas, Illinois and British Columbia.    The Cinnamon Teal is another small Duck, marked by the uniform rich  chestnut plumage and light blue wing coverts. The speculum is green. The  nesting habits are the same as those of the Teals, the nests being  placed on the ground in marshes or fields near water. Their nests are  closely woven of grass and weeds and lined with down and feathers from  the breast of the bird. The eggs are pale buff and number from six to  fourteen. Size 1.85 x 1.35.      141.1. RUDDY SHELDRAKE. _Casarca ferruginea._    This is an Old World species that has accidentally occurred in  Greenland.    [Illustration 095: Blue-winged Teal.

SHOVELLER. _Spatula clypeata._    Range.--Whole of North America, breeding in the interior from Texas  northward.    This strikingly marked Duck is twenty inches in length, has a green head  and speculum, blue wing coverts and chestnut belly. The bill is long and  broad at the tip. It makes its nest on the ground in marshy places, of  grass, weeds and feathers. Six to ten eggs constitute a complete set.  They are greenish or leaden gray color. Size 2.10 x 1.50.  Data.--Graham's Island, North Dakota, May 28, 1899. Nest of dead weed  stems and grass, lined with down. Ten eggs. Collector, E. S. Bryant.      143. PINTAIL. _Dafila acuta._    Range.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding in North America from northern  United States northward, wintering south to Panama. This species, which  is also known as the Sprig-tail, is very common in the United States in  the spring and fall migrations. It is about thirty inches long, its  length depending upon the development of the tail feathers, the central  ones of which are long and pointed. They breed casually in many sections  of the United States, but in abundance from Manitoba to the Arctic  Ocean. They nest near the water, laying from six to twelve eggs of dull  olive color. Size 2.20 x 1.50. Data.--Graham's Island, Devil's Lake, N.  Dakota, June 15, 1900. Ten eggs. Nest on the ground, of weeds, lined  with down. Colony breeding. Collector, E. S. Bryant.

WOOD DUCK. _Aix sponsa._    Range.--Temperate North America, breeding from Labrador and British  Columbia south to Florida.    Bridal Duck is a name often given to this, the most beautiful of all  Ducks.    They are beautifully marked, have a large crest, and are iridescent with  all colors of the rainbow. They frequent wooded country near ponds and  lakes, feeding on water insects and mollusks in the coves. They build  their nests in hollow trees and stumps, often at quite a distance from  the water. When the young are a few days old, they slide, scramble, or  flutter down the tree trunk to the ground below, and are led to the  water. The nest is made of twigs, weeds and grass, and warmly lined with  down. The eggs are a buff color and number eight to fifteen. Size 2. x  1.5.      145. RUFOUS-CRESTED DUCK. _Netta rufina._    A European species; a single specimen taken on Long Island in 1872.      146. REDHEAD. _Marila americana._    Range.--North America at large, breeding from northern United States  northward, chiefly in the interior.    A bird commonly seen in the markets where it is often sold as the  following species because of their similarity. The nests are placed on  the ground in marshes or sloughs, and are made of grasses, lined with  feathers. Eggs from six to fourteen in number, of a buffy white color.  Size 2.40 x 1.70.

CANVAS-BACK. _Marila valisineria._    Range.--Whole of North America, breeding chiefly in the interior from  the United States to the Arctic Ocean.    A noted table bird, especially in the south where it feeds on wild  celery. Can be distinguished from the Redhead by its darker head,  lighter back, and gradually sloping bill. They nest abundantly in  Manitoba, their habits being the same as the preceding. They lay from  six to ten eggs of a darker shade than the Red-heads. Size 2.40 x 1.70.  Data.--Haunted Lake, N. Alberta, June 12, 1897. Ten eggs. Nest of reeds  in a heavy reed bed out in the lake. Collector, Walter Raine.      148. SCAUP DUCK. _Marila marila._    Range.--North America, breeding from North Dakota northward, chiefly in  the interior; south in winter to Central America.    This and the following species are widely known as \"Blue-bills\" owing to  the slaty blue color of that member. Their plumage is black and white,  somewhat similar in pattern to that of the Redhead, but darker, and the  whole head is black. They nest in marshes about many of the ponds and  lakes in the interior of British America. The nest is made of marsh  grasses and lined with feathers. The six to ten eggs are pale grayish or  greenish gray. Size 2.50 x 1.70. Data.--Saltcoats Marshes, N. W. Canada,  June 15, 1901. Ten eggs. Nest in the grass; a depression lined with down  and dried grasses. Collector, Walter Raine.    [Illustration: CANVAS-BACK. American Scaup Duck.]  [Illustration 099: Pale greenish gray.]  [Illustration: deco.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 98    149. LESSER SCAUP DUCK. _Marila affinis._    Range.--North America, breeding from North Dakota and British Columbia  northward; winters south to Central America.    This Duck is distinguished from the preceding, chiefly by its size which  is about two inches less, or 17 inches in length. The nesting habits are  the same as those of the Greater Scaup and the eggs are similar but  smaller. Size 2.25 x 1.55. Data.--Northern Assiniboia, June 10, 1901.  Ten eggs on grass and down at the edge of a lagoon. Collector, Walter  Raine.      150. RING-NECKED DUCK. _Marila collaris._    Range.--North America, breeding in the interior, from North Dakota and  Washington northward. Winters from Maryland on the east and British  Columbia on the west to Central America.    Similar to the Lesser Scaup in size and plumage, except that it has a  narrow chestnut collar around the neck, the back is black instead of  barred with white, and the speculum is gray instead of white."]]]
