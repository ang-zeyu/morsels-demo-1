And fast. The Ambassadors' Ball is next Tuesday evening, you  know, and that's one function I can't stay away from, even with a Class  A Double Prime excuse.\"          CHAPTER 6      The Ambassadors' Ball, one of the most ultra-ultra functions of the  year, was well under way. It was not that everyone who was anyone was  there; but everyone who was there was, in one way or another, very  emphatically someone. Thus, there were affairs at which there were more  young and beautiful women, and more young and handsome men; but none  exhibiting newer or more expensive gowns, more ribbons and decorations,  more or costlier or more refined jewelry, or a larger acreage of  powdered and perfumed epidermis.    And even so, the younger set was well enough represented. Since  pioneering appeals more to youth than to age, the men representing the  colonies were young; and their wives, together with the daughters and  the second (or third or fourth, or occasionally the fifth) wives of the  human personages practically balanced the account.    Nor was the throng entirely human. The time had not yet come, of  course, when warm-blooded, oxygen-breathing monstrosities from hundreds  of other solar systems would vie in numbers with the humanity present.  There were, however, a few Martians on the floor, wearing their light  \"robes du convention\" and dancing with meticulously mathematical  precision. A few Venerians, who did not dance, sat in state or waddled  importantly about. Many worlds of the Solarian System, and not a few  other systems, were represented.    One couple stood out, even against that opulent and magnificent  background. Eyes followed them wherever they went.    The girl was tall, trim, supple; built like a symphony. Her Callistan  vexto-silk gown, of the newest and most violent shade of \"radio-active\"  green, was phosphorescently luminous; fluorescent; gleaming and  glowing. Its hem swept the floor, but above the waist it vanished  mysteriously except for wisps which clung to strategic areas here and  there with no support, apparently, except the personal magnetism of the  wearer. She, almost alone of all the women there, wore no flowers. Her  only jewelry was a rosette of huge, perfectly-matched emeralds, perched  precariously upon her bare left shoulder. Her hair, unlike the other  women's flawless coiffures, was a flamboyant, artistically-disarranged,  red-bronze-auburn mop. Her soft and dewy eyes--Virgilia Samms could  control her eyes as perfectly as she could her highly educated  hands--were at the moment gold-flecked, tawny wells of girlish  innocence and trust.    \"But I _can't_ give you this next dance, too, Herkimer--_Honestly_ I  can't!\" she pleaded, snuggling just a trifle closer into the embrace of  the young man who was just as much man, physically, as she was woman.  \"I'd just _love_ to, really, but I just simply _can't_, and you know  why, too.\"    \"You've got some duty-dances, of course ...\"    \"_Some?_ I've got a list as long as from here to there! Senator  Morgan first, of course, then Mr. Isaacson, then I sat one out with  Mr. Ossmen--I can't _stand_ Venerians, they're so slimy and fat and  repulsive!--and that leathery horned toad from Mars and that Jovian  hippopotamus ...\"    She went down the list, and as she named or characterized each entity  another finger of her left hand pressed down upon the back of her  partner's right, to emphasize the count of her social obligations. But  those talented fingers were doing more--far, far more--than that.    Herkimer Third, although no little of a Don Juan, was a highly  polished, smoothly finished, thoroughly seasoned diplomat. As such, his  eyes and his other features--particularly his eyes--had been schooled  for years to reveal no trace of whatever might be going on inside his  brain. If he had entertained any suspicion of the beautiful girl in  his arms, if anyone had suggested that she was trying her best to pump  him, he would have smiled the sort of smile which only the top-drawer  diplomat can achieve. He was not suspicious of Virgilia Samms. However,  simply because she was Virgil Samms' daughter, he took an extra bit of  pain to betray no undue interest in any one of the names she recited.  And besides, she was not looking at his eyes, nor even at his face. Her  glance, demurely downcast, was all too rarely raised above the level of  his chin.    There were some things, however, that Herkimer Herkimer Third did not  know. That Virgilia Samms was the most accomplished muscle-reader of  her times. That she was so close to him, not because of his manly  charm, but because only in that position could she do her prodigious  best. That she could work with her eyes alone, but in emergencies,  when fullest possible results were imperative, she had to use her  exquisitely sensitive fingers and her exquisitely tactile skin. That  she had studied intensively, and had tabulated the reactions of, each  of the entities on her list. That she was now, with his help, fitting  those reactions into a pattern. And finally, that that pattern was  beginning to assume the grim shape of MURDER!    And Virgilia Samms, working now for something far more urgent and  vastly more important than a figmental Galactic Patrol, hoped  desperately that this Herkimer was not a muscle-reader too; for she  knew that she was revealing her secrets even more completely than was  he. In fact, if things got much worse, he could not help but feel the  pounding of her heart ... but she could explain that easily enough, by  a few appropriate wiggles ... No, he wasn't a reader, definitely not.  He wasn't watching the right places; he was looking where that gown had  been designed to make him look, and nowhere else ... and no tell-tale  muscles lay beneath any part of either of his hands.    As her eyes and her fingers and her lovely torso sent more and more  information to her keen brain, Jill grew more and more anxious. She  was sure that murder was intended, but who was to be the victim? Her  father? Probably. Pops Kinnison? Possibly. Somebody else? Barely  possibly. And when? And where? And how? She _didn't know_! And she  would have to be _sure_ ... Mentioning names hadn't been enough, but a  personal appearance ... Why _didn't_ dad show up--or did she wish he  wouldn't come at all...?    Virgil Samms entered the ball-room.    \"And dad told me, Herkimer,\" she cooed sweetly, gazing up into his eyes  for the first time in over a minute, \"that I must dance with every one  of them. So you see ... Oh, there he is now, over there! I've been  wondering where he's been keeping himself.\" She nodded toward the  entrance and prattled on artlessly. \"He's almost _never_ late, you  know, and I've ...\"    He looked, and as his eyes met those of the First Lensman, Jill learned  three of the facts she needed so badly to know. Her father. Here. Soon.  She never knew how she managed to keep herself under control; but, some  way and just barely, she did.    Although nothing showed, she was seething inwardly: wrought up as  she had never before been. What could she do? She _knew_, but she did  not have a scrap or an iota of visible or tangible evidence; and if  she made one single slip, however slight, the consequences could be  immediate and disastrous.    After this dance might be too late. She could make an excuse to leave  the floor, but that would look very bad, later ... and none of them  would Lens her, she knew, while she was with Herkimer--_damn_ such  chivalry!... She _could_ take the chance of waving at her father, since  she hadn't seen him for so long ... no, the smallest risk would be with  Mase. He looked at her every chance he got, and she'd _make_ him use  his Lens ...    Northrop looked at her; and over Herkimer's shoulder, for one fleeting  instant, she allowed her face to reveal the terrified appeal she so  keenly felt.    \"Want me, Jill?\" His Lensed thought touched only the outer fringes of  her mind. Full rapport is more intimate than a kiss: no one except her  father had ever really put a Lens on Virgilia Samms. Nevertheless:    \"_Want_ you! I never wanted anybody so much in my life! Come in,  Mase--quick--_please_!\"    Diffidently enough, he came; but at the first inkling of the girl's  news all thought of diffidence or of privacy vanished.    \"Jack! Spud! Mr. Kinnison! Mr. Samms!\" he Lensed sharp, imperative,  almost frantic thoughts. \"Listen in!\"    \"Steady, Mase, I'll take over,\" came Roderick Kinnison's deeper,  quieter mental voice. \"First, the matter of guns. Anybody except me  wearing a pistol? You are, Spud?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"You would be. But you and Mase, Jack?\"    \"We've got our Lewistons!\"    \"You would have. Blasters, my sometimes-not-quite-so-bright son, are  fine weapons indeed for certain kinds of work. In emergencies, it is  of course permissible to kill a few dozen innocent bystanders. In such  a crowd as this, though, it is much better technique to kill only the  one you are aiming at. So skip out to my car, you two, right now, and  change--and make it _fast_.\" Everyone knew that Roderick Kinnison's car  was at all times an arsenal on wheels. \"Wish you were in uniform, too,  Virge, but it can't be helped now. Work your way--_slowly_--around to  the northwest corner. Spud, do the same.\"    \"It's impossible--starkly unthinkable!\" and \"I'm not _sure_ of  anything, really ...\" Samms and his daughter began simultaneously to  protest.    \"Virgil, you talk like a man with a paper nose. Keep still until after  you've used your brain. And I'm sure enough of what you know, Jill, to  take plenty of steps. You can relax now--take it easy.

When we come to think of it,  it is a matter of considerable surprise that the surface of the  earth has been able to continue producing animals and plants for  the many millions of years during which life has been in  existence. Plants and animals both require food, animals depending  wholly upon plants therefor. Plants, however, equally with  animals, require food, and although they obtain a considerable  portion of their food from the air, yet no inconsiderable part of  it is obtained from the soil. The question is forced upon us,  therefore, as to why the soil has not long since become exhausted  of food. How could the soil continue to support plants year after  year for millions of years, and yet remain as fertile as ever?    The explanation of this phenomenon is in the simple fact that the  processes of Nature are such that the same food is used over and  over again, first by the plant, then by the animal, and then again  by the plant, and there is no necessity for any end of the process  so long as the sun furnishes energy to keep the circulation  continuous. One phase of this transference of food from animal to  plant and from plant to animal is familiar to nearly every one. It  is a well-known fact that animals in their respiration consume  oxygen, but exhale it again in combination with carbon as carbonic  dioxide. On the other hand, plants in their life consume the  carbonic dioxide and exhale the oxygen again as free oxygen. Thus  each of these kingdoms makes use of the excreted product of the  other, and this process can go on indefinitely, the animals  furnishing our atmosphere with plenty of carbonic acid for plant  life, and the plants excreting into the atmosphere at the same  time an abundant sufficiency of oxygen for animal life. The oxygen  thus passes in an endless round from animal to plant and from  plant to animal.    A similar cycle is true of all the other foods of animal and plant  life, though in regard to the others the operation is more complex  and more members are required to complete the chain. The  transference of matter through a series of changes by which it is  brought from a condition in which it is proper food for plants  back again into a condition when it is once more a proper food for  plants, is one of the interesting discoveries of modern science,  and one in which, as we shall see, bacteria play a most important  part. This food cycle is illustrated roughly by the accompanying  diagram; but in order to understand it, an explanation of the  various steps in this cycle is necessary.    It will be noticed that at the bottom of the circle represented in  Fig. 25, at A, are given various ingredients which are found in  the soil and which form plant foods. Plant foods, as may be seen  there, are obtained partly from the air as carbonic dioxide and  water; but another portion comes from the soil. Among the soil  ingredients the most prominent are nitrates, which are the forms  of nitrogen compounds most easily made use of by plants as a  source of this important element. It should be stated also that  there are other compounds in the soil which furnish plants with  part of their food--compounds containing potassium, phosphorus,  and some other elements. For simplicity's sake, however, these  will be left out of consideration. Beginning at the bottom of the  cycle (Fig. 25 A), plant life seizes the gases from the air and  these foods from the soil, and by means of the energy furnished it  by the sun's rays builds these simple chemical compounds into more  complex ones. This gives us the second step, as shown in Fig. 25  B, the products of plant life. These products of plant life  consist of such materials as sugar, starches, fats, and proteids,  all of which have been manufactured by the plant from the  ingredients furnished it from the soil and air, and through the  agency of the sun's rays. These products of plant life now form  foods for the animal kingdom. Starches, fats, and proteids are  animal foods, and upon such complex bodies alone can the animal  kingdom be fed. Animal life, standing high up in the circle, is  not capable of extracting its nutriment from the soil, but must  take the more complex foods which have been manufactured by plant  life. These complex foods enter now into the animal and take their  place in the animal body. By the animal activities, some of the  foods are at once decomposed into carbonic acid and water, which,  being dissipated into the air, are brought back at once into the  condition in which they can serve again as plant food. This part  of the food is thus brought back again to the bottom of the circle  (Fig. 25, dotted lines). But while it is true that animals do thus  reduce some of their foods to the simple condition of carbonic  acid and water, this is not true of most of the foods which  contain nitrogen. The nitrogenous foods are as necessary for the  life as the carbon foods, and animals do not reduce their  nitrogenous foods to the condition in which plants can prey upon  them. While plants furnish them with nitrogenous food, they can  not give it back to the plants. Part of the nitrogenous foods  animals build into new albumins (Fig. 25 C); but a part of them  they reduce at once into a somewhat simpler condition known as  urea. Urea is the form in which the nitrogen is commonly excreted  from the animal body. But urea is not a plant food; for ordinary  plants are entirely unable to make use of it. Part of the nitrogen  eaten by the animal is stored up in its body, and thus the body of  the animal, after it has died, contains these nitrogen compounds  of high complexity. But plants are not able to use these  compounds. A plant can not be fed upon muscle tissue, nor upon  fats, nor bones, for these are compounds so complex that the  simple plant is unable to use them at all. So far, then, in the  food cycle the compounds taken from the soil have been built up  into compounds of greater and greater complexity; they have  reached the top of this circle, and no part of them, except part  of the carbon and oxygen, has become reduced again to plant food.  In order that this material should again become capable of  entering into the life of plants so as to go over the circle  again, it is necessary for it to be once more reduced from its  highly complex condition into a simpler one.    Now come into play these decomposition agencies which we have been  studying under the head of scavengers. It will be noticed that the  next step in the food cycle is taken by the decomposition  bacteria. These organisms, existing, as we have already seen, in  the air, in the soil, in the water, and always ready to seize hold  of any organic substance that may furnish them with food, feed  upon the products of animal life, whether they are such products  as muscle tissue, or fat, or sugar, or whether they are the  excreted products of animal life, such as urea, and produce  therein the chemical decomposition changes already noticed. As a  result of this chemical decomposition, the complex bodies are  broken into simpler and simpler compounds, and the final result is  a very thorough destruction of the animal body or the material  excreted by animal life, and its reduction into forms simple  enough for plants to use again as foods. Thus the bacteria come in  as a necessary link to connect the animal body, or the excretion  from the animal body, with the soil again, and therefore with that  part of the circle in which the material can once more serve as  plant food.    But in the decomposition that thus occurs through the agency of  the putrefactive bacteria it very commonly happens that some of  the food material is broken down into compounds too simple for use  as plant food. As will be seen by a glance at the diagram (Fig. 25  D), a portion of the cleavage products resulting from the  destruction of these animal foods takes the form of carbonic-acid  gas and water. These ingredients are at once in condition for  plant life, as shown by the dotted lines. They pass off into the  air, and the green leaves of vegetation everywhere again seize  them, assimilate them, and use them as food. Thus it is that the  carbon and the oxygen have completed the cycle, and have come back  again to the position in the circle where they started. In regard  to the nitrogen portion of the food, however, it very commonly  happens that the products which arise as the result of the  decomposition processes are not yet in proper condition for plant  food. They are reduced into a condition actually too simple for  the use of plants. As a result of these putrefactive changes, the  nitrogen products of animal life are broken frequently into  compounds as simple as ammonia (NH3), or into compounds which the  chemists speak of as nitrites (Fig. 25 at D). Now these compounds  are not ordinarily within the reach of plant life. The luxuriant  vegetation of the globe extracts its nitrogen from the soil in a  form more complex than either of the compounds here mentioned;  for, as we have seen, it is nitrates chiefly that furnish plants  with their nitrogen food factor. But nitrates contain considerable  oxygen. Ammonia, which is one of the products of putrefactive de-  composition, contains no oxygen, and nitrites, another factor,  contains less oxygen than nitrates. These bodies are thus too  simple for plants to make use of as a source of nitrogen. The  chemical destruction of the food material which results from the  action of the putrefactive bacteria is too thorough, and the  nitrogen foods are not yet in condition to be used by plants.    Now comes in the agency of still another class of micro-organisms,  the existence of which has been demonstrated to us during the last  few years. In the soil everywhere, especially in fertile soil, is  a class of bacteria which has received the name of nitrifying  bacteria (Fig. 26). These organisms grow in the soil and feed upon  the "]]]
