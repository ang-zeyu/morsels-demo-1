Helen  had been a school-teacher and used to boys, and she sensed a boyish  simplicity or vigor or freshness in this hunter. She believed, however,  that it was a mental and spiritual force in Dale which had drawn her to  think of it.    \"Nell, I've spoken to you three times,\" protested Bo, petulantly. \"What  're you mooning over?\"    \"I'm pretty tired--and far away, Bo,\" replied Helen. \"What did you say?\"    \"I said I had an e-normous appetite.\"    \"Really. That's not remarkable for you. I'm too tired to eat. And afraid  to shut my eyes. They'd never come open. When did we sleep last, Bo?\"    \"Second night before we left home,\" declared Bo.    \"Four nights! Oh, we've slept some.\"    \"I'll bet I make mine up in this woods. Do you suppose we'll sleep right  here--under this tree--with no covering?\"    \"It looks so,\" replied Helen, dubiously.    \"How perfectly lovely!\" exclaimed Bo, in delight. \"We'll see the stars  through the pines.\"    \"Seems to be clouding over. Wouldn't it be awful if we had a storm?\"    \"Why, I don't know,\" answered Bo, thoughtfully. \"It must storm out  West.\"    Again Helen felt a quality of inevitableness in Bo. It was something  that had appeared only practical in the humdrum home life in St. Joseph.  All of a sudden Helen received a flash of wondering thought--a thrilling  consciousness that she and Bo had begun to develop in a new and wild  environment. How strange, and fearful, perhaps, to watch that growth!  Bo, being younger, more impressionable, with elemental rather than  intellectual instincts, would grow stronger more swiftly. Helen wondered  if she could yield to her own leaning to the primitive. But how could  anyone with a thoughtful and grasping mind yield that way? It was the  savage who did not think.    Helen saw Dale stand erect once more and gaze into the forest.    \"Reckon Roy ain't comin',\" he soliloquized. \"An' that's good.\" Then he  turned to the girls. \"Supper's ready.\"    The girls responded with a spirit greater than their activity. And  they ate like famished children that had been lost in the woods. Dale  attended them with a pleasant light upon his still face.    \"To-morrow night we'll have meat,\" he said.    \"What kind?\" asked Bo.    \"Wild turkey or deer. Maybe both, if you like. But it's well to take  wild meat slow. An' turkey--that 'll melt in your mouth.\"    \"Uummm!\" murmured Bo, greedily. \"I've heard of wild turkey.\"    When they had finished Dale ate his meal, listening to the talk of the  girls, and occasionally replying briefly to some query of Bo's. It was  twilight when he began to wash the pots and pans, and almost dark by the  time his duties appeared ended. Then he replenished the campfire and  sat down on a log to gaze into the fire. The girls leaned comfortably  propped against the saddles.    \"Nell, I'll keel over in a minute,\" said Bo. \"And I oughtn't--right on  such a big supper.\"    \"I don't see how I can sleep, and I know I can't stay awake,\" rejoined  Helen.    Dale lifted his head alertly.    \"Listen.\"    The girls grew tense and still. Helen could not hear a sound, unless it  was a low thud of hoof out in the gloom. The forest seemed sleeping. She  knew from Bo's eyes, wide and shining in the camp-fire light, that she,  too, had failed to catch whatever it was Dale meant.    \"Bunch of coyotes comin',\" he explained.    Suddenly the quietness split to a chorus of snappy, high-strung, strange  barks. They sounded wild, yet they held something of a friendly or  inquisitive note. Presently gray forms could be descried just at the  edge of the circle of light. Soft rustlings of stealthy feet surrounded  the camp, and then barks and yelps broke out all around. It was a  restless and sneaking pack of animals, thought Helen; she was glad after  the chorus ended and with a few desultory, spiteful yelps the coyotes  went away.    Silence again settled down. If it had not been for the anxiety always  present in Helen's mind she would have thought this silence sweet and  unfamiliarly beautiful.    \"Ah! Listen to that fellow,\" spoke up Dale. His voice was thrilling.    Again the girls strained their ears. That was not necessary, for  presently, clear and cold out of the silence, pealed a mournful howl,  long drawn, strange and full and wild.    \"Oh! What's that?\" whispered Bo.    \"That's a big gray wolf--a timber-wolf, or lofer, as he's sometimes  called,\" replied Dale. \"He's high on some rocky ridge back there. He  scents us, an' he doesn't like it.... There he goes again. Listen! Ah,  he's hungry.\"    While Helen listened to this exceedingly wild cry--so wild that it made  her flesh creep and the most indescribable sensations of loneliness come  over her--she kept her glance upon Dale.    \"You love him?\" she murmured involuntarily, quite without understanding  the motive of her query.    Assuredly Dale had never had that question asked of him before, and  it seemed to Helen, as he pondered, that he had never even asked it of  himself.    \"I reckon so,\" he replied, presently.    \"But wolves kill deer, and little fawns, and everything helpless in the  forest,\" expostulated Bo.    The hunter nodded his head.    \"Why, then, can you love him?\" repeated Helen.    \"Come to think of it, I reckon it's because of lots of reasons,\"  returned Dale. \"He kills clean. He eats no carrion. He's no coward. He  fights. He dies game.... An' he likes to be alone.\"    \"Kills clean. What do you mean by that?\"    \"A cougar, now, he mangles a deer. An' a silvertip, when killin' a  cow or colt, he makes a mess of it. But a wolf kills clean, with sharp  snaps.\"    \"What are a cougar and a silvertip?\"    \"Cougar means mountain-lion or panther, an' a silvertip is a grizzly  bear.\"    \"Oh, they're all cruel!\" exclaimed Helen, shrinking.    \"I reckon. Often I've shot wolves for relayin' a deer.\"    \"What's that?\"    \"Sometimes two or more wolves will run a deer, an' while one of them  rests the other will drive the deer around to his pardner, who'll, take  up the chase. That way they run the deer down. Cruel it is, but nature,  an' no worse than snow an' ice that starve deer, or a fox that kills  turkey-chicks breakin' out of the egg, or ravens that pick the eyes out  of new-born lambs an' wait till they die. An' for that matter, men are  crueler than beasts of prey, for men add to nature, an' have more than  instincts.\"    Helen was silenced, as well as shocked. She had not only learned a new  and striking viewpoint in natural history, but a clear intimation to the  reason why she had vaguely imagined or divined a remarkable character in  this man. A hunter was one who killed animals for their fur, for their  meat or horns, or for some lust for blood--that was Helen's definition  of a hunter, and she believed it was held by the majority of people  living in settled states. But the majority might be wrong. A hunter  might be vastly different, and vastly more than a tracker and slayer  of game. The mountain world of forest was a mystery to almost all men.  Perhaps Dale knew its secrets, its life, its terror, its beauty, its  sadness, and its joy; and if so, how full, how wonderful must be his  mind! He spoke of men as no better than wolves. Could a lonely life  in the wilderness teach a man that? Bitterness, envy, jealousy, spite,  greed, and hate--these had no place in this hunter's heart. It was not  Helen's shrewdness, but a woman's intuition, which divined that.    Dale rose to his feet and, turning his ear to the north, listened once  more.    \"Are you expecting Roy still?\" inquired Helen.    \"No, it ain't likely he'll turn up to-night,\" replied Dale, and then he  strode over to put a hand on the pine-tree that soared above where the  girls lay. His action, and the way he looked up at the tree-top and then  at adjacent trees, held more of that significance which so interested  Helen.    \"I reckon he's stood there some five hundred years an' will stand  through to-night,\" muttered Dale.    This pine was the monarch of that wide-spread group.    \"Listen again,\" said Dale.    Bo was asleep. And Helen, listening, at once caught low, distant roar.    \"Wind. It's goin' to storm,\" explained Dale. \"You'll hear somethin'  worth while. But don't be scared. Reckon we'll be safe. Pines blow down  often. But this fellow will stand any fall wind that ever was.... Better  slip under the blankets so I can pull the tarp up.\"    Helen slid down, just as she was, fully dressed except for boots, which  she and Bo had removed; and she laid her head close to Bo's. Dale pulled  the tarpaulin up and folded it back just below their heads.    \"When it rains you'll wake, an' then just pull the tarp up over you,\" he  said.    \"Will it rain?\" Helen asked. But she was thinking that this moment  was the strangest that had ever happened to her. By the light of the  camp-fire she saw Dale's face, just as usual, still, darkly serene,  expressing no thought. He was kind, but he was not thinking of these  sisters as girls, alone with him in a pitch-black forest, helpless and  defenseless. He did not seem to be thinking at all. But Helen had never  before in her life been so keenly susceptible to experience.    \"I'll be close by an' keep the fire goin' all night,\" he said.    She heard him stride off into the darkness. Presently there came a  dragging, bumping sound, then a crash of a log dropped upon the fire.  A cloud of sparks shot up, and many pattered down to hiss upon the damp  ground. Smoke again curled upward along the great, seamed tree-trunk,  and flames sputtered and crackled.    Helen listened again for the roar of wind. It seemed to come on a breath  of air that fanned her cheek and softly blew Bo's curls, and it was  stronger. But it died out presently, only to come again, and still  stronger. Helen realized then that the sound was that of an approaching  storm. Her heavy eyelids almost"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34571"],[0,"The Pearl Story Book: Stories and Legends of Winter, Christmas, and New Year's (#15)"],[1,"en, when the lion had called the meeting to order, the swifts and  the swallows told what they had seen, and a fat little pug-dog, with a  ribbon and a silver bell about his neck, wheezed out a story of a  Christmas tree that he had seen, and how a silver bell had grown on  that tree for him and a whole box of the best sweets he had ever  dreamed of while he lay comfortably snoozing on his cushion before the  fire. And a Persian cat, with her hair turned the wrong way, mewed out  her story of a Christmas tree that she had attended, and told how  there was a white mouse made of cream cheese for her creeping about  beneath the branches.    Then the monkeys chattered and the elephants trumpeted, the horses  neighed, the hyenas laughed, and each in his own way argued for a  Christmas tree and told what he would do to help make it.    The elephant would go into the forest, and choose the tree and pull it  up. The buffaloes would drag it in. The giraffe would fix the  ornaments on the higher limbs, because its neck was long. The monkeys  would scramble up where the giraffe could not reach. The squirrels  could run out on the slender twigs and help the monkeys. The birds  would fly about and get the golden threads and put them on the tree  with their beaks. The fire-flies would hide themselves among the  branches and sparkle like diamonds, and the glow-worms promised to  help the fire-flies by playing candles, if someone would lift them up  and put them on the branches. The parrots and paroquets and other  birds of gay plumage would give feathers to hang among the branches,  and the humming-birds promised to flutter in and out among the twigs,  and the sheep to give white wool to lie like snow among the boughs.    Then the parrots screeched and the peacocks screamed with delight, and  you and I never could have told whether anybody voted aye or nay; but  the lion knew; and the owl, for he was clerk, set it down in the  minutes, as the lion bade him, that all the birds and beasts would do  their part. So each planned what he could do. Even the little beetle,  who makes great balls of earth, thought that if he could only once see  one of those gay balls that grow on the children's Christmas tree, he  might make some for the animals' tree. Different birds and beasts told  of the oranges and apples and holly-berries and who knows what they  could get and hang upon the tree. You see the animals came from many  places, and then, too, they could send the carrier pigeons to go and  bring fruit and berries, and who knows what besides, from oh, so far  away, because the carrier pigeons can fly through the air no one knows  how fast or how far.    Well, I cannot tell you everything that each one was going to do, but  if you will go and get your Noah's ark and take the animals out one by  one, then you surely will think it out for yourself, for you have all  the animals there.    And so they arranged how they would ornament the tree, and the next  thing was to decide what presents should be hung on the tree or put  beneath its boughs, for each one must have his present. Well, after  much discussion in roars, and bellows, crows and croaks, lows and  screams and bleats, and baas and grunts, and all the other sounds of  birds and beast language, it was voted that each might choose the  present he wished hung on the tree. The clerkly owl should call their  names one by one, and each might declare his choice. So they began.  The parrots and the macaws thought that they would like oranges and  bananas and such things, which would look so pretty on the tree, too;  and so they were arranged for. The robins and the cedar birds chose  cherries; the the partridges, partridge berries, the squirrels, the  red and grey and black, nuts and apples and pears. The monkeys said  the popcorn strings would do for them, and the cats and dogs,  remembering the Christmas gift which the pug-dog and Persian cat had  told about, asked for tiny mice made of cream cheese or chocolate. By  and by it came the pig's turn to tell his choice. \"Grunt, grunt!\" said  the pig, \"I want a nice pail of swill hung on the very lowest bough of  all.\"    \"Ugh!\" said the black leopard, so sleek and so clean.    \"Faugh!\" said the gazelle, with his dainty sense of smell.    \"Neigh!\" said the horse, so daintily groomed.    \"What!\" roared the lion, \"what's that you want?\"    \"A pail of swill,\" grunted the pig. \"Each one has chosen what he  wants, and I have a right to choose what I want.\"    \"But,\" roared the lion, \"each one has chosen something beautiful to  make the tree a joy to all.\"    \"Grunt, grunt,\" said the pig. \"The parrots and macaws are going to  have oranges and bananas, and the robins and the cedar birds red  cherries, the partridges, their berries, the squirrels, nuts and  apples and pears, the dog and the cat, their cream and chocolate mice.  They all have what they want to eat. Grunt, grunt,\" said he; \"I will  have what I want to eat, too, and what I want is a pail of swill.\"    Now, you see it had been voted, as I told you, that each should have  what he wanted hung on the tree for him, and so the lion could not  help himself. If the pig chose swill, swill he must have, and angrily  he had to roar: \"If the pig wants swill, a pail of swill he must have,  hung on the lowest bough of the tree!\"    Then the wolf's wicked eyes gleamed, for his turn was next, and he  said: \"If the pig has swill because he wants swill to eat, I must have  what I want to eat, and I want a tender lamb, six months old.\" And at  that all the lambs and the sheep bleated and baaed.    \"Ha, ha!\" barked the fox; \"then I want a turkey!\" And the turkeys  gobbled in fear.    \"And I,\" said the tiger, \"want a yearling calf.\" And the cows and the  calves lowed in horror.    \"And I,\" said the owl, the clerk, \"I want a plump dove.\"    \"And I,\" said the hawk, \"will take a rabbit.\"    \"And I,\" said the leopard, \"want a deer or a gazelle.\"    Then all was fear and uproar. The hares and rabbits scuttled into the  grass; the gazelles and the deer bounded away; the sheep and the  cattle crowded close together; the small birds rose in the air in  flocks; and the Christmas tree was like to have come to grief and  ended, not in Christmas joy, but in fear and hatred and terror.    Then a little lamb stepped out and bleated: \"Ah! king lion, it would  be very sad if all the animals should lose their Christmas tree, for  the very thought of that tree has brought us closer together, and here  we were, wild and tame, fierce and timid, met together as friends; and  oh! king lion, rather than there should not be a tree, they may take  me and hang me on it. Let them not take the turkeys and gazelles and  the calves and the rabbits and all the rest that they have chosen. Let  the tigers and leopards, and wolves and foxes and eagles, and hawks  and owls and all their kind be content that their Christmas present  shall be a lamb; and so we may come together again and have our happy  Christmas tree, and each have what he wishes.\"    \"But,\" said the lion, \"what will you have? If you give yourself, then  you will have no Christmas present.\"    \"Yes,\" said the lamb, \"I, too, shall have what I want, for I shall  have brought them all together again, and made each one happy.\"    Then a dove fluttered down from a tree and landed on the ground beside  the lamb, and very timidly and softly she cooed: \"Take me, too, king  lion, as the present for the owls and the hawks, and the weasels and  minks, because for them a lamb is too big. I am the best present for  them. Take me, king lion!\"    Then the lion roared: \"See what the lamb and the dove have done! My  food, oh, tigers and leopards and wolves and eagles and all your kind,  is like your food; but I would rather eat nothing from our Christmas  tree than take this lamb or dove for my present.\"    Then all the beasts kept still, because the lion roared so loud and  angrily, and the birds that were flying away settled on the branches  of the trees, and the gazelles stopped their running and turned their  heads to listen, and the rabbits peeped out through the grass and  brush where they had hid. Then the lion turned to the pig, and roared:    \"See this lamb and this dove! Are you not ashamed for what you have  done? You have spoiled all our happiness. Will you take back your  choice, you pig, or do you wish to ruin our Christmas tree?\"    \"Grunt, grunt,\" said the pig, \"it is my right. I want something good.  I don't care for your lambs and your doves. I want my swill!\"    Then the lion roared again: \"Have all chosen?\" and all answered,  \"Yes.\"    \"Then,\" said the lion, \"it is my choice.\"    And all said: \"It is.\"    \"I love fat and tender pigs. I choose a pig for my Christmas gift,\"  roared the lion.    Did you ever hear a pig squeal? Oh, how that pig squealed then! And he  got up on his fat little legs and tried to run away, but all the  animals gathered around in a ring and the hyenas laughed, and the  jackals cried, and the dogs and the wolves and the foxes headed him  off and hunted the poor pig back again. Then, when the pig found that  he could not run away, he lay down on his back with his feet in the  air and squealed with all his might: \"Oh, I don't want the swill; oh,  I don't want the swill! I take it all back! I don't want anything!\"    But at first no one heard him, because all were talking at once in  their own way--barking and growling and roaring and chattering; but by  and by the lion saw that the pig was squealing something, so he roared  for silence, and then they all heard the pig squeal out that he did  not want any swill. And the lion roared aloud: \"You have heard. Has  the owl recorded that the pig will have no swill?\"    \"Yes,\" said the owl.    \"Then,\" said the lion, \"record that the lion wants no pig.\"    Then the tiger growled: \"And I want no calf,\" and one by one the  leopard and the eagle, the wolf and the fox, the hawk and owl, and  all their kind,"]]]
