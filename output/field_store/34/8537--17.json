This landscape with the  surrounding alps did, indeed, present a perfect picture of the lovely  and the sublime, of 'beauty sleeping in the lap of horror.'    The travellers, having reached the plains, proceeded, between hedges  of flowering myrtle and pomegranate, to the town of Arles, where  they proposed to rest for the night. They met with simple, but neat  accommodation, and would have passed a happy evening, after the toils  and the delights of this day, had not the approaching separation thrown  a gloom over their spirit. It was St. Aubert's plan to proceed, on the  morrow, to the borders of the Mediterranean, and travel along its shores  into Languedoc; and Valancourt, since he was now nearly recovered, and  had no longer a pretence for continuing with his new friends, resolved  to leave them here. St. Aubert, who was much pleased with him, invited  him to go further, but did not repeat the invitation, and Valancourt  had resolution enough to forego the temptation of accepting it, that  he might prove himself not unworthy of the favour. On the following  morning, therefore, they were to part, St. Aubert to pursue his way to  Languedoc, and Valancourt to explore new scenes among the mountains, on  his return home. During this evening he was often silent and thoughtful;  St. Aubert's manner towards him was affectionate, though grave, and  Emily was serious, though she made frequent efforts to appear cheerful.  After one of the most melancholy evenings they had yet passed together,  they separated for the night.        CHAPTER VI       I care not, Fortune! what you me deny;   You cannot rob me of free nature's grace;   You cannot shut the windows of the sky,   Through which Aurora shews her brightening face;   You cannot bar my constant feet to trace   The woods and lawns, by living stream, at eve:   Let health my nerves and finer fibres brace,   And I their toys to the great children leave:   Of fancy, reason, virtue, nought can me bereave.       THOMSON    In the morning, Valancourt breakfasted with St. Aubert and Emily,  neither of whom seemed much refreshed by sleep. The languor of illness  still hung over St. Aubert, and to Emily's fears his disorder appeared  to be increasing fast upon him. She watched his looks with anxious  affection, and their expression was always faithfully reflected in her  own.    At the commencement of their acquaintance, Valancourt had made known his  name and family. St. Aubert was not a stranger to either, for the  family estates, which were now in the possession of an elder brother of  Valancourt, were little more than twenty miles distant from La  Vallee, and he had sometimes met the elder Valancourt on visits in the  neighbourhood. This knowledge had made him more willingly receive his  present companion; for, though his countenance and manners would have  won him the acquaintance of St. Aubert, who was very apt to trust to the  intelligence of his own eyes, with respect to countenances, he would  not have accepted these, as sufficient introductions to that of his  daughter.    The breakfast was almost as silent as the supper of the preceding night;  but their musing was at length interrupted by the sound of the carriage  wheels, which were to bear away St. Aubert and Emily. Valancourt started  from his chair, and went to the window; it was indeed the carriage, and  he returned to his seat without speaking. The moment was now come when  they must part. St. Aubert told Valancourt, that he hoped he would  never pass La Vallee without favouring him with a visit; and Valancourt,  eagerly thanking him, assured him that he never would; as he said which  he looked timidly at Emily, who tried to smile away the seriousness of  her spirits. They passed a few minutes in interesting conversation,  and St. Aubert then led the way to the carriage, Emily and Valancourt  following in silence. The latter lingered at the door several minutes  after they were seated, and none of the party seemed to have courage  enough to say--Farewell. At length, St. Aubert pronounced the melancholy  word, which Emily passed to Valancourt, who returned it, with a dejected  smile, and the carriage drove on.    The travellers remained, for some time, in a state of tranquil  pensiveness, which is not unpleasing. St. Aubert interrupted it by  observing, 'This is a very promising young man; it is many years since I  have been so much pleased with any person, on so short an acquaintance.  He brings back to my memory the days of my youth, when every scene was  new and delightful!' St. Aubert sighed, and sunk again into a reverie;  and, as Emily looked back upon the road they had passed, Valancourt was  seen, at the door of the little inn, following them with his eyes. Her  perceived her, and waved his hand; and she returned the adieu, till the  winding road shut her from his sight.    'I remember when I was about his age,' resumed St. Aubert, 'and I  thought, and felt exactly as he does. The world was opening upon me  then, now--it is closing.'    'My dear sir, do not think so gloomily,' said Emily in a trembling  voice, 'I hope you have many, many years to live--for your own sake--for  MY sake.'    'Ah, my Emily!' replied St. Aubert, 'for thy sake! Well--I hope it is  so.' He wiped away a tear, that was stealing down his cheek, threw a  smile upon his countenance, and said in a cheering voice, 'there  is something in the ardour and ingenuousness of youth, which is  particularly pleasing to the contemplation of an old man, if his  feelings have not been entirely corroded by the world. It is cheering  and reviving, like the view of spring to a sick person; his mind catches  somewhat of the spirit of the season, and his eyes are lighted up with a  transient sunshine. Valancourt is this spring to me.'    Emily, who pressed her father's hand affectionately, had never before  listened with so much pleasure to the praises he bestowed; no, not even  when he had bestowed them on herself.    They travelled on, among vineyards, woods, and pastures, delighted with  the romantic beauty of the landscape, which was bounded, on one side, by  the grandeur of the Pyrenees, and, on the other, by the ocean; and,  soon after noon, they reached the town of Colioure, situated on the  Mediterranean. Here they dined, and rested till towards the cool of  day, when they pursued their way along the shores--those enchanting  shores!--which extend to Languedoc. Emily gazed with enthusiasm on the  vastness of the sea, its surface varying, as the lights and shadows  fell, and on its woody banks, mellowed with autumnal tints.    St. Aubert was impatient to reach Perpignan, where he expected letters  from M. Quesnel; and it was the expectation of these letters, that  had induced him to leave Colioure, for his feeble frame had required  immediate rest. After travelling a few miles, he fell asleep; and Emily,  who had put two or three books into the carriage, on leaving La Vallee,  had now the leisure for looking into them. She sought for one, in which  Valancourt had been reading the day before, and hoped for the pleasure  of re-tracing a page, over which the eyes of a beloved friend had  lately passed, of dwelling on the passages, which he had admired, and of  permitting them to speak to her in the language of his own mind, and to  bring himself to her presence. On searching for the book, she could find  it no where, but in its stead perceived a volume of Petrarch's poems,  that had belonged to Valancourt, whose name was written in it, and from  which he had frequently read passages to her, with all the pathetic  expression, that characterized the feelings of the author. She hesitated  in believing, what would have been sufficiently apparent to almost any  other person, that he had purposely left this book, instead of the  one she had lost, and that love had prompted the exchange; but, having  opened it with impatient pleasure, and observed the lines of his pencil  drawn along the various passages he had read aloud, and under others  more descriptive of delicate tenderness than he had dared to trust  his voice with, the conviction came, at length, to her mind. For some  moments she was conscious only of being beloved; then, a recollection  of all the variations of tone and countenance, with which he had recited  these sonnets, and of the soul, which spoke in their expression, pressed  to her memory, and she wept over the memorial of his affection.    They arrived at Perpignan soon after sunset, where St. Aubert found,  as he had expected, letters from M. Quesnel, the contents of which  so evidently and grievously affected him, that Emily was alarmed,  and pressed him, as far as her delicacy would permit, to disclose  the occasion of his concern; but he answered her only by tears, and  immediately began to talk on other topics. Emily, though she forbore  to press the one most interesting to her, was greatly affected by her  father's manner, and passed a night of sleepless solicitude.    In the morning they pursued their journey along the coast towards  Leucate, another town on the Mediterranean, situated on the borders of  Languedoc and Rousillon. On the way, Emily renewed the subject of the  preceding night, and appeared so deeply affected by St. Aubert's silence  and dejection, that he relaxed from his reserve. 'I was unwilling, my  dear Emily,' said he, 'to throw a cloud over the pleasure you receive  from these scenes, and meant, therefore, to conceal, for the present,  some circumstances, with which, however, you must at length have been  made acquainted. But your anxiety has defeated my purpose; you suffer as  much from this, perhaps, as you will do from a knowledge of the facts I  have to relate. M. Quesnel's visit proved an unhappy one to me; he came  to tell me part of the news he has now confirmed. You may have "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32706"],[0,"Triplanetary (#15)"],[1,"out what was the matter with the M2 mine I'd  talk to you again. Here I am. Brittle firing pins. Three and two-tenths  percent defective. So I'm....\"    \"Very irregular, Doctor. The matter will have to go through  channels....\"    \"Not this one. The formal report is going through channels, but as I  started to tell you, this is an emergency report to you as Chief of  Safety. Since the defect is not covered by specs, neither Process nor  Ordnance can reject except by test, and whoever does the testing will  very probably be killed. Therefore, as every employee of Stoner and  Black is not only authorized but positively instructed to do upon  discovering an unsafe condition, I am reporting it direct to Safety.  Since my whiskers are a trifle longer than an operator's, I am reporting  it direct to the Head of the Safety Division; and I am telling you that  if you don't do something about it damned quick--stop production and  slap a HOLD order on all the M2AP's you can reach--I'll call District  and make you personally responsible for every premature that occurs from  now on.\"    Since any safety man, anywhere, would much rather stop a process than  authorize one, and since this particular safety man loved to throw his  weight around, Kinnison was surprised that Moulton did not act  instantly. The fact that he did not so act should have, but did not,  give the naive Kinnison much information as to conditions existing  Outside the Fence.    \"But they need those mines very badly; they are an item of very heavy  production. If we stop them ... how long? Have you any suggestions?\"    \"Yes. Call District and have them rush through a change of spec--include  heat-treat and a modified Charpy test. In the meantime, we can get back  into full production tomorrow if you have District slap a  hundred-per-cent inspection onto those pins.\"    \"Excellent! We can do that--very fine work, Doctor! Miss Morgan, get  District at once!\"    This, too, should have warned Kinnison, but it did not. He went back to  the Laboratory.    Tempus fugited.    Orders came to get ready to load M67 H.E., A.T. (105 m/m High Explosive,  Armor Tearing) shell on the Nine, and the Siberians went joyously to  work upon the new load. The explosive was to be a mixture of TNT and a  polysyllabic compound, everything about which was highly confidential  and restricted.    \"But what the hell's so hush-hush about _that_ stuff?\" demanded Blondie,  who, with five or six others, was crowding around the Czar's desk.  Unlike the days of Cappy Sumner, the private office of the Chief Chemist  was now as much Siberia as Siberia itself. \"The Germans developed it  originally, didn't they?\"    \"Yes, and the Italians used it against the Ethiopians--which was why  their bombs were so effective. But it says 'hush-hush,' so that's the  way it will be. And if you talk in your sleep, Blondie, tell Betty not  to listen.\"    The Siberians worked. The M67 was put into production. It was such a  success that orders for it came in faster than they could be filled.  Production was speeded up. Small cavitations began to appear. Nothing  serious, since they passed Inspection. Nevertheless, Kinnison protested,  in a formal report, receipt of which was formally acknowledged.    General Somebody-or-other, Entwhistle's Commanding Officer, whom none of  the Siberians had ever met, was transferred to more active duty, and a  colonel--Snodgrass or some such name--took his place. Ordnance got a new  Chief Inspector.    An M67, Entwhistle loaded, prematured in a gun-barrel, killing twenty  seven men. Kinnison protested again, verbally this time, at a staff  meeting. He was assured--verbally--that a formal and thorough  investigation was being made. Later he was informed--verbally and  without witnesses--that the investigation had been completed and that  the loading was not at fault. A new Commanding Officer--Lieutenant-Colonel  Franklin--appeared.    The Siberians, too busy to do more than glance at newspapers, paid very  little attention to a glider-crash in which several notables were  killed. They heard that an investigation was being made, but even the  Czar did not know until later that Washington had for once acted fast  in correcting a bad situation; that Inspection, which had been under  Production, was summarily divorced therefrom. And gossip spread abroad  that Stillman, then Head of the Inspection Division, was not a big  enough man for the job. Thus it was an entirely unsuspecting Kinnison  who was called into the innermost private office of Thomas Keller, the  Superintendent of Production.    \"Kinnison, how in hell do you handle those Siberians? I never saw  anything like them before in my life.\"    \"No, and you never will again. Nothing on Earth except a war could get  them together or hold them together. I don't 'handle' them--they can't  be 'handled'. I give them a job to do and let them do it. I back them  up. That's all.\"    \"Umngpf.\" Keller grunted. \"That's a hell of a formula--if I want  anything done right I've got to do it myself. But whatever your system  is, it works. But what I wanted to talk to you about is, how'd you like  to be Head of the Inspection Division, which would be enlarged to  include your present Chemical Section?\"    \"Huh?\" Kinnison demanded, dumbfounded.    \"At a salary well up on the confidential scale.\" Keller wrote a figure  upon a piece of paper, showed it to his visitor, then burned it in an  ash-tray.    Kinnison whistled. \"I'd like it--for more reasons than that. But I  didn't know that you--or have you already checked with the General and  Mr. Black?\"    \"Naturally,\" came the smooth reply. \"In fact, I suggested it to them and  have their approval. Perhaps you are curious to know why?\"    \"I certainly am.\"    \"For two reasons. First, because you have developed a crew of technical  experts that is the envy of every technical man in the country. Second,  you and your Siberians have done every job I ever asked you to, and done  it fast. As a Division Head, you will no longer be under me, but I am  right, I think, in assuming that you will work with me just as  efficiently as you do now?\"    \"I can't think of any reason why I wouldn't.\" This reply was made in all  honesty; but later, when he came to understand what Keller had meant,  how bitterly Kinnison was to regret its making!    He moved into Stillman's office, and found there what he thought was  ample reason for his predecessor's failure to make good. To his way of  thinking it was tremendously over-staffed, particularly with Assistant  Chief Inspectors. Delegation of authority, so widely preached  throughout Entwhistle Ordnance Plant, had not been given even lip  service here. Stillman had not made a habit of visiting the lines; nor  did the Chief Line Inspectors, the boys who really knew what was going  on, ever visit him. They reported to the Assistants, who reported to  Stillman, who handed down his Jovian pronouncements.    Kinnison set out, deliberately this time, to mold his key Chief Line  Inspectors into just such a group as the Siberians already were. He  released the Assistants to more productive work; retaining of Stillman's  office staff only a few clerks and his private secretary, one Celeste de  St. Aubin, a dynamic, vivacious--at times explosive--brunette. He gave  the boys on the Lines full authority; the few who could not handle the  load he replaced with men who could. At first the Chief Line Inspectors  simply could not believe; but after the affair of the forty millimeter,  in which Kinnison rammed the decision of his subordinate past Keller,  past the General, past Stoner and Black, and clear up to the Commanding  Officer before he made it stick, they were his to a man.    Others of his Section Heads, however, remained aloof. Pettler, whose  Technical Section was now part of Inspection, and Wilson, of Gages, were  two of those who talked largely and glowingly, but acted obstructively  if they acted at all. As weeks went on, Kinnison became wiser and wiser,  but made no sign. One day, during a lull, his secretary hung out the \"In  Conference\" sign and went into Kinnison's private office.    \"There isn't a reference to any such Investigation anywhere in Central  Files.\" She paused, as if to add something, then turned to leave.    \"As you were, Celeste. Sit down. I expected that. Suppressed--if made at  all. You're a smart girl, Celeste, and you know the ropes. You know that  you can talk to me, don't you?\"    \"Yes, but this is ... well, the word is going around that they are going  to break you, just as they have broken every other good man on the  Reservation.\"    \"I expected that, too.\" The words were quiet enough, but the man's jaw  tightened. \"Also, I know how they are going to do it.\"    \"How?\"    \"This speed-up on the Nine. They know that I won't stand still for the  kind of casts that Keller's new procedure, which goes into effect  tonight, is going to produce ... and this new C.O. probably will.\"    Silence fell, broken by the secretary.    \"General Sanford, our first C.O., was a soldier, and a good one,\" she  declared finally. \"So was Colonel Snodgrass. Lieutenant Colonel Franklin  wasn't; but he was too much of a man to do the dir ...\"    \"Dirty work,\" dryly. \"Exactly. Go on.\"    \"And Stoner, the New York half--ninety five percent, really--of Stoner  and Black, Inc., is a Big Time Operator. So we get this damned  nincompoop of a major, who doesn't know a f-u-s-e from a f-u-z-e, direct  from a Wall Street desk.\"    \"So what?\" One must have heard Ralph Kinnison say those two words to  realize how much meaning they can be made to carry.    \"So what!\" the girl blazed, wringing her hands. \"Ever since you have  been over here I have been expecting you to blow up--to smash  something--in spite of the dozens of times you have told me 'a fighter  can not slug effectively, Celeste, until he gets both feet firmly  planted.' When--_when_--are you going to get your feet "]]]
