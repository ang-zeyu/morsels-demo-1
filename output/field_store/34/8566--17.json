[Illustration: The Square Setting.]    If the animal's suspicions are not aroused, it will approach the set  unsuspectingly and attempt to raise the bait, but when it finds it  fast, it will step around some and is almost certain to step into a  trap. It will be very likely also to land in another trap after it  commences to struggle, and there will be very little danger of it  escaping.    Many of the trappers who use this method use only three traps at a  setting and arrange them in the form of a triangle. This is good but  we believe that the use of four traps will give better results.    One trapper fastened his traps to iron pins, about 10 inches in  length, and used this pin as a stake. The captured animal could  easily pull up the stake but the entire bunch of traps would act as a  drag, and it could not go far through the sage brush without getting  fastened up.    One of the best methods for both the timber wolf and the coyote is  what is known to trappers as the \"cut bank set.\" All over the western  country, along the water courses and wash-outs, will be found  straight cut banks, sometimes overhanging. Select such a bank from 5  to 7 feet high, and if you can find two bunches of cactus, about 16  or 18 inches apart, on the top of the bank, this is the place to set  the trap. If the cactus can not be found growing this way, place some  there, being very careful to give it a natural appearance, so that it  will look as if it had grown there.    The trap should be staked the length of the chain from the edge of  the bank, and the stake driven out of sight. Set the trap about 20  inches from the bank, if for coyotes, and about 26 inches, if wolves  are expected, and directly between the two bunches of cactus. Cover  the trap nicely as per instructions on a preceding page, and fasten  the bait between the cactus, on the very edge of the bank. When  properly set, the animal can not reach the bait without stepping on  the trap. When caught it immediately leaps over the bank, and as it  can not get back, will be unable to make use of its strength in  struggling, and will seldom escape. Another thing that speaks well  for this method is the fact that the fur of the captured animal is  always clean, which is more than can be said of those which are  caught in traps set and staked on level ground, where they can  struggle and roll in the dirt for hours, and sometimes days.      [Illustration: Coyote Caught at a Bank Set.]    Mr. Ira W. Bull, official hunter for the U. S. Department of  Agriculture, and now located on one of the Colorado forest reserves,  writes as follows:    \"It would be hard to make an estimate of the number of coyotes and  wolves in this section, especially coyotes, as there are so many of  them and they seem to be getting more numerous every year. There are  not so many grey wolves, but still, enough to do a lot of mischief,  as they kill stock and move on, hardly ever coming back to the  carcass for the second meal.    \"My method of trapping varies according to conditions and time of  year. When I set with small baits, I first select a smooth open  place, and cut a hole in the soil the size and shape of the trap. I  set the trap in the hole and cover carefully, fastening to a stake or  toggle, concealing by covering with dirt. I cut the bait in small  pieces, probably 40 or 50 in number, and scatter around the trap,  leaving everything looking as natural as possible. With a large bait,  say the whole or half the carcass of a horse or other large animal, I  set the trap in the same way, but use 2 or 3 or even 4 traps at the  one bait.\"    An old time trapper writes as follows: \"Water-sets are the best for  wolves if the animals are cunning. The proper way to make them is to  take a boat--don't walk along the bank but simply load your boat with  lots of bait, such as beef head, shanks, entrails, or sheep that have  died or have been killed by wolves. Start down the stream, looking  for small sand or gravel bars lying just above the water and a few  feet long. When one of these is found, run your boat up to it and  leave a beef head, a quarter of mutton or such like, and then proceed  on down to the next bar and bait it in the same way, keeping on in  that way until the bait is gone.    \"The wolf is very bait shy. It will take bait that it finds along  streams more readily than on land. In a few nights after placing your  bait, you will find that the wolves are working on it and have made  trails down the bank of the stream to the edge of the water. You will  observe that they all take the water at the same place.      [Illustration: Wolf Water Set.]    \"Now load your boat with plenty of bait as before, but this time take  also a good supply of traps, the proper size for wolves, and a supply  of clogs similar to fence posts. When you come to the bar, supply it  again with bait. Fasten your trap to a clog, set the trap at the edge  of the water in the trail and allow the clog to lie the full length  of the chain, downstream in the brush. Splash water on the clog to  wash it, and also on any brush you touch. Continue thus at the baited  places, and you will be surprised at your catch, if you have never  trapped that way.    \"As for wolves getting scarce in the West, there are some places  where the large wolves are decreasing. The coyote is becoming more  plentiful every year. They are the worst of the two among sheep and  small calves and colts. The sheep men on the desert are paying $40.00  per month to the trappers in eastern Oregon for wolves, besides  boarding them and allowing them to keep the pelts. Some trappers are  making as much as $150.00 per month. It is almost impossible to  poison wolves in this country, but I can trap them successfully  several ways.\"    One of the Minnesota trappers gives the following experience: \"In the  fall a man brought an old horse to give us for chicken feed, and  after butchering it, we hauled the insides, head and feet out into  the field along with some manure. After a few days we found that  wolves were eating it, so when we butchered the next one, we dragged  the insides around and put them in a little gulley and spread manure  around; then set two traps, No. 3 Newhouse on both sides of the  gulley and three traps down in the gulley near the bait.    \"We set these traps on Monday, and on next Thursday father saw a fox  running away from the traps, and found it had sprung one without  getting caught. I think 4 or 5 wolves came around on Friday night,  but they didn't get caught either. I moved one of the No. 3's nearer  the bait, and on Friday father bought two No. 2 1/2 Newhouse otter  traps. One of these we set where the No. 3 had been, and the other  about six rods west of the gulley. We set the two No. 2 1/2 on  Saturday morning. On Sunday morning on our way to church, we drove by  the traps and found a wolf in the new No. 2 1/2 and a red fox in the  No. 3 that I had moved up near the bait. These two traps were not  over ten feet apart. On skinning the fox we found marks as if he had  been bitten. It weighed 8 1/2 pounds and the wolf weighed 34 pounds.    \"The wolves kept coming every other day. The next Friday we found  another wolf in the same trap that the fox was caught in. On Friday  of the next week we had another wolf in the No. 2 trap. On the next  Thursday there was a wolf caught in the other No. 2 1/2 otter trap  which was set six rods from the gulley, and that was the last one we  caught up to February 15th. They don't seem to come around here now.\"    A Wyoming trapper submits the following: \"I send you herewith a photo  of a female grey wolf which I trapped in the spring of 1908; this  wolf weighed 62 pounds. I caught her in a No. 4 trap, and when I got  to within thirty yards of her I shot her with my 33 Special  Winchester.    \"The grey wolf is a powerful animal, and if a person goes too near  them when they are in a trap they are apt to escape, and another  thing, their feet are so large that a trap generally catches them by  the toes. It is nothing uncommon for a single grey wolf to destroy  $1,000 worth of stock in a year. This one that I trapped would have  in a few weeks produced 12 cubs; just think of the damage which these  thirteen wolves could have done.    \"The grey wolf is hard to trap on account of being so powerful; they  can kill a large steer or other ranch stock, in the shape of horses  or cattle, and they like their meat fresh. I had fifty traps out and  trapped 17 or 18 coyotes and several skunk while I was trying to  catch this wolf.    \"Here is the set I use: Find where the wolves have killed something  or an old carcass, or find a trail that they are in the habit of  using, for it is the habit of wolves to smell around anything they  may find dead, and scratch around the same. Dig holes to fit the jaws  and springs of your traps, put a wad of paper or wool under the pan  of trap, and cover the entire jaws of traps with a piece of paper;  then cover over the trap and chain with fine dry horse or cow manure,  so that the covering will be level with the top of the ground, and  make everything look as natural as possible.\"      [Illustration: A Trapped Wolf.]    \"The accompanying photograph shows a wolf that I caught a few years  ago and this is the way I caught it,\" writes one of the Wisconsin  trappers. \"First, I took the insides and stuff from a hog and placed  it in a clover field and set three No. 4 Hawley & Norton traps around  it, covering nicely with clover leaves, chaff, etc., but I guess I  must have been a little careless, as a hungry wolf came along, ate  what he wanted and scattered the rest of it around without springing  the traps; so I thought I would teach him how to do that trick over  again, and I took 4 more traps, making 7 in all, fastened one trap  chain to the next trap, and in this way strung them out around the  bait, fastening"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34523"],[0,"Fishes of Chautauqua, Cowley and Elk Counties, Kansas (#15)"],[1,"of fishes in the State University Museum.
