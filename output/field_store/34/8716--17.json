The golden era of the overland stage business was  from 1858 to 1866. After that, the old through routes were but fragments  \"between the tracks\" of the Central Pacific and Union Pacific roads  which were building East and West toward each other.    Wells Fargo & Co., however, clung to these fragments until the lines met  on May 10th, 1869, and a continuous transcontinental railroad was  completed. Then they turned their attention to organizing mountain stage  and express lines in the railroadless regions of the West,--some of  which still exist. And they also turned their energies to the railway  express business, in which capacity this great firm, the last of the old  stage companies, is now known the world over.        [34] Authority for Early Mail Routes is Root and Connelley's Overland  Stage to California.    [35] The reader will keep in mind that during the early days of  California history, practically all communication between that locality  and the East was carried on by steamship from New York via Panama.    [36] In June, 1860, Congress got into trouble with this company over  postal compensations. The steamship company, it appears, thought its  remuneration too low and it further protested that the diversion of mail  traffic, due to the daily Overland Stage Line and the Pony Express would  reduce its revenues still further. Congress finally adjourned without  effecting a settlement, and the mail, which was far too heavy for the  overland facilities to handle at that time, was piling up by the ton  awaiting shipment. Matters were getting serious when Cornelius  Vanderbilt came to the Government's relief and agreed to furnish steamer  service until Congress assembled in March, 1861, provided the Federal  authorities would assure him \"a fair and adequate compensation.\" This  agreement was effected and the affair settled as agreed. At the  expiration of the period, the war and the growing importance of the  overland route made steamship service by way of the Isthmus quite  obsolete.    [37] The contractors are said to have been awarded $50,000 by the  Government for their trouble in haying the agreement broken.    [38] See page 153. Holladay secured possession of the outfits of the C.  O. C. & P. P. Exp. Co., between the Missouri and Salt Lake City.    [39] The Pioneer Line which had recently come into power and prominence  had gained possession of the equipment west of Salt Lake. This line was  owned by Louis and Charles McLane. Louis McLane afterward became  President of the Wells Fargo Express Co.    [40] Holladay is said to have received one million five hundred thousand  dollars cash, and three hundred thousand dollars in express company  stock for his interests. Besides these amounts which covered only the  animals, rolling stock, stations, and incidental equipment, Wells Fargo  and Co. had to pay full market value for all grain, hay and provisions  along the line, amounting to nearly six hundred thousand dollars more.          Chapter IX    Passing of the Pony Express      When Edward Creighton completed the Pacific telegraph, and, on October  24, 1861, began sending messages; by wire from coast to coast, the  California Pony Express formally went out of existence. For over three  months since July 1, it had been paralleled by the daily overland stage;  yet the great efficiency of the semi-weekly pony line in offering quick  letter service won and retained its popularity to the very end of its  career. And this was in spite of the fact that for several weeks before  its discontinuance the pony men had ridden only between the ends of the  fast building telegraph which was constructed in two divisions--from  the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Missouri River--at the same time,  the lines meeting near the Great Salt Lake.    The people of the far West strongly protested against the elimination of  the pony line service. Early in the winter of 1862 it became  rumored--perhaps wildly--that the Committee on Finance in the House of  Representatives had, for reasons of economy, stricken out the  appropriation for the continuance of the daily stage. Whereupon the  California legislature[41] addressed a set of joint resolutions to the  state's delegation in Congress, imploring not only that the Daily Stage  be retained, but that the Pony Express be reestablished. The stage was  continued but the pony line was never restored.    As a financial venture the Pony Express failed completely. To be sure,  its receipts were sometimes heavy, often aggregating one thousand  dollars in a single day. But the expenses, on the other hand, were  enormous. Although the line was so great a factor in the California  crisis, and in assisting the Federal Government to retain the Pacific  Coast, it was the irony of fate that Congress should never give any  direct relief or financial assistance to the pony service. So completely  was this organization neglected by the government, in so far as  extending financial aid was concerned, that its financial failure, as  foreseen by Messrs. Waddell and Majors, was certain from the beginning.  The War Department did issue army revolvers and cartridges to the  riders; and the Federal troops when available, could always be relied  upon to protect the line. Yet it was generally left to the initiative  and resourcefulness of the company to defend itself as best it could  when most seriously menaced by Indians. The apparent apathy regarding  this valuable branch of the postal service can of course be partially  excused from the fact that the Civil War was in 1861 absorbing all the  energies which the Government could summon to its command. And the war,  furthermore, was playing havoc with our national finances and piling up  a tremendous national debt, which made the extension of pecuniary relief  to quasi-private operations of this kind, no matter how useful they  were, a remote possibility.    That the stage lines received the assistance they did, under such  circumstances, is to be wondered at. Yet it must be borne in mind that  at the outset much of the political support necessary to secure  appropriations for overland mail routes was derived from southern  congressmen who were anxious for routes of communication with the West  coast, especially if such routes ran through the Southwest and linked  the cotton-growing states with California.    At the very beginning, it cost about one hundred thousand dollars to  equip the Pony Express line in those days a very considerable outlay of  capital for a private corporation. Besides the purchase of more than  four hundred high grade horses, it cost large sums of money to build and  equip stations at intervals of every ten or twelve miles throughout the  long route. The wages of eighty riders and about four hundred station  men, not to mention a score of Division Superintendents was a large  item.    Most of the grain used along the line between St. Joseph and Salt Lake  City was purchased in Iowa and Missouri and shipped in wagons at a  freight rate of from ten cents to twenty cents a pound. Grain and food  stuffs for use between Salt Lake City and the Sierras were usually  bought in Utah and hauled from two hundred to seven hundred miles to the  respective stations. Hay, gathered wherever wild grasses could be found  and cured, often had to be freighted hundreds of miles.    The operating expenses of the line aggregated about thirty thousand  dollars a month, which would alone have insured a deficit as the monthly  income never equaled that amount.    A conspicuous bill of expense which helped to bankrupt the enterprise  was for protection against the savages. While this should have been  furnished by the Government or the local state or territorial militia,  it was the fate of the Company to bear the brunt of one of the worst  Indian outbreaks of that decade.    Early in 1860, shortly after the Pony Express was started, the Pah-Utes,  mention of whom has already been made, began hostilities under their  renowned chieftain Old Winnemucca. The uprising spread; soon the  Bannocks and Shoshones espoused the cause of the Utes, and the entire  territory of Nevada, Eastern California and Oregon was aflame with  Indian revolt. Besides devastating many white settlements wherever they  found them, the Indians destroyed nearly every pony station between  California and Salt Lake, murdered numbers of employes, and ran off  scores of horses. For several weeks the service was paralyzed, and had  it been in the hands of faint-hearted men it would have been ended then  and there.    The climax came with the defeat and massacre of Major Ormsby's force of  about fifty men by the Utes at the battle of Pyramid Lake in western  Nevada. Help was finally sent in from a distance, and before the first  of June, eight hundred men, including three hundred regulars and a large  number of California and Nevada volunteers, had taken the field. This  formidable campaign finally served the double purpose of protecting the  Pony Express and stage line and in subduing the Indians in a primitive  and effective manner. Order was restored and the express service resumed  on June 19. Desultory outbreaks, of course, continued to menace the line  and all forms of transportation for months afterwards.    During this campaign, the local officers and employes of the express  gave valiant service. It was remarkable that they could restore the line  so quickly as they did. The total expense of this war to the Company was  $75,000, caused by ruined and stolen property and outlays for military  supplies incidental to the equipment of volunteers.    This onslaught, coming so soon after the enterprise had begun, and when  there was already so little encouragement that the line would ever pay  out financially, must have disheartened less courageous men than  Russell, Majors and Waddell and their associates. It is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4675"],[0,"The Sea-Witch; Or, The African Quadroon: A Story of the Slave Coast (#15)"],[1,"same; he found that he must  wait some weeks even yet before he could prosecute the purpose of his  voyage, and indeed he seemed to have lost all interest in it. His  thoughts were full of too pure an object to permit him to participate to  any extent in so questionable a business. Gladly would he at any moment  have thrown up his charge of the \"Sea Witch;\" and he had indeed promised  Miss Huntington that for her sake, and in honor of her friendship (for  he had never aspired to any more intimate relationship), he would ignore  the trade altogether, and that he would despatch Mr. Faulkner, his first  officer, to the owners in Cuba with the ship he had himself taken in  charge.    Having been brought up from childhood upon the sea, he had never studied  the morality of the trade in which he was now engaged. But the nice  sense of honor which was so strong a characteristic of his nature, only  required the gentle influence of a sweet and refined nature like her  with whom providence had so opportunely thrown him, to reform him  altogether of those rougher ideas which he had naturally imbibed in the  course of his perilous and daring profession. In the presence of that  fair and pure-minded girl he was as a child, impressible, and ready to  follow her simplest instructions. All this betokened a native refinement  of soul, else he could never have evinced the pliability which had  rendered him so pleasant and agreeable a companion to her he secretly  loved.    \"Lady,\" he said to her as they sat together that afternoon, \"Heaven has  sent you for a guardian angel to me; your refining influence has come to  my heart at its most lonely, its most necessary moment. I have done with  this trade, never more to engage in it.\"    \"That is honorable, noble in you, Captain Ratlin, so promptly to  relinquish all connection with a calling, which though it affords  fortune and command, can never permit you self-respect.\"    \"The ship will probably be despatched within these two weeks, and then I  will take any birth in legitimate commerce, where I may win an honorable  name and reputation.\"    \"There is my hand on so honorable a resolution,\" said Miss huntington,  frankly, while a single tear of pleasure trembled in her clear, lustrous  eyes.    The young commander took the hand respectfully that waits extended to  him, but when he raised his eyes to her face and detected that tear, a  thought for a moment ran through his brain, a faint shadow of hope that  perhaps she loved him, or might at some future time do so, and bending  over the fair hand he held he pressed it gently to his lips. He was not  repulsed, nor chided, but she delicately rose and turned to her mother's  apartment.    How small a things will affect the whole tenor of a life time; trifles  lighter than straws are levers in the building up of destiny. Captain  Ratlin turned from that brief interview with a feeling he had never  before experienced. The idea that Miss Huntington really cared for him  beyond the ordinary interest, that the circumstances of their  acquaintances had caused, had not thus far been entertained by him; had  this been otherwise he would doubtless have differently interpreted many  agreeable tokens which she had granted him, and to which his mind now  went back eagerly to recall and consider under the new phase of feeling  which actuated him.    How else could he interpret that tear but as springing from a heart that  was full of kindly feeling towards him. It was a tell-tale drop of  crystal that glistened but one moment there. Could it have been fancy?  was it possible he could have been mistaken? The matter assumed an  aspect of intense importance it his estimation, and he paced the  apartment where she had left him alone, half in doubt, half hoping. In  one instant how different an aspect all things wore; life, its aims, the  persons he met at the door as he now passed out. Even the foliage seemed  to partake of the freshness of his spirit, and the world to become  rejuvenated and beautified in every aspect in which he could view it.    This was the bright tide of the picture which his imagination, aided by  that gaudy painter and fancy colorer, Hope, had conjured up before his  mind's eye, but the reverse side of the picture was at hand, and now he  paused to ask himself seriously: \"Can this be? Who am I? a poor unknown  sailor, fortuneless, friendless, nameless. Who is she? a lady of refined  cultivation, high family, wealth, and beauty. Is it likely that two such  persons as I have considered should be joined by intimate friendship?  can such barriers as these be broken down by love? Alas, I am not so  blind, so foolish, so unreasonable, as to believe it for a moment.\" So  once more the heart of the young commander was heavy within his breast.    In the mean time Captain Bramble had found an opportunity that afternoon  to see Maud, and to learn from her that Captain Ratlin almost always  slept on board his ship, departing soon after dark for the spot through  the jungle. Satisfied of this, Capt. Bramble once more proceeded to make  his arrangements, for to have seized the vessel without her commander on  board would have been to perform but half the business he had laid out  for the night's engagement. But all seemed now propitious, and he  awaited the darkness with impatience, when he might disembark a couple  of boat loads of sailors and marines, and with the Quadroon for guide  follow the path through the jungle to where the \"Sea Witch\" lay.    \"Why do you muse so long and lonely, my child?\" asked Mr. Huntington of  her daughter that afternoon, as she came in and surprised her gazing out  at a window vacantly.    \"O, I hardly know, dear mother. I was thinking over our strange fortune  since we left Calcutta, the wreck, the nights in the boat, and our  fortunate rescue.\"    \"Fortunate, my dear? I don't exactly know about that. Here we have been  confined at this slave factory, little better than the slaves  themselves, these four weeks.\"    \"Well, mother, Captain Bramble says he shall sail soon, and then we can  go round to Sierra Leone, and from thence take passage direct for  England.\"    \"For my part I can't understand why Capt. Bramble insists upon staying  here so long. He don't seem to be doing anything, and he came into the  harbor by chance.\"    \"He says that business and duty, which he cannot explain, detain him  here, but that he will soon leave, of which he will give us due notice.\"    \"Heaven hasten the period!\" said the mother, impatiently; \"for I am most  heartily tired and worn out with the strange life we lead here.\"    This conversation will explain to the reader in part, the reason why  Mrs. Huntington and her daughter, English subjects and in distress upon  the coast, had not at once gone on board the vessel of their sovereign  which lay in the harbor, and been carried upon their destination. From  the outset Captain Bramble had resolved not to let his rival slip  through his fingers by leaving port himself, and thus he had still  remained to the present time, though without any definite plan of  operation formed until he availed himself of Maud's proposal.    \"Why, bless me, my child, you look as though you had been crying,\" said  the mother, now, catching a glance at her daughter's face.    \"Do I, mother?\" she answered, vacantly.    This was just after she had returned from the meeting with Captain  Ratlin as already described, and whether, she had been crying or not,  the reader will probably know what feelings moved her heart.          CHAPTER XII.    THE CONFLICT.      CAPTAIN BRAMBLE knew very well that he had desperate men to deal with in  the taking of a slaver on the coast, but he had gathered his evidence  and witnesses in such a strong array that he felt warranted in going to  any length in securing possession of a clipper craft which had been so  fully described to him. He was not wanting in personal courage, and  therefore, with a well-selected body of sailors and marines, and one or  two officers, he quietly pulled away from the ship's side, under cover  of the night, and landed at the proposed spot. Here he found Maud  patiently awaiting his coming, and ready to lead him to the hiding-place  of the \"Sea Witch\" and her crew. The men were all well armed, and  instructed how to act in any possible emergency that was to be met with  in the business which brought them on shore.    On the whole body pressed in silence, through a tangled and narrow path,  being more than once startled by the growl of some wild animal, whose  haunts they disturbed. It was weary struggling by this path through the  wood, but it was the only way to approach the desired point by land.  Maud hesitated not, but stole or glided through the tangled undergrowth,  as though she had passed her whole life-time in the deep, tangled ways  of the jungle. As they went on, the moon gradually rose and lifted up  the dark path by little gleamings which stole in through the thick  leaves and close-turning branches of the lofty vegetation.    On, on they press; and now they pause at a sign from Maud, and listen to  the sound of voices, which have a strange and echo-like sound in that  wild and tangled spot. Hark! those voices are not from the tongues of  natives; that is English which they speak.    \"Hist! hist!\" whispered the Quadroon, \"we are almost upon them!\"    \"In which direction?\" asked the English officer.    \"Here, see you not those bright, silver-like scales through the leaves?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"That is the river's bed, and they lie on board their craft, moored  close to us.\"    \"How many do they number?\"    \"I know not.\"    \"It is not important,\" continued the Englishman, turning to his  followers, and in a low voice bidding them look to their weapons, for  the game was near at hand.    A few more steps brought the party to the skirts of the thicket, where  it bordered on a small clearing, opening upon the river, and looking  across "]]]
