Major Tremlett, R.A., now took the  four guns, hitherto held in reserve, to a small piece of rising ground  outside the laager, and opened fire upon the masses of the enemy with  immense execution.  From time to time Buller and Russell, as they saw  openings for a charge, swept down and drove the enemy's skirmishers back  on to their main body; the Zulus, altogether unaccustomed to cavalry,  always falling back precipitately at these assaults.    At three o'clock a hot cross-fire was opened upon a company commanded by  Captain Woodgate, which was stationed half-way between the laager and  the upper fort, keeping open a communication between them, the enemy's  fire from a height commanding this line being particularly galling.  Two  of Tremlett's guns were brought to bear on the point, and the enemy's  fire speedily slackened.  For another hour and a half the troops  continued to be hotly engaged, for the enemy, when driven back from one  flank, swept round in most perfect order and attacked another.    At half-past four the Zulus, concentrating again, attacked the northern  side, and made some desperate rushes up to the muzzles of the English  rifles, and the fighting for a time was almost hand to hand.    The boys had worked round with their stretchers, wherever the fire was  hardest, and had carried many wounded men into hospital.  They were at  the north face when the Zulus swarmed up towards it, and Woodgate's men  fell back into the shelter of the laager.  As they came in, a young  lieutenant, who was commanding the rear, fell, apparently dead.  Being  in the rear of the company his fall was unnoticed by the men.  Dick, who  was peering over the intrenchment, saw him fall, and saw too that he  moved slightly.    \"Quick, Tom!\" he exclaimed; and, carrying the stretcher, the boys  scrambled over the breastwork and ran towards the officer.  He had  fallen some twenty yards outside, and the Zulus, rushing on, were but  eighty yards away.    On reaching the side of the young officer, the boys laid their stretcher  on the ground, rolled him upon it, and, lifting it, turned towards the  camp.  A ringing cheer from the men had greeted this action, mingled  with shouts of \"Run! run!\" for by this time the Zulus were but twenty  yards behind.    A stream of fire broke out from the top of the breastworks; an assegai  whizzed over Dick's shoulder, and another grazed Tom's arm, but they  hurried on until they reached the ditch, and then threw themselves and  their burden down.  There for five or six minutes they lay, while the  fight raged above them.  Then the British cheer rose, and the boys knew  that the Zulus had fallen back.    A minute later a dozen men leapt from the intrenchment into the ditch  outside, and lifted the wounded lieutenant over it into the arms of  those behind.    \"Bravo! boys, bravo!\" a hundred voices shouted, as the boys scrambled  back into the works, while the men crowded round to pat them on the  shoulder and shake their hands.    It was evident now that the Zulu fire was slackening, and three  companies of the 13th went out, and, taking posts by the edge of the  slope of the cattle-laager, opened fire upon them, as they retired.  Every gun was brought to bear upon them, and as, disheartened and  beaten, they fell back, Buller and Russell, with every mounted man in  camp, sallied out and fell upon them, and, burning with the desire to  wipe out their misfortune of the preceding day, chased them for seven  miles, like a flock of sheep, cutting down immense numbers.    It was ascertained afterwards from prisoners that the Zulu force which  attacked was composed of 25,000 men.  It was commanded by Tyangwaiyo,  with Umbelleni as his second.  Many of the leading chiefs of Zululand  and 3000 of the king's bravest and best troops fell in the attack on  Kambula, and this battle was by far the hottest and best-contested which  took place during the war.    Upon our side two officers and twenty-one men were killed.  The  difference between the result of the action at Kambula and that at  Isandula was due entirely to the fact that in one case every precaution  was taken, every means of defence utilised; while in the other no more  attention was paid to any of these points than if the troops had been  encamped at Aldershot.    Upon the day following the battle Colonel Wood set his men to work to  erect further defences at the points which the recent action had shown  to be weak, and never ceased work until the place had been made almost  impregnable against an assault of savages, however brave.    The messenger who carried to Natal the news of the victory of Kambula  also took letters from the boys to their parents, acquainting them of  their safety; and with the first convoy of wounded on the following day  the boys started for home, Colonel Wood having given to each a  flattering testimonial as to their gallant conduct in the action, and  having presented them with two horses belonging to men of Buller's corps  who had fallen in the action, ordering that the horses should be entered  as bought for the Queen's service, and the value paid to the relatives  of their late owners.    Three days' march took the convoy to Utrecht, and the next morning the  boys rode home, the distance from there to Newcastle being about forty  miles.  They were received as if they had risen from the dead, for their  letters had not arrived before them, and their parents had of course  assumed that they had been killed at Isandula.  Both the mothers were in  mourning, and their joy at the restoration of their sons was unbounded.    Mrs Jackson fainted from surprise and delight, as Tom rode up; but  Dick, remembering the effect which the news of his being alive in the  snow had produced upon his mother, was careful to save her the shock.  Accordingly, instead of riding direct to the house, he made a devour and  rode across the farm until he met Bill Harrison.  The man was delighted  at the sight of his young master, and could hardly believe his eyes, as  he saw him riding towards him.    After the first warm greeting was over, Dick learned that his mother had  been seriously ill, and was now recovering, and that his father had been  much shaken.  Dick told Harrison to go to the house, and, under the  excuse of some question about his work, to call Mr Humphreys out, and  to tell him of his return, leaving it to him to break the news to his  wife.    This Mr Humphreys, after recovering from his own emotion at the joyful  intelligence, did so gradually and quietly, that the tale produced no  injurious effect upon the mother.    He began by saying that he had heard that a rumour was afloat that some  of those that were supposed to have been killed at Isandula had been  kept captives by the Zulus.    Mrs Humphreys for a time doubted the news, but, upon her husband's  assurance that the intelligence was well founded, a faint feeling of  hope began to spring up; then gradually, step by step, he told her that  it was reported that these captives consisted chiefly of non-combatants,  men who had taken refuge among the rocks and bushes when the fight was  seen to be going against the troops.  This still further raised Mrs  Humphreys' hopes; for, from the presence of mind and shrewdness which  Dick had shown on the occasion of the snow-storm, it seemed probable  that he would be quick to avail himself of any chance of escape there  might be.  Then Mr Humphreys said that the report affirmed that among  the prisoners were two or three quite young lads, and so step by step he  went on, until the delighted mother learned that her son was already  upon the farm, and was only waiting until he knew she would be strong  enough to see him.    Mr Humphreys now went to the door and gave a loud shout, and Dick, who  had been waiting the signal agreed on at a short distance from the  house, ran up and was soon in his parents' arms.  A minute or two later  his younger brother ran in, having just heard the news from Harrison,  and it was indeed a happy party which that night assembled in the  sitting-room of the farmhouse, and listened to Dick's account of the  adventures he had gone through.  Not a little proud were the father and  mother, as they read Colonel Wood's testimony to the gallant conduct of  their son.    The next day Mr and Mrs Jackson drove over with Tom, and the warmest  congratulations were exchanged.    \"Have you been paid for the waggons, father?\"  Dick asked.    \"Yes, my boy, for there was a notice that the owners of all waggons and  teams destroyed at Isandula would be paid at once.  As there was a  record kept of the ownership of those which accompanied the column,  there was of course no difficulty in proving the loss, and both Mr  Jackson and myself received orders on the public treasury for their  value last week.  You see more transports were required, and there was  such a panic after Isandula, that if government had not promptly paid  for their losses there, they would have got no more waggons from farmers  for their work.  We have already four more building for us at  Newcastle.\"    \"I suppose there was a great fright in the colony after the defeat?\"    \"Terrible!\"  Mr Humphreys answered.  \"Everyone imagined that the Zulus  would at once cross the frontier, and carry fire and sword throughout  the colony.  The rest of the 4th Regiment instantly went forward to  Colonel Glyn's column, and this restored it to something like its  strength before the fight.  The rivers were high, which may have  accounted partly for the Zulus not taking the offensive.  Probably too  the great loss which they themselves must have suffered had some effect;  while they might not have liked to have advanced in force across the  frontier, being, as they were, threatened on the one side by the column  of Colonel Wood at Kambula, and on the other by that of Colonel Pearson  at Ekowe.\"    \"I have not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32947"],[0,"On Snake-Poison: Its Action and Its Antidote (#15)"],[1,"system,\" written on the face of every one of them, so  much so that this became the foundation and corner stone of his present  structure, which, however, it took him a quarter of a century to erect;  for the material he required, namely, cases of snakebite observed from  an early stage, and from which all disturbing elements were excluded,  did not occur very frequently in his practice. Though he lived all the  time among mountains, the beautiful Australian Alps, on the rivers and  creeks of which snakes are abundant, and though these creatures and  anything connected with them had an almost fascinating interest for him,  years sometimes elapsed without adding one single good case to his  notes. Sometimes his patients were dead when he reached them, and all  his entreaties for an autopsy were in vain with the relatives. More  frequently he found that they were not bitten at all, and only suffered  from the effects of fear or of enormous doses of alcohol. On persons  really bitten, but completely paralysed and comatose, observations were  also unsatisfactory, as they had to be supplemented by second-hand  evidence obtained from those who had been with them before they became  unconscious. Thus within 25 years the author did not see more than  half-a-dozen really instructive cases; and frequently his desire for  more evidence overcame his reluctance to inflict on animals the agony of  snakebite he had himself endured, and he made a few experiments, but  soon gave them up again as unsatisfactory. All the evidence, however, he  had thus far collected tended to confirm the correctness of his ideas as  to the action of snake-poison. At last, some ten years ago, he obtained  absolute certainty, and this, strange to relate, by a case of spider  bite.    He was called early one morning to visit a little boy, two years old,  and on examination found that he presented symptoms almost identical  with those of snakebite poisoning. Although there was no evidence of the  child having come in contact with a snake, the writer naturally  concluded that during the night a snake had obtained access to the  bedroom through the open door or window, and after biting the child  sleeping in its low cot, had escaped again. He therefore searched most  carefully for the usual two punctures, but they were not to be found.  The child evidently laboured under the effect of some poison, and  spiderbite suggested itself, but the symptoms were so much more  aggravated than anything the writer had frequently seen of spiderbite  that he hesitated to accept it as the cause, although it appeared almost  the only possible one. A careful inquiry into the history of the case  elicited from the mother the important fact that on the previous  afternoon the little fellow, just able to toddle about, had gradually  lost the use of his legs, and also become very peevish, and that  suspecting nothing but a little temporary indisposition, she had put him  to bed, to find him in the morning all but dead. He was scarcely  breathing when the writer saw him, and only the stethoscope gave  evidence of the heart still beating feebly. His body was very cold,  pupils widely dilated, and the sight even apparently gone, the eyes wide  open, staring fixedly upwards and not noticing a lighted match in  closest proximity to them. Consciousness also appeared extinct, as  liquids introduced into the mouth were not swallowed. Examining once  more for traces of spiderbite in the skin, the writer noticed faint red  stripes extending up the arm from a little cut on the right index finger  near the nail, and on inquiry it was ascertained at last from an elder  brother that he had seen the child pick up a little black spider with a  red back, hold it for some time between thumb and index finger, and then  throw it away. This was evidently the Katipo (_Latrodectus icelio_), the  poison of which acts on the same principle as snake-poison, but  generally much milder. The greater severity of its action in this case  was accounted for by the mandibles having been inserted into the cut,  and the insect, being squeezed by the child, having emptied the whole  available contents of its poison gland into the cellular tissue exposed  in the cut, whence it was quickly absorbed. This also accounted for the  absence of all irritation and of the neuralgic pains usually  accompanying spiderbite, when the mandibles merely perforate the  epidermis and the poison is deposited in the upper cutis, where  absorption is slow and local irritation consequently greater.    Minuteness of detail in relating this case must be excused on account of  the extreme interest and importance attached to it. Being brought about  under such peculiar and almost unique circumstances it presented the  effects of spider-poison in a superlative degree and showed them to be  identical with those of snake-poison. But whilst the latter ushers in  the symptoms with such rapidity that they cover each other and are  difficult of separate analysis, in this case the highly significant  paresis of the lower extremities, evidently of central origin, remained  separate for some time. Taking this symptom for his guide and  interpreting the formidable array of the others, developed during the  night, on the same principle, the writer's diagnosis of the case, as it  presented itself to him, was paralysis of the motor and vaso-motor  nerve-centres. This, he found, and this alone could explain all the  symptoms, and he therefore determined to put its correctness to a  practical test. There was but one remedy to make this test with and this  had to be applied without delay, for the child was rapidly sinking and  had almost ceased to breathe. _One twelfth of a grain_ of strychnine was  therefore injected in the arm, a bold dose for so young a child, but, as  the result showed, exactly the one that was required. The test was  eminently successful. Having to leave the child immediately after the  injection, the writer on returning in half an hour found his little  patient sitting up in bed, perfectly restored, with both poisons so  completely neutralising each other, that not a trace of either could be  detected. Thus the writer's structure was at last completed, and an  insignificant spider furnished the last material required for an  important discovery.    There are a few hypothetical points yet in the explanation of some of  the symptoms of snakebite-poisoning by the writer's theory, but these  imperfections are more those of science than of the theory. The whole  subject of vaso-motor paralysis for instance, and of the pathological  changes that follow it, is more or less a _terra incognita_. Diapedesis  is now supposed to be the result of blood pressure, but it occurs in  snakebite, where blood pressure is at zero. Feoktistow, we have seen,  produced it locally on the mesentery of animals with normal blood  pressure, whilst Banerjee arrested by strychnine-injections profuse  haemorrhages from all the mucous surfaces, which were no doubt the result  of diapedesis. We know that neither snake-poison nor strychnine affect  the nerve ends but only the nerve cells. There must therefore be nerve  cells at or near the terminations of the nerves regulating the  capillary circulation in the mucous membranes, but microscopical anatomy  has yet to find them, for minute ganglia have only been discovered at  present in sympathetic nerve ends of the abdomen.    On other subjects also, besides that of vaso-motor paralysis, the  strychnine treatment of snakebite has thrown an unexpected light. We did  not know before it was demonstrated by this treatment that sleep is  merely a reduced discharge of motor-nerve force, a partial turning off  of the motor-batteries, by which, through rest, they are invigorated for  fresh action during the waking hours, and that the degrees of this  reduction range in their effects from sleep, more or less deep, down to  coma, and can be raised again from coma to sleep, and from sleep to  complete wakefulness. We knew that every movement and action is brought  about by a discharge of this force, but we did not know that even the  silent thought must be carried on the wings of it, and cannot take place  without it, at least not in our present state of existence. All these  important revelations are now the property of science, and it will be  well for science to take note of them.           *       *       *       *       *    In conclusion, the writer may be permitted to express his joy and  thankfulness for having been made the instrument, by Divine Providence,  to confer a boon on humanity that will prevent much suffering and  thousands of premature, untimely deaths.              +-----------------------------------------------+      |             Transcriber's Note:               |      |                                               |      | Inconsistent hyphenation and spelling in the  |      | original document have been preserved.        |      |                                               |      | Typographical errors corrected in the text:   |      |                                               |      | Page 23  intracardial changed to intracardiac |      | Page 69  Banarjee changed to Banerjee         |      | Page 73  ease changed to case                 |      +-----------------------------------------------+"]]]
