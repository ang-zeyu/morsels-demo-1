No damage was done even when two shells came into one of their billets,  where a number of men were sleeping after a hard day and a long march.    \"I woke up pretty quick,\" said one of them, \"and thought the house had  fallen in. I was out of it before the second came. Then I laughed. I'm a  heavy sleeper, you know. [He spoke as if I knew his weakness.] My mother  bought me an alarm-clock last birthday. 'Perhaps you'll be down for  breakfast now,' she said. But a shell is better--as a knocker-up. I  didn't stop to dress.\"    Death had missed him by a foot or two, but he laughed at the fluke of  his escape.    \"K.'s men\" had not forgotten how to laugh after those eleven months  of hard training, and they found a joke in grisly things which do not  appeal humorously to sensitive men.    \"Any room for us there?\" asked one of these bronzed fellows as he  marched with his battalion past a cemetery where the fantastic devices  of French graves rose above the churchyard wall.    \"Oh, we'll do all right in the open air, all along of the German  trenches,\" was the answer he had from the lad at his side. They grinned  at their own wit.          IV      I did not find any self-conscious patriotism among the rank and file of  the New Army. The word itself meant nothing to them. Unlike the French  soldier, to whom patriotism is a religion and who has the name of  France on his lips at the moment of peril, our men were silent about the  reasons for their coming out and the cause for which they risked their  lives. It was not for imperial power. Any illusion to \"The Empire\" left  them stone--cold unless they confused it with the Empire Music Hall,  when their hearts warmed to the name. It was not because they hated  Germans, because after a few turns in the trenches many of them had a  fellow-feeling for the poor devils over the way, and to the end of the  war treated any prisoners they took (after the killing in hot blood)  like pet monkeys or tame bears. But for stringent regulations they would  have fraternized with the enemy at the slightest excuse, and did so  in the winter of 1914, to the great scandal of G. H. Q. \"What's  patriotism?\" asked a boy of me, in Ypres, and there was hard scorn in  his voice. Yet the love of the old country was deep down in the roots of  their hearts, and, as with a boy who came from the village where I lived  for a time, the name of some such place held all the meaning of life to  many of them. The simple minds of country boys clung fast to that, went  back in waking dreams to dwell in a cottage parlor where their parents  sat, and an old clock ticked, and a dog slept with its head on its paws.  The smell of the fields and the barns, the friendship of familiar trees,  the heritage that was in their blood from old yeoman ancestry, touched  them with the spirit of England, and it was because of that they fought.    The London lad was more self-conscious, had a more glib way of  expressing his convictions, but even he hid his purpose in the war under  a covering of irony and cynical jests. It was the spirit of the old city  and the pride of it which helped him to suffer, and in his daydreams was  the clanging of 'buses from Charing Cross to the Bank, the lights of the  embankment reflected in the dark river, the back yard where he had kept  his bicycle, or the suburban garden where he had watered his mother's  plants... London! Good old London!... His heart ached for it sometimes  when, as sentry, he stared across the parapet to the barbed wire in No  Man's Land.    One night, strolling outside my own billet and wandering down the lane  a way, I heard the sound of singing coming from a big brick barn on  the roadside. I stood close under the blank wall at the back of the  building, and listened. The men were singing \"Auld Lang Syne\" to the  accompaniment of a concertina and a mouth-organ. They were taking parts,  and the old tune--so strange to hear out in a village of France, in the  war zone--sounded very well, with deep-throated harmonies. Presently the  concertina changed its tune, and the men of the New Army sang \"God Save  the King.\" I heard it sung a thousand times or more on royal festivals  and tours, but listening to it then from that dark old barn in Flanders,  where a number of \"K.'s men\" lay on the straw a night or two away from  the ordeal of advanced trenches, in which they had to take their turn, I  heard it with more emotion than ever before. In that anthem, chanted  by these boys in the darkness, was the spirit of England. If I had been  king, like that Harry who wandered round the camp of Agincourt, where  his men lay sleeping, I should have been glad to stand and listen  outside that barn and hear those words:    Send him victorious, Happy and glorious.    As the chief of the British tribes, the fifth George received his  tribute from those warrior boys who had come out to fight for the flag  that meant to them some old village on the Sussex Downs, where a mother  and a sweetheart waited, or some town in the Midlands where the walls  were placarded with posters which made the Germans gibe, or old London,  where the 'buses went clanging down the Strand.    As I went back up the lane a dark figure loomed out, and I heard the  click of a rifle-bolt. It was one of K.'s men, standing sentry outside  the camp.    \"Who goes there?\"    It was a cockney voice.    \"Friends.\"    \"Pass, friends. All's well.\"    Yes, all was well then, as far as human courage and the spirit of  a splendid youthfulness counted in that war of high explosives and  destructive chemistry. The fighting in front of these lads of the New  Army decided the fate of the world, and it was the valor of those young  soldiers who, in a little while, were flung into hell-fires and killed  in great numbers, which made all things different in the philosophy of  modern life. That concertina in the barn was playing the music of an  epic which will make those who sang it seem like heroes of mythology to  the future race which will read of this death-struggle in Europe. Yet it  was a cockney, perhaps from Clapham junction or Peckham Rye, who said,  like a voice of Fate, \"All's well.\"          V      When the New Army first came out to learn their lessons in the trenches  in the long days before open warfare, the enemy had the best of it in  every way. In gunpowder and in supplies of ammunition he was our master  all along the line, and made use of his mastery by flinging over large  numbers of shells, of all sizes and types, which caused a heavy toll  in casualties to us; while our gunners were strictly limited to a few  rounds a day, and cursed bitterly because they could not \"answer back.\"  In March of 1915 I saw the first fifteen-inch howitzer open fire. We  called this monster \"grandma,\" and there was a little group of generals  on the Scherpenberg, near Kemmel, to see the effect of the first shell.  Its target was on the lower slope of the Wytschaete Ridge, where some  trenches were to be attacked for reasons only known by our generals  and by God. Preliminary to the attack our field-guns opened fire with  shrapnel, which scattered over the German trenches--their formidable  earthworks with deep, shell-proof dugouts--like the glitter of confetti,  and had no more effect than that before the infantry made a rush for the  enemy's line and were mown down by machine-gun fire--the Germans were  very strong in machine-guns, and we were very weak--in the usual way  of those early days. The first shell fired by our monster howitzer was  heralded by a low reverberation, as of thunder, from the field below  us. Then, several seconds later, there rose from the Wytschaete Ridge a  tall, black column of smoke which stood steady until the breeze clawed  at it and tore it to tatters.    \"Some shell!\" said an officer. \"Now we ought to win the war--I don't  think!\"    Later there arrived the first 9.2 (nine-point-two)--\"aunty,\" as we  called it.    Well, that was something in the way of heavy artillery, and gradually  our gun-power grew and grew, until we could \"answer back,\" and give more  than came to us; but meanwhile the New Army had to stand the racket,  as the Old Army had done, being strafed by harassing fire, having their  trenches blown in, and their billets smashed, and their bodies broken,  at all times and in all places within range of German guns.    Everywhere the enemy was on high ground and had observation of our  position. From the Westhook Ridge and the Pilkem Ridge his observers  watched every movement of our men round Ypres, and along the main road  to Hooge, signaling back to their guns if anybody of them were visible.  From the Wytschaete Ridge (White-sheet, as we called it) and Messines  they could see for miles across our territory, not only the trenches,  but the ways up to the trenches, and the villages behind them and the  roads through the villages. They looked straight into Kemmel village  and turned their guns on to it when our men crouched among its ruins  and opened the graves in the cemetery and lay old bones bare. Clear and  vivid to them were the red roofs of Dickebusch village and the gaunt  ribs of its broken houses. (I knew a boy from Fleet Street who was  cobbler there in a room between the ruins.) Those Germans gazed down the  roads to Vierstraat and Vormizeele, and watched for the rising of  white dust which would tell them when men were marching by--more cannon  fodder. Southward they saw Neuve Eglise, with its rag of a tower, and  Plug Street wood. In cheerful mood, on sunny days, German gunners with  shells to spare ranged upon separate farm-houses and isolated barns  until they became bits of oddly standing brick about great holes. They  shelled the roads down which our transport wagons"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3327"],[0,"Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable (#15)"],[1,"of various kinds.  So he  emptied his net, and proceeded to sort the fishes on the grass.  The place where he stood was a beautiful island in the river, a  solitary spot, uninhabited, and not used for pasturage of cattle,  nor ever visited by any but himself.  On a sudden, the fishes,  which had been laid on the grass, began to revive and move their  fins as if they were in the water; and while he looked on  astonished, they one and all moved off to the water, plunged in  and swam away.  He did not know what to make of this, whether  some god had done it, or some secret power in the herbage.  \"What  herb has such a power?\" he exclaimed; and gathering some, he  tasted it.  Scarce had the juices of the plant reached his palate  when he found himself agitated with a longing desire for the  water.  He could no longer restrain himself, but bidding farewell  to earth, he plunged into the stream.  The gods of the water  received him graciously, and admitted him to the honor of their  society.  They obtained the consent of Oceanus and Tethys, the  sovereigns of the sea, that all that was mortal in him should be  washed away.  A hundred rivers poured their waters over him .  Then he lost all sense of his former nature and all  consciousness.  When he recovered, he found himself changed in  form and mind.  His hair was sea-green, and trailed behind him on  the water; his shoulders grew broad, and what had been thighs and  legs assumed the form of a fish's tail.  The sea-gods  complimented him on the change of his appearance, and he himself  was pleased with his looks.    One day Glaucus saw the beautiful maiden Scylla, the favorite of  the water-nymphs, rambling on the shore, and when she had found a  sheltered nook, laving her limbs in the clear water.  He fell in  love with her, and showing himself on the surface, spoke to her,  saying such things as he thought most likely to win her to stay;  for she turned to run immediately on sight of him and ran till  she had gained a cliff overlooking the sea.  Here she stopped and  turned round to see whether it was a god or a sea-animal, and  observed with wonder his shape and color.  Glaucus, partly  emerging from the water, and supporting himself against a rock,  said, \"Maiden, I am no monster, nor a sea-animal, but a god; and  neither Proteus nor Triton ranks higher than I.  Once I was a  mortal, and followed the sea for a living; but now I belong  wholly to it.\"  Then he told the story of his metamorphosis and  how he had been promoted to his present dignity, and added, \"But  what avails all this if it fails to move your heart?\"  He was  going on in this strain, but Scylla turned and hastened away.    Glaucus was in despair, but it occurred to him to consult the  enchantress, Circe.  Accordingly he repaired to her island,   the  same where afterwards Ulysses landed, as we shall see in another  story.  After mutual salutations, he said, \"Goddess, I entreat  your pity; you alone can relieve the pain I suffer.  The power of  herbs I know as well as any one, for it is to them I owe my  change of form I love Scylla.  I am ashamed to tell you how I  have sued and promised to her, and how scornfully she has treated  me.  I beseech you to use your incantations, or potent herbs, if  they are more prevailing, not to cure me of my love,   for that I  do not wish,   but to make her share it and yield me a like  return.\"  To which Circe replied, for she was not insensible to  the attractions of the sea-green deity, \"You had better pursue a  willing object; you are worthy to be sought, instead of having to  seek in vain.  Be not diffident, know your own worth.  I protest  to you that even I, goddess though I be, and learned in the  virtues of plants and spells, should not know how to refuse you  If she scorns you, scorn her; meet one who is ready to meet you  half way, and thus make a due return to both at once.\"  To these  words Glaucus replied, \"Sooner shall trees grow at the bottom of  the ocean, and seaweed on the top of the mountains, than I will  cease to love Scylla, and her alone.\"    The goddess was indignant, but she could not punish him, neither  did she wish to do so, for she liked him too well; so she turned  all her wrath against her rival, poor Scylla.  She took plants of  poisonous powers and mixed them together, with incantations and  charms.  Then she passed through the crowd of gambolling beasts,  the victims of her art, and proceeded to the coast of Sicily,  where Scylla lived.  There was a little bay on the shore to which  Scylla used to resort, in the heat of the day, to breathe the air  of the sea, and to bathe in its waters.  Here the goddess poured  her poisonous mixture, and muttered over it incantations of  mighty power.  Scylla came as usual and plunged into the water up  to her waist.  What was her horror to perceive a brood of  serpents and barking monsters surrounding her!  At first she  could not imagine they were a part of herself, and tried to run  from them, and to drive them away; but as she ran she carried  them with her, and when she tried to touch her limbs, she found  her hands touch only the yawning jaws of monsters.  Scylla  remained rooted to the spot.  Her temper grew as ugly as her  form, and she took pleasure in devouring hapless mariners who  came within her grasp.  Thus she destroyed six of the companions  of Ulysses, and tried to wreck the ships of Aeneas, till at last  she was turned into a rock, and as such still continues to be a  terror to mariners.    The following is Glaucus's account of his feelings after his  \"sea-change:\"      \"I plunged for life or death.  To interknit    One's senses with so dense a breathing stuff    Might seem a work of pain; so not enough    Can I admire how crystal-smooth it felt,    And buoyant round my limbs.  At first I dwelt    Whole days and days in sheer astonishment;    Forgetful utterly of self-9ntent,    Moving but with the mighty ebb and flow.    Then like a new-fledged bird that first doth show    His spreaded feathers to the morrow chill,    I tried in fear the pinions of my well.    \"Twas freedom!  And at once I visited    The ceaseless wonders of this ocean-bed.\"    Keats.        Chapter V    Pygmalion.  Dryope.  Venus and Adonis.  Apollo and Hyacinthus.  Ceyx and Halcyone.    Pygmalion saw so much to blame in women that he came at last to  abhor the sex, and resolved to live unmarried.  He was a  sculptor, and had made with wonderful skill a statue of ivory, so  beautiful that no living woman could be compared to it in beauty.  It was indeed the perfect semblance of a maiden that seemed to be  alive, and only prevented from moving by modesty.  His art was so  perfect that it concealed itself, and its product looked like the  workmanship of nature.  Pygmalion admired his own work, and at  last fell in love with the counterfeit creation.  Oftentimes he  laid his hand upon it, as if to assure himself whether it were  living or not, and could not even then believe that it was only  ivory.  He caressed it, and gave it presents such as young girls  love,   bright shells and polished stones, little birds and  flowers of various hues, beads and amber.  He put raiment on its  limbs, and jewels on its fingers, and a necklace about its neck.  To the ears he hung earrings and strings of pearls upon the  breast.  Her dress became her, and she looked not less charming  than when unattired.  He laid her on a couch spread with cloths  of Tyrian dye, and called her his wife, and put her head upon a  pillow of the softest feathers, as if she could enjoy their  softness.    The festival of Venus was at hand,   a festival celebrated with  great pomp at Cyprus.  Victims were offered, the altars smoked,  and the odor of incense filled the air.  When Pygmalion had  performed his part in the solemnities, he stood before the altar  and timidly said, \"Ye gods, who can do all things, give me, I  pray you, for my wife\"   he dared not say \"my ivory virgin,\" but  said instead   \"one like my ivory virgin.\"  Venus, who was  present at the festival, heard him and knew the thought he would  have uttered; and, as an omen of her favor, caused the flame on  the altar to shoot up thrice in a fiery point into the air.  When  he returned home, he went to see his statue, and, leaning over  the couch, gave a kiss to the mouth.  It seemed to be warm.  He  pressed its lips again, he laid his hand upon the limbs; the  ivory felt soft to his touch, and yielded to his fingers like the  wax of Hymettus.  While he stands astonished and glad, though  doubting, and fears he may be mistaken, again and again with a  lover's ardor he touches the object of his hopes.  It was indeed  alive!  The veins when pressed yielded to the finger and then  resumed their roundness.  Then at last the votary of Venus found  words to thank the goddess, and pressed his lips upon lips as  real as his own.  The virgin felt the kisses and blushed, and,  opening her timid eyes to the light, fixed them at the same  moment on her lover.  Venus blessed the nuptials she had formed,  and from this union Paphos was born, from whom the city, sacred  to Venus, received its name.    Schiller, in his poem, the Ideals, applies this tale of Pygmalion  to the love of nature in a youthful heart.  In Schiller's  version, as in William Morris's, the statue is of marble.      \"As once with prayers in passion flowing,    Pygmalion embraced the stone,    Till from the frozen marble glowing,    The light of feeling o'er him shone,    So did I clasp with young devotion    Bright Nature to a poet's heart;    Till breath and warmth and vital motion    Seemed through the statue form to dart.      \"And then in all my ardor sharing,    The silent form expression found;    Returned my kiss of youthful daring,    And understood my heart's quick sound.    Then lived for me the bright creation.    The silver rill with song was rife;    The trees, the roses shared sensation,    An echo of my"]]]
