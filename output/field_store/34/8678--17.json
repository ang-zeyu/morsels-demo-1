The sound of the bells ceased, and  the merriment went on, while the young man with eyebrows lighter than  ever, but with radiant face, let himself quietly into the car  unnoticed. It had been his own thought to creep out into the storm,  clear away the snow from the nearest locomotive bell, and ring it  while the gayety was at its height.    All this indeed there was, and more; but to Bob, the joy and sweetness  of the evening centered in one bright face. What mattered it if the  wind roared and moaned about the lonely, snow-drifted train, while he  could look into those brown eyes and listen to that voice for whose  every tone he was fast learning to watch? Truly, it was a wonderful  evening altogether.    Well, the blockade was raised, and the long railroad trip finished at  last. But two of its passengers, at least, have agreed to enter upon a  still longer journey.    She says it all began when he came staggering in with his armful of  wood and his blue mittens; and he? he doesn't care at all when it  began. He only realizes the joy that has come to him, and believes  that after a certain day next May it will be Christmas for him all the  year round.          IX    TREASURE TROVE; A CHRISTMAS STORY      Everybody in that part of the city knew Old Claus; that is, they knew  him by sight; very few had ever spoken to him or heard his voice. The  grocer and the provision man, and one or two others said he was civil  enough to them, that his name was Jonathan R. Claus, spelt with a _u_,  not a _w_, and that he paid his bills promptly. That was about all  anybody knew of him.    What a surly, grim old man he was, as you met him on a cold winter's  afternoon on his way home from his marketing; his long white hair and  beard blowing about his head, his forehead puckered into a frown, his  stout cane striking the pavements as if he hated the very earth he  walked on!    Grown people gave him the width of the sidewalk; children shouted  after him,        \"Old Claus,      Show your claws!\"    and then dodged around the corner in terror, although he had never  been known to punish or even chide one of them, save by a dark look  from beneath his shaggy eyebrows. Ah, a gloomy, silent, mysterious  fellow he was, to be sure; and many a mother in that neighborhood  frightened her child into good behavior by threatening to call in Old  Claus.    One cold December evening, when the twilight had fallen early,  hastened by leaden skies and a few shivering flakes of snow, he sat in  his own room, solitary as usual, and even more than usually grim, for  he was thinking over his past.    Now, thinking over one's past may be a very cheerful occupation or a  very gloomy one. Old Claus undoubtedly found his full of shadows.    He remembered how he was left an orphan, when still a small boy; how  he had suffered from cold and want, and had been buffeted and scolded  and ill-used, until he ran away from the people who had taken charge  of him (he had no home nor friends); how he had worked hard, had saved  his money, and had become a very rich man.    Still he had longed to be richer, and, retiring from regular business,  he had gone far away to search for a sunken treasure in tropical seas.  He had failed to find it, but more eager than ever, he mined for gold,  without success. Again, it was the buried hoard of a pirate which  attracted him; but months of fruitless labor had been thrown away in a  vain attempt to discover exactly where it lay. So he had spent his  years, always in search of a Treasure, which had become the ruling  idea of his life; always disappointed; until, embittered, discouraged  and alone in the world, though still rich, he had given up the  pursuit.    The home he had chosen was as strange as the life he had lived; a  huge, old-fashioned house, which had once been occupied by a wealthy  family, but had long lain empty, save for the rats that scampered  through its wide halls and gloomy chambers, and the spiders that spun  their webs unhindered across the blurred window-panes.    The city had grown up about the house, and it was now part of a brick  block. Indeed, one wing of the ancient building formed a portion of  the tenement house next door, where it seemed as if men wrangled and  staggered, and ragged women scolded and wept, and children cried from  hunger and cold, all night long. But the walls were very thick, and  the occupant of the lonely chamber heard them not.    \"Christmas Eve,\" muttered Old Claus to himself. \"I heard them say it  in the streets. Merry Christmas! merry, merry Christmas!\" he repeated  bitterly. \"Right merry for me. What a wretched, useless failure of a  wreck I am!\"    As he spoke he stamped his foot angrily upon the floor. There was a  crash in the room behind him. Looking over his shoulder, he found that  a large picture, an old portrait, the frame of which had been built  into the wall and alone remained of the former splendor of the  mansion, lay face downward upon the floor. Jarred by his heavy  footfall, the decaying woodwork had at last given way, and let the  canvas drop.    Claus' glance wandered to the wall where it had been fastened. Then he  started to his feet, the old fire returning to his eyes. In place of  the picture was an opening, with a deep space beyond. He raised  himself on tiptoe, and saw what appeared to be the top of a flight of  steps, built into the thickness of the wall, and leading downward.    \"Treasure at last!\" he stammered, gazing greedily at the dusty steps,  down which a huge rat scrambled, squeaking. \"Treasure at last! I knew  luck would turn! After all these years! It is mine, it is mine!\"    Hastening to the mantel, he took down a small lamp, lighted it with  trembling fingers, and dragging a chair to the wall beneath the  aperture, climbed up to and into it. Yes, it was plainly a stone  flight of steps. What bags of gold must lie at the bottom of that  long-hidden passage?    He tested the stairway cautiously with his foot, and, finding it  apparently secure, slowly descended, the space being barely wide  enough for him to squeeze through.    Eight, nine, ten steps down. Then a sharp turn to the right! two more  steps, and he emerged from the narrow passage into what once must have  been a huge fireplace, having a hidden door in one side, some freak of  the ancient builders, to allow a person to pass from one portion of  the old house to the other without detection.    As Claus glanced about him his heart sank. There was no sign of a  treasure. The chimney overhead had been stopped with stone slabs, and  the original opening of the fireplace was closed by a wooden  partition, one panel of which was hinged and bolted so as to form a  small door. Doubtless the people in the next house were ignorant of  this, and, probably, of the existence of the fireplace itself.    It was very cold, and the disappointed man shivered as he prepared to  retrace his steps to his own quarters. Suddenly he heard a noise in  the room beyond the fireboard. It was the sound of a child sobbing  quietly to itself. In another moment a heavy, drunken step sounded on  the bare floor.    \"Are ye goin' to stop cryin', Moll, or will I give ye the stick agin?\"  demanded a woman's harsh voice. \"What's the matter now?\"    \"I won't--any--more,\" he could hear the child answer. \"I don't--mean  to. Only I was thinkin' it was Christmas to-morrow, and I  wouldn't--get anything,--mother used to\"--    \"Stop that!\" warningly.    It was evidently hard work to control the sobs, now. Old Claus  clenched his fist, and resolved that if he heard the sound of a blow,  that fireboard would go down.    There was silence for a minute. Then the woman staggered off,  muttering: \"Don't let me hear any more from ye the night. Go to sleep,  d' ye hear? You must be off with yer basket agin in the mornin'.\"    Five minutes later a singular sight might have been seen in front of  the big house. It was nothing less than Old Claus himself, clad in his  shaggy fur coat, setting forth through the darkness and snow, which  was now falling fast.    Past liquor saloons ablaze with light and hung, alas! with holly and  mistletoe; past the little Mission Church at the corner, where he  lingered an instant to catch the notes of a glad Christmas carol; away  from the wretched and squalid quarter of the city he marched, halting  only when he reached a toy-shop, where there were multitudes of  talking dolls and barking dogs and mewing cats and bleating sheep;  where people tumbled over each other in their eagerness to buy, and  blew into all the toy horns and jingled all the toy pianos and laughed  from the pure joy of Christmastide, like God's own little children.    It was a good half hour again before Old Claus dismissed at his own  door the boy who had helped him bring home his bundles from that  blessed toy-shop. The boy went off whistling, too, with a bright new  silver dollar in his pocket.    It took the old man three trips to get his purchases down that secret  stairway. I don't know how he ever got the sled through anyway; nor  the big doll with eyes that winked upside down, nor the sheep, nearly  life-size, which _baa_-ed loudly in the passage; and the tricycle was  the worst of all; but he did it and landed them safely in the old  fireplace, which surely never contained such precious fuel before.  Why, the very smell of the toys, a delicious painty, gluey, varnishy,  woolly, sawdusty smell, was enough to set you wild with delight. It  brought to Old Claus some dim remembrance of his childhood, and made  him pause to wipe away a tear with his shaggy sleeve. For all this  time he was in fur coat and cap, with snow lying thick upon them.    Now came the trying moment. Could he open that long-disused door  without waking the child, who now was evidently sleeping soundly?    Dear old door--I believe it knew, as well as you do,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4320"],[0,"An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals (#15)"],[1,"serviceable than iron, acquires from its scarcity a value  which is much superior.    The defects of judgement can be supplied by no art or invention; but  those of memory frequently may, both in business and in study, by method  and industry, and by diligence in committing everything to writing;  and we scarcely ever hear a short memory given as a reason for a man's  failure in any undertaking. But in ancient times, when no man could make  a figure without the talent of speaking, and when the audience were too  delicate to bear such crude, undigested harangues as our extemporary  orators offer to public assemblies; the faculty of memory was then of  the utmost consequence, and was accordingly much more valued than at  present. Scarce any great genius is mentioned in antiquity, who is not  celebrated for this talent; and Cicero enumerates it among the other  sublime qualities of Caesar himself. [Footnote: Fruit in Illo Ingenium,  ratio, memoria, literae, cura, cogitatio, diligentia &c. Phillip. 2.].    Particular customs and manners alter the usefulness of qualities: they  also alter their merit. Particular situations and accidents have, in  some degree, the same influence. He will always be more esteemed, who  possesses those talents and accomplishments, which suit his station and  profession, than he whom fortune has misplaced in the part which she has  assigned him. The private or selfish virtues are, in this respect,  more arbitrary than the public and social. In other respects they are,  perhaps, less liable to doubt and controversy.    In this kingdom, such continued ostentation, of late years, has  prevailed among men in ACTIVE life with regard to PUBLIC SPIRIT, and  among those in SPECULATIVE with regard to BENEVOLENCE; and so many false  pretensions to each have been, no doubt, detected, that men of the world  are apt, without any bad intention, to discover a sullen incredulity  on the head of those moral endowments, and even sometimes absolutely to  deny their existence and reality. In like manner I find, that, of old,  the perpetual cant of the STOICS and CYNICS concerning VIRTUE, their  magnificent professions and slender performances, bred a disgust in  mankind; and Lucian, who, though licentious with regard to pleasure,  is yet in other respects a very moral writer, cannot sometimes talk of  virtue, so much boasted without betraying symptoms of spleen and irony.  But surely this peevish delicacy, whence-ever it arises can never be  carried so far as to make us deny the existence of every species of  merit, and all distinction of manners and behaviour. Besides DISCRETION,  CAUTION, ENTERPRISE, INDUSTRY, ASSIDUITY, FRUGALITY, ECONOMY,  GOOD-SENSE, PRUDENCE, DISCERNMENT; besides these endowments, I say,  whose very names force an avowal of their merit, there are many others,  to which the most determined scepticism cannot for a moment refuse  the tribute of praise and approbation. TEMPERANCE, SOBRIETY, PATIENCE,  CONSTANCY, PERSEVERANCE, FORETHOUGHT, CONSIDERATENESS, SECRECY, ORDER,  INSINUATION, ADDRESS, PRESENCE OF MIND, QUICKNESS OF CONCEPTION,  FACILITY OF EXPRESSION, these, and a thousand more of the same kind, no  man will ever deny to be excellencies and perfections. As their merit  consists in their tendency to serve the person, possessed of them,  without any magnificent claim to public and social desert, we are the  less jealous of their pretensions, and readily admit them into the  catalogue of laudable qualities. We are not sensible that, by this  concession, we have paved the way for all the other moral excellencies,  and cannot consistently hesitate any longer, with regard to  disinterested benevolence, patriotism, and humanity.    It seems, indeed, certain, that first appearances are here, as usual,  extremely deceitful, and that it is more difficult, in a speculative  way, to resolve into self-love the merit which we ascribe to the selfish  virtues above mentioned, than that even of the social virtues, justice  and beneficence. For this latter purpose, we need but say, that whatever  conduct promotes the good of the community is loved, praised, and  esteemed by the community, on account of that utility and interest, of  which every one partakes; and though this affection and regard be,  in reality, gratitude, not self-love, yet a distinction, even of this  obvious nature, may not readily be made by superficial reasoners; and  there is room, at least, to support the cavil and dispute for a moment.  But as qualities, which tend only to the utility of their possessor,  without any reference to us, or to the community, are yet esteemed and  valued; by what theory or system can we account for this sentiment from  self-love, or deduce it from that favourite origin? There seems here a  necessity for confessing that the happiness and misery of others are not  spectacles entirely indifferent to us; but that the view of the former,  whether in its causes or effects, like sunshine or the prospect  of well-cultivated plains (to carry our pretensions no higher),  communicates a secret joy and satisfaction; the appearance of the  latter, like a lowering cloud or barren landscape, throws a melancholy  damp over the imagination. And this concession being once made, the  difficulty is over; and a natural unforced interpretation of the  phenomena of human life will afterwards, we may hope, prevail among all  speculative enquirers.        PART II.        It may not be improper, in this place, to examine the influence of  bodily endowments, and of the goods of fortune, over our sentiments of  regard and esteem, and to consider whether these phenomena fortify  or weaken the present theory. It will naturally be expected, that the  beauty of the body, as is supposed by all ancient moralists, will be  similar, in some respects, to that of the mind; and that every kind  of esteem, which is paid to a man, will have something similar in  its origin, whether it arise from his mental endowments, or from the  situation of his exterior circumstances.    It is evident, that one considerable source of BEAUTY in all animals  is the advantage which they reap from the particular structure of their  limbs and members, suitably to the particular manner of life, to which  they are by nature destined. The just proportions of a horse, described  by Xenophon and Virgil, are the same that are received at this day by  our modern jockeys; because the foundation of them is the same, namely,  experience of what is detrimental or useful in the animal.    Broad shoulders, a lank belly, firm joints, taper legs; all these are  beautiful in our species, because signs of force and vigour. Ideas of  utility and its contrary, though they do not entirely determine what is  handsome or deformed, are evidently the source of a considerable part of  approbation or dislike.    In ancient times, bodily strength and dexterity, being of greater USE  and importance in war, was also much more esteemed and valued, than  at present. Not to insist on Homer and the poets, we may observe,  that historians scruple not to mention FORCE OF BODY among the other  accomplishments even of Epaminondas, whom they acknowledge to be the  greatest hero, statesman, and general of all the Greeks. [Footnote: CUM  ALACRIBUS, SALTU; CUMM VELOCIBUS, CURSU; CUM VALIDIS RECTE CERTABATA.  Sallust apud Veget.] A like praise is given to Pompey, one of the  greatest of the Romans. [Footnote: Diodorus Siculus, lib. xv. It may  be improper to give the character of Epaminondas, as drawn by the  historian, in order to show the idea of perfect merit, which prevailed  in those ages. In other illustrious men, say he, you will observe, that  each possessed some one shining quality, which was the foundation of his  fame: In Epaminondas all the VIRTUES are found united; force of body.  eloquence of expression, vigour of mind, contempt of riches, gentleness  of disposition, and what is chiefly to be regarded, courage and conduct  of war.] This instance is similar to what we observed above with regard  to memory.    What derision and contempt, with both sexes, attend IMPOTENCE; while the  unhappy object is regarded as one deprived of so capital a pleasure in  life, and at the same time, as disabled from communicating it to others.  BARRENNESS in women, being also a species of INUTILITY, is a reproach,  but not in the same degree: of which the reason is very obvious,  according to the present theory.    There is no rule in painting or statuary more indispensible than that of  balancing the figures, and placing them with the greatest exactness on  their proper centre of gravity. A figure, which is not justly balanced,  is ugly; because it conveys the disagreeable ideas of fall, harm, and  pain.        [Footenote: All men are equally liable to pain and disease and sickness;  and may again recover health and ease. These circumstances, as they make  no distinction between one man and another, are no source of pride or  humility, regard or contempt. But comparing our own species to superior  ones, it is a very mortifying consideration, that we should all be so  liable to diseases and infirmities; and divines accordingly employ this  topic, in order to depress self-conceit and vanity. They would have more  success, if the common bent of our thoughts were not perpetually turned  to compare ourselves with others.       The infirmities of old age are mortifying; because a comparison with  the young may take place. The king's evil is industriously concealed,  because it affects others, and is often transmitted to posterity. The  case is nearly the same with such diseases as convey any nauseous or  frightful images; the epilepsy, for instance, ulcers, sores, scabs, &c.]        A disposition or turn of mind, which qualifies a man to rise in the  world and advance his fortune, is entitled to esteem and regard, as has  already been explained. It may, therefore, naturally be supposed, that  the"]]]
