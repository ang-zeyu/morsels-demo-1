[1] Where George Gifford, who wrote a little later on the subject, was  also a student.    [2] _Discoverie of Witchcraft_, Nicholson ed., introd., xxxv.    [3] That at least a part of it was written in 1583 appears from his own  words, where he speaks of the treatise of Leonardus Vairus on  fascination as \"now this present yeare 1583 newlie published,\" _ibid._,  124.    [4] Elizabeth Barton (1506-1534) suffered from a nervous derangement  which developed into a religious mania. She was taught by some monks,  and then professed to be in communion with the Virgin Mary and performed  miracles at stated times. She denounced Henry VIII's divorce and gained  wide recognition as a champion of the queen and the Catholic church. She  was granted interviews by Archbishop Warham, by Thomas More, and by  Wolsey. She was finally induced by Cranmer to make confession, was  compelled publicly to repeat her confession in various places, and was  then executed; see _Dict. Nat. Biog._    [5] Illegitimate child.    [6] That is, very probably, Alice Norrington, the mother of Mildred.    [7] _Discoverie of Witchcraft_, 130.    [8] _Ibid._, 132.    [9] See _The discloysing of a late counterfeyted possession by the devyl  in two maydens within the Citie of London_; see also Holinshed,  _Chronicles_, ed. of 1807-1808, IV, 325, and John Stow, _Annals ... of  England_ (London, 1615), 678.    [10] _Discoverie of Witchcraft_, 258, 259.    [11] The spot she chose for concealing the token of guilt had been  previously searched.    [12] For another see _Discoverie of Witchcraft_, 132-133.    [13] In his prefatory epistle \"to the Readers.\"    [14] An incidental reference to Weyer in \"W. W.'s\" account of the  _Witches taken at St. Oses_ is interesting: \"... whom a learned  Phisitian is not ashamed to avouche innocent, and the Judges that  denounce sentence of death against them no better than hangmen.\"    [15] _E. g., Discoverie of Witchcraft_, 5.    [16] _Ibid._, 466-469.    [17] _Ibid._, 5-6.    [18] _Ibid._, 15: \"Howbeit you shall understand that few or none are  throughlie persuaded, resolved, or satisfied, that witches can indeed  accomplish all these impossibilities; but some one is bewitched in one  point, and some is coosened in another, untill in fine, all these  impossibilities, and manie mo, are by severall persons affirmed to be  true.\"    [19] _Discoverie_, 472.    [20] _Ibid._, 7-8.    [21] _Ibid._, 8.    [22] It was one of the points made by \"witchmongers\" that the existence  of laws against witches proved there were witches. This argument was  used by Sir Matthew Hale as late as 1664. Scot says on that point: \"Yet  I confesse, the customes and lawes almost of all nations doo declare,  that all these miraculous works ... were attributed to the power of  witches. The which lawes, with the executions and judicials thereupon,  and the witches confessions, have beguiled almost the whole world.\"  _Ibid._, 220.    [23] _Discoverie_, 471, 472.    [24] _Ibid._, 512.    [25] _Ibid._, 303.    [26] Thomas Nash in his _Four Letters Confuted_ (London, 1593) refers to  it in a non-committal way as a work treating of \"the diverse natures and  properties of Divels and Spirits.\" Gabriel Harvey's _Pierces  Supererogation_ (London, 1593), has the following mention of it:  \"Scottes discoovery of Witchcraft dismasketh sundry egregious  impostures, and in certaine principall chapters, and special passages,  hitteth the nayle on the head with a witnesse; howsoever I could have  wished he had either dealt somewhat more curteously with Monsieur  Bodine, or confuted him somewhat more effectually.\" Professor Burr  informs me that there is in the British Museum (Harleian MSS. 2302) an  incomplete and unpublished reply to Scot. Its handwriting shows it  contemporary or nearly so. It is a series of \"Reasons\" why witches  should be believed in--the MS. in its present state beginning with the  \"5th Reason\" and breaking off in the midst of the 108th.    [27] See Nicholson's opinion on this, pp. xxxvii-xxxix of his  introduction to Scot's book.    [28] George Gifford was a Church of England clergyman whose Puritan  sympathies at length compelled him to identify himself publicly with the  non-conformist movement in 1584. For two years previous to that time he  had held the living of Maldon in Essex.    [29] A second edition of this book appeared in 1603. It was reprinted  for the Percy Society in 1842.    [30] _Dialogue_, ed. of 1603, prefatory letter and L-M 2 verso.    [31] _Discourse_, D 3 verso, G 4 verso; _Dialogue_, ed. of 1603, K 2-K 2  verso, L-L 2. See also _ibid._, K 4-K 4 verso: \"As not long since a  rugged water spaniell having a chaine, came to a mans doore that had a  saut bitch, and some espied him in the darke, and said it was a thing as  bigge as a colt, and had eyes as great as saucers. Hereupon some came to  charge to him, and did charge him in the name of the Father, the Sonne,  and the Holy Ghost, to tell what he was. The dogge at the last told  them, for he spake in his language, and said, bowgh, and thereby they  did know what he was.\"    [32] _Discourse_, in the prefatory letter.    [33] _Ibid._, F 4 verso, F 5.    [34] _Dialogue_, ed of 1603, K 2 verso.    [35] _Ibid._, D 3 verso; _Discourse_, G 3 verso, H 3 verso.    [36] _Ibid._, D 2 verso.    [37] Gifford grew very forceful when he described the progress of a case  against a witch: \"Some woman doth fal out bitterly with her neighbour:  there followeth some great hurt.... There is a suspicion conceived.  Within fewe yeares after shee is in some jarre with an other. Hee is  also plagued. This is noted of all. Great fame is spread of the matter.  Mother W. is a witch.... Wel, mother W. doth begin to bee very odious  and terrible unto many, her neighbours dare say nothing but yet in their  heartes they wish shee were hanged. Shortly after an other falleth sicke  and doth pine.... The neighbors come to visit him. Well neighbour, sayth  one, do ye not suspect some naughty dealing: did yee never anger mother  W? truly neighbour (sayth he) I have not liked the woman a long tyme. I  can not tell how I should displease her, unlesse it were this other day,  my wife prayed her, and so did I, that shee would keepe her hennes out  of my garden. Wee spake her as fayre as wee could for our lives. I  thinke verely she hath bewitched me. Every body sayth now that mother W.  is a witch in deede.... It is out of all doubt: for there were which saw  a weasil runne from her housward into his yard even a little before hee  fell sicke. The sicke man dieth, and taketh it upon his death that he is  bewitched: then is mother W. apprehended, and sent to prison, shee is  arrayned and condemned, and being at the gallows, taketh it uppon her  death that shee is not gylty.\" _Discourse_, G 4-G 4 verso. And so,  Gifford explains, the Devil is pleased, for he has put innocent people  into danger, he has caused witnesses to forswear themselves and jurymen  to render false verdicts.    [38] But his views were warmly seconded by Henry Holland, who in 1590  issued at Cambridge _A Treatise against Witchcraft_. Holland, however,  was chiefly interested in warning \"Masters and Fathers of families that  they may learn the best meanes to purge their houses of all unclean  spirits.\" It goes without saying that he found himself at variance with  Scot, who, he declared, reduced witchcraft to a \"cozening or poisoning  art.\" In the Scriptures he found the evidence that witches have a real  \"confederacie with Satan himself,\" but he was frank to admit that the  proof of bargains of the sort in his own time could not be given.          CHAPTER IV.    THE EXORCISTS.      In the narrative of English witchcraft the story of the exorcists is a  side-issue. Yet their performances were so closely connected with the  operations of the Devil and of his agents that they cannot be left out  of account in any adequate statement of the subject. And it is  impossible to understand the strength and weakness of the superstition  without a comprehension of the role that the would-be agents for  expelling evil spirits played. That the reign which had seen pass in  procession the bands of conjurers and witches should close with the  exorcists was to be expected. It was their part to complete the cycle of  superstition. If miracles of magic were possible, if conjurers could use  a supernatural power of some sort to assist them in performing wonders,  there was nothing very remarkable about creatures who wrought harm to  their fellows through the agency of evil spirits. And if witches could  send evil spirits to do harm, it followed that those spirits could be  expelled or exorcised by divine assistance. If by prayer to the Devil  demons could be commanded to enter human beings, they could be driven  out by prayer to God. The processes of reasoning were perfectly clear;  and they were easily accepted because they found adequate confirmation  in the New Testament. The gospels were full of narratives of men  possessed with evil spirits who had been freed by the invocation of God.  Of these stories no doubt the most quoted and the one most effective in  moulding opinion was the account of the dispossessed devils who had  entered into a herd of swine and plunged over a steep place into the  sea.    It must not be supposed that exorcism was a result of belief in  witchcraft. It was as old as the Christian church. It was still made use  of by the Roman church and, indeed, by certain Protestant groups. And  just at this time the Roman church found it a most important instrument  in the struggle against the reformed religions. In England Romanism was  waging a losing war, and had need of all the miracles that it could  claim in order to reestablish its waning credit. The hunted priests who  were being driven out by Whitgift were not unwilling to resort to a  practice which they hoped would regain for them"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31529"],[0,"Modern marriage and how to bear it (#15)"],[1,"to wait for  freedom.    A writer in another paper cited America as an example of terminable  marriage in full working order. 'It appears from the statement of an  American bishop that the people of the United States are actually living  under Mr Meredith's conditions already. Last year (1903) as many as  600,000 American marriages were dissolved. This means that there was one  divorce to every four marriages. In some districts the proportion was  more like one to two. And the most frequent cause of divorce was a  desire for change!'    It seems to me that the establishment of a leasehold marriage system  would only result in wholesale wretchedness and confusion, beside which  the present sum of marital misery would be but a drop in the ocean. If  our marriage laws must be modified, let us trust it will not be in this  direction, though it is obvious enough that such a change would come as  a boon to thousands of men and women, who from one cause or another have  come to loathe the tie that binds them. Whether it would not also  disturb the prosaic content that passes for happiness with millions more  is too big a question to be more than mentioned here.    The fate of those who are tied for life to lunatics, criminals, and  drunkards is pitiable indeed, but an extension of the laws of divorce  would meet their exceptional case, without disturbing the marriage bond  of normal people. I have endeavoured to indicate some of the many  difficulties of leasehold marriage in the following dialogue.            II      LEASEHOLD MARRIAGE IN PRACTICE    A DIALOGUE IN 1999      'There is one thing that women dread more than celibacy--it is    repudiation.' --MARCEL PREVOST.      _Katharine and Margaret, both attractive women on the borderland of  forty, are lunching together. They are old friends and have not met for  years._    _Margaret._ 'How nice it is to be together again, but I'm sorry to find  you so changed; you don't look happy, what is the trouble?'    _Katharine._ 'I ought to look happy, I've had wonderful luck, but the  truth is, I'm utterly tired. The conditions of marriage nowadays are  horribly wearing, don't you think?'    _M._ 'Well, of course, we miss that feeling of peace and security that  our mothers talked of, but then we also miss that ghastly monotony.  Think of living year after year, thirty, forty, fifty years, with the  same man! How tired one would get of his tempers.'    _K._ 'I'm not so sure of that. Monotony of tempers is better than  variety. All people have them, anyway. Besides, I've a notion that our  fathers were nothing like so difficult to live with as our husbands are.  You see, in the old days they knew they were fixed up for life, and that  acted as a curb. We seem to miss that curb nowadays.'    _M._ 'Yes, there's something in that. I remember my grandmother, who was  married at the end of the last century, used to say that her husband was  her Sheet Anchor, and he called her his Haven of Rest.'    _K._ 'Oh, I envy them! That's what I want so badly--a haven, an anchor!  How peaceful life must have been then before this horrible new system  came in.'    _M._ 'People evidently didn't seem to think so, or why should they have  altered it? But what's your quarrel with the system? You've had four  husbands and changed the first two almost as quickly as the law  allowed.'    _K._ 'Yes, and I'm only forty-one. I began too young--at eighteen--but  one naturally takes marriage lightly when one knows it's only for five  years. One enters upon it as thoughtlessly as our happy mothers used to  start their flirtations.'    _M._ 'The consequences are rather more serious though; we are  disillusioned women at the age when they were still light-hearted  girls.'    _K._ 'It's the families that make it so difficult. Fatherhood is quite a  cult nowadays. All my husbands have been of a philoprogenitive turn, and  I have eight children.'    _M._ 'Eight children! No wonder you look worried.'    _K._ 'Exactly! my mother would have been horrified. Two or three was the  correct number in her days, four at the utmost, and five a fatality and  very rare.'    _M._ 'Well, my dear, you needn't have had so many; you should have  curbed that cult of Fatherhood. No woman is compelled to bear children  nowadays, as our unfortunate grandmothers were. Have you got all eight  with you?'    _K._ 'No, that's just the trouble. I didn't want to have so many, but of  course now I've got them I want them with me, and of course their  fathers want them too.'    _M._ 'Oh dear! how tiresome; that's the worst of having children in  these times. I'm sometimes glad I have none.'    _K._ 'Then perhaps you don't know the law about the children of our  present marriage system? A sum of money has to be invested annually for  each child, in the great State Infant Trust; when the marriage is  dissolved the mother has the sole custody of them, unless the father  wishes to share it; in the latter case they spend half the year with  each parent.'    _M._ 'It's fair.'    _K._ 'I suppose so, but oh! so terribly hard on a mother! My two elder  girls are almost grown up, they've been at a boarding school for some  time, and it was easy and natural enough for George and I to share them  in the holidays, but now, I can't keep them at the school any longer,  and they will have to spend half the year with him. Thank heaven, he  hasn't been married for some time, and isn't likely to again, so I  haven't the horror of a strange woman influencing them, but how can I  guide them? how have any real control or influence over them in such  circumstances?'    _M._ 'Yes, that must be very sad for you.'    _K._ 'It's awful, but there's much worse than that. My second husband,  Gordon, the father of Arthur and Maggie, is married again, and his wife  is jealous of his eldest children, and hates the time when they come to  stay. And my little Arthur is so delicate, he requires ceaseless care  and studying--I never have a happy moment when he is with them; he  doesn't get on well with the other children either, and always returns  from the visits looking ill and wretched. I couldn't tell you all I have  suffered on account of Arthur! Oh! when I think of him, I could curse  this infamous marriage system--it is a sin against nature!'    _M._ 'But, my dear, it's no use abusing the laws. Why didn't you stay  with Gordon, or in the first instance with George? It's often done, even  now.'    _K._ 'I know, I know, but George and I were utterly unsuited--we married  as boy and girl. Under the old system prudent parents generally  intervened, and the young couple were obliged to wait until they were  sure of their own minds. But you know how things are now; in one's first  young infatuation, one is sure of five years ahead at least, and one  doesn't need to look beyond that.'    _M._ 'Well, you were twenty-four when you married Gordon; why didn't you  choose him more carefully?'    _K._ 'That was largely \"a matter of economics\" as I read in an old play  called _Votes for Women_, not long ago--so quaint their ideas were in  those days!--and there was something in it too about \"twenty-four used  not to be so young, but it's become so!\" Still, I was old enough to know  better, but I was light-hearted and luxury-loving, and I couldn't live  on that pittance, which was all the law compelled George to allow me.  I don't blame him, it was all he could do to save the necessary tax for  the children. So I married Gordon for a home, and of course it was  hateful!'    _M._ 'And your third husband died?'    _K._ 'Yes; the one who should have lived generally dies. I lost him  after two years only, but I can't talk of him, dear; he was just my Man  of Men.'    _M._ 'Ah! I'm glad you have had that.'    _K._ 'Oh! I have been lucky with all my troubles, as I told you. I was  alone for four years after I lost my Best, and I should like to have  been faithful to him for ever. But I wasn't strong enough; in spite of  the dear children I was very lonely, as the elder ones were always at  school.'    _M._ 'Yes, and one wants a man, somehow, to fuss round one.'    _K._ 'True, it's a fatal weakness. So at last I married my good little  Duncan, just for companionship. I chose _him_ carefully enough.  Experience has taught me a lot, and I didn't mean to be left in the  lurch at forty as so many are.'    _M._ 'I'm glad he's good to you. Yes; it's fearful how many women get  left alone just when they need care and love most, when their looks and  freshness are gone, and their energy weakened. But, as you haven't got  that to fear, why should you be so worried now?'    _K._ 'It isn't exactly that I'm worried--I'm used up! Twenty years of  uncertain domestic arrangements is enough to wear out anyone. I've never  been able to feel settled in any house, or let myself get attached to a  place, or plant out a garden even. One's set of friends is always  breaking up; people never seem to buy houses and estates now, or to get  rooted anywhere. In the novels of fifty years ago, how they used to  complain about being in a groove! They little knew how miserable life  could be for want of a permanent groove.'    _M._ 'I dislike monotony, but it certainly has its advantages. You  remember my first husband, Dick?--such a good-looking boy--he was crazy  about golf and outdoor games. I got quite into his way of living, and it  was a great trial when I married Cecil Innes, who hated the open air,  and cared only for books and grubbing about in museums.'    _K._ 'Why did you leave Dick?'    _M._ 'I didn't really want to, we were very comfy together, but he fell  in love with another woman. He was mad about her, and asked me to  release him. As I had no children, I thought it only fair to agree.  Cecil interested me very much at first, and he adored me, but I had a  very dreary time with him. You know I'm not a bit literary, and he was  so \"precious\" and bookish, he bored me to death. I was glad to leave him "]]]
