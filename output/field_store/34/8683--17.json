[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4352"],[0,"Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic (#15)"],[1,"on to my  terrace?\" The neighbour retorts, \"What do you mean by putting your  terrace under my pipe?\" There is no necessity to dwell upon this kind  of wit, instances of which could easily be multiplied. The RECIPROCAL  INTERFERENCE of two sets of ideas in the same sentence is an  inexhaustible source of amusing varieties. There are many ways of  bringing about this interference, I mean of bracketing in the same  expression two independent meanings that apparently tally. The least  reputable of these ways is the pun. In the pun, the same sentence  appears to offer two independent meanings, but it is only an  appearance; in reality there are two different sentences made up of  different words, but claiming to be one and the same because both have  the same sound. We pass from the pun, by imperceptible stages, to the  true play upon words. Here there is really one and the same sentence  through which two different sets of ideas are expressed, and we are  confronted with only one series of words; but advantage is taken of the  different meanings a word may have, especially when used figuratively  instead of literally. So that in fact there is often only a slight  difference between the play upon words on the one hand, and a poetic  metaphor or an illuminating comparison on the other. Whereas an  illuminating comparison and a striking image always seem to reveal the  close harmony that exists between language and nature, regarded as two  parallel forms of life, the play upon words makes us think somehow of a  negligence on the part of language, which, for the time being, seems to  have forgotten its real function and now claims to accommodate things  to itself instead of accommodating itself to things. And so the play  upon words always betrays a momentary LAPSE OF ATTENTION in language,  and it is precisely on that account that it is amusing.    INVERSION and RECIPROCAL INTERFERENCE, after all, are only a certain  playfulness of the mind which ends at playing upon words. The comic in  TRANSPOSITION is much more far-reaching. Indeed, transposition is to  ordinary language what repetition is to comedy.    We said that repetition is the favourite method of classic comedy. It  consists in so arranging events that a scene is reproduced either  between the same characters under fresh circumstances or between fresh  characters under the same circumstances. Thus we have, repeated by  lackeys in less dignified language, a scene already played by their  masters. Now, imagine ideas expressed in suitable style and thus placed  in the setting of their natural environment. If you think of some  arrangement whereby they are transferred to fresh surroundings, while  maintaining their mutual relations, or, in other words, if you can  induce them to express themselves in an altogether different style and  to transpose themselves into another key, you will have language itself  playing a comedy--language itself made comic. There will be no need,  moreover, actually to set before us both expressions of the same ideas,  the transposed expression and the natural one. For we are acquainted  with the natural one--the one which we should have chosen  instinctively. So it will be enough if the effort of comic invention  bears on the other, and on the other alone. No sooner is the second set  before us than we spontaneously supply the first. Hence the following  general rule: A COMIC EFFECT IS ALWAYS OBTAINABLE BY TRANSPOSING THE  NATURE EXPRESSION OF AN IDEA INTO ANOTHER KEY.    The means of transposition are so many and varied, language affords so  rich a continuity of themes and the comic is here capable of passing  through so great a number of stages, from the most insipid buffoonery  up to the loftiest forms of humour and irony, that we shall forego the  attempt to make out a complete list. Having stated the rule, we will  simply, here and there, verify its main applications.    In the first place, we may distinguish two keys at the extreme ends of  the scale, the solemn and the familiar. The most obvious effects are  obtained by merely transposing the one into the other, which thus  provides us with two opposite currents of comic fancy.    Transpose the solemn into the familiar and the result is parody. The  effect of parody, thus defined, extends to instances in which the idea  expressed in familiar terms is one that, if only in deference to  custom, ought to be pitched in another key. Take as an example the  following description of the dawn, quoted by Jean Paul Richter: \"The  sky was beginning to change from black to red, like a lobster being  boiled.\" Note that the expression of old-world matters in terms of  modern life produces the same effect, by reason of the halo of poetry  which surrounds classical antiquity.    It is doubtless the comic in parody that has suggested to some  philosophers, and in particular to Alexander Bain, the idea of defining  the comic, in general, as a species of DEGRADATION. They describe the  laughable as causing something to appear mean that was formerly  dignified. But if our analysis is correct, degradation is only one form  of transposition, and transposition itself only one of the means of  obtaining laughter. There is a host of others, and the source of  laughter must be sought for much further back. Moreover, without going  so far, we see that while the transposition from solemn to trivial,  from better to worse, is comic, the inverse transposition may be even  more so.    It is met with as often as the other, and, apparently, we may  distinguish two main forms of it, according as it refers to the  PHYSICAL DIMENSIONS of an object or to its MORAL VALUE.    To speak of small things as though they were large is, in a general  way, TO EXAGGERATE. Exaggeration is always comic when prolonged, and  especially when systematic; then, indeed, it appears as one method of  transposition. It excites so much laughter that some writers have been  led to define the comic as exaggeration, just as others have defined it  as degradation. As a matter of fact, exaggeration, like degradation, is  only one form of one kind of the comic. Still, it is a very striking  form. It has given birth to the mock-heroic poem, a rather  old-fashioned device, I admit, though traces of it are still to be  found in persons inclined to exaggerate methodically. It might often be  said of braggadocio that it is its mock-heroic aspect which makes us  laugh.    Far more artificial, but also far more refined, is the transposition  upwards from below when applied to the moral value of things, not to  their physical dimensions. To express in reputable language some  disreputable idea, to take some scandalous situation, some low-class  calling or disgraceful behaviour, and describe them in terms of the  utmost \"RESPECTABILITY,\" is generally comic. The English word is here  purposely employed, as the practice itself is characteristically  English. Many instances of it may be found in Dickens and Thackeray,  and in English literature generally. Let us remark, in passing, that  the intensity of the effect does not here depend on its length. A word  is sometimes sufficient, provided it gives us a glimpse of an entire  system of transposition accepted in certain social circles and reveals,  as it were, a moral organisation of immorality. Take the following  remark made by an official to one of his subordinates in a novel of  Gogol's, \"Your peculations are too extensive for an official of your  rank.\"    Summing up the foregoing, then, there are two extreme terms of  comparison, the very large and the very small, the best and the worst,  between which transposition may be effected in one direction or the  other. Now, if the interval be gradually narrowed, the contrast between  the terms obtained will be less and less violent, and the varieties of  comic transposition more and more subtle.    The most common of these contrasts is perhaps that between the real and  the ideal, between what is and what ought to be. Here again  transposition may take place in either direction. Sometimes we state  what ought to be done, and pretend to believe that this is just what is  actually being done; then we have IRONY. Sometimes, on the contrary, we  describe with scrupulous minuteness what is being done, and pretend to  believe that this is just what ought to be done; such is often the  method of HUMOUR. Humour, thus denned, is the counterpart of irony.  Both are forms of satire, but irony is oratorical in its nature, whilst  humour partakes of the scientific. Irony is emphasised the higher we  allow ourselves to be uplifted by the idea of the good that ought to  be: thus irony may grow so hot within us that it becomes a kind of  high-pressure eloquence. On the other hand, humour is the more  emphasised the deeper we go down into an evil that actually is, in  order t o set down its details in the most cold-blooded indifference.  Several authors, Jean Paul amongst them, have noticed that humour  delights in concrete terms, technical details, definite facts. If our  analysis is correct, this is not an accidental trait of humour, it is  its very essence. A humorist is a moralist disguised as a scientist,  something like an anatomist who practises dissection with the sole  object of filling us with disgust; so that humour, in the restricted  sense in which we are here regarding the word, is really a  transposition from the moral to the scientific.    By still further curtailing the interval between the terms transposed,  we may now obtain more and more specialised types of comic  transpositions. Thus, certain professions have a technical vocabulary:  what a wealth of laughable results have been obtained by transposing  the ideas of everyday life into this professional jargon! Equally comic  is the extension of business phraseology to the social relations of  life,--for instance, the phrase of one of Labiche's characters in  allusion to an invitation he has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4357"],[0,"American Fairy Tales (#15)"],[1," every penny we  possessed.\"    \"I'm sorry,\" returned the beetle; \"but it is your own fault. Had you  not made so great a show of your wealth no one would have suspected  you possessed a treasure, or thought to rob you. As it is, you have  merely lost the gold which others have lost before you. It will  probably be lost many times more before the world comes to an end.\"    \"But what are we to do now?\" she asked.    \"What did you do before I gave you the money?\"    \"We worked from morning 'til night,\" said she.    \"Then work still remains for you,\" remarked the beetle, composedly;  \"no one will ever try to rob you of that, you may be sure!\" And he  slid from the stone and disappeared for the last time.    * * * * *    This story should teach us to accept good fortune with humble hearts  and to use it with moderation. For, had the farmer and his wife  resisted the temptation to display their wealth ostentatiously, they  might have retained it to this very day.          THE DUMMY THAT LIVED      In all Fairyland there is no more mischievous a person than  Tanko-Mankie the Yellow Ryl. He flew through the city one  afternoon--quite invisible to moral eyes, but seeing everything  himself--and noticed a figure of a wax lady standing behind the big  plate glass window of Mr. Floman's department store.    The wax lady was beautifully dressed, and extended in her stiff left  hand was a card bearing the words:        \"RARE BARGIN!      This Stylish Costume      (Imported from Paris)      Former Price, $20,      REDUCED TO ONLY $19.98.\"    This impressive announcement had drawn before the window a crowd of  women shoppers, who stood looking at the wax lady with critical  eyes.    Tanko-Mankie laughed to himself the low, gurgling little laugh that  always means mischief. Then he flew close to the wax figure and  breathed twice upon its forehead.    From that instant the dummy began to live, but so dazed and  astonished was she at the unexpected sensation that she continued to  stand stupidly staring at the women outside and holding out the  placard as before.    The ryl laughed again and flew away. Anyone but Tanko-Mankie would  have remained to help the wax lady out of the troubles that were  sure to overtake her; but this naughty elf thought it rare fun to  turn the inexperienced lady loose in a cold and heartless world and  leave her to shift for herself.    Fortunately it was almost six o'clock when the dummy first realized  that she was alive, and before she had collected her new thoughts  and decided what to do a man came around and drew down all the  window shades, shutting off the view from the curious shoppers.    Then the clerks and cashiers and floorwalkers and cash girls went  home and the store was closed for the night, although the sweepers  and scrubbers remained to clean the floors for the following day.    The window inhabited by the wax lady was boxed in, like a little  room, one small door being left at the side for the window-trimmer  to creep in and out of. So the scrubbers never noticed that the  dummy, when left to herself, dropped the placard to the floor and  sat down upon a pile of silks to wonder who she was, where she was,  and how she happened to be alive.    For you must consider, dear reader, that in spite of her size and  her rich costume, in spite of her pink cheeks and fluffy yellow  hair, this lady was very young--no older, in reality, than a baby  born but half an hour. All she knew of the world was contained in  the glimpse she had secured of the busy street facing her window;  all she knew of people lay in the actions of the group of women  which had stood before her on the other side of the window pane and  criticised the fit of her dress or remarked upon its stylish  appearance.    So she had little enough to think about, and her thoughts moved  somewhat slowly; yet one thing she really decided upon, and that was  not to remain in the window and be insolently stared at by a lot of  women who were not nearly so handsome or well dressed as herself.    By the time she reached this important conclusion, it was after  midnight; but dim lights were burning in the big, deserted store, so  she crept through the door of her window and walked down the long  aisles, pausing now and then to look with much curiosity at the  wealth of finery confronting her on every side.    When she came to the glass cases filled with trimmed hats she  remembered having seen upon the heads of the women in the street  similar creations. So she selected one that suited her fancy and  placed it carefully upon her yellow locks. I won't attempt to  explain what instinct it was that made her glance into a near-by  mirror to see if the hat was straight, but this she certainly did.  It didn't correspond with her dress very well, but the poor thing  was too young to have much taste in matching colors.    When she reached the glove counter she remembered that gloves were  also worn by the women she had seen. She took a pair from the case  and tried to fit them upon her stiff, wax-coated fingers; but the  gloves were too small and ripped in the seams. Then she tried  another pair, and several others, as well; but hours passed before  she finally succeeded in getting her hands covered with a pair of  pea-green kids.    Next she selected a parasol from a large and varied assortment in  the rear of the store. Not that she had any idea what it was used  for; but other ladies carried such things, so she also would have  one.    When she again examined herself critically in the mirror she decided  her outfit was now complete, and to her inexperienced eyes there was  no perceptible difference between her and the women who had stood  outside the window. Whereupon she tried to leave the store, but  found every door fast locked.    The wax lady was in no hurry. She inherited patience from her  previous existence. Just to be alive and to wear beautiful clothes  was sufficient enjoyment for her at present. So she sat down upon a  stool and waited quietly until daylight.    When the janitor unlocked the door in the morning the wax lady swept  past him and walked with stiff but stately strides down the street.  The poor fellow was so completely whuckered at seeing the well-known  wax lady leave her window and march away from the store that he fell  over in a heap and only saved himself from fainting by striking his  funny bone against the doorstep. When he recovered his wits she had  turned the corner and disappeared.    The wax lady's immature mind had reasoned that, since she had come  to life, her evident duty was to mix with the world and do whatever  other folks did. She could not realize how different she was from  people of flesh and blood; nor did she know she was the first dummy  that had ever lived, or that she owed her unique experience to  Tanko-Mankie's love of mischief. So ignorance gave her a confidence  in herself that she was not justly entitled to.    It was yet early in the day, and the few people she met were  hurrying along the streets. Many of them turned into restaurants and  eating houses, and following their example the wax lady also entered  one and sat upon a stool before a lunch counter.    \"Coffee 'n' rolls!\" said a shop girl on the next stool.    \"Coffee 'n' rolls!\" repeated the dummy, and soon the waiter placed  them before her. Of course she had no appetite, as her constitution,  being mostly wood, did not require food; but she watched the shop  girl, and saw her put the coffee to her mouth and drink it.  Therefore the wax lady did the same, and the next instant was  surprised to feel the hot liquid trickling out between her wooden  ribs. The coffee also blistered her wax lips, and so disagreeable  was the experience that she arose and left the restaurant, paying no  attention to the demands of the waiter for \"20 cents, mum.\" Not that  she intended to defraud him, but the poor creature had no idea what  he meant by \"20 cents, mum.\"    As she came out she met the window trimmer at Floman's store. The  man was rather near-sighted, but seeing something familiar in the  lady's features he politely raised his hat. The wax lady also raised  her hat, thinking it the proper thing to do, and the man hurried  away with a horrified face.    Then a woman touched her arm and said:    \"Beg pardon, ma'am; but there's a price-mark hanging on your dress  behind.\"    \"Yes, I know,\" replied the wax lady, stiffly; \"it was originally  $20, but it's been reduced to $19.98.\"    The woman looked surprised at such indifference and walked on. Some  carriages were standing at the edge of the sidewalk, and seeing the  dummy hesitate a driver approached her and touched his cap.    \"Cab, ma'am?\" he asked.    \"No,\" said she, misunderstanding him; \"I'm wax.\"    \"Oh!\" he exclaimed, and looked after her wonderingly.    \"Here's yer mornin' paper!\" yelled a newsboy.    \"Mine, did you say?\" she asked.    \"Sure! Chronicle, 'Quirer, R'public 'n' 'Spatch! Wot'll ye 'ave?\"    \"What are they for?\" inquired the wax lady, simply.    \"W'y, ter read, o' course. All the news, you know.\"    She shook her head and glanced at a paper.    \"It looks all speckled and mixed up,\" she said. \"I'm afraid I can't  read.\"    \"Ever ben to school?\" asked the boy, becoming interested.    \"No; what's school?\" she inquired.    The boy gave her an indignant look.    \"Say!\" he cried, \"ye'r just a dummy, that's wot ye are!\" and ran  away to seek a more promising customer.    \"I wonder that he means,\" thought the poor lady. \"Am I really  different in some way from all the others? I look like them,  certainly; and I try to act like them; yet that boy called me a  dummy and seemed to think I acted queerly.\"    This idea worried her a little, but she walked on to the corner,  where she noticed a street car stop to let some people on. The wax  lady, still determined to do as others did, also boarded the car and  sat down quietly in a corner.    After riding a few blocks the"]]]
