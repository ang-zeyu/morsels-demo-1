I wish I could make apparent how difficult a thing it was to get  supplies from our ship to the shore in a surf which, after ten o'clock  in the morning, allowed no small boats to touch even the bit of a pier  that was run out without breaking either the one or the other, and  nothing in the form of a lighter save two dilapidated flat-boat  pontoons. These had been broken and cast away by the engineer corps,  picked up by ourselves, mended by the Cubans, and put in condition to  float alongside of our ship, and receive perhaps three or four tons of  material. This must then be rowed or floated out to the shore, run onto  the sand as far as possible, the men jumping into the water from knee to  waist deep, pulling the boat up from the surf, and getting the material  on land. And this was what was meant by loading the \"seized wagons from  the front\" and getting food to the wounded. After ten o'clock in the day  even this was impossible, and we must wait until the calm of three  o'clock next morning to commence work again and go through the same  struggle to get something to load the wagons for that day. Our supplies  had been gotten ashore, and among the last, rocking and tossing in our  little boat, went ourselves, landing on the pier, which by that time was  breaking in two, escaping a surf which every other moment threatened to  envelop one from feet to head, we reached the land.    Our \"seized\" wagons had already gone on, loaded with our best hospital  supplies--meal, flour, condensed milk, malted milk, tea, coffee, sugar,  dried fruits, canned fruits, canned meats, and such other things as we  had been able to get out in the haste of packing--entirely filling the  two wagons already in advance.    An ambulance had been spoken of. We waited a little while by the  roadside, but the ambulance did not appear. Then, halting a wagon loaded  with bales of hay, we begged a ride of the driver, and our little party,  Dr. and Mrs. Gardner, James McDowell, and myself, took our seats on the  hay and made our way to the front, Dr. Hubbell following afoot. Four  hours' ride brought us to the First Division Hospital of the Fifth Army  Corps--General Shafter's headquarters.    The sight that met us on going into the so-called hospital grounds was  something indescribable. The land was perfectly level; no drainage  whatever; covered with long, tangled grass; skirted by trees, brush,  and shrubbery; a few little dog-tents not much larger than could have  been made of an ordinary table-cloth thrown over a short rail, and under  these lay huddled together the men fresh from the field or from the  operating-tables, with no covering over them save such as had clung to  them through their troubles, and in the majority of cases no blanket  under them.    Those who had come from the tables, having been compelled to leave all  the clothing they had, as too wet, muddy, and bloody to be retained,  were entirely nude, lying on the stubble grass, the sun fitfully dealing  with them, sometimes clouding over and again streaming out in a blaze  above them. Fortunately, among our supplies were some bolts of  unbleached cotton, and this we cut in sheet lengths, and the men of our  party went about and covered the poor fellows, who lay there with no  shelter either from the elements or the eyes of the passers-by.    A half dozen bricks laid about a yard apart, a couple of pieces of  wagon-tire laid across these, so low and so near the ground that no fire  of any strength or benefit could be made--the bits of wet wood put  under crosswise, with the smoke streaming a foot out on either side, two  kettles of coffee or soup, and a small frying-pan with some meat in  it--appeared to be the cook-house for these men. They told us there were  about eight hundred men under the tents and lying in the grass, and more  constantly coming in.    After a few moments' consultation as to the best methods to be pursued,  we too gathered stones and bricks and constructed a longer, higher  fireplace, got more wagon-tires, found the water, and soon our great  agate kettles of seven and ten gallons were filled.    The rain, that had been drizzling more or less all day, increased. Our  supplies were taken from the wagons, a piece of tarpaulin found to  protect them, and as the fire began to blaze and the water to heat, Mrs.  Gardner and I found the way into the bags and boxes of flour, salt,  milk, and meal, and got material for the first gallons of gruel. I had  not thought to ever make gruel again over a camp-fire. I can not say how  far it carried me back in the lapse of time, or really where, or who I  felt that I was.    It did not seem to be me, and still I seemed to know how to do it.    When the bubbling contents of our kettle thickened and grew white with  the condensed milk, and we began to give it out--putting it into the  hands of men detailed as nurses, and our own men, to take around to the  poor sufferers, shivering and naked in the rain--I felt that perhaps it  was not in vain that history had repeated itself. When the nurses came  back and told us of the surprise with which it was received, and the  tears that rolled down the sun-burned, often bloody face, into the cup  as the poor fellow drank his hot gruel, and asked where it came from,  who sent it, and said it was the first food he had tasted in three days  (for they had gone into the fight hungry), I felt that it was again the  same old story and wondered what gain there had been in the last thirty  years.    The fires burned, the gruel steamed and boiled--bucket after bucket went  out--until those eight hundred men had each a cup of gruel and knew that  he could have another and as many as he wanted. The day waned, the  darkness came, and still the men were unsheltered, uncovered, naked,  and wet--scarcely a groan, no word of complaint--no man said he was not  well treated.    The operating-tables were full of the wounded. Man after man was taken  off, brought on his litter and laid beside other men, and something  given him to keep the little life in his body that seemed fast oozing  out. All night it went on. It grew cold--for naked men bitter  cold--before morning. We had no blankets, nothing to cover them, only  the strips of cotton cloth.    Early in the morning ambulances started, and such of the wounded as  could be loaded in were taken to be carried back over that rough,  pitiless road, down to Siboney, to the hospitals there--that we had done  the best we could toward fitting up--where our hundred cots, hundred and  fifty blankets had gone, cups, spoons, and delicacies, that would help  to strengthen these poor, fainting men, if they could get there, and  where also the Sisters would care for them.    They brought man after man, stretcher after stretcher, to the waiting  ambulances, and they took out seventeen who had died in the night,  unattended, save by the nurse.    More supplies arrived, and this time came large tarpaulins, more  utensils, more food, and more things to make it a little comfortable. We  removed our first kitchens across the road, up alongside the headquarter  tent of Major Wood, in charge of the camp. Words can not do justice to  his kind-hearted generosity. He strove in every way to do all that could  be done, and the night before had given us a small tent in which we had  huddled from the pouring rain, for a couple of hours, in the middle of  the night, the water rushing through like a rivulet.    The tarpaulins were put over supplies, a new fireplace made near  us--magnificent in its dimensions--shelter given for boxes and barrels  that by this time had accumulated about us, and there was even something  that looked like a table, on which Mrs. Gardner prepared her delicacies.    Early in the day there came to our improvised headquarters an officer in  khaki uniform showing hard service, and a bandanna handkerchief hanging  from his hat, to protect the back of his head and neck from the fierce  rays of the sun.    It was Colonel Roosevelt, and we were very glad to meet the gallant  leader of the \"Rough Riders.\" After a few moments conversation he said:    \"I have some sick men with the regiment who refuse to leave it. They  need such delicacies as you have here, which I am ready to pay for out  of my own pocket. Can I buy them from the Red Cross?\"    \"Not for a million dollars,\" Dr. Gardner replied.    \"But my men need these things,\" he said, his tone and face expressing  anxiety. \"I think a great deal of my men. I am proud of them.\"    \"And we know they are proud of you, Colonel. But we can't sell Red Cross  supplies,\" answered Dr. Gardner.    \"Then, how can I get them? I must have proper food for my sick men,\" he  said.    \"Just ask for them, Colonel,\" replied Dr. Gardner.    \"Oh,\" he said, his face suddenly lighting up with a bright smile; \"then  I do ask for them.\"    \"All right, Colonel; what is your list?\"    The list included malted milk, condensed milk, oatmeal, cornmeal, canned  fruits, dried fruits, rice, tea, chocolate, and even prepared beefsteak  and vegetables, and other things good for men who could not eat army  rations.    \"Now, Colonel, when will you send for these supplies?\" asked Dr.  Gardner. \"They will be ready any time.\"    \"Lend me a sack and I'll take them right along,\" he answered with  characteristic decision.    Mrs. Gardner at once looked up a sack, and when filled it must have held  a good many pounds of supplies. Before we had recovered from our  surprise, the incident was closed by the future President of the United  States slinging the big sack over his shoulders, striding off, and out  of sight through the jungle.    The gruel still remained the staple, but malted milk, chocolate, rice,  and tea had come in, and little by little various things were added by  which our _menage_ quite resembled a hotel.

Hundreds, thousands of tails slapped the  water at the same instant and were gone.    When the passenger pigeons were numbered by millions, the enormous  clans used to migrate from one part of the continent to another. I saw  the last flight of them up the Hudson River valley in the spring of  1875. All day they streamed across the sky. One purpose seemed to  animate every flock and every bird. It was as if all had orders to  move to the same point. The pigeons came only when there was  beech-mast in the woods. How did they know we had had a beech-nut  year? It is true that a few straggling bands were usually seen some  days in advance of the blue myriads: were these the scouts, and did  they return with the news of the beech-nuts? If so, how did they  communicate the intelligence and set the whole mighty army in motion?    The migrations among the four-footed animals that sometimes occur over  a large, part of the country--among the rats, the gray squirrels, the  reindeer of the north--seem to be of a similar character. How does  every individual come to share in the common purpose? An army of men  attempting to move without leaders and without a written or spoken  language becomes a disorganized mob. Not so the animals. There seems  to be a community of mind among them in a sense that there is not  among men. The pressure of great danger seems to develop in a degree  this community of mind and feeling among men. Under strong excitement  we revert more or less to the animal state, and are ruled by instinct.  It may well be that telepathy--the power to project one's mental or  emotional state so as to impress a friend at a distance--is a power  which we have carried over from our remote animal ancestors. However  this may be, it is certain that the sensitiveness of birds and  quadrupeds to the condition of one another, their sense of a common  danger, of food supplies, of the direction of home under all  circumstances, point to the possession of a power which is only  rudimentary in us.    Some observers explain these things on the theory that the flocks of  birds have leaders, and that their surprising evolutions are guided by  calls or signals from these leaders, too quick or too fine for our  eyes or ears to catch. I suppose they would explain the movements of  the schools of fish and the simultaneous movements of a large number  of land animals on the same theory. I cannot accept this explanation.  It is harder for me to believe that a flock of birds has a code of  calls or signals for all its evolutions--now right, now left, now  mount, now swoop--which each individual understands on the instant, or  that the hosts of the wild pigeons had their captains and signals,  than to believe that out of the flocking instinct there has grown some  other instinct or faculty, less understood, but equally potent, that  puts all the members of a flock in such complete rapport with one  another that the purpose and the desire of one become the purpose and  the desire of all. There is nothing in this state of things analogous  to a military organization. The relation among the members of the  flock is rather that of creatures sharing spontaneously the same  subconscious or psychic state, and acted upon by the same hidden  influence, in a way and to a degree that never occur among men.    The faculty or power by which animals find the way home over or across  long stretches of country is quite as mysterious and incomprehensible  to us as the spirit of the flock to which I refer. A hive of bees  evidently has a collective purpose and plan that does not emanate from  any single individual or group of individuals, and which is understood  by all without outward communication.    Is there anything which, without great violence to language, may be  called a school of the woods? In the sense in which a playground is a  school--a playground without rules or methods or a director--there is  a school of the woods. It is an unkept, an unconscious school or  gymnasium, and is entirely instinctive. In play the young of all  animals, no doubt, get a certain amount of training and disciplining  that helps fit them for their future careers; but this school is not  presided over or directed by parents, though they sometimes take part  in it. It is spontaneous and haphazard, without rule or system; but  is, in every case, along the line of the future struggle for life of  the particular bird or animal. A young marsh hawk which we reared used  to play at striking leaves or bits of bark with its talons; kittens  play with a ball, or a cob, or a stick, as if it were a mouse, dogs  race and wrestle with one another as in the chase; ducks dive and  sport in the water; doves circle and dive in the air as if escaping  from a hawk; birds pursue and dodge one another in the same way; bears  wrestle and box; chickens have mimic battles; colts run and leap;  fawns probably do the same thing; squirrels play something like a game  of tag in the trees; lambs butt one another and skip about the rocks;  and so on.    In fact, nearly all play, including much of that of man, takes the  form of mock battle, and is to that extent an education for the  future. Among the carnivora it takes also the form of the chase. Its  spring and motive are, of course, pleasure, and not education; and  herein again is revealed the cunning of nature--the power that  conceals purposes of its own in our most thoughtless acts. The cat and  the kitten play with the live mouse, not to indulge the sense of  cruelty, as some have supposed, but to indulge in the pleasure of the  chase and unconsciously to practice the feat of capture. The cat  rarely plays with a live bird, because the recapture would be more  difficult, and might fail. What fisherman would not like to take his  big fish over and over again, if he could be sure of doing it, not  from cruelty, but for the pleasure of practicing his art? For further  light on the subject of the significance of the play of animals, I  refer the reader to the work of Professor Karl Groos called \"The Play  of Animals.\"    One of my critics has accused me of measuring all things by the  standard of my little farm--of thinking that what is not true of  animal life there is not true anywhere. Unfortunately my farm _is_  small--hardly a score of acres--and its animal life very limited. I  have never seen even a porcupine upon it; but I have a hill where one  might roll down, should one ever come my way and be in the mood for  that kind of play.[1] I have a few possums, a woodchuck or two, an  occasional skunk, some red squirrels and rabbits, and many kinds of  song-birds. Foxes occasionally cross my acres; and once, at least, I  saw a bald eagle devouring a fish in one of my apple-trees. Wild  ducks, geese, and swans in spring and fall pass across the sky above  me. Quail and grouse invade my premises, and of crows I have, at least  in bird-nesting time, too many.        [1] See comment on the story here alluded to on page 244.    But I have a few times climbed over my pasture wall and wandered into  distant fields. Once upon a time I was a traveler in Asia for the  space of two hours--an experience that ought to have yielded me some  startling discoveries, but did not. Indeed, the wider I have traveled  and observed nature, the more I am convinced that the wild creatures  behave just about the same in all parts of the country; that is, under  similar conditions. What one observes truly about bird or beast upon  his farm of ten acres, he will not have to unlearn, travel as wide or  as far as he will. Where the animals are much hunted, they are of  course much wilder and more cunning than where they are not hunted. In  the Yellowstone National Park we found the elk, deer, and mountain  sheep singularly tame; and in the summer, so we were told, the bears  board at the big hotels. The wild geese and ducks, too, were tame; and  the red-tailed hawk built its nest in a large dead oak that stood  quite alone near the side of the road. With us the same hawk hides its  nest in a tree in the dense woods, because the farmers unwisely hunt  and destroy it. But the cougars and coyotes and bobcats were no tamer  in the park than they are in other places where they are hunted.    Indeed, if I had elk and deer and caribou and moose and bears and  wildcats and beavers and otters and porcupines on my farm, I should  expect them to behave just as they do in other parts of the country  under like conditions: they would be tame and docile if I did not  molest them, and wild and fierce if I did. They would do nothing out  of character in either case.    Your natural history knowledge of the East will avail you in the West.  There is no country, says Emerson, in which they do not wash the pans  and spank the babies; and there is no country where a dog is not a  dog, or a fox a fox, or where a hare is ferocious, or a wolf lamblike.  The porcupine behaves in the Rockies just as he does in the  Catskills; the deer and the moose and the black bear and the beaver  of the Pacific slope are almost identical in their habits and traits  with those of the Atlantic slope.    In my observations of the birds of the far West, I went wrong in my  reckoning but once: the Western meadowlark has a new song. How or  where he got it is a mystery; it seems to be in some way the gift of  those great, smooth, flowery, treeless, dimpled hills. But the swallow  was familiar, and the robin and the wren and the highhole, while the  woodchuck I saw and heard in Wyoming might have been the \"chuck\" of my  native hills. The eagle is an eagle the world over. When I was a boy I  saw, one autumn day, an eagle descend with extended talons upon the  backs of a herd of young cattle that were accompanied by a  cosset-sheep and were feeding upon a high hill. The object of the  eagle seemed to be to"]]]
