Whatever the  reason--most likely from some hallucination of boyhood--I entertained  the belief that swans must be exceedingly fine eating. As I prided  myself then, just after crossing the plains, upon being a good cook,  great preparations were made for an extra fine feast on what I fancied  would be a delicious bird. We had a good stove and the first of the  two swans was carefully \"stuffed\" with the choicest dressing,  consisting of the combined suggestions of the three of us. It was  placed in the oven, the fire carefully tended and the magnificent bird  repeatedly \"basted.\" When it was ready and placed on the table it fell  to my lot to do the carving. Having drawn my knife across the  hunger-producing carcass without making any perceptible impression, I  decided that it must be the fault of a dull knife. Among our table  furnishings we had no sharpening steel, a scythe stone doing service  in its stead. I hunted this up and began on the knife with the  \"mower's challenge\" stroke and soon had an edge that would have cut  through anything less than an eighty-pound rail. With no little effort  I amputated the legs and the wings, and cutting a generous piece from  one side of the breast passed it to one of my companions, who at once  began on it with his knife. A few attempts to sever it and he reached  for the scythe stone. Then when he began chewing on the segregated  piece he declared that it was not cooked enough. A dispute followed as  to whether it is over-cooking or under-cooking that makes a bird  tough. With this momentous question still unsettled we decided that  some of the many ingredients that we had put into the \"stuffing\" must  have given the meat its sole-leather consistency. We had a couple of  hounds, whose teeth had been well tested in many a coyote kill, and we  passed this first swan up to them.    The next day the other bird was worked into a fine stew and well  cooked. When served the stew was fine. The dumplings were light and  fairly melted in our mouths; the red peppers were hot; the aroma of  onions was just of that degree to suggest the ambrosia of the gods;  but the swan! Well, the hounds ate it through the compulsion of  hunger.    A half-grown swan, however, is very good eating.    There is very little difference in the two varieties. The whistling  swan being more of a northern bird, rarely migrating as far south as  central California. About the only noticeable difference is that the  whistling swan has a small yellow spot at the V-shaped point of the  bill where it meets the eye.          THE WADERS AND SHORE BIRDS      The Pacific Coast is especially rich in waders and shore birds, there  being upwards of forty species that are more or less common, with some  ten or more that are occasional visitors. Of these few can be  considered game birds, while others are so small that they are rarely  shot by our sportsmen. Many of both the waders and the shore birds are  constant residents. Others come from still farther south for breeding  purposes, while still others breed north of us and migrate throughout  the territorial scope of these articles to spend their winters.    The shore birds, while very common, are hunted but little by the  sportsmen of this region, and many of the smaller species that are  considered quite a delicacy by our eastern brethren are passed by  entirely by our lovers of the gun. The reasons for this will be  obvious to all who have read the preceding pages and noted the  abundance and great variety of larger and better game. By better game  I mean birds that furnish better sport by requiring more skill in  approaching them and better marksmanship in bringing them to bag. The  little mountain plover, of the southern part of the Coast, while not  surpassed even by the jack snipe as a table delicacy, are hunted but  little, even where they are very abundant, because there is little  sport to be had in shooting them. And the same is true, in a great  measure, of several other species. Sportsmen, therefore, are little  acquainted with these birds either as to their names, gastronomic  merits or means of identification.        [Illustration: WHITE-FACED GLOSSY IBIS (Plegadis gaurauna)]      THE HERONS and IBISES    (Order, HERODIONES)      While none of the order =Herodiones=, which includes the storks,  herons, ibises and bitterns, can be considered game birds, they are so  common about our waters, and some of them add such a charm to the  scene by their beautiful plumage and graceful movement, that mention  of some of them here will not be out of place.    The great blue heron (=Ardea herodias=) is the most common of these  waders. With his long, gracefully curved neck and slender legs he  wades with stately mien along the shallow waters of the lakes,  marshes and streams, both summer and winter, for he is to the manner  born and has no desire to seek other lands or other climes. The herons  are said to be destructive to fish. This can be to a limited extent  only, for they subsist very largely on the enemies of the fish,  destroying hundreds of snakes, water lizards and other fish  destroyers.    The snowy heron, or white crane as it is commonly called (=Ardea  candidissima=), is another handsome wader that lends a charm to the  lakes, ponds and streams from Oregon south through Mexico. Built on  the same graceful lines as its blue relative, and with a plumage as  white as the purest snow, it never fails to attract attention.    Three representatives of the family =Ibididae= are found here and  present a pleasing and interesting group.    The white-faced glossy ibis (=Plegadis guarauna=) ranges over the  larger portion of the Coast, but from Lower California north only for  breeding purposes. Its long curved bill, slim, gracefully bent neck,  shapely body, tall legs and irridescent reflections of its plumage in  the sunlight, place it among the most attractive of North American  birds. Unlike the herons they are gregarious and are, therefore, seen  in flocks of varying size. The glossy ibis is often called bronze  curlew, but this is a bad misnomer, as they are in no way related to  the curlew.    Another of the family is the white ibis (=Guara alba=). These are  quite common in Lower California and Mexico. They rarely migrate into  California, though they venture much to the north of us in a  northeastern direction, reaching the shores of the Great Salt Lake,  during the breeding season. The scarlet ibis (=Guara rubra=), the  other member of the family, is confined to Mexico, so far as these  articles are concerned.    The American egret (=Ardea egretta=) ranges from Oregon south to South  America. It was at one time quite plentiful in California, but its  handsome plumes attracted the eye of the milliner, which in turn  aroused the cupidity of the market hunter, and these beautiful birds  are now rare north of Lower California and Mexico, and are rapidly  decreasing even there. The reddish egret (=Ardea rufescens=) is an  inhabitant of Lower California and Mexico, not coming north of these  places. Though not as handsome as the white egret, it is also being  exterminated for the same purposes.    The birds that I have so far mentioned, while not game birds, are so  constantly before the eyes of the sportsmen who engage in waterfowl  shooting that they can not help but be interested in them. They add a  variety and a beauty to the scene, and many an hour's wait, that  otherwise would have been tedious, has passed away pleasantly in  watching the graceful movements of some one or more of these stately  waders.          THE CRANES, RAILS, GALLINULES      To the order, =Paludicolae=, belong the cranes, rails, gallinules and  coots, or mudhens, as they are commonly called. Of the members of this  order we are concerned only with the cranes, rails and coots. The  sandhill crane (=Grus canadensis) is a common visitor to all parts of  the Coast, but more plentiful in the interior valleys than near the  seashore. They are generally hard to approach and for that reason they  are but little hunted by our sportsmen. The whooping crane (=Grus  americana) once common throughout the middle states, is still met with  to considerable extent in Mexico, but it is by no means a common  visitor.    The California clapper rail, known also as the San Mateo rail (=Rallus  obsoletus=), is the largest as well as the most important of the rail  family in this section. At one time the clapper rail was very  plentiful in certain localities in California and furnished abundant  sport, though rather of a tame nature, to those who hunted them. Being  an easy bird to kill and unsuspicious, they have been rapidly reduced  in numbers until now they are in danger of extinction unless laws are  enacted giving them better protection. The clapper is only a straggler  south of San Francisco bay.    The Virginia rail (=Rallus virginianus=), a species not more than half  the size of the clapper rail, is found sparingly over the Coast, but  principally on the fresh water marshes.    The little yellow rail (=Porzana noveboracensis=) is found on the  fresh waters from central California south, but it is nowhere  abundant.    The black rail (=Porzana jamaicensis=) is another of the smaller rails  that are found on the fresh waters to a limited extent. Both this and  the last preceding one are so small that they are seldom shot, though  as an article of food they are very delicate.          THE SHORE BIRDS    (Order, LIMICOLAE)      The order =Limicolae=, which is composed of the shore birds proper,  is abundantly represented. They are seen wading in the shallow waters,  carefully watching for worms, insects and other species of food upon  which they live, boring in the soft mud, scurrying in flocks from  place to place, or running along the beach as the surf recedes,  picking up the jetsam of the sea, then taking wing or running back  like a playful"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38077"],[0,"British Birds in Their Haunts (#15)"],[1,"above the eye. The haunts and habits of the  two birds are precisely similar, but the Reed Warbler is by far the  less common of the two; for while the Sedge Warbler is sure to be  found wherever the Reed Warbler has been observed, the converse by no  means follows. The parts of England in which it appears to be most  frequent, are East Riding of Yorkshire, Essex, Surrey, Kent, Suffolk,  and Norfolk. In the reed-beds on the banks of the Thames, between  Erith and Greenwich, it is common.    \"The nest of the Reed Warbler is often elegantly built, and generally  fixed to three or four reed-stems. It is composed of slender blades of  grass, interwoven with reed-tops, dry duckweed, and the spongy  substance which covers many of the marsh ditches; and, here and there,  a long piece of sedge is wound securely around it; the lining is of  the finer flowering stems of grass, intermixed with a little  horsehair. It is a deep and solid structure, so that the eggs cannot  easily roll out; it is firmly fastened to the reeds in tidal ditches  and rivers, at the height of three or four feet from the water, but in  still ditches often not more than a foot. In windy weather, when  wading through the reed-beds, I have seen nests, with both old and  young in them, blown nearly to the surface of the water; but the birds  fix their claws firmly to the sides of the nest, with their heads to  windward, and thus ride as securely in their cradle as a sailor does  in his cot or hammock.\"[5] The Cuckoo occasionally chooses the Reed  Warbler's nest to lay its eggs in, for the same writer remarks--\"At  the latter end of July, 1829, while reading in my garden, which  adjoins a market garden, I was agreeably surprised to see a young  Cuckoo, nearly full-grown, alight on the railings between the two, not  more than a dozen yards from where I was sitting. Anxious to see what  bird had reared this Cuckoo, I silently watched his movements, and had  not waited more than a minute, when a Reed Warbler flew to the Cuckoo,  who, crouching down with his breast close to the rail, and fluttering  his wings, opened wide his orange-coloured mouth to receive the insect  his foster-mother had brought him. This done, the Reed Warbler flew  away for a fresh supply of food. The difference in the size of the two  birds was great; it was like a pigmy feeding a giant. While the Reed  Warbler was absent, the Cuckoo shuffled along the rail, and hopped  upon a slender post to which it was nailed, and which projected about  eight inches above the rail. The Reed Warbler soon returned with more  food, and alighted close to the Cuckoo, but on the rail beneath him;  she then began to stretch herself to the utmost to give him the food,  but was unable to reach the Cuckoo's mouth, who, like a simpleton,  threw his head back, with his mouth wide open, as before. The Reed  Warbler, by no means at a loss, perched upon the Cuckoo's broad back,  who, still holding back his head, received in this singular way the  morsel brought for him.\" The song of the Reed Warbler is loudest and  at its best during the evening twilight.       [5] Mr. W. H. Thomas, in the _Zoologist_, p. 97.        MARSH WARBLER     ACROCA%PHALUS PALUSTRIS        Upper parts olive-green without any reddish tinge; legs and      feet pale brown.    The Marsh Warbler is local in its occurrence, in the south of England.  It nests in drier places than the Reed Warbler and its song is  different, being much more melodious, and uttered more boldly. Close  to low bushes, or among meadow-sweet, nettles and cow-parsnip, you may  find its nest, which is made of fine rounded stalks of grass and lined  with horsehair. There are five to seven eggs, whiter in ground colour  than those of the Reed Warbler. The Marsh Warbler comes each spring to  the neighbourhood of Taunton, but it is still a somewhat rare species.        THE SEDGE WARBLER     ACROCA%PHALUS PHRAGMATIS        Upper plumage olive-grey, the centre of each feather tinged      with brown; above the eyes a broad yellowish white stripe;      under, yellowish white, more or less tinged with red; throat      white; tail rounded, of moderate length, of a uniform      ash-brown. Length four and a half inches; breadth seven and a      half. Eggs dirty white, mottled all over with dull yellowish      brown.    On the banks of reedy and bushy rivers, in marshes, withy holts,  wherever, in fact, there is fresh water associated with enough  vegetation to shelter and conceal, this bustling little bird is a  constant summer visitor; restless in its habits, and courting notice  by its twittering song, from the time of its arrival to that of its  departure. It is usually first detected by its rapidly repeated note,  which it utters while performing its short flights from bush to bush,  and while creeping in and out among reeds and rushes. The fisherman  knows it well, and is often tempted to withdraw his eye from his fly  or float, to watch its movements on the opposite bank. From its  unceasing babble, ploughboys call it a 'chat', a name which  exactly answers to the French name of the group to which it  belongs--'_Jaseuses_'. Its note is remarkable neither for volume nor  sweetness, and, like that of unfeathered chatterers, seems to carry  more noise than meaning. To a certain extent the bird is a mimic, as  it imitates such notes of other birds as are within the compass of its  little throat. I was walking one morning in May by the banks of a  canal not far from a village, when I remarked the exact resemblance  between a portion of its song and the chirrup of a House Sparrow.  Intermixed with this, I detected the note of some other bird; but,  familiar though it sounded, I ransacked my memory in vain to discover  from whom it was purloined. Pursuing my walk towards the houses, I  heard the note of some Guinea-fowls; not the 'come-back' cry, but the  'click-click' which every one knows so well. Of this the Sedge  Warbler had caught exactly both the key and the time; the two notes  were in fact identical, except that they were performed on instruments  of different calibre. Like other chatterers, who, when they have  finished their song, are easily provoked to begin again, the Sedge  Warbler, if he does occasionally retire to a bed of reeds and there  holds his peace, may be excited to repeat his whole story over again,  with variations and additions, by flinging a stone into his  breathing-place. And not content with babbling all day, he extends his  loquacity far into the night; hence he has been called the Sedge  Nightingale, but with doubtful propriety, for, with all the will  perhaps to vie with that prince of songsters, the _zinzinare_ of the  Nightingale is far beyond his powers. Yet in spite of his  obtrusiveness, he is an amusing and a pleasant companion to the  wanderer by the river's side: his rivalry is devoid of malice, and his  mimicry gives no one pain. While at rest--if he is ever to be detected  in this state--he may be distinguished from all other birds  frequenting similar haunts by his rounded tail, and a light narrow  mark over each eye. His food consists of worms, insects, and  fresh-water mollusks, for which he hunts among the stems of aquatic  plants. As an architect, he displays great skill, constructing his  nest among low bushes, never at any great distance from the water,  about a foot from the ground. It is composed of stems and leaves of  dead grass, moss and fine roots, and lined with hair, wool, feathers,  and the down of various marsh plants. The structure is large, compact,  and deep, suspended from, rather than built on, its supports. The eggs  are usually five or six in number, though as many as seven have been  sometimes found.        THE GRASSHOPPER WARBLER     LOCUSTELLA NAVIA        Upper parts light brown, with a tinge of green, and presenting      a spotted appearance, owing to the centres of the feathers      being darkest; tail long, rounded at the extremity and      tapering towards the base; under parts whitish brown, the      breast marked with darker spots; feet and toes light brown.      Length five and a half inches; breadth seven and a half. Eggs      reddish white, closely speckled with darker red.    As long ago as the time when a stroll of five-and-twenty miles  fatigued me less than a journey of ten does now--when I returned from  my botanical rambles with tin boxes, hands and pockets, laden with  stores of flowers, ferns, and mosses, my homeward path often led me  through a certain valley and wood on the skirts of Dartmoor, known by  the names of Bickleigh Vale and Fancy Wood. It often happened that  twilight was fading into gloom when I reached this stage in my  wanderings--the last of the evening songsters had hushed its note; for  this county, beautiful as it is, offers not sufficient attraction to  the Nightingale; yet I never passed this way under such circumstances  without feeling myself compelled to stop once and again to listen to  the monotonous whir of what I had been told, and what I believed to be  the note of the large green grasshopper, or locust. Monotonous is,  perhaps, not the right word to use, for an acute ear can detect in the  long unmusical jar a cadence descending sometimes a semitone, and  occasionally almost a whole note; and it seemed besides to increase in  loudness for a few seconds and then to subside a little below the  ordinary pitch; this fall is chiefly at the breeding season. Whether  the difference was produced by a rising and lulling of the breeze, or  whether the musician actually altered its note and intensity of noise  (or must I call it music?), I could never decide. As long as I fancied  the performer to be an insect, I was inclined to believe that one of  the first suppositions was correct; for it seemed hardly possible that  the purely mechanical action of an insect's thighs against its body  could produce variety of sound--as well expect varied intonations from  a"]]]
