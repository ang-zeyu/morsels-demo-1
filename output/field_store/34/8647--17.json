W El Encino, 400 ft., 1; 2 km. W El Carrizo, 2; 9 mi. SW       Tula, 5200 ft., 1.         Additional records (Goodwin, 1954:7, unless otherwise       noted): Chamal; La Joya de Salas; Gomez Farias; Rancho Pano       Ayuctle; Altamira (Nelson, 1909:186).      =Lepus californicus=    Black-tailed Jack Rabbit    The black-tailed jack rabbit is the only species of _Lepus_ known from  Tamaulipas and is represented there by three subspecies, _L. c.  merriami_ of the northern part of the state, _L. c. altamirae_ of the  southeastern coastal plains, and _L. c. curti_ of the barrier beach  south of Matamoros. The known ranges of the three subspecies are not  presently known to meet in Tamaulipas.      =Lepus californicus altamirae= Nelson         1904. _Lepus merriami altamirae_ Nelson, Proc. Biol. Soc.       Washington, 17:109, May 18, type from Altamira, Tamaulipas.         1951. _Lepus californicus altamirae_, Hall, Univ. Kansas       Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:45, October 1.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Southern coastal plain north       certainly to vicinity of Soto la Marina.    The two specimens examined in this study (see below) are intermediate  between _L. c. altamirae_ and _L. c. curti_, but show greater  resemblance to the former. In measurements they resemble _altamirae_  rather than the smaller _curti_. They approach the latter in length of  hind foot and are intermediate between the two subspecies in basilar  length; in one specimen, the dimensions of the rostrum are as in  _curti_ and the other has the black patch on the posterior surface of  the ear well developed, as in _altamirae_, but in the other the black  is reduced. _L. c. altamirae_ has been known previously only from  Altamira.         _Measurements._--Two male adults (55415, 55416) from north       of Soto la Marina, afford the following external       measurements: 610, 590; 100, 100; 124, 125; 124, 122 (length       of ear from notch, dry, 114, 110). Cranial measurements are:       basilar length, 75.1, 74.4; length of nasals, 46.1, 41.9;       width of rostrum at PM, 25.1, 28.7; height of rostrum in       front of PM, 25.2, 21.5; diameter of auditory bulla, 14.1,       13.0.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 2: 3 mi.

Hist., 5:42, October 1, type from barrier beach 88       mi. S, 10 mi. W Matamoros, Tamaulipas.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Known only by the three       specimens mentioned in the original description from two       barrier islands in northeastern part of state.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 3: 88 mi. S,       10 mi. W Matamoros, 2; 90 mi. S, 10 mi.

Amer. Fauna,       29:148, August 31.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Northern and western parts of       state.    The two specimens examined, an adult female and a young male, from the  barrier beach 33 miles south of Washington Beach are intergrades  between _L. c. merriami_, reported from the mainland from as near as  Matamoros, and _L. c. curti_, which occurs farther to the south on the  same series of barrier beaches. Of seven characters that seem to  differentiate the two subspecies, the adult female from 33 miles south  of Washington beach resembles _merriami_ in four as follows: tips of  ears black (white in _curti_); nasals long; hind foot long; and  supraoccipital process broad. The specimen resembles _curti_ in  shortness of tail and in having small auditory bullae. Breadth of  rostrum above premolars, the seventh character, is less than in typical  specimens of either of the two subspecies. More material is needed from  the barrier beach in order to establish with certainty the  relationships between jack rabbits occurring there.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 4: 33 mi. S       Washington Beach, 2; 12 mi. NW San Carlos, 1300 ft., 2.         Additional records: Nuevo Laredo (Nelson, 1909:150); Mier       (_ibid._); Camargo (_ibid._); Matamoros (Hall, 1951:185);       Tamaulipeca, San Carlos Mts. (_ibid._).      =Spermophilus mexicanus parvidens= Mearns    Mexican Ground Squirrel         1896. _Spermophilus mexicanus parvidens_ Mearns, Preliminary       diagnoses of new mammals from the Mexican border of the       United States, p. 1, March 25, type from Fort Clark, Kinney       Co., Texas.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Northern part of state, south       at least to Xicotencatl.    Most of the specimens examined from Tamaulipas are in the brown phase  (Howell, 1938:121) and differ from _S. m. parvidens_ from Texas,  Coahuila, and Nuevo Leon in being darker dorsally. Nevertheless, some  individuals are as pale as those examined from the mentioned states.  Measurements of Tamaulipan specimens average smaller than those given  by Howell (1938:121) and Baker (1956:205) for _parvidens_.    Specimens from San Fernando differ slightly from those from Soto la  Marina in having a relatively long tail (average 69.2 instead of 62.1  per cent of length of head and body) and in having the upper parts of  the hind feet ochraceous instead of nearly white.    Two May-taken females from Soto la Marina carried 5 and 7 embryos that  were 10 mm. in crown-rump length; another taken there was lactating.  Weight of six non-pregnant females from San Fernando averaged 160.6  (129-197) grams. Two males from the same locality weighed 164 and 145  grams.         _Measurements._--Average and extreme measurements of four       males and three females from Soto la Marina are, as follows:       312.6 (296-330); 119.8 (110-130); 41.6 (38-43). Average       cranial measurements of five specimens (two males, three       females) from same locality are: greatest length of skull,       44.7 (43.7-47.4); zygomatic breadth, 26.9 (25.3-28.6);       breadth of braincase, 19.4 (19.2-19.5); interorbital       constriction, 13.3 (12.5-14.1); length of nasals, 15.9       (14.6-17.5); length of maxillary tooth-row, 8.3 (8.0-8.5).         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 20: San       Fernando, 180 ft., 12; Soto la Marina, 500 ft., 8.         Additional records (Howell, 1938:121 unless otherwise       noted): Nuevo Laredo; Mier; Camargo; Reynosa; Bagdad;       Victoria; Xecotencatl [= Xicotencatl] (J. A. Allen,       1891:223).      =Spermophilus spilosoma oricolus= Alvarez    Spotted Ground Squirrel         1962. _Spermophilus spilosoma oricolus_ Alvarez, Univ.       Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist., 14:123, March 7, type from 1       mi. E La Pesca, Tamaulipas.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Known only from the type       locality and from parts of the barrier beach, but possibly       occurs at other places in northeastern parts of state.    The 10 specimens from the type locality were trapped or shot on the  beach, which was covered by thick, low, scattered bushes and grass. Of  the many holes found there, some probably were used by ground squirrels  and others by crabs. A female, taken on July 7 with two young at a  place 33 miles south of Washington Beach, weighed 133 grams and had six  placental scars. This specimen (reported as _Spermophilus spilosoma  annectens_ by Selander _et al._, 1962:335) resembles others examined  from the barrier beach (see Alvarez, 1962:124) and is therefore  assigned to _S. s. oricolus_.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 24: 33 mi. S       Washington Beach, 1; 88 mi. S, 10 mi. W Matamoros, 12; 89       mi. S, 10 mi. W Matamoros, 1; 1 mi.

Philadelphia, 1:332, April, type from Santa Catarina, a few       miles west of Monterrey, Nuevo Leon.         1955. _Spermophilus variegatus couchii_, Baker, Univ. Kansas       Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist, 9:207, June 15.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Possibly in southwestern       part; reported only from Ciudad Victoria (Howell, 1938:141).    Since Baird (1855:332) described _S. v. couchii_ and mentioned a  specimen from Ciudad Victoria that was obtained by Berlandier, no other  record from Tamaulipas has come to light. Probably the species obtained  by Berlandier was introduced at Ciudad Victoria by man.      =Sciurus aureogaster aureogaster= Cuvier    Red-bellied Squirrel         1829. [_Sciurus_] _aureogaster_ Cuvier, _in_ Geoffroy       St.-Hilaire, and F. Cuvier, Hist. Nat. Mamm., 6, livr. 59       pl. with text, September (binomen published only at end of       work, table generale et methodique, 7:4, 1842), type       locality \"California\"; restricted to Altamira, Tamaulipas,       by Nelson (Proc. Washington Acad. Sci., 1:38, May 9, 1899).         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Tropical forest of southern       part; north at least to Rancho Santa Rosa.    According to one collector (Schaldach), natives referred to _Sciurus  aureogaster_ as \"ardilla pinta\" or \"ardilla colorada.\" He recorded in  his field notes that _S. aureogaster_ was most active between 7:00 and  9:00 a. m. and again from 3:00 to 5:00 p. m., that the nest was  constructed of green oak leaves, and that the nest resembles somewhat  in size and form that of _S. carolinensis_.    Of 53 specimens examined, 17 are black and one from 70 kilometers south  of Ciudad Victoria is clearly more whitish than the others.

These variations match the text of the original  document. A few obvious punctuation errors have been repaired. Spelling  has been retained as it appears in the original publication, except as  follows:      p. 372, in \"A more homogeneous vegetation would tend to pass\" homogenous    has been changed to homogeneous.      p. 415, \"1953.
