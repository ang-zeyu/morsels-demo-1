I can only stay a week.  I've arranged it all beautifully, and I  shall live here in this loft; Father never dreams of coming here, so  it will be quite safe, and you can all bring me food.  And then after  a week\"--she sighed heavily--\"I must go back again.\"    \"Did you really walk all those miles just to see us?\" Pip said,  and again there was the strange note in his voice.    \"I got a lift or two on the way,\" she said, \"but I walked  nearly all of it, I've been coming for nearly a week:\"    \"How COULD you do it?  Where did you sleep, Judy?  What did you eat?\"  Meg exclaimed, in deep distress.    \"I nearly forget,\" Judy said; closing her eyes again.  \"I kept  asking for food at little cottages, and sometimes they asked me to  sleep, and I had three-and-six--that went a long way.  I only slept  outside two nights, and I had my jacket then.\"    Meg's face was pale with horror at her sister's adventure.  Surely no  girl in the wide world but Judy Woolcot would have attempted such a  harebrained project as walking all those miles with three-and-six in  her pocket.    \"How COULD you?\" was all she could find to say.  \"I hadn't meant  to walk all the way,\" Judy said, with a faint mile.  \"I had seven  shillings in a bit of paper in my pocket, as well as the three-and-six,  and I knew it would take me a long way in the train.  But then I lost  it after I had started, and I didn't believe in going back just for  that, so, of course, I had to walk.\"    Meg touched her cheek softly.    \"It's no wonder you got so thin,\" she said.    \"Won't the Miss Buttons be raising a hue-and-cry after you?\" Pip asked.  \"It's a wonder they've not written to the pater to say you have  skedaddled.\"    \"Oh! Marian and I made that all safe,\" Judy said, with a smile of  recollective pleasure.  \"Marian's my chum, you see, and does anything  I tell her.  And she lives at Katoomba.\"    \"Well?\" said Meg, mystified, as her sister paused.  \"Well, you see,  a lot of the girls had the measles, and so they sent Marian home, for  fear she should get them.   And Marian's mother asked for me to go there,  too, for a fortnight; and so Miss Burton wrote and asked Father could I?  and I wrote and asked couldn't I come home instead for the time?\"    \"He never told us,\" Meg said softly.    \"No, I s'pose not.  Well, he wrote back and said 'no' to me and  'yes' to her.  So one day they put us in the train safely, and  we were to be met at Katoomba.  And the thought jumped into my head  as we went along:  Why ever shouldn't I come home on the quiet?  So  I told Marian she could explain to her people I had gone home instead,  and that she was to be sure to make it seem all right, so they wouldn't  write to Miss Button.  And then the train stopped at Blackheath, and  I jumped straight out, and she went on to Katoomba, and I came home.  That's all.  Only, you see, as I'd lost my money there was nothing left  for it but to walk.\"    Meg smoothed the dusty, tangled confusion of her hair.    \"But you can't live out here for the week,\" she said, in a troubled  voice.  \"You've got a horrid cough with sleeping outside, and I'm  sure you're ill.  We shall have to tell Father about it.  I'll beg him  not to send you back, though.\"    Judy started up, her eyes aflame.    \"If you do,\" she said--\"if you do, I will run away this very night,  and walk to Melbourne, or Jerusalem, and never see any of you again!  How can you, Meg!  After I've done all this just so he wouldn't know!  Oh, how CAN you?\"    She was working herself up into a strong state of excitement.    \"Why, I should be simply packed back again tomorrow--you know I  would, Meg.  Shouldn't I now, Pip?  And get into a fearful row at  school into the bargain.  My plan is beautifully simple.  After  I've had a week's fun here with you I shall just go back--you can  all lend me some money for the train.  I shall just meet Marian at  Katoomba on the 25th; we shall both go back to school together, and  no one will be a bit the wiser.  My cough's nothing; you know I  often do get coughs at home, and they never hurt me.  As long as you  bring me plenty to eat, and stay with me, I'll be all right.\"    The rest and food and home faces had done much already for her;  her  face looked less pinched, and a little more wholesome colour was  creeping slowly into her cheeks.    Meg had an uncomfortable sense of responsibility, and the feeling that  she ought to tell someone was strong upon her; but she was overruled  by the others in the end.    \"You couldn't be so mean, Meg,\" Judy had said warmly, when she  had implored to be allowed to tell Esther.    \"Such a blab!\" Bunty had added.  \"Such an awful sneak!\" Pip had  said.    So Meg held her tongue, but was exceedingly unhappy.          CHAPTER XII    Swish, Swish!      On the fourth day of Judy's residence in the loft, Martha Tomlinson  remarked to her fellow-servant and sufferer, Bridget, that she  believed them blessed children were in a conspiracy to put her  \"over the river.\"    Bridget's digestion was impaired that morning, and she merely  remarked that she supposed the dear little things only felt a desire  to see her in her proper place.    I should explain to you, perhaps, that \"over the river\" meant  Gladesville, which is Sydney's Colney Hatch.    Many things had led the unhappy Martha to a belief in this conspiracy.  For instance, when she went to make Pip's bed as usual one morning all  the bedclothes had gone.  The white counterpane was spread smoothly  over the mattress, but there was absolutely no trace of the blankets,  sheets, and pillows.  She hunted in every possible and impossible place,  questioned the children, and even applied to Esther, but the missing  things could not be found.    \"There's a man in corduroy trousers hanging round here every night,\"  Pip said, gloomily regarding his stripped bed.  \"I shouldn't wonder if  he had something to do with it.\"    Which suggestion was distinctly unkind, seeing the man in corduroy  trousers was Martha's most ardent and favoured admirer.    The next day the washing basin in Meg's room went, and after that a  chair from the nursery, and a strip of carpet from the top landing,  not to mention such small things as a teapot, a spirit-lamp, cups and  plates, half a horn, and a whole baking of gingerbread nuts.    The losses preyed upon Martha, for the things seemed to disappear  while the children were in bed; and though she suspected them, and  watched them continually, she could get no clear proof of their  guilt, nor even find any motive for them abstracting such things.    And after the disappearance of each fresh article, Pip used to ask  whether the corduroy-trousered gentleman had been to the house the  night before.  And as it always happened, that he had, Martha could do  nothing but cast a wrathful glance at the boy and flounce from the  room.    One night the little chess-table from the nursery was spirited away.    Pip fell upon Martha's neck the next morning early, as she was  sweeping the carpet, and affected to be dissolved in tears.    \"'We never prize the violet,'\"  he said, in broken tones.  \"Ah!  Martha, Martha! we never felt what a treasure we had in you till now,  when your days with us are numbered.\"    \"Get along with you,\" she said, hitting out at him with the broom  handle.  \"And I ain't a-goin' to leave, so don't you think it.  You'd  have it your own way then too much.  No; you don't get shut of  Martha Tomlinson just yet, young man.\"    \"But won't he be wanting you, Martha?\" he said gently.  \"His  furnishing must be nearly finished now.  He's not taken a saucepan  yet, nor a flat-iron, I know; but there's everything else, Martha;  and I don't mind telling you in confidence I'm thinking of giving you  a flat-iron myself as a wedding present, so you needn't wait till he  comes for that.\"    \"Get out with you!\" said Martha again, thrusting the broom-head  right into his face, and nearly choking him with dust.  \"It's a limb  of the old gentleman himself you are.\"    Away in the loft things were getting very comfortable.    A couple of rugs hung on the walls kept out the draught.  Judy's bed,  soft and warm, was in a corner; she had a chair to sit in, a  table to eat at, even a basin in which to perform her ablutions.  And she had company all day; and nearly always all night.  Once Meg  had stolen away, after fastening her bedroom door, and had shared the  bed in the loft; once Nellie had gone, and the other night Pip had  taken a couple of blankets and made himself a shakedown among the straw.  They used to pay her visits at all hours of the day, creeping up the  creaking ladder one after the other, whenever they could get away  unnoticed.    The governess had, as it happened, a fortnight's holiday, to nurse a  sick mother, so the girls and Bunty had no demands on their time.  Pip  used to go to school late and come back early, cajoling notes of excuse,  whenever, possible, out of Esther.  He even played the truant once, and  took a caning for it afterwards quite good-humouredly.    Judy still looked pale and tired, and her cough was rather troublesome;  but she was fast getting her high spirits back, and was enjoying her  adventure immensely.    The only drawback was the cribbed, cabined, and confined space of  the loft.    \"You will HAVE to arrange things so that I can go for a run,\" she said  one morning, in a determined manner.  \"My legs are growing shorter,  I am sure, with not exercising them.  I shall have forgotten how to walk  by the end of the week.\"    Pip didn't think it could be done; Meg besought her to run no risks;  but Bunty and Nell were eager for it.    \"Meg could talk to Father,\" Bunty said, \"and Pip could keep"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47316"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 2 of 3) (#15)"],[1,"the learning of this      generation: consequently they would be considered of no worth,      only as precious metal. Therefore, remember, that they are to be      translated by the gift and power of God. By them will the Lord work      a great and a marvelous work: the wisdom of the wise shall become      as naught, and the understanding of the prudent shall be hid, and      because the power of God shall be displayed those who profess to      know the truth but walk in deceit, shall tremble with anger; but      with signs and with wonders, with gifts and with healings, with      the manifestations of the power of God, and with the Holy Ghost,      shall the hearts of the faithful be comforted. You have now beheld      the power of God manifested and the power of satan: you see that      there is nothing that is desirable in works of darkness; that they      cannot bring happiness: that those who are overcome therewith are      miserable, while on the other hand the righteous are blessed with a      peace in the kingdom of God where joy unspeakable surrounds them.      There they rest beyond the power of the enemy of truth, where no      evil can disturb them. The glory of God crowns them, and they      continually feast upon his goodness and enjoy his smiles. Behold,      notwithstanding you have seen this great display of power, by which      you may ever be able to detect the evil one, yet I give unto you      another sign, and when it comes to pass then know that the Lord is      God and that he will fulfill his purposes, and that the knowledge      which this record contains will go to every nation, and kindred,      and tongue, and people under the whole heaven. This is the sign:      When these things begin to be known, that is, when it is known      that the Lord has shown you these things, the workers of iniquity      will seek your overthrow; they will circulate falsehoods to      destroy your reputation, and also will seek to take your life; but      remember this, if you are faithful, and shall hereafter continue      to keep the commandments of the Lord, you shall be preserved to      bring these things forth; for in due time he will again give you a      commandment to come and take them. When they are interpreted the      Lord will give the Holy Priesthood to some, and they shall begin      to proclaim this gospel and baptize by water, and after they shall      have power to give the Holy Ghost by the laying on of their hands.      Then will persecution rage more and more; for the iniquities of      men shall be revealed, and those who are not built upon the rock      will seek to overthrow this Church; but it will increase the more      opposed, and spread farther and farther, increasing in knowledge      till the Saints shall be sanctified and receive an inheritance      where the glory of God shall rest upon them; and when this takes      place, and all things are prepared, the Ten Tribes of Israel will      be revealed in the north country, whither they have been for a      long season; and when this is fulfilled will be brought to pass      that saying of the prophet--\"And the Redeemer shall come to Zion,      and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the      Lord.\" But, notwithstanding the workers of iniquity shall seek your      destruction, the arm of the Lord will be extended and you will be      borne off conqueror, if you keep all his commandments. Your name      shall be known among the nations, for the work which the Lord will      perform by your hands shall cause the righteous to rejoice and the      wicked to rage; with one it shall be had in honor, and the other      in reproach; yet, with these it shall be a terror because of the      great and marvelous work which shall follow the coming forth of      this fulness of the gospel. Now, go thy way, remember what the Lord      has done for thee, and be diligent in keeping his commandments, and      he will deliver thee from temptations, and all the arts and devices      of the wicked one. Forget not to pray, that thy mind may become      strong, that when he shall manifest unto thee, thou mayest have      power to escape the evil, and obtain these precious things. [14]    Such the events which took place on the occasion of the Prophet's  first visit to Cumorah. It is unfortunate that we do not have a more  circumstantial account of the subsequent annual interviews from 1823  to 1827; and likewise a more detailed account of the Prophet's early  movements connected with his obtaining the plates, and caring for them.    The place where the Nephite record was deposited must ever be of  interest to those who believe that record to be true, and therefore a  description of the hill Cumorah will not be out of place in concluding  this chapter. Joseph Smith's brief description of it has already been  given. [15]    The writer visited the hill Cumorah on the 22nd of February, 1897,  and the same day wrote out the following description of it: The hill  Cumorah is on the road between Manchester and the town of Palmyra,  in Wayne county, New York, about four miles directly south of the  latter place. Approaching it from the north, you are confronted by  the bold face of the hill, which rises quite abruptly from the common  level of the surrounding country; and as the east and west slopes of  the hill, as viewed from the north, are about equal and regular, it  looks from a distance as if it might be a huge conical-shaped mound.  Ascending its steep north side to the summit dispels the illusion, for  one finds that he has but climbed the abrupt north end of a ridge of  hill having its greatest extent from north to south, and which from its  very narrow summit broadens and slopes gently to the southward until  it sinks to the level of the common country. The east side of the hill  is now ploughed, but the west side is untouched by the husbandman; and  about two or three hundred yards from the north end there is on the  west side a small grove of young trees, with here and there a decaying  stump of a large tree to bear witness that the hill was once covered  with a heavy growth of timber. In fact it was so covered by timber when  the Prophet Joseph Smith first visited the place in 1823, as indeed  much of the surrounding country was at that time.    Unquestionably Cumorah is the most distinct land mark in all that  section of country, the highest hill, and the most commanding in what  I should describe as an extensive plain sloping northward filled with  numerous irregular hills, but which in the main have their greatest  extent, like Cumorah, from north to south; and which, also like  Cumorah, are generally highest at the north end. I observed this to be  the case all the way from Syracuse to Palmyra. It is worthy of note,  too, that the lakes of central and western New York, also have their  greatest extent from north to south. Indeed, for the most part, they  are but long strips of water left in their narrow beds when the great  body of water, which in ages long gone by once covered this whole  region, receded northward and gave the same general form both to the  lakes and to the hills on this northern slope of the water shed which  runs from east to west through New York, north Pennsylvania, Ohio and  Indiana; and which separates the basin of the great lakes and the  valley of the St. Lawrence from the valley of the Ohio and Mississippi.    West of Cumorah the country is more open than on the south or east. The  hills common to the country are fewer and the plain more expansive.  Though the country south and east is broken, and the numerous hills  higher than on the west, yet such is the commanding height of Cumorah  that the view is unobstructed for many miles. Northward some miles the  hills are most thickly clustered; between them and Cumorah is located  the town of Palmyra, and beyond that, at the foot of the thickly  clustered hills referred to, runs what is now called Canagrie creek,  really one of the tributaries of the Clyde river, into which it empties  at no great distance.    Such is the hill \"Cumorah\" and its surroundings; the hill \"Ramah\" of  the Jaredites; \"Mormon Hill,\" or \"Mormon Bible Hill,\" as it is called  by the people about Palmyra. \"On the west side of this hill, not far  from the top, under a stone of considerable size, lay the plates of the  Book of Mormon, deposited in a stone box.\" [16]    Footnotes    1. _History of the Prophet Joseph_, by Lucy Smith, chapters 21, 23.    2.

This undoubtedly would be the first part of the third chapter of  Malachi, as that part of the chapter has undoubtedly a direct bearing  on the coming forth of God's work in the last days. It reads as  follows: \"Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the  way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his  temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold,  he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts. But who may abide the day of  his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth. For he is like a  refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap: and he shall sit as a refiner  and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge  them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering  in righteousness. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be  pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old and as in former years.\"    9. For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A"]]]
