Promising them to report their situation, I left,  readjusted myself to my horse, recommenced the run, and was soon with  the troops at the east end.  Before ammunition could be collected, the  two regiments I had been with were seen returning, running the same  gauntlet in getting out that they had passed in going in, but with  comparatively little loss.  The movement was countermanded and the  troops were withdrawn.  The poor wounded officers and men I had found,  fell into the hands of the enemy during the night, and died.    While this was going on at the east, General Worth, with a small  division of troops, was advancing towards the plaza from the opposite  end of the city.  He resorted to a better expedient for getting to the  plaza--the citadel--than we did on the east. Instead of moving by the  open streets, he advanced through the houses, cutting passageways from  one to another.  Without much loss of life, he got so near the plaza  during the night that before morning, Ampudia, the Mexican commander,  made overtures for the surrender of the city and garrison.  This stopped  all further hostilities.  The terms of surrender were soon agreed upon.  The prisoners were paroled and permitted to take their horses and  personal property with them.    My pity was aroused by the sight of the Mexican garrison of Monterey  marching out of town as prisoners, and no doubt the same feeling was  experienced by most of our army who witnessed it.  Many of the prisoners  were cavalry, armed with lances, and mounted on miserable little  half-starved horses that did not look as if they could carry their  riders out of town.  The men looked in but little better condition.  I  thought how little interest the men before me had in the results of the  war, and how little knowledge they had of \"what it was all about.\"    After the surrender of the garrison of Monterey a quiet camp life was  led until midwinter.  As had been the case on the Rio Grande, the people  who remained at their homes fraternized with the \"Yankees\" in the  pleasantest manner.  In fact, under the humane policy of our commander,  I question whether the great majority of the Mexican people did not  regret our departure as much as they had regretted our coming.  Property  and person were thoroughly protected, and a market was afforded for all  the products of the country such as the people had never enjoyed before.  The educated and wealthy portion of the population here, as elsewhere,  abandoned their homes and remained away from them as long as they were  in the possession of the invaders; but this class formed a very small  percentage of the whole population.        CHAPTER IX.    POLITICAL INTRIGUE--BUENA VISTA--MOVEMENT AGAINST VERA CRUZ--SIEGE AND  CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ.    The Mexican war was a political war, and the administration conducting  it desired to make party capital out of it.  General Scott was at the  head of the army, and, being a soldier of acknowledged professional  capacity, his claim to the command of the forces in the field was almost  indisputable and does not seem to have been denied by President Polk, or  Marcy, his Secretary of War.  Scott was a Whig and the administration  was democratic.  General Scott was also known to have political  aspirations, and nothing so popularizes a candidate for high civil  positions as military victories.  It would not do therefore to give him  command of the \"army of conquest.\"  The plans submitted by Scott for a  campaign in Mexico were disapproved by the administration, and he  replied, in a tone possibly a little disrespectful, to the effect that,  if a soldier's plans were not to be supported by the administration,  success could not be expected.  This was on the 27th of May, 1846.  Four  days later General Scott was notified that he need not go to Mexico.  General Gaines was next in rank, but he was too old and feeble to take  the field.  Colonel Zachary Taylor--a brigadier-general by brevet--was  therefore left in command.  He, too, was a Whig, but was not supposed to  entertain any political ambitions; nor did he; but after the fall of  Monterey, his third battle and third complete victory, the Whig papers  at home began to speak of him as the candidate of their party for the  Presidency.  Something had to be done to neutralize his growing  popularity.  He could not be relieved from duty in the field where all  his battles had been victories:  the design would have been too  transparent.  It was finally decided to send General Scott to Mexico in  chief command, and to authorize him to carry out his own original plan:  that is, capture Vera Cruz and march upon the capital of the country.  It was no doubt supposed that Scott's ambition would lead him to  slaughter Taylor or destroy his chances for the Presidency, and yet it  was hoped that he would not make sufficient capital himself to secure  the prize.    The administration had indeed a most embarrassing problem to solve.  It  was engaged in a war of conquest which must be carried to a successful  issue, or the political object would be unattained.  Yet all the capable  officers of the requisite rank belonged to the opposition, and the man  selected for his lack of political ambition had himself become a  prominent candidate for the Presidency.  It was necessary to destroy his  chances promptly.  The problem was to do this without the loss of  conquest and without permitting another general of the same political  party to acquire like popularity.  The fact is, the administration of  Mr. Polk made every preparation to disgrace Scott, or, to speak more  correctly, to drive him to such desperation that he would disgrace  himself.    General Scott had opposed conquest by the way of the Rio Grande,  Matamoras and Saltillo from the first.  Now that he was in command of  all the forces in Mexico, he withdrew from Taylor most of his regular  troops and left him only enough volunteers, as he thought, to hold the  line then in possession of the invading army.  Indeed Scott did not deem  it important to hold anything beyond the Rio Grande, and authorized  Taylor to fall back to that line if he chose.  General Taylor protested  against the depletion of his army, and his subsequent movement upon  Buena Vista would indicate that he did not share the views of his chief  in regard to the unimportance of conquest beyond the Rio Grande.    Scott had estimated the men and material that would be required to  capture Vera Cruz and to march on the capital of the country, two  hundred and sixty miles in the interior.  He was promised all he asked  and seemed to have not only the confidence of the President, but his  sincere good wishes.  The promises were all broken.  Only about half the  troops were furnished that had been pledged, other war material was  withheld and Scott had scarcely started for Mexico before the President  undertook to supersede him by the appointment of Senator Thomas H.  Benton as lieutenant-general.  This being refused by Congress, the  President asked legislative authority to place a junior over a senior of  the same grade, with the view of appointing Benton to the rank of  major-general and then placing him in command of the army, but Congress  failed to accede to this proposition as well, and Scott remained in  command: but every general appointed to serve under him was politically  opposed to the chief, and several were personally hostile.    General Scott reached Brazos Santiago or Point Isabel, at the mouth of  the Rio Grande, late in December, 1846, and proceeded at once up the  river to Camargo, where he had written General Taylor to meet him.  Taylor, however, had gone to, or towards Tampico, for the purpose of  establishing a post there.  He had started on this march before he was  aware of General Scott being in the country.  Under these circumstances  Scott had to issue his orders designating the troops to be withdrawn  from Taylor, without the personal consultation he had expected to hold  with his subordinate.    General Taylor's victory at Buena Vista, February 22d, 23d, and 24th,  1847, with an army composed almost entirely of volunteers who had not  been in battle before, and over a vastly superior force numerically,  made his nomination for the Presidency by the Whigs a foregone  conclusion.  He was nominated and elected in 1848.  I believe that he  sincerely regretted this turn in his fortunes, preferring the peace  afforded by a quiet life free from abuse to the honor of filling the  highest office in the gift of any people, the Presidency of the United  States.    When General Scott assumed command of the army of invasion, I was in the  division of General David Twiggs, in Taylor's command; but under the new  orders my regiment was transferred to the division of General William  Worth, in which I served to the close of the war.  The troops withdrawn  from Taylor to form part of the forces to operate against Vera Cruz,  were assembled at the mouth of the Rio Grande preparatory to embarkation  for their destination.  I found General Worth a different man from any I  had before served directly under.  He was nervous, impatient and  restless on the march, or when important or responsible duty confronted  him.  There was not the least reason for haste on the march, for it was  known that it would take weeks to assemble shipping enough at the point  of our embarkation to carry the army, but General Worth moved his  division with a rapidity that would have been commendable had he been  going to the relief of a beleaguered garrison.  The length of the  marches was regulated by the distances between places affording a supply  of water for the troops, and these distances were sometimes long and  sometimes short.  General Worth on one occasion at least, after having  made the full distance intended for the day, and after the troops were  in camp and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4376"],[0,"Sowing Seeds in Danny (#15)"],[1,"wrapped up in Browning as to be insensible to a good salad either, I am  glad to say.    One night after we had company and everything had gone off well, Mr.  Francis came out into the kitchen, and looked over his glasses at me.  He opened his mouth twice to speak, but seemed to change his mind. I  knew what was struggling for utterance. Then he laid fifty cents on the  window sill, pointed at it, nodded to me, and went out hurriedly. My  first impulse was to hand it back--then I thought better of it--words  do not come easily to him. So he expressed himself in currency. I put  the money into my purse for a luck penny.    Mrs. Francis is as serene as a summer sea, and can look at you without  knowing you are there. Mr. Francis is a peaceful man, too. He looks at  his wife in a helpless way when she begins to explain the difference  between the Elizabethan and the Victorian poets--I don't believe he  cares a cent for either of them.    Mrs. Francis entertains quite a bit; I like it, too, and I do not go  and cry into the sink because I have to wait on the guests. She  entertains well and is a delightful hostess, but some of the people  whom she entertains do not appreciate her flights of fancy.    I do not like to see them wink at each other, although I know it is  funny to hear Mrs. Francis elaborate on the mother's influence in the  home and the proper way to deal with selfishness in children; but she  means well, and they should remember that, no matter how funny she gets.    April 18th.--She gave me a surprise to-day. She called me upstairs and  read to me a paper she was preparing to read before some society--she  belongs to three or four--on the domestic help problem. Well, it hadn't  very much to do with the domestic help problem, but of course I could  not tell her that so when she asked me what I thought of it I said:    \"If all employers were as kind as you and Mr. Francis there would be no  domestic help problem.\"    She looked at me suddenly, and something seemed to strike her. I  believe it came to her that I was a creature of like passions with  herself, capable of gratitude, perhaps in need of encouragement.  Hitherto I think she has regarded me as a porridge and coffee machine.    She put her arm around me and kissed me.    \"Camilla,\" she said gently--she has the softest, dreamiest voice I ever  heard--\"I believe in the aristocracy of brains and virtue. You have  both.\"    Farewell, oh Soulless Corporation! A long, last, lingering farewell,  for Camilla E. Rose, who used to sit upon the high stool and add  figures for you at ten dollars a week, is far away making toast for two  kindly souls, one of whom tells her she has brains and virtue and the  other one opens his mouth to speak, and then pushes fifty cents at her  instead.    Danny Watson, bless his heart! is bringing madam up. He has wound  himself into her heart and the \"whyness of the what\" is packing up to  go.    May 1st.--Mrs. Francis is going silly over Danny. A few days ago she  asked me if I could cut a pattern for a pair of pants. I told her I had  made pants once or twice and meekly inquired whom she wanted the pants  for. She said for a boy, of course--and she looked at me rather  severely. I knew they must be for Danny, and cut the pattern about the  size for him. She went into the sewing-room, and I only saw her at meal  times for two days. She wrestled with the garment.    Last night she asked me if I would take a parcel to Danny with her  love. I was glad to go, for I was just dying to see how she had got  along.    When I held them up before Mrs. Watson the poor woman gasped.    \"Save us all!\" she cried. \"Them'll fit none of us. We're poor, but,  thank God, we're not deformed!\"    I'll never forget the look of those pants. They haunt me still.    May 15th.--Pearl Watson is the sweetest and best little girl I know.  Her gratitude for even the smallest kindness makes me want to cry. She  told me the other day she was sure Danny was going to be a doctor. She  bases her hopes on the questions that Danny asks. How do you know you  haven't got a gizzard? How would you like to be ripped clean up the  back? and Where does your lap go to when you stand up? She said, \"Ma  and us all have hopes o' Danny.\"    Mrs. Francis has a new role, that of matchmaker, though I don't suppose  she knows it. She had Mary Barner and the young minister for tea  to-night. Mary grows dearer and sweeter every day. People say it is not  often one girl praises another; but Mary is a dear little gray-eyed  saint with the most shapely hands I ever saw. Reverend Hugh thinks so,  too, I have no doubt. It was really too bad to waste a good fruit salad  on him though, for I know he didn't know what he was eating. Excelsior  would taste like ambrosia to him if Mary sat opposite--all of which is  very much as it should be, I know. I thought for a while Mary liked Dr.  Clay pretty well, but I know it is not serious, for she talks quite  freely of him. She is very grateful to him for helping her so often  with her father. But those gray-eyed Scotch people never talk of what  is nearest the heart. I wonder if he knows that Mary Barner is a queen  among women. I don't like Scotchmen. They take too much for granted.        CHAPTER XIII    THE FIFTH SON    Arthur Wemyss, fifth son of the Reverend Alfred Austin Wemyss, Rector  of St. Agnes, Tilbury Road, County of Kent, England, had but recently  crossed the ocean. He and six hundred other fifth sons of rectors and  earls and dukes had crossed the ocean in the same ship and had been  scattered abroad over Manitoba and the Northwest Territories to be  instructed in agricultural pursuits by the honest granger, and  incidentally to furnish nutriment for the ever-ready mosquito or wasp,  who regarded all Old Country men as their lawful meat.    The honest granger was paid a sum varying between fifty and one hundred  fifty dollars for instructing one of these young fellows in farming for  one year, and although having an Englishman was known to be a pretty  good investment, the farmers usually spoke of them as they would of the  French-weed or the rust in the wheat. Sam Motherwell referred to his  quite often as \"that blamed Englishman\" and often said, unjustly, that  he was losing money on him every day.    Arthur--the Motherwells could not have told his other name--had learned  something since he came. He could pull pig-weed for the pigs and throw  it into the pen; he had learned to detect French-weed in the grain; he  could milk; he could turn the cream-separator; he could wash dishes and  churn, and he did it all with a willingness, a cheerfulness that would  have appealed favourably to almost any other farmer in the  neighbourhood, but the lines had fallen to Arthur in a stony place, and  his employer did not notice him at all unless to find fault with him.  Yet he bore it all with good humour. He had come to Canada to learn to  farm.    The only real grievance he had was that he could not get his \"tub.\" The  night he arrived, dusty and travel-stained after his long journey, he  had asked for his \"tub,\" but Mr. Motherwell had told him in language he  had never heard before--that there was no tub of his around the  establishment, that he knew of, and that he could go down and have a  dip in the river on Sunday if he wanted to. Then he had conducted him  with the lantern to his bed in the loft of the granary.    A rickety ladder led up to the bed, which was upon a temporary floor  laid about half way across the width of the granary. Bags of musty  smelling wheat stood at one end of this little room. Evidently Mr.  Motherwell wished to discourage sleep-walking in his hired help, for  the floor ended abruptly and a careless somnambulist would be  precipitated on the old fanning mill, harrow teeth and other debris  which littered the floor below.    The young Englishman reeled unsteadily going up the ladder. He could  still feel the chug-chug-chug of the ocean liner's engines and had to  hold tight to the ladder's splintered rungs to preserve his equilibrium.    Mr. Motherwell raised the lantern with sudden interest.    \"Say,\" he said, more cheerfully than he had yet spoken, \"you haven't  been drinking, have you?\"    \"Intoxicants, do you mean?\" the Englishman asked, without turning  around. \"No, I do not drink.\"    \"You didn't happen to bring anything over with you, did you, for  seasickness on the boat?\" Mr. Motherwell queried anxiously, holding the  lantern above his head.    \"No, I did not,\" the young man said laconically.    \"Turn out at five to-morrow morning then,\" his employer snapped in  evident disappointment, and he lowered the lantern so quickly that it  went out.    The young man lay down upon his hard bed. His utter weariness was a  blessing to him that night, for not even the racing mice, the musty  smells or the hardness of his straw bed could keep him from slumber.    In what seemed to him but a few minutes, he was awakened by a loud  knocking on the door below, voices shouted, a dog barked, cow-bells  jangled; he could hear doors banging everywhere, a faint streak of  sunlight lay wan and pale on the mud-plastered walls.    \"By Jove!\" he said yawning, \"I know now what Kipling meant when he said  'the dawn comes up like thunder.'\"    A few weeks after Arthur's arrival, Mrs. Motherwell called him from the  barn, where he sat industriously mending bags, to unhitch her horse  from the buggy. She had just driven home from Millford. Nobody had  taken the trouble to show Arthur how it was done.    \"Any fool ought to know,\" Mr. Motherwell said.    Arthur came running from the barn with his hat in his hand. He grasped  the horse firmly by the bridle and led him toward the barn. As they  came near the water trough the horse began to show signs of thirst.  Arthur led him to the trough, but the horse tossed his head and was  unable to get it near the water on account of the check.    Arthur watched him a few moments"]]]
