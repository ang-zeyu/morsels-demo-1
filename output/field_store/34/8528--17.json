The 4-7 finely speckled eggs are laid as early as March,  and several broods are raised.      AMERICAN CROSSBILL    _Loxia curvirostra minor. Case 2 Figs. 49, 50_              Crossbills have the mandibles crossed; the absence            of wing-bars distinguishes this species from the            usually less common White-winged Crossbill. L.            6-1/4.              _Range._ Nests from northern New England to Canada            and southward in the Alleghanies to northern            Georgia. Winters irregularly southward, rarely as            far as Florida and Louisiana.              Washington, irregular W.V., sometimes abundant.            Ossining, irregular; noted in almost every month.            Cambridge, of common but irregular occurrence at            all seasons. N. Ohio, irregular, often common,            sometimes breeds. Glen Ellyn, uncommon and            irregular, Oct. 20-June 11. SE. Minn., W.V., Oct.            25.    Crossbills and Grosbeaks are among winter's chief attractions. While the  latter, as I have said above, will leave their summer homes in  coniferous forests to feed in winter on the seeds of deciduous trees,  the Crossbills are less adaptable. They are specialists in  cone-dissecting. Their singularly shaped bills prevent them from eating  many kinds of food available to other birds, but no other birds can  compete with them in extracting the seeds from cones. Having had too  limited an experience with man to have learned to fear him, they are so  surprisingly tame that I have known birds to be plucked from trees as  one would pick off the cones on which they were feeding. In March, while  the ground is still snow-covered, they lay 3-4 pale greenish, spotted  eggs in a well-formed nest, 15-30 feet up in a coniferous tree.      WHITE-WINGED CROSSBILL    _Loxia leucoptera. Case 2, Figs. 51, 52_              Both sexes have white wing-bars and the male is of            a paler, more rosy red than the male of the            American Crossbill.              _Range._ Nests from northern New England to            Canada; winters irregularly to southern Illinois            and North Carolina.              Washington, casual. Ossining, rare T.V., Oct.            29-Dec. 6, Cambridge, irregular W.V. N. Ohio, rare            W.V. Glen Ellyn, rare, fall records only, Nov. SE.            Minn., W.V., latest record Mch. 4.    A rarer bird than the American Crossbill which, however, it resembles in  habits. Both climb about the branches of cone-bearing trees like little  Parrots, while feeding keep up a low conversational chatter, and take  wing with a clicking note. They have been found nesting in Nova Scotia  as early as February 6.      REDPOLL    _Acanthis linaria linaria. Case 2. Figs. 47, 48_              Any little sparrow-like bird with a red cap is a            Redpoll. Adult males have the breast also red. L.            5-1/2.              _Range._ Nests in Canada and Alaska; winters            irregularly south ward to Ohio and Virginia.              Washington, very rare and irregular W.V. Ossining,            regular W.V., Nov. 25-Mch. 26. Cambridge,            irregular W.V., often very abundant, Oct. 25-Apl.            10. N. Ohio, rare W.V. Glen Ellyn, irregular W.V.,            Nov. 6-Mch. 7. SE. Minn., common W.V., Oct.            31-Apl. 7.    A winter visitor from the far North whose coming never can be foretold.  Years may pass without seeing them, then late some fall, they may appear  in numbers. They are usually in flocks and feed upon seeds as well as  birch and alder catkins. In notes and general habits the Redpoll  resembles the Goldfinch.    Holboell's Redpoll (_A. holboelli_) is a slightly larger race, with  a longer, more slender bill. It is a more northern form than the  preceding, and rarely visits the United States. The Greater Redpoll (_A.  l. rostrata_) is also larger than the common Redpoll, but has a shorter,  stouter bill. It nests in Greenland and is of casual occurrence in the  northern United States. The Hoary Redpoll (_A. hornemanni exilipes_) is  a whiter bird than the preceding with no streaks on the rump and  comparatively few on the underparts. It nests within the Arctic Circle  and rarely visits the northern United States in winter.    Satisfactory identification of these races of the Redpoll can be made  only by expert examination of specimens. The field student, however, may  call any Redpoll he sees the Common Redpoll with the chances of being  right largely in his favor.      GOLDFINCH    _Astragalinus tristis tristis. Case 2. Figs. 35, 36; Case 4, Figs. 50,  51_              While he wears his 'Goldfinch' costume, the male            will be known at a glance, but in winter, when he            takes the dull yellow-olive dress of his mate,            several glances may be required to recognize him,            and this remark, of course, applies to the female            at all seasons. L. 5.              _Range._ North America; the eastern form nests            from Arkansas and northern Georgia to Canada and            winters from the Northern to the Gulf States.              Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R.            Cambridge, very common P.R. N. Ohio, common P.R.            Glen Ellyn, common P.R. SE. Minn., P.R., common in            summer, uncommon in winter.    A beautiful, musical, cheerful bird, as sweet of disposition as he is of  voice. To hear a merry troop of Goldfinches singing their spring chorus  is to hear the very spirit of the season set to music. Their call-note  is a questioning _dearie, dearie_, their flight-call _per-chie-o-ree,  per-chie-o-ree_, as in long undulations they swing through the air.  Their song is suggestive of a Canary's. They are late housekeepers, not  nesting before the latter half of June, when 3-6 pale bluish white eggs  are laid in a nest warmly lined with plant down.      PINE SISKIN    _Spinus pinus pinus. Case 2. Fig. 55_              A streaked, sparrow-like bird, with yellow            markings in wings and tail which show in flight.            L. 5.              _Range._ North America; nests from northern New            England north to Canada and in the mountains,            south to North Carolina; in winter southward to            the Gulf States.              Washington, irregularly abundant W.V., Oct. 24-May            20. Ossining, irregular P.R. Cambridge, irregular            W.V., Oct. 15-May 10; sometimes very abundant; one            breeding record. N. Ohio, tolerably common W.V.,            Sept. 20-May 15. Glen Ellyn, irregular T.V., Apl.            8-May 24; Sept. 8-Nov. 29. SE. Minn., uncommon            T.V., and W.V. Oct. 20-Apl. 9.    The Siskin belongs in the group of winter visitants whose coming cannot  be foretold. Some years it is rare or wanting, others abundant, a flock  sometimes, containing several hundred birds. In general habits it  resembles the Goldfinch, feeding on weed seeds and catkins, particularly  of the alder, and on the seeds of conifers. The call-note is a high  _e-eep_; its song like that of the Goldfinch but less musical.      SNOW BUNTING    _Plectrophanes nivalis nivalis. Case 2, Fig. 57_              The prevailing tone of plumage is white,            particularly when the bird is on the wing; the            long, hind toe-nail should be noted. L. 6-3/4.              _Range._ Nests in Arctic regions, winters            irregularly south to Kansas and Virginia.              Washington, W.V., casual, one instance. Ossining,            irregular W.V., Oct. 25-Mch. 22. Cambridge, common            W.V., Nov. 1-Mch. 15; abundant in migrations. N.            Ohio, tolerably common W.V., Dec. 10-Mch. 15. SE.            Minn., common W.V., Oct. 9-Mch. 14.    Snow Buntings live in flocks and love open places, such as Horned Larks  frequent, and are often found with them in fields or along the shore.  Like the Horned Larks they are walkers, not hoppers, and like most  walkers, it is exceptional for them to perch in trees. Hoffman described  their notes as \"a high, sweet, though slightly mournful _tee_, or  _tee-oo_, a sweet rolling whistle, and a harsh _bzz_.\"      LAPLAND LONGSPUR    _Calcarius lapponicus lapponicus_              A sparrow-like bird, with reddish brown wings, a            black or blackish breast, white, streaked            underparts and a brownish back. L. 6-1/4.              _Range._ Nests in Arctic regions, wintering            southward, rarely and irregularly in the Atlantic            States, to New York (casually South Carolina) and            more commonly in the Mississippi Valley to Ohio            and Texas.              Washington, W.V. one instance, Dec. Ossining.            W.V., casual, Cambridge, one record. N. Ohio,            tolerably common W.V., Nov. 15-Apl. 25. Glen            Ellyn, common W.V., Oct. 16-May 16. SE. Minn.,            common W.V.    [Illustration: LAPLAND LONGSPUR.    Adult male in summer. In winter the throat and breast are mixed black  and white.]    A rare visitor from the far North who, if we see it at all will probably  be found in the company of Horned Larks or Snow Buntings. It is a  browner bird than either of them, so while this is not a case of 'birds  of a feather' it _is_ a case of birds of a long hind toe-nail, since all  three are distinguished by having a toe-nail actually longer than its  toe. All three are walkers, which means also that they are ground-birds  rather than tree-birds, and the tracks they leave in the snow, or on the  beach, distinguish them from other birds if not from each other.
