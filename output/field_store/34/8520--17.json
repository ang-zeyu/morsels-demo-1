[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31078"],[0,"Curiosities of Literature, Vol. 3 (#15)"],[1,"to the  Italian proverb, _Accommodare le bisaccie nella strada_, 'To fit the  load on the journey:'\" it is taken from a custom of the mule-drivers,  who, placing their packages at first but awkwardly on the backs of their  poor beasts, and seeing them ready to sink, cry out, \"Never mind! we  must fit them better on the road!\" I was gratified to discover, by the  present and some other modern instances, that the taste for proverbs was  reviving, and that we were returning to those sober times, when the  aptitude of a simple proverb would be preferred to the verbosity of  politicians, Tories, Whigs, or Radicals!    There are domestic proverbs which originate in incidents known only to  the natives of their province. Italian literature is particularly rich  in these stores. The lively proverbial taste of that vivacious people  was transferred to their own authors; and when these allusions were  obscured by time, learned Italians, in their zeal for their national  literature, and in their national love of story-telling, have written  grave commentaries even on ludicrous, but popular tales, in which the  proverbs are said to have originated. They resemble the old facetious  _contes_, whose simplicity and humour still live in the pages of  Boccaccio, and are not forgotten in those of the Queen of Navarre.    The Italians apply a proverb to a person who while he is beaten, takes  the blows quietly:--      _Per beato ch' elle non furon pesche!_    Luckily they were not peaches!    And to threaten to give a man--      _Una pesca in un occhio._    A peach in the eye,    means to give him a thrashing. This proverb, it is said, originated in  the close of a certain droll adventure. The community of the Castle  Poggibonsi, probably from some jocular tenure observed on St. Bernard's  day, pay a tribute of peaches to the court of Tuscany, which are usually  shared among the ladies in waiting, and the pages of the court. It  happened one season, in a great scarcity of peaches, that the good  people of Poggibonsi, finding them rather dear, sent, instead of the  customary tribute, a quantity of fine juicy figs, which was so much  disapproved of by the pages, that as soon as they got hold of them, they  began in rage to empty the baskets on the heads of the ambassadors of  the Poggibonsi, who, in attempting to fly as well as they could from the  pulpy shower, half-blinded, and recollecting that peaches would have  had stones in them, cried out--      _Per beato ch' elle non furon pesche!_    Luckily they were not peaches!    _Fare le scalee di Sant' Ambrogio_; \"To mount the stairs of Saint  Ambrose,\" a proverb allusive to the business of the school of scandal.  Varchi explains it by a circumstance so common in provincial cities. On  summer evenings, for fresh air and gossip, the loungers met on the steps  and landing-places of the church of St. Ambrose: whoever left the party,  \"they read in his book,\" as our commentator expresses it; and not a leaf  was passed over! All liked to join a party so well informed of one  another's concerns, and every one tried to be the very last to quit  it,--not \"to leave his character behind!\" It became a proverbial phrase  with those who left a company, and were too tender of their backs, to  request they would not \"mount the stairs of St. Ambrose.\" Jonson has  well described such a company:      You are so truly fear'd, but not beloved    One of another, as no one dares break    Company from the rest, lest they should fall    Upon him absent.    There are legends and histories which belong to proverbs; and some of  the most ancient refer to incidents which have not always been  commemorated. Two Greek proverbs have accidentally been explained by  Pausanias: \"He is a man of Tenedos!\" to describe a person of  unquestionable veracity; and \"To cut with the Tenedian axe;\" to express  an absolute and irrevocable refusal. The first originated in a king of  Tenedos, who decreed that there should always stand behind the judge a  man holding an axe, ready to execute justice on any one convicted of  falsehood. The other arose from the same king, whose father having  reached his island, to supplicate the son's forgiveness for the injury  inflicted on him by the arts of a step-mother, was preparing to land;  already the ship was fastened by its cable to a rock; when the son came  down, and sternly cutting the cable with an axe, sent the ship adrift to  the mercy of the waves: hence, \"to cut with the Tenedian axe,\" became  proverbial to express an absolute refusal. \"Business to-morrow!\" is  another Greek proverb, applied to a person ruined by his own neglect.  The fate of an eminent person perpetuated the expression which he  casually employed on the occasion. One of the Theban polemarchs, in the  midst of a convivial party, received despatches relating to a  conspiracy: flushed with wine, although pressed by the courier to open  them immediately, he smiled, and in gaiety laying the letter under the  pillow of his couch, observed, \"Business to-morrow!\" Plutarch records  that he fell a victim to the twenty-four hours he had lost, and became  the author of a proverb which was still circulated among the Greeks.    The philosophical antiquary may often discover how many a proverb  commemorates an event which has escaped from the more solemn monuments  of history, and is often the solitary authority of its existence. A  national event in Spanish history is preserved by a proverb. _Y vengar  quiniento sueldos_; \"And revenge five hundred pounds!\" An odd expression  to denote a person being a gentleman! but the proverb is historical. The  Spaniards of Old Castile were compelled to pay an annual tribute of five  hundred maidens to their masters, the Moors; after several battles, the  Spaniards succeeded in compromising the shameful tribute, by as many  pieces of coin: at length the day arrived when they entirely emancipated  themselves from this odious imposition. The heroic action was performed  by men of distinction, and the event perpetuated in the recollections of  the Spaniards by this singular expression, which alludes to the  dishonourable tribute, was applied to characterise all men of high  honour, and devoted lovers of their country.    Pasquier, in his _Recherches sur la France_, reviewing the periodical  changes of ancient families in feudal times, observes, that a proverb  among the common people conveys the result of all his inquiries; for  those noble houses, which in a single age declined from nobility and  wealth to poverty and meanness, gave rise to the proverb, _Cent ans  bannieres et cent ans civieres!_ \"One hundred years a banner and one  hundred years a barrow!\" The Italian proverb, _Con l'Evangilio si  diventa heretico_, \"With the gospel we become heretics,\"--reflects the  policy of the court of Rome; and must be dated at the time of the  Reformation, when a translation of the Scriptures into the vulgar tongue  encountered such an invincible opposition. The Scotch proverb, _He that  invented the maiden first hanselled it_; that is, got the first of it!  The maiden is that well-known beheading engine, revived by the French  surgeon Guillotine. This proverb may be applied to one who falls a  victim to his own ingenuity; the artificer of his own destruction! The  inventor was James, Earl of Morton, who for some years governed  Scotland, and afterwards, it is said, very unjustly suffered by his own  invention. It is a striking coincidence, that the same fate was shared  by the French reviver; both alike sad examples of disturbed times! Among  our own proverbs a remarkable incident has been commemorated; _Hand over  head, as the men took the Covenant!_ This preserves the manner in which  the Scotch covenant, so famous in our history, was violently taken by  above sixty thousand persons about Edinburgh, in 1638; a circumstance at  that time novel in our own revolutionary history, and afterwards  paralleled by the French in voting by \"acclamation.\" An ancient English  proverb preserves a curious fact concerning our coinage. _Testers are  gone to Oxford, to study at Brazennose._ When Henry the Eighth debased  the silver coin, called _testers_, from their having a head stamped on  one side; the brass, breaking out in red pimples on their silver faces,  provoked the ill-humour of the people to vent itself in this punning  proverb, which has preserved for the historical antiquary the popular  feeling which lasted about fifty years, till Elizabeth reformed the  state of the coinage. A northern proverb among us has preserved the  remarkable idea which seems to have once been prevalent, that the  metropolis of England was to be the city of York; _Lincoln was, London  is, York shall be!_ Whether at the time of the union of the crowns,  under James the First, when England and Scotland became Great Britain,  this city, from its centrical situation, was considered as the best  adapted for the seat of government, or for some other cause which I have  not discovered, this notion must have been prevalent to have entered  into a proverb. The chief magistrate of York is the only provincial one  who is allowed the title of Lord Mayor; a circumstance which seems  connected with this proverb.    The Italian history of its own small principalities, whose well-being so  much depended on their prudence and sagacity, affords many instances of  the timely use of a proverb. Many an intricate negotiation has been  contracted through a good-humoured proverb,--many a sarcastic one has  silenced an adversary; and sometimes they have been applied on more  solemn, and even tragical occasions. When Rinaldo degli Albizzi was  banished by the vigorous conduct of Cosmo de' Medici, Machiavel tells us  the expelled man sent Cosmo a menace, in a proverb, _La gallina covava!_  \"The hen is brooding!\" said of one meditating vengeance. The undaunted  Cosmo replied by another, that \"There was no brooding out of the nest!\"    I give an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31103"],[0,"A Christmas Greeting: A Series of Stories (#15)"],[1,"  wonderfully long beard, which was more red than white, and he bowed to  the ground, and asked the old lady whether he might dust her shoes.  And Karen stretched out her little foot.    \"See! what beautiful dancing-shoes!\" said the soldier, \"sit firm when  you dance;\" and he put his hand out towards the soles.    And the old lady gave the old soldier an alms, and went into the  church with Karen.    And all the people in the church looked at Karen's red shoes, and all  the pictures, and as Karen knelt before the altar, and raised the cup  to her lips, she only thought of the red shoes, and they seemed to  swim in it; and she forgot to sing her psalm, and she forgot to pray,  \"Our father in Heaven!\"    Now all the people went out of church, and the old lady got into her  carriage. Karen raised her foot to get in after her, when the old  soldier said,    \"Look, what beautiful dancing shoes!\"    And Karen could not help dancing a step or two, and when she began her  feet continued to dance; it was just as though the shoes had power  over them. She danced round the church corner, she could not leave  off; the coachman was obliged to run after and catch hold of her, and  he lifted her in the carriage, but her feet continued to dance so that  she trod on the old lady dreadfully. At length she took the shoes off,  and then her legs had peace.    The shoes were placed in a closet at home, but Karen could not avoid  looking at them.    Now the old lady was sick, and it was said she could not recover? She  must be nursed and waited upon, and there was no one whose duty it was  so much as Karen's. But there was a great ball in the city, to which  Karen was invited. She looked, at the old lady, who could not recover,  she looked at the red shoes, and she thought there could be no sin in  it;--she put on the red shoes, she might do that also, she thought.  But then she went to the ball and began to dance.    When she wanted to dance to the right, the shoes would dance to the  left, and when she wanted to dance up the room, the shoes danced back  again, down the steps, into the street, and out of the city gate. She  danced, and was forced to dance straight out into the gloomy wood.    Then it was suddenly light up among the trees, and she fancied it must  be the moon, for there was a face; but it was the old soldier with the  red beard; he sate there, nodded his head, and said, \"Look, what  beautiful dancing shoes!\"    Then she was terrified, and wanted to fling off the red shoes, but  they clung fast; and she pulled down her stockings, but the shoes  seemed to have grown to her feet. And she danced, and must dance, over  fields and meadows, in rain and sunshine, by night and day; but at  night it was the most fearful.    She danced over the churchyard, but the dead did not dance,--they had  something better to do than to dance. She wished to seat herself on a  poor man's grave, where the bitter tansy grew; but for her there was  neither peace nor rest; and when she danced towards the open church  door, she saw an angel standing there. He wore long, white garments;  he had wings which reached from his shoulders to the earth; his  countenance was severe and grave; and in his hand he held a sword,  broad and glittering.    \"Dance shalt thou!\" said he,--\"dance in thy red shoes till thou art  pale and cold! Till thy skin shrivels up and thou art a skeleton!  Dance shalt thou from door to door, and where proud, vain children  dwell, thou shalt knock, that they may hear thee and tremble! Dance  shalt thou------!\"    \"Mercy!\" cried Karen. But she did not hear the angel's reply, for the  shoes carried her through the gate into the fields, across roads and  bridges, and she must keep ever dancing.    One morning she danced past a door which she well knew. Within sounded  a psalm; a coffin, decked with flowers, was borne forth. Then she knew  that the old lady was dead, and felt that she was abandoned by all,  and condemned by the angel of God.    She danced, and she was forced to dance through the gloomy night. The  shoes carried her over stack and stone; she was torn till she bled;  she danced over the heath till she came to a little house. Here, she  knew, dwelt the executioner; and she tapped with her fingers at the  window, and said, \"Come out! come out! I cannot come in, for I am  forced to dance!\"    And the executioner said, \"Thou dost not know who I am, I fancy? I  strike bad people's heads off; and I hear that my axe rings!\"    \"Don't strike my head off!\" said Karen, \"then I can't repent of my  sins! But strike off my feet in the red shoes!\"    And then she confessed her entire sin, and the executioner struck off  her feet with the red shoes, but the shoes danced away with the little  feet across the field into the deep wood.    And he carved out little wooden feet for her, and crutches, taught her  the psalm criminals always sing; and she kissed the hand which had  wielded the axe, and went over the heath.    \"Now I have suffered enough for the red shoes!\" said she; \"now I will  go into the church that people may see me!\" And she hastened towards  the church door: but when she was near it, the red shoes danced before  her, and she was terrified, and turned round. The whole week she was  unhappy, and wept many bitter tears; but when Sunday returned, she  said, \"Well, now I have suffered and struggled enough! I really  believe I am as good as many a one who sits in the church, and holds  her head so high!\"    And away she went boldly; but she had not got farther than the  churchyard gate before she saw the red shoes dancing before her; and  she was frightened, and turned back, and repented of her sin from her  heart.    And she went to the parsonage, and begged that they would take her  into service; she would be very industrious, she said, and would do  everything she could; she did not care about the wages, only she  wished to have a home, and be with good people. And the clergyman's  wife was sorry for her and took her into service; and she was  industrious and thoughtful. She sate still and listened when the  clergyman read the Bible in the evenings. All the children thought a  deal of her; but when they spoke of dress, and grandeur, and beauty,  she shook her head.    The following Sunday, when the family was going to church, they asked  her whether she would not go with them; but she glanced sorrowfully,  with tears in her eyes, at her crutches. The family went to hear the  word of God; but she went alone into her little chamber; there was  only room for a bed and chair to stand in it; and here she sate down  with her prayer-book; and whilst she read with a pious mind, the wind  bore the strains of the organ towards her, and she raised her tearful  countenance, and said, \"O God, help me!\"    And the sun shone so clearly! and straight before her stood the angel  of God in white garments, the same she had seen that night at the  church door; but he no longer carried the sharp sword, but in its  stead a splendid green spray, full of roses. And he touched the  ceiling with the spray, and the ceiling rose so high, and where he had  touched it there gleamed a golden star. And he touched the walls, and  they widened out, and she saw the organ which was playing; she saw the  old pictures of the preachers and the preachers' wives. The  congregation sat in cushioned seats, and sang out of their  prayer-books. For the church itself had come to the poor girl in her  narrow chamber, or else she had come into the church. She sate in the  pew with the clergyman's family, and when they had ended the psalm and  looked up, they nodded and said, \"It is right that thou art come!\"    \"It was through mercy!\" she said.    And the organ pealed, and the children's voices in the choir sounded  so sweet and soft! The clear sunshine streamed so warmly through the  window into the pew where Karen sate! Her heart was so full of  sunshine, peace, and joy, that it broke. Her soul flew on the sunshine  to God, and there no one asked after the Red Shoes.        ------------        TO THE YOUNG READERS    Here is another volume of Andersen's charming stories for you; and I  am sure you will be glad to get it. For my part, I am always delighted  to find one that I do not happen to have yet seen; and as I know the  others pleased you--for I have heard so, both directly and indirectly,  from a great many people, there can be no doubt that you all will be  overjoyed to have a few more of these stories told you.    And there is no one who participates in this delight more than--whom  do you think? Why, than Andersen himself! He is so happy that his  Tales have been thus joyfully received, and that they have found their  way to the hearts and sympathies of you all. He speaks of it with  evident pleasure; and it is not vanity, but his kind affectionate  nature, which inclines him to mention such little occurrences as prove  how firm a hold his writings have taken on the minds of the young and  gentle-natured. \"So much praise might,\" he says, \"spoil a man, and  make him vain. Yet no, it does not spoil him: on the contrary, it  makes him better; it purifies his thoughts, and this must give one the  impulse and the will to deserve it all.\" He was so pleased to hear,  and I, you may be sure, was equally pleased to tell him, what had been  written to me by a friend a short time before--that several little  boys and girls, Miss Edgeworth's nephews and nieces were so delighted  with the \"**Tales From Denmark**,\" that they not only read and re-read  them continually, but used _to act the stories_ together in their  play-hours!    And a certain little dark-eyed thing of my acquaintance, \"little  Nelly,\" or \"the little gipsey,\" as I sometimes call her, knows the  whole story of \"Ellie and the Pretty Swallow,\" by heart; and another  \"wee thing,\" that cannot yet read, but is always wanting to have  stories told her, knows all about Kay and Gerda, and the  flower-garden,"]]]
