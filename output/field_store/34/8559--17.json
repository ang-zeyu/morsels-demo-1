The trails are  traveled more in the spring and summer than in the fall.    Bears are very fond of fish, and in the north, when fish are in the  streams, spawning, the bears spend much of their time fishing, at the  foot of the falls. The sucker is the first fish to spawn, and as soon  as they are gone, the pike come, and the bears fare well for a couple  of weeks. After that they feed on the leaves of the poplar, insects,  berries and nuts, and whatever meat they can find. In some sections  they remain in the same locality during the entire year; in other  places they migrate on the approach of cold weather and do not return  until spring.    The bear becomes prime about the first to the fifteenth of November,  and remains in good condition until late in the spring. In northern  sections they do not commence shedding until June fifteenth, and  sometimes even later. The best time to trap them is in the spring  just after the snow is gone, but many are trapped in the fall.    The traps for black bears are the Nos. 5 and 15 and the Nos. 50 and  150 Newhouse. For larger bears the No. 6 is the trap to use, although  many grizzly bears are caught in the No. 5.    The most common method for trapping bears is the following: Make a  sort of enclosure of old logs, brush, etc., in the form of a V, about  eight feet long and two or three feet wide at the entrance. It should  be three feet high, behind, but it is not necessary to have it so  high in front. The bait should be fastened in the back of the pen,  and the trap set in the entrance.    Take a small, springy stick, about eight inches long, and spring it  under the pan of the trap, to prevent small animals from being  caught. To do this, stick one end firmly in the ground, and bend the  other end down, and hook it under the pan. The trap when set, should  support a weight of twenty-five pounds, but it is my opinion that  most trappers allow the trap to spring too easily.    Always turn the loose jaw up, and work from in under, for the sake of  safety. Now drive down a couple of stakes on each side of the trap,  so as to leave only a narrow passage; cover the trap with leaves or  moss. It is a good idea to put a good sized piece of moss over the  pan. To cause the bear to step in the center of the trap, some  trappers put sharp sticks around the outside of the jaws, others lay  a stick across the mouth of the pen, about six or eight inches high,  and close up to the jaws. In stepping over it, the bear is more  likely to put his foot in the trap. The trap should be fastened to a  heavy clog of hardwood. For the Black bear, the clog should be about  six or seven feet long, and just small enough to go through the ring  on the chain. The ring should be slipped on to the middle and  fastened with a spike. For the grizzly and other large bears, the  clog should be larger.    This is the best method, but if you nip a bear once, you will have to  try some other method, and it is not likely that you will catch him,  even then, as they become very cunning. Do not set the trap at the  same place, but find his trail, and make a blind set; preferably  where the trail leads through a pool of water. Of course you must be  sure that no person will travel on the trail. Some trappers prefer to  hang a bait about six feet above the trap and do not use any pen.    Bears may also be trapped successfully with snares and deadfalls but  the objection to these traps is that the animal is killed instantly  and if the traps are not visited daily, the skin is likely to spoil.    For bait, there is nothing better than fish, but pork, (either salt  or fresh), mutton, beef or any kind of large game is good. Even the  flesh of the bear makes fair bait. Beaver, otter or muskrat meat is  also good. Honey is very attractive.    There are a number of scents that are attractive to the bear, such as  fish oil, oil of anise and beaver castor. The scent recommended for  the raccoon is good for the bear.    The track of the bear is easily distinguished from that of other  animals, because of its large size. Ordinarily, the bear's mode of  locomotion is a shuffling walk. The footprints of a large black bear  will measure about eight inches in length.      [Illustration: The Raccoon.]        CHAPTER XIII.    THE RACCOON.    The raccoon is allied to the bear family. It is found only on the  Western Continent, where it is represented by two species; the common  raccoon of the United States and the crab-eating raccoon of the  tropics. The common raccoon, called coon by the hunters and trappers,  is found throughout the Mississippi Valley and all of the states east  and also in the Pacific Coast states, Western British Columbia, Lower  Ontario, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. They are found in greatest  numbers in those states bordering on the Gulf of Mexico.    The common raccoon is the one of principal interest to the trapper  and fur dealer. The body is short and stout, like that of the badger.  Its head resembles that of the fox. Its tail is ten or twelve inches  long, thick and bushy. The feet are bare and the toes long. The  general color is grey, the tips of the hairs being darker.  Occasionally a very dark one is found, in some cases being almost  black. The tail is ringed with black and a black band crosses the  eyes. The raccoon is a nocturnal animal, is omnivorous and hibernates  during cold weather, coming out in search of food only on warm  nights.    This food consists of green corn, grapes and other fruits, fish,  frogs, clams, birds and their eggs and they are also fond of poultry.  In search of food, they travel mostly along the streams and in early  fall, in the corn fields.    They den in hollow trees, having an entrance at a considerable  distance from the ground. In mountainous districts, they also den in  holes among the rocks.    The young are born in April and May and from two to six are brought  forth at a time. Their mating season is generally about the last of  February and the beginning of March, and at this time the males  travel considerably, crawling into a hollow tree wherever daylight  overtakes them.    In the North they become prime about November 1st; the season being  later in the South. They remain in good condition until late in the  spring. The fur is used mostly for coats and robes.    The nature and habits of the raccoon, like all other animals differs  considerably in different localities. In most sections they are very  easily trapped, but those found in some parts of the Pacific Coast  are said to be quite cunning. Any of the articles of food mentioned  above, will make good bait; fresh fish however, being preferred. The  traps to use are the No. 1 1/2 Newhouse or Hawley & Norton, the No. 2  Victor, and the Nos. 2 and 3 Oneida Jump and Blake & Lamb traps. The  trap should be fastened to a clog, and in some cases an iron drag  could be used to advantage, as the coon will get fastened up on the  first brush he comes to.    The most common method is to set the trap in the entrance of a pen of  stakes, at the edge of the water where the animals travel. The trap  may be set dry or under water, as preferred, and the bait should be  placed in the back of the pen.    Another very good method, much used in the South, is to fasten a  piece of bright tin or a piece of a white dish, on the pan of the  trap and set the trap under about two inches of water, near the bank.  No bait is used, but a little scent may be used on the bank to good  advantage.    The Southern Trappers sometimes find a tree, stump or rock in the  edge of the water, and set the trap in the water, just where the  'coon will walk, when passing around the obstruction. A fence made of  brush will answer the same purpose.    Where the bank is steep and the water is shallow, dig a six inch  hole, straight into the bank at the edge of the water. Fasten some  bait in the back of the hole and set the trap in the water, directly  in front of the hole.    Where coons are visiting a corn field, find where they go through the  fence and you will sometimes find a well beaten trail. Set the trap  in the trail, covered, and fasten to a clog.    If you find a log lying across the stream and there are signs of  'coons about, cut a notch in the top of the log and set the trap in  the notch, covering with rotten wood or moss. You are likely to catch  a fox in a set of this kind.    When a den tree can be found, cut a pole five or six feet long and  six inches thick; lean it against the tree and set the trap on the  pole. Cover the trap lightly with moss and staple to the tree.    Any natural enclosure along a stream, such as a hollow log or a hole  under a stump, makes a good place to set a trap. When trapping for  foxes with water sets, many coons will be caught in the traps.    One of the best scents for 'coon is made as follows: To a pint of  fish oil, add twenty or thirty drops of oil of anise and two ounces  of strained honey. Pure fish oil is used by some trappers and beaver  castor, muskrat musk and oil of anise are also good.    The trail of the raccoon is somewhat like that of the mink, but the  tracks are larger. The animal makes the print of the entire foot and  the long slender toes show plainly. The print of the hind foot will  be from two and a quarter to three inches in length.      [Illustration: The Badger.]        CHAPTER XIV.    THE BADGER.    Badgers are burrowing, carnivorous animals. They are found in North  America and various parts of the Old World; one species being found  in Europe, one in India and another in Japan. There are several  varieties of the American species and they are found at present only  west of the Mississippi River, although formerly they ranged as far  east as Ohio. They are perhaps most numerous on the High, dry plains  just east of the Rocky Mountains, and range from Mexico to well up "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/341"],[0,"Myths and Legends of the Sioux (#15)"],[1,"the black and the white horses with me and I will follow on  later, after I have seen what the trouble is.\"    \"Very well, my friend, I will do as you say, but I am afraid something  has happened to Pretty Feather.\" Hake started on with the horses,  driving them along the broad trail left by the hundreds of travois.  Chaske made slowly towards the tepee, and stopping outside, stood and  listened. Not a sound could he hear. The only living thing he saw was  Pretty Feather's spotted horse tied to the side of the tent. Then he  knew that she must be dead. He rode off into the thick brush and tied  his two horses securely. Then he came back and entered the tepee. There  on a bed of robes lay some one apparently dead. The body was wrapped  in blankets and robes and bound around and around with parfleche ropes.  These he carefully untied and unwound. Then he unwrapped the robes and  blankets and when he uncovered the face, he saw, as he had expected  to, the face of his lost love, Pretty Feather. As he sat gazing on her  beautiful young face, his heart ached for his poor friend. He himself  had loved and lost this beautiful maiden, and now his friend who had won  her would have to suffer the untold grief which he had suffered.    What was that? Could it have been a slight quivering of the nostrils  that he had seen, or was it mad fancy playing a trick on him? Closer  he drew to her face, watching intently for another sign. There it was  again, only this time it was a long, deep drawn breath. He arose, got  some water and taking a small stick slowly forced open her mouth and  poured some into it. Then he took some sage, dipped it into the water  and sprinkled a little on her head and face. There were many parfleche  bags piled around the tepee, and thinking he might find some kind of  medicine roots which he could use to revive her he started opening  them one after the other. He had opened three and was just opening  the fourth, when a voice behind him asked: \"What are you looking for?\"  Turning quickly, he saw Pretty Feather looking at him. Overjoyed, he  cried, \"What can I do so that you can get up and ride to the village  with me? My friend and I just returned with a large band of horses and  two scalps. We saw this tent and recognized it. My friend wanted to  come, but I would not let him, as I feared if he found anything had  happened to you he would do harm to himself, but now he will be anxious  for my return, so if you will tell me what you need in order to revive  you, I will get it, and we can then go to my friend in the village.\" \"At  the foot of my bed you will find a piece of eagle fat. Build a fire and  melt it for me. I will drink it and then we can go.\"    Chaske quickly started a fire, got out the piece of fat and melted it.  She drank it at one draught, and was about to arise when she suddenly  said: \"Roll me up quick and take the buffalo hair rope and tie it about  my spotted horse's neck; tie his tail in a knot and tie him to the door.  Then run and hide behind the trees. There are two of the enemy coming  this way.\"    Chaske hurriedly obeyed her orders, and had barely concealed himself  behind the trees, when there came into view two of the enemy. They saw  the horse tied to the door of the deserted tent, and knew that some dead  person occupied the tepee, so through respect for the dead, they turned  out and started to go through the brush and trees, so as not to pass the  door. (The Indians consider it a bad omen to pass by the door of a tepee  occupied by a dead body, that is, while in the enemy's country). So  by making this detour they traveled directly towards where Chaske was  concealed behind the tree. Knowing that he would be discovered, and  there being two of them, he knew the only chance he had was for him  to kill one of them before they discovered him, then he stood a better  chance at an even combat. On they came, little thinking that one of them  would in a few minutes be with his forefathers.    Chaske noiselessly slipped a cartridge into the chamber of his gun,  threw it into action and took deliberate aim at the smaller one's  breast. A loud report rang out and the one he had aimed at threw up his  arms and fell heavily forward, shot through the heart.    Reloading quickly Chaske stepped out from behind the tree. He could  easily have killed the other from his concealed position, but, being a  brave young man, he wanted to give his opponent a fair chance. The other  had unslung his gun and a duel was then fought between the two lone  combatants. They would spring from side to side like two great cats.  Then advance one or two steps and fire. Retreat a few steps, spring to  one side and fire again. The bullets whistled past their heads, tore up  the earth beneath their feet, and occasionally one would hit its mark,  only to cause a flesh wound.    Suddenly the enemy aimed his gun and threw it upon the ground. His  ammunition was exhausted, and slowly folding his arms he stood facing  his opponent, with a fearless smile upon his face, expecting the next  moment to fall dead from a bullet from the rifle of Chaske. Not  so. Chaske was too honorable and noble to kill an unarmed man, and  especially one who had put up such a brave fight as had this man. Chaske  advanced and picked up the empty gun. The Toka (enemy) drew from a  scabbard at his belt a long bowie knife, and taking it by the point  handed it, handle first, to Chaske. This signified surrender. Chaske  scalped the dead Toka and motioned for his prisoner to follow him. In  the meantime Pretty Feather had gotten up and stood looking at the duel.  When she heard the first shot she jumped up and cut a small slit in the  tent from which she saw the whole proceedings. Knowing that one or both  of them must be wounded, she hurriedly got water and medicine roots, and  when they came to the tent she was prepared to dress their wounds.    Chaske had a bullet through his shoulder and one through his hand. They  were very painful but not dangerous. The prisoner had a bullet through  his leg, also one through the muscle of his left arm. Pretty Feather  washed and dressed their wounds, and Chaske went and brought the black  and white horses and mounting Pretty Feather upon the white horse, and  the prisoner on her spotted one, the three soon rode into the village,  and there was a great cry of joy when it was known that Pretty Feather  had come back to them again.    Hake, who was in his tent grieving, was told that his friend had  returned and with him Pretty Feather. Hearing this good news he at  once went to the Medicine Man's tent and found the Medicine Man busily  dressing the wounds of his friend and a stranger. The old Medicine Man  turned to Hake and said:    \"Son-in-law, take your wife home with you. It was from grief at your  absence that she went into a trance, and we, thinking she was dead, left  her for such. Hadn't it been for your friend here, she would surely have  been a corpse now. So take her and keep her with you always, and take as  a present from me fifty of my best horses.\"    Hake and his beautiful bride went home, where his adopted mother had a  fine large tent put up for them. Presents of cooking utensils, horses,  robes and finely worked shawls and moccasins came from every direction,  and last of all Chaske gave as a present to his friend the Toka man whom  he had taken as prisoner. On presenting him with this gift, Chaske spoke  thus:    \"My friend, I present to you, that you may have him as a servant to  look after your large band of horses, this man with whom I fought a  two hours' duel, and had his ammunition lasted he would probably have  conquered me, and who gave me the second hardest fight of my life.  The hardest fight of my life was when I gave up Pretty Feather. You  have them both. To the Toka (enemy) be kind, and he will do all your  biddings. To Pretty Feather be a good husband.\"    So saying, Chaske left them, and true to his word, lived the remainder  of his days a confirmed bachelor.              THE STORY OF THE PET CROW    Once upon a time there came to a large village a plague of crows. So  thick were they that the poor women were sorely tried keeping them out  of their tepees and driving them away from their lines of jerked buffalo  meat. Indeed they got so numerous and were such a great nuisance that  the Chief finally gave orders to his camp criers or heralds to go out  among the different camps and announce the orders of their Chief, that  war should be made upon the crows to extermination; that their nests  were to be destroyed and all eggs broken. The war of extermination was  to continue until not a crow remained, except the youngest found was to  be brought to him alive.    For a week the war on the crows continued. Thousands of dead crows were  brought in daily, and at the end of the week not a bird of that species  could be seen in the neighborhood. Those that escaped the deadly arrow  of the warriors, flew away, never to return to those parts again.    At the end of the war made upon the crows, there was brought to the  Chief's tepee the youngest found. Indeed, so young was the bird that it  was only the great medicine of the Chief that kept him alive until he  could hop about and find his own food. The Chief spent most of his time  in his lodge teaching the young crow to understand and talk the language  of the tribe. After the crow had mastered this, the Chief then taught  him the languages of the neighboring tribes. When the crow had mastered  these different languages the chief would send him on long journeys to  ascertain the location of the camps of the different enemies.    When the crow would find a large Indian camp he would alight and hop  about, pretending to be picking up scraps, but really keeping his ears  open for anything he might hear. He would hang around all day, and at  night when they would all gather in the large council tent (which always  stood in "]]]
