The cadaverous stench revealed the presence of half-dried human  bones being carried by relatives and friends for interment in the sacred  \"City of the Silent.\" Thus dead bodies, in loosely nailed boxes, are  always traveling from one end of Persia to the other. Among the pilgrims  were blue and green turbaned Saids, direct descendants of the Prophet, as  well as white-turbaned mollas. All were sitting about on the _sakoo_, or  raised platform, just finishing the evening meal. But presently one of the  mollas ascended the mound in the middle of the stable-yard, and in the  manner of the muezzin called to prayer. All kneeled, and bowed their heads  toward Mecca. Then the horses were saddled, the long, narrow boxes  attached upright to the pack-mules, and the _kajacas_, or double boxes,  adjusted on the backs of the horses of the ladies. Into these the veiled  creatures entered, and drew the curtains, while the men leaped into the  saddle at a signal, and, with the tri-cornered flag at their head, the  cavalcade moved out on its long night pilgrimage. We now learned that the  village contained a _chappar khan_, one of those places of rest which have  recently been provided for the use of foreigners and others, who travel  _chappar_, or by relays of post-horses. These structures are usually  distinguished by a single room built on the roof, and projecting some  distance over the eaves.      [Illustration: IN A PERSIAN GRAVEYARD.]    To this we repaired at once. Its keeper evinced unusual pride in the  cleanliness of his apartments, for we were asked to take off our shoes  before entering. But while our boastful host was kicking up the mats to  convince us of the truth of his assertions, he suddenly retired behind the  scenes to rid himself of some of the pests.      [Illustration: PILGRIMS IN THE CARAVANSARY.]    Throughout our Asiatic tour eggs were our chief means of subsistence, but  _pillao_, or boiled rice flavored with grease, we found more particularly  used in Persia, like _yaourt_ in Turkey. This was prepared with chicken  whenever it was possible to purchase a fowl, and then we would usually  make the discovery that a Persian fowl was either wingless, legless, or  otherwise defective after being prepared by a Persian _fuzul_, or  foreigner's servant, who, it is said, \"shrinks from no baseness in order  to eat.\" Though minus these particular appendages, it would invariably  have a head; for the fanatical Shiah frequently snatched a chicken out of  our hands to prevent us from wringing or chopping its head off. Even after  our meal was served, we would keep a sharp lookout upon the unblushing  pilferers around us, who had called to pay their respects, and to fill the  room with clouds of smoke from their chibouks and gurgling kalians. For a  fanatical Shiah will sometimes stick his dirty fingers into the dishes of  an \"unbeliever,\" even though he may subsequently throw away the  contaminated vessel. And this extreme fanaticism is to be found in a  country noted for its extensive latitude in the profession of religious  beliefs.      [Illustration: A PERSIAN WINE-PRESS.]    A present from the village khan was announced. In stepped two men bearing  a huge tray filled with melons, apricots, sugar, rock-candy, nuts,  pistachios, etc., all of which we must, of course, turn over to the  khan-keeper and his servants, and pay double their value to the bearers,  as a present. This polite method of extortion was followed the next  morning by one of a bolder and more peremptory nature. Notwithstanding the  feast of the night before at our expense, and in addition to furnishing us  with bedclothes which we really ought to have been paid to sleep in, our  oily host now insisted upon three or four prices for his lodgings. We  refused to pay him more than a certain sum, and started to vacate the  premises. Thereupon he and his grown son caught hold of our bicycles.  Remonstrances proving of no avail, and being unable to force our passage  through the narrow doorway with the bicycles in our hands, we dropped  them, and grappled with our antagonists. A noisy scuffle, and then a heavy  fall ensued, but luckily we were both on the upper side. This unusual  disturbance now brought out the inmates of the adjoining _anderoon_. In a  moment there was a din of feminine screams, and a flutter of garments, and  then--a crashing of our pith helmets beneath the blows of pokers and  andirons. The villagers, thus aroused, came at last to our rescue, and at  once proceeded to patch up a compromise. This, in view of the Amazonian  reinforcements, who were standing by in readiness for a second onset, we  were more than pleased to accept. From this inglorious combat we came off  without serious injury; but with those gentle poker taps were knocked out  forever all the sweet delusions of the \"Light of the Harem.\"    The great antiquity of this Teheran-Meshed road, which is undoubtedly a  section of that former commercial highway between two of the most ancient  capitals in history--Nineveh and Balk, is very graphically shown by the  caravan ruts at Lasgird. These have been worn in many places to a depth of  four feet in the solid rock. It was not far beyond this point that we  began to feel the force of that famous \"Damghan wind,\" so called from the  city of that name. Of course this wind was against us. In fact, throughout  our Asiatic tour easterly winds prevailed; and should we ever attempt  another transcontinental spin we would have a care to travel in the  opposite direction.      [Illustration: CASTLE STRONGHOLD AT LASGIRD.]    Our peculiar mode of travel subjected us to great extremes in our mode of  living. Sometimes, indeed, it was a change almost from the sublime to the  ridiculous, and vice versa--from a stable or sheepfold, with a diet of figs  and bread, and an irrigating-ditch for a lavatory, to a palace itself, an  Oriental palace, with all the delicacies of the East, and a host of  servants to attend to our slightest wish. So it was at Bostam, the  residence of one of Persia's most influential _hakims_, or governors,  literally, \"pillars of state,\" who was also a cousin to the Shah himself.  This potentate we visited in company with an English engineer whom we met  in transit at Sharoud. It was on the evening before, when at supper with  this gentleman in his tent, that a special messenger arrived from the  governor, requesting us, as the invitation ran, \"to take our brightness  into his presence.\" As we entered, the governor rose from his seat on the  floor, a courtesy never shown us by a Turkish official. Even the politest  of them would, just at this particular moment, be conveniently engrossed  in the examination of some book or paper. His courtesy was further  extended by locking up our \"horses,\" and making us his \"prisoners\" until  the following morning. At the dinner which Mr. Evans and we were invited  to eat with his excellency, benches had to be especially prepared, as  there was nothing like a chair to be found on the premises. The governor  himself took his accustomed position on the floor, with his own private  dishes around him. From these he would occasionally fish out with his  fingers some choice lamb _kebabh_ or cabbage _dolmah_, and have it passed  over to his guests--an act which is considered one of the highest forms of  Persian hospitality.    With a shifting of the scenes of travel, we stood at sunset on the summit  of the Binalud mountains, overlooking the valley of the Kashafrud. Our two  weeks' journey was almost ended, for the city of Meshed was now in view,  ten miles away. Around us were piles of little stones, to which each pious  pilgrim adds his quota when first he sees the \"Holy Shrine,\" which we  beheld shining like a ball of fire in the glow of the setting sun.      [Illustration: PILGRIM STONE HEAPS OVERLOOKING MESHED.]    While we were building our pyramid a party of returning pilgrims greeted  us with \"Meshedi at last.\" \"Not yet,\" we answered, for we knew that the  gates of the Holy City closed promptly at twilight. Yet we determined to  make the attempt. On we sped, but not with the speed of the falling night.  Dusk overtook us as we reached the plain. A moving form was revealed to us  on the bank of the irrigating-canal which skirted the edge of the road.  Backward it fell as we dashed by, and then the sound of a splash and  splutter reached us as we disappeared in the darkness. On the morrow we  learned that the spirits of Hassan and Hussein were seen skimming the  earth in their flight toward the Holy City. We reached the bridge, and  crossed the moat, but the gates were closed. We knocked and pounded, but a  hollow echo was our only response. At last the light of a lantern  illumined the crevices in the weather-beaten doors, and a weird-looking  face appeared through the midway opening. \"Who's there?\" said a voice,  whose sepulchral tones might have belonged to the sexton of the Holy Tomb.  \"We are _Ferenghis_,\" we said, \"and must get into the city to-night.\"  \"That is impossible,\" he answered, \"for the gates are locked, and the keys  have been sent away to the governor's palace.\" With this the night air  grew more chill. But another thought struck us at once. We would send a  note to General McLean, the English consul-general, who was already  expecting us. This our interlocutor, for a certain _inam_, or Persian  bakshish, at length agreed to deliver. The general, as we afterward  learned, sent a servant with a special request to the governor's palace.  Here, without delay, a squad of horsemen was detailed, and ordered with  the keys to the \"Herat Gate.\" The crowds in the streets, attracted by this  unusual turnout at this unusual hour, followed in their wake to the scene  of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31162"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 5, No. 3, March, 1852 (#15)"],[1,"ricity, or his  fertile fancy. We know not if in the world's vast library there is any  reliable exhibition of such causes. Sir Walter Scott's imaginary  Clutterbuck, after some prefatory doubts, leaves the following as  perhaps his principal reason: \"This happy vacuity of all employment  appeared to me so delicious, that it became the primary hint, which,  according to the system of Helvetius, as the minister says, determined  my infant talents towards the profession I was destined to illustrate.\"  Such may be the idea of some at the present day, though Clutterbuck's  declaration is by no means sacred authority. He confesses he was  unmilitary enough to damn _reveille_, and also, to a significant rebuke  from his old colonel. \"I am no friend to extravagance, Ensign  Clutterbuck,\" said he, \"but on the day when we are to pass before the  sovereign of the kingdom, in the name of God, I would have at least  shown him an inch of clean linen.\" The truth is, the causes are about as  various as the trades they subscribe to, or, if one more than another be  predominant, it is \"the love of the thing.\" In the old countries, the  drum and fife mingled their music with the first pleasant scenes he ever  saw; and, in the new world, the same enlivening sounds also awoke the  spirit of childhood. Early associations had merely lain dormant for a  season, but those connected with the bright musket and sabre were  stronger than those of the spade and figure-maker's mould.    Having before us the roll of a company now in service, we will take from  it such information as may be pertinent, premising that the record is so  nearly like that of every other, that the little difference, as  mathematicians say, may be disregarded without affecting the general  result. Of the whole number (fifty), thirty-eight are between twenty and  thirty years of age, ten between thirty and forty, and two between forty  and forty-five. Five were born in England, three in Scotland, twenty-one  in Ireland, five in Germany, thirteen in the United States, two in  Prussia, and one in Italy. They subscribed, at the time of enlistment,  the following trades: five farmers, one spinner, twelve laborers, one  weaver, one tinsmith, one painter, two gardeners, three bakers, two  shoemakers, two tailors, one carpenter, one printer, one cigar-maker,  nine soldiers, four clerks, one turner, and one figure-maker (the  Italian); and one pretends to be a lawyer, though, as he may be an  imposter, we will have due regard for the sensitive feelings of our  legal friends, and set him down as only a pettifogger. Sixteen cannot  read or write, and of these, three are of the United States, and the  remainder nearly all from Ireland. It is quite a treat in chirography to  see the signatures of the residue of the fifty, as they stand in the  column. They are not so imposing as John Hancock's on the Declaration,  nor as small as a schoolmistress's copy; but assume all shapes and  styles, from the \"clerkly fist,\" to the genuine \"crow-track,\" or Chinese  characters on a tea-chest.    Be it as it may, after he swears to serve well and faithfully the United  States against all her enemies and opposers whatsoever, he is sent to  New-York harbor, if he is to do foot-work, or to Carlisle Barracks, if a  horse is to do it for him; and in one of these places the transformation  from civil to military life begins. In two hours after his arrival you  would hardly know him. With hair cut close, and a complete revolution in  his dress, he looks nothing like the \"sovereign\" of this mighty Republic  you have just seen. He feels the change, too; and as he struts up and  down, peacock-like, admiring himself, he realizes that hitherto, for  many years perhaps, he has not had a new suit from tip to toe all for  nothing. It has saved him weary days of toil, and the little personal  liberty he has given in exchange is but dust in the balance. As soon as  \"the vapors melt into morn,\" the drum sounds the _reveille_, and up he  rises to receive instructions, which are repeated and repeated until he  has them at his tongue's and fingers' ends. At all times, if  well-behaved, he receives the necessary recreations and indulgences. To  follow him closely throughout his tuition, would be to extend this  article more than is intended, besides outraging the military knowledge  of many by a recital of elementary instruction. Suffice it to say, after  a certain period, he is sent to some post on the sea-board, or to active  service on the frontier.    The term of enlistment varies in different countries. In England,  formerly, it extended to twenty-one years; but the law has lately  reduced it to ten. In our service it is for five years only, with the  privilege of re-enlisting, if at the end of that time the applicant is  still sound in body and mind. He then becomes an \"old soldier;\" a term  which, for some reason or other, is used in civil life with no  complimentary import. It has a better meaning in service, however, which  is well exemplified in the French proverb, \"_Il n'est chasse que de  vieux chiens_\" (old dogs are staunch hunters). The pay also varies, and  it is a feather in the cap of our Government that we may say she is in  this respect more liberal than any other. In France, Prussia, Germany,  Austria, and Russia, a private, with all economy, cannot save more than  six cents a-day; yet when we consider the vast number each is obliged to  keep under arms, we cannot suppose them able to pay more. England, whose  \"public debt is a public blessing,\" also looms up largely in the battle  array, and pays better than her neighbors. With her artillery-private  (or gunner as he is more properly called), we will compare a private of  the United States artillery, or infantry, since both are on a par in  this respect. The former receives one shilling fourpence farthing, or  thirty-three and one-half cents, per day, from which, deducting his  rations and clothing, there will be left thirteen and one-half cents, or  about four dollars per month. The latter receives seven dollars per  month, beside his rations and clothing. In the British infantry  regiments, the private has but one shilling per day, and the Queen  graciously allows him one penny of \"beer-money.\"    The artillery-company of England is perhaps the best organized and most  efficient in the world; while ours is merely nominal, and a sore subject  to the accomplished officers attached to it. It is called artillery, but  infantry is more appropriate. At nearly all the forts, the siege pieces  and implements of the artillerist are packed away in storehouses,  without a particle of benefit to those for whom they are intended. In  Mexico, on the march to Orizaba, it had the mortification to trudge  along on foot, while midshipmen commanded sections of a light battery,  marines were cannoneers, and sailors rode the horses, using, in their  amphibious state, the oddest medley of sea-terms and military jargon  that ever grated on professional ears. It would have been equally  proper to put an artillery captain in command of the frigate Cumberland  then lying in the harbor of Vera Cruz, with no less a prospect of  brilliant manoeuvres in the hour of battle. The English company is  really what it purports to be, and is one hundred and twenty strong,  including eight corporals and four bombardiers; besides, it has eight  serjeants, three buglers, one second and one first lieutenant, one  second captain (brevet-captain in our service), and one first captain.  The aggregate here is fifty-eight, not quite one-half of the British  company.    It will be seen, from what has been said, that the Greenwich dragoon, or  foot soldier, is, in five cases out of six, either a Dutchman, Irishman,  or American; and an observer can easily perceive in each his national  characteristic and temperament. Karl is dull and heavy, generally sober,  always ready to lend his pipe, or sing a song. Pat is merry, loves a  glass at any time, is handy with the spade, and uses his mother-wit in  rounding off a capital story. Jonathan is all these, and something more.  He astonishes his trans-atlantic comrades by the incomprehensible manner  in which the knave will turn up when he deals the \"pictures;\" and the  neat manner in which he mends the rent in his coat sleeve; is one short  of funds, he will generously lend him a safe amount until \"next pay  day,\" provided, at that time, fifty per cent. be added thereto; and, if  some doubt arises in the mean time, he disposes of his stock to some  other speculator; so that Wall-street-like panics are not  unfrequent--sometimes among the bulls, sometimes among the bears. If he  chooses, he will do more work in less time, or less work in more time,  than Karl or Patrick, and he often manages to make a cats-paw of them to  scratch out his delinquencies. He knows well how to make use of the  technicalities of the limited monarchy under which he is governed, and  bewilders dull Karl by his manifold risks and little punishment.    It matters not whether our man is cooped up at Eastport, or bivouacked  on the Rio-Grande--he is every where essentially the same. With scarce a  thought beyond the morrow, he awaits it without impatience. In all  places, and at all times, he has great respect for his officer; the  gracefully touching his cap being no idle ceremony. At the close of a  weary day's march, he will leave his own to put up his tent; build a  fire near it, and do every favor he can, freely and willingly. Officers  will recognize this fact, and attribute the secret to the strict  non-familiarity between them.    He has three festivals during the year, when he sets a splendid table  and enjoys himself--the two wintry holidays, and the anniversary of our  national independence. There are songs and speeches in abundance, and  the oratory is genuine. If he lingers long at the table--or under  it--there is so much power in the \"star spangled banner,\" "]]]
