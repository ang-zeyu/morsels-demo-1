Or did they,  on the contrary, dig at its base solely in order to bury that part of  the mole which lay on the ground? that is the question, which, for the  rest, is very easy to answer.    The experiment is repeated; but this time the gibbet is slanting and  the Mole, hanging in a vertical position, touches the ground at a  couple of inches from the base of the gibbet. Under these conditions  absolutely no attempt is made to overthrow the latter. Not the least  scrape of a claw is delivered at the foot of the gibbet. The entire  work of excavation is accomplished at a distance, under the body, whose  shoulders are lying on the ground. There--and there only--a hole is dug  to receive the free portion of the body, the part accessible to the  sextons.    A difference of an inch in the position of the suspended animal  annihilates the famous legend. Even so, many a time, the most  elementary sieve, handled with a little logic, is enough to winnow the  confused mass of affirmations and to release the good grain of truth.    Yet another shake of the sieve. The gibbet is oblique or vertical  indifferently; but the Mole, always fixed by a hinder limb to the top  of the twig, does not touch the soil; he hangs a few fingers'-breadths  from the ground, out of the sextons' reach.    What will the latter do? Will they scrape at the foot of the gibbet in  order to overturn it? By no means; and the ingenuous observer who  looked for such tactics would be greatly disappointed. No attention is  paid to the base of the support. It is not vouchsafed even a stroke of  the rake. Nothing is done to overturn it, nothing, absolutely nothing!  It is by other methods that the Burying-beetles obtain the Mole.    These decisive experiments, repeated under many different forms, prove  that never, never in this world do the Necrophori dig, or even give a  superficial scrape, at the foot of the gallows, unless the hanging body  touch the ground at that point. And, in the latter case, if the twig  should happen to fall, its fall is in nowise an intentional result, but  a mere fortuitous effect of the burial already commenced.    What, then, did the owner of the Frog of whom Gledditsch tells us  really see? If his stick was overturned, the body placed to dry beyond  the assaults of the Necrophori must certainly have touched the soil: a  strange precaution against robbers and the damp! We may fittingly  attribute more foresight to the preparer of dried Frogs and allow him  to hang the creature some inches from the ground. In this case all my  experiments emphatically assert that the fall of the stake undermined  by the sextons is a pure matter of imagination.    Yet another of the fine arguments in favour of the reasoning power of  animals flies from the light of investigation and founders in the  slough of error! I admire your simple faith, you masters who take  seriously the statements of chance-met observers, richer in imagination  than in veracity; I admire your credulous zeal, when, without  criticism, you build up your theories on such absurdities.    Let us proceed. The stake is henceforth planted vertically, but the  body hanging on it does not reach the base: a condition which suffices  to ensure that there is never any digging at this point. I make use of  a Mouse, who, by reason of her trifling weight, will lend herself  better to the insect's manoeuvres. The dead body is fixed by the  hind-legs to the top of the stake with a ligature of raphia. It hangs  plumb, in contact with the stick.    Very soon two Necrophori have discovered the tit-bit. They climb up the  miniature mast; they explore the body, dividing its fur by thrusts of  the head. It is recognized to be an excellent find. So to work. Here we  have again, but under far more difficult conditions, the tactics  employed when it was necessary to displace the unfavourably situated  body: the two collaborators slip between the Mouse and the stake, when,  taking a grip of the latter and exerting a leverage with their backs,  they jerk and shake the body, which oscillates, twirls about, swings  away from the stake and relapses. All the morning is passed in vain  attempts, interrupted by explorations on the animal's body.    In the afternoon the cause of the check is at last recognized; not very  clearly, for in the first place the two obstinate riflers of the  gallows attack the hind-legs of the Mouse, a little below the ligature.  They strip them bare, flay them and cut away the flesh about the heel.  They have reached the bone, when one of them finds the raphia beneath  his mandibles. This, to him, is a familiar thing, representing the  gramineous fibre so frequent in the case of burial in grass-covered  soil. Tenaciously the shears gnaw at the bond; the vegetable fetter is  severed and the Mouse falls, to be buried a little later.    If it were isolated, this severance of the suspending tie would be a  magnificent performance; but considered in connection with the sum of  the Beetle's customary labours it loses all far-reaching significance.  Before attacking the ligature, which was not concealed in any way, the  insect exerted itself for a whole morning in shaking the body, its  usual method. Finally, finding the cord, it severed it, as it would  have severed a ligament of couch-grass encountered underground.    Under the conditions devised for the Beetle, the use of the shears is  the indispensable complement of the use of the shovel; and the modicum  of discernment at his disposal is enough to inform him when the blades  of his shears will be useful. He cuts what embarrasses him with no more  exercise of reason than he displays when placing the corpse  underground. So little does he grasp the connection between cause and  effect that he strives to break the bone of the leg before gnawing at  the bast which is knotted close beside him. The difficult task is  attacked before the extremely simple.    Difficult, yes, but not impossible, provided that the Mouse be young. I  begin again with a ligature of iron wire, on which the shears of the  insect can obtain no purchase, and a tender Mouselet, half the size of  an adult. This time a tibia is gnawed through, cut in two by the  Beetle's mandibles near the spring of the heel. The detached member  leaves plenty of space for the other, which readily slips from the  metallic band; and the little body falls to the ground.    But, if the bone be too hard, if the body suspended be that of a Mole,  an adult Mouse, or a Sparrow, the wire ligament opposes an  insurmountable obstacle to the attempts of the Necrophori, who, for  nearly a week, work at the hanging body, partly stripping it of fur or  feather and dishevelling it until it forms a lamentable object, and at  last abandon it, when desiccation sets in. A last resource, however,  remains, one as rational as infallible. It is to overthrow the stake.  Of course, not one dreams of doing so.    For the last time let us change our artifices. The top of the gibbet  consists of a little fork, with the prongs widely opened and measuring  barely two-fifths of an inch in length. With a thread of hemp, less  easily attacked than a strip of raphia, I bind together, a little above  the heels, the hind-legs of an adult Mouse; and between the legs I slip  one of the prongs of the fork. To make the body fall it is enough to  slide it a little way upwards; it is like a young Rabbit hanging in the  front of a poulterer's shop.    Five Necrophori come to inspect my preparations. After a great deal of  futile shaking, the tibiae are attacked. This, it seems, is the method  usually employed when the body is retained by one of its limbs in some  narrow fork of a low-growing plant. While trying to saw through the  bone--a heavy job this time--one of the workers slips between the  shackled limbs. So situated, he feels against his back the furry touch  of the Mouse. Nothing more is needed to arouse his propensity to thrust  with his back. With a few heaves of the lever the thing is done; the  Mouse rises a little, slides over the supporting peg and falls to the  ground.    Is this manoeuvre really thought out? Has the insect indeed perceived,  by the light of a flash of reason, that in order to make the tit-bit  fall it was necessary to unhook it by sliding it along the peg? Has it  really perceived the mechanism of suspension? I know some  persons--indeed, I know many--who, in the presence of this magnificent  result, would be satisfied without further investigation.    More difficult to convince, I modify the experiment before drawing a  conclusion. I suspect that the Necrophorus, without any prevision of  the consequences of his action, heaved his back simply because he felt  the legs of the creature above him. With the system of suspension  adopted, the push of the back, employed in all cases of difficulty, was  brought to bear first upon the point of support; and the fall resulted  from this happy coincidence. That point, which has to be slipped along  the peg in order to unhook the object, ought really to be situated at a  short distance from the Mouse, so that the Necrophori shall no longer  feel her directly against their backs when they push.    A piece of wire binds together now the tarsi of a Sparrow, now the  heels of a Mouse and is bent, at a distance of three-quarters of an  inch or so, into a little ring, which slips very loosely over one of  the prongs of the fork, a short, almost horizontal prong. To make the  hanging body fall, the slightest thrust upon this ring is sufficient;  and, owing to its projection from the peg, it lends itself excellently  to the insect's methods. In short, the arrangement is the same as it  was just now, with this difference, that the point of support is at a  short distance from the suspended animal.    My trick, simple though it be, is fully successful. For a long time the  body is repeatedly shaken, but in vain; the tibiae or tarsi, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37566"],[0,"Natural History of the Ornate Box Turtle, Terrapene ornata ornata Agassiz (#15)"],[1,"       bars are for males and open bars for females. The bar for males         in the largest group is based on assumption since no males in         the sample were so long as 130 mm. Males mature at a smaller         size and lesser age (see also Figs. 9 and 10) than females.         Plastral lengths of the smallest sexually mature male and         female in the sample were, respectively, 99 and 107 mm.]    Mattox (1936) studied annual rings in the long bones of painted  turtles (_Chrysemys picta_) and found fewer rings in younger than in  older individuals but, beyond this, reached no important conclusion.  In the present study, thin sections were ground from the humeri and  femurs of box turtles of various ages and sizes; the results of this  investigation were negative. Distinct rings were present in the  compact bony tissue but it appeared that, after the first year or two,  the rings were destroyed by encroachment of the marrow cavity at about  the same rate at which they were formed peripherally.    The only methods that I know of to determine successfully the  longevity of long-lived reptiles would be to keep individuals under  observation for long periods of time or to study populations of marked  individuals. Both methods have the obvious disadvantage of requiring  somewhat more than a human lifetime to carry them to completion.  Restudy, after one or more decades, of the populations of turtles  marked by Fitch and myself may provide valuable data on the average  and maximum age reached by _T. ornata_.    Ornate box turtles probably live at least twice as long as the total  period of growing years. An estimated longevity of 50 years would seem  to agree with present scant information on age. Considering  environmental hazards, it would be unusual for an individual to  survive as long as 100 years in the wild.      Weight    Weights of ornate box turtles varied so much that no attempt was made  to correlate weight with size. Absolute weights have little  significance since weight is affected to a large extent by the amount  of fluid in the body. Turtles that had recently imbibed were naturally  heavier than those that had not; turtles brought to the laboratory and  kept there for several days lost weight by evaporation and by voiding  water. Weights of 22 adult females (53 records) and 10 adult males (22  records) averaged 391 and 353 grams respectively, in the period from  September, 1954, to October, 1956. Females characteristically gained  weight in spring and early summer and were lighter after nesting.  Turtles of both sexes gained weight in September and October.      Bony Shell    _Fontanelles_    At the time of hatching, fontanelles remain where bones of the shell  have not yet articulated with their neighbors. In general, the  fontanelles of the shell are closed by the time sexual maturity is  attained, but some remain open a year or two longer.    The fontanelles of the shell are classified as follows (see Figs. 14  to 16 and 18 to 19):    _Plastron_    1.) _Anteromedian._ Rhomboidal; limited anteriorly by hyoplastral  bones and posteriorly by hypoplastral bones; posterior tip of  entoplastral bone may project into this fontanelle.    2.) _Posteromedian._ Limited anteriorly by hypoplastral bones and  posteriorly by xiphyplastral bones (since hypoplastral bones do not  articulate medially in hatchlings, anteromedian and posteromedian  fontanelles form a single, more or less dumbbell-shaped opening).       [Illustration: FIG. 14. Extent of closure of the         costoperipheral fontanelles in relation to length of plastron         in 17 skeletons of _T. o. ornata_ from eastern Kansas. Extent         of closure is expressed as an estimated percentage of total         closure of all the costoperipheral fontanelles, even though         some of them close sooner than others. Closure is usually         complete by the time sexual maturity is attained.]      _Carapace_    1.) _Costoperipheral._ Openings between the free ends of developing  ribs, between nuchal bone and first rib, and, between pygal bone and  last rib; limited laterally by peripheral bones; variable in shape.    2.) _Costoneural._ Triangular openings on either side of middorsal  line between proximal ends of costal plates and developing neural  plates.    The costoneural fontanelles are nearly closed in individuals of the 70  millimeter (plastron length) class and seldom remain open after a  length of 80 millimeters is attained (Fig. 14). Of the costoperipheral  fontanelles, the anterior one (between first rib and nuchal bone)  closes first and the posterior one (between last rib and pygal bone)  last. It remains open in some turtles in which the plastron is longer  than 100 millimeters. The remaining costoperipheral fontanelles close  in varying sequence but those in the area of the bridge (nos. 2 to 5),  where there is presumably greater stress on the shell, close sooner  than the others.    The plastral fontanelles are closed in most specimens of the 90  millimeter (plastron length) class; the anteromedian fontanelle closes  first.    The meager covering of the fontanelles makes juvenal turtles more  susceptible than adults to many kinds of injuries and to predation.    _Movable Parts of the Shell_    Parts of the shell that are more or less movable upon one another and  that function in closing the shell are found in several families of  Recent turtles. African side-necked terrapins of the genus _Pelusios_  have a movable forelobe on the plastron. Kinosternids have one or two  flexible transverse hinges on the plastron. In the Testudinidae the  African _Kinixys_ has a movable hinge on the posterior part of the  carapace and _Pyxis arachnoides_ of Madagascar has a short, hinged,  anterior plastral lobe. Certain trionychid turtles, such as  _Lissemys_, utilize the flexible flaps of the carapace (the flaps of  some species are reinforced with peripheral bones) to close the shell.    Movable shell-parts of turtles are, in general, protective in  function; they cover parts of the soft anatomy that would otherwise be  exposed.    A hinged plastron, capable of wholly or partly closing the shell,  occurs in six genera of the family Emyidae (see introduction). In  these emyids the plastron is divided into two lobes, which are joined  to each other by ligamentous tissue at the junction of the hyoplastral  and hypoplastral bones; externally, the hinge occurs along the seam  between the pectoral and abdominal laminae. This junction forms a more  or less freely movable hinge in adults. The plastron is attached to  the carapace by ligamentous tissue. Both lobes of the plastron or only  the buttresses of the hind lobe may articulate with the carapace. The  former condition obtains in _Emys_ and _Emydoidea_; the latter more  specialized condition is found in _Terrapene_.    In generalized emyid turtles such as _Clemmys_ there are no movable  shell parts. The plastron is joined to the carapace by the sutures of  the bridge. A long stout process, the axillary buttress, arises on  each side from the hyoplastron and articulates with the tip of the  first costal. A similar process, the inguinal buttress, arises from  the anterior part of each of the hypoplastral elements and meets the  sixth costal on each side. The buttresses form the anterior and  posterior margins of the bridge. It is clear that movement of the  plastron in many emyids is mechanically impossible because of the  bracing effect of the buttresses.    In _Terrapene_ the movable articulations of the shell are neither  structurally nor functionally developed in juveniles. Adults of _T.  ornata_ have highly modified bony buttresses on the plastron that are  homologous with those in more generalized emyids. The inguinal  buttresses are low and wide, and have a sheer lateral surface forming  a sliding articulation with the fifth and sixth peripheral bones of  the carapace. The axillary buttresses are reduced to mere bony points  near the posterolateral corners of the forelobe and do not articulate  directly with the carapace (Figs. 15 and 16).    The fifth peripheral bone, constituting the lowest point of the  carapace, has a medial projection that acts as a pivoting point for  both lobes of the plastron; the roughened anterior corners of the hind  lobe articulate with these processes. The roughened posterior corners  of the forelobe of the plastron likewise articulate with these  processes. The posterior process or \"tail\" of the entoplastron extends  to, or nearly to, the bony transverse hinge.    In juveniles that have been cleared and stained, the homologues of the  parts that are movable in adults are easily identifiable; the  proportions of these parts and their relations to one another are,  however, much different.    In juveniles (Figs. 18 and 19) the buttresses are relatively longer  and narrower, and are distinct--more nearly like those of generalized  emyids than those of adult _T. ornata_. The buttresses enclose a large  open space, which in adults is filled by the fifth peripheral. The  hyoplastral and hypoplastral bones are in contact only laterally. They  are firmly joined by bony processes; the interdigitating nature of  this articulation contrasts with its homologue in the adult, the point  where the roughened corners of the forelobes and hind lobes meet. The  fifth peripheral in juveniles (Fig. 19) lies dorsal to this  articulation. The position of the future transverse hinge corresponds  to a line passing through the articulations of the hyoplastra and  hypoplastra. The tail of the entoplastron ordinarily extends posterior  to this line in juveniles.       [Illustration: FIG. 15.
