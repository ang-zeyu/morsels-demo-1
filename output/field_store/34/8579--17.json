I am not saying that  all boys who entered that University were religious boys when they went  in, or even religious men when they came out; but religious fathers had  a general desire to place their boys under Sir William Dawson's care.    Those were the days of a queer, and now forgotten, controversy over  what was called \"Science and Religion\". Of that also I have written in  another place. It was left to Sir William Dawson to deliver the last  word in defence of a cause that was already lost. His book came under  the eye of David McCrae, as most books of the time did, and he was  troubled in his heart. His boys were at the University of Toronto. It  was too late; but he eased his mind by writing a letter. To this letter  John replies under date 20th December, 1890: \"You say that after reading  Dawson's book you almost regretted that we had not gone to McGill. That,  I consider, would have been rather a calamity, about as much so as going  to Queen's.\" We are not always wiser than our fathers were, and in the  end he came to McGill after all.    For good or ill, John McCrae entered the University of Toronto in 1888,  with a scholarship for \"general proficiency\". He joined the Faculty of  Arts, took the honours course in natural sciences, and graduated from  the department of biology in 1894, his course having been interrupted  by two severe illnesses. From natural science, it was an easy step to  medicine, in which he was encouraged by Ramsay Wright, A. B. Macallum,  A. McPhedran, and I. H. Cameron. In 1898 he graduated again, with a  gold medal, and a scholarship in physiology and pathology. The previous  summer he had spent at the Garrett Children's Hospital in Mt. Airy,  Maryland.    Upon graduating he entered the Toronto General Hospital as resident  house officer; in 1899 he occupied a similar post at Johns Hopkins. Then  he came to McGill University as fellow in pathology and pathologist to  the Montreal General Hospital. In time he was appointed physician to the  Alexandra Hospital for infectious diseases; later assistant physician to  the Royal Victoria Hospital, and lecturer in medicine in the University.  By examination he became a member of the Royal College of Physicians,  London. In 1914 he was elected a member of the Association of American  Physicians. These are distinctions won by few in the profession.    In spite, or rather by reason, of his various attainments John McCrae  never developed, or degenerated, into the type of the pure scientist.  For the laboratory he had neither the mind nor the hands. He never  peered at partial truths so closely as to mistake them for the whole  truth; therefore, he was unfitted for that purely scientific career  which was developed to so high a pitch of perfection in that nation  which is now no longer mentioned amongst men. He wrote much, and  often, upon medical problems. The papers bearing his name amount to  thirty-three items in the catalogues. They testify to his industry  rather than to invention and discovery, but they have made his name  known in every text-book of medicine.    Apart from his verse, and letters, and diaries, and contributions to  journals and books of medicine, with an occasional address to students  or to societies, John McCrae left few writings, and in these there is  nothing remarkable by reason of thought or expression. He could not  write prose. Fine as was his ear for verse he could not produce that  finer rhythm of prose, which comes from the fall of proper words in  proper sequence. He never learned that if a writer of prose takes care  of the sound the sense will take care of itself. He did not scrutinize  words to discover their first and fresh meaning. He wrote in phrases,  and used words at second-hand as the journalists do. Bullets \"rained\";  guns \"swept\"; shells \"hailed\"; events \"transpired\", and yet his  appreciation of style in others was perfect, and he was an insatiable  reader of the best books. His letters are strewn with names of authors  whose worth time has proved. To specify them would merely be to write  the catalogue of a good library.    The thirteen years with which this century opened were the period in  which John McCrae established himself in civil life in Montreal and in  the profession of medicine. Of this period he has left a chronicle which  is at once too long and too short.    All lives are equally interesting if only we are in possession of all  the facts. Places like Oxford and Cambridge have been made interesting  because the people who live in them are in the habit of writing, and  always write about each other. Family letters have little interest  even for the family itself, if they consist merely of a recital of the  trivial events of the day. They are prized for the unusual and for the  sentiment they contain. Diaries also are dull unless they deal with  selected incidents; and selection is the essence of every art. Few  events have any interest in themselves, but any event can be made  interesting by the pictorial or literary art.    When he writes to his mother, that, as he was coming out of the  college, an Irish setter pressed a cold nose against his hand, that is  interesting because it is unusual. If he tells us that a professor took  him by the arm, there is no interest in that to her or to any one else.  For that reason the ample letters and diaries which cover these years  need not detain us long. There is in them little selection, little  art--too much professor and too little dog.    It is, of course, the business of the essayist to select; but in the  present case there is little to choose. He tells of invitations to  dinner, accepted, evaded, or refused; but he does not always tell who  were there, what he thought of them, or what they had to eat. Dinner  at the Adami's,--supper at Ruttan's,--a night with Owen,--tea at the  Reford's,--theatre with the Hickson's,--a reception at the Angus's,--or  a dance at the Allan's,--these events would all be quite meaningless  without an exposition of the social life of Montreal, which is too large  a matter to undertake, alluring as the task would be. Even then, one  would be giving one's own impressions and not his.    Wherever he lived he was a social figure. When he sat at table the  dinner was never dull. The entertainment he offered was not missed by  the dullest intelligence. His contribution was merely \"stories\", and  these stories in endless succession were told in a spirit of frank fun.  They were not illustrative, admonitory, or hortatory. They were just  amusing, and always fresh. This gift he acquired from his mother, who  had that rare charm of mimicry without mockery, and caricature without  malice. In all his own letters there is not an unkind comment or tinge  of ill-nature, although in places, especially in later years, there is  bitter indignation against those Canadian patriots who were patriots  merely for their bellies' sake.    Taken together his letters and diaries are a revelation of the heroic  struggle by which a man gains a footing in a strange place in that most  particular of all professions, a struggle comprehended by those alone  who have made the trial of it. And yet the method is simple. It is all  disclosed in his words, \"I have never refused any work that was given me  to do.\" These records are merely a chronicle of work. Outdoor clinics,  laboratory tasks, post-mortems, demonstrating, teaching, lecturing,  attendance upon the sick in wards and homes, meetings, conventions,  papers, addresses, editing, reviewing,--the very remembrance of such a  career is enough to appall the stoutest heart.    But John McCrae was never appalled. He went about his work gaily, never  busy, never idle. Each minute was pressed into the service, and every  hour was made to count. In the first eight months of practice he  claims to have made ninety dollars. It is many years before we hear him  complain of the drudgery of sending out accounts, and sighing for the  services of a bookkeeper. This is the only complaint that appears in his  letters.    There were at the time in Montreal two rival schools, and are yet two  rival hospitals. But John McCrae was of no party. He was the friend of  all men, and the confidant of many. He sought nothing for himself and by  seeking not he found what he most desired. His mind was single and his  intention pure; his acts unsullied by selfish thought; his aim was true  because it was steady and high. His aid was never sought for any cause  that was unworthy, and those humorous eyes could see through the bones  to the marrow of a scheme. In spite of his singular innocence, or rather  by reason of it, he was the last man in the world to be imposed upon.    In all this devastating labour he never neglected the assembling of  himself together with those who write and those who paint. Indeed, he  had himself some small skill in line and colour. His hands were the  hands of an artist--too fine and small for a body that weighted 180  pounds, and measured more than five feet eleven inches in height. There  was in Montreal an institution known as \"The Pen and Pencil Club\". No  one now living remembers a time when it did not exist. It was a peculiar  club. It contained no member who should not be in it; and no one was  left out who should be in. The number was about a dozen. For twenty  years the club met in Dyonnet's studio, and afterwards, as the result  of some convulsion, in K. R. Macpherson's. A ceremonial supper was eaten  once a year, at which one dressed the salad, one made the coffee, and  Harris sang a song. Here all pictures were first shown, and writings  read--if they were not too long. If they were, there was in an adjoining  room a tin chest, which in these austere days one remembers with  refreshment. When John McCrae was offered membership he \"grabbed at  it\", and the place was a home for the spirit wearied by the week's work.  There Brymner and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35304"],[0,"The Last Stroke: A Detective Story (#15)"],[1,"opening  the shutters, I first noted that the visitor had left us a clue to his  identity--several clues, indeed. Before seeing these I had thought that  the boy was only an advance guard for some one else, but I see I was  wrong. It was the boy, and a very keen and clever boy, who entered here  alone. See upon this table, upon the window sills, and upon the desk,  the prints of one, two, and sometimes all four, small slender fingers.\"    Ferrars paused a moment, while they examined the dust prints, faint but  yet clear, upon the dark wood, and making lines of clearer colour upon  the painted brown of the window sills.    \"And what,\" asked Brierly, speaking for the first time since the  detective began his explanation--\"what was his real object?\"    \"His real object! Ah, I see you have been observant, and if I am not  much mistaken he has left something; but the things he took were taken  solely to cover up the real reason of his coming. Mr. Charles Brierly's  pistol, his watch, and the foreign bijouterie were so little wanted by  this remarkable boy that he will no doubt get rid of them in some way at  the first opportunity. All but one thing.\"    \"And that?\" asked Brierly, breathlessly.    Ferrars walked over to the writing-desk and signed them to follow.  \"Observe that letter file!\" he said. \"There is not much upon it, bills  for school books, two or three circulars, and so on, but observe that  this file hangs over the top of the desk, so that anything falling from  it would touch just here. He moistened the tip of a forefinger, and,  touching with it a small bit of paper lying upon the top of the desk and  just below the letter file, he lifted it deftly, and they all saw  beneath it the dust of the previous day upon the polished surface.    \"This,\" said Ferrars, holding out the bit of paper upon the palm of his  hand, \"was torn from something pulled from this file since Mrs. Fry  dusted the furniture here yesterday morning, after Charles Brierly left  the house. See, as the paper was pulled from the file this bit came off,  because it was attached at the corner, as you see. It is a fragment from  a newspaper. If it had been a letter the paper would not have parted so  readily; it would merely have torn through.\"    It was, indeed, a tiny scrap of newspaper, not of the best quality, and  not half an inch from the smoothly-cut corner to the ragged edge, where  the file had perforated it.    \"The slip of printed paper from which this was torn,\" said Ferrars, \"was  the one thing which was taken from this room because it was wanted! The  rest were merely carried away as a blind.\"    \"But,\" asked the doctor, \"why did he make this search among the books  and papers?\"    \"To find perhaps this very thing,\" replied Ferrars. \"But his first and  most important errand was this.\" He drew forth the letter given into his  hands by Robert Brierly, and held it toward them. \"Witness the thing  itself. It bears no post-mark, it never did bear one, and it is thrust  into the most conspicuous place, doubtless, after some looking about, in  search of a better. I do not know its contents but I guess.\"    A gesture from Brierly cut short his speech. \"Read it, both of you,\" he  said, with something like a groan. \"And tell me what it means.\"    Ferrars drew forth the sheet of note paper and slowly unfolded it. For a  moment he scrutinised the page with a frown, and then began to read--           \"Mr. Charles Brierly: I don't know why I should be drawn into your       love affair any further, and I have said my last word about your       friend, Miss G----. One would think that the proofs you have       already had would be more than enough. She is not the first woman,       with a pretty face and an innocent way, who has fooled and tricked       a man. Why don't you ask her and have it out? You'll find she can       scratch as well as the rest of her sex. One word more, when you       have had it out with her, beware! Especially if she weeps and       forgives you. Remember the 'woman scorned.'         \"Don't write me again. I shall not answer any more questions. And,       remember your promise, don't let her dream that you ever heard of       me. I shall feel safer. So good-bye and good luck. Yours, J. B.\"      Ferrars folded up this strange letter slowly, saying:    \"This document has no date and no post office address.\" He held it in  his hand for a moment in silence, looking at it thoughtfully, then. \"I  should like to retain this,\" he said, looking at Brierly, \"as one of the  documents in the case.\" And as Brierly silently bowed his assent, he  added: \"Have you formed an opinion concerning this letter?\"    \"I believe it is a shameful trick,\" declared Robert Brierly, hotly. \"An  attempt on the part of some person or persons to injure Miss Grant, who  stands to me as a sister henceforth. If I am any judge of womankind, she  is as good as she is lovely, and I believe that she mourns my brother's  awful death as only a good, true and loving woman can. I wish you could  and would say the same, Mr. Ferrars.\"    \"I can say that you have said the only right and manly thing, in my  opinion. You don't want to know what I think, however, but what can be  done? And, first, this affair must be kept between ourselves. This  letter makes it all the more important. If it has been put here to  mislead justice and to make trouble, perfect silence regarding it will  be the most baffling and perplexing course we can pursue. And it may  lead to some further manifestation. The word must go out at once that  Mr. Brierly has desired these rooms closed for the present, with  everything to remain untouched. Meantime I consider that we have got our  hands upon some strong clues, if we can find the way to develop them  aright. Don't ask me anything more now, gentlemen. I want time to study  over this morning's discoveries, and Mr. Brierly, it is time you  breakfasted.\"    At this moment there came a quick tap at the door, and Mrs. Fry's voice  was heard without. At a signal from Ferrars, Doctor Barnes opened the  door.    \"Gentlemen,\" began the little woman in eager explanation, \"I don't want  to interrupt.\"    \"We are just going,\" said the doctor politely.    \"Oh, well, I got to thinking, after I went downstairs, and it came into  my mind that I didn't see Miss Grant's picture on the top of the  writing-desk up here. Mr. Brierly had had it three weeks or so, and he  showed it to me himself and says, 'Mrs. Fry, this picture is in its  proper place here in my room. You and Nellie both know and love Miss  Grant, and so I may tell you that she is to be my wife some day, God  willing.'\" The woman's voice broke at the last word, and Robert Brierly  made a quick stride back toward the desk. But Ferrars said,  unconcernedly, \"Thank you, Mrs. Fry; we shall find it in the desk, I  fancy,\" and then he explained to her Mr. Brierly's desire that the rooms  remain closed to all curious visitors until further notice, adding that  they would close the outside blinds and be downstairs directly; then,  shutting the door upon the woman's retreating form, and softly turning  the key in the lock again, Ferrars went to the desk, and, catching back  Brierly's extended hand, said, \"Wait!\"    He came closer to the desk and bent to scan at the top shelf.    \"Look,\" he said after a moment, \"do you see that line, close to the  back, where the dust is not quite so apparent? The picture has been  taken from there.\" He took hold of the back and pulled the desk from the  wall a few inches.    \"Ah,\" he exclaimed, \"I thought so!\" and dropping upon one knee he drew  out two pieces of cardboard. \"I thought so,\" he repeated as he arose,  and there was a steely gleam in his eyes as he held out to view the two  halves of a fine picture of Hilda Grant, torn across the middle as if by  a firm and vindictive hand. \"This helps me,\" he said, with a touch of  triumph in his voice. \"It helps me more than all the rest.\"    He made a movement as if to put the picture together with the letter  which he had put down upon the desk-top, into a capacious inner pocket,  and then suddenly withdrew his hand and bestowed them elsewhere, for,  thrust into that safe side pocket, so convenient and capacious, was a  folded newspaper, from which a \"clipping\" had been carefully cut, a  paper which he had found in the rack near the desk, and had secreted, as  he thought, unseen, at his earliest opportunity.          CHAPTER XI.    DETAILS.      During the day that followed the discoveries in Mrs. Fry's upper  chamber, Mr. Ferrars did a variety of things that surprised the brother  of Charles Brierly; yes, and the doctor as well, and he said some things  that seemed quite incomprehensible. For the detective was somewhat given  to half-uttered soliloquy when he knew himself among \"safe\" people, and  could therefore afford to relax his guard. Likewise he failed to say the  things which Brierly, at least, expected, and much desired to hear.    His first movement after the three had breakfasted, was to ask for the  keys of the cottage chambers, for they had been handed over to Brierly  somewhat ostentatiously in the presence of Mrs. Fry and at the foot of  the cottage stairs, by the doctor.    \"I want to spend another half-hour in those rooms,\" he said, \"and to so  leave them that I shall know at once if a human foot has so much as  crossed the threshold.\"    This was all the explanation he chose to make then or upon his return.    Indeed, when he came back he spent all of the remaining time until high  noon, smoking alone upon the doctor's neat lawn and along the shady side  of the house, excusing himself and guarding against possible intrusion,  by remarking that he felt the need of a little solitary self-communion.    At luncheon the question of the burial was discussed, and afterward  Brierly announced his intentions to call upon Miss Grant, if the doctor  thought her able to receive him.    \"I have told Mrs."]]]
