If wealth alone had been  Ribiera's aim, the gathering of his slaves would have had a different  aspect. The majority of them would have been rich men, men of  business, men who could pay out hundreds of thousands a month in the  desperate hope of being permitted to remain sane. There would not have  been politicians and officials and officers of the army.    \"The key men of the country,\" growled Bell inaudibly, \"enslaved to  Ribiera. They give him the power he's after more than cash. And it's  those key men who have more to lose than money. There's such a thing  as honor....\"    Three times the conductor stopped beside him and suggestively rattled  the coins in his box. Three times Bell absent mindedly paid the fare  for the zone. But the ride is a long one, and he had had time to  realize the hopelessness of any single-handed attack upon the thing he  faced long before the end.    Then he absently moved through the amazing collection of tropic and  near tropic growths that is the Botanical Garden until he came at once  to Paula and the Lagoa Rodrico de Freitas.           *       *       *       *       *    It was alive with birds, and they hopped and pecked and squabbled  without acrimony within feet of her seated figure. Bell knew that she  had been waiting for a long time. He looked quickly at her face. It  was quite pale, but entirely tearless.    \"Here is the message, Senhor Bell,\" she said quietly, \"but I think I  have been followed.\"    Bell growled in his throat.    \"I did not discover it until I reached this spot,\" she said evenly.  \"And I did not know what to do. If I left, I would be seized and the  message taken--and I think that someone would have waited here for  you. So, in part to gain time, and in part because I hoped you might  have some resource, I remained.\"    \"How many of them?\" asked Bell shortly.    \"Two,\" she said quietly. She looked at him, her large eyes entirely  calm and grave.    \"Give me the package,\" said Bell briefly. \"They'll be more anxious to  get it back than to bother you. And I'll either knock them cold or  hold them in a scrap until you get away.\"    She reached in her pocket and handed him a small thick envelope. He  stuffed it in the side pocket of his coat.    \"I will walk away,\" he observed, \"and they'll follow me. Can you  arrange to give me some sign that you're safe?\"    \"By the gateway,\" she told him. \"My handkerchief. I shall start as  soon as you have vanished. If I am followed, I will drop this  handkerchief, as it is. If I am not followed, I will tie a knot. But  what can you do?\"    \"I'll do something,\" said Bell coldly. \"Something!\"           *       *       *       *       *    She smiled, with the same odd bitterness her father had shown.    \"My father--shot himself,\" she said briefly. \"I have no particular  hope of doing better. But I shall not be Ribiera's slave.\"    She remained quite still. Bell moved away. He hurried. There was thick  jungle ahead, a section of the Gardens that is painstakingly preserved  untouched and undisturbed, that visitors to the capital of Brazil may  observe a typical sample of the virgin interior. He dived into that  jungle as if in flight.    And very shortly after, two men dived in after him. They hesitated,  these men, because your policeman of Rio does not like to injure his  uniform, and there are many thorns in jungle growths. But they entered  it, having first drawn small glittering weapons. And then from the  jungle came silence.           *       *       *       *       *    It seemed to be silence. But there may have been some small unusual  noises. It would not be easy to tell if they were unusual or not,  because there are peculiar flashes of charm in certain Brazilian  institutions. The preservation of the spot of jungle itself is one.  Another is the fact that in the Gardens all manner of wild things  live at large and provide unexpected and delightful surprises to the  usually foreign visitors.    So there were noises, after a bit. Such noises as some grunting wild  thing might have made, perhaps. But they might also have been the  gasping of a man as breath was choked out of him.... And there was a  cracking sound a little later, which might--of course--have been any  one of any number of accidental and perfectly natural causes. And it  might have been a man upon whom another man had hurled himself, when  the second man landed on his jaw. And thrashing noises a little later  might have been anything.    But after what seemed a long time, Bell emerged. Alone. He was  breathing quickly, and there were scratches on his face and hands  which--well, which might have been made by thorns. He went swiftly  back toward the spot where Paula had waited. He looked cautiously. She  was gone.    And then Bell went leisurely, in the studious fashion of a person  going through the Botanical Gardens because it was the thing to do,  toward the gateway and the surface cars. As he neared the gate his  eyes roved with apparent casualness all about. He saw a tiny speck of  white on the edge of the roadway. It looked as if it had been flung  from a car. Bell picked it up. It was Paula's handkerchief, and there  was no knot whatever in it. In fact, its lacy edge was torn.    \"They've got her,\" said Bell, apparently unmoved.           *       *       *       *       *    He waited for a car. A bulky figure wearing thick spectacles came  placidly from the Gardens. It waited, also, for the car. The car  arrived, in its two sections of first and second class; the first  reserved for _cavalhieros_, which is to say persons wearing coat,  shirt, collar, necktie, hat, shoes and socks, and carrying no parcel  larger than a brief case. Lesser folk who lacked any of the sartorial  requirements for admission to the first class section, or wore  _tomancos_ instead of shoes, heaped themselves into the second section  and paid one-third of the fare in the first.    Bell took his seat in the first section. It was comfortably filled.  The bulky person with the thick spectacles wedged himself carefully  into the space beside Bell. He unfolded a copy of the _Jornal do  Commercio_ and began to regard the advertisements. Presently he found  what he was looking for. \"_O Bicho_,\" said medium-sized type. Beside  it was a picture of a kangaroo. The gentleman with the thick  spectacles resignedly fished into his pockets and found a lottery  ticket. He tore it into scraps and threw them away. Then he began to  gaze disinterestedly at the scenery and the other passengers in the  car.           *       *       *       *       *    Bell drummed on his knee. With one's forefinger representing a dot,  and one's second finger serving as a dash, it is surprising how  naturally and absentmindedly one may convey a perfectly intelligible  message to a man sitting within a reasonable distance. When the man is  alongside, the matter is absurdly simple.    Presently the man with the thick lenses got out his paper again, as if  bored by vistas such as no other city in the world can offer. His  paper was in the pocket which pressed against Bell. If in getting out  his newspaper he also abstracted a thick fat envelope from Bell's  pocket and placed it in his own, and if all this took place under a  sign--even in the section reserved for _cavalhieros_ of approved  raiment--solemnly warning passengers against \"_batadores de  carteiras_,\" or pickpockets--well, it was an ironical coincidence  whose humor Bell did not see.    He was busily tapping out on his knee the briefest possible account of  what he had learned at Ribiera's _fazenda_ up country.    \"_One chance for me_,\" he tapped off at the end. \"_If I can kidnap  Ribiera I can make him talk. Somehow. He has big amphibian plane kept  fueled and ready for long trip. I think he is back in Rio to direct  hunt for me. Paula kidnapped. My job finished. On my own now._\"    The man with thick spectacles did not nod. He seemed to be looking  idly at his paper, but it was folded at an article very discreetly  phrased, beneath a photograph of Senhor Teixeira Canalejas, Minister  of War, who had very unfortunately been found dead that morning. He  had been depressed, of late, but there were certain circumstances  which made it as yet impossible to determine whether he had killed  himself or was the victim of an assassin.    \"_Getting set for me_,\" tapped Bell grimly on his knee. \"_Ribiera told  me too much._\"           *       *       *       *       *    The man with thick spectacles yawned and turned the paper over. Under  a smaller headline--which would only find a place on a Brazilian  sheet--\"A Regrettable Incident\"--an item of more direct importance was  printed. It told of an unnamed Senhor from the United States of the  North America, who as the guest of a widely known Brazilian gentleman  had behaved most boorishly, had stolen an airplane from his host and  broken it to bits on landing unskilfully, and had vanished with  priceless heirlooms belonging to his host. It read, virtuously:         No names are mentioned because the American Senhor has been       widely introduced in Rio society as a person with an       official status in Washington. It is understood that an       inquiry is to be made of the Ambassador as to the status of       the young man, before any action is taken by the police. It       is to be expected, however, that he will at least be       requested to leave the country.    Bell managed the barest flicker of a smile. Arrest, of course.  Detention, most courteously arranged, while the Ambassador was  communicated with. And Ribiera.    \"_Give me dismiss_,\" he tapped on his knee.    The gentleman in the thick spectacles ran his finger thoughtfully  about the edge of his collar. In the Trade that is a signal of many  varied meanings. A hand across the throat in any fashion means, \"Clear  out, your job is finished,\" \"Save your skin as best you can,\" and \"Get  away without trying"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29816"],[0,"The Industries of Animals (#15)"],[1,"nts. All the summer he gives himself up to this hunt,  but at the same time he collects acorns, which he does not touch,  however, so long as he can find other food. He amasses them in the  following ingenious manner: he chooses a tree and hollows out in its  trunk a cavity just capable of receiving one acorn. He then carries a  fruit and introduces it forcibly into the hole he has just made. Thus  buried, the acorn can neither fall nor become the prey of another  animal. In the domain of these birds trees may be found which are  riddled like a sieve with holes stopped up by an acorn as by a plug.  When the hunting of insects ceases to be fruitful, the _Melanerpes_  visits his barns. If an ordinary bird wished to eat one of these  fruits, at each stroke of his beak, on account of the polish and  convexity of the acorn's surface, it would escape him, and only by a  series of reiterated efforts would the interior be exposed; but for  the American woodpecker the task is simplified; each acorn being  maintained firmly in the bark, it is sufficient to break the envelope  and the pulp is easily seized.[51]       [51] See, for instance, _Nature_, 20th July 1871; also A. L.          Heermann, \"Notes on the Birds of California,\" _Journ. Acad.          Nat. Sc. Philadelphia_, 2nd Series, vol. ii., 1853, p. 259.    A relation of this bird, the _Colaptes mexicanus_, does not yield to  him in economy and skill. He places his barn in the interior of a  plant which is very abundant in the zone he inhabits. Insectivorous  during a part of the year, he is forced to renounce this diet during  the dry season. In the regions of Mexico where this bird is found the  dry period is so absolute that he would die of hunger for want of  insects or fruits if he had not taken the precaution of laying up  stores during spring. His store consists of acorns. He has not time to  fix them one by one, like the _Melanerpes_, and only thinks at first  of rapidly collecting a large quantity. But it is in deciding the  question as to where they are to be laid up that the _Colaptes_ shows  his remarkable intelligence. In the forests where he lives are to be  found aloes, yuccas, and agaves. When the agaves have flowered, the  flower-bearing stem, two or three metres in length, shrivels, but  remains standing for some time. Its peripheral portion is hardened by  the heat, while the sap in the interior almost entirely disappears. A  hollow cylinder with a well-sheltered cavity is thus formed, and the  _Colaptes_ proposes to utilise it as a storehouse. His acorns will  there be well protected against external influences and against the  birds whose beaks are too weak to pierce the agave. It is then a  question of filling the tube. The animal first pierces the wall  towards the base of the stalk; through this hole he introduces acorns  until he has filled the lower part of the cavity. This done, he makes  a new hole rather above the first, and fills the interval between the  two, continuing this process until he has arrived at the top of the  stalk and filled the whole interior. (Figs. 10 and 11.) The bird seems  at first to take unnecessary trouble by boring so many holes. He would  reach his end as well, it would seem, by making a single hole at the  top to fill his storehouse, and another at the bottom to empty it. But  we must not thus accuse him of lack of judgment. The interior of the  tube is just large enough for the passage of an acorn; but at certain  points the sap is not entirely absorbed, and there might easily be an  impediment which would leave a large part of the cavity empty. Hence  the necessity for a number of openings. When the sun has scorched up  plants, and provisions are rare, he turns to his barns of abundance.  Now and every time that he has need he can utilise the method that has  been employed by his cousin the _Melanerpes_. In order to feed on each  acorn without too much trouble, or allowing it to slip from his beak,  the bird places it in a vice. He hollows a hole in the trunk of a  tree, introduces the fruit there forcibly, and eats it at his  ease.[52]       [52] Henri de Saussure, \"Observations sur les moeurs de          divers oiseaux du Mexique,\" _Arch. Sci. phys. et natur._,          1859, pp. 21-41.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.]    [Illustration: FIG. 11.]    The provisions collected by these two birds reveal a remarkable fact.  They possess indeed two distinct diets; they do not preserve for the  period of famine the overplus of the foods which they consume in the  period of abundance. They chase insects and feed on them as long as  they can find them, while they gather up in their storehouses an  entirely different food.    _Physiological reserves._--All the animals of which I have just spoken  place their provisions for the future in barns in the same manner as  Man. Those who have not this foresight are either able to nourish  themselves in all seasons by the chase, or else, after having feasted  one half of the year, they fast during the other half. In the latter  case they consume during the fasting period a portion of their own  substance, and use up materials placed in reserve in their organism,  in the form of fat for example. This arrangement, which allows them to  prolong life, though growing thin, until the next season of  prosperity, is not under the control of the will. It is a complication  of physiological phenomena resulting from the functioning of different  parts of the organism.    _Stages between physiological reserves and provisions._--Between  physiological reserves and industrial stores we may place as an  intermediate stage the interesting case of the Honey Ants.[53]       [53] H. C. McCook, _The Honey Ants of the Garden of the          Gods, and the Ants of the American Plains_, Philadelphia,          1882.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.]    [Illustration: FIG. 13.]    These insects (_Myrmecocystus_) live in Texas, and form colonies in  which certain individuals play a very special part They exaggerate to  an extreme point the power of preserving provisions in their crops.  These materials are not assimilated; they do not form part of the  animal's body, and although placed inside it cannot be compared to  physiological reserves. It is especially curious that they are not to  be utilised only by the animal itself, but also by the other members  of the colony who are not able to form such stores. Among the  _Myrmecocystus_ there are workers of two sorts; the first kind  resemble other ants with some differences of detail, and build and  hollow the earth nest which shelters the community. The second kind is  quite different; the abdomen in these workers is enormously distended  so as to constitute a voluminous sphere, which may become four or five  times larger than the thorax and head together. (Fig. 12.) On this  distended receptacle appear several darker plates; these are the  remains of the chitinous parts of the primitive wings. In the fine  season these ants go out in a band and collect a sweet liquor which  forms pearly drops on certain galls of oak leaves. These drops,  elaborated into honey, gradually fill the crop, distending it and  pushing back neighbouring organs until it receives its globular form.  When they have arrived at this obese condition, the heavy honey ants  no longer leave the nest. They remain without movement, hanging by  their legs to the roof or lying against the walls of a room. The  workers who have remained slender come and go, attending to their  usual occupations, and pass near the others without paying attention  to them or going out of the way to lend assistance to their impotent  sisters when one of them has rolled over on the ground and can no  longer arise unaided. (Fig. 13.) They only cease to be indifferent  when impelled by the selfish sentiment of hunger, and then it is to  ask and not to give assistance. The fat ants in fact could not  themselves consume all the honey that they have elaborated; the others  in times of famine approach them, caress them with their antennae, and  obtain by solicitation a drop of honey which the large ones disgorge  from the crop. Here, then, is a colony in which the division of labour  has reached a remarkable degree of polymorphism. Some of the members  accomplish the work of engineers and masons, while the others  fabricate for the community a store of honey. Instead of depositing  these provisions in cells like bees, they preserve them in their own  digestive tube. This custom has re-acted to such an extent on the form  of their bodies that at first sight they seem to belong to a different  species.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.]    _Animals who submit foods to special preparation in order to  facilitate transport._--Not content with collecting materials as they  are found in nature, certain animals submit them to preparation with  various aims, either to render transport easier or that they may not  deteriorate when stored. Among those of whom I have just spoken, some  collect with the view of utilising their stores in a more remote  future than others. The _Ateucus sacer_ intends to consume the  provisions he prepares almost immediately. Yet he acts in so careful a  manner that I cannot pass him in silence. This beetle is the sacred  Scarabaeus so venerated by the Egyptians, who have everywhere  reproduced his image in porphyry and granite. He is a most singular  insect. The celebrated Fabre has given a complete and very picturesque  history of his customs.[54] I have myself had an opportunity of seeing  him at work. It was in Persia, in the plain of Susiana, on a hot  morning in March. We had passed the night in the open air, proposing  to continue our journey in the early morning, but our mules, rendered  rather lively by the fresh grass brought out by the spring weather,  had decided otherwise. They had all decamped to take a ramble on their  own account. In order to pass away the hours taken up by the muleteers  in"]]]
