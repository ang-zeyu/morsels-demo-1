One of these is  Enrico Cavacchioli, a Sicilian living in Milan, the dramatic critic of  the _Secolo_ and the director of _Il Mondo_ and of the publishing-house  of Vitagliano. His reputation as a man of letters stands in no relation  to his futurist poems. It does, however, to his compositions for the  theatre, and especially to his great success, \"Uccello del Paradiso\"  (\"Bird of Paradise\"). His last contribution, \"Quella che t'assomiglia\"  (\"That Which Resembles You\"), which he calls a vision in three acts, is  a satire on the present-day interest in the occult and supernatural.    When the promising and brilliant young writer of the Florentine group,  Renato Serra, was killed in the war, Italy lost one of its most gifted  critics since De Sanctis. Despite his youth he had, when he was called  to the colors, already won a conspicuous position as a man of letters.  Alfredo Panzini dedicated his \"Madonna di Mama\" to him, and made  touching allusions to his qualities of soul and potential greatness. In  1914 he published a survey of contemporary Italian literature (\"Le  Lettere\"), and the five years which have elapsed since then have shown  that his estimates and judgments were unusually sound. His was neither  the academic idealistic criticism of the old school nor the historic  philosophic criticism of Croce. He attempted to interpret writers,  plans, and performances and to contrast them with ideals he had himself  conceived or worked out from study of the masters. His last work,  \"Scritti Critici\" (\"Critical Writings\"), was published in 1919. They  show a subtle and profound analysis, an original point of view, and  equilibrium in expression and in form. His style is simple, his  statements clear, his presentations convincing.    Another young writer of this group, a man of great promise, was Scipio  Slattaper. He gave his life for his country in the early days of the  war.    Corrado Govoni has, for the past decade, been considered by some to be  Italy's most promising poet. There is definite infantilism in his work,  a distractibility, a discursiveness, that has stood in the way of  meriting such estimate. Although still a young man (thirty-five), he has  eight volumes of poetry that bear his name. Papini was his impresario  but he no longer treats him as one of his favored family. His first  volume was called \"Le fiale\" (\"The Honeycomb\"), the next \"Armonia in  Grigio ed in Silenzio\" (\"Harmony in Gray and in Silence\"). They were  truly juvenile. The third volume, \"Fuochi d'Artifizio\" (\"Fireworks\"),  showed the influence of Rodenbach, of James, and of the modern French  school.    In 1907 he published \"Aborti,\" which showed his mental growth and which  is one of his best even to the present time.    In 1911 he issued a volume entitled \"Electric Poetry\" (\"Poesie  elettriche\"), whose futurist cover was the only futuristic feature it  had. There is no humming, puffing, whirring to convey that  steam-and-gasoline-engine modernity which it should have in order to  justify the name. Its lines are too refined, too pussy-foot, too  pathetic, too tender-minded for that. Were it not for the perfect  equality of the sexes to-day we would be tempted to say they had a  feminine quality. Daintiness does not express it; neither does unvirile.    There is none of this quality in his next production--the \"Hymn on the  Death of Sergio.\" \"Neve\" (\"The Snow\") appeared in 1914; \"Rarefazione\"  (\"Rarefactions\") in 1915. The latter is a weird collection of childish  figures designed by the poet and commented upon by him to such effect as  to demonstrate a state of latent infantilism. In the same year he  published a volume entitled \"The Inauguration of the Spring\"  (\"L'Inaugurazione della Primavera\"), which contains most of Govoni's  best work in poems. His last book, a series of short stories, \"La Santa  Verde\" (\"The Ardent Saint\"), adds nothing to his fame. Most of them are  insignificant, colorless, reliefless, purposeless.    An attempt has been made by champions of Corrado Govoni to show that  \"Base rivals, who true wit and merit hate\" are forming a cabal to  prevent his getting his deserts. Fiumi, his last champion, does not  materially advance his claim.    Such, in all their diversity, are the Futurists. There is no common  formula which describes them. They have a programme which, like that of  the Socialists, must from its very nature lack specificity. They are not  very definitely organized and many who enrolled under their banner in  the enthusiasm of youth soon deserted the cause. But meanwhile they got  sufficient inspiration and impetus to throw off the shackles of  tradition and to taste the pleasure of exploration. More often they get  purged of a kind of literary preciosity which makes for their well-being  and usefulness. The programme of the Futurist is of little importance in  itself, but it is of great importance as a symptom of tendencies now  agitating the minds of the younger generation in Italy. It may be that  their efforts will constitute the small end of the wedge by which  Romanticism and Verism shall be burst asunder like the Dragon of Bel's  Temple.          CHAPTER V    GIOVANNI PAPINI AND THE FUTURISTIC LITERARY MOVEMENT IN ITALY      In one of his \"Appreciations\"--depreciations would be the more fitting  word--Signor Papini says he seems to have read or to have said that in  every man there are at least four men: the real man, the man he would  like to be, the man he thinks he is, and the man others think he is. He  is sure to have read it, for he has read widely. Undoubtedly he has also  said it, for he has made a specialty of saying things that have been  said before--even that he has said before.    As for the man he thinks he is, he has written a long autobiography with  plentiful data, from which it may be deduced that he is a man with great  possibilities and a great mission, to wit, to precipitate in Italy a  spiritual revolution, to bring to his countrymen the gospel that it is  time to be up and doing and that intoxication with past successes will  not condone present inertness. He has been chosen to teach men that the  best of life is to be found in purposeful action regardless of  inconsistencies, contradictions, and imperfections; that the ego should  be guided peripherally not centrically; that introspection is the  stepping-stone to mental involution. In reality, he is but one of many  who are proclaiming those tidings in Italy.    The distinction between what he would like to be and what he thinks he  is, is not so marked as in more timid and less articulate souls.  Substantially, it is this same calling of prophecy which is his aim. As  for the man he is, time and his own accomplishments alone will show.  Now, at the zenith of his creative power, he is still a man of promise,  a carrier-pigeon freighted with an important message who, instead of  delivering it, exhausts himself beating his wings in a luminous void.    In Giovanni Papini these four aspects stand out very distinctly. Let us  take them up in inverse order, since what others think of a man is soon  stated and what he really is is a vague goal, to be approached only  distantly, even at the end of this paper. Mr. Reginald Turner says:  \"Papini is by far the most interesting and most important living writer  of Italy. 'L'Uomo Finito' has become a classic in Italy; it is written  in the most distinguished Italian; it can be read again and again with  increasing profit and interest ... its Italian is impeccable and clear.  Mr. J. S. Barnes calls him the most notable personality on the stage of  Italian letters to-day,\" and Signor G. Prezzolini writes: \"His mind is  so vast, so human, that it will win its way into the intellectual  patrimony of Europe.\" I cannot go all the way with these adherents of  Signor Papini. I have talked with scores of cultured Italians about his  writings and I have heard it said, \"He has acquired an enviable mastery  of the Italian language,\" but I have never once heard praise of his  \"impeccable and clear Italian\"; nor do I hold with Mr. Barnes that he is  unquestionably the most notable personality save D'Annunzio on the stage  of Italian letters to-day. We would scarcely call Mr. Shaw the most  notable personality on the stage of English letters to-day. Surely it  would be an injustice to Mr. Kipling, Mr. Wells, and Mr. Conrad. It  might be unjust to Mr. Swinnerton.    Signor Papini is an interesting literary figure, particularly as a sign  of the times. During the past generation there has been in Italy a  profound revolt against what may be called satisfaction with and  reverence for past performances and against slavish subscription to  French, German, and Russian realism. It is to a group of writers who  call themselves Futurists and who see in the designation praise rather  than opprobrium that this salutary, beneficial, and praiseworthy  movement is due.    Signor Papini has publicly read himself out of the party, but apostasy  of one kind or another is almost as necessary to him as food, and most  people still regard him as a Futurist, though he refuses to subscribe to  the clause in the constitution of the literary Futurists of Italy  bearing on love, published by their monarch Signor Marinetti in that  classic of Futuristic literature \"Zang Tumb Tumb\" and in \"Democrazia  Futurista.\"    It is now twenty years since there appeared unheralded in Florence a  literary journal called the _Leonardo_, whose purpose in the main seemed  to be to overthrow certain philosophic and socialistic doctrines,  Positivism and Tolstoian ethics. The particularly noteworthy articles  were signed Gian Falco. It soon became known that the writer was one  Giovanni Papini, a contentious, self-confident youth of peculiarly  inquisitive turn of mind, and of sensitiveness bordering on the  pathological, an omnivorous reader, an aggressive debater. He was hailed  by a group of youthful"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41990"],[0,"The Cid Campeador: A Historical Romance (#15)"],[1,"them return to their own country, where await them, sad  and weeping, their parents, their brethren, their wives, or their  lovers.\"    Almenon blessed his daughter in the depths of his heart, for it was  naturally good, and as Casilda was kind and beautiful, and his only  daughter, he loved her as the apple of his eye. What loving father does  not rejoice when he sees that his children are good and tender-hearted?    The King of Toledo, however, far from complying with Casilda's request,  considered that he was bound to punish her rashness, for to  compassionate Christian captives and plead for their liberty was a  crime, according to the traditional belief of those of his race and  religion.    For this reason he concealed the contentment of his soul; for this  reason he said to Casilda, with a stern look and threatening voice--    \"Depart, unbeliever! be silent, unworthy princess! Your tongue shall be  cut out, and your body cast into the flames, for such is the punishment  merited by the Moslim who pleads for the Nazarenes.\"    And he was about to summon his executioners, in order to hand his  daughter over to them.    Casilda, however, fell again at his feet, asking pardon from him by the  memory of her mother, the late queen, whose death Almenon had now wept  for a year.    And Almenon felt his eyes wet with tears, and he pressed her against his  breast and pardoned her, kissing her at the same time; he said,  however--    \"Take care, my daughter, not to plead again for the Christians, nor even  to feel pity for them, for then I shall have neither pardon nor  compassion for you.\"    The maiden, nevertheless, walked again in the gardens, and the wailings  of the captives came again to her ears; charity strengthened her heart  and illumined her soul.    The princess bribed with gold one of the guards of the dungeons, and  from that time she went every day, bringing food and consolation to the  poor captives.    One day she was carrying food concealed in the folds of her garments,  when she suddenly met her father on a winding path, bordered by  rose-bushes.    It was a morning in springtime; the roses were expanding their blooms  all around; the birds were singing in the branches of the trees; the sun  was just beginning to cast his rays on the limpid jets of the fountains;  and the air was sweetened with the most delicious odours.    \"What are you doing here so early?\" asked Almenon of the maiden.    \"My father,\" answered the princess, becoming as red as the roses which  the morning breeze was agitating by her side, \"I have come to gaze upon  and enjoy the odour of those flowers, to hear the carols of the birds,  and to see the sun's rays sparkling in the fountains.\"    \"What are you carrying in the folds of your dress?\" asked the king in a  stern voice.    \"Roses which I have gathered from these bushes,\" replied Casilda,  imploring from the bottom of her heart the aid of a holy being named  Mary, of whom, when she was a child, she had heard the Christian slave  speaking.    And Almenon, doubting her answer, opened the folds of her dress, and a  shower of roses fell upon the ground.    From that day the princess redoubled her assistance and her consolations  towards the captives; from that day she was more loved by her father;  from that day she adored, on the altar of her heart, the Nazarene  Divinity, and felt an ardent desire to adore Him in the Christian  temples. God, who sometimes leads His creatures to their good by the  strangest paths, struck down the bodily health of Casilda by a disease,  which withered the roses on her cheeks and filled Almenon and his Court  with uneasiness and fear.    The most famous physicians of Seville and Cordova were summoned to  Toledo; but they exhausted their science, and could not restore the  princess to health.    Almenon then wrote to the King of Leon and Castile, asking him to send  the best physician at his Court, and Don Fernando hastened to comply  with his request, for he also had daughters whom he loved, as Almenon  loved his.    The Leonese doctor came to the conclusion that the only chance of saving  the princess was by sending her to Castile, in which there was a lake,  the waters of which had great curative virtues, especially regarding the  disease from which Casilda was suffering.    And she went to Castile, entrusted by her father to the care of Don  Fernando, and having bathed in the lake of San Vicente, which is in the  province of Briviesca, she recovered her health, and the roses again  bloomed on her cheeks.    However, when the waters of the lake of San Vicente had healed her body,  Casilda desired that the waters of the Jordan should heal her soul, and  she received baptism, her godfather and godmother being the King and  Queen of Castile and Leon.    Her father learned soon that she had embraced the faith of the Nazarene,  and sent her word that he wished to see her no more. Casilda wept, for  she knew that her father also wept; but Jesus, who had restored to  health the daughter of Jairus, who had suffered as she had done, said,  \"There is no man, that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or  father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for My sake, and the  gospel's, but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses,  and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with  persecutions: and in the world to come eternal life.\" And Casilda  desired to follow the Nazarene.    She then determined to consecrate her life to penitence, where the  tumult of worldly passions could not interrupt her in her holy task, and  where, at the same time, she could practise charity towards all who  might be in need of it.    The lake of San Vicente was situated in a lonely, rugged country, and  thus the poor invalids who went to seek health in its waters could find  no person to extend hospitality to them, and very many died from the  cold of the winter, or the heat of the summer, both of which were  excessive in that region.    Casilda erected there a hermitage, and resolved to pass her life in it,  dedicating herself to the service of God, and to the care of suffering  and despairing human beings.    One day she saw a number of persons, some riding and some on foot, who  were making their way towards her humble abode, situated on the margin  of the lake. A litter, drawn by a horse, came on in the rear, in which  she thought she perceived two women. She believed that some invalids  were coming in search of health, as frequently happened, on account of  the beneficial qualities of the waters of the lake, and she hastened to  meet them, in order to offer them her charitable care and the  hospitality of her dwelling. Indeed, one at least of the two women who  occupied the litter appeared to be in a very weakly state, to judge from  the pallor and emaciation of her face. Casilda had arrived within a  short distance of the litter, and seeing that its drivers were in doubt  as to the way they should go, for the ground was very rough and covered  with brambles, amongst which it was difficult to discern the paths that  led towards the lake and the hermitage of the solitary, she said to the  strangers--    \"If you are coming to my dwelling-place, where I shall willingly receive  you, I shall guide you to it by the shortest and easiest path.\"    \"Yes,\" replied the pale woman in the litter, \"we were proceeding to your  dwelling, and may God recompense you for any kindness and hospitality  you show us.\"    Casilda then walked on towards her hermitage, and the litter followed.    When all had arrived at the door, the women descended from the vehicle,  and Casilda recognised the younger of the women, who also knew her. They  embraced each other warmly.    \"Ximena!\" exclaimed the daughter of Almenon, \"you in those solitudes!  Why, notwithstanding the emaciation of your face, did I not at once  recognise you--you to whom I was offering hospitality, as if to a  stranger, rather than to one whom I hold deep in my heart?\"    \"You see me here, Casilda,\" said Ximena,--\"you see me here, seeking, not  the health of my body in the waters of this lake, but that of my soul in  solitude, in mortification, in prayer, and in charitable works; I  therefore desire to be your companion in this holy and peaceful  retreat.\"    \"You are indeed welcome, friend of my soul! who thus abandons the  pleasures of the Court, in order to serve God and humanity in this  desert. Come into my dwelling, which is yours also, and take some  repose, for you have indeed need of it, as has also this worthy lady,  after the fatigues of your journey.\"    In truth, Ximena and Lambra, for now we know that they were the  travellers, were almost dead with weariness, for they had been obliged  to go a considerable portion of the way on foot, as some of the paths  were so rugged and bad that it would have been dangerous to remain in  the litter.    Immediately afterwards, Ximena sent away the vassals and servants who  had accompanied her, and entered the hermitage with Casilda, opening her  heart to her, as she would have opened it to her mother, if God had left  her by her side to strengthen her soul in the violent storm through  which it was passing.    We have seen that these two noble maidens knew each other formerly.  Ximena indeed had several opportunities of meeting Casilda during the  time she had spent at the Court of Don Fernando, previous to her  baptism, and two good and generous souls need but a short time to  understand each other. They understood and loved each other in a few  days.    Let us now leave them together in that solitude, which worldly cares did  not disturb, for other sad souls, like that of Ximena, call upon us to  reveal their griefs to the world.
