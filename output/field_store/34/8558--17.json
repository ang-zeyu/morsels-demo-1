Big  tail would come around and eat every scrap; this would be done for  two or three nights in succession, and then the hunter would think  the fox's fears were allayed, and carefully put two or three traps  and the bait as usual. Next morning the bait would be gone, as  before, but he would find his traps turned up side down.      [Illustration: FOX TRAPS WITH DRAGS.]    The fox we will say would pass and repass at a certain up-turned root  or a point of trees, then the hunter would think a trap in his beaten  track would surely nip him. Not so, however. The trap would be nicely  concealed, but old Reynard would deflex his road to suit the  circumstances. Smoking, greasing, or all the usual modes of taking  the smell from the iron traps were of no avail; when a trap was set  where his supper was spread, that old fox would begin by digging a  trench from a distance off in a straight line for the hidden traps,  the closer he got to the danger the slower and more cautiously he  would work. This we could see plainly next morning by standing  outside his works and reading his signs.    There were better and older trappers in the field after this old  stayer's life, but it was given to me to circumvent his maneuvers and  possess his fur. I had reset my traps near the bait two nights in  succession in the exact place where he had turned them over, and of  course he burrowed along his old trench to get at them. This I  carefully noted and set another trap in the trench on edge. Something  told me I was going to be successful, and I hardly slept that night.  I was on my snowshoes and off at the first grey of the February  morning. Before I got to the point where my traps were set I saw his  fresh tracks leading off in the same direction I was going. My heart  beat with expectation and anticipation as I hurried forward; it was  not for the value of the beast, but to have it to say I had killed  the cunning fox of 1871 where all the old hunters had failed.    Yes there he was sure enough, as I turned the last point; I could  hardly credit my good fortune, and was so afraid that he would even  now escape that I walked right on top of him with my snowshoes. He  was pinned down tight with my weight and was powerless to even  wriggle. I slipped my left hand under the snowshoe and with my other  hand pulled down his heart; a quiver or two and that fox was a good  fox.    Indians never strike or shoot either foxes, mink or marten when they  find them alive in the traps, as it causes the blood to collect and  congeal where the blow was given, and spoils the looks of the skin,  besides the annoyance of the blood when skinning. They hold the  animal by the neck and with the other hand pull down the heart until  the heart-strings break, and death is as sudden as if the spine were  severed.        CHAPTER XVIII.    FOX SHOOTING.    The fox, although the cleverest animal sought after by New England  hunters and trappers, says L. W. Beardsley, of Connecticut, seems to  have one decided drawback, that of sight, which frequently costs him  his life. Sly and clever with very acute nose and ear, he appears to  be unable to tell a man from a tree or stone by sight alone, provided  the person remains motionless, but the slightest motion is detected  and sends him dusting for cover. The above I have proved to my entire  satisfaction time and again when hunting this animal, a few instances  of which I will quote below.    While walking along the tracks of the Berkshire Division R. R., which  were bounded on the west by a steep hill with a fence three boards  high, placed horizontally about eight inches apart skirting the  track, I noticed beneath the lower board the legs of a fox moving  toward me some seventy-five yards away. I stopped between the rails,  half raising my 38-40 Stevens, telescope mounted, and waited for a  favorable shot. When some thirty yards away the fox crawled under the  fence and trotted down the bank immediately in front of me, where I  stood in plain view. He stopped in the middle of the track and looked  towards me unconcernedly for several seconds, then swung his head  down the tracks in the direction of a train which was rapidly  approaching from the south. This was my chance. I brought the cross  hairs to bear just back of his foreleg and pulled. With one mighty  bound in the air he fell back across the rails without a struggle,  and I had to do some hustling to pull him out of the way before the  train was upon us.      [Illustration: KILLED BEFORE BREAKFAST.]    Again I was sitting on a stone, my back against a wall in an open  pasture lot waiting in hopes a fox might use the runway which passed  close by. I had been waiting quietly since 4 A. M. It was now 6:30,  and I had nearly given up hopes of seeing a fox that morning and was  getting perhaps rather careless about watching, when something  rustled in the grass, and raising my eyes without moving my head, I  saw a red fox in the act of passing in front of me not more than ten  or fifteen feet away in the open lot.    I remained motionless until he was well past, then raising my gun  slowly and carefully I fired at the back of his head as he was  trotting leisurely away, all unconscious of my presence, and perhaps  only saw twenty-five yards off. The fox never knew what had killed  him, and I often wonder if that load of shot surprised him more than  his sudden appearance surprised me, as I sat dozing on the rock. I  used on this occasion a 10 ga. full choke Winchester, level action  repeater Model 1901, loaded with 4 1/2 drs. black powder and 1 1/4  oz. B. shot.    Late one afternoon several years ago while out hunting grey squirrel  at Swamp Mortar Rock with Wm. E. Howes I, who was hunting about 200  yards south of \"Bill,\" heard a fox barking just over a rise of  ground, and cautiously approaching saw two foxes digging at the roots  of a decayed stump. Just as I was getting within effective gun shot  range I stepped on a twig which snapped with my weight. The sound  started the animals. Neither saw me, however, as I had remained  perfectly motionless. The moment the twig broke one took a course due  east, the other quartered toward me disappearing in the thick  laurels. There was a small opening in these bushes opposite me, and  with cocked gun trained on this spot I waited the appearance of the  fox.    In a moment he was in the clearing, and as he was stepping over a log  about 30 yards away I gave him my right barrel and tumbled him over,  and as he endeavored to get up I put on the finishing touches with my  left. I was using a Baker full choke 28 in. 12 ga. loaded with 3 1/4  drs. black powder with 1 1/8 oz. No. 7 shot.      [Illustration: RESULTS OF A THREE DAYS HUNT.]    While looking for woodchuck signs early one spring on my way to  pasture, I was following a old logging road when I saw a fox crossing  in front of me and disappear in the ferns, going toward a high ledge  west of the road. I stood still and waited. When the fox reached the  lower part of the ledge he stopped about 75 or 80 yards from me and  sat down. When his head was turned away I would sneak cautiously a  few feet nearer, always standing motionless when he looked my way,  and thus reduced the distance between us to about 50 yards.    At this point just as I was about to shoot the fox, who was partially  concealed with leaves and ferns, moved some 10 yards up the ledge and  was getting uneasy, although he had not seen me, and the wind was  unfavorable for closer approach. I waited and he climbed nearly to  the top of the ledge and laid down on a flat rock in the sun. With  the utmost caution I slowly crawled back to the road and approached  his foxship from the west, keeping some large rocks between us until  I had approached within 35 yards. He was sitting up, breast toward me  as I cautiously peeped over a rock, but his head was turned away, so  I stepped out into plain view, leveling my gun as I did so. Slowly  the fox turned his head and faced me, but he appeared to see nothing  unusual in the silent figure clad in the worn gray hunting coat,  brown overalls and soft brown hat.    I could see him twitch his ears and blink his eyes lazily in the  glare of the setting sun. Fully a minute I stood admiring the  picture. It seemed a pity to kill this clever fellow I had so easily  outwitted. My eye dropped a little lower, the brass bead trembled on  his breast, and through the faint haze of smokeless powder I saw the  old quail thief kicking and struggling in the edge of the ledge. A  moment later he toppled over his carcass, bounding from rock to rock  in its 50 foot descent. I was using a 12 ga. full choke 30 in.  Stevens, smokeless and B shot.    Another time I was sitting in the woods for grey squirrel early in  October. It was about 5:30 A. M. and just getting light. I heard the  tread of an animal behind me and the rustle of leaves, which ceased a  few feet away. By rolling my eyes and slightly moving my head I could  see the outlines of a fox standing behind me, hardly ten feet away.  Cautiously I attempted to move the muzzle of my gun in his direction,  but he detected me immediately and disappeared midst the laurels like  a flash.    Although he had stood two or three minutes within a few feet of me  before I attempted to turn evidently trying to figure out what I was,  not until I had made a movement did he realize he was so near his old  enemy, \"man,\" which goes to show that Mr. Fox, with every other sense  alert, is like many other of his wild brethren, unable to tell man  from an inanimate by mere sight alone, when he remains motionless.        CHAPTER XIX.    A SHREWD FOX.    Several years ago, when foxes were more numerous here than they are  now, the writer, R. B., of Canada, in company with two other hunters,  went on a fox hunting expedition. We had two dogs which had not been  trained but would follow a trail"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34093"],[0,"Mink Trapping: A Book of Instruction Giving Many Methods of Trapping (#15)"],[1,"set  too carefully, for a theft may not mean merely the loss of a trap,  but possibly a valuable pelt as well. An excellent mode of  concealment is to cut several fir, pine or hemlock shrubs and stick  them up, as if growing about the pen, which is most likely to attract  the eye. Also throw a scraggily top of some kind into the water over  the ring-pole to hide the catch after drowning. Lastly, rearrange as  naturally as possible the leaves and dead stuff disturbed in your  work, see that nothing has fallen on the trap, spatter a little water  about and your set is complete.    Another good way is to drop two traps side by side in shallow water,  surround each by a little circle of rocks and hang the bait by a  thread about 12 inches above them. In trying to reach the bait Mr.  Mink runs a good chance of blundering into one of the traps.    Better yet, get a shallow box having a weatherworn appearance, bore  half inch holes in the sides, and sink in the brook so that the water  coming in through the holes will cover the bottom to a depth of three  inches. Drape the sides with moss and weeds, put in some live trout  and two or three traps along with them, and for those mink that are  so particular as to want to take their food alive, you have a set  that insures them a warm reception.    Yet another method is to find an over-hanging bank with a narrow  strip of beach between it and the water. Beginning at the water,  drive stakes at an acute angle out to the bank, both up and down the  stream. At the apex of the V shaped fence thus formed place trap  under water. No bait is needed.    I was speaking of water sets. One more and I will pass on to the land  set, for though an almost endless variety of the former could be  given those presented, with such modifications as will suggest  themselves under varying conditions, will serve as a very good  elementary education for the young trapper. The following was given  me by an old trapper: We were riding together near a brook when he  said, \"I set a trap here three years ago, which I have never had an  opportunity to visit, but I will wager you there is a mink in it if  it is to be found.\" Whereupon he left me for a few minutes, returning  triumphantly with the trap and the skeleton of a mink's foot in the  jaws.    His way was to go along to shallow rifles, pin a piece of meat to the  bottom, place the trap a few inches below it, and a little above  drive a short line of stakes at right angles to the current to keep  off drift. High water or low, cold weather or warm, you were sure, he  asserted, of every mink that came up or down the stream. And my own  experience has gone very far towards making this claim good.    Now, all of the foregoing sets are easily made, and may be used by  the novice, after a little practice, with every probability of fair  success, but when we leave the water for dry land greater  difficulties will be encountered. There is a smell about iron which  wild animals are quick to detect and recognize as an indication of  danger. Water destroys this scent, but of course in the land set this  advantage is lost.    Various directions are given for killing it by smoking or steeping,  but I have found that if the trap be properly covered there is small  need of spending time in this way. And right here let me say that in  dry sets success hinges largely on the skill with which you cover  your trap, especially if bait be used, and it is best to use bait  until one has gained a pretty good idea of the habits of his game.  The bait may be protected by a pen of stakes such as is described in  my first water set, but placed a little back from the water in as dry  a place as possible.    At the entrance dig a cavity somewhat larger than a trap, with a  shallow trench leading around to one side for chain. Line with fine  sprigs of hemlock, and set trap evenly and firmly. The hemlock will  not only keep trap and chain from freezing down (a thing to be  carefully avoided) but also help to neutralize that tell-tale smell  of metal. Get some moss of a dry, fibrous nature, and containing no  earthly matter to freeze. That found on rocks is generally the best.  Tear out a crescent-shaped piece of a size to half fill trap, and  fitting snugly between pan and jaw and two small pieces to fill in on  back or trigger side of pan--or only one piece, like the first, if  using a trap with spring on the outside.    If you have done your work properly, the inside of the trap is  completely filled, from jaws to pan, with no chance for anything to  get under the pan, and no wad of batting beneath it (as is used by  some) to become swollen with moisture and prevent its free working.  Now go around trap on the outside with moss, pressing it in so as  nearly to cover jaws, lay a thin leaf over pan, and cover with well  pulverized rotten wood, which may be found in any old stump.    Lastly, throw on bits of leaf and pinches of dirt until it resembles  as nearly as possible the surrounding ground. Don't be afraid of  covering too heavily, so long as you don't put too much over hinges  of jaws. You want it so that the iron will not be washed bare with  the first rain. But avoid any appearance of a mound, as nothing  arouses an animal's suspicions quicker than this. The chain may be  covered with loose earth and stump dust. Some advise hitching to a  clog, but I generally use a stake, and seldom, ever lose a mink by  footing. But if a green stake is used be careful to smear the exposed  end with mud to remove its fresh appearance, and to secure the bait  use a dead stick invariably.    Many guide books speak of leaves as a covering for the trap, but the  fact is that dry leaves are something that the mink habitually  avoids, doubtless not liking the rustling sound given out in  traveling over them; hence it is best to use them in land sets  sparingly, and to locate your trap so that the shy fellow will not  have to wallow through a carpeting of them to reach it.    I have had excellent luck by placing trap at the edge of a bank a  foot or so high, with a good runway underneath. The mink smells the  bait from below and springing up to investigate often lands plump in  the trap, when if he had been afforded the chance for a closer  inspection he might have gone on without troubling it. You may think  this a small thing, but it is just such trifles that circumvent the  shy fellows.    In making your set do all the work from the back side; also approach  on the same side when visiting. Go no nearer than necessary to see  that everything is all right, and make your stay in the vicinity as  short as possible. If any part of the trap has become exposed cover  with stump dust. A small fir stuck down by the trap with branches  projecting over it will serve as a protection from rain and snow, but  is seldom needed when trap is covered as above described.    Always be on the lookout for places to set when hunting or fishing.  Let your eyes run along the strips of beach and boggy, peer under  overhanging banks and among piles of drift, and scrutinize closely  every log spanning streams. You will be surprised to find how often  you will hit upon footprints, droppings, holes and runways, the  knowledge of which will be of the utmost value to you when the  trapping season arrives.      [Illustration: SOME NEW YORK STATE SKINS.]    If you trap the same section year after year you will get to know the  favorable points so well as to do with half the traps necessary at  the beginning, and get much better results at that; for one trap in  the right place is worth half a dozen, clapped down haphazzard. Some  places are good for one or more mink every year; an old hollow log  near the water, a passageway among roots or under a fallen tree  trunk, a narrow shelf along the face of the bluff, a particular hole  or den--any of these, if kept guarded by a well set trap, may prove a  little bonanza for you every season. In such places it is better to  use no bait, a little fish oil perhaps excepted, as you will then  take unawares many a sly old fellow to whom a morsel of meat, no  matter how cunningly arranged, would be simply a signboard of danger.    I remember well my first experience at this style of trapping mink. I  noticed what looked to be a well worn little path on the bank of a  stream leading down under a big pile of drift. As an experiment I  placed a trap in this path, and to my delight found a fine mink  waiting me at my next visit. Two more mink followed within a week in  the same place, while a trap nearby carefully set and baited was not  molested.    I had supposed I knew about all there was to trapping, but this  opened my eyes a bit. I began searching out and setting in similar  places, with the result that my usual catch was doubled that season.  One day on looking into a hole which had rotted into the foot of a  big ash standing on the bank of a stream I saw a small dead fish  lying among the roots as if it had been left there by some creature  that had taken itself off at my approach. I promptly clapped two  traps into the cavity, taking care not to disturb the fish, and soon  after had a mink as a reward for my trouble.    But the best natural situation I ever discovered was under a high,  overhanging bank--just the sort of roadway every mink coming along  that side of the stream would be sure to choose--at a point where a  willow tree completely blocked the way, except for a narrow passage  perforating its tangled roots. One trap could guard this effectually,  and, as in the trunk of the old ash, it was entirely protected from  snow or rain. Of course a mink could get around the trunk by taking  to the water, but so far as I could judge they seldom did so, and  each year as long as there were any mink in the vicinity I was sure  of several here.    Mink in fact prefer traveling by land as a rule. For this reason a  trap placed at either end of a log spanning a stream that"]]]
