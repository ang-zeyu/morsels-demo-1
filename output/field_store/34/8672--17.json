[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42243"],[0,"The Hour of the Dragon (#15)"],[1," Valerius boasted had more  hold on the minds of men than the memory of Conan and the freedom and  power he had given the kingdom.    No pursuers followed him down out of the hills. He watched for wandering  or returning Nemedian troops, but met none. Skulkers gave him a wide  path, supposing him to be one of the conquerors, what of his harness.  Groves and rivers were far more plentiful on the western side of the  mountains, and coverts for concealment were not lacking.    So he moved across the pillaged land, halting only to rest his horse,  eating frugally of the food Zelata had given him, until, on a dawn when  he lay hidden on a river bank where willows and oaks grew thickly, he  glimpsed, afar, across the rolling plains dotted with rich groves, the  blue and golden towers of Tarantia.    He was no longer in a deserted land, but one teeming with varied life.  His progress thenceforth was slow and cautious, through thick woods and  unfrequented byways. It was dusk when he reached the plantation of  Servius Galannus.          8    Dying Embers      The countryside about Tarantia had escaped the fearful ravaging of the  more easterly provinces. There were evidences of the march of a  conquering army in broken hedges, plundered fields and looted granaries,  but torch and steel had not been loosed wholesale.    There was but one grim splotch on the landscape--a charred expanse of  ashes and blackened stone, where, Conan knew, had once stood the stately  villa of one of his staunchest supporters.    The king dared not openly approach the Galannus farm, which lay only a  few miles from the city. In the twilight he rode through an extensive  woodland, until he sighted a keeper's lodge through the trees.  Dismounting and tying his horse, he approached the thick, arched door  with the intention of sending the keeper after Servius. He did not know  what enemies the manor house might be sheltering. He had seen no troops,  but they might be quartered all over the countryside. But as he drew  near, he saw the door open and a compact figure in silk hose and richly  embroidered doublet stride forth and turn up a path that wound away  through the woods.    'Servius!'    At the low call the master of the plantation wheeled with a startled  exclamation. His hand flew to the short hunting-sword at his hip, and he  recoiled from the tall gray steel figure standing in the dusk before  him.    'Who are you?' he demanded. 'What is your--_Mitra!_'    His breath hissed inward and his ruddy face paled. 'Avaunt!' he  ejaculated. 'Why have you come back from the gray lands of death to  terrify me? I was always your true liegeman in your lifetime----'    'As I still expect you to be,' answered Conan. 'Stop trembling, man; I'm  flesh and blood.'    Sweating with uncertainty Servius approached and stared into the face of  the mail-clad giant, and then, convinced of the reality of what he saw,  he dropped to one knee and doffed his plumed cap.    'Your Majesty! Truly, this is a miracle passing belief! The great bell  in the citadel has tolled your dirge, days agone. Men said you died at  Valkia, crushed under a million tons of earth and broken granite.'    'It was another in my harness,' grunted Conan. 'But let us talk later.  If there is such a thing as a joint of beef on your board----'    'Forgive me, my lord!' cried Servius, springing to his feet. 'The dust  of travel is gray on your mail, and I keep you standing here without  rest or sup! Mitra! I see well enough now that you are alive, but I  swear, when I turned and saw you standing all gray and dim in the  twilight, the marrow of my knees turned to water. It is an ill thing to  meet a man you thought dead in the woodland at dusk.'    'Bid the keeper see to my steed which is tied behind yonder oak,'  requested Conan, and Servius nodded, drawing the king up the path. The  patrician, recovering from his supernatural fright, had become extremely  nervous.    'I will send a servant from the manor,' he said. 'The keeper is in his  lodge--but I dare not trust even my servants in these days. It is better  that only I know of your presence.'    Approaching the great house that glimmered dimly through the trees, he  turned aside into a little-used path that ran between close-set oaks  whose intertwining branches formed a vault overhead, shutting out the  dim light of the gathering dusk. Servius hurried on through the darkness  without speaking, and with something resembling panic in his manner, and  presently led Conan through a small side-door into a narrow, dimly  illuminated corridor. They traversed this in haste and silence, and  Servius brought the king into a spacious chamber with a high, oak-beamed  ceiling and richly paneled walls. Logs flamed in the wide fireplace, for  there was a frosty edge to the air, and a great meat pasty in a stone  platter stood smoking on a broad mahogany board. Servius locked the  massive door and extinguished the candles that stood in a silver  candlestick on the table, leaving the chamber illuminated only by the  fire on the hearth.    'Your pardon, your Majesty,' he apologized. 'These are perilous times;  spies lurk everywhere. It were better that none be able to peer through  the windows and recognize you. This pasty, however, is just from the  oven, as I intended supping on my return from talk with my keeper. If  your Majesty would deign----'    'The light is sufficient,' grunted Conan, seating himself with scant  ceremony, and drawing his poniard.    He dug ravenously into the luscious dish, and washed it down with great  gulps of wine from grapes grown in Servius' vineyards. He seemed  oblivious to any sense of peril, but Servius shifted uneasily on his  settle by the fire, nervously fingering the heavy gold chain about his  neck. He glanced continually at the diamond-panes of the casement,  gleaming dimly in the firelight, and cocked his ear toward the door, as  if half expecting to hear the pad of furtive feet in the corridor  without.    Finishing his meal, Conan rose and seated himself on another settle  before the fire.    'I won't jeopardize you long by my presence, Servius,' he said abruptly.  'Dawn will find me far from your plantation.'    'My lord----' Servius lifted his hands in expostulation, but Conan waved  his protests aside.    'I know your loyalty and your courage. Both are above reproach. But if  Valerius has usurped my throne, it would be death for you to shelter me,  if you were discovered.'    'I am not strong enough to defy him openly,' admitted Servius. 'The  fifty men-at-arms I could lead to battle would be but a handful of  straws. You saw the ruins of Emilius Scavonus' plantation?'    Conan nodded, frowning darkly.    'He was the strongest patrician in this province, as you know. He  refused to give his allegiance to Valerius. The Nemedians burned him in  the ruins of his own villa. After that the rest of us saw the futility  of resistance, especially as the people of Tarantia refused to fight. We  submitted and Valerius spared our lives, though he levied a tax upon us  that will ruin many. But what could we do? We thought you were dead.  Many of the barons had been slain, others taken prisoner. The army was  shattered and scattered. You have no heir to take the crown. There was  no one to lead us----'    'Was there not Count Trocero of Poitain?' demanded Conan harshly.    Servius spread his hands helplessly.    'It is true that his general Prospero was in the field with a small  army. Retreating before Amalric, he urged men to rally to his banner.  But with your Majesty dead, men remembered old wars and civil brawls,  and how Trocero and his Poitanians once rode through these provinces  even as Amalric was riding now, with torch and sword. The barons were  jealous of Trocero. Some men--spies of Valerius perhaps--shouted that  the Count of Poitain intended seizing the crown for himself. Old  sectional hates flared up again. If we had had one man with dynastic  blood in his veins we would have crowned and followed him against  Nemedia. But we had none.    'The barons who followed you loyally would not follow one of their own  number, each holding himself as good as his neighbor, each fearing the  ambitions of the others. You were the cord that held the fagots  together. When the cord was cut, the fagots fell apart. If you had had  a son, the barons would have rallied loyally to him. But there was no  point for their patriotism to focus upon.    'The merchants and commoners, dreading anarchy and a return of feudal  days when each baron was his own law, cried out that any king was better  than none, even Valerius, who was at least of the blood of the old  dynasty. There was no one to oppose him when he rode up at the head of  his steel-clad hosts, with the scarlet dragon of Nemedia floating over  him, and rang his lance against the gates of Tarantia.    'Nay, the people threw open the gates and knelt in the dust before him.  They had refused to aid Prospero in holding the city. They said they had  rather be ruled by Valerius than by Trocero. They said--truthfully--that  the barons would not rally to Trocero, but that many would accept  Valerius. They said that by yielding to Valerius they would escape the  devastation of civil war, and the fury of the Nemedians. Prospero rode  southward with his ten thousand knights, and the horsemen of the  Nemedians entered the city a few hours later. They did not follow him.  They remained to see that Valerius was crowned in Tarantia.'    'Then the old witch's smoke showed the truth,' muttered Conan, feeling a  queer chill along his spine. 'Amalric crowned Valerius?'    'Aye, in the coronation hall, with the blood of slaughter scarcely dried  on his hands.'    'And do the people thrive under his benevolent rule?' asked Conan with  angry irony.    'He lives like a foreign prince in the midst of a conquered land,'  answered Servius bitterly. 'His court is filled with Nemedians, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4227"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Wireless Message; Or, The Castaways of Earthquake Island (#15)"],[1," Mr.  Damon.    \"Did you shake me?\" inquired Tom.    \"I? No. What--?\"    Then they realized that another earth-tremor was making the whole  island tremble.    Tom leaped from his blankets, followed by Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick,  and rushed outside the shack. They felt the earth shaking, but it  was over in a few seconds. The shock was a slight one, nothing like  as severe as the one in the morning. But it set their nerves on  edge.    \"Another earthquake!\" groaned Mr. Damon. \"How often are we to have  them?\"    \"I don't know,\" answered Tom, soberly.    They passed the remainder of the night sleeping in blankets on the  warm sands, near the fire, for they feared lest a shock might bring  the shack down about their heads. However, the night passed with no  more terrors.          CHAPTER XV    THE OTHER CASTAWAYS      \"Well, we're all alive, at any rate,\" announced Tom, when the bright  sun, shining into his eyes, had awakened him. He sat up, tossed  aside his blankets, and stood up. The day was a fine one, and the  violence of the sea had greatly subsided during the night, their  shack had suffered not at all from the slight shock in the darkness.    \"Now for a dip in old Briney,\" the lad added, as he walked down to  the surf, \"I think it will make me feel better.\"    \"I'm with you,\" added Mr. Fenwick, and Mr. Damon also joined the  bathers. They came up from the waves, tingling with health, and  their bruises and bumps, including Tom's cut leg, felt much better.    \"You did get quite a gash; didn't you,\" observed Mr. Fenwick, as he  noticed Tom's leg. \"Better put something on it. I have antiseptic  dressings and bandages in the airship, if we can find them.\"    \"I'll look for them, after breakfast,\" Tom promised, and following a  fairly substantial meal, considering the exigencies under which it  was prepared, he got out the medicine chest, of which part remained  in the wreck of the WHIZZER, and dressed his wound. He felt much  better after that.    \"Well, what's our program for to-day?\" Mr. Damon wanted to know, as  they sat about, after they had washed up what few dishes they used.    \"Let's make a better house to stay in,\" proposed Mr. Fenwick. \"We  may have to remain here for some time, and I'd like a more  substantial residence.\"    \"I think the one we now have will do,\" suggested Tom. \"I was going  to propose making it even less substantial.\"    \"Why so?\"    \"Because, in the event of an earthquake, while we are sleeping in  it, we will not be injured. Made of light pieces of wood and canvas  it can't harm us very much if it falls on us.\"    \"That's right,\" agreed Mr. Damon. \"In earthquake countries all the  houses are low, and built of light materials.\"    \"Ha! So I recollect now,\" spoke Mr. Fenwick. \"I used to read that in  my geography, but I never thought it would apply to me. But do you  think we will be subject to the quakes?\"    \"I'm afraid so,\" was Tom's reply. \"We've had two, now, within a  short time, and there is no way of telling when the next will come.  We will hope there won't be any more, but--\"    He did not finish his sentence, but the others knew what he meant.  Thereupon they fell to work, and soon had made a shelter that, while  very light and frail, would afford them all the protection needed in  that mild climate, and, at the same time, there would be no danger  should an earthquake collapse it, and bring it down about their  heads while they were sleeping in it.    For they decided that they needed some shelter from the night dews,  as it was exceedingly uncomfortable to rest on the sands even  wrapped in blankets, and with a driftwood fire burning nearby.    It was noon when they had their shack rebuilt to their liking, and  they stopped for dinner. There was quite a variety of stores in the  airship, enough for a much larger party than that of our three  friends, and they varied their meals as much as possible. Of course  all the stuff they had was canned, though there are some salted and  smoked meats. But canned food can be had in a variety of forms  now-a-days, so the castaways did not lack much.    \"What do you say to an exploring expedition this afternoon?\" asked  Tom, as they sat about after dinner. \"We ought to find out what kind  of an island we're on.\"    \"I agree with you,\" came from Mr. Fenwick. \"Perhaps on the other  side we will stand a much better chance of speaking some passing  vessel. I have been watching the horizon for some time, now, but I  haven't seen the sign of a ship.\"    \"All right, then we'll explore, and see what sort of an island we  have taken possession of,\" went on Tom.    \"And see if it isn't already in possession of natives--or  cannibals,\" suggested Mr. Damon. \"Bless my frying pan! but I should  hate to be captured by cannibals at my time of life.\"    \"Don't worry; there are none here,\" Tom assured him again.    They set out on their journey around the island. They agreed that it  would be best to follow the beach around, as it was easier walking  that way, since the interior of the place consisted of rugged rocks  in a sort of miniature mountain chain.    \"We will make a circuit of the place,\" proposed Tom, \"and then, if  we can discover nothing, we'll go inland. The centre of the island  is quite high, and we ought to be able to see in any direction for a  great distance from the topmost peak. We may be able to signal a  vessel.\"    \"I hope so!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"I want to send word home that I am  all right. My wife will worry when she learns that the airship, in  which I set out, has disappeared.\"    \"I fancy we all would like to send word home,\" added Mr. Fenwick.  \"My wife never wanted me to build this airship, and, now that I have  sailed in it, and have been wrecked, I know she'll say 'I told you  so,' as soon as I get back to Philadelphia.\"    Tom said nothing, but he thought to himself that it might be some  time before Mrs. Fenwick would have a chance to utter those  significant words to her husband.    Following the beach line, they walked for several miles. The island  was larger than they had supposed, and it soon became evident that  it would take at least a day to get all around it.    \"In which case we will need some lunch with us.\" said Tom. \"I think  the best thing we can do now is to return to camp, and get ready for  a longer expedition to-morrow.\"    Mr. Fenwick was of the same mind, but Mr. Damon called out:    \"Let's go just beyond that cliff, and see what sort of a view is to  be had from there. Then we'll turn back.\"    To oblige him they followed. They had not gone more than a hundred  yards toward the cliff, than there came the preliminary rumbling and  roaring that they had come to associate with an earthquake. At the  same time, the ground began to shiver and shake.    \"Here comes another one!\" cried Tom, reeling about. He saw Mr. Damon  and Mr. Fenwick topple to the beach. The roaring increased, and the  rumbling was like thunder, close at hand. The island seemed to rock  to its very centre.    Suddenly the whole cliff toward which they had been walking,  appeared to shake itself loose. In another instant it was flung  outward and into the sea, a great mass of rock and stone.    The island ceased trembling, and the roaring stopped. Tom rose to  his feet, followed by his companions. He looked toward the place  where the cliff had been. Its removal by the earthquake gave them a  view of a part of the beach that had hitherto been hidden from them.    And what Tom saw caused him to cry out in astonishment. For he  beheld, gathered around a little fire on the sand, a party of men  and women. Some were standing, clinging to one another in terror.  Some were prostrate on the ground. Others were running to and fro in  bewilderment.    \"More castaways!\" cried Tom. \"More castaways,\" and, he added under  his breath, \"more unfortunates on earthquake island!\"          CHAPTER XVI    AN ALARMING THEORY      For a few seconds, following Tom's announcement to his two  companions, neither Mr. Damon nor Mr. Fenwick spoke. They had arisen  from the beach, where the shock of the earthquake had thrown them,  and were now staring toward the other band of castaways, who, in  turn were gazing toward our three friends. There was a violent  agitation in the sea, caused by the fall of the great cliff, and  immense waves rushed up on shore, but all the islanders were beyond  the reach of the rollers.    \"Is it--do I really--am I dreaming or not?\" at length gasped Mr.  Damon.    \"Is this a mirage, or do we really see people, Tom?\" inquired Mr.  Fenwick.    \"They are real enough people,\" replied the lad, himself somewhat  dazed by the unexpected appearance of the other castaways.    \"But how--why--how did they get here?\" went on the inventor of the  WHIZZER.    \"As long as they're not cannibals, we're all right,\" murmured Mr.  Damon. \"They seem to be persons like ourselves, Tom.\"    \"They are,\" agreed the lad, \"and they appear to be in the same sort  of trouble as ourselves. Let's go forward, and meet them.\"    The tremor of the earthquake had now subsided, and the little band  that was gathered about a big fire of driftwood was calmer. Those  who had fallen, or who had thrown themselves on the sand, arose, and  began feeling of their arms and legs to see if they had sustained  any injuries. Others advanced toward our friends.    \"Nine of them,\" murmured Tom, as he counted the little band of  castaways, \"and they don't seem to have been able to save much from  the wreck of their craft, whatever it was.\" The beach all about them  was bare, save for a boat drawn up out of reach of high water.    \"Do you suppose they are a party from some disabled airship, Tom,\"  asked Mr. Fenwick.    \"Not from an airship,\" answered the lad. \"Probably from some vessel  that was wrecked in the gale. But we will soon find out who they  are.\"    Tom led the way for his two friends. The fall of the cliff had made  a rugged path around the base of it, over rocks, to"]]]
