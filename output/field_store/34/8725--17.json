Note too how casual is the  allusion to a matter which is elsewhere the chief and most favoured  theme of the Book of Kings!  And there is besides all this the  serious difficulty, also already referred to above, that the man  from whom Hezekiah must, from the nature of the case, have received  the impulse to his reformatory movement, the prophet Isaiah, in  one of his latest discourses expressly insists on a cleansing  merely of the local sanctuaries from molten and graven images,  that is to say, does not desire their complete removal.  So much at  least is certain that, if the alleged fact at present under  discussion amounts to anything at all /1/    **********************************  1. Little importance is to be attached to 2Kings xviii.22.  The narrative of the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem is not a contemporary  one, as appears generally from the entirely indefinite character of  the statements about the sudden withdrawal of the Assyrians and its causes,  and particularly from xix.7, 36, 37.  For in this passage the meaning  certainly is that Sennacherib was assassinated soon after the unsuccessful  expedition of 701, but in point of fact he actually reigned until  684 or 681 (Smith, Assyrian Eponym Canon, pp. 90, 170).  Thus the  narrator writes not twenty years merely after the event, but so  long after it as to make possible the elision of those twenty  years:  probably he is already under the influence of  Deuteronomy.  2Kings xviii.4 is certainly of greater weight than  2Kings xviii.22.  But although highly authentic statements have  been preserved to us in the epitome of the Book of Kings, they  have all, nevertheless, been subjected not merely to the  selection, but also to the revision of the Deuteronomic redactor,  and it may very well be that the author thought himself  justified in giving his subject a generalised treatment, according  to which the cleansing (of the temple at Jerusalem in the first  instance) from idols, urged by Isaiah and carried out by  Hezekiah, was changed into an abolition of the Bamoth with their  Macceboth and Asherim.  It is well known how indifferent later  writers are to distinctions of time and degree in the heresy of  unlawful worship; they always go at once to the completed  product.  But in actual experience the reformation was doubtless  accomplished step by step.  At first we have in Hosea and Isaiah  the polemic directed against molten and graven images, then in  Jeremiah that against wood and stone, i.e., against Macceboth and  Asherim; the movement originated with the prophets, and the chief,  or rather the only, weight is to be attached to their authentic  testimony.  *************************************    Hezekiah only made a feeble and wholly ineffectual attempt in this  direction, and by no means \"carried out the unification in Judah with  tolerable thoroughness.\"  At the same time, one might concede even  this last point, and yet not give any ground for the theory at  which Noldeke wishes to arrive.    For his assumption is that the effort after unity had its old and  original seat precisely in the priestly circles of Jerusalem.  If  the Priestly Code is older than Deuteronomy, then of course the  prophetic agitation for reform of worship in which Deuteronomy had  its origin must have been only the repetition of an older  priestly movement in the same direction.   But of the latter we  hear not a single word, while we can follow the course of the  former fairly well from its beginnings in thought down to its  issue in a practical result.  It was Amos, Hosea, and Isaiah who  introduced the movement against the old popular worship of the high  places; in doing so they are not in the least actuated by a  deep-rooted preference for the temple of Jerusalem, but by ethical  motives, which manifest themselves in them for the first time in  history, and which we can see springing up in them before our very  eyes: their utterances, though historically occasioned by the  sanctuaries of northern Israel, are quite general, and are directed  against the cultus as a whole.  Of the influence of a point of view  even remotely akin to the priestly position that worship in this  or that special place is of more value than anywhere else, and on  that account alone deserves to be preserved, no trace is to be  found in them; their polemic is a purely prophetic one, i.e.,  individual, \"theopneust\" in the sense that it is independent of all  traditional and preconceived human opinions.  But the subsequent  development is dependent upon this absolutely original  commencement, and has its issue, not in the Priestly Code, but in  Deuteronomy, a book that, with all reasonable regard for the  priests (though not more for those of Jerusalem than for the  others), still does not belie its prophetic origin, and above all  things is absolutely free from all and every hierocratic  tendency.  And finally, it was Deuteronomy that brought about the  historical result of Josiah's reformation.  Thus the whole  historical movement now under our consideration, so far as it was  effective and thereby has come to our knowledge, is in its origin  and essence prophetic, even if latterly it may have been aided by  priestly influences; and it not merely can, but must be  understood from itself.  Any older or independent contemporary  priestly movement in the same direction remained at least entirely  without result, and so also has left no witnesses to itself.  Perhaps it occurs to us that the priests of Jerusalem must after  all have been the first to catch sight of the goal, the attainment  of which afterwards brought so great advantage to themselves, but  it does not appear that they were so clever beforehand as we are  after the event.  At least there are no other grounds for the  hypothesis of a long previously latent tendency towards  centralisation on the part of the Jerusalem priesthood beyond the  presumption that the Priestiy Code must chronologically precede,  not Deuteronomy merely, but also the prophets.  For the sake of  this presumption there is constructed a purely abstract (and as  such perfectly irrefragable) possibility that furnishes a door of  escape from the historical probability, which nevertheless it is  impossible to evade.    How absolutely unknown the Priestly Code continued to be even  down to the middle of the exile can be seen from the Books of  Kings, which cannot have received their present shape earlier than  the death of Nebuchadnezzar.  The redactor, who cites the  Deuteronomic law and constantly forms his judgment in accordance  with it, considered (as we have learned from 1Kings iii.2) that  the Bamoth were permissible prior to the building of Solomon's  temple; the tabernacle therefore did not exist for him.  Jeremiah,  who flourished about a generation earlier, is equally ignorant of  it, but--on account of the ark, though not necessarily in  agreement with traditional opinion--regards the house of God at  Shiloh (whose ruins, it would seem, were at that time still  visible) as the forerunner of the temple of Jerusalem, and in this  he is followed by the anonymous prophecy of 1Samuel ii.27-36, the  comparatively recent date of which appears from the language  (ii.33), and from the circumstance that it anticipates the  following threatening in iii.  In all these writers, and still more  in the case of the Deuteronomist himself, who in xii. actually  makes the unity of the cultus dependent on the previous choice of  Jerusalem, it is an exceedingly remarkable thing that, if the  Priestly Code had been then already a long time in existence,  they should have been ignorant of a book so important and so  profound in its practical bearings.  In ancient Hebrew literature  such an oversight could not be made so easily as, in similar  circumstances, with the literature of the present day.  And how  comes it to pass that in the Book of Chronicles, dating from the  third century, the Priestly Code suddenly ceases to be, to all  outward seeming, dead, but asserts its influence everywhere over  the narrative in only too active and unmistakable a way?  To  these difficulties Noldeke is unreasonably indifferent.  He seems  to be of the opinion that the post-exilian time would not have  ventured to take in hand so thoroughgoing an alteration, or rather  reconstruction, of tradition as is implied in antedating the temple  of Solomon by means of the tabernacle. /1/    ************************************************  1.

For what reason does Chronicles stand in the canon at all,  if not in order to teach us this?

In Madrid all this is unknown.  And the hearth, that consecrated stone, cold in summer, cold in our  absence, but warm and friendly during the happy winter evenings when  all the children are brought together and grouped about the old  people,--for the colleges have their vacations, the married daughters  bring their little ones home on a visit, and the absent ones, the  prodigal sons, come back to the heart of the family,--where, tell  me, where is this hearth in the houses of the capital? Can we call  a French mantel-piece, made of marble, bronze, and iron, a hearth,  that which one can buy at a store, at wholesale or retail, and can  even hire, if need be? The French mantel-piece is the symbol of home  in a great city. People of Madrid, that is your hearth,--a hearth  subject to the changes of fashion, a hearth which is sold when it is  old, which can be moved from room to room, from street to street, and  which can even be pawned in an emergency.      VIII.    I wandered through a street. Far above my head, from a high story, my  grandmother's prophetic couplet floated down to me amid the shock of  glasses, the rattle of dishes, and the merry laughter of girls.          \"Christmas comes,        Christmas goes;      But soon we all shall be of those        Who come back--never!\"    \"Here,\" thought I, \"is a home, a hearth, with almond soup and a  gilt-head, which I could buy for four dollars!\" Just then a woman  came up to me, begging. She had two children, one in her arms wrapped  in her ravelled shawl, the other clinging to her hand. Both were  crying; I thought the mother was crying too.      IX.    I do not know how I happen to be in this café. The clock strikes  midnight, the hour when the Christ was born. I am here, alone, in a  boisterous crowd. I have fallen to analyzing my life since I left my  father's roof, and for the first time I am horror-stricken at the  painful struggle of the poet in Madrid,--a struggle in which so much  affection, so much peace, is sacrificed to a vain ambition.    I have watched the bards of the nineteenth century writing the local;  I have watched the Muse, scissors in hand, making clippings; I have  seen men who in other ages would have written a national epic busily  patching up editorials to rehabilitate a party and earn fifty dollars  a month.    Poor children of God! Poor poets! Antonio Trueba, to whom I dedicate  this article, says,--    \"I have found so many thorns on my journey that my heart aches, my  soul aches!\"    And so much for my present Christmas Eve!    Then I travel back, in thought, through the bygone years. I am surely  missed at home to-night; and my mother shivers when the wind moans  in the chimney, as though those moans were my dying sighs. And she  says to the neighbors, \"In such a year, when he was with us,\" or, \"I  wonder where he is now!\"    Ah, I cannot bear this! I wave you a farewell from my soul, dear  ones! I am ambitious; I am an ingrate, a bad brother, a bad son! How  can I explain it? A supernatural force leads me on, whispering, \"Thou  shalt be!\" The voice of damnation that spoke to me in my very cradle.  And what, pray, am I to be, poor wretch that I am?        \"Soon we all shall be of those        Who come back--never!\"    Ah, I do not want to go! I shall not go! I have struggled too hard to  fail. I shall return. I will triumph in life and in death. Is there  to be no compensation for the infinite anguish of my soul?      X.    It is very late, and that couplet of the dead still rings in my  brain,--          \"Christmas comes,        Christmas goes;      But soon we all shall be of those        Who come back--never!\"    \"Yes, yes; other Christmas Eves will come,\" thought I, as a child;  and I dreamed of the future and built castles in the air. I saw  myself the centre of a family, as yet unborn, in the second twilight  of life when the flowers of love come to fruit. That storm of love  and tears which wrecks me now was passed; my head was at rest in the  lap of patience, crowned with the melancholy flowers of the last,  true affections. I was a husband, a father, the support of a home, of  a family.    The flame of an unknown hearth sparkled in the distance, and in its  vacillating light I saw strange beings that made me throb with pride;  they were my sons. Then I wept, and I closed my eyes to prolong the  vision of that reddish light and the prophetic apparition of the  unborn. The grave was near; my locks were gray. But what of that?  Would not half of my life remain in these children of love? Would  not half of my soul remain with their mother? In vain did I try to  recognize this wife, who was to share the twilight of my life. This  future companion whom God holds for me sat with her back to me. I  could not see her face. I looked for the reflection of her features  in the faces of my sons, but the light from the hearth began to fail.    When it was out I still saw her, because I felt the warmth of her in  my soul. I murmured:        \"Christmas comes,      Christmas--\"    And I was asleep, perhaps dead.    [Illustration]          I TAKE SUPPER WITH MY WIFE.    From the French of GUSTAVE DROZ.      It was Christmas Eve, and a devilishly cold night. The snow fell  in great flakes, which the wind beat against the window-panes. The  distant chimes reached us, confused and faint through the heavy,  cottony atmosphere. The passers-by, muffled in their cloaks, glided  along hurriedly, brushing by the walls of the houses, bending their  heads before the wind. Wrapped in my dressing-gown, I smiled as I  drummed on the window-pane, smiled at the passers-by, at the north  wind and the snow, with the smile of a happy man who is in a warm  room with his feet in a pair of flannel-lined slippers which sink  into a thick, soft carpet.    My wife sat in a corner of the hearth with a great piece of cloth  before her which she cut and trimmed off; and every now and then she  raised her eyes, which met mine. A new book lay on the mantel-piece  awaiting me, and a log in the fireplace whistled as it spit out those  little blue flames which tempt one to poke it.    \"There is nothing so stupid as a man trudging along in the snow. Is  there?\" said I.    \"Sh-h-h!\" said my wife, laying down her scissors. Then she stroked  her chin thoughtfully with her tapering pink fingers, slightly plump  at the extremities, and looked over very carefully the pieces she had  just cut out.    \"I say that it is absurd to go out into the cold when it is so easy  to stay at home by the fire.\"    \"Sh-h-h!\"    \"What the deuce are you doing that is so important?\"    \"I--I am cutting out a pair of suspenders for you;\" and she resumed  her task. Her hair was coiled a little higher than usual; and where I  stood, behind her, I could just see, as she leaned over her work, the  nape of her neck, white and velvety. Innumerable soft little locks  curled there gracefully, and this pretty down reminded me of those  ripe peaches into which we drive our teeth greedily. I leaned nearer  to see and--kissed my wife on the neck.    \"Monsieur!\" exclaimed Louise, turning suddenly around.    \"Madame!\" and we both burst into a laugh.    \"Come, come; on Christmas Eve!\"    \"Monsieur apologizes?\"    \"Madame complains?\"    \"Yes; Madame complains. Madame complains of your not being more  moved, more thrilled by the spirit of Christmas. The ding-ding-dong  from the bells of Notre Dame awakens no emotion in you; and when the  magic-lantern went by under your very window, you were perfectly  unmoved, utterly indifferent. I watched you attentively, though I  pretended to work.\"    \"Unmoved? Indifferent? I? When the magic lantern went by! Ah, my  dear! you judge me very severely, and really--\"    \"Yes, yes; laugh if you will. It is nevertheless true that the pretty  memories of your childhood are lost.\"    \"Come, my pet, would you like me to stand my boots in the fireplace  to-night before I go to bed? Would you like me to stop the  magic-lantern man and go and get him a sheet and a candle-end, as  my mother used to do? I can almost see her as she handed him the  sheet. 'Be careful you don't tear it, now,' she would say; and we all  clapped our hands in the mysterious obscurity. I remember all those  joys, dear; but, you see, so many things have happened since. Other  pleasures have obliterated those.\"    \"Yes, I understand,--the pleasures of your bachelorhood! Come, now,  I am sure this is the first Christmas Eve that has ever found you  by your own fireside, in your dressing-gown and without a supper,  because you always had supper; that goes without saying--\"    \"Why, I don't know--\"    \"Yes, yes; I wager you always had a supper.\"    \"Well, perhaps I did, once or twice, although I scarcely remember;  I may have had supper with a few old friends. And what did it all  amount to? Two pennies' worth of chestnuts and--\"    \"And a glass of sugar and water.\"    \"Well, just about. Oh, it was nothing much, I can assure you! It  sounds great at a distance. We talked awhile, and then we went to  bed.\"    \"And he says all that with the straightest face! You have never  breathed a word of these simple pleasures to me.\"    \"But, my dear, what I tell you is the absolute truth. I remember  once, however, at Ernest's, when I was in rather high spirits, we had  a little music afterwards--Will you push me that log? Well, never  mind; it is almost midnight, and time for all reasonable people to--\"    (Louise, rising and throwing her arms around me.) \"Well, I don't  choose to be reasonable, and I mean to eclipse the memory of those  penny chestnuts and all that sugar and water!\" (Pushing me hastily  into my study, and locking the door.)    \"What the deuce is the matter with you, my dear?\" I cried from the  other side of the partition.    \"Give me ten minutes, no more. Your paper is on the mantel-piece; you  have not seen it to-night. You will find the matches in the corner.\"    Then I heard"]]]
