To Him be the honour and glory, and the grace of the action.    We took counsel, and resolved to navigate along the coast of this  continent towards the east, and never to lose sight of the land. We sailed  along until we came to a point where the coast turned to the south. The  distance from the landfall to this point was nearly 300 leagues.[122]  In this stretch of coast we often landed, and had friendly relations  with the natives,[123] as I shall presently relate. I had forgotten to  tell you that from Cape Verde to the first land of this continent the  distance is nearly 700 leagues; although I estimate that we went over more  than 1,800, partly owing to ignorance of the route, and partly owing to  the tempests and foul winds which drove us off our course, and sent us  in various directions. If my companions had not trusted in me, to whom  cosmography was known, no one, not the leader of our navigation, would  have known where we were after running 500 leagues. We were wandering  and full of errors, and only the instruments for taking the altitudes  of heavenly bodies showed us our position. These were the quadrant and  astrolabe, as known to all. These have been much used by me with much  honour; for I showed them that a knowledge of the marine chart, and the  rules taught by it, are more worth than all the pilots in the world. For  these pilots have no knowledge beyond those places to which they have  often sailed. Where the said point of land showed us the trend of the  coast to the south, we agreed to continue our voyage, and to ascertain  what there might be in those regions. We sailed along the coast for  nearly 500 leagues, often going on shore and having intercourse with the  natives, who received us in a brotherly manner. We sometimes stayed with  them for fifteen or twenty days continuously, as friends and guests, as  I shall relate presently. Part of this continent is in the Torrid Zone,  beyond the equinoctial line towards the South Pole. But it begins at 8 deg.  beyond the equinoctial. We sailed along the coast so far that we crossed  the Tropic of Capricorn, and found ourselves where the Antarctic Pole  was 50 deg. above our horizon. We went towards the Antarctic Circle until  we were 17 deg. 30' from it[124]; all which I have seen, and I have known  the nature of those people, their customs, the resources and fertility  of the land, the salubrity of the air, the positions of the celestial  bodies in the heavens, and, above all, the fixed stars, over an eighth  of the sphere, never seen by our ancestors, as I shall explain below.    As regards the people: we have found such a multitude in those countries  that no one could enumerate them, as we read in the Apocalypse. They are  people gentle and tractable, and all of both sexes go naked, not covering  any part of their bodies, just as they came from their mothers' wombs,  and so they go until their deaths. They have large, square-built bodies,  and well proportioned. Their colour reddish, which I think is caused by  their going naked and exposed to the sun. Their hair is plentiful and  black. They are agile in walking, and of quick sight. They are of a  free and good-looking expression of countenance, which they themselves  destroy by boring the nostrils and lips, the nose and ears; nor must  you believe that the borings are small, nor that they only have one,  for I have seen those who had no less than seven borings in the face,  each one the size of a plum. They stop up these perforations with blue  stones, bits of marble, of crystal, or very fine alabaster, also with  very white bones and other things artificially prepared according to their  customs; which, if you could see, it would appear a strange and monstrous  thing. One had in the nostrils and lips alone seven stones, of which some  were half a palm in length. It will astonish you to hear that I considered  that the weight of seven such stones was as much as sixteen ounces. In  each ear they had three perforations bored, whence they had other stones  and rings suspended. This custom is only for the men, as the women do  not perforate their faces, but only their ears. Another custom among  them is sufficiently shameful, and beyond all human credibility. Their  women, being very libidinous, make the penis of their husbands swell to  such a size as to appear deformed; and this is accomplished by a certain  artifice, being the bite of some poisonous animal, and by reason of this  many lose their virile organ and remain eunuchs.    They have no cloth, either of wool, flax, or cotton, because they have  no need of it; nor have they any private property, everything being  in common. They live amongst themselves without a king or ruler, each  man being his own master, and having as many wives as they please. The  children cohabit with the mothers, the brothers with the sisters, the  male cousins with the female, and each one with the first he meets.  They have no temples and no laws, nor are they idolaters. What more  can I say! They live according to nature, and are more inclined to be  Epicurean than Stoic. They have no commerce among each other, and they  wage war without art or order. The old men make the youths do what they  please, and incite them to fights, in which they mutually kill with  great cruelty. They slaughter those who are captured, and the victors  eat the vanquished; for human flesh is an ordinary article of food  among them. You may be the more certain of this, because I have seen  a man eat his children and wife; and I knew a man who was popularly  credited to have eaten 300 human bodies. I was once in a certain city  for twenty-seven days, where human flesh was hung up near the houses,  in the same way as we expose butcher's meat. I say further that they were  surprised that we did not eat our enemies, and use their flesh as food,  for they say it is excellent. Their arms are bows and arrows, and when  they go to war they cover no part of their bodies, being in this like  beasts. We did all we could to persuade them to desist from their evil  habits, and they promised us to leave off. The women, as I have said,  go naked, and are very libidinous, yet their bodies are comely; but they  are as wild as can be imagined.    They live for 150 years, and are rarely sick. If they are attacked by  a disease they cure themselves with the roots of some herbs. These are  the most noteworthy things I know about them.    The air in this country is temperate and good, as we were able to learn  from their accounts that there are never any pestilences or epidemics  caused by bad air. Unless they meet with violent deaths, their lives  are long. I believe this is because a southerly wind is always blowing,  a south wind to them being what a north wind is to us. They are expert  fishermen, and the sea is full of all kinds of fish. They are not hunters;  I think because here there are many kinds of wild animals, principally  lions and bears, innumerable serpents, and other horrible creatures and  deformed beasts; also because there are vast forests and trees of immense  size. They have not the courage to face such dangers naked and without  any defence.    The land is very fertile, abounding in many hills and valleys, and in  large rivers, and is irrigated by very refreshing springs. It is covered  with extensive and dense forests, which are almost impenetrable, and  full of every kind of wild beast. Great trees grow without cultivation,  of which many yield fruits pleasant to the taste and nourishing to the  human body; and a great many have an opposite effect. The fruits are  unlike those in our country; and there are innumerable different kinds  of fruits and herbs, of which they make bread and excellent food. They  also have many seeds unlike ours. No kind of metal has been found except  gold, in which the country abounds, though we have brought none back in  this our first navigation. The natives, however, assured us that there  was an immense quantity of gold underground, and nothing was to be had  from them for a price. Pearls abound, as I wrote to you.    If I was to attempt to write of all the species of animals, it would  be a long and tedious task. I believe certainly that our Pliny did not  touch upon a thousandth part of the animals and birds that exist in this  region; nor could an artist such as Policletus,[125] succeed in painting  them. All the trees are odoriferous, and some of them emit gums, oils,  or other liquors. If they were our property, I do not doubt but that  they would be useful to man. If the terrestrial paradise is in some part  of this land, it cannot be very far from the coast we visited. It is,  as I have told you, in a climate where the air is temperate at noon,  being neither cold in winter nor hot in summer.    The sky and air are serene during a great part of the year. Thick vapours,  with fine rain falling, last for three or four hours and then disappear  like smoke. The sky is adorned with most beautiful signs and figures,  in which I have noted as many as twenty stars as bright as we sometimes  see Venus and Jupiter. I have considered the orbits and motions of these  stars, and I have measured the circumference and diameters of the stars  by a geometrical method,[126] ascertaining which were the largest. I  saw in the heaven three _Canopi_, two certainly bright, and the other  obscure. The Antarctic Pole is not figured with a Great Bear and a Little  Bear, like our Arctic Pole, nor is any bright star seen near it, and  of those which go round in the shortest circuit there are three which  have the figure of the orthogonous triangle, of which the smallest has  a diameter of 9 half-degrees. To the east of these is seen a _Canopus_  of great size, and white, which, when in mid-heaven, has this figure:--          *"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36962"],[0,"My Attainment of the Pole (#15)"],[1,"of only a single family or perhaps two,  but we found it unusually large and populous, for the best hunters had  gathered here for the winter bear hunt. Their summer game catch had been  very lucky. Immense quantities of meat were strewn along the shore,  under mounds of stone. More than a hundred dogs, the standard by which  Eskimo prosperity is measured, yelped a greeting, and twelve  long-haired, wild men came out to meet us as friends.    It came strongly to me that this was the spot to make the base for a  Polar dash. Here were Eskimo helpers, strong, hefty natives from whom I  could select the best to accompany me; here, by a fortunate chance, were  the best dog teams; here were plenty of furs for clothing; and here was  unlimited food. These supplies, combined with supplies on the schooner,  would give all that was needed for the campaign. Nothing could have been  more ideal.    For the past several days, having realized the abundance of game and the  auspicious weather, I had thought more definitely of making a dash for  the Pole. With all conditions in my favor, might I not, by one powerful  effort, achieve the thing that had haunted me for years? My former  failures dogged me. If I did not try now, it was a question if an  opportunity should ever again come to me.    Now every condition was auspicious for the effort. I confess the task  seemed audacious almost to the verge of impossibility. But, with all  these advantages so fortunately placed in my hands, it took on a new and  almost weird fascination. My many years of schooling in both Polar zones  and in mountaineering would now be put to their highest test.    Yes, I would try, I told myself; I believed I should succeed. I informed  Mr. Bradley of my determination. He was not over-optimistic about  success, but he shook my hand and wished me luck. From his yacht he  volunteered food, fuel, and other supplies, for local camp use and  trading, for which I have been thankful.    \"Annoatok\" means \"a windy place.\" There is really nothing there to be  called a harbor; but we now planned to bring the schooner to this point  and unload her on the rocky shore, a task not unattended with danger.  However, the base had to be made somewhere hereabout, as Etah itself is  still more windy than Annoatok. Moreover, at Etah the landing is more  difficult, and it was not nearly so convenient for my purpose as a base.    Besides, there were gathered at Annoatok, as I have described, with  needed food and furs in abundance, the best Eskimos[5] in all Greenland,  from whom, by reason of the rewards from civilization which I could  give them, such as knives, guns, ammunition, old iron, needles and  matches, I could select a party more efficient, because of their  persistence, tough fibre, courage and familiarity with Arctic traveling,  than any party of white men could be.    The possible combination of liberal supplies and valiant natives left  absolutely nothing to be desired to insure success, so far as  preliminaries were concerned. It was only necessary that good health,  endurable weather and workable ice should follow. The expenditure of a  million dollars could not have placed an expedition at a better  advantage. The opportunity was too good to be lost. We therefore  returned to Etah to prepare for the quest.    At Etah, practically everything that was to be landed at Annoatok was  placed on deck, so that the dangerous stop beside the rocks of Annoatok  could be made a brief one. The ship was prepared for the contingency of  a storm.    Late in the evening of August 26, the entire population of Etah was  taken aboard, the anchor was tripped, and soon the _Bradley's_ bow put  out on the waters of Smith Sound for Annoatok. The night was cold and  clear, brightened by the charm of color. The sun had just begun to dip  under the northern horizon, which marks the end of the summer double  days of splendor and begins the period of storms leading into the long  night. Early in the morning we were off Annoatok.    The launch and all the dories were lowered and filled. Eskimo boats were  pressed into service and loaded. The boats were towed ashore. Only a few  reached Annoatok itself, for the wind increased and a troublesome sea  made haste a matter of great importance. Things were pitched ashore  anywhere on the rocks where a landing could be found for the boats.    The splendid efficiency of the launch proved equal to the emergency, and  in the course of about thirteen hours all was safely put on shore in  spite of dangerous winds and forbidding seas. That the goods were spread  along the shore for a distance of several miles did not much matter, for  the Eskimos willingly and promptly carried them to the required points.    Now the time had come for the return of the schooner to the United  States. Unsafe to remain longer at Annoatok at this advanced stage of  the season, it was also imperative that it go right on with barely a  halt at any other place. The departure meant a complete severance  between the civilized world and myself. But I do not believe, looking  back upon it, that the situation seemed as awesome as might be supposed.  Other explorers had been left alone in the Northland, and I had been  through the experience before.    The party, so far as civilized men were concerned, was to be an  unusually small one. That, however, was not from lack of volunteers, for  when I had announced my determination many of the crew had volunteered  to accompany me. Captain Bartlett himself wished to go along, but  generously said that if it seemed necessary for him to go back with the  schooner, he would need only a cook and engineer, leaving the other men  with me.    I wanted only one white companion, however, for I knew that no group of  white men could possibly match the Eskimos in their own element. I had  the willing help of all the natives, too, at my disposal. More than that  was not required. I made an agreement with them for their assistance  throughout the winter in getting ready, and then for as many as I wanted  to start with me toward the uttermost North. For my white companion I  selected Rudolph Francke, now one of the Arctic enthusiasts on the  yacht. He had shipped for the experience of an Arctic trip. He was a  cultivated young German with a good scientific schooling. He was strong,  goodnatured, and his heart was in the prospective work. These were the  qualities which made him a very useful man as my sole companion.    Early on the morning of September 3, I bade farewell to Mr. Bradley, and  not long afterward the yacht moved slowly southward and faded gradually  into the distant southern horizon. I was left alone with my destiny,  seven hundred miles from the Pole.          BEGINNING PREPARATIONS FOR THE POLAR DASH    THE ARCTIC SOLITUDE--RETROSPECTION AND INTROSPECTION--THE DETERMINATION  TO ACHIEVE--PLANNING OUT THE DETAILS OF THE CAMPAIGN--AN ENTIRE TRIBE  BUSILY AT WORK    V    THE POLE, THE ROUTE, AND THE INCENTIVE      When the yacht disappeared I felt a poignant pang at my heart. After it  had faded, I stood gazing blankly at the sky, and I felt the lure of the  old world. The yacht was going home--to the land of my family and  friends. I was now alone, and, with the exception of Francke, there was  no white man among this tribe of wild people with whom to converse  during the long Arctic night that was approaching. I knew I should not  be lonely, for there was a tremendous lot of work to do, although I had  unstinted assistance. In every detail, the entire six months of labor  including the catching of animals, the drying of meat, the making of  such clothes and sledges as would be necessary, and the testing of them,  would have to be managed by myself. Turning from the rocky highland  where I stood, a wild thrill stirred my heart. The hour of my  opportunity had come. After years of unavailing hopes and depressing  defeats my final chance was presented! In the determination to succeed,  every drop of blood in my body, every fibre of me responded.    Why did I desire so ardently to reach the North Pole? What did I hope to  gain? What, if successful, did I expect to reap as the result of my  dreams? These questions since have been asked by many. I have searched  the chambers of my memory and have tried to resolve replies to myself.  The attaining of the North Pole meant at the time simply the  accomplishing of a splendid, unprecedented feat--a feat of brain and  muscle in which I should, if successful, signally surpass other men. In  this I was not any more inordinately vain or seekful of glory than one  who seeks pre-eminence in baseball, running tournaments, or any other  form of athletics or sport.    At the time, any applause which the world might give, should I succeed,  did not concern me; I knew that this might come, but it did not enter  into my speculations.    For years I had felt the lure of the silver glamor of the North, and I  can explain this no more than the reason why a poet is driven to express  himself in verse, or why one child preternaturally develops amazing  proficiency in mathematics and another in music. Certain desires are  born or unconsciously developed in us. I, with others before me, found  my life ambition in the conquest of the Pole. To reach it would mean, I  knew, an exultation which nothing else in life could give.    This imaginary spot held for me the revealing of no great scientific  secrets. I never regarded the feat as of any great scientific value.  The real victory would lie, not in reaching the goal itself, but in  overcoming the obstacles which exist in the way of it. In the battle  with these I knew there would be excitement, danger, necessary  expedients to tax the brain and heroic feats to tax the muscles, the  ever constant incentive which the subduing of one difficulty after  another excites.    During the first day at Annoatok, after the yacht left, I thought of the  world toward"]]]
