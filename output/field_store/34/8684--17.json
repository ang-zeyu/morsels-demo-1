The best features of which Zog could boast were his arms and hands,  the latter being as well formed, as delicate and white as those of a  well-bred woman. When he spoke, his voice sounded sweet and clear,  and its tones were very gentle. He had given them a few moments to  stare at him, for he was examining them in turn with considerable  curiosity. \"Well,\" said he, \"do you not find me the most hateful  creature you have ever beheld?\"    The queen refrained from answering, but Trot said promptly, \"We do.  Nothing could be more horrider or more disgustin' than you are, it  seems to me.\"    \"Very good, very good indeed,\" declared the monster, lifting his  lashes to flash his glowing eyes upon them. Then he turned toward  Cap'n Bill. \"Man-fish,\" he continued, \"what do YOU think of me?\"    \"Mighty little,\" the sailor replied. \"You orter be 'shamed to ask  sech a question, knowin' you look worse ner the devil himself.\"    \"Very true,\" answered Zog, frowning. He felt that he had received a  high compliment, and the frown showed he was pleased with Cap'n  Bill.    But now Queen Aquareine advanced to a position in front of their  captor and said, \"Tell me, Zog, why have you trapped us and brought  us here?\"    \"To destroy you,\" was the quick answer, and the magician turned for  an instant to flash his eyes upon the beautiful mermaid. \"For two  hundred years I have been awaiting a chance to get within my power  some friend of Anko the Sea Serpent--of Anko, whom I hate!\" he  added, smiling sweetly. \"When you left your palace today, my swift  spies warned me, and so I sent the sea devils to capture you. Often  have they tried to do this before, but always failed. Today, acting  by my command, they tricked you, and by surrounding you forced you  to the entrance of my enchanted castle. The result is a fine capture  of important personages. I have now in my power the queen and  princess of the fairy mermaids, as well as two wandering earth  people, and I assure you I shall take great pleasure in destroying  you utterly.\"    \"You are a coward,\" declared the Queen proudly. \"You dared not meet  us in the open sea.\"    \"No, I dare not leave this castle,\" Zog admitted, still smiling.  \"But here in my own domain my power is supreme. Nothing can  interfere with my vengeance.\"    \"That remains to be seen,\" said Aquareine, firmly meeting the gaze  of the terrible eyes.    \"Of course,\" he answered, nodding his head with a graceful movement.  \"You will try to thwart me and escape. You will pit your fairy power  against my powers of magic. That will give me great pleasure, for  the more you struggle, the greater will be my revenge.\"    \"But why should you seek revenge upon us?\" asked Clia. \"We have  never harmed you.\"    \"That is true,\" replied Zog. \"I bear you no personal ill will. But  you are friends of my great enemy, King Anko, and it will annoy him  very much when he finds that you have been destroyed by me. I cannot  hurt the rascally old sea serpent himself, but through you I can  make him feel my vengeance.\"    \"The mermaids have existed thousands of years,\" said the Queen in a  tone of pride. \"Do you imagine the despised and conquered Zog has  power to destroy them?\"    \"I do not know,\" was the quiet answer. \"It will be interesting to  discover which is the more powerful.\"    \"I challenge you to begin the test at once, vile magician!\"  exclaimed Aquareine.    \"There is no hurry, fair Queen,\" answered Zog in his softest tones.  \"I have been so many years in accomplishing your capture that it is  foolish to act hastily now. Besides, I am lonely. Here in my forced  retirement I see only those uninteresting earth mortals whom I have  made my slaves, for all sea dwellers are forbidden to serve me save  the sea devils, and they dare not enter my castle. I have saved many  mortals from drowning and brought them here to people my castle, but  I do not love mortals. Two lovely mermaids are much more  interesting, and before I allow you to perish, I shall have much  amusement in witnessing your despair and your struggles to escape.  You are now my prisoners. By slow degrees I shall wear out your  fairy powers and break your hearts, as well as the hearts of these  earth dwellers who have no magic powers, and I think it will be a  long time before I finally permit you to die.\"    \"That's all right,\" said Trot cheerfully. \"The longer you take, the  better I'll be satisfied.\"    \"That's how I feel about it,\" added Cap'n Bill. \"Don't get in a  hurry to kill us Zog. It'll be such a wear an' tear on your nerves.  Jes' take it easy an' let us live as long as we can.\"    \"Don't you care to die?\" asked the magician.    \"It's a thing I never longed for,\" the sailor replied. \"You see, we  had no business to go on a trip with the mermaids to begin with.  I've allus heard tell that mermaids is dangerous, an' no one as met  'em ever lived to tell the tale. Eh, Trot?\"    \"That's what you said, Cap'n Bill.\"    \"So I guess we're done for, one way 'r 'nother, an' it don't matter  much which. But Trot's a good child, an' mighty young an' tender. It  don't seem like her time has come to die. I'd like to have her sent  safe home to her mother. So I've got this 'ere proposition to make,  Zog. If your magic could make ME die twice, or even THREE times fer  good measure, why you go ahead an' do it an' I won't complain. All I  ask is fer you to send this little girl safe back to dry land  again.\"    \"Don't you do it, Zog!\" cried Trot indignantly, and turning to Cap'n  Bill, she added, \"I'm not goin' to leave you down here in all this  mess, Cap'n, and don't you think it. If one of us gets out of the  muddle we're in, we'll both get out, so don't you make any bargains  with Zog to die twice.\"    Zog listened to this conversation very carefully. \"The dying does  not amount to much,\" he said. \"It is the thinking about it that  hurts you mortals most. I've watched many a shipwreck at sea, and  the people would howl and scream for hours before the ship broke up.  Their terror was very enjoyable. But when the end came, they all  drowned as peacefully as if they were going to sleep, so it didn't  amuse me at all.\"    \"I'm not worrying,\" said Trot.    \"Ner me,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"You'll find we can take what comes jes'  as easy as anybody.\"    \"I do not expect to get much from you poor mortals,\" said Zog  carelessly. \"You are merely a side show to my circus, a sort of  dessert to my feast of vengeance. When the time comes, I can find a  hundred ways to kill you. My most interesting prisoners are these  pretty mermaids, who claim that none of their race has ever yet died  or been destroyed. The first mermaid ever created is living yet, and  I am told she is none other than Queen Aquareine. So I have a pretty  problem before me to invent some way to destroy the mermaids or put  them out of existence. And it will require some thought.\"    \"Also, it will require some power you do not possess,\" suggested the  Queen.    \"That may be,\" replied Zog softly. \"But I am going to experiment,  and I believe I shall be able to cause you a lot of pain and sorrow  before I finally make an end of you. I have not lived twenty-seven  thousand years, Aquareine, without getting a certain amount of  wisdom, and I am more powerful than you suspect.\"    \"You are a monster and a wicked magician,\" said the Mermaid Queen.    \"I am,\" agreed Zog, \"but I cannot help it. I was created part man,  part bird, part fish, part beast and part reptile, and such a  monstrosity could not be otherwise than wicked. Everybody hates me,  and I hate everybody.\"    \"Why don't you kill yourself?\" asked Trot.    \"I've tried that and failed,\" he answered. \"Only one being in the  world has power to destroy me, and that is King Anko, the sea  serpent.\"    \"Then you'd better let him do it,\" advised the little girl.    \"No. Much as I long to die, I cannot allow King Anko the pleasure of  killing me. He has always been my worst enemy, and it would be such  a joy to him to kill me that I really cannot allow him. Indeed, I  have always hoped to kill Anko. I have now been three thousand six  hundred and forty-two years, eleven months and nine days figuring  out a plan to destroy old Anko, and as yet I have not discovered a  way.\"    \"I'd give it up, if I were you,\" advised Trot. \"Don't you think you  could get some fun out of trying to be good?\"    \"No!\" cried Zog, and his voice was not so soft as before. \"Listen,  Aquareine, you and your attendants shall be prisoners in this castle  until I can manage to stop you from living. Rooms will be placed at  your disposal, and I wish you to go to them at o nce, as I am tired  of looking at you.\"    \"You're no more tired than we are,\" remarked Trot. \"It's lucky you  can't see yourself, Zog.\"    He turned his glowing eyes full upon her. \"The worst of my queer  body I keep concealed,\" he said. \"If ever you see it, you will  scream with terror.\" He touched a bell beside him, and the girl was  surprised to find how clearly its tones rang out through the water.  In an instant the boy Sacho appeared and bowed low before his  dreadful master. \"Take the mermaids and the child to the Rose  Chamber,\" commanded Zog, \"and take the old man-fish to the Peony  Room.\"    Sacho turned to obey. \"Are the outer passages well guarded?\" asked  the monster.    \"Yes, as you have commanded,\" said the boy.    \"Then you may allow the prisoners to roam at will throughout the  castle. Now, go!\"    The prisoners followed Sacho from the room, glad to get away. The  presence of this evil being had grown oppressive to them, and Zog  had himself seemed ill at ease during the last few minutes. The robe  so closely wound around his body moved jerkily, as if something  beneath disturbed it, and at such times Zog shifted nervously in his  seat.    Sacho's thin little legs trotted through the water and led the way  into a different passage from the one by which they had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/436"],[0,"The Master Key (#15)"],[1,"the idea, and nodded his head  repeatedly, holding out his hand for the ring.  Rob had little  confidence in the man's honor, but he was so eager to regain the tube  that he decided to trust him.  So he threw the ring to the top of the  wall, where the Turk caught it skilfully; but when Rob held out his  hand for the tube the scoundrel only laughed at him and began to  scramble to his feet in order to beat a retreat.  Chance, however,  foiled this disgraceful treachery, for in his hurry the Turk allowed  the tube to slip from his grasp, and it rolled off the wall and fell  upon the sand at Rob's very feet.    The robber turned to watch its fall and, filled with sudden anger, the  boy grabbed the weapon, pointed it at his enemy, and pressed the  button.  Down tumbled the Turk, without a cry, and lay motionless at  the foot of the wall.    Rob's first thought was to search the pockets of his captive, and to  his delight he found and recovered his box of food tablets.  The Record  of Events and the traveling machine were doubtless in the possession of  the other robbers, but Rob did not despair of recovering them, now that  he had the tube to aid him.    Day was now breaking, and several of the Tatars appeared and examined  the body of the Turk with grunts of surprise, for there was no mark  upon him to show how he had been slain.  Supposing him to be dead, they  tossed him aside and forgot all about him.    Rob had secured his ruby ring again, and going to the chief's tent he  showed the jewel to the guard and was at once admitted.  The  black-bearded chieftain was still reclining upon his pillows, but Rob  bowed before him, and by means of signs managed to ask for a band of  warriors to assist him in assaulting the town.  The chieftain appeared  to doubt the wisdom of the enterprise, not being able to understand how  the boy could expect to succeed; but he graciously issued the required  order, and by the time Rob reached the city gate he found a large group  of Tatars gathered to support him, while the entire camp, roused to  interest in the proceedings, stood looking on.    Rob cared little for the quarrel between the Turks and Tatars, and  under ordinary circumstances would have refused to side with one or the  other; but he knew he could not hope to recover his electrical machines  unless the city was taken by the band of warriors who had befriended  him, so he determined to force an entrance for them.    Without hesitation he walked close to the great gate and shattered its  fastenings with the force of the electric current directed upon them  from the tube.  Then, shouting to his friends the Tatars for  assistance, they rushed in a body upon the gate and dashed it open.    The Turks had expected trouble when they heard the fastenings of the  huge gate splinter and fall apart, so they had assembled in force  before the opening.  As the Tatars poured through the gateway in a  compact mass they were met by a hail of bullets, spears and arrows,  which did fearful execution among them.  Many were killed outright,  while others fell wounded to be trampled upon by those who pressed on  from the rear.    Rob maintained his position in the front rank, but escaped all injury  through the possession of the Garment of Repulsion.  But he took an  active part in the fight and pressed the button of the electric tube  again and again, tumbling the enemy into heaps on every side, even the  horses and camels falling helplessly before the resistless current of  electricity.    The Tatars shouted joyfully as they witnessed this marvelous feat and  rushed forward to assist in the slaughter; but the boy motioned them  all back.  He did not wish any more bloodshed than was necessary, and  knew that the heaps of unconscious Turks around him would soon recover.    So he stood alone and faced the enemy, calmly knocking them over as  fast as they came near.  Two of the Turks managed to creep up behind  the boy, and one of them, who wielded an immense simitar with a  two-edged blade as sharp as a razor, swung the weapon fiercely to cut  off Rob's head.  But the repulsive force aroused in the Garment was so  terrific that it sent the weapon flying backwards with redoubled  swiftness, so that it caught the second Turk at the waist and cut him  fairly in two.    Thereafter they all avoided coming near the boy, and in a surprisingly  short time the Turkish forces were entirely conquered, all having been  reduced to unconsciousness except a few cowards who had run away and  hidden in the cellars or garrets of the houses.    The Tatars entered the city with shouts of triumph, and the chief was  so delighted that he threw his arms around Rob's neck and embraced him  warmly.    Then began the sack of Yarkand, the fierce Tatars plundering the  bazaars and houses, stripping them of everything of value they could  find.    Rob searched anxiously among the bodies of the unconscious Turks for  the two men who had robbed him, but neither could be found.  He was  more successful later, for in running through the streets he came upon  a band of Tatars leading a man with a rope around his neck, whom Rob  quickly recognized as one of the thieves he was hunting for.  The  Tatars willingly allowed him to search the fellow, and in one of his  pockets Rob found the Record of Events.    He had now recovered all his property, except the traveling machine,  the one thing that was absolutely necessary to enable him to escape  from this barbarous country.    He continued his search persistently, and an hour later found the dead  body of the third robber lying in the square in the center of the city.  But the traveling machine was not on his person, and for the first time  the boy began to give way to despair.    In the distance he heard loud shouts and sound of renewed strife,  warning him that the Turks were recovering consciousness and engaging  the Tatars with great fierceness.  The latter had scattered throughout  the town, thinking themselves perfectly secure, so that not only were  they unprepared to fight, but they became panic-stricken at seeing  their foes return, as it seemed, from death to life.  Their usual  courage forsook them, and they ran, terrified, in every direction, only  to be cut down by the revengeful Turkish simitars.    Rob was sitting upon the edge of a marble fountain in the center of the  square when a crowd of victorious Turks appeared and quickly surrounded  him.  The boy paid no attention to their gestures and the Turks feared  to approach him nearly, so they stood a short distance away and fired  volleys at him from their rifles and pistols.    Rob glared at them scornfully, and seeing they could not injure him the  Turks desisted; but they still surrounded him, and the crowd grew  thicker every moment.    Women now came creeping from their hiding places and mingled with the  ranks of the men, and Rob guessed, from their joyous chattering, that  the Turks had regained the city and driven out or killed the Tatar  warriors.  He reflected, gloomily, that this did not affect his own  position in any way, since he could not escape from the oasis.    Suddenly, on glancing at the crowd, Rob saw something that arrested his  attention.  A young girl was fastening some article to the wrist of a  burly, villainous-looking Turk.  The boy saw a glitter that reminded  him of the traveling machine, but immediately afterward the man and the  girl bent their heads over the fellow's wrist in such a way that Rob  could see nothing more.    While the couple were apparently examining the strange device, Rob  started to his feet and walked toward them.  The crowd fell back at his  approach, but the man and the girl were so interested that they did not  notice him.  He was still several paces away when the girl put out her  finger and touched the indicator on the dial.    To Rob's horror and consternation the big Turk began to rise slowly  into the air, while a howl of fear burst from the crowd.  But the boy  made a mighty spring and caught the Turk by his foot, clinging to it  with desperate tenacity, while they both mounted steadily upward until  they were far above the city of the desert.    The big Turk screamed pitifully at first, and then actually fainted  away from fright.  Rob was much frightened, on his part, for he knew if  his hands slipped from their hold he would fall to his death.  Indeed,  one hand was slipping already, so he made a frantic clutch and caught  firmly hold of the Turk's baggy trousers.  Then, slowly and carefully,  he drew himself up and seized the leather belt that encircled the man's  waist.  This firm grip gave him new confidence, and he began to breathe  more freely.    He now clung to the body of the Turk with both legs entwined, in the  way he was accustomed to cling to a tree-trunk when he climbed after  cherries at home.  He had conquered his fear of falling, and took time  to recover his wits and his strength.    They had now reached such a tremendous height that the city looked like  a speck on the desert beneath them.  Knowing he must act quickly, Rob  seized the dangling left arm of the unconscious Turk and raised it  until he could reach the dial of the traveling machine.  He feared to  unclasp the machine just then, for two reasons: if it slipped from his  grasp they would both plunge downward to their death; and he was not  sure the machine would work at all if in any other position than  fastened to the left wrist.    Rob determined to take no chances, so he left the machine attached to  the Turk and turned the indicator to zero and then to \"East,\" for he  did not wish to rejoin either his enemies the Turks or his equally  undesirable friends the Tatars.    After traveling eastward a few minutes he lost sight of the city  altogether; so, still clinging to the body of the Turk, he again turned  the indicator and began to descend.  When, at last, they landed gently  upon a rocky eminence of the Kuen-Lun "]]]
