SHREDDED POTATOES    Wash, pare and cut potatoes in one-eighth inch slices. Cut slices in  tiny straws. Wash carefully in cold water until water ceases to be  cloudy. Let stand one hour in cold water. Drain and dry on towels. Fry a  golden brown in deep hot Cottolene. Drain on brown paper, sprinkle with  salt and serve around fried perch.      ASPARAGUS TIPS IN CROUSTADES    Prepare the asparagus in the usual way, cut off the tops one inch in  length. Cook in as little boiling salted water as possible. Drain and  dress with a Bechamel Sauce. Serve in Bread Croustades (small round,  square, or diamond-shaped molds cut through thick slices of bread).    BECHAMEL SAUCE              4 tablespoons butter.            4 tablespoons flour.            1-1/2 cups highly seasoned chicken stock.            1/2 cup hot thin cream.

Do not allow sauce to boil after adding yolk of egg.      LETTUCE WITH CREAM DRESSING    Pick over, wash thoroughly young tender lettuce; cut off the roots and  drain. Beat one-half cup heavy cream until solid. Add two tablespoons  vinegar diluted with one tablespoon cold water. Add one tablespoon  finely chopped chives, one-half teaspoon salt and one-eighth teaspoon  pepper. Pour over lettuce, mix well and serve cold.      CHERRY ROLY-POLY    Make a baking powder biscuit dough as for Cream Fruit Rolls. (See Page  180.) Roll to one-half inch thickness. Drain pitted cherries from the  juice; strew them over dough, sprinkle with sugar and dredge lightly  with flour. Roll like a jelly roll, moisten and press the overlapping  edge and close the ends as securely as possible.

CROUTONS    Cut stale bread in one-third inch slices; remove crusts and cut in  one-third inch strips, cut strips in one-third inch cubes. Fry them a  golden brown in deep hot Cottolene. Drain on brown paper and sprinkle  lightly with salt.      ROAST SHOULDER OF LAMB    Order a shoulder and fore-leg of lamb, boned. Wipe, stuff and truss in  shape. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and dredge with flour. Place on rack  in dripping pan, put in hot oven and baste with dripping melted in one  cup hot water, as soon as flour begins to brown; continue basting every  fifteen minutes until meat is done, which will require about two hours;  add one cup of stock to pan while meat is cooking. When richly browned  cover closely and finish cooking.    To carve a boned leg of lamb, cut in thin slices across the grain,  beginning at top of shoulder. When trussed in shape meat looks like a  goose without wings or legs.    STUFFING FOR LAMB    (See recipe Page 154 for stuffing, adding 3/4 teaspoon poultry  seasoning.)    MINT SAUCE              1 bunch of mint finely chopped.            1/3 cup vinegar.            2 tablespoons cold water.            2 tablespoons powdered sugar.    PROCESS: Dilute vinegar with cold water, add sugar and stir until sugar  is dissolved, pour over mint (there should be four tablespoons of mint),  place on back of range and infuse for one-half hour.      NEW POTATOES WITH NEW PEAS    Prepare potatoes as for New Potatoes with Chive Sauce (see recipe Page  78), omitting the Chives. Cook one cup of new peas until tender, in as  little boiling salted water as possible. Drain; add to potatoes. Reheat  potatoes and peas in Cream Sauce.      SWISS CHARD WITH BACON    Wash and pick over Swiss Chard. Cook in boiling salted water, using just  enough water to prevent Chard from burning. Drain and chop fine. Arrange  in a mound on a chop platter, surround (crown fashion) with  \"hard-boiled\" eggs cut in halves lengthwise, having cut side out. Cut a  slice off the large end of each egg so that they will stay in place. Cut  five slices of bacon in narrow strips crosswise. Try out one-third cup.  Add one-fourth cup vinegar, diluted with one-fourth cup hot water, pour  while hot over the Swiss Chard, scattering the scraps of bacon over top  of mound.      CHERRY DUFF              4 cups pitted cherries.            2 cups sugar.            1 teaspoon lemon juice.            1-1/2 tablespoons Cottolene.            2 cups flour.            4 teaspoons baking powder.            1 teaspoon salt.            3/4 cup milk or thin cream.    PROCESS: Mix and sift flour, baking powder and salt; rub Cottolene in  lightly with the tips of fingers; add milk and mix to soft dough. Put  sugar, cherries, drained from juice, and lemon juice in bottom of  well-greased baking dish. Cover with dough, place in steamer, set over  kettle of boiling water, lay a crash towel over steamer, replace cover,  and steam pudding forty-five minutes. Serve with cherry juice, thickened  with arrow root and sweetened.          _July_                _I'm quite ashamed--'tis mighty rude             To eat so much--but all's so good!_                                          --_Pope._    [Illustration]    [Sidenote: _July_    _First Sunday_]          Menu              COLD CONSOMME              VEAL LOAF (HOT)--TOMATO SAUCE              (OR)              COLD--WITH STRING BEAN SALAD              SARATOGA CHIPS      BEETS IN DRAWN BUTTER              FIGS IN SHERRY JELLY WITH WHIPPED CREAM              NUT AND RAISIN CAKE WITH CARAMEL FROSTING              ICED COFFEE           *       *       *       *       *    CHICKEN CONSOMME (COLD)    Place a four-pound fowl in stock pot and a small knuckle of veal; add  four quarts of cold water and heat slowly to boiling point. Skim, reduce  heat and let simmer five hours. Do not allow liquid to boil as it will  destroy its gelatinous properties, and the stock will be turbid. The  last hour of cooking add one-third cup each celery, carrot and turnip  cut in small dice, one-third cup sliced onion, one teaspoon peppercorns,  one tablespoon salt, three sprays thyme, one spray marjoram, two sprays  parsley, one-half bay leaf. Remove fowl and knuckle; strain soup through  double cheese cloth, cool quickly, and remove all fat; clear. Fill  Bouillon cups three-fourths full and chill. This should be a clear,  savory jelly.    TO CLEAR SOUP STOCK    After straining the stock through double cheese cloth, remove all fat  and put the stock into a four-quart stew-pan. Place on range and allow  the white and shell of one egg for each quart of stock. Beat the eggs  slightly and crush shells in small bits, add slowly to stock, stirring  constantly but slowly until the boiling point is reached; let boil two  minutes. Reduce the heat so that stock barely simmers twenty minutes,  skim and strain through double cheese cloth placed over fine soup  strainer. If stock to be cleared is not sufficiently seasoned, add more  seasoning before clearing.      VEAL LOAF    Wipe three pounds of lean veal, discarding all skin and tissue. Pass  meat through the meat-chopper twice, with one-half pound of salt pork;  add six crackers rolled, one-fourth cup cream, juice of one small lemon  (about two tablespoons), one tablespoon salt, one-half tablespoon black  pepper, onion juice to taste. Mix thoroughly and pack solidly in a  granite, brick-shaped bread pan, spread top evenly and brush with  slightly beaten white of egg. Bake in a moderate oven three hours,  basting often with one-fourth cup of pork fat or dripping diluted with  one-fourth cup boiling water. Prick surface with a fork that fat may  penetrate meat. Chill, remove to serving platter, surround by any good  vegetable salad. If served hot, surround with Tomato, Creole or  Espagnole Sauce. This may be prepared Saturday.      STRING BEAN SALAD    Marinate cold, cooked, stringless beans with French Dressing. There  should be enough beans to make a generous border around a cold veal  loaf. Sprinkle beans thickly with small onions thinly sliced and the  rings separated. Garnish edge of dish with sprays of parsley and  Nasturtium blossoms. The finely chopped seed-cells may also be sprinkled  over beans and is quite an addition.      SARATOGA CHIPS    Wash and pare the desired number of uniform-sized potatoes. Slice thinly  (using slaw cutter) into a bowl of cold water. Let stand several hours,  changing the water often or until it is quite clear. Drain and drop them  into a kettle of boiling water; allow them to boil just one minute.  Drain quickly and cover with cold water. Drain from cold water and dry  between towels. Fry a few at a time in deep hot Cottolene, keeping them  moving with the skimmer. Drain on soft brown paper and sprinkle with  salt.

Ginger tea is good for colds.    OLD HOUSEKEEPER: Yes, when the baking-powder gives out you can use  tooth-powder instead.    (FELICITY: \"I never wrote that! I don't care, I don't think it's fair  for other people to be putting things in my department!\")    Our apples are not keeping well this year. They are rotting; and besides  father says we eat an awful lot of them.    PERSEVERANCE: I will give you the recipe for dumplings you ask for.  But remember it is not everyone who can make dumplings, even from the  recipe. There's a knack in it.    If the soap falls into the porridge do not tell your guests about it  until they have finished eating it because it might take away their  appetite.

(FELICITY: \"Dan just copied that word for word out of the Family Guide,  except about the hat part.\")    P-r C-g:--Yes, it would be quite proper to say good evening to the  family ghost if you met it.    F-x K-g:--No, it is not polite to sleep with your mouth open. What's  more, it isn't safe. Something might fall into it.                                              DAN KING.      FASHION NOTES    Crocheted watch pockets are all the rage now. If you haven't a watch  they do to carry your pencil in or a piece of gum.    It is stylish to have hair ribbons to match your dress. But it is hard  to match gray drugget. I like scarlet for that.    It is stylish to pin a piece of ribbon on your coat the same colour as  your chum wears in her hair. Mary Martha Cowan saw them doing it in town  and started us doing it here. I always wear Kitty's ribbon and Kitty  wears mine, but the Story Girl thinks it is silly.                                           CECILY KING.      AN ACCOUNT OF OUR VISIT TO COUSIN MATTIE'S    We all walked over to Cousin Mattie's last week. They were all well  there and we had a fine dinner. On our way back a snow-storm came up and  we got lost in the woods. We didn't know where we were or nothing. If we  hadn't seen a light I guess we'd all have been frozen and snowed over,  and they would never have found us till spring and that would be very  sad. But we saw a light and made for it and it was Peg Bowen's. Some  people think she is a witch and it's hard to tell, but she was real  hospitable and took us all in. Her house was very untidy but it was  warm. She has a skull. I mean a loose skull, not her own. She lets on it  tells her things, but Uncle Alec says it couldn't because it was only an  Indian skull that old Dr. Beecham had and Peg stole it when he died,  but Uncle Roger says he wouldn't trust himself with Peg's skull for  anything. She gave us supper. It was a horrid meal. The Story Girl says  I must not tell what I found in the bread and butter because it would  be too disgusting to read in Our Magazine but it don't matter because  we were all there, except Sara Ray, and know what it was. We stayed all  night and us boys slept in straw. None of us had ever slept on straw  before. We got home in the morning. That is all I can write about our  visit to Cousin Mattie's.                                            FELIX KING.      MY WORST ADVENTURE    It's my turn to write it so I suppose I must. I guess my worst adventure  was two years ago when a whole lot of us were coasting on Uncle Rogers  hill. Charlie Cowan and Fred Marr had started, but half-way down their  sled got stuck and I run down to shove them off again. Then I stood  there just a moment to watch them with my back to the top of the hill.  While I was standing there Rob Marr started Kitty and Em Frewen off on  his sled. His sled had a wooden tongue in it and it slanted back over  the girls' heads. I was right in the way and they yelled to me to get  out, but just as I heard them it struck me. The sled took me between the  legs and I was histed back over the tongue and dropped in a heap behind  before I knew what had happened to me. I thought a tornado had struck  me. The girls couldn't stop though they thought I was killed, but Rob  came tearing down and helped me up. He was awful scared but I wasn't  killed nor my back wasn't broken but my nose bled something awful and  kept on bleeding for three days. Not all the time but by spells.                                              DAN KING.      THE STORY OF HOW CARLISLE GOT ITS NAME    This is a true story to. Long ago there was a girl lived in charlotte  town. I dont know her name so I cant right it and maybe it is just as  well for Felicity might think it wasnt romantik like Miss Jemima Parrs.  She was awful pretty and a young englishman who had come out to make his  fortune fell in love with her and they were engaged to be married the  next spring. His name was Mr. Carlisle. In the winter he started off to  hunt cariboo for a spell. Cariboos lived on the island then. There aint  any here now. He got to where it is Carlisle now. It wasn't anything  then only woods and a few indians. He got awful sick and was sick for  ever so long in a indian camp and only an old micmac squaw to wait on  him. Back in town they all thought he was dead and his girl felt bad for  a little while and then got over it and took up with another beau. The  girls say that wasnt romantik but I think it was sensible but if it had  been me that died I'd have felt bad if she forgot me so soon. But he  hadnt died and when he got back to town he went right to her house  and walked in and there she was standing up to be married to the other  fellow. Poor Mr. Carlisle felt awful. He was sick and week and it went  to his head. He just turned and run and run till he got back to the old  micmac's camp and fell in front of it. But the indians had gone because  it was spring and it didnt matter because he really was dead this time  and people come looking for him from town and found him and buryed him  there and called the place after him. They say the girl was never happy  again and that was hard lines on her but maybe she deserved it.                                           PETER CRAIG.      MISS ALICE READE    Miss Alice Reade is a very pretty girl. She has kind of curly blackish  hair and big gray eyes and a pale face. She is tall and thin but her  figure is pretty fair and she has a nice mouth and a sweet way of  speaking. The girls are crazy about her and talk about her all the time.                                            FELIX KING.      BEAUTIFUL ALICE    That is what we girls call Miss Reade among ourselves. She is divinely  beautiful. Her magnificent wealth of raven hair flows back in glistening  waves from her sun-kissed brow. (DAN: \"If Felix had said she was  sunburned you'd have all jumped on him.\" (CECILY, COLDLY: \"Sun-kissed  doesn't mean sunburned.\" DAN: \"What does it mean then?\" CECILY,  EMBARRASSED: \"I--I don't know. But Miss Montague says the Lady  Geraldine's brow was sun-kissed and of course an earl's daughter  wouldn't be sunburned. \"THE STORY GIRL: \"Oh, don't interrupt the reading  like this. It spoils it.\") Her eyes are gloriously dark and deep, like  midnight lakes mirroring the stars of heaven. Her features are like  sculptured marble and her mouth is a trembling, curving Cupid's bow.  (PETER, ASIDE: \"What kind of a thing is that?\") Her creamy skin is as  fair and flawless as the petals of a white lily. Her voice is like the  ripple of a woodland brook and her slender form is matchless in its  symmetry. (DAN: \"That's Valeria's way of putting it, but Uncle Roger  says she don't show her feed much.\" FELICITY: \"Dan! if Uncle Roger is  vulgar you needn't be!\") Her hands are like a poet's dreams. She dresses  so nicely and looks so stylish in her clothes. Her favourite colour is  blue. Some people think she is stiff and some say she is stuck-up, but  she isn't a bit. It's just that she is different from them and they  don't like it. She is just lovely and we adore her.)                                           CECILY KING.          CHAPTER X. DISAPPEARANCE OF PADDY      As I remember, the spring came late that year in Carlisle. It was May  before the weather began to satisfy the grown-ups. But we children were  more easily pleased, and we thought April a splendid month because the  snow all went early and left gray, firm, frozen ground for our rambles  and games. As the days slipped by they grew more gracious; the hillsides  began to look as if they were thinking of mayflowers; the old orchard  was washed in a bath of tingling sunshine and the sap stirred in the  big trees; by day the sky was veiled with delicate cloud drift, fine and  filmy as woven mist; in the evenings a full, low moon looked over the  valleys, as pallid and holy as some aureoled saint; a sound of laughter  and dream was on the wind and the world grew young with the mirth of  April breezes.    \"It's so nice to be alive in the spring,\" said the Story Girl one  twilight as we swung on the boughs of Uncle Stephen's walk.    \"It's nice to be alive any time,\" said Felicity, complacently.    \"But it's nicer in the spring,\" insisted the Story Girl. \"When I'm dead  I think I'll FEEL dead all the rest of the year, but when spring comes  I'm sure I'll feel like getting up and being alive again.\"    \"You do say such queer things,\" complained Felicity. \"You won't be  really dead any time. You'll be in the next world. And I think it's  horrid to talk about"]]]
