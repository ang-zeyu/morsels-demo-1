A part of the camp of that  regiment, which was situated on the ridge some hundred feet from the  Santiago road, was pitched under a clump of shade trees, and to-day, even  after seven years, the trunks of these trees bear the names and initials  of the men who camped beneath them. {4}  These men will remember that  when they took this hill they found that the fortifications beneath the  trees were partly made from the foundations of an adobe house.  The red  tiles from its roof still litter the ground.  These tiles and the names  cut in the bark of the trees determine absolutely the site of one-half of  the camp, but the other half, where stood Tiffany's quick-firing gun and  Parker's Gatling, has been almost obliterated.  The tree under which  Colonel pitched his tent I could not discover, and the trenches in which  he used to sit with his officers and with the officers from the regiments  of the regular army are now levelled to make a kitchen-garden.  Sometimes  the ex-President is said to have too generously given office and  promotion to the friends he made in Cuba.  These men he met in the  trenches were then not necessarily his friends.  To-day they are not  necessarily his friends.  They are the men the free life of the  rifle-pits enabled him to know and to understand as the settled relations  of home life and peace would never have permitted.  At that time none of  them guessed that the \"amateur colonel,\" to whom they talked freely as to  a comrade, would be their Commander-in-Chief.  They did not suspect that  he would become even the next Governor of New York, certainly not that in  a few years he would be the President of the United States.  So they  showed themselves to him frankly, unconsciously.  They criticised,  argued, disagreed, and he became familiar with the views, character, and  worth of each, and remembered.  The seeds planted in those  half-obliterated trenches have borne greater results than ever will the  kitchen-garden.    The kitchen-garden is immediately on the crest of the hill, and near it a  Cuban farmer has built a shack of mud and twigs and cultivated several  acres of land.  On Kettle Hill there are three more such shacks, and over  all the hills the new tenants have strung stout barbed-wire fences and  made new trails and reared wooden gateways.  It was curious to find how  greatly these modern improvements confused one's recollection of the  landscape, and it was interesting, also, to find how the presence on the  hills of 12,000 men and the excitement of the time magnified distances  and disarranged the landscape.    During the fight I walked along a portion of the Santiago road, and for  many years I always have thought of that walk as extending over immense  distances.  It started from the top of San Juan Hill beside the  block-house, where I had climbed to watch our artillery in action.  By a  mistake, the artillery had been sent there, and it remained exposed on  the crest only about three minutes.  During that brief moment the black  powder it burned drew upon it the fire of every rifle in the Spanish  line.  To load his piece, each of our men was forced to crawl to it on  his stomach, rise on one elbow in order to shove in the shell and lock  the breech, and then, still flat on the ground, wriggle below the crest.  In the three minutes three men were wounded and two killed; and the guns  were withdrawn.  I also withdrew.  I withdrew first.  Indeed, all that  happened after the first three seconds of those three minutes is hearsay,  for I was in the Santiago road at the foot of the hill and retreating  briskly.  This road also was under a cross-fire, which made it stretch in  either direction to an interminable distance.  I remember a government  teamster driving a Studebaker wagon filled with ammunition coming up at a  gallop out of this interminable distance and seeking shelter against the  base of the hill.  Seated beside him was a small boy, freckled and  sunburned, a stowaway from one of the transports.  He was grandly happy  and excited, and his only fear was that he was not \"under fire.\"  From  our coign of safety, with our backs to the hill, the teamster and I  assured him that, on that point, he need feel no morbid doubt.  But until  a bullet embedded itself in the blue board of the wagon he was not  convinced.  Then with his jack-knife he dug it out and shouted with  pleasure.  \"I guess the folks will have to believe I was in a battle  now,\" he said.  That coign of safety ceasing to be a coign of safety  caused us to move on in search of another, and I came upon Sergeant  Borrowe blocking the road with his dynamite gun.  He and his brother and  three regulars were busily correcting a hitch in its mechanism.  An  officer carrying an order along the line halted his sweating horse and  gazed at the strange gun with professional knowledge.    \"That must be the dynamite gun I have heard so much about,\" he shouted.  Borrowe saluted and shouted assent.  The officer, greatly interested,  forgot his errand.    \"I'd like to see you fire it once,\" he said eagerly.  Borrowe, delighted  at the chance to exhibit his toy to a professional soldier, beamed with  equal eagerness.    \"In just a moment, sir,\" he said; \"this shell seems to have jammed a  bit.\"  The officer, for the first time seeing the shell stuck in the  breech, hurriedly gathered up his reins.  He seemed to be losing  interest.  With elaborate carelessness I began to edge off down the road.    \"Wait,\" Borrowe begged; \"we'll have it out in a minute.\"    Suddenly I heard the officer's voice raised wildly.    \"What--what,\" he gasped, \"is that man doing with that axe?\"    \"He's helping me to get out this shell,\" said Borrowe.    \"Good God!\" said the officer.  Then he remembered his errand.    Until last year, when I again met young Borrowe gayly disporting himself  at a lawn-tennis tournament at Mattapoisett, I did not know whether his  brother's method of removing dynamite with an axe had been entirely  successful.  He said it worked all right.    At the turn of the road I found Colonel Leonard Wood and a group of Rough  Riders, who were busily intrenching.  At the same moment Stephen Crane  came up with \"Jimmy\" Hare, the man who has made the Russian-Japanese War  famous.  Crane walked to the crest and stood there as sharply outlined as  a semaphore, observing the enemy's lines, and instantly bringing upon  himself and us the fire of many Mausers.  With every one else, Wood was  crouched below the crest and shouted to Crane to lie down.  Crane, still  standing, as though to get out of ear-shot, moved away, and Wood again  ordered him to lie down.    \"You're drawing the fire on these men,\" Wood commanded.  Although the  heat--it was the 1st of July in the tropics--was terrific, Crane wore a  long India rubber rain-coat and was smoking a pipe.  He appeared as cool  as though he were looking down from a box at a theatre.  I knew that to  Crane, anything that savored of a pose was hateful, so, as I did not want  to see him killed, I called, \"You're not impressing any one by doing  that, Crane.\"  As I hoped he would, he instantly dropped to his knees.  When he crawled over to where we lay, I explained, \"I knew that would  fetch you,\" and he grinned, and said, \"Oh, was that it?\"    A captain of the cavalry came up to Wood and asked permission to withdraw  his troop from the top of the hill to a trench forty feet below the one  they were in.  \"They can't possibly live where they are now,\" he  explained, \"and they're doing no good there, for they can't raise their  heads to fire.  In that lower trench they would be out of range  themselves and would be able to fire back.\"    \"Yes,\" said Wood, \"but all the other men in the first trench would see  them withdraw, and the moral effect would be bad.  They needn't attempt  to return the enemy's fire, but they must not retreat.\"    The officer looked as though he would like to argue.  He was a West Point  graduate and a full-fledged captain in the regular army.  To him, Wood,  in spite of his volunteer rank of colonel, which that day, owing to the  illness of General Young, had placed him in command of a brigade, was  still a doctor.  But discipline was strong in him, and though he looked  many things, he rose from his knees and grimly saluted.  But at that  moment, without waiting for the permission of any one, the men leaped out  of the trench and ran.  It looked as though they were going to run all  the way to the sea, and the sight was sickening.  But they had no  intention of running to the sea.  They ran only to the trench forty feet  farther down and jumped into it, and instantly turning, began pumping  lead at the enemy.  Since five that morning Wood had been running about  on his feet, his clothes stuck to him with sweat and the mud and water of  forded streams, and as he rose he limped slightly.  \"My, but I'm tired!\"  he said, in a tone of the most acute surprise, and as though that fact  was the only one that was weighing on his mind.  He limped over to the  trench in which the men were now busily firing off their rifles and waved  a riding-crop he carried at the trench they had abandoned.  He was  standing as Crane had been standing, in silhouette against the sky-line.  \"Come back, boys,\" we heard him shouting.  \"The other men can't withdraw,  and so you mustn't.  It looks bad.  Come on, get out of that!\"  What made  it more amusing was that, although Wood had, like every one else,  discarded his coat and wore a strange uniform of gray shirt, white  riding-breeches, and a cowboy Stetson, with no insignia of rank, not even  straps pinned to his shirt, still the men instantly accepted his  authority.  They looked at him on the crest of the hill, waving his stick  persuasively at the grave-like trench at his feet, and then with a shout  scampered back to it.

In instances when severe action of the muscles has been  endured, bathing and rubbing the skin of the limbs and joints that  have been used, are of much importance. The laboring agriculturist and  industrious mechanic, by reducing to practice this suggestion, would  thus prevent soreness of the muscles, and stiffness of the joints.    185. _The muscles should be abundantly supplied with pure blood._ This  state of the circulating fluid requires a healthy condition of the  digestive apparatus, and that the skin should be kept warm by proper  clothing, clean by bathing, and be acted upon by pure air and good  light; the movements of the ribs and diaphragm should be unrestricted,  and the lungs should have ample volume and be supplied with pure air.  In all instances, muscular power is greatest when the preceding  conditions exist, as the muscles are then stimulated by pure blood;  consequently, it is of practical importance to the mechanic, the  farmer, the man of leisure, and not less so to the ladies, to observe  these conditions, whatever vocation of life they pursue.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    183. How should the muscles be rested when they have been vigorously  used? 184. What precaution is given when the skin is covered with  perspiration? How may soreness of the muscles, consequent upon severe  action, be prevented? 185. Should the muscles be supplied with pure  blood? When is muscular power the greatest?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    186. _The muscles should be used in pure air._ The purer the air we  breathe, the more stimulating the blood supplied to the muscles, and  the longer they can be used in labor, walking, or sitting, without  fatigue and injury; hence the benefit derived in thoroughly  ventilating all inhabited rooms. For the same reason, if the air of  the sick-room is pure, the patient will sit up longer than when the  air is impure.    _Observation._ It is a common remark that sick persons will sit up  longer when riding in a carriage, than in an easy chair in the room  where they have lain sick. In the one instance, they breathe pure air;  in the other, usually, a confined, impure air.    187. _The muscles should be exercised in the light._ Light,  particularly that of the sun, exercises more or less influence on man  and the inferior animals as well as on plants. Both require the  stimulus of this agent. Shops occupied by mechanics, kitchens, and  sitting-rooms, should be well lighted, and situated on the sunny side  of the house. Cellar kitchens and underground shops should be avoided.  For similar reasons, students should take their exercise during the  day, rather than in the evening, and, as much as possible, laborers  should avoid night toil.    _Illustrations._ Plants that grow in the shade, as under trees, or in  a dark cellar, are of lighter color and feebler than those that are  exposed to the light of the sun. Persons that dwell in dark rooms are  paler and less vigorous than those who inhabit apartments well  lighted, and exposed to the rays of the sun.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    186. Why should the muscles be used in pure air? Give a common  observation. 187. What effect has light on the muscular system? What  should the laborer avoid? Why should not students take their daily  exercise in the evening? How is the influence of solar light  illustrated?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    188. _Exercise should be regular and frequent._ The system needs this  means of invigoration as regularly as it does new supplies of food. It  is no more correct that we devote several days to a _proper_ action of  the muscles, and then spend one day inactively, than it is to take a  _proper_ amount of food for several days, and then withdraw this  supply for a day. The industrious mechanic and the studious minister  suffer as surely from undue confinement as the improvident and  indolent. The evil consequences of neglect of exercise are gradual,  and steal slowly upon an individual. But sooner or later they are  manifested in muscular weakness, dyspepsia, and nervous irritability.    _Observation._ The custom among farmers of enduring severe and undue  toil for several successive days, and then spending one or two days in  idleness to _rest_, is injudicious. It would be far better to do less  in a day, and continue the labor through the period devoted to  idleness, and then no rest will be demanded.    189. _Every part of the muscular system should have its appropriate  share of exercise._ Some employments call into exercise the muscles of  the upper limbs, as shoe-making; others, the muscles of the lower  limbs; while some, the muscles of both upper and lower limbs, with  those of the trunk, as farming. In some kinds of exercise, the lower  limbs are mainly used, as in walking; in others, the upper limbs; and  again, the muscles of the trunk, together with those of the upper and  lower limbs, as in archery, quoits, playing ball. Those trades and  kinds of exercise are most salutary, in which all the muscles have  their due proportion of action, as this tends to develop and  strengthen them equally. Thus labor upon the farm and domestic  employment are superior as vocations, and archery, quoits, and  dancing, if the air is pure, among the pastimes. For sedentary  persons, that kind of exercise is best which calls into action the  greatest number of muscles.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    188. How should exercise be taken? What is said respecting irregular  exercise? Are the consequences of neglected exercise immediately  apparent? What practical observation is given? 189. Should every  muscle have its due amount of exercise? Mention some employments that  only call into action the muscles of the upper limbs. Those of the  lower limbs, those of the trunk and limbs. Mention, in the different  pastimes, what muscles are called into action.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    190. _The proper time for labor or exercise should be observed._ This  is modified by many circumstances. As a general rule, the morning,  when the air is pure and the ground dry, is better than the evening;  for then, the powers of the body are greatest. Severe exercise and  labor should be avoided immediately before or after eating a full  meal, for the energies of the system are then required to perform the  digestive function. For similar reasons, it is not an appropriate time  for energetic muscular action immediately before or after severe  mental toil, as the powers of the system are then concentrated upon  the brain.[6]       [6] It appears to be a fact, that no two important organs can be         called into intense action at the same time, without injury to         both, as well as to the general system. This arises from the         circumstance that an organ, when in functional action, attracts         fluids (sanguineous and nervous) from other organs of the         system. Except in a few instances of high health in youth, the         power of the system is not adequate to supply more than one         organ in action with the appropriate fluids at the same time.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    What kinds of exercise are best? 190. What rule is given respecting  the time for exercise? 191. Why do the muscles require sleep? What is  the effect of an inversion of the law of rest?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    191. _The muscles require sleep to restore their expended energies._  Among the arrangements of creative wisdom, no one harmonizes with the  wants of the system more than the alternation of day and night. The  natural inclination of man to sleep, is in the stilly hour of night,  when all nature reposes, and to be in action during the light of day.  An inversion of this law of rest causes greater exhaustion of the  system than the same amount of exertion during daylight. This is  illustrated by the wearied and exhausted condition of watchers,  night-police, and other individuals who spend a part of the night in  some active business of life.    192. _The muscles should not be compressed._ Compression prevents the  blood from passing to the muscles with freedom; consequently, they are  not supplied with material to renovate and promote their growth.  Again, pressure stimulates the lymphatics to action; and by the  increased activity of these vessels the muscles are attenuated. In the  case of a man with a fractured limb, the muscles are not only  enfeebled by inaction, but diminished in size by compression from the  dressing. Limbs enfeebled in this way will not recover their size,  tone, and strength, until the bandages are removed, and a proper  amount of exercise taken.    193. The pressure of tight dresses, under the name of a \"snug fit,\"  enfeebles the muscles of the back, and is a common cause of projecting  shoulders and curvature of the spinal column. Thus every appendage to  the dress of ladies which prevents free motion of the muscles of the  chest and spinal column, weakens the muscles thus restrained, and not  only prevents the proper expansion of the lungs, but, by weakening the  muscles which sustain the spine, induces curvature and disease.  Whalebone, wood, steel, and every other unyielding substance, should  be banished from the toilet, as enemies of the human race.    194. _The mind exerts a great influence upon the tone and contractile  energy of the muscular system._ A person acting under a healthy mental  stimulus will make exertion with less fatigue than he would without  this incentive. For this reason, a sportsman will pursue his game  miles without fatigue, while his attendant, not having any mental  stimulus, will become weary. Again, if the sportsman spends some hours  in pursuit of his favorite game without success, a feeling of languor"]]]
