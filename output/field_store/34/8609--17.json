[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37206"],[0,"Sea and Sardinia (#15)"],[1,"the q-b, I must  live in Cagliari--For in Sicily the eggs cost 1.50 each.    This is the meat and poultry and bread market. There are stalls of new,  various-shaped bread, brown and bright: there are tiny stalls of  marvellous native cakes, which I want to taste, there is a great deal of  meat and kid: and there are stalls of cheese, all cheeses, all shapes,  all whitenesses, all the cream-colours, on into daffodil yellow. Goat  cheese, sheeps cheese, Swiss cheese, Parmegiano, stracchino,  caciocavallo, torolone, how many cheeses I don't know the names of! But  they cost about the same as in Sicily, eighteen francs, twenty francs,  twenty-five francs the kilo. And there is lovely ham--thirty and  thirty-five francs the kilo. There is a little fresh butter too--thirty  or thirty-two francs the kilo. Most of the butter, however, is tinned in  Milan. It costs the same as the fresh. There are splendid piles of  salted black olives, and huge bowls of green salted olives. There are  chickens and ducks and wild-fowl: at eleven and twelve and fourteen  francs a kilo. There is mortadella, the enormous Bologna sausage, thick  as a church pillar: 16 francs: and there are various sorts of smaller  sausage, salami, to be eaten in slices. A wonderful abundance of food,  glowing and shining. We are rather late for fish, especially on Friday.  But a barefooted man offers us two weird objects from the Mediterranean,  which teems with marine monsters.    The peasant women sit behind their wares, their home-woven linen skirts,  hugely full, and of various colours, ballooning round them. The yellow  baskets give off a glow of light. There is a sense of profusion once  more. But alas no sense of cheapness: save the eggs. Every month, up  goes the price of everything.    \"I must come and live in Cagliari, to do my shopping here,\" says the  q-b. \"I must have one of those big grass baskets.\"    We went down to the little street--but saw more baskets emerging from a  broad flight of stone stairs, enclosed. So up we went-and found  ourselves in the vegetable market. Here the q-b was happier still.  Peasant women, sometimes barefoot, sat in their tight little bodices and  voluminous, coloured skirts behind the piles of vegetables, and never  have I seen a lovelier show. The intense deep green of spinach seemed to  predominate, and out of that came the monuments of curd-white and  black-purple cauliflowers: but marvellous cauliflowers, like a  flower-show, the purple ones intense as great bunches of violets. From  this green, white, and purple massing struck out the vivid rose-scarlet  and blue crimson of radishes, large radishes like little turnips, in  piles. Then the long, slim, grey-purple buds of artichokes, and dangling  clusters of dates, and piles of sugar-dusty white figs and  sombre-looking black figs, and bright burnt figs: basketfuls and  basketfuls of figs. A few baskets of almonds, and many huge walnuts.  Basket-pans of native raisins. Scarlet peppers like trumpets:  magnificent fennels, so white and big and succulent: baskets of new  potatoes: scaly kohlrabi: wild asparagus in bunches, yellow-budding  sparacelli: big, clean-fleshed carrots: feathery salads with white  hearts: long, brown-purple onions and then, of course pyramids of big  oranges, pyramids of pale apples, and baskets of brilliant shiny  mandarini, the little tangerine orange with their green-black leaves.  The green and vivid-coloured world of fruit-gleams I have never seen in  such splendour as under the market roof at Cagliari: so raw and  gorgeous. And all quite cheap, the one remaining cheapness, except  potatoes. Potatoes of any sort are 1.40 or 1.50 the kilo.    \"Oh!\" cried the q-b, \"If I don't live at Cagliari and come and do my  shopping here, I shall die with one of my wishes unfulfilled.\"           *       *       *       *       *    But out of the sun it was cold, nevertheless. We went into the streets  to try and get warm. The sun was powerful. But alas, as in southern  towns generally, the streets are sunless as wells.    So the q-b and I creep slowly along the sunny bits, and then perforce  are swallowed by shadow. We look at the shops. But there is not much to  see. Little, frowsy provincial shops, on the whole.    But a fair number of peasants in the streets, and peasant women in  rather ordinary costume: tight-bodiced, volume-skirted dresses of  hand-woven linen or thickish cotton. The prettiest is of  dark-blue-and-red, stripes-and-lines, intermingled, so made that the  dark-blue gathers round the waist into one colour, the myriad pleats  hiding all the rosy red. But when she walks, the full-petticoated  peasant woman, then the red goes flash-flash-flash, like a bird showing  its colours. Pretty that looks in the sombre street. She has a plain,  light bodice with a peak: sometimes a little vest, and great full white  sleeves, and usually a handkerchief or shawl loose knotted. It is  charming the way they walk, with quick, short steps. When all is said  and done, the most attractive costume for women in my eye, is the tight  little bodice and the many-pleated skirt, full and vibrating with  movement. It has a charm which modern elegance lacks completely--a  bird-like play in movement.           *       *       *       *       *    They are amusing, these peasant girls and women: so brisk and defiant.  They have straight backs, like little walls, and decided, well-drawn  brows. And they are amusingly on the alert. There is no eastern  creeping. Like sharp, brisk birds they dart along the streets, and you  feel they would fetch you a bang over the head as leave as look at you.  Tenderness, thank heaven, does not seem to be a Sardinian quality. Italy  is so tender--like cooked macaroni--yards and yards of soft tenderness  ravelled round everything. Here men don't idealise women, by the looks  of things. Here they don't make these great leering eyes, the inevitable  yours-to-command look of Italian males. When the men from the country  look at these women, then it is Mind-yourself, my lady. I should think  the grovelling Madonna-worship is not much of a Sardinian feature. These  women have to look out for themselves, keep their own back-bone stiff  and their knuckles hard. Man is going to be male Lord if he can. And  woman isn't going to give him too much of his own way, either. So there  you have it, the fine old martial split between the sexes. It is tonic  and splendid, really, after so much sticky intermingling and  backboneless Madonna-worship. The Sardinian isn't looking for the \"noble  woman nobly planned.\" No, thank you. He wants that young madam over  there, a young stiff-necked generation that she is. Far better sport  than with the nobly-planned sort: hollow frauds that they are. Better  sport too than with a Carmen, who gives herself away too much, In these  women there is something shy and defiant and un-get-atable. The defiant,  splendid split between the sexes, each absolutely determined to defend  his side, her side, from assault. So the meeting has a certain wild,  salty savour, each the deadly unknown to the other. And at the same  time, each his own, her own native pride and courage, taking the  dangerous leap and scrambling back.    Give me the old, salty way of love. How I am nauseated with sentiment  and nobility, the macaroni slithery-slobbery mess of modern adorations.           *       *       *       *       *    One sees a few fascinating faces in Cagliari: those great dark unlighted  eyes. There are fascinating dark eyes in Sicily, bright, big, with an  impudent point of light, and a curious roll, and long lashes: the eyes  of old Greece, surely. But here one sees eyes of soft, blank darkness,  all velvet, with no imp looking out of them. And they strike a stranger,  older note: before the soul became self-conscious: before the mentality  of Greece appeared in the world. Remote, always remote, as if the  intelligence lay deep within the cave, and never came forward. One  searches into the gloom for one second, while the glance lasts. But  without being able to penetrate to the reality. It recedes, like some  unknown creature deeper into its lair. There is a creature, dark and  potent. But what?    Sometimes Velasquez, and sometimes Goya gives us a suggestion of these  large, dark, unlighted eyes. And they go with fine, fleecy black  hair--almost as fine as fur. I have not seen them north of Cagliari.           *       *       *       *       *    The q-b spies some of the blue-and-red stripe-and-line cotton stuff of  which the peasants make their dress: a large roll in the doorway of a  dark shop. In we go, and begin to feel it. It is just soft, thickish  cotton stuff--twelve francs a metre. Like most peasant patterns, it is  much more complicated and subtle than appears: the curious placing of  the stripes, the subtle proportion, and a white thread left down one  side only of each broad blue block. The stripes, moreover, run _across_  the cloth, not lengthwise with it. But the width would be just long  enough for a skirt--though the peasant skirts have almost all a band at  the bottom with the stripes running round-ways.    The man--he is the esquimo type, simple, frank and aimiable--says the  stuff is made in France, and this the first roll since the war. It is  the old, old pattern, quite correct--but the material not _quite_ so  good. The q-b takes enough for a dress.    He shows us also cashmeres, orange, scarlet, sky-blue, royal blue: good,  pure-wool cashmeres that were being sent to India, and were captured  from a German mercantile sub-marine. So he says. Fifty francs a  metre--very, very wide. But they are too much trouble to carry in a  knapsack, though their brilliance fascinates.           *       *       *       *       *    So we stroll and look at the shops, at the filigree gold jewelling of  the peasants, at a good bookshop. But there is little to see and  therefore the question is, shall we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3721"],[0,"France and England in North America, Part I: Pioneers of France in the New World (#15)"],[1,"protest for form's sake, or to quiet public clamor;  but Philip of Spain well knew that it would end in patient submission.    Menendez was summoned back in haste to the Spanish court. His force must  be strengthened. Three hundred and ninety-four men were added at the  royal charge, and a corresponding number of transport and supply ships.  It was a holy war, a crusade, and as such was preached by priest and  monk along the western coasts of Spain. All the Biscayan ports flamed  with zeal, and adventurers crowded to enroll themselves; since to  plunder heretics is good for the soul as well as the purse, and broil  and massacre have double attraction when promoted into a means of  salvation. It was a fervor, deep and hot, but not of celestial kindling;  nor yet that buoyant and inspiring zeal which, when the Middle Age was  in its youth and prime, glowed in the souls of Tancred, Godfrey, and St.  Louis, and which, when its day was long since past, could still find  its home in the great heart of Columbus. A darker spirit urged the new  crusade,--born not of hope, but of fear, slavish in its nature, the  creature and the tool of despotism; for the typical Spaniard of the  sixteenth century was not in strictness a fanatic, he was bigotry  incarnate.    Heresy was a plague-spot, an ulcer to be eradicated with fire and the  knife, and this foul abomination was infecting the shores which the  Vicegerent of Christ had given to the King of Spain, and which the Most  Catholic King had given to the Adelantado. Thus would countless heathen  tribes be doomed to an eternity of flame, and the Prince of Darkness  hold his ancient sway unbroken; and for the Adelantado himself, the vast  outlays, the vast debts of his bold Floridan venture would be all in  vain, and his fortunes be wrecked past redemption through these tools  of Satan. As a Catholic, as a Spaniard, and as an adventurer, his course  was clear.    The work assigned him was prodigious. He was invested with power almost  absolute, not merely over the peninsula which now retains the name of  Florida, but over all North America, from Labrador to Mexico; for  this was the Florida of the old Spanish geographers, and the Florida  designated in the commission of Menendez. It was a continent which he  was to conquer and occupy out of his own purse. The impoverished King  contracted with his daring and ambitious subject to win and hold for  him the territory of the future United States and British Provinces.  His plan, as afterwards exposed at length in his letters to Philip  the Second, was, first, to plant a garrison at Port Royal, and next  to fortify strongly on Chesapeake Bay, called by him St. Mary's.  He believed that adjoining this bay was an arm of the sea, running  northward and eastward, and communicating with the Gulf of St. Lawrence,  thus making New England, with adjacent districts, an island. His  proposed fort on the Chesapeake, securing access by this imaginary  passage, to the seas of Newfoundland, would enable the Spaniards to  command the fisheries, on which both the French and the English had long  encroached, to the great prejudice of Spanish rights. Doubtless, too,  these inland waters gave access to the South Sea, and their occupation  was necessary to prevent the French from penetrating thither; for that  ambitious people, since the time of Cartier, had never abandoned their  schemes of seizing this portion of the dominions of the King of Spain.  Five hundred soldiers and one hundred sailors must, he urges, take  possession, without delay, of Port Royal and the Chesapeake. [20]    Preparation for his enterprise was pushed with furious energy. His whole  force, when the several squadrons were united, amounted to two thousand  six hundred and forty-six persons, in thirty-four vessels, one of  which, the San Pelayo, bearing Menendez himself, was of nine hundred  and ninety-six tons burden, and is described as one of the finest ships  afloat. [21] There were twelve Franciscans and eight Jesuits, besides  other ecclesiastics; and many knights of Galicia, Biscay, and the  Asturias took part in the expedition. With a slight exception, the  whole was at the Adelantado's charge. Within the first fourteen months,  according to his admirer, Barcia, the adventure cost him a million  ducats. [22]    Before the close of the year, Sancho do Arciniega was commissioned to  join Menendez with an additional force of fifteen hundred men.    Red-hot with a determined purpose, the Adelantado would brook no delay.  To him, says the chronicler, every day seemed a year. He was eager to  anticipate Ribaut, of whose designs and whose force he seems to have  been informed to the minutest particular, but whom he hoped to thwart  and ruin by gaining Fort Caroline before him. With eleven ships,  therefore, he sailed from Cadiz, on the twenty-ninth of June, 1565,  leaving the smaller vessels of his fleet to follow with what speed they  might. He touched first at the Canaries, and on the eighth of July left  them, steering for Dominica. A minute account of the voyage has come  down to us, written by Mendoza, chaplain of the expedition,--a somewhat  dull and illiterate person, who busily jots down the incidents of  each passing day, and is constantly betraying, with a certain awkward  simplicity, how the cares of this world and of the next jostle each  other in his thoughts.    On Friday, the twentieth of July, a storm fell upon them with appalling  fury. The pilots lost their wits, and the sailors gave themselves up to  their terrors. Throughout the night, they beset Mendoza for confession  and absolution, a boon not easily granted, for the seas swept the  crowded decks with cataracts of foam, and the shriekings of the gale  in the rigging overpowered the exhortations of the half-drowned priest.  Cannon, cables, spars, water-casks, were thrown overboard, and the  chests of the sailors would have followed, had not the latter, in spite  of their fright, raised such a howl of remonstrance that the order was  revoked. At length day dawned, Plunging, reeling, half under water,  quivering with the shock of the seas, whose mountain ridges rolled down  upon her before the gale, the ship lay in deadly peril from Friday till  Monday noon. Then the storm abated; the sun broke out; and again she  held her course.    They reached Dominica on Sunday, the fifth of August. The chaplain  tells us how he went on shore to refresh himself; how, while his Italian  servant washed his linen at a brook, he strolled along the beach and  picked up shells; and how he was scared, first, by a prodigious turtle,  and next by a vision of the cannibal natives, which caused his prompt  retreat to the boats.    On the tenth, they anchored in the harbor of Porto Rico, where they  found two ships of their squadron, from which they had parted in the  storm. One of them was the \"San Pelayo,\" with Menendez on board. Mendoza  informs us, that in the evening the officers came on board the ship  to which he was attached, when he, the chaplain, regaled them with  sweetmeats, and that Menendez invited him not only to supper that night,  but to dinner the next day, \"for the which I thanked him, as reason  was,\" says the gratified churchman.    Here thirty men deserted, and three priests also ran off, of which  Mendoza bitterly complains, as increasing his own work. The motives of  the clerical truants may perhaps be inferred from a worldly temptation  to which the chaplain himself was subjected. \"I was offered the service  of a chapel where I should have got a peso for every mass I said, the  whole year round; but I did not accept it, for fear that what I hear  said of the other three would be said of me. Besides, it is not a  place where one can hope for any great advancement, and I wished to try  whether, in refusing a benefice for the love of the Lord, He will not  repay me with some other stroke of fortune before the end of the voyage;  for it is my aim to serve God and His blessed Mother.\"    The original design had been to rendezvous at Havana, but with  the Adelantado the advantages of despatch outweighed every other  consideration. He resolved to push directly for Florida. Five of his  scattered ships had by this time rejoined company, comprising, exclusive  of officers, a force of about five hundred soldiers, two hundred  sailors, and one hundred colonists. Bearing northward, he advanced by  an unknown and dangerous course along the coast of Hayti and through the  intricate passes of the Bahamas. On the night of the twenty-sixth, the  \"San Pelayo\" struck three times on the shoals; \"but,\" says the chaplain,  \"inasmuch as our enterprise was undertaken for the sake of Christ and  His blessed Mother, two heavy seas struck her abaft, and set her afloat  again.\"    At length the ships lay becalmed in the Bahama Channel, slumbering on  the glassy sea, torpid with the heats of a West Indian August. Menendez  called a council of the commanders. There was doubt and indecision.  Perhaps Ribaut had already reached the French fort, and then to attack  the united force would be an act of desperation. Far better to await  their lagging comrades. But the Adelantado was of another mind; and,  even had his enemy arrived, ho was resolved that he should have no time  to fortify himself.    \"It is God's will,\" he said, \"that our victory should be due, not to our  numbers, but to His all-powerful aid. Therefore has He stricken us with  tempests, and scattered our ships.\" And he gave his voice for instant  advance.    There was much dispute; even the chaplain remonstrated; but nothing  could bend the iron will of Menendez. Nor was a sign of celestial  approval wanting. At nine in the evening, a great meteor burst forth in  mid-heaven, and, blazing like the sun, rolled westward towards the coast  of Florida. The fainting spirits of the crusaders were revived. Diligent  preparation was begun. Prayers and masses were said; and,"]]]
