[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31987"],[0,"Territory in Bird Life (#15)"],[1,"birds, and which we grant is purposeless, would  be more than balanced by the added security.\" This is a possible  explanation and requires consideration. It cannot account for all the  diverse ways in which the sexes are mixed up in the fighting--it cannot,  for instance, explain the fact that an unpaired male will attack either  sex of an adjoining pair indiscriminately--but nevertheless it appears  at first sight to be a reasonable explanation of some of them. We must  remember, however, that fighting continues throughout the whole period  of reproduction. Even after the discharge of the sexual function has  ceased, and the female is engaged in incubation or in tending her young,  the male is still intolerant of intruders; and it is difficult to  believe that, at so late a stage in the process, a female could be any  attraction sexually to an unpaired male. But apart from any theoretical  objection, there remains the fact--namely that there is no evidence  that a male, after having once paired, is liable to be robbed of its  mate. And in support of this fact I have only to state that I have met  with no single instance of failure to obtain and hold a mate when once a  territory had been secured. Bearing in mind then that both sexes  participate in the fighting, and that individuals of the opposite sex  frequently attack one another; that all such conflicts are characterised  by persistent effort, and that they are not limited to just the  particular period when the sexual instinct is dominant but continue  throughout the breeding season; bearing in mind that in at least one  form of this promiscuous warfare the influence of the female can be  definitely excluded, and that, in the remaining forms, the evidence  which is required to link them up with the biological end of securing  mates is lacking--can it be denied that the complexity of the strife  makes against the view that the possession of a female is the proximate  end for which the males are fighting?    We started with the most simple aspect of the whole problem, the  fighting of two males in the presence of one female--the aspect upon  which attention has usually been fixed. And if it remained at that, if  observation failed to disclose any further development in the situation,  then there would be no need to probe the matter deeper, there would be  no reason to doubt the assertion that the quarrel had direct reference  to the female. But assuredly no one can ponder over the diversity of  battle and still believe that the possession of a mate furnishes an  adequate solution of the mystery. Clearly such an hypothesis cannot  cover all the known facts; there are conflicts between separate pairs,  and there are conflicts between males when females are known to be  absent and when their mates are even engaged in the work of  incubation--these cannot be due to an impulse in a member of one sex to  gain or keep possession of one of the other sex. So that taking all  these facts into consideration, we are justified, I think, in hesitating  to accept this view, and must look elsewhere for the real condition  under which the pugnacious nature of the male is rendered susceptible to  appropriate stimulation.      What then is the meaning of all this warfare? The process of  reproduction is a complex one, built up of a number of different parts  forming one inter-related whole; it is not merely a question of  \"battle,\" or of \"territory,\" or of \"song,\" or of \"emotional  manifestation,\" but of all these together. The fighting is thus one link  in a chain of events whose end is the attainment of reproduction; it is  a relationship in an inter-related process, and to speak of it as being  even directly related to the territory is scarcely sufficient, for it is  intimately associated with the disposition which is manifested in the  isolation of the male from its companions, and forms therewith an  _imperium in imperio_ from which our concept of breeding territory is  taken. But let me say at once that it is no easy matter to prove this,  for since so many modes of behaviour, which can be interpreted as  lending support to this view, are likewise interpretable on the view  that the presence of a female is a necessary condition of the fighting,  it is difficult to find just the sort of evidence that is required.  Nevertheless, after hearing the whole of the evidence and at the same  time keeping in mind the conclusion which we have already reached, I  venture to think that the close relationship between the warfare on the  one hand and the territory on the other will be fully admitted.    Formerly I deemed the spring rivalry to be the result of accidental  encounters, and I believed that an issue to a struggle was only reached  when one of the combatants succumbed or disappeared from the locality, a  view which neither recognised method nor admitted control. Recent  experience has shown, however, that I was wrong, and that there is a  very definite control over and above that which is supplied by the  physical capabilities of the birds.    Let us take some common species, the Willow-Warbler being our first  example; and, having found three adjoining territories occupied by  unpaired males, let us study the conflicts at each stage in the sexual  life of the three individuals, observing them before females have  arrived upon the scene, again when one or two of the three males have  secured mates, and yet again when all three have paired. Now we shall  find that the conditions which lead up to and which terminate the  conflicts are remarkably alike at each of these periods. A male  intrudes, and the intrusion evokes an immediate display of irritation on  the part of the owner of the territory, who, rapidly uttering its song  and jerking its wings, begins hostilities. Flying towards the intruder,  it attacks viciously, and there follows much fluttering of wings and  snapping or clicking of bills. At one moment the birds are in the  tree-tops, at another in the air, and sometimes even on the ground, and  fighting thus they gradually approach and pass beyond the limits of the  territory. Whereupon a change comes over the scene; the male whose  territory was intruded upon and who all along had displayed such  animosity, betrays no further interest in the conflict--it ceases to  attack, searches around for food, or sings, and slowly makes its way  back towards the centre of the territory.    Scenes of this kind are of almost daily occurrence wherever a species is  so common, or the environment to which it is adapted so limited in  extent, that males are obliged to occupy adjacent ground. The Moor-Hen  abounds on all suitable sheets of water, and it is a bird that can be  conveniently studied because, as a rule, there is nothing, except the  rushes that fringe the pool, to hinder us from obtaining a panoramic  view of the whole proceedings, and moreover the area occupied by each  individual is comparatively small. Towards the middle of February,  symptoms of sexual organic change make themselves apparent, and the pool  is then no longer the resort of a peaceable community; quarrels become  frequent, and as different portions of the surface of the water are  gradually appropriated, so the fighting becomes more incessant and more  severe. Each individual has its own particular territory, embracing a  piece of open water as well as a part of the rush-covered fringe, within  which it moves and lives. But in the early part of the season, when the  territories are still in process of being established, and definiteness  has still to be acquired, trespassing is of frequent occurrence, and the  conflicts are often conspicuous for their severity.    Now these conflicts are not confined to unpaired individuals, nor to one  sex, nor to one member of a pair--every individual that has settled upon  the pool for the purpose of breeding will at one time or another be  involved in a struggle with its neighbour. If then we single out certain  pairs and day by day observe their actions and their attitude towards  intruders, we shall notice that, instead of their routine of existence  consisting, as a casual acquaintance with the pool and its inmates might  lead us to believe, of an endless series of meaningless disputes, the  behaviour of each individual is directed towards a similar goal--the  increasing of the security of its possession; and further, if we pay  particular attention to the circumstances which lead up to the quarrels  and the circumstances under which such quarrels come to an end, we shall  find, when we have accumulated a sufficient body of observations, that  the disputes always originate in trespass, and that hostilities always  cease when the trespasser returns again to its own territory. By careful  observation it is possible to make oneself acquainted with the  boundaries--I know not what other term to use--which separate this  territory from that; and it is the conduct of the birds on or near these  boundaries to which attention must be drawn. A bird may be feeding  quietly in one corner of its territory when an intruder enters. Becoming  aware of what is happening it ceases to search for food, and approaching  the intruder, at first swimming slowly but gradually increasing its  pace, it finally rises and attacks with wings and beak, and drives its  rival back again beyond the boundary. Thereupon its attitude undergoes a  remarkable change; ceasing to attack, but remaining standing for a few  moments as if still keeping guard, it betrays no further interest in the  bird with which a few seconds previously it was fighting furiously. On  one occasion I watched a trespasser settle upon a conspicuous clump of  rushes situated near the boundary. The owner, who was at the moment some  distance away, approached in the usual manner, and, having driven off  the trespasser, returned immediately to the clump, where it remained  erect and motionless.    A feature which marks"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32023"],[0,"The Boy's Voice (#15)"],[1," still retain two men  altos in our choir, which now consists of the following:--Fourteen  trebles, four boy altos, two men altos, four tenors, and four basses. I  find boy altos very effective in _modern_ church music, such as  Mendelssohn's anthems, &c., where the alto part is written much higher  than is the case in the old cathedral music.    \"Yours very truly,    \"JAMES TAYLOR.\"    Dr. Garrett, organist of St. John's College, Cambridge, writes:--    \"5, Park Side, Cambridge, _Dec._ 12, 1890.    \"Dear Mr. Curwen,--I have had boy altos only in my choir for some years.  I introduced them of necessity in the first instance. The stipend of a  lay clerk was too small to attract any other than a local candidate, and  no suitable man was to be found. If I could have really first-class  adult altos in my choir I should not think of using boys' voices. At the  same time there are some advantages on the side of boys' voices.    \"I. Unless the adult alto voice is really pure and good, and its  possessor a skilled singer, it is too often unbearable.    \"II. Under the most favourable conditions it is very rare, according to  my experience, to find an alto voice retaining its best qualities after  middle age.    \"III. The alto voice is undoubtedly becoming rare.    \"On the other side you have to consider:--    \"I. The limitation of choice in music, as there is a good deal of  'cathedral music' in which the alto part is beyond the range of any  boy's voice.    \"II. A certain lack of _brightness_ in the upper part of such trios as  those in 'By the waters of Babylon' (Boyce) 'The wilderness' (Goss), and  many like movements.    \"As regards the break question, the advantage, in my experience, is  wholly on the boys' side. A well-trained boy will sing such a solo as 'O  thou that tellest,' or such a passage as the following without letting  his break be felt at all:    [Illustration: For Thou hast been my hope, hast been my hope.]    This passage,[B] which is from the anthem, 'Hear my crying,' by Weldon,  I have heard sung by an adult alto, who broke badly between E flat and  F. The effect was funny beyond description. In fact, if a boys' break is  about C or D (3rd space or 4th line), and he [Illustration: musical  notation] is never allowed to practise above that, there will be no  question of break arising. My alto boys can get a good round G, and five  out of the six can go up without break to C. [Illustration: musical  notation] The advantage of this in chanting the Psalms is obvious. What  can an adult alto be expected to do in a case where the reciting note is  close to his break? These are considerations which may fairly be taken  into account even when the decision is to be made between _possible_  courses; when there _is_ a choice. In many cases there is none. It must  be (as you say) boy alto, or no alto. I am quite sure that careful  training is all that is needed to make boy altos most efficient members  of a choir. Or rather, I ought to say that careful selection and  training are both needed. To take a young boy as an alto because he  happens to have three or four raucous notes from, say, B flat to E flat  [Illustration: musical notation] while he has a bad break between E flat  [Illustration: musical notation] and F is, of course, to court failure.  I prefer taking a boy whose break lies higher, and training his voice  downwards. If, as a probationer, he can get a fairly good round B  natural [Illustration: musical notation] or B flat; lower notes can  certainly be produced as he grows older.]    \"Yours very truly,    \"GEORGE GARRETT.\"    [B] I have transposed the passage from the alto clef.--J. S. C.           *       *       *       *       *    A remark may be interposed here that from a physiological point of view  we must expect voices of different pitch in boys, just as in girls,  women, and men. Boys differ in height, size, and in the pitch of the  speaking voice, which is a sure guide to the pitch of the singing voice.  There is thus no physiological ground for supposing all boys to be  trebles.           *       *       *       *       *    The following letter is from the Rev. W. E. Dickson, Precentor of Ely:--    \"The College, Ely, _October 30th_, 1890.    \"_Dear Sir_,--I have much pleasure in replying to your note. If I  resolved to do so in a few words I should be obliged to say that seldom  indeed do I hear boy altos sing with sweet voices and true intonation,  either in my own country, or in those foreign countries in which I am in  the habit of taking my holidays.    \"But I should like to be allowed to explain that, in my opinion, the  coarseness (at any rate) of boy-altos in English choirs is due to  mismanagement by the choirmaster. His usual plan is to turn over to the  alto part boys who are losing their upper notes by the natural failure  of their soprano voices. This saves trouble, for such boys probably  read music well enough, and they are simply told to 'sing alto,' and are  left to do so without further training, until they can croak out no more  ugly noises. Surely this is quite a mistake. Am I not right in  maintaining that a perfect choir should consist of        FIRST TREBLES TENORS        SECOND TREBLES BASSES    well balanced as to numbers, and all singing with pure natural quality?  If I am, then it follows that the second trebles should be precisely  equal to the firsts in number and strength, and should include boys of  various ages, as carefully selected and as assiduously trained as the  others. I cannot but think--and, indeed, I perfectly well know--that  where this has been done by a skilful teacher, whose heart is in his  work, boy altos have been made to sing with sweetness and accuracy.    \"You will probably agree with me--though this is quite by the way--that  secular music should be largely used by such a teacher. The part-songs  of Mendelssohn, for instance, should be trolled out by the two sets of  boys, who may even interchange their parts at practice with the best  results. But of course this is said only in reference to choirs of a  high class.    \"I do not deny that even the best teaching and the best management will  not secure quite the same _timbre_ which you get in choirs with falsetti  in the alto part. A certain silvery sweetness is obtained from these  voices to which our English ears have become accustomed, and which we  should miss if boys, however well-trained, took their places. In the  Preces, Versicles, Litany, &c., of the English Choral Service, we should  be conscious of a loss. In cathedrals, too, the complete shelving of  some or even many compositions, favourites by long association, if not  by intrinsic merit, would be inevitable. But I am unable to doubt for a  moment that when the change had been made, and time had been given for  the new order of things, under a thoroughly competent musician, we  should not regret it.    \"At Ely we have ten men in daily attendance; fourteen on Sundays. We  keep twenty boys in training. If this vocal body were thus  distributed:--        10 FIRST TREBLES    5 TENORS (6 on Sunday)        10 SECOND TREBLES    5 BASSES (8 on Sunday)    we should certainly be stronger and healthier in tone and quality than  we are now, with a disproportionate number of trebles, thus:--        20 TREBLES     3 [4] TENORS        3 [4] ALTOS     4 [6] BASSES    As to rustic choirs in village churches, I fear the case is hopeless,  and I myself should be glad to see editions of well-known hymn-tunes and  chants in three parts only--treble, tenor, and bass. Handel wrote some  truly grand choruses in three parts in his 'Chandos Anthems.' But his  tenor part is not for every-day voices!    \"Believe me, truly yours,    \"W. E. DICKSON.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The following, from Dr. Haydn Keeton, organist of Peterborough  Cathedral, is against boy altos:--    \"Thorpe Road, Peterborough, _December 12th, 1890_.    \"Dear Sir,--I have had about eighteen years' experience with alto boys,  and although I have had some exceedingly good ones, one or two as good  as it is possible, I think, to have, yet I must say that, in my opinion,  it is a bad system to substitute boys for men, especially in cathedral  music. The reason why the change was made here was that about the year  1872 three of our men altos were failing, and I happened to have three  boys with good low voices, who took alto well. In consenting to this  change I had no idea of its being a permanent one, but owing to the  agricultural depression our Chapter have been quite prevented doing what  they would like to do with the choir. The general effect of the change  has been this--that I have been always weak in trebles. We are limited  to Peterborough for our choristers, and, as a rule, there is not one boy  in a hundred who knows even his notes when he enters the choir. It  takes from eighteen months to two years for a boy to learn his work, and  it is not until a boy is at least twelve that one can turn him into an  alto. The result is that four of my senior boys have to be turned into  altos, and I am left with a preponderance of young, inexperienced boys  as trebles. At the present time I have twelve trebles, eight of whom are  quite young.    \"In addition, see what extra work is involved in teaching the boys to  sing alto. Some boys do not take to alto very easily, and the extra work  given to the altos means that quantity taken from the trebles. I am  unable, in consequence, to give the necessary time to the elementary  work that one ought to give. We can only get one hour's practice in the  day, owing to the boys going to school.    \"Then, again, as to tone. The tone of a choir with men altos, if they  are at all fairly good, is so much superior to one with boy altos. In  cathedral music so many anthems and services have trios for A.T.B. There  is not one boy in a thousand who can sing the trio in 'O where shall  wisdom' (Boyce) with a tenor and"]]]
