The _butterfly_ is out from April to August.           *       *       *       *       *    THE WALL BUTTERFLY. (_Lasiommata Megaera._)    (Plate V. fig. 5.)    The habits and movements of this pretty species much resemble those of the  last; but the Wall Butterfly is a more sun-loving insect, and rather  frequents road-sides and dry sunny banks. Still, there are many spots where  one sees both the _Lasiommatas_ together.    The colours on the upper side are a _rich tawny or fulvous ground_, with  _dark-brown markings_, and pure {99} black eye-spots. The under side of the  hind wings is pencilled with sober colours, but in a design of great beauty  and delicacy; and especially to be admired are the double-ringed \"eyes,\" a  band of which runs parallel with the outer margin of the hind wings.    The _caterpillar_ feeds on grasses; is green, with three pale lines down  the back, and one more clearly marked on each side.    The _butterfly_ appears in May, and again in August and September; and is  everywhere common throughout the country.    It is called the Wall Butterfly from its frequent habit of choosing a  road-side _wall_ for a perch, whence, on the approach of man, it darts off;  returning again, however, on the departure of the obnoxious person.           *       *       *       *       *    THE GRAYLING BUTTERFLY. (_Hipparchia Semele._)    (Plate V. fig. 6, Female.)    This fine insect is the largest _British_ species of the genus, and also of  the family, some of the females measuring two inches and three-quarters  from tip to tip across the expanded wings; and it also exhibits more  vivacity of colouring than most of its brethren.    Above, the wings are deep brown, marked with {100} broad patches of paler  colour, sometimes making a bright contrast in the female, but much duller  and more uniform in the male.    The female also exceeds her lord considerably in stature, and, in fact, by  her side he looks rather a mean and shabby fellow.    The device on the under side of the hind wings, though composed of the  plainest colours, is very ornamental; grey and brown are the prevailing  hues, disposed in mottled bars and stripes, reminding one of agates, or  some other ornamental stones.    This butterfly is not everywhere to be found, but haunts rocky places and  hill-sides, on a chalky or limestone soil. At St. Boniface's Down, in the  Isle of Wight, I noticed it in such exceeding profusion last August, that I  could quickly have caught thousands, had I been so disposed.    Though a powerful-looking insect, its flight is by no means swift, and it  suffers itself to be captured without difficulty.    The _caterpillar_ is dull pinkish about the back, with three obscure  grey-green stripes, a dark line on the sides, and greenish beneath. It  feeds on grasses, and has been said to undergo its transformation to the  chrysalis in the earth; but this point requires confirmation.    The _butterfly_ is seen from the middle of July till the beginning of  September.    The following are localities for it:--Bembridge and Ventnor (Isle of  Wight), Brighton, Lewes, New Forest, Exeter, Plymouth, Falmouth, Truro,  Bristol, Dorsetshire, Salisbury Plain, Winchester, Worcester, Newmarket,  Gamlingay, Isle of Arran, Arthur's Seat (Edinburgh), Durham, Darlington,  Glasgow, Lake District.    [Illustration: XI.]    {101}    THE MEADOW BROWN BUTTERFLY. (_Hipparchia Janira._)    (Plate VI. fig. 1, Male; 1_a_, Female.)    Perhaps of all our butterflies this is the least attractive, being too  common to excite interest from its rarity or difficulty of attainment, as  other dingy butterflies do, and too plain and homely to win regard, in  spite of its commonness, as the beautiful \"Small Tortoise-shell\" and the  Common Blues do.    This is the sober brown insect that keeps up a constant fluttering, in  sunshine and gloom, over the dry pasture land and barren hill-side; and  perhaps it ought to find favour in our eyes, from this very fact of keeping  up a cheerful spirit under circumstances the most unfavourable to butterfly  enjoyment in general.    The colouring of the _male_, on the upper side, may be described as a  _sooty brown_, rather lighter about the eye-spot on the front wing. {102}    The _female_ is a little smarter in her attire, having an orange-tawny  patch on the front wing.    Beneath, both sexes are nearly alike; the general colour of the front wing  being fulvous, or orange-brown, with a cool-brown margin. The hind wings  are marked with tints of a duller brown, varying much in distinctness in  different specimens.    The _caterpillar_ is green, with a white stripe on each side. Feeds on  grasses.    The _butterfly_ abounds almost everywhere, from June till the end of  August.           *       *       *       *       *    THE LARGE HEATH BUTTERFLY. (_Hipparchia Tithonus._)    (Plate VI. fig. 2, Male.)    Though much less abundant than the last, this is another very common  species, and met with throughout England and the _south_ of Scotland.    The ground tint above is a _rich rust-colour_, or _orange-brown, bordered  with dark-brown_; the base of the wings also slightly clouded with the  same; and on each front wing, near the tip, there is a _black eye-spot_,  with _two white_ dots. So far, both sexes are similar; but the _male_ has,  in addition, a _bar of dark-brown across the centre of the rust-coloured  space_, on the upper wing. This sex is that figured on the plate. {103}    Underneath, there is a pretty arrangement of subdued colouring; that of the  front wings nearly resembling the upper side; the lower wings clouded and  spotted with russet-brown on a paler brown ground, the _dark rounded brown  spots_ having _white_ centres; but there are _no black_ eye-spots on the  hind wings.    The _caterpillar_ is greenish-grey, with reddish head and two pale lines on  each side and a dark one down the back.    The _butterfly_, a feeble flier and easily captured, appears in July and  August; its favourite resorts being heaths, dry fields, and lanes.    It is sometimes called the _Small_ Meadow Brown, and the Gate-keeper.           *       *       *       *       *    THE RINGLET BUTTERFLY. (_Hipparchia Hyperanthus._)    (Plate VI. fig. 3, Female.)    This is one of those butterflies in which Nature, departing from her  accustomed plan, has reserved the chief adornment of the wings for the  _under_ surface, leaving the upper comparatively plain and unattractive.    In both sexes the wings, above, are of a deep sepia brown, surrounded by a  greyish white fringe, and bearing several black spots in paler rings, which  rings are {104} much _less distinct_ in the _male_ than in the female, the  sex figured in the plate.    The under surface is of a soft russet ground, adorned with a wreath of the  _ringlet_-spots from which the insect takes its common name. These are  _black eye-spots_, white-centred and set in a clear ring of pale tawny  colour. The most usual form and proportions of these spots are shown in the  figure (with closed wings), but there are many varieties met with, the  following being the most remarkable that have come under my notice.    One, and not a very uncommon one, has _no light rings_ round the black  spots on the under side.    Another has the rings reduced to a range of mere light specks, the _black  eye-spots being entirely absent_.    Then again, another has the black _pupils_ exceedingly large and rich,  forming a most elegant variety.    The spots on the _upper_ side in the _male_ are sometimes quite  imperceptible.    The ground colour of the _upper_ side is occasionally of a pale drab or  fawn colour.    The _caterpillar_ of this species is very like that of the last in  colouring, and feeds on the same grasses.    The _butterfly_, which is out in June and July, is a common and widely  distributed species, frequenting woods, shady corners of hedge-rows, &c.           *       *       *       *       *    {105}    THE SCOTCH ARGUS BUTTERFLY. (_Erebia Blandina._)    (Plate VI. fig. 4, Female.)    The genus _Erebia_, to which this species belongs, is composed of a group  of mountain butterflies, very numerous in the Alpine regions of the  Continent, seventeen species being described as inhabiting the Alps; and,  though only two have yet been discovered in this country (unless we admit  _Ligea_, formerly taken in the Isle of Arran[10]), it is not at all  improbable that others may be waiting for us in some of the mountain  districts, if we will but look them up. Both tourists and, more especially,  residents in those localities should be encouraged by the hope of adding a  new species to our list to explore thoroughly the hill-sides and summits at  various seasons of the year, as many of the species, besides being  extremely local in their range, are only on the wing during a very short  period of the year.    The Scotch Argus is a pretty, though not brightly-coloured butterfly.    The colour above is a deep rich brown, with a coppery or orange-red band on  each wing, and each band has several (three or four usually) black  eye-spots thereon.    {106}    On the under side, the front wings are nearly the same as on the upper  side, showing the red patch and eyes plainly; but the hind wings are  without the red patch, and are divided into broad bands of brownish tints,  very variable, having sometimes a tendency to chocolate colour, sometimes  to an olive or russet brown: but the stripe which is shown as lightest in  the engraving of the under side is almost always greyer than the rest,  having occasionally a purplish ash colour. On this band are some minute  specks, occupying the places of the upper surface eyes.    The number of eye-spots is very variable on both surfaces.    The female, which is the sex figured, is both larger than the male and has  the reddish band of a brighter colour.    The _caterpillar_, whose food plant is unknown, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33874"],[0,"Wild Bees, Wasps and Ants and Other Stinging Insects (#15)"],[1,"know grows, because its early stages are of the same general  form as the perfect insect, and we see the little ones hopping about in  some places, and if we visit the same place later on we notice that they  have grown, but as soon as they cast their last skin and obtain the free  use of their wings, growth ceases, as it does in a fly or a beetle or in  any other insect.    It must not be supposed that the limbs of insects are of no value in their  identification. We only removed them in order to emphasize the great  importance of the character derived from the regional constrictions of the  body, which is considered to be certainly one of the most, if not the most,  important of any. Besides this character every perfect insect should have  six legs, four wings, and various appendages on the head, such as antennae,  mandibles, maxillae, labium, etc.; some of these may be so modified as  hardly to {128} be recognizable, but they are hardly ever absent  altogether; for instance, the two fore wings of a beetle are modified into  what are called wing cases, and fold over its back, protecting the two hind  wings, which are more or less membranous, as are those of a bee. They have  not the functions of locomotive organs, and are used in flight as poisers.  Again in the case of a fly, the hind wings seem to be absent, but they are  considered to be represented by two little projecting organs which look  like large headed pins or nails, but which are quite useless for locomotive  purposes.    The organs of the mouth are especially liable to modification, and on these  the older authors used to frame their classification. Insects were divided  by them, primarily, into two great divisions, viz. those which had a biting  and those which had a sucking mouth; treated in this way, the following  orders fall into the division with biting mouths:--    _Coleoptera_, or beetles; _Hymenoptera_, or bees, wasps, ants, etc.;  _Orthoptera_ and _Neuroptera_, which include the grasshoppers, earwigs,  cockroaches, dragonflies, May flies, etc. {129}    And into the division with sucking mouths:--    _Lepidoptera_, or butterflies and moths; _Diptera_ or flies, gnats, etc.;  _Hemiptera_, or bugs, including the plant-lice, etc.    These divisions, however, have not been found to be very satisfactory,  although very simple when dealing only with the perfect insect stage. In  the first place, being framed on this stage only, they are not always  applicable to the earlier phases of the insect's life--for instance,  although a butterfly or moth has a sucking proboscis, their caterpillars  have strong biting jaws, as any gardener well knows. Also bees, wasps,  etc., rather upset the arrangement, as they have not only a sucking mouth  but also strong biting jaws.    This system of classification has therefore been discarded by most  entomologists in favour of that based on the difference between those  insects which pass through the distinctive stages of caterpillar and  chrysalis on the one hand, and those which emerge from the egg as  diminutive likenesses of their parents on the other. In this arrangement,  the _Coleoptera_, _Hymenoptera_, _Lepidoptera_, _Diptera_ and _Neuroptera_,  fall into the {130} first division, or _Heteromorphae_ as they are called;  and the _Hemiptera_ and _Orthoptera_ into the second or _Homomorphae_. The  dragonflies are the only slightly discordant elements in this arrangement,  as, although their larvae have six legs and walk about under the water and  never assume an actual chrysalis condition, still they can hardly be said  to resemble their gorgeously coloured parents which fly about so  majestically over our ponds, etc.; still this is only one of the many cases  which show that nature cannot be held down by any of the arbitrary rules we  make for her classification.    The _Hymenoptera_ are therefore characterized and distinguished from other  insects by having both a biting and sucking mouth, four clear wings, and by  passing through the distinctive liveries of caterpillar or grub, and  chrysalis or nymph. It is with this order only with which we have been  dealing. To distinguish the aculeate section from the many other forms of  the _Hymenoptera_ is too complex a task to undertake here, but the presence  of a narrow waist between the thorax and the body, the number of joints in  the antennae never exceeding thirteen in {131} the male, twelve in the  female, and the presence of a sting capable of ejecting poison in this  latter sex, are the most prominent features by which the aculeates may be  recognized.           *       *       *       *       *    {132}    ON STRUCTURE    Although in the foregoing chapter a little has been said on this subject,  there is a great deal more that a student should learn about the general  form of these creatures.    They begin life as white or nearly colourless grubs, which, after various  changes of skin, assume what is called the nymph or pupa stage, during  which a change occurs, believed to be peculiar to the _Hymenoptera_; the  fifth segment of the larval body is transferred to the mass which is called  the thorax, so that a portion of what looks like thorax is really the first  segment of the abdomen. Continental writers call this portion sometimes the  first abdominal segment and sometimes the median segment, but Newman gave  it a definite name, the \"propodeum\", and the most convenient method seems  to be to call it so, and treat it as a part of the thorax, calling the  first or basal segment of the abdomen {133} that which immediately follows  the regional constriction, which occurs between the propodeum and the  abdomen.

The [male] has six ventral segments exposed, and  often the apex of the eighth, which is frequently elongate, the seventh  being almost always short and hidden; the eighth dorsal segment can be  discovered hidden under the seventh, but it is very rarely exposed. The  head (_a_) bears numerous appendages; a pair of antennae (_a_^1), usually  of thirteen joints in the male and of twelve in the female; two compound  eyes (_a_^3), composed of many facets; three simple eyes (or ocelli)  (_a_^2), which are situated on its vertex; two _mandibles_; two _maxillae_,  bearing _palpi_ on each side, of a varying number of joints; and a  _labium_, or tongue, which also bears at its base two four-jointed palpi  (cf. fig. 20).    The thorax, as we are considering it, consists of four segments--the  _prothorax_ (_b_^1), which bears the two front legs; the _mesothorax_  (_b_^2), which bears the intermediate pair of legs and the anterior pair of  wings; and the _metathorax_ (_b_^3), which bears the posterior pair of  wings and the hind legs. The {135} propodeum has no appendages. The  mesothorax above has two parts, a larger portion in front called by some  the _scutum_ (_b_^2), and a smaller portion behind called the _scutellum_  (_b_^3). These are separated from each other by a transverse impression,  and the scutellum is often raised into a sort of little shield; behind this  is another little elevation called the _post-scutellum_ (_b_^4); this is  really the dorsal apex of the metathorax, and behind this lies the  _propodeum_ (_b_^5). Each leg is composed of various parts, and articulates  into a cavity of the thorax called the _acetabulum_. The first two joints  of the leg, the _coxa_ (_d_^1) and the _trochanter_ (_d_^2), are very  short; then follows the _femur_ or thigh (_d_^3); then the _tibia_ or shin  (_d_^4); and finally the _tarsi_ (_d_^5), which compose the foot. At the  apex of the _tibia_ are usually two spines called the _calcaria_ (_d_^6).  The _tarsi_ are five-jointed, the joints following each other in a linear  arrangement, and in the _Anthophila_ the basal joint is more or less  dilated; the apical joint bears two claws (_unguiculi_, _d_^7) which are  sometimes toothed, and between them, in some genera, there is what is  called a _pulvillus_ (_d_^8) or cushion; this is very large and dilated in  some of the fossors. {136}    The wing neuration is always rather troublesome, as various authors use  different names for the veins and cells. To begin with the anterior wing  (_e_), there are four nerves which start from the base and run  horizontally; the first of these, which forms the anterior margin of the  wing, is called the _costal nervure_ (1); immediately below this, and  running almost parallel to it with scarcely any space between them, is the  _post-costal nervure_ (2); these end in the _stigma_ (_s_), a dark  in-crassation towards the apex of the wing; from the stigma a nerve,  curving first downwards and then up to the anterior margin of the wing,  encloses the _marginal cell_ (_A_). Below the _post-costal_ nervure, and  situated about the centre of the wing, is the third longitudinal nervure  called the"]]]
