Let's get out of this.\"    So they adjourned to the veranda forthwith.    \"Do you know, my mother said that she rather fancied you?\" announced  Percival presently. \"She said that you were very pleasant, and that such  a nice girl would be good for me to be with this summer. So I am to  cultivate your acquaintance.\"    \"Indeed!\" Beatrice laughed merrily, and then became grave. \"Percival,  you are terrible,\" she said reprovingly. \"You ought not to tell  everything that your mother says. I am quite sure that she would not  like it.\"    \"She doesn't,\" he answered promptly, a sparkle of mischief in his eyes.  \"But she can't help herself.\"    \"Why can't she? She could punish you. That might do some good.\"    \"I'd like to see anybody raise a hand to me,\" said the boy pompously,  reaching down and plucking a blade of grass which he bit into  nonchalantly. \"They don't dare do it. You see, I am the head of the  family. I make all the money in concerts. If it were not for me mamma  and old Heinrich would not have a cent. So I do just as I please.  Sometimes,\" he laughed a malicious little laugh, \"if I want anything  real bad I throw a fit just before the performance. My! My! but isn't  there some tall hustling then?\"    He laughed again, but the girl regarded him with shocked, pained eyes.  Her disapproval was so evident that he moved about restlessly under her  glance.    \"If my mother were living,\" spoke Bee slowly, \"and I could provide for  her by playing, or in any other way, I would be so glad to have her that  I would do anything I could for her. And I would try not to cause her  pain by being naughty.\"    \"Oh, I don't mind playing,\" confessed he. \"I like to take care of my  mother, and she is all right. We are great friends, but she doesn't  always give me what I want. I have to get it someway.\"    \"If I were she I wouldn't give in to you,\" spoke the girl severely. \"If  she would not you would go on and play anyway when you found that you  could not have what you wished. Now wouldn't you?\"    \"I never thought about it just that way,\" observed the Prodigy  thoughtfully, \"but--yes; I guess I would. You needn't go tell my mother  though. I'd have no end of trouble in getting the things I want, and old  Heinrich is bad enough now.\"    \"I am not a tattletale,\" exclaimed Bee indignantly. \"I don't repeat  things which I know people would rather I would not tell.\"    \"You mean that for me, Beatrice Raymond,\" cried the boy rising. \"I won't  trouble you by telling you anything more; that's certain. You may come  over to see my mother if you want to. I won't be at home to you. You are  entirely too dicta--dicta--\" He struggled valiantly with the word for a  moment, then gave it up, and bowing stiffly, stalked majestically away.    Beatrice's impulse was to call him back and apologize. Then, as she saw  him give a quick backward glance at her, a light broke upon her mind,  and she coolly retreated into the house.    \"The rogue! he is just too spoiled for anything,\" she laughed. \"He did  that, thinking that I would run after him. Well, I won't. A little  judicious snubbing will do him good.\"    \"Has Joel come back from town, Aunt Fanny?\" she asked as she entered the  kitchen.    \"Yes'm; he done kum back, Joel is. He brung a lettah from yer pa, I  'specs. Hit ain't from no lady nohow, an' no udder gem'mens gwine ter  write dat I knows anything erbout.\"    \"Certainly it is from father,\" said Bee, breaking the seal eagerly.  \"Although I might have a half dozen gem'mens writing to me for all you  know,\" she added, teasingly.    \"No, yer ain't, honey. Dey may kum in time, but yer too 'voted ter yer  pa right now for hit.\"    And so she talked while Beatrice perused her letter. It was short, and  ran as follows:         \"My dear Daughter:         \"I am writing in haste to inform you that I shall be home       Saturday morning, and shall bring with me four of the Faculty       of the University. They are enthusiastic Lepidopterists, and I       am sure that you will enjoy meeting with them. Now, my child,       they will remain for dinner, and while you manage very nicely       indeed with Aunt Fanny, I fear that this may tax your ability       too far. Could you not get some capable person to assist you       for the day?         \"I hope that you have not been very lonesome, and assuring you       that it will afford me the greatest pleasure to be with you       again, I am as ever,         \"Your affectionate father,         \"William Raymond.\"    Bee sat still for a long time gazing at the letter. Something about the  tone of it chilled her heart, and she could not but contrast it with  that other letter which also told of his homecoming. How full of love,  and tenderness, and longing, that had been; while this--Oh! would he  never, never care for her? Her eyes filled with a quick rush of tears.    \"Am hit bad news, honey?\" queried Aunt Fanny anxiously.    \"No; no, indeed.\" Bee dashed away her tears, and tried to speak  cheerfully. \"Father is coming home Saturday, and he will bring company  for dinner. There will be four scientific men with him, and he fears  that we shall not be able to manage by ourselves. What do you think?\"    \"Huh!\" snorted the negress scornfully. \"I'se cooked for more'n dat many.  Dey's nuffin but mens what ebber elsen dey is. I reckon dey feeds like  udder gem'mens if dey is satanic.\"    \"Scientific, Aunt Fanny,\" corrected the girl with a quick transition  from melancholy to mirth. \"Satanic means--\"    \"Nebber you min' what hit means, chile. I doesn't want no udder worman  a-trapesin' erbout my kitchen. You heah me? No'm; we'll manage, Miss  Bee. Jes' yer think what ter hab, an' I'll cook hit. We'll git ole  Rachel's Tillie ter wait on de table, an' dat's all de help we'll need.  She's a likely gal!\"    \"All right, Aunt Fanny. We will try it, and if we find that we are not  going to succeed we will get help. I'll think what to have, and we will  surprise father by giving a nice dinner.\"    Resolutely putting from her all thought of her father's coldness Bee  bent her whole energy to a study of a tempting menu for the dinner.    \"When Aunt Annie was going to have company she always studied to please  them,\" she mused. \"Some way her dinners always just suited the guests.  If I could have this dinner not only nice but distinctive, I should be  pleased. Father is susceptible to the influence of a good dinner. I  guess that all men are even if they are satanic.\" She laughed at the  recollection of Aunt Fanny's mistake, then concentrated her mind anew  upon the problem. Presently she jumped up, clapping her hands in glee.    \"I have it! I have it!\" she exclaimed joyfully. \"They are  Lepidopterists. I'll give them a Butterfly dinner.\"    With a definite purpose in view she could proceed to better advantage.  Still, it took hours and a great deal of anxious thought to perfect her  plan. The next few days were busy ones, but when at length Saturday  came, everything was in readiness for the guests.    It was an exceedingly warm July day, and the old vine-covered house  presented an inviting appearance. The walnut trees cast a grateful shade  over the wide veranda, and along the broad drive that ran down to the  gate on either side of which were shrubs and plants. The windows were  open to the breeze and all the rooms were gay with flowers.    Beatrice herself was not the least charming part of the picture as she  stood waiting with a pretty air of dignity to receive her father's  guests. Doctor Raymond's eyes lighted up with pride as he noted the ease  with which she greeted them, and his tone held a caressing inflection  as he said:    \"It is good to be home, Beatrice. I think the house never looked so  restful as it does today.\"    \"And I am glad that you are back father,\" said Bee with some shyness,  for he had not kissed her. She did not think that this might be on  account of the presence of guests. \"You must be very warm after being in  the sun. Will you take your friends to the library? It is cooler there,  and Aunt Fanny will serve lemonade immediately.\"    \"That is the right kind of a daughter to have, doctor,\" exclaimed one of  the scientists with appreciation. \"If going to the library means  lemonade, let us adjourn there instantly. I am as dry as a desert.\"          Chapter XIII    The Butterfly Dinner                         \"All human history attests      That happiness for man--the hungry sinner--      Since Eve ate apples, much depends on dinner.\"        --_Byron._      The dining room at Walnut Grove was a place furnished with more regard  for comfort than for show. There was an air about the apartment that  seemed to say that eating here was not a busy matter but one to be  observed in peace and leisure. The furniture was solid, substantial,  comfortable; mellowed by time and use. Had Beatrice but known it she had  a charming setting for her dinner.    \"It's only a bit of fun,\" she said to herself as she put the finishing  touches to the decorations. \"If they are not old fogies they will enjoy  it. I don't see how anything can go wrong. Everything is planned so  carefully, and the table does look nice.\"    Nevertheless her heart beat somewhat faster as her father ushered in his  guests, giving a hasty glance at the table as they took their places.    [Illustration: BEE ENTERTAINS HER FATHER'S FRIENDS.]    \"This seems to be a Butterfly dinner to judge from the decorations,\" he  observed with some anxiety in his manner. \"I don't know exactly what  that portends, but perhaps there will be something to satisfy us.\"    \"Our young hostess has evidently studied her subject,\" remarked one of  the scientists with an admiring glance at the table. \"Do you know, Miss  Raymond, that when I was a lad sweet peas were always associated in my  mind with butterflies?

During this  long period of tranquillity, so little occurred worth noticing, that I  shall leave the relation of this part of my life till another  opportunity, and hasten to give you an account of my next interview  with man, on which occasion it was that I began those observations on  his manner of making pit-falls, and other contrivances for our  destruction, which have been of such service in enabling us to avoid  these dangers. At this time, instead of losing one of our companions,  we had the pleasure of rescuing a member of another community from a  lingering and dreadful death.    We were quite on the other side of the island, several hundred miles  from the scene of the last tragedy. For some days we had been aware of  the neighbourhood of man from the smell of his watch-fires, and  accordingly we had doubled the number of our sentinels, and had taken  care not to wander far from each other. But we neither saw nor heard  anything of the enemy until about noon of a burning hot day, when, as  we were sheltering ourselves from the sun in a thick wood, we were  suddenly startled by loud shouts and yells, so discordant and hideous,  that we were sure they could be produced by no other animal but man. To  these cries we paid little attention, but presently was heard in the  same direction another sound--a sound which caused our very hearts to  burn within us, as we recognised the peculiar cry which a female of our  own species utters when in terrible distress and danger. A hasty  council was immediately called, when it was determined to rescue the  sufferer at all hazards, and twenty strong fellows, myself having the  command of the party, set off at full speed through the wood in the  direction of the cries,--every one of us bellowing as loud as we were  able.    A very short time sufficed to bring us within sight of the enemy. In an  open part of the forest was a troop of twenty or thirty hunters, but  very different in their appearance from those I have before described;  for these were nearly naked savages, on foot, and armed only with those  ridiculous things, bows and arrows--weapons which our good stout skins  enable us to laugh at. These wretches, as soon as they caught sight of  our formidable band, took to their heels in great confusion, flying in  every direction, like a herd of antelopes before the cruel tiger; we  did not deign to follow them, but hastened at once to the spot they had  left. Here we found a deep pit-fall, and at the bottom was an  exceedingly beautiful and very black female elephant unhurt by the  fall, for the pit being large, she had fortunately escaped the  murderous sharp-pointed stake, and her cry of distress was soon  exchanged for one of joyful recognition, as she saw so many of her  friends looking down upon her, and assuring her that they would leave  no means untried to rescue her from her prison. But this was a much  more difficult matter than we had supposed; for the pit was so deep,  that, when the captive stood up on her hind-legs, her eyes were but  just level with the ground, and though we made many efforts to lift her  out with our trunks, our attempts were always ended by our poor  friend's tumbling back again with great violence into the pit, and  nearly pulling three or four of us down with her. I now sent off a  messenger for our leader, who soon arrived, bringing the whole herd  with him; but numbers could not help us out of the difficulty.    At length, when we were beginning almost to despair, I chanced to  remember a plan, which I had heard was sometimes adopted by the  hunters, when they wished to take an elephant alive out of a pitfall.  Here, my children, was an instance of the advantage of _remembering  what we have heard_; and of remembering it at the right time too, for  our knowledge and experience are doubly useful to us when they enable  us to decide not only _wisely_, but _quickly_, in affairs of  difficulty.    The method, which, at my suggestion, we now adopted, was this;--with  our tusks we dug up the earth around the pit, and then shovelled it in  with our feet, while our friend below trampled it down hard as fast as  it came in. This was very laborious, tedious work for both parties, but  we were amply rewarded for our toil; for at length the pit was so far  filled up, that, with the assistance of our trunks, the poor captive  managed to scramble out of her dungeon. She was dreadfully exhausted  with fatigue and hunger, for she told us that she had been in captivity  for three days, and she had no doubt that the hunters intended to  starve her to death, for they had made no attempts either to release  her, or to put an end to her sufferings. I need not tell you that our  unfortunate friend received the hearty congratulations of our  community, and that she was supplied with abundance of the most  nourishing food we could collect, having first been conducted by two of  our females to the river to wash and refresh herself after her  sufferings.    So, when she was a little recovered, she informed us that she had  strayed away from her herd nearly a moon before, and that she was in  search of her companions when she met with her grievous disaster. Then  she begged permission to join our community, and the question being put  to the vote, was decided unanimously in her favour.    Who was this adopted stranger? My children, she was _your mother_! the  faithful friend, who for seventy years has rewarded me, by her  affectionate companionship, for my exertions in rescuing her from the  cruel grasp of her enemies.                     *       *       *       *       *    At this part of his story, said Jolly, the old elephant became so prosy  and tiresome, talking of his family affairs, and praising his great fat  black wife, that I have almost forgotten the rest of his adventures.  But I remember that he was chosen leader of the herd soon after his  marriage, partly on account of his cleverness in getting the old lady  out of the pit, but chiefly because, as he has already told us, his  companions believed that he had formerly been a tame elephant. He also  reminded his sons, that, though so old and infirm, he had lately broken  his tusk by fighting with and killing a very fierce rhinoceros.    So when the old fellow had finished his history, he and his sons moved  off slowly towards the thickest part of the forest, and as soon as they  were out of sight I slid down from the tree and ran home to our  encampment.    We set off next day in pursuit of another herd, which we soon fell in  with, and had good luck with our traps, so that we quickly loaded  ourselves with ivory. I persuaded my companions not to put any bait on  the pit-falls, for sure enough, as the elephant observed, it _does_  look very unnatural to see fruit and green branches growing on a beaten  path. But whether our success was occasioned by this alteration in our  plans, or to the elephants being less cunning than the others, I cannot  pretend to tell you; but I say, boys, how angry the old leader would  have been, if he had thought, that, by letting out this secret, he had  lent a helping hand to \"the contemptible little animals,\" as he had the  impertinence to call us!    But I have talked myself hoarse, and it is high time to turn in. So  good night, youngsters, all!                     *       *       *       *       *    Now _all_ my tales are finished, and I am going to add what an Irishman  might call a _Preface_, at the _end_ of the book. I have a reason for  this. If my preface had been placed at the beginning, perhaps you would  never have read it at all, but would have skipped over it, in hopes of  finding something more entertaining. For I was a _stranger_ to you when  you first took this little book into your hand, but now you have  finished it, I hope you will consider the author as a _friend_, who  will be very much grieved if you refuse to listen to his parting words.  And a very few words they shall be.    Do you think this book has been written for your _amusement_ only? That  was my principal object, certainly; but I also intended slyly to convey  a little _instruction_ also. Therefore, in the descriptions of the  forms and habits of animals, some of which, though not uncommon in this  country, were perhaps almost unknown to you before, the greatest care  has been taken to insert no  information which had not been proved to  be correct, either from consulting the best authors on the subject,[12]  or from my own observation. This may be called a _true story_, then,  except in one respect, that the characters have been endowed with the  gifts of speech and reason. How could I write a tale about animals that  could neither speak to each other, nor understand what was spoken to  them? And how can we be sure that \"dumb creatures,\" as they are often  called, are not improperly named so, and that they do not possess a  sort of language of their own? That they have the power of expressing  some of their sentiments to each other is certain.          [12] Especially \"Bell's History of British Quadrupeds,\" a work        abounding in valuable and most interesting matter, and adorned        with beautiful wood-cuts, many of which are complete portraits of        the animals they represent.    In studying the natural history of animals, we might at first suppose,  that some were less fitted for enjoyment than others, and we might say  that the mole, for instance, has had a hard lot assigned him, because  he is nearly deprived of sight, and is condemned to labour all his days  in searching for his food under the earth. But a more perfect knowledge  of the form and structure of this and other animals will convince us,  that they are _all_ so beautifully"]]]
