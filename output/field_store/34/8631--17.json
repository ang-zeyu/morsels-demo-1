He called at my rooms one beautiful morning when I  was feeling desperately tired of London and overworked and dying for a  holiday, and suggested that I should come to Combe Regis with him and  help him farm chickens. I have not regretted it.\"    \"It is a lovely place, isn't it?\"    \"The loveliest I have ever seen. How charming your garden is.\"    \"Shall we go and look at it? You have not seen the whole of it.\"    As she rose, I saw her book, which she had laid face downwards on the  grass beside her. It was the same much-enduring copy of the \"Manoeuvres  of Arthur.\" I was thrilled. This patient perseverance must surely mean  something. She saw me looking at it.    \"Did you draw Pamela from anybody?\" she asked suddenly.    I was glad now that I had not done so. The wretched Pamela, once my  pride, was for some reason unpopular with the only critic about whose  opinion I cared, and had fallen accordingly from her pedestal.    As we wandered down from the garden paths, she gave me her opinion of  the book. In the main it was appreciative. I shall always associate the  scent of yellow lupin with the higher criticism.    \"Of course, I don't know anything about writing books,\" she said.    \"Yes?\" my tone implied, or I hope it did, that she was an expert on  books, and that if she was not it didn't matter.    \"But I don't think you do your heroines well. I have just got 'The  Outsider--'\" (My other novel. Bastable & Kirby, 6s. Satirical. All  about Society--of which I know less than I know about chicken-farming.  Slated by _Times_ and _Spectator_. Well received by _London Mail_ and  _Winning Post_)--\"and,\" continued Phyllis, \"Lady Maud is exactly the  same as Pamela in the 'Manoeuvres of Arthur.' I thought you must have  drawn both characters from some one you knew.\"    \"No,\" I said. \"No. Purely imaginary.\"    \"I am so glad,\" said Phyllis.    And then neither of us seemed to have anything to say. My knees began  to tremble. I realised that the moment had arrived when my fate must be  put to the touch; and I feared that the moment was premature. We cannot  arrange these things to suit ourselves. I knew that the time was not  yet ripe; but the magic scent of the yellow lupin was too much for me.    \"Miss Derrick,\" I said hoarsely.    Phyllis was looking with more intentness than the attractions of the  flower justified at a rose she held in her hand. The bee hummed in the  lupin.    \"Miss Derrick,\" I said, and stopped again.    \"I say, you people,\" said a cheerful voice, \"tea is ready. Hullo,  Garnet, how are you? That medal arrived yet from the Humane Society?\"    I spun round. Mr. Tom Chase was standing at the end of the path. The  only word that could deal adequately with the situation slapped against  my front teeth. I grinned a sickly grin.    \"Well, Tom,\" said Phyllis.    And there was, I thought, just the faintest tinkle of annoyance in her  voice.     * * * * *    \"I've been bathing,\" said Mr. Chase, _a propos des bottes_.    \"Oh,\" I replied. \"And I wish,\" I added, \"that you'd drowned yourself.\"    But I added it silently to myself.        CHAPTER XIII    TEA AND TENNIS    \"Met the professor's late boatman on the Cob,\" said Mr. Chase,  dissecting a chocolate cake.    \"Clumsy man,\" said Phyllis. \"I hope he was ashamed of himself. I shall  never forgive him for trying to drown papa.\"    My heart bled for Mr. Henry Hawk, that modern martyr.    \"When I met him,\" said Tom Chase, \"he looked as if he had been trying  to drown his sorrow as well.\"    \"I knew he drank,\" said Phyllis severely, \"the very first time I saw  him.\"    \"You might have warned the professor,\" murmured Mr. Chase.    \"He couldn't have upset the boat if he had been sober.\"    \"You never know. He may have done it on purpose.\"    \"Tom, how absurd.\"    \"Rather rough on the man, aren't you?\" I said.    \"Merely a suggestion,\" continued Mr. Chase airily. \"I've been reading  sensational novels lately, and it seems to me that Mr. Hawk's cut out  to be a minion. Probably some secret foe of the professor's bribed him.\"    My heart stood still. Did he know, I wondered, and was this all a  roundabout way of telling me he knew?    \"The professor may be a member of an Anarchist League, or something,  and this is his punishment for refusing to assassinate some sportsman.\"    \"Have another cup of tea, Tom, and stop talking nonsense.\"    Mr. Chase handed in his cup.    \"What gave me the idea that the upset was done on purpose was this. I  saw the whole thing from the Ware Cliff. The spill looked to me just  like dozens I had seen at Malta.\"    \"Why do they upset themselves on purpose at Malta particularly?\"  inquired Phyllis.    \"Listen carefully, my dear, and you'll know more about the ways of the  Navy that guards your coasts than you did before. When men are allowed  on shore at Malta, the owner has a fancy to see them snugly on board  again at a certain reasonable hour. After that hour any Maltese  policeman who brings them aboard gets one sovereign, cash. But he has  to do all the bringing part of it on his own. Consequence is, you see  boats rowing out to the ship, carrying men who have overstayed their  leave; and when they get near enough, the able-bodied gentleman in  custody jumps to his feet, upsets the boat, and swims for the gangway.  The policemen, if they aren't drowned--they sometimes are--race him,  and whichever gets there first wins. If it's the policeman, he gets his  sovereign. If it's the sailor, he is considered to have arrived not in  a state of custody and gets off easier. What a judicious remark that  was of the governor of North Carolina to the governor of South  Carolina, respecting the length of time between drinks. Just one more  cup, please, Phyllis.\"    \"But how does all that apply?\" I asked, dry-mouthed.    \"Mr. Hawk upset the professor just as those Maltese were upset. There's  a patent way of doing it. Furthermore, by judicious questioning, I  found that Hawk was once in the Navy, and stationed at Malta. _Now_,  who's going to drag in Sherlock Holmes?\"    \"You don't really think--?\" I said, feeling like a criminal in the dock  when the case is going against him.    \"I think friend Hawk has been re-enacting the joys of his vanished  youth, so to speak.\"    \"He ought to be prosecuted,\" said Phyllis, blazing with indignation.    Alas, poor Hawk!    \"Nobody's safe with a man of that sort, hiring out a boat.\" Oh,  miserable Hawk!    \"But why on earth should he play a trick like that on Professor  Derrick, Chase?\"    \"Pure animal spirits, probably. Or he may, as I say, be a minion.\"    I was hot all over.    \"I shall tell father that,\" said Phyllis in her most decided voice,  \"and see what he says. I don't wonder at the man taking to drink after  doing such a thing.\"    \"I--I think you're making a mistake,\" I said.    \"I never make mistakes,\" Mr. Chase replied. \"I am called Archibald the  All-Right, for I am infallible. I propose to keep a reflective eye upon  the jovial Hawk.\"    He helped himself to another section of the chocolate cake.    \"Haven't you finished _yet_, Tom?\" inquired Phyllis. \"I'm sure Mr.  Garnet's getting tired of sitting talking here,\" she said.    I shot out a polite negative. Mr. Chase explained with his mouth full  that he had by no means finished. Chocolate cake, it appeared, was the  dream of his life. When at sea he was accustomed to lie awake o' nights  thinking of it.    \"You don't seem to realise,\" he said, \"that I have just come from a  cruise on a torpedo-boat. There was such a sea on as a rule that  cooking operations were entirely suspended, and we lived on ham and  sardines--without bread.\"    \"How horrible!\"    \"On the other hand,\" added Mr. Chase philosophically, \"it didn't matter  much, because we were all ill most of the time.\"    \"Don't be nasty, Tom.\"    \"I was merely defending myself. I hope Mr. Hawk will be able to do as  well when his turn comes. My aim, my dear Phyllis, is to show you in a  series of impressionist pictures the sort of thing I have to go through  when I'm not here. Then perhaps you won't rend me so savagely over a  matter of five minutes' lateness for breakfast.\"    \"Five minutes! It was three-quarters of an hour, and everything was  simply frozen.\"    \"Quite right too in weather like this. You're a slave to convention,  Phyllis. You think breakfast ought to be hot, so you always have it  hot. On occasion I prefer mine cold. Mine is the truer wisdom. You can  give the cook my compliments, Phyllis, and tell her--gently, for I  don't wish the glad news to overwhelm her--that I enjoyed that cake.  Say that I shall be glad to hear from her again. Care for a game of  tennis, Garnet?\"    \"What a pity Norah isn't here,\" said Phyllis. \"We could have had a  four.\"    \"But she is at present wasting her sweetness on the desert air of  Yeovil. You had better sit down and watch us, Phyllis. Tennis in this  sort of weather is no job for the delicately-nurtured feminine. I will  explain the finer points of my play as we go on. Look out particularly  for the Tilden Back-Handed Slosh. A winner every time.\"    We proceeded to the tennis court. I played with the sun in my eyes. I  might, if I chose, emphasise that fact, and attribute my subsequent  rout to it, adding, by way of solidifying the excuse, that I was  playing in a strange court with a borrowed racquet, and that my mind  was preoccupied--firstly, with _l'affaire_ Hawk, secondly, and chiefly,  with the gloomy thought that Phyllis and my opponent seemed to be on  friendly terms with each other. Their manner at tea had been almost  that of an engaged couple. There was a thorough understanding between  them. I will not, however, take refuge behind excuses. I admit, without  qualifying the statement, that Mr. Chase was too good for me. I had  always been under the impression that lieutenants in the Royal Navy  were not brilliant at tennis. I had met them at various houses, but  they had never shone"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38290"],[0,"Speciation and Evolution of the Pygmy Mice, Genus Baiomys (#15)"],[1,"us_, _fuliginatus_, and _subater_. The  two first-mentioned subspecies occur at high altitudes, and the other,  _subater_, occurs in the humid coastal region of Texas. The paler  subspecies, _taylori_, _canutus_, and _allex_, occur at lower altitudes.  Two subspecies that occur at relatively high altitudes, _ater_ and  _paulus_, are reddish-brown. The color of pelage in these subspecies  resembles the color of soil upon which they live. Blair and Blossom  (1948:5) demonstrated close correlation of color of soil with color of  pelage in _B. t. ater_ by use of an Ives tint photometer.        [Illustration: FIG. 11.

Baker (1951:213) reports the species from 2 km. W El Carrizo,  Tamaulipas, in dense grass and weeds at the edge of a cornfield. Hooper  (1953:7) recorded the northern pygmy mouse in a cultivated field  overgrown with herbaceous vegetation at Pano Ayuctle, Tamaulipas. In the  State of Sinaloa, Hooper (1955b:13) obtained specimens in grass and  among shrubs and vines bordering a fallow field. The northern pygmy  mouse, in general, lives in situations more xerophytic and more grassy  than does the southern pygmy mouse.    The northern pygmy mouse, as the southern pygmy mouse, is locally  abundant in its geographic range. Stickel and Stickel (_op. cit._: 145)  pointed out that on the third night of live-trapping in Bexar County,  Texas, there was a sudden increase in unmarked pygmy mice trapped. This  increase in numbers, after the resident population was seemingly marked,  followed a one-half inch rainfall. Collectors from the University of  Kansas, myself included, have had similar experiences in trapping these  mice. In the Mexican states of Guanajuato, Queretaro, and Jalisco, _B.  taylori_ is one of the commonest small mammals. In New Mexico and  Arizona and the Mexican states of Sonora and Sinaloa, nevertheless,  these mice are rare.    Stickel and Stickel (_loc. cit._) thought that the home range normal for  _B. taylori_ in a grassy habitat was less than 100 square feet, but  Blair (1953:10) thought that a complete home range had not been recorded  by Stickel and Stickel.    _Behavior._--The northern pygmy mouse is crepuscular to nocturnal and  where I trapped in northern Mexico was one of the first small rodents to  appear in my traps in the evening. Hall and Villa-R (1949:460) recorded  this habit in Michoacan. Observations of wild-taken _B. taylori_ held in  captivity, lend support to its being crepuscular. Captives were rarely  active in bright lights, but in diffuse or dim lights the same mice were  active.    Blair (1941:381) pointed out that captive _B. t. subater_ were much more  tolerant of one another than mice of the genus _Peromyscus_. He pointed  out also that males aided in care of young. In one litter born in  captivity in the course of my study, the female killed the male when the  young were four days old. In another instance, the female and two  eight-day-old young were killed by the male. Until that time, the male,  female, and young had lived together peacefully. In other litters born  in captivity, adult males did not harm the other mice.    I have noted, as Blair (_loc. cit._) did, that _B. taylori_ utters  high-pitched squeals in a \"singing\" posture resembling that of the  coyote, yet remains silent when being handled.    The northern pygmy mouse makes runways in the grass, in miniature  resembling those of _Microtus_, and often uses runways constructed by  _Sigmodon_. A small firm nest of finely shredded plant material (mostly  grasses) is constructed in burrows or under logs, rocks, or fallen  cactus plants. Thomas (1888:447) recorded nests of fine curly grass and  cornsilk. Secondary refuge nests are not uncommon. Thomas (_loc. cit._)  states, \"If other mice live in the same place, the individuals of  _Baiomys_ watch till others disappear, then suddenly steal part of the  other nest and run to their own with it.\"    _Enemies and food._--Little is recorded of the animals that prey upon  the northern pygmy mouse. Twente and Baker (1951:120) found remains of  _B. taylori_ in 16 per cent of barn owl pellets (_Tyto alba pratincola_)  collected 21 mi. SW Guadalajara, Jalisco. Presumably most of the  crepuscular and early nocturnal raptorial birds and carnivorous mammals  feed on these mice.    Food of _B. taylori_ consists in part of grass seeds and leaves, prickly  pear (_Opuntia_ sp.) and the softer exposed parts of roots of vegetation  among which the mice reside.    _Reproduction._--The northern pygmy mouse breeds throughout the year.  The only months in which I have not recorded pregnant females or females  with young are June and October. Forty-one records of embryos or young  per litter average 2.48 (less than in _B. musculus_), and range from as  few as one to as many as four per litter.      =Baiomys taylori allex= (Osgood)        _Peromyscus allex_ Osgood, Proc.

Coll.); Colima (City), Colima, Republic of Mexico, obtained  on March 7, 1892, by E. W. Nelson, original number 2029.    _Range._--Colima, western lowlands of Michoacan and Jalisco, thence  north into southern half of Nayarit, see Figure 11. Zonal range: arid  lower tropical, approximates northern half of the Nayarit-Guerrero  Biotic Province of Goldman and Moore (1945:349). Occurs from near sea  level in Nayarit, up to 4000 feet in Jalisco.    _Diagnosis._--Size small for the species; dorsal ground color pale  grayish-brown, near Isabella color; mid-dorsal region washed with  blackish, individual guard hairs black to base, other hairs black-tipped  with subterminal light olive bands, Neutral Gray at base; laterally,  black-tipped hairs less abundant, hairs grayish-white to base; venter  Pale Gull Gray to whitish, distal half of individual hairs white,  proximal half Neutral Gray; hairs in regions of throat and chin white to  base; facial region colored like dorsum, becoming paler below eye; in  region of mouth, hairs white to base; dorsalmost vibrissae black to  base, others white to base; ears flesh-colored, sparsely haired; tail  unicolored, sparsely haired for the species; dark blotches on tail of  some series (particularly the paratypical series); dorsal and ventral  parts of forefeet and hind feet flesh-colored, whitish to gray in some  series. Slightly smaller in most cranial dimensions. Maxillary part of  zygoma forming almost a right angle with rostrum, rather than tapering  at less than a right angle to rostrum; supraoccipital rounded  posteriorly rather than indented on each side of foramen magnum;  cranium, relative to length of rostrum, more nearly square;  interparietal large relative to size of cranium. Average and extreme  measurements of five adults from 2 mi.
