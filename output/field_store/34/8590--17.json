Satellite earth station - a communications facility with a microwave  radio transmitting and receiving antenna and required receiving and  transmitting equipment for communicating with satellites.  Satellite link - a radio connection between a satellite and an earth  station permitting communication between them, either one-way (down  link from satellite to earth station - television receive-only  transmission) or two-way (telephone channels).  SHF - super high frequency; any radio frequency in the 3,000- to  30,000-MHz range.  Shortwave - radio frequencies (from 1.605 to 30 MHz) that fall above  the commercial broadcast band and are used for communication over  long distances.  Solidaridad - geosynchronous satellites in Mexico's system of  international telecommunications in the Western Hemisphere.  Statsionar - Russia's geostationary system for satellite  telecommunications.  Submarine cable - a cable designed for service under water.  TAT - Trans-Atlantic Telephone; any of a number of high-capacity  submarine coaxial telephone cables linking Europe with North America.  Telefax - facsimile service between subscriber stations via the  public switched telephone network or the international Datel network.  Telegraph - a telecommunications system designed for unmodulated  electric impulse transmission.  Telex - a communication service involving teletypewriters connected  by wire through automatic exchanges.  Tropospheric scatter - a form of microwave radio transmission in  which the troposphere is used to scatter and reflect a fraction of  the incident radio waves back to earth; powerful, highly directional  antennas are used to transmit and receive the microwave signals;  reliable over-the-horizon communications are realized for distances  up to 600 miles in a single hop; additional hops can extend the  range of this system for very long distances.  Trunk network - a network of switching centers, connected by  multichannel trunk lines.  UHF - ultra high frequency; any radio frequency in the 300- to  3,000-MHz range.  VHF - very high frequency; any radio frequency in the 30- to 300-MHz  range.    Telephones - main lines in use    This entry gives the total number of main telephone lines in use.    Telephones - mobile cellular    This entry gives the total number of mobile cellular telephone  subscribers.    Television broadcast stations    This entry gives the total number of separate broadcast stations  plus any repeater stations.      Terminology    Due to the highly structured nature of the Factbook database, some  collective generic terms have to be used. For example, the word  Country in the Country name entry refers to a wide variety of  dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and  other entities in addition to the traditional countries or  independent states. Military is also used as an umbrella term for  various civil defense, security, and defense activities in many  entries. The Independence entry includes the usual colonial  independence dates and former ruling states as well as other  significant nationhood dates such as the traditional founding date  or the date of unification, federation, confederation,  establishment, or state succession that are not strictly  independence dates. Dependent areas have the nature of their  dependency status noted in this same entry.    Terrain    This entry contains a brief description of the topography.      Time difference    This entry is expressed in The World Factbook in two ways. First, it  is stated as the difference in hours between the capital of an  entity and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) during Standard Time.  Additionally, the difference in time between the capital of an  entity and that observed in Washington, D.C. is also provided. Note  that the time difference assumes both locations are simultaneously  observing Standard Time or Daylight Saving Time.      Time zones    Ten countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia, Kazakhstan,  Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, and the United States) and the  island of Greenland observe more than one official time depending on  the number of designated time zones within their boundaries. An  illustration of time zones throughout the world and within countries  can be seen in the Standard Time Zones of the World map included in  the Reference Maps section of The World Factbook.    Total fertility rate    This entry gives a figure for the average number of children that  would be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their  childbearing years and bore children according to a given fertility  rate at each age. The total fertility rate (TFR) is a more direct  measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate, since  it refers to births per woman. This indicator shows the potential  for population change in the country. A rate of two children per  woman is considered the replacement rate for a population, resulting  in relative stability in terms of total numbers. Rates above two  children indicate populations growing in size and whose median age  is declining. Higher rates may also indicate difficulties for  families, in some situations, to feed and educate their children and  for women to enter the labor force. Rates below two children  indicate populations decreasing in size and growing older. Global  fertility rates are in general decline and this trend is most  pronounced in industrialized countries, especially Western Europe,  where populations are projected to decline dramatically over the  next 50 years.    Total renewable water resources    This entry provides the long-term average water availability for a  country in cubic kilometers of precipitation, recharged ground  water, and surface inflows from surrounding countries. The values  have been adjusted to account for overlap resulting from surface  flow recharge of groundwater sources. Total renewable water  resources provides the water total available to a country but does  not include water resource totals that have been reserved for  upstream or downstream countries through international agreements.  Note that these values are averages and do not accurately reflect  the total available in any given year. Annual available resources  can vary greatly due to short-term and long-term climatic and  weather variations.    Trafficking in persons    Trafficking in persons is modern-day slavery, involving victims who  are forced, defrauded, or coerced into labor or sexual exploitation.  The International Labor Organization (ILO), the UN agency charged  with addressing labor standards, employment, and social protection  issues, estimates that 12.3 million people worldwide are enslaved in  forced labor, bonded labor, forced child labor, sexual servitude,  and involuntary servitude at any given time. Human trafficking is a  multi-dimensional threat, depriving people of their human rights and  freedoms, risking global health, promoting social breakdown,  inhibiting development by depriving countries of their human  capital, and helping fuel the growth of organized crime. In 2000,  the US Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act  (TVPA), reauthorized in 2003 and 2005, which provides tools for the  US to combat trafficking in persons, both domestically and abroad.  One of the law's key components is the creation of the US Department  of State's annual Trafficking in Persons Report, which assesses the  government response (i.e., the current situation) in some 150  countries with a significant number of victims trafficked across  their borders who are recruited, harbored, transported, provided, or  obtained for forced labor or sexual exploitation. Countries in the  annual report are rated in three tiers, based on government efforts  to combat trafficking. The countries identified in this entry are  those listed in the 2008 Trafficking in Persons Report as Tier 2  Watch List or Tier 3 based on the following tier rating definitions:  Tier 2 Watch List countries do not fully comply with the minimum  standards for the elimination of trafficking but are making  significant efforts to do so, and meet one of the following criteria:  1. they display high or significantly increasing number of victims,  2. they have failed to provide evidence of increasing efforts to  combat trafficking in persons, or,  3. they have committed to take action over the next year.  Tier 3 countries neither satisfy the minimum standards for the  elimination of trafficking nor demonstrate a significant effort to  do so. Countries in this tier are subject to potential  non-humanitarian and non-trade sanctions.      Transnational issues    This category includes four entries - Disputes - international,  Refugees and internally displaced persons, Trafficking in persons,  and Illicit drugs - that deal with current issues going beyond  national boundaries.      Transportation    This category includes the entries dealing with the means for  movement of people and goods.    Transportation - note    This entry includes miscellaneous transportation information of  significance not included elsewhere.    U      UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)    See entry for Coordinated Universal Time.    Unemployment rate    This entry contains the percent of the labor force that is without  jobs. Substantial underemployment might be noted.    Urbanization    This entry provides two measures of the degree of urbanization of a  population. The first, urban population, describes the percentage of  the total population living in urban areas, as defined by the  country. The second, rate of urbanization, describes the projected  average rate of change of the size of the urban population over the  given period of time. Additionally, the World entry includes a list  of the ten largest urban agglomerations. An urban"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35830"],[0,"The 2010 CIA World Factbook (#15)"],[1,"election. International movements or organizations are  generally not listed.        Population      This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the Census based  on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics  registration systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent  past and on assumptions about future trends. The total population  presents one overall measure of the potential impact of the country  on the world and within its region. Note: Starting with the 1993  Factbook, demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African)  have explicitly taken into account the effects of the growing impact  of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. These countries are currently: The  Bahamas, Benin, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi,  Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of  the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon,  Ghana, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique,  Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania,  Thailand, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.        Population below poverty line      National estimates of the percentage of the population falling below  the poverty line are based on surveys of sub-groups, with the  results weighted by the number of people in each group. Definitions  of poverty vary considerably among nations. For example, rich  nations generally employ more generous standards of poverty than  poor nations.        Population growth rate      The average annual percent change in the population, resulting from  a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of  migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or  negative. The growth rate is a factor in determining how great a  burden would be imposed on a country by the changing needs of its  people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing,  roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid  population growth can be seen as threatening by neighboring  countries.        Ports and terminals      This entry lists major ports and terminals primarily on the basis of  the amount of cargo tonnage shipped through the facilities on an  annual basis. In some instances, the number of containers handled or  ship visits were also considered.        Public debt      This entry records the cumulative total of all government borrowings  less repayments that are denominated in a country's home currency.  Public debt should not be confused with external debt, which  reflects the foreign currency liabilities of both the private and  public sector and must be financed out of foreign exchange earnings.        R          Railways      This entry states the total route length of the railway network and  of its component parts by gauge: broad, standard, narrow, and dual.  Other gauges are listed under note.    Rare earth elements      Rare earth elements or REEs are 17 chemical elements that are  critical in many of today's high-tech industries. They include  lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium,  europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium,  ytterbium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium. Typical applications for  REEs include batteries in hybrid cars, fiber optic cables, flat  panel displays, and permanent magnets, as well as some defense and  medical products.    Reference maps      This section includes world and regional maps.        Refugees and internally displaced persons      This entry includes those persons residing in a country as refugees  or internally displaced persons (IDPs). The definition of a refugee  according to a United Nations Convention is \"a person who is outside  his/her country of nationality or habitual residence; has a  well-founded fear of persecution because of his/her race, religion,  nationality, membership in a particular social group or political  opinion; and is unable or unwilling to avail himself/herself of the  protection of that country, or to return there, for fear of  persecution.\" The UN established the Office of the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1950 to handle refugee matters  worldwide. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in  the Near East (UNRWA) has a different operational definition for a  Palestinian refugee: \"a person whose normal place of residence was  Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948 and who lost  both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict.\"  However, UNHCR also assists some 400,000 Palestinian refugees not  covered under the UNRWA definition. The term \"internally displaced  person\" is not specifically covered in the UN Convention; it is used  to describe people who have fled their homes for reasons similar to  refugees, but who remain within their own national territory and are  subject to the laws of that state.        Religions      This entry is an ordered listing of religions by adherents starting  with the largest group and sometimes includes the percent of total  population. The core characteristics and beliefs of the world's  major religions are described below.  Baha'i - Founded by Mirza Husayn-Ali (known as Baha'u'llah) in Iran  in 1852, Baha'i faith emphasizes monotheism and believes in one  eternal transcendent God. Its guiding focus is to encourage the  unity of all peoples on the earth so that justice and peace may be  achieved on earth. Baha'i revelation contends the prophets of major  world religions reflect some truth or element of the divine,  believes all were manifestations of God given to specific  communities in specific times, and that Baha'u'llah is an additional  prophet meant to call all humankind. Bahais are an open community,  located worldwide, with the greatest concentration of believers in  South Asia.  Buddhism - Religion or philosophy inspired by the 5th century B.C.  teachings of Siddhartha Gautama (also known as Gautama Buddha \"the  enlightened one\"). Buddhism focuses on the goal of spiritual  enlightenment centered on an understanding of Gautama Buddha's Four  Noble Truths on the nature of suffering, and on the Eightfold Path  of spiritual and moral practice, to break the cycle of suffering of  which we are a part. Buddhism ascribes to a karmic system of  rebirth. Several schools and sects of Buddhism exist, differing  often on the nature of the Buddha, the extent to which enlightenment  can be achieved - for one or for all, and by whom - religious orders  or laity.  Basic Groupings     Theravada Buddhism: The oldest Buddhist school, Theravada is  practiced mostly in Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos, Burma, and Thailand,  with minority representation elsewhere in Asia and the West.  Theravadans follow the Pali Canon of Buddha's teachings, and believe  that one may escape the cycle of rebirth, worldly attachment, and  suffering for oneself; this process may take one or several  lifetimes.     Mahayana Buddhism, including subsets Zen and Tibetan Buddhism:  Forms of Mahayana Buddhism are common in East Asia and Tibet, and  parts of the West. Mahayanas have additional scriptures beyond the  Pali Canon and believe the Buddha is eternal and still teaching.  Unlike Theravada Buddhism, Mahayana schools maintain the  Buddha-nature is present in all beings and all will ultimately  achieve enlightenment.  Christianity - Descending from Judaism, Christianity's central  belief maintains Jesus of Nazareth is the promised messiah of the  Hebrew Scriptures, and that his life, death, and resurrection are  salvific for the world. Christianity is one of the three  monotheistic Abrahamic faiths, along with Islam and Judaism, which  traces its spiritual lineage to Abraham of the Hebrew Scriptures.  Its sacred texts include the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament (or  the Christian Gospels).  Basic Groupings     Catholicism (or Roman Catholicism): This is the oldest  established western Christian church and the world's largest single  religious body. It is supranational, and recognizes a hierarchical  structure with the Pope, or Bishop of Rome, as its head, located at  the Vatican. Catholics believe the Pope is the divinely ordered head  of the Church from a direct spiritual legacy of Jesus' apostle  Peter. Catholicism is comprised of 23 particular Churches, or Rites  - one Western (Roman or Latin-Rite) and 22 Eastern. The Latin Rite  is by far the largest, making up about 98% of Catholic membership.  Eastern-Rite Churches, such as the Maronite Church and the Ukrainian  Catholic Church, are in communion with Rome although they preserve  their own worship traditions and their immediate hierarchy consists  of clergy within their own rite. The Catholic Church has a  comprehensive theological and moral doctrine specified for believers  in its catechism, which makes it unique among most forms of  Christianity.     Mormonism (including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day  Saints): Originating in 1830 in the United States under Joseph  Smith, Mormonism is not characterized as a form of Protestant  Christianity because it claims additional revealed Christian  scriptures after the Hebrew Bible and New Testament. The Book of  Mormon maintains there was an appearance of Jesus in the New World  following the Christian account of his resurrection, and that the  Americas are uniquely blessed continents. Mormonism believes earlier  Christian traditions, such as the Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and  Protestant reform faiths, are apostasies and that Joseph Smith's  revelation of the Book of Mormon is a restoration of true  Christianity. Mormons have a hierarchical religious leadership  structure, and actively proselytize their faith; they are located  primarily in the Americas and in a number of other Western countries.     Orthodox Christianity: The oldest established eastern form of  Christianity, the Holy Orthodox Church, has a ceremonial head in the  Bishop of Constantinople (Istanbul), also known as a Patriarch,"]]]
