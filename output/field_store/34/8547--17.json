And by this means might Telescopes be  brought to sufficient perfection, were it not for the different  Refrangibility of several sorts of Rays. But by reason of this different  Refrangibility, I do not yet see any other means of improving Telescopes  by Refractions alone, than that of increasing their lengths, for which  end the late Contrivance of _Hugenius_ seems well accommodated. For very  long Tubes are cumbersome, and scarce to be readily managed, and by  reason of their length are very apt to bend, and shake by bending, so as  to cause a continual trembling in the Objects, whereby it becomes  difficult to see them distinctly: whereas by his Contrivance the Glasses  are readily manageable, and the Object-glass being fix'd upon a strong  upright Pole becomes more steady.    Seeing therefore the Improvement of Telescopes of given lengths by  Refractions is desperate; I contrived heretofore a Perspective by  Reflexion, using instead of an Object-glass a concave Metal. The  diameter of the Sphere to which the Metal was ground concave was about  25 _English_ Inches, and by consequence the length of the Instrument  about six Inches and a quarter. The Eye-glass was Plano-convex, and the  diameter of the Sphere to which the convex side was ground was about 1/5  of an Inch, or a little less, and by consequence it magnified between 30  and 40 times. By another way of measuring I found that it magnified  about 35 times. The concave Metal bore an Aperture of an Inch and a  third part; but the Aperture was limited not by an opake Circle,  covering the Limb of the Metal round about, but by an opake Circle  placed between the Eyeglass and the Eye, and perforated in the middle  with a little round hole for the Rays to pass through to the Eye. For  this Circle by being placed here, stopp'd much of the erroneous Light,  which otherwise would have disturbed the Vision. By comparing it with a  pretty good Perspective of four Feet in length, made with a concave  Eye-glass, I could read at a greater distance with my own Instrument  than with the Glass. Yet Objects appeared much darker in it than in the  Glass, and that partly because more Light was lost by Reflexion in the  Metal, than by Refraction in the Glass, and partly because my Instrument  was overcharged. Had it magnified but 30 or 25 times, it would have made  the Object appear more brisk and pleasant. Two of these I made about 16  Years ago, and have one of them still by me, by which I can prove the  truth of what I write. Yet it is not so good as at the first. For the  concave has been divers times tarnished and cleared again, by rubbing  it with very soft Leather. When I made these an Artist in _London_  undertook to imitate it; but using another way of polishing them than I  did, he fell much short of what I had attained to, as I afterwards  understood by discoursing the Under-workman he had employed. The Polish  I used was in this manner. I had two round Copper Plates, each six  Inches in Diameter, the one convex, the other concave, ground very true  to one another. On the convex I ground the Object-Metal or Concave which  was to be polish'd, 'till it had taken the Figure of the Convex and was  ready for a Polish. Then I pitched over the convex very thinly, by  dropping melted Pitch upon it, and warming it to keep the Pitch soft,  whilst I ground it with the concave Copper wetted to make it spread  eavenly all over the convex. Thus by working it well I made it as thin  as a Groat, and after the convex was cold I ground it again to give it  as true a Figure as I could. Then I took Putty which I had made very  fine by washing it from all its grosser Particles, and laying a little  of this upon the Pitch, I ground it upon the Pitch with the concave  Copper, till it had done making a Noise; and then upon the Pitch I  ground the Object-Metal with a brisk motion, for about two or three  Minutes of time, leaning hard upon it. Then I put fresh Putty upon the  Pitch, and ground it again till it had done making a noise, and  afterwards ground the Object-Metal upon it as before. And this Work I  repeated till the Metal was polished, grinding it the last time with all  my strength for a good while together, and frequently breathing upon  the Pitch, to keep it moist without laying on any more fresh Putty. The  Object-Metal was two Inches broad, and about one third part of an Inch  thick, to keep it from bending. I had two of these Metals, and when I  had polished them both, I tried which was best, and ground the other  again, to see if I could make it better than that which I kept. And thus  by many Trials I learn'd the way of polishing, till I made those two  reflecting Perspectives I spake of above. For this Art of polishing will  be better learn'd by repeated Practice than by my Description. Before I  ground the Object-Metal on the Pitch, I always ground the Putty on it  with the concave Copper, till it had done making a noise, because if the  Particles of the Putty were not by this means made to stick fast in the  Pitch, they would by rolling up and down grate and fret the Object-Metal  and fill it full of little holes.    But because Metal is more difficult to polish than Glass, and is  afterwards very apt to be spoiled by tarnishing, and reflects not so  much Light as Glass quick-silver'd over does: I would propound to use  instead of the Metal, a Glass ground concave on the foreside, and as  much convex on the backside, and quick-silver'd over on the convex side.  The Glass must be every where of the same thickness exactly. Otherwise  it will make Objects look colour'd and indistinct. By such a Glass I  tried about five or six Years ago to make a reflecting Telescope of four  Feet in length to magnify about 150 times, and I satisfied my self that  there wants nothing but a good Artist to bring the Design to  perfection. For the Glass being wrought by one of our _London_ Artists  after such a manner as they grind Glasses for Telescopes, though it  seemed as well wrought as the Object-glasses use to be, yet when it was  quick-silver'd, the Reflexion discovered innumerable Inequalities all  over the Glass. And by reason of these Inequalities, Objects appeared  indistinct in this Instrument. For the Errors of reflected Rays caused  by any Inequality of the Glass, are about six times greater than the  Errors of refracted Rays caused by the like Inequalities. Yet by this  Experiment I satisfied my self that the Reflexion on the concave side of  the Glass, which I feared would disturb the Vision, did no sensible  prejudice to it, and by consequence that nothing is wanting to perfect  these Telescopes, but good Workmen who can grind and polish Glasses  truly spherical. An Object-glass of a fourteen Foot Telescope, made by  an Artificer at _London_, I once mended considerably, by grinding it on  Pitch with Putty, and leaning very easily on it in the grinding, lest  the Putty should scratch it. Whether this way may not do well enough for  polishing these reflecting Glasses, I have not yet tried. But he that  shall try either this or any other way of polishing which he may think  better, may do well to make his Glasses ready for polishing, by grinding  them without that Violence, wherewith our _London_ Workmen press their  Glasses in grinding. For by such violent pressure, Glasses are apt to  bend a little in the grinding, and such bending will certainly spoil  their Figure. To recommend therefore the consideration of these  reflecting Glasses to such Artists as are curious in figuring Glasses, I  shall describe this optical Instrument in the following Proposition.      _PROP._ VIII. PROB. II.    _To shorten Telescopes._    Let ABCD [in _Fig._ 29.] represent a Glass spherically concave on the  foreside AB, and as much convex on the backside CD, so that it be every  where of an equal thickness. Let it not be thicker on one side than on  the other, lest it make Objects appear colour'd and indistinct, and let  it be very truly wrought and quick-silver'd over on the backside; and  set in the Tube VXYZ which must be very black within. Let EFG represent  a Prism of Glass or Crystal placed near the other end of the Tube, in  the middle of it, by means of a handle of Brass or Iron FGK, to the end  of which made flat it is cemented. Let this Prism be rectangular at E,  and let the other two Angles at F and G be accurately equal to each  other, and by consequence equal to half right ones, and let the plane  sides FE and GE be square, and by consequence the third side FG a  rectangular Parallelogram, whose length is to its breadth in a  subduplicate proportion of two to one. Let it be so placed in the Tube,  that the Axis of the Speculum may pass through the middle of the square  side EF perpendicularly and by consequence through the middle of the  side FG at an Angle of 45 Degrees, and let the side EF be turned towards  the Speculum, and the distance of this Prism from the Speculum be such  that the Rays of the Light PQ, RS, &c. which are incident upon the  Speculum in Lines parallel to the Axis thereof, may enter the Prism at  the side EF, and be reflected by the side FG, and thence go out of it  through the side GE, to the Point T, which must be the common Focus of  the Speculum ABDC, and of a Plano-convex Eye-glass H, through which  those Rays must pass to the Eye. And let the Rays at their coming out of  the Glass pass through a small round hole, or aperture made in a little  plate of Lead, Brass, or Silver, wherewith the Glass is to be covered,  which hole must be no bigger than is necessary for Light enough to pass  through. For so it will render the Object distinct, the Plate in which  'tis made intercepting all the erroneous part of the Light which comes  from the verges of the Speculum AB. Such an Instrument well made, if it  be six Foot long, (reckoning the length from the Speculum to the Prism, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33527"],[0,"Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises of the Western North Atlantic (#15)"],[1,"around the mouth,  particularly near the corners, is white. The undersides of the flukes  and flippers vary in color through numerous shades of browns and  brownish grays.      Natural History Notes    Sperm whales may dive to depths in excess of 3,270 feet (996.7 m) for  periods of an hour or more. As do most whales upon surfacing from a deep  dive, sperm whales emit a single explosive blow and then, depending on  the length of the dive, may remain on the surface for over 10 min and  blow more than 50 times before beginning the next dive. Shorter periods  on the surface and fewer blows are more common. Females may dive and  remain on the surface for shorter periods of time than males. When  beginning a deep dive, sperm whales throw their broad triangular flukes,  dark on the undersides, high into the air.    Sperm whales may be found singly or in groups of up to 35 or 40  individuals. Older males are usually solitary except during the breeding  season. During the remainder of the year large groups may be bachelor  bulls (sexually inactive males) or nursery schools containing females  and juveniles of both sexes. Sperm whales are seldom found in less than  600 feet (182.9 m) of water.    Sperm whales feed primarily on squid but may occasionally also take  octopuses and a variety of fishes.      May Be Confused With    Because of their distinctive head shape and blow, sperm whales are  unlikely to be confused with any other species when they can be closely  examined. If only the back and tail flukes are seen, however, sperm  whales may somewhat resemble humpback whales. Both species arch the back  when beginning a dive, raising the fin or hump, and both throw the tail  flukes. The most distinctive differences between the two species are  tabularized on p. 40.    At sea the head of a sperm whale may also somewhat resemble that of an  adult male northern bottlenosed whale, but this latter species is  lighter brown in color, has a distinct beak and a prominent dorsal fin,  and is rarely found south of lat. 42 deg.N. In addition, the blowhole of the  northern bottlenosed whale is located well back on the head and not--as  in the sperm whale--on the front.      Distribution    Sperm whales are widely distributed in oceanic areas of the western  North Atlantic. They may be encountered from Venezuela north at least as  far as the Davis Straits, though they apparently avoid the polar ice  fields. Distribution and migrations vary between males and females.  Males range farther to the north, while females and immature males  remain between lat. 30 deg. and 50 deg.N. Both groups shift northward during  spring and summer and return to southern portions of their range in the  fall. Adult males arrive off the New England coast in August. Those  reaching the Newfoundland and Labrador coasts arrive from the deep sea,  perhaps following the slope contours, in August and September. Males are  abundant as far north as southeast Greenland and Iceland in summer. Some  animals remain as late as November, but the majority migrate south to  temperate or tropical waters in the early fall.    Historically the primary grounds in the western North Atlantic were  those in all the following areas: the Grand Banks just southeast of the  southern Grand Banks from lat. 30 deg. to 40 deg.N and long. 35 deg. to 55 deg.W, off  the Carolinas, around the Bahamas, around many of the West Indies, and  in the southwestern Caribbean.      Stranded Specimens    Stranded sperm whales should be easy to identify. The very narrow  underslung jaw contains from 18 to 25 functional teeth, which fit into  sockets in the upper jaw. The huge, distinctly box-shaped head and the  position of the single blowhole to the left front of the head are  unmistakable clues.

Description    Minke whales are the smallest baleen whale species in the northern  hemisphere, reaching maximum lengths of just over 30 feet (9.1 m). One  of the most distinctive features of this species is an extremely narrow,  pointed, distinctly triangular rostrum with a single head ridge, similar  to but much sharper than that of the fin whale (hence the common name  \"sharp-headed finner\"). Minke whales have a tall, falcate dorsal fin  located in the latter third of the back, in about the same position as  that of the sei whale, which often becomes visible simultaneously with  the low, usually inconspicuous blow.    Minke whales are black to dark gray on the back and white on the belly  and on the underside of the flippers. Portions of the underside of the  flukes may be steel bluish gray. They have a diagonal band of white on  each flipper, the extent and orientation of which varies individually.    Like the fin whale, minke whales (at least from the Pacific) sometimes  have a chevron on the back behind the head and often have two regions of  lightish-gray coloration on each side--one just above and behind the  flippers; another just in front of and below the dorsal fin. These  patches may be quite conspicuous on some animals, indetectable on  others. These markings may also be present on Atlantic specimens, though  they have not yet been documented. The baleen, which may be visible from  close range when the animal is feeding, is mostly yellowish white with  fine white bristles. The posterior plates (up to half) may be brown to  black.      Natural History Notes    Minke whales are frequently found as single animals, pairs, or trios,  though they may congregate in areas of food concentration in the  northern seas during the spring and summer. They are more likely to be  seen up close than their larger cousins--the blue, fin, and sei  whales--because they often closely approach boats, particularly  stationary boats, as if curious about them.    Minke whales may also approach very close to shore and often enter bays,  inlets, and estuaries.    Like fin whales, they often arch the tail stock high into the air when  beginning a long dive. However, they do not raise the flukes above the  surface when beginning a dive.    Minke whales feed primarily on small shoal fish (herring, cod, pollack,  and capelin).    Minkes sometimes breach, leaping completely clear of the water and  entering smoothly, head first, or with a substantial splash like  humpback whales.      May Be Confused With    When they are seen at relatively close range, minke whales can be  readily distinguished from the other rorquals that have relatively tall,  falcate dorsal fins (fin, sei, and Bryde's whales) by their considerably  smaller size and by their distinctive white band on each flipper.    At a distance, however, positive identification may be difficult. Minke  whales have a small, low, inconspicuous blow. Like sei whales, they  frequently expose the dorsal fin simultaneously with the blow, but minke"]]]
