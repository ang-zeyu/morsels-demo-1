A few might have been  switched out of the horses' tails in the stable yard or dropped on the  road, but what amazingly bright eyes the birds must have to find them,  and how curious that chippies alone, of all the feathered tribe,  should always insist upon using them to line their cradles!    From the back of a settle, the round of a rocking chair, or the gnomon  of the sun-dial near the verandah, the little chippy would trill his  wiry tremulo, like the locust's hot weather warning, while his mate  brooded over five tiny greenish-blue eggs in the boxwood tree. Before  even the robin was awake, earlier than dawn, he would start the  morning chorus with the simple little trill that answers for a song to  express every emotion throughout the long day. Both he and his mate  use a chip call note in talking to each other.    When she was tired brooding, of which she did far more than her share,  he would relieve her while she went in search of food. Very often he  would carry to the nest a cabbage worm for her or some other  refreshing delicacy. The screen door might bang beside her while she  sat {118} close upon her treasures without causing her to do more than  flutter an eyelid. Every member of the family parted the twigs of  boxwood that enclosed the nest to look upon her pretty little  reddish-brown head with a gray stripe over the eye and a dark-brown  line running apparently through it. All of us gently stroked her from  time to time. She would occasionally leave the nest for only a minute  or two to pick up the crumbs, chickweed, and canary seed scattered for  her about the verandah floor, and showed not the slightest fear when  we went on with our regular occupations. We were the breathlessly  excited ones, while she hopped calmly about our feet. The chippy is  wonderfully tame--perhaps the tamest bird that we have.    You may be sure there was joy in the household when the nest in the  boxwood contained baby chippies one morning--not a trace of eggshells  which had been carried away early. Insects were the only approved  baby-food and we were greatly astonished to see what large ones were  thrust down the tiny, gaping throats every few minutes. Instead of  flying straight to the nest, both parents would frequently stop to  rest or get proper direction on the back or the arm of a chair where  some one was sitting. In eight days the babies began to explore the  verandah. Then they left us suddenly without {119} a \"good-bye.\" No  guests whom we ever had beneath our roof left a more aching void than  that chipping sparrow family. How we hope they will find their way  back to the boxwood tree from the Gulf States next April!      TREE SPARROW    _Called also: Winter Chippy_    When the friendly little chippy leaves us in autumn, this similar but  larger sparrow cousin comes into the United States from the North, and  some people say they cannot tell the two birds apart or the field  sparrow from either of them. The tree sparrow, which, unlike the  chippy, has no black on his forehead, wears an indistinct black spot  on the centre of his breast where the chippy is plain gray, and the  field sparrow is buffy. The tree sparrow has a parti-coloured bill,  the upper-half black, the lower yellow with a black tip, while the  chippy has an entirely black bill, and the field sparrow a  flesh-coloured or pale-red one. Only the tree sparrow, which is larger  than either of the others, although only as large as a full grown  English sparrow, spends the winter in the Northern United States, and  by that time his confusing relatives are too far south for comparison.  It is in spring and autumn that their {120} ranges over-lap and there  is any possibility of confusion.    When the slate-coloured juncos come from their nesting grounds far  over the Canadian border, look also for flocks of tree sparrows in  fields and door yards, where crab grass, amaranth and fox tail grass,  among other pestiferous weeds, are most abundant. I do not know how  Professor Beal of the Department of Agriculture, arrived at his  conclusions, but he estimates that in a single state--Iowa--the tree  sparrows alone destroy eight hundred and seventy-five tons of noxious  weed seeds every winter. Then how incalculably great must be our debt  to the entire sparrow tribe!    Tree sparrows welcome other winter birds to their friendly flocks that  glean a comfortable living from the weed stalks protruding from the  snow. Their cheerful, soft, jingling notes have been likened by Mr.  Chapman to \"sparkling frost crystals turned to music.\"      WHITE-THROATED SPARROW    _Called also: Peabody-bird; Canada Sparrow_    \"What's in a name?\" Our English cousins over the border are quite sure  they hear this sparrow sing the praises of _Swee-e-et Can-a-da,  Can-a-da, Can-a-da-ah,_ while the {121} New Englanders think the bird  distinctly says, _I-I-Pea-body, Pea-bod-y, Pea-bod-y-I,_ extolling the  name of one of their first families. You may amuse yourself by fitting  whatever words you like to the well-marked metre of the clear,  high-pitched, plaintive, sweet song of twelve notes. Learn to imitate  it and you will be able to whistle up any white-throat within reach of  your voice in the Adirondacks, the White Mountains, or the deep, cool  woods of Maine, throughout the summer, although the majority of these  hardy sparrows nest on the northern side of the Canadian border. Our  hot weather they cannot abide. When there is a keen breath of frost in  the air and the hedgerows and thickets in the United States are taking  on glorious autumnal tints, listen for the white-throated migrants  conversing with sharp _chink_ call-notes that sound like the ring of a  marble-cutter's chisel.    During the autumn and spring migrations, when these birds are likely  to give us the semi-annual pleasure of coming closer about our homes,  with other members of their sociable tribe, you will see that the  white-throat is a slightly larger and more distinguished bird than the  English sparrow, and that he wears a white patch above his plain, gray  breast. Except the white-crowned sparrow, who wears a black and  white-striped soldier cap on his head, {122} and who sometimes travels  in migrating flocks with his cousins, the white-throated sparrow is  the handsomest member of his plain tribe.      FOX SPARROW    Do you imagine because he is called the fox sparrow that this bird has  four legs, or that he wears a brush instead of feathers for a tail, or  that he makes sly visits to the chicken yard after dark? When you see  his rusty, reddish-brown coat you guess that the foxy colour of it is  alone responsible for his name. His light breast is heavily streaked  and spotted with brown, somewhat like a thrush's, and as he is the  largest and reddest of the sparrows, it is not at all difficult to  identify him.    In the autumn, when the juncos come into the United States from  Canada, small flocks of their fox sparrow cousins, that have spent the  summer from the St. Lawrence region and Manitoba northward to Alaska,  may also be expected. They are often seen in the junco's company among  the damp thickets and weeds, along the roadsides and in stalky fields  bounded by woodland. The fox sparrow loves to scratch among the dead  leaves for insects trying to hide there, quite as well as if he were a  chicken or a towhee or an oven-bird who kick up the {123} leaves and  earth rubbish after his vigorous manner.    From Virginia southward, the people know the fox sparrow only as a  winter resident. Before he leaves them in the spring, he begins to  practise the clear, rich, ringing song, which fairly startles one with  pleasure the first time it is heard.      JUNCO    _Called also: Slate-coloured Snow-bird_    When the skies are leaden and the first flurries of snow warn us that  winter is near, flocks of juncos, that reflect the leaden skies on  their backs, and the grayish-white snow on their breasts, come from  the North to spend the winter. A few enter New England as early as  September, but by Thanksgiving increased numbers are foraging for  their dinner among the roadside thickets, in the furrows of ploughed  fields, on the ground near evergreens, about the barn-yard and even at  the dog's plate beyond the kitchen door.    Notice how abruptly the slate gray colour of the junco's mantle ends  in a straight line across his light breast, and how, when he flies  away, the white feathers on either side of his tail serve as signals  to his friends to follow. Such signals {124} are especially useful  when birds are migrating; without them, many stragglers from the  flocks might get lost. Juncos, who are extremely sociable birds,  except when nesting, need help in keeping together. A crisp, frosty  _'tsip_ call note signifies alarm and away flies the flock. They are  quiet, unassuming visitors, modest in manner and in dress; but how we  should miss them from the winter landscape!      SNOWFLAKE    In the northern United States and Canada, it is the snowflake or snow  bunting, a sparrowy little bird with a great deal of white among its  rusty brown feathers that is the familiar winter visitor. Instead of  hopping, like most of its tribe, it walks over the frozen fields and  rarely perches higher than a bush or fence rail, for it comes very  near being a ground bird. Delighting in icy blasts and snow storms,  flocks of these irrepressibly cheerful little foragers fatten on a  seed diet picked up where other birds would starve.      AMERICAN GOLDFINCH    _Called also: Black-winged Yellow-bird; Thistle Bird; Lettuce Bird;  Wild Canary._    Have you a garden gay with marigolds, sunflowers, coreopsis, zinnias,  cornflowers, and {125} gaillardias? If so, every goldfinch in your  neighbourhood knows it and hastens there to feed on the seeds of these  plants as fast as they form, so that you need expect to save "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38253"],[0,"A Description of the Coasts of East Africa and Malabar in the Beginning of the (#15)"],[1,"the coast  are other small places and seaports, likewise belonging to the  kingdom of Dacani, in which small vessels from Malabar enter to take  on board inferior rice and vegetables which are found there: and one  of them is called Arapatani, and another Munaryni.[157]      BANDA.    After leaving these places, about six leagues along the coast  southwards is a river, upon which is a town of Moors and Gentiles  called Banda, in which there are many merchants who trade on the  continent with the merchants whom the Malabars bring thither. And  many ships come there from many parts on account of its being a good  harbour, and there is a great exportation of goods and provisions  from the interior of the country. Many ships fill here with rice,  coarse millet, and other vegetables that are profitable to them; and  they bring to this place cocoa-nuts, pepper, and other spices and  drugs which have a good sale there, because thence they ship them  for Diu, Aden, and Ormuz. And leaving this place, between it and Goa  there is another river called Bardes, on which there are other towns  which are not of much trade.      GUOA.    Leaving these places, there are twenty leagues of coast southwards  as far as a cape, which must be doubled to enter Goa; and after that  ten leagues to the north-west, then ten more to the east, and  south-south-west twenty leagues, then seventeen leagues to the  north-west, as far as the Cape Rama. And in this gulf there are many  small islands, the chief of which is Goa. There is a large river  which issues by two branches into the sea, between which is formed  the island of the city of Goa, which belonged to the kingdom of  Decani, and was a lordship of itself along with other towns in the  neighbourhood; and the king gave it to a vassal of his, a great lord  called Vasabaxo, who was a very good knight, and on account of his  being very distinguished and skilful in warlike matters, this  lordship of Goa was given him, in order that he might carry on war  thence with the King of Narsinga, as he always did until his death.  This city then remained to his son, Sabaym Delcani, and it was  inhabited by many Moors, respectable men, and foreigners, white men  and rich merchants, and several of them are very good gentlemen.  There are also many great Gentile merchants, and others, gentlemen  and cultivators, and men-at-arms. It was a place of great trade in  merchandise. It has a very good port, to which flocked many ships  from Mekkah, Aden, Ormuz, Cambay, and the Malabar country. And the  before mentioned Sabaym Delcani resided much in this place, and he  kept there his captain and men-at-arms, and no one entered or went  out of this island and city, either by sea or by land, without his  permission; and all those who entered there were registered with all  their signs and particulars, and from whence they came; and so, with  this precaution and arrangement, they allowed them to return. This  town was very large, with goodly edifices and handsome streets and  squares, surrounded by walls and towers. There is a very good  fortress in it, and in the environs many gardens and orchards of  fine trees and fruits, and many pools of good water. There were many  mosques and houses of worship of the Gentiles. The country all round  was very fruitful and well cultivated, and enjoyed much produce both  from sea and land. This Sabaym, as soon as he knew that the  Portuguese viceroy had routed the Rumes[158] and the fleet of the  great sultan before Diu, immediately sent to call the Rumes,  knights, and other people of the sultan, who having escaped thence,  arrived, leaving their captain in the kingdom of Guzarat. And this  Sabaym Delcani received them very well, and determined on putting  all India at their disposition for their assistance, and to refit  them again with the aid of all the Moors and kings of India, in  order to again carry on war against the Portuguese. They then  collected together much money and began to build in this city of Goa  very large ships, and handsome galleys and brigantines, all after  the manner and fashion of ours, and likewise to prepare much  artillery of brass and iron, and all other munitions of maritime  war. And the Moors were so expeditious in this that they had got a  large part of the fleet made, and vast magazines of munitions for  the fleet; and they already went out with guard boats and rowing  galleys, to take the Sambuks which passed by, because they carried  Portuguese safe-conducts. And Alfonso de Albuquerque, who was then  captain-major in India, had information of all this, and determined  to go and seek them, and drive them from their design. He therefore  collected the most that he could of a fleet of ships, caravels, and  galleys, and with these entered the before mentioned river, and  attacked the city of Goa[159] and took it. Upon which many great  things occurred, which I say nothing about, in order not to be more  prolix. He captured many people, and all the ships and galleys of  the Rumes, and he burned some of them; and the city submitted to the  commands of the King of Portugal, as it now is. And he fortified it  with several castles. This city is inhabited by Portuguese, Moors  and Gentiles; and the fruits of the earth and provisions now produce  a yearly revenue to the King of Portugal of twenty thousand ducats,  without the port, which has much trade in merchandise of Malabar,  Cheul, Dabul, Cambay and Diu. They sell there many horses for other  parts, at two, three and four hundred ducats each, according to  their quality, and upon each the King of Portugal levies forty  ducats as duty; and although they pay less dues than in the time of  the Moors, this harbour produces much revenue to the King of  Portugal.[160]    In this kingdom of Decani there are many great cities, and many  other towns within the country inhabited by Moors and Gentiles. It  is a country very well cultivated, and abundantly supplied with  provisions, and it has an extensive commerce, which produces much  revenue to the king, who is called Mahamuza, and is a Moor; and he  lives very luxuriously, and with much pleasure, in a great city  inland, which is called Mavider. This king holds the whole of his  kingdom, divided amongst Moorish lords, to each one of whom he has  assigned cities, towns, and villages; and these lords govern and  rule, so that the king does not give any orders in his kingdom, nor  does he meddle except in giving himself a pleasant life and  amusement. And all these lords do obeisance to him, and bring him  the revenue, with which they have to come into his presence. And if  any one of them were to revolt or disobey, the others go against him  and destroy him, or reduce him again to obedience to the king. These  lords frequently have wars and differences among one another, and it  happens that some take villages from others; but afterwards the king  makes peace, and administers justice between them. Each one has many  horsemen, very good archers with the Turkish bow, white people, of  good figures. Their dress is of cotton stuffs, and they wear caps on  their heads. They give large pay to the soldiers: they speak Arabic,  Persian and the Decani language, which is the natural language of  the country. These Moorish lords take tents of cotton cloth into the  field, in which they dwell when going on a journey, or to war.    They ride a small saddle, and fight tied to their horses. They carry  in their hands very long light lances, with four-sided iron points,  very strong, and three palms in length. They wear tunics quilted  with cotton, which they call _laudes_, and some wear tunics of mail,  and their horses caparisoned; some carry iron maces and battle-axes,  two swords and a buckler, Turkish bows supplied with many arrows, so  that each man carries offensive weapons for two persons. Many of  these take their wives with them to the wars; they make use of pack  oxen, on which they carry their chattels when they travel. They are  frequently at war with the King of Narsinga, so that they are at  peace but for a short time. The Gentiles of this kingdom of Decani  are black, well made and courageous; most of them fight on foot, and  some on horseback: and these foot soldiers carry swords and shields,  bows and arrows, and are very good archers. Their bows are long,  after the fashion of Englishmen. They go naked from the waist  upwards, and wear small caps on their heads; they eat all meats  except cow; they are idolaters, when they die their bodies are  burned, and their wives burn themselves alive with them voluntarily,  as will be related further on.      CINTACOLA.    Seventeen leagues further along the same coast to the south-east,  and towards Malabar, there is another river called Aliga,[161] which  separates the kingdom of Decani from the kingdom of Narsinga, and at  the mouth of the river on the top of a hill is a fortress,  Cintacola;[162] and it belongs to the Zabayo, for the defence of his  country. In it he continually keeps horse and foot soldiers. Here  the said kingdom of Decani comes to an end at its southern portion,  and the northern part ends at Cheul; and from one place to the other  along the coast there are eighty leagues.      KINGDOM OF NARSINGA.    Beyond this river commences the kingdom of Narsinga, which contains  five very large provinces, with a language of their own. One  province is along the coast, and is called Tulinat; another has the  name of Legni, which confines with the kingdom of Tisa; another is  Canari, in which is the great city of Visenagar,[163] and the other  is Chomendel,[164] a kingdom which they call Tamul. This kingdom of  Narsinga is very rich and well supplied with provisions, and is very  full of cities and large townships; and all the country is very  fertile and brought into cultivation. The province of Tulinat  contains many rivers and seaports, in which there is much trade and  shipping bound"]]]
