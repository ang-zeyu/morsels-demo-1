If the last generation had witnessed the conveyance of news from  London to Paris, in an instant, while they knew nothing of the late  invention of the electric telegraph, they would have testified, in all  candour, and with the utmost assurance, that a miracle had been  performed, in open violation of the well known laws of nature, and  contrary to all human knowledge of cause and effect.    But, once familiar with the arts of the living age, all those miracles  cease to be such, and the laws of nature, and of cause and effect, are  found to be still moving, unimpaired, in all the harmony of primeval  existence and operation.    The same views will apply, with equal force, to all the spiritual  phenomena of the universe.    The terms _miracle_ and _mystery_ must become obsolete, and finally  disappear from the vocabulary of intelligences, as they advance in the  higher spheres of intellectual consistency. Even now they should be  used only in a relative or limited sense, as applicable to those  things which are not yet within reach of our powers, or means of  comprehension.    We will here remind the student of two principles, or laws of  existence, developed in a former chapter of this work, which will  account for all the miraculous powers of the universe--all the mighty  works ever manifested by God, or by His servants.    First. All the elements of the material universe are eternal.    Second. There is a divine substance, fluid or essence, called Spirit,  widely diffused among these eternal elements.    This spiritual substance is the most refined, subtle, and powerful  element in the universe. It is endowed with all wisdom, all knowledge,  all intelligence and power. In short, it is the light, life, power and  principle of all things, by which they move; and of all intelligences,  by which they think.    This divine element, or Spirit, is the immediate, active, or  controlling agent, in all holy, miraculous powers.    Angels, and all holy men, perform all their miracles, simply, to use a  modern magnetic term, by being in \"_communication_\" with this divine  substance. Two beings, or two millions--any number thus placed in  \"_communication_\"--all possess one mind. The mind of the one is the  mind of the other, the will of the one is the will of the other, the  word of the one is the word of the other. And the holy fluid, or  Spirit, being in communication with them all, goes forth to control  the elements, and to execute all their mandates which are legally  issued, and in accordance with the mind and wisdom of the Great  Eloheim.    God the Father is the Head. The mandates of Jesus Christ must be in  the name of the Father.    The mandates of angels, or of holy men, in order to be legal, or of  due force and power, must be issued in the name of Jesus Christ, or of  the three who compose the Head Council; and must be in accordance with  their united mind and will. The Holy Spirit then goes forth and  executes their mandates. This agency being _invisible_, and the effect  _visible_, the act performed appears to those who are unacquainted  with spiritual agency, as a miracle, or an _effect_ without a _cause_.    When Jesus Christ was clothed upon with a mortal tabernacle, he had  not the fulness of this divine substance at the first, but grew and  increased in the same, till, being raised from the dead, he received a  fulness and, therefore, had all power, in heaven and on earth.    His Apostles received a portion of this Spirit, but not a fulness,  while they were mortal; therefore, they could know and perform some  things, but not all.    The members of the Church also partook of this Spirit, through the  ministry of the Apostles, by which miraculous gifts were imparted unto  them, some to one, and some to another: some to speak in tongues; some  to interpret, or translate from one language into another; some to  prophesy, see visions, or converse with angels; and others to control,  or cast out devils, or heal the sick; and others, again, to teach and  edify the Church, or the world, by the word of wisdom, and by the word  of knowledge.    All these gifts and miracles were the workings of that one, and the  self same Spirit given to the members of the Church of the Saints,  while the world did not partake of a sufficient measure of the Spirit  to possess these gifts. The reason of this is, that they did not  repent, and believe in Jesus Christ, and be baptized in his name, and  receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, by the laying on of the hands of  the Priesthood--these duties and ordinances, being the legal or  appointed channel by which the gift of the Holy Spirit was imparted.  The reason why these gifts of the Spirit have not been enjoyed in all  ages of the so called \"_Christian Church_\" is because it is not the  true Church; nor, is the true ministry or Apostleship to be found  among the Church, or Churches, where these gifts are denied. Every  minister and member of such institutions have need to repent, and be  baptized, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins; and to  receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, by the laying on of hands of  those who have authority, in order to enter into the kingdom of God.    These ordinances, ministered by a legal Priesthood, being divinely  appointed, are the only legitimate means by which man may receive and  exercise these divine powers; or, in other words, they are the means  ordained of God, by which one being may communicate or impart a  portion of this divine substance to another, so as to place that other  in communication with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and with  angels, and the spirits of just men in the world of spirits, and with  the members of the true Church on the earth.    To heal a person by the touch, or by the laying on of hands in the  name of Jesus Christ, or to impart the Holy Spirit by the laying on of  hands, is as much in accordance with the laws of nature, as for water  to seek its own level, an apple to fall to the ground when loosened  from the tree where it grew, quicksilver to attract its own  affinities, or the magnet to obey its own laws.    As the electric fluid obeys its own laws upon the wire, so, also, does  the spiritual or holy fluid convey itself, through certain channels,  from one body to another, in accordance with certain legitimate laws.    The usual channel for all spiritual fluids, whether holy or impure, in  their operations upon the human system, or in their passage from one  animal body to another, is the nerves.    A person commissioned of Jesus Christ, and filled with this spiritual  substance, can impart of the same to another, provided there is a  preparation of heart, and faith on the part of the receiver. Or if, as  in cases of healing, casting out devils, &c., it happens that the  receiver has no command of his own mind--as in cases of little  children, persons swooned, fainted, deranged, or dead, then the faith  of the administrator alone, or in connexion with other friends and  agents, in his behalf, is sufficient, in many cases, to perform the  work.    However, the touch, or laying on of hands, is not the only means of  communicating the gift of healing. A word spoken, a mandate issued, or  even a handkerchief, apron, or other garment, worn or touched by a  person full of this Spirit, and conveyed to another, has, according to  sacred history, and also the experience of the present age, proved  sufficient to communicate the spiritual fluid, between minds of strong  and mutual faith. So well acquainted was the Prophet Elisha with this  principle, that he sent his servant to lay his staff upon a dead  child, in order to raise it from the dead; but, in this instance, the  undertaking failed. The Prophet could only resuscitate the child by  placing face on face, eye to eye, mouth to mouth, hand to hand, &c.,  so as to give the greatest possible effect to the imparting of the  spirit of life.    For the holy and divine fluid, or spiritual element, to control all  other elements, agreeable to its own will, and the will of others, who  are in communication or in perfect unison with itself, is just as  natural as for the greater to control the less, or the strong the  weak. It is upon the same principle that a higher intelligence is able  to comprehend, circumscribe, and instruct that which is less.    Hence, when the worlds were framed, God spake, and this divine fluid  went forth and executed the mandate, by controlling the elements, in  accordance with the will, pattern, or design, formed in the mind of  Him that spake, and it that executed. Wisdom pondered the pattern of  all created things, weighed their properties, attributes and uses in  the balance of mature intellect. Every minute portion and member of  the several departments of life and being, every adaptation to their  natural use, was clearly conceived, formed in the mind, and matured,  ere the mandate was issued. And the whole was executed in exact  accordance with the pattern matured in the Divine Mind.    By this divine Spirit all things were designed and formed. By this  divine Substance all things live, move, and have a being. By this  agency Moses controlled the sea; Joshua, the motions of the earth;  Daniel, the mouths of the lions; and his brethren, the flames. By  this, the heavens were opened, and were shut; the rain or the dearth  prevailed; armies were subdued; the sick healed, or the dead raised;  and all in accordance with the laws of nature, it being perfectly  natural for the subordinate elements to obey the supreme, all  controlling, all pervading element, which contains in itself the  innate, and inalienable, controlling power.

By combining the above  observations upon the development of the Hydroids of the Melicertum  and Tima with those previously mentioned upon the young Medusa arising  from reproductive calycles in the Eucope and Clytia, we get a complete  picture of all the changes through which any one of these Hydroid  Medusae passes, from its Hydroid condition to the moment when it enters  upon an independent existence as a free Jelly-fish.        [Illustration: Fig. 81. Planula of Melicertum; magnified.]        [Illustration: Fig. 82. Cluster of planulae just attached to the      ground.]        [Illustration: Fig. 83. Young Hydrarium developed from planulae;      magnified.]      (_Laomedea amphora_ AG.)    The Medusae of the Campanularians are not all free. On the contrary, in  many of the species they always remain attached to the Hydroid, never  attaining so high a development as the free Medusae, and withering on  the stem after having laid their eggs. Such is the _Laomedea amphora_,  quite common on all the bridges connecting Boston with the country,  where, on account of the large amount of food brought down from the  sewers by the river, they thrive wonderfully, growing to a great size,  sometimes measuring from a foot to eighteen inches in height.      _Sertularians_.        [Illustration: Fig. 84. Colony of Dynamena pumila; natural size.]        [Illustration: Fig. 85. Magnified portion of Fig. 84.]    The Sertularians form another group of Hydroids closely allied to the  Campanularians, though differing from them in the arrangement of the  sterile Hydrae upon the stem. Among these one of the most numerous is  the Dynamena (_Dynamena pumila_ Lamx., Fig. 84), which hangs its  yellowish fringes from almost every sea-weed above low-water-mark. It  is especially thick and luxuriant on the fronds of our common _Fucus  vesiculosus_. The color is usually of a pale yellow, though sometimes  it is nearly white, and when first taken from the water it has a  glittering look, such as a white frost leaves on a spray of grass.  Fig. 84 represents such a cluster in natural size, while Fig. 85 shows  a piece of the stem highly magnified, with a reproductive calycle  attached to the side of a sterile Hydra stem. Many of these  Sertularian Hydroids assume the most graceful forms, hanging like long  pendent streamers from the Laminaria, or in other instances resembling  miniature trees. One of these tree-like Sertularians (_Dyphasia  rosacea_ Ag.), abundant on all rocks in sheltered places immediately  below low-water-mark, is represented in Fig. 86. In both these  Sertularians the Medusae wither on the stock, never becoming free. The  free Medusae of the Sertularians are only known in their adult  condition in a single genus, which is closely allied to Melicertum,  and which is produced from a Hydroid genus called Lafoea. Fig. 87  represents one of these young Sertularian Medusae (_Lafoea cornuta_  Lamx.).        [Illustration: Fig. 86. Dyphasia rosacea, natural size.]        [Illustration: Fig. 87. Medusa of Lafoea.]      _Tubularians_.    In the Sertularian and Campanularian Hydroids we have found that the  communities consist generally of a large number of small individuals,  so small, indeed, that it is hardly possible at first glance to  distinguish the separate members of these miniature societies. Among  the Tubularians, on the contrary, the communities are usually composed  of a small number of comparatively large individuals; and indeed these  Hydroids may even grow singly, as in the case of the Hybocodon (Fig.  104), which attains several inches in height. There is also another  general feature in which the Tubularians differ from both the other  groups of Hydroids. In the latter, the horny sheath which encloses the  stem extends to form a protecting calycle around the Hydra heads. This  protecting calycle is wanting round the heads of the Tubularians,  though their stems are surrounded by a sheath.      _Sarsia_. (_Coryne mirabilis_ AG.)        [Illustration: Fig. 88. Colony of Coryne; natural size.      (_Agassiz_.)]        [Illustration: Fig. 89. Magnified head of Coryne; _a_ stem, _t_      tentacles, _o_ mouth, _v_ body, _d_ Medusa. (Agassiz.)]        [Illustration: Fig. 90. Free Medusa of Coryne. (_Agassiz_.)]    Among the most common of our Tubularians is a small, mossy Hydroid  (Fig. 88), covering the rocks between tides, in patches of several  feet in diameter. Fig. 89 represents a single head from this little  mossy tuft greatly magnified, in which is seen the medusa bud arising  from the stem by the process already described in the other Hydroids.  In Fig. 90 we have the little Jelly-fish in its adult condition, about  the size of a small walnut, with a wide circular opening, through  which passes the long proboscis, hanging from the under surface of the  disk to a considerable distance below its margin. The four tentacles  are of an immense length when compared to the size of the animal. As a  general thing, the tentacles are less numerous in the Tubularian  Medusae than in those arising from other Hydroids; they want also the  singular limestone concretions found at the base of the tentacles in  the Campanularian Medusae. In Fig. 91 we have one of the Tubularian  Medusae (_Turris vesicaria_ A. Ag.) which lifts a rather larger number  of tentacles than is usual among these Jelly-fishes. We never find the  tentacles multiplying almost indefinitely in them, as in Zygodactyla  and Eucope. The little Jelly-fish described above is known as Sarsia,  while its Hydroid is called Coryne. These names having been given to  the separate phases of its existence before their connection was  understood, and when they were supposed to represent two distinct  animals. They are especially interesting with reference to the history  of Hydroids in general, because they were among the first of these  animals in whom the true relation between the different phases of  their existence was discovered. Lesson named the Sarsia after the  great Norwegian naturalist, Sars, to whom we owe so large a part of  what is at present known respecting this curious subject of alternate  generations.        [Illustration: Fig. 91. Turris vesicaria; natural size.]      _Bougainvillia_. (_Bougainvillia superciliaris_ AG.)    The Bougainvillia (Fig. 92), is one of our most common Jelly-fishes,  frequenting our wharves as well as our sea-shore during the spring. The  tentacles are arranged in four bunches or clusters at the junction of  the radiating tubes with the circular tube, from which they may be seen  extending in every direction whenever these animals remain quietly  suspended in the water,--a favorite attitude with them, and one which  they retain sometimes for days, seeming to make no effort beyond that of  gently playing their tentacles to and fro (Fig. 92). These tentacles are  capable of immense extension, sometimes to ten or fifteen times the  diameter of the bell. The proboscis is not simple as in the Sarsia, but  looks like a yellow urn suspended at its four corners from the  chymiferous tubes. The oral opening is entirely concealed by clusters of  shorter tentacles surrounding the mouth in a close wreath, on which the  eggs are supported. A highly magnified branch of the Hydroid stock from  which this Medusa arises is represented in Fig. 93. There we see the  little Jelly-fishes in different degrees of development on the stem,  while in Figs. 94-97 they are given separately and still more enlarged.  In Fig. 94 the outline of the Jelly-fish is still oval, the proboscis is  but just formed, and the tentacles appear only as round swellings or  knobs. In Fig. 95 a depression has taken place at the upper end,  presently to be an opening, the proboscis is enlarged, and the tentacles  lengthened, but still turned inward. In Fig. 96 the appendages of the  proboscis are quite conspicuous, the tentacles are turned outward, and  the Jelly-fish is almost ready to break from its attachment, having  assumed its ultimate outline. Fig. 97 represents it just after it has  separated from the stem, when it has only two tentacles at each cluster  and simple knobs around the mouth, instead of the complicated branching  tentacles of the adult.        [Illustration: Fig. 92. Bougainvillia; magnified.]        [Illustration: Fig. 93. Hydrarium of Bougainvillia; magnified.]        [Illustration: Figs. 94, 95, 96. Medusae buds of Fig. 93, in      different degrees of development.]        [Illustration: Fig. 97. Young Medusa just freed from the Hydroid;      magnified.]      _Tubularia_. (_Tubularia Couthouyi_ AG.)    There are several other Tubularians common in our waters which should  not be passed over without mention, although as this little book is by  no means intended as a complete text-book, but rather as a volume of  hints for amateur collectors, we would avoid as much as possible  encumbering it with many names, or with descriptions already given in  more comprehensive works. This Tubularia is interesting, however, from  the fact that the Medusae buds are never freed from the stem, and do  not develop into full-grown Jelly-fishes, but always remain abortive.  Fig. 98 represents one head of such a Hydroid with the Medusae buds  pendent from it in a thick cluster, while in Fig. 99 we have a few of  them sufficiently magnified to show that, though presenting the four  chymiferous tubes, they are otherwise exceedingly simple in structure,  as compared with the free Jelly-fishes.        [Illustration: Fig. 98. Tubularia; magnified. (_Agassiz_.)]        [Illustration: Fig. 99. Part of cluster of Medusae of Fig. 98;      magnified. (_Agassiz_.)]      _Hydractinia_. (_Hydractinia polyclina_ AG.)    This is another Tubularian, covering the surface of rocks in  tide-pools, or attaching itself upon shells inhabited by hermit crabs.  Indeed it was upon these shells that the"]]]
