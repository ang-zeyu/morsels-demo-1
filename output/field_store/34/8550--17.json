One of the handles has been planed down, and is wrapped with  sinew.    The handle of another implement, used in cleaning out grains of wood  from a hole being drilled in wood, is also a piece of antler.    A woman's knife, or _ooloo_, has a section of antler for a handle.    Strands of beads, used either for an ear pendant or for ornaments at the  peak of a hood, have a caribou incisor fastened at the tip. The opposite  end of the pendant is provided with a thin strip of caribou hide for  fastening to a perforated ear lobe.    The willow stems of pipes are wrapped with back sinew.    Antler and sinew went into the making (by Anoteelik) of a \"ring and pin\"  game.      _References on relations to Eskimos and Indians._--Isham, 1949    (1743): 152-154; Dobbs, 1744: 19; Hearne, 1795: 35, 78, 80-84,    96, 119, 195-197, 297, 316-319, 321-325; Franklin, 1823:    243-244; Lyon, 1824: 119, 123, 130, 144, 198, 229, 238, 241,    282, 311-317, 324, 327, 336; Parry, 1824: 289, 380, 403,    494-497, 505, 508, 512, 537; Richardson, \"1825\": 330, 331;    Franklin and Richardson, 1828: 200, 275; Richardson, 1829:    242-244, 245-249; John Ross, 1835a: 243-244, 252, 352, 512,    537; J. C.

Since they do not normally venture to an  appreciable distance into the Barren Grounds, their contacts with  Caribou are mainly in the forested zone. For an untold period in the  past there has been a very interesting tripartite relationship between  Bears, Caribou, and Caribou-eater Chipewyans about the south end of  Nueltin Lake. For information concerning it I am indebted to Charles  Schweder. The Indians of that area have been in the habit of killing  large numbers of Caribou, especially on the spring and fall migrations,  and leaving many of the bodies, or parts of the bodies, out in the  \"bush.\" The Bears have become accustomed to taking advantage of the  situation, especially, perhaps, in the matter of fattening up for  hibernation. This probably resulted in a certain concentration of the  animals thereabouts. But of late years the local native population has  seriously declined by reason of fatal illness and removal to other  parts. Consequently, as Charles Schweder expressed it, there are no  longer enough people there to feed the Bears! Three of the Chipewyans  reported in late October, 1947, that they had lost a good many of their  Caribou to the Bears during that season.    This recent change in the food situation about the south end of Nueltin  Lake has apparently resulted in, or at least coincided with, an influx  of Bears in the Windy River area, where they were unknown until 1944.  During the next four years seven Bears were killed locally. The animals  are said to have consumed about 70 Caribou bodies in the fall of 1944,  and about 40 in the fall of 1947 within a few miles of the Windy River  post; thus they became a somewhat serious factor in the human economy of  the area. The Caribou is evidently the chief loser in this curious  relationship, but even the Bear, which may be regarded as the chief  beneficiary, suffers from man's retaliatory efforts.      _Relations to foxes_    The demand for Arctic Fox furs on the part of the fashionable women of  the world sends the trapper on his winter rounds over the bleak and  bitter Barren Grounds, where he depends upon his autumn kill of Caribou  for sustenance for himself and his dogs as well as for fox bait. It is  thus quite obvious where a large share of the responsibility for the  dwindling numbers of the Caribou lies.    Both Arctic and Red Foxes (_Alopex lagopus innuitus_ and _Vulpes fulva_  subsp.) are among the scavengers that help to consume caribou bodies  that are left unguarded in the wilds. According to Charles Schweder,  foxes of both species seem to follow the Wolves, presumably in the hope  of securing the leavings of their kills.    Charles also gave me an account of a remarkable sort of play between a  Red Fox and a small buck Caribou. He had witnessed it in September,  1943, about 18 miles north of Windy River, from a distance of half a  mile. The Fox would approach the Caribou closely; the latter would then  walk up to the Fox, which would retreat, not allowing the Caribou to  come close enough to touch it. Neither animal was afraid of the other.  They kept up this performance for about 5 minutes. The Fox then went  among some bushes, where the Caribou tried to follow it. The larger  animal was still there, feeding, when Charles passed on out of sight. He  regarded the whole performance as a matter of playfulness. His recital  put me in mind at once of a slightly similar play between a Newfoundland  Caribou and a Red Fox, as recorded by Millais (1907: 302-303).  Stefánsson (1921: 623-624) describes a game of tag between an Arctic Fox  and several yearlings of _Rangifer pearyi_ on Melville Island.      _References._--Blanchet, 1925: 34; Birket-Smith, 1929(1): 101;    Critchell-Bullock, 1930: 143; Munn, 1932: 278; Ingstad, 1933:    90, 157-159; Freuchen, 1935: 128; Banfield, 1951a: 36.      _Relations to Wolves_    Aside from man, the principal predatory enemy of the Barren Ground  Caribou is undoubtedly the Wolf. A comparison of a distributional map of  Caribou by Banfield (1949: 479, fig. 1) with a distributional map of  Wolves by Goldman (1944: 414, fig. 14) indicates that the latter species  is a considerably more plastic animal. No less than six subspecies of  Wolves seem to occur in parts of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33767"],[0,"Campward Ho! A Manual for Girl Scout Camps (#15)"],[1,"of it as anything which pertains to the  woods or forests and as a turning away from the more artificial side of  camping, and as in pioneer times learning to do everything ourselves,  which is after all the keynote of real joy in camping.    [Illustration: THE LEAN-TO GOING UP]    To acquaint ourselves with the woods we can begin with our immediate  surroundings. Short walks to search for flowers or ferns and to know the  different varieties of trees, or early morning trips to a bit of swamp  land where we can study the coloring and habits of birds or sit quietly  while patiently listening to distinguish them by their songs.    We can lie out on the grass when the stars have come out, and study the  heavens or take trips at night with an experienced woodsman, who perhaps  shows us that Nature by night is very often different from Nature by  day, or of how we can find a trail through a dense wood by the light of  a star--the North Star.    Woodcraft includes what we may merely for convenience classify as  campcraft, which is to know all there is to know about camping in the  open.    For most purposes a good knowledge of how to make out-door fires; (both  from the standpoint of heat and the kind of food to be cooked) cooking;  trailing; and how to make and break a camp, are sufficient.    Beginners in this lore would do well to get a thorough knowledge of  campcraft by going about it one step at a time. For instance, it is  advisable to confine oneself to short trips at first and learn about the  sensing of directions, trail cutting and blazing, cooking, pitching  tents or building lean-tos; thus taking the various branches which are  preparatory to the actual experience and real adventure of a camping-out  party, and it is then and there that our real knowledge is tested.    The topics to be considered either when learning about campcraft or when  actually doing it, are briefly:      1. _Trip Planning_        Use of maps        Provisions        Clothing        Railroad connections      2. _Trail Making_        Survey for trail        Blazing trail        Cutting a trail      3. _Selection of Camp Site_        Location as to supply of fuel, water and fairly high,            well-drained land.        Shelters, tents or lean-tos        Bed-making    [Illustration: The complete lean-to, showing fire place, wood pile and  table to right. Cache is in back.]      4. _Camp Discipline_        Working squad        Toilet facilities        Exploration parties    The basis for quite a comprehensive knowledge of woodcraft in all its  branches, camping and Nature Study, is to be found in the Girl Scout  Handbook, \"Scouting for Girls.\"      3. ENTERTAINMENTS AND DIVERSIONS    Entertainments or shows of which there are an overwhelming variety are a  great aid in keeping everyone in a cheerful frame of mind.    In the dramatic line we have the play, pantomime, vaudeville, minstrel,  \"take offs,\" charades, the circus and dramatization of stories.    With musical talent in a camp it adds much zest to form an orchestra and  then there is the possibility of musical evenings and concerts. Added to  these are the Stunt Parties, Dances and Masquerades, Marshmallow and  Corn Roasts, and if it is a seashore camp, the clam bake.    The play requires an amount of preparation and time not always to be  spared in a camp unless the season is long. The most enjoyable shows are  bound to be the more spontaneous expressions in the form of impromptu  affairs.    There are celebrations which take place on particular days such as the  Fourth of July or any other event which you wish to commemorate, just as  the pageant can be presented to display your camping or community  activities.    One of the finest things to cultivate if you are in close proximity to  other camps is an inter-camp relationship, either in the forms of  inter-camp contests or frolics, or any demonstration which you think  betokens friendship. This may even go so far as the building of  inter-camp shacks and the making of inter-camp trails.    It is not only illuminating to come into contact with another camp  besides your own--it is a source of great diversion and enjoyment, if  there is plenty of fun and friendship, and an absence of group jealousy.      4. CAMP SINGS    Singing is a great and important part of camp life, for it reflects  every phase and meets all the situations of that life.    Songs are generally composed by the individual or by groups, being the  expression of their feelings, or results of their experience in camp.  The songs are quickly adopted by the camp as a whole because people like  to sing their own songs, especially songs about fresh, actual  happenings.    Some of the songs which reflect universal experience live on through the  years and become traditional, while others drop out and are never heard  of again. The following are Girl Scout Songs that have weathered more or  less satisfactorily.      THE VICTORY GIRLS    (_Tune_: \"K-K-Katy\")              G-G-G-Girl Scouts!            You Victory Girl Scouts!            You're the only Victory Girls that get our votes.            And when you march by,            Under your troop flags,            We'll be cheering for your K-K-K-Khaki coats!      MARCHING SONG    (_Tune_: \"Where Do We Go from Here, Boys?\")        Where do we go from here, girls, where do we go from here?      Anywhere (our Captain[B]) leads we'll follow, never fear.      The world is full of dandy girls, but wait till we appear--Then!      Girl Scouts, Girl Scouts, give us a hearty cheer!    [B] Supply Captain's name.      WE'RE COMING!    (_Tune_: \"Old Black Joe\")    Camping Song    I.        Come where the lake lies gleaming in the sun,      Come where the days are filled with work and fun,      Come where the moon hangs out her evening lamp,      The Scouts are trooping, trooping, trooping, back to Camp.        CHORUS:        We're coming! We're coming! to the lakes, the hills, the sea.      Old Mother Nature calls her children--you and me!        II.        Come where we learn the wisdom of the wood,      Come where we prove that simple things are good,      Come where we pledge allegiance to our land,      America! you've called your daughters--here we stand.        CHORUS:        We're coming! We're coming, till we spread from sea to sea,      Our country needs us--wants us--calls us--you and me!      RALLY SONG    (_Tune_: \"Smiles\")              There are girls that make you gloomy,              There are girls that make you gay,            There are girls forever hanging backward,              There are girls who like to lead the way,            But that girl that's always at \"attention!\"              That her Country cannot do without,            That we know the world can always count on--              She is my girl--the good Girl Scout.      THE LONG, LONG LINE    (_Tune_: \"The Long, Long Trail\")    Recruiting Song        Do you feel a little lonely?      Are your friends too few?      Would you like to join some jolly girls      In the things you think and do?      Don't you know your Country's waiting?      Have you heard her call?      See, the Scouts are crowding, crowding in,      Where there's room for one and all!        CHORUS:        There's a long, long line a-growing,      From north to south, east to west,      There's a place a-waiting in it, too, that you'll fill best!      We are sure you'd like to join us      If you knew what we can do,      And we'd like, O how we'd like, to make a good Girl Scout of you!      CLIMB ALONG!    (_Tune_: \"Joan of Arc\")    _Golden Eaglet Song_      Some girls are working, some girls are shirking,    Some girls are too scared to try,    Pluck up your grit, girls, use all your wit, girls,    See where the Gold Eaglets fly!    Watch them up above there, circling in the blue,    Earn them--and they'll fly to you!      CHORUS:      Climb along! Climb along! with a cheer and a smile and a song!    Though it seems an awful lot to do,    Other Scouts made good--and so can you!    Climb along! Climb along! and you'll surely put it through.    Then lead your troop to Victory--for the Eaglets are calling you!      TENDERFOOT SONG    (_Tune_: \"When You Come Back\")              When I'm a Scout--and I _am_ a Scout,            I'll make the other girls jump and look out!            And as I get on, I surely will pass            Like a bright lass to the Scout's Second Class.            And when I've a First Class up on my sleeve,            Oh, it's the proud girl I shall be! (Hurrah!)            When I'm a Scout--and I _am_ a Scout,            There's a big job waiting for me!      ORGANIZING SONG    (_Tune_: \"A Hot Time in the Old Town\")        Come along, girls, get ready, let us form our patrol,      Let us choose a dandy Captain who will make the Scouts enroll,      All around us they are joining, and we can't be left behind,      Get your friends all together--see how many you can find!

Take all you need upon your own strong back,            Wander where you like.            Leave the roads to motor cars,            The side walks to the bike--_but_"]]]
