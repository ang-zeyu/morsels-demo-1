Sometimes, namely in the case of transparent things, we find that there  is a tangible object in a touch-place without there being any visible  object in the corresponding sight-place. But in such a case as that of  the blue spectacles, we find that whatever object is visible beyond the  empty sight-place in the same line of sight has a different colour from  what it has when there is no tangible object in the intervening  touch-place; and as we move the tangible object in touch-space, the blue  patch moves in sight-space. If now we find a blue patch moving in this  way in sight-space, when we have no sensible experience of an  intervening tangible object, we nevertheless infer that, if we put our  hand at a certain place in touch-space, we should experience a certain  touch-sensation. If we are to avoid non-sensible objects, this must be  taken as the whole of our meaning when we say that the blue spectacles  are in a certain place, though we have not touched them, and have only  seen other things rendered blue by their interposition.    I think it may be laid down quite generally that, _in so far_ as physics  or common sense is verifiable, it must be capable of interpretation in  terms of actual sense-data alone. The reason for this is simple.  Verification consists always in the occurrence of an expected  sense-datum. Astronomers tell us there will be an eclipse of the moon:  we look at the moon, and find the earth's shadow biting into it, that is  to say, we see an appearance quite different from that of the usual full  moon. Now if an expected sense-datum constitutes a verification, what  was asserted must have been about sense-data; or, at any rate, if part  of what was asserted was not about sense-data, then only the other part  has been verified. There is in fact a certain regularity or conformity  to law about the occurrence of sense-data, but the sense-data that occur  at one time are often causally connected with those that occur at quite  other times, and not, or at least not very closely, with those that  occur at neighbouring times. If I look at the moon and immediately  afterwards hear a train coming, there is no very close causal connection  between my two sense-data; but if I look at the moon on two nights a  week apart, there is a very close causal connection between the two  sense-data. The simplest, or at least the easiest, statement of the  connection is obtained by imagining a \"real\" moon which goes on whether  I look at it or not, providing a series of _possible_ sense-data of  which only those are actual which belong to moments when I choose to  look at the moon.    But the degree of verification obtainable in this way is very small. It  must be remembered that, at our present level of doubt, we are not at  liberty to accept testimony. When we hear certain noises, which are  those we should utter if we wished to express a certain thought, we  assume that that thought, or one very like it, has been in another mind,  and has given rise to the expression which we hear. If at the same time  we see a body resembling our own, moving its lips as we move ours when  we speak, we cannot resist the belief that it is alive, and that the  feelings inside it continue when we are not looking at it. When we see  our friend drop a weight upon his toe, and hear him say--what we should  say in similar circumstances, the phenomena _can_ no doubt be explained  without assuming that he is anything but a series of shapes and noises  seen and heard by us, but practically no man is so infected with  philosophy as not to be quite certain that his friend has felt the same  kind of pain as he himself would feel. We will consider the legitimacy  of this belief presently; for the moment, I only wish to point out that  it needs the same kind of justification as our belief that the moon  exists when we do not see it, and that, without it, testimony heard or  read is reduced to noises and shapes, and cannot be regarded as evidence  of the facts which it reports. The verification of physics which is  possible at our present level is, therefore, only that degree of  verification which is possible by one man's unaided observations, which  will not carry us very far towards the establishment of a whole science.    Before proceeding further, let us summarise the argument so far as it  has gone. The problem is: \"Can the existence of anything other than our  own hard data be inferred from these data?\" It is a mistake to state the  problem in the form: \"Can we know of the existence of anything other  than ourselves and our states?\" or: \"Can we know of the existence of  anything independent of ourselves?\" because of the extreme difficulty of  defining \"self\" and \"independent\" precisely. The felt passivity of  sensation is irrelevant, since, even if it proved anything, it could  only prove that sensations are caused by sensible objects. The natural  _naive_ belief is that things seen persist, when unseen, exactly or  approximately as they appeared when seen; but this belief tends to be  dispelled by the fact that what common sense regards as the appearance  of one object changes with what common sense regards as changes in the  point of view and in the intervening medium, including in the latter our  own sense-organs and nerves and brain. This fact, as just stated,  assumes, however, the common-sense world of stable objects which it  professes to call in question; hence, before we can discover its precise  bearing on our problem, we must find a way of stating it which does not  involve any of the assumptions which it is designed to render doubtful.  What we then find, as the bare outcome of experience, is that gradual  changes in certain sense-data are correlated with gradual changes in  certain others, or (in the case of bodily motions) with the other  sense-data themselves.    The assumption that sensible objects persist after they have ceased to  be sensible--for example, that the hardness of a visible body, which has  been discovered by touch, continues when the body is no longer  touched--may be replaced by the statement that the _effects_ of sensible  objects persist, _i.e._ that what happens now can only be accounted for,  in many cases, by taking account of what happened at an earlier time.  Everything that one man, by his own personal experience, can verify in  the account of the world given by common sense and physics, will be  explicable by some such means, since verification consists merely in the  occurrence of an expected sense-datum. But what depends upon testimony,  whether heard or read, cannot be explained in this way, since testimony  depends upon the existence of minds other than our own, and thus  requires a knowledge of something not given in sense. But before  examining the question of our knowledge of other minds, let us return to  the question of the thing-in-itself, namely, to the theory that what  exists at times when we are not perceiving a given sensible object is  something quite unlike that object, something which, together with us  and our sense-organs, causes our sensations, but is never itself given  in sensation.    The thing-in-itself, when we start from common-sense assumptions, is a  fairly natural outcome of the difficulties due to the changing  appearances of what is supposed to be one object. It is supposed that  the table (for example) causes our sense-data of sight and touch, but  must, since these are altered by the point of view and the intervening  medium, be quite different from the sense-data to which it gives rise.  There is, in this theory, a tendency to a confusion from which it  derives some of its plausibility, namely, the confusion between a  sensation as a psychical occurrence and its object. A patch of colour,  even if it only exists when it is seen, is still something quite  different from the seeing of it: the seeing of it is mental, but the  patch of colour is not. This confusion, however, can be avoided without  our necessarily abandoning the theory we are examining. The objection to  it, I think, lies in its failure to realise the radical nature of the  reconstruction demanded by the difficulties to which it points. We  cannot speak legitimately of changes in the point of view and the  intervening medium until we have already constructed some world more  stable than that of momentary sensation. Our discussion of the blue  spectacles and the walk round the table has, I hope, made this clear.  But what remains far from clear is the nature of the reconstruction  required.    Although we cannot rest content with the above theory, in the terms in  which it is stated, we must nevertheless treat it with a certain  respect, for it is in outline the theory upon which physical science and  physiology are built, and it must, therefore, be susceptible of a true  interpretation. Let us see how this is to be done.    The first thing to realise is that there are no such things as  \"illusions of sense.\" Objects of sense, even when they occur in dreams,  are the most indubitably real objects known to us. What, then, makes us  call them unreal in dreams? Merely the unusual nature of their  connection with other objects of sense. I dream that I am in America,  but I wake up and find myself in England without those intervening days  on the Atlantic which, alas! are inseparably connected with a \"real\"  visit to America. Objects of sense are called \"real\" when they have the  kind of connection with other objects of sense which experience has led  us to regard as normal; when they fail in this, they are called  \"illusions.\" But what is illusory is only the inferences to which they  give rise; in themselves, they are every bit as real as the objects of  waking life. And conversely, the sensible objects of waking life must  not be expected to have any more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37122"],[0,"Hunting in Many Lands: The Book of the Boone and Crockett Club (#15)"],[1," to be attributed entirely to our kind  treatment of him. He was, however, a good trailer, but the worst shot  that I remember to have met. He seemed to have no difficulty in finding  moose, but could not hit them, which was the exact reverse of our  experience.    Portions of the country between Lakes Winnipeg and Winnipegosis,  visited by our party, are as flat as the flattest portions of New  Jersey, and for great distances nothing could be more level except  possibly a billiard table. It is traversed by very few rivers or even  creeks, there being immense stretches of territory where the only guide  back to camp is the sun when it shines, or when it does not your  compass, or the dog-sled trail through the snow leading to the camp. The  different portions of this region are so much alike that it is almost  impossible to tell one from another.    Owing to the fact that it is very dangerous to be caught out over night,  with the thermometer ranging anywhere from zero to 50 degrees below, we  took the precaution to mount a big red flag in the top of the highest  spruce we could find near our camp, so that, by climbing a high tree  anywhere within a radius of a mile or so, one could easily see this  flag. To still further reduce the chance of getting lost, we blazed the  trees in a straight line for four miles due south of the camp, and, as  the dog-sled trail came into our camp (which was in the heavy timber)  from the north, it was not difficult to find one's way home in the  evening. These precautions--needless elsewhere, but wise in this  country--were taken principally because each of us had always been in  the habit for years of hunting alone--a practice which I would recommend  to anyone who desires to be really successful in killing big game.    This vast expanse of flat country is quite heavily wooded over large  areas, the timber being spruce, tamarack, poplar, birch, etc., with a  great abundance of red and gray willow. The underbrush is sometimes very  thick. There are, however, innumerable open places, which bear the local  name of muskegs. These are, of course, marshes in summer, and covered  with a heavy growth of grass; in winter they are frozen hard, and  traveling over them is comparatively easy.    The moose seem to be fond of remaining close to the edges of these  muskegs, which are usually fringed with a heavy growth of willows. It  would appear, however, that they venture out into these open places  either during the night, early in the morning, or late in the afternoon;  and, as these were the times when we were very glad either to be in camp  or to be returning to it, we had more success in finding the moose in  the timber, or on the little so-called ridges, which sometimes attain  the remarkable height of four or five feet.    Up to the time of leaving this camp we had very little opportunity to  use snowshoes, as the snow was not yet--about the last of November--deep  enough to make these necessary. We hunted all of the time in moccasins,  boots of any description being simply out of the question, as they would  soon freeze as hard as iron. After the cold weather set in, one day's  experience with boots was quite sufficient for me, and I came to the  conclusion, as I had often before in other regions, that it is very  difficult to improve, in the matter of clothing, upon the customs of the  country. The sudden change to moccasins was very tiring at first, but  after one gets used to walking in them he will find that he can walk  further and hunt better in them than any other style of foot-gear. We  used, as I remember, first one or two pairs of heavy woolen socks, then  a very heavy so-called \"German\" sock, coming up to the knee, over which  we wore the high laced moccasin of the country.    Before we had very long been engaged in moose hunting we all learned  that we were not so expert in the art of killing big game as we  previously imagined ourselves. In all my experience I have never met  with any animal which is so difficult to get a shot at, even when quite  numerous, as the moose in this region. It must always be borne in mind  that to kill a moose--especially in a country where they have been  hunted for generations by the Indians--by the thoroughly sportsmanlike  method of following the trail of one until you finally get a shot at it  and kill it, is a totally different thing from killing the same moose  either by calling him at night in the autumn or by paddling on him in a  canoe in the summer. In fact, of all the difficult things I have ever  undertaken in the way of sport, I regard this as the most difficult; and  before I got my first shot I began to think that there was a great deal  of truth in the Indian's sneering remark, \"White man no kill moose.\"  Finally one day my luck turned, but that it did so was due more to the  realization of my own inferiority, and lack of the proper kind of  knowledge, than to anything else.    It happened in this way: having thoroughly convinced myself that the  moose either smelt me or in some other way found out that I was in their  neighborhood before I could be made aware of the same fact, I concluded  that there was something radically wrong in my manner of hunting them,  although I employed every method known to me--methods which had been  acquired in an experience during which I had killed considerably over  one hundred head of big game, throughout the Rockies and the  Alleghanies. In short, I was exceedingly painstaking and careful.  Notwithstanding all my precautions, however, I remember that I had the  satisfaction one night of knowing that I had started during the day  eight different moose, each separately, without hearing or seeing a  single one of them. This sort of thing lasted for twenty-two consecutive  days, or until I finally concluded that, as our Indian seemed to have no  trouble in seeing moose, I would follow his tactics. Waiting, therefore,  one morning until I was sure that the Indian had left camp, I changed my  course so as to intersect his trail, followed this for some distance,  and watched carefully his foot-prints, so as to read the record of his  hunt.    Pretty soon it became apparent that he had come across a moose trail. He  tried it first with the toe of his moccasin, then with the butt of his  gun, and satisfied himself that it was too old to follow. He went on  until he came across another trail, and evidently had spent considerable  time in making up his mind whether it was worth while to follow this  trail or not. He then followed it for a few yards, and, to my surprise,  suddenly left it, and went off almost at right angles to the leeward. I  supposed that he had given up the moose trail, but nevertheless I  followed further on his track. Again to my surprise, I presently found  him gradually coming around in a circuitous fashion to the trail again,  until he finally reached it. He then immediately retraced his steps,  making another semi-circle, bearing generally, however, in the direction  the moose had gone, and again came to the trail. This occurred four or  five times, until finally the explanation of his conduct flashed upon  me, for there lay his cartridge. I saw--as he afterward described it to  me--where he had shot at the moose, which had just arisen out of its bed  a short distance away, but, as usual, he had missed it. Now I had  noticed, in my three weeks' experience, that I had come upon the moose  either lying down or standing in some thicket, but that they had been  able to wind me considerably before my arrival at the spot marked by  their beds in the snow. Not until then had occurred to me what is well  known to many who still-hunt moose, namely, that before lying down they  generally make a long loop to the leeward, returning close to their  trail, so that they can readily get the wind of anyone following upon it  long before he reaches them, when, of course, they quietly get up and  sneak away. In fact, they do not seem to have an atom of curiosity in  their composition, and in this are different from most other wild  animals that I have known. By making these long loops to the leeward the  hunter reduces to a minimum the likelihood of being smelt or heard by  the moose; and in these animals the senses of smell and hearing are very  acute, although their eyesight seems to be bad.    Having quite satisfied myself as to what it was necessary to do, I  waited until the next day to put it into execution, because by the time  I had made my discovery it was about half past 2 o'clock, and the sun  was near the horizon.    The following day I went out bright and early, and, after varying  success in finding a good trail, I ran across a trail made by five bull  moose, a photograph of one of which is shown. After satisfying myself  that the trail had been made during the previous night, I began making  the long loops to the leeward which I had found to be so necessary. I  finally came to the place where the moose had lain down--a bed showing  one of them to have unusually large horns--but they had gone on again,  in a manner, however, that showed that they were merely feeding, and not  alarmed. I redoubled my precautions, stepping as if on eggs, so as not  to break the twigs underneath my feet. In a short time I heard the  significant chattering of one of the little red pine squirrels so  abundant in that region. I at once knew that the squirrel had seen  something, but had not seen me. It did not take me long to make up my  mind that the only other living things in that vicinity which would be  likely to cause him to chatter were these moose, and that they were  probably startled, although I had not been conscious of making any  noise. At any rate, I ran quite rapidly toward the end of a small narrow  muskeg on my left, but some distance away, to which chance conclusion  and prompt action I owe probably one of the most fortunate and exciting  pieces of shooting that has occurred in my"]]]
