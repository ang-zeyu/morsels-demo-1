[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50357"],[0,"Origin of the 'Reorganized' Church and the Question of Succession (#15)"],[1,"or Apostles just named.\"    That is to say: that when the First Presidency is disorganized, the  Twelve Apostles become the presiding quorum of the Church until the  presidency is again organized, and during that time they are virtually  the Presidency of the Church--the presiding quorum. If through some  cause--which is not likely to arise--both these quorums should be  destroyed then it would devolve on the Seventies to set in order the  Church and they would become the presiding quorum. This is the law that  God has revealed, and it is the only law and order of the Priesthood  that He has revealed for the guidance of the Church in succession. You  may search the Doctrine and Covenants from beginning to end and will  find no other law of succession.    I think it must be conceded that the Apostles could not be equal in  authority with the Presidency when the First Presidency is fully and  properly organized. There could not be two heads--or three heads--of  equal authority at the same time, for such a thing would lead to  confusion. Hence the Apostles are equal, as has been stated in that  they have power to assume control of the affairs of the Church when the  Presidency is dissolved by the death of the President. This idea was  clearly in the mind of the Prophet when on the 16th day of January,  1836, in a special council of the Presidency and the Twelve, he  said--This is in the History of the Church, vol. 2, page 374; also the  'Reorganite' history, vol. 2, pages 11-12:        \"I next proceeded to explain the duty of the Twelve, and their      authority, which is next to the present Presidency, and that the      arrangement of the assembly in this place on the 15th instant,      in placing the High Council of Kirtland next the Presidency, was      because the business to be transacted was business relating to      that body in particular, which was to fill the several quorums      in Kirtland, not because they were first in office, and that the      arrangements were the most judicious that could be made on the      occasion; also the Twelve are not subject to any other than the      First Presidency; viz., myself, Sidney Rigdon, and Frederick G.      Williams, who are now my counselors; and where I am not, there is      no First Presidency over the Twelve.\"    If in such a case, there is no First Presidency over the Twelve, then  the Twelve must be the presiding quorum of the Church when the First  Presidency is disorganized. Again, at a special conference of the  Church held August 16, 1841, we are informed in the minutes that the  Prophet addressed the Saints as follows--(T. S., 2. 521.):        \"President Joseph Smith now arriving proceeded to state to the      conference at considerable length, the object of their present      meeting, and in addition to what President Young had stated in the      morning, said that the time had come when the Twelve should be      called upon to stand in their place next to the First Presidency,      and attend to the settling of emigrants and the business of the      Church at the stakes and assist to bear off the kingdom victorious      to the nations; and as they had been faithful and had borne the      burden in the heat of the day that it was right that they should      have an opportunity of providing something for themselves and      families, and at the same time relieve him so that he might attend      to the business of translating.        \"Motioned, seconded and carried, that the conference approve of the      instructions of President Smith, in relation to the Twelve, and      that they proceed accordingly, to attend to the duties of their      office.\"    Therefore it was by right of divine appointment that the Apostles'  quorum became the presiding quorum of the Church at the death of the  Prophet Joseph Smith.      LINEAGE.    We will now consider this \"law of lineage.\" From section 86, they quote  to us as follows:        \"Therefore, thus saith the Lord unto you with whom the Priesthood      hath continued through the lineage of your fathers, for ye are      lawful heirs, according to the flesh, and have been hid from the      world with Christ in God; therefore your life and the Priesthood      hath remained and must needs remain through you and your lineage,      until the restoration of all things spoken by the mouths of all the      holy prophets since the world began.\"    But they fail to quote the eleventh and succeeding verse:        \"Therefore, blessed are ye if ye continue in my goodness, a light      unto the gentiles, and through the Priesthood, a savior unto my      people Israel. The Lord hath said it, Amen.\"    But to whom was this revelation given? Was it to the Prophet Joseph  Smith alone? Is this a promise that his seed shall inherit the  Priesthood? Certainly not. This revelation was given December 6,  1832, to the Elders of the Church. Therefore, when members of the  \"Reorganization\" declare that Joseph Smith was one of these Elders  and must be included with his posterity in the promise, we meet their  argument with the counter statement, that the promise was also to Hyrum  Smith, to Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, George A. Smith, Parley P.  Pratt, Orson Pratt, and a large number of other Elders who never have  been identified with the \"Reorganization,\" nor have their children, and  to them this promise is as sure as to the seed of any others. We must  not lose sight of the fact that no man can lay claim to salvation, nor  to the Priesthood of God, simply because he had a faithful father. The  inference in this eleventh verse is, that if they are not faithful,  then they will not receive the fulfilment of the promise. The posterity  of Joseph Smith, like the posterity of any other Elder of Israel, will  stand or fall on their own foundation which they have builded. And if  the sons of Joseph Smith refuse to keep the commandments, the blessings  will pass them by; but God's work will continue until the consummation  of all things.    Again they quote from section 112 as follows:        \"For verily I say unto you, the keys of the dispensation which ye      have received, have come down from the fathers; and last of all      being sent down from heaven unto you.\"    This revelation was given to Thomas B. Marsh and the Apostles in July,  1837; and while it is true that the Priesthood which these men held  did come down from the fathers, it was not from father to son, from  generation to generation, in the flesh. For the Priesthood, as we  know, was conferred on the heads of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery  by Peter, James and John. Joseph Smith's grandfather did not hold the  Priesthood nor his fathers before him for generations upon generations.  So we must look at this in a broader sense than our friends are willing  that we should do. What is meant by the Priesthood coming down from  the fathers, and that it must needs remain through the lineage of the  Elders of the Church? It means simply this, that the Priesthood has  come down from those who held it in ancient days and has been conferred  upon men in this day according to promise, because they are of the seed  of Joseph of the tribe of Ephraim. For the Lord promised to bless the  children of Ephraim in the latter days with His power. And when the  Church was established it was with the promise that it was never again  to be destroyed; therefore, it must needs be that the Priesthood remain  through the lineage of the Elders of the Church. But it will be through  those who are faithful, and not the unfaithful sons, and there is not  one word in these passages that declares that the Presidency of the  High Priesthood descends from father to son, and that it is the right  of the son of Joseph Smith to succeed his father. Not one word!    They also quote section 110; to the effect that the generations were  to be blessed through the seed of Joseph Smith. That passage is from a  vision received by Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, April 3, 1836, when  they received the keys of various dispensations, and is as follows:        \"After this, Elias appeared, and committed the dispensation of      the Gospel of Abraham, saying, that in us, and our seed, all      generations after us should be blessed.\"    Therefore they say that unless the sons of the Prophet Joseph Smith  were in the true Church and held the Priesthood, this promise would  fail. Not so, however. As I have said, if those sons are not faithful  the realization of the promise will pass them by until some of the seed  of Joseph Smith will stand up to receive the blessing. Furthermore,  this promise was not made solely to Joseph Smith. Oliver Cowdery  received the same blessing; but he left the Church and went into  forbidden paths, and the promised blessing was taken from him and given  to another. So it will be with the sons of Joseph the Prophet; if they  repent not they shall not receive the blessing. The Lord has declared:        \"Who am I, saith the Lord, that have promised and have not      fulfilled? I command and a man obeys not, I revoke and they receive      not the blessing.\"    I stated that this blessing that was given to Oliver Cowdery was taken  from him and given to another. In the Doctrine and Covenants, section  124:94-95, this is found:        \"And from this time forth I appoint unto him (that is Hyrum Smith)      that he may be a prophet, and a seer, and a revelator unto my      Church, as well as my servant Joseph.        \"That he may act in concert also with my servant Joseph, and that      he shall receive counsel from my servant Joseph, who shall show      unto him the keys whereby he may ask and receive, and be crowned      with the same blessing, and glory, and honor, and Priesthood, and      gifts of the Priesthood, that once were put upon him that was my      servant Oliver Cowdery.\"    Here the blessings of Oliver Cowdery are transferred to the head  of Hyrum Smith, and, therefore, we can"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5039"],[0,"State of the Union Addresses (#15)"],[1,"for the current  fiscal year of appropriations amounting to 5.8 billion dollars and of  contract authorizations totaling 420 million dollars. The net reduction in  authority to obligate will be 5.0 billion dollars, because, of the  appropriations, 1.2 billion dollars will have to be restored in subsequent  years to liquidate contract authorizations still on the books.    The appropriations recommended for repeal include 2,827 million dollars for  the Navy Department, 1,421 million dollars for the War Department, 850  million dollars for lend-lease, 384 million dollars for the War Shipping  Administration, and 260 million dollars for the United States Maritime  Commission. The contract authorizations proposed for repeal are for the  Maritime Commission.    In addition, there are unused tonnage authorizations for construction of  naval vessels now valued at 5.4 billion dollars. In September 1945, I  suggested that this authority be reviewed by the appropriate committees of  the Congress, and the Congress has moved to bar construction under these  authorizations during the remainder of the fiscal year 1946. I propose to  continue this prohibition in the Navy budget estimates for the fiscal year  1947 and now renew my recommendation that legislation be enacted at the  earliest time to dear the statute books of these authorizations.    The amounts indicated for repeal in H.R. 4407 and the further rescissions  which I have recommended, excluding duplications and deferred cash payments  on existing authorizations, represent a cut in the authorized war program  of 60.8 billion dollars. The war authorizations will also be reduced 3'7  billion dollars by carrying receipts of revolving accounts to surplus, by  lapses, and by cancellation and repayment of commitments of the Government  war corporations.    On the other hand, supplemental appropriations of 600 million dollars will  be required for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation  Administration.    In the net, it is estimated that the cumulative authorized war and national  defense program will amount to 368 billion dollars on June 30, 1946.  Expenditures of 49 billion dollars during the fiscal year 1946 will have  pushed cumulative expenditures to 339 billion dollars. The unexpended  balances will be down to 28 billion dollars on June 30, 1946.    New authorizations for national defense and war liquidation in the fiscal  year 1947.-The expenditures of 15 billion dollars for national defense and  war liquidation in the fiscal year 1947 will be partly for payment of  contractual obligations incurred in the past, and partly for the payment of  new obligations. The unexpended balances on June 30, 1946, will be  scattered among hundreds of separate appropriations. Thus, while some  appropriation accounts will have unused balances, others will require  additional appropriations.    It is estimated that authorizations to incur new obligations of 11,772  million dollars will be needed during the fiscal year 1947, mainly for the  War and Navy Departments. Of the required authorizations, 11,365 million  dollars will be in new appropriations, 400 million dollars in new contract  authority, and 7 million dollars in reappropriations of unobligated  balances. In addition, appropriations of 825 million dollars will be needed  to liquidate obligations under existing contract authorizations.    Taking into account the tentative authorizations and expenditures estimated  for the fiscal year 1947, and offsets of 3 billion dollars in war  commitments of Government corporations, the cumulative authorized war and  national defense program on June 30, 1947, will be 376 billion dollars;  total expenditures, 354 billion dollars; and unexpended balances, 22  billion dollars.    The 22 billion dollars of unexpended balances tentatively indicated as of  June 30, 1947, comprise both unobligated authorizations and unliquidated  obligations. Most of the unliquidated obligations result from transactions  booked during the war years. A large part of the 22 billion dollars would  never be spent even if not repealed, for the appropriations will lapse in  due course. For example, several billion dollars of these unliquidated  obligations represent unsettled inter- and intra-departmental agency  accounts for war procurement. Legislation is being requested to facilitate  the adjustment of some of these inter-agency accounts. Another 6 billion  dollars is set aside for contract termination payments. If contract  settlement costs continue in line with recent experience, it is likely that  part of the 6 billion dollars will remain unspent.    On the other hand, some of the 22 billion dollars would be available for  obligation and expenditure unless impounded. In certain appropriations,  such as those for long-cycle procurement, considerable carry-over of  unliquidated obligations into future years is to be expected and is  necessary. However, substantial further rescissions can and should be made  when the war liquidation program tapers off and budgetary requirements for  national defense are clarified. As I have said, I shall continue to review  the war authorizations and from time to time recommend excess balances for  repeal.    As in recent years, detailed recommendations concerning most appropriations  for the national defense program are postponed until the spring. In  connection with the war activities of the United States Maritime Commission  and certain other agencies, however, I now make specific recommendations  for the fiscal year 1947. No additional authorizations or appropriations  will be necessary for the Maritime Commission since sufficient balances  will be left after the above-mentioned rescissions to carry out the program  now contemplated for the fiscal year 1947.    2. AFTERMATH OF WAR    Nearly one-third--11 billion dollars--of estimated Federal expenditures in  the fiscal year 1947 will be for purposes that are largely inherited from  the war--payments to veterans, interest on the Federal debt, and refunds of  taxes.    (a) For veterans.    \"Veterans' pensions and benefits\" has become one of the largest single  categories in the Federal Budget. I am recommending for this purpose total  appropriations of 4,787 million dollars for the fiscal year 1947.  Expenditures in the fiscal year are estimated, under present legislation,  at 4,208 million dollars. These expenditures will help our veterans through  their readjustment period and provide lasting care for those who were  disabled.    The Congress has provided unemployment allowances for veterans during their  readjustment period. Expenditure of 850 million dollars for this purpose is  anticipated for the fiscal year 1947. In addition, readjustment allowances  for self-employed veterans are expected to cost 340 million dollars in the  fiscal year 1947.    On May 28, 1945, in asking the Congress to raise the ceiling on benefits  for civilian unemployed to not less than 25 dollars a week during the  immediate reconversion period, I suggested that the Congress also consider  liberalizing veterans' allowances. Elsewhere in this Message I reiterate my  recommendation with respect to emergency unemployment compensation. I also  recommend increasing veterans' unemployment allowances from 20 dollars to  25 dollars a week. This would involve additional expenditures estimated at  approximately 220 million dollars for the fiscal year.    Included in the 1947 Budget is an expenditure of 535 million dollars for  veterans' education under provisions of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act.  This amount includes both tuition expenses and maintenance allowances. It  is expected that half a million veterans will be enrolled in our schools  and colleges during the year.    The ultimate benefit which veterans receive from the loan guarantee  provisions of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act depends largely on the  success of our stabilization program in restraining building costs and real  estate values. Under the revised procedure contained in recent amendments,  the administrative workload will be minimized by the almost complete  transfer of authority for approving the guarantees to private lending  agencies and private appraisers designated by the Veterans Administration.  This authority carries with it the responsibility for restricting the  guarantees to loans on reasonably valued properties. Costs of the program,  other than for administration, are estimated at 21 million dollars in the  fiscal year 1947.    Pensions for veterans will require expenditures estimated at 1,748 million  dollars for the fiscal year 1947. Two-thirds of this amount will be  received by veterans of the war which we have just won. This figure  includes 55 million dollars of increased pensions for student-veterans in  our vocational rehabilitation program. In addition, 170 million dollars  will be expended in transfers to the National Service Life Insurance fund  from general and special accounts.    Expenditures under the appropriation for salaries and expenses of the  Veterans Administration are estimated at 528 million dollars in the fiscal  year 1947. This includes 260 million dollars for medical care and the  operation of some 103,000 hospital and domiciliary beds.    A separate appropriation for hospital and domiciliary facilities,  additional to the total for veterans' pensions and benefits, covers  construction that will provide some 13,000 hospital beds as part of the  500-million dollar hospital construction program already authorized by the  Congress. The estimated expenditures of 130 million dollars for this  purpose are classified in the Budget as part of the general public works  program for the next fiscal year.    (b) For interest.    Interest payments on the public debt are estimated at 5 billion dollars in  the fiscal year 1947, an increase of 250 million dollars from the revised  estimate for the current fiscal year. This increase reflects chiefly  "]]]
