My design was to get  out an appointment and preach, which came to pass the same evening  in the following Manner: I stepped into a hotel, they were all at  dinner, I placed the Book of Mormon on a public table and sat down  to read a newspaper; soon the boarders came out, and one by one  looked at the Book, and inquired whose it was; soon the landlord  came out, who I learned was so very deaf that one could only be  heard by placing mouth to ear and shouting at the very top of the  voice. He caught up the Book and inquired, \"Whose is this?\" I  arose, placed my arm round his neck, and my mouth close to his ear,  and shouted, \"IT IS MINE, AND I HAVE COME TO PREACH!!\" This was so  loud that it almost alarmed the town. He welcomed me to  entertainment free of charge, had the Court House opened, the town  notified, and evening found me in the judge's seat, a reporter in  the clerk's desk, and a crowded audience. I had good liberty and  all seemed much interested.    After a few days we resumed our journey, and in May arrived in  Kirtland, where I again met my wife after an absence of one year  and seven months.

I shall not attempt to describe our feelings or our joy; these  things are known by experience, not by language. I found her health  much impaired, and she had long suffered from complaints of the  nature of consumption; but she was now reduced still further by her  anxious solicitude about my long absence.    When she found herself once more in the quiet enjoyment of my  society, she gradually resumed her wonted cheerfulness, and began  to enjoy better health; but still she was far from being well.    After spending a few weeks at home, I performed a short mission  in the southeastern part of Ohio, and again returned, having  travelled on foot in the heat of summer about three hundred miles.  In this mission I met with no success in the ministry, owing to the  prejudice, ignorance and bigotry of the people, who either would  not hear at all, or else heard in a careless manner, and went away  with the same indifference as they came.    I now determined to take my wife and our little effects and  remove to Western Missouri. To bear the expenses of this long  journey my wife had some sixty dollars, which she brought with her  from the East, and certain men also put into my hands sums of money  to be expended in lands and improvements in that country. With  brother Joseph's counsel and blessing I bade farewell to Kirtland.    We took a stage coach for the Ohio River, thence by steamer to  St. Louis, and again by steamer up the Missouri. I took a steerage  passage among the poorer class, and was dressed more like a laborer  than a public minister. However, the throng of passengers on the  boat learned by some means that I was a preacher, and on the 4th of  July they pressed me very hard to address them in the cabin in  honor of our national anniversary. I refused for awhile; but at  length complied, on conditions that steerage passengers, boat  hands, firemen, and all classes, black or white, should have the  privilege of assembling in the cabin to hear the discourse.    This was readily complied with, and very soon a large assembly  was convened and in waiting, consisting of ladies and gentlemen,  lawyers, merchants, farmers, servants, waiters and colored  gentlemen.    I presented myself before this motley assembly in a plain coat  of gray satinet, and bowed respectfully. All tried to be grave, but  a smile, a sneer, a look of contempt would now and then escape from  some of the more genteel portion of the assembly, as if they would  say, \"_Can any good thing come out of Nazareth_,\" or, in  other words, can so plain a man be possessed of knowledge  sufficient to entertain such an assembly on so important an  occasion as the 4th of July, and this, too, without preparing a  discourse beforehand?    I read a chapter; all was serious attention. I offered up a  prayer; all was deep interest. I commenced a discourse, and nearly  all were in tears. I introduced the Book of Mormon as a record of  ancient America; I dwelt upon its history and prophetic  declarations, now being verified by the erection of free  institutions in this great country, and their growing influence. I  spoke of the general prosperity and resources of the country,  acknowledging the hand of Providence in the same; warned them  against national pride, ambition, and injustice; exhorted them, in  common with all citizens, to use the utmost diligence to preserve  the general peace and the pure influence of our national  institutions; and to improve in light, intelligence and love,  without which we, too, might be brought down to destruction like  the Israelites and Nephites of old; and our bones and ruined cities  and monuments alone be left to other people, as theirs were left to  us, as a testimony of our greatness which would have passed away. I  also showed them from the Book of Mormon that we were destined to  remain forever as a blessed and free people on this land, on  conditions of keeping the commandments of Jesus Christ, and that  our settlements and commerce would soon extend to the vast shores  of the Pacific ocean, and our ensign stand out to the nations as a  standard inviting them to a banquet of freedom, peace and plenty.    After meeting I was pressed upon to come into the cabin for the  rest of the passage. And even when we changed boats at Louisville,  such was the influence of my fellow passengers, that the  gentlemen's and also the ladies' cabin and board was free to me  without money or price. One gentleman offered as high as ten  dollars for a copy of the Book of Mormon; but, unluckily, I had  none with me.    Arriving at the Colesville branch, on the western boundaries of  the State (where I had spent the previous winter in sickness and  poverty), about the 1st of August, 1832, we commenced cutting hay,  building, purchasing and planting land, and making every  preparation to receive those who had sent funds for this purpose.  During the months of August and September I had, with a little  help, secured about fifteen tons of hay, and put into the ground  fifteen acres of wheat, besides building a log house and doing  something at fencing, etc. These exertions in the heat of the  season brought on a severe illness, in which I was nigh unto death;  but I was again restored in a few days by the laying on of hands  and prayer in the name of Jesus.    About this time Lewis Abbott arrived with his family from  Kirtland, and having sent some money by me, partly to aid in my  expenses, and partly for the purpose of making improvements, he  became dissatisfied and demanded the utmost farthing. This took  everything I had done;--my wheat on the ground, my hay, my cows all  but one, and left me entirely destitute, after all my laborious  exertions. At this brother Abbott seemed satisfied, and thought he  had got quite rich, and turned his money to good advantage; but the  curse of God rested upon all his property as was soon manifest.    The next winter I took a mission in company with Elder William  E. McLellin down through the State of Missouri and into Illinois,  crossing the Mississippi at Clarksville.    As we approached Clarksville, we were told by several of the  inhabitants near, not to attempt a meeting or any religious  instruction there, for they were a hardened and irreclaimable set  of blasphemers and infidels, given to gambling, drinking and  cursing, etc.; and that many different orders of the clergy had  attempted in vain to reclaim them, or even to get a hearing. Before  entering the town we ascended a mountain and cried mightily unto  the Lord that He would open our way, and move upon the hearts of  the people to receive us and hear the Word.    We then entered the town and called at a hotel. We told the  landlord that we had come in the name of Jesus Christ to preach the  gospel to the people, being sent by him without purse or scrip.  \"Well,\" said he, \"you are welcome to my house and such fare as we  have; and we will meet together and hear your religion, and if it  proves to be better than ours we will embrace it; for we confess  that our religion is to fiddle and dance, and eat and drink, and be  merry, and gamble and swear a little; and we believe this is better  than priestcraft.\"    We replied that we would try them anyhow. So a meeting was  convened; we preached, had good attention, and much of a candid  spirit of inquiry was manifest, and we were treated with  hospitality and friendship, and even ferried over the river free;  and this was more than those religious sectaries would do, who had  warned us against them.    Passing over the river, the next day we came to Green County,  Illinois; and as the day drew to a close we began to circulate an  appointment as we travelled along a thick settlement of thrifty  farmers, for preaching in a school house in the neighborhood that  evening.    As we sat by the highway side to rest ourselves, an old farmer  rode past on horseback, and halted to ask if we were travellers. We  replied that we were travelling to preach the gospel, and had an  appointment that evening at the school house just ahead, and  invited him to come and hear. \"No,\" said he, \"I have not attended a  religious meeting this five years; I have long been disgusted and  tired of priestcraft and religious ignorance and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/449"],[0,"Pathology of Lying, Accusation, and Swindling: A Study in Forensic Psychology (#15)"],[1," her.  She had told them she formerly lived in the most beautiful  part of New Orleans and when 5 years old was placed in a convent,  and then taken to a boarding-school, from which she was kidnapped  and taken to a small town in Georgia.  She was later placed in  another boarding-school and there met the wealthy B.'s of  Charleston who took her home with them.  While there she had to  go to a hospital on account of some infection.  One day she was  thrust into a taxicab, taken on a boat, landed at another city,  etc.  The B.'s of Charleston have thus figured long in her story,  and we learned from several correspondents that this kidnapping  has figured over and over as a big event in her life.    Once, years ago, Inez was taken into a private home accompanied  by a trunk, we hear, which was found to contain a considerable  amount of jewelry.  This was pawned in the name of the people  with whom she then lived and was redeemed later by some one else.  Inez laid claim to the jewelry after a time, but apparently was  unable to produce anybody who could vouch that it was really  hers.  Its ownership has remained unknown.    When she went to St. Louis at one time she had stated she was to  meet a relative there, but the person, we have come to know, was  a certain very decent young man who had become acquainted with  her through a correspondence bureau.  He had thought well of her  and warned her not to come to that city, but when she did so he  met her and took her at once to his own home where the womenfolk  looked after her until she was found a place elsewhere.  The  deliberate attempt to throw herself upon his protection was thus  frustrated by his relatives.  Many other reports of the  misrepresentations of Inez have been given us.  She has  discovered that borrowing money on the strength of invented  statements is sometimes possible, particularly for her with her  good presence and convincing manner.  The B.'s complained that  when she left Tennessee there were in her trunk many dollars'  worth of articles that belonged to them.      Throughout our long experience with Inez we have never been able  to make up our mind whether or not she remembered all of her  past.  Her lying always stood in the way of getting at anything  like the real facts.  On no occasion has she truthfully dealt  with her career as we know it.  She has professed absolute lack  of knowledge of her accident, and of the time and place of its  occurrence.  It is interesting that none of her acquaintances  mention this.  Although Inez has told long stories of her past to  many people, and with some inclusion of truth, she never seems to  have mentioned this important event of which we learned from her  family.  We cannot, then, decide about possible amnesia for this  occurrence.    On occasion Inez has expressed the same desire for religious  experience as for education, and has written to friends that she  had become imbued with the Spirit.  Her story of her religious  upbringing is altogether unreliable and contradictory, but while  in one hospital she professed belief, took communion, and was  baptized in a certain faith.  Her behavior was not, however, in  the least modified by this.    One serious minded woman took Inez at her word when she said she  wanted to study algebra and offered her a good opportunity which  was never accepted.  This demonstrated clearly that the desire  was a matter of words only.  Inez' constant assertion of  independence has been one of her main sources of temporary  success.  Kindly people have speedily taken up with her.  Sympathy is undoubtedly, in spite of her statements to the  contrary, one of the strongest needs of her nature.  In one of  her letters we note her expression of satisfaction in a certain  situation where she found herself much ``mothered'' by kind  nurses.  All her chances, however, have been spoiled by her  indulgence in lies.    Inez has remained adamant to every plea and suggestion made by  many well-wishing friends that she reform and begin again.  After  her parents and other relatives were found and communicated with,  her career partly known, and her mother's need of sympathy shown  to her, she still refused to change her story in many  particulars--even when she knew that we had discovered about her  writing home within recent months.  She steadily refused to  acknowledge her true age.  When the evidence was complete,  showing that she could not be held as a runaway girl, but must be  treated under the law as a woman, she went forth to begin, as we  heard from many other sources, her old misrepresentations of  herself, which speedily got her into further trouble.    We were not astonished, even after we had accumulated almost the  entire knowledge of the career which we have outlined above, and  Inez knew that we had done so, to be visited by two fine  philanthropic women who wanted to consult with us about an  unfortunate girl who had won their sympathy, and who had been  placed by them in a leading hospital after having shown some  signs of acute bronchitis.  In fact, she was in such a bad  condition that she had to be transferred in an ambulance.  But  her illness had rapidly cleared up and now after ten days of  observation an eminent diagnostician had thoroughly scolded her  for simulation, and the girl was once more on their hands.  Indirectly they learned that we knew of the case of this ``girl  of 16.''  They realized that they had been taken in, but it had  been done so cleverly, and, as they expressed it, Inez showed  herself such a splendid actress, that they wondered if she had  not extraordinary histrionic abilities which could be utilized.  (It remains to be seen whether anything constructive can be done  by following this lead.  We feel that previous psychiatrists who  gave earlier an unfavorable prognosis in this case were perhaps  quite right.  But perhaps we should not let our opinions in this  be swayed by the fact that my associate, Dr. Bronner, who went to  this last hospital was met by an absolute denial on the part of  Inez of the essentials of the above career, by her insistence  that she was not the same person as the daughter of the Smiths,  and that she was only 17--all this in spite of her knowledge of  our correspondence with her family and others, and her own  previous acknowledgments of lying.)      Summary:  In summarizing the characteristics of this woman we may  first insist that she has ambition, push, and energy in high  degree.  Her personality as expressed in general bearing,  features, and facial action is remarkably strong and convincing.  Her ambition was shown in her work on our tests as well as in her  social behavior.  (We have wondered if it was not her desire to  shine which prevented the typical performance of the pathological  liar on the ``Aussage'' test.)  Her self-confidence as expressed  on numerous occasions is no less striking.  ``I tell you, doctor,  that I have told lies, but you will see that I will come out on  top.''    Inez has been free from the overt problems of sex life.  We have  repeatedly been informed that she has been a girl of good  character in this respect.  ``I ran away from home for a good  cause.  I'm not one of those girls who is crazy about the boys.''  Usually Inez shows a very even temper.  It is only when her own  personality is trod upon that she grows angry, and obstinacy is  then her leading reaction.  Some pathological liars may be weak  in character, but not Inez.  She is the firmest of persons.  On  occasions her attitude is entirely that of the grand lady.  Her  type of lying is clearly pathological.  It would often be very  hard to discern a purpose in it, and over and over again she has  defeated her own ends by further indulgence in prevarications.  To her the utterance of lies comes just as quickly and naturally  as speaking the truth comes to other people.  Even in interviews  with us when she was voluntarily acknowledging her shortcomings  in this direction she went on in the same breath to further  falsifications.    The medical aspects of the case come under the same category as  the lying.  The dysuria, the spitting of blood, the sugar in the  urine, the hairpins found twice in the abdomen, the simulated  pains, neurasthenia, and bronchial attacks, together with her  stories of accidents and fainting spells illustrate her general  tendency.  This behavior, like her lying, serves to feed her  egocentrism, her craving for sympathy and for being the center of  action.  As with the lying, repetition of this type of conduct  probably is largely a matter of habit.    The bearing of this case on the problems of testimony is  interesting.  As shown in our account of tests done, when  objective concrete material was considered by this woman she  reported it well.  It is only when her egocentrism is brought  into play that she becomes so definitely unreliable.  This is a  line of demarcation that students of this subject would do well  to recognize.    Causative Factors:  Our study of causation in this case, as we  intimated at first, is necessarily incomplete.  But some things,  probably explanatory, stand out very clearly.  Heredity is  moderately defective.  Inez was the outcome of an unfortunate  pregnancy and was a poorly developed infant.  She suffered early  from a number of illnesses, which, however, left no perceptible  physical defects.  Her unusual relationship to the other  children, based on the difference in age, was perhaps a starting  point for the development of her inventional theories of her own  origin.  She has given us many hints of this in speaking of her  earliest remembrances of hearing the Smiths whispering something  about adoption, and of her feeling that the other children were  too old for her to belong to their family.    Then we insist on the positive bearing which this woman's native  traits have had in the production of her career.  Her facility  with language"]]]
