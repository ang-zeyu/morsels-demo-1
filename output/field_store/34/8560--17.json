[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3410"],[0,"The American Spirit in Literature: A Chronicle of Great Interpreters (#15)"],[1,"3, after he had left the Unitarian  pulpit, Emerson made in his diary this curious attempt to reconcile the  scriptural language of his ancestral profession to the new vocabulary of  Transcendentalism: \"Jesus Christ was a minister of the pure Reason. The  beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount are all utterances of the mind  contemning the phenomenal world... . The understanding can make nothing  of it. 'Tis all nonsense. The Reason affirms its absolute verity.... St.  Paul marks the distinction by the terms natural man and spiritual  man. When Novalis says, 'It is the instinct of the Understanding to  contradict the Reason,' he only translates into a scientific formula the  doctrine of St. Paul, 'The Carnal Mind is enmity against God.'\"    One more quotation must suffice. It is from a poem by a forgotten  Transcendentalist, F. G. Tuckerman.         \"No more thy meaning seek, thine anguish plead;       But, leaving straining thought and stammering word,       Across the barren azure pass to God;       Shooting the void in silence, like a bird--       A bird that shuts his wings for better speed!\"    It is obvious that this \"contemning the phenomenal world,\" this  \"revulsion against the intellect as the sole source of truth,\" is highly  dangerous to second-class minds. If one habitually prints the words  Insight, Instinct, Intuition, Consciousness with capitals, and relegates  equally useful words like senses, experience, fact, logic to lower-case  type, one may do it because he is a Carlyle or an Emerson, but the  chances are that he is neither. Transcendentalism, like all idealistic  movements, had its \"lunatic fringe,\" its camp-followers of excitable,  unstable visionaries. The very name, like the name Methodist, was  probably bestowed upon it in mockery, and this whole perturbation of  staid New England had its humorous side. Witness the career of Bronson  Alcott. It is also true that the glorious affirmations of these seers  can be neither proved nor disproved. They made no examination and they  sought no validation of consciousness. An explorer in search of  the North Pole must bring back proofs of his journey, but when a  Transcendentalist affirms that he has reached the far heights of human  experience and even caught sight of the gods sitting on their thrones,  you and I are obliged to take his word for it. Sometimes we hear such a  man gladly, but it depends upon the man, not upon the trustworthiness  of the method. Finally it should be observed that the Transcendental  movement was an exceedingly complex one, being both literary,  philosophic, and religious; related also to the subtle thought of the  Orient, to mediaeval mysticism, and to the English Platonists; touched  throughout by the French Revolutionary theories, by the Romantic spirit,  by the new zeal for science and pseudo-science, and by the unrest of a  fermenting age.    Our present concern is with the impact of this cosmopolitan current  upon the mind and character of a few New England writers. Channing and  Theodore Parker, Margaret Fuller and Alcott, Thoreau and Emerson, are  all representative of the best thought and the noblest ethical  impulses of their generation. Let us choose first the greatest name: a  sunward-gazing spirit, and, it may be, one of the very Sun-Gods.    The pilgrim to Concord who stops for a moment in the village library to  study French's statue of Emerson will notice the asymmetrical face. On  one side it is the face of a keen Yankee farmer, but seen from the  other side it is the countenance of a seer, a world's man. This contrast  between the parochial Emerson and the greater Emerson interprets many a  puzzle in his career. Half a mile beyond the village green to the north,  close to the \"rude bridge\" of the famous Concord fight in 1775, is the  Old Manse, once tenanted and described by Hawthorne. It was built by  Emerson's grandfather, a patriot chaplain in the Revolution, who died of  camp-fever at Ticonderoga. His widow married Dr. Ezra Ripley, and here  Ralph Waldo Emerson and his brothers passed many a summer in their  childhood. Half a mile east of the village, on the Cambridge turnpike,  is Emerson's own house, still sheltered by the pines which Thoreau  helped him to plant in 1838. Within the house everything is unchanged:  here are the worn books, pen and inkstand, the favorite pictures upon  the wall. Over the ridge to the north lies the Sleepy Hollow cemetery  where the poet rests, with the gravestones of Hawthorne and the Alcotts,  Thoreau and William James close by.    But although Concord is the Emerson shrine, he was born in Boston, in  1803. His father, named William like the grandfather, was also, like the  Emerson ancestors for many generations, a clergyman--eloquent, liberal,  fond of books and music, highly honored by his alma mater Harvard and  by the town of Boston, where he ministered to the First Church. His  premature death in 1811 left his widow with five sons--one of them  feebleminded--and a daughter to struggle hard with poverty. With her  husband's sister, the Calvinistic \"Aunt Mary Moody\" Emerson, she held,  however, that these orphaned boys had been \"born to be educated.\" And  educated the \"eager blushing boys\" were, at the Boston Latin School and  at Harvard College, on a regimen of \"toil and want and truth and mutual  faith.\" There are many worse systems of pedagogy than this. Ralph was  thought less persistent than his steady older brother William, and far  less brilliant than his gifted, short-lived younger brothers, Edward  and Charles. He had an undistinguished career at Harvard, where he was  graduated in 1821, ranking thirtieth in a class of fifty-nine. Lovers of  irony like to remember that he was the seventh choice of his classmates  for the position of class poet. After some desultory teaching to help  his brothers, he passed irregularly through the Divinity School, his  studies often interrupted by serious ill-health. \"If they had examined  me,\" he said afterward of the kindly professors in the Divinity School,  \"they never would have passed me.\" But approve him they did, in 1826,  and he entered decorously upon the profession of his ancestors, as  associate minister of the Second Church in Boston. His \"Journals,\" which  are a priceless record of his inner life, at this and later periods,  reveal the rigid self-scrutiny, the tender idealism, with which he began  his ministerial career.    But as a scheme of life for Ralph Waldo Emerson this vocation would not  satisfy. The sexton of the Second Church thought that the young man was  not at his best at funerals. Father Taylor, the eccentric Methodist,  whom Emerson assisted at a sailor's Bethel near Long Wharf, considered  him \"one of the sweetest souls God ever made,\" but as ignorant of the  principles of the New Testament as Balaam's ass was of Hebrew grammar.  By and by came an open difference with his congregation over the  question of administering the Communion. \"I am not interested in it,\"  Emerson admitted, and he wrote in his \"Journal\" the noble words: \"It is  my desire, in the office of a Christian minister, to do nothing which  I cannot do with my whole heart.\" His resignation was accepted in 1832.  His young wife had died of consumption in the same year. He now sailed  for Italy, France, and England, a memorable journey which gave him an  acquaintance with Landor, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Carlyle, but which  was even more significant in sending him, as he says, back to himself,  to the resources of his own nature. \"When shows break up,\" wrote Whitman  afterward, \"what but oneself is sure?\" In 1834 and 1835 we find Emerson  occupying a room in the Old Manse at Concord, strolling in the quiet  fields, lecturing or preaching if he were invited to do so, but chiefly  absorbed in a little book which he was beginning to write--a new  utterance of a new man.    This book, the now famous \"Nature\" of 1836, contains the essence of  Emerson's message to his generation. It is a prose essay, but written in  the ecstatic mood of a poet. The theme of its meditation is the soul  as related to Nature and to God. The soul is primal; Nature, in all  its bountiful and beautiful commodities, exists for the training of the  soul; it is the soul's shadow. And every soul has immediate access to  Deity. Thus the utility and beauty and discipline of Nature lift the  soul Godward. The typical sentence of the book is this: \"The sun shines  today also\"; that is to say: the world is still alive and fair; let us  lift up our hearts! Only a few Americans of 1836 bought this singular  volume, but Emerson went serenely forward. He had found his path.    In 1837 he delivered the well-known Phi Beta Kappa oration at Harvard  on \"The American Scholar.\" Emerson was now thirty-four; he had married  a second time, had bought a house of his own in Concord, and purposed to  make a living by lecturing and writing. His address in Cambridge, though  it contained no reference to himself, was after all a justification  of the way of life he had chosen: a declaration of intellectual  independence for himself and his countrymen, an exhortation of  self-trust to the individual thinking man. \"If the single man plant  himself indomitably on his instincts and there abide, the huge world  will come round to him.\" Such advice to cut loose from the moorings of  the past was not unknown in Phi Beta Kappa orations, though it had never  been so brilliantly phrased; but when Emerson applied precisely the  same doctrine, in 1838, to the graduating class at the Harvard Divinity  School, he roused a storm of disapproval. \"A tempest in our washbowl,\"  he wrote coolly to Carlyle, but it was more than that. The great  sentence of the Divinity School address, \"God is, not was; he speaketh,  not spake,\" was the emphasis of a superb rhetorician upon the immediacy  of the soul's access to God. It has been the burden of a thousand  prophets in all religions.

Recently two  trappers wrote of their season's catch and added that a good  proportion was caught in deadfalls and snares. These trappers were  located in Western Canada; marten 54, lynx 12, mink 19, ermine 71,  wild cat 11, foxes 18.    While these trappers did not say, it is presumed that the foxes were  caught in snares or steel traps, for it is seldom that one is caught  in a deadfall. In Canada and the New England States, where foxes are  plentiful, the snare is used to a considerable extent.    Skunk, mink, ermine, weasel and opossum are easily caught in  deadfalls. One trapper in a southern state is said to have caught 94  mink, besides 38 coon and 57 opossum, in 28 deadfalls, from November  25th to February 25th, or three months.        CHAPTER XXIV.    GENERAL INFORMATION.    Early in September, 1906, the editor spent a couple of days at his  home in Southern Ohio, where in the '80's along and near a small  stream known as Kyger Creek, considerable trapping was done.    If readers are curious and have a good, large map of Ohio, and look  at the southern border, some fifty miles above the mouth of the  Scioto river, on a direct line or about double that by following the  winding of the river, they will find Kyger Creek. The stream is about  ten miles long and empties into the Ohio river below the village of  Cheshire. The country is rather rough and rocky, but the timber has  mainly disappeared.    A quarter of a century ago, opossum, muskrat, skunk, and fox were  more numerous than now. Mink at that time were few, but in the early  '80's they seemed to become fairly plentiful all at once. The high  price has caused considerable trapping, and their number has  decreased of recent years.    In trapping we found deadfalls, properly made, set and baited to be  an excellent trap for mink, skunk and opossum. As there were few coon  where we were trapping, but few were caught, yet an old trapper  nearby caught several in both deadfalls and steel traps each season.    There is no doubt but that a trapper who expects to remain months at  the same place should have a few deadfalls. These traps, like steel  traps, to make catches, do not depend upon numbers so much as correct  and careful construction and setting. A half dozen deadfalls located  at the right places, carefully built and properly set, are worth  probably as much as fifty carelessly constructed and located at  haphazard.    Some object to deadfalls because fox are seldom caught in them. It is  true that few fox are taken in deadfalls, although in the far North  some are, and especially Arctic and White fox.    The deadfall trapper, however, who gives care and attention to his  traps finds them fur takers. They can be built small for weasel or a  little larger for mink, marten and civet cat; or larger for opossum  and skunk; still heavier for coon and wild cat and even to a size  that kills bear.    Some trappers find the mink hard to catch. At some seasons they are  easy to take in deadfalls. Long in the '80's in five winters eight  mink were caught in one deadfall. The first winter one was caught;  second, two; third, three; fourth and fifth, each one.    If our memory serves us right, the trap was first built in the fall  of 1887, and was located on the bank about ten feet to the left of a  sycamore, which at that time was standing. There was a den under the  tree entering near the water, with an outlet on the bank only a few  feet from the trap, and near where the pen and bait were located.    This deadfall was built much like the illustration shown here. While  the fall was of hickory, not a vestige remained when looking at the  place in September, 1906.    The pen should be built strong and tight so that the animal will not  tear it to pieces and get at the bait from the rear. The \"fall\" or  top pole can be of any kind of wood, but hickory, oak, beech, maple,  and other heavy wood are all good. The pole should be heavy enough to  kill the animal without placing any weights on it. When building it  is a good idea to let the top pole extend about a couple of feet  beyond the pen. This will give more weight on the animal when the  trap falls.      [Illustration: A GOOD CATCHER.]    The two piece triggers may work hard, especially if the log used for  the fall has rough bark on. In this case it might be well to smooth  with your axe or hatchet. In setting with the two piece trigger make  them out of as hard wood as can be found. The long piece can be  slightly flattened on the under side, or the side on which the upper  end of the upright or prop sets. The prop should be cut square on the  lower end while the upper end might be a little rounding, as this  will tend to make the top or bait trigger slip off easier.    In setting raise up the top pole and hold in position with the knee.  This gives both hands free to adjust the triggers. When you think you  have them right, gradually let the weight off your knee and then try  the trigger. You will soon learn about how they are to be set.    The bait should be tied on or the bait trigger may have a prong on to  hold the bait. If you find the bait gone and the trap still up the  chances are that it was set too hard and the animal stole the bait.    Of late years in some sections, mice have been very troublesome,  eating the bait. In other places birds are bait stealers, and for  this reason it is best to set traps rather hard to throw.    The location of a deadfall has much to do with the catch. Old  trappers know if they were to set a steel trap in a place not  frequented by fur bearers that their catch would be next to nothing.  The same applies to all sets, whether steel traps, snares or  deadfalls.    In the illustration it will be noticed that the opening or the side  which the animal enters for bait is facing the creek. When building  these traps it will be found best to leave the open side toward the  water if trapping for mink or coon, as they generally leave the edge  of the water going directly to dens along and near the bank.    The under log in the deadfall shown does not extend but a few inches  beyond the two end stakes. It should extend eight or ten inches  beyond. The four stakes at pen must be of sufficient length that when  the trap is set they extend above the top or fall pole. If they did  not, the trap in falling, might catch on the end of one of the stakes  and not go down.    Along streams these traps need not be close. A couple to the mile is  plenty. Of course, if there are places where dens are numerous more  can be built to advantage, while along other stretches of water it  may be useless to build them at all. It all depends upon whether  animals travel there. You cannot catch them in any kind of trap if  they are not there.    For opossum, skunk, mink, civet cat, coon, ermine, etc., find where  the animals live or where they go frequently searching for food. If  building where there are dens, either locate within a few feet of the  one that appears best or just off the path that the animal takes in  going from one to the other. Have the open part next to path and say  only three feet off.    Marten trappers, while placing traps on high ground, do not pay so  much attention to dens and paths, for these animals spend much time  in trees looking for squirrels, birds, etc., but go through the  forest \"spotting a line\" and locate a deadfall in likely ground about  every 200 yards, or about 8 to the mile.        CHAPTER XXV.    SKINNING AND STRETCHING.    Much importance should be attached to the skinning and stretching of  all kinds of skins so as to command the highest commercial value. The  fisher, otter, foxes, lynx, marten, mink, ermine, civet, cats and  skunk should be cased, that is, taken off whole.    Commence with the knife in the center of one hind foot and slit up  the inside of the leg, up to and around the vent and down the other  leg in a like manner. Cut around the vent, taking care not to cut the  lumps or glands in which the musk of certain animals is secreted,  then strip the skin from the bone of the tail with the aid of a split  stick gripped firmly in the hand while the thumb of the other hand  presses against the animals back just above. Make no other slits in  the skin except in the case of the skunk and otter, whose tails  require to be split, spread, and tacked on a board.    Turn the skin back over the body, leaving the pelt side out and the  fur side inward, and by cutting a few ligaments, it will peel off  very readily. Care should be taken to cut closely around the nose,  ears and lips, so as not to tear the skin. Have a board made about  the size and shape of the three-board stretcher, only not split in  halves. This board is to put the skin over in order to hold it better  while removing particles of fat and flesh which adheres to it while  skinning, which can be done with a blunt-edged knife, by scraping the  skin from the tail down toward the nose--the direction in which the  hair roots grow--never scrape up the other way or you will injure the  fiber of the skin, and care should be taken not to scrape too hard,  for if the skin fiber is injured its value is decreased.      [Illustration: SINGLE AND THREE BOARD STRETCHER.]    Now, having been thoroughly \"fleshed,\" as the above process is  called, the skin is ready for stretching, which is done by inserting  the two halves of the three-board stretcher and drawing the skin over  the boards to its fullest extent, with the back on one side and the  belly on the other, and tacking it fast by driving in a small nail an  inch or so from each side of the tail near the edges of the skin;  also, in like manner the other side. Now insert the wedge and drive  it between the halves almost its entire length. Care should be taken,  however, to not stretch the skin"]]]
