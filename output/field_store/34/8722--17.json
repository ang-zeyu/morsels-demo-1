Faith  in God and genuine repentance are prerequisites to effective baptism.  In all consistency and justice, therefore, baptism can be required  of those only who are capable of exercising faith and of rendering  repentance.    The undeveloped mind of a babe is incapable of conceiving sin, of  experiencing faith, or of comprehending repentance. Why then should  babes be baptized?    We search in vain for scriptural authority or sanction of the practise  of infant baptism. Christ took little children into His arms and  blessed them, saying to those who would have kept the innocents from  Him \"Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for  of such is the kingdom of heaven.\" (Matt. 19:14).    But He did not baptize them; and, as an early writer has tersely  remarked: \"From the action of Christ's blessing infants, to infer they  are to be baptized, proves nothing so much as that there is a want  of better argument; for the conclusion would with more probability  be derived thus: Christ blessed infants, and so dismissed them, but  baptized them not; therefore infants are not to be baptized.\"    The unscriptural and repellent dogma of inherent degeneracy and the  contaminating effect of original sin, by which every child is born  vile in the sight and judgment of God, long cast its dark shadow over  the minds of men. From this conception sprang the practise of infant  baptism and the perverted doctrine of assured damnation for all babes  who die unbaptized. Even the most radical of churches has modified its  teaching on this subject, and today permits its members to believe that  children who die without baptism pass to a state of partial happiness  and content, though forever denied the beatific vision of God.    It is conceded, of course, that no dictum, dogma, or doctrine of men  can determine the fate of souls, infant or adult, in the hereafter;  nevertheless, theologic precepts have direct effect upon the thoughts  and lives of mankind. It is cheering to know that practically all  Christendom today repudiates the frightful heresy of the eternal  condemnation of babes who die without baptism.    Hear now the word of \"Mormonism\" on the matter and note the time of its  enunciation. In 1830 the Book of Mormon was first published. Therein we  read, in an epistle of the ancient prophet Mormon to his son Moroni:    \"Listen to the words of Christ, your Redeemer, your Lord and your  God. Behold, I came into the world not to call the righteous, but  sinners to repentance: the whole need no physician, but they that are  sick; wherefore little children are whole, for they are not capable  of committing sin; wherefore the curse of Adam is taken from them in  me, that it hath no power over them; and the law of circumcision is  done away in me. And after this manner did the Holy Ghost manifest  the word of God unto me; wherefore, my beloved son, I know that it is  solemn mockery before God, that ye should baptize little children.  Behold I say unto you, that this thing shall ye teach, repentance and  baptism unto those who are accountable and capable of committing sin;  yea, teach parents that they must repent and be baptized, and humble  themselves as their little children, and they shall all be saved with  their little children. And their little children need no repentance,  neither baptism. Behold, baptism is unto repentance to the fulfilling  the commandments unto the remission of sins. But little children are  alive in Christ, even from the foundation of the world. . . . Little  children cannot repent; wherefore it is awful wickedness to deny the  pure mercies of God unto them, for they are all alive in him because  of his mercy. And he that saith, that little children need baptism,  denieth the mercies of Christ, and setteth at nought the atonement of  him and the power of his redemption.\" (Book of Mormon, Moroni 8:8-20).    So proclaims the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to the  world today. Faith in God, repentance of sin, baptism by water and  of the Spirit, are required of every soul that comes to years of  accountability and powers of comprehension; but without faith and  repentance, of which only understanding minds are capable, baptism is  but a perversion of the Gospel ordinance.    The Scriptures relating to baptism in all ages and of all peoples are  in harmony as to the conditions essential to the proper reception of  the saving rite. In a revelation on Church government given through  Joseph Smith the Prophet, in April, 1830, the Lord Jesus Christ thus  defined the status of acceptable candidates for baptism:    \"All those who humble themselves before God, and desire to be baptized  and come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits, and witness  before the church that they have truly repented of all their sins,  and are willing to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ, having a  determination to serve him to the end, and truly manifest by their  works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the  remission of their sins, shall be received by baptism into His Church.\"  (D&C 20:37).    These conditions exclude all who have not reached the age and capacity  of discretion and understanding; and by specific commandment the Lord  has forbidden the Church to administer baptism to others:    \"No one can be received into the Church of Christ, unless he has  arrived unto the years of accountability before God, and is capable of  repentance.\" (Verse 71).    By revelation the Lord has designated eight years as the age at which  children may be baptized into the Church. At an earlier age, however,  children are to be brought to the elders of the Church, and be blessed  by the laying on of hands in the name of Jesus Christ, after the  pattern set by the Master in the course of His personal ministry.        -- 24 --    THE WATERY GRAVE    And the New Birth    WHILE our Lord tarried at Jerusalem following the first Passover  festival after the beginning of His public ministry, there came unto  Him by night a certain ruler of the Jews. The visitor was of the  Pharisees and a member of the great Sanhedrin, or supreme council of  the nation. There is significance in the circumstance that Nicodemus  sought Christ by night. Read John 3:1-21. We must credit the man with a  genuine desire to learn of the doctrines taught by the newly recognized  Prophet from Galilee, whose fame was already widely spread; but it  appears that pride of station or fear of criticism led him to seek an  interview under cover of darkness and privacy.    Speaking for himself and probably for his official associates,  Nicodemus thus addressed the Savior: \"Rabbi, we know that thou art  a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou  doest, except God be with him.\"    Without waiting for specific questions, \"Jesus answered and said unto  him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he  cannot see the kingdom of God.\"    The learned Jew expressed surprise, if not incredulity. \"How can a man  be born when he is old?\" he asked; \"can he enter the second time into  his mother's womb, and be born?\" Even after further explanation of  the plan provided for the salvation of mankind, the eminent Rabbi and  Sanhedrist exclaimed: \"How can these things be?\" Our Lord's reply must  have been humbling if not humiliating to the man: \"Art thou a master of  Israel, and knowest not these things?\" The conditions of citizenship  in the kingdom of God are so simple that even the unscholarly may  understand and obey.    Beyond question the second birth specified to Nicodemus as so  thoroughly indispensable that without it no man can ever see the  kingdom of God is baptism by water, and by the ministry of the Spirit  or the Holy Ghost.    The efficacy of baptism as a means of securing remission of sins and  of attaining entrance to the Church of Jesus Christ, which is the  kingdom of God, lies in the fact that this is the ordinance prescribed  by Divine authority, whereby the Savior's atoning sacrifice may be  made operative and effective. Salvation is not to be had for the mere  asking; it is nevertheless made accessible to all through faith and  prescribed works.    Simple as is the outward or physical process, there is profound  symbolism in the baptismal rite. As seen, Christ compared it to  a birth, an entrance into a new world or state of being. No such  symbolism obtains in baptism except by complete immersion in water and  a coming forth therefrom.    Water baptism has also been very impressively compared to burial and  resurrection; and the comparison is meaningless except the baptism be  by immersion followed by a rising from the watery grave. Paul evidently  so knew, as his words attest: \"Know ye not that so many of us as were  baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we  are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was  raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also  should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together  in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his  resurrection.\" (Rom. 6:3-5; see also Col. 2:12).    Christ Himself was baptized \"to fulfill all righteousness,\" and His  baptism at the hands of John was by immersion, as is evidenced by the  fact that He \"went up straightway out of the water.\"    Have you read the story of the contrite Ethiopian eunuch, treasurer  to Queen Candace? After listening to Philip's exposition of the  Scriptures, as the two rode together, the Ethiopian desired baptism,  and, Philip consenting, \"he commanded the chariot to stand still: and  they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and  he baptized him. And when they were come up out of the water, the  Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47192"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 2 (#15)"],[1,"eto; the antiquity of the Gospel;  the virtue of the atonement of Christ; the importance of men in this  age being in communication with God through the means of revelation;  the bitterness and fate of apostates. The document is a complete  refutation of the charges of bad motives behind the conduct of the  saints. No man, I believe, can read this document and then believe that  those who issued it were evil disposed men bent on deceiving mankind.    The late President Daniel H. Wells was wont to say that some time  previous to his joining the Church he was satisfied that Joseph  Smith was an inspired man because of his intuitive knowledge of the  fundamental principles of law--a view that will be confirmed by a  perusal of the parts of this communication which deal with the origin,  force, and relations of law.    3. The case of Joseph Smith _vs._ \"Doctor\" Hurlburt did not come to  trial until the 4th of April, 1834, when the \"Doctor\" was bound over to  keep the peace.    {28}        Chapter II.    Organization of the High Council--First Cases Before the Council.        _Minutes of the Organization of the High Council of the Church of      Christ of Latter-day Saints, Kirtland, February 17, 1834_. [1]        1. This day a general council of twenty-four High Priests assembled      at the house of Joseph Smith, Jun., by revelation, and proceeded      to organize the High Council of the Church of Christ, which was to      consist of twelve High Priests, and one or three Presidents, as the      case might require.        2. The High Council was appointed by revelation for the purpose of      settling important difficulties which might arise in the Church,      which could not be settled by the Church or the Bishop's council to      the satisfaction of the parties.        3. Joseph Smith, Jun., Sidney Rigdon, and Frederick G. Williams,      were acknowledged Presidents by the voice of the Council; and      Joseph Smith, Sen., John Smith, Joseph Coe, John Johnson, Martin      Harris, John S. Carter, Jared Carter, Oliver Cowdery, Samuel H.      Smith, Orson Hyde, Sylvester Smith, and Luke Johnson, High Priests,      were chosen to be a standing Council for the Church, by the      unanimous voice of the Council.        4. The above-named Councilors were then asked whether they accepted      their appointments, and whether they would act in that office      according to the law of heaven: to which they all answered that      they accepted their appointments, and would fill their offices      according to the grace of God bestowed upon them.        5. The number composing the Council, who voted in the name and      for the Church, in appointing the above named Councilors were      forty-three, as follows:--Nine High Priests, seventeen Elders, four      Priests and thirteen members.        6. Voted: that the High Council cannot have power to act without      seven of the above-named Councilors, or their regularly appointed      successors, are present.        7. These seven shall have power to appoint other High Priests, whom      they may consider worthy and capable to act in the place of absent      Councilors.        {29} 8. Voted: that whenever any vacancy shall occur by the      death, removal from office for transgression, or removal from the      bounds of this Church government, of any one of the above-named      Councilors, it shall be filled by the nomination of the President      or Presidents, and sanctioned by the voice of a general council of      High Priests, convened for that purpose, to act in the name of the      Church.        9. The President of the Church, who is also the President of the      Council, is appointed by revelation, and acknowledged in his      administration, by the voice of the Church.        10. And it is according to the dignity of his office that he should      preside over the Council of the Church; and it is his privilege      to be assisted by two other Presidents, appointed after the same      manner he himself was appointed;        11. And in case of the absence of one or both of those who are      appointed to assist him, he has power to preside over the Council      without an assistant: and in case he himself is absent, the other      Presidents have power to preside in his stead, both, or either of      them.        12. Whenever a High Council of the Church of Christ is regularly      organized, according to the foregoing pattern, it shall be the      duty of the twelve Councilors to cast lots by numbers, and thereby      ascertain, who of the twelve shall speak first, commencing with      number one, and so in succession to number twelve.        13. Whenever this Council convenes to act upon any case, the twelve      Councilors shall consider whether it is a difficult one or not;      if it is not, two only of the Councilors shall speak upon it,      according to the form above written.        14. But if it is thought to be difficult, four shall be appointed;      and if more difficult, six; but in no case shall more than six be      appointed to speak.        15. The accused, in all cases, has a right to one half of the      Council, to prevent insult or injustice;        16. And the Councilors appointed to speak before the Council, are      to present the case after the evidence is examined, in its true      light before the Council, and every man is to speak according to      equity and justice.        17. Those Councilors who draw even numbers, that is 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,      and 12, are the individuals who are to stand up in behalf of the      accused, and prevent insult and injustice.        18. In all cases the accuser and accused shall have a privilege of      speaking for themselves before the Council after the evidences are      heard, and the Councilors who are appointed to speak on the case,      have finished their remarks.        19. After the evidences are heard, the Councilor, accuser and      accused have spoken, the President shall give a decision according      to the {30} understanding which he shall have of the case, and call      upon the twelve Councilors to sanction the same by their vote.        20. But should the remaining Councilors, who have not spoken,      or any one of them, after hearing the evidences and pleadings      impartially, discover an error in the decision of the President,      they can manifest it, and the case shall have a re-hearing;        21. And if, after a careful re-hearing, any additional light is      shown upon the case, the decision shall be altered accordingly;        22. But in case no additional light is given, the first decision      shall stand, the majority of the Council having power to determine      the same.        23. In case of difficulty, respecting doctrine or principle, (if      there is not a sufficiency written to make the case clear to the      minds of the Council,) the President may inquire and obtain the      mind of the Lord by revelation.        24. The High Priests, when abroad, have power to call and organize      a Council after the manner of the foregoing to settle difficulties      when the parties, or either of them, shall request it;        25. And the said Council of High Priests shall have power to      appoint one of their own number, to preside over such Council for      the time being.        26. It shall be the duty of said Council to transmit immediately, a      copy of their proceedings, with a full statement of the testimony      accompanying their decision, to the High Council of the seat of the      First Presidency of the Church.        27. Should the parties, or either of them be dissatisfied with      the decision of said Council, they may appeal to the High Council      of the seat of the First Presidency of the Church, and have a      re-hearing, which case shall there be conducted, according to the      former pattern written, as though no such decision had been made.        28. The Council of High Priests abroad, is only to be called on the      most difficult cases of Church matters; and no common or ordinary      case is to be sufficient to call such Council.        29. The traveling or located High Priests abroad, have power to say      whether it is necessary to call such a Council or not.        30. There is a distinction between the High Council of traveling      High Priests abroad, and the traveling High Council composed of the      Twelve Apostles, in their decisions.        31. From the decision of the former there can be an appeal, but      from the decision of the latter there cannot.        32. The latter can only be called in question by the general      authorities of the Church in case of transgression.        33. Resolved, that the President or Presidents of the seat of the      First Presidency of the Church, shall have power to determine      whether any {31} such case, as may be appealed, is justly entitled      to a re-hearing, after examining the appeal and the evidences and      statements accompanying it.        34. The twelve Councilors then proceeded to cast lots or ballot, to      ascertain who should speak first, and the following was the result,      namely:--        1 Oliver Cowdery,        2 Joseph Smith,        3 Samuel H. Smith,        4 Luke Johnson        5 John S. Carter,        6 Sylvester Smith,        7 John Johnson,        8 Orson Hyde,        9 Jared Carter,        10 Joseph Smith, Sen.,        11 John Smith,        12 Martin Harris.        After prayer the conference adjourned.        Oliver Cowdery,        Orson Hyde,        Clerks.    [Sidenote: Supplementary Proceedings in the Organization of the High  Council.]    On the 18th of January I reviewed and corrected the minutes of the  organization of the High Council, and on the 19th of February, the  Council assembled according to adjournment, from the 17th, (Oliver  Cowdery and Orson Hyde, clerks,) when the revised minutes were  presented and read to the Council.
