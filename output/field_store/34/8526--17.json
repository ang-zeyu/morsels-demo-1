You won't be _you_!\"    I said bleakly, \"I'll write a letter to remind myself. Jay Allison has a  very strong sense of duty. He'll look after them for me. He won't like  it, but he'll do it, with his last breath. He's a better man than I am,  Kyla. You'd better forget about me.\" I said, wearily, \"I never existed.\"    That wasn't the end. Not nearly. She--begged, and I don't know why I put  myself through the hell of stubbornness. But in the end she ran away,  crying, and I threw myself down by the fire, cursing Forth, cursing my  own folly, but most of all cursing Jay Allison, hating my other self  with a blistering, sickening rage.           *       *       *       *       *    Coming through the outskirts of the small village the next afternoon,  the village where the airlift would meet us, we noted that the poorer  quarter was almost abandoned. Regis said bleakly, \"It's begun,\" and  dropped out of line to stand in the doorway of a silent dwelling. After  a minute he beckoned to me, and I looked inside.    I wished I hadn't. The sight would haunt me while I lived. An old man,  two young women and half a dozen children between four and fifteen years  old lay inside. The old man, one of the children, and one of the young  women were laid out neatly in clean death, shrouded, their faces covered  with green branches after the Darkovan custom for the dead. The other  young woman lay huddled near the fireplace, her coarse dress splattered  with the filthy stuff she had vomited, dying. The children--but even now  I can't think of the children without retching. One, very small, had  been in the woman's arms when she collapsed; it had squirmed free--for a  little while. The others were in an indescribable condition and the  worst of it was that one of them was still moving, feebly, long past  help. Regis turned blindly from the door and leaned against the wall,  his shoulders heaving. Not, as I first thought, in disgust, but in  grief. Tears ran over his hands and spilled down, and when I took him by  the arm to lead him away, he reeled and fell against me.    He said in a broken, blurred, choking voice, \"Oh, Lord, Jason, those  children, those children--if you ever had any doubts about what you're  doing, any doubts about what you've done, think about that, think that  you've saved a whole world from that, think that you've done something  even the Hasturs couldn't do!\"    My own throat tightened with something more than embarrassment. \"Better  wait till we know for sure whether the Terrans can carry through with  it, and you'd better get to hell away from this doorway. I'm immune, but  damn it, you're not.\" But I had to take him and lead him away, like a  child, from that house. He looked up into my face and said with burning  sincerity, \"I wonder if you believe I'd give my life, a dozen times  over, to have done that?\"    It was a curious, austere reward. But vaguely it comforted me. And then,  as we rode into the village itself, I lost myself, or tried to lose  myself, in reassuring the frightened trailmen who had never seen a city  on the ground, never seen or heard of an airplane. I avoided Kyla. I  didn't want a final word, a farewell. We had had our farewells already.           *       *       *       *       *    Forth had done a marvelous job of having quarters ready for the  trailmen, and after they were comfortably installed and reassured, I  went down wearily and dressed in Jay Allison's clothing. I looked out  the window at the distant mountains and a line from the book on  mountaineering, which I had bought as a youngster in an alien world, and  Jay had kept as a stray fragment of personality, ran in violent conflict  through my mind:    _Something hidden--go and find it_ ...    _Something lost beyond the ranges_ ...           *       *       *       *       *    I had just begun to live. Surely I deserved better than this, to vanish  when I had just discovered life. Did the man who did not know how to  live, deserve to live at all? Jay Allison--that cold man who had never  looked beyond any ranges--why should I be lost in him?    Something lost beyond the ranges ... nothing would be lost but myself. I  was beginning to loathe the overflown sense of duty which had brought me  back here. Now, when it was too late, I was bitterly regretting ... Kyla  had offered me life. Surely I would never see Kyla again.    Could I regret what I would never remember? I walked into Forth's office  as if I were going to my doom. I _was_ ...    Forth greeted me warmly.    \"Sit down and tell me all about it ...\" he insisted. I would rather not  speak. Instead, compulsively, I made it a full report ... and curious  flickers came in and out of my consciousness as I spoke. By the time I  realized I was reacting to a post-hypnotic suggestion, that in fact I  was going under hypnosis again, it was too late and I could only think  that this was worse than death because in a way I would be alive ...           *       *       *       *       *    Jay Allison sat up and meticulously straightened his cuff before  tightening his mouth in what was meant for a smile. \"I assume, then,  that the experiment was a success?\"    \"A complete success.\" Forth's voice was somewhat harsh and annoyed, but  Jay was untroubled; he had known for years that most of his subordinates  and superiors disliked him, and had long ago stopped worrying about it.    \"The trailmen agreed?\"    \"They agreed,\" Forth said, surprised. \"You don't remember anything at  all?\"    \"Scraps. Like a nightmare.\" Jay Allison looked down at the back of his  hand, flexing the fingers cautiously against pain, touching the  partially healed red slash. Forth followed the direction of his eyes and  said, not unsympathetically, \"Don't worry about your hand. I looked at  it pretty carefully. You'll have the total use of it.\"    Jay said rigidly, \"It seems to have been a pretty severe risk to take.  Did you ever stop to think what it would have meant to me, to lose the  use of my hand?\"    \"It seemed a justifiable risk, even if you had,\" Forth said dryly. \"Jay,  I've got the whole story on tape, just as you told it to me. You might  not like having a blank spot in your memory. Want to hear what your  alter ego did?\"    Jay hesitated. Then he unfolded his long legs and stood up. \"No, I don't  think I care to know.\" He waited, arrested by a twinge of a sore muscle,  and frowned.    What had happened, what would he never know, why did the random ache  bring a pain deeper than the pain of a torn nerve? Forth was watching  him, and Jay asked irritably, \"What is it?\"    \"You're one hell of a cold fish, Jay.\"    \"I don't understand you, sir.\"    \"You wouldn't,\" Forth muttered. \"Funny. I _liked_ your subsidiary  personality.\"    Jay's mouth contracted in a mirthless grin.    \"You would,\" he said, and swung quickly round.    \"Come on. If I'm going to work on that serum project I'd better inspect  the volunteers and line up the blood donors and look over old  whatshisname's papers.\"    But beyond the window the snowy ridges of the mountain, inscrutable,  caught and held his eye; a riddle and a puzzle--    \"Ridiculous,\" he said, and went to his work.           *       *       *       *       *    Four months later, Jay Allison and Randall Forth stood together,  watching the last of the disappearing planes, carrying the volunteers  back toward Carthon and their mountains.    \"I should have flown back to Carthon with them,\" Jay said moodily. Forth  watched the tall man stare at the mountain; wondered what lay behind the  contained gestures and the brooding.    He said, \"You've done enough, Jay. You've worked like the devil.  Thurmond--the Legate--sent down to say you'd get an official  commendation and a promotion for your part. That's not even mentioning  what you did in the trailmen's city.\" He put a hand on his colleague's  shoulder, but Jay shook it off impatiently.    All through the work of isolating and testing the blood fraction, Jay  had worked tirelessly and unsparingly; scarcely sleeping, but brooding;  silent, prone to fly into sudden savage rages, but painstaking. He had  overseen the trailmen with an almost fatherly solicitude--but from a  distance. He had left no stone unturned for their comfort--but refused  to see them in person except when it was unavoidable.    Forth thought, we played a dangerous game. Jay Allison had made his own  adjustment to life, and we disturbed that balance. Have we wrecked the  man? He's expendable, but damn it, what a loss! He asked, \"Well, why  _didn't_ you fly back to Carthon with them? Kendricks went along, you  know. He expected you to go until the last minute.\"    Jay did not answer. He had avoided Kendricks, the only witness to his  duality. In all his nightmare brooding, the avoidance of anyone who had  known him as Jason became a mania. Once, meeting Rafe Scott on the lower  floor of the HQ, he had turned frantically and plunged like a madman  through halls and corridors, to avoid coming face to face with the man,  finally running up four flights of stairs and taking shelter in his  rooms, with the pounding heart and bursting veins of a hunted criminal.  At last he said, \"If you've called me down here to read me the riot act  about not wanting to make another trip into the Hellers--!\"    \"No, no,\" Forth said equably, \"there's a visitor coming. Regis Hastur  sent word he wants to see you. In case you don't remember him, he was on  Project Jason--\"    \"I remember,\" Jay said grimly. It was nearly his one clear memory--the  nightmare of the ledge, his slashed hand, the shameful naked body of the  Darkovan woman, and--blurring these things, the too-handsome Darkovan  aristocrat who had banished him for Jason again. \"He's a better  psychiatrist than you are, Forth. He changed me into Jason in the  flicker of an eyelash, and it took you half a dozen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3163"],[0,"Birds and Bees, Sharp Eyes, and Other Papers (#15)"],[1,"at the outset) constantly going and coming. As they take a direct  course, there is always some chance of following them to the tree,  unless they go a long distance, and some obstruction, like a wood, or  a swamp, or a high hill, intervenes--enough chance, at any rate, to  stimulate the lookers-on to give vigorous chase as long as their wind  holds out. If the bees are successfully followed to their retreat, two  plans are feasible: either to fell the tree at once, and seek to hive  them, perhaps bring them home in the section of the tree that contains  the cavity; or to leave the tree till fall, then invite your neighbors,  and go and cut it, and see the ground flow with honey. The former course  is more business-like; but the latter is the one usually recommended by  one's friends and neighbors.    Perhaps nearly one third of all the runaway swarms leave when no one  is about, and hence are unseen and unheard, save, perchance, by some  distant laborers in the field, or by some youth ploughing on the side  of the mountain, who hears an unusual humming noise, and sees the swarm  dimly whirling by overhead, and, may be, gives chase; or he may simply  catch the sound, when he pauses, looks quickly around, but sees nothing.  When he comes in at night he tells how he heard or saw a swarm of bees  go over; and, perhaps from beneath one of the hives in the garden a  black mass of bees has disappeared during the day.    They are not partial as to the kind of tree,--pine, hemlock, elm, birch,  maple, hickory,--any tree with a good cavity high up or low down. A  swarm of mine ran away from the new patent hive I gave them, and took  up their quarters in the hollow trunk of an old apple-tree across an  adjoining field. The entrance was a mouse-hole near the ground.    Another swarm in the neighborhood deserted their keeper and went into  the cornice of an out-house that stood amid evergreens in the rear of  a large mansion. But there is no accounting for the taste of bees,  as Samson found when he discovered the swarm in the carcass, or more  probably the skeleton, of the lion he had slain.    In any given locality, especially in the more wooded and mountainous  districts, the number of swarms that thus assert their independence  forms quite a large per cent. In the Northern States these swarms very  often perish before spring; but in such a country as Florida they seem  to multiply, till bee-trees are very common. In the West, also, wild  honey is often gathered in large quantities. I noticed not long since,  that some wood-choppers on the west slope of the Coast Range felled a  tree that had several pailfuls in it.    One night on the Potomac a party of us unwittingly made our camp near  the foot of a bee-tree, which next day the winds of heaven blew down,  for our special delectation, at least so we read the sign. Another time  while sitting by a waterfall in the leafless April woods I discovered  a swarm in the top of a large hickory. I had the season before remarked  the tree as a likely place for bees, but the screen of leaves concealed  them from me. This time my former presentiment occurred to me, and,  looking sharply, sure enough there were the bees, going out and in a  large, irregular opening. In June a violent tempest of wind and rain  demolished the tree, and the honey was all lost in the creek into which  it fell. I happened along that way two or three days after the tornado,  when I saw a remnant of the swarm, those, doubtless, that escaped the  flood and those that were away when the disaster came, hanging in a  small black mass to a branch high up near where their home used to be.  They looked forlorn enough. If the queen was saved the remnant probably  sought another tree; otherwise the bees have soon died.    I have seen bees desert their hive in the spring when it was infested  with worms, or when the honey was exhausted; at such times the swarm  seems to wander aimlessly, alighting here and there, and perhaps in the  end uniting with some other colony. In case of such union, it would be  curious to know if negotiations were first opened between the parties,  and if the houseless bees are admitted at once to all the rights and  franchises of their benefactors. It would be very like the bees to have  some preliminary plan and understanding about the matter on both sides.    Bees will accommodate themselves to almost any quarters, yet no hive  seems to please them so well as a section of a hollow tree--\"gums\" as  they are called in the South and West where the sweet gum grows. In some  European countries the hive is always made from the trunk of a tree, a  suitable cavity being formed by boring. The old-fashioned straw hive is  picturesque, and a great favorite with the bees also.    The life of a swarm of bees is like an active and hazardous campaign  of an army; the ranks are being continually depleted, and continually  recruited. What adventures they have by flood and field, and what  hair-breadth escapes! A strong swarm during the honey season loses, on  an average, about four or five thousand per month, or one hundred and  fifty per day. They are overwhelmed by wind and rain, caught by spiders,  benumbed by cold, crushed by cattle, drowned in rivers and ponds, and  in many nameless ways cut off or disabled. In the spring the principal  mortality is from the cold. As the sun declines they get chilled before  they can reach home. Many fall down outside the hive, unable to get  in with their burden. One may see them come utterly spent and drop  hopelessly into the grass in front of their very doors. Before they can  rest the cold has stiffened them. I go out in April and May and pick  them up by the handfuls, their baskets loaded with pollen, and warm them  in the sun or in the house, or by the simple warmth of my hand, until  they can crawl into the hive. Heat is their life, and an apparently  lifeless bee may be revived by warming him. I have also picked them up  while rowing on the river and seen them safely to shore. It is amusing  to see them come hurrying home when there is a thunderstorm approaching.  They come piling in till the rain is upon them. Those that are overtaken  by the storm doubtless weather it as best they can in the sheltering  trees or grass. It is not probable that a bee ever gets lost by  wandering into strange and unknown parts. With their myriad eyes they  see everything; and then, their sense of locality is very acute, is,  indeed, one of their ruling traits. When a bee marks the place of his  hive, or of a bit of good pasturage in the fields or swamps, or of the  bee-hunter's box of honey on the hills or in the woods, he returns to it  as unerringly as fate.    Honey was a much more important article of food with the ancients than  it is with us. As they appear to have been unacquainted with sugar,  honey, no doubt, stood them instead. It is too rank and pungent for the  modern taste; it soon cloys upon the palate. It demands the appetite of  youth, and the strong, robust digestion of people who live much in  the open air. It is a more wholesome food than sugar, and modern  confectionery is poison beside it. Beside grape sugar, honey contains  manna, mucilage, pollen, acid, and other vegetable odoriferous  substances and juices. It is a sugar with a kind of wild natural bread  added. The manna of itself is both food and medicine, and the pungent  vegetable extracts have rare virtues. Honey promotes the excretions and  dissolves the glutinous and starchy impedimenta of the system.    Hence it is not without reason that with the ancients a land flowing  with milk and honey should mean a land abounding in all good things;  and the queen in the nursery rhyme, who lingered in the kitchen to eat  \"bread and honey\" while the \"king was in the parlor counting out his  money,\" was doing a very sensible thing. Epaminondas is said to have  rarely eaten anything but bread and honey. The Emperor Augustus one day  inquired of a centenarian how he had kept his vigor of mind and body so  long; to which the veteran replied that it was by \"oil without and honey  within.\" Cicero, in his \"Old Age,\" classes honey with meat and milk and  cheese as among the staple articles with which a well-kept farm-house  will be supplied.    Italy and Greece, in fact all the Mediterranean countries, appear to  have been famous lands for honey. Mount Hymettus, Mount Hybla, and  Mount Ida produced what may be called the classic honey of antiquity, an  article doubtless in nowise superior to our best products. Leigh Hunt's  \"Jar of Honey\" is mainly distilled from Sicilian history and literature,  Theocritus furnishing the best yield. Sicily has always been rich in  bees. Swinburne (the traveler of a hundred years ago) says the woods on  this island abounded in wild honey, and that the people also had many  hives near their houses. The idyls of Theocritus are native to the  island in this respect, and abound in bees--\"Flat-nosed bees\" as he  calls them in the Seventh Idyl--and comparisons in which comb-honey is  the standard of the most delectable of this world's goods. His goatherds  can think of no greater bliss than that the mouth be filled with  honey-combs, or to be inclosed in a chest like Daphnis and fed on the  combs of bees; and among the delectables with which Arsinoe cherishes  Adonis are \"honey-cakes,\" and other tid-bits made of \"sweet honey.\" In  the country of Theocritus this custom is said still to prevail: when a  couple are married the attendants place honey in their mouths, by which  they would symbolize the hope that their love may be as sweet to their  souls as honey to the palate.    It was fabled that Homer was suckled by a priestess whose breasts  distilled honey; and that once when Pindar lay asleep the bees dropped  honey upon his lips. In the Old Testament the food of the promised  Immanuel was to be butter and honey (there is much doubt about the  butter in the original), that"]]]
