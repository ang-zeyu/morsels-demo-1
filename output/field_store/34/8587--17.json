He stood easily, with his hands in  the pockets of his white uniform jacket, and the king was nearer death  than he knew. \"My master says: 'Because the Great King of Yitingi has  eaten up the Icheli folk: because he has crossed the borderland and  brought suffering to my people, my heart is sore. Yet, if the Great King  will pay a fine of one thousand head of cattle and will allow free  access to his country for my soldiers and my commissioners, I will live  in peace with him.'\"    The old man laughed, a wicked, cackling laugh.    \"Oh, ko!\" he chuckled; \"a great king!\"    Then the girl stepped forward.    \"Sandi,\" she said, \"once you put me to shame, for when I would have  danced for you, you slept.\"    \"To you, Daihili,\" said Sanders steadily, \"I say nothing; I make no  palaver with women, for that is not the custom or the law. Still less  do I talk with dancing girls. My business is with Limbili the king.\"    The king was talking rapidly behind his hand to a man who bent over him,  and Sanders, his hands still in his jacket pockets, snapped down the  safety catches of his automatic Colts.    All the time the girl spoke he was watching from the corners of his eyes  the man who talked with the king. He saw him disappear in the crowd of  soldiers who stood behind the squatting figures, and prepared for the  worst.    \"Since I may not dance for you,\" the girl was saying, \"my lord the king  would have you dance for me.\"    \"That is folly,\" said Sanders: then he saw the line on either side wheel  forward, and out came his pistols.    \"Crack! Crack!\"    The shot intended for the king missed him, and broke the leg of a  soldier behind.    It had been hopeless from the first; this Sanders realised with some  philosophy, as he lay stretched on the baked earth, trussed like a fowl,  and exceedingly uncomfortable. At the first shot Abiboo, obeying his  instructions, would turn the bows of the steamer down stream; this was  the only poor satisfaction he could derive from the situation.    Throughout that long day, with a pitiless sun beating down upon him, he  lay in the midst of an armed guard, waiting for the death which must  come in some dreadful form or other.    He was undismayed, for this was the logical end of the business. Toward  the evening they gave him water, which was most acceptable. From the  gossip of his guards he gathered that the evening had been chosen for  his exit, but the manner of it he must guess.    From where he lay he could see, by turning his head a little, the king's  tent, and all the afternoon men were busily engaged in heaping flat  stones upon the earth before the pavilion. They were of singular  uniformity, and would appear to be specially hewn and dressed for some  purpose. He asked his guard a question.    \"They are the dancing stones, white man,\" said the soldier, \"they come  from the mountain near the city.\"    When darkness fell a huge fire was lit; it was whilst he was watching  this that he heard of the _Zaire's_ escape, and was thankful.    He must have been dozing, exhausted in body and mind, when he was  dragged to his feet, his bonds were slipped, and he was led before the  king. Then he saw what form his torture was to take.    The flat stones were being taken from the fire with wooden pincers and  laid to form a rough pavement before the tent.    \"White man,\" said the king, as rude hands pulled off the Commissioner's  boots, \"the woman Daihili would see you dance.\"    \"Be assured, king,\" said Sanders, between his teeth, \"that some day you  shall dance in hell in more pleasant company, having first danced at the  end of a rope.\"    \"If you live through the dancing,\" said the king, \"you will be sorry.\"    A ring of soldiers with their spears pointing inward surrounded the  pavement, those on the side of the tent crouching so that their bodies  might not interrupt the Great One's view.    \"Dance,\" said the king; and Sanders was thrown forward. The first stone  he touched was only just warm, and on this he stood still till a  spear-thrust sent him to the next. It was smoking hot, and he leapt up  with a stifled cry. Down he came to another, hotter still, and leapt  again--    \"Throw water over him,\" said the amused king, when they dragged the  fainting man off the stones, his clothes smouldering where he lay in an  inert heap.    \"Now dance,\" said the king again--when out of the darkness about the  group leapt a quivering pencil of yellow light.    Ha-ha-ha-ha-a-a-a!    Abiboo's Maxim-gun was in action at a range of fifty yards, and with him  five hundred Ochori men under that chief of chiefs, Bosambo.    For a moment the Yitingi stood, and then, as with a wild yell which was  three-parts fear, the Ochori charged, the king's soldiers broke and  fled.    They carried Sanders to the steamer quickly, for the Yitingi would  re-form, being famous night fighters. Sanders, sitting on the deck of  the steamer nursing his burnt feet and swearing gently, heard the  scramble of the Ochori as they got into their canoes, heard the grunting  of his Houssas hoisting the Maxim on board, and fainted again.    \"Master,\" said Bosambo in the morning, \"many moons ago you made charge  against the Ochori, saying they would not fight. That was true, but in  those far-off days there was no chief Bosambo. Now, because of my  teaching, and because I have put fire into their stomachs, they have  defeated the soldiers of the Great King.\"    He posed magnificently, for on his shoulders was a mantle of gold thread  woven with blue, which was not his the night before.    \"Bosambo,\" said Sanders, \"though I have a score to settle with you for  breaking the law by raiding, I am grateful that the desire for the  properties of others brought you to this neighbourhood. Where did you  get that cloak?\" he demanded.    \"I stole it,\" said Bosambo frankly, \"from the tent of the Great King;  also I brought with me one of the stones upon which my lord would not  stand. I brought this, thinking that it would be evidence.\"    Sanders nodded, and bit his cigar with a little grimace. \"On which my  lord would not stand,\" was very prettily put.    \"Let me see it,\" he said; and Bosambo himself carried it to him.    It had borne the heat well enough, but rough handling had chipped a  corner; and Sanders looked at this cracked corner long and earnestly.    \"Here,\" he said, \"is an argument that no properly constituted British  Government can overlook--I see Limbili's finish.\"           *     *     *     *     *    The rainy season came round and the springtime, before Sanders again  stood in the presence of the Great King. All around him was desolation  and death. The plain was strewn with the bodies of men, and the big city  was a smoking ruin. To the left, three regiments of Houssas were  encamped; to the right, two battalions of African Rifles sat at \"chop,\"  and the snappy notes of their bugles came sharply through the still air.    \"I am an old man,\" mumbled the king; but the girl who crouched at his  side said nothing. Only her eyes never left the brick-red face of  Sanders.    \"Old you are,\" he said, \"yet not too old to die.\"    \"I am a great king,\" whined the other, \"and it is not proper that a  great king should hang.\"    \"Yet if you live,\" said Sanders, \"many other great kings will say, 'We  may commit these abominations, and because of our greatness we shall  live.'\"    \"And what of me, lord?\" said the girl in a low voice.    \"You!\" Sanders looked at her. \"Ho, hi,\" he said, as though he had just  remembered her. \"You are the dancing girl? Now we shall do nothing with  you, Daihili--because you are nothing.\"    He saw her shrink as one under a lash.    After the execution, the Colonel of the Houssas and Sanders were talking  together.    \"What I can't understand,\" said the Colonel, \"is why we suddenly decided  upon this expedition. It has been necessary for years--but why this  sudden activity?\"    Sanders grinned mysteriously.    \"A wonderful people, the English,\" he said airily. \"Old Man Limbili  steals British subjects, and I report it. 'Very sad,' says England. He  wipes out a nation. 'Deplorable!' says England. He makes me dance on the  original good-intention stones of Hades. 'Treat it as a joke,' says  England; but when I point out that these stones assay one ounce ten  penny-weights of refined gold, and that we've happed upon the richest  reef in Central Africa, there's an army here in six months!\"    I personally think that Sanders may have been a little unjust in his  point of view. After all, wars cost money, and wars of vengeance are  notoriously unprofitable.    [Footnote 2: Lo Bengola, the King of the Matabele.]            CHAPTER VII.      THE FOREST OF HAPPY DREAMS.      Sanders was tied up at a \"wooding,\" being on his way to collect taxes  and administer justice to the folk who dwell on the lower Isisi River.    By the river-side the little steamer was moored. There was a tiny bay  here, and the swift currents of the river were broken to a gentle flow;  none the less, he inspected the shore-ends of the wire hawsers before he  crossed the narrow plank that led to the deck of the _Zaire_. The wood  was stacked on the deck, ready for to-morrow's run. The new"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35554"],[0,"A Voice of Warning (#15)"],[1," to any such thing. And when you have obtained  this answer, ask them how they themselves were called and commissioned  to preach the Gospel, and they will be at a loss to answer you, and  will finally tell you that the Bible commissioned them, saying--\"Go ye  into all the world,\" etc. Thus, you see, all who have no direct  personal revelation from the King of heaven, either by angels, the  voice of God, or the spirit of prophecy, are acting under authority  which was given to others, who are dead, and their commission stolen,  and their authority usurped; and the King will say--\"Peter I know, and  Paul I know, I commissioned them, but who are you? I know you not, I  never spoke to you in my life; indeed you believed it was not  necessary for me to speak in your day. Therefore you never sought in  faith for any revelation, and I never gave you any; and even when I  spake to others, you mocked them, and called them impostors, and  persecuted them, because they testified of the things I had said unto  them, therefore depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,  prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was an hungered, and ye  fed me not; I was naked, and ye clothed me not; I was a stranger, and  ye took me not in; sick and in prison and ye visited me not.\" \"Ah!  Lord, when did we fail in any of these things?\" \"Inasmuch as you have  not done it unto the least of these my brethren (taking them for  impostors, because they testified of the things which I had revealed  unto them), ye have not done it unto me.\" But to return: having  examined the kingdom of God as to its offices and ordinances, and  having discovered the only means of adoption into it, let us examine  more fully what are the blessings, privileges, and enjoyments of its  citizens. You have already seen that they were to cast out devils,  speak with new tongues, heal the sick by the laying on of hands in the  name of Jesus, as well as to see visions, dream dreams, prophesy, etc.    But let us look at the kingdom in its organized state, and see whether  these promises were verified to Jew and Gentile, wherever the kingdom  of God was found in all ages of the world.    Paul writing, first, \"To the church of God at Corinth;\" second, \"To  them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus;\" third, \"To them who are  called to be saints;\" and fourth, \"To all that in every place call on  the name of Jesus Christ our Lord,\" says to them all, in 1 Corinthians,  xii, 1: \"Now, concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have  you ignorant.\" And then, continuing his instructions, a few verses  further on, he says: \"But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to  every man to profit withal; for to one is given, by the Spirit, the  word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;  to another faith by the same Spirit; to another, the gifts of healing  by the same Spirit; to another, the working of miracles; to another,  prophecy; to another, discerning of spirits; to another, divers kinds  of tongues; to another, the interpretation of tongues; but all these  worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man  severally as He (Christ) will. For as the body is one, and hath many  members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one  body; so also is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into  one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free;  and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. For the body is not  one member, but many. If the foot shall say, because I am not the  hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? And if  the ear shall say, because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is  it therefore not of the body? If the whole body were an eye, where  were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?  But now hath Got set the members, everyone of them in the body, as it  hath pleased Him. And if they were all one member, where were the  body?\" I reply, it would not exist. \"But now are they many members,  yet but one body. And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need  of thee; nor again, the head to the feet, I have no need of you. Nay,  much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble, are  necessary; and those members of the body which we think to be less  honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor: and our uncomely  parts have more abundant comeliness. For our comely parts have no  need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more  abundant honor to that part which lacked: that there should be no  schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care for  one another. And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer  with it; or one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it.  Now, ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. And God  hath set some in the church, first, apostles; secondarily, prophets;  thirdly, teachers; after that, miracles, then gifts of healings,  helps, governments, diversities of tongues. Are all apostles? are all  prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? Have all the  gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? But  covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more  excellent way.\" From the thirteenth verse of the above chapter, we  learn that the Apostle is still speaking to the whole church in all  ages, whether Jew or Gentile, bond or free, even all who should ever  compose the body of Christ, and showing that Christ's body consisted  of many members, baptized by one spirit into one body, possessing all  these different gifts, some one gift, and some another: and then  expressly says, that one member possessing one gift, should not say to  another member possessing another gift, we have no need of thee.    And having shown that it required apostles, prophets, evangelists,  pastors, and teachers; together with the gifts of prophecy, miracles,  healing, and all other gifts, to compose the church, or body of  Christ, in any age, whether Jew or Gentile, bond or free; and having  utterly forbidden any of the members ever to say, of any of these  gifts: \"We have no need of thee,\" He declares the body never could be  perfected without all of them, and that if they were done away, there  would be no body, that is, no church of Christ in existence. Having  shown all these things clearly, he exhorts them to covet earnestly the  best gifts. And in the thirteenth chapter, exhorts them to faith,  hope, and charity, without which all these gifts would avail them  nothing: and in the fourteenth chapter repeats the exhortation:  \"Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye  may prophesy.\" Again, in Ephesians, i, 17, Paul prays that the Lord  would give unto the church the Spirit of WISDOM and of REVELATION, in  the KNOWLEDGE of God. Again, in Ephesians, iv, he tells them there is  one body and one Lord, one Spirit, one faith, and one baptism; and  that Christ ascended up on high, led captivity captive, and gave gifts  to men. And He gave some apostles; and some, prophets; and some,  evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers. And if the reader inquire  what these gifts or offices were for, let him read the twelfth verse:  \"For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for  the edifying of the body of Christ.\" And if he inquire how long these  were to continue, the thirteenth verse says: \"Till we all come in the  unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a  perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of  Christ.\" And if he still inquire what further object Christ had in  giving these gifts, let him read the fourteenth verse: \"That we  henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about  with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning  craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.\"    Now, without these gifts and offices, first, the saints cannot be  perfected; second, the work of the ministry cannot proceed; third, the  body of Christ cannot be edified; and fourth, there is nothing to  prevent them from being carried about with every wind of doctrine.  Now, I boldly declare that the cause of all the division, confusion,  jars, discord, and animosities; and the fruitful source of so many  faiths, lords, baptisms, and spirits; and of the understanding being  darkened; and of men being alienated from the life of God, through the  ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their hearts,  is, because they have neither apostles, prophets, nor gifts, inspired  from on high, to whom they give heed; for, if they had such gifts, and  would give heed unto them, they would be built up in one body, in the  pure doctrine of Christ, having one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and  one hope of their calling; yea, they would be edified, built up unto  Christ in all things, in whom the whole body, fitly joined together,  would grow into an holy temple in the Lord.    But so long as the cunning craftiness of men can persuade them that  they have no need of these things, so long they can toss them about  with every wind of doctrine, just as they please.    Now, reader, I have done our examination of the kingdom of God, as it  existed in the Apostles' days; and we cannot look at it in any other  age, until renewed again in the last days, for it never did, nor never  will exist, without apostles and prophets, and all the other gifts of  the Spirit.    Were we to take a view of the churches, from the days that inspiration  ceased until now, we should see nothing like the kingdom which we have  been viewing with such admiration and delight. But instead of apostles  and prophets, we should see false teachers, whom men had heaped to  themselves; and instead of the gifts of the Spirit, we should see the  wisdom of men; and instead of the Holy Ghost, many false spirits;  instead of the ordinances"]]]
