[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30756"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 3 (of 3) (#15)"],[1,"we have  spoken above, set forth the rustics. The porphyries and alabasters, and  the other harder stones of mingled quality, represent the middle  classes, if we are to deal in comparisons: and by means of these the  ancients adorned their temples with incrustations and ornaments in a  magnificent manner. And after these come the chalcedonies and  sardonyxes, &c., which are so transparent that there can be seen no spot  in them.[14] Thus men endowed with nobility lead a life in which no spot  can be found.\"    Canute or Coeur de Lion (I name not Godfrey or St. Louis) would have  dashed their sceptres against the lips of a man who should have dared to  utter to them flattery such as this. But in the fifteenth century it was  rendered and accepted as a matter of course, and the tempers which  delighted in it necessarily took pleasure also in every vulgar or false  means, of taking worldly superiority. And among such false means  largeness of scale in the dwelling-house was of course one of the  easiest and most direct. All persons, however senseless or dull, could  appreciate size: it required some exertion of intelligence to enter into  the spirit of the quaint carving of the Gothic times, but none to  perceive that one heap of stones was higher than another.[15] And  therefore, while in the execution and manner of work the Renaissance  builders zealously vindicated for themselves the attribute of cold and  superior learning, they appealed for such approbation as they needed  from the multitude, to the lowest possible standard of taste; and while  the older workman lavished his labor on the minute niche and narrow  casement, on the doorways no higher than the head, and the contracted  angles of the turreted chamber, the Renaissance builder spared such cost  and toil in his detail, that he might spend it in bringing larger stones  from a distance; and restricted himself to rustication and five orders,  that he might load the ground with colossal piers, and raise an  ambitious barrenness of architecture, as inanimate as it was gigantic,  above the feasts and follies of the powerful or the rich. The Titanic  insanity extended itself also into ecclesiastical design: the principal  church in Italy was built with little idea of any other admirableness  than that which was to result from its being huge; and the religious  impressions of those who enter it are to this day supposed to be  dependent, in a great degree, on their discovering that they cannot span  the thumbs of the statues which sustain the vessels for holy water.    Sec. XLV. It is easy to understand how an architecture which thus appealed  not less to the lowest instincts of dulness than to the subtlest pride  of learning, rapidly found acceptance with a large body of mankind; and  how the spacious pomp of the new manner of design came to be eagerly  adopted by the luxurious aristocracies, not only of Venice, but of the  other countries of Christendom, now gradually gathering themselves into  that insolent and festering isolation, against which the cry of the poor  sounded hourly in more ominous unison, bursting at last into thunder  (mark where,--first among the planted walks and plashing fountains of  the palace wherein the Renaissance luxury attained its utmost height in  Europe, Versailles); that cry, mingling so much piteousness with its  wrath and indignation, \"Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of  the wealthy, and with the despitefulness of the proud.\"    Sec. XLVI. But of all the evidence bearing upon this subject presented by  the various arts of the fifteenth century, none is so interesting or so  conclusive as that deduced from its tombs. For, exactly in proportion as  the pride of life became more insolent, the fear of death became more  servile; and the difference in the manner in which the men of early and  later days adorned the sepulchre, confesses a still greater difference  in their manner of regarding death. To those he came as the comforter  and the friend, rest in his right hand, hope in his left; to these as  the humiliator, the spoiler, and the avenger. And, therefore, we find  the early tombs at once simple and lovely in adornment, severe and  solemn in their expression; confessing the power, and accepting the  peace, of death, openly and joyfully; and in all their symbols marking  that the hope of resurrection lay only in Christ's righteousness; signed  always with this simple utterance of the dead, \"I will lay me down in  peace, and take my rest; for it is thou, Lord, only that makest me dwell  in safety.\" But the tombs of the later ages are a ghastly struggle of  mean pride and miserable terror: the one mustering the statues of the  Virtues about the tomb, disguising the sarcophagus with delicate  sculpture, polishing the false periods of the elaborate epitaph, and  filling with strained animation the features of the portrait statue; and  the other summoning underneath, out of the niche or from behind the  curtain, the frowning skull, or scythed skeleton, or some other more  terrible image of the enemy in whose defiance the whiteness of the  sepulchre had been set to shine above the whiteness of the ashes.    Sec. XLVII. This change in the feeling with which sepulchral monuments  were designed, from the eleventh to the eighteenth centuries, has been  common to the whole of Europe. But, as Venice is in other respects the  centre of the Renaissance system, so also she exhibits this change in  the manner of the sepulchral monument under circumstances peculiarly  calculated to teach us its true character. For the severe guard which,  in earlier times, she put upon every tendency to personal pomp and  ambition, renders the tombs of her ancient monarchs as remarkable for  modesty and simplicity as for their religious feeling; so that, in this  respect, they are separated by a considerable interval from the more  costly monuments erected at the same periods to the kings or nobles of  other European states. In later times, on the other hand, as the piety  of the Venetians diminished, their pride overleaped all limits, and the  tombs which in recent epochs, were erected for men who had lived only to  impoverish or disgrace the state, were as much more magnificent than  those contemporaneously erected for the nobles of Europe, as the  monuments for the great Doges had been humbler. When, in addition to  this, we reflect that the art of sculpture, considered as expressive of  emotion, was at a low ebb in Venice in the twelfth century, and that in  the seventeenth she took the lead in Italy in luxurious work, we shall  at once see the chain of examples through which the change of feeling is  expressed, must present more remarkable extremes here than it can in any  other city; extremes so startling that their impressiveness cannot be  diminished, while their intelligibility is greatly increased, by the  large number of intermediate types which have fortunately been  preserved.    It would, however, too much weary the general reader if, without  illustrations, I were to endeavor to lead him step by step through the  aisles of St. John and Paul; and I shall therefore confine myself to a  slight notice of those features in sepulchral architecture generally  which are especially illustrative of the matter at present in hand, and  point out the order in which, if possible, the traveller should visit  the tombs in Venice, so as to be most deeply impressed with the true  character of the lessons they convey.    Sec. XLVIII. I have not such an acquaintance with the modes of entombment  or memorial in the earliest ages of Christianity as would justify me in  making any general statement respecting them: but it seems to me that  the perfect type of a Christian tomb was not developed until toward the  thirteenth century, sooner or later according to the civilization of  each country; that perfect type consisting in the raised and perfectly  visible sarcophagus of stone, bearing upon it a recumbent figure, and  the whole covered by a canopy. Before that type was entirely developed,  and in the more ordinary tombs contemporary with it, we find the simple  sarcophagus, often with only a rough block of stone for its lid,  sometimes with a low-gabled lid like a cottage roof, derived from  Egyptian forms, and bearing, either on the sides or the lid, at least a  sculpture of the cross, and sometimes the name of the deceased, and date  of erection of the tomb. In more elaborate examples rich  figure-sculpture is gradually introduced; and in the perfect period the  sarcophagus, even when it does not bear any recumbent figure, has  generally a rich sculpture on its sides representing an angel presenting  the dead, in person and dress as he lived, to Christ or to the Madonna,  with lateral figures, sometimes of saints, sometimes--as in the tombs of  the Dukes of Burgundy at Dijon--of mourners; but in Venice almost always  representing the Annunciation, the angel being placed at one angle of  the sarcophagus, and the Madonna at the other. The canopy, in a very  simple foursquare form, or as an arch over a recess, is added above the  sarcophagus, long before the life-size recumbent figure appears resting  upon it. By the time that the sculptors had acquired skill enough to  give much expression to this figure, the canopy attains an exquisite  symmetry and richness; and, in the most elaborate examples, is  surmounted by a statue, generally small, representing the dead person in  the full strength and pride of life, while the recumbent figure shows  him as he lay in death. And, at this point, the perfect type of the  Gothic tomb is reached.    Sec. XLIX. Of the simple sarcophagus tomb there are many exquisite  examples both at Venice and Verona; the most interesting in Venice are  those which are set in the recesses of the rude brick front of the Church  of St. John and Paul, ornamented only, for the most part, with two crosses  set in circles, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30775"],[0,"Elements of Chemistry, (#15)"],[1," cubical inch, in the common standard temperature and pressure mentioned  above, so that 34,242 cubical inches of acid gas are produced by the  combustion of one pound of charcoal.    I might multiply these experiments, and show by a numerous succession of  facts, that all acids are formed by the combustion of certain  substances; but I am prevented from doing so in place, by the plan  which I have laid down, of proceeding only from facts already  ascertained, to such as are unknown, and of drawing my examples only  from circumstances already explained. In the mean time, however, the  three examples above cited may suffice for giving a clear and accurate  conception of the manner in which acids are formed. By these it may be  clearly seen, that oxygen is an element common to them all, which  constitutes their acidity; and that they differ from each other,  according to the nature of the oxygenated or acidified substance. We  must therefore, in every acid, carefully distinguish between the  acidifiable, base, which Mr de Morveau calls the radical, and the  acidifiing principle or oxygen.    FOOTNOTES:    [11] It may be proper to remark, though here omitted by the author,  that, in conformity with the general principles of the new nomenclature,  this acid is by Mr Lavoisier and his coleagues called the carbonic acid,  and when in the aeriform state carbonic acid gas. E.          CHAP. VI.    _Of the Nomenclature of Acids in general, and particularly of those  drawn from Nitre and Sea-Salt._      It becomes extremely easy, from the principles laid down in the  preceding chapter, to establish a systematic nomenclature for the acids:  The word _acid_, being used as a generic term, each acid falls to be  distinguished in language, as in nature, by the name of its base or  radical. Thus, we give the generic name of acids to the products of the  combustion or oxygenation of phosphorus, of sulphur, and of charcoal;  and these products are respectively named, the _phosphoric acid_, the  _sulphuric acid_, and the _carbonic acid_.    There is however, a remarkable circumstance in the oxygenation of  combustible bodies, and of a part of such bodies as are convertible into  acids, that they are susceptible of different degrees of saturation with  oxygen, and that the resulting acids, though formed by the union of the  same elements, are possessed of different properties, depending upon  that difference of proportion. Of this, the phosphoric acid, and more  especially the sulphuric, furnishes us with examples. When sulphur is  combined with a small proportion of oxygen, it forms, in this first or  lower degree of oxygenation, a volatile acid, having a penetrating  odour, and possessed of very particular qualities. By a larger  proportion of oxygen, it is changed into a fixed, heavy acid, without  any odour, and which, by combination with other bodies, gives products  quite different from those furnished by the former. In this instance,  the principles of our nomenclature seem to fail; and it seems difficult  to derive such terms from the name of the acidifiable base, as shall  distinctly express these two degrees of saturation, or oxygenation,  without circumlocution. By reflection, however, upon the subject, or  perhaps rather from the necessity of the case, we have thought it  allowable to express these varieties in the oxygenation of the acids, by  simply varying the termination of their specific names. The volatile  acid produced from sulphur was anciently known to Stahl under the name  of _sulphurous_ acid[12]. We have preserved that term for this acid  from sulphur under-saturated with oxygen; and distinguish the other, or  completely saturated or oxygenated acid, by the name of _sulphuric_  acid. We shall therefore say, in this new chemical language, that  sulphur, in combining with oxygen, is susceptible of two degrees of  saturation; that the first, or lesser degree, constitutes sulphurous  acid, which is volatile and penetrating; whilst the second, or higher  degree of saturation, produces sulphuric acid, which is fixed and  inodorous. We shall adopt this difference of termination for all the  acids which assume several degrees of saturation. Hence we have a  phosphorous and a phosphoric acid, an acetous and an acetic acid; and so  on, for others in similar circumstances.    This part of chemical science would have been extremely simple, and the  nomenclature of the acids would not have been at all perplexed, as it is  now in the old nomenclature, if the base or radical of each acid had  been known when the acid itself was discovered. Thus, for instance,  phosphorus being a known substance before the discovery of its acid,  this latter was rightly distinguished by a term drawn from the name of  its acidifiable base. But when, on the contrary, an acid happened to be  discovered before its base, or rather, when the acidifiable base from  which it was formed remained unknown, names were adopted for the two,  which have not the smallest connection; and thus, not only the memory  became burthened with useless appellations, but even the minds of  students, nay even of experienced chemists, became filled with false  ideas, which time and reflection alone is capable of eradicating. We may  give an instance of this confusion with respect to the acid sulphur: The  former chemists having procured this acid from the vitriol of iron, gave  it the name of the vitriolic acid from the name of the substance which  produced it; and they were then ignorant that the acid procured from  sulphur by combustion was exactly the same.    The same thing happened with the aeriform acid formerly called _fixed  air_; it not being known that this acid was the result of combining  charcoal with oxygen, a variety of denominations have been given to it,  not one of which conveys just ideas of its nature or origin. We have  found it extremely easy to correct and modify the ancient language with  respect to these acids proceeding from known bases, having converted the  name of _vitriolic acid_ into that of _sulphuric_, and the name of  _fixed air_ into that of _carbonic acid_; but it is impossible to follow  this plan with the acids whose bases are still unknown; with these we  have been obliged to use a contrary plan, and, instead of forming the  name of the acid from that of its base, have been forced to denominate  the unknown base from the name of the known acid, as happens in the case  of the acid which is procured from sea salt.    To disengage this acid from the alkaline base with which it is combined,  we have only to pour sulphuric acid upon sea-salt, immediately a brisk  effervescence takes place, white vapours arise, of a very penetrating  odour, and, by only gently heating the mixture, all the acid is driven  off. As, in the common temperature and pressure of our atmosphere, this  acid is naturally in the state of gas, we must use particular  precautions for retaining it in proper vessels. For small experiments,  the most simple and most commodious apparatus consists of a small retort  G, (Pl. V. Fig. 5.), into which the sea-salt is introduced, well  dried[13], we then pour on some concentrated sulphuric acid, and  immediately introduce the beak of the retort under little jars or  bell-glasses A, (same Plate and Fig.), previously filled with  quicksilver. In proportion as the acid gas is disengaged, it passes into  the jar, and gets to the top of the quicksilver, which it displaces.  When the disengagement of the gas slackens, a gentle heat is applied to  the retort, and gradually increased till nothing more passes over. This  acid gas has a very strong affinity with water, which absorbs an  enormous quantity of it, as is proved by introducing a very thin layer  of water into the glass which contains the gas; for, in an instant, the  whole acid gas disappears, and combines with the water.    This latter circumstance is taken advantage of in laboratories and  manufactures, on purpose to obtain the acid of sea-salt in a liquid  form; and for this purpose the apparatus (Pl. IV. Fig. 1.) is employed.  It consists, 1st, of a tubulated retort A, into which the sea-salt, and  after it the sulphuric acid, are introduced through the opening H; 2d,  of the baloon or recipient c, b, intended for containing the small  quantity of liquid which passes over during the process; and, 3d, of a  set of bottles, with two mouths, L, L, L, L, half filled with water,  intended for absorbing the gas disengaged by the distillation. This  apparatus will be more amply described in the latter part of this work.    Although we have not yet been able, either to compose or to decompound  this acid of sea-salt, we cannot have the smallest doubt that it, like  all other acids, is composed by the union of oxygen with an acidifiable  base. We have therefore called this unknown substance the _muriatic  base_, or _muriatic radical_, deriving this name, after the example of  Mr Bergman and Mr de Morveau, from the Latin word _muria_, which was  anciently used to signify sea-salt. Thus, without being able exactly to  determine the component parts of _muriatic acid_, we design, by that  term, a volatile acid, which retains the form of gas in the common  temperature and pressure of our atmosphere, which combines with great  facility, and in great quantity, with water, and whose acidifiable base  adheres so very intimately with oxygen, that no method has hitherto been  devised for separating them. If ever this acidifiable base of the  muriatic acid is discovered to be a known substance, though now unknown  in that capacity, it will be requisite to change its present  denomination for one analogous with that of its base.    In common with sulphuric acid, and several other acids, the muriatic is  capable of different degrees of oxygenation; but the excess of oxygen  produces quite contrary effects upon it from what the same circumstance  produces upon the acid of sulphur.
