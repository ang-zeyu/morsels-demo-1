Fighting is out  of the question; but we can do him some damage without giving him  a chance of striking a blow at us. As he has lighted Glen Cairn,  so shall he see fires blazing round his own castle of Aberfilly.  We will not retaliate by hanging his crofters and vassals; but if  he or any of his men-at-arms falls into our hands, we will have  blood for blood.\"    In the course of the afternoon Archie saw his chief and begged  leave to take his troop away for some time, telling Sir William of  the cruel treatment which the Kerrs had dealt at Glen Cairn, and  his determination to retaliate for the deed.    \"Aberfilly is a strong castle, Archie,\" Wallace said; \"at least so  people say, for I have never seen it, so far does it lie removed  from the main roads. But unless by stratagem, I doubt if my force  is strong enough to capture it; nor would I attack were I sure of  capturing it without the loss of a man.  The nobles and landowners  stand aloof from me; but it may be that after I have wrested some  more strong places from the English, they may join me. But I would  not on any account war against one of them now. Half the great  families are united by ties of blood or marriage. The Kerrs, we  know, are related to the Comyns and other powerful families; and  did I lift a hand against them, adieu to my chance of being joined  by the great nobles. No; openly hostile as many of them are, I must  let them go their way, and confine my efforts to attacking their  friends the English. Then they will have no excuse of personal  feud for taking side against the cause of Scotland. But this does  not apply to you. Everyone knows that there has long been a blood  feud between the Forbeses and the Kerrs, and any damage you may  do them will be counted as a private feud. I think it is a rash  adventure that you are undertaking with but a handful of boys,  although it is true that a boy can fire a roof or drive off a  bullock as well as a man. However, this I will promise you, that  if you should get into any scrape I will come with what speed I  can to your rescue, even if it embroil me with half the nobles of  Scotland. You embroiled yourself with all the power of England in  my behalf, and you will not find me slack in the hour of need. But  if I join in the fray it is to rescue my friend Archie Forbes, and  not to war against John Kerr, the ally of the English, and my own  enemy.\"    Archie warmly thanked his leader, but assured him that he had no  thought of placing himself in any great peril.    \"I am not going to fight,\" he said, \"for the Kerr and his retainers  could eat us up; we shall trust to our legs and our knowledge of  the mountains.\"    After dark Archie and his band started, and arrived within ten miles  of Aberfilly on the following morning.  They rested till noon, and  then again set out. When they approached one of the outlying farms  of the Kerrs, Archie halted his band, and, accompanied by four of  the stoutest and tallest of their number, went on to the crofter's  house. The man came to the door.    \"What would you, young sir?\" he said to Archie.    \"I would,\" Archie said, \"that you bear a message from me to your  lord.\"    \"I know not what your message may be; but frankly, I would rather  that you bore it yourself, especially if it be of a nature to anger  Sir John.\"    \"The message is this,\" Archie said quietly: \"tell him that Archibald  Forbes bids him defiance, and that he will retort upon him and his  the cruelties which he has wrought in Glen Cairn, and that he will  rest not night nor day until he has revenge for the innocent blood  shed and rooftrees ruthlessly burned.\"    \"Then,\" the crofter said bluntly, \"if you be Archibald Forbes, you  may even take your message yourself. Sir John cares not much upon  whose head his wrath lights, and I care not to appear before him  as a willing messenger on such an errand.\"    \"You may tell him,\" Archie said quietly, \"that you are no willing  messenger; for that I told you that unless you did my errand your  house should, before morning, be a heap of smoking ashes. I have  a following hard by, and will keep my word.\"    The crofter hesitated.    \"Do my bidding; and I promise you that whatever may befall the  other vassals of the Kerrs, you shall go free and unharmed.\"    \"Well, if needs must, it must,\" the crofter said; \"and I will  do your bidding, young sir--partly because I care not to see my  house in ruins, but more because I have heard of you as a valiant  youth who fought stoutly by the side of Wallace at Lanark and  Ayr--though, seeing that you are but a lad, I marvel much that you  should be able to hold your own in such wild company. Although  as a vassal of the Kerrs I must needs follow their banner, I need  not tell you, since you have lived so long at Glen Cairn, that the  Kerrs are feared rather than loved, and that there is many a man  among us who would lief that our lord fought not by the side of the  English. However, we must needs dance as he plays; and now I will  put on my bonnet and do your errand. Sir John can hardly blame me  greatly for doing what I needs must.\"    Great was the wrath of Sir John Kerr when his vassal reported to  him the message with which he had been charged, and in his savage  fury he was with difficulty dissuaded from ordering him to be hung  for bringing such a message. His principal retainers ventured,  however, to point out that the man had acted upon compulsion, and  that the present was not the time, when he might at any moment  have to call upon them to take the field, to anger his vassals, who  would assuredly resent the undeserved death of one of their number.    \"It is past all bearing,\" the knight said furiously, \"that an insolent  boy like this should first wound me in the streets of Lanark, and  should then cast his defiance in my teeth--a landless rascal,  whose father I killed, and whose den of a castle I but a month ago  gave to the flames. He must be mad to dare to set his power against  mine. I was a fool that I did not stamp him out long ago; but woe  betide him when we next meet!  Had it not been that I was served  by a fool\"--and here the angry knight turned to his henchman, Red  Roy--\"this would not have happened. Who could have thought that  a man of your years could have suffered himself to be fooled by a  boy, and to bring me tales that this insolent upstart was a poor  stupid lout! By Heavens! to be thus badly served is enough to make  one mad!\"    \"Well, Sir John,\" the man grumbled, \"the best man will be sometimes  in error. I have done good service for you and yours, and yet ever  since we met this boy outside the gates of Lanark you have never  ceased to twit me concerning him.  Rest secure that no such error  shall occur again, and that the next time I meet him I will pay him  alike for the wound he gave you and for the anger he has brought  upon my head. If you will give orders I will start at daybreak  with twenty men.  I will take up his trail at the cottage of John  Frazer, and will not give up the search until I have overtaken and  slain him.\"    \"Do so,\" the knight replied, \"and I will forgive your having  been so easily fooled. But this fellow may have some of Wallace's  followers with him, and contemptible as the rabble are, we had best  be on our guard.  Send round to all my vassals, and tell them to  keep good watch and ward, and keep a party of retainers under arms  all night in readiness to sally out in case of alarm.\"    The night, however, passed quietly. The next day the knight sallied  out with a strong party of retainers, and searched the woods and  lower slopes of the hill, but could find no signs of Archie and  his followers, and at nightfall returned to the castle in a rage,  declaring that the defiance sent him was a mere piece of insolent  bravado. Nevertheless, he kept the horses again saddled all night  ready to issue out at the slightest alarm.  Soon after midnight  flames suddenly burst out at a dozen of the homesteads. At the  warder's shout of alarm Sir John Kerr and his men-at-arms instantly  mounted. The gate was thrown open and the drawbridge lowered, and  Sir John rode out at the head of his following.  He was within a  few feet of the outer end of the drawbridge when the chains which  supported this suddenly snapped. The drawbridge fell into the moat,  plunging all those upon it into the water.    Archie, with his band, after detaching some of their number to fire  the homesteads, had crept up unperceived in the darkness to the  end of the drawbridge, and had noiselessly cut the two projecting  beams upon which its end rested when it was lowered. He had intended  to carry out this plan on the previous night, but when darkness set  in not a breath of wind was stirring, and the night was so still  that he deemed that the operation of sawing through the beams could  not be effected without attracting the attention of the warders  on the wall, and had therefore retreated far up in the recesses of  the hills. The next night, however, was windy, and well suited to  his purpose, and the work had been carried out without attracting  the attention of the warders. When Kerr and his men-at-arms rode  out, the whole weight of the drawbridge and of the horsemen crossing  it was thrown entirely upon the chains, and these yielded to a  strain far greater than they were calculated to support.    The instant the men-at-arms were precipitated into the moat, Archie  and his companions, who had been lying down near its edge, leapt to  their feet, and opened fire with their bows and arrows upon them.  It was well for Sir John and his retainers that they had not stopped to  buckle on their defensive armour. Had they done so every man must  have been drowned in the deep waters. As it was, several were killed  with the arrows, and two or three by the hoofs of the struggling  horses.

It resembles the Central Asian states in      its majority Muslim population, high structural unemployment, and low      standard of living. The economy's most prominent products are cotton, oil,      and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline      for several years. With foreign assistance, the oil industry might generate      the funds needed to spur industrial development. However, civil unrest,      marked by armed conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region between Muslim      Azeris and Christian Armenians, makes foreign investors wary. Azerbaijan      accounts for 1.5% to 2% of the capital stock and output of the former Soviet      Union. Although immediate economic prospects are not favorable because of      civil strife, lack of economic reform, political disputes about new economic      arrangements, and the skittishness of foreign investors, Azerbaijan's      economic performance was the best of all former Soviet republics in 1991      largely because of its reliance on domestic resources for industrial output.
