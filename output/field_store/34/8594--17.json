In the afternoon Capt. Gray and Mr. Hoskins in the    jolly-boat went on shore to take a short view of the country....      \"19 (May). ... Capt. Gray gave this river the name of Columbia's    river, and the north side of the entrance Cape Hancock, the south side    of the entrance, Adams Point.\"    The day following (20th) Gray left the river, crossing the bar after  several attempts, and sailed northward to rejoin the Adventurer.    Completing his cargo of furs, Gray again visited Canton, and by his  former route returned to Boston. He married on the 4th of February,  1794, and died, while in command of a coasting vessel, in the summer of  1806, at Charleston, S. C., leaving a wife and four daughters.    On March 27, 1846, a committee of Congress considered a petition of  Martha Gray, his widow, who applied for a pension for his services to  the United States in war and as an explorer. The committee in question  considered that the most suitable return for Gray's valuable services  would be the grant of a township in Oregon, but as surveys had not yet  been made it deferred such action as then inexpedient. It recommended,  however, that Congress should pass a bill giving Mrs. Gray the sum of  five hundred dollars per annum. In its report the committee said that  Gray was the first discoverer of the country; that such discovery  conferred on the United States a title to the whole basin drained by the  river, known then as Oregon Territory; that the hazard and labor of the  journey were great, especially in the unsurveyed bar of the Columbia.    Americans did not confine their title to the valley of the Columbia to  the mere right of discovery without occupation and use, but they  proceeded to develop its capacities for trade and settlement. From the  year 1797 American vessels regularly entered the Columbia and traded  with its natives.    When in 1826 the rights of the United States in regard to Oregon were  formulated and made the subject of consideration by plenipotentiaries on  the parts of Great Britain and the United States, the claims of the  latter were urged on three grounds, the most important or first being  from their own proper right, which was founded on Gray's discovery of  the Columbia River.    If Vancouver had discovered the Columbia prior to Gray, it is impossible  to say what complications and results would have arisen in connection  with the extension and development of the United States. It is therefore  a source of endless gratification that Captain Robert Gray, by his  courage, enterprise, and seamanship, in discovering and entering the  Columbia, ultimately secured to the United States this fertile  territory, almost twice as extensive in area as Great Britian.    With its six hundred and sixty thousand of inhabitants, its great  cities, its enormous accumulations of wealth, the young empire added to  the United States through Robert Gray is fast shaping into substance the  golden visions of the enthusiastic Kendrick.          V.    CAPTAIN MERIWETHER LEWIS AND LIEUT. WILLIAM CLARK.    FIRST TRANS-CONTINENTAL EXPLORERS OF THE UNITED STATES.      The burning genius and intense patriotism of Thomas Jefferson found  their most brilliant setting in his draft of the most famous paper in  the world, the Declaration of Independence. If Jefferson thus struck the  keynote of freedom for America, he was not content with a free people  restricted in their habitat to the eastern half of the continent, and in  his ripest life gave no more conspicuous evidence of his foresight and  statesmanship than in the inauguration of a policy which comprehended in  its scope the exploration and settlement of the entire trans-Mississippi  region. He not only urged and completed the purchase of Louisiana, but  sought the extent of its natural resources, appreciated the undeveloped  wealth of the great West, and drafted a scheme of land divisions and  settlement which foreshadowed the beneficial homestead legislation of  later years.    Jefferson was for years interested in the exploration of the western  parts of North America, which were absolutely unknown save the  coast-line of the Pacific. In 1784, while in Paris, he met John Ledyard,  who had made an unsuccessful effort to organize a company for the fur  trade on the western coast of America. Ledyard, by Jefferson's advice  and intercession, attempted to cross by land to Kamschatka, and thence  to the west coast of America, and across country to the Missouri River.  Ledyard's arrest in Siberia and expulsion from the country by the  Russian Government ended this plan. In 1802 Jefferson initiated, through  the American Philosophical Society, a subscription for the exploration  of the western parts of North America, by ascending the Missouri River,  crossing the Rocky Mountains, and descending the nearest river to the  Pacific Ocean. Although only two persons were to go, Meriwether Lewis  urgently sought the appointment, and with M. Andre Michaux the voyage  was commenced; but his companion being recalled by the French minister  at Washington, the journey was abandoned.    On January 18, 1803, Jefferson, then President, recommended in a  confidential message to Congress modifications of the act regarding  trade with Indians, and with the view of extending its provisions to the  Indians on the Missouri, recommended the exploration of the Missouri  River to its source, the crossing of the Rocky Mountains, and descent to  the Pacific Ocean by the best water communication. Congress approved the  plan and voted money for its accomplishment. Captain Meriwether Lewis,  of the United States Army, who had been for nearly two years private  secretary to the President, renewed his solicitations for command, which  was given him.    Jefferson showed his versatility in the instructions to Captain Lewis,  which are a model of fulness and clearness. The route to be followed,  natural products and possibilities--animal, vegetable, and  mineral--climatic conditions, commercial routes, the soil and face of  the country, were all dwelt on. The character, customs, disposition,  territory occupied, tribal relations, means of subsistence, language,  clothing, disease, moral attributes, laws, traditions, religion,  intellectuality, extent and means of trade, war methods, with respect to  the Indian tribes visited, were to be studied and reported. The  topography of the country was to be accurately determined,  astronomically and otherwise, and the maps and notes multiplied to avoid  total loss. The good-will of the chiefs was to be sought, peaceful  methods pursued, and the inflexible opposition of any extensive force  promising bloodshed was to be met by withdrawal and retreat. The country  then being outside the limits of the United States, passports from the  ministers of Great Britain, Spain, and France were furnished.    Meriwether Lewis was born August 17, 1774, near Charlottesville, Va.,  being the son of John Lewis and Miss Meriwether, and grand-nephew of  Fielding Lewis, who married a sister of George Washington. Volunteering,  at the age of twenty, in the militia called out by Washington to put  down the Shay rising, he was made ensign of the Second Sub-Legion May  1, 1795, and appointed in First Infantry November, 1796, where he rose  to be paymaster and captain in 1800. He was a considerate and efficient  officer, an expert hunter, versed in natural history, familiar with  Indian character and customs. Appreciating his deficiencies in certain  branches of science important in this expeditionary duty, he at once  sought instruction from competent professors.    Jefferson describes Lewis as follows: \"Of courage undaunted, possessing  a firmness and perseverance of purpose which nothing but impossibilities  could divert from its direction, ... honest, disinterested, liberal, of  sound understanding and a fidelity to truth so scrupulous that whatever  he should report would be as certain as seen ourselves.\" The management  and success of the expedition, it may here be said, fully justified the  selection by and encomiums of Jefferson.    Lewis, given his choice of associate, selected William Clark, who was  appointed by Jefferson second lieutenant of artillery. Clark was a  brother of George Rogers Clark, by whose valor and sagacity the Illinois  or Northwest Territory was secured to the United States, and this  connection made his selection for further extension of the country seem  most fitting. Moreover young Clark had qualifications and experiences  which strongly commended him to Lewis. Born in Virginia, August 1, 1770,  William Clark had a thorough knowledge of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36124"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 4, No. 1, August, 1851 (#15)"],[1,"dwelt at great length on Hogarth, and pointed out how much       of his success lay in the simple conventional morals of his       works; gave a graphic analysis of the _Marriage a la Mode_       and the _Idle and Industrious Apprentices_; and humorously       set forth Hogarth's pretensions to the sublime in historical       painting. Smollett was dismissed in a few pleasant       paragraphs. Fielding called out the hearty admiration of the       author of _Vanity Fair_; and amidst the panegyric there were       some admirable passages, notably one on the scorn and hatred       Richardson and Fielding unaffectedly felt for each other,       and the sincerity which may animate even the most       contemptuous criticism. The opinions Thackeray stamps with       his authority, we constantly find open to question; but it       is not as a Course of Criticism that these Lectures have       their inexpressible charm, and it would be possible for a       man to dissent _in toto_ from the views put forth, while at       the same time he held them to be among the most delightful       lectures he ever listened to.\"           STERNE AND GOLDSMITH.         In the sixth and last lecture of the course, Mr. Thackeray's       subjects were Sterne and Goldsmith. He stigmatized severely       all Sterne's relations with women, showed up the sham       sensibility which wept through his writings, dwelt on the       perilous thing it was to make a market of one's sorrows, and       sell the deepest experiences of one's life at so much per       volume, and wound up with an emphatic condemnation of the       pruriency of Sterne's writings, contrasting that pruriency       with the purity of Dickens. All the generosity, sweetness,       and improvidence of Goldsmith's Irish nature were earnestly       and genially presented.    This course of lectures has been described as \"a review of the  humorists, by their master,\" but Mr. Thackeray is not a humorist--at  least humor is not his distinguishing quality; he is a cold satirist,  sneering at humanity, and in all his writings never exhibiting a spark  of the genial fire which should commend an author to the affections of  his readers. Gentlemen may be amused by him--he may be even  punctilious and sincere in the observance of all honorable  conduct--but judging him by his works, he is one of the last men  living whom any person with the instincts of a gentleman would admit  to his friendship. Some of his books are amazingly clever, but others,  as the _Kickleburys on the Rhine_, are but unredeemable vulgarity. He  has been taken up very much by the snobs--a class somewhat remarkable  for misapprehensions of their real relations--and we find the snobs of  this country as well as of England lauding the satirist as an enemy of  their own peculiar caste. This is a mistake: Mr. Thackeray has painted  to the life the sentimental snob, indeed, but he is himself a chief of  a different and far less endurable class in this division of the  race--_the snob cynical and supercilious_.          ALRED.    WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE,    BY ELMINA WALDO CAREY.          Do you remember, Alred dear,        The peach-tree's cool and ample shade,      Where first our hearts learned love and fear,        And vows of constancy were made?        The peach-tree stands there, now as then,        Its shadow just as dim and mild,      And over all the sacred glen        The vines of strawberries run wild.        Still all about the water's edge        Beds of green flags in beauty lie,      And, sloping towards the elder-hedge,        Are fields of graceful waving rye.        But, Alred dear, not by our feet        Will the round clover-heads be pressed,      For years must pass before we meet        In that dear valley of the west.        Sometimes my heart is filled with fear,        Yet if not, Alred, in that land,      'Tis bliss to know, in some bright sphere        You'll wait to take my trembling hand.          CHRISTOPHER NORTH ON ANIMAL MAGNETISM.      The July number of _Blackwood's Magazine_ has a long paper under the  title of _What is Mesmerism?_ in which the question is discussed with  ingenuity, apparent candor, and occasional eloquence. The editor,  however, does not altogether agree with his contributor, and adds to  the article the following postscript. Undoubtedly a large proportion  of the \"professors of magnetism\" are mere mountebanks, and the  pretenders to clairvoyance may in all cases probably be set down as  knaves, or as very ignorant or feeble-minded persons. Nevertheless, we  cannot quite agree with Professor Wilson in all his propositions:         WHAT IS MESMERISM?         \"It must be admitted that our excellent correspondent has       set forth the claims of 'Adolphe' and 'Alexis,' and similar       interesting abstractions, to the powers of omnipresence and       omniscience, with great candor and becoming gravity. We are       sorry that we cannot follow what many of our readers may       consider so excellent an example. We have no faith in those       dear creatures without surnames: we have no faith in animal       magnetism, either in its lesser or in its larger       pretensions; but we have an unbounded faith in the       imbecility, infatuation, vanity, credulity, and knavery of       which human nature is capable. And we are of opinion that       there is not a single well-authenticated mesmeric phenomenon       which is not fully explicable by the operation of one or       more of these causes, or of the whole of them taken in       conjunction.         \"The question in regard to mesmerism is two-fold: _first_,       how is the mesmeric prostration to be accounted for? and       _secondly_, how is it to be disposed of? It may be accounted       for, we conceive, by the natural tendencies just recited,       without its being necessary to postulate any new or unknown       agency; it may be disposed of by the influence of public       opinion, which would very soon put a stop to these pitiable       exhibitions, and very soon extinguish the magnetizer's power       and the patient's susceptibility, if it were but to visit       the performers with the contempt and reprobation they       deserve. A few words on each of these heads may not be out       of place, as a qualifying postscript to the foregoing       letter, which, in our opinion, treats the mesmeric       superstition with far too much indulgence.         \"I. The existence of any physical force or fluid in man or       in nature, by which the mesmeric phenomena are induced, has       been distinctly disproved by every carefully conducted       experiment. _No person was ever magnetized when totally       unsuspicious of the operation of which he was the subject._       This is conclusive; because a physical agent, which never       does, _of itself_ and unheralded, produce any effect, is no       physical agent at all. Then, again, let certain persons be       prepared for the magnetic condition, and aware of what is       expected of them, and the effects are equally produced,       whether the intended influence be exerted or not. It seems       simply ridiculous to postulate an _odylic_ (we should like       to be favored with the derivation of this word) fluid to       account for phenomena which show themselves just as       conspicuously when no such fluid is or can be in operation.         \"But it is argued by some of the advocates of mesmeric       influence, that their agent, though perhaps not physical, is       at any rate moral--that the will, or some spiritual energy       on the part of the mesmerist, is the power by which his       victims are entranced and rendered obedient to his bidding.       Here, too, all the well-authenticated cases establish a       totally different conclusion. They prove that the will or       spiritual power of the mesmerist has _of itself_ no       ascendency or control whatsoever over the body or mind of       his victim. Every well-guarded series of experiments has       exhibited the mesmerist and his patient at cross-purposes       with each other--the patient frequently doing those things       which the mesmerist was desirous he should not do, and not       doing those things which the operator was desirous he should       do. As for the buffoonery begotten by mesmerism on       phrenology, this exhibition can scarcely be expected to       provoke much astonishment, or credence, or comment, except       among professional artists themselves--        'Like Katterfelto, with their hair on end,      At their own wonders, _wondering for their bread_!'         \"The true explanation of mesmerism is to be found, as we       have said, in the weakness or infatuation of human nature       itself. No other causes are at all necessary to account for       the mesmeric prostration. There is far more craziness, both       physical and moral, in man than he usually gives himself       credit for. The reservoir of human folly may be in a great       measure occult, but it is always full; and all that       silliness, whether of body or mind, at any time wants, is       _to get its cue_.         \"These general remarks are of course more applicable to some       individuals than they are to others. In soft and weak       natures, where the nervous system is subject to cataleptic       seizures, mental and bodily prostration is frequently almost       the normal condition. Such of our readers as may have       frequented mesmeric exhibitions must have observed a kind of       _semi-humanity_ visible in the expression and demeanor of       most of the subjects whom the professional operators carry       about with them. These poor creatures are at all times ready       to imbibe the magnetic stupefaction, because it is only by       an effort that they are ever free from it. There is always       at work within them an occult tendency to       self-a"]]]
