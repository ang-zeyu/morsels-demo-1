Ain't lick um much, hardly  any. Chillun hab easy time. All I been require to do was tote coal to  Mosser when he ready fer light. Adam Mack and me, we been de fire boy.  Mosser gib Adam to Mister Eberson. I ain't gib to nobody--'specially.    \"All white people ain't treat slave good. Some make um wuk haa'd all  day, and 'cuss um plenty. De slave who been live near Steamboat Landing  had rough time when dere old Miss git in tantrum. She been 'nuse to  trabbel all over de world, and when she come back, she call all de slave  together, and say: 'When I come, de debbil come.'    \"We family ain't had all dat to worry 'bout. Behave yourself and you all  right. Plenty to eat, plenty to drink. Run 'round and enjoy yourself if  you got uh mind to. Wuk when you wuk, play when you play. Ole Miss 'nuse  to 'tend all de sick nigger. Go from house to house, wid lee pair of  scale and bottle ram jam pack of calomel. Give lee nigger big dose of  castor oil, and dey git well quick, mighty quick.    \"Old Mosser 'nuse to keep all de likker in de world on hand. Had to keep  plenty, 'cause he friend drink lot and nigger drink lot too. He ain't  drink so much heself. Old nigger been live on de place call John Fraser,  same one I tell you 'bout, dat cut all dem tree down. John sure been  slick. When Mosser call fer he fine likker to hand 'round, John come  back and tell him all gone. Mosser want to know why. John make reply:  'Why, Mosser you know you hab Mister Binyard to supper last night and he  finish all dat good stuff. You know how Mr. Binyard drink. Sometime he  drink when your back t'un (turned). How you 'speck um to last?' Mosser  scratch he haid, and say, yes he know how Mr. Binyard drink, and mebbe  dats why de last bottle empty. He ain't satisfy, but he can't prove dat  John drink um.    \"Mosser 'nuse to keep de whiskey down in de cellar by de barrel, and he  draw um off in bottle when he need um and take um upstair to de wine  room. De nigger dat wuk 'round de house and de yaa'd, help dem self out  de barrel when dey feel tired. Mosser 'spect dem to do dat--dey 'title  (entitle) to um. Whiskey been kinder ration in dem day.    \"Nigger jest know haa'd time now. Ain't been dat way when I been lee  boy. You ain't lacking fer nutting den dat you really need. No tussling  'bout fer yourself and knock 'round from pillar to post. If we need  anything slavery time we ax (ask) fer um--make we want known. Any  feeling ably white man who hab slave, gib we what we need. No puzzling  'tall (at all).    \"Ain't I tell you 'bout dat time when John Fraser take overcoat from  Mosser right on Meeting Street? No. Well, it been uh cold day, and  Mosser tell John Fraser to meet him on de corner Meeting and Broad wid  de overcoat, 'cause he going out dat night and he want 'um. John been  wid Abel Wright, and de two of dem walk down de street to meet de Major.  John say to Abel: 'I cold as de debbil, and I going to ax Mosser fer he  coat.' Abel say: 'You crazy. He send for um and he sure ain't going, to  gib you he good new coat anyhow.' John say: 'You wait and see.'    \"Soon Mosser come in sight. When he see John he git mad right off 'cause  John hab on he overcoat. Before he kin say uh wud (word) John speak up  fast. He say: 'Yes, Mosser I got on your coat 'cause it mighty cold. Got  to excuse old nigger. You hab 'nother coat. I ain't got nutting but dis  here jumper. Go on home Mosser and git torrer (the other) coat. I going  to keep dis. He jest fit me. Go on home.'    \"Mosser study fer uh while, den he laugh. He see how keen de coat fit  John, and he know it been cold sure 'nough. John look sekker (just like)  dress up monkey in dat long tail overcoat, and dat make de Major laugh  all de more.

Murray_    Mike Lawrence belonged to what he calls \"de Murray state\" in slavery  times. He was one of Major William Meggett Murray's \"fire boys\", who was  charged with the specific duty of bringing live coals to the master  whenever he wanted to light his pipe. Mike was only a small lad when war  was declared, but he remembers numerous stories relating to \"Maussa's  niggers\", some of which are worth recording. He speaks from first hand  knowledge, he says, for the things that he tells about happened during  his childhood and still stand out clearly in his mind.    Here is one of Mike's stories:    \"Old John Drayton was de smaa'test of all de nigger de Maussa place. He  wuk so haa'd some time dat Maussa jest got to stop him, or he kill  heself. I nebber see sech uh man fer wuk in all my life. Maussa t'ink uh  lot ob um, 'cause he been uh good field hand, beside know lot 'bout  cutting 'ood (wood) and building fence. What been more old John play fer  all de dance on de plantation. He fair (really) mek fiddle talk. When  Maussa gib uh dance he always call 'pon John.    \"Yas, suh dat man sure could play. W'en he saw down on de fiddle and  pull out dat june (tune) 'Oh, de Monkey Marry to de Babboon Sister,' he  mek paa'son (parson) dance.    \"One day more dan all, Maussa Murray send wud (word) to John dat de cow  der break out ob de pasture, and he got to mend de fence quick. But John  done promise some nigger on Fenwick Island to play fer uh dance, and he  steal paa't (path) and go. (This expression means to go away by  stealth). Dat been Friday night and Maussa say John got to finish de  fence by sundown the next day.    \"W'en Old John ain't show up Saturday morning, Maussa ax eberybody where  he been and de nigger all band togedder (together) and tell Maussa dat  dey see him leabe in uh boat to go fish and he ain't seen since. Maussa  been worry sure 'nough den 'cause he t'ink John might be drown'. He  'gage (engage) four man to shoot gun all ober creek to mek John body  rise. Atter dat day drag all 'bout in de gutter.    \"Maussa gone bed wid heaby haa't (heart) 'cause he been very fond ob Old  John.    \"John come back from Fenwick Island early Monday morning and 'fore day  clean he in de 'odd der cut fence rail. Now, one hundred rail been call  uh good day wuk, but Old John decide he going to do better den dat. He  find fibe (five) tree grow close togedder, and he cut piece out ob every  one. Den he chop at the biggest tree till he fall, and dat tree knock  all de rest ober wid um.    \"W'en all dem tree fall togedder, it make sech uh noise, dat ole Maussa  hear um in he bed, and hasten to dress so he kin see w'at der go on in  de woods.    \"Maussa saddle de horse and ride 'till he git to de center ob de noise  and dere he see Old John cutting 'way like he crazy. Maussa been mad  sure 'nough, but den he glad to see John ain't drown'. He staa't to say  some t'ing but Old John interrupt, and sing out: 'Go 'way Maussa, I  ain't got time to talk wid you now.'    \"Old John den gather up five ax, and go to de five tree laying down on  de ground. He dribe uh ax in ebery tree and den grab uh neaby maul. W'en  Maussa look on, he tek de maul and run from one tree to torrer (one to  the other) and quick as he hit de ax, de tree split wide open. Maussa  staa't to say some t'ing 'gain but John ain't let him talk. He say: 'Go  on home to Missus, Maussa, I too 'shame, great God I too 'shame! Go on  home.'    \"Maussa tun (turn) 'round in he track and go home widout uh wud, 'cause  he see de old nigger ain't going to gib him any satisfaction 'bout  Saturday. W'en he go back in de 'ood dat evening he check up and find  dat Old John done cut five hundred rail.

As  such, it also represents a species that has evolved away from the  procyonid norm and portrays the extreme in climate specialization.  Olingos, _Bassaricyon gabbii_ (Table 1), may be similar to _Potos  flavus_ in this respect (see also Table 10). This suggests that of the  extant procyonids, _Nasua nasua_, _Nasua narica_, and _Procyon  cancrivorus_ have retained metabolic and behavioral characteristics  that are closest to those of their Miocene ancestors.      _Evolution of High Basal Metabolic Rate_    Between the time that _Cyonasua_ appeared and the Panamanian land  bridge was established in the upper Pliocene (4 to 5 million years  ago), northern climates continued their gradual cooling. This, along  with ongoing elevation of the continents and continuous modification  of their mountain ranges, served to shrink the tropical forest and  create pockets of climatic instability within it and on its edges  (Darlington, 1963:578-596; Marshall, 1988). In areas of instability,  selection would have favored traits that provided for a broader range  of thermal tolerance: higher [.H]_{b}, improved insulative quality of  pelt, a more sharply defined molt cycle, improved capacity for  evaporative cooling, greater D_{d}, and higher r_{max}. Consequently,  by the upper Pliocene, two metabolically distinct groups of procyonids  could have been established: those species with low [.H]_{b} living in  climatically stable forests and those with higher [.H]_{b} living in  unstable tropical, subtropical, and perhaps temperate climates.    _Procyon lotor_ is the only extant procyonid with high [.H]_{b}.  _Procyon cancrivorus_ is its congeneric counterpart in Central and  South America (Table 1), and the two species are sympatric in Panama  and Costa Rica. However, in terms of its metabolism, thermal  conductance, molt, diversity of diet, r_{max}, and climatic  distribution, _Procyon cancrivorus_ shares more in common with other  procyonids than it does with _Procyon lotor_ (Tables 7, 11, 12; Figure  8). This suggests that metabolically _Procyon lotor_ portrays a  divergent line of this genus that arose as the result of a series of  mutations that gave rise to different metabolic characteristics. This  view is in keeping with a recent phylogenetic analysis of this family  that shows the genus _Procyon_ to be highly derived (Decker and  Wozencraft, 1991). Consequently, it would be instructive and would add  to our knowledge of the evolution of climatic adaptation to know more  about the genetic relatedness of these two species as well as their  historical relationship.    Genus _Procyon_ appears in the fossil record (Hemphillian and Blancan  ages; Baskin, 1982) prior to Pleistocene glaciations. During the  Pleistocene, there were four different glacial advances and retreats  in a relatively short time period (the first appearing little more  than a million years ago; Darlington, 1963:578-596; Webb, 1985a;  Marshall, 1988). Glacial retreats created pulses of time during which  subtropic and temperate climates advanced toward the poles into areas  with large seasonal differences in light/dark cycles, whereas glacial  advances pushed these climates southward into areas having smaller  seasonal differences in light/dark cycles (Raven and Axelrod, 1975;  Webb, 1977, 1978; Marshall, 1988). Those members of the genus  _Procyon_ caught in these wide latitudinal fluctuations would have  experienced conditions favorable to continued selection for  characteristics conducive to physiologic adaptation to a wide range of  climatic conditions. _Procyon lotor_ is the only member of its genus  to have survived this selective process, and as we have seen, it does  possess traits that adapt it to a wide range of climatic conditions.  Primary among these is its higher [.H]_{b}, which provides it with  advantages not shared with other procyonids (see earlier discussion).  Three other adaptations also have had a profound influence on _Procyon  lotor_'s ability to generalize its use of climate: (1) the increased  insulative quality of its pelt coupled with its sharply defined molt  cycle, which allows for a large annual change in thermal conductance;  (2) its annual cycle of fat storage; and (3) a diverse high-quality  diet. The first two of these adaptations required evolution of  neuroendocrine pathways capable of responding to time-dependent  environmental cues such as changing day length, changing temperature,  etc. Such conditions would have been available as selective stimuli in  high-latitude forests and savannas of interglacial periods. _Procyon  lotor_'s elevated basal metabolic rate would have increased its  overall energy requirement, and it makes good intuitive sense,  therefore, that evolution during the Pleistocene also would have  favored selection of a diverse diet containing many items of high  nutritive value.        SUMMARY      Our analysis has illustrated that within Procyonidae there are two  distinct modes of metabolic adaptation to climate. One is typified by  those species with low [.H]_{b}'s (_Bassariscus astutus_, _Nasua  nasua_, _Nasua narica_, _Procyon cancrivorus_, and _Potos flavus_),  and the other by _Procyon lotor_ with its higher [.H]_{b}. Those with  low [.H]_{b}'s have more restricted geographic distributions, and,  with the exception of _Bassariscus astutus_, they are all confined to  tropical and subtropical areas. The fossil history of this family  indicates that it had its origins in tropical forests of North and  Central America. This indicates that those procyonids whose  distributions are still primarily restricted to tropical forests share  many of the metabolic adaptations characteristic of their ancestors.  We speculate, therefore, that ancestral procyonids had a lower than  predicted [.H]_{b}, a pelt with modest to poor insulative quality,  good thermogenic ability but poor heat tolerance, modest to poor  capacity for evaporative cooling, no well-defined molt cycle, no  cyclic period of fattening, nocturnal habits, and a modestly diverse  diet of high-enough quality to provide for an average reproductive  potential. Although this pedigree contributed to the success of this  family in tropical and subtropical forests, it limited the ability of  its members to expand their distributions into cooler, less stable  climates. Viewed in this perspective, _Procyon lotor_'s high basal  metabolic rate, extraordinarily diverse diet, well-defined cyclic  changes in fat content and thermal conductance, high level of heat  tolerance, high capacity for evaporative cooling, and high  reproductive potential all stand out in sharp contrast to the  condition described for other procyonids. This suggests that the North  American raccoon represents culmination of a divergent evolutionary  event that has given this species the ability to break out of the old  procyonid mold and carry the family into new habitats and climates.
