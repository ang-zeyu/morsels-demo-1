He recognized how slight  were her resources, and he became at once an eager adherent of French  intervention in northern Italy. Charles Albert of Piedmont and Mazzini  were both acclaiming an Italy won by the Italians, but Manin foresaw,  what Cavour was later to recognize, that foreign allies were absolutely  essential.    France, however, was in a most unsettled condition, her ministers  did not wish to see a strong state of upper Italy on their southern  borders; they were already longing to annex Savoy, and yet as good  republicans they felt themselves bound to aid the revolted states  against Austrian tyranny. Manin made overtures for an alliance, at first  merely feeling his way, but as the summer progressed, and the need  grew more and more apparent, by definite overtures. The French Consul  at Venice was most hopeful. He said to Manin, \"It is well known that  the sympathy of France, when she possesses liberty of action, is never  without results.\" In reply Manin said that he hoped \"that the united  efforts of the different Italian states, the ardor which animates the  people of the Peninsula, will suffice to expel the enemy; if not, we  shall have recourse to the generosity of France. Meanwhile, we should  be glad to see at once some French vessels in the Adriatic, and I beg  that you will lose no time in communicating our wishes to the foreign  ministry.\"    Manin wished to convene a popular assembly as soon after he assumed  office as possible, and on June 3 such a deliberative body met, its  members having been elected by universal suffrage from Venice and the  free districts of the Dogado. Their first important task was to decide  whether they would join with Lombardy in union under Piedmont's King.  Manin believed that the decision as to such a step ought to be deferred  until the war was ended, but a strong party opposed his opinion. His  partisans entered into a bitter fight with the opposition, for a time  it looked as though the split in the Assembly would lead to civil war.  Manin rose and implored those who were his friends to place no further  obstacles in the path of fusion. Moved by his passionate appeal for  harmony the Assembly passed the act of fusion with few negative votes,  and at the same time resolved that \"Daniel Manin had deserved well of  his country.\" He spoke again, saying, \"While the foreigner is still in  Italy, for God's sake let there be no more talk of parties. When we are  rid of him we will discuss these matters among ourselves as brothers.  This is the only recompense I ask of you.\"    The Assembly elected Manin head of the new ministry, but he declined on  the ground that he had always been a republican and would feel out of  place as a royal minister. In addition his health demanded that he seek  some rest.    The new Venetian ministry lasted until August 7, when the Royal  Commissioners assumed office. Unfortunately Charles Albert was already  being beaten back in Lombardy, and on August 9 signed the armistice of  Salasco, by which all claims to Venice were renounced. When word came  to the city the Venetians were dumbfounded, then mad with indignation.  Finally they rushed to Manin's house, calling for him and denouncing  the Royal Commissioners. Manin told the excited people that he would  stake his head upon the Commissioners' patriotism. He went to see them  and then addressed the citizens again. \"The day after tomorrow,\" he  said, \"the Assembly will meet to appoint a new government. For these  forty-eight hours I govern.\" The people dispersed, satisfied now that  their idol was at their head again. The Assembly when it met wished to  make Manin dictator, but he pleaded his ignorance of military matters,  and a triumvirate was formed, made up of Admiral Graziani, Colonel  Cavedalis, and himself.    Just when it seemed as though France was finally deciding to come to the  aid of northern Italy, England intervened and proposed a plan of joint  mediation. To add to this obstacle Charles Albert declared that Italy  would act for herself, and the chances of Venice winning a foreign ally  were reduced to practically nothing. Italians from Naples to Piedmont  were showing themselves to be individual heroes, but their efforts were  ineffectual without a general leader. The Romans were hampered by the  inaction of the Pope. Pius IX. had promised great things in the cause of  national independence, but when the German Cardinals told him that in  case he declared war against Austria he would forfeit their allegiance  his enthusiasm waned. The Austrian general, Radetzky, was slowly  winning back the fields lost in Lombardy, Vicenza fell, then Milan, and  Austria felt herself strong enough to declare a blockade of Venice. As  the summer of 1848 ended it became clear that Venice would be left to  herself, that the tide of revolution in the other states was already  ebbing, and that Piedmont had shot her bolt. Manin still hoped that some  ally would succor the small city in her war against the great empire,  but whether an ally should come or not he was determined that Venice  should set an example of resistance that would show Europe how well  freedom was deserved.    The city, in its state of siege, stood in the greatest need of money.  Manin had only to ask, and all classes brought forth their savings,  their heirlooms, whatever they had of value, to give to the cause. The  old aristocracy, the boys in the street, every one who loved Venice,  made their sacrifices gladly, reverently. Private citizens clothed many  of the soldiers, palaces were given for public uses, Manin gave all  his family plate and would accept no salary; General Pepe, the aged  commander-in-chief, gave a picture by Leonardo da Vinci that was his  dearest possession. No one thought of his own need, all thought solely  of keeping Venice free. If she returned to bondage they cared little  what became of them.    Ugo Bassi, the heroic priest who was later to fight with Mazzini on  the walls of Rome, and still later to die at the hands of Austrian  executioners, preached daily to the Venetians. There was no lack of  noble spirits who recalled to them the great glories of the past. But  above and beyond all the others the people loved Manin, they had come to  link his name indissolubly with that of their city, he was their father,  they his devoted children. If ever a man merited such devotion it was  Manin. With the cares of his city weighing perpetually on his mind,  planning, advising, encouraging, he fought the ravages of disease that  crippled his resources, and spent the nights watching by the bedside of  his sick child. At one time, in November, there was fear for his life,  and Venice shook with apprehension. He recovered and took up the burden  of government with his marvelous stoic calm.    In spite of the fact that the city was besieged and money scarce, Venice  was characteristically buoyant. The theater, the Fenice, was crowded;  fetes and carnivals, always patriotically fervent, were of daily  occurrence; processions, music, all that appealed to the eye and the ear  and the imagination fed the Venetian love of glory. Their city was free,  and the people awakened the echoes of that great life which had been  theirs before captivity, they forgot so far as they could that they  had ever slumbered. On the morning of November 17 Mass was celebrated  in memory of all the martyrs to Italian liberty, and that same night  the entire city was thrilled by a wonderful display of the Aurora  Borealis which set the snow-caps of the Alps vividly before their eyes.  They lived on faith, and hope, and trust in Daniel Manin, and found  propitious omens with sea-dwellers' skill.    In December some Roman volunteers left Venice to join their fellow  citizens, and with them went Ugo Bassi. He bade Manin a touching  farewell, foreseeing what lay before both his own city and Venice.  He had venerated the Pope who had held out such noble hopes to all  Italians, but he could do so no more, and in his place put the hero of  Venice. As he left the city he kissed the stone plate on Manin's door,  saying, \"Next to God and Italy, before the Pope--Manin.\"    The Assembly which had voted for fusion with Piedmont was dissolved,  and a new one elected. Manin was determined that his government should  have the fullest power over the city. He deemed this essential to any  hopes of ultimate success. Some members of the Assembly disagreed with  him, and advocated restriction. \"It is not a question of power,\" replied  Manin, \"but of saving the country. If we are to be hampered on every  turn by forms and limitations, we cannot act with the promptitude and  vigor needful for the preservation of public order (I beg pardon of  whoever the expression may offend), and our defense depends more upon  that than upon the force of arms.\"    The people got wind of the fact that certain of the Assembly were  jealous of Manin's power, and they marched to the Ducal Palace. Manin  spoke and dispersed them, but again and again they gathered, making  various demonstrations of their trust in him. At length he heard that  they had devised a plan to march into the Council Hall and coerce the  Deputies who wanted to fetter their \"caro Manin.\" Fearful of civic  strife Manin called his son, and standing alone with him, sword in hand,  at the door of the Palace, told the people that they could only enter  after killing father and son. He bade them go quietly home, and they  obeyed. That night he issued a proclamation. \"Brothers, you have caused  me great pain to-day. To show your affection for me you have risen in  tumult, yet you know how I hate tumult ... as you say you love me, I  entreat you to show it by your actions.... To-morrow let there be no  shouting, no meetings. Remain at home. Trust in the government and the  Assembly, who regard your welfare as dearer to them than life.\" He was  always the father speaking to his children.    The "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4361"],[0,"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman — Complete (#15)"],[1,"were  neither courts nor clients, so necessity forced him to turn his  thoughts to something else, and quicksilver became his hobby.  In  the spring of 1848 an appeal came to our office from San Jose, which  compelled the Governor to go up in person.  Lieutenant Loeser and I,  with a couple of soldiers, went along.  At San Jose the Governor  held some kind of a court, in which Ricord and the alcalde had a  warm dispute about a certain mine which Ricord, as a member of the  Larkin Company, had opened within the limits claimed by the New  Almaden Company.  On our way up we had visited the ground, and were  therefore better prepared to understand the controversy.  We had  found at New Almaden Mr. Walkinshaw, a fine Scotch gentleman, the  resident agent of Mr. Forbes.  He had built in the valley, near a  small stream, a few board-houses, and some four or five furnaces for  the distillation of the mercury.  These were very simple in their  structure, being composed of whalers' kettles, set in masonry.  These kettles were filled with broken ore about the size of  McAdam-stone, mingled with lime.  Another kettle, reversed, formed  the lid, and the seam was luted with clay.  On applying heat, the  mercury was volatilized and carried into a chimney-stack, where it  condensed and flowed back into a reservoir, and then was led in  pipes into another kettle outside.  After witnessing this process,  we visited the mine itself, which outcropped near the apex of the  hill, about a thousand feet above the furnaces.  We found wagons  hauling the mineral down the hill and returning empty, and in the  mines quite a number of Sonora miners were blasting and driving for  the beautiful ore (cinnabar). It was then, and is now, a most  valuable mine. The adit of the mine was at the apex of the hill,  which drooped off to the north.  We rode along this hill, and saw  where many openings had been begun, but these, proving of little or  no value, had been abandoned.  Three miles beyond, on the west face  of the bill, we came to the opening of the \"Larkin Company.\"  There  was evidence of a good deal of work, but the mine itself was filled  up by what seemed a land-slide.  The question involved in the  lawsuit before the alcalde at San Jose was, first, whether the mine  was or was not on the land belonging to the New Almaden property;  and, next, whether the company had complied with all the conditions  of the mite laws of Mexico, which were construed to be still in  force in California.    These laws required that any one who discovered a valuable mine on  private land should first file with the alcalde, or judge of the  district, a notice and claim for the benefits of such discovery;  then the mine was to be opened and followed for a distance of at  least one hundred feet within a specified time, and the claimants  must take out samples of the mineral and deposit the same with the  alcalde, who was then required to inspect personally the mine, to  see that it fulfilled all the conditions of the law, before he  could give a written title.  In this case the alcalde had been to  the mine and had possession of samples of the ore; but, as the  mouth of the mine was closed up, as alleged, from the act of God,  by a land-slide, it was contended by Ricord and his associates that  it was competent to prove by good witnesses that the mine had been  opened into the hill one hundred feet, and that, by no negligence  of theirs, it had caved in.  It was generally understood that  Robert J. Walker, United States Secretary of the Treasury, was then  a partner in this mining company; and a vessel, the bark Gray  Eagle, was ready at San Francisco to sail for New York with the  title-papers on which to base a joint-stock company for speculative  uses.  I think the alcalde was satisfied that the law had been  complied with, that he had given the necessary papers, and, as at  that time there was nothing developed to show fraud, the Governor  (Mason) did not interfere.  At that date there was no public house  or tavern in San Jose where we could stop, so we started toward  Santa Cruz and encamped about ten miles out, to the west of the  town, where we fell in with another party of explorers, of whom  Ruckel, of San Francisco, was the head; and after supper, as we sat  around the camp-fire, the conversation turned on quicksilver in  general, and the result of the contest in San Jose in particular.  Mason was relating to Ruckel the points and the arguments of  Ricord, that the company should not suffer from an act of God,  viz., the caving in of the mouth of the mine, when a man named  Cash, a fellow who had once been in the quartermaster's employ as a  teamster, spoke up: \"Governor Mason, did Judge Ricord say that?\"  \"Yes,\" said the Governor; and then Cash related how he and another  man, whose name he gave, had been employed by Ricord to undermine a  heavy rock that rested above the mouth of the mine, so that it  tumbled down, carrying with it a large quantity of earth, and  completely filled it up, as we had seen; \"and,\" said Cash, \"it took  us three days of the hardest kind of work.\"  This was the act of  God, and on the papers procured from the alcalde at that time, I  understand, was built a huge speculation, by which thousands of  dollars changed hands in the United States and were lost.  This  happened long before the celebrated McGarrahan claim, which has  produced so much noise, and which still is being prosecuted in the  courts and in Congress.    On the next day we crossed over the Santa Cruz Mountains, from  which we had sublime views of the scenery, first looking east  toward the lower Bay of San Francisco, with the bright plains of  Santa Clara and San Jose, and then to the west upon the ocean, the  town of Monterey being visible sixty miles off.  If my memory is  correct, we beheld from that mountain the firing of a salute from  the battery at Monterey, and counted the number of guns from the  white puffs of smoke, but could not hear the sound.  That night we  slept on piles of wheat in a mill at Soquel, near Santa Cruz, and,  our supplies being short, I advised that we should make an early  start next morning, so as to reach the ranch of Don Juan Antonio  Vallejo, a particular friend, who had a large and valuable  cattle-ranch on the Pajaro River, about twenty miles on our way to  Monterey.  Accordingly, we were off by the first light of day, and  by nine o'clock we had reached the ranch.  It was on a high point  of the plateau, overlooking the plain of the Pajaro, on which were  grazing numbers of horses and cattle.  The house was of adobe, with  a long range of adobe-huts occupied by the semi-civilized Indians,  who at that time did all the labor of a ranch, the herding and  marking of cattle, breaking of horses, and cultivating the little  patches of wheat and vegetables which constituted all the farming  of that day.  Every thing about the house looked deserted, and,  seeing a small Indian boy leaning up against a post, I approached  him and asked him in Spanish, \"Where is the master?\"  \"Gone to the  Presidio\" (Monterey).  \"Is anybody in the house?\"  \"No.\"   \"Is it  locked up?\"  \"Yes.\"   \"Is no one about who can get in?\"  \"No.\"  \"Have you any meat?\"  \"No.\"   \"Any flour or grain?\"  \"No.\"   \"Any  chickens?\"  \"No.\"   \"Any eggs?\"  \"No.\"   \"What do you live on?\"  \"Nada\" (nothing).  The utter indifference of this boy, and the  tone of his answer \"Nada,\" attracted the attention of Colonel  Mason, who had been listening to our conversation, and who  knew enough of Spanish to catch the meaning, and he exclaimed  with some feeling, \"So we get nada for our breakfast.\"  I felt  mortified, for I had held out the prospect of a splendid  breakfast of meat and tortillas with rice, chickens, eggs, etc., at  the ranch of my friend Josh Antonio, as a justification for  taking the Governor, a man of sixty years of age, more than  twenty miles at a full canter for his breakfast.  But there was  no help for it, and we accordingly went a short distance to a  pond, where we unpacked our mules and made a slim breakfast; on  some scraps of hard bread and a bone of pork that remained in our  alforjas.  This was no uncommon thing in those days, when many  a ranchero with his eleven leagues of land, his hundreds of  horses and thousands of cattle, would receive us with all the  grandiloquence of a Spanish lord, and confess that he had nothing  in his house to eat except the carcass of a beef hung up, from  which the stranger might cut and cook, without money or price, what  he needed.  That night we slept on Salinas Plain, and the next  morning reached Monterey.  All the missions and houses at that  period were alive with fleas, which the natives looked on as  pleasant titillators, but they so tortured me that I always gave  them a wide berth, and slept on a saddle-blanket, with the saddle  for a pillow and the serape, or blanket, for a cover.  We never  feared rain except in winter.  As the spring and summer of 1848  advanced, the reports came faster and faster from the gold-mines at  Sutter's saw-mill.  Stories reached us of fabulous discoveries, and  spread throughout the land.  Everybody was talking of \"Gold!  gold!\" until it assumed the character of a fever.  Some of our  soldiers began to desert; citizens were fitting out trains of  wagons and packmules to go to the mines.  We heard of men earning  fifty, five hundred, and thousands of dollars per day, and for a  time it seemed as though somebody would reach solid gold.  Some of  this gold began to come to Yerba Buena in trade, and to disturb the  value of merchandise, particularly of mules, horses, tin pans, and  articles used in mining: I of course could not escape the  infection, and at last convinced Colonel Mason that it was our duty  to go up and see with our own eyes, that we might report the truth  to our Government.  As yet we had no regular mail to any part of  the United States, but mails had "]]]
