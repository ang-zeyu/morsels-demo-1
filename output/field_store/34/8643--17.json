The bottom of the port is formed, as I before said, by an immense glacier,  from which, during the night, large masses broke off and fell into the sea  with a loud crash,[52] thus explaining the nocturnal noises we had often  heard at Port Famine, and which at the time were thought to arise from the  eruption of volcanoes. Such were also, probably, the sounds heard by the  Spanish officers during their exploration of the Straits, whilst in the  port of Santa Monica, where they had taken refuge from a violent gale of  wind.[53]    {58}    The harbour was full of fragments of ice, the succeeding morning, drifting  into the Sound, where the sea-water, being at a higher temperature than the  air, rapidly melted them.    Since our departure from Port Waterfall, the weather had been mild, clear,  and settled; but as it wanted only three days of the change of the moon, at  which period, as well as at the full, it always blew a gale, I wished to  reach a place of security in the Gabriel Channel or Magdalen Sound.    Near the islands of Ainsworth Harbour, three canoes passed us, steering  across the Sound, each with a seal-skin fixed up in the bow for a sail; and  we recognised in them the party left at Port Cooke, among whom was the  Indian who had been detected in stealing a tin pot. They did not come  along-side; but as we went by, pointed to the north, apparently urging us  to go in that direction.    We had noticed several wigwams at Parry and Ainsworth Harbours, which shows  that they are much frequented by Indians, perhaps on their way to the open  low country east of Mount Hope, where numerous herds of guanacoes may be  found.    Porpoises and seal were not scarce in this inlet, and in the entrance there  were many whales. The presence of seal and whales made me think it probable  there was a channel; but I believe every person with me was satisfied of  its being a sound, terminating under Mount Hope. Since my later experience  of the deceptive character of some passages in Tierra del Fuego (the  Barbara Channel, for example), I have felt less certain that there may not  be a communication with the low land, behind Mount Hope, round its northern  base. The improbability was, however, so great,--from the bottom of the  sound {59} being shoal,--from the very slight tide-stream,--and from the  information of the Natives; who evidently intended to tell us we could not  get out to sea,--that we did not consider it worth while to make another  examination.    I have before observed that the strata of the slate rocks, in the Strait,  dip to the S.E.; and I found that they dip similarly all the way to the  bottom of this inlet, which I named Admiralty Sound.    The north side, like that of the Gabriel Channel, is steep, without  indentations, excepting where there is a break in the hills; but on the  south shore there are many coves, and bights, the cause of which is shown  in the accompanying imaginary section of the Gabriel Channel. The same  cause operates on the outline of the north shore of the reach of Cape  Froward, westward as far as Cape Holland, where the rock assumes a still  more primitive form. Its general character, however, is micaceous slate,  with broad veins of quartz; the latter being particularly conspicuous at  Port Gallant.    The following slight sketch, intended to represent an imaginary section of  such an opening as the Gabriel Channel, may also serve to give a general  idea of many Fuegian anchorages;--of deep water passages existing between  the almost innumerable islands of Tierra del Fuego;--and of the effects of  those sudden, and violent gusts of wind,--so frequent and  dangerous,--commonly called hurricane-squalls,[54] or williwaws.    {60}    [Illustration]    The rock, of course, decomposes equally on both sides; but on that exposed  to the south wind, it breaks off in flakes parallel to the direction of the  strata, and therefore does not make the course of the beach more irregular;  while on the other side it moulders away transversely to the direction of  the dip, leaving holes, in which water lodges, and hastens decomposition by  entering deeply into the interstices. Water, air, and frost decompose the  rock, and form a soil, which, if not too much exposed to the wind, is soon  occupied by vegetation.    The rugged faces of the cliffs, on the southern shore, caused by the rock  decomposing across the grain, collect sand and mud; and hence it happens  that anchorages are frequently found on one side, whilst, on the other, the  anchor will not hold, from the steepness of the ground; there being nothing  upon the smooth declivity to retain mud and sand before it gets to the  bottom; which, in most cases known to me, lies far beyond the reach of the  anchor.    After a tedious and difficult passage through the Gabriel Channel, we  anchored in a snug harbour within the entrance of Magdalen Channel, on the  west side, under a peaked hill called by Sarmiento 'El Vernal,'--in our  plan, the 'Sugar-loaf.' The entrance is about a quarter of a mile wide; but  after a few hundred yards the harbour opens, extending in for nearly a  mile. It is of easy depth; seven fathoms in the entrance, and four, five,  and six fathoms within; so that it is {61} very convenient for a small  vessel: to us, indeed, it was a most welcome discovery. The land rises,  around this cove, to the height of two or three thousand feet. It is  covered with Beech, and Winter's-bark, and near the water is adorned with  large groves of Fuchsia, Berberis, and the common shrubs of Port Famine,  growing so thickly as to form an almost impenetrable jungle; but,  notwithstanding the picturesque character of its scenery, the towering  height of the hills, which exclude the sun's rays for the whole day, during  the greater portion of the year, renders it a gloomy and melancholy  spot.[55]    We found a family of Fuegians in the inner harbour. Three canoes were  hauled up on the beach, but their owners were not at first visible. At  last, after our repeatedly calling out 'Ho-say, ho-say,' they appeared,  and, rather reluctantly, invited us, by signs, to land. There seemed to be  fourteen or fifteen people, and seven or eight dogs. Mr. Wickham and Mr.  Tarn went on shore to these natives, who exhibited some timidity, until a  hideous old woman began to chatter, and soon made them understand that the  young men (L[=a]-[=a]-pas) were absent on a hunting excursion, but were  every moment expected to return. There were only three men with the women  and children. To inspire them with confidence in our good intentions, Mr.  Wickham gave each man a red cap, and some other trifles. One of them  complained of being sick, but I rather imagine his illness was feigned, and  the others did not at all seem to like our visit. By degrees their fears  subsided, and, restraint being laid aside, an active trade began; in which  several otter skins, shell-necklaces, spears, and other trifles, were  obtained from them in exchange for beads, buttons, medals, &c. The otters  are caught by the help of dogs, on which account, principally, the latter  are so valuable.    These people were slightly clothed with skins of the seal and otter, but  some had pieces of guanaco mantles over their shoulders, whence we supposed  that they were either of the same tribe, or at peace, with the Indians of  Admiralty Sound: {62} unless, indeed, they trade with the Patagonian  Indians; but such is the poverty of the Fuegians, they can scarcely possess  any thing of value sufficient to exchange with the goods of their northern  neighbours, unless it be iron pyrites, which I think is not found in the  open country inhabited by the Patagonian Indians, and, from the facility  with which it yields sparks of fire, must be an object of importance.    We were not a little amused by the surprise which these natives showed at  the things in our possession, and by the effect produced in their  countenances when they saw any thing extraordinary: the expression was not  that of joy or surprise, but a sort of vacant, stupified, stare at each  other. They must have been very suspicious of our intentions, or very much  excited by what they had seen during the day, as throughout the night an  incessant chattering of voices was heard on shore, interrupted only by the  barking of their dogs.    Looking down the Magdalen Inlet, we saw two openings, which, while the  hills were enveloped in mist, had the appearance of being channels. We  proceeded for some distance into the more westerly of the two, but found  that it was merely a sound, terminated by high land. The boat was then  steered under a steep mass of black mountainous land,[56] the summit of  which is divided into three peaks, which Sarmiento called 'El Pan de Azucar  de los Boquerones' (the Sugar-loaf of the Openings). We ran southward,  fifteen miles down this sound, and reached the Labyrinth Islands; but  finding there no suitable anchorage, resumed our course towards the bottom  of what we thought another sound, terminated by mountains. At noon, the  furthest point, on the west shore, which we called Cape Turn, was within  three miles of us, and we should soon have discovered the continuation of  the channel (as it has since been proved); but a breeze set in from the  S.W., and in a short time it blew so strong as to oblige us to turn back.  'Williwaws' and baffling eddy winds kept us seven hours under Mount  Boqueron. These squalls were at first alarming, but by taking in all sail,  before they passed, we sustained no injury. At {63} sunset we were abreast  of Hope Harbour, in which we purposed taking shelter from the gale.

Footnote 19: These two saints had already been withdrawn from       the altar, (Tiraboschi, p. 253,) nor does a copy of them       remain at San Francesco. That made by Boulanger is in the       convent, and was evidently produced in haste, and upon a bad       ground; hence it is neither very exact, nor in good       preservation. It is, nevertheless, valuable as throwing       light upon Coreggio's history, and his different styles;       while it also tends to prove, that if the ancona was made of       wood, the picture was made portable, and painted on       canvass.    There are two other pictures of his, mentioned by the Cavalier Mengs, which  may be referred to the same class. One of them is the \"_Noli me tangere_,\"  in the Casa Ercolani, but which subsequently passed into the Escurial; the  other a picture of the Virgin in the act of adoring the Divine Infant,  which adorns the royal gallery in Florence; both of which he declares are  in a taste which he failed to discover in the most sublime and celebrated  pictures of Coreggio. To these we may add the Marsyas of the Marchesi  Litta, at Milan, with a few other works of Coreggio's, inserted in the  catalogue of Tiraboschi, which is the most copious extant. From such  evidence it must, in short, be admitted, that this artist was possessed of  a sort of middle style, between that which he formed as a scholar and that  which he completed as a master. And we have equal reason for believing what  has been stated respecting Coreggio's having attempted a variety of styles,  before he made choice of the one by which he so greatly distinguished  himself, and thus laid the foundation for his pieces being attributed, as  they have been, to different masters. In fact, his conceptions of the  beautiful and the perfect were deduced in part from other artists, and in  part created by himself; conceptions that could not be matured without much  time and labour; on which account he was compelled, as it were, to imitate  those natural philosophers who try an infinite number of different  experiments to discover some single truth which they have in view.    During a progress thus gradually pursued, and by an artist who in every new  production succeeded in surpassing himself, it is difficult to fix the  precise epoch of his new style. I once saw in Rome a very beautiful little  picture, representing, in the background, the taking of Christ in the  garden; and in the fore part, the youth Joseph, who, in the act of flying,  leaves his mantle behind him; the original of which is in England, and a  duplicate at Milan, in possession of Count de Keweniller; the picture at  Rome bore in ancient character the date of 1505, indisputably false. A more  correct one, however, is to be found upon that of the Marriage of St.  Catherine, in possession of Count Brull, late prime minister to the king of  Poland, which is every way corresponding to the other, remaining at Capo di  Monte; it bears the date of 1517. It is probable, that in this year, when  the artist was just twenty-three, he had already sufficiently mastered his  new style, from the fact of his having about 1518, or 19, produced in Parma  the picture which is still in existence at the monastery of St. Paul. This,  after various disputes, has recently been acknowledged to be \"one of the  most grand, spirited, and laboured productions that ever proceeded from  that divine hand;\" and it has been illustrated with its real epoch, from an  excellent little work of the celebrated Padre Affo. Such a work, indeed,  confers a benefit upon history. He there explains the manner in which  Coreggio might have imitated the ancients with such advantages only as he  found in Parma; and endeavours to account for the difficulty presented to  us in the silence of Mengs, who, having beheld this very picture, omitted  to mention it among Antonio's other works. We are relieved, also, from  another difficulty in respect to the manner in which a piece representing  the Chase of Diana, abounding with such a variety of loves and cupids,  could have been painted for a holy monastery, accompanied by those profane  representations distributed throughout the same chamber, in various  circular pieces, such as the Graces, the Fates, the Vestals; a naked Juno,  suspended from the heavens, in the method described by Homer, in his  fifteenth book of the Iliad; with other similar objects, still less  becoming the sphere of a cloister. But our wonder will cease when we  reflect, that the same place was once the residence of a lady abbess, at a  time in which the nuns of S. Paolo lived unguarded by grates; in which  every abbess sought to enjoy herself; held jurisdiction over lands and  castles, and, independent of the bishop, lived altogether as a secular  personage, a license in those days extremely general, as is justly observed  by Muratori, in his \"Italian Antiquities,\" tom. iii. p. 332. The above work  was a commission given by a Donna Giovanna di Piacenza, who was then the  superior of the monastery; and whatever degree of learning we meet with in  the painting, and in the devices or conceits, was, most probably,  communicated to the artist by Giorgio Anselmi, a celebrated scholar, whose  own daughter belonged to the same establishment. But we must not allow  ourselves to proceed further in our notice of a dissertation, assuredly one  of the most profound and ingenious that we ever recollect to have read. The  pictures are about to be engraved by the hand of Signor Rosaspina, after  those of S. Giovanni, in which the learned Abate Mazza is at present so  laudably engaged, no less to the advantage of the arts than of his own  reputation.    The vast undertaking, so finely executed by Coreggio, at S. Paolo, obtained  for him so high a name, that the Padri Cassinensi invited him to engage in  the equally extensive one of San Giovanni, entered upon in 1520,[20] and  completed in 1524, as we find mentioned in the books. There, also, in  addition to several minor works, he decorated the tribune, which being  afterwards removed, in order to extend the choir, and rebuilt, was  repainted, as we shall notice elsewhere, by Aretusi. On the demolition of  the tribune, the picture of the Incoronation of the Virgin, the leading  subject in the fresco, was saved, and is now exhibited in the royal  library; and various heads of angels, which in like manner escaped the same  destruction, are preserved in the Palazzo Rondanini at Rome. There are,  now, in the church of San Giovanni, two pictures in oil, placed opposite to  one another, in one of the chapels; one, a Christ taken from the Cross; the  other, the Martyrdom of St. Placidus, both painted on canvass made for the  purpose, like some of the pictures of Mantegna. On the exterior of one of  the other chapels is a figure of St. John the Evangelist, executed in the  noblest manner. And, finally, there is the grand cupola, where the artist  represented the Ascension of Jesus to his Father; the apostles looking on  in mingled veneration and surprise; a production in which, whether we  regard the proportion, and the shortening of the figures, the naked parts,  or the draperies, or gaze upon it as a whole, we must alike confess that it  was an unexampled specimen of the art, in its kind; the terrific Judgment  of Michelangiolo,[21] not having then assumed its place in the Vatican.      Footnote 20: Tiraboschi was unable to discover any certain       work from the hand of Antonio, between the years 17 and 20,       of the same age. This gave rise to the assertion of Vasari's       annotator, that he remained in Rome in quality of       Raffaello's pupil during this interval, and on his master's       death, in 1520, returned to Lombardy. Such a supposition       becomes utterly void, after the above epochs adduced by us.      Footnote 21: It is worth notice, that Ratti, persuaded of       Coreggio's residence at Rome, has availed himself of the       argument of certain figures being borrowed by him from the       Judgment, _before Michel Angiolo had painted it_. Equally       valid is his conjecture, founded upon several figures of       Raffaello's, which he detected in Coreggio, as if these two       artists had never studied from the same book of nature. Such       an opinion is asserted also by Padre della Valle, cited in       our second volume, p. 121. But writers will always be liable       to these mistakes, as long as they pretend to make       discoveries and throw light upon ancient facts, without       adhering to historical dates, and in their conjectures       rather consult novelty and their own vanity than truth. But       this fault, brought into vogue about the middle of the       eighteenth century, has produced no little evil, both in       letters and religion, and surely cannot continue to receive       encouragement at this enlightened period. Let us rather       trust, that the love of truth, never altogether       extinguished, will resume its former influence in the       investigation of historical points, and that one of its       leading objects will be to free both sacred and profane       history from those foolish sophisms that so much obscure       it.    Astonishing, however, as such a production must be allowed to be, it will  still be found to yield the palm to another, which the hand of Coreggio  alone could have rendered superior. This is the celebrated Assumption of  the Virgin, in the cathedral of Parma, completed in the year 1530. It is  indisputably more ample; and in the background the figures of the same  apostles are reproduced, as was customary, expressing feelings of surprise  and piety, though in a manner altogether different from the former. In the  upper part is represented an immense crowd of happy spirits, yet"]]]
