Whenever it is determined in anywise from within, it  regards things clearly and distinctly, as I will show below.    PROP. XXX.  We can only have a very inadequate knowledge of the  duration of our body.    Proof.--The duration of our body does not depend on its  essence (II. Ax. i.), nor on the absolute nature of God (I.  xxi.).  But (I. xxviii.) it is conditioned to exist and operate  by causes, which in their turn are conditioned to exist and  operate in a fixed and definite relation by other causes, these  last again being conditioned by others, and so on to infinity.  The duration of our body therefore depends on the common order of  nature, or the constitution of things.  Now, however a thing may  be constituted, the adequate knowledge of that thing is in God,  in so far as he has the ideas of all things, and not in so far as  he has the idea of the human body only.  (II. ix. Coroll.)  Wherefore the knowledge of the duration of our body is in God  very inadequate, in so far as he is only regarded as constituting  the nature of the human mind; that is (II. xi. Coroll.), this  knowledge is very inadequate to our mind.  Q.E.D.    PROP. XXXI.  We can only have a very inadequate knowledge of the  duration of particular things external to ourselves.    Proof.--Every particular thing, like the human body, must be  conditioned by another particular thing to exist and operate in a  fixed and definite relation; this other particular thing must  likewise be conditioned by a third, and so on to infinity.  (I.  xxviii.)  As we have shown in the foregoing proposition, from  this common property of particular things, we have only a very  inadequate knowledge of the duration of our body; we must draw a  similar conclusion with regard to the duration of particular  things, namely, that we can only have a very inadequate knowledge  of the duration thereof.  Q.E.D.    Corollary.--Hence it follows that all particular things are  contingent and perishable.  For we can have no adequate idea of  their duration (by the last Prop.), and this is what we must  understand by the contingency and perishableness of things.  (I.  xxxiii., Note i.)  For (I. xxix.), except in this sense, nothing  is contingent.    PROP. XXXII.  All ideas, in so far as they are referred to God,  are true.    Proof.--All ideas which are in God agree in every respect with  their objects (II. vii. Coroll.), therefore (I. Ax. vi.) they are  all true.  Q.E.D.    PROP. XXXIII.  There is nothing positive in ideas, which causes  them to be called false.    Proof.--If this be denied, conceive, if possible, a positive  mode of thinking, which should constitute the distinctive quality  of falsehood.  Such a mode of thinking cannot be in God (II.  xxxii.); external to God it cannot be or be conceived (I. xv.).  Therefore there is nothing positive in ideas which causes them to  be called false.  Q.E.D.    PROP. XXXIV.  Every idea, which in us is absolute or adequate and  perfect, is true.    Proof.--When we say that an idea in us is adequate and  perfect, we say, in other words (II. xi. Coroll.), that the idea  is adequate and perfect in God, in so far as he constitutes the  essence of our mind; consequently (II. xxxii.), we say that such  an idea is true.  Q.E.D.    PROP. XXXV.  Falsity consists in the privation of knowledge,  which inadequate, fragmentary, or confused ideas involve.    Proof.--There is nothing positive in ideas, which causes them  to be called false (II. xxxiii.); but falsity cannot consist in  simple privation (for minds, not bodies, are said to err and to  be mistaken), neither can it consist in absolute ignorance, for  ignorance and error are not identical; wherefore it consists in  the privation of knowledge, which inadequate, fragmentary, or  confused ideas involve.  Q.E.D.    Note.--In the note to II. xvii. I explained how error consists  in the privation of knowledge, but in order to throw more light  on the subject I will give an example.  For instance, men are  mistaken in thinking themselves free; their opinion is made up  of consciousness of their own actions, and ignorance of the  causes by which they are conditioned.  Their idea of freedom,  therefore, is simply their ignorance of any cause for their  actions.  As for their saying that human actions depend on the  will, this is a mere phrase without any idea to correspond  thereto.  What the will is, and how it moves the body, they none  of them know; those who boast of such knowledge, and feign  dwellings and habitations for the soul, are wont to provoke  either laughter or disgust.  So, again, when we look at the sun,  we imagine that it is distant from us about two hundred feet;  this error does not lie solely in this fancy, but in the fact  that, while we thus imagine, we do not know the sun's true  distance or the cause of the fancy.  For although we afterwards  learn, that the sun is distant from us more than six hundred of  the earth's diameters, we none the less shall fancy it to be near;  for we do not imagine the sun as near us, because we are  ignorant of its true distance, but because the modification of  our body involves the essence of the sun, in so far as our said  body is affected thereby.    PROP. XXXVI.  Inadequate and confused ideas follow by the same  necessity, as adequate or clear and distinct ideas.    Proof.--All ideas are in God (I. xv.), and in so far as they  are referred to God are true (II. xxxii.) and (II. vii. Coroll.)  adequate; therefore there are no ideas confused or inadequate,  except in respect to a particular mind (cf. II. xxiv. and  xxviii.); therefore all ideas, whether adequate or inadequate,  follow by the same necessity (II. vi.).  Q.E.D.    PROP. XXXVII.  That which is common to all (cf. Lemma II.,  above), and which is equally in a part and in the whole, does not  constitute the essence of any particular thing.    Proof.--If this be denied, conceive, if possible, that it  constitutes the essence of some particular thing; for instance,  the essence of B.  Then (II. Def. ii.) it cannot without B either  exist or be conceived; but this is against our hypothesis.  Therefore it does not appertain to B's essence, nor does it  constitute the essence of any particular thing.  Q.E.D.    PROP. XXXVIII.  Those things, which are common to all, and which  are equally in a part and in the whole, cannot be conceived  except adequately.    Proof.--Let A be something, which is common to all bodies, and  which is equally present in the part of any given body and in the  whole.  I say A cannot be conceived except adequately.  For the  idea thereof in God will necessarily be adequate (II. vii.  Coroll.), both in so far as God has the idea of the human body,  and also in so far as he has the idea of the modifications of the  human body, which (II. xvi., xxv., xxvii.) involve in part the  nature of the human body and the nature of external bodies; that  is (II. xii., xiii.), the idea in God will necessarily be  adequate, both in so far as he constitutes the human mind, and in  so far as he has the ideas, which are in the human mind.  Therefore the mind (II. xi. Coroll.) necessarily perceives A  adequately, and has this adequate perception, both in so far as  it perceives itself, and in so far as it perceives its own or any  external body, nor can A be conceived in any other manner.  Q.E.D.    Corollary--Hence it follows that there are certain ideas or  notions common to all men; for (by Lemma ii.) all bodies agree  in certain respects, which (by the foregoing Prop.) must be  adequately or clearly and distinctly perceived by all.    PROP. XXXIX.  That, which is common to and a property of the  human body and such other bodies as are wont to affect the human  body, and which is present equally in each part of either, or in  the whole, will be represented by an adequate idea in the mind.    Proof.--If A be that, which is common to and a property of the  human body and external bodies, and equally present in the human  body and in the said external bodies, in each part of each  external body and in the whole, there will be an adequate idea of  A in God (II. vii. Coroll.), both in so far as he has the idea of  the human body, and in so far as he has the ideas of the given  external bodies.  Let it now be granted, that the human body is  affected by an external body through that, which it has in common  therewith, namely, A; the idea of this modification will involve  the property A (II. xvi.), and therefore (II. vii. Coroll.) the  idea of this modification, in so far as it involves the property  A, will be adequate in God, in so far as God is affected by the  idea of the human body; that is (II. xiii.), in so far as he  constitutes the nature of the human mind; therefore (II. xi.  Coroll.) this idea is also adequate in the human mind.  Q.E.D.    Corollary.--Hence it follows that the mind is fitted to  perceive adequately more things, in proportion as its body has  more in common with other bodies.    PROP. XL.  Whatsoever ideas in the mind follow from ideas which  are therein adequate, are also themselves adequate.    Proof.--This proposition is self--evident.  For when we say  that an idea in the human mind follows from ideas which are  therein adequate, we say, in other words (II. xi. Coroll.), that  an idea is in the divine intellect, whereof God is the cause, not  in so far as he is infinite, nor in so far as he is affected by  the ideas of very many particular things, but only in so far as  he constitutes the essence of the human mind.
