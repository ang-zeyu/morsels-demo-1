He tells the most laughable stories of his London  life, and his musical difficulties and experiences there. In Paris he  is only librarian of the \"Conservatoire,\" and director of great  concerts.    Jules Janin, the sparkling \"J. J.\" of the _Journal des Debats_, and  the grand seigneur of the Parisian _feuilletonistes_, leads the most  loitering, pleasant life, and grows merry and fat thereby. He sits  upon a luxurious ottoman, wrapped in a gorgeous _robe de chambre_, by  the fire-place of his beautifully adorned study, and there among his  books and bijoux of taste and art, gives audience to all the world. He  has visits without end. He gives instruction and advice, hears all  that every body has to say, applauds extravagantly, as he writes, all  things in this world and some more, until it is time to go to dinner,  or to see a new vaudeville. He has beside a beautiful wife, and  suffers with the gout. Could his cup be fuller?    The poet Beranger, too, who seems to Hiller the songfullest of  song-writers, charmed him by the gravity, and sweetness, and nobility  of his character. Beranger received him quietly at Passy, near Paris,  where he resides, a hale old man of more than seventy years. His hair  is white, but his face has the freshness of blooming health. In his  features there is a remarkable blending of geniality and intelligent  sharpness. They are largely moulded, and their general expression is  as generous, fine, and graceful as his verses. The perfect simplicity  of his household is very striking. The only hints of any luxury are  some medallion portraits, among which Hiller observed Napoleon and  Lamartine. Yet this severity is so evidently the result of taste and  not of poverty, that it has no unpleasant effect. The beauty and  richness of his conversation filled his visitor with the greatest  regret that he could not record it all. His first great remembrance is  the destruction of the Bastille. His essay in literature was by the  songs which circulated universally in manuscript before they were  printed. But his literary ambition was toward works of great scope and  extent, and it was not until after thirty years of age that he felt  distinctly what he could do best. Of his songs he said, \"I present to  myself a song, as a great composition--I sketch a complete plan,  beginning, middle, and end, and make the refrain the quintessence of  the whole.\"    While Beranger was finding a letter, he opened a drawer, in which  Hiller saw scraps of song and sketches of poems, which he longed to  seize, as a wistful boy would grab at the money piles in a banker's  window. The following is the letter in which Beranger speaks of the  Marseillaise:         \"I thank you, Madame, for the pleasant letter which you       addressed to me. It has revealed to me a noble heart, and       although I do not believe such hearts as rare as many say,       it is always a fair fortune to meet them.         \"What you say of the Marseillaise is entirely just. But       remember, Madame, that it is the people itself, which always       selects its songs, words, and melodies, uninfluenced by any       one in the world. Once made, this choice endures, with       authority even among the later generations, whose experience       would not have made it.         \"I have often enough thought about a new song of the kind,       but I am too old now, and the circumstances of the time have       robbed my voice of power. You, Madame, saw the true thought       of the song which should be now sung, and I lament that you       find the poetical harness not flexible enough for it.         \"As to your remarks upon my new songs, I must say that I       trouble myself as little about the destiny of my younger       daughters as about that of their elder sisters. And I am       surprised that you speak to me of a Lierman, who should have       known me. Excuse, Madame, my delay in acknowledging and       thanking you for your letter, and believe me your devoted,                                            BERANGER.\"               *       *       *       *       *    A recent Italian translation of the _Diplomats and Diplomacy of  Italy_, which first appeared in Professor Von Raumer's _Pocket Book_  for 1841, contains three hitherto unprinted MSS. from the Venetian  archives. They are curious and interesting, as indicating the strict  surveillance which the republic maintained, by means of its  ambassadors, over the whole world of the period.           *       *       *       *       *    MR. WILLIS'S _Hurry-Graphs_ have a French rival in the _Pensees d'un  Emballeur_, by M. Commerson, chief editor of the _Tintamarre_ (Paris  journal.) They are called fantastic, original and forcible.           *       *       *       *       *    A work to create some surprise, coming from Spain, is the _Persecution  of the Spanish Protestants by Philip the Second_, by Don ADOLPHO DE  CASTRO. The name of Castro is honorably distinguished in Spanish  literature. The present author is a grandson, we believe, of Rodriguez  de Castro, who wrote the BIBLIOTECA ESPANOLA. He displays abilities  and a temper suitable for the task he attempted; he has joined to  careful and intelligent research a bravery of characterization which  quite relieves his work from the censures which belong to most Spanish  compositions of its class. That he could print in Madrid a work in  which statecraft and ecclesiastical persecutions are so frankly dealt  with, is a fact of more significance than a dozen such revolutions as  have vexed the slumbers of other states. In Spain, above all  countries, the spread of a taste for historical studies must be  regarded as pregnant with important consequences. It shows that the  barriers of ignorance and self-conceit, which have so long isolated  that country from the rest of Europe, are beginning to be effectually  broken down. To the common Protestant reader, indeed, De Castro's work  will appear studiously moderate, or perhaps timid. But it should be  remembered that it was written for a public which is four or five  centuries behind our own, in all that constitutes true liberty and  enlightenment; and what would appear most gratuitous cowardice here  may easily enough be remarkable courage in Spain. To speak in favor of  Protestantism at all, still more to become the biographer of the  Protestant martyrs, is an undertaking which demands from a Spaniard,  even of the present day, no ordinary amount of resolution. And we  should be by no means surprised to hear that De Castro has been, in  one way or another, made to pay some penalty of his rash enterprise.  That it is both a dangerous and an unpopular one is manifest from the  caution with which historical as well as religious topics are treated.  Compiling what we cannot better characterize than as a Spanish  supplement to Fox's \"Book of Martyrs,\" the author nowhere professes  himself a Protestant. And the slow and gradual way in which he unmasks  the character of Philip II., shows how haughty and sensitive are the  public whom he has undertaken to disabuse of a portion of the  inveterate pride and prejudice which they nourish on all subjects  affecting their church or their country. On the whole, however, though  the Protestant reader will occasionally desiderate a little more  warmth and indignation when chronicling such atrocities, we should say  that the book rather gains than loses by this studied moderation both  in tone and opinions. It certainly gains in dignity and  impressiveness; and it is vastly better adapted to make its way with  the author's countrymen, than if he had betrayed at the outset a  sectarian bias, which would have revolted them, before they had time  to make acquaintance with the sad and sanguinary events of which he is  the historian. The ground gone over is necessarily much the same as in  M'Crie's _History of the Reformation in Spain_, a work which possibly  suggested the undertaking, and to which De Castro gives due credit for  learning and ability. His advantage over the Scottish historian  consists in his command of a variety of documents in print and in  manuscript, to which access could be had only in Spain, especially the  publications of the Spanish reformers themselves, which are  exceedingly rare in consequence of the pains taken to destroy them by  the Inquisition. The most remarkable result obtained by De Castro's  researches, and the feature in his work for which he claims the  greatest credit is the new light he has thrown on the history of Don  Carlos. But unfortunately the question as to the Protestantism of that  prince remains in much the same obscurity as before. His having been  tainted by heretical opinions would aid certainly in accounting for  his father's malignity towards him; but otherwise there seems to be no  proof of the fact; and our own opinion is, that his tolerant views as  to the treatment of the Flemish provinces were misconstrued into bias  towards Protestant doctrines. The inference relied on by De Castro and  others, that if he had remained Catholic he must have shared his  father's extravagant bigotry, is lame. Don Carlos did no more than  follow the usual course of heirs apparent when he disapproved of his  father's tyranny; and his sympathies with Aragon are not less marked  than those with Flanders.           *       *       *       *       *    LONGWORTH, who distinguished himself in the Hungarian troubles, is  writing a history of them. There is promise of so many books upon the  subject that we shall be able to find out nothing about it. By the  way, we wonder that no one has yet chosen for a motto to place upon  his title-page, this sentence, which Lord Bolingbroke wrote more than  a hundred years ago:         \"_I mean to speak of the troubles in Hungary. Whatever they       become in their progress,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3623"],[0,"The Golden Bough: A Study of Magic and Religion (#15)"],[1," a new one.\"      Then the tooth was thrown on the thatch of the house, because rats  make their nests in the decayed thatch. The reason assigned for  invoking the rats on these occasions was that rats' teeth were the  strongest known to the natives.    Other parts which are commonly believed to remain in a sympathetic  union with the body, after the physical connexion has been severed,  are the navel-string and the afterbirth, including the placenta. So  intimate, indeed, is the union conceived to be, that the fortunes of  the individual for good or evil throughout life are often supposed  to be bound up with one or other of these portions of his person, so  that if his navel-string or afterbirth is preserved and properly  treated, he will be prosperous; whereas if it be injured or lost, he  will suffer accordingly. Thus certain tribes of Western Australia  believe that a man swims well or ill, according as his mother at his  birth threw the navel-string into water or not. Among the natives on  the Pennefather River in Queensland it is believed that a part of  the child's spirit (_cho-i_) stays in the afterbirth. Hence the  grandmother takes the afterbirth away and buries it in the sand. She  marks the spot by a number of twigs which she sticks in the ground  in a circle, tying their tops together so that the structure  resembles a cone. When Anjea, the being who causes conception in  women by putting mud babies into their wombs, comes along and sees  the place, he takes out the spirit and carries it away to one of his  haunts, such as a tree, a hole in a rock, or a lagoon where it may  remain for years. But sometime or other he will put the spirit again  into a baby, and it will be born once more into the world. In  Ponape, one of the Caroline Islands, the navel-string is placed in a  shell and then disposed of in such a way as shall best adapt the  child for the career which the parents have chosen for him; for  example, if they wish to make him a good climber, they will hang the  navel-string on a tree. The Kei islanders regard the navel-string as  the brother or sister of the child, according to the sex of the  infant. They put it in a pot with ashes, and set it in the branches  of a tree, that it may keep a watchful eye on the fortunes of its  comrade. Among the Bataks of Sumatra, as among many other peoples of  the Indian Archipelago, the placenta passes for the child's younger  brother or sister, the sex being determined by the sex of the child,  and it is buried under the house. According to the Bataks it is  bound up with the child's welfare, and seems, in fact, to be the  seat of the transferable soul, of which we shall hear something  later on. The Karo Bataks even affirm that of a man's two souls it  is the true soul that lives with the placenta under the house; that  is the soul, they say, which begets children.    The Baganda believe that every person is born with a double, and  this double they identify with the afterbirth, which they regard as  a second child. The mother buries the afterbirth at the root of a  plantain tree, which then becomes sacred until the fruit has  ripened, when it is plucked to furnish a sacred feast for the  family. Among the Cherokees the navel-string of a girl is buried  under a corn-mortar, in order that the girl may grow up to be a good  baker; but the navel-string of a boy is hung up on a tree in the  woods, in order that he may be a hunter. The Incas of Peru preserved  the navel-string with the greatest care, and gave it to the child to  suck whenever it fell ill. In ancient Mexico they used to give a  boy's navel-string to soldiers, to be buried by them on a field of  battle, in order that the boy might thus acquire a passion for war.  But the navel-string of a girl was buried beside the domestic  hearth, because this was believed to inspire her with a love of home  and taste for cooking and baking.    Even in Europe many people still believe that a person's destiny is  more or less bound up with that of his navel-string or afterbirth.  Thus in Rhenish Bavaria the navel-string is kept for a while wrapt  up in a piece of old linen, and then cut or pricked to pieces  according as the child is a boy or a girl, in order that he or she  may grow up to be a skilful workman or a good sempstress. In Berlin  the midwife commonly delivers the dried navel-string to the father  with a strict injunction to preserve it carefully, for so long as it  is kept the child will live and thrive and be free from sickness. In  Beauce and Perche the people are careful to throw the navel-string  neither into water nor into fire, believing that if that were done  the child would be drowned or burned.    Thus in many parts of the world the navel-string, or more commonly  the afterbirth, is regarded as a living being, the brother or sister  of the infant, or as the material object in which the guardian  spirit of the child or part of its soul resides. Further, the  sympathetic connexion supposed to exist between a person and his  afterbirth or navel-string comes out very clearly in the widespread  custom of treating the afterbirth or navel-string in ways which are  supposed to influence for life the character and career of the  person, making him, if it is a man, a nimble climber, a strong  swimmer, a skilful hunter, or a brave soldier, and making her, if it  is a woman, a cunning sempstress, a good baker, and so forth. Thus  the beliefs and usages concerned with the afterbirth or placenta,  and to a less extent with the navel-string, present a remarkable  parallel to the widespread doctrine of the transferable or external  soul and the customs founded on it. Hence it is hardly rash to  conjecture that the resemblance is no mere chance coincidence, but  that in the afterbirth or placenta we have a physical basis (not  necessarily the only one) for the theory and practice of the  external soul. The consideration of that subject is reserved for a  later part of this work.    A curious application of the doctrine of contagious magic is the  relation commonly believed to exist between a wounded man and the  agent of the wound, so that whatever is subsequently done by or to  the agent must correspondingly affect the patient either for good or  evil. Thus Pliny tells us that if you have wounded a man and are  sorry for it, you have only to spit on the hand that gave the wound,  and the pain of the sufferer will be instantly alleviated. In  Melanesia, if a man's friends get possession of the arrow which  wounded him, they keep it in a damp place or in cool leaves, for  then the inflammation will be trifling and will soon subside.  Meantime the enemy who shot the arrow is hard at work to aggravate  the wound by all the means in his power. For this purpose he and his  friends drink hot and burning juices and chew irritating leaves, for  this will clearly inflame and irritate the wound. Further, they keep  the bow near the fire to make the wound which it has inflicted hot;  and for the same reason they put the arrow-head, if it has been  recovered, into the fire. Moreover, they are careful to keep the  bow-string taut and to twang it occasionally, for this will cause  the wounded man to suffer from tension of the nerves and spasms of  tetanus. \"It is constantly received and avouched,\" says Bacon, \"that  the anointing of the weapon that maketh the wound will heal the  wound itself. In this experiment, upon the relation of men of credit  (though myself, as yet, am not fully inclined to believe it), you  shall note the points following: first, the ointment wherewith this  is done is made of divers ingredients, whereof the strangest and  hardest to come by are the moss upon the skull of a dead man  unburied, and the fats of a boar and a bear killed in the act of  generation.\" The precious ointment compounded out of these and other  ingredients was applied, as the philosopher explains, not to the  wound but to the weapon, and that even though the injured man was at  a great distance and knew nothing about it. The experiment, he tells  us, had been tried of wiping the ointment off the weapon without the  knowledge of the person hurt, with the result that he was presently  in a great rage of pain until the weapon was anointed again.  Moreover, \"it is affirmed that if you cannot get the weapon, yet if  you put an instrument of iron or wood resembling the weapon into the  wound, whereby it bleedeth, the anointing of that instrument will  serve and work the effect.\" Remedies of the sort which Bacon deemed  worthy of his attention are still in vogue in the eastern counties  of England. Thus in Suffolk if a man cuts himself with a bill-hook  or a scythe he always takes care to keep the weapon bright, and oils  it to prevent the wound from festering. If he runs a thorn or, as he  calls it, a bush into his hand, he oils or greases the extracted  thorn. A man came to a doctor with an inflamed hand, having run a  thorn into it while he was hedging. On being told that the hand was  festering, he remarked, \"That didn't ought to, for I greased the  bush well after I pulled it out.\" If a horse wounds its foot by  treading on a nail, a Suffolk groom will invariably preserve the  nail, clean it, and grease it every day, to prevent the foot from  festering. Similarly Cambridgeshire labourers think that if a horse  has run a nail into its foot, it is necessary to grease the nail  with lard or oil and put it away in some safe place, or the horse  will not recover. A few years ago a veterinary surgeon was sent for  to attend a horse which had ripped its side open on the hinge of a  farm gatepost. On arriving at the farm he found that nothing had  been done for the wounded horse, but that a man was busy trying to  pry the hinge out of the gatepost in order that it might be greased  and put away, which, in the opinion of the Cambridge wiseacres,  would conduce to the recovery of the animal. Similarly Essex rustics  opine that,"]]]
