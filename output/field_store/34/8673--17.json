This  is the worst crime that's been committed in this deestrict in many  years, an' I'm goin' to run the scoundrels to earth.\"    \"Don't be talkin' nonsense, Jed,\" interrupted his father. \"You won't  catch them fellers in a hundred years. They're miles an' miles away  from here by this time in their automobile. All you can do is to  notify the sheriff. I guess we'd better give this young man some  attention. Let's see, you said your name was Quick, didn't you?\"    \"No, but it's very similar,\" answered Tom with a smile. \"It's  Swift.\"    \"I knowed it was something had to do with speed,\" went on Mr.  Blackford. \"Wa'al, now, s'pose you come in the house an' have a hot  cup of tea. You look sort of draggled out.\"    Tom was glad enough to avail himself of the kind invitation, and he  was soon in the comfortable kitchen, relating his story, with more  detail, to the farmer and his family. Mrs. Blackford applied some  home-made remedies to the lump on the youth's head, and it felt much  better.    \"I'd like to take a look at my motor-cycle,\" he said, after his  second cup of tea. \"I want to see if those men damaged it any. If  they have I'm going to have trouble getting back home to tell my  father of my bad luck. Poor dad! He will be very much worried when I  tell him the model and his patent papers have been stolen.\"    \"It's too bad!\" exclaimed Mrs. Blackford. \"I wish I had hold of them  scoundrels!\" and her usually gentle face bore a severe frown. \"Of  course you can have your thing-a-ma-bob in to see if it's hurt, but  please don't start it in here. They make a terrible racket.\"    \"No, I'll look it over in the woodshed,\" promised Tom. \"If it's all  right I think I'll start back home at once.\"    \"No, you can't do that,\" declared Mr. Blackford. \"You're in no  condition to travel. You might fall off an' git hurt. It's nearly ten  o'clock now. You jest stay here all night, an' in the mornin', if you  feel all right, you can start off. I couldn't let you go to-night.\"    Indeed, Tom did not feel very much like undertaking the journey, for  the blow on his head had made him dazed, and the chloroform caused a  sick feeling. Mr. Blackford wheeled the motor-cycle into the  woodhouse, which opened from the kitchen, and there the youth went  over the machine. He was glad to find that it had sustained no  damage. In the meanwhile Jed had gone off to tell the startling news  to near-by farmers. Quite a throng, with lanterns, went up and down  the road, but all the evidence they could find were the marks of the  automobile wheels, which clues were not very satisfactory.    \"But we'll catch them in the mornin',\" declared the deputy sheriff.  \"I'll know that automobile again if I see it. It was painted red.\"    \"That's the color of a number of automobiles,\" said Tom with a  smile. \"I'm afraid you'll have trouble identifying it by that means.  I am surprised, though, that they did not carry my motor-cycle away  with them. It is a valuable machine.\"    \"They were afraid to,\" declared Jed. \"It would look queer to see a  machine like that in an auto. Of course when they were going along  country roads in the evening it didn't much matter, but when they  headed for the city, as they probably did, they knew it would  attract suspicion to 'em. I know, for I've been a deputy sheriff  'most a year.\"    \"I believe you're right,\" agreed Tom. \"They didn't dare take the  motor-cycle with them, but they hid it, hoping I would not find it.  I'd rather have the model and the papers, though, than half a dozen  motor-cycles.\"    \"Maybe the police will help you find them,\" said Mrs. Blackford.  \"Jed, you must telephone to the police the first thing in the  morning. It's a shame the way criminals are allowed to go on. If  honest people did those things, they'd be arrested in a minute, but  it seems that scoundrels can do as they please.\"    \"You wait; I'll catch 'em!\" declared Jed confidently. \"I'll organize  another posse in the mornin'.\"    \"Well, I know one thing, and that is that the place for this young  man is in bed!\" exclaimed motherly Mrs. Blackford, and she insisted  on Tom retiring. He was somewhat restless at first, and the thought  of the loss of the model and the papers preyed on his mind. Then,  utterly exhausted, he sank into a heavy slumber, and did not awaken  until the sun was shining in his window the next morning. A good  breakfast made him feel somewhat better, and he was more like the  resourceful Tom Swift of old when he went to get his motor-cycle in  shape for the ride back to Shopton.    \"Well, I hope you find those criminals,\" said Mr. Blackford, as he  watched Tom oiling the machine. \"If you're ever out this way again,  stop off and see us.\"    \"Yes, do,\" urged Mrs. Blackford, who was getting ready to churn. Her  husband looked at the old-fashioned barrel and dasher arrangement,  which she was filling with cream.    \"What's the matter with the new churn?\" he asked in some surprise.    \"It's broken,\" she replied. \"It's always the way with those new-fangled  things. It works ever so much nicer than this old one, though,\"  she went on to Tom, \"but it gets out of order easy.\"    \"Let me look at it,\" suggested the young inventor. \"I know something  about machinery.\"    The churn, which worked by a system of cogs and a handle, was  brought from the woodshed. Tom soon saw what the trouble was. One of  the cogs had become displaced. It did not take him five minutes,  with the tools he carried on his motor-cycle, to put it back, and  the churn was ready to use.    \"Well, I declare!\" exclaimed Mrs. Blackford. \"You are handy at such  things!\"    \"Oh, it's just a knack,\" replied Tom modestly. \"Now I'll put a plug  in there, and the cog wheel won't come loose again. The  manufacturers of it ought to have done that. I imagine lots of  people have this same trouble with these churns.\"    \"Indeed they do,\" asserted Mrs. Blackford. \"Sallie Armstrong has  one, and it got out of order the first week they had it. I'll let  her look at mine, and maybe her husband can fix it.\"    \"I'd go and do it myself, but I want to get home,\" said Tom, and  then he showed her how, by inserting a small iron plug in a certain  place, there would be no danger of the cog coming loose again.    \"That's certainly slick!\" exclaimed Mr. Blackford. \"Well, I wish you  good luck, Mr. Swift, and if I see those scoundrels around this  neighborhood again I'll make 'em wish they'd let you alone.\"    \"That's what,\" added Jed, polishing his badge with his big, red  handkerchief.    Mrs. Blackford transferred the cream to the new churn which Tom had  fixed, and as he rode off down the highway on his motor-cycle, she  waved one hand to him, while with the other she operated the handle  of the apparatus.    \"Now for a quick run to Shopton to tell dad the bad news,\" spoke Tom  to himself as he turned on full speed and dashed away. \"My trip has  been a failure so far.\"          CHAPTER XVII.    MR. SWIFT IN DESPAIR      Tom was thinking of many things as his speedy machine carried him  mile after mile nearer home. By noon he was over half way on his  journey, and he stopped in a small village for his dinner.    \"I think I'll make inquiries of the police here, to see if they  caught sight of those men,\" decided Tom as he left the restaurant.  \"Though I am inclined to believe they kept on to Albany, or some  large city, where they have their headquarters. They will want to  make use of dad's model as soon as possible, though what they will  do with it I don't know.\" He tried to telephone to his father, but  could get no connection, as the wire was being repaired.    The police force of the place where Tom had stopped for lunch was  like the town itself--small and not of much consequence. The chief  constable, for he was not what one could call a chief of police, had  heard of the matter from the alarm sent out in all directions from  Dunkirk, where Mr. Blackford lived.    \"You don't mean to tell me you're the young man who was chloroformed  and robbed!\" exclaimed the constable, looking at Tom as if he  doubted his word.    \"I'm the young man,\" declared our hero. \"Have you seen anything of  the thieves?\"    \"Not a thing, though I've instructed all my men to keep a sharp  lookout for a red automobile, with three scoundrels in it. My men  are to make an arrest on sight.\"    \"How many men have you?\"    \"Two,\" was the rather surprising answer; \"but one has to work on a  farm daytimes, so I ain't really got but one in what you might call  active service.\"    Tom restrained a desire to laugh. At any rate, the aged constable  meant well.    \"One of my men seen a red automobile, a little while before you come  in my office,\" went on the official, \"but it wasn't the one wanted,  'cause a young woman was running it all alone. It struck me as  rather curious that a woman would trust herself all alone in one of  them things; wouldn't it you?\"    \"Oh, no, women and young ladies often operate them,\" said Tom.    \"I should think you'd find one handier than the two-wheeled  apparatus you have out there,\" went on the constable, indicating the  motor-cycle, which Tom had stood up against a tree.    \"I may have one some day,\" replied the young inventor. \"But I guess  I'll be moving on now. Here's my address, in case you hear anything  of those men, but I don't imagine you will.\"    \"Me either. Fellows as slick as them are won't come back this way  and run the chance of being arrested by my men. I have two on duty  nights,\" he went on proudly, \"besides myself, so you see we're  pretty well protected.\"    Tom thanked him for the trouble he had taken, and was soon on his  way again. He swept on along the quiet country roads anxious for the  time when he could consult with his father over what would be the  best course to take.    When Tom was about a mile away from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42324"],[0,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus (#15)"],[1,"a; the  gates of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night  at Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city.  The sky was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit  the spot where my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass  through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at  Plainpalais. During this short voyage I saw the lightnings playing on  the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm  appeared to approach rapidly; and, on landing, I ascended a low hill,  that I might observe its progress. It advanced; the heavens were  clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its  violence quickly increased.    I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm  increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over  my head. It was echoed from Saleve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy;  vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake,  making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every  thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself from  the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in Switzerland,  appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The most violent storm  hung exactly north of the town, over that part of the lake which lies  between the promontory of Belrive and the village of Copet. Another  storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another darkened and  sometimes disclosed the Mole, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake.    While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on  with a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I  clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud, \"William, dear angel! this is thy  funeral, this thy dirge!\" As I said these words, I perceived in the  gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood  fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning  illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its  gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect, more hideous than  belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the  filthy daemon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be  (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner  did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its  truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for  support. The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom.  Nothing in human shape could have destroyed that fair child. _He_ was  the murderer! I could not doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an  irresistible proof of the fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it  would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging  among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Saleve, a  hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south. He soon reached the summit,  and disappeared.    I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued,  and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I revolved in  my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole  train of my progress towards the creation; the appearance of the work of  my own hands alive at my bedside; its departure. Two years had now  nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was  this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a depraved  wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my  brother?    No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the  night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel  the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of  evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind,  and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such  as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own  vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy  all that was dear to me.    Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were  open, and I hastened to my father's house. My first thought was to  discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be  made. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A  being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at  midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I remembered  also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time  that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a  tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that if any other had  communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the  ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature of the animal would  elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my  relatives to commence it. And then of what use would be pursuit? Who  could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont  Saleve? These reflections determined me, and I resolved to remain  silent.    It was about five in the morning when I entered my father's house. I  told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library  to attend their usual hour of rising.    Six years had elapsed, passed as a dream but for one indelible trace,  and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before  my departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still  remained to me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over  the mantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father's  desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair,  kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her  cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly  permitted the sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of  William; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus  engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome  me. He expressed a sorrowful delight to see me: \"Welcome, my dearest  Victor,\" said he. \"Ah! I wish you had come three months ago, and then  you would have found us all joyous and delighted. You come to us now to  share a misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I  hope, revive our father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; and  your persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and  tormenting self-accusations.--Poor William! he was our darling and our  pride!\"    Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother's eyes; a sense of mortal  agony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the wretchedness  of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and a not less  terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more minutely  concerning my father, and her I named my cousin.    \"She most of all,\" said Ernest, \"requires consolation; she accused  herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her very  wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered--\"    \"The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt  to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the  winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he was  free last night!\"    \"I do not know what you mean,\" replied my brother, in accents of wonder,  \"but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No one would  believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced,  notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit that Justine  Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family, could suddenly  become capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?\"    \"Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is  wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?\"    \"No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have  almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so  confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,  leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried to-day, and you will  then hear all.\"    He related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had  been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her bed for  several days. During this interval, one of the servants, happening to  examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had  discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which had been judged  to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant instantly showed it to  one of the others, who, without saying a word to any of the family, went  to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended. On  being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a  great measure by her extreme confusion of manner.    This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied  earnestly, \"You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor,  good Justine, is innocent.\"    At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on  his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after  we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other  topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, \"Good God,  papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William.\"    \"We do also, unfortunately,\" replied my father; \"for indeed I had rather  have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and  ingratitude in one I valued so highly.\"    \"My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.\"    \"If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be  tried to-day, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.\"    This speech calmed me. I"]]]
