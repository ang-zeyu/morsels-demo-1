We said we yearned to hear it, that we wanted a good laugh; and they went  downstairs, and fetched Herr Slossenn Boschen.    He appeared to be quite pleased to sing it, for he came up at once, and  sat down to the piano without another word.    \"Oh, it will amuse you.  You will laugh,\" whispered the two young men, as  they passed through the room, and took up an unobtrusive position behind  the Professor's back.    Herr Slossenn Boschen accompanied himself.  The prelude did not suggest a  comic song exactly.  It was a weird, soulful air.  It quite made one's  flesh creep; but we murmured to one another that it was the German  method, and prepared to enjoy it.    I don't understand German myself.  I learned it at school, but forgot  every word of it two years after I had left, and have felt much better  ever since.  Still, I did not want the people there to guess my  ignorance; so I hit upon what I thought to be rather a good idea.  I kept  my eye on the two young students, and followed them.  When they tittered,  I tittered; when they roared, I roared; and I also threw in a little  snigger all by myself now and then, as if I had seen a bit of humour that  had escaped the others.  I considered this particularly artful on my  part.    I noticed, as the song progressed, that a good many other people seemed  to have their eye fixed on the two young men, as well as myself.  These  other people also tittered when the young men tittered, and roared when  the young men roared; and, as the two young men tittered and roared and  exploded with laughter pretty continuously all through the song, it went  exceedingly well.    And yet that German Professor did not seem happy.  At first, when we  began to laugh, the expression of his face was one of intense surprise,  as if laughter were the very last thing he had expected to be greeted  with.  We thought this very funny: we said his earnest manner was half  the humour.  The slightest hint on his part that he knew how funny he was  would have completely ruined it all.  As we continued to laugh, his  surprise gave way to an air of annoyance and indignation, and he scowled  fiercely round upon us all (except upon the two young men who, being  behind him, he could not see).  That sent us into convulsions.  We told  each other that it would be the death of us, this thing.  The words  alone, we said, were enough to send us into fits, but added to his mock  seriousness--oh, it was too much!    In the last verse, he surpassed himself.  He glowered round upon us with  a look of such concentrated ferocity that, but for our being forewarned  as to the German method of comic singing, we should have been nervous;  and he threw such a wailing note of agony into the weird music that, if  we had not known it was a funny song, we might have wept.    He finished amid a perfect shriek of laughter.  We said it was the  funniest thing we had ever heard in all our lives.  We said how strange  it was that, in the face of things like these, there should be a popular  notion that the Germans hadn't any sense of humour.  And we asked the  Professor why he didn't translate the song into English, so that the  common people could understand it, and hear what a real comic song was  like.    Then Herr Slossenn Boschen got up, and went on awful.  He swore at us in  German (which I should judge to be a singularly effective language for  that purpose), and he danced, and shook his fists, and called us all the  English he knew.  He said he had never been so insulted in all his life.    It appeared that the song was not a comic song at all.  It was about a  young girl who lived in the Hartz Mountains, and who had given up her  life to save her lover's soul; and he died, and met her spirit in the  air; and then, in the last verse, he jilted her spirit, and went on with  another spirit--I'm not quite sure of the details, but it was something  very sad, I know.  Herr Boschen said he had sung it once before the  German Emperor, and he (the German Emperor) had sobbed like a little  child.  He (Herr Boschen) said it was generally acknowledged to be one of  the most tragic and pathetic songs in the German language.    It was a trying situation for us--very trying.  There seemed to be no  answer.  We looked around for the two young men who had done this thing,  but they had left the house in an unostentatious manner immediately after  the end of the song.    That was the end of that party.  I never saw a party break up so quietly,  and with so little fuss.  We never said good-night even to one another.  We came downstairs one at a time, walking softly, and keeping the shady  side.  We asked the servant for our hats and coats in whispers, and  opened the door for ourselves, and slipped out, and got round the corner  quickly, avoiding each other as much as possible.    I have never taken much interest in German songs since then.    We reached Sunbury Lock at half-past three.  The river is sweetly pretty  just there before you come to the gates, and the backwater is charming;  but don't attempt to row up it.    I tried to do so once.  I was sculling, and asked the fellows who were  steering if they thought it could be done, and they said, oh, yes, they  thought so, if I pulled hard.  We were just under the little foot-bridge  that crosses it between the two weirs, when they said this, and I bent  down over the sculls, and set myself up, and pulled.    I pulled splendidly.  I got well into a steady rhythmical swing.  I put  my arms, and my legs, and my back into it.  I set myself a good, quick,  dashing stroke, and worked in really grand style.  My two friends said it  was a pleasure to watch me.  At the end of five minutes, I thought we  ought to be pretty near the weir, and I looked up.  We were under the  bridge, in exactly the same spot that we were when I began, and there  were those two idiots, injuring themselves by violent laughing.  I had  been grinding away like mad to keep that boat stuck still under that  bridge.  I let other people pull up backwaters against strong streams  now.    We sculled up to Walton, a rather large place for a riverside town.  As  with all riverside places, only the tiniest corner of it comes down to  the water, so that from the boat you might fancy it was a village of some  half-dozen houses, all told.  Windsor and Abingdon are the only towns  between London and Oxford that you can really see anything of from the  stream.  All the others hide round corners, and merely peep at the river  down one street: my thanks to them for being so considerate, and leaving  the river-banks to woods and fields and water-works.    Even Reading, though it does its best to spoil and sully and make hideous  as much of the river as it can reach, is good-natured enough to keep its  ugly face a good deal out of sight.    Caesar, of course, had a little place at Walton--a camp, or an  entrenchment, or something of that sort.  Caesar was a regular up-river  man.  Also Queen Elizabeth, she was there, too.  You can never get away  from that woman, go where you will.  Cromwell and Bradshaw (not the guide  man, but the King Charles's head man) likewise sojourned here.  They must  have been quite a pleasant little party, altogether.    There is an iron \"scold's bridle\" in Walton Church.  They used these  things in ancient days for curbing women's tongues.  They have given up  the attempt now.  I suppose iron was getting scarce, and nothing else  would be strong enough.    There are also tombs of note in the church, and I was afraid I should  never get Harris past them; but he didn't seem to think of them, and we  went on.  Above the bridge the river winds tremendously.  This makes it  look picturesque; but it irritates you from a towing or sculling point of  view, and causes argument between the man who is pulling and the man who  is steering.    You pass Oatlands Park on the right bank here.  It is a famous old place.  Henry VIII. stole it from some one or the other, I forget whom now, and  lived in it.  There is a grotto in the park which you can see for a fee,  and which is supposed to be very wonderful; but I cannot see much in it  myself.  The late Duchess of York, who lived at Oatlands, was very fond  of dogs, and kept an immense number.  She had a special graveyard made,  in which to bury them when they died, and there they lie, about fifty of  them, with a tombstone over each, and an epitaph inscribed thereon.    Well, I dare say they deserve it quite as much as the average Christian  does.    At \"Corway Stakes\"--the first bend above Walton Bridge--was fought a  battle between Caesar and Cassivelaunus.  Cassivelaunus had prepared the  river for Caesar, by planting it full of stakes (and had, no doubt, put  up a notice-board).  But Caesar crossed in spite of this.  You couldn't  choke Caesar off that river.  He is the sort of man we want round the  backwaters now.    Halliford and Shepperton are both pretty little spots where they touch  the river; but there is nothing remarkable about either of them.  There  is a tomb in Shepperton churchyard, however, with a poem on it, and I was  nervous lest Harris should want to get out and fool round it.  I saw him  fix a longing eye on the landing-stage as we drew near it, so I managed,  by an adroit movement, to jerk his cap into the water, and in the  excitement of recovering that, and his indignation at my clumsiness, he  forgot all about his beloved graves.    At Weybridge, the Wey (a pretty little stream, navigable for small boats  up to Guildford, and one which I have always been making up my mind to  explore, and never have), the Bourne, and the Basingstoke Canal all enter  the Thames together.  The lock is just opposite the town, and the first  thing that we saw, when we came in view of it, was George's blazer on one  of the lock gates, closer inspection showing that George was inside it."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30802"],[0,"Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book the First (#15)"],[1," disagreeable, is much more desirable for the  public good, than equity without law; which would make every judge a  legislator, and introduce most infinite confusion; as there would then  be almost as many different rules of action laid down in our courts,  as there are differences of capacity and sentiment in the human mind.          SECTION THE THIRD.    OF THE LAWS OF ENGLAND.      THE municipal law of England, or the rule of civil conduct prescribed  to the inhabitants of this kingdom, may with sufficient propriety be  divided into two kinds; the _lex non scripta_, the unwritten, or  common law; and the _lex scripta_, the written, or statute law.    THE _lex non scripta_, or unwritten law, includes not only _general  customs_, or the common law properly so called; but also the  _particular customs_ of certain parts of the kingdom; and likewise  those _particular laws_, that are by custom observed only in certain  courts and jurisdictions.    WHEN I call these parts of our law _leges non scriptae_, I would not  be understood as if all those laws were at present merely _oral_, or  communicated from the former ages to the present solely by word of  mouth. It is true indeed that, in the profound ignorance of letters  which formerly overspread the whole western world, all laws were  intirely traditional, for this plain reason, that the nations among  which they prevailed had but little idea of writing. Thus the British  as well as the Gallic druids committed all their laws as well as  learning to memory[a]; and it is said of the primitive Saxons here, as  well as their brethren on the continent, that _leges sola memoria et  usu retinebant_[b]. But with us at present the monuments and evidences  of our legal customs are contained in the records of the several  courts of justice, in books of reports and judicial decisions, and in  the treatises of learned sages of the profession, preserved and handed  down to us from the times of highest antiquity. However I therefore  stile these parts of our law _leges non scriptae_, because their  original institution and authority are not set down in writing, as  acts of parliament are, but they receive their binding power, and the  force of laws, by long and immemorial usage, and by their universal  reception throughout the kingdom. In like manner as Aulus Gellius  defines the _jus non scriptum_ to be that, which is \"_tacito et  illiterato hominum consensu et moribus expressum_.\"    [Footnote a: _Caes. de b. G._ _lib._ 6. _c._ 13.]    [Footnote b: Spelm. Gl. 362.]    OUR antient lawyers, and particularly Fortescue[c], insist with  abundance of warmth, that these customs are as old as the primitive  Britons, and continued down, through the several mutations of  government and inhabitants, to the present time, unchanged and  unadulterated. This may be the case as to some; but in general, as Mr  Selden in his notes observes, this assertion must be understood with  many grains of allowance; and ought only to signify, as the truth  seems to be, that there never was any formal exchange of one system of  laws for another: though doubtless by the intermixture of adventitious  nations, the Romans, the Picts, the Saxons, the Danes, and the  Normans, they must have insensibly introduced and incorporated many of  their own customs with those that were before established: thereby in  all probability improving the texture and wisdom of the whole, by the  accumulated wisdom of divers particular countries. Our laws, saith  lord Bacon[d], are mixed as our language: and as our language is so  much the richer, the laws are the more complete.    [Footnote c: _c._ 17.]    [Footnote d: See his proposals for a digest.]    AND indeed our antiquarians and first historians do all positively  assure us, that our body of laws is of this compounded nature. For  they tell us, that in the time of Alfred the local customs of the  several provinces of the kingdom were grown so various, that he found  it expedient to compile his _dome-book_ or _liber judicialis_, for the  general use of the whole kingdom. This book is said to have been  extant so late as the reign of king Edward the fourth, but is now  unfortunately lost. It contained, we may probably suppose, the  principal maxims of the common law, the penalties for misdemesnors,  and the forms of judicial proceedings. Thus much may at least be  collected from that injunction to observe it, which we find in the  laws of king Edward the elder, the son of Alfred[e]. \"_Omnibus qui  reipublicae praesunt, etiam atque etiam mando, ut omnibus aequos se  praebeant judices, perinde ac in judiciali libro_ (_Saxonice_,  [Anglo-Saxon: dom-bec]) _scriptum habetur; nec quicquam formident quin  jus commune_ (_Saxonice_, [Anglo-Saxon: folcrihte]) _audacter  libereque dicant._\"    [Footnote e: _c._ 1.]    BUT the irruption and establishment of the Danes in England which  followed soon after, introduced new customs and caused this code of  Alfred in many provinces to fall into disuse; or at least to be mixed  and debased with other laws of a coarser alloy. So that about the  beginning of the eleventh century there were three principal systems  of laws prevailing in different districts. 1. The _Mercen-Lage_, or  Mercian laws, which were observed in many of the midland counties, and  those bordering on the principality of Wales; the retreat of the  antient Britons; and therefore very probably intermixed with the  British or Druidical customs. 2. The _West-Saxon-Lage_, or laws of the  west Saxons, which obtained in the counties to the south and west of  the island, from Kent to Devonshire. These were probably much the same  with the laws of Alfred abovementioned, being the municipal law of the  far most considerable part of his dominions, and particularly  including Berkshire, the seat of his peculiar residence. 3. The  _Dane-Lage_, or Danish law, the very name of which speaks it's  original and composition. This was principally maintained in the rest  of the midland counties, and also on the eastern coast, the seat of  that piratical people. As for the very northern provinces, they were  at that time under a distinct government[f].    [Footnote f: Hal. Hist. 55.]    OUT of these three laws, Roger Hoveden[g] and Ranulphus Cestrensis[h]  inform us, king Edward the confessor extracted one uniform law or  digest of laws, to be observed throughout the whole kingdom; though  Hoveden and the author of an old manuscript chronicle[i] assure us  likewise, that this work was projected and begun by his grandfather  king Edgar. And indeed a general digest of the same nature has been  constantly found expedient, and therefore put in practice by other  great nations, formed from an assemblage of little provinces, governed  by peculiar customs. As in Portugal, under king Edward, about the  beginning of the fifteenth century[k]. In Spain under Alonzo X, who  about the year 1250 executed the plan of his father St. Ferdinand, and  collected all the provincial customs into one uniform law, in the  celebrated code entitled _las partidas_[l]. And in Sweden about the  same aera, a universal body of common law was compiled out of the  particular customs established by the laghman of every province, and  intitled the _land's lagh_, being analogous to the _common law_ of  England[m].    [Footnote g: _in Hen. II._]    [Footnote h: _in Edw. Confessor._]    [Footnote i: _in Seld. ad Eadmer._ 6.]    [Footnote k: Mod. Un. Hist. xxii. 135.]    [Footnote l: Ibid. xx. 211.]    [Footnote m: Ibid. xxxiii. 21, 58.]    BOTH these undertakings, of king Edgar and Edward the confessor, seem  to have been no more than a new edition, or fresh promulgation, of  Alfred's code or dome-book, with such additions and improvements as  the experience of a century and an half had suggested. For Alfred is  generally stiled by the same historians the _legum Anglicanarum  conditor_, as Edward the confessor is the _restitutor_. These however  are the laws which our histories so often mention under the name of  the laws of Edward the confessor; which our ancestors struggled so  hardly to maintain, under the first princes of the Norman line; and  which subsequent princes so frequently promised to keep and to  restore, as the most popular act they could do, when pressed by  foreign emergencies or domestic discontents. These are the laws, that  so vigorously withstood the repeated attacks of the civil law; which  established in the twelfth century a new Roman empire over most of the  states on the continent: states that have lost, and perhaps upon that  account, their political liberties; while the free constitution of  England, perhaps upon the same account, has been rather improved than  debased. These, in short, are the laws which gave rise and original to  that collection of maxims and customs, which is now known by the name  of the common law. A name either given to it, in contradistinction to  other laws, as the statute law, the civil law, the law merchant, and  the like; or, more probably, as a law _common_ to all the realm, the  _jus commune_ or _folcright_ mentioned by king Edward the elder, after  the abolition of the several provincial customs and particular laws  beforementioned.    BUT though this is the most likely foundation of this collection of  maxims and customs, yet the maxims and customs, so collected, are of  higher antiquity than memory or history can reach: nothing being more  difficult than to ascertain the precise beginning and first spring of  an antient and long established custom. Whence it is that in our law  the goodness of a custom depends upon it's having been used time out  of mind; or, in the solemnity of our legal phrase, time whereof the  memory of man runneth not to the contrary. This it is that gives it  it's weight and authority; and of this nature are the maxims and  customs which compose the common law, or _lex non scripta_, of this  kingdom.    THIS unwritten, or common, law is properly"]]]
