I spent  four or five hours at the top of this hill, basking in the sun, as it  was delightfully hot. I saw several swallow-tailed butterflies, also a  number of bees, wasps and horse flies. Major Morshead and his surveyors  soon afterwards joined us, intending to take advantage of the fine view.  In the afternoon I left the peak and descended into the valley in search  of our new camp, for we had now left the Yaru and had turned up into the  valley of the Bhong-chu, a river that flowed from the West, with a very  considerable volume of water. As there was rinderpest in the valley, our  transport consisted now of donkeys only, many of them being very  diminutive in size, but quite accustomed to carrying heavy loads. Our  camp was pitched at a place called Trangso Chumbab, where there was an  old Chinese rest-house. The Bhong-chu here was nearly 200 yards in  width, but there was quite a good ford across it to Tsogo. Here we found  many flourishing villages and much cultivation. We seemed to be entering  a much more populated part of the country; from the top of the hill I  counted in one valley no less than fifteen villages and quite a number  of willow groves. From here a longish march of 18 miles up the valley of  the Bhong-chu brought us to Kyishong--a pretty little village on the  banks of the river. There were a few willow trees here and a lot of sea  buckthorn. I did not keep to the road, but started early across a big  plain on which I was lucky enough to shoot a goa with quite  good horns. The day was very hot and sultry, and after crossing the  plain I went up a side valley which turned out to be extremely pretty.  It was very narrow and a mass of wild rose bushes. These roses were all  of a creamy yellow, and every bush was covered with hundreds of  sweet-smelling flowers. There was also a curious black clematis and  several species of broom and rock cistus. Here and there were grassy  patches with bubbling springs of crystal clearness. Rock pigeons,  Brahminy ducks, blackbirds and numerous other varieties of small birds  came down to drink here and did not mind us at all. About two o'clock  the weather suddenly changed and violent thunderstorms started all  round us, first on the opposite side of the valley and then on every  side. Heavy hail came down at the same time and the ground soon became  white. On descending into the valley, I put up what was to me a new kind  of partridge, also numerous mountain hares. On emerging into the main  valley, I noticed a group of five large Chortens. I was told that the  centre Chorten had been built over a very bad demon, and that it kept  him down. The other four Chortens at the corners prevented his ever  getting away.    The next day's march to Shekar Dzong was a short one of only 12 miles.  We followed the main valley for about 6 miles through some interesting  conglomerate gorges alternating with open spaces covered with sea  buckthorn. We then turned off Northwards up a side valley which led us  to the town and fort of Shekar. This place was very finely situated on a  big rocky and sharp-pointed mountain like an enlarged St. Michael's  Mount. The actual town stands at the foot of the hill, but a large  monastery, holding over 400 monks and consisting of innumerable  buildings, is literally perched half-way up the cliff. The buildings are  connected by walls and towers with the fort, which rises above them all.  The fort again is connected by turreted walls with a curious Gothic-like  structure on the summit of the hill where incense is offered up daily.  On our arrival the whole town turned out and surrounded us with much  curiosity, for we were the first Europeans that they had ever seen. A  small tent had been pitched for us, but there was such a crowd round it  that I retreated to a willow grove close by, which was protected by a  wall. As the Jongpen had not come to see us, Chheten Wangdi went over to  find him; presently he came along with a basket of eggs and with many  apologies for not coming before, but he said that he had had no warning  of our arrival. This was but partly true, for though our passport did  not particularly mention this place, it authorised all officials to help  us to their utmost, and the Jongpen certainly knew and had heard that we  were coming. I asked him to give orders that no intoxicating spirits  should be served out to our followers, remembering the trouble we had  had in one or two places before owing to their all getting drunk. Our  tents were all pitched inside an enclosure and in the shade of the  willow grove, and above us towered the picturesque buildings of the fort  and the monastery. This was by far the largest and most interesting  place that we had yet come across. For our mess tent we were given a  fine Chinese tent such as they always seem to keep for the entertainment  of guests of honour. As in most places, there were two Jongpens residing  here, one lay and the other ecclesiastical, and finding that Tingri was  under their jurisdiction, we asked them to issue orders to their  representatives at Tingri to help us in every way with supplies and  transport.    [Illustration: SHEKAR DZONG.]    June 17 we spent resting at Shekar. In the morning Morshead and I went  to call on the Jongpen; he lives in a poor house at the foot of the  hill, his official residence being three-quarters of the way up, but he  wisely prefers to live at the bottom, not being very fond of exercise.  He was busy adding on to his house, and we were shown into the old part  in which he was living. He gave us the usual Tibetan tea and sweetmeats  and then insisted on our having macaroni and meat seasoned with  chillies, which was excellent, followed by junket served in china bowls.  He had some very fine teacups of agate and hornblende schist with finely  chased silver covers, which I admired very much. That afternoon several  of us went up to visit the big monastery of Shekar Choe-te. This  consisted of a great number of buildings terraced one above the other on  a very steep rocky slope. A path along the face of the rock brought us  to several archways under which we passed. We then had to go up and down  some picturesque but very steep and narrow streets until we came to a  large courtyard. On one side of this was the main temple. In this temple  were several gilt statues of Buddha decorated all over with turquoises  and other precious stones, and behind them a huge figure of Buddha quite  50 feet high. Every year, they told us, they had to re-gild his face.  Around were eight curious figures about 10 feet high and dressed in  quaint flounces which they said were the guardians of the shrine. We  then went up steep and slippery ladders, in almost pitch darkness, and  came out on a platform opposite the face of the great Buddha. Here were  some beautifully chased silver teapots and other interesting pieces of  silver, richly decorated in relief. Inside the shrine, which was very  dark, the smell of rancid butter was almost overpowering as all the  lamps burnt butter. The official head of the monastery showed us round.  He was apparently appointed from Lhasa and was responsible for all the  revenues and financial dealings of the monastery. We were given very  buttery tea in the roof courtyard, which was a pleasant spot, and here I  photographed a group of several monks. They had never seen a camera or  photographs before, but they had heard that such a thing was possible  and were very much interested in it. Before leaving we went in to see  the Head Lama who had lived over sixty-six years in this monastery. He  was looked upon as being extremely holy and as the re-incarnation of a  former abbot, and they therefore practically worshipped him. There was  only one tooth left in his mouth, but for all that he had a very  pleasant smile. All around his room were silver-gilt Chortens inlaid  with turquoises and precious stones and incense was being burnt  everywhere. After much persuasion the other monks induced him to come  outside and have his photograph taken, telling him that he was an old  man, and that his time on earth was now short, and they would like to  have a picture of him to remember him by. He was accordingly brought  out, dressed up in robes of beautiful golden brocades, with priceless  silk Chinese hangings arranged behind him while he sat on a raised dais  with his dorje and his bell in front of him, placed upon a finely carved  Chinese table. The fame of this photograph spread throughout the country  and in places hundreds of miles away I was asked for photographs of the  Old Abbot of Shekar Choe-te, nor could I give a more welcome present at  any house than a photograph of the Old Abbot. Being looked upon as a  saint, he was worshipped, and they would put these little photographs in  shrines and burn incense in front of them.    [Illustration: THE ABBOT OF SHEKAR CHOeTE.]    About midnight that night I was suddenly awakened by yells and loud  shouting and hammering close to my tent and next to that in which  Bullock and Mallory were sleeping. The latter turned out and found that  a Tibetan had seized an ice axe and a mallet and was busy hammering on  our store boxes. He gave chase, but failed to catch the intruder. Some  of our coolies, however, found out where he had gone to, and Chheten  Wangdi had him handed over to the Jongpen. On investigation in the  morning the man proved to be a madman whom his parents always kept  locked up during nights when the moon was full, but he had managed to  escape, so we handed him back to his family.    Our transport was very slow in arriving, and there were so many delays  that it was midday before the procession finally moved off. The loads,  too, were very badly put on and kept falling off, also the transport was  quite the worst that we had yet had. For about 5 miles the path went up"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39465"],[0,"Eleven Years in the Rocky Mountains and Life on the Frontier (#15)"],[1,"; 'but you war quiet enough when the bear was around.' 'Why,  Nelson,' I answered, 'you wouldn't have us noisy before that  distinguished guest of yours?' But Nelson damned the wild beast; and  Craig and I laughed, and said he didn't seem wild a bit. That's the way  we hector each other in the mountains. If a man gets into trouble he is  only laughed at: 'let him keep out; let him have better luck,' is what  we say.\"    The country traversed by Sublette in the fall of 1829, was unknown at  that period, even to the fur companies, they having kept either farther  to the south or to the north. Few, if any, white men had passed through  it since Lewis and Clarke discovered the head-waters of the Missouri and  the Snake Rivers, which flow from the opposite sides of the same  mountain peaks. Even the toils and hardships of passing over mountains  at this season of the year, did not deprive the trapper of the enjoyment  of the magnificent scenery the region afforded. Splendid views, however,  could not long beguile men who had little to eat, and who had yet a long  journey to accomplish in cold, and surrounded by dangers, before  reaching the wintering ground.    In November the camp left Missouri Lake on the east side of the  mountains, and crossed over, still northeasterly, on to the Gallatin  fork of the Missouri River, passing over a very rough and broken  country. They were, in fact, still in the midst of mountains, being  spurs of the great Rocky range, and equally high and rugged. A  particularly high mountain lay between them and the main Yellowstone  River. This they had just crossed, with great fatigue and difficulty,  and were resting the camp and horses for a few days on the river's bank,  when the Blackfeet once more attacked them in considerable numbers. Two  men were killed in this fight, and the camp thrown into confusion by the  suddenness of the alarm. Capt. Sublette, however, got off, with most of  his men, still pursued by the Indians.    Not so our Joe, who this time was not in luck, but was cut off from  camp, alone, and had to flee to the high mountains overlooking the  Yellowstone. Here was a situation for a nineteen-year-old raw recruit!  Knowing that the Blackfeet were on the trail of the camp, it was death  to proceed in that direction. Some other route must be taken to come up  with them; the country was entirely unknown to him; the cold severe; his  mule, blanket, and gun, his only earthly possessions. On the latter he  depended for food, but game was scarce; and besides, he thought the  sound of his gun would frighten himself, so alone in the wilderness,  swarming with stealthy foes.    Hiding his mule in a thicket, he ascended to the mountain top to take a  view of the country, and decide upon his course. And what a scene was  that for the miserable boy, whose chance of meeting with his comrades  again was small indeed! At his feet rolled the Yellowstone River,  coursing away through the great plain to the eastward. To the north his  eye follows the windings of the Missouri, as upon a map, but playing at  hide-and-seek in amongst the mountains. Looking back, he saw the River  Snake stretching its serpentine length through lava plains, far away, to  its junction with the Columbia. To the north, and to the south, one  white mountain rose above another as far as the eye could reach. What a  mighty and magnificent world it seemed, to be alone in! Poor Joe  succumbed to the influence of the thought, and wept.    Having indulged in this sole remaining luxury of life, Joe picked up his  resolution, and decided upon his course. To the southeast lay the Crow  country, a land of plenty,--as the mountain-man regards plenty,--and  there he could at least live; provided the Crows permitted him to do so.  Besides, he had some hopes of falling in with one of the camps, by  taking that course.    Descending the mountain to the hiding-place of his mule, by which time  it was dark night, hungry and freezing, Joe still could not light a  fire, for fear of revealing his whereabouts to the Indians; nor could he  remain to perish with cold. Travel he must, and travel he did, going he  scarcely knew whither. Looking back upon the terrors and discomforts of  that night, the veteran mountaineer yet regards it as about the most  miserable one of his life. When day at length broke, he had made, as  well as he could estimate the distance, about thirty miles. Traveling on  toward the southeast, he had crossed the Yellowstone River, and still  among the mountains, was obliged to abandon his mule and accoutrements,  retaining only one blanket and his gun. Neither the mule nor himself had  broken fast in the last two days. Keeping a southerly course for twenty  miles more, over a rough and elevated country, he came, on the evening  of the third day, upon a band of mountain sheep. With what eagerness did  he hasten to kill, cook, and eat! Three days of fasting was, for a  novice, quite sufficient to provide him with an appetite.    Having eaten voraciously, and being quite overcome with fatigue, Joe  fell asleep in his blanket, and slumbered quite deeply until morning.  With the morning came biting blasts from the north, that made motion  necessary if not pleasant. Refreshed by sleep and food, our traveler  hastened on upon his solitary way, taking with him what sheep-meat he  could carry, traversing the same rough and mountainous country as  before. No incidents nor alarms varied the horrible and monotonous  solitude of the wilderness. The very absence of anything to alarm was  awful; for the bravest man is wretchedly nervous in the solitary  presence of sublime Nature. Even the veteran hunter of the mountains can  never entirely divest himself of this feeling of awe, when his single  soul comes face to face with God's wonderful and beautiful handiwork.    At the close of the fourth day, Joe made his lonely camp in a deep  defile of the mountains, where a little fire and some roasted mutton  again comforted his inner and outer man, and another night's sleep still  farther refreshed his wearied frame. On the following morning, a very  bleak and windy one, having breakfasted on his remaining piece of  mutton, being desirous to learn something of the progress he had made,  he ascended a low mountain in the neighborhood of his camp--and behold!  the whole country beyond was smoking with the vapor from boiling  springs, and burning with gasses, issuing from small craters, each of  which was emitting a sharp whistling sound.    When the first surprise of this astonishing scene had passed, Joe began  to admire its effect in an artistic point of view. The morning being  clear, with a sharp frost, he thought himself reminded of the city of  Pittsburg, as he had beheld it on a winter morning, a couple of years  before. This, however, related only to the rising smoke and vapor; for  the extent of the volcanic region was immense, reaching far out of  sight. The general face of the country was smooth and rolling, being a  level plain, dotted with cone-shaped mounds. On the summits of these  mounds were small craters from four to eight feet in diameter.  Interspersed among these, on the level plain, were larger craters, some  of them from four to six miles across. Out of these craters issued blue  flames and molten brimstone.    For some minutes Joe gazed and wondered. Curious thoughts came into his  head, about hell and the day of doom. With that natural tendency to  reckless gayety and humorous absurdities which some temperaments are  sensible of in times of great excitement, he began to soliloquize. Said  he, to himself, \"I have been told the sun would be blown out, and the  earth burnt up. If this infernal wind keeps up, I shouldn't be surprised  if the sun war blown out. If the earth is _not_ burning up over thar,  then it is that place the old Methodist preacher used to threaten me  with. Any way it suits me to go and see what it's like.\"    On descending to the plain described, the earth was found to have a  hollow sound, and seemed threatening to break through. But Joe found the  warmth of the place most delightful, after the freezing cold of the  mountains, and remarked to himself again, that \"if it war hell, it war a  more agreeable climate than he had been in for some time.\"    He had thought the country entirely desolate, as not a living creature  had been seen in the vicinity; but while he stood gazing about him in  curious amazement, he was startled by the report of two guns, followed  by the Indian yell. While making rapid preparations for defence and  flight, if either or both should be necessary, a familiar voice greeted  him with the exclamation, \"It _is_ old Joe!\" When the adjective \"old\" is  applied to one of Meek's age at that time, it is generally understood to  be a term of endearment. \"My feelings you may imagine,\" says the \"old  Uncle Joe\" of the present time, in recalling the adventure.    Being joined by these two associates, who had been looking for him, our  traveler, no longer simply a raw recruit, but a hero of wonderful  adventures, as well as the rest of the men, proceeded with them to camp,  which they overtook the third day, attempting to cross the high  mountains between the Yellowstone and the Bighorn Rivers. If Meek had  seen hard times in the mountains alone, he did not find them much  improved in camp. The snow was so deep that the men had to keep in  advance, and break the road for the animals; and to make their condition  still more trying, there were no provisions in camp, nor any prospect of  plenty, for men or animals, until they should reach the buffalo country  beyond the mountains.    During this scarcity of provisions, some of those amusing incidents took  place with which the mountaineer will contrive to lighten his own and  his comrades' spirits, even in periods of the greatest suffering. One  which we have permission to relate, has reference to what Joe Meek calls  the \"meanest"]]]
