He left in the Carrousel  three howitzers (eight-pounders) to batter down the houses from which  the Convention might be fired upon. At four o'clock the rebel columns  marched out from every street to unite their forces. It was necessary  to take advantage of this critical moment to attack the insurgents, even  had they been regular troops. But the blood about to flow was French; it  was therefore for these misguided people, already guilty of rebellion,  to embrue their hands in the blood of their countrymen by striking the  first blow.    \"At a quarter before five o'clock the insurgents had formed. The attack  was commenced by them on all sides. They were everywhere routed. French  blood was spilled: the crime, as well as the disgrace, fell this day  upon the Sections.    \"Among the dead were everywhere to be recognized emigrants, landowners,  and nobles; the prisoners consisted for the most part of the 'chouans'  of Charette.    \"Nevertheless the Sections did not consider themselves beaten: they took  refuge in the church of St. Roch, in the theatre of the Republic, and  in the Palais Egalite; and everywhere they were heard furiously exciting  the inhabitants to arms. To spare the blood which would have been shed  the next day it was necessary that no time should be given them to  rally, but to follow them with vigour, though without incurring fresh  hazards. The General ordered Montchoisy, who commanded a reserve at the  Place de la Resolution, to form a column with two twelve-pounders, to  march by the Boulevard in order to turn the Place Vendome, to form a  junction with the picket stationed at headquarters, and to return in the  same order of column.    \"General Brune, with two howitzers, deployed in the streets of St.  Nicaise and St. Honore. General Cartaux sent two hundred men and a  four-pounder of his division by the Rue St. Thomas-du-Louvre to debouch  in the square of the Palais Egalite. General Bonaparte, who had his  horse killed under him, repaired to the Feuillans.    \"The columns began to move, St. Roch and the theatre of the Republic  were taken, by assault, when the rebels abandoned them, and retreated  to the upper part of the Rue de la Loi, and barricaded themselves on all  sides. Patrols were sent thither, and several cannon-shots were fired  during the night, in order to prevent them from throwing up defences,  which object was effectually accomplished.    \"At daybreak, the General having learned that some students from the St.  Genevieve side of the river were marching with two pieces of cannon to  succour the rebels, sent a detachment of dragoons in pursuit of them,  who seized the cannon and conducted them to the Tuileries. The enfeebled  Sections, however, still showed a front. They had barricaded the Section  of Grenelle, and placed their cannon in the principal streets. At nine  o'clock General Beruyer hastened to form his division in battle array  in the Place Vendome, marched with two eight-pounders to the Rue des  Vieux-Augustins, and pointed them in the direction of the Section Le  Pelletier. General Vachet, with a corps of 'tirailleurs', marched on his  right, ready to advance to the Place Victoire. General Brune marched  to the Perron, and planted two howitzers at the upper end of the Rue  Vivienne. General Duvigier, with his column of six hundred men, and two  twelve-pounders, advanced to the streets of St. Roch and Montmartre. The  Sections lost courage with the apprehension of seeing their retreat cut  off, and evacuated the post at the sight of our soldiers, forgetting  the honour of the French name which they had to support. The Section of  Brutus still caused some uneasiness. The wife of a representative had  been arrested there. General Duvigier was ordered to proceed along the  Boulevard as far as the Rue Poissonniere. General Beruyer took up a  position at the Place Victoire, and General Bonaparte occupied the  Pont-au-Change.    \"The Section of Brutus was surrounded, and the troops advanced upon the  Place de Greve, where the crowd poured in from the Isle St. Louis, from  the Theatre Francais, and from the Palace. Everywhere the patriots  had regained their courage, while the poniards of the emigrants, armed  against us, had disappeared. The people universally admitted their  error.    \"The next day the two Sections of Les Pelletier and the Theatre Francais  were disarmed.\"    The result of this petty civil war brought Bonaparte forward; but the  party he defeated at that period never pardoned him for the past, and  that which he supported dreaded him in the future. Five years after he  will be found reviving the principles which he combated on the 5th  of October 1795. On being appointed, on the motion of Barras,  Lieutenant-General of the Army of the Interior, he established his  headquarters in the Rue Neuve des Capucines. The statement in the  'Manuscrit de Sainte Helene', that after the 13th Brumaire he remained  unemployed at Paris, is therefore obviously erroneous. So far from this,  he was incessantly occupied with the policy of the nation, and with his  own fortunes. Bonaparte was in constant, almost daily, communication  with every one then in power, and knew how to profit by all he saw or  heard.    To avoid returning to this 'Manuscrit de Sainte Helene', which at the  period of its appearance attracted more attention than it deserved, and  which was very generally attributed to Bonaparte, I shall here say a few  words respecting it. I shall briefly repeat what I said in a note when  my opinion was asked, under high authority, by a minister of Louis  XVIII.    No reader intimately acquainted with public affairs can be deceived by  the pretended authenticity of this pamphlet. What does it contain? Facts  perverted and heaped together without method, and related in an obscure,  affected, and ridiculously sententious style. Besides what appears in  it, but which is badly placed there, it is impossible not to remark the  omission of what should necessarily be there, were Napoleon the author.  It is full of absurd and of insignificant gossip, of thoughts Napoleon  never had, expressions unknown to him, and affectations far removed  from his character. With some elevated ideas, more than one style and an  equivocal spirit can be seen in it. Professed coincidences are put close  to unpardonable anachronisms, and to the most absurd revelations. It  contains neither his thoughts, his style, his actions, nor his life.  Some truths are mimed up with an inconceivable mass of falsehoods. Some  forms of expression used by Bonaparte are occasionally met with, but  they are awkwardly introduced, and often with bad taste.    It has been reported that the pamphlet was written by M. Bertrand,  formerly an officer of the army of the Vistula, and a relation of the  Comte de Simeon, peer of France.         --['Manuscrit de Sainte Helene d'une maniere inconnue', London.     Murray; Bruxelles, De Mat, 20 Avril 1817. This work merits a note.     Metternich (vol, i. pp. 312-13) says, \"At the time when it appeared     the manuscript of St. Helena made a great impression upon Europe.     This pamphlet was generally regarded as a precursor of the memoirs     which Napoleon was thought to be writing in his place of exile. The     report soon spread that the work was conceived and executed by     Madame de Stael. Madame de Stael, for her part, attributed it to     Benjamin Constant, from whom she was at this time separated by some     disagreement.\" Afterwards it came to be known that the author was     the Marquis Lullin de Chateauvieux, a man in society, whom no one     had suspected of being able to hold a pen: Jomini (tome i. p. 8     note) says. \"It will be remarked that in the course of this work     [his life of Napoleon] the author has used some fifty pages of the     pretended 'Manuscrit de Sainte Helene'. Far from wishing to commit     a plagiarism, he considers he ought to render this homage to a     clever and original work, several false points of view in which,     however, he has combated. It would have been easy for him to     rewrite these pages in other terms, but they appeared to him to be     so well suited to the character of Napoleon that he has preferred to     preserve them.\" In the will of Napoleon occurs (see end of this     work): \"I disavow the 'Manuscrit de Sainte Helene', and the other     works under the title of Maxims, Sentences, etc., which they have     been pleased to publish during the last six years. Such rules are     not those which have guided my life: This manuscript must not be     confused with the 'Memorial of Saint Helena'.]--          CHAPTER IV.     1795-1797         On my return to Paris I meet Bonaparte--His interview with Josephine     --Bonaparte's marriage, and departure from Paris ten days after--     Portrait and character of Josephine--Bonaparte's dislike of national     property--Letter to Josephine--Letter of General Colli, and     Bonaparte's reply--Bonaparte refuses to serve with Kellerman--     Marmont's letters--Bonaparte's order to me to join the army--My     departure from Sens for Italy--Insurrection of the Venetian States.    After the 13th Vendemiaire I returned to Paris from Sens. During  the short time I stopped there I saw Bonaparte less frequently than  formerly. I had, however, no reason to attribute this to anything but  the pressure of public business with which he was now occupied. When  I did meet him it was most commonly at breakfast or dinner. One day he  called my attention to a young lady who sat opposite to him, and asked  what I thought of her. The way in which I answered his question appeared  to give him much pleasure. He then talked a great deal to me about  her, her family, and her amiable qualities; he told me that he should  probably marry her, as he was convinced that the union would make him  happy. I also gathered from his conversation that his marriage with  the young widow would probably "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35744"],[0,"The gradual acceptance of the Copernican theory of the universe (#15)"],[1,"accordingly submitted to the punishment decreed by the  authorities. But in his abjuration he plainly perjured himself,  however fully he may be pardoned for it because of the extenuating  circumstances. Had he not submitted and been straitly imprisoned, if  not burned, the world would indeed have been the poorer by the loss  of his greatest work, the _Dialoghi delle Nuove Scienze_, which he did  not publish until 1636.[290]    [Footnote 289: For full statement, see Martin: 133-207.]    [Footnote 290: Gebler: 263.]    Even more hotly debated has been the action of the Congregations in  condemning the Copernican doctrine, and sentencing Galileo as a  heretic for upholding it.[291] Though both Paul V and Urban VIII  spurred on these actions, neither signed either the decree or the  sentence, nor was the latter present at Galileo's examinations. Pope  Urban would prefer not so openly to have changed his position from  that of tolerance to his present one of active opposition caused  partly by his piqued self-respect[292] and partly by his belief that  this heresy was more dangerous even than that of Luther and  Calvin.[293] It is a much mooted question whether the infallibility of  the Church was involved or not. Though the issue at stake was not one  of faith, nor were the decrees issued by the Pope _ex cathedra_, but  by a group of Cardinals, a fallible body, yet they had the full  approbation of the Popes, and later were published in the Index  preceded by a papal bull excommunicating those who did not obey the  decrees contained therein.[294] It seems to be a matter of the letter  as opposed to the spirit of the law. De Morgan points out that  contemporary opinion as represented by Fromundus, an ardent opponent  of Galileo, did not consider the Decree of the Index or of the  Inquisition as a declaration of the Church,[295]--a position which  Galileo himself may have held, thus explaining his practical disregard  of the decree of 1616 after he was persuaded the authorities were more  favorably disposed to him. But M. Martin, himself a Catholic,  thinks[296] that theoretically the Congregations could punish Galileo  only for disobedience of the secret order,--but even so his book had  been examined and passed by the official censors.    [Footnote 291: See Gebler: 244-247; White: I, 159-167; also Martin.]    [Footnote 292: Martin: 136; and Salusbury: _Math. Coll._ \"To the  reader.\"]    [Footnote 293: Galileo: _Opere_, XV, 25.]    [Footnote 294: Putnam: I, 310.]    [Footnote 295: De Morgan: I, 98.]    [Footnote 296: Martin: 140.]    When the Index was revised under Pope Benedict XIV in 1757, largely  through the influence of the Jesuit astronomer Boscovich, so it is  said,[297] the phrase prohibiting all books teaching the immobility  of the sun, and the mobility of the earth was omitted from the  decrees.[298] But in 1820, the Master of the Sacred Palace refused to  permit the publication in Rome of a textbook on astronomy by Canon  Settele, who thereupon appealed to the Congregations. They granted his  request in August, and two years later, issued a decree approved by  Pope Pius VII ordering the Master of the Sacred Palace in future \"not  to refuse license for publication of books dealing with the mobility  of the earth and the immobility of the sun according to the common  opinion of modern astronomers\" on that ground alone.[299] The next  edition of the _Index Librorum Prohibitorum_ (1835) did not contain  the works of Copernicus, Galileo, Foscarini, a Stunica and Kepler  which had appeared in every edition up to that time since their  condemnation in 1616, (Kepler's in 1619).    [Footnote 297: _Cath. Ency._: \"Boscovich.\"]    [Footnote 298: Doc. in Favaro: 159.]    [Footnote 299: Ibid: 30, 31.]          CHAPTER III.    THE OPPOSITION AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.      The Protestant leaders had rejected the Copernican doctrine as  contrary to the Scriptures. The Roman Congregations had now condemned  Galileo for upholding this doctrine after they had prohibited it for  the same reasons. These objections are perhaps best summarized in that  open letter Foscarini wrote to the general of his order, the  Carmelites, at Naples in January, 1615,[300]--the letter that was  absolutely prohibited by the Index in March, 1616. He gave these  arguments and answered them lest, as he said, \"whilst otherwise the  opinion is favored with much probability, it be found in reality to be  extremely repugnant (as at first sight it seems) not only to physical  reasons and common principles received on all hands (which cannot do  so much harm), but also (which would be of far worse consequence) to  many authorities of Sacred Scripture. Upon which account many at first  looking into it explode it as the most fond paradox and monstrous  _capriccio_ that ever was heard of.\" \"Yet many modern authors,\" he  says further on, \"are induced to follow it, but with much hesitancy  and fear, in regard that it seemeth in their opinion so to contradict  the Holy Scriptures that it cannot possibly be reconciled to them.\"  Consequently Foscarini argued that the theory is either true or false;  if false, it ought not to be divulged; if true, the authority of the  Sacred Scriptures will not oppose it; neither does one truth  contradict another. So he turned to the Bible.    [Footnote 300: In Salusbury: _Math. Coll._: I, 471-503.]    He found that six groups of authorities seemed to oppose this  doctrine. (1) Those stating that the earth stands fast, as Eccles.  1:4. (2) Those stating that the sun moves and revolves; as Psalm XIX,  Isaiah XXXVIII, and the miracle in Josh. X:12-14. (3) Those speaking  of the heaven above and the earth beneath, as in Joel II. Also Christ  came _down_ from Heaven. (4) Those authorities who place Hell at the  center of the world, a \"common opinion of divines,\" because it ought  to be in the lowest part of the world, that is, at the center of the  sphere. Then by the Copernican hypothesis, Hell must either be in the  sun; or, if in the earth, if the earth should move about the sun, then  Hell within the earth would be in Heaven, and nothing could be more  absurd. (5) Those authorities opposing Heaven to earth and earth to  Heaven, as in Gen. I, Mat. VI, etc. Since the two are always mutually  opposed to each other, and Heaven undoubtedly refers to the  circumference, earth must necessarily be at the center. (6) Those  authorities (\"rather of fathers and divines than of the Sacred  Scriptures\") who declare that after the Day of Judgment, the sun shall  stand immovable in the east and the moon in west.    Foscarini then lays down in answer six maxims, the first of which is  that things attributed to God must be expounded metaphorically  according to our manner of understanding and of common speech. The  other maxims are more metaphysical, as that everything in the  universe, whether corruptible or incorruptible, obeys a fixed law of  its nature; so, for example, Fortune is _always_ fickle. In concluding  his defense, he claims among other things, that the Copernician is a  more admirable hypothesis than the Ptolemaic, and that it is an easy  way into astronomy and philosophy. Then he adds that there may be an  analogy between the seven-branched candlestick of the Old Testament  and the seven planets around the sun, and possibly the arrangement of  the seeds in the \"Indian Figg,\" in the pomegranate and in grapes is  all divine evidence of the solar system. With such an amusing  reversion to mediaeval analogy his spirited letter ends.    Some or all of these scriptural arguments appear in most of the  attacks on the doctrine even before its condemnation by the Index in  1616 was widely known. Besides these objections, Aristotle's and  Ptolemy's statements were endlessly repeated with implicit faith in  their accuracy. Even Sir Francis Bacon (1567-1631) with all his  modernity of thought, failed in this instance to recognize the value  of the new idea and, despite his interest in Galileo's discoveries,  harked back to the time-honored objections. At first mild in his  opposition, he later became emphatically opposed to it. In the  _Advancement of Learning_[301] (1604), he speaks of it as a possible  explanation of the celestial phenomena according to astronomy but as  contrary to natural philosophy. Some fifteen years later in the _Novum  Organon_,[302] he asserts that the assumption of the earth's movement  cannot be allowed; for, as he says in his _Thema Coeli_,[303] at  that time he considered the opinion that the earth is stationary the  truer one. Finally, in his _De Augmentis Scientiarum_[304] (1622-1623)  he speaks of the old notions of the solidity of the heavens, etc., and  adds, \"It is the absurdity of these opinions that has driven men to  the diurnal motion; which I am convinced is most false.\" He gives his  reasons in the _Descriptio Globi Intellectualis_[305] (ch. 5-6): \"In  favor of the earth [as the center of the world] we have the evidence  of our sight, and an inveterate opinion; and most of all this, that as  dense bodies are contracted into a narrow compass, and rare bodies are  widely diffused (and the area of every circle is contracted to the  center) it seems to follow almost of necessity that the narrow space  about the middle of the world be set down as the proper and peculiar  place for dense bodies.\" The sun's claims to such a situation are  satisfied through having two satellites of its own, Venus and Mercury.  Copernicus's scheme is inconvenient; it overloads the earth with a  triple motion; it creates a difficulty by separating the sun from the  number of the planets with which it has much in common; and the  \"introduction of so much immobility into nature ... and making the  moon revolve around the earth in an epicycle, and some other  assumptions of his are the speculations of one who cares not what  fictions he introduces into nature, provided his calculations answer.\"  The total absence of all"]]]
