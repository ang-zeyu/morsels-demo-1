Aladdin was  so tired that he begged to go back, but the magician beguiled him with  pleasant stories, and led him on in spite of himself. At last they came  to two mountains divided by a narrow valley. \"We will go no farther,\"  said the false uncle. \"I will show you something wonderful; only do you  gather up sticks while I kindle a fire.\" When it was lit the magician  threw on it a powder he had about him, at the same time saying some  magical words. The earth trembled a little and opened in front of them,  disclosing a square flat stone with a brass ring in the middle to raise  it by. Aladdin tried to run away, but the magician caught him and gave  him a blow that knocked him down. \"What have I done, uncle?\" he said  piteously; whereupon the magician said more kindly: \"Fear nothing, but  obey me. Beneath this stone lies a treasure which is to be yours, and  no one else may touch it, so you must do exactly as I tell you.\" At the  word treasure Aladdin forgot his fears, and grasped the ring as he was  told, saying the names of his father and grandfather. The stone came up  quite easily, and some steps appeared. \"Go down,\" said the magician; \"at  the foot of those steps you will find an open door leading into three  large halls. Tuck up your gown and go through them without touching  anything, or you will die instantly. These halls lead into a garden of  fine fruit trees. Walk on until you come to a niche in a terrace where  stands a lighted lamp. Pour out the oil it contains, and bring it to  me.\" He drew a ring from his finger and gave it to Aladdin, bidding him  prosper.    Aladdin found everything as the magician had said, gathered some fruit  off the trees, and, having got the lamp, arrived at the mouth of the  cave. The magician cried out in a great hurry: \"Make haste and give me  the lamp.\" This Aladdin refused to do until he was out of the cave. The  magician flew into a terrible passion, and throwing some more powder  on to the fire, he said something, and the stone rolled back into its  place.    The magician left Persia for ever, which plainly showed that he was no  uncle of Aladdin's, but a cunning magician, who had read in his magic  books of a wonderful lamp, which would make him the most powerful man in  the world. Though he alone knew where to find it, he could only receive  it from the hand of another. He had picked out the foolish Aladdin for  this purpose, intending to get the lamp and kill him afterward.    For two days Aladdin remained in the dark, crying and lamenting. At last  he clasped his hands in prayer, and in so doing rubbed the ring, which  the magician had forgotten to take from him. Immediately an enormous and  frightful genie rose out of the earth, saying: \"What wouldst thou with  me? I am the Slave of the Ring, and will obey thee in all things.\"  Aladdin fearlessly replied: \"Deliver me from this place!\" whereupon the  earth opened, and he found himself outside. As soon as his eyes could  bear the light he went home, but fainted on the threshold. When he came  to himself he told his mother what had passed, and showed her the lamp  and the fruits he had gathered in the garden, which were, in reality,  precious stones. He then asked for some food. \"Alas! child,\" she said,  \"I have nothing in the house, but I have spun a little cotton and will  go and sell it.\" Aladdin bade her keep her cotton, for he would sell the  lamp instead. As it was very dirty she began to rub it, that it might  fetch a higher price. Instantly a hideous genie appeared, and asked what  she would have. She fainted away, but Aladdin, snatching the lamp, said  boldly: \"Fetch me something to eat!\" The genie returned with a silver  bowl, twelve silver plates containing rich meats, two silver cups, and  two bottles of wine. Aladdin's mother, when she came to herself, said:  \"Whence comes this splendid feast?\" \"Ask not, but eat,\" replied Aladdin.  So they sat at breakfast till it was dinner-time, and Aladdin told his  mother about the lamp. She begged him to sell it, and have nothing to do  with devils. \"No,\" said Aladdin, \"since chance hath made us aware of  its virtues, we will use it, and the ring likewise, which I shall always  wear on my finger.\" When they had eaten all the genie had brought,  Aladdin sold one of the silver plates, and so on until none were left.  He then had recourse to the genie, who gave him another set of plates,  and thus they lived for many years.    One day Aladdin heard an order from the Sultan proclaimed that everyone  was to stay at home and close his shutters while the Princess, his  daughter, went to and from the bath. Aladdin was seized by a desire to  see her face, which was very difficult, as she always went veiled. He  hid himself behind the door of the bath, and peeped through a chink. The  Princess lifted her veil as she went in, and looked so beautiful that  Aladdin fell in love with her at first sight. He went home so changed  that his mother was frightened. He told her he loved the Princess so  deeply that he could not live without her, and meant to ask her in  marriage of her father. His mother, on hearing this, burst out laughing,  but Aladdin at last prevailed upon her to go before the Sultan and carry  his request. She fetched a napkin and laid in it the magic fruits from  the enchanted garden, which sparkled and shone like the most beautiful  jewels. She took these with her to please the Sultan, and set out,  trusting in the lamp. The Grand Vizier and the lords of council had  just gone in as she entered the hall and placed herself in front of the  Sultan. He, however, took no notice of her. She went every day for a  week, and stood in the same place. When the council broke up on the  sixth day the Sultan said to his Vizier: \"I see a certain woman in the  audience-chamber every day carrying something in a napkin. Call her next  time, that I may find out what she wants.\" Next day, at a sign from the  Vizier, she went up to the foot of the throne and remained kneeling till  the Sultan said to her: \"Rise, good woman, and tell me what you want.\"  She hesitated, so the Sultan sent away all but the Vizier, and bade  her speak frankly, promising to forgive her beforehand for anything she  might say. She then told him of her son's violent love for the Princess.  \"I prayed him to forget her,\" she said, \"but in vain; he threatened to  do some desperate deed if I refused to go and ask your Majesty for the  hand of the Princess. Now I pray you to forgive not me alone, but my  son Aladdin.\" The Sultan asked her kindly what she had in the  napkin, whereupon she unfolded the jewels and presented them. He was  thunderstruck, and turning to the Vizier said: \"What sayest thou? Ought  I not to bestow the Princess on one who values her at such a price?\" The  Vizier, who wanted her for his own son, begged the Sultan to withhold  her for three months, in the course of which he hoped his son would  contrive to make him a richer present. The Sultan granted this, and told  Aladdin's mother that, though he consented to the marriage, she must not  appear before him again for three months.    Aladdin waited patiently for nearly three months, but after two had  elapsed his mother, going into the city to buy oil, found every one  rejoicing, and asked what was going on. \"Do you not know,\" was the  answer, \"that the son of the Grand Vizier is to marry the Sultan's  daughter to-night?\" Breathless, she ran and told Aladdin, who was  overwhelmed at first, but presently bethought him of the lamp. He rubbed  it, and the genie appeared, saying, \"What is thy will?\" Aladdin replied:  \"The Sultan, as thou knowest, has broken his promise to me, and the  Vizier's son is to have the Princess. My command is that to-night you  bring hither the bride and bridegroom.\" \"Master, I obey,\" said the  genie. Aladdin then went to his chamber, where, sure enough, at midnight  the genie transported the bed containing the Vizier's son and the  Princess. \"Take this new-married man,\" he said, \"and put him outside in  the cold, and return at daybreak.\" Whereupon the genie took the Vizier's  son out of bed, leaving Aladdin with the Princess. \"Fear nothing,\"  Aladdin said to her; \"you are my wife, promised to me by your unjust  father, and no harm shall come to you.\" The Princess was too frightened  to speak, and passed the most miserable night of her life, while Aladdin  lay down beside her and slept soundly. At the appointed hour the  genie fetched in the shivering bridegroom, laid him in his place, and  transported the bed back to the palace.    Presently the Sultan came to wish his daughter good-morning. The unhappy  Vizier's son jumped up and hid himself, while the Princess would not say  a word, and was very sorrowful. The Sultan sent her mother to her, who  said: \"How comes it, child, that you will not speak to your father? What  has happened?\" The Princess sighed deeply, and at last told her mother  how, during the night, the bed had been carried into some strange house,  and what had passed there. Her mother did not believe her in the least,  but bade her rise and consider it an idle dream.    The following night exactly the same thing happened, and next morning,  on the Princess's refusal to speak, the Sultan threatened to cut off her  head. She then confessed all, bidding him to ask the Vizier's son if it  were not so. The Sultan told the Vizier to ask his son, who owned the  truth, adding that, dearly as he loved the Princess, he had rather die  than go through another such fearful night, and wished to be separated  from her. His wish was granted, and there was an end to feasting and  rejoicing.    When the three months were over, Aladdin sent his mother to remind the  Sultan of his promise. She stood in the same place as before, and the  Sultan, who had forgotten Aladdin, at once remembered him, and sent for  her.

It will      enable us to show our attachment to the State and Nation, as a      people, whenever the public service requires our aid, thus proving      ourselves obedient to the paramount laws of the land, and ready at      all times to sustain and execute them.    The city ordinance provided that the Legion should be divided into  two cohorts, the horse troops to constitute the first cohort, and  the infantry the second. The commander-in-chief of the Legion was to  be known as the lieutenant-general, who was also made the reviewing  officer and president of the court-martial and Legion. His staff was  to consist of two principal aides-de-camp with the rank of colonel of  cavalry; and a guard of twelve aides-de-camp with the rank of captain  of infantry; and a drill officer, with the rank of colonel of dragoons,  to be the chief officer of the guard.    The second officer was a major-general, to act as the secretary of  the court-martial and Legion. His staff consisted of an adjutant;  surgeon-in-chief, a cornet, quartermaster, paymaster, commissary, and  chaplain; all to hold the rank of colonel of cavalry; besides these,  there were to be in his staff, a surgeon for each cohort, quartermaster  sergeant, sergeant-major, and a chief musician--with the rank of  captain of light infantry; and two musicians with the rank of captain  of infantry. Besides these officers there were created by the ordinance  an adjutant and inspector-general; and a brigadier-general to command  each cohort. The staff of each brigadier-general consisted of an  aide-de-camp with the rank of lieutenant-colonel of infantry, and when  not otherwise in service, these brigadiers had access to the staff of  the major-general.    The ordinance organizing this body of militia provided that the  court-martial should adopt for the Legion, so far as practicable,  the discipline, drill, uniform, rules and regulations of the United  States army. And a law passed by the court-martial shortly after  its organization, required all male citizens within the limits of  Nauvoo, between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, excepting such  as were exempted from service under the laws of the United States, to  perform military duty under the penalty of being fined for absence  from general parades, as follows: generals, twenty-five dollars;  colonels, twenty dollars; captains, fifteen dollars; lieutenants, ten  dollars; and musicians and privates, five dollars. For absence from  company parades--of course without good reason for the absence--the  fines were fixed at these rates: commissioned officers, five dollars;  non-commissioned officers, three dollars; and musicians and privates,  two dollars.    The first election of officers of the Legion took place on the fourth  of February, 1841; and resulted in Joseph Smith being unanimously  chosen lieutenant-general; John C. Bennett, major-general; Wilson  Law, brigadier-general of the first cohort; and Don Carlos Smith,  brigadier-general of the second cohort. The staffs of the respective  generals were chosen from the leading citizens of Nauvoo, some of whom  were not members of the Mormon Church. There were but six companies at  the time the Legion was organized, in February, 1841, but in September  following, the number of men had increased to one thousand four hundred  and ninety; and at the time of the Prophet Joseph's death, some three  years later, the Legion numbered about five thousand.    With such strict regulations, accompanied by a natural enthusiasm for  military display, and drilled by competent military officers, it is  not to be wondered at if the Legion became the best body of militia in  the State of Illinois. It excited the jealousy and envy of the rest of  the militia in the surrounding counties, and all the laudable efforts  of the Legion to become an efficient body of militia, with a view of  assisting in the execution of the State and National laws, if occasion  should require, were construed by their enemies to mean a preparation  for rebellion, and the establishment and spread of the Mormon religion  by conquests of the sword, as, it is alleged, Mohammed established his  religion. Thus the forming of an independent body of militia, enabling  the Saints to perform their military duty by themselves, which the  Prophet fondly hoped would remove \"one of the most fruitful sources of  strife, oppression and collision with the world,\" and which he further  hoped would give the Saints, as a people, an opportunity of showing  their attachment to the State and Nation, whenever the public service  required their aid--by the misrepresentation of their enemies, was  made one of the principal rocks of offense, and was used to excite the  apprehensions and prejudices of the good people of Illinois.    The people of the United States have always been jealous of military  power, and hence have been careful in forming their political  institutions to subordinate the military to the civil authority, except  in times of actual war; and, therefore, notwithstanding the very good  intentions of the Saints at Nauvoo, it was a very easy matter for  their enemies to excite the prejudice and awaken the fears of the  people of Illinois by pointing to the existence of this elaborate and  efficient military organization with its frequent musters and parades,  and captained by a great religious leader, whom, notwithstanding his  virtues and the uprightness of his intentions--they had come to regard  as a wild, religious fanatic, prepared to go to what lengths they knew  not in the promulgation of his religion. Hence that which was to be a  bulwark to the city, and a protection to the Saints, was transformed by  their enemies into an occasion of offense, and an excuse for assailing  them.        CHAPTER XVI.    RECONSTRUCTION OF QUORUMS--THE NAUVOO HOUSE AND THE TEMPLE.    In the meantime important changes in The Church organization were  pending. An important revelation was received on the nineteenth of  January, 1841, [1] which provided for filling the vacancies in the  several quorums and a reconfirmation of all the authorities of the  Church. Hyrum Smith, who had stood in the position of counselor to his  brother Joseph, since the apostasy of F. G. Williams and his expulsion  from The Church, on the seventh of November, 1837--was appointed to  succeed his father as Patriarch to The Church; to hold the sealing  blessings of The Church, even the Holy Spirit of promise, whereby the  Saints are sealed up unto the day of redemption, that they may not  fall, notwithstanding the day of temptation that might come upon them.  He was also appointed a prophet, seer, and revelator, as well as Joseph  with whom he was to act in concert, and from whom he was to receive  counsel. The Prophet was to show unto him the keys whereby he might ask  and receive, \"and be crowned with the same blessing and glory and honor  and priesthood, and gifts of the priesthood that once were put upon him  that was my servant Oliver Cowdery.\"    Joseph Smith was given, as the presiding Elder of The Church, to be  a translator, a revelator, a seer and prophet. Sidney Rigdon was  admonished of his neglect of duty, and of his lack of faith; he was  told, however, if he would repent of his sins, and stand in his place  and calling, he might continue to act as counselor to Joseph, and the  Lord promised to heal him, and make him powerful in testimony. The  reason for this admonition, as one may judge from the spirit of it, was  that he to whom it was given had become sour in his feelings toward the  work of God. His ardor was cooling, and his zeal, which at times had  been inordinate, seemed now to be oozing out of his disposition.    William Law, whom, it will be remembered, Joseph first met when _en  route_ for Washington--Law then leading a small company of Saints to  Nauvoo from Canada--was appointed to fill the vacancy in the First  Presidency made by the appointment of Hyrum Smith to the office of  Patriarch. And such blessings and spiritual powers were pronounced upon  him by the Lord, as seldom falls to the lot of man. On condition of his  faithfulness he was to have power to have the sick, cast out devils, be  delivered from those who administered unto him poison, and the serpent  that might lay hold upon his heel; \"And what if I will,\" said the Lord,  \"that he should raise the dead, let him not hold his voice.\"    Brigham Young was appointed the president of the Twelve Apostles, and  liberty was given to appoint another man to fill the vacancy made in  the quorum through the death of David W. Patten, who was killed by the  mob, at the battle of Crooked River, in Missouri. The High Council for  Nauvoo was named, and a presidency given to the High Priests; the seven  presidents of the Seventies were appointed; and all the quorums of the  Priesthood both in the Melchisedek and Aaronic divisions were set in  order, so far as the appointment of presidents was concerned.    Besides setting the Priesthood in order, the Lord in this revelation  required that a house should be built to His name; \"a house worthy of  all acceptation; that the weary traveler may find health and safety  while he contemplates the word of the Lord;\" and the Prophet Joseph  and his family were to have a right of permanent residence in it. It  was to be known as the \"Nauvoo House,\" and built unto the name of  the Lord. The possession of individual stock was to range from fifty  dollars to fifteen thousand dollars; no person being allowed to put in  less than fifty, nor more than fifteen thousand. And it was specially  provided that none but those who believed in the Book of Mormon and the  revelations of God were to be permitted to hold stock in the house."]]]
