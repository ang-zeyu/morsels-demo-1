When Byamee was seated again in his camp, he asked the women why they  were not grinding doonburr. And the women said: \"Gone are our dayoorls,  and we know not where.\"    \"You lie,\" said Byamee. \"You have lent them to the Dummerh, who came so  often to borrow, though I bade you not lend.\"    \"No, Byamee, we lent them not.\"    \"Go to the camp of the Dummerh, and ask for your dayoorl.\"    The women, with the fear of the fate of the Mahthi did they disobey,  went, though well they knew they had not lent the dayoorl. As they went  they asked at each camp if the tribe there would lend them a dayoorl,  but at each camp they were given the same answer, namely, that the  dayoorls were gone and none knew where. The Dummerh had asked to borrow  them, and in each instance been refused, yet had the stones gone.    As the women went on they heard a strange noise, as of the cry of  spirits, a sound like a smothered \"Oom, oom, oom, oom.\" The cry sounded  high in the air through the tops of trees, then low on the ground  through the grasses, until it seemed as if the spirits were everywhere.  The women clutched tighter their fire sticks, and said: \"Let us go  back. The Wondah are about,\" And swiftly they sped towards their camp,  hearing ever in the air the \"Oom, oom, oom\" of the spirits.    They told Byamee that all the tribes had lost their dayoorls, and that  the spirits were about, and even as they spoke came the sound of \"Oom,  oom, oom, oom,\" at the back of their own camp.    The women crouched together, but Byamee flashed a fire stick whence  came the sound, and as the light flashed on the place he saw no one,  but stranger than all, he saw two dayoorls moving along, and yet could  see no one moving them, and as the dayoorls moved swiftly away, louder  and louder rose the sound of \"Oom, oom, oom, oom,\" until the air seemed  full of invisible spirits. Then Byamee knew that indeed the Wondah were  about, and he too clutched his fire stick and went back into his camp.    In the morning it was seen that not only were all the dayoorls gone,  but the camp of the Dummerh was empty and they too had gone. When no  one would lend the Dummerh dayoorls, they had said, \"Then we can grind  no doonburr unless the Wondah bring us stones.\" And scarcely were the  words said before they saw a dayoorl moving towards them. At first they  thought it was their own skill which enabled them only to express a  wish to have it realised. But as dayoorl after dayoorl glided into  their camp, and, passing through there, moved on, and as they moved was  the sound of \"Oom, oom, oom, oom,\" to be heard everywhere they knew it  was the Wondah at work. And it was borne in upon them that where the  dayoorl went they must go, or they would anger the spirits who had  brought them through their camp.    They gathered up their belongings and followed in the track of the  dayoorls, which had cut a pathway from Googoorewon to Girrahween, down  which in high floods is now a water-course. From Girrahween, on the  dayoorls went to Dirangibirrah, and after them the Dummerh.  Dirangibirrah is between Brewarrina and Widda Murtee, and there the  dayoorls piled themselves up into a mountain, and there for the future  had the blacks to go when they wanted good dayoorls. And the Dummerh  were changed into pigeons, with a cry like the spirits of \"Oom, oom,  oom.\"    Another strange thing happened at this big borah. A tribe, called  Ooboon, were camped at some distance from the other tribes. When any  stranger went to their camp, it was noticed that the chief of the  Ooboon would come out and flash a light on him, which killed him  instantly. And no one knew what this light was, that carried death in  its gleam. At last, Wahn the crow, said \"I will take my biggest booreen  and go and see what this means. You others, do not follow me too  closely, for though I have planned how to save myself from the deadly  gleam, I might not be able to save you.\"    Wahn walked into the camp of the Ooboon, and as their chief turned to  flash the light on him, he put up his booreen and completely shaded  himself from it, and called aloud in a deep voice \"Wah, wah, wah, wah\"  which so startled Ooboon that he dropped his light, and said \"What is  the matter? You startled me. I did not know who you were and might have  hurt you, though I had no wish to, for the Wahn are my friends.\"    \"I cannot stop now,\" said the Wahn, \"I must go back to my camp. I have  forgotten something I wanted to show you. I'll be back soon.\" And so  saying, swiftly ran Wahn back to where he had left his boondee, then  back he came almost before Ooboon realised that he had gone. Back he  came, and stealing up behind Ooboon dealt him a blow with his boondee  that avenged amply the victims of the deadly light, by stretching the  chief of the Ooboon a corpse on the ground at his feet. Then crying  triumphantly, \"Wah, wah, wah,\" back to his camp went Wahn and told what  he had done.    This night, when the Borah corrobboree began, all the women relations  of the boys to be made young men, corrobboreed all night. Towards the  end of the night all the young women were ordered into bough humpies,  which had been previously made all round the edge of the embankment  surrounding the ring. The old women stayed on.    The men who were to have charge of the boys to be made young men, were  told now to be ready to seize hold each of his special charge, to carry  him off down the beaten track to the scrub. When every man had, at a  signal, taken his charge on his shoulder, they all started dancing  round the ring. Then the old women were told to come and say good-bye  to the boys, after which they were ordered to join the young women in  the humpies. About five men watched them into the humpies, then pulled  the boughs down on the top of them that they might see nothing further.    When the women were safely imprisoned beneath the boughs, the men  carrying the boys swiftly disappeared down the track into the scrub.  When they were out of sight the five black fellows came and pulled the  boughs away and released the women, who went now to their camps. But  however curious these women were as to what rites attended the boys'  initiation into manhood, they knew no questions would elicit any  information. In some months' time they might see their boys return  minus, perhaps, a front tooth, and with some extra scarifications on  their bodies, but beyond that, and a knowledge of the fact that they  had not been allowed to look on the face of woman since their  disappearance into the scrub, they were never enlightened.    The next day the tribes made ready to travel to the place of the little  borah, which would be held in about four days' time, at about ten or  twelve miles distance from the scene of the big borah.    At the place of the little borah a ring of grass is made instead of one  of earth. The tribes all travel together there, camp, and have a  corrobboree. The young women are sent to bed early, and the old women  stay until the time when the boys bade farewell to them at the big  borah, at which hour the boys are brought into the little borah and  allowed to say a last good-bye to the old women. Then they are taken  away by the men who have charge of them together. They stay together  for a short time, then probably separate, each man with his one boy  going in a different direction. The man keeps strict charge of the boy  for at least six months, during which time he may not even look at his  own mother. At the end of about six months he may come back to his  tribe, but the effect of his isolation is that he is too wild and  frightened to speak even to his mother, from whom he runs away if she  approaches him, until by degrees the strangeness wears off.    But at this borah of Byamee the tribes were not destined to meet the  boys at the little borah. Just as they were gathering up their goods  for a start, into the camp staggered Millindooloonubbah, the widow,  crying, \"You all left me, widow that I was, with my large family of  children, to travel alone. How could the little feet of my children  keep up to you? Can my back bear more than one goolay? Have I more than  two arms and one back? Then how could I come swiftly with so many  children? Yet none of you stayed to help me. And as you went from each  water hole you drank all the water. When, tired and thirsty, I reached  a water hole and my children cried for a drink, what did I find to give  them? Mud, only mud. Then thirsty and worn, my children crying and  their mother helpless to comfort them; on we came to the next hole.  What did we see, as we strained our eyes to find water? Mud, only mud.  As we reached hole after hole and found only mud, one by one my  children laid down and died; died for want of a drink, which  Millindooloonubbah their mother could not give them.\"    As she spoke, swiftly went a woman to her with a wirree of water. \"Too  late, too late,\" she said. \"Why should a mother live when her children  are dead?\" And she lay back with a groan. But as she felt the water  cool her parched lips and soften her swollen tongue, she made a final  effort, rose to her feet, and waving her hands round the camps of the  tribes, cried aloud: \"You were in such haste to get here. You shall  stay here. Googoolguyyah. Googoolguyyah. Turn into trees. Turn into  trees.\" Then back she fell, dead. And as she fell, the tribes that were  standing round the edge of the ring, preparatory to gathering their  goods and going, and that her hand pointed to as it waved round, turned  into trees. There they now stand. The tribes in the background were  changed each according to the name they were known by, into that bird  or beast of the same name. The barking Mahthi into dogs; the Byahmul  into black swans: the Wahns into crows, and so on. And there at the  place of the big borah, you can see the trees standing tall and gaunt,  sad-look"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38356"],[0,"Speciation of the Wandering Shrew (#15)"],[1," BS. _Crook Co._: 1 SGJ. _Douglas Co._:  Winchester Bay, 1 SGJ; Scottsburg, 3 BS; Drain, 5 BS; Lookingglass,  1 BS; Diamond Lake, 6 BS. _Coos Co._: Empire, 5 BS. _Curry Co._: Port  Orford, 1 BS; Gold Beach, 4 BS. _Klamath Co._: Anna Creek, Mt.

Coll.; obtained on August 9, 1891, by Frank Stephens from  Bishop Creek, 6600 ft., Inyo Co., California, original no. 811.    _Range._--The Sierra Nevada of California, north at least to El Dorado  County, intergrading northerly with _S. v. vagrans_.    _Diagnosis._--Size medium for the species; average and extreme  measurements of 5 topotypes are: total length, 107 (103-112); tail, 47  (45-50); hind foot, 12.8 (12-13.5). Skull relatively broad  interorbitally; color of dorsum in summer pelage nearest (17'''_k_)  Olive Brown.    _Comparisons._--Differs from _S. v. vagrans_, with which it  intergrades to the north, in: longer tail and total length; skull  larger and relatively broader interorbitally; color in summer grayer  (less reddish), the lighter subterminal color bands of the hair often  showing through the darker tips and imparting a grizzled appearance to  the dorsum. Differs from _S. v. parvidens_ to the south in: skull  relatively broader interorbitally and less flattened; teeth slightly  larger.    _Remarks._--_S. v. obscuroides_ has long been called _S. v. obscurus_.  In fact, _obscuroides_ is separated from the range of _obscurus_ by  the intervening, smaller subspecies _S. v. vagrans_. _S. v.  obscuroides_ resembles _S. v. obscurus_ in color and size but the  skull is smaller, although relatively slightly broader. The  resemblance in color is possibly due to the fact that _obscuroides_,  like _obscurus_, is a high mountain form. _S. v. obscuroides_  intergrades with _S. v. vagrans_ along the crest of the Sierra between  Yosemite National Park and Lassen Peak and on the eastern slope of the  Sierra from approximately Mammoth northward. Specimens from Donner are  intergrades but are closest to _S. v. vagrans_. Although all specimens  from Lassen Peak are referable to _S. v. vagrans_, some show cranial  characters of _obscuroides_.    _Specimens examined._--Total number, 76. CALIFORNIA: _Mono Co._: Mt.

Mamm., 2:161, August     19, 1921.    _Type._--Adult male, skin and skull; No. 56561, U. S. Biol. Surv.  Coll.; obtained on October 3, 1893, by J. E. McLellan from Thurmans  Camp, Bluff Lake, 7500 ft., San Bernardino Mts., California.    _Range._--Confined, so far as known, to the San Bernardino and San  Gabriel mountains, San Bernardino Co., California.    _Diagnosis._--Size medium for the species; measurements of two  specimens from the San Bernardino Mountains are: total length, 105,  106; tail, 41, 48; hind foot, 12, 14. Upper parts in summer  Olive-Brown to Buffy-Brown; cranium flattened and relatively narrow;  unicuspids and incisors relatively small.    _Comparisons._--For comparison with _S. v. obscuroides_, the only  adjacent subspecies, see the account of that subspecies.    _Remarks._--_S. v. parvidens_ is seemingly an uncommon mammal. I have  been informed by Terry Vaughan that repeated attempts by him to obtain  it in suitable habitat in the San Gabriel Mountains failed. This shrew  is probably no longer in reproductive continuity with _Sorex vagrans_  of the Sierra Nevada.    _Specimens examined._--Total number, 4.

Zool.;  obtained on May 6, 1908, by Joseph Dixon from salt marsh near Palo  Alto, Santa Clara Co., California.    _Range._--Marshes in the southern part of San Francisco Bay,  California.    _Diagnosis._--Size small for the species; measurements of two  topotypes are: total length, 105, 106; tail, 39, 40; hind foot, 12,  13. Upper parts in winter Chaetura Black or near Fuscous-Black;  underparts brownish; upper parts in summer near (17'_m_) Mummy Brown;  underparts with a decided buffy wash, near (15'_d_) Light Ochraceous  Buff; rostrum relatively large; maxillary tooth-row relatively long;  teeth relatively large.    _Comparisons._--Darker ventrally, both summer and winter, than _S. v.  vagrans_; slightly more reddish dorsally in summer pelage than _S. v.  vagrans_, rostrum and teeth relatively larger; smaller externally than  _S. v. paludivagus_, paler; skull longer, narrower cranially and  broader rostrally.    _Remarks._--This subspecies seems to be restricted to salt marshes  where it occurs with _Sorex ornatus_.    _Specimens examined._--Total number, 12.
