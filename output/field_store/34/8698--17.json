[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4511"],[0,"The Life of the Bee (#15)"],[1," I am  compelled to admit that there came but a single one. Was this mere  chance, or had she followed instructions received? The experiment  was insufficient, but circumstances prevented me from carrying it  further. I released the \"baited\" bees, and my study soon was  besieged by the buzzing crowd to whom they had taught the way to the  treasure.    We need not concern ourselves with this incomplete attempt of mine,  for many other curious traits compel us to recognise the existence  among the bees of spiritual communications that go beyond a mere  \"yes\" or \"no,\" and that are manifest in cases where mere example or  gesture would not be sufficient. Of such, for instance, are the  remarkable harmony of their work in the hive, the extraordinary  division of labour, the regularity with which one worker will take  the place of another, etc. I have often marked bees that went  foraging in the morning, and found that, in the afternoon, unless  flowers were specially abundant, they would be engaged in heating  and fanning the brood-cells, or perhaps would form part of the  mysterious, motionless curtain in whose midst the wax-makers and  sculptors would be at work. Similarly I have noticed that workers  whom I have seen gathering pollen for the whole of one day, will  bring no pollen back on the morrow, but will concern themselves  exclusively with the search for nectar, and vice-versa.    {48}    And further, we might mention what M. Georges de Layens, the  celebrated French apiarist, terms the \"Distribution of Bees over  Melliferous Plants.\" Day after day, at the first hour of sunrise,  the explorers of the dawn return, and the hive awakes to receive the  good news of the earth. \"The lime trees are blossoming to-day on the  banks of the canal.\" \"The grass by the roadside is gay with white  clover.\" \"The sage and the lotus are about to open.\" \"The  mignonette, the lilies are overflowing with pollen.\" Whereupon the  bees must organise quickly, and arrange to divide the work. Five  thousand of the sturdiest will sully forth to the lime trees, while  three thousand juniors go and refresh the white clover. Those who  yesterday were absorbing nectar from the corollas will to-day repose  their tongue and the glands of their sac, and gather red pollen from  the mignonette, or yellow pollen from the tall lilies; for never  shall you see a bee collecting or mixing pollen of a different  colour or species; and indeed one of the chief pre-occupations of  the hive is the methodical bestowal of these pollens in the  store-rooms, in strict accordance with their origin and colour. Thus  does the hidden genius issue its commands. The workers immediately  sally forth, in long black files, whereof each one will fly straight  to its allotted task. \"The bees,\" says De Layens, \"would seem to be  perfectly informed as to the locality, the relative melliferous  value, and the distance of every melliferous plant within a certain  radius from the hive.    \"If we carefully note the different directions in which these  foragers fly, and observe in detail the harvest they gather from the  various plants around, we shall find that the workers distribute  themselves over the flowers in proportion not only to the numbers of  flowers of one species, but also to their melliferous value. Nay,  more--they make daily calculations as to the means of obtaining the  greatest possible wealth of saccharine liquid. In the spring, for  instance, after the willows have bloomed, when the fields still are  bare, and the first flowers of the woods are the one resource of the  bees, we shall see them eagerly visiting gorse and violets,  lungworts and anemones. But, a few days later, when fields of  cabbage and colza begin to flower in sufficient abundance, we shall  find that the bees will almost entirely forsake the plants in the  woods, though these be still in full blossom, and will confine their  visits to the flowers of cabbage and colza alone. In this fashion  they regulate, day by day, their distribution over the plants, so as  to collect the greatest value of saccharine liquid in the least  possible time.    \"It may fairly be claimed, therefore, for the colony of bees that,  in its harvesting labours no less than in its internal economy, it  is able to establish a rational distribution of the number of  workers without ever disturbing the principle of the division of  labour.\"    {49}    But what have we to do, some will ask, with the intelligence of the  bees? What concern is it of ours whether this be a little less or a  little more? Why weigh, with such infinite care, a minute fragment  of almost invisible matter, as though it were a fluid whereon  depended the destiny of man? I hold, and exaggerate nothing, that  our interest herein is of the most considerable. The discovery of a  sign of true intellect outside ourselves procures us something of  the emotion Robinson Crusoe felt when he saw the imprint of a human  foot on the sandy beach of his island. We seem less solitary than we  had believed. And indeed, in our endeavour to understand the  intellect of the bees, we are studying in them that which is most  precious in our own substance: an atom of the extraordinary matter  which possesses, wherever it attach itself, the magnificent power of  transfiguring blind necessity, of organising, embellishing, and  multiplying life; and, most striking of all, of holding in suspense  the obstinate force of death, and the mighty, irresponsible wave  that wraps almost all that exists in an eternal unconsciousness.    Were we sole possessors of the particle of matter that, when  maintained in a special condition of flower or incandescence, we  term the intellect, we should to some extent be entitled to look on  ourselves as privileged beings, and to imagine that in us nature  achieved some kind of aim; but here we discover, in the hymenoptera,  an entire category of beings in whom a more or less identical aim is  achieved. And this fact, though it decide nothing perhaps, still  holds an honourable place in the mass of tiny facts that help to  throw light on our position in this world. It affords even, if  considered from a certain point of view, a fresh proof of the most  enigmatic part of our being; for the superpositions of destinies  that we find in the hive are surveyed by us from an eminence loftier  than any we can attain for the contemplation of the destinies of  man. There we see before us, in miniature, the large and simple  lines that in our own disproportionate sphere we never have the  occasion to disentangle and follow to the end. Spirit and matter are  there, the race and the individual, evolution and permanence, life  and death, the past and the future; all gathered together in a  retreat that our hand can lift and one look of our eye embrace. And  may we not reasonably ask ourselves whether the mere size of a body,  and the room that it fills in time and space, can modify to the  extent we imagine the secret idea of nature; the idea that we try to  discover in the little history of the hive, which in a few days  already is ancient, no less than in the great history of man, of  whom three generations overlap a long century?    {50}    Let us go on, then, with the story of our hive; let us take it up  where we left it; and raise, as high as we may, a fold of the  festooned curtain in whose midst a strange sweat, white as snow and  airier than the down of a wing, is beginning to break over the  swarm. For the wax that is now being born is not like the wax that  we know; it is immaculate, it has no weight; seeming truly to be the  soul of the honey, that itself is the spirit of flowers. And this  motionless incantation has called it forth that it may serve us,  later--in memory of its origin, doubtless, wherein it is one with  the azure sky, and heavy with perfumes of magnificence and  purity--as the fragrant light of the last of our altars.    {51}    To follow the various phases of the secretion and employment of wax  by a swarm that is beginning to build, is a matter of very great  difficulty. All comes to pass in the blackest depths of the crowd,  whose agglomeration, growing denser and denser, produces the  temperature needful for this exudation, which is the privilege of  the youngest bees. Huber, who was the first to study these  phenomena, bringing incredible patience to bear and exposing himself  at times to very serious danger, devotes to them more than two  hundred and fifty pages; which, though of considerable interest, are  necessarily somewhat confused. But I am not treating this subject  technically; and while referring when necessary to Huber's admirable  studies, I shall confine myself generally to relating what is patent  to any one who may gather a swarm into a glass hive.    We have to admit, first of all, that we know not yet by what process  of alchemy the honey transforms itself into wax in the enigmatic  bodies of our suspended bees. We can only say that they will remain  thus suspended for a period extending from eighteen to twenty-four  hours, in a temperature so high that one might almost believe that a  fire was burning in the hollow of the hive; and then white and  transparent scales will appear at the opening of four little pockets  that every bee has underneath its abdomen.    When the bodies of most of those who form the inverted cone have  thus been adorned with ivory tablets, we shall see one of the bees,  as though suddenly inspired, abruptly detach herself from the mass,  and climb over the backs of the passive crowd till she reach the  inner pinnacle of the cupola. To this she will fix herself solidly,  dislodging, with repeated blows of her head, such of her neighbours  as may seem to hamper her movements. Then, with her mouth and claws,  she will seize one of the eight scales that hang from her abdomen,  and at once proceed to clip it and plane it, extend it, knead it  with her saliva, bend it and flatten it,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45149"],[0,"The House of the Lord: A Study of Holy Sanctuaries Ancient and Modern (#15)"],[1,"such as had been definitely specified and minutely  prescribed; and the sacrificial rites could be solemnized only by  authorized priests. The supreme sacrifice involved {80} in the atoning  death of Christ was as truly appointed and fore-ordained. Prophets,  through the long centuries antedating the Christian era, predicted the  birth, life, and death of our Lord as already provided for;[37] and  these prophecies were confirmed by Jesus Himself.[38] Consider also  the testimony of the apostles to the same effect. Peter specifically  designates Christ as \"a Lamb without blemish and without spot: who  verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world.\"[39] The  designation \"Lamb\" is indicative of a sacrificial victim. Paul in  writing to the Romans characterizes our Lord as the one \"Whom God hath  set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare  his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past.\"[40]    The Latter-day Saints affirm that their vicarious work in behalf of  the dead is required of them by the call of the Lord through direct  revelation; and that it becomes the duty and privilege of every  individual who accepts the Gospel and enters the Church to labor  for the salvation of his dead. He is expected and required by the  obligations and responsibility he has assumed as a member of the Church  of Jesus Christ, so to live as to be a worthy representative of his  departed ancestors, in holy ordinance, and to be of clean life, that he  may not forfeit his right to enter the sacred confines of the Lord's  House, where alone he may officiate in that privileged capacity.    Let it not be assumed that this doctrine of vicarious {81} labor for  the dead implies even remotely, that the administration of ordinances  in behalf of departed spirits operates in any manner to interfere with  the right of choice and the exercise of free agency on their part.  They are at liberty to accept or reject the ministrations in their  behalf; and so they will accept or reject, in accordance with their  converted or unregenerate state, even as is the case with mortals to  whom the Gospel message may come. Though baptism be duly administered  to a living man in behalf of a dead ancestor, that spirit will derive  no immediate advancement nor any benefit therefrom if he has not yet  attained faith in the Lord Jesus Christ or if he be still unrepentant.  Even as Christ offered salvation to all, though few there be who accept  in the flesh, so temple ordinances may be administered for many in the  realm of the departed who are not yet prepared to profit thereby.    It is evident, therefore, that labor in behalf of the dead is two-fold;  that performed on earth would remain incomplete and futile but for  its supplement and counterpart beyond the veil. Missionary work  is in progress there--work, compared with which the evangelistic  labor of earth is but a small undertaking. There are preachers and  teachers, ministers invested with the Holy Priesthood, all engaged  in declaring the glad tidings of the Gospel to spirits who have not  yet found the light. As has been shown, this great labor amongst the  dead was inaugurated by Jesus the Christ, during the brief period of  His disembodiment.[41] The saving ministry so begun was left to be  continued by others duly authorized and commissioned; even as the work  of preaching the Gospel {82} and administering therein amongst the  living was committed to the apostles in the Church of old.    AUTHORITY TO LABOR IN BEHALF OF THE DEAD    In the closing chapter of the compilation of scriptures known to us  as the Old Testament, the prophet Malachi thus describes a condition  incident to the last days, immediately preceding the second coming of  Christ:        \"For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all      the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the      day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that      it shall leave them neither root nor branch.        \"But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness      arise with healing in his wings.\"    The fateful prophecy concludes with the following blessed and  far-reaching promise:        \"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of      the great and dreadful day of the Lord:        \"And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and      the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite      the earth with a curse.\"[42]    It has been held by theologians and Bible commentators that this  prediction had reference to the birth and ministry of John the  Baptist,[43] upon whom rested the spirit and power of Elias.[44]  However, we have no record of Elijah having ministered unto the  Baptist, and furthermore, {83} the latter's ministry, glorious though  it was, justifies no conclusion that in him did the prophecy find its  full realization. In addition, it should be remembered, that the Lord's  declaration through Malachi, relative to the day of burning in which  the wicked would be destroyed as stubble, yet awaits fulfilment. It is  evident, therefore, that the commonly accepted interpretation is at  fault, and that we must look to a later date than the time of John for  the fulfilment of Malachi's prediction. The later occasion has come;  it belongs to the present dispensation, and marks the inauguration of  a work specially reserved for the Church in these latter days. In the  course of a glorious manifestation to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery,  in the Temple at Kirtland, Ohio, April 3rd, 1836, there appeared unto  them Elijah, the prophet of old, who had been taken from earth while  still in the body. He declared unto them:        \"Behold, the time has fully come, which was spoken of by the mouth      of Malachi, testifying that he (Elijah) should be sent before the      great and dreadful day of the Lord come, to turn the hearts of the      fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers, lest the      whole earth be smitten with a curse. Therefore the keys of this      dispensation are committed into your hands, and by this ye may know      that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is near, even at the      doors.\"[45]    One of the fundamental principles underlying the doctrine of salvation  for the dead, is that of the mutual dependance of the fathers and  the children. Family lineage and the sequence of generations in each  particular line of descent are facts, and cannot be changed {84} by  death; on the other hand it is evident from the olden scriptures  already cited, and attested by the equally sure word of modern  revelation, that the family relationships of earth are recognized  in the spirit world. Neither the children nor the fathers, neither  progenitors nor descendants, can alone attain perfection; and the  requisite co-operation is effected through baptism and related  ordinances, administered to the living in behalf of the dead.    In this way and through this work are the hearts of the fathers and  those of the children turned toward each other. As the living children  learn that without their ancestors they cannot attain a perfect status  in the eternal world, their own faith will be strengthened and they  will be willing to labor for the redemption and salvation of their  dead. And the dead, learning through the preaching of the Gospel  in their world, that they are dependent upon their descendants as  vicarious saviors, will turn with loving faith and prayerful effort  toward their children yet living.    This uniting of the interests of fathers and children is a part of the  necessary preparation for the yet future advent of the Christ as ruling  King and Lord of earth. Joseph Smith thus taught:        \"The earth will be smitten with a curse, unless there is a welding      link of some kind or other, between the fathers and the children,      upon some subject or other, and behold what is that subject? It      is the baptism for the dead. For we without them cannot be made      perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect.\"[46]    {85} The Church today cites as authority for its administration  of ordinances in behalf of the dead, the special bestowal of this  power and office through the ministry of Elijah; and furthermore,  the Church holds that the giving of that power marked the fulfilment  of Malachi's portentous prediction. There appears an element of  particular fitness in the fact that the minister through whom this  great work has been inaugurated in the present dispensation, is none  other than Elijah,--who, not having passed the portals of death, held  a peculiar and special relation to both the dead and the living. As  to the fidelity with which the Church has served under this special  commission, the temples it has reared with such sacrifice and  self-denial on the part of its devoted adherents, and the ordinance  work already performed therein, are sufficient proof.    The importance with which the Latter-day Saints regard their temple  work in behalf of the dead naturally produces among this people a vital  interest in the genealogical records of their respective families.  Ordinance work in the temples, in behalf of any departed person, can be  done only as that person may be described on the record, as to name,  relationship, time and place of birth and death, etc., by which data  he may be fully and certainly isolated and identified.[47] It is a  matter of common knowledge that interest in genealogical research has  greatly increased in the United States and in Europe during the last  seven or eight decades. Genealogical societies have been formed, and  individual investigators have devoted great treasures of time and money  to the compilation of records showing {86} numerous lines of family  descent and the many ramifications of complicated relationship.
