By this method of investigation, we soon see that every argument which  has been invented in behalf of property, WHATEVER IT MAY BE, always and  of necessity leads to equality; that is, to the negation of property.    The first part covers two chapters: one treating of occupation, the  foundation of our right; the other, of labor and talent, considered as  causes of property and social inequality.    The first of these chapters will prove that the right of occupation  OBSTRUCTS property; the second that the right of labor DESTROYS it.    II. Property, then, being of necessity conceived as existing only in  connection with equality, it remains to find out why, in spite of this  necessity of logic, equality does not exist. This new investigation also  covers two chapters: in the first, considering the fact of property in  itself, we inquire whether this fact is real, whether it exists, whether  it is possible; for it would imply a contradiction, were these two  opposite forms of society, equality and inequality, both possible. Then  we discover, singularly enough, that property may indeed manifest  itself accidentally; but that, as an institution and principle, it is  mathematically impossible. So that the axiom of the school--ab actu ad  posse valet consecutio: from the actual to the possible the inference is  good--is given the lie as far as property is concerned.    Finally, in the last chapter, calling psychology to our aid, and  probing man's nature to the bottom, we shall disclose the principle of  JUSTICE--its formula and character; we shall state with precision the  organic law of society; we shall explain the origin of property, the  causes of its establishment, its long life, and its approaching death;  we shall definitively establish its identity with robbery. And, after  having shown that these three prejudices--THE SOVEREIGNTY OF MAN, THE  INEQUALITY OF CONDITIONS, AND PROPERTY--are one and the same; that they  may be taken for each other, and are reciprocally convertible,--we  shall have no trouble in inferring therefrom, by the principle  of contradiction, the basis of government and right. There our  investigations will end, reserving the right to continue them in future  works.    The importance of the subject which engages our attention is recognized  by all minds.      \"Property,\" says M. Hennequin, \"is the creative and conservative  principle of civil society. Property is one of those basic institutions,  new theories concerning which cannot be presented too soon; for it must  not be forgotten, and the publicist and statesman must know, that on the  answer to the question whether property is the principle or the result  of social order, whether it is to be considered as a cause or an effect,  depends all morality, and, consequently, all the authority of human  institutions.\"      These words are a challenge to all men of hope and faith; but, although  the cause of equality is a noble one, no one has yet picked up the  gauntlet thrown down by the advocates of property; no one has been  courageous enough to enter upon the struggle. The spurious learning of  haughty jurisprudence, and the absurd aphorisms of a political economy  controlled by property have puzzled the most generous minds; it is a  sort of password among the most influential friends of liberty and  the interests of the people that EQUALITY IS A CHIMERA! So many false  theories and meaningless analogies influence minds otherwise keen,  but which are unconsciously controlled by popular prejudice. Equality  advances every day--fit aequalitas. Soldiers of liberty, shall we desert  our flag in the hour of triumph?    A defender of equality, I shall speak without bitterness and without  anger; with the independence becoming a philosopher, with the courage  and firmness of a free man. May I, in this momentous struggle, carry  into all hearts the light with which I am filled; and show, by the  success of my argument, that equality failed to conquer by the sword  only that it might conquer by the pen!          CHAPTER II. PROPERTY CONSIDERED AS A NATURAL RIGHT         PROPERTY CONSIDERED AS A NATURAL RIGHT.--OCCUPATION AND       CIVIL LAW AS EFFICIENT BASES OF PROPERTY. DEFINITIONS.    The Roman law defined property as the right to use and abuse one's own  within the limits of the law--jus utendi et abutendi re sua, quatenus  juris ratio patitur. A justification of the word ABUSE has been  attempted, on the ground that it signifies, not senseless and immoral  abuse, but only absolute domain. Vain distinction! invented as an excuse  for property, and powerless against the frenzy of possession, which it  neither prevents nor represses. The proprietor may, if he chooses, allow  his crops to rot under foot; sow his field with salt; milk his cows  on the sand; change his vineyard into a desert, and use his  vegetable-garden as a park: do these things constitute abuse, or not? In  the matter of property, use and abuse are necessarily indistinguishable.    According to the Declaration of Rights, published as a preface to the  Constitution of '93, property is \"the right to enjoy and dispose at  will of one's goods, one's income, and the fruit of one's labor and  industry.\"    Code Napoleon, article 544: \"Property is the right to enjoy and dispose  of things in the most absolute manner, provided we do not overstep the  limits prescribed by the laws and regulations.\"    These two definitions do not differ from that of the Roman law: all  give the proprietor an absolute right over a thing; and as for the  restriction imposed by the code,--PROVIDED WE DO NOT OVERSTEP THE LIMITS  PRESCRIBED BY THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS,--its object is not to limit  property, but to prevent the domain of one proprietor from interfering  with that of another. That is a confirmation of the principle, not a  limitation of it.    There are different kinds of property: 1. Property pure and simple, the  dominant and seigniorial power over a thing; or, as they term it, NAKED  PROPERTY. 2. POSSESSION. \"Possession,\" says Duranton, \"is a matter of  fact, not of right.\" Toullier: \"Property is a right, a legal power;  possession is a fact.\" The tenant, the farmer, the commandite, the  usufructuary, are possessors; the owner who lets and lends for use, the  heir who is to come into possession on the death of a usufructuary, are  proprietors. If I may venture the comparison: a lover is a possessor, a  husband is a proprietor.    This double definition of property--domain and possession--is of the  highest importance; and it must be clearly understood, in order to  comprehend what is to follow.    From the distinction between possession and property arise two sorts of  rights: the jus in re, the right in a thing, the right by which I may  reclaim the property which I have acquired, in whatever hands I find  it; and the jus ad rem, the right TO a thing, which gives me a claim to  become a proprietor. Thus the right of the partners to a marriage over  each other's person is the jus in re; that of two who are betrothed is  only the jus ad rem. In the first, possession and property are united;  the second includes only naked property. With me who, as a laborer,  have a right to the possession of the products of Nature and my own  industry,--and who, as a proletaire, enjoy none of them,--it is by  virtue of the jus ad rem that I demand admittance to the jus in re.    This distinction between the jus in re and the jus ad rem is the basis  of the famous distinction between possessoire and petitoire,--actual  categories of jurisprudence, the whole of which is included within their  vast boundaries. Petitoire refers to every thing relating to property;  possessoire to that relating to possession. In writing this memoir  against property, I bring against universal society an action petitoire:  I prove that those who do not possess to-day are proprietors by the same  title as those who do possess; but, instead of inferring therefrom  that property should be shared by all, I demand, in the name of general  security, its entire abolition. If I fail to win my case, there is  nothing left for us (the proletarian class and myself) but to cut our  throats: we can ask nothing more from the justice of nations; for, as  the code of procedure (art 26) tells us in its energetic style, THE  PLAINTIFF WHO HAS BEEN NON-SUITED IN AN ACTION PETITOIRE, IS DEBARRED  THEREBY FROM BRINGING AN ACTION POSSESSOIRE. If, on the contrary, I gain  the case, we must then commence an action possessoire, that we may be  reinstated in the enjoyment of the wealth of which we are deprived by  property. I hope that we shall not be forced to that extremity; but  these two actions cannot be prosecuted at once, such a course being  prohibited by the same code of procedure.    Before going to the heart of the question, it will not be useless to  offer a few preliminary remarks.    % 1.--Property as a Natural Right.    The Declaration of Rights has placed property in its list of the natural  and inalienable rights of man, four in all: LIBERTY, EQUALITY, PROPERTY,  SECURITY. What rule did the legislators of '93 follow in compiling  this list? None. They laid down principles, just as they discussed  sovereignty and the laws; from a general point of view, and according to  their own opinion. They did every thing in their own blind way.    If we can believe Toullier: \"The absolute rights can be reduced to  three: SECURITY, LIBERTY, PROPERTY.\" Equality is eliminated by the  Rennes professor; why? Is it because LIBERTY implies it, or because  property prohibits it? On this point the author of \"Droit Civil  Explique\" is silent: it has not even occurred to him that the matter is  under discussion.    Nevertheless, if we compare these three or four rights with each other,  we find that property bears no resemblance whatever to the others;  that for the majority of citizens it exists only"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36020"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#15)"],[1,"nearly  blind and helpless centenarian, is well past eighty herself, yet she  keeps her charge neat and clean and the cabin in which they live tidy.

Us lived  in log cabins wid dirt floors and dey was built in two long rows. Us  beds was nailed to de wall at one end and us used corn shucks and pine  straw for mattresses.    \"Miss Mary was good to us, but us had to work hard and late. I worked in  de fields every day from 'fore daylight to almost plumb dark. I usta  take my littlest baby wid me. I had two chilluns, and I'd tie hit up to  a tree limb to keep off de ants and bugs whilst I hoed and worked de  furrow. All us niggers was fed from de big kitchen and wasn't hongry,  but sometimes us would steal more food dan was give us anyhow.

Us cooked on a great, big fireplace what had arms hanging  out over de coals to hang pots on to bile. Den us had three-legged  skillets what set right over de coals for frying and sech like. Us  cooked sho' 'nuff bread in dem days, ash cakes, de best thing you ever  et. Dey ain't nothing like dat dese days.    \"I was sold oncet before I left Virginia. Den I was brung down to  Alabama and sold from de block for $1,000 to Mr. Sam Rainey, at Camp  Hill, Ala. I still worked in de fields, but I would cook for de white  folks and hope around de Big House on special 'casions. Our overseer was  Mr. Green Ross, and he was a bad one, too. Mean, my goodness! He'd whup  you in a minute. He'd put you in de buck, tie your feet and den set out  to whup you right.    \"He would get us slaves up 'fore day, blowing on his big horn, and us  would work 'twell plumb dark. All de little niggers'd get up, too, and  go up to de Big House to be fed from wooden bowls. Den dey'd be called  ag'in 'fore us come from de fields and put to bed by dark.

Dey was named Lou and Eli, and dey was took care of  like de rest. Us useta have some good times. Us could have all de fun us  wanted on Sa'dday nights, and us sho' had it, cutting monkeyshines and  dancing all night long sometimes. Some would pat and sing, 'Keys not  arunning, Keys not arunning,\" and us sho' did more'n dance, I'm telling  you. Sometimes our Mistess would come down early to watch us dance.    \"Next to our dances, de most fun was corn-shucking. Marsa would have de  corn hauled up to de cribs and piled as a house.

I is now ninety-five years old an' what I remembers mos' is de way  de chillun roll aroun' in de big nurses room.\" Mandy lives at 1508-Pine  Street, Anniston, Alabama. She was cutting collards for dinner and left  her dishpan and butcher knife to receive her caller.    \"Mist' McCullough, he raised niggahs to sell--an' the little black  chillen play aroun' until 'bout sundown, dey is give dey supper. A long  trough out in a cool place in the bak yard is filled wif good, cold  buttermilk an' cornbread crumbed in, an' dey each is give a spoon, an'  dey eats dey fill. Den dey is ready fo' bed.

Wasn't much whippin' went on 'roun' our plantation, but on  some places close to us, they whipped until blood run down. Some places  they even mixed salt an' pepper in water an' bathed 'em with it. The  salt water'd heal, but when the pepper got in there, it burned lak fire,  an' they'd as well get on to work quick, cause they can't be still  nohow.    \"One woman, on a plantation not so far from us, was expectin', an' they  tied her up under a hack-a-berry tree, an' whipped her until she died.

The older part of the house is the \"settin'  room\" where the stick-and-clay chimney of its earlier days has been  replaced by a new brick chimney. A roof of corrugated sheet metal tops  the warped, roughly hewn logs which form the walls. The \"new room\" is  built in the later shanty style--pine boards, unplaned, and nailed  upright to a frame of 2X4's, the cracks of the flat joints \"stripped\"  with narrow siding. A roof of \"bought\" shingles covers this room.  Connecting the two rooms is an open hall roofed with heavy boards  \"rived\" from pine blocks. Despite its conglomerate architecture this is  a better \"colored folks'\" house than many in the Black Belt. These  \"double houses\" often have no roof for the hall and some also lack a  floor, the hall being made entirely of earth, sky and imagination.    Emma settled herself on the top step at the front of the hall to talk to  me, after first ironing a tiny wrinkle out of her \"string apron\" with  her hand.    [Illustration: _Emma Crockett, Livingston, Alabama_]    \"Miss, I'm 'bout sebenty-nine or eighty year old,\" she told me, \"and I  belonged to Marse Bill Hawkins and Miss Betty.
