But in subsequently  measuring a gas over mercury in the same tube, when the mercury stands  at the same division _l_, the volume of the gas will be as represented  by _B_ of 2, which is evidently somewhat greater than _A_. This will be  seen still more clearly in 3, where _a_ represents the boundary of the  mercury, and _b_ the boundary of the air, when the tube is filled to the  mark _l_ with mercury or a gas over mercury respectively.    [Illustration: FIG. 41.]    It is plain that when the level of the mercury in measuring a gas is  read at _l_, the volume of the gas is greater than the volume of the  mercury recorded, by twice the difference between the volume _A_ of  mercury measured, and that which would fill the tube to the level _l_,  if its surface were plane.    The usual mode of finding the true volume of a gas collected over  mercury is as follows:--    Place the graduated tube mouth upwards, introduce some mercury, and,  after removing all bubbles, note the division at which it stands. Then  add a few drops of solution of mercuric chloride; the surface of the  mercury will become level, read and record its new position. Then, in  any measurement, having observed that the mercury stands at _n_  divisions of the tube, add twice the difference between the two  positions of the mercury to _n_, and ascertain the volume which  corresponds to this reading from the table of capacities.      =To Calibrate the Tube of a Thermometer.=--Detach a thread of mercury  from half an inch to one inch in length from the body of the mercury.  Move it from point to point throughout the length of the tube, and note  its length in each position. If in one part it occupies a length of tube  corresponding to eight degrees, and at another only seven degrees, then  at the former point the value of each division is only seven-eighths of  those at the latter position.    From the results obtained, a table of corrections for the thermometer  should be prepared.    It is sometimes necessary to join soda glass to lead glass. In this case  the edge of the lead glass tube may be bordered with white enamel before  making the joint. Enough enamel must be used to prevent the lead and  soda glasses from mingling at any point. The enamel is easily reduced,  and must be heated in the oxidising flame. Dr. Ebert recommends _Verre  d'urane_ for this purpose. It is supplied by Herr Goetze of Leipzig  (Liebigstrasse).          CHAPTER VI.    _GLASS TUBING._      The diagrams given below show the sizes and thickness of the glass tubes  most frequently required. In ordering, the numbers of these diagrams may  be quoted, or the exact dimensions desired may be stated.    Glass tubes are usually sold by weight, and therefore the weight of tube  of each size that is wished for should be indicated, and also whether it  is to be of lead or soda glass.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          CHAPTER VII.    _VITREOUS SILICA._      =Introductory.=--Vitreous Silica was made in fine threads by M. Gaudin  in 1839,[22] and small tubes of it were made in 1869 by M. A. Gautier,  but its remarkable qualities were not really recognised till 1889, when  Professor C. V. Boys rediscovered the process of making small pieces of  apparatus of this substance, and used the torsion of \"quartz fibres\" for  measuring small forces. More recently the author of this book has  devised a process for preventing the \"splintering\" of quartz which gave  so much trouble to the earlier workers, and jointly with Mr. H. G.  Lacell, has produced a variety of apparatus of much larger dimensions  than had been attempted =previously=. At the time of writing we can  produce by the processes described in the following pages tubes 1 to 1.5  cm. in diameter and about 750 cm. in length, globes or flasks capable of  containing about 50 cc., masses of vitreous silica weighing 100 grams or  more, and a variety of other apparatus.    [22] A brief summary of the history of this subject will be found in  _Nature_, Vol. 62, and in the Proceedings of the Royal Institution,  1901.      =Properties of Vitreous Silica.=--For the convenience of those who are  not familiar with the literature of this subject, I may commence this  chapter with a brief account of the properties and applications of  vitreous silica, as far as they are at present ascertained. Vitreous  silica is less hard than chalcedony, but harder than felspar. Tubes and  rods of it can be cut with a file or with a piece of sharpened and  hardened steel, and can afterwards be broken like similar articles of  glass. Its conducting power is low, and Mr. Boys has shown that fine  fibres of silica insulate remarkably well, even in an atmosphere  saturated with moisture. The insulating qualities of tubes or rods of  large cross sections have not yet been fully tested; one would expect  them to give good results provided that they are kept scrupulously  clean. A silica rod which had been much handled would probably insulate  no better than one of glass in a similar condition. The density of  vitreous silica is very near to that of ordinary amorphous silica. In  the case of a small rod not absolutely free from minute bubbles it was  found to be 2.21.    Vitreous silica is optically inactive, when homogeneous, and is highly  transparent to ultraviolet radiations.    The melting point of vitreous silica cannot be definitely stated. It is  plastic over a considerable range of temperature. Professor Callendar  has succeeded in measuring the rate of contraction of fine rods in  cooling from 1200 deg. to 1500 deg. C., so that its plasticity must be very  slight below the latter temperature. If a platinum wire embedded in a  thick silica tube be heated from without by an oxy-hydrogen flame the  metal may be melted at temperatures at which the silica tube will retain  its form for a moderate length of time, but silica softens to a marked  extent at temperatures a little above the melting point of platinum.    It has been observed by Boys, Callendar, and others that fine rods of  silica, and also the so-called \"quartz fibres,\" are apt to become  brittle after they have been heated to redness. But I have not observed  this defect in the case of more massive objects, such as thick rods or  tubes; and as I have repeatedly observed that mere traces of basic  matter, such as may be conveyed by contact with the hand, seriously  injure the surface of silica, and have found that silica quickly becomes  rotten when it is heated to about 1000 deg. in contact with an infusible  base such as lime, I am disposed to ascribe the above-mentioned  phenomenon to chemical rather than to purely physical causes.[23] It is  certain, however, that silica apparatus must never be too strongly  heated in contact with basic substances. Silica is easily attacked by  alkalis and by lime, less readily by copper oxide, and still less by  iron oxide.    [23] In a recent communication Professor Callendar tells me that the  devitrification commences at the outside and is hastened by particles of  foreign matter.    The rate of expansion of vitreous silica has been studied by H. le  Chatelier, and more recently by Callendar. The former found its mean  coefficient of expansion to be 0.0000007 between 0 deg. and 10000 deg.,[24] and  that it contracted when heated above 700 deg..    [24] The silica blocks used were prepared by fusion in an electric  furnace; it is therefore probable that they were not quite pure.    Professor Callendar used rods of silica prepared by the author from  \"Brazil crystal\"; these were drawn in the oxy-gas flame and had never  been heated in contact with solid foreign matter, so that they  consisted, presumably, of very pure silica. His results differ in some  respects from those obtained by Le Chatelier, for he finds the mean  coefficient of expansion to be only 0.00000059, _i.e._ about one  seventeenth as great as that of platinum. Callendar found the rods of  silica expanded very regularly up to 1000 deg. but less regularly above that  temperature. Above 1200 deg. they contracted when heated.    The behaviour of vitreous silica under sudden changes of temperature is  most remarkable. Large masses of it may be plunged suddenly when cold  into the oxy-gas flame, and tubes or rods at a white heat may be thrust  into cold water, or even into liquid air, with impunity. As a  consequence of this, it is in one respect much more easily worked in the  flame than any form of glass. Difficult joints can be thrust suddenly  into the flame, or removed from it, at any stage, and they may be heated  unequally in different parts with impunity. It is safe to say that  joints, etc., in silica never crack whilst one is making them nor during  the subsequent cooling. They may be set aside in an unfinished state and  taken up again without any precautions. Therefore it is possible for an  amateur to construct apparatus in silica which he would be quite unable  to produce from glass.    The behaviour of vitreous silica with solvents has not yet been fully  investigated, but Mr. H. G. Lacell has this subject in hand. If it  behaves like the other forms of anhydrous silica it will withstand the  action of all acids except hydrofluoric acid. It is, of course, very  readily acted upon by solutions of alkalis and alkaline salts.    As regards the use of silica in experiments with gases, it must be  remarked that vitreous silica, like platinum, is slightly permeable to  hydrogen when strongly heated. One consequence of this is that traces of  moisture are almost always to be found inside recently-made silica tubes  and bulbs, however carefully we may have dried the air forced into them  during the process of construction. Owing to the very low coefficient of  expansion of silica, it is not possible to seal platinum wires"]]]
