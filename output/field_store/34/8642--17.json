STEPHANOPHORUS LEUCOCEPHALUS (Vieill.).    (WHITE-CAPPED TANAGER.)    [Plate IV.]    [Illustration: STEPHANOPHORUS LEUCOCEPHALUS.]      +Stephanophorus leucocephalus+, _Scl. et Salv.

Azara gave the generic name _Lindo_ (beautiful) to the Tanagers, and  this species he named the \"Blue White-headed Beautiful,\" the entire  plumage being of a very lovely deep corn-flower blue, except a cap of  silvery-white feathers on the head, with a crimson spot on the forehead,  looking like a drop of blood.    It is a summer bird in Buenos Ayres, where it makes its appearance in  spring in the woods bordering on the Plata river, and is usually seen  singly or in pairs. The nest is built in a tree ten or twelve feet from  the ground, and is somewhat shallow and lined with soft dry grass.  The female lays four eggs, white and spotted with deep red. During  incubation the male sits concealed in the thick foliage close by,  amusing itself by the hour with singing, its performance consisting of  chattering disconnected notes uttered in so low a tone as to make one  fancy that the bird is merely trying to recall some melody it has  forgotten, or endeavouring to construct a new one by jerking out  a variety of sounds at random. The bird never gets beyond this  unsatisfactory stage, however, and must be admired for its exquisite  beauty alone.      37. TANAGRA SAYACA, Linn.

Brazil and Argentina.    In the 'Catalogue of Birds' I referred the Argentine Blue Tanager to _T.  cyanoptera_, though expressing a doubt upon the subject. I am now  disposed to adopt Graf. v. Berlepsch's view that the Argentine species  rather belongs to _T. sayaca_.--P. L. S.    This species migrates as far south as Buenos Ayres, and appears in  spring, in small flocks or parties of three or four birds, in the woods  on the shores of the Plata. The male utters a series of peculiar  squealing notes by way of song.      38. TANAGRA BONARIENSIS (Gm.).    (BLUE-AND-YELLOW TANAGER.)      +Tanagra bonariensis+, _Berl. Zeitschr. ges.

The plumage of the male of this fine Tanager is rich blue above and  yellow beneath; the upper plumage of the female is a uniform dull  olive-green, the breast and belly buff-colour.    It is a migratory species, which appears in Buenos Ayres in small flocks  in summer. Both sexes have a long, sharp, reedy call-note; the male also  possesses a song composed of notes with a peculiar bleating sound.      39. PYRANGA AZARAE, d'Orb.

Different investigators might choose  different limits for the three categories young, subadult, and adult.  Museum specimens were assigned to one of five age groups listed below  mostly on the basis of tooth wear, essentially as described by  Hoffmeister (1951:1).         Juvenile: M3 just breaking through bony covering of jaw or showing       no wear whatsoever.         Young: M3 worn smooth except for labial cusps, and M1 and M2       showing little or no wear.         Subadult: M3 worn smooth; labial cusp may persist, but is well       worn; M1 and M2 having lingual cusps worn, but not smooth; labial       cusps showing little wear.         Adult: Lingual cusps worn smooth and labial cusps showing       considerable wear; labial cusp of M3 may persist.         Old: Cusps worn smooth; not more than one re-entrant angle per       tooth discernible, frequently none.    For live animals examined in the field, criteria based on pelage and  breeding condition were used, as follows:         Juvenile: Only gray, juvenal pelage present.         Young: Subadult pelage apparent on lateral line or on sides; body       usually smaller than in adults.         Subadults: Subadult pelage having mostly replaced juvenal pelage;       mice often as large as adults; testes of males often abdominal in       breeding season; gray juvenal pelage may persist on head of some       individuals.         Adult: Adult pelage present; body usually largest of all animals in       population; females may have enlarged mammae from nursing previous       litters; testes of males usually scrotal in breeding season; gray       pelage may be present on head of some individuals.    Old individuals in the field could not be distinguished from adults;  hence any animals that appeared older, or more developed, than subadults  were classified as adults.    In _P. truei_, subadult pelage appears first on the lateral line or on  the flanks; new pelage is ochraceous and contrasts markedly with the  gray juvenal coat. In _P. maniculatus_, the subadult pelage contrasts  less with the juvenal coat; the new pelage progresses from anterior to  posterior over the body in the same manner as in _truei_, but replaces  the juvenal coat in a less distinct manner than in _truei_. As a result,  contrast often is lacking between juvenal and subadult pelages in  _maniculatus_ making it difficult to assign an individual to one of  these two age categories when examined in the field. In museum  specimens, the subadult pelage is much more noticeable because it can be  compared with the pelages of other specimens. The subadult pelage in _P.  maniculatus_ is duller than the adult pelage: In _P. truei_ the subadult  and adult pelages appear to have an equal sheen.    In early winter, the postjuvenal pelage acquired by young individuals of  _P. truei_ was thick and luxuriant and indistinguishable from the winter  pelage of adults. My observations lead me to conclude that individuals  born late in the breeding season molt from juvenal summer pelage  directly into winter adult pelage. Technically, this new coat is the  postjuvenal one, yet it cannot be distinguished as such after the molt  is completed.          ANOMALIES AND INJURIES      Anatomical anomalies were rare in the individuals of _Peromyscus_ that I  examined. When anomalies were found they were striking, principally  because of their low rate of occurrence.    One female of _P. truei_, born in captivity, had a congenital defect of  the pinna of the right ear, noted on the fifteenth day after birth.  Closer examination then and later revealed that the pinna was normal in  all respects except that the tip was missing. The tip showed no evidence  of injury. When the mouse was subadult, this defective pinna was  approximately half as long as the normal pinna. The topmost part of the  defective pinna was somewhat more constricted in circumference than the  normal one.    On September 11, 1963, a subadult male of _P. truei_ was captured that  had five functional toes on its right front foot, the only one of more  than 175 individuals caught and handled in the field that exhibited  polydactyly. The front foot was examined closely in the field, but it  could not be determined how or where the extra bones of the sixth toe  articulated. _Peromyscus_ normally has four full-sized toes on each  front foot, and a small inner toe hardly more than an enlarged tubercle,  having no nail.    A few mice of both species had broken toes or claws torn off. Such  injuries were more common on toes of the hind foot. In several instances  the toes were shortened, as if by marking, although the animals  concerned had been marked earlier by clipping toes other than the  injured toes. The reason for these injuries is not apparent, although  they could have been caused by fighting, or from having been caught in  doors of Sherman live traps.    Toes of several mice were swollen and inflamed due to small glochids of  cacti that were stuck in them. Apparently the mice had stepped on the  glochids by chance, for I found no evidence that _Peromyscus_ of either  species eats cacti.    One _P. truei_ had a broken tail; three other individuals had tails  about one-half normal length. One _P. maniculatus_ had a shortened tail.  Some of these injuries probably were caused by the Sherman live traps;  several individuals of _P. truei_ were released after having been caught  by the tail by the spring-loaded door of these traps.    On October 17, 1963, an adult _P. truei_ had a bleeding penis; when this  mouse was recaptured on October 25, the injury was healed.      Losses Attributed to Exposure in Traps    Observations of wild mice caught in live traps suggest that metabolic  maturity is reached later than physical and reproductive maturity. In  such trapping, it became apparent that juvenal and young mice suffered  from exposure to cold and to heat much more than did subadult or adult  mice. Although traps were carefully shaded and ample nesting material  and food provided, some mice died in the traps. An overwhelming majority  of these mice were juveniles and young.    Traps were checked in the morning, both in the summer and autumn, yet  mice died in traps that were barely warm to the touch, in summer, and  cool to the touch in autumn. Older mice frequently were found in traps  that were warm, or even hot, to the touch; yet the older mice rarely  died in such traps. Apparently the tolerance of adults is much greater  to heating and chilling. Greater bulk and perhaps longer pelage in  adults might provide sufficiently better insulation to account for this  difference.    Occasionally juvenal mice were found in traps in a sluggish and weakened  condition, especially in autumn when nights were cool. In such cases the  mice were either cupped in the hands and warmed until lively enough to  fend for themselves, or, if especially weakened, were taken to the  laboratory. None of such animals that were returned to the laboratory  lived for more than two weeks. Most of those released in the field did  not reappear in the traps.    I conclude that juvenal and young mice placed under stress by  overheating or cooling die immediately or live only a few days. Subadult  and adult animals tolerate more extreme conditions of overheating or  cooling, presumably because they are able to regulate their internal  temperature better, by either losing or retaining heat more effectively.    Mice found dead in overheated traps had salivated heavily, and may also  have licked the fur on their chests to increase heat dissipation. One  such adult, of _P. truei_, had a wet chest when he was taken from a warm  trap; when released, this mouse ran to a nearby plant of _Comandra  umbellata_, and ate a few of the succulent leaves before running off.  This individual was trapped several times later in the summer, and  apparently suffered no ill effects from the exposure.      Dental Anomalies    Abnormalities in the formation and occlusion, or decay of teeth, are  relatively rare in wild mammals. Of all bodily structures, the teeth  apparently are under the most rigid genetic controls; they form early in  the embryo and follow rigidly specified patterns in their ontogeny.  Apparently any deviation from the normal pattern of tooth formation is  quickly selected against. All specimens of _P. m. rufinus_ and _P. t.  truei_ in the collection of the Museum of Natural History at the  University of Kansas, and in my collection, were examined for dental  anomalies. A total of 317 specimens of _P. m. rufinus_ and 54 specimens  of _P. t. truei_ were examined. The following specimens were found to  have abnormalities:    K. U. 69361, _P. maniculatus_, adult: Small bundles of plant fibers are  lodged between all upper teeth and have penetrated the maxilla anterior  to the left M1. The maxillary bone is eroded away from the roots of all  teeth. The anteriormost roots of both lower first molars are almost  completely exposed, because the dentary has been abraded away.    K.
