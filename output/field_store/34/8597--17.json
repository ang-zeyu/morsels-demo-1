Many such graceful attentions,  offered in an unostentatious manner to all about him, illustrated the  kindness and noble simplicity of his nature. His family could not but  exult in his intellectual greatness, his rare endowments, and his  lofty career, yet they seemed to lose sight of all these in their love  for him. I had once the pleasure of travelling with his eldest son,  who related to me many interesting facts and traits of his life. He  said he had never heard him speak impatiently to any member of his  family. He mentioned that as he was leaving that morning for his home  in Alabama, a younger brother said, \"Come soon again, and see us,  brother A----, for do you not see that father is growing old, and is  not father the dearest, best old man in the world!\"    Like Cincinnatus, he enjoyed rural life and occupation. It was his  habit, when at home, to go over his grounds every day. I remember his  returning one morning from a walk about his plantation, delighted with  the fine specimens of corn and rice which he brought in for us to  admire. That morning--the trifling incident shows his consideration  and kindness of feeling, as well as his tact and power of  adaptation--seeing an article of needlework in the hands of sister  A----, who was then a stranger there, he examined it, spoke of the  beauty of the coloring, the variety of the shade, and by thus showing  an interest in her, at once made her at ease in his presence.    His eldest daughter always accompanied him to Washington, and in the  absence of his wife, who was often detained by family cares at Fort  Hill, this daughter was his solace amid arduous duties, and his  confidant in perplexing cases. Like the gifted De Stael, she loved her  father with enthusiastic devotion. Richly endowed by nature, improved  by constant companionship with the great man, her mind was in harmony  with his, and he took pleasure in counselling with her. She said, \"Of  course, I do not understand as he does, for I am comparatively a  stranger to the world, yet he likes my unsophisticated opinion, and I  frankly tell him my views on any subject about which he inquires of  me.\"    Between himself and his younger daughter there was a peculiar and most  tender union. As by the state of her health she was deprived of many  enjoyments, her indulgent parents endeavored to compensate for every  loss by their affection and devotion. As reading was her favorite  occupation, she was allowed to go to the letter-bag when it came from  the office, and select the papers she preferred. On one occasion, she  had taken two papers, containing news of importance, which her father  was anxious to see, but he would allow no one to disturb her until she  had finished their perusal.    In his social as well as in his domestic relations he was  irreproachable. No shadow rested on his pure fame, no blot on his  escutcheon. In his business transactions he was punctual and  scrupulously exact. He was honorable as well as honest. Young men who  were reared in his vicinity, with their eyes ever on him, say that in  all respects, in small as well as in great things, his conduct was so  exemplary that he might well be esteemed a model.    His profound love for his own family, his cordial interest in his  friends, his kindness and justice in every transaction, were not small  virtues in such a personage.    He was anti-Byronic. I never heard him ridicule or satirize a human  being. Indeed, he might have been thought deficient in a sense of the  ludicrous, had he not by the unvarying propriety of his own conduct  proved his exquisite perception of its opposites. When he differed in  opinion from those with whom he conversed, he seemed to endeavor by a  respectful manner, to compensate for the disagreement. He employed  reason rather than contradiction, and so earnestly would he urge an  opinion and so fully present an argument, that his opponent could not  avoid feeling complimented rather than mortified. He paid a tribute to  the understandings of others by the force of his own reasoning, and by  his readiness to admit every argument which he could, although  advanced in opposition to one he himself had just expressed.    On one occasion I declined taking a glass of wine at his table. He  kindly said, \"I think you carry that a little too far. It is well to  give up every thing intoxicating, but not these light wines.\" I  replied that wine was renounced by many, for the sake of consistency,  and for the benefit of those who could not afford wine. He  acknowledged the correctness of the principle, adding, \"I do not know  how temperance societies can take any other ground,\" and then defined  his views of temperance, entered on a course of interesting argument,  and stated facts and statistics. Of course, were all men like Mr.  Calhoun temperance societies would be superfluous. Perhaps he could  not be aware of the temptations which assail many men--he was so  purely intellectual, so free from self-indulgence. Materiality with  him was held subject to his higher nature. He did not even indulge  himself in a cigar. Few spent as little time and exhausted as little  energy in mere amusements. Domestic and social enjoyments were his  pleasures--kind and benevolent acts were his recreations.    He always seemed willing to converse on any subject which was  interesting to those about him. Returning one evening from Fort Hill,  I remarked to a friend, \"I have never been more convinced of Mr.  Calhoun's genius than to-day, while he talked to us of a flower.\" His  versatile conversation evinced his universal knowledge, his quick  perception, and his faculty of adaptation. A shower one day compelled  him to take shelter in the shed of a blacksmith, who was charmed by  his familiar conversation and the knowledge he exhibited of the  mechanic arts. A naval officer was once asked, after a visit to Fort  Hill, how he liked Mr. Calhoun. \"Not at all,\" says he--\"I never like a  man who knows more about my profession than I do myself.\" A clergyman  wished to converse with him on subjects of a religious nature, and  after the interview remarked that he was astonished to find him better  informed than himself on those very points wherein he had expected to  give him information. I have understood that Mr. Calhoun avoided an  expression of opinion with regard to different sects and creeds, or  what is called religious controversy; and once, when urged to give his  views in relation to a disputed point, he replied, \"That is a subject  to which I have never given my attention.\"    Mr. Calhoun was unostentatious and ever averse to display. He did not  appear to talk for the sake of exhibition, but from the overflowing of  his earnest nature. Whether in the Senate or in conversation with a  single listener, his language was choice, his style fervid, his manner  impressive. Never can I forget his gentle earnestness when endeavoring  to explain his views on some controverted subject, and observing that  my mind could hardly keep pace with his rapid reasoning, he would  occasionally pause and say, in his kind manner, \"Do you see?\"    He did not seek to know the opinion of others with regard to himself.  Anonymous letters he never read, and his daughters and nieces often  snatched from the flames letters of adulation as well as censure which  he had not read. Although he respected the opinions of his  fellow-men, he did not seek office or worldly honor. A few years  since, one to whom he ever spoke freely, remarked to him that some  believed that he was making efforts to obtain the presidency. At that  moment he had taken off his glasses, and was wiping them, and thus he  replied: \"M----, I think when a man is too old to see clearly through  his glasses, he is too old to think of the presidency.\" And recently  he said to her, \"They may impute what motives they please to me, but I  do not seek office.\" So much did he respect his country, that he might  have been gratified by the free gift of the people; so much did he  love his country, that he might have rejoiced at an opportunity to  serve it, but would he have swerved one iota from his convictions to  secure a kingdom? Who that knew him believes it?    It has been said by that brilliant satirist Horace Walpole, that every  man has his price. I never did believe so evil a thing; I have been  too conversant with the great and good to believe this libel; and I  doubt not there are others beside Mr. Calhoun who value truth and  honor above all price or office.    Highly as our great statesman regarded appreciation, yet he could  endure to be misrepresented. While his glorious eye would light with  more brilliant lustre at the greeting of friendship or the earnest  expression of confidence, he rose superior to abuse or censure. I  believe it was ever thus while in health. The last winter, dying in  the Senate chamber, his feeble frame could ill repel the piercing  shafts of his antagonists. The ebbing currents in his pulses were  accelerated. He could not desert his post, though the contest raged  fiercely, but his great soul was wounded. He loved his country, he  loved the Union, and it was a great grief to him in his last hours to  be misunderstood and misrepresented. Still, he was consoled by the  thought that in the end he would be appreciated. Some one remarked to  him that he was a very unpopular man. He replied, \"I am, among  politicians, but not among the people, and you will know this when I  am dead.\"    Though Mr. Calhoun acknowledged, in his own winning way, the  involuntary tributes of friendship and admiration, he courteously  declined, whenever he could with propriety, public testimonies of  homage which were offered to him. His wife shared with him this  unostentatious spirit, preferring the voice of friendship to the  acclamations of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36496"],[0,"On the cattle plague: or, Contagious typhus in horned cattle. Its history, (#15)"],[1," these innocent creatures were tended by  intelligent and benevolent hands, which understood and felt for their  frail constitutions; food of the best quality was lavishly supplied to  them, and whatever they could wish for lay around them in abundance;  richly reared, they had themselves become so many ornaments within these  scenes of beauty, and all men thought that here, at least, were plots of  rural ground which the genius of epizootia would not invade, and in  which the healthy herds were invulnerable to contagion.    It was under these circumstances that the fine farms of Earl Granville,  at Golder's Green, skirting the Finchley Road,[H] containing as many as  130 milch cows, were suddenly and fiercely attacked amidst their  seeming immunity, and struck down in great numbers.    \"When I left England a month ago,\" said the noble lord, \"there were  about 130 milch cows in four sheds; in the two largest and best managed  I found only one cow yesterday, September 4th.\"    The park of Holly Lodge,[I] which is partly bounded by the main road  along which pass and repass files of cattle going to and coming from the  markets, was visited by the same unsparing scourge. Now certainly, the  noble and beneficent lady of the manor, who secured to her cattle every  attention, and who, confiding in the resources of medical science,  attempted every means to save these stricken creatures doomed to an  inevitable death; she whose enlightened mind, equally open to the claims  of science as to those of misfortune, desired that experiments should be  made which might tend to throw any light on this devastating malady;  she, at any rate, one would think, might have escaped the common lot  without exciting wonder or envy at the privilege which she enjoyed. But  this fell and sweeping epizootia, inexorable in its latitudinarian  march, entered those shady bounds, and decimated those orderly sheds  with the same impartiality as it did that of the poor man, Cutting,  whose whole fortune was stored up in the two milch cows whose death he  had to deplore.    This epizootia threatens to invade, one by one, all the European States,  like the awful scourge of 1750, to which we have already drawn  attention. For even now Holland and Belgium[J] have been smitten; and  the alarm it has excited has for a time superseded the panic which the  stealthy advance of the cholera to the west had kindled. Some imagine  that it might have been kept out of Great Britain, or have been checked  in its outbreak. But, in spite of all the safest precautions and the  soundest measures of preparation, it would most likely have baffled  human skill, and neither been held aloof nor stifled in its focus. But  how painful it is, to have to write and to think that ignorance,  carelessness, revolting cupidity, and the most wanton violation of the  laws, have all contributed to extend the evil, with the foulest  premeditation and the blindest disregard!    To feel one's self a stranger in a country, and to be able to rejoice at  one's connexions with it, and at the same time to be obliged to give  publicity to certain truths distasteful to those to whom they are told,  is a most painful task. But, as it would be to swerve from that duty and  loyalty which the national interests as well as those of science impose  upon a writer, not to speak out with impartial justice in a matter of so  vital an importance, we beg permission to consider, without reserve,  this delicate question:--the causes which have contributed to propagate  the complaint.      V.    England, so long spared by that wasting scourge, which had so often  extended its ravages over France and other kingdoms during the last  sixty years, was taken by surprise; and the regulations and laws  necessary to stifle without delay the distemper in its focus--that is to  say, in the metropolis--not being in readiness, the outbreak of the  disease found her helpless and unarmed.    On the other hand, the organic forms of the English Government and  municipal bodies, the reserve of the Cabinet during the vacation, the  limited power of the Lord Mayor and his civic counsellors, the  subdivision of London into parishes and vestries, as in the good times  of the middle ages, the loose scattering of the shambles and meat  markets through the many streets of the huge town, the right asserted by  each man to be absolutely independent and free, the sanctity of the  Englishman's home, &c., &c., all concurred to let loose and propagate  the contagion, instead of keeping it within bounds.    Indeed, whilst the competent authorities, with all the energy which  could be expected of them on so grave a matter, were meeting and  discussing the best measures to be taken, and the interesting debates at  the Mansion-house were throwing the first light upon the question, the  insidious malady pursued its destructive progress, diffusing new terror  and alarm. When at length the Privy Council issued their orders,  prescribing the public declaration of sick cattle, and that no affected  beast was to be conveyed either by rail or by ship, whilst all the  necessary means of purification and disinfection were to be employed,  &c., it was unfortunately too late, the dreadful calamity having taken  root and multiplied its stem like the upas-tree.    What a field for reflection there is in these cases, which originating  with the imperfect state of the laws and institutions, have fostered and  encouraged the disease! But this is a subject which it would not behove  us to discuss, and we prefer to show by the notes which will be found  appended to the end of this work, and which are produced as attesting  documents, that cattle proprietors, by their own confession, too often  sacrifice the interests of the public to their own private advantage.[K]    Nor have we been able to participate in the thoughts and reflections of  so many sensible and judicious persons, on the impotence and  dilatoriness of the public authorities, and also, let us say, on the  inadequate pecuniary means proposed by a people so lavish of its wealth  when useful and great undertakings are designed, without paying a  natural tribute of regret, to the memory of a Prince who took so deep an  interest in the progress of agriculture, and who, had he still been  living, would have known how to direct with a firm and steady hand, the  right measures to be taken amidst so many intricacies and  embarrassments.    Sometimes allusion has been made to France in the speeches delivered at  these meetings, presided over by that active magistrate, the Lord Mayor.  In the course of these remarks the speakers have praised and held up to  admiration the advantages of her system of centralization, the decrees  of her sanitary police, and the promptness with which she executes the  measures which the public interests require. That is true. France is  certainly in a state to resist the scourge with very effectual means to  arrest its progress; but if in this matter, as in some others, she have  acquired a superiority, it has only been by an experience dearly  purchased, these epizootics having returned more than once to destroy  her flocks and herds. Politically, the same might be said of her  revolutions, those great moral epidemics.    An orator, a writer, went so far as to say, in one of his numerous  letters, the one dated the 24th of August: \"I regret to say some of our  neighbours laugh at our expense.\"[L]    No, your neighbours will not laugh at your misfortunes. They sympathize  at present both in your joys and sorrows, and if I have taken up my pen  on this occasion, it has only been because I could not look with  indifference on your too just anxieties, when I flattered myself that I  might write some useful pages to mitigate and relieve them.    As most newspaper readers are aware,[M] and as everybody may easily  ascertain, the diseased cattle, in spite of reiterated orders to destroy  them immediately, were, nevertheless, driven to the markets to be sold  for what could be got for them; or when their tainted condition was too  glaring they were at once sent off to the private shambles, the owners  of which, in order to disguise the accusatory proof of the misdemeanor,  hastened to sell the body of the animal. It would be quite impossible to  mention all the violations of the law, which every day continue to fill  the columns of the public journals. One graceless wretch, who deserved  to be hanged for it, if his ignorance do not excuse him, was so infamous  as to introduce a sick cow into a shed not yet attainted, in his  criminal desire of propagating the disease there.[N]    Thus, then, independently of the causes inherent to the typhus itself,  which served of necessity to diffuse it, other causes proceeding from  the defective state of the law, and the perfidy of individuals, have  contributed to its dissemination. And yet the Government circulars, the  newspapers, and the reports of veterinary doctors have made known that  the slightest omissions and inattentions were serious--that the want of  ventilation and cleanliness in the stables, the overcrowding of the  cattle, and their abiding near their own droppings, or dung-heaps--that  the keeping of dead bodies close to farms, cowsheds, enclosed grounds,  and fields--that the hasty and imperfect burial of cattle--that the  collection and transit of their fragments, bones, horns, and skins--that  the driving on the public roads of any animal either tainted itself, or  having lived among those that were sick--that the clothes of persons and  stable utensils, soiled with putrid liquids--that all these, and similar  causes, were capable of propagating or aggravating the disease.    But whilst we must loudly condemn the voluntary misdeeds of those who  drove their sick cattle to market, it must likewise be allowed that, to  conform one's self rigidly to the given injunctions, was sometimes  attended with serious"]]]
