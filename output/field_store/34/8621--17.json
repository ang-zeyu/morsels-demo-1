Swords were still  being worn as a regulation part of full dress, and special weapons were  always provided at a grand concert for the use of the instrumental solo  performers, who, when about to appear on the platform, were girt for  the occasion by an attendant, known as the \"sword-bearer.\" [See Musical  Haunts in London, F. G. Edwards, quoting Dr W. H. Cummings.]    Haydn's first concert, we have said, was an immense success. Burney  records that his appearance in the orchestra \"seemed to have an  electrical effect on all present, and he never remembered a performance  where greater enthusiasm was displayed.\" A wave of musical excitement  appears to have been passing through London, for on this very evening  both Covent Garden and Drury Lane Theatres were packed with audiences  drawn together by the oratorio performances there. Haydn was vastly  pleased at having the slow movement of his symphony encored--an unusual  occurrence in those days--and he spoke of it afterwards as worthy of  mention in his biography. Fresh from the dinner-table, the audience  generally fell asleep during the slow movements! When the novelty of the  Salomon concerts had worn off, many of the listeners lapsed into their  usual somnolence. Most men in Haydn's position would have resented such  inattention by an outburst of temper. Haydn took it good-humouredly, and  resolved to have his little joke.    The \"Surprise\" Symphony    He wrote the well-known \"Surprise\" Symphony. The slow movement of this  work opens and proceeds in the most subdued manner, and at the moment  when the audience may be imagined to have comfortably settled for their  nap a sudden explosive fortissimo chord is introduced. \"There all the  women will scream,\" said Haydn, with twinkling eyes. A contemporary  critic read quite a different \"programme\" into it. \"The 'Surprise,'\"  he wrote, \"might not be inaptly likened to the situation of a beautiful  shepherdess who, lulled to slumber by the murmur of a distant waterfall,  starts alarmed by the unexpected firing of a fowling-piece.\" One can  fancy the composer's amusement at this highly-imaginative interpretation  of his harmless bit of waggery.    Gallic Excitement    The same success which attended Haydn's first concert marked the rest  of the series. The Prince of Wales's presence at the second concert no  doubt gave a certain \"lead\" to the musical public. We read in one of  the Gallic newspapers: \"It is truly wonderful what sublime and august  thoughts this master weaves into his works. Passages often occur which  it is impossible to listen to without becoming excited--we are carried  away by admiration, and are forced to applaud with hand and mouth. The  Frenchmen here cannot restrain their transports in soft adagios; they  will clap their hands in loud applause and thus mar the effect.\"    In the midst of all this enthusiasm the factionists were keeping up  their controversy about the opening of Gallini's Theatre. Gallini had  already engaged the services of Haydn, together with an orchestra led  by Salomon, but nothing could be done without the Lord Chamberlain's  license for the performance of operas. To prevent the issue of that  license was the avowed object of the Pantheon management and their  friends. The fight was rendered all the more lively when the Court  divided itself between the opposing interests. \"The rival theatre,\"  wrote Horace Walpole, \"is said to be magnificent and lofty, but it is  doubtful whether it will be suffered to come to light; in short the  contest will grow political; 'Dieu et mon Droit' (the King) supporting  the Pantheon, and 'Ich dien' (the Prince of Wales) countenancing the  Haymarket. It is unlucky that the amplest receptacle is to hold the  minority.\"    Cantatas, Catches and Choruses    That was how it turned out. The Lord Chamberlain finally refused his  license for operatic performances, and Gallini had to be content with a  license for \"entertainments of music and dancing.\" He opened his house  on the 20th of March, and continued during the season to give mixed  entertainments twice a week. Various works of Haydn's were performed at  these entertainments, including a cantata composed for David, an Italian  catch for seven voices, and the chorus known as \"The Storm,\" a setting  of Peter Pindar's \"Hark, the wild uproar of the waves.\" An opera, \"Orfeo  ed Euridice,\" to which we have already referred, was almost completed,  but its production had necessarily to be abandoned, a circumstance which  must have occasioned him considerable regret in view of the store he set  upon his dramatic work.    Benefit and Other Concerts    On the 16th of May he had a benefit concert, when the receipts exceeded  by 150 pounds the 200 pounds which had been guaranteed. A second benefit  was given on May 30, when \"La Passione Instrumentale\" (the \"Seven Words\"  written for Cadiz) was performed. This work was given again on June 10,  at the benefit concert of the \"little\" Clement, a boy violinist who grew  into the famous artist for whom Beethoven wrote his Violin Concerto.  On this occasion Haydn conducted for Clement, and it is interesting to  observe that Clement took the first violin at the last concert Haydn  ever attended, in March 1808.    Haydn on Handel    In the note-book he kept while in London, one of the entries reads:  \"Anno 1791, the last great concert, with 885 persons, was held in  Westminster, Anno 1792, it was transferred to St Margaret's Chapel, with  200 performers. This evoked criticism.\" Haydn here refers to the Handel  Commemoration Festival, the sixth and last of the century. He  attended that of 1791, and was much impressed with the grandeur of the  performances. A place had been reserved for him near the King's box, and  when the \"Hallelujah Chorus\" was sung, and the whole audience rose to  their feet, he wept like a child. \"Handel is the master of us all,\" he  sobbed. No one knew the value of Handel's choral work better than Haydn.  After listening at the Concert of Antient Music to the chorus, \"The  Nations tremble,\" from \"Joshua,\" he told Shield that \"he had long been  acquainted with music, but never knew half its powers before he heard  it, as he was perfectly certain that only one inspired author ever  did, or ever would, pen so sublime a composition.\" [See the Appendix to  Shield's Introduction to Harmony.]    Oxford Doctor of Music    Haydn was no Handel, either as man or artist. Handel declined the Doctor  of Music degree with the characteristic remark: \"What the devil I throw  my money away for that the blockhead wish?\" Haydn did not decline it,  though probably enough he rated the distinction no higher than Handel  did. In the month of July he went down to the Oxford Commemoration, and  was then invested with the degree. Handel's latest biographer, Mr W. S.  Rockstro, says that the Oxford fees would have cost Handel 100 pounds.  Haydn's note of the expense is not so alarming: \"I had to pay one and  a half guineas for the bell peals at Oxforth [sic] when I received the  doctor's degree, and half a guinea for the robe.\" He seems to have found  the ceremonies a little trying, and not unlikely he imagined himself  cutting rather a ridiculous figure in his gorgeous robe of cherry and  cream-coloured silk. At the concert following the investiture he seized  the gown, and, raising it in the air, exclaimed in English, \"I thank  you.\" \"I had to walk about for three days in this guise,\" he afterwards  wrote, \"and only wish my Vienna friends could have seen me.\" Haydn's  \"exercise\" for the degree was the following \"Canon cancrizans, a tre,\"  set to the words, \"Thy voice, O harmony, is divine.\"    [figure: a musical score excerpt]    This was subsequently used for the first of the Ten Commandments, the  whole of which he set to canons during his stay in London. Three grand  concerts formed a feature of the Oxford Commemoration.    The \"Oxford\" Symphony    At the second of these a symphony in G, written in 1787 or 1788, and  since known as the \"Oxford,\" was performed, with the composer at the  organ. He had taken a new symphony with him for the occasion, but owing  to lack of time for rehearsals, the earlier work was substituted.  Of this latter, the Morning Chronicle wrote that \"a more wonderful  composition never was heard. The applause given to Haydn was  enthusiastic; but the merit of the work, in the opinion of all the  musicians present, exceeded all praise.\"    Holiday Relaxations    The London season having now come to an end, Haydn proceeded to recruit  his energies by paying visits to distinguished people at their country  quarters, taking part in river excursions, picnics, and the like. Prince  Esterhazy had sent him a pressing summons to return for a great fete  which was being organized in honour of the Emperor, but having entered  into new engagements with Salomon and others, he found it impossible to  comply. A less indulgent employer would have requited him with instant  dismissal, but all that the prince said when they afterwards met was,  \"Ah, Haydn! you might have saved me 40,000 florins.\" His longest visit  at this time was spent with Mr Brassey, a Lombard Street banker, and  ancestor of the present peer. \"The banker,\" he says, \"once cursed  because he enjoyed too much happiness in this world.\" He gave lessons to  Miss Brassey, and \"enjoyed the repose of country life in the midst of  a family circle all cordially devoted to him.\" In November he was the  guest at two Guildhall banquets--that of the outgoing Lord Mayor on the  5th and that of his successor on the 9th. Of these entertainments he  has left a curious account, and as the memorandum is in English it  may, perhaps, be reproduced here. It runs as follows in Lady Wallace's  translation of the letters:    I was invited to the Lord Mayor's banquet on November 5.

Vessels of the largest       class now draw only as much water as the smallest drew       a few years ago, four feet five inches being regarded       as the _maximum_.         It appears from the following table that the average       length of these prodigious floating hotels is above 300       feet; some of them approaching 400. In the passenger       accommodation afforded by them no water communication       in any country can compete. Nothing can exceed the       splendor and luxury with which they are fitted up,       furnished, and decorated. Silk, velvet, the most costly       carpetings and upholstery, vast mirrors, gilding, and       carving, are profusely displayed in their decoration.       Even the engine-room in some of them is lined with       mirrors. In the Alida, for example, the end of the       engine-room is one vast mirror, in which the movements       of the brilliant and highly-finished machinery are       reflected. All the largest class are capable of running       from twenty to twenty-two miles an hour, and average       nearly twenty miles without difficulty.

During the last ten       years not a single catastrophe of this kind has been       recorded, although cylindrical boilers ten feet in       diameter, composed of plating 5-16ths of an inch thick,       are commonly used with steam of 50lb. pressure.         Previously to 1844 the lowest fare from New-York to       Albany, a distance of 145 miles, was 4s. 4d.; at       present the fare is 2s. 2d.--and for an additional sum       of the same amount the passenger can command the luxury       of a separate cabin. When the splendor and magnitude of       the accommodation is considered, the magnificence of       the furniture and accessories, and the luxuriousness of       the table, it will be admitted that no similar example       of cheap locomotion can be found in any part of the       globe. Passengers may there be transported in a       floating palace, surrounded with all the conveniences       and luxuries of the most splendid hotel, at the average       rate of twenty miles an hour, for less than _one-sixth       of a penny per mile_! It is not an uncommon occurrence       during the warm season to meet persons on board these       boats who have lodged themselves there permanently, in       preference to hotels on the banks of the river. Their       daily expenses in the boat are as follows:            Fare                                       2_s._ 2_d._          Separate bedroom                              2   2          Breakfast, dinner, and supper                 6   6                                                        ------         Total daily expense for board, lodging,       10  10         attendance, and travelling 150 miles,         at 20 miles an hour         Such accommodation is, on the whole, more economical       than a hotel. The bedroom is as luxuriously furnished       as the handsomest chamber in an hotel or private house,       and is much more spacious than the room similarly       designated in the largest packet ships.         The other class of steamers, used for towing the       commerce of the river, corresponds to the goods trains       on railways. No spectacle can be more remarkable than       this class of locomotive machines, dragging their       enormous load up the Hudson. They may be seen in the       midst of this vast stream, surrounded by a cluster of       twenty or thirty loaded craft of various magnitudes.       Three or four tiers are lashed to them at each side,       and as many more at their bow and at their stern. The       steamer is almost lost to the eye in the midst of this       crowd of vessels which cling around it, and the moving       mass is seen to proceed up the river, no apparent agent       of propulsion being visible, for the steamer and its       propellers are literally buried in the midst of the       cluster which clings to it and floats round and near       it.         As this _water-goods train_, for so it may be called,       ascends the river, it drops off its load, vessel by       vessel, at the towns which it passes. One or two are       left at Newburgh, another at Poughkeepsie, two or three       more at Hudson, one or two at Fishkill, and, finally,       the tug arrives with a residuum of some half-dozen       vessels at Albany.         The steam navigation of the Mississippi and the other       western rivers is conducted in a manner entirely       different from that of the Hudson. Every one must be       familiar with the lamentable accidents which happen       from time to time, and the loss of life from explosion       which continually takes place on those rivers. Such       catastrophes, instead of diminishing with the       improvement of art, seem rather to have increased.       Engineers have done literally nothing to check the       evil.         In a Mississippi steamboat the cabins and saloons are       erected on a flooring six or eight feet above the deck,       upon which and under them the engines are placed, which       are of the coarsest and most inartificial structure.       They are invariably worked with high-pressure steam,       and in order to obtain that effect which in the Hudson       steamers is due to a vacuum, the steam is worked at an       extraordinary pressure. We have ourselves actually       witnessed boilers of this kind, on the western rivers,       working under a full pressure of 120lb. per square inch       above the atmosphere, and we have been assured that       this pressure has been recently considerably increased,       so that it is not unfrequent now to find them working       with a bursting pressure of 200lb. per square inch!         As might naturally be expected, the chief theatre of       railway enterprise in America is the Atlantic States.       The Mississippi and its tributaries have served the"]]]
