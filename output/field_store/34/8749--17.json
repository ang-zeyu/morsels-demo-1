[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5113"],[0,"The Confessions of a Beachcomber (#15)"],[1," frail, fugitive  flowers distilling a deliciously sweet and grateful odour, the branches  crowded with gleaming berries, green, pink and red, present pleasing  aspect. As a change to the scenery of the jungle, a coffee estate has a  garden-like relief. But picking berry by berry is slow and monotonous  work, vexatious, too, to those mortals whose skin is sensitive to the  attacks of green ants. Then comes the various processes of the removal of  the pulp, first by machinery, finally by the fermentation of the still  adhering slimy residuum; then the drying and saving by exposure to the  sun on trays or on tarpaulins until all moisture is expelled; and the  hulling which disintegrates the parchment from the twin berries; then  winnowing, and finally the polishing. Do drinkers of the fragrant and  exhilarating beverage realise the amount of labour and care involved  before the crop is taken off and preserved from deterioration and decay?  A few berries that may have become mildewed during the slow, tedious and  anxious process of drying in the sun, may violate the delicate flavour  and aroma which the grower has been at pains to secure and fix. In coffee  it is as with many other features of rural life in Australia. The men who  undertake the production are for the most part those who have gained  their knowledge by personal experience on the spot. Reading and the  advice of experts who have graduated in countries where climatic  conditions are diverse and where the labour is cheap, yet skilled by  reason of generation after generation of occupation in it, do not  complete necessary knowledge. Problems have to be faced that have no  theoretical nor official solution, and blunders paid for, until by the  process of the elimination of mistakes the right way is discovered.  Losses mount up until either patience and means are exhausted, or success  crowns the application of intelligent enterprise. Then, when the coffee  planter, self-taught, in each and all of the departments of culture and  preparation, glories in the assurance of his capabilities to offer to the  world an article of indubitable character, he discovers that the vulgar  world, for the most part, prefers its coffee duly adulterated; indeed has  become so warped and perverted in perception that the pure and undefiled  article is looked upon with suspicion and distaste. Its flavour and aroma  are quite foreign to the ordinary coffee drinker. The contaminated  beverage is regarded as pure, and the genuine article is soundly  condemned as an imposition, and the seller of it is liable to be accused  of fraud. It is in a similar position to the good grape brandy which  Victorians produce, and which drinkers of some imported stuff (described  as one part cognac and three parts silent spirit) fail to recognise as  real brandy. If coffee is not muddy and thick and does not possess a  mawkish twang of liquorice, it is suspected. The delicate aromatic  flavour, the fragrant odour, the genial and stimulant effects are now  almost unknown, except in limited circles. North Queensland is capable of  growing far more than sufficient coffee for the Commonwealth, but coffee  is not a popular Australian beverage, and as it entirely loses its  specific balsam and identity under the manipulation of manufacturers, it  cannot get the chance of becoming popular. Australian wines, Australian  spirits and Australian coffee might well be the popular beverages of  Australians. But preference is given to foreign importations, of the  genuineness of some of which there are strong grounds for suspicion; or  in the case of coffee its elements are so disguised by adulteration that  a revolution in public taste must take place before it can possibly find  general favour.    But there are other branches of tropical agriculture to which the settler  may devote himself. Rubber offers belated fortune. Cotton, rice, tobacco  and fibre--plants flourish exceedingly, and in the production of ginger  and some sort of spices and medicinal gums, profit may be possible. The  manufacture of manilla rope from the fibre of the easily cultivated MUSA  TEXTILIS may be a remunerative industry. It is amply demonstrated that  butter quite up to the standard of exportation is to be manufactured in  tropical Queensland.    No one need starve or pine for lack of wholesome appetising and  nutritious food while the banana grows as it does in North Queensland,  and common as it is, the banana is one of the curiosities of the  vegetable world. One writer says: \"It is not a tree, a palm, a bush, a  vegetable, nor a herb; it is simply a herbaceous plant with the stature  of tree, and is perennial.\" He adds that the fruit contains no seed,  though he qualifies the latter statement by remarking that he has heard  of fully developed seeds occasionally appearing in the cultivated fruit  \"when left to ripen on the tree,\" and further that wild varieties of the  banana which propagate themselves by seed are reported to be found in  some parts of Eastern Asia. A high botanical authority includes in his  description of the species indigenous to Queensland, \"Fruit oblong,  succulent, indehiscent; seed numerous; tree-like herbs. Herbs with  perennial rhizome.\"    There are three if not more species of bananas native to Queensland, and  they form a conspicuous feature of the jungle. With remarkable rapidity  one of the species shoots up a ruddy symmetrical, slightly tapering  stem--smooth and polished where the old leaf-sheaths have been shed--to a  height of 20 and 30 feet, producing leaves 15 feet long and 2 feet broad,  small and crude flowers, and bunches of dwarf fruit containing little but  shot-like seeds. The energy of these plants seems to be concentrated in  the production of an elegant and proud form, the fruit being a mere  afterthought. But the effect of the broad pale green leaves, even when  frayed and ragged at the edges in and among the dark entanglement of the  jungle is so fine that the absence of edible fruit may be almost  forgiven.    In the most popular of the cultivated varieties, the far famed MUSA  CAVENDISHII, there is little of graceful form, save the broad leaves  mottled with brown. All the vitality of the plant is expended in  astonishing results. A comparatively lowly plant, its productions  in suitable soil are prodigious. In nine or ten months after the  planting of the rhizome, it bears under favourable conditions a bunch  weighing as much as 120 lb. to 160 lb. and comprising as many as  forty-eight dozen individual bananas. So great is the weight that to  prevent the downfall of the plant a stake sharpened at each end--one to  stick in the ground and the other into the soft stem--is needed to  buttress it. Before the fruit has fully developed, other shoots have  appeared; but each plant bears but one bunch, and when that is removed  the plant is decapitated and slowly decays, and the second and third and  fourth shoots from the rhizome successively arrive at the bearing stage  and are permitted to mature each its bunch and then fated to suffer  immediate decapitation. And so the process goes on for five or seven  years, by which time the vigour of the soil has been exhausted, and  moreover the rhizomes, originally planted about a foot deep, have grown up  to the surface, and are no longer capable of supporting a plant upright.  Then a fresh planting of rhizomes elsewhere takes place. It must not be  thought that the banana defertilises the soil. Phenomenal crops of sugar  cane are produced on a \"banana-sick\" land.    A traveller relating his tropical experiences glorifies the banana,  stating that he has eaten it \"ripe and luscious from the tree!\" In  North Queensland bananas ripening on the plant frequently split, and  seldom attain perfect flavour. The ripening process takes place after the  fully developed bunch is removed and hung up in a cool, shady, well-aired  locality. Then the fruit acquires its true lusciousness and aroma. Other  climes, other results, perhaps; but a banana, \"ripe and luscious from the  tree,\" is not generally expected in North Queensland. The fruit may  mature until it falls to the ground, yellow and soft, yet lack that  delicate finish, that benign essential, the craft of man bestows. It  would seem that the plant has been cultivated for so long a period that  it has become dependent upon man not only for its existence but for the  excellence of its crowning effort. An abandoned banana grove soon  disappears, for although seeds are undoubtedly produced, the occasions  are so rare that the reproduction of the cultivated varieties depends  solely upon the rhizome, and these very speedily deteriorate if  neglected. Another feature of the banana, of which man takes full  advantage, is that though the bunch be removed before the fruit is  matured as to size, the ripening process proceeds, just as though there  had been no untimely interference. The bananas may be small, but will, as  a rule, be almost as sweetly flavoured as those allowed to develop on the  plant. Yet the superfine aesthetic essence is not for the delight of  those to whom the fruit is tendered after it has undergone a sea voyage.  Let there be no misunderstanding with respect to the desirableness of the  coastal tract of North Queensland as a territory capable of supporting a  large, prosperous and healthful population. It is no part of the present  purpose to extol the mineral or the pastoral districts. They lie apart.  But in North Queensland agriculture is almost solely confined to the  coast and is essentially tropical. The tropics represent that portion of  the earth's surface wherein man may live with the minimum of exertion,  where actual wants are few, and wherein ample comforts may be enjoyed by  those who seek them with a quiet mind and easy understanding. Although  the question may be perhaps beyond proof, it might be safely asserted  that a larger proportion of men of the yeomen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/512"],[0,"Mosses from an Old Manse, and Other Stories (#15)"],[1,"there be such, will vanish, if you let them alone. Only put  yourself beyond hazard as to the real basis of matrimonial bliss, and  it is scarcely to be imagined what miracles, in the way of recognizing  smaller incongruities, connubial love will effect.    For my own part I freely confess that, in my bachelorship, I was  precisely such an over-curious simpleton as I now advise the reader not  to be. My early habits had gifted me with a feminine sensibility and  too exquisite refinement. I was the accomplished graduate of a dry  goods store, where, by dint of ministering to the whims of fine ladies,  and suiting silken hose to delicate limbs, and handling satins,  ribbons, chintzes calicoes, tapes, gauze, and cambric needles, I grew  up a very ladylike sort of a gentleman. It is not assuming too much to  affirm that the ladies themselves were hardly so ladylike as Thomas  Bullfrog. So painfully acute was my sense of female imperfection, and  such varied excellence did I require in the woman whom I could love,  that there was an awful risk of my getting no wife at all, or of being  driven to perpetrate matrimony with my own image in the looking-glass.  Besides the fundamental principle already hinted at, I demanded the  fresh bloom of youth, pearly teeth, glossy ringlets, and the whole list  of lovely items, with the utmost delicacy of habits and sentiments, a  silken texture of mind, and, above all, a virgin heart. In a word, if a  young angel just from paradise, yet dressed in earthly fashion, had  come and offered me her hand, it is by no means certain that I should  have taken it. There was every chance of my becoming a most miserable  old bachelor, when, by the best luck in the world, I made a journey  into another state, and was smitten by, and smote again, and wooed,  won, and married, the present Mrs. Bullfrog, all in the space of a  fortnight. Owing to these extempore measures, I not only gave my bride  credit for certain perfections which have not as yet come to light, but  also overlooked a few trifling defects, which, however, glimmered on my  perception long before the close of the honeymoon. Yet, as there was no  mistake about the fundamental principle aforesaid, I soon learned, as  will be seen, to estimate Mrs. Bullfrog's deficiencies and  superfluities at exactly their proper value.    The same morning that Mrs. Bullfrog and I came together as a unit, we  took two seats in the stage-coach and began our journey towards my  place of business. There being no other passengers, we were as much  alone and as free to give vent to our raptures as if I had hired a hack  for the matrimonial jaunt. My bride looked charmingly in a green silk  calash and riding habit of pelisse cloth; and whenever her red lips  parted with a smile, each tooth appeared like an inestimable pearl.  Such was my passionate warmth that--we had rattled out of the village,  gentle reader, and were lonely as Adam and Eve in paradise--I plead  guilty to no less freedom than a kiss. The gentle eye of Mrs. Bullfrog  scarcely rebuked me for the profanation. Emboldened by her indulgence,  I threw back the calash from her polished brow, and suffered my  fingers, white and delicate as her own, to stray among those dark and  glossy curls which realized my daydreams of rich hair.    \"My love,\" said Mrs. Bullfrog tenderly, \"you will disarrange my curls.\"    \"Oh, no, my sweet Laura!\" replied I, still playing with the glossy  ringlet. \"Even your fair hand could not manage a curl more delicately  than mine. I propose myself the pleasure of doing up your hair in  papers every evening at the same time with my own.\"    \"Mr. Bullfrog,\" repeated she, \"you must not disarrange my curls.\"    This was spoken in a more decided tone than I had happened to hear,  until then, from my gentlest of all gentle brides. At the same time she  put up her hand and took mine prisoner; but merely drew it away from  the forbidden ringlet, and then immediately released it. Now, I am a  fidgety little man, and always love to have something in my fingers; so  that, being debarred from my wife's curls, I looked about me for any  other plaything. On the front seat of the coach there was one of those  small baskets in which travelling ladies who are too delicate to appear  at a public table generally carry a supply of gingerbread, biscuits and  cheese, cold ham, and other light refreshments, merely to sustain  nature to the journey's end. Such airy diet will sometimes keep them in  pretty good flesh for a week together. Laying hold of this same little  basket, I thrust my hand under the newspaper with which it was  carefully covered.    \"What's this, my dear?\" cried I; for the black neck of a bottle had  popped out of the basket.    \"A bottle of Kalydor, Mr. Bullfrog,\" said my wife, coolly taking the  basket from my hands and replacing it on the front seat.    There was no possibility of doubting my wife's word; but I never knew  genuine Kalydor, such as I use for my own complexion, to smell so much  like cherry brandy. I was about to express my fears that the lotion  would injure her skin, when an accident occurred which threatened more  than a skin-deep injury. Our Jehu had carelessly driven over a heap of  gravel and fairly capsized the coach, with the wheels in the air and  our heels where our heads should have been. What became of my wits I  cannot imagine; they have always had a perverse trick of deserting me  just when they were most needed; but so it chanced, that in the  confusion of our overthrow I quite forgot that there was a Mrs.  Bullfrog in the world. Like many men's wives, the good lady served her  husband as a steppingstone. I had scrambled out of the coach and was  instinctively settling my cravat, when somebody brushed roughly by me,  and I heard a smart thwack upon the coachman's ear.    \"Take that, you villain!\" cried a strange, hoarse voice. \"You have  ruined me, you blackguard! I shall never be the woman I have been!\"    And then came a second thwack, aimed at the driver's other ear; but  which missed it, and hit him on the nose, causing a terrible effusion  of blood. Now, who or what fearful apparition was inflicting this  punishment on the poor fellow remained an impenetrable mystery to me.  The blows were given by a person of grisly aspect, with a head almost  bald, and sunken cheeks, apparently of the feminine gender, though  hardly to be classed in the gentler sex. There being no teeth to  modulate the voice, it had a mumbled fierceness, not passionate, but  stern, which absolutely made me quiver like calf's-foot jelly. Who  could the phantom be? The most awful circumstance of the affair is yet  to be told: for this ogre, or whatever it was, had a riding habit like  Mrs. Bullfrog's, and also a green silk calash dangling down her back by  the strings. In my terror and turmoil of mind I could imagine nothing  less than that the Old Nick, at the moment of our overturn, had  annihilated my wife and jumped into her petticoats. This idea seemed  the most probable, since I could nowhere perceive Mrs. Bullfrog alive,  nor, though I looked very sharply about the coach, could I detect any  traces of that beloved woman's dead body. There would have been a  comfort in giving her Christian burial.    \"Come, sir, bestir yourself! Help this rascal to set up the coach,\"  said the hobgoblin to me; then, with a terrific screech at three  countrymen at a distance, \"Here, you fellows, ain't you ashamed to  stand off when a poor woman is in distress?\"    The countrymen, instead of fleeing for their lives, came running at  full speed, and laid hold of the topsy-turvy coach. I, also, though a  small-sized man, went to work like a son of Anak. The coachman, too,  with the blood still streaming from his nose, tugged and toiled most  manfully, dreading, doubtless, that the next blow might break his head.  And yet, bemauled as the poor fellow had been, he seemed to glance at  me with an eye of pity, as if my case were more deplorable than his.  But I cherished a hope that all would turn out a dream, and seized the  opportunity, as we raised the coach, to jam two of my fingers under the  wheel, trusting that the pain would awaken me.    \"Why, here we are, all to rights again!\" exclaimed a sweet voice  behind. \"Thank you for your assistance, gentlemen. My dear Mr.  Bullfrog, how you perspire! Do let me wipe your face. Don't take this  little accident too much to heart, good driver. We ought to be thankful  that none of our necks are broken.\"    \"We might have spared one neck out of the three,\" muttered the driver,  rubbing his ear and pulling his nose, to ascertain whether he had been  cuffed or not. \"Why, the woman's a witch!\"    I fear that the reader will not believe, yet it is positively a fact,  that there stood Mrs. Bullfrog, with her glossy ringlets curling on her  brow, and two rows of orient pearls gleaming between her parted lips,  which wore a most angelic smile. She had regained her riding habit and  calash from the grisly phantom, and was, in all respects, the lovely  woman who had been sitting by my side at the instant of our overturn.  How she had happened to disappear, and who had supplied her place, and  whence she did now return, were problems too knotty for me to solve.  There stood my wife. That was the one thing certain among a heap of  mysteries. Nothing remained but to help her into the coach, and plod  on, through the journey of the day and the journey of life, as  comfortably as we could. As the driver closed the door upon us, I heard  him whisper to the three countrymen, \"How do you suppose a fellow feels  shut up in the cage with a she tiger?\"    Of course this query could have no reference to my situation. Yet,  unreasonable as it may appear, I confess that my feelings were not  altogether so ecstatic as when I first called Mrs. Bullfrog mine. True,  she was a sweet woman and an angel of a wife; but what if a Gorgon  should return, amid the"]]]
