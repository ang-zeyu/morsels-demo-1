It means that Russell, the greatest  producer of the electro-motor power on the continent, has been smitten  by its servant. It means that man has outstripped his knowledge of this  mysterious fluid, and has ignorantly converted through millions of  inadequate conductors and faultily insulated wires the terrible, the  unfathomed power of electricity into light and heat and force; that  Russell was gradually becoming a gigantic storage battery, charged and  surcharged, until the time when its electrostatic capacity had been  criminally abused, the negative forces of the heavens concentrated over  the obnoxious territory, and a discharge unparalleled in electrical  experiments restored nature's equilibrium, and consumed in one  unspeakable spark Russell and its blind inhabitants.\"    \"My God! Can this happen to Boston?\" cried the professor, trembling.    \"Or New York?\" asked Swift.    \"Or to Chicago?\" added the girl, faintly. She had revived and was  looking about her in a ghastly way. \"My mother used to live there.\"    This truly feminine view of a scientific subject passed unnoticed.    Mr. Ticks stood with his uncovered head yet bent before the annihilated  city. He spread his two hands out, palms to the ground, with a gesture  of indescribable significance, and made no reply.    Black, vitreous masses of melted conglomerate spread before them. Where  had stood the city, the sloping plain offered no obstruction to the  view. Russell, to the last splinter of iron or of wood, to the last chip  of brick or stone, to the last bone of the last corpse, was fused into a  terrible warning to the world by the rebellion of its own electricity.    \"I guess none of 'em knew what struck 'em!\" The professor hazarded this  humane suggestion, feeling that the oppressive silence should be broken  somehow.    \"The Kremmler chair was nothing to it,\" said Swift.    \"You are right,\" answered Mr. Ticks, gravely. \"That was the only boon.  So sudden and intense was the heat that men were ashes and the city was  molten before nerves could convey sensation to the brain. In the  fraction of a second, in the twinkling of a thought it was not, for God  took it.\"    The four breathed heavily. Again Mr. Ticks broke the silence. He laid  his hand paternally upon the young lady's shoulder.    \"It is very fortunate, Miss Magnet, that you were the only thoroughly  insulated person in this whole territory. The wooden boat, the inverted  glasses saved you. You only had a normal amount of electricity in you.  You were a poor conductor, otherwise you would have evaporated through  the law of induction.\"    \"I can't stand this any longer, or I'll be a fit candidate for an idiot  asylum!\" blurted out the professor finally. \"I am dying for a chaw.\"    He cast impatient glances at a trackless, desolated grade a mile away.  This grave of a great trunk line extended beyond their view.    The four had not stirred from where they had been dropped by the  balloon. To do so they would have had to pick their way cautiously.  Russell was like an extinct volcano. She was yet hot. But she did not  smoke, as one might have expected. There were no smouldering embers left  to produce smoke. Combustion had been instantaneous and complete.    But the travellers had no need to go sight-seeing. Everywhere was the  same blackened, cooling, ferruginous slag. To see one square yard was to  see the whole. The appalling thing about the effect was the cause.  Civilization, ever ready with revengeful thrusts, as if protesting  against the advance of science, had produced a new accident, a unique  disaster.    Swift made an automatic motion for his watch.    \"I must go,\" he said; \"I must get my despatch to the _Planet_ in time  for the evening edition. We will have a scoop on the whole world.\"    \"I'm your man,\" said the professor. \"We can foot it to the nearest  telegraph station in four hours.\"    \"Ah, I forgot,\" said Swift. \"That will lose me the four o'clock edition.  I'll have to hold the wire all night if I can get it. I'll wire such an  account as no other paper will ever get. There isn't a minute to lose!\"  It was then that Mr. Statis Ticks, realizing, whether from calculation  or from sympathy, that Miss Magnet could make no such forced march, and  seeing that the girl only held herself together under the tension of the  great excitement, gallantly proposed to remain by her and join the rest  of the party that evening by the first team that could be chartered.    But the young lady unexpectedly refused the proposition. Her whole  nature shrank from spending another minute in that blasted spot. It was  therefore arranged, much to Mr. Ticks' disappointment (for he had hoped  to add to his copious stock of mental notes by further investigation on  the ground), that the girl should accompany them, as far as she was  able, down the railroad, away from the lost city.    After a drink of lake water they started off, Swift supporting Miss  Magnet on the one side and Mr. Ticks on the other, the professor  stalking ahead.    \"Even the lake tastes of it,\" said Swift. \"Ugh!\"    \"Pass a current of electricity through a tumbler of water and there will  be detected the same flavor, though not so strong,\" answered Mr. Ticks.    The party made two miles slowly. Despite all her Western courage and  energy, Insula Magnet tottered by the way. To divert her attention, Mr.  Ticks led her on to talk about the electrical wonders of the extinct  city. The girl enlarged in a sad way upon its many and its curious uses.  The baby carriages, she said, took their helpless occupants on an  unaided turn around a large oval track in the park. They went by storage  battery. One electrician could take the place of twenty nurses and  control the power. Once in a while a baby died suddenly. The doctors  invariably pronounced it a case of heart failure. Washing was now  entirely done by electrical apparatus, likewise ironing and cooking. The  great American problem of the \"hired girl,\" Russell considered herself  to have solved.    An ingenious arrangement had been recently devised to have the  electricity supply the place of valet-de-chambre, but only a few had  used it. One or two thought it a hardship to be aroused from bed  whether one would or no, to be washed and summarily dressed by an  implacable power that performed its set tasks stolidly in spite of  anathemas and threats. Can a man abuse his electrical valet? Let him try  it if he dare.    The phonograph was in universal use. _The Phonograph Daily_ was a  rival--one cannot call it sheet, rather wax cylinder--just started, and  the din made by those loquacious instruments was worse than the chatter  of monkeys in the cocoanut groves of New Guinea.    Electric heaters warmed the rooms. Electric paper lighted them with a  suffused and generous glow. No one used stairs. Electric elevators did  all the arduous house-climbing. No one made calls any more, for it was  an easy matter to ring your acquaintance up and see her in her  drawing-room while you talked to her. Women made an elaborate toilet for  such interviews. It was soon expected that conversation would be  entirely dispensed with, for with a sensitive galvanoscope attached to  the brain at a certain point, that was to be patented, the minutest  current of thought could be registered upon a cylinder.    Authors would only need to fix their attention upon the plot; the  delicate instrument would record it indelibly for their hearers'  gratification.    The well-appointed electric coupe was always ready. There was no worry  about oats and spavin and glanders. Miss Magnet told of many other new  contrivances that electricity had now to perform. The development of  this power through the new dynamos made it possible for men in Russell  to dispense utterly with work. You went so far as to put five cents in  the slot at any one of a hundred street corners, and your shoes were  electrically polished to a patent leather shine. There was no more  night, for carbon and incandescent lamps had stabbed the night so that  any hovel was brighter than the average day. The girl stopped for breath  and sat down. She was exhausted. Swift cheered her tenderly. But Mr.  Ticks dryly remarked:    \"_Better a city without electricity than electricity without a city!_\"    The girl smiled at this heresy, and nodded her head emphatically in a  feeble way. She could hardly move.    It was at this stage that Mr. Ticks seemed overcome with uneasiness. He  got up and sat down again. He kicked the earth. He examined the charred  sleepers. He dug for the lost rails. Then he awoke from his occupation  with a sudden start as if rudely shaken from a dream. Swift was used to  his colleague's idiosyncrasies. Besides he did not now notice them. He  was otherwise occupied. But the professor could stand these performances  no longer, and with rude emphasis he burst forth:    \"Dang it, man, if you've got anything on your darned mind, jerk it out,  if not--\" Professor Ariel's manners had become decadent in proportion to  the time that had elapsed since he and the _High Tariff_ had parted  company.    \"I--I--\" interrupted Mr. Ticks, with a start. \"The fact is, I cannot as  yet account for that deadly atmosphere that enveloped this section. What  was in it to kill? Its effect on me was unlike any other experience that  I can recall. It is my inconsolable regret that it is not classified in  my mind.\"    \"Did you know,\" asked Miss Magnet, suddenly, \"that a new land  improvement company was started this spring for raising four crops a  year? All the farms for twenty miles around were bought up. They spent  over a million dollars in laying wires in the ground throughout the  whole country, on the theory that these voltaic currents applied to  grain and fruit and vegetables would excite such crops to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33687"],[0,"Illustrative Anecdotes of the Animal Kingdom (#15)"],[1,"haunts of this species are the banks of  streams, where it inhabits holes near the water. It is an excellent  swimmer and diver, and feeds on frogs and fish. It also commits great  depredations in the poultry-yard. When provoked, it ejects a fetid  liquor, which is exceedingly unpleasant.      THE MARTEN.    Of this animal there are two or three species, confined to the northern  regions of the eastern continent. Of all the weasel tribe it is the  most pleasing; all its motions show great grace as well as agility; and  there is scarcely an animal in our woods that will venture to oppose  it. Quadrupeds five times as large are easily vanquished; the hare, the  sheep, and even the wild-cat itself, is not a match for it. We are told  of a marten which had been tamed, and was extremely pretty and playful  in its manners. It went among the houses of the neighborhood, and  always returned home when hungry. It was extremely fond of a dog that  had been bred with it, and used to play with it as cats are seen to  play, lying on its back, and biting without anger or injury.      THE SABLE.    This animal, as well as several others of the tribe, is greatly valued  for its fur. It resembles the marten, and is found in the northern  parts of both continents. The enterprise, perseverance, and hardships  of the hunters, in America as well as Siberia, in pursuit of this  creature, are almost incredible. In the latter country, the hunting of  the sable chiefly falls to the lot of condemned criminals, who are sent  from Russia into these wild and extensive forests, that for the  greatest part of the year are covered with snow; and in this instance,  as in many others, the luxuries and ornaments of the vain are wrought  out of the dangers and miseries of the wretched. These are obliged to  furnish a certain number of skins every year, and are punished if the  proper quantity is not provided.    The sable is also killed by the Russian soldiers, who are sent into  those parts for the purpose. They are taxed a certain number of skins  yearly, and are obliged to shoot with only a single ball, to avoid  spoiling the skin, or else with cross-bows and blunt arrows. As an  encouragement to the hunters, they are allowed to share among  themselves the surplus of those skins which they thus procure; and  this, in the process of six or seven years, amounts to a considerable  sum. A colonel, during his seven years' stay, gains about four thousand  crowns for his share, and the common men earn six or seven hundred  each.      THE SKUNK.    Of this animal there are several varieties upon the American continent,  to which it is confined; though we have but one in this quarter of the  United States. This is of the size of a cat, and striped with black and  white. Its celebrity depends exclusively upon its peculiar mode of  defence--that of discharging upon its foe a liquid of the most  revolting and intolerable odor, and of such vigor as to fill the air  for half a mile around.    Some years ago, a Frenchman, who had settled at Hartford, Connecticut,  was going home from Wethersfield, a place renowned for raising  _onions_. It was evening, and in the twilight the man saw a little  animal crossing the path before him. Not knowing or suspecting its  character, he darted upon it, caught it, and put it in his pocket. When  he reached home, he took it out, and a general exclamation of  astonishment burst from the household, at the extraordinary flavor of  the little beast. \"What is it?\" \"What can it be?\"--was the general  inquiry. \"I cannot say,\" said the Frenchman; \"but I suppose it must be  a _Wethersfield_ kitten!\"    On a certain occasion, Dr. B----, an eminent divine, was walking at  evening in a by-way, when he saw a small animal trotting along before  him. He easily guessed its true character, and having a volume of  Rees's Cyclopedia under his arm, he hurled it with all his might at the  suspicious quadruped. It took effect, but the animal retorted by  discharging, both upon the Cyclopedia and the D.D., a shaft from his  abominable quiver. It seems that the event made an indelible impression  both upon the garments and the memory of the divine; the former he  buried; and when, some years after, he was advised to write a book  against a rival sect, he replied, \"No, no!--I once threw a quarto at a  skunk, and got the worst of it. I shall not repeat such folly.\"    \"In the year 1749,\" says Kahn, \"one of these animals came near the farm  where I lived. It was in winter time, during the night; and the dogs  that were on watch pursued it for some time, until it discharged  against them. Although I was in a bed at some distance from the scene  of action, I thought I should have been suffocated, and the cows and  oxen, by their lowing, showed how much they were affected by the  stench.    \"About the end of the same year, another of these animals crept into  our cellar, but did not exhale the smallest scent when undisturbed. A  foolish woman, however, who perceived it one night by the shining of  its eyes, killed it, and at that moment the fetid odor began to spread.  The cellar was filled with it to such a degree that the woman kept her  bed for several days; and all the bread, meat, and other provisions  that were kept there, were so infected, that they were obliged to be  thrown out of doors.\"      THE OTTER.    The otter is a native of the greater part of Europe and America. Its  principal food being fish, it makes its habitation on the banks of  rivers, where it burrows to some depth.    _Anecdotes._--The females produce from four to five at a birth. Their  parental affection is so powerful, that they will frequently suffer  themselves to be killed rather than quit their progeny; and this has  frequently been the occasion of their losing their lives, when they  might, otherwise, have escaped. Professor Steller says, \"Often have I  spared the lives of the female otters, whose young ones I took away.  They expressed their sorrow by crying like human beings, and followed  me as I was carrying off their young ones, which called to them for  aid, with a tone of voice which very much resembled the wailing of  children. When I sat down in the snow, they came quite close to me, and  attempted to carry off their young. On one occasion, when I had  deprived an otter of her progeny, I returned to the place eight days  after, and found the female sitting by the river, listless and  desponding; she suffered me to kill her on the spot without making any  attempt to escape. On skinning her, I found she was quite wasted away,  from sorrow for the loss of her young. Another time I saw, at some  distance from me, an old female otter sleeping by the side of a young  one, about a year old. As soon as the mother perceived us, she awoke  the young one, and enticed him to betake himself to the river; but, as  he did not take the hint, and seemed inclined to prolong his sleep, she  took him up in her fore paws and plunged him into the water.\"    The otter is naturally ferocious; but when taken young, and properly  treated, it can be rendered tame, and taught to catch fish, and fetch  them to its master. James Campbell, near Inverness, procured a young  otter, which he brought up and domesticated. It would follow him  wherever he chose; and, if called on by its name, would immediately  obey. When apprehensive of danger from dogs, it sought the protection  of its master, and would endeavor to spring into his arms for greater  security. It was frequently employed in catching fish, and would  sometimes take eight or ten salmon in a day. If not prevented, it  always made an attempt to break the fish behind the anal fin, which is  next the tail; and, as soon as one was taken away, it always dived in  pursuit of more. It was equally dexterous at sea-fishing, and took  great numbers of young cod, and other fish, there. When tired, it would  refuse to fish any longer, and was then rewarded with as much as it  could devour. Having satisfied its appetite, it always coiled itself  round, and fell asleep; in which state it was generally carried home.    It appears that the otter, in its native haunts, is of a playful and  sportive humor. We are told that, on the banks of the northern rivers,  where they dwell unmolested, they may be sometimes seen sliding down  the soft, muddy banks into the water, like a parcel of boys coasting  upon the snow. They become quite animated with the sport, seeming to  emulate each other in the vigor and frolic of their performances.    The sea otter is a larger species, living in pairs along the northern  shores of the Pacific Ocean.      THE DOG.    The dog, in its wild state, differs little in its habits from those of  the same order of quadrupeds; it resembles the wolf rather than the  fox, hunts in troops, and, thus associated, attacks the most formidable  animals--wild boars, tigers, and even lions. They are said, however,  even while in this condition, to exhibit a disposition to yield to man;  and, if approached by him with gentleness, will submit to be caressed.  On the other hand, if dogs that have been once tamed are driven from  the haunts of men, and the protection to which they have been  accustomed, they readily become wild, and associate together in troops.  In Asia, there are multitudes of these animals around the towns, which  live in a half-wild state, calling no man master.    But when domesticated, the dog presents the appearance of the most  thorough submission to the will, and subservience to the use of man. If  we look at the individual, we perceive it attached to a person whom it  acknowledges as master, with whom it has formed a very humble alliance,  and whose interest it considers its own. It answers to its name, is  willing to follow its master wherever he goes, and exerts all its  energies in any service to which he may command it, and that without  any constraint except what arises from its own disposition.
