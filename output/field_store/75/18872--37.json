A narrow causeway connects with the  gate, where blacks on guard lounge in fantastic uniform, and  below the works are the coal-sheds. Here the first turf was  lately turned by an English commodore--this tramway was intended  to connect with the water edge, and eventually to reach the  Cuanza at Calumbo. So Portugal began the rail system in West  Africa.    The city was preparing for her ecclesiastical festival, and I  went ashore at once to see her at her best. The landing-place is  poor and mean, and the dusty and sandy walk is garnished with a  single row of that funereal shrub, the milky euphorbia. The first  sensation came from the pillars of an unfinished house--              \"Care colonne, che fate quà?             --Non sappiamo in verità!\"    The Ponta de Isabel showed the passeio, or promenade, with two  brick ruins: its \"five hundred fruit-trees of various  descriptions\" have gone the way of the camphor, the tea-shrub,  and the incense-tree, said to have been introduced by the  Jesuits. \"The five pleasant walks, of which the central one has  nine terraces, with a pyramid at each extremity, and leads to the  Casa de Recreio, or pleasure-house of the governor-general,  erected in 1817 by Governor Vice-Admiral Luiz da Motta Feio,\"  have insensibly faded away; the land is a waste, poor grazing  ground for cattle landed from the south coast, whilst negrokins  scream and splash in the adjoining sea.    Beyond the Government gardens appears the old Ermida (chapel), Na  Sa. da Nazareth, which English writers have dubbed, after  Madeiran fashion, the Convent. The frontage is mean as that of  colonial ecclesiastical buildings in general, and even the  epauletted façades of old São Paulo do not deserve a description.  Here, according to local tradition, was buried the head of the  \"intrepid and arrogant king of Congo,\" Dom Antonio, whose 100,000  warriors were defeated at Ambuilla (Jan. ist, 1666) by Captain  Luiz Lopes de Sequeira, the good soldier who lost his life, by a  Portuguese hand, at the battle of Matamba (Sept. 4th, 1681). A  picture in Dutch tiles (azulejos) was placed on the right side of  the altar to commemorate the feat.    After the Ermida are more ruined houses and ragged plantations  upon the narrow shelf between the sea-cliff and the sea: they  lead to the hot and unhealthy low town skirting the harbour, a  single street with small offsets. A sandy strip spotted with  cocoa-nuts, represents the Praia do Bungo (Bungo Beach), perhaps  corrupted from Bunghi, a praça, or square; it debouches upon the  Quitanda Pequena, a succursale market-place, where, on working-  days, cloth and beads, dried peppers, and watered rum are sold.  Then come a single large building containing the Trem, or  arsenal, the cavalry barracks, the \"central post-office,\" and the  alfandega, or custom-house, which has a poor platform, but no  pier. The stables lodge some half-a-dozen horses used by mounted  orderlies--they thrive, and, to judge from their high spirits,  the climate suits them. In Captain Owen's time (A.D. 1826) there  was \"a respectable corps of cavalry.\"    Passing the acting cathedral for the See of Angola and Congo,  which deserves no notice, you reach the Quitanda Grande, where  business is brisker. There is a sufficiency of beef and mutton,  the latter being thin-tailed, and not \"five-quartered.\" Fish is  wisely preferred to meat by the white man, \"affirming that it is  much easier digested;\" and a kind of herring, and the sparus  known upon the Brazilian coast as the \"tainha,\" the West African  \"vela,\" and the French \"mulet,\" at times superabound. All the  tropical fruits flourish, especially the orange; the exotic  vegetables are large and sightly, but tasteless and insipid,  especially peas and radishes: the indigenous, as tomatoes, are  excellent, but the list is small. Gardens are rare where the soil  is so thin, and the indispensable irrigation costs money. The  people still \"choke for want of water,\" which must be bought:  there is only one good well sunk in the upper town, about 1840,  when the Conde de Bomfim was Minister of Marine and the  Colonies,--it is a preserve for government officials. Living in  the native style is cheap; but cooks are hardly procurable, and a  decent table is more expensive than in an English country town. A  single store (M. Schutz) supplies \"Europe\" articles, of course at  fancy prices, and here a travelling outfit may be bought. It has  been remarked that Loanda has no shop that sells \"food for the  mind;\" this is applicable, not only to all East and West Africa,  but to places far more progressive. A kind of cafe-billard  supplies a lounge and tepid beer. The attendants in Portuguese  houses are slaves; the few English prefer Cabindas, a rude form  of the rude Kru-boy, and the lowest pay of the lowest labourer is  5d. per diem.    The \"Calçada Nova,\" a fine old paved \"ramp\"--to speak Gibraltar-  English--connects Basse Ville and Hauteville. The latter was once  a scatter of huge if not magnificent buildings, now in ruins; we  shall pass through it en route to Calumbo. Here are the remains  of the three chief convents, the Jesuit, the Carmelite, and the  Third Order of St. Francis. The citadel de São Miguel, lately  blown up, has been restored; the extensive works of dressed  freestone, carefully whitewashed, stand out conspicuously from  the dark bush dotting the escarpment top. Here also is the Alto  das Cruzes, the great cemetery, and the view from the sheer and  far-jutting headland is admirable. A stroll over this cool and  comparatively healthy escarpment ended by leaving a card at the  Paço do Governo.    Lopes de Lima (vol. iii. part ii.) gives São Paulo in 1846 a  total of 5,065 whites, mulattoes, and blacks, distributed into  1,176 hearths; the census of 1850-51 raised the number to 12,000,  including 7,000 negroes, of whom 5,000 were serviles; in 1863 the  figure was understood to have diminished rather than to have  increased. Old authors divided the population into five orders.  The first was of ecclesiastics, the second contained those who  were settled for command or trade, and the third were convicts,  especially new Christians of Jewish blood, who were prevented  from attending the sacred functions for a scandalous reason. Then  ranked the Pomberos, or Pombeiros, mostly mulattoes, free men,  and buyers of slaves; their morals seem to have been abominable.  Last and least were the natives, that is, the \"chattels.\" Amongst  the latter the men changed wives for a time, \"alleging, in case  of reproof, that they are not able to eat always of the same  dish;\" and the women were rarely allowed by their mistresses to  marry--with the usual results. The missionaries are very severe  upon the higher ranks of colonists. Father Carli (A.D. 1666)  found the whites the most deceitful and the wickedest of men,--an  effect caused by the penal settlement. Father Merolla (A.D. 1682)  declares that \"the women, being bred among blacks, suffer  themselves to be much perverted--they scarcely retain anything  white about them except their skins.\" J. C. Fêo Cardoso (Memoir  published in Paris in 1825) attributes the decadence of Angola  and Benguela to three reasons; rare marriages amongst the higher  orders; poverty amongst the lower; and the immorality and  incontinence of both. Lopes de Lima (p. 149 loc. cit.) traces the  decline and fall of Christianity in the eighteenth century to the  want of priests, to the corruption of the regular clergy  (Carmelites and Franciscans), for whom West Africa, like Syria  and Palestine, was made a kind of convict station, and to the  inhuman slave-export, as opposed to domestic slavery. All has now  changed for the better; society in Angola is not a whit inferior  to that of any English colony in West Africa, and, as a convict  establishment, Loanda is a great success.    The theoretical garrison is one regiment of the line, a squadron  of cavalry, and two companies of artillery with three-pounders;  the real force is of some 800 men, mostly convicts. No difference  is made between white and black, nor is the corps force, which  was once very cruelly used, severely treated as the Légion  Etrangère of Algeria. Most of the men have been found guilty of  capital crimes, yet they are allowed to carry arms, and they are  intrusted with charge of the forts. Violence is almost unheard of  amongst them: if an English sailor be stabbed, it is generally by  the free mulattoes and blacks, who hate the uniform for  destroying their pet trade of man-selling. It is true that these  convicts have hopes of pardon, but I prefer to attribute their  remarkable gentleness and good behaviour to the effects of the  first fever, which, to quote from the Latin grammar,              \"Emollit mores nec sinit esse feros.\"    The negroes of Loanda struck me as unusually ill-favoured; short,  \"stumpy,\" and very dark, or tinged with unclean yellow. Lepers  and hideous cripples thrust their sores and stumps in the face of  charity. There was no local colouring compared with the  carregadores, or coolies, from the northeast, whose thrum-mop  heads and single monkey skins for fig-leaves, spoke of the wold  and the wild. The body-dress of both sexes is the tángá, pagne,  or waist-cloth, unless the men can afford trousers and ragged  shirts, and the women a \"veo preto,\" or dingy black sheet,  ungracefully worn, like the graceful sárí of Hindostan, over the  bright foulard which confines the wool. \"It is mighty ridiculous  to observe,\" says the old missionary, \"that the women, contrary  to the custom of all other nations, buy and sell, and do all  things which the men ought to do, whilst their husbands stay at  home and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5762"],[0,"Grammar and Vocabulary of the Lau Language, Solomon Islands (#4)"],[1,"asa_: _na boso nia baita fasia na asufe_ a pig is larger than  a rat; _gera baita tasa agera_ these are much larger than those.    The adverbs employed are _gele_ little, somewhat, _asia_ very, too  much: _nia baita asia_ it is very (too) large.    A positive statement carries comparison by implication: _doo ne nia  baita_ that is biggest, _sai ai ne ni diena, sai ai nena ni taa na_  this is good, that is bad; i.e., this is better than that.      VERBS.    Almost any word may be used as a verb by prefixing the verbal  particles, but some words are naturally verbs as being the names of  actions and not of things. There are also verbs which have special  forms as such by means of a prefix or termination. Verbal particles  precede the verb; they have a temporal force.    1. The verbal particles are _ka_, _ko_. The particles are written  apart from the verb, but the speakers like to join them to the  governing pronouns of the first and second persons singular, _gu_,  _o_.    _Ka_ is used both of present and of future time: _nia ka bae uri_ he  speaks thus, _ka urina_ if that be so, _tasi doo taa gera ka odea_  what will they do? _lelea ka rodo_ go till nightfall; the illatives  _fi_, _fe_, may be added.    _Ko_ is used only with the personal pronoun, second singular _o_,  and may express either present or future time: the illative may be  added.    The preposition _fuana_ to him, to it, in order that, is used as a  subjunctive or optative.    2. Time and Moods: A subjunctive is formed by _ana_ if, when,  followed by the particle _ka_, or by the use of _saea_.    Conditional affirmation is expressed by _saumala_.    The illatives are _fi_ and _fe_, and mean, then, in that case,  following upon, just now, for the first time: _ta ka fi uri_ then  said he, _gami mifi saitamana na tala uta_ and how shall we know the  way?    _Fe_ as an illative denotes, in that case, following upon; _fe_ is  also used like _ha'i_ in Sa'a, to denote repetition or continuance  or restoration: _na abana e fe boeboela lau_ his hand was restored  whole again, _gera ka fe dao toona_ they will certainly reach him,  _daro fe lea lau_ go they went on again, _da tefe bae ana tesi  baela_ they all cried out together.    _Na_ is used following the verb to form a preterit: _nia mae na_ he  is dead. Finality is shown by the use of _sui_: _sui na_ it is all  finished, _nia kafi dao sui na_ when he shall have arrived, _sui  nana_ it is finished, _sui ta_ thereupon, after that.    For the imperative the simple verb is used: _o lea amu_ go away;  _fasi_ may be added for politeness: _lea fasi amu_ you go!    3. Negative Particles: The foregoing particles are not used in  negative sentences. The negative particles are _langi_, _e langi_,  _si_. These may be combined: _nia langi si saea_ he does not know  it, _e langi mu si rongoa ma e langi mu si saea_ you have neither  heard it nor seen it, _e langi nau gu si lea_ I am not going, _e  langi uri ta ai e adasia_ no one has seen it, _e langi asia_ not at  all. The verbal particle _ka_ may be used in negative sentences with  the addition of _si_, _kasi bobola_ it is not fitting. The  dehortative and the negative imperative is _fasia_: _fasia oko lea_  do not go! _fasia gera ka adasia_ let them not see it, _o fasia oko  luia_ do not forbid it.    Genitives: _ni_, _i_ are used to express purpose.    4. Suffixes to verbs: There are certain terminations which, when  added to neuter verbs or to verbs active only in a general way, make  them definitely transitive or determine their action upon some  object. These are of two forms:    a. A consonant with _i_: _fi_, _li_, _mi_, _ni_, _ngi_, _si_, or _i_  by itself; e.g. _tau_, _taufi_; _mae_, _maeli_: _ano_, _anomi_;  _mou_, _mouni_; _sau_, _saungi_; _ada_, _adasi_; _manatat_,  _manatai_; to the verb _taa_ to be bad, both _si_ and _li_ are added  and the causative _fa_ is prefixed: _fataasi_, _fataali_, to make  worse. Certain verbs which are active in Lau are neuter in Sa'a:  _angai_ to lift, _angaia_ lift it, Sa'a _angainia_; _faodo_ to  straighten, _faodoa_ straighten it, Sa'a _ha'aodohie_; _famae_ to  kill, _famaea_, Sa'a _ha'amaesie_; _famou_ to frighten, _famoua_,  Sa'a _ ha'ama'usie_.    b. The termination _ai_ is suffixed by itself to nouns to convert  them into verbs, _sato_, _satoai_. When this syllable _ai_ is  suffixed to verbs the genitive _ni_ may be added, and to the form  _aini_ the consonants f, m, ng, t, are prefixed: _oli_ to return,  _olifaini_ to carry back, _ala_ to answer, _alamaini_ to consent,  _sau_ to become, _saungaini_ to make, _tagala_ lost, _tagalangaini_  to drive out, _foaa_ to pray, _foaataini_ to pray for. The forms in  _ai_ are also used intransitively: _tege_ to fall, _tegelai_ lost,  _oli_ to turn, _olitai_ converted.    The genitive _ni_ (cf. M. L., p. 532) is often omitted and is not  invariably used as it is in Sa'a, since the form _ai_ without the  addition of _ni_ is transitive: _gonitai_ to receive, _gwoutai_ or  _gwoutaini_ to be left alone, _oalangai_ to apportion, _fatolamai_  to command.    _Ani_ appears to be used by itself as a transitive suffix: _ui_ to  throw, _uiani_ to throw away, _laga_ to drive, _lagaani_ to drive  away, _taba_ to strike, _tabaani_ to destroy; _ani_ is used also  with _too_ to hit, _tooani_ to understand.    With either class of suffixes there is no difference in meaning  between one suffix and another.    5. Prefixes to verbs: These are causative and reciprocal.    The causative is _fa_: it may be prefixed to almost any word, and it  may be used with words which have a transitive suffix. The use of  _fa_ frequently obviates the use of a transitive suffix and of  itself makes verbs transitive.    The reciprocal is _qai_: generally when _qai_ is prefixed to a verb  the action of the verb is enlarged and the subject is included. The  illative _fe_ also marks repetition or restoration or continuance;  it is followed by the adverb _lau_ again: _na abana e fe boeboela  lau_ his hand was restored whole.    6. Passive: The passive is expressed by the use of the personal  pronoun plural third _gera_ or _da_, with the verb and the adverb  _na_ already: _gera taufia na_ it has been washed; _gera_ and _da_  are used impersonally. The word _saetana_ it is said, _sae_ to say,  is used as a passive: _se doo saetana_ the thing said, _si baela ne  saetana uri_ the word which was said.    7. Auxiliary verbs: _Alu_ to put, is used as meaning, to be, to  become; _talae_, v. tr. to begin, means also to become; _sau_ to  make, with the possessive _ana, sau ana_ to become.    8. Reflexive verb: The word _mara_ with suffixed pronoun is used to  denote reflexive action: _nia saungia marana_.  It also carries the  meaning self, of one's own accord: _i bobongi ka manata tetea ana  marana_ the morrow can take care of itself.    9. Reduplication: Verbs are reduplicated in two ways: (a) by  reduplication of the first syllable: _liu_, _liliu_; _bae_, _babae_;  (b) by repetition of the whole word: _gwou_, _gwougwou_.  There is  no difference between the various forms beyond an intensification in  meaning. In the vocabulary the reduplicated form is presented under  the entry of the stem.      ADVERBS.    There are pure adverbs in Lau, but many words used as adverbs are  truly nouns and others are verbs; adjectives may also occur in this  employment.    1. Adverbs of place: _mai_ here, hither; go there, thither, _ne_ may  be added, gone, also _langi_ go, no. _Lo_ there, is compounded with  _go_ and _gi_, _logo_ north, west; _se_ here, a noun, _i se_,  _isena_, here, in this place, _gula_ place, a noun: _si gula na_  this place, here, _gula i maa_ outside. _bali_ side, a noun, _bali  ne_ here, on this side; _i bali jordan i bali logo_ on the far side  of Jordan; _ifai_ where, _gamu mai ifai_ whence are you? _tau_, a  verb, far off: _alaa_ up, south, east, _ilangi_, _ifafo_, up.    2. Adverbs of time: _kada na_ (_ne_), _manga na_, now; _si manga,  kademanga_, when, _i kademanga na_ (_ne_), at the time when; _i  angita, si manga uta_, when? _inao_ of old, in the past; _ua mai  inao_ from of old; _isingana ne_ henceforth: _alua fasi_, _taraina_,  presently; _urii_ just now; _lau, _lau go_, again; _oli_ back; _na_,  _ua na_, already; _ua_ yet, still, still left; _ua go i uarodo_  while still dark in the early morning; _ua mai ana lua_ from the  flood, _toongi ua inao_ old clothes, _e langi ua_ not yet, still  wanting; _firi_, _tefou_, always; _too ka tau_ forever; _suli  dangifiri_ daily; _taraina_ to-day; _i rogi_ yesterday; _maaedangi i  fafo_ day before yesterday; _bobongi_ to-morrow; _taraina lao rodo_  to-night; _talae_ first; _loulou_ quick; _aliali_ forthwith;  _maasia_, _kade manga_, while.    3. Adverbs of manner: _alafana_ as, like, as if; _uri_, _uria_,  _sae_, _saea_, that (of quotation); _uri_, _urina_, thus; _e uta_  how?  _gele_ somewhat; _asia_ completely, too much; _saumala_  granted that; _falaete, mamaloni_, only; _ooni_ merely; _talai_ for  no reason; _tefou_ together; _afui_ altogether (precedes verb);  _boro_, _oto_, _otomone_, _tamone_, _bota ana_, perhaps; _mone_  gives life, _ba_ gives force, to the narrative; _ba_ also explains  and makes the diction less abrupt; _tasa_, _tasaana_, too much;  _faoroa_ often.      PREPOSITIONS.    1. Simple prepositions.    Locative, _i_.      Motion to, _fua_, _isuli_, _suli_.      Motion from, _fasi_, _ita_.      Causation, _fafi_.      Position, _fonosi_.    Dative, _fua_.      Instrumental, _ana_, _ani_.      Relation, _ana_, _ani_, _fai_, _sai_, _usi_.      Gentive, _ni_, _i_.    The locative _i_ is seen in _ifai_ where; it is also largely used  with adverbs of place and time and it precedes every name of place.  With the exception of the locative, the instrumental, the genitive,  and also _ana_, _ita_, _usi_, all the foregoing prepositions are  used with a suffixed pronoun; _ita_ is used with the possessive.    _Isuli_ denotes motion after, motion over: _sulia rodo"]]]
