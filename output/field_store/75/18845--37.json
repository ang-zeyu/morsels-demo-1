THE VICAR.    WHERE ends our chancel in a vaulted space,  Sleep the departed Vicars of the place;  Of most, all mention, memory, thought are past -  But take a slight memorial of the last.     To what famed college we our Yicar owe,  To what fair county, let historians show:  Few now remember when the mild young man,  Ruddy and fair, his Sunday-task began;  Few live to speak of that soft soothing look  He cast around, as he prepared his book;  It was a kind of supplicating smile,  But nothing hopeless of applause the while;  And when he finished, his corrected pride  Felt the desert, and yet the praise denied.  Thus he his race began, and to the end  His constant care was, no man to offend;  No haughty virtues stirr'd his peaceful mind;  Nor urged the Priest to leave the Flock behind;  He was his Master's Soldier, but not one  To lead an army of his Martyrs on:  Fear was his ruling passion; yet was Love,  Of timid kind, once known his heart to move;  It led his patient spirit where it paid  Its languid offerings to a listening Maid:  She, with her widow'd Mother, heard him speak,  And sought awhile to find what he would seek:  Smiling he came, he smiled when he withdrew,  And paid the same attention to the two;  Meeting and parting without joy or pain,  He seem'd to come that he might go again.     The wondering girl, no prude, but something nice,  At length was chill'd by his unmelting ice;  She found her tortoise held such sluggish pace,  That she must turn and meet him in the chase:  This not approving, she withdrew, till one  Came who appear'd with livelier hope to run;  Who sought a readier way the heart to move,  Than by faint dalliance of unfixing love.     Accuse me not that I approving paint  Impatient Hope or Love without restraint;  Or think the Passions, a tumultuous throng,  Strong as they are, ungovernably strong:  But is the laurel to the soldier due,  Who, cautious, comes not into danger's view?  What worth has Virtue by Desire untried,  When Nature's self enlists on Duty's side?     The married dame in vain assail'd the truth  And guarded bosom of the Hebrew youth;  But with the daughter of the Priest of On  The love was lawful, and the guard was gone;  But Joseph's fame had lessened in our view,  Had he, refusing, fled the maiden too.     Yet our good priest to Joseph's praise aspired,  As once rejecting what his heart desired;  \"I am escaped,\" he said, when none pursued;  When none attack'd him, \"I am unsubdued;\"  \"Oh pleasing pangs of love!\" he sang again,  Cold to the joy, and stranger to the pain.  E'en in his age would he address the young,  \"I too have felt these fires, and they are strong;\"  But from the time he left his favourite maid,  To ancient females his devoirs were paid:  And still they miss him after Morning-prayer;  Nor yet successor fills the Vicar's chair,  Where kindred spirits in his praise agree,  A happy few, as mild and cool as he;  The easy followers in the female train,  Led without love, and captives without chain.     Ye Lilies male! think (as your tea you sip,  While the town small-talk flows from lip to lip;  Intrigues half-gather'd, conversation-scraps,  Kitchen cabals, and nursery-mishaps),  If the vast world may not some scene produce,  Some state where your small talents might have use;  Within seraglios you might harmless move,  'Mid ranks of beauty, and in haunts of love;  There from too daring man the treasures guard,  An easy duty, and its own reward;  Nature's soft substitutes, you there might save  From crime the tyrant, and from wrong the slave.     But let applause be dealt in all we may,  Our Priest was cheerful, and in season gay;  His frequent visits seldom fail'd to please;  Easy himself, he sought his neighbour's ease:  To a small garden with delight he came,  And gave successive flowers a summer's fame;  These he presented, with a grace his own,  To his fair friends, and made their beauties known,  Not without moral compliment; how they  \"Like flowers were sweet, and must like flowers decay.'     Simple he was, and loved the simple truth,  Yet had some useful cunning from his youth;  A cunning never to dishonour lent,  And rather for defence than conquest meant;  'Twas fear of power, with some desire to rise,  But not enough to make him enemies;  He ever aim'd to please; and to offend  Was ever cautious; for he sought a friend;  Yet for the friendship never much would pay,  Content to bow, be silent, and obey,  And by a soothing suff'rance find his way.     Fiddling and fishing were his arts:  at times  He alter'd sermons, and he aim'd at rhymes;  And his fair friends, not yet intent on cards,  Oft he amused with riddles and charades.  Mild were his doctrines, and not one discourse  But gain'd in softness what it lost in force:  Kind his opinions; he would not receive  An ill report, nor evil act believe;  \"If true, 'twas wrong; but blemish great or small  Have all mankind; yea, sinners are we all.\"     If ever fretful thought disturb'd his breast,  If aught of gloom that cheerful mind oppress'd,  It sprang from innovation; it was then  He spake of mischief made by restless men:  Not by new doctrines:  never in his life  Would he attend to controversial strife;  For sects he cared not; \" They are not of us,  Nor need we, brethren, their concerns discuss;  But 'tis the change, the schism at home I feel;  Ills few perceive, and none have skill to heal:  Not at the altar our young brethren read  (Facing their flock) the decalogue and creed;  But at their duty, in their desks they stand,  With naked surplice, lacking hood and band:  Churches are now of holy song bereft,  And half our ancient customs changed or left;  Few sprigs of ivy are at Christmas seen,  Nor crimson berry tips the holly's green;  Mistaken choirs refuse the solemn strain  Of ancient Sternhold, which from ours amain  Comes flying forth from aisle to aisle about,  Sweet links of harmony and long drawn out.\"     These were to him essentials; all things new  He deemed superfluous, useless, or untrue:  To all beside indifferent, easy, cold,  Here the fire kindled, and the woe was told.     Habit with him was all the test of truth:  \"It must be right:  I've done it from my youth.\"  Questions he answer'd in as brief a way:  \"It must be wrong--it was of yesterday.\"     Though mild benevolence our Priest possess'd,  'Twas but by wishes or by words expressed.  Circles in water, as they wider flow,  The less conspicuous in their progress grow,  And when at last they touch upon the shore,  Distinction ceases, and they're view'd no more.  His love, like that last circle, all embraced,  But with effect that never could be traced.     Now rests our Vicar. They who knew him best,  Proclaim his life t'have been entirely rest;  Free from all evils which disturb his mind  Whom studies vex and controversies blind.     The rich approved,--of them in awe he stood;  The poor admired,--they all believed him good;  The old and serious of his habits spoke;  The frank and youthful loved his pleasant joke;  Mothers approved a safe contented guest,  And daughters one who back'd each small request;  In him his flock found nothing to condemn;  Him sectaries liked,--he never troubled them:  No trifles fail'd his yielding mind to please,  And all his passions sunk in early ease;  Nor one so old has left this world of sin,  More like the being that he entered in.    THE CURATE.    ASK you what lands our Pastor tithes?--Alas!  But few our acres, and but short our grass:  In some fat pastures of the rich, indeed,  May roll the single cow or favourite steed;  Who, stable-fed, is here for pleasure seen,  His sleek sides bathing in the dewy green;  But these, our hilly heath and common wide  Yield a slight portion for the parish-guide;  No crops luxuriant in our borders stand,  For here we plough the ocean, not the land;  Still reason wills that we our Pastor pay,  And custom does it on a certain day:  Much is the duty, small the legal due,  And this with grateful minds we keep in view;  Each makes his off'ring, some by habit led,  Some by the thought that all men must be fed;  Duty and love, and piety and pride,  Have each their force, and for the Priest provide.     Not thus our Curate, one whom all believe  Pious and just, and for whose fate they grieve;  All see him poor, but e'en the vulgar know  He merits love, and their respect bestow.  A man so learn'd you shall but seldom see,  Nor one so honour'd, so aggrieved as he; -  Not grieved by years alone; though his appear  Dark and more dark; severer on severe:  Not in his need,--and yet we all must grant  How painful 'tis for feeling Age to want:  Nor in his body's sufferings; yet we know  Where Time has ploughed, there Misery loves to sow;  But in the wearied mind, that all in vain  Wars with distress, and struggles with its pain.     His father saw his powers--\"I give,\" quoth he,  \"My first-born learning; 'twill a portion be:\"  Unhappy gift! a portion for a son!  But all he had: --he learn'd, and was undone!     Better, apprenticed to an humble trade,  Had he the cassock for the priesthood made,  Or thrown the shuttle, or the saddle shaped,  And all these pangs of feeling souls escaped.  He once had hope--Hope, ardent, lively, light;  His feelings pleasant, and his prospects bright:  Eager of fame, he read, he thought, he wrote,  Weigh'd the Greek page, and added note on note.  At morn, at evening, at his work was he,  And dream'd what his Euripides would be.     Then care began: --he loved, he woo'd, he wed;  Hope cheer'd him still, and Hymen bless'd his bed -  A curate's bed ! then came the woeful years;  The husband's terrors, and the father's tears;  A wife grown feeble, mourning, pining, vex'd  With wants and woes--by daily cares perplex'd;  No more a help, a smiling, soothing aid,  But boding, drooping,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5225"],[0,"The Satyricon — Complete (#4)"],[1,"which are too often such to  themselves.  But) are our rhetoricians tormented by another species of  Furies when they cry, \"I received these wounds while fighting for the  public liberty; I lost this eye in your defense: give me a guide who will  lead me to my children, my limbs are hamstrung and will not hold me up!\"  Even these heroics could be endured if they made easier the road to  eloquence; but as it is, their sole gain from this ferment of matter and  empty discord of words is, that when they step into the Forum, they think  they have been carried into another world.  And it is my conviction that  the schools are responsible for the gross foolishness of our young men,  because, in them, they see or hear nothing at all of the affairs of  every-day life, but only pirates standing in chains upon the shore,  tyrants scribbling edicts in which sons are ordered to behead their own  fathers; responses from oracles, delivered in time of pestilence,  ordering the immolation of three or more virgins; every word a honied  drop, every period sprinkled with poppy-seed and sesame.          CHAPTER THE SECOND.    Those who are brought up on such a diet can no more attain to wisdom than  a kitchen scullion can attain to a keen sense of smell or avoid stinking  of the grease.  With your indulgence, I will speak out: you--teachers  --are chiefly responsible for the decay of oratory.  With your well  modulated and empty tones you have so labored for rhetorical effect that  the body of your speech has lost its vigor and died.  Young men did not  learn set speeches in the days when Sophocles and Euripides were  searching for words in which to express themselves.  In the days when  Pindar and the nine lyric poets feared to attempt Homeric verse there was  no private tutor to stifle budding genius.  I need not cite the poets for  evidence, for I do not find that either Plato or Demosthenes was given  to this kind of exercise.  A dignified and, if I may say it, a chaste,  style, is neither elaborate nor loaded with ornament; it rises supreme by  its own natural purity.  This windy and high-sounding bombast, a recent  immigrant to Athens, from Asia, touched with its breath the aspiring  minds of youth, with the effect of some pestilential planet, and as soon  as the tradition of the past was broken, eloquence halted and was  stricken dumb.  Since that, who has attained to the sublimity of  Thucydides, who rivalled the fame of Hyperides?  Not a single poem  has glowed with a healthy color, but all of them, as though nourished  on the same diet, lacked the strength to live to old age.  Painting  also suffered the same fate when the presumption of the Egyptians  \"commercialized\" that incomparable art.  (I was holding forth along these  lines one day, when Agamemnon came up to us and scanned with a curious  eye a person to whom the audience was listening so closely.)          CHAPTER THE THIRD.    He would not permit me to declaim longer in the portico than he himself  had sweat in the school, but exclaimed, \"Your sentiments do not reflect  the public taste, young man, and you are a lover of common sense, which  is still more unusual.  For that reason, I will not deceive you as to the  secrets of my profession.  The teachers, who must gibber with lunatics,  are by no means to blame for these exercises.  Unless they spoke in  accordance with the dictates of their young pupils, they would, as Cicero  remarks, be left alone in the schools!  And, as designing parasites, when  they seek invitations to the tables of the rich, have in mind nothing  except what will, in their opinion, be most acceptable to their audience  --for in no other way can they secure their ends, save by setting snares  for the ears--so it is with the teachers of rhetoric, they might be  compared with the fisherman, who, unless he baits his hook with what he  knows is most appetizing to the little fish, may wait all day upon some  rock, without the hope of a catch.\"          CHAPTER THE FOURTH.    What, then, is there to do?  The parents who are unwilling to permit  their children to undergo a course of training under strict discipline,  are the ones who deserve the reproof.  In the first place, everything  they possess, including the children, is devoted to ambition.  Then, that  their wishes may the more quickly be realized, they drive these unripe  scholars into the forum, and the profession of eloquence, than which none  is considered nobler, devolves upon boys who are still in the act of  being born!  If, however, they would permit a graded course of study to  be prescribed, in order that studious boys might ripen their minds by  diligent reading; balance their judgment by precepts of wisdom, correct  their compositions with an unsparing pen, hear at length what they ought  to imitate, and be convinced that nothing can be sublime when it is  designed to catch the fancy of boys, then the grand style of oratory  would immediately recover the weight and splendor of its majesty.  Now  the boys play in the schools, the young men are laughed at in the forum,  and, a worse symptom than either, no one, in his old age, will confess  the errors he was taught in his school days.  But that you may not  imagine that I disapprove of a jingle in the Lucilian manner, I will  deliver my opinions in verse,--          CHAPTER THE FIFTH.        \"The man who emerges with fame, from the school of stern art,         Whose mind gropes for lofty ideals, to bring them to light,         Must first, under rigid frugality, study his part;         Nor yearn for the courts of proud princes who frown in their might:         Nor scheme with the riff-raf, a client in order to dine,         Nor can he with evil companions his wit drown in wine         Nor sit, as a hireling, applauding an actor's grimace.         But, whether the fortress of arms-bearing Tritonis smile         Upon him, or land which the Spartan colonials grace,         Or home of the sirens, with poetry let him beguile         The years of young manhood, and at the Maeonian spring         His fortunate soul drink its fill: Then, when later, the lore         Of Socrates' school he has mastered, the reins let him fling,         And brandish the weapons that mighty Demosthenes bore.         Then, steeped in the culture and music of Greece, let his taste         Be ripened and mellowed by all the great writers of Rome.         At first, let him haunt not the courts; let his pages be graced         By ringing and rhythmic effusions composed in his home         Next, banquets and wars be his theme, sung in soul-stirring chant,         In eloquent words such as undaunted Cicero chose.         Come!  Gird up thy soul!  Inspiration will then force a vent         And rush in a flood from a heart that is loved by the muse!\"          CHAPTER THE SIXTH.    I was listening so attentively to this speech that I did not notice the  flight of Ascyltos, and while I was pacing the gardens, engulfed in this  flood-tide of rhetoric, a large crowd of students came out upon the  portico, having, it would seem, just listened to an extemporaneous  declamation, of I know not whom, the speaker of which had taken  exceptions to the speech of Agamemnon.  While, therefore, the young men  were making fun of the sentiments of this last speaker, and criticizing  the arrangement of the whole speech, I seized the opportunity and went  after Ascyltos, on the run; but, as I neither held strictly to the road,  nor knew where the inn was located, wherever I went, I kept coming back  to the same place, until, worn out with running, and long since dripping  with sweat, I approached a certain little old woman who sold country  vegetables.          CHAPTER THE SEVENTH.    \"Please, mother,\" I wheedled, \"you don't know where I lodge, do you?\"  Delighted with such humorous affability, \"What's the reason I don't\" she  replied, and getting upon her feet, she commenced to walk ahead of me.  I  took her for a prophetess until, when presently we came to a more obscure  quarter, the affable old lady pushed aside a crazy-quilt and remarked,  \"Here's where you ought to live,\" and when I denied that I recognized the  house, I saw some men prowling stealthily between the rows of name-boards  and naked prostitutes.  Too late I realized that I had been led into a  brothel.  After cursing the wiles of the little old hag, I covered my  head and commenced to run through the middle of the night-house to the  exit opposite, when, lo and behold! whom should I meet on the very  threshold but Ascyltos himself, as tired as I was, and almost dead; you  would have thought that he had been brought by the self-same little old  hag!  I smiled at that, greeted him cordially, and asked him what he was  doing in such a scandalous place.          CHAPTER THE EIGHTH.    Wiping away the sweat with his hands, he replied, \"If you only knew what  I have gone through!\"  \"What was it?\"  I demanded.  \"A most respectable  looking person came up to me,\" he made reply, \"while I was wandering all  over the town and could not find where I had left my inn, and very  graciously offered to guide me.  He led me through some very dark and  crooked alleys, to this place, pulled out his tool, and commenced to beg  me to comply with his appetite.  A whore had already vacated her cell for  an as, and he had laid hands upon me, and, but for the fact that I was  the stronger, I would have been compelled to take my medicine.\"  (While  Ascyltos was telling me of his bad luck, who should come up again but  this same very respectable looking person, in company with a woman not at  all bad looking, and, looking at Ascyltos, he requested him to enter the  house, assuring him that there was nothing to fear, and, since he was  unwilling to take the passive part, he should have the active.  The  woman, on her part, urged me very persistently to accompany her, so we  followed the couple, at last, and were conducted between the "]]]
