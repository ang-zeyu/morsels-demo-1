Two hundred generations ago (generations, I mean, of roses) this  was a village street; there was a floral decadence when they left their  simple life and the roses came from the wilderness to clamber round  houses of men.    Of all the memories of that little village, of all the cottages that stood  there, of all the men and women whose homes they were, nothing  remains but a more beautiful blush on the faces of the roses.    I hope that when London is clean passed away and the defeated fields  come back again, like an exiled people returning after a war, they may  find some beautiful thing to remind them of it all; because we have loved  a little that swart old city.          THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN EAR-RINGS      It may be that I dreamed this. So much at least is certain--that I  turned one day from the traffic of a city, and came to its docks and  saw its slimy wharves going down green and steep into the water, and  saw the huge grey river slipping by and the lost things that went with it  turning over and over, and I thought of the nations and unpitying Time,  and saw and marvelled at the queenly ships come newly from the sea.    It was then, if I mistake not, that I saw leaning against a wall, with his  face to the ships, a man with golden ear-rings. His skin had the dark  tint of the southern men: the deep black hairs of his moustache were  whitened a little with salt; he wore a dark blue jacket such as sailors  wear, and the long boots of seafarers, but the look in his eyes was  further afield than the ships, he seemed to be beholding the farthest  things.    Even when I spoke to him he did not call home that look, but  answered me dreamily with that same fixed stare as though his  thoughts were heaving on far and lonely seas. I asked him what ship  he had come by, for there were many there. The sailing ships were  there with their sails all furled and their masts straight and still like a  wintry forest; the steamers were there, and great liners, puffing up idle  smoke into the twilight. He answered he had come by none of them.  I asked him what line he worked on, for he was clearly a sailor; I  mentioned well-known lines, but he did not know them. Then I asked  him where he worked and what he was. And he said: \"I work in the  Sargasso Sea, and I am the last of the pirates, the last left alive.\" And  I shook him by the hand I do not know how many times. I said: \"We  feared you were dead. We feared you were dead.\" And he answered  sadly: \"No. No. I have sinned too deeply on the Spanish seas: I am  not allowed to die.\"          THE DREAM OF KING KARNA-VOOTRA      King Karna-Vootra sitting on his throne commanding all things said:  \"I very clearly saw last night the queenly Vava-Nyria. Though partly  she was hidden by great clouds that swept continually by her, rolling  over and over, yet her face was unhidden and shone, being full of  moonlight.    \"I said to her:    \"'Walk with me by the great pools in many-gardened, beautiful  Istrakhan where the lilies float that give delectable dreams; or,  drawing aside the curtain of hanging orchids, pass with me thence  from the pools by a secret path through the else impassable jungle  that fills the only way between the mountains that shut in Istrakhan.  They shut it in and look on it with joy at morning and at evening when  the pools are strange with light, till in their gladness sometimes there  melts the deadly snow that kills upon lonely heights the mountaineer.  They have valleys among them older than the wrinkles in the moon.    \"'Come with me thence or linger with me there and either we shall  come to romantic lands which the men of the caravans only speak  of in song; or else we shall listlessly walk in a land so lovely that  even the butterflies that float about it when they see their images  flash in the sacred pools are terrified by their beauty, and each night  we shall hear the myriad nightingales all in one chorus sing the stars  to death. Do this and I will send heralds far from here with tidings  of thy beauty; and they shall run and come to Sendara and men  shall know it there who herd brown sheep; and from Sendara the  rumour shall spread on, down either bank of the holy river of Zoth,  till the people that make wattles in the plains shall hear of it and sing;  but the heralds shall go northward along the hills until they come to  Sooma. And in that golden city they shall tell the kings, that sit in their  lofty alabaster house, of thy strange and sudden smiles. And often in  distant markets shall thy story be told by merchants out from Sooma  as they sit telling careless tales to lure men to their wares.    \"'And the heralds passing thence shall come even to Ingra, to  Ingra where they dance. And there they shall tell of thee, so that  thy name long hence shall be sung in that joyous city. And there they  shall borrow camels and pass over the sands and go by desert ways  to distant Nirid to tell of thee to the lonely men in the mountain  monasteries.    \"'Come with me even now for it is Spring.'\"    \"And as I said this she faintly yet perceptibly shook her head. And it  was only then I remembered my youth was gone, and she dead forty  years.\"          THE STORM      They saw a little ship that was far at sea and that went by the name  of the _Petite Esperance_. And because of its uncouth rig and its  lonely air and the look that it had of coming from strangers' lands they  said: \"It is neither a ship to greet nor desire, nor yet to succor when in  the hands of the sea.\"    And the sea rose up as is the wont of the sea and the little ship from  afar was in his hands, and frailer than ever seemed its feeble masts  with their sails of fantastic cut and their alien flags. And the sea made  a great and very triumphing voice, as the sea doth. And then there  arose a wave that was very strong, even the ninth-born son of the  hurricane and the tide, and hid the little ship and hid the whole of the  far parts of the sea. Thereat said those who stood on the good dry  land:    \"'Twas but a little, worthless alien ship and it is sunk at sea, and it is  good and right that the storm have spoil.\" And they turned and watched  the course of the merchant-men, laden with silver and appeasing spice;  year after year they cheered them into port and praised their goods and  their familiar sails. And many years went by.    And at last with decks and bulwarks covered with cloth of gold; with  age-old parrots that had known the troubadours, singing illustrious  songs and preening their feathers of gold; with a hold full of emeralds  and rubies; all silken with Indian loot; furling as it came in its way-worn  alien sails, a galleon glided into port, shutting the sunlight from the  merchantmen: and lo! it loomed the equal of the cliffs.    \"Who are you?\" they asked, \"far-travelled wonderful ship?\"    And they said: \"The _Petite Esperance_.\"    \"O,\" said the people on shore. \"We thought you were sunk at sea.\"    \"Sunk at sea?\" sang the sailors. \"We could not be sunk at sea--we  had the gods on board.\"          A MISTAKEN IDENTITY      Fame as she walked at evening in a city saw the painted face of  Notoriety flaunting beneath a gas-lamp, and many kneeled unto her  in the dirt of the road.    \"Who are you?\" Fame said to her.    \"I am Fame,\" said Notoriety.    Then Fame stole softly away so that no one knew she had gone.    And Notoriety presently went forth and all her worshippers rose and  followed after, and she led them, as was most meet, to her native Pit.          THE TRUE HISTORY OF THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE      For a long time there was doubt with acrimony among the beasts as  to whether the Hare or the Tortoise could run the swifter. Some said  the Hare was the swifter of the two because he had such long ears,  and others said the Tortoise was the swifter because anyone whose  shell was so hard as that should be able to run hard too. And lo, the  forces of estrangement and disorder perpetually postponed a decisive  contest.    But when there was nearly war among the beasts, at last an  arrangement was come to and it was decided that the Hare and the  Tortoise should run a race of five hundred yards so that all should  see who was right.    \"Ridiculous nonsense!\" said the Hare, and it was all his backers could  do to get him to run.    \"The contest is most welcome to me,\" said the Tortoise, \"I shall not  shirk it.\"    O, how his backers cheered.    Feeling ran high on the day of the race; the goose rushed at the fox  and nearly pecked him. Both sides spoke loudly of the approaching  victory up to the very moment of the race.    \"I am absolutely confident of success,\" said the Tortoise. But  the Hare said nothing, he looked bored and cross. Some of his  supporters deserted him then and went to the other side, who were  loudly cheering the Tortoise's inspiriting words. But many remained  with the Hare. \"We shall not be disappointed in him,\" they said. \"A  beast with such long ears is bound to win.\"    \"Run hard,\" said the supporters of the Tortoise.    And \"run hard\" became a kind of catch-phrase which everybody  repeated to one another. \"Hard shell and hard living. That's what  the country wants. Run hard,\" they said. And these words were  never uttered but multitudes cheered from their hearts.    Then they were off, and suddenly there was a hush.    The Hare dashed off for about a hundred yards, then he looked  round to see where his rival was.    \"It is rather absurd,\" he said, \"to race with a Tortoise.\" And he sat  down and scratched himself. \"Run hard! Run hard!\" shouted some.    \"Let him rest,\" shouted others. And \"let him rest\" became a  catch-phrase too.    And after a while his rival drew near to him.    \"There comes that damned Tortoise,\" said the Hare, and he got up  and ran as hard as could be so that he should not let the Tortoise  beat him.    \"Those ears will win,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7841"],[0,"A Primary Reader: Old-time Stories, Fairy Tales and Myths Retold (#4)"],[1," from the fire.         *       *       *       *       *              stand         lump            ring    He next put a lump of gold into the fire.    He said to Brok, \"Blow and blow and blow, and do not stop.\"    Then Sindre went out again.    So Brok blew as hard as he could.    Then the same fly came in and bit him again.    Brok thought that he could not stand it, but he kept on.    When Sindre came back, he took a gold ring from the fire.           *       *       *       *       *              hard          forehead        brush            iron          blood           hammer            handle        spoiled         mean    Then Sindre put a lump of iron into the fire.    He said to Brok, \"Now blow as hard as you can.\"    And Sindre went out. Brok blew and blew. The same mean fly came again,  and bit him on the forehead. It bit so hard that the blood ran into  his eyes.    Brok put up his hand to brush away the fly.    Just then Sindre came back.    He took the hammer out of the fire.    [Illustration: THE DWARFS WITH THE GOLDEN PIG, THE RING AND THE  HAMMER.]    \"There!\" he said, \"You have almost spoiled it. The handle is too  short, but it cannot be helped now.\"            *       *       *       *       *              hurried       proud            came          pocket    Brok hurried up to Asgard with his things.    All the gods came around to see. Then Loki came up to show his things.    He put the crown of gold on Sif's head and it began to grow like real  hair.    He gave the spear to Odin and said, \"This spear will never miss its  mark.\"    [Illustration: SIF WITH THE GOLDEN CROWN]    Then he took out the ship. He said, \"This is a wonderful ship. It will  sail on any sea, and yet you can fold it up and put it into your  pocket.\"    Loki felt very proud, for he thought his things were the best.           *       *       *       *       *              fold          sail            afraid            sorry         each            ring            shining       faster          gave    All the gods felt very sorry for little Brok. They thought Loki's  things were fine. They were afraid Brok's would not be so nice.    [Illustration: BROK SHOWS HIS THINGS TO THE GODS.]    They said, \"Now, Brok, show your things.\"    Brok took out the gold ring. He said, \"Each night this ring will  throw off a ring just like it. He gave the ring to Odin.\"    Then Brok took out the golden pig. He said, \"This pig can go anywhere,  on the ground or in the air. It can go faster than any horse. If the  night is dark, the shining pig will make it light.\"           *       *       *       *       *              frost         giants            turned        blowing    [Illustration: THOR WITH HIS HAMMER]    Then Brok showed the hammer. He said, \"This is not a very pretty  hammer. When I was making it, Loki turned himself into a fly and made  me spoil it. The fly bit me so hard that I had to stop blowing. So the  handle is a little short. But it is a wonderful hammer. If you throw  it at anything, it will hit the mark and come back to you.\"    The gods picked up the hammer and passed it around.    They said, \"It will be just the things with which to keep the Frost  Giants out of Asgard.\"           *       *       *       *       *              touch         neck            without       way    The gods said, \"Brok's things are the best.\"    Brok gave the hammer to Thor. That is the way Thor got his wonderful  hammer.    Then Brok said to Loki, \"You said I could have your head if my things  were the best.\"    And Loki was angry and said, \"Yes, I told you that you could have my  head. But you can't touch my neck.\"    Of course, Brok could not get his head without touching his neck.    So Brok did not get Loki's head.    [Illustration: THE FROST GIANT]          THE HAMMER LOST AND FOUND.                everything    planned    The Frost Giants did not like the sunshine. They did not like to see  the flowers. They did not like to hear the birds sing. They wanted to  spoil everything.    The Frost Giants wanted to get into Asgard. But they did not know how.  They were afraid of Thor and his hammer. They said, \"If we can only  get the hammer, we can get into Asgard.\"    They talked and planned all night. At last one Frost Giant said, \"I  know how we can get the hammer. I will dress in a bird suit. Then I  will fly up to Thor's house and get the hammer.\"    [Illustration: THE FROST GIANTS TALKED AND PLANNED ALL NIGHT.]           *       *       *       *       *              Freyja    The next night the Frost Giant flew into the house while Thor was  asleep.    He took the hammer and flew away with it.    When Thor woke, he put out his hand to get the hammer. It was gone.    He said, \"Loki, the hammer is gone. The Frost Giants have taken it. We  must get it back.\"    [Illustration: THE FROST GIANT FLEW INTO THE HOUSE WHILE THOR WAS  ASLEEP.]    Loki said, \"I can get it back, if Freyja will let me have her falcon  suit.\"    So he went to Freyja and said, \"Will you let me have your falcon suit?  I can get the hammer back if you will.\" Freyja said, \"Yes, of course I  will. If I had a gold suit you could have it. Any thing to get the  hammer back.\"           *       *       *       *       *              people        city            Thrym            strange       buried          eight            miles         deep            falcon    Loki took the falcon suit and put it on. He flew over the city. All  the people saw him flying. They said, \"What a strange bird!\" They did  not know that it was Loki going for the hammer.    [Illustration: LOKI BORROWS THE FALCON SUIT.]    When Loki came to the city of the Frost Giants, he took off the falcon  suit. He walked and walked until he came to Thrym's house. Thrym was  the giant who took the hammer.    Thrym was sitting on the porch, making gold collars for his dogs.    When he saw Loki, he said, \"What do you want?\"    Loki said, \"I have come for the hammer.\"    The old giant laughed and said, \"You will never get that hammer. It is  buried eight miles deep in the ground.    \"But there is one way you can get it. I will give you the hammer if  you get Freyja for my wife.\"           *       *       *       *       *              clothes       shook           necklace    So Loki went back to Asgard.    Thor said, \"Well, did you get the hammer?\"    \"No, but we can get it if Freyja will be Thrym's wife.\"    Then they went to Freyja's house. They said, \"Put on your very best  clothes and come with us. You must be Thrym's wife.\"    Freyja said, \"Do you think I will be the Frost Giant's wife? I won't  be his wife.\"    Thor said, \"We can get the hammer back if you will.\"    But Freyja said, \"No, I will not be his wife.\"    Loki said, \"You will have to, if we get the hammer back.\"    Still Freyja said, \"I will not go.\" And she was very angry. She shook  so hard that she broke her necklace and it fell to the floor.           *       *       *       *       *              bride         braided         wagon            vail          servant         goat    Then the gods said, \"Thor, you must dress like Freyja. You will have  to play you are the bride.\"    Thor said, \"I won't do it. You will all laugh at me. I won't dress up  like a girl.\"    They said, \"Well, that is the only way we can get the hammer back.\"    Thor said, \"I do not like to dress like a girl, but I will do it.\"  Then they dressed Thor up like Freyja.    They put on Freyja's dress, necklace and vail, and braided his hair.    Loki said, \"I will dress up too, and be your servant.\"    They got into Thor's goat wagon and went to the Giants' home.    [Illustration: THOR AND LOKI APPROACH THE HOUSE OF THE GIANTS]           *       *       *       *       *              dinner        salmon          mead            whole         thirsty         barrels    When the Frost Giants saw them coming, they said, \"Get ready, here  comes the bride! We will sit down to the table as soon as they come.\"    The dinner was ready on time. The table was full of good things. All  sat down.    The bride ate a whole ox and eight salmon before the others had a  bite.    \"She must be very hungry,\" the Frost Giants said.    \"Yes,\" Loki said, \"she was so glad to come. She hasn't eaten anything  for eight days.\"    Then they brought in the mead.    [Illustration: THOR AND LOKI MET BY THRYM]    The bride drank three barrels of mead.    \"How thirsty she is!\" said the Frost Giants.    Loki said, \"Yes, she is very thirsty. She was so glad to come. She did  not drink anything for eight days.\"           *       *       *       *       *              kiss          stepped         whirled            lifted        shone           lap    Old Thrym said, \"I had every thing I wanted but Freyja. Now I have  Freyja.\"    And Thrym went to kiss the bride. He lifted her vail, but her eyes  shone like fire.    [Illustration: THRYM PUTS THE HAMMER IN THOR'S LAP.]    [Illustration: THOR AND HIS HAMMER.]    Thrym stepped back. He said, \"What makes Freyja's eyes shine so?\"    Loki said, \"Oh, she was so glad to come. She did not sleep for eight  nights.\"    Then Loki said, \"It is time for the hammer. Go and get it and put it  in the bride's lap.\"    As soon as the hammer was in his lap, Thor tore off the vail.    He took the hammer and whirled it around. Fire flew from it. The  fire burned the house and the Frost Giants ran away.    So Thor got his hammer back.
