A similar record applies to Senegal, in West Africa. It had been French  since the era of Richelieu, with intervals of capture, restoration, and  recapture. The British ousted their rivals once more in 1804, and gave  back the conquest in 1815.    A careful examination of these details reveals a remarkable fact.  Although the year 1810 saw the Napoleonic empire at the crest of its  greatness in Europe; although by that time the Emperor was the mightiest  personal factor in world politics; although in that year he married a  daughter of the Caesars, and thought he had laid plans for the foundation  of a dynasty that should perpetuate the Napoleonic name in association  with Napoleonic power--yet, in that very year, France had been stripped  of the last inch of her colonial possessions. The nation in whose  glorious Pantheon were emblazoned the great names of Montcalm and  Dupleix, of Jacques Cartier and La Salle, of Champlain and La  Bourdonnais, and whose inveterate capacity for colonisation of even the  most difficult kind can never be doubted by any candid student of her  achievements in this field, both before and since the disastrous  Napoleonic age, was now naked of even so much as a barren rock in a  distant sea upon which to plant her flag.    Such is the picture of the French colonial system as it presents itself  during the period within which occurred the events described in this  book. These facts give poignancy to the reflection of the distinguished  philosophical historian who has written of his country: \"A melancholy  consequence of her policy of interference in neighbouring states, and of  occupying herself with continental conquests, has always been the loss of  her naval power and of her colonies. She could only establish oversea  possessions on a durable foundation on the condition of renouncing the  policy of invasion that she practised in Europe during the centuries.  Every continental victory was balanced by the ruin of our naval power and  of our distant possessions, that is to say, the decrease of our real  influence in the world.\"* (* Leroy-Beaulieu, Colonisation chez les  Peuples Modernes, 1902 edition, 1 220.)    PART 3.    It would be simple to sum up the colonial situation of Great Britain in  the period under review, by saying that she gained just in the measure  that France lost. But such a crude formula would not convey a sufficient  sense of her actual achievements. The end of the great war left her with  a wider dominion than that with which she was endowed when she plunged  into the struggle; but it left her also with augmented power and  prestige, a settled sense of security, and a steeled spirit of  resolution--elements not measurable on the scale of the map, but counting  as immense factors in the government and development of oversea  possessions.    The details of the British colonial empire during the storm epoch, are as  follow:--    In Canada she governed a belt of country stretching from the Atlantic to  the Pacific, divided for administrative purposes into two areas, one of  which, Lower Canada--embracing the cities of Quebec and Montreal, and  including the basin of the St. Lawrence--was populated principally by  people of French origin. It would be too much to suppose that these  colonists, who jealously preserved the French language and the French  tradition, were indifferent to the doings of their kin across the water;  and there were, indeed, many who cherished the hope that events would so  shape themselves as to restore the authority of France in this part of  the New World. But the habitant was Roman Catholic as well as French, and  the hierarchy was profoundly distrustful of the regime which it regarded  as the heritage of the hateful ideas of 1789. We may speculate as to what  would have happened if Napoleon had set himself to woo the affections of  the French Canadians. But throughout the great wars Canada remained loyal  to the British connection, despite internal difficulties and discontents.    Great Britain also held Newfoundland, as well as those maritime provinces  which have since become federated as part of the Dominion.    In South America she possessed British Guiana, and for a period, as  related above, French Guiana also.    In the West Indies, in 1800, her flag flew over the entire crescent of  the Windward and Leeward groups from Granada to the Virgins; she was  mistress of Trinidad, Tobago, Jamaica, the \"still vexd\" Bermudas and the  whole bunch of the Bahamas; and she had interests in San Domingo. At the  Peace of Amiens she retained only Trinidad of the islands captured during  the war; and she presented no very stubborn resistance to the negro  revolt that lost her any further control over the largest of the sugar  islands.    She had the Cape of Good Hope in her custody in 1800, but weakly allowed  it to be bartered away by diplomacy at Amiens; only, however, to reassert  her power there six years later, when it became at length apparent to  British statesmen--as it surely should have been obvious to them  throughout--that Australia and India could not be secure while the chief  southern harbour of Africa was in foreign possession.    Ceylon was retained as a sparkling jewel for the British crown when so  much that had been won in fair fight was allowed to slip away. The  capture of Java (1811) and its restoration to the Dutch belong to a later  period; whilst the growth of British power in India scarcely falls within  the scope of a brief review of the colonial situation, though of great  importance in its effects.    Malta, which has usually been classed as a colony, though its principal  value is rather strategic than colonial, was occupied by the British in  September 1800, and the cat-footed efforts of Napoleonic diplomacy to get  her out of the island made it a storm centre in European politics in  these fiery years. Out she would not come, and did not. Neither Tzar nor  Emperor could get her out, by plot or by arms; and there she still  remains.    PART 4.    The position of the British in the South Seas demands special  consideration, as being immediately related to our subject. In 1800 the  only part of Australasia occupied by white people was Norfolk Island and  the small area at Port Jackson shut in between the sea and a precipitous  range of mountains that for thirteen years to come presented an  unconquerable barrier to inland exploration, despite repeated endeavours  to find a way across them. The settlement had spread only a few miles  beyond the spot where Governor Arthur Phillip had resolved to locate his  First Fleet company twelve years before. As yet no attempt had been made  to occupy Tasmania, which had been determined to be an island only two  years previously. New Zealand also was virgin ground for the European  colonist. The Maori had it all to himself.    The means of defending the little colony, in the event of an attack  during the war which raged from five years after its foundation till  1802, and again from 1803 for twelve years more, were insignificant. The  population in 1800 numbered rather more than five thousand, only about  one-half of whom were soldiers, officials, and free people.* (* The total  population of Sydney, Parramatta, and Norfolk Island on January 1, 1801,  was declared to be 5100, of whom 2492 were convicts--1431 men, 500 women,  and 561 children. Of the remainder, 1887 were \"free people,\" being  neither on the civil nor the military establishment.) The remainder were  convicts, some of them being Irishmen transported for participation in  the rebellion of 1798, including not a few men of education. These men  were naturally writhing under a burning sense of defeat and oppression,  and were still rebels at heart. They were incarcerated with a  miscellaneous horde of criminals made desperate and resentful by harsh  treatment. It is scarcely doubtful that if a French naval squadron had  descended on the coast, the authorities would have had to face, not only  an enemy's guns in Port Jackson, but an insurrection amongst the unhappy  people whom the colony had been primarily founded to chastise. The  immigration of a farming and artisan class was discouraged; and it is  scarcely conceivable that, apart from the officials, the gaolers, and the  military, who would have done their duty resolutely, there were any in  the colony who, for affection, would have lifted a hand to defend the  land in which they lived, and the regime which they hated.    There was at the Governor's command a small military force, barely  sufficient to maintain discipline in a community in which there were  necessarily dangerously turbulent elements;* (* In a report to Governor  King, April 1805, Brevet-Major Johnson pointed out that the military were  barely sufficient for mounting guard, and urged \"the great want of an  augmentation to the military forces of this colony\" (Historical Records  of New South Wales 6 183). Colonel Paterson, in a letter to Sir Joseph  Banks, 1804, remarked that \"it will certainly appear evident that our  military force at present is very inadequate\" (Ibid 5 454). John  Blaxland, in a letter to Lord Liverpool, 1809, wrote that \"it is to be  feared that if two frigates were to appear, the settlement is not capable  of opposing any resistance\" (Ibid 7 231). An unsigned memorandum in the  Record Office, \"bearing internal evidence of having been written by an  officer who was in the colony during the Governorship of Hunter,\" pointed  out that \"a naval force is absolutely necessary on the coast of New South  Wales...to protect the colony from an attack by the French from the  Mauritius, which would have taken place long ago if the enemy had  possessed a naval force equal to the enterprise\" (Ibid 7 248 to 250).)  but he was destitute of effective vessels for service afloat."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7452"],[0,"Autobiography of a Yogi (#4)"],[1,"  me!\" Sister bolted away like a frightened fawn.    {FN1-2} Spiritual teacher; from Sanskrit root GUR, to raise, to  uplift.    {FN1-3} A practitioner of yoga, \"union,\" ancient Indian science of  meditation on God.    {FN1-4} My name was changed to Yogananda when I entered the ancient  monastic Swami Order in 1914.

Any word spoken with clear realization and deep concentration  has a materializing value. Loud or silent repetition of inspiring  words has been found effective in Coueism and similar systems of  psychotherapy; the secret lies in the stepping-up of the mind's  vibratory rate. The poet Tennyson has left us, in his MEMOIRS, an  account of his repetitious device for passing beyond the conscious  mind into superconsciousness:    \"A kind of waking trance-this for lack of a better word-I have  frequently had, quite up from boyhood, when I have been all alone,\"  Tennyson wrote. \"This has come upon me through REPEATING my own  name to myself silently, till all at once, as it were out of the  intensity of the consciousness of individuality, individuality itself  seemed to dissolve and fade away into boundless being, and this not  a confused state but the clearest, the surest of the surest, utterly  beyond words-where death was an almost laughable impossibility-the  loss of personality (if so it were) seeming no extinction, but the  only true life.\" He wrote further: \"It is no nebulous ecstasy, but  a state of transcendent wonder, associated with absolute clearness  of mind.\"    {FN1-13} Kali is a symbol of God in the aspect of eternal Mother  Nature.        CHAPTER: 2    MY MOTHER'S DEATH AND THE MYSTIC AMULET    My mother's greatest desire was the marriage of my elder brother.  \"Ah, when I behold the face of Ananta's wife, I shall find heaven  on this earth!\" I frequently heard Mother express in these words  her strong Indian sentiment for family continuity.    I was about eleven years old at the time of Ananta's betrothal.  Mother was in Calcutta, joyously supervising the wedding preparations.  Father and I alone remained at our home in Bareilly in northern  India, whence Father had been transferred after two years at Lahore.    I had previously witnessed the splendor of nuptial rites for my  two elder sisters, Roma and Uma; but for Ananta, as the eldest son,  plans were truly elaborate. Mother was welcoming numerous relatives,  daily arriving in Calcutta from distant homes. She lodged them  comfortably in a large, newly acquired house at 50 Amherst Street.  Everything was in readiness-the banquet delicacies, the gay throne  on which Brother was to be carried to the home of the bride-to-be,  the rows of colorful lights, the mammoth cardboard elephants and  camels, the English, Scottish and Indian orchestras, the professional  entertainers, the priests for the ancient rituals.    Father and I, in gala spirits, were planning to join the family  in time for the ceremony. Shortly before the great day, however,  I had an ominous vision.    It was in Bareilly on a midnight. As I slept beside Father on the  piazza of our bungalow, I was awakened by a peculiar flutter of  the mosquito netting over the bed. The flimsy curtains parted and  I saw the beloved form of my mother.    \"Awaken your father!\" Her voice was only a whisper. \"Take the first  available train, at four o'clock this morning. Rush to Calcutta if  you would see me!\" The wraithlike figure vanished.    \"Father, Father! Mother is dying!\" The terror in my tone aroused  him instantly. I sobbed out the fatal tidings.    \"Never mind that hallucination of yours.\" Father gave his characteristic  negation to a new situation. \"Your mother is in excellent health.  If we get any bad news, we shall leave tomorrow.\"    \"You shall never forgive yourself for not starting now!\" Anguish  caused me to add bitterly, \"Nor shall I ever forgive you!\"    The melancholy morning came with explicit words: \"Mother dangerously  ill; marriage postponed; come at once.\"    Father and I left distractedly. One of my uncles met us en route  at a transfer point. A train thundered toward us, looming with  telescopic increase. From my inner tumult, an abrupt determination  arose to hurl myself on the railroad tracks. Already bereft, I  felt, of my mother, I could not endure a world suddenly barren to  the bone. I loved Mother as my dearest friend on earth. Her solacing  black eyes had been my surest refuge in the trifling tragedies of  childhood.    \"Does she yet live?\" I stopped for one last question to my uncle.    \"Of course she is alive!\" He was not slow to interpret the desperation  in my face. But I scarcely believed him.    When we reached our Calcutta home, it was only to confront the  stunning mystery of death. I collapsed into an almost lifeless  state.  Years passed before any reconciliation entered my heart.  Storming the very gates of heaven, my cries at last summoned the  Divine Mother. Her words brought final healing to my suppurating  wounds:    \"It is I who have watched over thee, life after life, in the  tenderness of many mothers! See in My gaze the two black eyes, the  lost beautiful eyes, thou seekest!\"    Father and I returned to Bareilly soon after the crematory  rites for the well-beloved. Early every morning I made a pathetic  memorial--pilgrimage to a large SHEOLI tree which shaded the  smooth, green-gold lawn before our bungalow. In poetical moments,  I thought that the white SHEOLI flowers were strewing themselves  with a willing devotion over the grassy altar. Mingling tears with  the dew, I often observed a strange other-worldly light emerging  from the dawn. Intense pangs of longing for God assailed me. I felt  powerfully drawn to the Himalayas.    One of my cousins, fresh from a period of travel in the holy hills,  visited us in Bareilly. I listened eagerly to his tales about the  high mountain abode of yogis and swamis. {FN2-1}    \"Let us run away to the Himalayas.\" My suggestion one day to  Dwarka Prasad, the young son of our landlord in Bareilly, fell on  unsympathetic ears. He revealed my plan to my elder brother, who  had just arrived to see Father. Instead of laughing lightly over  this impractical scheme of a small boy, Ananta made it a definite  point to ridicule me.    \"Where is your orange robe? You can't be a swami without that!\"    But I was inexplicably thrilled by his words. They brought a clear  picture of myself roaming about India as a monk. Perhaps they  awakened memories of a past life; in any case, I began to see with  what natural ease I would wear the garb of that anciently-founded  monastic order.    Chatting one morning with Dwarka, I felt a love for God descending  with avalanchic force. My companion was only partly attentive to  the ensuing eloquence, but I was wholeheartedly listening to myself.    I fled that afternoon toward Naini Tal in the Himalayan foothills.  Ananta gave determined chase; I was forced to return sadly to  Bareilly. The only pilgrimage permitted me was the customary one  at dawn to the SHEOLI tree. My heart wept for the lost Mothers,  human and divine.    The rent left in the family fabric by Mother's death was irreparable.  Father never remarried during his nearly forty remaining years.  Assuming the difficult role of Father-Mother to his little flock,  he grew noticeably more tender, more approachable. With calmness  and insight, he solved the various family problems. After office  hours he retired like a hermit to the cell of his room, practicing  KRIYA YOGA in a sweet serenity. Long after Mother's death, I attempted  to engage an English nurse to attend to details that would make my  parent's life more comfortable. But Father shook his head.    [Illustration: My Mother, A Disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya--see  mother.jpg]    \"Service to me ended with your mother.\" His eyes were remote with  a lifelong devotion. \"I will not accept ministrations from any  other woman.\"    Fourteen months after Mother's passing, I learned that she had left  me a momentous message. Ananta was present at her deathbed and had  recorded her words. Although she had asked that the disclosure be  made to me in one year, my brother delayed. He was soon to leave  Bareilly for Calcutta, to marry the girl Mother had chosen for him.  {FN2-2} One evening he summoned me to his side.    \"Mukunda, I have been reluctant to give you strange tidings.\"  Ananta's tone held a note of resignation. \"My fear was to inflame  your desire to leave home. But in any case you are bristling with  divine ardor.  When I captured you"]]]
