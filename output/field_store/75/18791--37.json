[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4583"],[0,"Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (#4)"],[1,"of this or any other theological  subject: But I shall confine myself, at present, to one equally celebrated  for piety and philosophy. It is Father MALEBRANCHE, who, I remember, thus  expresses himself [Recherche de la Verite. Liv. 3. Chap.9]. \"One ought not  so much,\" says he, \"to call God a spirit, in order to express positively  what he is, as in order to signify that he is not matter. He is a Being  infinitely perfect: Of this we cannot doubt. But in the same manner as  we ought not to imagine, even supposing him corporeal, that he is clothed  with a human body, as the ANTHROPOMORPHITES asserted, under colour that  that figure was the most perfect of any; so, neither ought we to imagine  that the spirit of God has human ideas, or bears any resemblance to our  spirit, under colour that we know nothing more perfect than a human mind.  We ought rather to believe, that as he comprehends the perfections of  matter without being material.... he comprehends also the perfections of  created spirits without being spirit, in the manner we conceive spirit:  That his true name is, He that is; or, in other words, Being without  restriction, All Being, the Being infinite and universal.\"    After so great an authority, DEMEA, replied PHILO, as that which you have  produced, and a thousand more which you might produce, it would appear  ridiculous in me to add my sentiment, or express my approbation of your  doctrine. But surely, where reasonable men treat these subjects, the  question can never be concerning the Being, but only the Nature, of the  Deity. The former truth, as you well observe, is unquestionable and  self-evident. Nothing exists without a cause; and the original cause of  this universe (whatever it be) we call God; and piously ascribe to him  every species of perfection. Whoever scruples this fundamental truth,  deserves every punishment which can be inflicted among philosophers, to  wit, the greatest ridicule, contempt, and disapprobation. But as all  perfection is entirely relative, we ought never to imagine that we  comprehend the attributes of this divine Being, or to suppose that his  perfections have any analogy or likeness to the perfections of a human  creature. Wisdom, Thought, Design, Knowledge; these we justly ascribe to  him; because these words are honourable among men, and we have no other  language or other conceptions by which we can express our adoration of  him. But let us beware, lest we think that our ideas anywise correspond  to his perfections, or that his attributes have any resemblance to these  qualities among men. He is infinitely superior to our limited view and  comprehension; and is more the object of worship in the temple, than of  disputation in the schools.    In reality, CLEANTHES, continued he, there is no need of having recourse  to that affected scepticism so displeasing to you, in order to come at  this determination. Our ideas reach no further than our experience. We  have no experience of divine attributes and operations. I need not  conclude my syllogism. You can draw the inference yourself. And it is a  pleasure to me (and I hope to you too) that just reasoning and sound  piety here concur in the same conclusion, and both of them establish the  adorably mysterious and incomprehensible nature of the Supreme Being.    Not to lose any time in circumlocutions, said CLEANTHES, addressing  himself to DEMEA, much less in replying to the pious declamations of  PHILO; I shall briefly explain how I conceive this matter. Look round the  world: contemplate the whole and every part of it: You will find it to be  nothing but one great machine, subdivided into an infinite number of  lesser machines, which again admit of subdivisions to a degree beyond  what human senses and faculties can trace and explain. All these various  machines, and even their most minute parts, are adjusted to each other  with an accuracy which ravishes into admiration all men who have ever  contemplated them. The curious adapting of means to ends, throughout all  nature, resembles exactly, though it much exceeds, the productions of  human contrivance; of human designs, thought, wisdom, and intelligence.  Since, therefore, the effects resemble each other, we are led to infer,  by all the rules of analogy, that the causes also resemble; and that the  Author of Nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man, though possessed  of much larger faculties, proportioned to the grandeur of the work which  he has executed. By this argument a posteriori, and by this argument  alone, do we prove at once the existence of a Deity, and his similarity  to human mind and intelligence.    I shall be so free, CLEANTHES, said DEMEA, as to tell you, that from the  beginning, I could not approve of your conclusion concerning the  similarity of the Deity to men; still less can I approve of the mediums  by which you endeavour to establish it. What! No demonstration of the  Being of God! No abstract arguments! No proofs a priori! Are these, which  have hitherto been so much insisted on by philosophers, all fallacy, all  sophism? Can we reach no further in this subject than experience and  probability? I will not say that this is betraying the cause of a Deity:  But surely, by this affected candour, you give advantages to Atheists,  which they never could obtain by the mere dint of argument and reasoning.    What I chiefly scruple in this subject, said PHILO, is not so much that  all religious arguments are by CLEANTHES reduced to experience, as that  they appear not to be even the most certain and irrefragable of that  inferior kind. That a stone will fall, that fire will burn, that the  earth has solidity, we have observed a thousand and a thousand times; and  when any new instance of this nature is presented, we draw without  hesitation the accustomed inference. The exact similarity of the cases  gives us a perfect assurance of a similar event; and a stronger evidence  is never desired nor sought after. But wherever you depart, in the least,  from the similarity of the cases, you diminish proportionably the  evidence; and may at last bring it to a very weak analogy, which is  confessedly liable to error and uncertainty. After having experienced the  circulation of the blood in human creatures, we make no doubt that it  takes place in TITIUS and MAEVIUS. But from its circulation in frogs and  fishes, it is only a presumption, though a strong one, from analogy, that  it takes place in men and other animals. The analogical reasoning is much  weaker, when we infer the circulation of the sap in vegetables from our  experience that the blood circulates in animals; and those, who hastily  followed that imperfect analogy, are found, by more accurate experiments,  to have been mistaken.    If we see a house, CLEANTHES, we conclude, with the greatest certainty,  that it had an architect or builder; because this is precisely that  species of effect which we have experienced to proceed from that species  of cause. But surely you will not affirm, that the universe bears such a  resemblance to a house, that we can with the same certainty infer a  similar cause, or that the analogy is here entire and perfect. The  dissimilitude is so striking, that the utmost you can here pretend to is  a guess, a conjecture, a presumption concerning a similar cause; and how  that pretension will be received in the world, I leave you to consider.    It would surely be very ill received, replied CLEANTHES; and I should be  deservedly blamed and detested, did I allow, that the proofs of a Deity  amounted to no more than a guess or conjecture. But is the whole  adjustment of means to ends in a house and in the universe so slight a  resemblance? The economy of final causes? The order, proportion, and  arrangement of every part? Steps of a stair are plainly contrived, that  human legs may use them in mounting; and this inference is certain and  infallible. Human legs are also contrived for walking and mounting; and  this inference, I allow, is not altogether so certain, because of the  dissimilarity which you remark; but does it, therefore, deserve the name  only of presumption or conjecture?    Good God! cried DEMEA, interrupting him, where are we? Zealous defenders  of religion allow, that the proofs of a Deity fall short of perfect  evidence! And you, PHILO, on whose assistance I depended in proving the  adorable mysteriousness of the Divine Nature, do you assent to all these  extravagant opinions of CLEANTHES? For what other name can I give them?  or, why spare my censure, when such principles are advanced, supported by  such an authority, before so young a man as PAMPHILUS?    You seem not to apprehend, replied PHILO, that I argue with CLEANTHES in  his own way; and, by showing him the dangerous consequences of his  tenets, hope at last to reduce him to our opinion. But what sticks most  with you, I observe, is the representation which CLEANTHES has made of  the argument a posteriori; and finding that that argument is likely to  escape your hold and vanish into air, you think it so disguised, that you  can scarcely believe it to be set in its true light. Now, however much I  may dissent, in other respects, from the dangerous principles of  CLEANTHES, I must allow that he has fairly represented that argument; and  I shall endeavour so to state the matter to you, that you will entertain  no further scruples with regard to it.    Were a man to abstract from every thing which he knows or has seen, he  would be altogether incapable, merely from his own ideas, to determine  what kind of scene the universe must be, or to give the preference to one  state or situation of things above another. For as nothing which he  clearly conceives could be esteemed impossible or implying a contradiction,  every chimera of his fancy would be upon an equal footing; nor could he  assign any just reason why he adheres to one idea or system, and rejects  the others which are equally "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45846"],[0,"Letters Exhibiting the Most Prominent Doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of (#4)"],[1,"small arms as ridicule and preconceived objections, that need only be  brought to light to be dissipated like fog in the meridian sun?    Do temperance lecturers, bible and education agents, and other  moral reformers find it necessary to carry on their enterprises by  such means? Do they seek to avoid an open and frank discussion with  the intemperate portions of the community? Do they avoid a manly  investigation because the intemperate portions of the community  combine, in their life and conduct, beastly sottishness, unprovoked  abuse to wives and children, a prodigal waste of competence and ample  fortunes, and the overthrow of intellect, and the dissolution of all  moral ties? No, by no means! They seek the broad day light of public  discussion, because they know the truth and power of that side of the  cause which they have espoused. They know that intemperance cannot  survive the impartial observation of good men. All we ask is that the  word of God may have free course. We wish that it may come distinctly  to the knowledge of men, that they may sit in impartial judgment upon  it.    By the _word_ of God, we mean not only what was revealed for the  ancients especially, but also what is _now_ revealed for this  generation. Oh! says the objector, he wants the word of Joseph Smith to  have a free circulation, and this we oppose, because it is blasphemous  and preposterous. Yes, we want the word of God by Joseph Smith, to be  known and read of all men, because it is written not with ink, but by  the spirit of the living God. What were Peter, Elijah, or Moses, but  earthen vessels, by whom God communicated his own knowledge, power,  and glory? Does not the word by Joseph commend itself to every man's  conscience where it is heard with due candour? I have never seen that  person who had read the Book of Mormon, and the Book of Doctrine and  Covenants entirely through, with an earnest desire to know whether it  was of God or not, who could raise any worthy objection against them.  A few isolated portions of these books are often selected out and made  to speak some other besides their true meaning, and thereby a dislike  for these books is created; consequently, some refuse to read them at  all, while some others read only to confirm their prepossessions and  prejudices; and superficial inquirers hear with credulity that such a  minister, editor, or professor of some College, has published an expose  or refutation of Mormonism, that will inflict a fatal wound upon  this glaring and blasphemous heresy.    Now it is well known that the novelties of this age are so many and  so various, that no man has time to examine into them all; and many  consider that a hint from a pious editor, or distinguished reviewer  against Mormonism, is sufficient apology for them not to examine  it. Now under these considerations, it is easy to divine that the  doctrines of the Latter-day Saints must travel through obstacles and  difficulties of the greatest magnitude; and I am ready, dear brother,  to mourn over the prospect, because many bad men, and some good men,  will fight against the faith, not knowing what they do. My bosom heaves  with the deeper concern, because I know this to be the true gospel,  and that it will prevail, even though the foe should be so great and  powerful as the Lord's enemies were in the days of Noah. Pardon my  assurance when I say that those beautiful systems, called benevolent  operations, must come to nought; not because they are not honestly  designed for some good effect, but because they are a mixture of human  device with the wisdom of God, or the gospel perverted. I know, too,  that these beautiful systems, together with the various orders of  sectarianism, cannot well be vanquished without a desperate struggle  ensue. Sectarianism is old and venerable, and having undergone many  costly repairs, without much substantial improvement, it never can be  demolished without violent resistance. There is an air of sacredness  around it that will stimulate its votaries insensibly; and when they  are assailed by the strong hand of Bible truth, rather than see their  fortress taken by the illiterate followers of the despised prophet,  will summon to their aid the worst passions, and push matters to the  greatest extremities. These remarks are amply supported by the history  of the past, both in respect to Former and Latter-day Saints.    See the ancient Jew of our Lord's day--his piety was scrupulously  exact--he knew the worth of his religion by the pains and expense it  had cost him. Every thing had with great trouble been fashioned into  a system of sacredness. They had been striving hard for a beautiful  system of perfection that would commend them to God, and mourned that  any of Abraham's children should teach that there was no resurrection,  &c., and not harmonize with them in bearing heavy burdens in order  to save men's souls. And when an obscure personage sprung up, and  broke over their rules of piety, and mingled with the profane without  ceremonious washing, and was seen to drink wine, probably, and eat with  the boisterous and odious classes, without pretending to wash away  the contagion that accrued, and to travel on the Sabbath day, and to  pluck ears of corn without any signs of confession, and to heap harsh  sounding and heavy anathemas upon the most intelligent and devoted men  of the age, and claim to be a prophet, while he ignorantly conversed  with an adulterous woman. All this, the scrupulous Jew could not,  and would not, bear; and his anger was heightened to madness when he  found that many adhered to the new teacher, and occasionally a person  of wealth and standing was won over to the impostor by his artifice  and jugglery. And as the influence of this odious personage spread,  especially among the common people, who had not sufficient sagacity to  detect his fraudulent tricks; and as the orthodoxy and piety of the  children of Abraham and Moses began to be suspected, and suspicion  even preached in synagogues that were too holy for such pollution, the  devoted children of Abraham became exasperated. If we let him alone,  say they, all men will believe on him. Fearful to use the rod and  power, by reason of the Romans, to the utmost rigour, they, at first,  sought to render him obnoxious to Caesar; but as measures successively  failed, they thirsted for his blood until their pious malice was  glutted in his expiring agonies. Then thought they, every body may know  that his miracles are all a humbug, because he could not save himself.    Now, brother, I ask you to stop and make a full pause by way of  reflection. How do devoted sectarians entertain the Latter-day Saints?  Not surely by a candid exposure of our errors, coupled with a patient  effort to reclaim us. \"By no means,\" said a highly respectable  deaconess, \"Brother Spencer, I would rather have heard that you were  dead.\" She knew in the general that I had embraced Mormonism; but of  the true character of Mormonism she was grossly ignorant; and she was  actually driven into fits when she found I defended the doctrines of  Latter-day Saints. Look at the conduct of devoted sectarians towards  the Latter-day Saints, and mark the resemblance to that of ancient Jews  to former Saints. The same proscriptive spirit reigns now as then,--  the same spirit that dictated expulsion from the synagogue then, now  closes the doors of meetinghouses against us,--the same spirit that  closed men's ears against the burning eloquence of Stephen then,  counsels men not to hear or go nigh Mormon preachers now.    You ask \"If the Latter-day Saints are persecuted; if so, by whom are  they persecuted?\" The answer is a painful one, because it inculpates  those who were bound to us by many tender ties. As a people we have  been truly persecuted from the beginning.    From the moment we embrace this doctrine, in most cases we are  virtually banished from friends, and rank, and station, and business.  Says the venerated father, \"if you have embraced that doctrine, my son,  I never want to see your face any more.\" Says the partner in trade, \"if  you are a Mormon, we must dissolve partnership forthwith.\" If such an  one occupying an important office of profit and honour does not give  up his Mormonism, we will sue him at the law, and calumniate him, and  embarrass him until he is ousted and broken up, and obliged to leave  our village. We are separated from men's company, while the licentious,  and profane, and intemperate are suffered to dwell in peace; while our  opposers cherish to their bosom the rankest infidels, they repulse _us_  with disdain; though none can point out ought wherein we differ from  the ancient apostles and prophets. Almost daily my eyes behold those  who have suffered too much to mention; but I would rather refer you to  printed documents, than to attempt a description of the sufferings of  our people in Missouri. From forty to sixty of our brethren suffered  death, by violent hands, in Missouri, and as many more, in consequence  of the abuse and privations to which they were exposed by an infuriated  and bloodthirsty mob; and the disappointment, privation, and homeless  condition of survivors was very great. Many widows and orphans knew not  what to do, having just begun to live in a comfortable and thriving  manner. They had almost forgotten their first sorrow of parting from  early friends and possessions, when lo! the hideous mob came upon them;  at one blow their homes were made desolate; in some instances father  and son were no more; their sufferings in planting themselves anew in  this State, without means or friends, though I have often heard them  told, I will not attempt to rehearse.    Perhaps some will say, we understand the Mormons were in fault in  that matter, and brought merited sufferings upon themselves by their  misconduct. The same has always been understood to be true of all  persecuted Saints. The "]]]
