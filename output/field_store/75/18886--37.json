Except when quite young, the chimpanzee is either nervous or  hysterical. After six years of age it is irritable and difficult  to manage. After seven years of age (puberty) it is rough,  domineering and dangerous. The male is given to shouting, yelling,  shrieking and roaring, and when quite angry rages like a demon. I  know of no wild animal that is more dangerous per pound than a  male chimpanzee over eight years of age. When young they do  wonders in trained performances, but when they reach maturity,  grow big of arm and shoulder, and masterfully strong, they quickly  become conscious of their strength. It is then that performing  chimpanzees become unruly, fly into sudden fits of temper, their  back hair bristles up, they stamp violently, and sometimes leap  into a terrorized orchestra. Next in order, they are retired  willy-nilly from the stage, and are offered for sale to zoological  parks and gardens having facilities for confinement and control.    The baboons are characteristically fierce and aggressive, and in a  wild state they live in troops, or even in herds of hundreds.  Being armed with powerful canine teeth and wolf-like jaws, they  are formidable antagonists, and other animals do not dare to  attack them. It is because of their natural weapons, their  readiness to fight like fiends, and their combined agility and  strength that the baboons have been able to live on the ground and  survive and flourish in lands literally reeking with lions,  leopards, hyenas and wild dogs. The awful canine teeth of an old  male baboon are quite as dangerous as those of any leopard, and  even the leopard's onslaught is less to be feared than the wild  rage of an adult baboon. In the Transvaal and Rhodesia, it is a  common occurrence for an ambitious dog to go after a troop of  baboons and never return.    Temperamentally the commoner groups of monkeys are thus  characterized:    The rhesus monkeys of India are nervous, irritable and dangerous.    The green monkeys of Africa are sanguine, but savage and  treacherous.    The langur monkeys of India are sanguine and peace-loving.    The macaques of the Far East vary from the sanguine temperament to  the combative.    The gibbons vary from sanguine to combative.    The lemurs of Madagascar are sanguine, affectionate and peaceful.    Nearly all South American monkeys are sanguine, and peace-loving,  and many are affectionate.    The species of the group of Carnivora are too numerous and too  diversified to be treated with any approach to completeness.  However, to illustrate this subject the leading species will be  noticed.    TEMPERAMENTS OF THE LARGE CARNIVORES    The lion is sanguine, courageous, confident, reposeful and very  reliable.    The tiger is nervous, suspicious, treacherous and uncertain.    The black and common leopards are nervous and combative,  irreconcilable and dangerous.    The snow leopard is sanguine, optimistic and peace-loving. The  puma is sanguine, good natured, quiet and peaceful.    The wolves are sanguine, crafty, dangerous and cruel.    The foxes are hysterical, timid and full of senseless fear.    The lynxes are sanguine, philosophic, and peaceful.    The mustelines are either nervous or hysterical, courageous,  savage, and even murderous.    The bears are so very interesting that it is well worth while to  consider the leading species separately. Possibly our conclusions  will reveal some unsuspected conditions.    BEAR TEMPERAMENTS, BY SPECIES. The polar bears are sanguine, but  in captivity they are courageous, treacherous and dangerous.    The Alaskan brown bears in captivity are sanguine, courageous,  peaceful and reliable, but in the wilds they are aggressive and  dangerous.    The grizzlies are nervous, keen, cautious, and seldom wantonly  aggressive.    The European brown bears are sanguine, optimistic and good-  natured.    The American black bears are sanguine and quiet, but very  treacherous.    The sloth bears of India are nervous or hysterical, and uncertain.    The Malay sun bears are hysterical, aggressive and evil-tempered.    The Japanese black bears are nervous, cowardly and aggressive.    To those who form and maintain large collections of bears,  involving much companionship in dens, it is necessary to keep a  watchful eye on the temperament chart.    THE DEER. In our Zoological Park establishment there is no  collection in which both the collective and the individual  equation is more troublesome than the deer family. In their  management, as with apes, monkeys and bears, it is necessary to  take into account the temperament not only of the species, but  also of each animal; and there are times when this necessity bears  hard upon human nerves. The proneness of captive deer to maim and  to kill themselves and each other calls for the utmost vigilance,  and for heroic endurance on the part of the deer keeper.    Even when a deer species has a fairly good record for common  sense, an individual may \"go crazy\" the instant a slightly new  situation arises. We have seen barasingha deer penned up between  shock-absorbing bales of hay seriously try to jump straight up  through a roof skylight nine feet from the floor. We have seen  park-bred axis deer break their own necks against wire fences,  with 100 per cent of stupidity.    CHARACTERS OF DEER SPECIES    The white-tailed deer is sanguine, but in the fall the bucks are  very aggressive and dangerous, and to be carefully avoided. The  mule deer is sanguine, reasonable and not particularly dangerous.    The elk is steady of nerve, and sanguine in temperament, but in  the rutting season the herd-masters are dangerous.    The fallow deer species has been toned down by a hundred  generations of park life, and it is very quiet, save when it is to  be captured and crated.    The axis deer is nervous, flighty, and difficult to handle.    The barasingha deer is hysterical and unaccountable.    The Indian and Malay sambar deer are lymphatic, confident,  tractable and easily handled.    Never keep a deer as a \"pet\" any longer than is necessary to place  it in a good home. All \"pet deer\" are dangerous, and should be  confined all the time. Never go into the range or corral of a deer  herd unless accompanied by the deer-keeper; and in the rutting  season do not go in at all.    The only thoroughly safe deer is a dead one; for even does can do  mischief. A SAMPLE OF NERVOUS TEMPERAMENT. As an example of  temperament in small carnivores, we will cite the coati mundi of  South America. It is one of the most nervous and restless animals  we know. An individual of sanguine temperament rarely is seen. Out  of about forty specimens with which we have been well acquainted,  I do not recall one that was as quiet and phlegmatic as the  raccoon, the nearest relative of _Nasua_. With a disposition  so restless and enterprising, and with such vigor of body and  mind, I count it strange that the genus _Nasua_ has not  spread all over our south-eastern states, where it is surely  fitted to exist in a state of nature even more successfully than  the raccoon or opossum.    The temper of the coati mundi is essentially quarrelsome and  aggressive. While young, they are reasonably peaceful, but when  they reach adult age, they become aggressive, and quarrels are  frequent. Separations then are very necessary, and it is rare  indeed that more than two adult individuals can be caged together.  Even when two only are kept together, quarrels and shrill  squealings are frequent. But they seldom hurt each other. The  coati is not a treacherous animal, it is not given to lying in  wait to make a covert attack from ambush, and being almost  constantly on the move, it is a good show animal.    THE STRANGE COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT OF THE GUANACO. In appearance  the guanaco is the personification of gentleness. Its placid  countenance indicates no guile, nor means of offense. Its lustrous  gazelle-like eyes, and its soft, woolly fleece suggest softness of  disposition. But in reality no animal is more deceptive. In a wild  state amongst its own kind, or in captivity,--no matter how  considerately treated,--it is a quarrelsome and at times  intractable animal. \"A pair of wild guanacos can often be seen or  heard engaged in desperate combat, biting and tearing, and rolling  over one another on the ground, uttering their gurgling, bubbling  cries of rage. Of a pair so engaged, I shot one whose tail had  then been bitten off in the encounter. In confinement, the guanaco  charges one with his chest, or rears up on his hind legs to strike  one with his fore-feet, besides biting and spitting up the  contents of the stomach.\"--Richard Crawshay in \"The Birds of Terra  del Fuego.\"    MENTAL TRAITS AND TEMPER OF THE ATLANTIC WALRUS    Mr. Langdon Gibson, of Schenectady, kindly wrote out for me the  following highly interesting observations on a remarkable arctic  animal with which we are but slightly acquainted:    \"In the summer of 1891, as a member of the first Peary Expedition  I had an opportunity of observing some of the traits of the  Atlantic walrus. I found him to be a real animal, of huge size,  with an extremely disagreeable temper and most belligerently  inclined. We hunted them in open whale-boats under the shadows of  Greenland's mountain-bound coast, in the Whale Sound region, Lat.  77 degrees North.    \"We hunted among animals never before molested, except by the  Eskimo who (so far as I was able to ascertain) hunt them only  during the winter season on the sea ice. We found animals whose  courage and belief in themselves and their prowess had hitherto  been unshaken by contact with the white man and his ingenious  devices of slaughter.    \"The walrus has a steady nerve and a thoroughly convincing roar.  They have fought their kind and the elements for centuries and  centuries, and know no fear. This, then, was the animal we sought  in order to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60708"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 4 (#4)"],[1," they fled from the violence  of Missouri militia-mobs, and found for a time a peaceful asylum in  Illinois. Many were the acts of disinterested kindness extended to  them by the people in the western part of that state; and every such  act I am sure was and is remembered, both by those who were the direct  recipients of such acts of kindness and by their grateful descendants.  But is responding to the calls of humanity so rare a thing in a  Christian state, that it must needs be regarded as so exceptional in  this case? Such was the condition of the Saints as they fled from  Missouri, such the injustice to which they had been subjected in that  state, that their situation would have appealed to the generosity of  savages, how much more, then, to a civilized and Christian community!  And then, speaking of this reception of the Saints _en masse_, by  Illinois, and leaving out of consideration {XX} for the moment--since  they have already been acknowledged--the individual acts of kindness  bestowed upon the exiles, was this reception of the Saints by Illinois  wholly disinterested? Were there not benefits which the Saints could  bestow upon the state in return for the heartiness of the reception  given? Would it not have been, under all the circumstances, the gravest  of blunders for Illinois to have refused asylum to these exiles? Is it  to be presumed that the public men of western Illinois were so blind to  their own interests as not to see in these twelve or fifteen thousand  people a mighty advantage to the state? It is true they were poor  in this world's goods; but they were rich in labor-power, and their  reputation for habits of sobriety and of industry had preceded them.  Here were thousands of husbandmen seeking lands. Illinois had thousands  of acres of unoccupied lands awaiting husbandmen. How shortsighted and  unstatesman-like it would have been for the men of Illinois not to have  welcomed these settlers into their state? With half an eye it is easy  to see that the benefits of this reception of the exiled Mormons by  Illinois is not by any means a one-sided affair; and it would be doing  an injustice to the intelligence of the people of that state to suppose  they were blind to these advantages. This will more fully appear when  other conditions are taken into account. Illinois has an area of 56,650  square miles; and at the time of the advent of the Saints in that state  a white population of less than four hundred thousand, [1] as against  a present population of five and a half millions. [2] It will be seen,  then, that in 1839, the year of the advent of the Saints into that  state, Illinois was very sparsely settled, and needed above all things  for her development and prosperity, people to subdue her wilderness  and cultivate her rich lands, especially people desirous of making  homes, and becoming permanent citizens. Moreover, Illinois had recently  launched an extensive system of internal improvements by state aid.  This system included the construction of 1,300 miles of railroads in  the state, besides provisions for the improvement of the navigation of  the Kaskaskia, Illinois, Great and Little Wabash, and Rock rivers. Also  the construction of a canal from Lake Michigan to the navigable waters  of the Illinois river, a distance of more than one hundred miles (from  Chicago to Peru). To carry out this system of internal improvements the  state legislature of 1836-7 had appropriated the sum of $12,000,000;  and to raise the money state bonds were placed on the stock markets of  the eastern states and in England. It is not my province here even to  note the wisdom or unwisdom of this policy of wholesale state aid for  these internal improvements; let the wisdom {XXI} or unwisdom be what  it may, these conditions emphasized Illinois' demand for population,  and again makes it evident that it would have been the height of folly  for the people of that state to do other than give hearty welcome to  this body of population so rich in labor-power; so potent in wealth  producing energy.    Another thing to be noted is the fact that about the time of the advent  of the Saints into Illinois, political parties were just taking form in  that state, and it is within the record of facts in the case, as well  as of great likelihood, that a desire for obtaining political advantage  was at least in the background of motives prompting the heartiness of  the reception given to the Saints.    Illinois was admitted into the Union in 1818, but it is a matter of  common knowledge that in the early years of her history as a state,  her officers were elected not on any well defined political party  principles, but chiefly on the strength of the personality of the  candidates and the special things for which they individually stood.  Indeed, it was not until 1830 that anything like party lines were  drawn in the state, and that it became a battle ground for the two  great national parties, Whigs and Democrats. It was a committee from  a Democratic party organization in Quincy, Illinois, that took the  initiative in welcoming the Saints into the state, and strive how one  may, it is difficult to think there was not some political advantage  sought through this action. On the other hand, the Whigs were not slow  to urge upon the incoming exiles that it was a Democratic state and a  Democratic administration in that state which had not only permitted,  but had really ordered their expulsion from Missouri, and that  doubtless the injustice they had suffered was owing to Democratic ideas  of the administration of government. Nor were there wanting those among  the Saints who were willing to believe that such was the case. Indeed,  Joseph Smith, the Prophet, found it necessary to gently reprove some of  his people who were rapidly making the question of their expulsion from  Missouri a political party question in Illinois. This effort to win the  Saints to one political party or the other, continued to be a factor  in their affairs so long as they remained at Nauvoo. It was owing to  this rivalry for their support that doubtless made it possible for the  Saints to obtain larger grants of power for their city government, and  greater political privileges and influence in the State than otherwise  could have been obtained by them. It also was this rivalry for their  favor, as the events in this, but more especially in the succeeding  volume will prove, that made them alternately fulsomely flattered and  heartily disliked; fawningly courted, and viciously betrayed.    A knowledge of these circumstances, I say, is essential to the right  understanding of the Nauvoo period of the Church's history.    {XXII} _The Founding of Nauvoo_.    The founding of the city of Nauvoo was an event, the interest of which  extends beyond the people immediately concerned in it. It was a unique  movement in its way, and may yet suggest a policy in reference to the  government of large cities from which great benefits may arise. Very  naturally after the experiences of the Mormon people in Missouri, the  Prophet was anxious to environ them with conditions that would insure  protection to the community, hence for Nauvoo he secured as large  concessions of political power as it was possible to obtain, and an  examination of the Nauvoo charter proper with its attendant charters  providing as they did for an independent educational system, from  common schools to a University; an independent military organization  with a lieutenant-general as its commander; [3] a large grant of  commercial as well as municipal power, demonstrates how well he  succeeded. Commenting upon the charter immediately after its passage  by the state legislature had been formally announced, he said: \"The  City Charter of Nauvoo is of my own plan and device. I concocted it for  the salvation of the Church, and on principles so broad, that every  honest man might dwell secure under its protective influence without  distinction of sect or party.\" [4] On another occasion when defending  the right of the city to issue writs of habeas corpus, even against  processes of the state, he held: \"If there is not power in our charter  and courts, then there is not power in the State of Illinois nor in  the Congress or Constitution of the United States; for the United  States gave unto Illinois her Constitution or Charter, and Illinois  gave unto Nauvoo her charters conceding unto us our vested rights  which she has no right or power to take from us. All the power there  was in Illinois she gave to Nauvoo. * * * The municipal court has all  the power to issue and determine writs of habeas corpus within the  limits of this state that the {XXIII} Legislature can confer. This city  has all the power that the State courts have, and was given by the  same authority--the legislature. * * * The charter says that the City  Council shall have power and authority to make, ordain, establish, and  execute such ordinances not repugnant to the Constitution of the United  States, or of this State, as they may deem necessary for the peace,  benefit and safety of the inhabitants of said city. [5] And also that  the Municipal Court shall have power to grant writs of habeas corpus in  all cases arising under the ordinances of the City Council. The City  Council have passed an ordinance 'that no citizen of this city shall be  taken out of this city by any writ without the privilege of a writ of  habeas corpus.' There is nothing but what we have power over, except  where restricted by the Constitution of the United States. 'But,' says  the mob, 'what dangerous powers!' Yes--dangerous, because they will  protect the innocent and put down mobocrats. There is nothing but  what we have power over, except where restricted by the Constitution  of the United States. * * * If these powers are dangerous, then the  Constitution of the United States, and of this State are dangerous; but  they are not dangerous to good "]]]
