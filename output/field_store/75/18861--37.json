He likewise stated that soon after the rumor so widely spread regarding  \"Joe\" Smith finding a gold bible, that there was great excitement  throughout the whole country, and that it was about this time the  Rochester Company located and searched for hidden treasure.    Questioning him closely he stated that he had seen some good-sized flat  stones that had rolled down and lay near the bottom of the hill. This  had occurred after the contents of the box had been removed and these  stones were doubtless the ones that formerly composed the box. I felt a  strong desire to see these ancient relics and told him I would be much  pleased to have him inform me where they were to be found. He stated  that they had long since been taken away. He further said that he knew  \"Joe\" Smith as a \"money digger\" and a \"visionary man\" and Martin Harris  as an honest reliable farmer. Joseph in his history says that he worked  in a mine for Mr. Stowel, hunting for hidden treasures, at fourteen  dollars per month, hence his name as a money-digger. I then inquired  if he ever knew Joseph Smith to be convicted of crime. He replied  that he had not known him as having been convicted. The surrounding  scenery, which embraced a young grove of beech, sugar maple, hickory,  oak, bass-wood, etc., covering about five acres of ground, was very  beautiful. The grove is about 200 yards southwest of where the plates  were found. There was a fine, well-cultivated field of grain on the  hillside. My loquacious guide showed me another and much deeper cavity  made on the east side of the hill by the above-named Rochester treasure  seekers, a company of prospectors. They said that science aided by  mineral rods did not lie and that most assuredly there were rich  treasures concealed in the hill, and they were determined to have them.  But with all their science and laborious excavations they failed to get  a glimpse of the coveted treasures and returned to their homes if not  richer, at least it is to be hoped wiser men, for the only results of  their efforts were the holes they left on the hillside. Notwithstanding  this, there are strong and feasible reasons for believing that there is  abundance of treasure hid up in Cumorah, but it is guarded by the hand  of the Lord and none shall ever possess it until made known in the due  time of the Lord. The great and mighty nation of the Jaredites, having  departed from God and shed the blood of the prophets, became divided  into bloodthirsty factions, who waged relentless and merciless wars  against each other for many years; finally, after millions were slain,  they arrayed themselves into two mighty opposing armies and mutually  agreed to give each other four years in which to gather their entire  forces of men, women and children around Ramah, and there make one last  appalling death struggle for victory, but so well were these colossal  armies matched in numbers, valor, fury and hatred that they continued  to fight day after day till both sides were completely destroyed from  the face of the land. One man of all these great and mighty armies  alone remained alive. Ere they begin the dreadful carnage, they made  excavations and hid up in Ramah their immense treasures.    The Lord again peopled the land and they too became haughty and lifted  up in the pride of their hearts, renounced God and slew his prophets,  and division, war and bloodshed again filled the land with horror.  Once more were immense hosts arrayed into two great armies, the one  called the Nephites, the other the Lamanites, and strange to say they  also marshalled their forces, and undertook to make one last death  struggle for victory or death. The battle ceased when the Nephites  were destroyed, and again millions lay dead upon the fatal ground. The  Jaredites' Ramah was the Nephites' Cumorah, and their ashes commingle  and repose in death. Ere this last horrid conflict commenced, they,  too, hid their untold treasures in this HIll Cumorah, and it was said  by President Young at Farmington, Davis Co., Utah, June 17, 1877, just  two months and twelve days before his death:    \"There were a great many treasures hid up by the Nephites. * * * I  lived right in the country where the plates were found from which  the Book of Mormon was translated, and I know a great many things  pertaining to that country. I believe I will take the liberty to tell  you of another circumstance that will be as marvelous as anything can  be. This is an incident in the life of Oliver Cowdery, but he did not  take the liberty of telling such things in meeting as I take. I tell  these things to you, and I have a motive for doing so. I want to carry  them to the ears of my brethren and sisters, and the children also,  that they may grow to an understanding of some things that seem to  be entirely hidden from the human family. Oliver Cowdery went with  the Prophet Joseph when he deposited these plates. Joseph did not  translate all of the plates: there was a portion of these sealed which  you can learn from the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. When Joseph got  the plates, the angel instructed him to carry them back to the Hill  Cumorah, which he did. Oliver says that when Joseph and Oliver went  there, the hill opened, and they walked into a cave, in which there was  a large and spacious room. * * * They laid the plates on a table; it  was a large table that stood in the room. Under this table there was a  pile of plates as much as two feet high, and there were altogether in  this room more plates than probably many wagon loads; they were piled  up in the corners and along the walls. * * * I tell you this as coming  not only from Oliver Cowdery, but others who were familiar with it. *  * * I relate this to you, and I want you to understand it. I take this  liberty of referring to these things so that they will not be forgotten  and lost.    \"Carlos Smith was a young man of as much veracity as any young man  we had, and he was a witness to these things. Samuel Smith saw some  things, Hyrum saw a good many things, but Joseph was the leader. Now,  you may think I am unwise in publicly telling these things, thinking  perhaps I should preserve them in my own breast; but such is not my  mind. I would like the people called Latter-day Saints to understand  some little things with regard to the workings and dealings of the Lord  with his people here upon the earth.\"_--Journal of Discourses, Vol. 19,  p. 36._    It was likewise stated to me by David Whitmer in the year 1877 that  Oliver Cowdery told him that the Prophet Joseph and himself had seen  this room and that it was filled with treasure, and on a table therein  were the breastplate and the sword of Laban, as well as the portion of  gold plates not yet translated, and that these plates were bound by  three small gold rings, and would also be translated, as was the first  portion in the days of Joseph. When they are translated much useful  information will be brought to light. But till that day arrives, no  Rochester adventurers shall ever see them or the treasures, although  science and mineral rods testify that they are there. At the proper  time when greed, selfishness and corruption shall cease to reign in the  hearts of the people, these vast hoards of hidden treasure shall be  brought forth to be used for the cause and kingdom of Jesus Christ.    Changing the scene once more another prophet, whose name was  Mormon, stood on the summit of this hill. At that time a great and  fierce battle was fought. After the conclusion of the battle, which  occurred about 1472 years ago, Mormon's grief was expressed on this  heart-rending and doleful scene as found on page 560 of their history  in the Book of Mormon. We will here again refer to the great battle of  the Lamanites and Nephites:     \"And when they had gone through and hewn down all my people save it   were twenty and four of us, (among whom was my son Moroni) and we   having survived the dead of our people, did behold on the morrow, * * *   from the top of the hill Cumorah, the ten thousand of my people who   were hewn down, being led in the front by me. And we also beheld the   ten thousand of my people who were led by my son Moroni.\" (Mormon   6:11-12)    And other generals are named who led each their ten thousand until we  reach the enormous number of two hundred and thirty thousand men, with  their wives and children, who were strewn around this most marvelous  hill:     \"And their flesh, and bones, and blood lay upon the face of the earth,   * * * to moulder upon the land, and to crumble and to return to their   mother earth. And my soul was rent with anguish, because of the slain   of my people, and I cried: O ye fair ones, how could ye have departed   from the ways of the Lord! O ye fair ones, how could ye have rejected   that _Jesus,_ who stood with open arms to receive you! Behold, if   ye had not done this, ye would not have fallen. But behold, ye are   fallen, and I mourn your loss. O ye fair sons and daughters, ye   fathers and mothers, ye husbands and wives, ye fair ones, how is it   that ye could have fallen! But behold, ye are gone, and my sorrows   cannot bring your return. And the day soon cometh that your mortal   must put on immortality, and these bodies which are now mouldering in   corruption must soon become incorruptible bodies; and then ye must   stand before the judgment seat of Christ, to be judged according to   your works; and if it so be that ye are righteous, then are ye blessed   with your fathers who have gone before you. O that ye had repented   before this great destruction had come upon you. But behold, ye are   gone, and the Father of heaven knoweth your state, and He doeth with   you according to His justice and mercy.\"     Before leaving the prophet Mormon standing on the hill in his   lamentation, let us still extend the vision over the great   battlefield, calling to mind that the 230,000 men were all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/544"],[0,"Anne's House of Dreams (#4)"],[1," going to be married  yourself, Miss Shirley, ma'am?  I always thought I'd like to marry a  doctor.  It would be so handy when the children had measles and croup.  Tom is only a bricklayer, but he's real good-tempered.  When I said to  him, says I, 'Tom, can I go to Miss Shirley's wedding?  I mean to go  anyhow, but I'd like to have your consent,' he just says, 'Suit  yourself, Charlotta, and you'll suit me.'  That's a real pleasant kind  of husband to have, Miss Shirley, ma'am.\"    Philippa and her Reverend Jo arrived at Green Gables the day before the  wedding.  Anne and Phil had a rapturous meeting which presently  simmered down to a cosy, confidential chat over all that had been and  was about to be.    \"Queen Anne, you're as queenly as ever.  I've got fearfully thin since  the babies came.  I'm not half so good-looking; but I think Jo likes  it.  There's not such a contrast between us, you see.  And oh, it's  perfectly magnificent that you're going to marry Gilbert.  Roy Gardner  wouldn't have done at all, at all.  I can see that now, though I was  horribly disappointed at the time.  You know, Anne, you did treat Roy  very badly.\"    \"He has recovered, I understand,\" smiled Anne.    \"Oh, yes.  He is married and his wife is a sweet little thing and  they're perfectly happy.  Everything works together for good.  Jo and  the Bible say that, and they are pretty good authorities.\"    \"Are Alec and Alonzo married yet?\"    \"Alec is, but Alonzo isn't.  How those dear old days at Patty's Place  come back when I'm talking to you, Anne!  What fun we had!\"    \"Have you been to Patty's Place lately?\"    \"Oh, yes, I go often.  Miss Patty and Miss Maria still sit by the  fireplace and knit.  And that reminds me--we've brought you a wedding  gift from them, Anne.  Guess what it is.\"    \"I never could.  How did they know I was going to be married?\"    \"Oh, I told them.  I was there last week.  And they were so interested.  Two days ago Miss Patty wrote me a note asking me to call; and then she  asked if I would take her gift to you.  What would you wish most from  Patty's Place, Anne?\"    \"You can't mean that Miss Patty has sent me her china dogs?\"    \"Go up head.  They're in my trunk this very moment.  And I've a letter  for you.  Wait a moment and I'll get it.\"    \"Dear Miss Shirley,\" Miss Patty had written, \"Maria and I were very  much interested in hearing of your approaching nuptials.  We send you  our best wishes.  Maria and I have never married, but we have no  objection to other people doing so.  We are sending you the china dogs.  I intended to leave them to you in my will, because you seemed to have  sincere affection for them.  But Maria and I expect to live a good  while yet (D.V.), so I have decided to give you the dogs while you are  young.  You will not have forgotten that Gog looks to the right and  Magog to the left.\"    \"Just fancy those lovely old dogs sitting by the fireplace in my house  of dreams,\" said Anne rapturously.  \"I never expected anything so  delightful.\"    That evening Green Gables hummed with preparations for the following  day; but in the twilight Anne slipped away.  She had a little  pilgrimage to make on this last day of her girlhood and she must make  it alone.  She went to Matthew's grave, in the little poplar-shaded  Avonlea graveyard, and there kept a silent tryst with old memories and  immortal loves.    \"How glad Matthew would be tomorrow if he were here,\" she whispered.  \"But I believe he does know and is glad of it--somewhere else.  I've  read somewhere that 'our dead are never dead until we have forgotten  them.' Matthew will never be dead to me, for I can never forget him.\"    She left on his grave the flowers she had brought and walked slowly  down the long hill.  It was a gracious evening, full of delectable  lights and shadows.  In the west was a sky of mackerel clouds--crimson  and amber-tinted, with long strips of apple-green sky between.  Beyond  was the glimmering radiance of a sunset sea, and the ceaseless voice of  many waters came up from the tawny shore.  All around her, lying in the  fine, beautiful country silence, were the hills and fields and woods  she had known and loved so long.    \"History repeats itself,\" said Gilbert, joining her as she passed the  Blythe gate.  \"Do you remember our first walk down this hill, Anne--our  first walk together anywhere, for that matter?\"    \"I was coming home in the twilight from Matthew's grave--and you came  out of the gate; and I swallowed the pride of years and spoke to you.\"    \"And all heaven opened before me,\" supplemented Gilbert.  \"From that  moment I looked forward to tomorrow.  When I left you at your gate that  night and walked home I was the happiest boy in the world.  Anne had  forgiven me.\"    \"I think you had the most to forgive.  I was an ungrateful little  wretch--and after you had really saved my life that day on the pond,  too.  How I loathed that load of obligation at first!  I don't deserve  the happiness that has come to me.\"    Gilbert laughed and clasped tighter the girlish hand that wore his  ring.  Anne's engagement ring was a circlet of pearls.  She had refused  to wear a diamond.    \"I've never really liked diamonds since I found out they weren't the  lovely purple I had dreamed.  They will always suggest my old  disappointment.\"    \"But pearls are for tears, the old legend says,\" Gilbert had objected.    \"I'm not afraid of that.  And tears can be happy as well as sad.  My  very happiest moments have been when I had tears in my eyes--when  Marilla told me I might stay at Green Gables--when Matthew gave me the  first pretty dress I ever had--when I heard that you were going to  recover from the fever.  So give me pearls for our troth ring, Gilbert,  and I'll willingly accept the sorrow of life with its joy.\"    But tonight our lovers thought only of joy and never of sorrow.  For  the morrow was their wedding day, and their house of dreams awaited  them on the misty, purple shore of Four Winds Harbor.        CHAPTER 4    THE FIRST BRIDE OF GREEN GABLES    Anne wakened on the morning of her wedding day to find the sunshine  winking in at the window of the little porch gable and a September  breeze frolicking with her curtains.    \"I'm so glad the sun will shine on me,\" she thought happily.    She recalled the first morning she had wakened in that little porch  room, when the sunshine had crept in on her through the blossom-drift  of the old Snow Queen.  That had not been a happy wakening, for it  brought with it the bitter disappointment of the preceding night.  But  since then the little room had been endeared and consecrated by years  of happy childhood dreams and maiden visions.  To it she had come back  joyfully after all her absences; at its window she had knelt through  that night of bitter agony when she believed Gilbert dying, and by it  she had sat in speechless happiness the night of her betrothal.  Many  vigils of joy and some of sorrow had been kept there; and today she  must leave it forever.  Henceforth it would be hers no more;  fifteen-year-old Dora was to inherit it when she had gone.  Nor did  Anne wish it otherwise; the little room was sacred to youth and  girlhood--to the past that was to close today before the chapter of  wifehood opened.    Green Gables was a busy and joyous house that forenoon.  Diana arrived  early, with little Fred and Small Anne Cordelia, to lend a hand.  Davy  and Dora, the Green Gables twins, whisked the babies off to the garden.    \"Don't let Small Anne Cordelia spoil her clothes,\" warned Diana  anxiously.    \"You needn't be afraid to trust her with Dora,\" said Marilla.  \"That  child is more sensible and careful than most of the mothers I've known.  She's really a wonder in some ways.  Not much like that other  harum-scarum I brought up.\"    Marilla smiled across her chicken salad at Anne.  It might even be  suspected that she liked the harum-scarum best after all.    \"Those twins are real nice children,\" said Mrs. Rachel, when she was  sure they were out of earshot.  \"Dora is so womanly and helpful, and  Davy is developing into a very smart boy.  He isn't the holy terror for  mischief he used to be.\"    \"I never was so distracted in my life as I was the first six months he  was here,\" acknowledged Marilla.  \"After that I suppose I got used to  him.  He's taken a great notion to farming lately, and wants me to let  him try running the farm next year.  I may, for Mr. Barry doesn't think  he'll want to rent it much longer, and some new arrangement will have  to be made.\"    \"Well, you certainly have a lovely day for your wedding, Anne,\" said  Diana, as she slipped a voluminous apron over her silken array.  \"You  couldn't have had a finer one if you'd ordered it from Eaton's.\"    \"Indeed, there's too much money going out of this Island to that same  Eaton's,\" said Mrs. Lynde indignantly.  She had strong views on the  subject of octopus-like department stores, and never lost an  opportunity of airing them.  \"And as for those catalogues of theirs,  they're the Avonlea girls' Bible now, that's what.  They pore over them  on Sundays instead of studying the Holy Scriptures.\"    \"Well, they're splendid to amuse children with,\" said Diana.  \"Fred and  Small Anne look at the pictures by the hour.\"    \"_I_ amused ten children without the aid of Eaton's catalogue,\" said  Mrs. Rachel severely.    \"Come, you two, don't quarrel over Eaton's catalogue,\" said Anne gaily.  \"This is my day of days, you know.  I'm so happy I want every one else  to be happy, too.\"    \"I'm sure I hope your happiness will last, child,\" sighed Mrs. Rachel.  She did hope it truly, and believed it, but she was afraid it was in  the nature of a challenge to Providence to flaunt your happiness too  openly.  Anne, for her own good, must be toned down a trifle.    But it was a happy and beautiful bride who came down the old,  homespun-carpeted stairs that September noon--the first bride of Green"]]]
