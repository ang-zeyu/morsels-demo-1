The  \"coagulum,\" as it is called, is like snow-white dough. It is removed  from the vats and run in sheets through machines which squeeze out  the moisture and imprint on them a criss-cross pattern to expose as  large a surface as possible to the air.      [3] See picture, page 12.      These sheets of rubber are then hung in smoke houses and smoked  from eight to fourteen days in much the same way that we smoke  hams and bacon. After being dried in this way they are pressed  into bales or packed in boxes ready for shipment.          CHAPTER 8    A LAST WORD      It would be an adventure to follow a bale of plantation rubber as,  carefully boxed or wrapped in burlap, it starts on its long and  picturesque journey. Bullock carts, railroads, boats and steamers  bring it at last to one of the world markets, Singapore, Colombo,  London, Amsterdam or New York, where it is bought by dealers, and  then sold to factories which make rubber goods.    An equally fascinating story might be told of its progress through  the factory, how it is kneaded and rolled, mixed with chemicals,  rubbed into fabrics, baked in ovens, and finally emerges as any  one of the tens of thousands of articles that are made wholly or  partly from rubber.    Rubber manufacturing is peculiarly an American industry. South  America gave us the original rubber trees, and the one man who,  more than any other, was responsible for making rubber useful was  the American, Charles Goodyear. To-day, two-thirds of the entire  output of rubber is sold to the United States, whose manufactured  rubber goods set the standard for the whole world.    In spite of the wonders which rubber has already accomplished, and  the adventures, which have colored its history, only the beginning  of the romance of rubber has been told. The plantation industry is  still in its infancy, and experiments are constantly being made to  determine the best methods of planting, the most fruitful number  of trees to the acre, the most advantageous way of tapping. In the  laboratories of the great rubber manufacturers, scientists are at  work improving old methods of using rubber and devising new ones.    Rubber is a substance of so many important characteristics that  its uses are countless. It is used for certain purposes because it  stretches, for others because it is airtight and watertight, for  others because it is a non-conductor of electricity, for others  because it is shock-absorbing, and for others because it is  adhesive.    It is on rubber that infants cut their teeth; after all the teeth  are gone old age makes use of rubber in plates for false teeth.  Ten million motorists and other millions of cyclists in the United  States ride on rubber tires that are durable, noiseless and  airtight. Balloons of rubber float aloft, and huge submarines plow  their routes beneath the ocean's surface propelled by electricity  stored in great rubber cells. Sheathed in rubber, the lightning  makes a peaceful way through our homes, offices and factories,  furnishing light and telephone service. Divers sink out of sight  beneath the waves in rubber suits. Rubber air-brake hose on  railroad trains makes safe the travel of a nation, air-drill hose  rivets our ships, fire hose protects the properly in city and town  and garden hose brings nourishment to our growing plants. Rubber  clothing protects against storm and rubber footwear guards us  against cold and wet. Tennis balls and golf balls and rubber-cored  baseballs give healthful sport to the millions. In hospitals and  medical work the uses of rubber are without number.    To select the most important use to which rubber is put would be  difficult. One student of the subject says:    \"Of all the applications of rubber, that of packing for the steam  engine and connecting machinery appears to have been the most  important, as it has been an essential condition of the  development and extended use of steam as a motive power.\"    Even as you read this, rubber may be in the act of performing some  new magic, some fresh service to mankind. And who knows which one  of us will, in the years to come, write a chapter in the story of  rubber more thrilling than we are able to imagine to-day!          A REVIEW AND QUESTIONS      1.

For instance, to represent  \"all y' are m'\" we should mark the     -------  RIGHT-HAND UPRIGHT OBLONG (the one    |       |  that has the attribute y') thus:--    |---    |                                        | 0 |   |                                        |---|-1-|                                        | 0 |   |                                        |---    |                                        |       |                                         -------    and, if we were told to interpret the lower half of the cupboard,  marked as follows, with regard to x and y,                         -------------------                    |   |     |     |   |                    |   |     |  0  |   |                    |   |     |     |   |                    |    -----|-----    |                    | 1       |       0 |                     -------------------      we should transfer it to the smaller Diagram thus,                            -----------                       |     |     |                       |  1  |  0  |                       |     |     |                        -----------      and read it \"all x' are y.\"    Two more remarks about Propositions need to be made.    One is that, in every Proposition beginning with \"some\" or \"all\",  the ACTUAL EXISTENCE of the 'Subject' is asserted.  If, for instance,  I say \"all misers are selfish,\" I mean that misers ACTUALLY EXIST.  If I wished to avoid making this assertion, and merely to state  the LAW that miserliness necessarily involves selfishness, I should  say \"no misers are unselfish\" which does not assert that any misers  exist at all, but merely that, if any DID exist, they WOULD be  selfish.    The other is that, when a Proposition begins with \"some\" or \"no\",  and contains more that two Attributes, these Attributes may be  re-arranged, and shifted from one Term to the other, \"ad libitum.\"  For example, \"some abc are def\" may be re-arranged as \"some bf are  acde,\" each being equivalent to \"some Things are abcdef\".  Again \"No  wise old men are rash and reckless gamblers\" may be re-arranged as  \"No rash old gamblers are wise and reckless,\" each being equivalent  to \"No men are wise old rash reckless gamblers.\"        2.  Syllogisms      Now suppose we divide our Universe of Things in three ways, with regard  to three different Attributes.  Out of these three Attributes, we  may make up three different couples (for instance, if they were a,  b, c, we might make up the three couples ab, ac, bc).  Also suppose  we have two Propositions given us, containing two of these three  couples, and that from them we can prove a third Proposition containing  the third couple.  (For example, if we divide our Universe for m,  x, and y; and if we have the two Propositions given us, \"no m are  x'\" and \"all m' are y\", containing the two couples mx and my, it  might be possible to prove from them a third Proposition, containing  x and y.)    In such a case we call the given Propositions 'THE PREMISSES', the  third one 'THE CONCLUSION' and the whole set 'A SYLLOGISM'.    Evidently, ONE of the Attributes must occur in both Premisses; or  else one must occur in ONE Premiss, and its CONTRADICTORY in the  other.    In the first case (when, for example, the Premisses are \"some m  are x\" and \"no m are y'\") the Term, which occurs twice, is called  'THE MIDDLE TERM', because it serves as a sort of link between the  other two Terms.    In the second case (when, for example, the Premisses are \"no  m are x'\" and \"all m' are y\") the two Terms, which contain these  contradictory Attributes, may be called 'THE MIDDLE TERMS'.    Thus, in the first case, the class of \"m-Things\" is the Middle  Term; and, in the second case, the two classes of \"m-Things\" and  \"m'-Things\" are the Middle Terms.    The Attribute, which occurs in the Middle Term or Terms, disappears  in the Conclusion, and is said to be \"eliminated\", which literally  means \"turned out of doors\".    Now let us try to draw a Conclusion from the two Premisses--              \"Some new Cakes are unwholesome;             No nice Cakes are unwholesome.\"    In order to express them with counters, we need to divide Cakes in  THREE different ways, with regard to newness, to niceness, and to  wholesomeness.  For this we must use the larger Diagram, making x  mean \"new\", y \"nice\", and m \"wholesome\".  (Everything INSIDE the  central Square is supposed to have the attribute m, and everything  OUTSIDE it the attribute m', i.e. \"not-m\".)    You had better adopt the rule to make m mean the Attribute which  occurs in the MIDDLE Term or Terms.  (I have chosen m as the symbol,  because 'middle' begins with 'm'.)    Now, in representing the two Premisses, I prefer to begin with the  NEGATIVE one (the one beginning with \"no\"), because GREY counters  can always be placed with CERTAINTY, and will then help to fix the  position of the red counters, which are sometimes a little uncertain  where they will be most welcome.    Let us express, the \"no nice Cakes are unwholesome (Cakes)\", i.e.  \"no y-Cakes are m'-(Cakes)\".  This tells us that none of the Cakes  belonging to the y-half of the cupboard are in its m'-compartments  (i.e. the ones outside the central Square).  Hence the two compartments,  No. 9 and No. 15, are both 'EMPTY'; and we must place a grey counter  in EACH of them, thus:--                          -----------                     |0    |     |                     |   --|--   |                     |  |  |  |  |                     |--|-----|--|                     |  |  |  |  |                     |   --|--   |                     |0    |     |                      -----------      We have now to express the other Premiss, namely, \"some new Cakes  are unwholesome (Cakes)\", i.e.  \"some x-Cakes are m'-(Cakes)\".  This  tells us that some of the Cakes in the x-half of the cupboard are  in its m'-compartments.  Hence ONE of the two compartments, No.  9 and No. 10, is 'occupied': and, as we are not told in WHICH of  these two compartments to place the red counter, the usual rule  would be to lay it on the division-line between them: but, in this  case, the other Premiss has settled the matter for us, by declaring  No. 9 to be EMPTY.  Hence the red counter has no choice, and MUST  go into No. 10, thus:--                          -----------                     |0    |    1|                     |   --|--   |                     |  |  |  |  |                     |--|-----|--|                     |  |  |  |  |                     |   --|--   |                     |0    |     |                      -----------      And now what counters will this information enable us to place in  the SMALLER Diagram, so as to get some Proposition involving x and  y only, leaving out m?  Let us take its four compartments, one by  one.    First, No. 5.  All we know about THIS is that its OUTER portion  is empty: but we know nothing about its inner portion.  Thus the  Square MAY be empty, or it MAY have something in it.  Who can tell?  So we dare not place ANY counter in this Square.    Secondly, what of No. 6?  Here we are a little better off.  We  know that there is SOMETHING in it, for there is a red counter in  its outer portion.  It is true we do not know whether its inner  portion is empty or occupied: but what does THAT matter?  One solitary  Cake, in one corner of the Square, is quite sufficient excuse for  saying \"THIS SQUARE IS OCCUPIED\", and for marking it with a red  counter.    As to No. 7, we are in the same condition as with No. 5--we find  it PARTLY 'empty', but we do not know whether the other part is  empty or occupied: so we dare not mark this Square.    And as to No. 8, we have simply no information at all.    The result is                         -------                      |   | 1 |                      |---|---|                      |   |   |                       -------      Our 'Conclusion', then, must be got out of the rather meager piece  of information that there is a red counter in the xy'-Square.  Hence our Conclusion is \"some x are y' \", i.e. \"some new Cakes are  not-nice (Cakes)\": or, if you prefer to take y' as your Subject,  \"some not-nice Cakes are new (Cakes)\"; but the other looks neatest.    We will now write out the whole Syllogism, putting the symbol  &there4[*] for \"therefore\", and omitting \"Cakes\", for the sake of  brevity, at the end of each Proposition.    [*][NOTE from Brett:  The use of \"&there4\" is a rather arbitrary  selection.  There is no font available in general practice  which renders the \"therefore\" symbol correction (three dots in a  triangular formation).  This can be done, however, in HTML, so if  this document is read in a browser, then the symbol will be properly  recognized.  This is a poor man's excuse.]              \"Some new Cakes are unwholesome;             No nice Cakes are unwholesome             &there4 Some new Cakes are not-nice.\"    And you have now worked out, successfully, your first 'SYLLOGISM'.  Permit me to congratulate you, and to express the hope that it is  but the beginning of a long and glorious series of similar victories!    We will work out one other Syllogism--a rather harder one than the  last--and then, I think, you may be safely left to play the Game  by yourself, or (better) with any friend whom you can find, that  is able and willing to take a share in the sport.    Let us see what we can make of the two Premisses--                    \"All Dragons are uncanny;                 All Scotchmen are canny.\"      Remember, I don't guarantee the Premisses to be FACTS.  In the  first place, I never even saw a Dragon: and, in the second place,  it isn't of the slightest consequence to us, as LOGICIANS, whether  our Premisses are true or false: all WE have to do is to make out  whether they LEAD LOGICALLY TO THE CONCLUSION, so that, if THEY  were true,"]]]
