Self-interests had held her  attention from girlhood to her wreckage, and from this grew self-  study, which later degenerated into self-pity. Her converse was of  food and feelings and self. She bored all she met, for self alone was  expressed in actions and words.    Father and daughter finally, under the pretext of a trip for her  health, placed her in a Southern sanitarium. Much was done here for  her, in the face of her protest. Illustrative of the unreasoning  intensity with which fear had laid hold upon her was her mortal dread  of grape-seeds. As she was again being taught to eat rationally,  grapes were ordered for her morning meal. The nurse noticed that with  painful care she separated each seed from the pulp, and explained to  her the value of grape-seeds in her case. She wisely did not argue  with the nurse, but two mornings later she was discovered ejecting and  secreting the seeds. The physician then kindly and earnestly appealed  for her intelligent cooperation. She thereupon admitted that many  years ago a neighbor's boy had died of appendicitis, which the doctor  said was caused by a grape-seed. The fallacy of these early-day  opinions was shown her. Then was illustrated the weakness of her faith  and the strength of her fear. She produced a draft for one thousand  dollars, which she said she always carried for unforeseen emergencies,  and offered it to the doctor to use for charity or as he wished, if he  would change the order about the grapes. Suffice it to say she learned  to eat Concords, Catawbas, Tokays and Malagas. She returned home  better, but was never wholesomely well, and to-day dreads the death  for which her family wait with unconscious patience.    What is the secret of this miserable old woman's failure to adjust  herself to the richness which life offered her? A selfish self peers  out from every act. Even her generosity to Fred was the pleasing of  self. Given all that she had, what could she not have been!  Physically, with the advantages of plenty and her country life and the  promise of her fair girlhood, what attraction could not have been hers  had kindness and generosity softened her eyes, tinted her cheeks, and  love-wrinkles come instead of worry-wrinkles.    Her mind was naturally an unusual one. She lived within driving  distance of one of Ohio's largest colleges--only an hour by train to  the state capital. Fortune had truly smiled and selected her for  happiness, but from the first it was self or her family and no further  thought or plan or consideration.    Elizabeth Clayton was given a nervous system of superb quality, which  used for the good of those she touched would have hallowed her life;  misused, she drifts into unlovable old age, a selfish neurotic. She  could have been a leader in her community, a blessing in her  generation, a builder of faiths which do not die, but she failed to  choose the good part which neither loss of servant, death of child nor  advancing age can take away.          CHAPTER III    THE PRICE OF NERVOUSNESS      The price we pay for defective nerves is one of mankind's big burdens.  Humanity reaches its vaunted supremacy, it realizes the heights of  manhood and womanhood through its power to meet what the day brings,  to collect the best therefrom and to fit itself profitably to use that  best for the good of its kind. And these possibilities are all  dependent on the superb, complicated nervous system. The miracles of  right and wise living are rooted deep in the nerve-centers. Man's  nervous system is his adjusting mechanism--his indicator revealing the  proper methods of reaction. Nothing man will ever make can rival its  sensitiveness and capacity. But when it is out of order, trouble is  certain. Excessive, imperfect, inadequate reactions will occur and  disintegrating forms of response to ourselves and our surroundings  will certainly become habitual, unless wise and resolute readjustments  are made. The common failure of the many to find the best, even the  good in life, is apparent to all--so common indeed, that the search  for the perfectly adjusted man, physically, mentally, morally  adjusted, is about as fruitful as Diogenes' daylight excursions with  his lantern. The physical, mental and moral are intricately related  even as the primary colors in the rainbow. Our nerves enter intimately  into every feeling, thought, act of life, into every function of our  bodies, into every aspiration of our souls. They determine our  digestion and our destinies; they may even influence the destinies of  others. Let us turn a few pages of a life and see the cost of  defective nervous-living.    The Pullman was crowded; every berth had been sold; the train was  loaded with holiday travelers, and the ever interesting bridal couple  had the drawing-room. The aisle was cluttered with valises and  suitcases; the porter was feverishly making down a berth; while  bolstered on a pile of pillows, surrounded by a number of anxious  faces, lay the sick woman, the source of the commotion and the  anxiety. Sobs followed groans, and exclamations followed sobs--  apparently only an intense effort of self-control kept her from  screaming. She held her head. Periodically, it seemed to relieve her  to tear at her hair. She held her breath, she clutched her throat, she  covered her eyes as though she would shut out every glimpse of life.  She convulsively pressed her heart to keep it from bursting through;  she clasped and wrung her hands, and now and then would crowd her  forearm between her teeth to shut in her pent-up anguish. She would  have thrown herself from the seat but for the unobtrusive little man  who knelt in front to keep her from falling, and gently held her on as  she spasmodically writhed. His plain, unromantic face showed deep  anxiety, not unmixed with fear. He was eagerly assisted by the dear  old lady who sat in front. Hers was mother-heart clear through; her  satchel had been disturbed to the depths in her search for remedies  long faithful in alleviating ministration; her camphor bottle lay on  the floor, impulsively struck from her kind hand by the convulsed  woman. The sweet-faced college girl who sat opposite had just finished  a year in physiology and this was her first opportunity to use her new  knowledge. \"Loosen her collar and lower her head and let her have more  air,\" she advised. \"Yes,\" said the little man, \"I'm her husband you  see, and am a doctor. I've seen her this way before and those things  don't help.\"    The drummer, who had the upper berth, had retreated at the first sign  of trouble to the safety of the smoking-room, and was apparently  trying more completely to hide himself in clouds of obscuring cigar  smoke. The passengers were all cowed into attentive quietude; the  sympathetic had offered their help, while the others found  satisfaction for their aloofness in agreement with the sophisticated  porter, who, after he had assisted in safely depositing the writhing  woman behind the green curtains and had been rather roughly treated by  her protesting heels, shrewdly opined to the smoking-room refugees  that \"That woman sho has one case o' high-strikes.\" The berth,  however, proved no panacea--she was \"suffocating,\" she must get out of  the smoke and dust, she must get away from \"those people\" or she would  stifle, and to the other symptoms were added paroxysms of coughing and  gasping which sent shivers through the whole car of her sympathizers.  Her husband explained that she was just out of a hospital, which they  had left unexpectedly for home, that she never could sleep in a berth,  and if they could only get the drawing-room so he could be alone with  her he thought he could get her to sleep, but he did not know what the  consequences would be if she did not get quiet. The Pullman conductor  was strong for quiet, and he and the sweet-faced college girl and the  dear old lady formed a committee who waited on the young bride and  groom. It was hard, mighty hard, even in the bliss of their happiness,  to give up the drawing-room for a lower. Had not that drawing-room  stood out as one of their precious dreams during the last year, as,  step by step, they had planned in anticipation of that short bridal  week! But the sacrifice was made, the transfers effected, and out of  the quiet which followed, emerged order and the cheer normal to  holiday travelers. A number were gratified by the sense of their well-  doing, they had gone their limit to help; others were equally  comfortable in their satisfied sense of shrewdness, they agreed with  the porter--they had sized her up and not been \"taken in.\"    Mrs. Platt had been Lena Dalton. She was born in Galveston forty-five  years before. Her father was a cattle-buyer, rough, dissipated, always  indulgent to himself and, when mellow with drink, lavishly indulgent  to the family. He never crossed Lena; even when sober and irritable to  the rest, she had her way with him. The high point in his moral life  was reached when she was seven. For three weeks she was desperately  ill. A noted revivalist was filling a large tent twice a day; the  father attended. He promised himself to join the church if Lena did  not die--she got well, so there was no need. She remained his  favorite. \"Drunk man's luck\" forgot him several years later when his  pony fell and rolled on him, breaking more ribs than could be mended.  He left some insurance, two daughters, and a very efficient widow.  Mrs. Dalton had held her own with her husband, even when he was at his  worst. She was strong of body and mind, practical, probably somewhat  hard, certainly with no sympathy for folderols. Her common-school  education, in the country, had not opened many vistas in theories and  ideals, but she lived her narrow life well, doing as she would be done  by--which was not asking much, nor giving much--caring for herself  without fear or favor till she died, as she wished, at night alone,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59951"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 3 of 3) (#4)"],[1,"has been preserved: [22]    Treating of a number of old Central American traditions on his own  account, Nadaillac says:        Other traditions allude to convulsions of nature, to inundations,      and profound disturbances, to terrible deluges, in the midst of      which mountains and volcanoes suddenly rose up. [23]    Nothing, perhaps, connected with the signs of Messiah's death would  be more impressive than the awful fact of the three days' darkness,  and nothing would be more likely to be preserved in the traditions of  the people than this singular fact. From generation to generation it  would be remembered with terror. It is beyond question the traditional  remembrance of that event which so terrorized the native Americans  at every recurrence of an eclipse of the sun. Of this fact Bancroft  remarks:        The Mexicans were much troubled and distressed by an eclipse of      the sun. They thought that he was much disturbed and tossed about      by something, and that he was becoming seriously jaundiced. This      was the occasion of a general panic, women weeping aloud, and men      howling and shouting and striking the hand upon the mouth. There      was an immediate search for men with white hair and white faces,      and these were sacrificed to the sun, amid the din and tumult of      singing and musical instruments. It was thought that should the      eclipse become once total, there would be an end of the light, and      that in the darkness the demons would come down to the devouring of      the people. [24]    It was also the traditional remembrance of the terror of darkness,  connected with the death of Messiah, which undoubtedly created the  anxiety concerning the renewal of fire at the conclusion of each cycle  of fifty-two years recognized in the Mexican chronology. The Mexicans,  as represented in some of the notes we have quoted from different  authors, hold the tradition of the destruction of the world at four  successive epochs. And, says, Prescott:        They looked forward confidently to another such catastrophy, to      take place like the preceding, at the close of a cycle, when the      sun was to be effaced from the heavens, the human race from the      earth, and when darkness of chaos was to settle on the habitable      globe. The cycle would end in the latter part of December, and,      as the dreary season of the winter solstice approached, and the      diminished light of day gave melancholy presage of its speedy      extinction their apprehensions increased; and on the arrival      of the five unlucky days which close the year, they abandoned      themselves to despair. They broke in pieces the little images of      their household gods, in whom they no longer trusted. The holy      fires were suffered to go out in the temples, and none were lighted      in their own dwellings. Their furniture and domestic utensils      were destroyed; their garments torn in pieces; and everything      was thrown into disorder, for the coming of the evil genii who      were to descend on the desolate earth. On the evening of the last      day, a procession of priests, assuming the dress and ornaments of      their gods, moved from the capital towards a lofty mountain, about      two leagues distant. They carried with them a noble victim, the      flower of their captivities, and an apparatus for kindling the      new fire, the success of which was an augury of the renewal of      the cycle. On reaching the summit of the mountain, the procession      paused till midnight; when, as the constellation of the Pleiades      approached the zenith, the new fire was kindled by the friction of      the sticks placed on the wounded breast of the victim. The flame      was soon communicated to a funeral pile, on which the body of the      slaughtered captive was thrown. As the light streamed up towards      heaven, shouts of joy and triumph burst forth from the countless      multitudes who covered the hills, the terraces of the temples and      the house-tops, with eyes anxiously bent on the mount of sacrifice.      Couriers, with torches lighted at the blazing beacon, rapidly bore      them over every part of the country; and the cheering element was      seen brightening on altar and hearthstone, for the circuit of many      a league, long before the sun, rising on his accustomed track,      gave assurance that a new cycle had commenced its march, and that      the laws of nature were not to be reversed for the Aztecs. The      following thirteen days were given up to festivity. [25]    Whence this terror of the darkness? Whence this rejoicing at the  assurance of continued light, unless back of both terror and rejoicing  somewhere in the history of the people there was some such circumstance  as described in the Book of Mormon which gave cause for this terror  of darkness on the one hand, and the rejoicing at the assurance of a  continuation of light on the other?

After finishing his academic education  he went to Spain where he was kindly received at court. He visited  several other countries of Europe, made himself acquainted with  their languages and returned home and devoted the rest of his life  chiefly to the illustration of the national history and antiquities  of his country. He composed various works, but his \"Antiquities of  Mexico\" is the only one which went to press. His history covers the  whole period from the first occupation of Aauhuac to the middle of  the fifteenth century, at which time his labors were unfortunately  terminated by his death, which occurred in 1780. In the early portion  of his \"Antiquities\" he endeavored to trace the migratory movements  and historic annals of the race who entered the country. \"Every page,\"  remarks Prescott, \"bears testimony of the extent and fidelity of his  researches.\" (Conquest of Mexico, Vol. I., p. 40.) The author of the  history of the \"Antiquities of Mexico,\" tom. I., chapter ii, dates  the first migration of the Nahuas from the year 2,237, after the  creation\" quoted by Nadaillac \"Prehistoric America,\" p. 261. This date  is somewhat in agreement with the time at which the Book of Mormon  represents the Jaredites as arriving in the western world.    7. Adolf Bastian was born in June, 1826. He was a Prussian ethnologist  of note, being professor of that science at Berlin, and demonstrator  of the ethnological museum. He succeeded Virchow as president of the  Berlin Anthropological society. He traveled in Peru, Columbia and  Central America in 1851-66. It is from his works that De Roo quotes the  above tradition.    8.

I.    _Messiah in the Western Hemisphere._    The appearance of Messiah in the western hemisphere, no less than the  signs of his birth and death, is a circumstance that would undoubtedly  find lodgment in the tradition of the native Americans. The manner of  it, as described in the Book of Mormon, was as follows: It appears that  a short time after the cataclysms which were the sign to the western  world of Messiah's death, a number of people in the land Bountiful--a  district of country in South America where the isthmus of Panama joins  the south continent, and most likely including some part of that  isthmus--were in the vicinity of a"]]]
