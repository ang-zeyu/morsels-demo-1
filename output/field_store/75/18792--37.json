[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45899"],[0,"Studies of Travel: Italy (#4)"],[1,"rs: we have only to complain that the historical  part is a little vague, and its evidence a little uncertain. We should  not like rashly to decide whether Freemasonry was already ancient  in the days of Solomon or whether it cannot be traced with certainty  any further back than the eighteenth century. But we know the exact  duties of a Tyler, and we know that at the end of a Masonic prayer we  should answer, not \"Amen,\" but \"So mote it be.\" Still, what Freemasonry  is, how a man becomes a Freemason, or what really distinguishes a  Freemason from other people, are points about which the Masonic books  leave us wholly in the dark. So it is with the Etruscans. We seem to  know everything about them, except who they were. As far as we can  know a people from their arts and monuments, there is no people whom  we seem to know better. We have full and clear monumental evidence as  to the people themselves, as to many points in their ways, thoughts,  and belief. We know how they built, carved, and painted, and their  buildings, sculptures, and paintings, tell us in many points how they  lived, and what was their faith and worship. We have indeed no Etruscan  books; but their language still lives, at least it abides, in endless  inscriptions. But who the Etruscans were, and what their language  was, remain unsolved puzzles. The ordinary scholar is half-amused,  half-provoked, at long lines of alphabetic writing, of which, as far as  the mere letters go, he can read a great deal, but of which, save here  and there a proper name, he cannot understand a word. He knows that one  ingenious man has read it all into good German and another into good  Turkish. He curses every Lucumo whose image he sees for sticking like  a Frenchman to his own tongue. Why could they not write up everything  in three or four languages? How happy he would be if he could light  on a Latin or Greek crib which would give life to the dead letter. For  surely nothing in the world so truly answers the description of a dead  letter, as words after words, most of which it is not hard to spell,  but at the meaning of which we cannot even guess.    It is natural that in the museums of the Etruscan cities the monuments  of a kind whose interest is specially local should form a chief part  of the show. At Florence, at Arezzo, at Cortona, at Perugia, the  collections which each city has brought together make us familiar, if  we are not so already, with much of Etruscan art and Etruscan life. Or  shall we say that what they really make us familiar with is more truly  Etruscan death? Our knowledge of most nations of remote times comes  largely from their tombs and from the contents of their tombs, and this  must specially be the case with a people who, like the Etruscans, have  left no literature behind them. The last distinction makes it hardly  fair to attempt any comparison between the Etruscans and nations like  the Greeks or the Romans, with whose writings we are familiar. But  suppose we had no Greek or Roman literature, suppose we had, as we have  in the case of the Etruscans, no means of learning anything of Greek  or Roman life, except from Greek and Roman monuments. The sepulchral  element would be very important; but it would hardly be so distinctly  dominant as it is in the Etruscan case. At all events, it would not be  so distinctly forced upon the thoughts as it is in the Etruscan case.  Take a Roman sarcophagus: we know it to be sepulchral, but it does  not of itself proclaim its use; there often is no distinct reference  to the deceased person; at all events, his whole figure is not graven  on the top of the chest which contains his bones or his ashes. But in  the Etruscan museums it is the sepulchral figures which draw the eye  and the thoughts towards them far more than anything else, more than  even the chimaera, the bronze lamp, and the painted muse. Of various  sizes, of various degrees of art, they all keep one general likeness.  The departed Lucumo leans on his elbow, his hand holding what the  uninitiated are tempted to take for a dish symbolizing his admittance  to divine banquets in the other world, but which the learned tell us is  designed to catch the tears of those who mourn for him. Sometimes the  _Lucumonissa_--if we may coin so mediaeval a form--lies apart, sometimes  along with her husband. On the whole, these Etruscan sculptures seem to  bring us personally nearer to the men of a distant age and a mysterious  race than is done by anything in either Greek or Roman art.    But if these works can teach us thus much when set in rows in a place  where they were never meant to be set up, how much more plainly do they  speak to us when we see them at home, untouched, in the place and in  the state in which the first artist set them! The Volumnian tomb near  Perugia is one of the sights which, when once seen, is not likely to  be forgotten. The caution does not bear on Etruscan art; but it is  well to walk to it from St. Peter's Abbey; going by the railway is a  roundabout business, and the walk downwards commands a glorious and  ever-shifting view over the plain and the mountains, with the towns  of Assisi, Spello, and a third further on--can it be distant Trevi?  Foligno lies down in the plain--each seated on its hill. The tomb is  reached; a small collection from other places has been formed on each  side of the door. This is all very well; but we doubt the wisdom of  putting, as we understood had been done, some things from other places  in the tomb itself. But this is not a moment at which we are inclined  to find fault. We rejoice at finding that what ought to be there is so  happily and wisely left in its place, and are not greatly disturbed  if a few things are put inside which had better have been left  outside. The stone doorway of the lintelled entrance--moved doubtless  only when another member of the house was literally gathered to his  fathers--stands by the side; it was too cumbrous to be kept in its old  place now that the tomb stands ready to be entered by all whose tastes  lead them that way. We go in; the mind goes back to ruder sepulchres  at Uleybury and New Grange, of sepulchres at least as highly finished  in their own way at Mykene. But those were built, piled up of stones;  here the dwelling of the dead Lucumos is hewn in the native tufa.  The top is not, as we might have looked for, domical; it imitates the  forms of a wooden roof. From it still hang the lamps; on its surface  are carved the heads of the sun-god and of the ever-recurring Medusa.  Nor is the sun-god's own presence utterly shut out from the home of  the dead. It is a strange feeling when a burst of sunshine through the  open door kindles the eyes of the Gorgon with a strange brilliancy, and  lights up the innermost recess, almost as when the sinking rays light  up the apses of Rheims and of St. Mark's. In that innermost recess,  fronting us as we enter, lies on his _kistwaen_--may we transfer  the barbarian name to so delicate a work of art?--the father of the  household gathered around him. He is doubtless very far from being the  first _Felimna_, but the first Felimna whose ashes rest here. The name  of the family can be spelled out easily by those who, without boasting  any special Etruscan lore, are used to the oldest Greek writing from  right to left. Children and grandchildren are grouped around the  patriarch; and here comes what, from a strictly historical view, is the  most speaking thing in the whole tomb. The name of Avle Felimna can be  easily read on a chest on the right hand. On the left hand opposite  to it is another chest which has forsaken the Etruscan type. Here is  no figure, no legend in mysterious characters. We have instead one of  those sepulchral chests which imitate the figure of a house with doors.  The legend, in every-day Latin, announces that the ashes within it  are those of P. Volumnius A. F. That is, the Etruscan Avle Felimna was  the father of the Roman Publius Volumnius. We are in the first century  before our aera, when the old Etruscan life ended after the Social War,  and when the Lucumos of Arretium and Perusia became Roman Clinii and  Volumnii. To an English scholar the change comes home with a special  force. He has an analogy in the change of nomenclature in his own land  under Norman influences in the twelfth century. Publius Volumnius, son  of Avle Felimna, is the exact parallel to Robert the son of Godwin, and  a crowd of others in his days, Norman-named sons of English fathers.    We are not describing at length what may be found described at length  elsewhere. But there is another point in these Etruscan sculptures  which gives them a strange and special interest. This is their  strangely Christian look. The genii are wonderfully like angels; but  so are many Roman figures also, say those in the spandrils of the arch  of Severus. But Roman art has nothing to set alongside of the Lucumo  reclining on his tomb, not exactly like a strictly mediaeval recumbent  figure, but very like a tomb of the type not uncommon a little later,  say in the time of Elizabeth and James the First. And in the sculptures  on the chests, wherever, instead of familiar Greek legends, they give  us living pictures of Etruscan life, we often see the sons of the  Rasena clearly receiving a kind of baptism. There is no kind of ancient  works which need a greater effort to believe in their antiquity.  And nowhere do the sculptures look fresher--almost modern--than when  seen in contrast with the walls and roof above and beside them, the  sepulchre hewn in the rock, with the great stone rolled to its door.          Prae-Franciscan Assisi.      There is a certain satisfaction, a satisfaction which has a spice of  mischief in it, in dwelling on some feature in a place which is quite  different from that which makes the place famous with the world in  general. So to do is sometimes needful as a protest against serious  error."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4602"],[0,"\"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\" (#4)"],[1,"for wound, stripe for stripe.\"     --Ex. xxi. 12 and 23-25.       \"He that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.  And if     a man cause a blemish in his neighbor, as he hath done, so     shall it be done unto him: breach for breach, eye for eye,     tooth for tooth.\"--LEV. xxiv. 17, 19, 20.       \"Then the judges shall make diligent inquisition; and behold,     if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely     against his brother, then shall ye do unto him as he had     thought to have done unto his brother... And thine eye shall not     pity; but life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth,     hand for hand, foot for foot.\"--DEUT. xix. 18, 21.       Noah, Moses, and the Prophets taught that he who kills, maims,     or injures his neighbors does evil.  To resist such evil, and     to prevent it, the evil doer must be punished with death, or     maiming, or some physical injury.  Wrong must be opposed by     wrong, murder by murder, injury by injury, evil by evil.  Thus     taught Noah, Moses, and the Prophets.  But Christ rejects all     this.  \"I say unto you,\" is written in the Gospel, \"resist not     evil,\" do not oppose injury with injury, but rather bear     repeated injury from the evil doer.  What was permitted is     forbidden.  When we understand what kind of resistance they     taught, we know exactly what resistance Christ forbade.       Q. Then the ancients allowed the resistance of injury by     injury?       A. Yes. But Jesus forbids it. The Christian has in no case the     right to put to death his neighbor who has done him evil, or to     do him injury in return.       Q. May he kill or maim him in self-defense?       A. No.       Q. May he go with a complaint to the judge that he who has     wronged him may be punished?       A. No. What he does through others, he is in reality doing     himself.       Q. Can he fight in conflict with foreign enemies or disturbers     of the peace?       A. Certainly not. He cannot take any part in war or in     preparations for war.  He cannot make use of a deadly weapon.     He cannot oppose injury to injury, whether he is alone or with     others, either in person or through other people.       Q. Can he voluntarily vote or furnish soldiers for the     government?       A. He can do nothing of that kind if he wishes to be faithful     to Christ's law.       Q. Can he voluntarily give money to aid a government resting on     military force, capital punishment, and violence in general?       A. No, unless the money is destined for some special object,     right in itself, and good both in aim and means.       Q. Can he pay taxes to such a government?       A. No; he ought not voluntarily to pay taxes, but he ought not     to resist the collecting of taxes.  A tax is levied by the     government, and is exacted independently of the will of the     subject.  It is impossible to resist it without having recourse     to violence of some kind.  Since the Christian cannot employ     violence, he is obliged to offer his property at once to the     loss by violence inflicted on it by the authorities.       Q. Can a Christian give a vote at elections, or take part in     government or law business?       A. No; participation in election, government, or law business     is participation in government by force.       Q. Wherein lies the chief significance of the doctrine of     non-resistance?       A. In the fact that it alone allows of the possibility of     eradicating evil from one's own heart, and also from one's     neighbor's.  This doctrine forbids doing that whereby evil has     endured for ages and multiplied in the world.  He who attacks     another and injures him, kindles in the other a feeling of     hatred, the root of every evil.  To injure another because he     has injured us, even with the aim of overcoming evil, is     doubling the harm for him and for oneself; it is begetting, or     at least setting free and inciting, that evil spirit which we     should wish to drive out.  Satan can never be driven out by     Satan.  Error can never be corrected by error, and evil cannot     be vanquished by evil.       True non-resistance is the only real resistance to evil.  It is     crushing the serpent's head.  It destroys and in the end     extirpates the evil feeling.       Q. But if that is the true meaning of the rule of non-resistance,     can it always put into practice?       A. It can be put into practice like every virtue enjoined by     the law of God.  A virtue cannot be practiced in all     circumstances without self-sacrifice, privation, suffering, and     in extreme cases loss of life itself.  But he who esteems life     more than fulfilling the will of God is already dead to the     only true life.  Trying to save his life he loses it.  Besides,     generally speaking, where non-resistance costs the sacrifice of     a single life or of some material welfare, resistance costs a     thousand such sacrifices.       Non-resistance is Salvation; Resistance is Ruin.       It is incomparably less dangerous to act justly than unjustly,     to submit to injuries than to resist them with violence, less     dangerous even in one's relations to the present life.  If all     men refused to resist evil by evil our world would be happy.       Q. But so long as only a few act thus, what will happen to     them?       A. If only one man acted thus, and all the rest agreed     to crucify him, would it not be nobler for him to die in the     glory of non-resisting love, praying for his enemies, than to     live to wear the crown of Caesar stained with the blood of the     slain?  However, one man, or a thousand men, firmly resolved     not to oppose evil by evil are far more free from danger by     violence than those who resort to violence, whether among     civilized or savage neighbors.  The robber, the murderer, and     the cheat will leave them in peace, sooner than those who     oppose them with arms, and those who take up the sword shall     perish by the sword, but those who seek after peace, and behave     kindly and harmlessly, forgiving and forgetting injuries, for     the most part enjoy peace, or, if they die, they die blessed.     In this way, if all kept the ordinance of non-resistance, there     would obviously be no evil nor crime.  If the majority acted     thus they would establish the rule of love and good will even     over evil doers, never opposing evil with evil, and never     resorting to force.  If there were a moderately large minority     of such men, they would exercise such a salutary moral     influence on society that every cruel punishment would be     abolished, and violence and feud would be replaced by peace and     love.  Even if there were only a small minority of them, they     would rarely experience anything worse than the world's     contempt, and meantime the world, though unconscious of it, and     not grateful for it, would be continually becoming wiser and     better for their unseen action on it.  And if in the worst case     some members of the minority were persecuted to death, in dying     for the truth they would have left behind them their doctrine,     sanctified by the blood of their martyrdom.  Peace, then, to     all who seek peace, and may overruling love be the imperishable     heritage of every soul who obeys willingly Christ's word,     \"Resist not evil.\"       ADIN BALLOU.    For fifty years Ballou wrote and published books dealing  principally with the question of non-resistance to evil by force.  In these works, which are distinguished by the clearness of their  thought and eloquence of exposition, the question is looked at  from every possible side, and the binding nature of this command  on every Christian who acknowledges the Bible as the revelation of  God is firmly established.  All the ordinary objections to the  doctrine of non-resistance from the Old and New Testaments are  brought forward, such as the expulsion of the moneychangers from  the Temple, and so on, and arguments follow in disproof of them  all.  The practical reasonableness of this rule of conduct is  shown independently of Scripture, and all the objections  ordinarily made against its practicability are stated and refuted.  Thus one chapter in a book of his treats of non-resistance in  exceptional cases, and he owns in this connection that if there  were cases in which the rule of non-resistance were impossible of  application, it would prove that the law was not universally  authoritative.  Quoting these cases, he shows that it is precisely  in them that the application of the rule is both necessary and  reasonable.  There is no aspect of the question, either on his  side or on his opponents', which he has not followed up in his  writings.  I mention all this to show the unmistakable interest  which such works ought to have for men who make a profession of  Christianity, and because one would have thought Ballou's work  would have been well known, and the ideas expressed by him would  lave been either accepted or refuted; but such has not been the  case.    The work of Garrison, the father, in his foundation of the Society  of Non-resistants and his Declaration, even more than my  correspondence with the Quakers, convinced me of the fact that the  departure of the ruling form of Christianity from the law of  Christ on non-resistance by force is an error that has long been  observed and pointed out, and that men have labored, and are still  laboring, to correct.  Ballou's work confirmed me still more in  this view.  But the fate of Garrison, still more that of Ballou,  in being completely unrecognized in spite of fifty years of  obstinate and persistent work in the same direction, confirmed me  in the idea that there exists a kind of tacit but steadfast  conspiracy of silence about all such efforts.    Ballou died in August, 1890, and there was as obituary notice of him in  an American"]]]
