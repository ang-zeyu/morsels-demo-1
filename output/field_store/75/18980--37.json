Sugar, or Sugur [103], was now beginning here to take place of honey;  however, they are used together, No. 67. Sugar came from the Indies,  by way of Damascus and Aleppo, to Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, and from  these last places to us [104]. It is here not only frequently used,  but was of various sorts, as _cypre_, No. 41. 99. 120. named probably  from the isle of Cyprus, whence it might either come directly to us,  or where it had received some improvement by way of refining. There  is mention of _blanch-powder or white sugar_, 132. They, however,  were not the same, for see No. 193. Sugar was clarified sometimes  with wine [105].    Spices. _Species_. They are mentioned in general No. 133, and _whole  spices_, 167, 168. but they are more commonly specified, and are  indeed greatly used, though being imported from abroad, and from so  far as Italy or the Levant (and even there must be dear), some may  wonder at this: but it shouid be considered, that our Roll was  chiefly compiled for the use of noble and princely tables; and the  same may be said of the Editor's MS. The spices came from the same  part of the world, and by the same route, as sugar did. The _spicery_  was an ancient department at court, and had its proper officers.    As to the particular sorts, these are,    Cinamon. _Canell_. 14. 191. _Canel_, Editor's MS. 10. _Kanell_, ibid.  32. is the Italian _Canella_. See Chaucer. We have the flour or  powder, No. 20. 62. See Wiclif. It is not once mentioned in Apicius.    Macys, 14. 121. Editor's MS. 10. _Maces_, 134. Editor's MS. 27. They  are used whole, No. 158. and are always expressed plurally, though we  now use the singular, _mace_. See Junii Etym.    Cloves. No. 20. Dishes are flourished with them, 22. 158. Editor's MS.  10. 27. where we have _clowys gylofres_, as in our Roll, No. 104.  _Powdour gylofre_ occurs 65. 191. Chaucer has _clowe_ in the singular,  and see him v. Clove-gelofer.    Galyngal, 30. and elsewhere. Galangal, the long rooted cyperus [106],  is a warm cardiac and cephalic. It is used in powder, 30. 47. and was  the chief ingredient in _galentine_, which, I think, took its name  from it.    Pepper. It appears from Pliny that this pungent, warm seasoning, so  much in esteem at Rome [107], came from the East Indies [108], and,  as we may suppose, by way of Alexandria. We obtained it no doubt, in  the 14th century, from the same quarter, though not exactly by the  same route, but by Venice or Genoa. It is used both whole, No. 35,  and in powder, No. 83. And long-pepper occurs, if we read the place  rightly, in No. 191.    Ginger, gyngyn. 64. 136. alibi. Powder is used, 17. 20. alibi. and  Rabelais IV. c. 59. the white powder, 131. and it is the name of a  mess, 139. quære whether _gyngyn_ is not misread for _gyngyr_, for  see Junii Etym. The Romans had their ginger from Troglodytica [109].    Cubebs, 64. 121. are a warm spicy grain from the east.    Grains of Paradice, or _de parys_, 137. [110] are the greater  cardamoms.    Noix muscadez, 191. nutmegs.    The caraway is once mentioned, No. 53. and was an exotic from _Caria_,  whence, according to Mr. Lye, it took its name: 'sunt semina, inquit,  _carri_ vel _carrei_, sic dicti a Caria, ubi copiosissimè nascitur  [111].'    Powder-douce, which occurs so often, has been thought by some, who  have just peeped into our Roll, to be the same as sugar, and only a  different name for it; but they are plainly mistaken, as is evident  from 47. 51. 164. 165. where they are mentioned together as different  things. In short, I take powder-douce to be either powder of  galyngal, for see Editor's MS II. 20. 24, or a compound made of  sundry aromatic spices ground or beaten small, and kept always ready  at hand in some proper receptacle. It is otherwise termed _good  powders_, 83. 130. and in Editor's MS 17. 37. 38 [112]. or _powder_  simply, No. 169, 170. _White powder-douce_ occurs No. 51, which seems  to be the same as blanch-powder, 132. 193. called _blaynshe powder_,  and bought ready prepared, in Northumb. Book, p. 19. It is sometimes  used with powder-fort, 38. 156. for which see the next and last  article.    Powder-fort, 10. 11. seems to be a mixture likewise of the warmer  spices, pepper, ginger, &c. pulverized: hence we have _powder-fort of  gynger, other of canel_, 14. It is called _strong powder_, 22. and  perhaps may sometimes be intended by _good powders_. If you will  suppose it to be kept ready prepared by the vender, it may be the  _powder-marchant_, 113. 118. found joined in two places with powder-  douce. This Speght says is what gingerbread is made of; but Skinner  disapproves this explanation, yet, says Mr. Urry, gives none of his  own.    After thus travelling through the most material and most used  ingredients, the _spykenard de spayn_ occurring only once, I shall  beg leave to offer a few words on the nature, and in favour of the  present publication, and the method employed in the prosecution of it.    [Illustration: Take þe chese and of flessh of capouns, or of hennes  & hakke smal and grynde hem smale inn a morter, take mylke of  almandes with þe broth of freysh beef. oþer freysh flessh, & put the  flessh in þe mylke oþer in the broth and set hem to þe fyre, & alye  hem with flour of ryse, or gastbon, or amydoun as chargeaunt as þe  blank desire, & with zolks of ayren and safroun for to make hit zelow,  and when it is dressit in dysshes with blank desires; styk aboue  clowes de gilofre, & strawe powdour of galyugale above, and serue it  forth.]    The common language of the _formulæ_, though old and obsolete, as  naturally may be expected from the age of the MS, has no other  difficulty in it but what may easily be overcome by a small degree of  practice and application [113]: however, for the further illustration  of this matter, and the satisfaction of the curious, a _fac simile_  of one of the recipes is represented in the annexed plate. If here  and there a hard and uncouth term or expression may occur, so as to  stop or embarrass the less expert, pains have been taken to explain  them, either in the annotations under the text, or in the Index and  Glossary, for we have given it both titles, as intending it should  answer the purpose of both [114]. Now in forming this alphabet, as  it would have been an endless thing to have recourse to all our  glossaries, now so numerous, we have confined ourselves, except  perhaps in some few instances, in which the authorities are always  mentioned, to certain contemporary writers, such as the Editor's MS,  of which we shall speak more particularly hereafter, Chaucer, and  Wiclif; with whom we have associated Junius' Etymologicon Anglicanum.    As the abbreviations of the Roll are here retained, in order to  establish and confirm the age of it, it has been thought proper to  adopt the types which our printer had projected for Domesday-Book,  with which we find that our characters very nearly coincide.    The names of the dishes and sauces have occasioned the greatest  perplexity. These are not only many in number, but are often so  horrid and barbarous, to our ears at least, as to be inveloped in  several instances in almost impenetrable obscurity. Bishop Godwin  complains of this so long ago as 1616 [115]. The _Contents_ prefixed  will exhibit at once a most formidable list of these hideous names  and titles, so that there is no need to report them here. A few of  these terms the Editor humbly hopes he has happily enucleated, but  still, notwithstanding all his labour and pains, the argument is in  itself so abstruse at this distance of time, the helps so few, and  his abilities in this line of knowledge and science so slender and  confined, that he fears he has left the far greater part of the task  for the more sagacious reader to supply: indeed, he has not the least  doubt, but other gentlemen of curiosity in such matters (and this  publication is intended for them alone) will be so happy as to clear  up several difficulties, which appear now to him insuperable. It must  be confessed again, thatthe Editor may probably have often failed in  those very points, which he fancies and flatters himself to have  elucidated, but this he is willing to leave to the candour of the  public.    Now in regard to the helps I mentioned; there is not much to be  learnt from the Great Inthronization-feast of archbishop Robert  Winchelsea, A. 1295, even if it were his; but I rather think it  belongs to archbishop William Warham, A. 1504 [116]. Some use,  however, has been made of it.    Ralph Bourne was installed abbot of St. Augustine's, near Canterbury,  A. 1309; and William Thorne has inserted a list of provisions bought  for the feast, with their prices, in his Chronicle [117].    The Great Feast at the Inthronization of George Nevile archbishop of  York, 6 Edward IV. is printed by Mr. Hearne [118], and has been of  good service.    Elizabeth, queen of king Henry VII. was crowned A. 1487, and the  messes at the dinner, in two courses, are registered in the late  edition of Leland's Collectenea, A. 1770 [119], and we have profited  thereby.    The Lenten Inthronization-feast of archbishop William Warham, A. 1504  [120], given us at large by Mr. Hearne [121], has been also consulted.    There is a large catalogue of viands in Rabelais, lib. iv. cap. 59.  60. And the English translation of Mr. Ozell affording little  information, I had recourse to the French original, but not to much  more advantage.    There is also a Royal Feast at the wedding of the earl of Devonshire,  in the Harleian Misc. No. 279, and it has not been neglected.    Randle Holme, in his multifarious _Academy of Armory_, has an  alphabet of terms and dishes [122]; but though I have pressed him  into the service, he has not contributed much as to the more  difficult points.    The Antiquarian Repertory, vol. II. p. 211, exhibits an  entertainment of the mayor of Rochester, A. 1460; but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8106"],[0,"Captain Cook's Journal During His First Voyage Round the World (#4)"],[1,"too short a  time to learn the language, and we gather little of the manners and  customs from the account of the voyage.    After sailing from Tahiti we hear the same tale--sickness, want of water,  doubt of what was before them. After sailing by several small islands,  and an attempt to water at one, course was steered as before for the  Ladrones. Let Wallis tell his own story. He says:--    \"I considered that watering here would be tedious and attended with great  fatigue; that it was now the depth of winter in the southern hemisphere;  that the ship was leaky, that the rudder shook in the stern very much,  and that what other damage she might have received in her bottom could  not be known. That for these reasons she was very unfit for the bad  weather which she would certainly meet with, either in going round Cape  Horn or through the Streight of Magellan; that if she should get safely  through the streight or round the Cape, it would be absolutely necessary  to refresh in some port; but in that case no port would be in her reach.  I therefore determined to make the best of my way to Tinian, Batavia, and  so to Europe by the Cape of Good Hope.    \"By this rout, as far as we could judge, we should sooner be at home; and  if the ship should prove not to be in a condition to make the whole  voyage, we should still save our lives, as from this place to Batavia we  should probably have a calm sea, and be not far from a port.\"    These are scarcely the sentiments of a bold explorer, and we shall look  in vain for any similar ideas on the part of Cook. Here was a ship just a  year from England, just come from a convenient and friendly island, where  every refreshment and opportunity for refit were to be found, and the  only thought is how to get home again!    It was the vastly different conduct of Cook's voyages; the determination  that nothing should stop the main object of the expedition; his resource  in every difficulty and danger; that caused, and rightly caused, him to  be hailed as a born leader of such expeditions.    Wallis followed nearly on Byron's track: went from the Ladrones, through  the China Sea, to Batavia, and so home, arriving in May 1768.    The Swallow, under Captain Carteret, was navigated in a different spirit.  She was badly fitted out for such a voyage, had not even a forge, and all  the articles for trade were on board the Dolphin. But Carteret was not  easily daunted. He might, under the circumstances, when he found himself  alone, have abandoned the voyage; but he boldly went forward. Passing  from the Strait of Magellan, he touched at Juan Fernandez, and steering  somewhat south of Wallis's line, he passed south of Tahiti, discovering  Pitcairn's Island on his way, and some of the islands south of the  Paumotus.    By this time his people were severely afflicted with scurvy, and his ship  in a bad state; but Carteret only thought of getting to some place of  refreshment, from which he might afterwards pass on his voyage towards  the south, in the hope of falling in with the great southern Continent.    In this he was not fortunate. Missing all other islands, he fell across  the Santa Cruz Group, and hoping that he had found what he wanted, he  anchored and tried to water. The party were, however, attacked by the  natives, and several, including the master, were wounded and died by  poisoned arrows. All hope of a quiet refit was over, and his ship's  company being in a wretched condition, no forge or tools on board to  enable him to effect his many repairs, Carteret, who was himself very  ill, was obliged to give up all intention of exploration to the  southward. He got enough water to last him, and sailed on toward the  Solomon Islands. These he also just missed, but fell in with New Britain,  and passing between it and New Ireland, demonstrated for the first time  that these two large islands were not one, as had been supposed. He here  managed to do something to repair his leaky vessel, heeling and caulking  her, but got little but fruit for his scurvy-stricken crew. He was  attacked by the fierce islanders, and was altogether unable to do as much  as he evidently earnestly desired towards examining the islands.    Thence they struggled on by Mindanao to Makassar in Celebes, delayed by  contrary winds, disappointed of refreshments at every place they tried,  and losing men from scurvy. At Makassar they met with but an inhospitable  reception from the Dutch, who refused to permit them to receive  refreshments there, and after waiting at Bonthain, a place in Celebes,  several months, for the monsoon to change, they at last arrived at  Batavia, the only port in the Dutch Indies really open to ships, in June  1768. Thence, after heaving down and a thorough repair, they reached  home, via the Cape, on March 20th, 1769.    Of all the voyages before Cook's, Carteret's showed most determination  and true spirit of enterprise; and had his ship been better supplied, and  more suited to the exigencies of such a long cruise, he would, but for  one thing, have accomplished far more. This was the fatal disease, which  no captain had as yet succeeded in warding off, and which hampered and  defeated the efforts of the most enthusiastic. No man could go beyond a  certain point in disregarding the health of his crew.    These, then, were the kind of voyages, with their scanty fruits, to which  the English people were getting accustomed, and they were not such as to  encourage repetition.    In all the years that had elapsed since the Spaniards first sailed on the  Pacific, but little real knowledge of the lands in it had been gained.    Let us attempt to give a picture of what was known.    The Marquesas and Santa Cruz Group were known to exist; but of the  Solomons grave doubts were felt, as no man had seen them but Mendana, and  they were, if placed on a map at all, shown in very different longitudes.    Several voyagers had sighted different members of the extensive Paumotu  Group, but the varying positions caused great confusion.    Tahiti had been found by Wallis.    Tasman had laid down the south point of Tasmania, the western coast of  the North Island of New Zealand, and the Tonga Islands. Dampier and  Carteret had shown that New Britain and New Ireland were separate  islands, lying north-east of New Guinea. Quiros had found the northern  island of the New Hebrides.    But of none of these lands was anything really known. Those who had  visited them had merely touched. In no case had they gone round them, or  ascertained their limits, and their descriptions, founded on brief  experience, were bald and much exaggerated.    Let us turn to what was unknown.    This comprises the whole of the east coast of Australia, or New Holland,  and whether it was joined to Tasmania on the south, and New Guinea to the  north; the dimensions of New Zealand; New Caledonia and the New Hebrides,  with the exception of the fact that the northern island of the latter  existed; the Fiji Islands; Sandwich Islands; the Phoenix, Union, Ellice,  Gilbert, and Marshall Groups, with innumerable small islands scattered  here and there; the Cook Islands, and all the Society Islands except  Tahiti. The majority of the Paumotu Group. The coast of North America  north of 45 degrees north was unknown, and there was the great,  undefined, and imaginary southern Continent to disprove.    Whether other voyages of exploration would have been undertaken one  cannot say; but in 1768 the Royal Society put in a word.    A transit of Venus over the sun's disc was to occur in 1769, and  astronomers were anxious to take advantage of it, the object of the  observation being to ascertain the distance of the earth from the sun,  the fundamental base line in all astronomical measurements, and which was  very imperfectly known.    The Central Pacific afforded a favourable position, and the Royal Society  memorialised the king to send a ship for the purpose. The request was  granted, and at first Alexander Dalrymple, who had conducted marine  surveys in the East Indies, and was known as a scientific geographer, was  selected as observer. As, however, it was found that he also expected to  command the ship, the Admiralty positively refused to have anything to do  with him, and after some discussion James Cook was selected.    This says volumes for Cook's reputation at the time. To have risen  absolutely from the ranks was a great deal, but to be chosen as a master,  to command a ship, and undertake a scientific observation of this  importance, was a most exceptional occurrence, and speaks well for the  judgment of those who had the selection.    It seems that Mr. Stephens, the Secretary to the Admiralty, had much to  do with it. How Stephens had become acquainted with Cook history does not  relate, but doubtless his personal visits to the Admiralty in connection  with the completion of his charts of Newfoundland, from which he returned  every winter, had brought him into contact with the Secretary, who had  clearly formed a high opinion of him.    Cook, we may be sure, jumped at the chance, and his pride must have been  great when he found he was to receive a commission as Lieutenant.    This in itself was a most unusual step. The occasions on which a master  had been transferred to the executive line of the Royal Navy were very  rare, and many an admiral used his influence in favour of some deserving  officer in vain.    This was not without good reason, as the whole training of the Master of  those days was unfavourable to success in command of ships or men. The  exception was, however, in this case amply justified.    Cook was allowed to choose his vessel, and bearing in mind the dangers of  grounding in unknown seas, he pitched upon his old friends, the  stoutly-built, full-bottomed colliers of the North Sea trade.    His ship, the Endeavour, was a Whitby built vessel of three hundred and  seventy tons, and was known as H.M."]]]
