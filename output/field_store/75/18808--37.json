HYL.  By the former without doubt.    PHIL.  Is it not plain from DIOPTRICS that microscopes make the sight  more penetrating, and represent objects as they would appear to the eye  in case it were naturally endowed with a most exquisite sharpness?    HYL.  It is.    PHIL.  Consequently the microscopical representation is to be thought  that which best sets forth the real nature of the thing, or what it is in  itself. The colours, therefore, by it perceived are more genuine and real  than those perceived otherwise.    HYL.  I confess there is something in what you say.    PHIL.  Besides, it is not only possible but manifest, that there  actually are animals whose eyes are by nature framed to perceive those  things which by reason of their minuteness escape our sight. What think  you of those inconceivably small animals perceived by glasses? must we  suppose they are all stark blind? Or, in case they see, can it be  imagined their sight hath not the same use in preserving their bodies  from injuries, which appears in that of all other animals? And if it  hath, is it not evident they must see particles less than their own  bodies; which will present them with a far different view in each object  from that which strikes our senses? Even our own eyes do not always  represent objects to us after the same manner. In the jaundice every one  knows that all things seem yellow. Is it not therefore highly probable  those animals in whose eyes we discern a very different texture from that  of ours, and whose bodies abound with different humours, do not see the  same colours in every object that we do? From all which, should it not  seem to follow that all colours are equally apparent, and that none of  those which we perceive are really inherent in any outward object?    HYL.  It should.    PHIL.  The point will be past all doubt, if you consider that, in case  colours were real properties or affections inherent in external bodies,  they could admit of no alteration without some change wrought in the very  bodies themselves: but, is it not evident from what hath been said that,  upon the use of microscopes, upon a change happening in the burnouts of  the eye, or a variation of distance, without any manner of real  alteration in the thing itself, the colours of any object are  either changed, or totally disappear? Nay, all other circumstances  remaining the same, change but the situation of some objects, and they  shall present different colours to the eye. The same thing happens upon  viewing an object in various degrees of light. And what is more known  than that the same bodies appear differently coloured by candle-light  from what they do in the open day? Add to these the experiment of a prism  which, separating the heterogeneous rays of light, alters the colour of  any object, and will cause the whitest to appear of a deep blue or red to  the naked eye. And now tell me whether you are still of opinion that  every body hath its true real colour inhering in it; and, if you think it  hath, I would fain know farther from you, what certain distance and  position of the object, what peculiar texture and formation of the eye,  what degree or kind of light is necessary for ascertaining that true  colour, and distinguishing it from apparent ones.    HYL.  I own myself entirely satisfied, that they are all equally  apparent, and that there is no such thing as colour really inhering in  external bodies, but that it is altogether in the light. And what  confirms me in this opinion is, that in proportion to the light colours  are still more or less vivid; and if there be no light, then are there no  colours perceived. Besides, allowing there are colours on external  objects, yet, how is it possible for us to perceive them? For no external  body affects the mind, unless it acts first on our organs of sense. But  the only action of bodies is motion; and motion cannot be communicated  otherwise than by impulse. A distant object therefore cannot act on the  eye; nor consequently make itself or its properties perceivable to the  soul. Whence it plainly follows that it is immediately some contiguous  substance, which, operating on the eye, occasions a perception of  colours: and such is light.    PHIL.  Howl is light then a substance?    HYL. . I tell you, Philonous, external light is nothing but a thin fluid  substance, whose minute particles being agitated with a brisk motion, and  in various manners reflected from the different surfaces of outward  objects to the eyes, communicate different motions to the optic nerves;  which, being propagated to the brain, cause therein various impressions;  and these are attended with the sensations of red, blue, yellow, &c.    PHIL.  It seems then the light doth no more than shake the optic nerves.    HYL.  Nothing else.    PHIL.  And consequent to each particular motion of the nerves, the mind  is affected with a sensation, which is some particular colour.    HYL.  Right.    PHIL.  And these sensations have no existence without the mind.    HYL.  They have not.    PHIL.  How then do you affirm that colours are in the light; since by  LIGHT you understand a corporeal substance external to the mind?    HYL.  Light and colours, as immediately perceived by us, I grant cannot  exist without the mind. But in themselves they are only the motions and  configurations of certain insensible particles of matter.    PHIL.  Colours then, in the vulgar sense, or taken for the immediate  objects of sight, cannot agree to any but a perceiving substance.    HYL.  That is what I say.    PHIL.  Well then, since you give up the point as to those sensible  qualities which are alone thought colours by all mankind beside, you may  hold what you please with regard to those invisible ones of the  philosophers. It is not my business to dispute about THEM; only I would  advise you to bethink yourself, whether, considering the inquiry we are  upon, it be prudent for you to affirm--THE RED AND BLUE WHICH WE SEE ARE  NOT REAL COLOURS, BUT CERTAIN UNKNOWN MOTIONS AND FIGURES WHICH NO MAN  EVER DID OR CAN SEE ARE TRULY SO. Are not these shocking notions, and  are not they subject to as many ridiculous inferences, as those you were  obliged to renounce before in the case of sounds?    HYL.  I frankly own, Philonous, that it is in vain to longer. Colours,  sounds, tastes, in a word all those termed SECONDARY QUALITIES, have  certainly no existence without the mind. But by this acknowledgment I  must not be supposed to derogate, the reality of Matter, or external  objects; seeing it is no more than several philosophers maintain, who  nevertheless are the farthest imaginable from denying Matter. For the  clearer understanding of this, you must know sensible qualities are by  philosophers divided into PRIMARY and SECONDARY. The former are  Extension, Figure, Solidity, Gravity, Motion, and Rest; and these  they hold exist really in bodies. The latter are those above enumerated;  or, briefly, ALL SENSIBLE QUALITIES BESIDE THE PRIMARY; which they  assert are only so many sensations or ideas existing nowhere but in the  mind. But all this, I doubt not, you are apprised of. For my part, I have  been a long time sensible there was such an opinion current among  philosophers, but was never thoroughly convinced of its truth until now.    PHIL.  You are still then of opinion that EXTENSION and FIGURES are  inherent in external unthinking substances?    HYL.  I am.    PHIL.  But what if the same arguments which are brought against  Secondary Qualities will hold good against these also?    HYL.  Why then I shall be obliged to think, they too exist only in the  mind.    PHIL.  Is it your opinion the very figure and extension which you  perceive by sense exist in the outward object or material substance?  HYL.  It is.    PHIL.  Have all other animals as good grounds to think the same of the  figure and extension which they see and feel?    HYL.  Without doubt, if they have any thought at all.    PHIL.  Answer me, Hylas. Think you the senses were bestowed upon all  animals for their preservation and well-being in life? or were they given  to men alone for this end?    HYL.  I make no question but they have the same use in all other  animals.    PHIL.  If so, is it not necessary they should be enabled by them to  perceive their own limbs, and those bodies which are capable of harming  them?    HYL.  Certainly.    PHIL.  A mite therefore must be supposed to see his own foot, and things  equal or even less than it, as bodies of some considerable dimension;  though at the same time they appear to you scarce discernible, or at best  as so many visible points?    HYL.  I cannot deny it.    PHIL.  And to creatures less than the mite they will seem yet larger?    HYL.  They will.    PHIL.  Insomuch that what you can hardly discern will to another  extremely minute animal appear as some huge mountain?    HYL.  All this I grant.    PHIL.  Can one and the same thing be at the same time in itself of  different dimensions?    HYL.  That were absurd to imagine.    PHIL.  But, from what you have laid down it follows that both the  extension by you perceived, and that perceived by the mite itself, as  likewise all those perceived by lesser animals, are each of them the true  extension of the mite's foot; that is to say, by your own principles you  are led into an absurdity.    HYL.  There seems to be some difficulty in the point.    PHIL.  Again, have you not acknowledged that no real inherent property  of any object can be changed without some change in the thing itself?    HYL.  I have.    PHIL.  But, as we approach to or recede from an object, the visible  extension varies, being at one distance ten or a hundred times greater  than another.

The little girl  looked so comical, standing there in her short old pink frock, a  broken-brimmed hat on her tangle of dark curls, her eyes  sparkling, her face flushed, the great scythe in her hands, and the  saucy words on her lips.    He came down and examined it: it was done excellently well, like  most of the things miss Judy attempted--mischief always included:  and her little black-stockinged legs were still in a good state of  preservation.    \"Hum!  Well, you can finish it then, as Pat's busy.  How did you  learn to mow, young lady of wonderful accomplishments?\" (he looked  at her questioningly); \"and what made you set yourself such a task?\"    Judy gave her curls a quick push off her hot forehead.    \"(A) Faix, it was inborn in me,\" she answered instantly; \"and   (B)--sure, and don't I lo-o-ove you and delaight to plaize you?\"    He went in again slowly, thoughtfully.  Judy always mystified  him.  He understood her the least of any of his children, and  sometimes the thought of her worried him.  At present she was only  a sharp, clever, and frequently impertinent child; but he felt  she was utterly different from the other six, and it gave him  an aggrieved kind of feeling when he thought about it, which was  not very often.    He remembered her own mother had often said she trembled for  Judy's future.  That restless fire of hers that shone out of her  dancing eyes, and glowed scarlet on her cheeks in excitement, and  lent amazing energy and activity to her young, lithe body, would  either make a noble, daring, brilliant woman of her, or else she  would be shipwrecked on rocks the others would never come to, and  it would flame up higher and higher and consume her.    \"Be careful of Judy\" had been almost the last words of the anxious  mother when, in the light that comes when the world's is going out,  she had seen with terrible clearness the stones and briars in the  way of that particular pair of small, eager feet.    And she had died, and Judy was stumbling right amongst them now,  and her father could not \"be careful\" of her because he  absolutely did not know how.    As he went up the veranda steps again and through the hall, he was  wishing almost prayerfully she had not been cast in so different a  mould from the others, wishing he could stamp out that strange  flame in her that made him so uneasy at times.  He gave a great  puff at his cigar, and sighed profoundly; then he turned on his  heel and went off toward the stables to forget it all.    The man was away, exercising one of the horses in the long paddock;  but there was something stirring in the harness-room, so he went  in.    There was a little, dripping wet figure standing over a great  bucket, and dipping something in and out with charming vigour.  At the sound of his footsteps, Baby turned round and lifted a  perspiring little face to his.    \"I'se washing the kitsies for you, and Flibberty-Gibbet,\" she said  beamingly.    He took a horrified step forward.    There were two favourite kittens of his, shivering, miserable,  up to their necks in a lather of soapy water; and Flibberty-Gibbet,  the beautiful little fox terrier he had just bought for his wife,  chained to a post, also wet, miserable, and woebegone, also  undergoing the cleansing process, and being scrubbed and  swilled till his very reason was tottering.    \"They'se SO clean and nicey--no horrid ole fleas 'n them now.  AREN't you glad?  You can let Flibberty go on your bed now, and  Kitsy Blackeye is--\"    Poor Baby never finished her speech.  She had a confused idea of  hearing a little \"swear-word\" from her father, of being shaken in  a most ungentle fashion and put outside the stable, while the  unfortunate animals were dried and treated with great consideration.    But the worst was yet to come, and the results were so exceedingly  bad that the young Woolcots determined never again to assume virtues  that they had not.    Bunty, of course, desired to help the cause as strongly as the  others, and to that end his first action was to go into his  bedroom and perform startling ablutions with his face, neck, and  hands.  Then he took his soap-shiny countenance and red, much  bescrubbed hands downstairs, and sunned himself under his  father's very nose, hoping to attract favourable comment.    But he was bidden irritably \"go and play,\" and saw he would  have to find fresh means of appeasement.    He wandered into the study, with vague thoughts of tidying  the tidy bookshelves; but Pip was there, surrounded with books  and whittling a stick for a catapult, so he went out again.  Then he climbed the stairs and explored his father's bedroom  and dressing-room.  In the latter there was a wide field for his  operations.  A full-dress uniform was lying across a chair, and it  struck Bunty the gold buttons were looking less bright than they  should, so he spent a harmless quarter of an hour in polishing  them up.  Next, he burnished some spurs, which also was harmless.  Then he cast about for fresh employment.    There was quite a colony of dusty boots in one corner of the  room, and there was a great bottle of black, treacly looking  varnish on the mantelpiece.  Bunty conceived the brilliant idea of  cleaning the whole lot and standing them in a neat row to meet his  father's delighted eyes.  He found a handkerchief on the floor, of  superfine cambric, though dirty, poured upon it a liberal allowance  of varnish, and attacked the first pair.    A bright polish rewarded him, for they were patent leather ones;  but the next and the next and the next would not shine, however  hard he rubbed.  There was a step on the stair, the firm, well-known  step of his father, and he paused a moment with a look of  conscious virtue on his small shiny face.    But it fled all at once, and a look of horror replaced it.  He had  stuck the bottle on a great armchair for convenience, as he was  sitting on the floor, and now he noticed it had fallen on its side  and a black, horrid stream was issuing from its neck.    And it was the chair with the uniform on, and one of the sleeves  was soaked with the stuff, and the beautiful white shirt that  lay there, too, waiting for a button, was sticky, horrible!  Bunty gave a wild, terrified look round the room for some place  to efface himself, but there were no sheltering corners or curtains,  and there was not time to get into the bedroom and under the bed.  Near the window was a large-sized medicine chest, and in despair  Bunty crushed himself into it, his legs huddled up, his head  between his knees, and an ominous rattle of displaced bottles  in his ears.  The next minute his father was in the room.    \"Great Heavens!  God bless my soul!\" he said, and Bunty shivered  from head to foot.    Then he said a lot of things very quickly--\"foreign language\" as  Judy called it; kicked something over, and shouted \"Esther!\" in a  terrifying tone.  But Esther was down in one of the paddocks with  the General, so there was no reply.    More foreign language, more stomping about.    Bunty's teeth chattered noisily; he put up his hand to hold  his mouth together, and the cupboard, overbalanced, fell right  over, precipitating its occupant right at his father's feet,  and the bottles everywhere.    \"I didn't--I haven't--'twasn't me--'twasn't my fault!\" he  howled, backing towards the door.  \"Hoo--yah--boo-hoo-ooo!  Esther--boo--yah--Judy--oh--oh--h! oh--oh--h--h--h--h!\"  As might be expected, his father had picked up a strap that  lay conveniently near, and was giving his son a very fair  taste of it.    \"Oh--h--h--h! o--o--h! o--o--h! ah--h--h! 'twasn't me--'twasn't my  fault--its Pip and Judy--oh--h--h--h! hoo--the pant'mime! boo-hoo!  ah--h--h--h--you're killing me! hoo-boo! I was only d--doin'  it--oh--hoo--ah--h--h! d--oin' it to p--please--boo--oo--oo! to  p--please you!\"    His father paused with uplifted strap.  \"And that's why all  the others are behaving in so strange a fashion?  Just for me  to take them to the pantomime?\"    Bunty wriggled himself free.  \"Boo--hoo--yes! but not me--I  didn't--I never--true's faith--oh-h-h-hoo-yah! it wasn't my  fault, it's all the others--boo--hoo--hoo! hit them the rest.\"    He got three more smart cuts, and then fled howling and yelling  to the nursery, where he fell on the floor and kicked and rolled  about as if he were half killed.    \"You sn--n--n--n--neaks!\" he sobbed, addressing the others,  who had flown from all parts at his noisy outcry, \"you m-m--mean  p--p--p--pigs! I h--hadn't n--n--no fo--o--ow-l, and I've  h--h--had all the b--b--b--beating! y--you s--s--sn--n-neaks!  oh--h--h--h! ah--h--h--h! oh--h--h--h! oh--h--h-h! I'm b--b--bleeding  all over, I kno--o--o--ow!\"    They couldn't help laughing a bit; Bunty was always so  irresistibly comic when he was hurt ever so little; but still  they comforted him as well as they could, and tried to find out  what had happened.    Esther came in presently, looking very worried.  \"Well?\" they  said in a breath.    \"You really are the most exasperating children,\" she said  vexedly.    \"But the pantomime--quick, Esther--have you asked him?\" they  cried impatiently.    \"The pantomime!  He says he would rather make it worth Mr.  Rignold's while to take it off the boards than that one of you  should catch a glimpse of it--and it serves you very well right!  Meg, for goodness' sake give Baby some dry clothes--just look  at her; and, Judy, if you have any feeling for me, take off  that frock.  Bunty, you wicked boy, I'll call your father if  you don't stop that noise.  Nell, take the scissors from the  General, he'll poke his eyes out, bless him.\"    The young stepmother leaned back in her chair and looked round  her tragically.  She had never seen her husband so thoroughly  angered, and her beautiful lips quivered when she remembered how  he had seemed to blame her for it all.    Meg hadn't moved; the water was trickling slowly off Baby's  clothes and making "]]]
