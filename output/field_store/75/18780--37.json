It disposes pitilessly of the wealth and the happiness, the liberty  and life, of all this winged people; and yet with discretion, as  though governed itself by some great duty. It regulates day by day  the number of births, and contrives that these shall strictly accord  with the number of flowers that brighten the country-side. It  decrees the queen's deposition or warns her that she must depart; it  compels her to bring her own rivals into the world, and rears them  royally, protecting them from their mother's political hatred. So,  too, in accordance with the generosity of the flowers, the age of  the spring, and the probable dangers of the nuptial flight, will it  permit or forbid the first-born of the virgin princesses to slay in  their cradles her younger sisters, who are singing the song of the  queens. At other times, when the season wanes, and flowery hours  grow shorter, it will command the workers themselves to slaughter  the whole imperial brood, that the era of revolutions may close, and  work become the sole object of all. The \"spirit of the hive\" is  prudent and thrifty, but by no means parsimonious. And thus, aware,  it would seem, that nature's laws are somewhat wild and extravagant  in all that pertains to love, it tolerates, during summer days of  abundance, the embarrassing presence in the hive of three or four  hundred males, from whose ranks the queen about to be born shall  select her lover; three or four hundred foolish, clumsy, useless,  noisy creatures, who are pretentious, gluttonous, dirty, coarse,  totally and scandalously idle, insatiable, and enormous.    But after the queen's impregnation, when flowers begin to close  sooner, and open later, the spirit one morning will coldly decree  the simultaneous and general massacre of every male. It regulates  the workers' labours, with due regard to their age; it allots their  task to the nurses who tend the nymphs and the larvae, the ladies of  honour who wait on the queen and never allow her out of their sight;  the house-bees who air, refresh, or heat the hive by fanning their  wings, and hasten the evaporation of the honey that may be too  highly charged with water; the architects, masons, wax-workers, and  sculptors who form the chain and construct the combs; the foragers  who sally forth to the flowers in search of the nectar that turns  into honey, of the pollen that feeds the nymphs and the larvae, the  propolis that welds and strengthens the buildings of the city, or  the water and salt required by the youth of the nation. Its orders  have gone to the chemists who ensure the preservation of the honey  by letting a drop of formic acid fall in from the end of their  sting; to the capsule-makers who seal down the cells when the  treasure is ripe, to the sweepers who maintain public places and  streets most irreproachably clean, to the bearers whose duty it is  to remove the corpses; and to the amazons of the guard who keep  watch on the threshold by night and by day, question comers and  goers, recognise the novices who return from their very first  flight, scare away vagabonds, marauders and loiterers, expel all  intruders, attack redoubtable foes in a body, and, if need be,  barricade the entrance.    Finally, it is the spirit of the hive that fixes the hour of the  great annual sacrifice to the genius of the race: the hour, that is,  of the swarm; when we find a whole people, who have attained the  topmost pinnacle of prosperity and power, suddenly abandoning to the  generation to come their wealth and their palaces, their homes and  the fruits of their labour; themselves content to encounter the  hardships and perils of a new and distant country. This act, be it  conscious or not, undoubtedly passes the limits of human morality.  Its result will sometimes be ruin, but poverty always; and the  thrice-happy city is scattered abroad in obedience to a law superior  to its own happiness. Where has this law been decreed, which, as we  soon shall find, is by no means as blind and inevitable as one might  believe? Where, in what assembly, what council, what intellectual  and moral sphere, does this spirit reside to whom all must submit,  itself being vassal to an heroic duty, to an intelligence whose eyes  are persistently fixed on the future?    It comes to pass with the bees as with most of the things in this  world; we remark some few of their habits; we say they do this, they  work in such and such fashion, their queens are born thus, their  workers are virgin, they swarm at a certain time. And then we  imagine we know them, and ask nothing more. We watch them hasten  from flower to flower, we see the constant agitation within the  hive; their life seems very simple to us, and bounded, like every  life, by the instinctive cares of reproduction and nourishment. But  let the eye draw near, and endeavour to see; and at once the least  phenomenon of all becomes overpoweringly complex; we are confronted  by the enigma of intellect, of destiny, will, aim, means, causes;  the incomprehensible organisation of the most insignificant act of  life.    {11}    Our hive, then, is preparing to swarm; making ready for the great  immolation to the exacting gods of the race. In obedience to  the order of the spirit--an order that to us may well seem  incomprehensible, for it is entirely opposed to all our own  instincts and feelings--60,000 or 70,000 bees out of the 80,000 or  90,000 that form the whole population, will abandon the maternal  city at the prescribed hour. They will not leave at a moment of  despair; or desert, with sudden and wild resolve, a home laid waste  by famine, disease, or war. No, the exile has long been planned, and  the favourable hour patiently awaited. Were the hive poor, had it  suffered from pillage or storm, had misfortune befallen the royal  family, the bees would not forsake it. They leave it only when it  has attained the apogee of its prosperity; at a time when, after the  arduous labours of the spring, the immense palace of wax has its  120,000 well-arranged cells overflowing with new honey, and with the  many-coloured flour, known as \"bees' bread,\" on which nymphs and  larvae are fed.    Never is the hive more beautiful than on the eve of its heroic  renouncement, in its unrivalled hour of fullest abundance and joy;  serene for all its apparent excitement and feverishness.    Let us endeavour to picture it to ourselves, not as it appears to  the bees,--for we cannot tell in what magical, formidable fashion  things may be reflected in the 6,000 or 7,000 facets of their  lateral eyes and the triple cyclopean eye on their brow,--but as it  would seem to us, were we of their stature. From the height of a  dome more colossal than that of St. Peter's at Rome waxen walls  descend to the ground, balanced in the void and the darkness;  gigantic and manifold, vertical and parallel geometric  constructions, to which, for relative precision, audacity, and  vastness, no human structure is comparable. Each of these walls,  whose substance still is immaculate and fragrant, of virginal,  silvery freshness, contains thousands of cells, that are stored with  provisions sufficient to feed the whole people for several weeks.  Here, lodged in transparent cells, are the pollens, love-ferment of  every flower of spring, making brilliant splashes of red and yellow,  of black and mauve. Close by, in twenty thousand reservoirs, sealed  with a seal that shall only be broken on days of supreme distress,  the honey of April is stored, most limpid and perfumed of all,  wrapped round with long and magnificent embroidery of gold, whose  borders hang stiff and rigid. Still lower the honey of May matures,  in great open vats, by whose side watchful cohorts maintain an  incessant current of air. In the centre, and far from the light  whose diamond rays steal in through the only opening, in the warmest  part of the hive, there stands the abode of the future; here does it  sleep, and wake. For this is the royal domain of the brood-cells,  set apart for the queen and her acolytes; about 10,000 cells wherein  the eggs repose, 15,000 or 16,000 chambers tenanted by larvae,  40,000 dwellings inhabited by white nymphs to whom thousands of  nurses minister.* And finally, in the holy of holies of these partss  are the three, four, six, or twelve sealed palaces, vast in size  compared with the others, where the adolescent princesses lie who  await their hour, wrapped in a kind of shroud, all of them  motionless and pale, and fed in the darkness.         *The figures given here are scrupulously exact. They are       those of a well-filled hive in full prosperity.    On the day, then, that the Spirit of the Hive has ordained, a  certain part of the population will go forth, selected in accordance  with sure and immovable laws, and make way for hopes that as yet are  formless. In the sleeping city there remain the males, from whose  ranks the royal lover shall come, the very young bees that tend the  brood-cells, and some thousands of workers who continue to forage  abroad, to guard the accumulated treasure, and preserve the moral  traditions of the hive. For each hive has its own code of morals.  There are some that are very virtuous and some that are very  perverse; and a careless bee-keeper will often corrupt his people,  destroy their respect for the property of others, incite them to  pillage, and induce in them habits of conquest and idleness which  will render them sources of danger to all the little republics  around. These things result from the bee's discovery that work among  distant flowers, whereof many hundreds must be visited to form one  drop of honey, is not the only or promptest method of acquiring  wealth, but that it is easier to enter ill-guarded cities by  stratagem, or force her way into others too weak for self-defence.  Nor is it easy to restore to the paths of duty a hive "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45149"],[0,"The House of the Lord: A Study of Holy Sanctuaries Ancient and Modern (#4)"],[1,"Lord, sacred to the closest  communion between the Lord Himself and the Holy Priesthood, and devoted  to the highest and most sacred ordinances characteristic of the age or  dispensation to which the particular Temple belongs. Moreover, to be  indeed a holy Temple--accepted of God, and by Him acknowledged as His  House--the offering must have been called for, and both gift and giver  must be worthy.    The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints proclaims that it is  the possessor of the Holy Priesthood again restored to earth, and that  it is invested with Divine commission to erect and maintain Temples  dedicated to the name and service of the true and living God, and  to administer within those sacred structures the ordinances of the  Priesthood, the effect of which shall be binding both on earth and  beyond the grave.    FOOTNOTES    1. In this connection it is interesting and instructive to consider  the significance of the name _Bethel_, a contraction of _Beth Elohim_,  as applied by Jacob to the place where the presence of the Lord was  manifest unto him. Said he, \"Surely the Lord is in this place; and I  knew it not. And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place!  this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of  heaven. And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that  he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil  upon the top of it.

CHAPTER II    SANCTUARIES IN EARLIER DISPENSATIONS    {17} As understood and applied herein, the designation \"temple\" is  restricted to mean an actual structure, reared by man, hallowed and  sanctified for the special service of Deity, such service including  the authoritative administration of ordinances pertaining to the Holy  Priesthood, and not merely a place, however sacred the spot may have  become. If sacred places were to be classed with sacred buildings as  essentially temples, the category would include many a holy Bethel  rarely considered as such. In the more extended application of the  term, the Garden in Eden was the first sanctuary of earth, for therein  did the Lord first speak unto man and make known the Divine law. So  too, Sinai became a sanctuary, for the mount was consecrated as the  special abode of the Lord while He communed with the prophet, and  issued His decrees. The sanctity of such places was as that of Horeb,  where God spake unto Moses from the midst of the flame; and where,  as the man approached he was halted by the command: \"Draw not nigh  hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou  standest is holy ground.\"[1] A temple, however, is characterized not  alone as the place where God reveals Himself to man, but also as the  House wherein prescribed ordinances of the Priesthood are solemnized.    THE \"TESTIMONY\"    {18} Prior to the construction of the Tabernacle in the wilderness, and  indeed during the early stages of the memorable journey from Egypt,  the people of Israel had a certain depository for sacred things, known  as the Testimony. This is definitely mentioned in connection with the  following incident. Under Divine direction a vessel of manna was to be  preserved, lest the people forget the power and goodness of God, by  which they had been fed:        \"And Moses said. This is the thing which the Lord commandeth,      Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may      see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I      brought you forth from the land of Egypt.        \"And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of      manna therein, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your      generations.        \"As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the      Testimony, to be kept.\"[2]    There appears little room for doubt that the Testimony here referred  to was a material structure, and that its name is suggestive of Divine  witness as to its sacred character. Inasmuch as the account of the  exodus contains no mention of the making of such a structure, and  moreover as its existence and use were definitely affirmed before the  people had had time or opportunity to shape it in the wilderness, it  would seem that they must have brought the sacred Testimony with them  from Egypt. This incident is of interest and importance as indicating  the existence of a holy sanctuary during the formative {19} stages of  Israel's growth as a nation, and while the people were in subjection  to idolatrous rulers. This application of the term Testimony must not  be confused with later usage by which the tables of stone bearing the  divinely inscribed Decalogue are so designated.[3] It is to be noted  further that the Tabernacle, wherein was housed the Ark of the Covenant  containing the sacred tables of stone, is distinctively called the  Tabernacle of Testimony. These several uses of the term lead to no  ambiguity if the context be duly considered in each case.    THE PROVISIONAL TABERNACLE    While Moses communed with the Lord on Sinai, the people, left for a  time to themselves, set up a golden calf in imitation of Apis, an  Egyptian idol; and in consequence of their idolatrous orgies, the  Lord's anger was kindled against them. During the period of their  consequent estrangement, before a reconciliation had been effected  between Jehovah and His people, Divine manifestations ceased within  the camp and only afar off could the Lord be found. In connection with  this condition we read of the establishment of a temporary place of  meeting--possibly the dwelling tent of Moses, which became sanctified  by the Divine Presence. Thus runs the record:        \"And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp,      afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the      congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the      Lord went out into the tabernacle of the congregation, which was      without the camp.        \"And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that      all the people rose up, and stood every man {20} at his tent door,      and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.        \"And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the      cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle,      and the Lord talked with Moses.        \"And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle      door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his      tent door.        \"And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto      his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant      Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the      tabernacle.\"[4]    That the tent here called the Tabernacle of the Congregation[5] is  not the elaborate and costly structure specially built as the Lord  directed, is evident from the fact that the greater and more enduring  Tabernacle had not been constructed at the time referred to in the  scripture last cited. Unlike the later Tabernacle, which was set up in  the center of the camp with the tribes massed about it in specified  order, this Provisional Tabernacle was pitched outside the camp--afar  off--perhaps as an indication of the Lord's withdrawal following  Israel's idolatrous turning away from Him. That the Provisional  Tabernacle was, however, a holy sanctuary is attested by the personal  communion therein between Jehovah and His servant Moses.    THE TABERNACLE OF THE CONGREGATION    From amidst the clouds, and to the accompaniments of thunders and  lightnings on Sinai, the Lord gave unto {21} Moses the law and the  testimony. Not alone did Moses there talk with the Lord in person, but  by Divine command, Aaron and his sons Nadab and Abihu, together with  seventy of the elders of Israel, went up upon the mountain and did see  God, even the God of Israel. Over Sinai the glory of the Lord abode  for many days: \"And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat  him up into the mount; and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty  nights.\"[6]    When he descended Moses bore with him the commission to call upon the  children of Israel for contributions and offerings of their substance  and all their precious things, such as would be suitable for the  construction of a sanctuary for service in the wilderness.        \"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,        \"Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering:      of every"]]]
