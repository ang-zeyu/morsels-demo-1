But  while this decision throws a favourable light on the Rabbinic theory of  life, it can in no sense be called a fixation of a creed. There were  numerous synods in the Middle Ages, but they invariably dealt with  practical morals or with the problems which arose from time to time in  regard to the relations between Jews and their Christian neighbours. It is  true that we occasionally read of excommunications for heresy. But in  the case, for instance, of Spinoza, the Amsterdam Synagogue was much  more anxious to dissociate itself from the heresies of Spinoza than to  compel Spinoza to conform to the beliefs of the Synagogue. And though  this power of excommunication might have been employed by the mediaeval  Rabbis to enforce the acceptance of a creed, in point of fact no such  step was ever taken.    Since the time of Moses Mendelssohn (1728-1786), the chief Jewish  dogma has been that Judaism has no dogmas. In the sense assigned above  this is clearly true. Dogmas imposed by an authority able and willing  to enforce conformity and punish dissent are non-existent in Judaism.  In olden times membership of the religion of Judaism was almost entirely  a question of birth and race, not of confession. Proselytes were admitted  by circumcision and baptism, and nothing beyond an acceptance of the  Unity of God and the abjuration of idolatry is even now required by way  of profession from a proselyte. At the same time the earliest passage  put into the public liturgy was the Shema' (Deuteronomy vi. 4-9), in  which the unity of God and the duty to love God are expressed. The Ten  Commandments were also recited daily in the Temple. It is instructive to  note the reason given for the subsequent removal of the Decalogue from the  daily liturgy. It was feared that some might assume that the Decalogue  comprised the whole of the binding law. Hence the prominent position  given to them in the Temple service was no longer assigned to the Ten  Commandments in the ritual of the Synagogue. In modern times, however,  there is a growing practice of reading the Decalogue every Sabbath day.    What we do find in Pharisaic Judaism, and this is the real answer to  Harnack (_supra_, p. 15), is an attempt to reduce the whole Law  to certain fundamental principles. When a would-be proselyte accosted  Hillel, in the reign of Herod, with the demand that the Rabbi should  communicate the whole of Judaism while the questioner stood on one foot,  Hillel made the famous reply: 'What thou hatest do unto no man; that  is the whole Law, the rest is commentary.' This recalls another famous  summarisation, that given by Jesus later on in the Gospel. A little  more than a century later, Akiba said that the command to love one's  neighbour is the fundamental principle of the Law. Ben Azzai chose for  this distinction another sentence: 'This is the book of the generations  of man,' implying the equality of all men in regard to the love borne by  God for His creatures. Another Rabbi, Simlai (third century), has this  remarkable saying: 'Six hundred and thirteen precepts were imparted unto  Moses, three hundred and sixty-five negative (in correspondence with  the days of the solar year), and two hundred and forty-eight positive  (in correspondence with the number of a man's limbs). David came and  established them as eleven, as it is written: A psalm of David--Lord  who shall sojourn in Thy tent, who shall dwell in Thy holy mountain?  (i) He that walketh uprightly and (ii) worketh righteousness and (iii)  speaketh the truth in his heart. (iv) He that backbiteth not with his  tongue, (v) nor doeth evil to his neighbour, (vi) nor taketh up a reproach  against another; (vii) in whose eyes a reprobate is despised, (viii) but  who honoureth them that fear the Lord. (ix) He that sweareth to his own  hurt, and changeth not; (x) He that putteth not out his money to usury,  (xi) nor taketh a bribe against the innocent. He that doeth these things  shall never be moved. Thus David reduced the Law to eleven principles.  Then came Micah and reduced them to three, as it is written: 'What doth  the Lord require of thee but (i) to do justice, (ii) to love mercy, and  (iii) to walk humbly with thy God? Then came Habbakuk and made the whole  Law stand on one fundamental idea, 'The righteous man liveth by his faith'  (Makkoth, 23 b).    This desire to find one or a few general fundamental passages on  which the whole Scripture might be seen to base itself is, however,  far removed from anything of the nature of the Christian Creeds or  of the Mohammedan Kalimah. And when we remember that the Pharisees  and Sadducees differed on questions of doctrine (such as the belief in  immortality held by the former and rejected by the latter), it becomes  clear that the absence of a formal declaration of faith must have been  deliberate. The most that was done was to introduce into the Liturgy a  paragraph in which the assembled worshippers declared their assent to  the truth and permanent validity of the Word of God. After the Shema'  (whose contents are summarised above), the assembled worshippers daily  recited a passage in which they said (and still say): 'True and firm is  this Thy word unto us for ever.... True is it that Thou art indeed our  God ... and there is none beside Thee.'    After all, the difference between Pharisee and Sadducee was political  rather than theological. It was not till Judaism came into contact,  contact alike of attraction and repulsion, with other systems that a  desire or a need for formulating Articles of Faith was felt. Philo, coming  under the Hellenic spirit, was thus the first to make the attempt. In  the last chapter of the tract on the Creation (_De Opifico_, lxi.),  Philo enumerates what he terms the five most beautiful lessons, superior  to all others. These are--(i) God is; (ii) God is One; (iii) the World  was created (and is not eternal); (iv) the World is one, like unto God in  singleness; and (v) God exercises a continual providence for the benefit  of the world, caring for His creatures like a parent for his children.    Philo's lead found no imitators. It was not for many centuries that  two causes led the Synagogue to formulate a creed. And even then it  was not the Synagogue as a body that acted, nor was it a creed that  resulted. The first cause was the rise of sects within the Synagogue. Of  these sects the most important was that of the Karaites or Scripturalists.  Rejecting tradition, the Karaites expounded their beliefs both as a  justification of themselves against the Traditionalists and possibly as  a remedy against their own tendency to divide within their own order  into smaller sects. In the middle of the twelfth century the Karaite  Judah Hadassi of Constantinople arranged the whole Pentateuch under  the headings of the Decalogue, much as Philo had done long before.  And so he formulates ten dogmas of Judaism. These are--(i) Creation  (as opposed to the Aristotelian doctrine of the eternity of the world);  (ii) the existence of God; (iii) God is one and incorporeal; (iv) Moses  and the other canonical prophets were called by God; (v) the Law is the  Word of God, it is complete, and the Oral Tradition was unnecessary;  (vi) the Law must be read by the Jew in the original Hebrew; (vii) the  Temple of Jerusalem was the place chosen by God for His manifestation;  (viii) the Resurrection of the dead; (ix) the Coming of Messiah, son of  David; (x) Final Judgment and Retribution.    Within the main body of the Synagogue we have to wait for the same  moment for a formulation of Articles of Faith. Maimonides (1135-1204)  was a younger contemporary of Hadassi; he it was that drew up the one  and only set of principles which have ever enjoyed wide authority in  Judaism. Before Maimonides there had been some inclination towards  a creed, but he is the first to put one into set terms. Maimonides  was much influenced by Aristotelianism, and this gave him an impulse  towards a logical statement of the tenets of Judaism. On the other side,  he was deeply concerned by the criticism of Judaism from the side of  Mohammedan theologians. The latter contended, in particular, that the  biblical anthropomorphisms were destructive of a belief in the pure  spirituality of God. Hence Maimonides devoted much of his great treatise,  _Guide for the Perplexed_, to a philosophical allegorisation of the  human terms applied to God in the Hebrew Bible. In his Commentary on the  _Mishnah_ (Sanhedrin, Introduction to Chelek), Maimonides declares  'The roots of our law and its fundamental principles are thirteen.' These  are--(i) Belief in the existence of God, the Creator; (ii) belief in  the unity of God; (iii) belief in the incorporeality of God; (iv) belief  in the priority and eternity of God; (v) belief that to God and to God  alone worship must be offered; (vi) belief in prophecy; (vii) belief that  Moses was the greatest of all prophets; (viii) belief that the Law was  revealed from heaven; (ix) belief that the Law will never be abrogated,  and that no other Law will ever come from God; (x) belief that God knows  the works of men; (xi) belief in reward and punishment; (xii) belief in  the coming of the Messiah; (xiii) belief in the resurrection of the dead.'    Now here we have for the first time a set of beliefs which were a test of  Judaism. Maimonides leaves no doubt as to his meaning. For he concluded  by saying: 'When all these principles of faith are in the safe keeping  of a man, and his conviction of them is well established, he then enters  into the general body of Israel'; and, on the other hand: 'When, however,  a man breaks away from any one of these fundamental principles of belief,  then of him it is said that he has gone out of the general body of  Israel and he denies the root-truths of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6980"],[0,"Tales of St. Austin's (#4)"],[1,"I had been told to meet was the  5.30. By the way, of course, I didn't know in the least what Uncle John  was like, not having seen him since I was about one-and-a-half, but I  had been told to look out for a tall, rather good-looking man. Well,  the 5.30 came in all right, but none of the passengers seemed to answer  to the description. The ones who were tall were not good looking, and  the only man who was good looking stood five feet nothing in his boots.  I did ask him if he was Mr John Dalgliesh; but, his name happening to  be Robinson, he could not oblige. I sat out a couple more trains, and  then went back to the field. The man had gone, but Biffen was still  there. 'Was you expecting anyone today, sir?' he asked, as I came up.  'Yes. Why?' I said. 'That was 'im,' said Biffen. By skilful  questioning, I elicited the whole thing. It seems that the fearsome  bargee, in checks, was the governor's 'tall, good-looking man'; in  other words, Uncle John himself. He had come by the 4.30, I suppose.  Anyway, there he was, and I had insulted him badly. Biffen told me that  he had asked who I was, and that he (Biffen) had given the information,  while he was thinking of something else to say to him about his  digging. By the way, I suppose he dug from force of habit. Thought he'd  find diamonds, perhaps. When Biffen told him this, he said in a nasty  voice: 'Then, when he comes back will you have the goodness to tell him  that my name is John Dalgliesh, and that he will hear more of this.'  And I'm uncommonly afraid I shall. The governor bars Uncle John  awfully, I know, but he wanted me to be particularly civil to him,  because he was to get me a place in some beastly firm when I leave. I  haven't heard from home yet, but I expect to soon. Still, I'd like to  know how I could stand and watch him ruining the wicket for our spot  match of the season. As it is, it won't be as good as it would have  been. The Rugborough slow man will be unplayable if he can find one of  these spots. Altogether, it's a beastly business. Write soon, though I  know you won't--Yours ever, _Dick_        II    Telegram from Major-General Sir Everard Venables, V.C., K.C.M.G., to  his son Richard Venables:    Venables, St Austin's. What all this about Uncle John. Says were  grossly rude. Write explanation next post--_Venables_.        III    Letter from Mrs James Anthony (nee Miss Dorothy Venables) to her  brother Richard Venables:    Dear Dick--What _have_ you been doing to Uncle John? Jim and I are  stopping for a fortnight with father, and have just come in for the  whole thing. Uncle John--_isn't_ he a horrible man?--says you were  grossly insolent to him when he went down to see you. _Do_ write  and tell me all about it. I have heard no details as yet. Father  refuses to give them, and gets simply _furious_ when the matter is  mentioned. Jim said at dinner last night that a conscientious boy would  probably feel bound to be rude to Uncle John. Father said 'Conscience  be--'; I forget the rest, but it was awful. Jim says if he gets any  worse we shall have to sit on his head, and cut the traces. He is  getting so dreadfully _horsey_. Do write the very minute you get  this. I want to know all about it.--Your affectionate sister, _Dorothy_        IV    Part of Letter from Richard Venables, of St Austin's, to his father  Major-General Sir Everard Venables, V.C., K.C.M.G.:    ... So you see it was really his fault. The Emperor of Germany has no  right to come and dig holes in our best wicket. Take a parallel case.  Suppose some idiot of a fellow (not that Uncle John's that, of course,  but you know what I mean) came and began rooting up your azaleas.  Wouldn't you want to say something cutting? I will apologize to Uncle  John, if you like; but still, I do think he might have gone somewhere  else if he really wanted to dig. So you see, etc., etc.        V    Letter from Richard Venables, of St Austin's, to his sister Mrs James  Anthony:    Dear Dolly--Thanks awfully for your letter, and thank Jim for his  message. He's a ripper. I'm awfully glad you married him and not that  rotter, Thompson, who used to hang on so. I hope the most marvellous  infant on earth is flourishing. And now about Uncle John. Really, I am  jolly glad I did say all that to him. We played Rugborough yesterday,  and the wicket was simply vile. They won the toss, and made two hundred  and ten. Of course, the wicket was all right at one end, and that's  where they made most of their runs. I was wicket-keeping as usual, and  I felt awfully ashamed of the beastly pitch when their captain asked me  if it was the football-field. Of course, he wouldn't have said that if  he hadn't been a pal of mine, but it was probably what the rest of the  team thought, only they were too polite to say so. When we came to bat  it was worse than ever. I went in first with Welch--that's the fellow  who stopped a week at home a few years ago; I don't know whether you  remember him. He got out in the first over, caught off a ball that  pitched where Uncle John had been prospecting, and jumped up. It was  rotten luck, of course, and worse was to follow, for by half-past five  we had eight wickets down for just over the hundred, and only young  Scott, who's simply a slogger, and another fellow to come in. Well,  Scott came in. I had made about sixty then, and was fairly well  set--and he started simply mopping up the bowling. He gave a chance  every over as regular as clockwork, and it was always missed, and then  he would make up for it with two or three tremendous whangs--a safe  four every time. It wasn't batting. It was more like golf. Well, this  went on for some time, and we began to get hopeful again, having got a  hundred and eighty odd. I just kept up my wicket, while Scott hit. Then  he got caught, and the last man, a fellow called Moore, came in. I'd  put him in the team as a bowler, but he could bat a little, too, on  occasions, and luckily this was one of them. There were only eleven to  win, and I had the bowling. I was feeling awfully fit, and put their  slow man clean over the screen twice running, which left us only three  to get. Then it was over, and Moore played the fast man in grand style,  though he didn't score. Well, I got the bowling again, and half-way  through the over I carted a half-volley into the Pav., and that gave us  the match. Moore hung on for a bit and made about ten, and then got  bowled. We made 223 altogether, of which I had managed to get  seventy-eight, not out. It pulls my average up a good bit. Rather  decent, isn't it? The fellows rotted about a good deal, and chaired me  into the Pav., but it was Scott who won us the match, I think. He made  ninety-four. But Uncle John nearly did for us with his beastly  walking-stick. On a good wicket we might have made any number. I don't  know how the affair will end. Keep me posted up in the governor's  symptoms, and write again soon.--Your affectionate brother, _Dick_    PS.--On looking over this letter, I find I have taken it for granted  that you know all about the Uncle John affair. Probably you do, but, in  case you don't, it was this way. You see, I was going, etc., etc.        VI    From Archibald Venables, of King's College, Cambridge, to Richard  Venables, of St Austin's:    Dear Dick--Just a line to thank you for your letter, and to tell you  that since I got it I have had a visit from the great Uncle John, too.  He _is_ an outsider, if you like. I gave him the best lunch I  could in my rooms, and the man started a long lecture on extravagance.  He doesn't seem to understand the difference between the 'Varsity and a  private school. He kept on asking leading questions about pocket-money  and holidays, and wanted to know if my master allowed me to walk in the  streets in that waistcoat--a remark which cut me to the quick, 'that  waistcoat' being quite the most posh thing of the sort in Cambridge. He  then enquired after my studies; and, finally, when I saw him off at the  station, said that he had decided not to tip me, because he was afraid  that I was inclined to be extravagant. I was quite kind to him,  however, in spite of everything; but I was glad you had spoken to him  like a father. The recollection of it soothed me, though it seemed to  worry him. He talked a good deal about it. Glad you came off against  Rugborough.--Yours ever, _A. Venables_        VII    From Mr John Dalgliesh to Mr Philip Mortimer, of Penge:    Dear Sir--In reply to your letter of the 18th inst., I shall be happy  to recommend your son, Reginald, for the vacant post in the firm of  Messrs Van Nugget, Diomonde, and Mynes, African merchants. I have  written them to that effect, and you will, doubtless, receive a  communication from them shortly.--I am, my dear sir, yours faithfully,  _J. Dalgliesh_        VIII    From Richard Venables, of St Austin's, to his father Major-General Sir  Everard Venables, V.C., K.C.M.G.:    Dear Father--Uncle John writes, in answer to my apology, to say that no  apologies will meet the case; and that he has given his nomination in  that rotten City firm of his to a fellow called Mortimer. But rather a  decent thing has happened. There is a chap here I know pretty well, who  is the son of Lord Marmaduke Twistleton, and it appears that the dook  himself was down watching the Rugborough match, and liked my batting.  He came and talked to me after the match, and asked me what I was going  to do when I left, and I said I wasn't certain, and he said that, if I  hadn't anything better on, he could give me a place on his estate up in  Scotland, as a sort of land-agent, as he wanted a chap who could play  cricket, because he was keen on the game himself, and always had a lot  going on in the summer up there. So he says that, if I go up to the  'Varsity for three years, he can guarantee me the place when I come  down, with a jolly good screw and a ripping open-air life, with lots of  riding, and so on, "]]]
