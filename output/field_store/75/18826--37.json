On 9,000 English square miles lived 500,000     souls: not 55 to the square mile. [Footnote: Carlyle.     Frederick the Great, vol. x., p. 40.]    And this poverty and squalor were not to be found only in one part of  Poland, they seem to have been general. Abbe de Mably when seeing, in  1771, the misery of the country (campagne) and the bad condition of the  roads, imagined himself in Tartary. William Coxe, the English historian  and writer of travels, who visited Poland after the first partition,  relates, in speaking of the district called Podlachia, that he visited  between Bjelsk and Woyszki villages in which there was nothing but the  bare walls, and he was told at the table of the ------ that knives,  forks, and spoons were conveniences unknown to the peasants. He says he  never saw--       a road so barren of interesting scenes as that from Cracow to     Warsaw--for the most part level, with little variation of     surface; chiefly overspread with tracts of thick forest;     where open, the distant horizon was always skirted with wood     (chiefly pines and firs, intermixed with beech, birch, and     small oaks). The occasional breaks presented some pasture-     ground, with here and there a few meagre crops of corn. The     natives were poorer, humbler, and more miserable than any     people we had yet observed in the course of our travels:     whenever we stopped they flocked around us in crowds; and,     asking for charity, used the most abject gestures....The     Polish peasants are cringing and servile in their expressions     of respect; they bowed down to the ground; took off their     hats or caps and held them in their hands till we were out of     sight; stopped their carts on the first glimpse of our     carriage; in short, their whole behaviour gave evident     symptoms of the abject servitude under which they groaned.     [FOOTNOTE: William Coxe, Travels in Poland, Russia, Sweden,     and Denmark (1784--90).]    The Jews, to whom I have already more than once alluded, are too  important an element in the population of Poland not to be particularly  noticed. They are a people within a people, differing in dress as well  as in language, which is a jargon of German-Hebrew. Their number before  the first partition has been variously estimated at from less than  two millions to fully two millions and a half in a population of from  fifteen to twenty millions, and in 1860 there were in Russian Poland  612,098 Jews in a population of 4,867,124.    [FOOTNOTE: According to Charles Forster (in Pologne, a volume of the  historical series entitled L'univers pittoresque, published by Firmin  Didot freres of Paris), who follows Stanislas Plater, the population of  Poland within the boundaries of 1772 amounted to 20,220,000 inhabitants,  and was composed of 6,770,000 Poles, 7,520,000 Russians (i.e., White and  Red Russians), 2,110,000 Jews, 1,900,000 Lithuanians, 1,640,000 Germans,  180,000 Muscovites (i.e., Great Russians), and 100,000 Wallachians.]       They monopolise [says Mr. Coxe] the commerce and trade of the     country, keep inns and taverns, are stewards to the nobility,     and seem to have so much influence that nothing can be bought     or sold without the intervention of a Jew.    Our never-failing informant was particularly struck with the number and  usefulness of the Jews in Lithuania when he visited that part of the  Polish Republic in 1781--       If you ask for an interpreter, they bring you a Jew; if you     want post-horses, a Jew procures them and a Jew drives them;     if you wish to purchase, a Jew is your agent; and this     perhaps is the only country in Europe where Jews cultivate     the ground; in passing through Lithuania, we frequently saw     them engaged in sowing, reaping, mowing, and other works of     husbandry.    Having considered the condition of the lower classes, we will now turn  our attention to that of the nobility. The very unequal distribution of  wealth among them has already been mentioned. Some idea of their mode of  life may be formed from the account of the Starost Krasinski's court in  the diary (year 1759) of his daughter, Frances Krasinska. [FOOTNOTE: A  starost (starosta) is the possessor of a starosty (starostwo)--i.e., a  castle and domains conferred on a nobleman for life by the crown.] Her  description of the household seems to justify her belief that there  were not many houses in Poland that surpassed theirs in magnificence.  In introducing to the reader the various ornaments and appendages of the  magnate's court, I shall mention first, giving precedence to the fair  sex, that there lived under the supervision of a French governess six  young ladies of noble families. The noblemen attached to the lord of the  castle were divided into three classes. In the first class were to be  found sons of wealthy, or, at least, well-to-do families who served  for honour, and came to the court to acquire good manners and as an  introduction to a civil or military career. The starost provided the  keep of their horses, and also paid weekly wages of two florins to their  grooms. Each of these noble-men had besides a groom another servant who  waited on his master at table, standing behind his chair and dining on  what he left on his plate. Those of the second class were paid for their  services and had fixed duties to perform. Their pay amounted to from  300 to 1,000 florins (a florin being about the value of sixpence), in  addition to which gratuities and presents were often given. Excepting  the chaplain, doctor, and secretary, they did not, like the preceding  class, have the honour of sitting with their master at table. With  regard to this privilege it is, however, worth noticing that those  courtiers who enjoyed it derived materially hardly any advantage from  it, for on week-days wine was served only to the family and their  guests, and the dishes of roast meat were arranged pyramidally, so  that fowl and venison went to those at the head of the table, and those  sitting farther down had to content themselves with the coarser kinds of  meat--with beef, pork, &c. The duties of the third class of followers,  a dozen young men from fifteen to twenty years of age, consisted  in accompanying the family on foot or on horseback, and doing their  messages, such as carrying presents and letters of invitation.  The second and third classes were under the jurisdiction of the  house-steward, who, in the case of the young gentlemen, was not sparing  in the application of the cat. A strict injunction was laid on all to  appear in good clothes. As to the other servants of the castle, the  authoress thought she would find it difficult to specify them; indeed,  did not know even the number of their musicians, cooks, Heyducs,  Cossacks, and serving maids and men. She knew, however, that every day  five tables were served, and that from morning to night two persons  were occupied in distributing the things necessary for the kitchen.  More impressive even than a circumstantial account like this are  briefly-stated facts such as the following: that the Palatine Stanislas  Jablonowski kept a retinue of 2,300 soldiers and 4,000 courtiers,  valets, armed attendants, huntsmen, falconers, fishers, musicians, and  actors; and that Janusz, Prince of Ostrog, left at his death a majorat  of eighty towns and boroughs, and 2,760 villages, without counting the  towns and villages of his starosties. The magnates who distinguished  themselves during the reign of Stanislas Augustus (1764--1795) by the  brilliance and magnificence of their courts were the Princes Czartoryski  and Radziwill, Count Potocki, and Bishop Soltyk of Cracovia. Our  often-quoted English traveller informs us that the revenue of Prince  Czartoryski amounted to nearly 100,000 pounds per annum, and that his  style of living corresponded with this income. The Prince kept an open  table at which there rarely sat down less than from twenty to thirty  persons. [FOOTNOTE: Another authority informs us that on great occasions  the Czartoryskis received at their table more than twenty thousand  persons.] The same informant has much to say about the elegance and  luxury of the Polish nobility in their houses and villas, in the  decoration and furniture of which he found the French and English styles  happily blended. He gives a glowing account of the fetes at which he  was present, and says that they were exquisitely refined and got up  regardless of expense.    Whatever changes the national character of the Poles has undergone in  the course of time, certain traits of it have remained unaltered, and  among these stands forth predominantly their chivalry. Polish bravery is  so universally recognised and admired that it is unnecessary to enlarge  upon it. For who has not heard at least of the victorious battle of  Czotzim, of the delivery of Vienna, of the no less glorious defeats of  Maciejowice and Ostrolenka, and of the brilliant deeds of Napoleon's  Polish Legion? And are not the names of Poland's most popular heroes,  Sobieski and Kosciuszko, household words all the world over? Moreover,  the Poles have proved their chivalry not only by their valour on the  battle-field, but also by their devotion to the fair sex. At banquets  in the good olden time it was no uncommon occurrence to see a Pole kneel  down before his lady, take off one of her shoes, and drink out of it.  But the women of Poland seem to be endowed with a peculiar power. Their  beauty, grace, and bewitching manner inflame the heart and imagination  of all that set their eyes on them. How often have they not conquered  the conquerors of their country?

This journey of Eyre's was very remarkable in more ways than one; its  most extraordinary incident being the statement that his horses  travelled for seven days and nights without water. I have travelled  with horses in almost every part of Australia, but I know that after  three days and three nights without water horses would certainly knock  up, die, or become utterly useless, and it would be impossible to make  them continue travelling. Another remarkable incident of his march is  strange enough. One night whilst Eyre was watching the horses, there  being no water at the encampment, Baxter, his only white companion,  was murdered by two little black boys belonging to South Australia,  who had been with Eyre for some time previously. These little boys  shot Baxter and robbed the camp of nearly all the food and ammunition  it contained, and then, while Eyre was running up from the horses to  where Baxter lay, decamped into the bush and were only seen the  following morning, but never afterwards. One other and older boy, a  native of Albany, whither Eyre was bound, now alone remained. Eyre and  this boy (Wylie) now pushed on in a starving condition, living upon  dead fish or anything they could find for several weeks, and never  could have reached the Sound had they not, by almost a miracle, fallen  in with a French whaling schooner when nearly 300 miles had yet to be  traversed. The captain, who was an Englishman named Rossiter, treated  them most handsomely; he took them on board for a month while their  horses recruited on shore--for this was a watering place of  Flinders--he then completely refitted them with every necessary before  he would allow them to depart. Eyre in gratitude called the place  Rossiter Bay, but it seems to have been prophetically christened  previously by the ubiquitous Flinders, under the name of Lucky Bay.  Nearly all the watering places visited by Eyre consisted of the  drainage from great accumulations of pure white sand or hummocks,  which were previously discovered by the Investigator; as Flinders  himself might well have been called. The most peculiar of these  features is the patch at what Flinders called the head of the Great  Australian Bight; these sandhills rise to an elevation of several  hundred feet, the prevailing southerly winds causing them to slope  gradually from the south, while the northern face is precipitous. In  moonlight I have seen these sandhills, a few miles away, shining like  snowy mountains, being refracted to an unnatural altitude by the  bright moonlight. Fortunate indeed it was for Eyre that such relief  was afforded him; he was unable to penetrate at all into the interior,  and he brought back no information of the character and nature of the  country inland. I am the only traveller who has explored that part of  the interior, but of this more hereafter.    About this time Strezletki and McMillan, both from New South Wales,  explored the region now the easternmost part of the colony of  Victoria, which Strezletki called Gipp's Land. These two explorers  were rivals, and both, it seems, claimed to have been first in that  field.    Next on the list of explorers comes Ludwig Leichhardt, a surgeon, a  botanist, and an eager seeker after fame in the Australian field of  discovery, and whose memory all must revere. He successfully conducted  an expedition from Moreton Bay to the Port Essington of King--on the  northern coast--by which he made known the geographical features of a  great part of what is now Queensland, the capital being Brisbane at  Moreton Bay. A settlement had been established at Port Essington by  the Government of New South Wales, to which colony the whole territory  then belonged. At this settlement, as being the only point of relief  after eighteen months of travel, Leichhardt and his exhausted party  arrived. The settlement was a military and penal one, but was  ultimately abandoned. It is now a cattle station in the northern  territory division of South Australia, and belongs to some gentlemen  in Adelaide.    Of Leichhardt's sad fate in the interior of Australia no tidings have  ever been heard. On this fatal journey, which occurred in 1848, he  undertook the too gigantic task of crossing Australia from east to  west, that is to say, from Moreton Bay to Swan River. Even at that  period, however, the eastern interior was not all entirely unknown, as  Mitchell's Victoria River or Barcoo, and the Cooper's and Eyre's  Creeks of Sturt had already been discovered. The last-named  watercourse lay nearly 1000 miles from the eastern coast, in latitude  25 degrees south, and it is reasonable to suppose that to such a point  Leichhardt would naturally direct his course--indeed in what was  probably his last letter, addressed to a friend, he mentions this  watercourse as a desirable point to make for upon his new attempt. But  where his wanderings ended, and where the catastrophe that closed his  own and his companions' lives occurred, no tongue can tell. After he  finally left the furthest outlying settlements at the Mount Abundance  station, he, like the lost Pleiad, was seen on earth no more. How  could he have died and where? ah, where indeed? I who have wandered  into and returned alive from the curious regions he attempted and died  to explore, have unfortunately never come across a single record or  any remains or traces of those long lost but unforgotten braves.  Leichhardt originally started on his last sad venture with a party of  eight, including one if not two native black boys. Owing, however, to  some disagreement, the whole party returned to the starting point, but  being reorganised it started again with the same number of members.  There were about twenty head of bullocks broken in to carry  pack-loads; this was an ordinary custom in those early days of  Australian settlement. Leichhardt also had two horses and five or six  mules: this outfit was mostly contributed by the settlers who gave,  some flour, some bullocks, some money, firearms, gear, etc., and some  gave sheep and goats; he had about a hundred of the latter. The packed  bullocks were taken to supply the party with beef, in the meantime  carrying the expedition stores. The bullocks' pack-saddles were huge,  ungainly frames of wood fastened with iron-work, rings, etc.    Shortly after the expedition made a second start, two or three of the  members again seceded, and returned to the settlements, while  Leichhardt and his remaining band pushed farther and farther to the  west.    Although the eastern half of the continent is now inhabited, though  thinly, no traces of any kind, except two or three branded trees in  the valley of the Cooper, have ever been found. My belief is that the  only cause to be assigned for their destruction is summed up in the  dread word \"flood.\" They were so far traced into the valley of the  Cooper; this creek, which has a very lengthy course, ends in Lake  Eyre, one of the salt depressions which baffled that explorer. A point  on the southern shore is now known as Eyre's Lookout.    The Cooper is known in times of flood to reach a width of between  forty and fifty miles, the whole valley being inundated. Floods may  surround a traveller while not a drop of local rain may fall, and had  the members of this expedition perished in any other way, some remains  of iron pack-saddle frames, horns, bones, skulls, firearms, and other  articles must have been found by the native inhabitants who occupied  the region, and would long ago have been pointed out by the aborigines  to the next comers who invaded their territories. The length of time  that animals' bones might remain intact in the open air in Australia  is exemplified by the fact that in 1870, John Forrest found the skull  of a horse in one of Eyre's camps on the cliffs of the south coast  thirty years after it was left there by Eyre. Forrest carried the  skull to Adelaide. I argue, therefore, that if Leichhardt's animals  and equipment had not been buried by a flood, some remains must have  been since found, for it is impossible, if such things were above  ground that they could escape the lynx-like glances of Australian  aboriginals, whose wonderful visual powers are unsurpassed among  mankind. Everybody and everything must have been swallowed in a  cataclysm and buried deep and sure in the mud and slime of a flood.    The New South Wales Government made praiseworthy efforts to rescue the  missing traveller. About a year after Leichhardt visited Port  Essington, the Government abandoned the settlement, and the prevailing  opinion in the colony of New South Wales at that time was, that  Leichhardt had not been able to reach Eyre's Creek, but had been  forced up north, from his intended route, the inland-sea theory still  prevailing, and that he had probably returned to the old settlement  for relief. Therefore, when he had been absent two years, the  Government despatched a schooner to the abandoned place. The master of  the vessel saw several of the half-civilised natives, who well  remembered Leichhardt's arrival there, but he had not returned. The  natives promised the master to take the greatest care of him should he  again appear, but it is needless to say he was seen no more. The  Government were very solicitous about him, and when he had been absent  four years, Mr. Hovendon Heley was sent away with an outfit of  pack-horses and six or seven men, to endeavour to trace him. This  expedition seems to have wandered about for several months, and  discovered, as Mr. Heley states,"]]]
