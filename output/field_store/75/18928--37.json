Projections before and behind shield the less protected parts. The hard  plates are not easy to penetrate. [Footnote: Instances have been known  where bullets, striking against the skull, have glanced off, been  flattened, or even split into halves. In the Peninsular Campaign, the  author saw a man who had been struck in the forehead by a bullet which,  instead of penetrating the brain, had followed the skull around to the  back of the head, and there passed out.] The spongy packing deadens every  blow. [Footnote: An experiment resembling the familiar one of the balls in  Natural Philosophy (\"Steele's Popular Physics,\" Fig. 6, p. 26),  beautifully illustrates this point. Several balls of ivory are suspended  by cords, as in Fig. 5. If A be raised and then let fall, it will transmit  the force to B, and that to C, and so on until F is reached, which will  fly off with the impulse. If now a ball of spongy bone be substituted for  an ivory one anywhere in the line, the force will be checked, and the last  ball will not stir.] The separate pieces with their curious joinings  disperse any jar which one may receive, and also prevent fractures from  spreading.    FIG. 5.    [Illustration]    The frequent openings in this strong bone box afford safe avenues for the  passage of numerous nerves and vessels which communicate between the brain  and the rest of the body.    FIG. 6.    [Illustration: _The Spine; the seven vertebræ of the neck, cervical; the  twelve of the back, dorsal; the five of the loins, lumbar;_ a, _the  sacrum, and_ b, _the coccyx, coming the nine \"false vertebræ.\"_  (p. 3).]    2 THE TRUNK.    THE TRUNK has two important cavities. The upper part, or _chest_,  contains the heart and the lungs, and the lower part, or _abdomen_,  holds the stomach, liver, kidneys, and other organs (Fig. 31). The  principal bones are those of the _spine_, the _ribs_, and the  _hips_.    THE SPINE consists of twenty-four bones, between which are placed pads of  cartilage. [Footnote: These pads vary in thickness from one fourth to one  half an inch. They become condensed by the weight they bear during the  day, so that we are somewhat shorter at evening than in the morning.  Their elasticity causes them to resume their usual size during the night,  or when we lie down for a time.] A canal is hollowed out of the column  for the safe passage of the spinal cord. (See Fig. 50.) Projections  (processes) at the back and on either side are abundant for the attachment  of the muscles. The packing acts as a cushion to prevent any jar from  reaching the brain when we jump or run, while the double curve of the  spine also tends to disperse the force of a fall. Thus on every side the  utmost caution is taken to guard that precious gem in its casket.    THE PERFECTION OF THE SPINE surpasses all human contrivances. Its various  uses seem a bundle of contradictions. A chain of twenty-four bones is made  so stiff that it will bear a heavy burden, and so flexible that it will  bend like rubber; yet, all the while, it transmits no shock, and even  hides a delicate nerve within that would thrill with the slightest touch.  Resting upon it, the brain is borne without a tremor; and, clinging to it,  the vital organs are carried without fear of harm.    FIG. 7.    [Illustration: B, _the first cervical vertebra, the atlas;_ A, _the  atlas, and the second cervical vertebra, the axis;_ e, _the odontoid  process;_ c, _the foramen._]    THE SKULL ARTICULATES with (is jointed to) the spine in a peculiar manner.  On the top of the upper vertebra (atlas [Footnote: Thus called because,  as, in ancient fable, the god Atlas supported the world on his shoulders,  so in the body this bone bears the head.]) are two little hollows  (_a_, _b_, Fig. 7), nicely packed and lined with the synovial  membrane, into which fit the corresponding projections on the lower part  of the skull, and thus the head can rock to and fro. The second vertebra  (axis) has a peg, _e_, which projects through a hole, _c_, in  the first.    FIG. 8.    [Illustration: _The Thorax or Chest._ a, _the sternum;_ b _to_ c, _the  true ribs;_ d _to_ h, _the false ribs;_ g, h, _the floating ribs;_ i, k,  _the dorsal vertebræ._]    The surfaces of both vertebræ are so smooth that they easily glide on each  other, and thus, when we move the head side wise, the atlas turns around  the peg, _e_, of the axis.    THE RIBS, also twenty-four in number, are arranged in pairs on each side  of the chest. At the back, they are all attached to the spine. In front,  the upper seven pairs are tied by cartilages to the breastbone (sternum);  three are fastened to each other and to the cartilage above, and two, the  floating ribs, are loose.    The natural form of the chest is that of a cone diminishing upward. But,  owing to the tightness of the clothing commonly worn, the reverse is often  the case. The long, slender ribs give lightness, [Footnote: If the chest  wall were in one bone thick enough to resist a blow, it would be unwieldy  and heavy As it is, the separate bones bound by cartilages yield  gradually, and diffuse the force among them all, and so are rarely  broken.] the arched form confers strength, and the cartilages impart  elasticity,--properties essential to the protection of the delicate organs  within, and to freedom of motion in respiration. (See note, p. 80.)    FIG. 9.    [Illustration: _The Pelvis._ a, _the sacrum;_ b, b, _the right  and the left innominatum._]    THE HIP BONES, called by anatomists the innominata, or nameless bones,  form an irregular basin styled the _pelvis_ (_pelvis_, a basin).  In the upper part, is the foot of the spinal column--a wedge-shaped bone  termed the _sacrum_ [Footnote: So called because it was anciently  offered in sacrifice.] (sacred), firmly planted here between the  widespreading and solid bones of the pelvis, like the keystone to an arch,  and giving a steady support to the heavy burden above.    3. THE LIMBS.    TWO SETS OF LIMBS branch from the trunk, viz.: the upper, and the lower.  They closely resemble each other. The arm corresponds to the thigh; the  forearm, to the leg; the wrist, to the ankle; the fingers, to the toes.  The fingers and the toes are so much alike that they receive the same  name, _digits_, while the several bones of both have also the common  appellation, _phalanges_. The differences which exist grow out of  their varying uses. The foot is characterized by strength; the hand, by  mobility.    FIG. 10.    [Illustration: _The Shoulder Joint._ a, _the clavicle;_ b,  _the scapula._]    1. THE UPPER LIMBS.--THE SHOULDER.--The bones of the shoulder are the  collar bone (clavicle), and the shoulder blade (scapula). The  _clavicle_ (_clavis_, a key) is a long, slender bone, shaped  like the Italic _f_. It is fastened at one end to the breastbone and  the first rib, and, at the other, to the shoulder blade. (See Fig. 1.) It  thus holds the shoulder joint out from the chest, and gives the arm  greater play. If it be removed or broken, the head of the arm bone will  fall, and the motions of the arm be greatly restricted. [Footnote: Animals  which use the forelegs only for support (as the horse, ox, etc.), do not  possess this bone. \"It is found in those that dig, fly, climb and seize.\"]    THE SHOULDER BLADE is a thin, flat, triangular bone, fitted to the top and  back of the chest, and designed to give a foundation for the muscles of  the shoulder.    THE SHOULDER JOINT.--The arm bone, or _humerus_, articulates with the  shoulder blade by a ball-and-socket joint. This consists of a cup-like  cavity in the latter bone, and a rounded head in the former, to fit it,--  thus affording a free rotary motion. The shallowness of the socket  accounts for the frequent dislocation of this joint, but a deeper one  would diminish the easy swing of the arm.    FIG. 11.    [Illustration: _Bones of the right Forearm._ H, _the humerus;_  R, _the radius; and_ U, _the ulna._]    THE ELBOW.--At the elbow, the humerus articulates with the _ulna_--a  slender bone on the inner side of the forearm--by a hinge joint which  admits of motion in only two directions, _i. e._, backward and  forward. The ulna is small at its lower end; the _radius_, or large  bone of the forearm, on the contrary, is small at its upper end, while it  is large at its lower end, where it forms the wrist joint. At the elbow,  the head of the radius is convex and fits into a shallow cavity in the  ulna, while at the wrist the ulna plays in a similar socket in the radius.  Thus the radius may roll over and even cross the ulna.    THE WRIST, or _carpus_, consists of two rows of very irregular bones,  one of which articulates with the forearm; the other, with the hand. They  are placed side to side, and so firmly fastened as to admit of only a  gliding motion. This gives little play, but great strength, elasticity,  and power of resisting shocks.    THE HAND.--The _metacarpal_ (_meta_, beyond; _karpos_,  wrist), or bones of the palm, support each a thumb or a finger. Each  finger has three bones, while the thumb has only two. The first bone of  the thumb, standing apart from the rest, enjoys a special freedom of  motion, and adds greatly to the usefulness of the hand.    FIG. 12.    [Illustration: _Bones of the Hand and the Wrist._]    The first bone (Figs. 11, 12) of each finger is so attached to the  corresponding metacarpal bone as to move in several directions upon it,  but the other phalanges form hinge joints.    The fingers are named in order: the thumb, the index, the middle, the  ring, and the little finger. Their different lengths cause them to fit the  hollow of the hand when it is closed, and probably enable us more easily  to grasp objects of varying size. If the hand clasps a ball, the tips of  the fingers will be in a straight line.    The hand in its perfection belongs only to man.

I have accordingly affixed  my signature to this instrument here at the professed house of the  Society of Jesus in Mexico, on the first of April, 1609.    JUAN SANCHEZ    Don Luys de Velasco, knight of the Order of Sanctiago,  viceroy-lieutenant of the king our sovereign, governor and  captain-general of Nueva España, and president of the royal Audiencia  and Chancillería established therein, etc. Whereas Doctor Antonio de  Morga, alcalde of criminal causes in this royal Audiencia, informed me  that he had written a book and treatise on the Events in the Filipinas  Islands, from their earliest discoveries and conquest until the end  of the past year six hundred and seven, and requested me to grant him  permission and privilege to have it printed, to the exclusion of all  others doing the same for a certain period; and whereas I entrusted  Father Juan Sanchez, of the Society of Jesus, with the inspection  of the said book, as my proxy: therefore, I hereby grant permission  to the said Doctor Antonio de Morga, so that, for the period of the  next ten years, he, or his appointee, may freely have the said book  printed by whatever printer he pleases; and I forbid any other person  to do the same within the said time and without the said permission,  under penalty of losing--and he shall lose--the type and accessories  with which the said impression shall be made, and the same shall be  applied in equal shares to his Majesty's exchequer and to the said  Doctor Antonio de Morga. Given in Mexico, on the seventh of the month  of April, one thousand six hundred and nine.    DON LUYS DE VELASCO    By order of the viceroy:    MARTIN LOPEZ GAUNA    Don Fray Garcia Guerra, by the divine grace and that of the holy  apostolic see, archbishop of Mexico, member of his Majesty's Council,  etc. Having seen the opinion expressed by Father Juan Sanchez, of the  Society of Jesus, after he had examined the book presented to us by  Doctor Antonio de Morga, alcalde in this court and Chancillería,  entitled Events in the Filipinas Islands, their Conquest and  Conversion, for which we granted him authority; and since it is  evident, by the above-mentioned opinion, that it contains nothing  against our holy Catholic faith, or good morals, but that, on the  contrary, it is useful and profitable to all persons who may read it:  therefore we do hereby grant permission to the said Doctor Antonio de  Morga, to have the said book of the said conquest and conversion of  the Filipinas Islands printed in any of the printing establishments  of the city. Given in Mexico, on the seventh of April, one thousand  six hundred and nine.    FRAY GARCIA, archbishop of Mexico.    By order of his most illustrious Lordship, the archbishop of Mexico:    DON JUAN DE PORTILLA, secretary.    ¶To Don Cristoval Gomez de Sandoval y Rojas, duke of Cea [1]    I offer your Excellency this small work, worthy of a kind reception as  much for its faithful relation as for its freedom from artifice and  adornment. Knowing my poor resources, I began it with fear; but what  encouraged me to proceed was the fact that, if what is given were  to bear an equal proportion to the receiver, there would be no one  worthy of placing his works in your Excellency's hands; and oblivion  would await the deeds achieved in these times by our Spaniards in  the discovery, conquest, and conversion of the Filipinas Islands--as  well as various fortunes which they have had from time to time in the  great kingdoms and among the pagan peoples surrounding the islands:  for, on account of the remoteness of those regions, no account has  been given to the public which purports to treat of them from their  beginnings down to the present condition. I entreat your Excellency to  accept my good will, which is laid prostrate at your feet; and should  this short treatise not afford that pleasure, which self-love--that  infirmity of the human mind--leads me to expect, will your Excellency  deal with me, as you are wont to deal with all, and read this book  and conceal its imperfections with the exercise of your toleration  and gentleness. For you are so richly endowed with these and other  virtues--which, through the divine power, cause lofty things not to  keep aloof from humble ones; and which, in addition to your own natural  greatness, have placed your Excellency in your present office for the  good of these realms, where you reward and favor the good, and correct  and check the opposite. In such rule consists the welfare of the state;  and this made the ancient philosopher, Democritus, say that reward and  punishment were true gods. In order to enjoy this happiness, we need  not crave any bygone time, but, contenting ourselves with the present,  pray that God may preserve your Excellency to us for many years.    DON ANTONIO DE MORGA [2]    To the reader [3]    The greatness of the monarchy of the Spanish kings is due to the zeal  and care with which they have defended, within their own hereditary  kingdoms, the holy Catholic faith taught by the Roman church, against  all enemies who oppose it, or seek by various errors to obscure its  truth which the kings have disseminated throughout the world. Thus,  by the mercy of God, they preserve their kingdoms and subjects in  the purity of the Christian religion, meriting thereby their glorious  title and renown of \"Defenders of the Faith.\" Moreover, by the valor  of their indomitable hearts, and at the expense of their revenues and  possessions, they have ploughed the seas with Spanish fleets and men,  and discovered and conquered vast kingdoms in the most remote and  unknown parts of the world. They have led the inhabitants of these  regions to a knowledge of the true God, and into the fold of the  Christian church, in which those peoples now live, governed in civil  and political matters with peace and justice, under the shelter and  protection of the royal arm and power, which were wanting to them  when weighed down by blind tyrannies and barbarous cruelties, on  which the enemy of the human race had so long reared them for himself.    For this reason the crown and scepter of España have extended  themselves wherever the sun sheds its light, from its rising to its  setting, with the glory and splendor of their power and majesty, and  the Spanish monarchs have excelled the other princes of the earth by  having gained innumerable souls for heaven, which has been España's  principal intention and its wealth. These, together with the great  riches and treasures which España enjoys, and the famous deeds and  victories which it has won, cause the whole world to magnify and  extol its lofty name and the energy and valor of its subjects, who  in accomplishing these deeds have lavished their blood.    Having won America, the fourth part of the earth, of which the  ancients knew naught, they sailed in the course of the sun until  they discovered an archipelago of many islands in the eastern  ocean, adjacent to farther Asia, inhabited by various peoples,  and abounding in rich metals, precious stones, and pearls, and all  manner of fruit. There raising the standard of the Faith, they freed  those peoples from the yoke and power of the demon, and placed them  under the command and government of the Faith. Consequently they may  justly raise in those islands the pillars and trophies of Non plus  ultra which the famous Hercules left on the shore of the Cadiz Sea,  which were afterward cast down by the strong arm of Cárlos V, [4]  our sovereign, who surpassed Hercules in great deeds and enterprises.    After the islands had been conquered by the sovereign light of the  holy gospel which entered therein, the heathen were baptized, the  darkness of their paganism was banished, and they changed their own for  Christian names. The islands also, losing their former name, took--with  the change of religion and the baptism of their inhabitants--that  of Filipinas Islands, in recognition of the great favors received  at the hands of his Majesty Filipo the Second, our sovereign, in  whose fortunate time and reign they were conquered, protected, and  encouraged, as a work and achievement of his royal hands.    Their discovery, conquest, and conversion were not accomplished without  great expenditure, labor, and Spanish blood, with varying success,  and amid dangers: these things render the work more illustrious,  and furnish a spacious field of which historians may treat, for such  is their office. Certainly the subject matter is not scanty, and  contains both serious and pleasant elements sufficient to be worthy  of attention, so that it will not depreciate historians to treat of  Indian occurrences and wars, which those who have not experienced  undervalue. For the people of those regions are valiant and warlike  nations of Asia, who have been reared in continual warfare, both by  sea and by land, and who use artillery and other warlike implements,  which the necessity of defending themselves against great and powerful  neighboring kingdoms, taught them to use skilfully; and--although  somewhat imperfectly--they have gained dexterity and have completed  their education in the school of España, which recently brought war to  their gates--thus sharing the experience of other provinces of Europe,  who also had formerly been ignorant and careless of the use of arms.    Some painstaking persons, to whom--for lack of time and means--I have  given and delivered many papers and relations which I possessed, have  planned to write this history; and I hope that they will publish it  in better shape than the fragmentary histories which we have hitherto"]]]
