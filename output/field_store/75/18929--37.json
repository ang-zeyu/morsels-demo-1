[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7005"],[0,"The Antiquary â€” Complete (#4)"],[1," the \"Tales of my Landlord\"  may have had various motives. There was a slight grudge against  Constable, born of some complications of the Ballantynes' affairs.  Perhaps the mere amusement of the experiment on public sagacity was one  of the more powerful reasons for the change. In our day Lord Lytton and  Mr. Trollope made similar trials of their popularity when anonymous, the  former author with the greater success. The idea of these masquerades  and veils of the incognito appears to have bewitched Constable. William  Godwin was writing for him his novel \"Mandeville,\" and Godwin had  obviously been counselled to try a disguise. He says (Jan. 30, 1816) \"I  have amused my imagination a thousand times since last we parted with  the masquerade you devised for me. The world is full of wonder. An old  favourite is always reviewed with coldness. . . . 'Pooh,' they say;  'Godwin has worn his pen to the stump!' . . . But let me once be  equipped with a significant mask and an unknown character from your  masquerade shop, and admitted to figure in with the 'Last Minstrel,' the  'Lady of the Lake,' and 'Guy Mannering' in the Scottish carnival, Gods!  how the boys and girls will admire me! 'Here is a new wonder!' they  will say. 'Ah, this is something like! Here is Godwin beaten on his own  ground. . . Here is for once a Scottish writer that they cannot say has  anything of the Scotchman about him.'\"    However, Mr. Godwin did not don the mask and domino. \"Mandeville\" came  out about the same time as \"Rob Roy;\" but the \"craziness of the public\"  for the Author of \"Waverley\" was not changed into a passion for the  father-in-law of Shelley.    \"'The Antiquary,' after a little pause of hesitation, attained  popularity not inferior to 'Guy Mannering,' and though the author  appears for a moment to have shared the doubts which he read in the  countenance of James Ballantyne, it certainly was, in the sequel, his  chief favourite among all his novels.'\"    As Scott said to Terry, \"If a man will paint from nature, he will be  likely to amuse those who are daily looking at it.\" The years which saw  the first appearance of \"Guy Mannering\" also witnessed that of \"Emma.\"  By the singular chance, or law, which links great authors closely  in time, giving us novelists in pairs, Miss Austen was \"drawing from  nature\" at the very moment when Scott was wedding nature with romance.  How generously and wisely he admired her is familiar, and it may, to  some, seem curious that he never deliberately set himself to a picture  of ordinary life, free from the intrusion of the unusual, of the heroic.  Once, looking down at the village which lies on the Tweed, opposite  Melrose, he remarked that under its roofs tragedies and tales were  doubtless being lived. 'I undertake to say there is some real romance at  this moment going on down there, that, if it could have justice done to  it, would be well worth all the fiction that was ever spun out of human  brains.' But the example he gave was terrible,--\"anything more dreadful  was never conceived by Crabbe;\" yet, adds Lockhart, \"it would never have  entered into his head to elaborate such a tale.\" He could not dwell in  the unbroken gloom dear to some modern malingerers. But he could  easily have made a tale of common Scotch life, dark with the sorrow of  Mucklebackit, and bright with the mirth of Cuddie Headrigg. There was,  however, this difficulty,--that Scott cared not to write a story of a  single class. \"From the peer to the ploughman,\" all society mingles in  each of his novels. A fiction of middle-class life did not allure him,  and he was not at the best, but at his worst, as Sydney Smith observed,  in the light talk of society. He could admire Miss Austen, and read her  novels again and again; but had he attempted to follow her, by way of  variety, then inevitably wild as well as disciplined humour would have  kept breaking in, and his fancy would have wandered like the old knights  of Arthur's Court, \"at adventure.\" \"St. Ronan's Well\" proved the truth  of all this. Thus it happens that, in \"The Antiquary,\" with all his  sympathy for the people, with all his knowledge of them, he does not  confine himself to their cottages. As Lockhart says, in his admirable  piece of criticism, he preferred to choose topics in which he could  display \"his highest art, that of skilful contrast.\"    Even the tragic romance of \"Waverley\" does not set off its Macwheebles  and Callum Begs better than the oddities of Jonathan Oldbuck and  his circle are relieved, on the one hand by the stately gloom of the  Glenallans, on the other by the stern affliction of the poor fisherman,  who, when discovered repairing \"the auld black bitch of a boat,\" in  which his boy had been lost, and congratulated by his visitors on being  capable of the exertion, makes answer, \"And what would you have me to  do, unless I wanted to see four children starve, because one is drowned?  It 's weel with you gentles, that can sit in the house with handkerchers  at your een, when ye lose a friend; but the like o' us maun to our work  again, if our hearts were beating as hard as ony hammer.\" And to his  work again Scott had to go when he lost the partner of his life.    The simple unsought charm which Lockhart notes in \"The Antiquary\" may  have passed away in later works, when what had been the amusement of  happy days became the task of sadness. But this magic \"The Antiquary\"  keeps perhaps beyond all its companions,--the magic of pleasant memories  and friendly associations. The sketches of the epoch of expected  invasion, with its patriotic musters and volunteer drillings, are  pictures out of that part in the author's life which, with his early  Highland wanderings (\"Waverley\") and his Liddesdale raids (\"Guy  Mannering\"), was most dear to him. In \"Redgauntlet,\" again, he makes, as  Alan Fairford, a return on his youth and his home, and in \"Rob Roy\" he  revives his Highland recollections, his Highland lairds of \"the blawing,  bleezing stories.\" None of the rest of the tales are so intimate in  their connection with Scott's own personal history. \"The Antiquary\" has  always, therefore, been held in the very first rank of his novels.    As far as plot goes, though Godwin denied that it had any story, \"The  Antiquary\" may be placed among the most careful. The underplot of the  Glenallans, gloomy almost beyond endurance, is very ingeniously made  to unravel the mystery of Lovel. The other side-narrative, that of  Dousterswivel, is the weak point of the whole; but this Scott justifies  by \"very late instances of the force of superstitious credulity, to a  much greater extent.\" Some occurrence of the hour may have suggested the  knavish adept with his divining-rod. But facts are never a real excuse  for the morally incredible, or all but incredible, in fiction. On the  wealth and vraisemblance and variety of character it were superfluous to  dilate. As in Shakspeare, there is not even a minor person but lives  and is of flesh and blood, if we except, perhaps, Dousterswivel and Sir  Arthur Wardour. Sir Arthur is only Sir Robert Hazlewood over again, with  a slightly different folly and a somewhat more amiable nature. Lovel's  place, as usual, is among the shades of heroes, and his love-affair is  far less moving, far more summarily treated, than that of Jenny Caxon.  The skilful contrasts are perhaps most remarkable when we compare  Elspeth of the Burnfoot with the gossiping old women in the post-office  at Fairport,--a town studied perhaps from Arbroath. It was the opinion  of Sydney Smith that every one of the novels, before \"The Fortunes of  Nigel,\" contained a Meg Merrilies and a Dominie Sampson. He may have  recognized a male Meg in Edie Ochiltree,--the invaluable character who is  always behind a wall, always overhears everything, and holds the threads  of the plot. Or he may have been hypercritical enough to think that  Elspeth of the Burnfoot is the Meg of the romance. Few will agree with  him that Meg Merrilies, in either of these cases, is \"good, but good too  often.\"    The supposed \"originals\" of certain persons in the tale have been  topics of discussion. The character of Oldbuck, like most characters in  fiction, is a combination of traits observed in various persons. Scott  says, in a note to the Ashiestiel fragment of Autobiography, that Mr.  George Constable, an old friend of his father's, \"had many of those  peculiarities of character which long afterwards I tried to develop in  the character of Jonathan Oldbuck.\" Sir Walter, when a child, made Mr.  Constable's acquaintance at Prestonpans in 1777, where he explored the  battle-field \"under the learned guidance of Dalgetty.\" Mr. Constable  first introduced him to Shakspeare's plays, and gave him his first  German dictionary. Other traits may have been suggested by John Clerk  of Eldin, whose grandfather was the hero of the story \"Praetorian here,  Praetorian there, I made it wi' a flaughter spade.\" Lockhart is no  doubt right in thinking that Oldbuck is partly a caricature of Oldbuck's  creator,--Sir Walter indeed frankly accepted the kinship; and the book  which he began on his own collection he proposed to style \"Reliquim  Trotcosienses; or, the Gabions of Jonathan Oldbuck.\"    Another person who added a few points to Oldbuck was \"Sandy Gordon,\"  author of the \"Itinerarium Septentrionale\" (1726), the very folio which  Monkbarns carried in the dilatory coach to Queensferry. Gordon had been  a student in the University of Aberdeen; he was an amateur in many arts,  but antiquarianism was his favourite hobby. He was an acquaintance of  Sir John Clerk of Eldin, the hero of the Praetorium. The words of Gordon  in his \"Itinerarium,\" where he describes the battle of the Grampians,  have supplied, or suggested, the speech of Monkbarns at the Kaim  of Kinprunes. The great question was, Where is the Mons Grampius of  Tacitus?

This exercise may profitably be extended by requiring the pupils to supply  _several_ subjects to each predicate.          LESSON 9.    SENTENCE-BUILDING--Continued.

Of what two parts does a sentence consist? What is the subject of a  sentence? What is the predicate of a sentence? What is the analysis of a  sentence?    What is a diagram? What rule for the use of capital letters have you  learned? What rule for the period?    Impromptu Exercise.    Let the pupils \"choose sides,\" as in a spelling match. Let the teacher  select _predicates_ from Lesson 8, and give them alternately to the pupils  thus arranged. The first pupil prefixes to his word whatever suitable  subjects he can think of, the teacher judging of their fitness and keeping  the count. This pupil now rises and remains standing until some one else,  on his side or the other, shall have prefixed to his word a greater number  of apt subjects. The strife is to see who shall be standing at the close of  the match, and which side shall have furnished the greater number of  subjects. The exercise may be continued with the _subjects_ of Lesson 9.  Each pupil is to be limited to the same time--one or two minutes.          LESSON 11.    ANALYSIS.    The +_predicate_+ sometimes contains +_more than one word_+.    _Analyze_ and _diagram_ according to the model.    +Model+.--_Socrates was poisoned_.      Socrates  |  was poisoned  ============|================              |    This is a sentence, because it expresses a thought. _Socrates_ is the  subject, because ----; _was poisoned_ is the predicate, because ----.  [Footnote: The word _because_--suggesting a reason--should be dropped from  these \"+Models+\" whenever it may lead to mere mechanical repetition.]    1. Napoleon was banished.  2.

Treason should have been punished.  23. Bees are humming.  24. Sodom might have been spared.          LESSON 12.    SENTENCE-BUILDING.    +To the Teacher+.--Continue oral and written exercises in agreement. See  Notes, pp. 163,164.    Prefix the little helping words in the _second column_ to such of the more  important words in the _third column_ as with them will make complete  predicates, and join these predicates to all subjects in the _first column_  with which they will unite to make good sense.         1       |        2        |     3  -------------|-----------------|------------  Burgoyne     | are             | woven.

Turbans      | may be          | slacked.  Lime         | has been        | wasted.  Steam        | could have been | seen.  Air          | must have been  | deceived.  Carpets      | were            | quarreling.          LESSON 13.    Point out the _subject_ and the predicate of each sentence in Lessons 28,  31, 34.    Look first for the word that asserts, and then, by putting _who_ or _what_  before this _predicate_, the _subject_ may easily be found.    +To the Teacher+.--Most violations of the rules of concord come from a  failure to recognize the relation of subject and predicate when these parts  are transposed or are separated by other words. Such constructions should  therefore receive special attention. See Notes, pp. 164, 165.    Introduce the class to the Parts of Speech before the close of this  recitation. See \"Hints for Oral Instruction.\"    See \"Suggestions for COMPOSITION EXERCISES,\" p. 8, last paragraph.          LESSON 14.    CLASSES OF WORDS.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--By the assistance of the few hints here  given, the ingenious teacher may render this usually dry subject  interesting and highly attractive. By questioning the pupil as to what he  has seen and heard, his interest may be excited and his curiosity awakened.    Suppose that we make an imaginary excursion to some pleasant field or  grove, where we may study the habits, the plumage, and the songs of the  little birds.    If we attempt to make the acquaintance of every little feathered singer we  meet, we shall never get to the end of our pleasant task: but we find that  some resemble one another in size, shape, color, habits, and song. These we  associate together and call them sparrows.    We find others differing essentially from the sparrows, but resembling one  another. These we call robins.    We thus find that, although we were unable to become acquainted with each  _individual_ bird, they all belong to a few _classes_, with which we may  soon become familiar.    It is so with the words of our language. There are many thousand words, all  of which belong to eight classes.    These classes of words are called +Parts of Speech+.    We classify birds according to their form, color, etc., but we group words  into _classes_, called +Parts of Speech+, with respect to their use in the  _sentence_.    We find that many words are names. These we put in one class and call them  +Nouns+.    Each pupil may give the name of something in the room; the name of a  distinguished person; a name that may be applied to a class of persons; the  name of an animal; the name of a place: the name of a river; the name of a  mountain; the name of something which we cannot see or touch, but of which  we can think; as, _beauty_, _mind_.    Remind the pupils frequently that these _names_ are all _nouns_.    NOUNS.    +DEFINITION.--A _Noun_ is the name of anything+.    Write in columns, headed _nouns_, the names of domestic animals, of garden  vegetables, of flowers, of trees, of articles sold in a dry goods store,  and of things that cannot be seen or touched; as, _virtue_, _time_, _life_.    Write and arrange, according to the following model, the names of things  that can _float_, _fly_, _walk_, _work_, _sit_, or _sing_.              _Nouns_.            Cork   |            Clouds |  +Model+.--Wood   + floats or float.            Ships  |            Boys   |    Such expressions as _Cork floats_ are _sentences_, and the nouns _cork_,  _ship_, etc., are the subjects. You will find that _+every subject+ is a  +noun+ or some word or words used for a noun_.    Be prepared to analyze and parse the sentences which you have made. _Naming  the class to which a word belongs is the first step in parsing_.    +Model for Analysis+.--This is a sentence, because -----; _cork_ is the  subject, because -----; _floats_ is the predicate, because -----.    +Parsing+.--_Cork_ is a _noun_, because it is the name of a thing--the bark  of a tree.          LESSON 15.    Select and write all the nouns in the sentences given in Lessons 28, 31,  34.    Tell why they are nouns.    In writing the nouns, observe the following rule.    +CAPITAL LETTER--RULE.--Every proper or individual name must begin with a  capital letter+.    +To the Teacher+.--See Notes, pp. 167-169.    REVIEW QUESTIONS.    With respect to what, do we classify words (Lesson 14)? What are such  classes called? Can you illustrate this classification? What are all names?  What is a noun? What is the first step in parsing? What is the rule for  writing individual names?          LESSON 16.    VERBS.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--We propose to introduce you now to another  class of words. (The teacher may here refer to the talk about birds.)    You have learned that one very large class of words consists of _names of  things_. There is another very important class of words used to tell what  these things _do_, or used to _express_ their _existence_.    When I say, _Plants grow_, is _grow_ the name of anything? +P+.--No.  +T+.--What does it do? +P+.--It tells what plants _do_. It _expresses  action_.    +T+.--When I say, _God is_, what does _is_ express? +P+.--It expresses  _existence_, or _being_.    +T+.--When I say, _George sleeps_, _sleeps_ expresses _being_ and something  more; it tells the condition, or _state_ in which George is, or exists,  that is, it expresses _state of being_.    All the words that assert _action, being_, or _state of being_, we call  +Verbs+.    Let the teacher write nouns on the board, and require the pupils to give  all the words of which they can think, telling what the things named can  do. They may be arranged thus:--    _Noun_.  _Verbs_.         | grow,         | droop,  Plants + decay,         | flourish,         | revive.    Each pupil may give a verb that expresses an action of the body; as _weep,  sing_; an action of the mind; as, _study, love_; one"]]]
