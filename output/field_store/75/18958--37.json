With us the affirmative proposition is more  prolific in consequences than the negative. But then, the Stoics were  not content with so simple a thing as mere negation, but had negative  arnetic and privative, to say nothing of supernegative propositions.  Another noticeable feature is the total absence of the three figures  of Aristotle and the only moods spoken of are the moods of the  complex syllogism, such as the _modus penens_ in a conjunctive.  Their type of reasoning was--      If A, then B    But A    B    The important part played by conjunctive propositions in their logic  led the Stoics to formulate the following rule with regard to the  material quality of such propositions: Truth can only be followed by  truth, but falsehood may be followed by falsehood or truth.    Thus if it be truly stated that it is day, any consequence of that  statement, _e.g._ that it is light, must be true also. But a  false statement may lead either way. For instance, if it be falsely  stated that it is night then the consequence that it is dark is false  also. But if we say, \"The earth flies,\" which was regarded as not  only false but impossible [Footnote: Here we may recall the warning  of Arago to call nothing impossible outside the range of pure  mathematics] this involves the true consequence that the earth is.  Though the simple syllogism is not alluded to in the sketch which  Diogenes Laertius gives of the Stoic logic, it is of frequent  occurrence in the accounts left us of their arguments. Take for  instance the syllogism wherewith Zeno advocated the cause of  temperance--      One does not commit a secret to a man who is drunk.    One does commit a secret to a good man.    A good man will not get drunk.    The chain argument which we wrongly call the Sorites was also a  favorite resource with the Stoics. If a single syllogism did not  suffice to argue men into virtue surely a condensed series must be  effectual. And so they demonstrated the sufficiency of wisdom for  happiness as follows----      The wise man is temperate    The temperate is constant    The constant is unperturbed    The unperturbed is free from sorrow    Whoso is free from sorrow is happy    The wise man is happy    The delight which the early Stoics took in this pure play of the  intellect led them to pounce with avidity upon the abundant stock of  fallacies current among the Greeks of their time. These seem--most of  them--to have been invented by the Megarians and especially by  Eubulides of Miletus a disciple of Eucleides but they became  associated with the Stoics both by friends and foes who either praise  their subtlety or deride their solemnity in dealing with them.  Chrysippus himself was not above propounding such sophisms as the  following--      Whoever divulges the mysteries to the uninitiated commits impiety    The hierophant divulged the mysteries to the uninitiated    The hierophant commits impiety      Anything that you say passes through your mouth    You say a wagon    A wagon passes through your mouth    He is said to have written eleven books on the No-one fallacy. But  what seems to have exercised most of his ingenuity was the famous  Liar, the invention of which is ascribed to Eubulides. This fallacy  in its simplest form is as follows. If you say truly that you are  telling a lie, are you lying or telling the truth? Chrysippus set  this down as inexplicable. Nevertheless he was far from declining to  discuss it. For we find in the list of his works a treatise in five  books on the Inexplicables an Introduction to the Liar and Liars for  Introduction, six books on the Liar itself, a work directed against  those who thought that such propositions were both false and true,  another against those who professed to solve the Liar by a process of  division, three books on the solution of the Liar, and finally a  polemic against those who asserted that the Liar had its premises  false. It was well for poor Philetas of Cos that he ended his days  before Chrysippus was born, though as it was he grew thin and died of  the Liar, and his epitaph served as a solemn reminder to poets not to  meddle with logic--        Philetas of Cos am I      'Twas the Liar who made me die      And the bad nights caused thereby.    Perhaps we owe him an apology for the translation.      ETHIC    We have already had to touch upon the psychology of the Stoics in  connection with the first principles of logic. It is no less  necessary to do so now in dealing with the foundation of ethic.    The Stoics we are told reckoned that there were eight parts of the  soul. These were the five senses, the organ of sound, the intellect  and the reproductive principle. The passions, it will be observed,  are conspicuous by their absence. For the Stoic theory was that the  passions were simply the intellect in a diseased state owing to the  perversions of falsehood. This is why the Stoics would not parley  with passion, conceiving that if once it were let into the citadel of  the soul it would supplant the rightful ruler. Passion and reason  were not two things which could be kept separate in which case it  might be hoped that reason would control passion, but were two states  of the same thing--a worse and a better.    The unperturbed intellect was the legitimate monarch in the kingdom  of man. Hence the Stoics commonly spoke of it as the leading  principle. This was the part of the soul which received phantasies  and it was also that in which impulses were generated with which we  have now more particularly to do.    Impulse or appetition was the principle in the soul which impelled to  action. In an unperverted state it was directed only to things in  accordance with nature. The negative form of this principle or the  avoidance of things as being contrary to nature, we shall call  repulsion.    Notwithstanding the sublime heights to which Stoic morality rose. It  was professedly based on self-love, wherein the Stoics were at one  with the other schools of thought in the ancient world.    The earliest impulse that appeared in a newly born animal was to  protect itself and its own constitution which were conciliated to it  by nature. What tended to its survival, it sought; what tended to its  destruction, it shunned. Thus self-preservation was the first law of  life.    While man was still in the merely animal stage, and before reason was  developed in him, the things that were in accordance with his nature  were such as health, strength, good bodily condition, soundness of  all the senses, beauty, swiftness--in short all the qualities that  went to make up richness of physical life and that contributed to the  vital harmony. These were called the first things in accordance with  nature. Their opposites were all contrary to nature, such as  sickness, weakness, mutilation. Under the first things in accordance  with nature came also congenial advantages of soul such as quickness  of intelligence, natural ability, industry, application, memory, and  the like. It was a question whether pleasure was to be included among  the number. Some members of the school evidently thought that it might  be, but the orthodox opinion was that pleasure was a sort of  aftergrowth and that the direct pursuit of it was deleterious to the  organism. The after growths of virtue were joy, cheerfulness, and the  like. These were the gambolings of the spirit like the frolicsomeness  of an animal in the full flush of its vitality or like the blooming  of a plant. For one and the same power manifested itself in all ranks  of nature, only at each stage on a higher level. To the vegetative  powers of the plant the animal added sense and Impulse. It was in  accordance therefore with the nature of an animal to obey the  Impulses of sense, but to sense and Impulse man superadded reason so  that when he became conscious of himself as a rational being, it was  in accordance with his nature to let all his Impulses be shaped by  this new and master hand. Virtue was therefore pre-eminently in  accordance with nature. What then we must now ask is the relation of  reason to impulse as conceived by the Stoics? Is reason simply the  guiding, and impulse the motive power? Seneca protests against this  view, when impulse is identified with passion. One of his grounds for  doing so is that reason would be put on a level with passion, if the  two were equally necessary for action. But the question is begged by  the use of the word 'passion,' which was defined by the Stoics as 'an  excessive impulse.' Is it possible then, even on Stoic principles,  for reason to work without something different from itself to help  it? Or must we say that reason is itself a principle of action? Here  Plutarch comes to our aid, who tells us on the authority of  Chrysippus in his work on Law that impulse is 'the reason of man  commanding him to act,' and similarly that repulsion is 'prohibitive  reason.' This renders the Stoic position unmistakable, and we must  accomodate our minds to it in spite of its difficulties. Just as we  have seen already that reason is not something radically different  from sense, so now it appears that reason is not different from  impulse, but itself the perfected form of impulse. Whenever impulse  is not identical with reason--at least in a rational being--it is not  truly impulse, but passion.    The Stoics, it will be observed, were Evolutionists in their  psychology. But, like many Evolutionists at the present day, they did  not believe in the origin of mind out of matter. In all living things  there existed already what they called 'seminal reasons,' which  accounted for the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7524"],[0,"The Germany and the Agricola of Tacitus (#4)"],[1,"bride; but oxen, a caparisoned steed, a  shield, spear, and sword. By virtue of these, the wife is espoused; and  she in her turn makes a present of some arms to her husband. This they  consider as the firmest bond of union; these, the sacred mysteries,  the conjugal deities. That the woman may not think herself excused from  exertions of fortitude, or exempt from the casualties of war, she is  admonished by the very ceremonial of her marriage, that she comes to her  husband as a partner in toils and dangers; to suffer and to dare equally  with him, in peace and in war: this is indicated by the yoked oxen, the  harnessed steed, the offered arms. Thus she is to live; thus to die.  She receives what she is to return inviolate [109] and honored to her  children; what her daughters-in-law are to receive, and again transmit  to her grandchildren.    19. They live, therefore, fenced around with chastity; [110] corrupted  by no seductive spectacles, [111] no convivial incitements. Men and  women are alike unacquainted with clandestine correspondence. Adultery  is extremely rare among so numerous a people. Its punishment is instant,  and at the pleasure of the husband. He cuts off the hair [112] of the  offender, strips her, and in presence of her relations expels her from  his house, and pursues her with stripes through the whole village. [113]  Nor is any indulgence shown to a prostitute. Neither beauty, youth, nor  riches can procure her a husband: for none there looks on vice with  a smile, or calls mutual seduction the way of the world. Still more  exemplary is the practice of those states [114] in which none but  virgins marry, and the expectations and wishes of a wife are at once  brought to a period. Thus, they take one husband as one body and one  life; that no thought, no desire, may extend beyond him; and he may be  loved not only as their husband, but as their marriage. [115] To limit  the increase of children, [116] or put to death any of the later progeny  [117] is accounted infamous: and good habits have there more influence  than good laws elsewhere. [118]    20. In every house the children grow up, thinly and meanly clad, [119]  to that bulk of body and limb which we behold with wonder. Every mother  suckles her own children, and does not deliver them into the hands of  servants and nurses. No indulgence distinguishes the young master from  the slave. They lie together amidst the same cattle, upon the same  ground, till age [120] separates, and valor marks out, the free-born.  The youths partake late of the pleasures of love, [121] and hence  pass the age of puberty unexhausted: nor are the virgins hurried into  marriage; the same maturity, the same full growth is required: the sexes  unite equally matched [122] and robust; and the children inherit the  vigor of their parents. Children are regarded with equal affection by  their maternal uncles [123] as by their fathers: some even consider  this as the more sacred bond of consanguinity, and prefer it in the  requisition of hostages, as if it held the mind by a firmer tie, and the  family by a more extensive obligation. A person's own children, however,  are his heirs and successors; and no wills are made. If there be no  children, the next in order of inheritance are brothers, paternal and  maternal uncles. The more numerous are a man's relations and kinsmen,  the more comfortable is his old age; nor is it here any advantage to be  childless. [124]    21. It is an indispensable duty to adopt the enmities [125] of a father  or relation, as well as their friendships: these, however, are not  irreconcilable or perpetual. Even homicide is atoned [126] by a certain  fine in cattle and sheep; and the whole family accepts the satisfaction,  to the advantage of the public weal, since quarrels are most dangerous  in a free state. No people are more addicted to social entertainments,  or more liberal in the exercise of hospitality. [127] To refuse any  person whatever admittance under their roof, is accounted flagitious.  [128] Every one according to his ability feasts his guest: when his  provisions are exhausted, he who was late the host, is now the guide  and companion to another hospitable board. They enter the next house  uninvited, and are received with equal cordiality. No one makes a  distinction with respect to the rights of hospitality, between a  stranger and an acquaintance. The departing guest is presented with  whatever he may ask for; and with the same freedom a boon is desired in  return. They are pleased with presents; but think no obligation incurred  either when they give or receive.    22. [129] [Their manner of living with their guest is easy and affable]  As soon as they arise from sleep, which they generally protract till  late in the day, they bathe, usually in warm water, [130] as cold  weather chiefly prevails there. After bathing they take their meal, each  on a distinct seat, and a a separate table. [131] Then they proceed,  armed, to business, and not less frequently to convivial parties, in  which it is no disgrace to pass days and nights, without intermission,  in drinking. The frequent quarrels that arise amongst them, when  intoxicated, seldom terminate in abusive language, but more frequently  in blood. [132] In their feasts, they generally deliberate on the  reconcilement of enemies, on family alliances, on the appointment of  chiefs, and finally on peace and war; conceiving that at no time the  soul is more opened to sincerity, or warmed to heroism. These people,  naturally void of artifice or disguise, disclose the most secret  emotions of their hearts in the freedom of festivity. The minds of all  being thus displayed without reserve, the subjects of their deliberation  are again canvassed the next day; [133] and each time has its  advantages. They consult when unable to dissemble; they determine when  not liable to mistake.    23. Their drink is a liquor prepared from barley or wheat [134] brought  by fermentation to a certain resemblance of wine. Those who border on  the Rhine also purchase wine. Their food is simple; wild fruits, fresh  venison, [135] or coagulated milk. [136] They satisfy hunger without  seeking the elegances and delicacies of the table. Their thirst for  liquor is not quenched with equal moderation. If their propensity to  drunkenness be gratified to the extent of their wishes, intemperance  proves as effectual in subduing them as the force of arms. [137]    24. They have only one kind of public spectacle, which is exhibited  in every company. Young men, who make it their diversion, dance naked  amidst drawn swords and presented spears. Practice has conferred skill  at this exercise; and skill has given grace; but they do not exhibit for  hire or gain: the only reward of this pastime, though a hazardous one,  is the pleasure of the spectators. What is extraordinary, they play at  dice, when sober, as a serious business: and that with such a desperate  venture of gain or loss, that, when everything else is gone, they set  their liberties and persons on the last throw. The loser goes into  voluntary servitude; and, though the youngest and strongest, patiently  suffers himself to be bound and sold. [138] Such is their obstinacy in  a bad practice--they themselves call it honor. The slaves thus acquired  are exchanged away in commerce, that the winner may get rid of the  scandal of his victory.    25. The rest of their slaves have not, like ours, particular employments  in the family allotted them. Each is the master of a habitation and  household of his own. The lord requires from him a certain quantity  of grain, cattle, or cloth, as from a tenant; and so far only the  subjection of the slave extends. [139] His domestic offices are  performed by his own wife and children. It is usual to scourge a slave,  or punish him with chains or hard labor. They are sometimes killed by  their masters; not through severity of chastisement, but in the heat  of passion, like an enemy; with this difference, that it is done with  impunity. [140] Freedmen are little superior to slaves; seldom filling  any important office in the family; never in the state, except in those  tribes which are under regal government. [141] There, they rise above  the free-born, and even the nobles: in the rest, the subordinate  condition of the freedmen is a proof of freedom.    26. Lending money upon interest, and increasing it by usury, [142] is  unknown amongst them: and this ignorance more effectually prevents  the practice than a prohibition would do. The lands are occupied  by townships, [143] in allotments proportional to the number of  cultivators; and are afterwards parcelled out among the individuals  of the district, in shares according to the rank and condition of each  person. [144] The wide extent of plain facilitates this partition. The  arable lands are annually changed, and a part left fallow; nor do they  attempt to make the most of the fertility and plenty of the soil, by  their own industry in planting orchards, inclosing meadows, and watering  gardens. Corn is the only product required from the earth: hence their  year is not divided into so many seasons as ours; for, while they  know and distinguish by name Winter, Spring, and Summer, they are  unacquainted equally with the appellation and bounty of Autumn. [145]    27. Their funerals are without parade. [146] The only circumstance to  which they attend, is to burn the bodies of eminent persons with some  particular kinds of wood. Neither vestments nor perfumes are heaped upon  the pile: [147] the arms of the deceased, and sometimes his horse, [148]  are given to the flames. The tomb is a mound of turf. They contemn the  elaborate and costly honours of monumental structures, as mere burthens  to the dead. They soon dismiss tears and lamentations; slowly, sorrow  and regret. They think it the women's part to bewail their friends, the  men's to remember them.    28."]]]
