You will conduct him, and bring us to-morrow morning news of the  wounded girl.\"    Paaker bowed; the princess bowed her head; the priest and his  companions, who meanwhile had come out of the temple and joined him,  raised their hands in blessing, and the belated procession moved towards  the Nile.    Paaker remained alone with his two slaves; the commission with which  the princess had charged him greatly displeased him. So long as the  moonlight enabled him to distinguish the litter of Mena's wife, he gazed  after it; then he endeavored to recollect the position of the hut of the  paraschites. The captain of the watch still stood with the guard at the  gate of the temple.    \"Do you know the dwelling of Pinem the paraschites?\" asked Paaker.    \"What do you want with him?\"    \"That is no concern of yours,\" retorted Paaker.    \"Lout!\" exclaimed the captain, \"left face and forwards, my men.\"    \"Halt!\" cried Paaker in a rage. \"I am the king's chief pioneer.\"    \"Then you will all the more easily find the way back by which you came.  March.\"    The words were followed by a peal of many-voiced laughter: the  re-echoing insult so confounded Paaker that he dropped his whip on the  ground. The slave, whom a short time since he had struck with it, humbly  picked it up and then followed his lord into the fore court of the  temple. Both attributed the titter, which they still could hear without  being able to detect its origin, to wandering spirits. But the mocking  tones had been heard too by the old gate-keeper, and the laughers were  better known to him than to the king's pioneer; he strode with heavy  steps to the door of the temple through the black shadow of the pylon,  and striking blindly before him called out--    \"Ah! you good-for-nothing brood of Seth.\"       [The Typhon of the Greeks. The enemy of Osiris, of truth, good     and purity. Discord and strife in nature. Horns who fights against     him for his father Osiris, can throw him and stun him, but never     annihilate him.]    \"You gallows-birds and brood of hell--I am coming.\"    The giggling ceased; a few youthful figures appeared in the moonlight,  the old man pursued them panting, and, after a short chase, a troop of  youths fled back through the temple gate.    The door-keeper had succeeded in catching one miscreant, a boy of  thirteen, and held him so tight by the ear that his pretty head seemed  to have grown in a horizontal direction from his shoulders.    \"I will take you before the school-master, you plague-of-locusts,  you swarm of bats!\" cried the old man out of breath. But the dozen of  school-boys, who had availed themselves of the opportunity to break out  of bounds, gathered coaxing round him, with words of repentance, though  every eye sparkled with delight at the fun they had had, and of which no  one could deprive them; and when the biggest of them took the old man's  chin, and promised to give him the wine which his mother was to send him  next day for the week's use, the porter let go his prisoner--who tried  to rub the pain out of his burning ear--and cried out in harsher tones  than before:    \"You will pay me, will you, to let you off! Do you think I will let your  tricks pass? You little know this old man. I will complain to the Gods,  not to the school-master; and as for your wine, youngster, I will offer  it as a libation, that heaven may forgive you.\"          CHAPTER II.    The temple where, in the fore-court, Paaker was waiting, and where  the priest had disappeared to call the leech, was called the \"House of  Seti\"--[It is still standing and known as the temple of Qurnah.]--and  was one of the largest in the City of the Dead. Only that magnificent  building of the time of the deposed royal race of the reigning king's  grandfather--that temple which had been founded by Thotmes III.,  and whose gate-way Amenophis III. had adorned with immense colossal  statues--[That which stands to the north is the famous musical statue,  or Pillar of Memmon]--exceeded it in the extent of its plan; in every  other respect it held the pre-eminence among the sanctuaries of the  Necropolis. Rameses I. had founded it shortly after he succeeded in  seizing the Egyptian throne; and his yet greater son Seti carried on the  erection, in which the service of the dead for the Manes of the members  of the new royal family was conducted, and the high festivals held in  honor of the Gods of the under-world. Great sums had been expended  for its establishment, for the maintenance of the priesthood of its  sanctuary, and the support of the institutions connected with it. These  were intended to be equal to the great original foundations of priestly  learning at Heliopolis and Memphis; they were regulated on the same  pattern, and with the object of raising the new royal residence of Upper  Egypt, namely Thebes, above the capitals of Lower Egypt in regard to  philosophical distinction.    One of the most important of these foundations was a very celebrated  school of learning.       [Every detail of this description of an Egyptian school is derived     from sources dating from the reign of Rameses II. and his     successor, Merneptah.]    First there was the high-school, in which priests, physicians, judges,  mathematicians, astronomers, grammarians, and other learned men, not  only had the benefit of instruction, but, subsequently, when they had  won admission to the highest ranks of learning, and attained the dignity  of \"Scribes,\" were maintained at the cost of the king, and enabled to  pursue their philosophical speculations and researches, in freedom  from all care, and in the society of fellow-workers of equal birth and  identical interests.    An extensive library, in which thousands of papyrus-rolls were  preserved, and to which a manufactory of papyrus was attached, was at  the disposal of the learned; and some of them were intrusted with  the education of the younger disciples, who had been prepared in  the elementary school, which was also dependent on the House--or  university--of Seti. The lower school was open to every son of a free  citizen, and was often frequented by several hundred boys, who also  found night-quarters there. The parents were of course required either  to pay for their maintenance, or to send due supplies of provisions for  the keep of their children at school.    In a separate building lived the temple-boarders, a few sons of the  noblest families, who were brought up by the priests at a great expense  to their parents.    Seti I., the founder of this establishment, had had his own sons, not  excepting Rameses, his successor, educated here.    The elementary schools were strictly ruled, and the rod played so  large a part in them, that a pedagogue could record this saying: \"The  scholar's ears are at his back: when he is flogged then he hears.\"    Those youths who wished to pass up from the lower to the high-school  had to undergo an examination. The student, when he had passed it,  could choose a master from among the learned of the higher grades,  who undertook to be his philosophical guide, and to whom he remained  attached all his life through, as a client to his patron. He could  obtain the degree of \"Scribe\" and qualify for public office by a second  examination.    Near to these schools of learning there stood also a school of art, in  which instruction was given to students who desired to devote themselves  to architecture, sculpture, or painting; in these also the learner might  choose his master.    Every teacher in these institutions belonged to the priesthood of the  House of Seti. It consisted of more than eight hundred members, divided  into five classes, and conducted by three so-called Prophets.    The first prophet was the high-priest of the House of Seti, and at the  same time the superior of all the thousands of upper and under servants  of the divinities which belonged to the City of the Dead of Thebes.    The temple of Seti proper was a massive structure of limestone. A row  of Sphinxes led from the Nile to the surrounding wall, and to the  first vast pro-pylon, which formed the entrance to a broad fore-court,  enclosed on the two sides by colonnades, and beyond which stood a second  gate-way. When he had passed through this door, which stood between two  towers, in shape like truncated pyramids, the stranger came to a second  court resembling the first, closed at the farther end by a noble row of  pillars, which formed part of the central temple itself.    The innermost and last was dimly lighted by a few lamps.    Behind the temple of Seti stood large square structures of brick of the  Nile mud, which however had a handsome and decorative effect, as the  humble material of which they were constructed was plastered with  lime, and that again was painted with colored pictures and hieroglyphic  inscriptions.    The internal arrangement of all these houses was the same. In the midst  was an open court, on to which opened the doors of the rooms of the  priests and philosophers. On each side of the court was a shady, covered  colonnade of wood, and in the midst a tank with ornamental plants. In  the upper story were the apartments for the scholars, and instruction  was usually given in the paved courtyard strewn with mats.    The most imposing was the house of the chief prophets; it was  distinguished by its waving standards and stood about a hundred paces  behind the temple of Seti, between a well kept grove and a clear  lake--the sacred tank of the temple; but they only occupied it while  fulfilling their office, while the splendid houses which they lived in  with their wives and children, lay on the other side of the river, in  Thebes proper.    The untimely visit to the temple could not remain unobserved by the  colony of sages. Just as ants when a hand breaks in on their dwelling,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5460"],[0,"An Egyptian Princess — Complete (#4)"],[1," trees, while the pelicans, storks and cranes  squatted in groups on the shore under the shelter of the papyrus-reeds  and Nile-beans. The pelicans and storks remained motionless, their long  bills hidden beneath their wings, but the cranes were startled by the  mere beat of an oar, stretching their necks, and peering anxiously into  the distance, if they heard but the song of the boatmen. The air was  perfectly motionless, and the unbroken reflection of the moon, lying  like a silver shield on the surface of the water, proved that, wildly as  the Nile leaps over the cataracts, and rushes past the gigantic temples  of Upper Egypt, yet on approaching the sea by different arms, he can  abandon his impetuous course, and flow along in sober tranquillity.    On this moonlight night in the year 528 B. C. a bark was crossing the  almost currentless Canopic mouth of the Nile. On the raised deck at  the stern of this boat an Egyptian was sitting to guide the long  pole-rudder, and the half-naked boatmen within were singing as  they rowed. In the open cabin, which was something like a wooden  summer-house, sat two men, reclining on low cushions. They were  evidently not Egyptians; their Greek descent could be perceived even by  the moonlight. The elder was an unusually tall and powerful man of  more than sixty; thick grey curls, showing very little attempt at  arrangement, hung down over his short, firm throat; he wore a simple,  homely cloak, and kept his eyes gloomily fixed on the water. His  companion, on the contrary, a man perhaps twenty years younger, of a  slender and delicate build, was seldom still. Sometimes he gazed into  the heavens, sometimes made a remark to the steersman, disposed his  beautiful purple chlanis in fresh folds, or busied himself in the  arrangement of his scented brown curls, or his carefully curled beard.       [The chlanis was a light summer-mantle, worn especially by the more     elegant Athenians, and generally made of expensive materials. The     simpler cloak, the himation, was worn by the Doric Greeks, and     principally by the Spartans.]    The boat had left Naukratis, at that time the only Hellenic port in  Egypt, about half an hour before.       [This town, which will form the scene of a part of our tale, lies in     the northwest of the Nile Delta, in the Saitic Nomos or district, on     the left bank of the Canopic mouth of the river. According to     Strabo and Eusebius it was founded by Milesians, and Bunsen reckons     749 B. C. It seems that in the earliest times Greek ships were only     allowed to enter this mouth of the Nile in case of necessity. The     entire intercourse of the Egyptians with the hated strangers was, at     that time, restricted to the little island of Pharos lying opposite     to the town of Thonis.]    During their journey, the grey-haired, moody man had not spoken one  word, and the other had left him to his meditations. But now, as the  boat neared the shore, the restless traveller, rising from his couch,  called to his companion: \"We are just at our destination, Aristomachus!  That pleasant house to the left yonder, in the garden of palms which you  can see rising above the waters, is the dwelling of my friend Rhodopis.  It was built by her husband Charaxus, and all her friends, not excepting  the king himself, vie with one another in adding new beauties to it  year by year. A useless effort! Let them adorn that house with all the  treasures in the world, the woman who lives within will still remain its  best ornament!\"       [We are writing of the month of October, when the Nile begins to     sink. The inundations can now be accurately accounted for,     especially since the important and laborious synoptical work of H.     Barth and S. Baker. They are occasioned by the tropical rains, and     the melting of the snows on the high mountain-ranges at the Equator.     In the beginning of June a gradual rising of the Nile waters can be     perceived; between the 15th and 20th June, this changes to a rapid     increase; in the beginning of October the waters reach their highest     elevation, a point, which, even after having begun their retreat,     they once more attempt to attain; then, at first gradually, and     afterwards with ever increasing rapidity, they continue to sink. In     January, February and March, the Nile is still drying up; and in May     is at its lowest point, when the volume of its waters is only one-     twentieth of that in October.]    The old man sat up, threw a passing glance at the building, smoothed the  thick grey beard which clothed his cheeks and chin, but left the lips  free,--[The Spartans were not in the habit of wearing a beard on the  upper lip.]--and asked abruptly: \"Why so much enthusiasm, Phanes,  for this Rhodopis? How long have the Athenians been wont to extol  old women?\" At this remark the other smiled, and answered in a  self-satisfied tone, \"My knowledge of the world, and particularly of  women, is, I flatter myself, an extended one, and yet I repeat, that in  all Egypt I know of no nobler creature than this grey-haired woman. When  you have seen her and her lovely grandchild, and heard your favorite  melodies sung by her well-practised choir of slave-girls, I think you  will thank me for having brought you hither.\"--\"Yet,\" answered the  Spartan gravely, \"I should not have accompanied you, if I had not hoped  to meet Phryxus, the Delphian, here.\"    \"You will find him here; and besides, I cannot but hope that the songs  will cheer you, and dispel your gloomy thoughts.\" Aristomachus shook his  head in denial, and answered: \"To you, sanguine Athenians, the melodies  of your country may be cheering: but not so to me; as in many a  sleepless night of dreams, my longings will be doubled, not stilled by  the songs of Alkman.\"       [Alkman (Attic, Alkmaeon) flourished in Sparta about 650 B. C. His     mother was a Lydian slave in Sardes, and he came into the possession     of Agesides, who gave him his freedom. His beautiful songs soon     procured him the rights of a Lacedaemonian citizen. He was     appointed to the head-directorship in the entire department of music     in Lacedaemon and succeeded in naturalizing the soft Lydian music.     His language was the Doric-Laconian. After a life devoted to song,     the pleasures of the table and of love, he is said to have died of     a fearful disease. From the frequent choruses of virgins     (Parthenien) said to have been originally introduced by him, his     frequent songs in praise of women, and the friendly relations in     which he stood to the Spartan women (more especially to the fair     Megalostrata), he gained the name of the woman's poet.]    \"Do you think then,\" replied Phanes, \"that I have no longing for my  beloved Athens, for the scenes of our youthful games, for the busy life  of the market? Truly, the bread of exile is not less distasteful to my  palate than to yours, but, in the society afforded by this house, it  loses some of its bitterness, and when the dear melodies of Hellas, so  perfectly sung, fall on my ear, my native land rises before me as in a  vision, I see its pine and olive groves, its cold, emerald green rivers,  its blue sea, the shimmer of its towns, its snowy mountain-tops and  marble temples, and a half-sweet, half-bitter tear steals down my cheek  as the music ceases, and I awake to remember that I am in Egypt, in this  monotonous, hot, eccentric country, which, the gods be praised, I am  soon about to quit. But, Aristomachus, would you then avoid the few  Oases in the desert, because you must afterwards return to its sands  and drought? Would you fly from one happy hour, because days of sadness  await you later? But stop, here we are! Show a cheerful countenance, my  friend, for it becomes us not to enter the temple of the Charites with  sad hearts.\"--[The goddesses of grace and beauty, better known by their  Roman name of \"Graces.\"]    As Phanes uttered these words, they landed at the garden wall, washed  by the Nile. The Athenian bounded lightly from the boat, the Spartan  following with a heavier, firmer tread. Aristomachus had a wooden  leg, but his step was so firm, even when compared with that of the  light-footed Phanes, that it might have been thought to be his own limb.    The garden of Rhodopis was as full of sound, and scent and blossom as  a night in fairy-land. It was one labyrinth of acanthus shrubs,  yellow mimosa, the snowy gelder-rose, jasmine and lilac, red roses and  laburnums, overshadowed by tall palm-trees, acacias and balsam trees.  Large bats hovered softly on their delicate wings over the whole, and  sounds of mirth and song echoed from the river.    This garden had been laid out by an Egyptian, and the builders of  the Pyramids had already been celebrated for ages for their skill in  horticulture. They well understood how to mark out neat flower-beds,  plant groups of trees and shrubs in regular order, water the whole  by aqueducts and fountains, arrange arbors and summerhouses, and even  inclose the walks with artistically clipped hedges, and breed goldfish  in stone basins.    At the garden gate Phanes stopped, looked around him carefully and  listened; then shaking his head, \"I do not understand what this can  mean,\" he said. \"I hear no voices, there is not a single light to be  seen, the boats are all gone, and yet the flag is still flying at its  gay flag-staff, there, by the obelisks on each side of the gate.\"       [Obelisks bearing the name of the owner were sometimes to be seen     near the gates of the Egyptian country-houses. Flags too were not     uncommon, but these were almost exclusively to be found at the gates     of the temples, where to this day the iron sockets for the flagstaff     can still be seen. Neither were flags unknown to the Greeks. It     appears from some inscriptions on the staffs of the Pylons, that if     the former were not actually erected for lightning-rods, "]]]
