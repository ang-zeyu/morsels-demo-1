While Joseph extended a hearty welcome to the Doctor to come to  Commerce, he by no means held out any very flattering inducements to  him, as may be seen by his letters in answer to Bennett's expressing  his determination to join the Saints. The Prophet said:        I have no doubt that you would be of great service to this      community in practicing your profession, as well as those other      abilities of which you are in possession. Though to devote      your time and abilities in the cause of truth and a suffering      people, may not be the means of exalting you in the eyes of this      generation, or securing you the riches of this world, yet by so      doing you may rely on the approval of Jehovah, \"that blessing      which maketh rich and addeth no sorrow.\" * * * * * * Therefore, my      general invitation is, let all who will come, come and partake of      the poverty of Nauvoo, freely. I should be disposed to give you      a special invitation to come as early as possible, believing you      will be of great service to us. However, you must make your own      arrangements according to your circumstances. Were it possible for      you to come here this season to suffer affliction with the people      of God, no one will be more pleased to give you a cordial welcome      than myself.    Surely this was frank enough, and ought to have dispelled from the  Doctor's mind all thoughts of winning worldly fame, or gratifying vain  ambition, by linking his fortunes with those of the Church of Jesus  Christ. The whole course of the Prophet here outlined, and as further  set forth in the parts of this volume dealing with the case of John C.  Bennett, vindicates him and the Church from any complicity with the  wickedness and vileness of that man.    Bennett's attempted vindication of his course of procedure, and his  defense against the action of the Church in exposing his wickedness and  excommunicating him is, that from the beginning he came amongst the  Saints as a spy, to become acquainted with their alleged treasonable  designs against several of the western states, for the purpose of  exposing them; all which is set forth in a note at pp. 79, 80 of this  volume. All this was ridiculous; and the whole presentation of this  view of the matter in his book under the pompous title, _The History of  the Saints;_ or _An Expose of Joe Smith and Mormonism_, [A] convinced  nobody, since Bennett's insincerity and putridity of mind is evidenced  upon {XX} every page of his repulsive book. \"The role of traitor,\" says  H. H. Bancroft, in his history of Utah, dealing with John C. Bennett:--        The role of traitor is not one which in any wise brings credit to      the performer, either from one side or the other. However great      the service he may render us, we cannot but feel that he is false      hearted and vile. Many of the apostates, though they may not have      written books, declare that they joined the sect only to learn      their secrets and then expose them. These are the most contemptible      of all. There may be cases, where a young or inexperienced person,      through ignorance or susceptibility, has been carried away for      a time contrary to the dictates of cooler judgment; but the      statements of such persons are justly regarded with more or less      suspicion. Far better is it, far more honest and praiseworthy, for      him who, having unwittingly made a mistake, seeks to rectify it, to      go his way and say nothing about it; for if he talks of writing a      book for the good of others, as a warning, and that they may avoid      his errors, few will believe him. \"If he has proved traitor once,\"      they say, \"he will deceive again; and if he is sincere, we cannot      more than half believe him, for such an individual is never sure      of himself.\" John C. Bennett, general, doctor, methodist preacher,      and quack, is from his own showing a bad man. He devotes some      fifty pages to the vindication of his character, which would not      be necessary were he honest; other fifty are given to defaming his      late worshipful patron Joseph Smith, which would never have been      written were he true. When a man thrusts in your face three-score      certificates of his good character, each signed by from one to a      dozen persons, you may know that he is a very great rascal. Nor      are we disappointed here. This author is a charlatan, pure and      simple; such was he when he joined the Mormons, and before and      after. We may credit him fully when he says, \"I never believed      in them or their doctrines;\" although in a letter to Dr. Dyer,      dated Nauvoo, Jan. 20, 1842, he declares: \"My heart is filled with      indignation, and my blood boils within me, when I contemplate the      vast injustice and cruelty which Missouri has meted out to the      great philanthropist and devout Christian, General Joseph Smith,      and his honest and faithful adherents.\" When, however, he affects      patriotism and lofty devotion to the welfare of his fellow-men,      pretending to have joined the society in order to frustrate \"a      daring and colossal scheme of rebellion and usurpation throughout      the north-western states, . . . . a despotic military and religions      empire, the head of which, as emperor and pope, was to be Joseph      Smith,\" we know that the writer is well aware that it is all      nonsense. Nor do we believe that he was induced to print his book      \"by a desire to expose the enormous iniquities which have been      perpetrated by one of the grossest and most infamous impostors that      ever appeared upon the face of the earth.\" We have heard and are      still hearing so much of that kind of talk from some of the worst      men in the community that it is becoming somewhat stale, and if      the general really does not know better than this why he wrote his      book, perhaps he will excuse me for telling him that it was, first,      for notoriety; second, for money; and third, in order to make      people think him a better and greater man than he is. When a man's      ambition is pitched so low, it is a pity that he should not have      the gratification of success. Bravely, then, the general proceeded      to offer himself on the altar of his country, \"to overthrow the      impostor and expose {XXI} his iniquity\" by \"professing himself a      convert to his doctrines;\" for \"the fruition of his hopeful project      would, of course, have been preceded by plunder, devastation,      and bloodshed, and by all the countless horrors which invariably      accompany civil war.\" We are still more impressed when we read:      \"I was quite aware of the danger I ran\"--that of being kicked      out of some back door--\"but none of these things deterred me.\"      Without wasting more time and space upon the man, we are well      enough prepared to place a proper estimate upon his statements,      particularly when we take into account that, in May of the very      year in which his book was published, he went before Alderman Wells      and made affidavit that Joseph Smith was an honest, virtuous,      sincere, high-minded, and patriotic man. He says himself that he      solemnly swore to be true to the Mormons and not reveal their      secrets, and now in breaking that oath he has the audacity to ask      us to regard him as an honest and truthful man! In some measure,      at least, the statements of such men as this, taken up by the      press and people, and reiterated throughout the land, have given      the Latter-day Saints a worse name than they deserve. Some of his      charges are too coarse and filthy for repetition. [B]    [Footnote A: Published in Boston, 1842]    [Footnote B: Banecroft's History of Utah, pp. 150, 151 _note_.]    The only description I have seen of Dr. Bennett is given in the _Essex  County Washingtonian_, published in Salem, Massachusetts, and that is  contained in the issue of the fifteenth of September, 1842. According  to that description he was a man of about five feet nine inches high,  well formed, black hair sprinkled with gray, dark complexion, a rather  thin face, and black restless eyes.    He finally died in obscurity, and also, it is said, in poverty,  (Cannon's _Life of Joseph Smith_, p. 377).    _The Attempted Assassination of Ex-Governor Boggs of Missouri_.    When an attempt was made to assassinate ex-Governor Boggs of Missouri  it was perhaps to be expected that suspicion would fall upon the Mormon  people and upon the head of Joseph Smith especially. Surely Boggs had  given sufficient provocation to that people to make it probable that  some fanatic of their number might undertake in misguided zeal, the  act of revenge; and surely there would not be wanting those who would  say that Joseph Smith in his capacity as Prophet had predicted the  violent taking off of the ex-governor. Joseph Smith, however, in his  communication to the _Quincy Whig_, in which appeared the first account  of the rumored assassination of Boggs, promptly denied making the  alleged prediction, and also denied any complicity whatsoever in the  wretched business. It is only just to his memory to say that in all the  investigation had upon the subject, historically, or judicially, his  denial is not controverted. Even in the case of Orrin Porter Rockwell  {XXII} who was charged directly with the attempted assassination and  taken to Jackson county, Missouri, for trial, it had to be admitted  that \"there was not sufficient proof adduced against him to justify  an indictment for shooting at ex-Governor Boggs, and the grand  jury therefore did not indict him for that offense.\" (_Independent  Expositor_, _Nile's Register_, Sept. 30, 1843.)

The Time Period._    The time-period covered in this sixth volume of the HISTORY OF THE  CHURCH is less than one year. Nine months and twenty-eight days, to be  exact; or from the 1st of September, 1843, to the 29th of June, 1844.  Events within this period are therefore given in elaborate detail. The  general reader and the student of our history will find in this volume  a larger collection of documents, official and otherwise, covering this  period, than will be found elsewhere.    This volume also closes the first Period of our Church History,  the period marked off by two events: (1) the birth of the Prophet  Joseph Smith; and (2) his martyrdom and that of his brother Hyrum, at  Carthage, Illinois.    The Journal History of the Prophet, that great source of historical  knowledge concerning the development of the New Dispensation, closes  with his entry of the 22nd of June, 1844. After that, for our knowledge  of the remaining events of the Prophet's life, we are dependent upon  collections of _data_ by the Church historians from public and private  sources, of which collections there are two: the first extends from  the 22nd of June to the 29th of that month, and forms the concluding  chapters of this volume; the second begins also with the 22nd of June,  and extends to the 8th of August, 1844; at which time the Twelve  Apostles were sustained for the time being as the presiding council of  the Church. This second collection of _data_ by the Church historians  will open Volume VII of this History.    In the present volume we see the Prophet's brave struggle against the  overwhelming odds of his foes--foes within the Church, false brethren;  and foes without the Church--the combination of political and sectarian  enemies fixed in their determination to kill him, destroy Nauvoo, and  expel the Saints from Illinois: for all these things were included in  the program of the anti-Mormons of Illinois, even before the death  of the Prophet was encompassed. Three score and seven years now give  perspective to the stirring events in which the really great drama was  enacted; and from that vantage ground of perspective said events may  be reviewed to the enlightenment of those who seek to know the truth,  {XXII} and the injustice of the things enacted in Illinois during the  closing months of the Prophet Joseph's earthly career.    _II. Why the Latter-day Saints were Welcomed to Illinois._    On the one hand, in the above mentioned struggle, was a people who but  a few years before had been welcomed into Illinois as exiles from a  neighboring state, the victims of a cruel and ignorant intolerance.  They were welcomed, in part, because of the injustice to which they  had been subjected in a neighboring state, and because their physical  sufferings, arising from want of shelter and food in an inclement  season of the year to which they were exposed, was such as to move  adamantine hearts to pity. Also they were welcomed because, as pointed  out in the Introduction to Volume IV of this HISTORY, the state of  Illinois needed augmentation of her population by just such a people  as the Latter-day Saints were--industrious, frugal, skilled mechanics,  successful farmers, experienced men of affairs, men capable of trade  and commerce, enterprising and with a larger proportion of educated  men and women among them than was to be found among the people of  western Illinois in those days. I do not here employ the language of  adulation on the one hand, nor seek to make invidious distinctions upon  the other. Either would be vain, since the well-known and accepted  facts of history would disprove the declarations made if not founded  in truth. The fact is, however, that all that is claimed above for  the Missouri exiled Latter-day Saints is true and well-attested by  their achievements in settling Nauvoo, which in four years rose from  a ware-house or two and a few half tumbledown shacks on the banks of  the river, and called \"Commerce,\" to the dignity of being the first  city in Illinois in population and commercial enterprise, and also gave  promise of developing into a manufacturing center of great importance.  This last item was evidenced in the fact that the founder of Nauvoo,  President Joseph Smith, and the Nauvoo city council appreciated the  possibilities in the water power of the Lower Des Moines Rapids in  the Mississippi, at the head of which the city was located. Reference  to his journal entry for the 23rd of September (this volume, p. 80)  will witness that he suggested that a petition be sent to the national  Congress for the construction of a canal around the rapids to overcome  the obstruction for the free passage of river craft, which the rapids  prevented during the low water period of each year, and thus enhance  the value of the great stream to the inland commerce of the west. [1]  Reference again to President Smith's journal {XXIII} entry for the 8th  of December, 1843 (this volume, p. 103) will disclose the fact that he  gave instruction in the forenoon to his clerk to draw a plan for a dam  in the Mississippi; and that in the afternoon of the same day the city  council met and passed an ordinance authorizing Joseph Smith to \"erect  a dam of suitable height to propel mills and machinery from any point  within the limits of said city, and below the Nauvoo House;\" also in  connection with this dam to construct a \"harbor or basin for steamboats  and other craft;\" and to construct docks, wharfs and landings,\" the  wharfage fees to be \"regulated by ordinance of said city (this volume  p. 106).    _III. Nauvoo as a Possible Manufacturing Center._    What further contributed to the promise that Nauvoo would be a great  manufacturing center as well as the center of an immense agricultural  region with a splendid commercial outlet, was the fact that artisans  and tradesmen of the very first order in skill, were rapidly gathering  into the city, not only from the New England and other Eastern states  of our own country, but also from the British Isles. It was inevitable  if let alone that Nauvoo would become the greatest manufacturing  center of Illinois, and among the first of such cities in the United  States. The Prophet did not live to see even a commencement made upon  these large enterprises he had conceived, but subsequently his zealous  followers organized a company to carry them to a successful conclusion  under the title of \"The Nauvoo Water Power Company,\" [2] which began  the construction of the dam on the 29th of April, 1845; but which had  to be abandoned because of the hostilities that soon after increased  and continued until they culminated in the expulsion of the Latter-day  Saints from Illinois. [3]    {XXIV} In addition to these measures, manufacturing and agricultural  associations were incorporated; also the \"Nauvoo House Associations\"  for the erection of a hotel, ambitious to be known as the finest  hostelry in the Upper Mississippi country. One of the agricultural  associations, known as the \"Big Field Corporation,\" held six sections,  or three thousand eight hundred and forty acres of land east of Nauvoo;  and the year following the Prophet's death the company harvested about  thirty thousand bushels of corn, nearly the same amount of wheat,  besides an \"abundance of oats, barley, buckwheat, potatoes and other  vegetables.\" [4]    _IV. Educational Measures at Nauvoo._    And not only in material things was the superior character of  Nauvoo's founders and builders proclaimed; but equally broad and  comprehensive were their preparations for an educational system. By  their city charter they were empowered to establish an institution of  learning within the limits of the city for the teaching of the arts  and sciences and learned professions, to be called the \"University  of the City of Nauvoo;\" also a common school system for the city,  all of which was in course of development even in the early years  of Nauvoo's existence. And in addition to these direct educational  institutions of common schools and"]]]
