DONNER [_Confronting the giants._          Fasolt and Fafner,        Have ye not felt    With what weight my hammer falls?    FAFNER          What means thy threat?    FASOLT          What wouldst thou here?    No strife we desire;    We want but our due reward.    DONNER          Oft I've doled out        Giants their due:    Come, your reward is here    Waiting, full measure and more!            [_He swings his hammer._    WOTAN            [_Stretching out his spear between the combatants._          Hold, thou fierce one!        Nothing by force!        All bonds and treaties        My spear protects;    Spare then thy hammer's haft!    FREIA          Woe's me! Woe's me!        Wotan forsakes me!    FRICKA          Can such be thy thought,        Merciless man?    WOTAN            [_Turns away and sees Loge coming._            There comes Loge!        Hot is thy haste        Smoothly to settle    Thy sorry, badly-made bargain!    LOGE            [_Has come up out of the valley in the background._          What is this bargain        That I am blamed for?--        The one with the giants    That thou thyself didst decide?        O'er hill and o'er hollow        Drives me my whim;        House and hearth        I do not crave.        Donner and Froh,    They dream but of roof and room:        Wedding, must have    A home in which to dwell,        A stately hall,        A fortress fast.    It was such Wotan wished.        Hall and house,        Castle, court,        The blissful abode    Now stands complete and strong.        I proved the lordly        Pile myself;        In fear of flaws,        Scanning it close.        Fasolt and Fafner        Faithful I found;    Firm-bedded is each stone.        I was not slothful        Like many here:    Who calls me sluggard, he lies!    WOTAN          Cunningly        Thou wouldst escape!        Warned be, and wisely    Turn from attempts to deceive.        Of all the Gods        I alone stood by thee        As thy friend,    In the gang that trusted thee not.    Now speak, and to the point!    For when the builders at first    As wage Freia demanded,        I gave way only,        Trusting thy word    When thou didst solemnly promise    To ransom the noble pledge.    LOGE          Perplexed to puzzle,        Plans to ponder        For its redeeming--    That promise I gave;        But to discover        What cannot be,        What none can do,    No man can possibly promise.    FRICKA          See the treacherous        Rogue thou didst trust!    FROH          Named art Loge,        But liar I call thee!    DONNER          Accurs√®d flame,        I will quench thy fire!    LOGE          From their shame to shelter,        Foolish folk flout me.            [_Donner threatens to strike Loge._    WOTAN            [_Stepping between them._      Forbear and let him alone!    Ye wot not Loge's wiles.        His advice,        Given slowly, gains    Both in weight and in worth.    FAFNER          Do not dally;        Promptly pay!    FASOLT        Long waits our reward.    WOTAN            _Turns sternly to Loge._          Speak up surly one!        Fail me not!    How far hast thou ranged and roamed?    LOGE          Still with reproach        Is Loge paid!        Concerned but for thee,        Thorough and swift,        I searched and ransacked        To the ends of the earth    To find a ransom for Freia    Fair to the giants and just.        In vain the search,        Convincing at last        That the world contains        Nothing so sweet    That a man will take it instead    Of woman's love and delight.            [_All seem surprised and taken aback._      Where life moves and has being,    In water, earth and air        I questioned,        Asking of all things,        Where weak still is strength,        And germs only stirring,        What men thought dear--        And stronger deemed--    Than woman's love and delight.    But where life moves and has being        My questions met        But with laughter and scorn.        In water, earth and air        Woman and love        Will none forego.            [_Varied gestures of amazement._          One man, one only,        I met who, renouncing love,        Prized ruddy gold    Above any woman's grace.    The Rhine's pure-gleaming children    Told me of their sorrow.        The Nibelung,        Night-Alberich,        Wooed for the favour        Of the swimmers in vain,        And vengeance took,    Stealing the Rhinegold they guard.        He thinks it now        A thing beyond price,    Greater than woman's grace.        For their glittering toy        Thus torn from the deep    The sorrowful maids lamented.        They pray, Wotan,        Pleading to thee,    That thy wrath may fall on the robber        The gold too        They would have thee grant them        To guard in the water for ever.        Loge promised        The maidens to tell thee,    And, keeping faith, he has told.    [Illustration: plate 07      \"The Rhine's pure-gleaming children       Told me of their sorrow\"]    WOTAN          Dull thou must be        Or downright knavish!    In parlous plight myself,    What help have I for others?    FASOLT            [_Who has been listening attentively, to Fafner._          The Niblung has much annoyed us;        I greatly grudge him this Rhinegold;        But such his craft and cunning,        He has never been caught.    FAFNER          Other malice        Ponders the Niblung;    Gains he might from gold        Listen, Loge!        Tell us the truth.    What wondrous gift has the gold,    That the dwarf desires it so?    LOGE          A plaything,        In the waves providing    Children with laughter and sport,        It gives, when to golden        Ring it is rounded,    Power and might unmatched;    It wins its owner the world.    WOTAN [_Thoughtfully._          Rumours I have heard        Of the Rhinegold;        Runes of riches    Hide in its ruddy glow;        Pelf and power    Are by the ring bestowed.    FRICKA [_Softly to Loge._          Could this gaud,        This gleaming trinket        Forged from the gold,    Be worn by a woman too?    LOGE          The wife who wore        That glittering charm        Never would lose        Her husband's love--    That charm which dwarfs are welding,    Working in thrall to the ring.    FRICKA [_Coaxingly to Wotan._          O could but my husband        Come by the ring!    WOTAN            _As if falling more and more under the influence of          a spell._          Methinks it were wisdom,    Won I the ring to my service.        But say, Loge,        How shall I learn    To forge and fashion it true?    LOGE          A magic rune    Can round the golden ring.        No one knows it,    Yet plain the spell to him    Who happy love forswears.            [_Wotan turns away in annoyance._          That suits thee not;        Thou art too late too.    Alberich did not delay;        Fearless he mastered        The potent spell,            [_Harshly._      And wrought aright was the ring.    DONNER _To Wotan._          We should all be        Under the dwarf,    Were not the ring from him wrested.    WOTAN          The ring I must capture!    FROH          Lightly now,    Without cursing love it were won.    LOGE          Just so:    Without guile, as in children's games!    WOTAN          Then tell us how.    LOGE            By theft!        What a thief stole        Steal thou from the thief;    How better could object be won?        But with baleful arms        Battles Alberich.        Wary, wise        Must be thy scheming,    If the thief thou wouldst confound,            _With warmth._          And restore the ruddy        And golden toy,    The Rhinegold, to the maidens.    For this they pray and implore.    WOTAN          The river-maidens?        What profit were mine?    FRICKA          Of that billow-born brood        Bring me no tidings,        For they have wooed        To my woe    Full many a man to their caves.            _Wotan stands silent, struggling with himself. The          other Gods gaze at him in mute suspense. Fafner,          meanwhile, has been consulting aside with Fasolt._    FAFNER          Worth far more than Freia        Were the glittering gold.        Eternal youth, too, were his        Who could use the charm in its quest.            [_Fasolt's gestures indicate that he is being          convinced against his will. Fafner and Fasolt          approach Wotan again._    FAFNER          Hear, Wotan,        Our word while we wait;    Freia we will restore you,        And will take        Paltrier payment:    The Niblung's red-gleaming gold    Will guerdon us giants rude.    WOTAN          Ye must be mad!        With what I possess not    How can I, shameless ones, pay you?    FAFNER          Hard labour        Went to those walls;        How easy        With fraud-aided force    (What our malice never achieved)    The Niblung to break and bind!    [Illustration: Plate 08, Fasolt suddenly seizes Freia and drags her to  one side with Fafner]    WOTAN [_More quickly._          Why should I make        War on the Niblung?--    Fight, your foe to confound?        Insolent        And greedily grasping    Dolts you grow through my debt!    FASOLT            [_Suddenly seizes Freia and drags her to one side          with Fafner._          Maiden, come!        We claim thee ours!    As pledge thou shalt be held    Till the ransom is paid.    FREIA [_Screaming_.      Woe's me! Woe's me! Woe!    FAFNER          From your midst        We bear her forth!

The King didn't know about the Magnet, of course; but it made him love  the shaggy man at once.    \"Do just as you please about going away,\" he said; \"but I'd like to  show you the sights of my city and to entertain your party while you  are here.  We feel highly honored to have little Dorothy with us, I  assure you, and we appreciate her kindness in making us a visit.  For  whatever country Dorothy visits is sure to become famous.\"    This speech greatly surprised the little girl, who asked:    \"How did your Majesty know my name?\"    \"Why, everybody knows you, my dear,\" said the Fox-King.  \"Don't you  realize that?  You are quite an important personage since Princess Ozma  of Oz made you her friend.\"    \"Do you know Ozma?\" she asked, wondering.    \"I regret to say that I do not,\" he answered, sadly; \"but I hope to  meet her soon.  You know the Princess Ozma is to celebrate her birthday  on the twenty-first of this month.\"    \"Is she?\" said Dorothy.  \"I didn't know that.\"    \"Yes; it is to be the most brilliant royal ceremony ever held in any  city in Fairyland, and I hope you will try to get me an invitation.\"    Dorothy thought a moment.    \"I'm sure Ozma would invite you if I asked her,\" she said; \"but how  could you get to the Land of Oz and the Emerald City?  It's a good way  from Kansas.\"    \"Kansas!\" he exclaimed, surprised.    \"Why, yes; we are in Kansas now, aren't we?\" she returned.    \"What a queer notion!\" cried the Fox-King, beginning to laugh.  \"Whatever made you think this is Kansas?\"    \"I left Uncle Henry's farm only about two hours ago; that's the  reason,\" she said, rather perplexed.    \"But, tell me, my dear, did you ever see so wonderful a city as  Foxville in Kansas?\" he questioned.    \"No, your Majesty.\"    \"And haven't you traveled from Oz to Kansas in less than half a jiffy,  by means of the Silver Shoes and the Magic Belt?\"    \"Yes, your Majesty,\" she acknowledged.    \"Then why do you wonder that an hour or two could bring you to  Foxville, which is nearer to Oz than it is to Kansas?\"    \"Dear me!\" exclaimed Dorothy; \"is this another fairy adventure?\"    \"It seems to be,\" said the Fox-King, smiling.    Dorothy turned to the shaggy man, and her face was grave and  reproachful.    \"Are you a magician? or a fairy in disguise?\" she asked.  \"Did you  enchant me when you asked the way to Butterfield?\"    The shaggy man shook his head.    \"Who ever heard of a shaggy fairy?\" he replied.  \"No, Dorothy, my dear;  I'm not to blame for this journey in any way, I assure you.  There's  been something strange about me ever since I owned the Love Magnet; but  I don't know what it is any more than you do.  I didn't try to get you  away from home, at all.  If you want to find your way back to the farm  I'll go with you willingly, and do my best to help you.\"    \"Never mind,\" said the little girl, thoughtfully.  \"There isn't so much  to see in Kansas as there is here, and I guess Aunt Em won't be VERY  much worried; that is, if I don't stay away too long.\"    \"That's right,\" declared the Fox-King, nodding approval.  \"Be contented  with your lot, whatever it happens to be, if you are wise.  Which  reminds me that you have a new companion on this adventure--he looks  very clever and bright.\"    \"He is,\" said Dorothy; and the shaggy man added:    \"That's his name, your Royal Foxiness--Button-Bright.\"          4.  King Dox      It was amusing to note the expression on the face of King Dox as he  looked the boy over, from his sailor hat to his stubby shoes, and it  was equally diverting to watch Button-Bright stare at the King in  return.  No fox ever beheld a fresher, fairer child's face, and no  child had ever before heard a fox talk, or met with one who dressed so  handsomely and ruled so big a city.  I am sorry to say that no one had  ever told the little boy much about fairies of any kind; this being the  case, it is easy to understand how much this strange experience  startled and astonished him.    \"How do you like us?\" asked the King.    \"Don't know,\" said Button-Bright.    \"Of course you don't.  It's too short an acquaintance,\" returned his  Majesty.  \"What do you suppose my name is?\"    \"Don't know,\" said Button-Bright.    \"How should you?  Well, I'll tell you.  My private name is Dox, but a  King can't be called by his private name; he has to take one that is  official.  Therefore my official name is King Renard the Fourth.  Ren-ard with the accent on the 'Ren'.\"    \"What's 'ren'?\" asked Button-Bright.    \"How clever!\" exclaimed the King, turning a pleased face toward his  counselors.  \"This boy is indeed remarkably bright.  'What's 'ren'?' he  asks; and of course 'ren' is nothing at all, all by itself.  Yes, he's  very bright indeed.\"    \"That question is what your Majesty might call foxy,\" said one of the  counselors, an old grey fox.    \"So it is,\" declared the King.  Turning again to Button-Bright, he  asked:    \"Having told you my name, what would you call me?\"    \"King Dox,\" said the boy.    \"Why?\"    \"'Cause 'ren''s nothing at all,\" was the reply.    \"Good!  Very good indeed!  You certainly have a brilliant mind.  Do you  know why two and two make four?\"    \"No,\" said Button-Bright.    \"Clever! clever indeed!  Of course you don't know.  Nobody knows why;  we only know it's so, and can't tell why it's so.  Button-Bright, those  curls and blue eyes do not go well with so much wisdom.  They make you  look too youthful, and hide your real cleverness.  Therefore, I will do  you a great favor.  I will confer upon you the head of a fox, so that  you may hereafter look as bright as you really are.\"    As he spoke the King waved his paw toward the boy, and at once the  pretty curls and fresh round face and big blue eyes were gone, while in  their place a fox's head appeared upon Button-Bright's shoulders--a  hairy head with a sharp nose, pointed ears, and keen little eyes.    \"Oh, don't do that!\" cried Dorothy, shrinking back from her transformed  companion with a shocked and dismayed face.    \"Too late, my dear; it's done.  But you also shall have a fox's head if  you can prove you're as clever as Button-Bright.\"    \"I don't want it; it's dreadful!\" she exclaimed; and, hearing this  verdict, Button-Bright began to boo-hoo just as if he were still a  little boy.    \"How can you call that lovely head dreadful?\" asked the King.  \"It's a  much prettier face than he had before, to my notion, and my wife says  I'm a good judge of beauty.  Don't cry, little fox-boy.  Laugh and be  proud, because you are so highly favored.  How do you like the new  head, Button-Bright?\"    \"D-d-don't n-n-n-know!\" sobbed the child.    \"Please, PLEASE change him back again, your Majesty!\" begged Dorothy.    King Renard IV shook his head.    \"I can't do that,\" he said; \"I haven't the power, even if I wanted to.  No, Button-Bright must wear his fox head, and he'll be sure to love it  dearly as soon as he gets used to it.\"    Both the shaggy man and Dorothy looked grave and anxious, for they were  sorrowful that such a misfortune had overtaken their little companion.  Toto barked at the fox-boy once or twice, not realizing it was his  former friend who now wore the animal head; but Dorothy cuffed the dog  and made him stop.  As for the foxes, they all seemed to think  Button-Bright's new head very becoming and that their King had  conferred a great honor on this little stranger.  It was funny to see  the boy reach up to feel of his sharp nose and wide mouth, and wail  afresh with grief.  He wagged his ears in a comical manner and tears  were in his little black eyes.  But Dorothy couldn't laugh at her  friend just yet, because she felt so sorry.    Just then three little fox-princesses, daughters of the King, entered  the room, and when they saw Button-Bright one exclaimed: \"How lovely he  is!\" and the next one cried in delight: \"How sweet he is!\" and the  third princess clapped her hands with pleasure and said, \"How beautiful  he is!\"    Button-Bright stopped crying and asked timidly:    \"Am I?\"    \"In all the world there is not another face so pretty,\" declared the  biggest fox-princess.    \"You must live with us always, and be our brother,\" said the next.    \"We shall all love you dearly,\" the third said.    This praise did much to comfort the boy, and he looked around and tried  to smile.  It was a pitiful attempt, because the fox face was new and  stiff, and Dorothy thought his expression more stupid than before the  transformation.    \"I think we ought to be going now,\" said the shaggy man, uneasily, for  he didn't know what the King might take into his head to do next.    \"Don't leave us yet, I beg of you,\" pleaded King Renard.  \"I intend to  have several days of feasting and merry-making in honor of your visit.\"    \"Have it after we're gone, for we can't wait,\" said Dorothy, decidedly.  But seeing this displeased the King, she added: \"If I'm going to get  Ozma to invite you to her party I'll have to find her as soon as  poss'ble, you know.\"    In spite of all the beauty of Foxville and the gorgeous dresses of its  inhabitants, both the girl and the shaggy man felt they were not quite  safe there, and would be glad to see the last of it.    \"But it is now evening,\" the King reminded them, \"and you must stay  with us until morning, anyhow.  Therefore, I invite you to be my guests  at dinner, and to attend the "]]]
