Nine of these were to be built by Goodyear which had at least given some  study to the principles, had built a few balloons, one of which, flown  by its engineers out of Paris, had won the James Gordon Bennett Cup  Race.    No one in this country, however, knew much about building airships, and  less about flying them after they were built. Operating bases would have  to be built and the very construction plants as well. The first Goodyear  airship under the Navy order was completed before the airship dock  (hangar) at Wingfoot Lake was ready, and the ship had to be erected in  Chicago and flown in.    The engineers who built it, Upson and Preston, made their first airship  flight in delivering the ship to Akron, using theoretical principles  applied in the international balloon race the year before, to make up  for their lack of practical experience.    Those first ships were small, slow, lacked range, uncovered many  shortcomings. Flight training was done under adverse circumstances. Men  had to teach themselves to fly airships, then teach others to fly them.    The pilots were chiefly engineering students from the colleges, with a  sprinkling of Navy officers. They had to take their advanced training  abroad at British and French bases, because there were no facilities  here, and in fact did most of their flying abroad. By the end of the war  American pilots were manning three British airship bases and had taken  over practically all the French operations, including the large base at  Paimboeuf, across the Loire from St. Nazaire, on the French coast.    So the war was well along before American bases were set up and manned.  These were at Chatham, Mass., at Montauk and Rockaway, N. Y., at Cape  May, Norfolk and Key West. Like the airplane patrols the blimps saw  little action, though they had an advantage in that they could stay out  all day, while the short range planes of 1917-18 had to come back every  few hours to refuel.    A patrol airship at Chatham, Mass. missed its chance in that it was  adrift at sea with engine trouble when the German U-156 slipped into the  harbor at nearby Orleans and wiped out some fishing boats--though it  might have done no better than the first plane which reached the scene,  whose few bombs did not explode.    The blimp patrols, however, uncovered one other type of activity. More  than once they spotted suspicious looking craft emerging under cover of  fog, from remote coves and inlets along the Long Island coast, fishing  boats and barges with improvised power plant and curious looking  paraphernalia on deck. Keeping the stranger in sight the blimp summoned  armored craft from shore which sent boarding crews on, found mines  destined for the New York steamship lanes.    A more important result of the blimp operations was the improvements in  design which were found, particularly in the \"C\" type ship, brought out  in 1918, of which 20 were built. They had much better performance in  range, power, could make 60 miles speed, were faster than any airships  except the Zeppelins. Navy officers and crews came to have high respect  for them.        [Illustration: Here's the gallant C-5, which with a bit of luck      would have been the first aircraft to cross the Atlantic. (U. S.

(U. S. Navy photo)]    Which led to one of the interesting aeronautic adventure stories of the  period. It happened just after the Armistice.    Men had come out of the war with imaginations afire over the  possibilities of aircraft. One challenge lay open--the Atlantic--no one  had flown it.    In the breathing spell brought by the Armistice, the British were  preparing their new Zeppelin R-34 for the crossing; two English planes  were being shipped to Newfoundland to try to fly back; the U. S. Navy  had a seaplane crossing in prospect. There was even a German plan. A new  Zeppelin had just been finished at Friedrichshafen when the Armistice  was signed, and the crew planned to fly it to America as a  demonstration--but authorities got wind of it and blocked the venture.    But of all the Atlantic crossings about which men were dreaming in early  1919, none is more interesting than the one projected for the little  blimps.    The C-5, newest of the non-rigid airships built for the Navy, was  stationed at Montauk, and there one night a group of officers sat  intensively studying charts and weather maps. St. John's, Newfoundland,  1,400 miles away, would be the first leg of the trip. It was easily  within the cruising radius of the ship, particularly if they got helping  winds, which they should if the time was carefully picked. From there to  Ireland was another 1850 miles, also within range with the prevailing  westerly winds.    Permission was asked from Washington, and the Navy flashed back its  approval and its blessing, assigned five experienced officers to the  project: Lieut. Comdr. Coil, Lieuts. Lawrence, Little, Preston, and  Peck. The USS Chicago was sent ahead to St. John's to stand by and give  any help needed.    Shortly after sunrise on May 15, 1919, motors were warmed up and the  ship shoved off from the tip of Long Island with six men aboard headed  for Newfoundland. At 7 o'clock the next morning they circled over the  deck of the _Chicago_, dropped their handling lines to the waiting  ground crew on a rocky point at St. John's. The first leg had been made  in a little more than 24 hours, at an average speed of nearly 60 miles  per hour.    The morning was clear and comparatively calm. Coil and Lawrence went  aboard the _Chicago_ to catch a little sleep before the final hop over  the ocean. The others saw to re-fueling the C-5, stowing provisions  aboard, topping off a bit of hydrogen from the cylinders alongside.  Mechanics swarmed over the motors. All was well.    But about 10 o'clock gusts began to sweep down from Hudson's Bay,  dragging the ground crew over the rocks. There were no mooring masts in  those days. A modern mast would have saved the ship. More sailors were  put on the lines and word sent to Coil and Lawrence. If the ground crew  could hold the ship till the pilots could get aboard and cut loose, the  storm would give them a flying start over the Atlantic.    But the wind blew steadily stronger as the commander was hurrying  ashore. It reached gale force, hurricane force, 40 knots, 60 knots in  gusts, varying in direction crazily around a 60-degree arc. It picked  the ship up and slammed it down, damaging the fuselage, breaking a  propeller. Little and Peck climbed aboard to pull the rip panel and let  the gas out. After the storm passed, they could cement the panel back  in, reinflate the bag and go on.    But the fates were against them. The cord leading to the rip panel  broke. Desperately, the two men started climbing up the suspension  cables to the gas bag with knives, planning to rip the panel out by  hand. But a tremendous gust caught the ship, lifted it up. Seeing the  danger to the crew, Peck shouted to them to let go, and he and Little  dropped over the side. Little broke an ankle.    The ship surged upward, crewless, set off like another \"Flying Dutchman\"  across the Atlantic, was never seen again.    Just three days later Hawker and Grieve set out from St. John's, landed  in the ocean. Alcock and Brown cut loose their landing gear a month  later and landed in Ireland. One of the three Navy seaplanes, the NC-4,  reached Europe on May 31 and the British dirigible R-34 set out on July  2 for its successful round trip to Mitchel Field.    But for a trick of fate and the lack of equipment available today, a  blimp would have been first to get across.    Many things happened in the airship field between the two wars, but most  of them affected non-rigid airships only indirectly, as the Navy was  primarily concerned with the larger rigids.    The loss of the Hindenburg by hydrogen fire (which American helium would  have prevented), coming on the heels of tragic setbacks in this country  was enough to dismay anyone except Commander C. E. Rosendahl and his  stouthearted associates at Lakehurst Naval Air Station.    They didn't give up. Setbacks were inevitable to progress. Count  Zeppelin had built and lost five rigid airships prior to 1909, but he  went on to build ships which were flown successfully in war and peace.  If the Germans, using hydrogen, could do this, Americans, with helium,  should not find it impossible, Lakehurst reasoned. And if they had no  rigid airships to fly and no immediate likelihood of getting any they  would use blimps.    The Navy was more familiar than the public with what the British and  French airships had accomplished in the first war. Studying, as all Navy  officers were doing in that period, the various possibilities of attack  and defense, in case the war then threatening Europe should sweep across  the Atlantic, they came to the conclusion that the coast line of America  was no more remote from German submarines in 1938 than the coast of  England was in 1914.    The airplane had improved vastly in speed, range, and striking power,  and their very multiplicity had ruled out the blimps over the English  channel, even if helium was available, but those conclusions did not  hold along the American coast.    The heroic part played by Allied blimps was a part of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5157"],[0,"How I Found Livingstone (#4)"],[1,"the unconquerable. Be patient, and  don't fret, that is my advice, or you won't live long here.\"    There were three or four intensely busy men, though, at Zanzibar, who  were out at all hours of the day. I know one, an American; I fancy  I hear the quick pit-pat of his feet on the pavement beneath the  Consulate, his cheery voice ringing the salutation, \"Yambo!\" to every  one he met; and he had lived at Zanzibar twelve years.    I know another, one of the sturdiest of Scotchmen, a most  pleasant-mannered and unaffected man, sincere in whatever he did  or said, who has lived at Zanzibar several years, subject to the  infructuosities of the business he has been engaged in, as well as to  the calor and ennui of the climate, who yet presents as formidable a  front as ever to the apathetic native of Zanzibar. No man can charge  Capt. H. C. Fraser, formerly of the Indian Navy, with being apathetic.    I might with ease give evidence of the industry of others, but they are  all my friends, and they are all good. The American, English, German,  and French residents have ever treated me with a courtesy and kindness  I am not disposed to forget. Taken as a body, it would be hard to find  a more generous or hospitable colony of white men in any part of the  world.        CHAPTER III. -- ORGANIZATION OF THE EXPEDITION.      I was totally ignorant of the interior, and it was difficult at first to  know, what I needed, in order to take an Expedition into Central Africa.  Time was precious, also, and much of it could not be devoted to inquiry  and investigation. In a case like this, it would have been a godsend, I  thought, had either of the three gentlemen, Captains Burton, Speke,  or Grant, given some information on these points; had they devoted a  chapter upon, \"How to get ready an Expedition for Central Africa.\" The  purpose of this chapter, then, is to relate how I set about it, that  other travellers coming after me may have the benefit of my experience.    These are some of the questions I asked myself, as I tossed on my bed at  night:--    \"How much money is required?\"    \"How many pagazis, or carriers?    \"How many soldiers?\"    \"How much cloth?\"    \"How many beads?\"    \"How much wire?\"    \"What kinds of cloth are required for the different tribes?\"    Ever so many questions to myself brought me no clearer the exact point  I wished to arrive at. I scribbled over scores of sheets of paper, made  estimates, drew out lists of material, calculated the cost of keeping  one hundred men for one year, at so many yards of different kinds of  cloth, etc. I studied Burton, Speke, and Grant in vain. A good deal of  geographical, ethnological, and other information appertaining to the  study of Inner Africa was obtainable, but information respecting the  organization of an expedition requisite before proceeding to Africa, was  not in any book. The Europeans at Zanzibar knew as little as possible  about this particular point. There was not one white man at Zanzibar who  could tell how many dotis a day a force of one hundred men required to  buy food for one day on the road. Neither, indeed, was it their business  to know. But what should I do at all, at all? This was a grand question.    I decided it were best to hunt up an Arab merchant who had been engaged  in the ivory trade, or who was fresh from the interior.    Sheikh Hashid was a man of note and of wealth in Zanzibar. He had  himself despatched several caravans into the interior, and was  necessarily acquainted with several prominent traders who came to  his house to gossip about their adventures and gains. He was also the  proprietor of the large house Capt. Webb occupied; besides, he lived  across the narrow street which separated his house from the Consulate.  Of all men Sheikh Hashid was the man to be consulted, and he was  accordingly invited to visit me at the Consulate.    From the grey-bearded and venerable-looking Sheikh, I elicited more  information about African currency, the mode of procedure, the quantity  and quality of stuffs I required, than I had obtained from three months'  study of books upon Central Africa; and from other Arab merchants  to whom the ancient Sheikh introduced me, I received most valuable  suggestions and hints, which enabled me at last to organize an  Expedition.    The reader must bear in mind that a traveller requires only that which  is sufficient for travel and exploration that a superfluity of goods or  means will prove as fatal to him as poverty of supplies. It is on  this question of quality and quantity that the traveller has first to  exercise his judgment and discretion.    My informants gave me to understand that for one hundred men, 10 doti,  or 40 yards of cloth per diem, would suffice for food. The proper course  to pursue, I found, was to purchase 2,000 doti of American sheeting,  1,000 doti of Kaniki, and 650 doti of the coloured cloths, such as  Barsati, a great favourite in Unyamwezi; Sohari, taken in Ugogo;  Ismahili, Taujiri, Joho, Shash, Rehani, Jamdani or Kunguru-Cutch, blue  and pink. These were deemed amply sufficient for the subsistence of  one hundred men for twelve months. Two years at this rate would require  4,000 doti = 16,000 yards of American sheeting; 2,000 doti = 8,000 yards  of Kaniki; 1,300 doti = 5,200 yards of mixed coloured cloths. This was  definite and valuable information to me, and excepting the lack of some  suggestions as to the quality of the sheeting, Kaniki, and coloured  cloths, I had obtained all I desired upon this point.    Second in importance to the amount of cloth required was the quantity  and quality of the beads necessary. Beads, I was told, took the place  of cloth currency among some tribes of the interior. One tribe preferred  white to black beads, brown to yellow, red to green, green to white, and  so on. Thus, in Unyamwezi, red (sami-sami) beads would readily be taken,  where all other kinds would be refused; black (bubu) beads, though  currency in Ugogo, were positively worthless with all other tribes; the  egg (sungomazzi) beads, though valuable in Ujiji and Uguhha, would be  refused in all other countries; the white (Merikani) beads though  good in Ufipa, and some parts of Usagara and Ugogo, would certainly be  despised in Useguhha and Ukonongo. Such being the case, I was obliged to  study closely, and calculate the probable stay of an expedition in the  several countries, so as to be sure to provide a sufficiency of each  kind, and guard against any great overplus. Burton and Speke, for  instance, were obliged to throw away as worthless several hundred fundo  of beads.    For example, supposing the several nations of Europe had each its own  currency, without the means of exchange, and supposing a man was about  to travel through Europe on foot, before starting he would be apt to  calculate how many days it would take him to travel through France; how  many through Prussia, Austria, and Russia, then to reckon the expense  he would be likely to incur per day. If the expense be set down at a  napoleon per day, and his journey through France would occupy thirty  days, the sum required forgoing and returning might be properly set down  at sixty napoleons, in which case, napoleons not being current money  in Prussia, Austria, or Russia, it would be utterly useless for him  to burden himself with the weight of a couple of thousand napoleons in  gold.    My anxiety on this point was most excruciating. Over and over I studied  the hard names and measures, conned again and again the polysyllables;  hoping to be able to arrive some time at an intelligible definition  of the terms. I revolved in my mind the words Mukunguru, Ghulabio,  Sungomazzi, Kadunduguru, Mutunda, Samisami, Bubu, Merikani, Hafde,  Lunghio-Rega, and Lakhio, until I was fairly beside myself. Finally,  however, I came to the conclusion that if I reckoned my requirements at  fifty khete, or five fundo per day, for two years, and if I purchased  only eleven varieties, I might consider myself safe enough. The purchase  was accordingly made, and twenty-two sacks of the best species were  packed and brought to Capt. Webb's house, ready for transportation to  Bagamoyo.    After the beads came the wire question. I discovered, after considerable  trouble, that Nos. 5 and 6--almost of the thickness of telegraph  wire--were considered the best numbers for trading purposes. While beads  stand for copper coins in Africa, cloth measures for silver; wire  is reckoned as gold in the countries beyond the Tan-ga-ni-ka.* Ten  frasilah, or 350 lbs., of brass-wire, my Arab adviser thought, would be  ample.           * It will be seen that I differ from Capt. Burton in the       spelling of this word, as I deem the letter \"y\" superfluous.      Having purchased the cloth, the beads, and the wire, it was with no  little pride that I surveyed the comely bales and packages lying piled  up, row above row, in Capt. Webb's capacious store-room. Yet my work  was not ended, it was but beginning; there were provisions,  cooking-utensils, boats, rope, twine, tents, donkeys, saddles, bagging,  canvas, tar, needles, tools, ammunition, guns, equipments, hatchets,  medicines, bedding, presents for chiefs--in short, a thousand things not  yet purchased. The ordeal of chaffering and haggling with steel-hearted  Banyans, Hindis, Arabs, and half-castes was most trying. For instance, I  purchased twenty-two donkeys at Zanzibar. $40 and $50 were asked, which  I had to reduce to $15 or $20 by an infinite amount of argument worthy,  I think, of a nobler cause. As was my experience with the ass-dealers so  was it with the petty merchants; even a paper of pins was not purchased  without a five per cent. reduction from the price demanded, involving,  of course, a loss of much time and patience.    After collecting the donkeys, I discovered there were no pack-saddles  to be obtained in Zanzibar. Donkeys without pack-saddles were of no use  whatever. I"]]]
