The first volume closed with the narration of these  circumstances of discouragement which befell the Saints in their  efforts to establish Zion in Missouri.    _Summary of Volume Two_.    In this second volume is recorded the arrival of a delegation from  the exiled Saints in Missouri, seeking advice and the word of the  Lord from the Prophet; the organizations of Zion's Camp for the  deliverance {XXII} of Zion; its march from Kirtland to Missouri; its  rich educational experiences; its disbandment and the return of many of  the brethren to Ohio; the establishment of a school for the Elders at  Kirtland, the first educational movement in the Church; the discovery  of the Book of Abraham; the organization of the first, or Kirtland High  Council; the organization of the quorums of the foreign ministry; the  Twelve and the Seventy; the publication of the Doctrine and Covenants;  the completion and dedication of the Kirtland Temple; the purification  and spiritual endowment of the Elders of the Church; the appearance of  Messiah in the Temple declaring His acceptance of it; the appearance of  Moses, Elias and Elijah, on the same occasion, delivering the keys of  their respective dispensations to the Prophet of the Dispensation of  the Fullness of Times; the commencement of the ministry of the Twelve  among the branches of the Church in the eastern States of the American  Union; the misunderstandings that arose between them and the Presidency  of the Church; the revelations of God which came in consequence of  their misunderstandings, more clearly defining the rights, powers, and  relations of the respective quorums of the Priesthood; the peaceful  exodus of the Saints from Clay county, Missouri, and the founding of  Far West; the opening of the first foreign mission by sending two of  the Twelve and several Elders to England; the attempt to mass the  several industrial pursuits and temporal interests of the Saints  under one general concern, the \"Kirtland Safety Society Company;\" the  failure of that concern in the general financial maelstrom that swept  over the country in 1837, hastened also--sad to relate--by the unwise  management and dishonesty of some of the incorporators and directors;  the manifestation of excessive pride and worldliness on the part of  some of the Saints at Kirtland; the disaffection of many hitherto  leading Elders of the Church against the Prophet Joseph; the extensive  apostasy of many Elders and Saints in Kirtland; with the account of  which calamitous events this volume closes.    _The Expedition of Zion's Camp_.    The time covered by this volume may properly be called the Kirtland  period of the Church History, since that city is the chief center of  activity. The four years which comprise the period are marked, on  the one hand, by rapid doctrinal development, institutional growth,  outward enlargement and internal spiritual progress; and, on the other  hand, are marked by internal dissensions, abundant manifestations of  human weakness and wickedness, resulting in bitterness and apostasy.  The period is one in which the Church is manifestly militant, and not  always, from surface appearances, triumphant. Yet removed from {XXIII}  that period by well nigh three-quarters of a century, one may see now  that it was a glorious period, notwithstanding sombre shadows are now  and then cast athwart the pathway of the Church's progress. Who can  rightly estimate the value of the experiences of that movement for  the redemption of Zion, called Zion's Camp? Nothing so completely  reveals the worth or worthlessness of human character as expeditions  of this description. Men are thrown into such relations with each  other that all that is in them, good or bad, comes to the surface.  As opportunities in time of war reveal noble or debased natures, so  in expeditions such as Zion's Camp the base or exalted phases of  human nature are forced to the surface, and are known and read of  men. God, it appears was about to choose His foreign ministry, His  Especial Witnesses to the world, the Twelve and the Seventy. After  the expedition of Zion's Camp He could choose them from among men  who had offered their all in sacrifice--even to life itself--for the  work's sake. Are not such manifestly fitter witnesses than those who  are untried? Will it be argued that to the All-knowing the untried are  as well know as the tried, and that God needed no such demonstration  of fidelity as was afforded by the expedition of Zion's Camp in order  to guide Him in the choice of His Witnesses to the nations of the  earth? If so, my answer would be an acquiescence--God needs no such  expedition in order to reveal to Him the worthiness of those who shall  be His special Witnesses. But what of the world--what of men? Do not  they need some such evidence back of those who shall testify of a new  dispensation of the Gospel? Will not men have more regard for the  testimony of Witnesses who have offered their all in sacrifice for  any given work, than for the testimony of witnesses who have made no  such sacrifice? Undoubtedly. Not for God's guidance, then, but for the  qualification of the Witnesses in the eyes of men was the expedition of  Zion's Camp in part conceived and executed. Also that those men who,  under God--the Prophet Joseph Smith and the Three Witnesses to the Book  of Mormon--were to make choice of especial Witnesses might know whom to  select because of actually demonstrated fitness and worthiness.    Moreover there were men in that expedition who later will be called  upon to conduct larger expeditions much of the same character--an  exodus of thousands from Missouri; an exodus of tens of thousands from  the confines of the United States, a thousand miles into the wilderness  of the Rocky Mountains. May not the Lord have designed in part this  expedition of Zion's Camp for their instruction, for their training?  The leaders of these later movements are all there--Brigham Young,  Heber C. Kimball, Orson Pratt, Parley P. Pratt, Charles C. Rich, George  A. Smith, Wilford Woodruff and many more. It is significant, too,  that Brigham Young at least sensed the true importance {XXIV} of the  Zion's Camp expedition. That expedition for the redemption of Zion was  regarded by many weak-faithed Saints as a sad failure, a humiliation  of a presumptuous prophet. One of these attempted to ridicule it in  the presence of Brigham Young, as a case of marching men up a hill to  march them down again. \"Well,\" said the scoffer, \"what did you gain on  this useless journey to Missouri with Joseph Smith?\" \"All we went for,\"  promptly replied Brigham Young. \"I would not exchange the _experience_  gained in that expedition for all the wealth of Geauga county.\" A  remark which proves that Brigham Young had a keen insight into the  purpose of the Zion's Camp movement.    _First Educational Movement of the Church_.    The value of the educational movement in the Church by the  establishment of a school for the Elders in Kirtland, cannot be  fully appreciated even yet. It stands as a direct contradiction to  the oft-repeated charges that Mormonism seeks to thrive through the  ignorance of its devotees. \"Seek ye diligently, and teach one another  words of wisdom,\" was an admonition the Church in the Kirtland period  of its history sought earnestly to carry into effect. \"Yea, seek ye  out of the best books words of wisdom: seek learning even by study,  and also by faith.\" To the sphere of their learning there were no  limitations set. \"Teach ye diligently,\" said the Lord, \"and my grace  shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory,  in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the Gospel, in all things  that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to  understand; of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under  the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which  must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which  are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the  judgments which are on the land, and a knowledge also of countries  and of kingdoms.\" I know of nothing that lies outside this boundless  field of research into which the Elders of the church especially  were invited--nay, commanded, to enter. It comprehends the whole  possible sphere of human investigation; and furnishes all necessary  contradiction to the theory that the Church at any time contemplated an  ignorant ministry. By intelligence, not stupidity; by knowledge, not  ignorance, has the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4723"],[0,"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (#4)"],[1,"and controversies, and what a learned dust have been raised about those  matters, and what mighty advantage has been from thence derived to  mankind, are things at this day too clearly known to need being insisted  on. And it had been well if the ill effects of that doctrine were  confined to those only who make the most avowed profession of it. When  men consider the great pains, industry, and parts that have for so many  ages been laid out on the cultivation and advancement of the sciences,  and that notwithstanding all this the far greater part of them remains  full of darkness and uncertainty, and disputes that are like never to  have an end, and even those that are thought to be supported by the most  clear and cogent demonstrations contain in them paradoxes which are  perfectly irreconcilable to the understandings of men, and that, taking  all together, a very small portion of them does supply any real benefit  to mankind, otherwise than by being an innocent diversion and  amusement--I say the consideration of all this is apt to throw them into  a despondency and perfect contempt of all study. But this may perhaps  cease upon a view of the false principles that have obtained in the  world, amongst all which there is none, methinks, has a more wide and  extended sway over the thoughts of speculative men than [Note.] this of  abstract general ideas.    [Note: \"That we have been endeavouring to overthrow.\"--Edit 1710.]    18. I come now to consider the SOURCE OF THIS PREVAILING NOTION, and that  seems to me to be LANGUAGE. And surely nothing of less extent than reason  itself could have been the source of an opinion so universally received.  The truth of this appears as from other reasons so also from the plain  confession of the ablest patrons of abstract ideas, who acknowledge that  they are made in order to naming; from which it is a clear consequence  that if there had been no such things as speech or universal signs there  never had been any thought of abstraction. See III. vi. 39, and elsewhere  of the Essay on Human Understanding. Let us examine the manner wherein  words have contributed to the origin of that mistake.--First  [Vide sect. xix.] then, it is thought that every name has, or  ought to have, ONE ONLY precise and settled signification, which  inclines men to think there are certain ABSTRACT, DETERMINATE IDEAS  that constitute the true and only immediate signification of each  general name; and that it is by the mediation of these abstract  ideas that a general name comes to signify any particular thing.  Whereas, in truth, there is no such thing as one precise and definite  signification annexed to any general name, they all signifying  indifferently a great number of particular ideas. All which doth  evidently follow from what has been already said, and will clearly appear  to anyone by a little reflexion. To this it will be OBJECTED that every  name that has a definition is thereby restrained to one certain  signification. For example, a TRIANGLE is defined to be A PLAIN SURFACE  COMPREHENDED BY THREE RIGHT LINES, by which that name is limited to  denote one certain idea and no other. To which I answer, that in the  definition it is not said whether the surface be great or small, black or  white, nor whether the sides are long or short, equal or unequal, nor  with what angles they are inclined to each other; in all which there may  be great variety, and consequently there is NO ONE SETTLED IDEA which  limits the signification of the word TRIANGLE. It is one thing for to  keep a name constantly to the same definition, and another to make it  stand everywhere for the same idea; the one is necessary, the other  useless and impracticable.    19. SECONDLY, But, to give a farther account how WORDS came to PRODUCE THE  DOCTRINE OF ABSTRACT IDEAS, it must be observed that it is a received  opinion that language has NO OTHER END but the communicating our ideas,  and that every significant name stands for an idea. This being so, and it  being withal certain that names which yet are not thought altogether  insignificant do not always mark out PARTICULAR conceivable ideas, it is  straightway concluded that THEY STAND FOR ABSTRACT NOTIONS. That there are  many names in use amongst speculative men which do not always suggest to  others determinate, particular ideas, or in truth anything at all, is what  nobody will deny. And a little attention will discover that it is not  necessary (even in the strictest reasonings) significant names which  stand for ideas should, every time they are used, excite in the  understanding the ideas they are made to stand for--in reading and  discoursing, names being for the most part used as letters are in  ALGEBRA, in which, though a particular quantity be marked by each letter,  yet to proceed right it is not requisite that in every step each letter  suggest to your thoughts that particular quantity it was appointed to  stand for.[Note.]    [Note: Language has become the source or origin of abstract general ideas  on account of a twofold error.--(1.) That every word has only one  signification. (2.) That the only end of language is the communication  of our ideas--Ed.]    20. SOME OF THE ENDS OF LANGUAGE.--Besides, the communicating of ideas  marked by words is not the chief and only end of language, as is  commonly supposed. There are other ends, as the raising of some  passion, the exciting to or deterring from an action, the putting  the mind in some particular disposition--to which the former is  in many cases barely subservient, and sometimes entirely omitted,  when these can be obtained without it, as I think does not unfrequently  happen in the familiar use of language. I entreat the reader to  reflect with himself, and see if it doth not often happen, either in  hearing or reading a discourse, that the passions of fear, love, hatred,  admiration, disdain, and the like, arise immediately in his mind upon the  perception of certain words, without any ideas coming between. At first,  indeed, the words might have occasioned ideas that were fitting to  produce those emotions; but, if I mistake not, it will be found that,  when language is once grown familiar, the hearing of the sounds or sight  of the characters is oft immediately attended with those passions which  at first were wont to be produced by the intervention of ideas that are  now quite omitted. May we not, for example, be affected with the promise  of a GOOD THING, though we have not an idea of what it is? Or is not the  being threatened with danger sufficient to excite a dread, though we  think not of any particular evil likely to befal us, nor yet frame to  ourselves an idea of danger in abstract? If any one shall join ever so  little reflexion of his own to what has been said, I believe that it will  evidently appear to him that general names are often used in the  propriety of language without the speaker's designing them for marks of  ideas in his own, which he would have them raise in the mind of the  hearer. Even proper names themselves do not seem always spoken with a  design to bring into our view the ideas of those individuals that are  supposed to be marked by them. For example, when a schoolman tells me  \"Aristotle has said it,\" all I conceive he means by it is to dispose me  to embrace his opinion with the deference and submission which custom has  annexed to that name. And this effect is often so instantly produced in  the minds of those who are accustomed to resign their judgment to  authority of that philosopher, as it is impossible any idea either of his  person, writings, or reputation should go before [Note.]. Innumerable  examples of this kind may be given, but why should I insist on those  things which every one's experience will, I doubt not, plentifully  suggest unto him?    [Note: \"So close and immediate a connection may custom establish betwixt  the very word ARISTOTLE, and the motions of assent and reverence  in the minds of some men.\"--Edit 1710.]    21. CAUTION IN THE USE OF LANGUAGE NECESSARY.--We have, I think,  shown the impossibility of ABSTRACT IDEAS. We have considered  what has been said for them by their ablest patrons; and endeavored  to show they are of no use for those ends to which they are thought  necessary. And lastly, we have traced them to the source from  whence they flow, which appears evidently to be language.--It cannot be  denied that words are of excellent use, in that by their means all that  stock of knowledge which has been purchased by the joint labours of  inquisitive men in all ages and nations may be drawn into the view and  made the possession of one single person. But at the same time it must be  owned that most parts of knowledge have been strangely perplexed and  darkened by the abuse of words, and general ways of speech wherein they  are delivered.[Note 1.] Since therefore words are so apt to impose on the  understanding[Note 2.], whatever ideas I consider, I shall endeavour to  take them bare and naked into my view, keeping out of my thoughts so far  as I am able, those names which long and constant use has so strictly  united with them; from which I may expect to derive the following  advantages:    [Note 1: \"That it may almost be made a question, whether language  has contributed more to the hindrance or advancement of the  sciences.\"--Edit 1710.]    [Note 2: \"I am resolved in my inquiries to make as little use of them  as possibly I can.\"--Edit 1710.]    22. FIRST, I shall be sure to get clear of all controversies PURELY  VERBAL--the springing up of which weeds in almost all the sciences has  been a main hindrance to the growth of true and sound knowledge.  SECONDLY, this seems to be a sure way to extricate myself out of that  fine and subtle net of ABSTRACT IDEAS which has so miserably perplexed  and entangled the minds of men; and that with this peculiar circumstance,  that by how much the finer and more curious was the wit of any "]]]
