[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6322"],[0,"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the (#4)"],[1,"  LATITUDE.    I have endeavoured to collect in one point of view the whole of the  physical phenomena of that part of the New Continent comprised  within the limits of the torrid zone from the level of the Pacific  to the highest summit of the Andes; namely, the vegetation, the  animals, the geological relations, the cultivation of the soil, the  temperature of the air, the limit of perpetual snow, the chemical  constitution of the atmosphere, its electrical intensity, its  barometrical pressure, the decrement of gravitation, the intensity  of the azure colour of the sky, the diminution of light during its  passage through the successive strata of the air, the horizontal  refractions, and the heat of boiling water at different heights.  Fourteen scales, disposed side by side with a profile of the Andes,  indicate the modifications to which these phenomena are subject  from the influence of the elevation of the soil above the level of  the sea. Each group of plants is placed at the height which nature  has assigned to it, and we may follow the prodigious variety of  their forms from the region of the palms and arborescent ferns to  those of the johannesia (chuquiraga, Juss.), the gramineous plants,  and lichens. These regions form the natural divisions of the  vegetable empire; and as perpetual snow is found in each climate at  a determinate height, so, in like manner, the febrifuge species of  the quinquina (cinchona) have their fixed limits, which I have  marked in the botanical chart belonging to this essay.    1.I.5. OBSERVATIONS ON ZOOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE ANATOMY.    I have comprised in this work the history of the condor;  experiments on the electrical action of the gymnotus; a treatise on  the larynx of the crocodiles, the quadrumani, and birds of the  tropics; the description of several new species of reptiles,  fishes, birds, monkeys, and other mammalia but little known. M.  Cuvier has enriched this work with a very comprehensive treatise on  the axolotl of the lake of Mexico, and on the genera of the Protei.  That naturalist has also recognized two new species of mastodons  and an elephant among the fossil bones of quadrupeds which we  brought from North and South America. For the description of the  insects collected by M. Bonpland we are indebted to M. Latreille,  whose labours have so much contributed to the progress of  entomology in our times. The second volume of this work contains  figures of the Mexican, Peruvian, and Aturian skulls, which we have  deposited in the Museum of Natural History at Paris, and respecting  which Blumenbach has published observations in the 'Decas quinta  Craniorum diversarum gentium.'    1.I.6. POLITICAL ESSAY ON THE KINGDOM OF NEW SPAIN, WITH A PHYSICAL    AND GEOGRAPHICAL ATLAS, FOUNDED ON ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS AND    TRIGONOMETRICAL AND BAROMETRICAL MEASUREMENTS.    This work, based on numerous official memoirs, presents, in six  divisions, considerations on the extent and natural appearance of  Mexico, on the population, on the manners of the inhabitants, their  ancient civilization, and the political division of their  territory. It embraces also the agriculture, the mineral riches,  the manufactures, the commerce, the finances, and the military  defence of that vast country. In treating these different subjects  I have endeavoured to consider them under a general point of view;  I have drawn a parallel not only between New Spain, the other  Spanish colonies, and the United States of North America, but also  between New Spain and the possessions of the English in Asia; I  have compared the agriculture of the countries situated in the  torrid zone with that of the temperate climates; and I have  examined the quantity of colonial produce necessary to Europe in  the present state of civilization. In tracing the geological  description of the richest mining districts in Mexico, I have, in  short, given a statement of the mineral produce, the population,  the imports and exports of the whole of Spanish America. I have  examined several questions which, for want of precise data, had not  hitherto been treated with the attention they demand, such as the  influx and reflux of metals, their progressive accumulation in  Europe and Asia, and the quantity of gold and silver which, since  the discovery of America down to our own times, the Old World has  received from the New. The geographical introduction at the  beginning of this work contains the analysis of the materials which  have been employed in the construction of the Mexican Atlas.    1.I.7. VIEWS OF THE CORDILLERAS, AND MONUMENTS OF THE INDIGENOUS    NATIONS OF THE NEW CONTINENT.* (*Atlas Pittoresque, ou Vues des    Cordilleres, 1 volume folio, with 69 plates, part of which are    coloured, accompanied by explanatory treatises. This work may be    considered as the Atlas to the historical narrative of the travels.)    This work is intended to represent a few of the grand scenes which  nature presents in the lofty chain of the Andes, and at the same  time to throw some light on the ancient civilization of the  Americans, through the study of their monuments of architecture,  their hieroglyphics, their religious rites, and their astrological  reveries. I have given in this work a description of the teocalli,  or Mexican pyramids, and have compared their structure with that of  the temple of Belus. I have described the arabesques which cover  the ruins of Mitla, the idols in basalt ornamented with the  calantica of the heads of Isis; and also a considerable number of  symbolical paintings, representing the serpent-woman (the Mexican  Eve), the deluge of Coxcox, and the first migrations of the natives  of the Aztec race. I have endeavoured to prove the striking  analogies existing between the calendar of the Toltecs and the  catasterisms of their zodiac, and the division of time of the  people of Tartary and Thibet, as well as the Mexican traditions on  the four regenerations of the globe, the pralayas of the Hindoos,  and the four ages of Hesiod. In this work I have also included (in  addition to the hieroglyphical paintings I brought to Europe),  fragments of all the Aztec manuscripts, collected in Rome, Veletri,  Vienna, and Dresden, and one of which reminds us, by its lineary  symbols, of the kouas of the Chinese. Together with the rude  monuments of the aborigines of America, this volume contains  picturesque views of the mountainous countries which those people  inhabited; for example, the cataract of Tequendama, Chimborazo, the  volcano of Jorullo and Cayambe, the pyramidal summit of which,  covered with eternal ice, is situated directly under the  equinoctial line. In every zone the configuration of the ground,  the physiognomy of the plants, and the aspect of lovely or wild  scenery, have great influence on the progress of the arts, and on  the style which distinguishes their productions. This influence is  so much the more perceptible in proportion as man is farther  removed from civilization.    I could have added to this work researches on the character of  languages, which are the most durable monuments of nations. I have  collected a number of materials on the languages of America, of  which MM. Frederic Schlegel and Vater have made use; the former in  his Considerations on the Hindoos, the latter in his Continuation  of the Mithridates of Adelung, in the Ethnographical Magazine, and  in his Inquiries into the Population of the New Continent. These  materials are now in the hands of my brother, William von Humboldt,  who, during his travels in Spain, and a long abode at Rome, formed  the richest collection of American vocabularies in existence. His  extensive knowledge of the ancient and modern languages has enabled  him to trace some curious analogies in relation to this subject, so  important to the philosophical study of the history of man. A part  of his labours will find a place in this narrative.    Of the different works which I have here enumerated, the second and  third were composed by M. Bonpland, from the observations which he  made in a botanical journal. This journal contains more than four  thousand methodical descriptions of equinoctial plants, a ninth  part only of which have been made by me. They appear in a separate  publication, under the title of Nova Genera et Species Plantariem.  In this work will be found, not only the new species we collected,  which, after a careful examination by one of the first botanists of  the age, Professor Willdenouw, are computed to amount to fourteen  or fifteen hundred, but also the interesting observations made by  M. Bonpland on plants hitherto imperfectly described. The plates of  this work are all engraved according to the method followed by M.  Labillardiere, in the Specimen Planterum Novae Hollandiae, a work  remarkable for profound research and clearness of arrangement.    After having distributed into separate works all that belongs to  astronomy, botany, zoology, the political description of New Spain,  and the history of the ancient civilization of certain nations of  the New Continent, there still remained many general results and  local descriptions, which I might have collected into separate  treatises. I had, during my journey, prepared papers on the races  of men in South America; on the Missions of the Orinoco; on the  obstacles to the progress of society in the torrid zone arising  from the climate and the strength of vegetation; on the character  of the landscape in the Cordilleras of the Andes compared with that  of the Alps in Switzerland; on the analogies between the rocks of  the two hemispheres; on the physical constitution of the air in the  equinoctial regions, etc. I had left Europe with the firm intention  of not writing what is usually called the historical narrative of a  journey, but to publish the fruit of my inquiries in works merely  descriptive; and I had arranged the facts, not in the order in  which they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6329"],[0,"Catalogue of British Columbia Birds (#4)"],[1,"semipalmata_ (Bonap.).
