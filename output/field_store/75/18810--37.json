Following their example, my friend Tristan and I spent  the livelong day in the old house of the Abbatiale at the corner of  the hearth, smoking our pipes and reading poetry. At sundown we had  grown tired of seclusion and determined to venture out.    \"The forest must be a strange sight with this heavy frost,\" said I  to Tristan. \"Suppose we take a turn through the wood after supper;  besides, I must see the sabotiers from Courroy about a little matter.\"    So we pulled on our gaiters, stuffed our pipes, wrapped ourselves in  our cloaks and mufflers, and penetrated into the wood.    We walked along cheerfully over the rugged, hardened soil of the  trenches furrowed with deep, frozen ruts. Through the copse on either  side we saw mysterious white depths. After a damp night the north  wind had transformed the mists and vapors that overhung the branches  into a tangle of snowy lace. In the half light of the gloaming we  could still distinguish the sparkling needles of the junipers, the  frosted puffs of the clematis, the bluish crystallizations of the  beech, and the silver filigree of the nut-trees. The silence was  broken by the occasional creaking of the frozen limbs, and every now  and then a breath of impalpable white dust dampened our cheeks as it  melted there.    We walked along at a steady pace, and in less than an hour caught  sight of the red and flickering glow of the sabotiers' camp pitched  on the edge of the forest above a stream that flowed down toward  the valley of Santonge. The settlement consisted of a spacious,  cone-shaped, dirt-coated hut and a cabin with board walls carefully  sealed with moss. The hut answered the combined purposes of  dormitory and kitchen; the cabin was used for the stowing away of  tools and wooden shoes, and also for the two donkeys employed in  the transportation of goods. The sabotiers, masters, apprentices,  friends, and children were seated on beech logs around the fire in  front of the hut, and their mobile silhouettes formed intensely black  profiles against the red of the fire. Three short posts driven into  the ground and drawn together at the top formed the crane, from which  hung an iron pot that simmered over the coals. An appetizing odor  of stewed hare escaped from the tin lid as it rose and fell under  the puffs of vapor. The master, a lively, nervous, hairy little man,  welcomed us with his usual cordiality.    \"Sit down and warm yourselves,\" said he. \"You find us preparing the  Christmas supper. I'm afraid we'll not sleep over soundly to-night.  My old woman is ill. I've fixed her a bed in the cabin where she'll  be more comfortable, and warmer on account of the animals. My boy has  gone to Santonge to get the doctor. There's no time to be lost. My  little girl is kept busy running from the cabin to the hut.\"    We had no sooner taken our seats around the fire than the snowflakes  began to whirl about in the stillness above us. They fell so thick  and fast that in less than a quarter of an hour we were compelled to  protect the fire with a hurdle covered with sackcloth.    \"By my faith! gentlemen,\" said the sabotier, \"you'll not be able to  start out again in this storm. You'll have to stay and have your  Christmas supper with us,--and taste of our stew.\"    The weather was certainly not tempting, and we accepted the  invitation. Besides, the adventure amused us, and we were delighted  at the prospect of a Christmas supper in the heart of the forest. An  hour later we were in the hut, and by the light of a miserable little  candle-end we had our Christmas supper, devouring our hare-stew with  a sharp appetite and washing it down with a draught of unfermented  wine that scraped our throats. The snow fell thicker and thicker,  wrapping the forest in a soft white wadding that deadened every  sound. Now and then the sabotier rose and went into the cabin, then  came back looking worried, listening anxiously for the good woman  from Santonge. Suddenly a few metallic notes, muffled by the snow,  rose softly from the depth of the valley. A similar sound from an  opposite direction rang out in answer, then followed a third and a  fourth, and soon a vague confusion of Christmas chimes floated over  the forest.    Our hosts, without interrupting the process of mastication and while  they passed around the wine-jug, tried to recognize the various  chimes by the fulness of the sounds.    \"Those--now--those are the bells from Vivey. They are hardly any  louder than the sound of the donkey's hoofs on the stones.\"    \"That is the bell of Auberive!\"    \"Yes; and that peal that sounds like the droning of a swarm of  beetles, that's the Grancey chimes.\"    During this discussion Tristan and I began to succumb to the combined  action of warmth and fully satisfied appetite. Our eyes blinked, and  before we knew it we fell asleep on the moss of the hut, lulled by  the music of the Christmas chimes. A piercing shriek followed by a  sound of joyful voices woke us with a start.    It had ceased snowing. The night was growing pale, and through the  little skylight we could see above the fleecy trees a faint light in  the sky, where a belated star hung quivering.    \"It is a boy!\" shouted the master, bursting in upon us. \"Gentlemen,  if you think you would like to see him, why, I should be very glad;  and it might bring him luck.\"    We went crunching over the snow after him to the cabin, lighted by a  smoky lamp. On her bed of laths and moss lay the young mother, weak  and exhausted, her head thrown back, her pale face framed in by a  mass of frowzy auburn hair. The \"good woman,\" assisted by the little  girl, was bundling up the new-comer, who wailed feebly. The two  donkeys, amazed at so much stir and confusion, turned their kindly  gray faces toward the bed, shook their long ears, and gazed around  them with wide, intelligent eyes, blowing through their nostrils  puffs of warm vapor that hung like a thin mist on the air. At the  foot of the bed stood a young shepherd, with a black and white  she-goat and a new-born kid.    \"I have brought you the she-goat, Ma'am Fleuriot,\" said he, in his  Langrois drawl. \"You can have her for the boy as long as you wish.\"    The goat was baaing, the new-born child wailed, and the donkeys  breathed loudly. There was something primitive and biblical about the  whole scene.    Without, in the violet light of the dawn, while a distant church-bell  scattered its early notes through the air, one of the young  apprentices, dancing in the snow to keep warm, sang out at the top  of his lungs that old Christmas carol, which seemed then full of new  meaning and poetry,--        \"He is born, the little Child.        Ring out, hautbois! ring out, bagpipes!      He is born, the little Child;        Let us sing the happy news.\"    [Illustration]          THE LOUIS-D'OR.    From the French of FRANÇOIS COPPÉE.      When Lucien de Hem saw his last bill for a hundred francs clawed  by the banker's rake, when he rose from the roulette-table where  he had just lost the débris of his little fortune scraped together  for this supreme battle, he experienced something like vertigo, and  thought that he should fall. His brain was muddled; his legs were  limp and trembling. He threw himself upon the leather lounge that  circumscribed the gambling-table. For a few moments he mechanically  followed the clandestine proceedings of that hell in which he had  sullied the best years of his youth, recognized the worn profiles of  the gamblers under the merciless glare of the three great shadeless  lamps, listened to the clicking and the sliding of the gold over the  felt, realized that he was bankrupt, lost, remembered that in the  top drawer of his dressing-table lay a pair of pistols,--the very  pistols of which General de Hem, his father, had made noble use at  the attack of Zaatcha; then, overcome by exhaustion, he sank into a  heavy sleep.    When he awoke his mouth was clammy, and his tongue stuck to his  palate. He realized by a hasty glance at the clock that he had  scarcely slept a half-hour, and he felt the imperious necessity of  going out to get a breath of the fresh night air. The hands on the  dial pointed exactly to a quarter of twelve. As he rose and stretched  his arms it occurred to him that it was Christmas Eve, and by one of  those ironical freaks of the memory, he felt as though he were once  more a child, ready to stand his little boot on the hearth before  going to bed. Just then old Dronski, one of the pillars of the trade,  the traditional Pole, wrapped in the greasy worn cloak adorned with  frogs and passementerie, came up to Lucien muttering something behind  his dirty grayish beard.    \"Lend me five francs, will you, Monsieur? I haven't stirred from this  place for two days, and for two whole days seventeen hasn't come out  once. You may laugh at me all you like, but I'll bet you my fist that  when the clock strikes twelve, seventeen will be the winning number.\"    Lucien de Hem shrugged his shoulders; and fumbling through his  pockets, he found that he had not even money enough to comply with  that feature of gambling etiquette known among the frequenters of  the establishment as \"the Pole's hundred cents.\" He passed into the  antechamber, put on his hat and cloak, and disappeared down the  narrow stairway with the agility of people who have a fever. During  the four hours which Lucien had spent in the den it had snowed  heavily, and the street, one of those narrow wedges between two rows  of high buildings in the very heart of Paris, was intensely white.  Above, in the calm blue black of the sky, cold stars glittered. The  exhausted gambler shivered under his furs, and hurried along with a  blank despair in his heart, thinking of the pistols"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47338"],[0,"Kate Vernon: A Tale. Vol. 1 (of 3) (#4)"],[1,"horrid locality, the weather was \"dimmed dimp and disagreeable,\"  as Mantilini says, and not more than three or four cabs on the first  stands I passed; none of these sported the magic figures; while the  innumerable ones which were in motion, seemed by some perverse and  unaccustomed freak to drive with such unprecedented rapidity, that  though keen of sight, I could not distinguish their numbers. After  perambulating the town in all its intricacies, visiting every cab stand  extant, within its compass, standing numerous charges from the vehicles  themselves, and a terrific amount of slang, with the steadiness of the  42nd at Waterloo, I found myself towards five o'clock much in the same  position as at starting. What! if my beautiful unknown should really  have vanished from my sight for ever; and No. 756, a modernised edition  of Cinderella's magic coach, be disenchanted into its original form  of a vegetable marrow, the nearest approach, I believe, we have to a  pumpkin! And Burton too!--he must be put down! Here a very dissipated  looking cab crawled slowly by, drawn by a groggy horse, his bones  showing in sharp angles through the oil cloth thrown over his back  with a mockery of care, and driven by a small man with a face like a  crumpled crab apple, and a hat in a galloping consumption. 755, \"Come,\"  I thought, \"that's within one of my number; 755 ought to know something  about 756.\" I elevated my cane. \"Here you are, sir,\" the door was  opened. \"Stop,\" said I, \"you look intelligent,\" for an immense amount  of knowingness twinkled or rather floated in his watery red eyes, \"and  will perhaps assist me in a search I am making. Can you tell me where  I shall find cab number 756? I have been looking on the cab stands all  day, and about the streets and cannot see it any where; every other  number almost have I seen, but 756 is invisible.\"    \"756,\" said Jehu reflectively, and gazing sharply at me, \"knows no such  number, no such cab; cos why, sir, 756 was done for four months ago,  and has he was unfort'nate, no one liked to take the cab--so its hoff  the stans!\"    Good Heavens! then was it a phantom conveyance? In deep disappointment  I stepped in, saying \"to the cavalry barracks.\" Instead of clapping  the door with the usual jerk, the crumpled driver stood there, his  face going through a perfect series of expressive wrinklings; at last,  with an effort and a knock of his forefinger against the brim of his  decaying hat, \"P'raps you're a hofficer, a sojer officer, sir?\"    \"Yes,\" said I, rather surprised, \"my regiment is quartered here.\"    \"Ho! very good, sir! I thought as you were a detective hofficer, sir;  no offence, sir?\"    \"Certainly not,\" said I, highly flattered at the mistake, \"but why?\"    \"Cos, sir, you wanted so hard to get 756? I thinks he 'as summat  against him, only you asked questions too straight forrard like; I know  nothink about 756, we don't know much of each other, 'less we're on the  same stan'; only of course, if you was a detective, I wouldn't peach.\"    \"I assure you,\" said I, \"I only wanted some information from 756, for  which I would have rewarded him, and if you will help me--\"    \"I know, sir! Why you see if you've been a looking for him all day and  asked on all the stans--\"    \"I did,\" said I.    \"And could hear nothink, he'll not be on the drive, a good many numbers  b'long to the 'otels, sir.\"    A glorious idea by Jove! of course they were at an Hotel! \"You shall  drive me round to them all,\" said I, \"till we find him.\"    \"And if that won't do,\" said my inimitable mentor, \"You can summons  him, the police will soon get him.\"    He slammed the door with a triumphant wink that beggars description,  and off we went at a wonderful pace.    Many were the hostelries we visited, but in vain, Red, Blue, and White  Lions, Hen and Chickens, Boars, Bears, Bulls, and even Nag's Heads; the  entire animal creation, ignored the existence of \"756.\"    \"Least ways, sir,\" said my invaluable assistant, between whom and  myself, a great degree of confidence had sprung up, as he prepared for  the fiftieth time to mount the box. \"Least ways, sir, we've done our  best; you've been to all the 'otels as is good enough to keep cabs  'cept two, the 'Cat and Garters,' that's a poor 'un, and the 'Hangel'  that's nearly as good as the 'Adelphi.'\"    \"To the Angel first then.\"    Arrived there, I went into the bar, and in the politest manner, asked  its presiding goddess, if \"756\" was enrolled amongst the cabs of  the establishment. \"Can't say, sir; here, 'Enry,\"--the waiter came  forward--\"756--sir! yes sir!\" said the man unmovedly, little imagining  the delight with which I heard his reply. I looked at my watch, seven  o'clock, \"let me have dinner in a private room,\" said I, and after  fully satisfying my most admirable Jehu, I returned to the charge  within.    \"This way, sir,\" said the waiter, with a waive of the hand--I followed.    \"Light a fire, it is very damp.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    In a few moments, a rosy cheeked chambermaid came in with a coal box  and et ceteras, for a fire. This was what I wanted,--I drew a chair  near, and after some observations on the weather, passed on to the  probable numbers putting up at the house for last night's ball. \"Lots  of pretty girls from the country,\" I concluded.    \"Yes, sir, we are still very full, though a good many left this  morning.\"    \"Indeed! I danced with a young lady last night, who was staying here,  but I cannot remember her name, I want very much to find it out,--do  you think if I were to describe her to you, you could tell me?\"    \"P'raps I might, sir; though often we don't know the names of the  people who stop here occasionally.\"    \"Well, this young lady was tall, and very fair, with brown hair, and a  very pleasant smile.\"    \"I scarcely think I know any particular young lady like that, sir;  there's Miss Jones, and Miss Mary Peters, and Miss Majoribanks, Squire  Majoribanks' daughter, all just like that, sir.\"    Confound it, my description would have suited three-fifths of the young  ladies of great Britain.    \"Yes, yes, but the lady I mean was with an old fattish man, black eyes,  and thick voice, and a little elderly woman, who--\"    \"Oh, I think I know, sir: she had a little brown mole on her cheek,  near the chin. A beautiful young lady!\"    \"Exactly,\" I exclaimed in delight.    \"They were only here two nights, and I don't know the name at all; they  were quite strangers.\"    How intensely annoying! \"But is there no one in the house has an idea?\"    \"Well, I can't say, sir; you see we have been so busy; if it is any one  it will be Bill, one of the cabmen, sir, he took them somewhere this  morning; and I think they come from A----, but I'm not sure.\"    Here she began to gather her sticks and coals, and the waiter entered  to lay the cloth.    \"Is Bill in?\" said I--\"If so, send him up without fail immediately  after dinner.\" \"He is out just now, sir.\" \"Well, the moment he comes  in, whether I have finished dinner or not.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said both in chorus, and excited.    I had dined, and was languidly examining the interior of a tart, when  the waiter entered again, announcing that \"Bill was there, if I wanted  him.\" \"Show him in, by all means:\" and Bill made his appearance, hat in  hand, and stroking down his hair.    \"Oh, good evening: your name is Bill, I understand, and I fancy you  can tell me something I want to find out:--You drove a party from this  hotel somewhere this morning, and I want to know their names: there  was a little old lady, and a tall young one, with a short fat man,  twinkling black eyes, eh! do you remember them?\"    \"Yes, I think I does,\" said Bill, slowly, as if confused by my rapid  description, \"fat short gen'lman, spoke thickish, I remember; called my  horse a rough sketch--not filled up.\"    \"Precisely; that's him, I am sure: what was the name?\"    \"Can't say, sir; I tuck 'em to the railway station: they was a-goin' to  A----.\"    \"How do you know?\" \"Why, as I was a-putting of the luggage into a truck  at the station, a porter turns one of 'em up, and says--this is for  A----, not Manchester: and puts it all into another truck; and then I  just see a name beginning with a W, and that was all, as I'd to come  back direct, for there's been a sight of work this week.\"    \"Then none of you can tell me the name of that gentleman?\"    \"No, sir, they was quite strangers.\"    \"Sorry to have troubled you; there--.\"    \"No trouble sir, thank you sir.\"    Well, thought I, this is small success; still, it is better than  nothing, and is a beginning. I'll keep up my courage, and take an early  train to A---- to-morrow; I have often heard it is worth seeing, so  first for my bill, and then for Burton.    The first was soon settled, and a short drive placed me in the  barracks, where, not a little wearied with the day's tramp, I speedily  luxuriated in dressing-gown and slippers, and detailed to Burton the  wonderful perseverance and sagacity with which I had hunted up the  track. \"At all events, old fellow, I've got the _locale_; the opening  is decidedly propitious, and to-morrow I start for A----; you shall  hear the result on my return; for, as I am on duty, I must, I suppose,  be back the same night. I can't ask you to take it again after to-day,  but Sedley, or some one will.\" \"Well,\" said Burton, \"you deserve  success, but what will you do when you get to A----? Go to every house  and describe your incognita?--or ask for a list of the inhabitants, and  hunt up every name that begins with W? Certainly the Commander-in-Chief  has a great deal to answer for in exposing H.M.'s officers to the  dangers of such a quarter, where the dearth of all natural occupations  and amusements drives them to Fouché-ism. I would offer to go with you,  but that I promised Sedley to go over to ----, just to have a look at  M's mare, for after all he has entered Diana for the Cup, and I rather  have a fancy to back "]]]
