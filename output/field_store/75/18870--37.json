Dick Cheeser was a plowboy:  long brown furrows over haughty, magnificent downs seemed to stretch  away into the future as far as his mind could see. No narrow outlook  either, for the life of nations depends upon those brown furrows. But  there are the bigger furrows that Mars makes, the long brown trenches  of war; the life of nations depends on these too; Dick Cheeser had  never pictured these. He had heard talk about a big navy and a lot of  Dreadnoughts; silly nonsense he called it. What did one want a big  navy for? To keep the Germans out, some people said. But the Germans  weren't coming. If they wanted to come, why didn't they come? Anybody  could see that they never did come. Some of Dick Cheeser's pals had  votes.    And so he had never pictured any change from plowing the great downs;  and here was war at last, and here was he. The Corporal showed him  where to stand, told him to keep a good lookout and left him.    And there was Dick Cheeser alone in the dark with an army in front of  him, eighty yards away: and, if all tales were true, a pretty horrible  army.    The night was awfully still. I use the adverb not as Dick Cheeser  would have used it. The stillness awed him. There had not been a shell  all night. He put his head up over the parapet and waited. Nobody  fired at him. He felt that the night was waiting for him. He heard  voices going along the trench: some one said it was a black night: the  voices died away. A mere phrase; the night wasn't black at all, it was  grey. Dick Cheeser was staring at it, and the night was staring back  at him, and seemed to be threatening him; it was grey, grey as an old  cat that they used to have at home, and as artful. Yes, thought Dick  Cheeser, it was an artful night; that was what was wrong with it. If  shells had come or the Germans, or anything at all, you would know how  to take it; but that quiet mist over huge valleys, and stillness!  Anything might happen. Dick waited and waited, and the night waited  too. He felt they were watching each other, the night and he. He felt  that each was crouching. His mind slipped back to the woods on hills  he knew. He was watching with eyes and ears and imagination to see  what would happen in No Man's Land under that ominous mist: but his  mind took a peep for all that at the old woods that he knew. He  pictured himself, he and a band of boys, chasing squirrels again in  the summer. They used to chase a squirrel from tree to tree, throwing  stones, till they tired it: and then they might hit it with a stone:  usually not. Sometimes the squirrel would hide, and a boy would have  to climb after it. It was great sport, thought Dick Cheeser. What a  pity he hadn't had a catapult in those days, he thought. Somehow the  years when he had not had a catapult seemed all to be wasted years.  With a catapult one might get the squirrel almost at once, with luck:  and what a great thing that would be. All the other boys would come  round to look at the squirrel, and to look at the catapult, and ask  him how he did it. He wouldn't have to say much, there would be the  squirrel; no boasting would be necessary with the squirrel lying dead.  It might spread to other things, even rabbits; almost anything, in  fact. He would certainly get a catapult first thing when he got home.  A little wind blew in the night, too cold for summer. It blew away, as  it were, the summer of Dick's memories; blew away hills and woods and  squirrel. It made for a moment a lane in the mist over No Man's Land.  Dick Cheeser peered down it, but it closed again. \"No,\" Night seemed  to say, \"you don't guess my secret.\" And the awful hush intensified.  \"What would they do?\" thought the sentry. \"What were they planning  in all those miles of silence?\" Even the Verys were few. When one  went up, far hills seemed to sit and brood over the valley: their  black shapes seemed to know what would happen in the mist and seemed  sworn not to say. The rocket faded, and the hills went back into  mystery again, and Dick Cheeser peered level again over the ominous  valley.    All the dangers and sinister shapes and evil destinies, lurking  between the armies in that mist, that the sentry faced that night  cannot be told until the history of the war is written by a historian  who can see the mind of the soldier. Not a shell fell all night, no  German stirred; Dick Cheeser was relieved at \"Stand to\" and his  comrades stood to beside him, and soon it was wide, golden, welcome  dawn.    And for all the threats of night the thing that happened was one that  the lonely sentry had never foreseen: in the hour of his watching Dick  Cheeser, though scarcely eighteen, became a full-grown man.          Standing To      One cannot say that one time in the trenches is any more tense than  another. One cannot take any one particular hour and call it, in  modern nonsensical talk, \"typical hour in the trenches.\" The routine  of the trenches has gone on too long for that. The tensest hour ought  to be half an hour before dawn, the hour when attacks are expected and  men stand to. It is an old convention of war that that is the  dangerous hour, the hour when defenders are weakest and attack most to  be feared. For darkness favours the attackers then as night favours  the lion, and then dawn comes and they can hold their gains in the  light. Therefore in every trench in every war the garrison is prepared  in that menacing hour, watching in greater numbers than they do the  whole night through. As the first lark lifts from meadows they stand  there in the dark. Whenever there is any war in any part of the world  you may be sure that at that hour men crowd to their parapets: when  sleep is deepest in cities they are watching there.    When the dawn shimmers a little, and a grey light comes, and widens,  and all of a sudden figures become distinct, and the hour of the  attack that is always expected is gone, then perhaps some faint  feeling of gladness stirs the newest of the recruits; but chiefly the  hour passes like all the other hours there, an unnoticed fragment of  the long, long routine that is taken with resignation mingled with  jokes.    Dawn comes shy with a wind scarce felt, dawn faint and strangely  perceptible, feeble and faint in the east while men still watch the  darkness. When did the darkness go? When did the dawn grow golden? It  happened as in a moment, a moment you did not see. Guns flash no  longer: the sky is gold and serene; dawn stands there like Victory  that will shine, on one of these years when the Kaiser goes the way of  the older curses of earth. Dawn, and the men unfix bayonets as they  step down from the fire-step and clean their rifles with  pull-throughs. Not all together, but section by section, for it would  not do for a whole company to be caught cleaning their rifles at dawn,  or at any other time.    They rub off the mud or the rain that has come at night on their  rifles, they detach the magazine and see that its spring is working,  they take out the breechblock and oil it, and put back everything  clean: and another night is gone; it is one day nearer victory.          The Splendid Traveller      A traveller threw his cloak over his shoulder and came down slopes of  gold in El Dorado. From incredible heights he came. He came from where  the peaks of the pure gold mountain shone a little red with the  sunset; from crag to crag of gold he stepped down slowly. Sheer out of  romance he came through the golden evening.    It was only an incident of every day; the sun had set or was setting,  the air turned chill, and a battalion's bugles were playing  \"Retreat\" when this knightly stranger, a British aeroplane, dipped,  and went homeward over the infantry. That beautiful evening call, and  the golden cloud bank towering, and that adventurer coming home in the  cold, happening all together, revealed in a flash the fact (which  hours of thinking sometimes will not bring) that we live in such a  period of romance as the troubadours would have envied.    He came, that British airman, over the border, sheer over No Man's  Land and the heads of the enemy and the mysterious land behind,  snatching the secrets that the enemy would conceal. Either he had  defeated the German airmen who would have stopped his going, or they  had not dared to try. Who knows what he had done? He had been abroad  and was coming home in the evening, as he did every day.    Even when all its romance has been sifted from an age (as the  centuries sift) and set apart from the trivial, and when all has been  stored by the poets; even then what has any of them more romantic than  these adventurers in the evening air, coming home in the twilight with  the black shells bursting below?    The infantry look up with the same vague wonder with which children  look at dragon flies; sometimes they do not look at all, for all that  comes in France has its part with the wonder of a terrible story as  well as with the incidents of the day, incidents that recur year in  and year out, too often for us to notice them. If a part of the moon  were to fall off in the sky and come tumbling to earth, the comment on  the lips of the imperturbable British watchers that have seen so much  would be, \"Hullo, what is Jerry up to now?\"    And so the British aeroplane glides home in the evening, and the light  fades from the air, and what is left of the poplars grows dark against  the sky, and what is left of the houses grows more mournful in the  gloaming, and night comes, and with it the sounds of thunder, for the  airman has given his message to the artillery. It is as though Hermes  had gone abroad sailing upon his sandals, and had found some bad land  below those winged feet wherein men did evil and kept not the laws of  gods or men; and he had brought this message back and the gods were  angry.    For the wars we fight to-day are not like "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/572"],[0,"The Great Big Treasury of Beatrix Potter (#4)"],[1,"  Perhaps she liked the smell of onions!    Anyway, she sat down upon the top  of the basket.    She sat there for FIVE HOURS.    I cannot draw you a picture of  Peter and Benjamin underneath the  basket, because it was quite dark, and  because the smell of onions was  fearful; it made Peter Rabbit and little  Benjamin cry.    The sun got round behind the  wood, and it was quite late in the  afternoon; but still the cat sat upon  the basket.    At length there was a pitter-patter,  pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar  fell from the wall above.    The cat looked up and saw old Mr.  Benjamin Bunny prancing along the  top of the wall of the upper terrace.    He was smoking a pipe of rabbit-  tobacco, and had a little switch in his  hand.    He was looking for his son.      Old Mr. Bunny had no opinion  whatever of cats. He took a  tremendous jump off the top of the  wall on to the top of the cat, and  cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it  into the greenhouse, scratching off a  handful of fur.    The cat was too much surprised to  scratch back.    When old Mr. Bunny had driven the  cat into the greenhouse, he locked the  door.    Then he came back to the basket  and took out his son Benjamin by the  ears, and whipped him with the little  switch.    Then he took out his nephew Peter.    Then he took out the handkerchief  of onions, and marched out of the  garden.      When Mr. McGregor returned  about half an hour later he observed  several things which perplexed him.    It looked as though some person  had been walking all over the garden  in a pair of clogs--only the footmarks  were too ridiculously little!    Also he could not understand how  the cat could have managed to shut  herself up INSIDE the greenhouse,  locking the door upon the OUTSIDE.    When Peter got home his mother  forgave him, because she was so glad  to see that he had found his shoes and  coat. Cotton-tail and Peter folded up  the pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs.  Rabbit strung up the onions and hung  them from the kitchen ceiling, with  the bunches of herbs and the rabbit-  tobacco.          THE TALE OF  TWO BAD MICE    [For W.M.L.W., the Little Girl  Who Had the Doll's House]          Once upon a time there was a very  beautiful doll's-house; it was red  brick with white windows, and it had  real muslin curtains and a front door  and a chimney.    It belonged to two Dolls called  Lucinda and Jane; at least it belonged  to Lucinda, but she never ordered  meals.    Jane was the Cook; but she never  did any cooking, because the dinner  had been bought ready-made, in a  box full of shavings.    There were two red lobsters and a  ham, a fish, a pudding, and some  pears and oranges.    They would not come off the plates,  but they were extremely beautiful.      One morning Lucinda and Jane had  gone out for a drive in the doll's  perambulator. There was no one in  the nursery, and it was very quiet.  Presently there was a little scuffling,  scratching noise in a corner near the  fireplace, where there was a hole  under the skirting-board.    Tom Thumb put out his head for a  moment, and then popped it in again.  Tom Thumb was a mouse.    A minute afterwards, Hunca  Munca, his wife, put her head out,  too; and when she saw that there was  no one in the nursery, she ventured  out on the oilcloth under the coal-box.    The doll's-house stood at the other  side of the fire-place. Tom Thumb  and Hunca Munca went cautiously  across the hearthrug. They pushed  the front door--it was not fast.      Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca  went upstairs and peeped into the  dining-room. Then they squeaked  with joy!    Such a lovely dinner was laid out  upon the table! There were tin  spoons, and lead knives and forks,  and two dolly-chairs--all SO  convenient!    Tom Thumb set to work at once to  carve the ham. It was a beautiful  shiny yellow, streaked with red.    The knife crumpled up and hurt  him; he put his finger in his mouth.    \"It is not boiled enough; it is hard.  You have a try, Hunca Munca.\"    Hunca Munca stood up in her  chair, and chopped at the ham with  another lead knife.    \"It's as hard as the hams at the  cheesemonger's,\" said Hunca Munca.    The ham broke off the plate with a  jerk, and rolled under the table.      \"Let it alone,\" said Tom Thumb;  \"give me some fish, Hunca Munca!\"    Hunca Munca tried every tin spoon  in turn; the fish was glued to the dish.    Then Tom Thumb lost his temper.  He put the ham in the middle of the  floor, and hit it with the tongs and  with the shovel--bang, bang, smash,  smash!    The ham flew all into pieces, for  underneath the shiny paint it was  made of nothing but plaster!    Then there was no end to the rage  and disappointment of Tom Thumb  and Hunca Munca. They broke up the  pudding, the lobsters, the pears and  the oranges.    As the fish would not come off the  plate, they put it into the red-hot  crinkly paper fire in the kitchen; but it  would not burn either.      Tom Thumb went up the kitchen  chimney and looked out at the top--  there was no soot.    While Tom Thumb was up the  chimney, Hunca Munca had another  disappointment. She found some tiny  canisters upon the dresser, labelled--  Rice--Coffee--Sago--but when she  turned them upside down, there was  nothing inside except red and blue  beads.    Then those mice set to work to do  all the mischief they could--especially  Tom Thumb! He took Jane's clothes  out of the chest of drawers in her  bedroom, and he threw them out of  the top floor window.    But Hunca Munca had a frugal  mind. After pulling half the feathers  out of Lucinda's bolster, she  remembered that she herself was in  want of a feather bed.      With Tom Thumbs's assistance she  carried the bolster downstairs, and  across the hearth-rug. It was difficult  to squeeze the bolster into the mouse-  hole; but they managed it somehow.    Then Hunca Munca went back and  fetched a chair, a book-case, a bird-  cage, and several small odds and  ends. The book-case and the bird-  cage refused to go into the mousehole.    Hunca Munca left them behind the  coal-box, and went to fetch a cradle.      Hunca Munca was just returning  with another chair, when suddenly  there was a noise of talking outside  upon the landing. The mice rushed  back to their hole, and the dolls came  into the nursery.    What a sight met the eyes of Jane  and Lucinda! Lucinda sat upon the  upset kitchen stove and stared; and  Jane leant against the kitchen dresser  and smiled--but neither of them  made any remark.    The book-case and the bird-cage  were rescued from under the coal-  box--but Hunca Munca has got the  cradle, and some of Lucinda's  clothes.      She also has some useful pots and  pans, and several other things.    The little girl that the doll's-house  belonged to, said,--\"I will get a doll  dressed like a policeman!\"    But the nurse said,--\"I will set a  mouse-trap!\"    So that is the story of the two Bad  Mice,--but they were not so very very  naughty after all, because Tom  Thumb paid for everything he broke.      He found a crooked sixpence under  the hearth-rug; and upon Christmas  Eve, he and Hunca Munca stuffed it  into one of the stockings of Lucinda  and Jane.    And very early every morning--  before anybody is awake--Hunca  Munca comes with her dust-pan and  her broom to sweep the Dollies' house!        THE TALE OF  MRS. TIGGY-WINKLE      [For the Real  Little Lucie of Newlands]          Once upon a time there was a little  girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm  called Little-town. She was a good  little girl--only she was always losing  her pocket-handkerchiefs!    One day little Lucie came into the  farm-yard crying--oh, she did cry so!  \"I've lost my pocket-handkin! Three  handkins and a pinny! Have YOU seen  them, Tabby Kitten?\"    The Kitten went on washing her white paws;  so Lucie asked a speckled hen--    \"Sally Henny-penny, have YOU  found three pocket-handkins?\"    But the speckled hen ran into a  barn, clucking--    \"I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!\"    And then Lucie asked Cock Robin  sitting on a twig. Cock Robin looked  sideways at Lucie with his bright  black eye, and he flew over a stile and  away.    Lucie climbed upon the stile and  looked up at the hill behind Little-  town--a hill that goes up--up--into  the clouds as though it had no top!    And a great way up the hillside she  thought she saw some white things  spread upon the grass.      Lucie scrambled up the hill as fast  as her short legs would carry her; she  ran along a steep path-way--up and  up--until Little-town was right away  down below--she could have  dropped a pebble down the chimney!    Presently she came to a spring,  bubbling out from the hillside.    Some one had stood a tin can upon  a stone to catch the water--but the  water was already running over, for  the can was no bigger than an egg-  cup! And where the sand upon the  path was wet--there were footmarks  of a VERY small person.    Lucie ran on, and on.    The path ended under a big rock.  The grass was short and green, and  there were clothes-props cut from  bracken stems, with lines of plaited  rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes  pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!    But there was something else--a  door! straight into the hill; and inside  it some one was singing--         \"Lily-white and clean, oh!       With little frills between, oh!       Smooth and hot-red rusty spot       Never here be seen, oh!\"        Lucie knocked-once-twice, and  interrupted the song. A little  frightened voice called out \"Who's  that?\"    Lucie opened the door: and what  do you think there was inside the  hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a  flagged floor and wooden beams--  just like any other farm kitchen. Only  the ceiling was so low that Lucie's  head nearly touched it; and the pots  and pans were small, and so was  everything there.    There was a nice hot singey smell;  and at the table, with an iron in her  hand, stood a very stout short person"]]]
