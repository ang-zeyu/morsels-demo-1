Amongst our  occasional visitors was a well-known gentleman, bearing the proud title  of \"The biggest liar in Australia.\" How far he deserved the distinction I  should hesitate to say, for men prone to exaggerate are not uncommon in  the bush. Sometimes, however, they must have the melancholy satisfaction  of knowing that they are disbelieved, when they really do happen to tell  the truth. A story of my friend's, which was received with incredulous  laughter, will exemplify this.    This was one of his experiences in Central Australia. He was perishing  from thirst, and, at the last gasp, he came to a clay-pan which, to his  despair, was quite dry and baked hard by the sun. He gave up all hope; not  so his black-boy, who, after examining the surface of the hard clay,  started to dig vigorously, shouting, \"No more tumble down, plenty water  here!\" Struggling to the side of his boy, he found that he had unearthed a  large frog blown out with water, with which they relieved their thirst.  Subsequent digging disclosed more frogs, from all of which so great a  supply of water was squeezed that not only he and his boy, but the horses  also were saved from a terrible death!    This story was received with laughter and jeers, and cries of  \"Next please!\" But to show that it had foundations of truth I may quote an  extract from \"The Horn Scientific Expedition to Central Australia\"  (part i. p. 21), in which we read the following:--    \". . . The most interesting animal is the Burrowing or Waterholding Frog,  (CHIROLEPTES PLATYCEPHALUS). As the pools dry up it fills itself out with  water, which in some way passes through the walls of the alimentary  canal, filling up the body cavity, and swelling the animal out until it  looks like a small orange. In this condition it occupies a cavity just big  enough for the body, and simply goes to sleep. When, with the aid of a  native, we cut it out of its hiding-place, the animal at first remained  perfectly still, with its lower eyelids completely drawn over the eyes,  giving it the appearance of being blind, which indeed the black assured  us that it was. . . .\"    Most travellers cannot fail to have noticed how clay-pans recently filled  by rain, even after a prolonged drought, swarm with tadpoles and  full-grown frogs and numberless water insects, the presence of which must  only be explained by the ability of the frog to store his supply in his  own body, and the fact that the eggs of the insects require moisture  before they can hatch out.    Many a laugh we had round the camp-fire at night, and many are the yarns  that were spun. Few, however, were of sufficient interest to live in my  memory, and I fear that most of them would lose their points in becoming  fit for publication. \"Gold,\" naturally, was the chief topic of  conversation, especially amongst the older diggers, who love to tell one  in detail how many ounces they got in one place and how many in another,  until one feels that surely they must be either millionaires or liars.  New rushes, and supposed new rushes, were eagerly discussed; men were  often passing and repassing our rock, looking for somebody who was  \"on gold\"--for the majority of prospectors seldom push out for themselves,  but prefer following up some man or party supposed to have \"struck it  rich.\"    The rumours of a new find so long bandied about at length came true.  Billy Frost had found a thousand! two thousand!! three thousand  ounces!!!--who knew or cared?--on the margin of a large salt lake some  ninety miles north of Coolgardie. Frost has since told me that about  twelve ounces of gold was all he found, And, after all, there is not much  difference between twelve and three thousand--that is on a mining field.  Before long the solitude of our camp was disturbed by the constant passing  of travellers to and from this newly discovered \"Ninety Mile\"--so named  from its distance from Coolgardie.    As a fact, this mining camp (now known as the town of Goongarr) is only  sixty odd miles from the capital, measured by survey, but in early days,  distances were reckoned by rate of travel, and roads and tracks twisted  and turned in a most distressing manner, sometimes deviating for water,  but more often because the first maker of the track had been riding along  carelessly, every now and then turning sharp back to his proper course.  Subsequent horse or camel men, having only a vague knowledge of the  direction of their destination, would be bound to follow the first tracks;  after these would come light buggies, spring-carts, drays, and heavy  waggons, until finally a deeply rutted and well-worn serpentine road  through the forest or scrub was formed, to be straightened in course of  time, as observant travellers cut off corners, and later by Government  surveyors and road-makers.    Prospectors were gradually \"poking out,\" gold being found in all  directions in greater or less degree; but it was not until June, 1893,  that any find was made of more than passing interest. Curiously, this  great goldfield of Hannan's (now called Kalgoorlie) was found by the  veriest chance. Patrick Hannan, like many others, had joined in a  wild-goose chase to locate a supposed rush at Mount Yule--a mountain the  height and importance of which may be judged from the fact that no one was  able to find it! On going out one morning to hunt up his horses, he  chanced on a nugget of gold. In the course of five years this little  nugget has transformed the silent bush into a populous town of 2,000  inhabitants, with its churches, clubs, hotels, and streets of offices and  shops, surrounded by rich mines, and reminded of the cause of its  existence by the ceaseless crashing of mills and stamps, grinding out gold  at the rate of nearly 80,000 oz. per mouth.    Arriving one Sunday morning from our camp at the \"Twenty-five,\" I was  astonished to find Coolgardie almost deserted, not even the usual \"Sunday  School\" going on. Now I am sorry to disappoint my readers who are not  conversant with miners' slang, but they must not picture rows of good  little children sitting in the shade of the gum-trees, to whom some  kind-hearted digger is expounding the Scriptures. No indeed! The miners'  school is neither more nor less than a largely attended game of  pitch-and-toss, at which sometimes hundreds of pounds in gold or notes  change hands. I remember one old man who had only one shilling between him  and the grave, so he told me. He could not decide whether to invest his  last coin in a gallon of water or in the \"heading-school.\" He chose the  latter and lost . . . subsequently I saw him lying peacefully drunk under  a tree! I doubt if his intention had been suicide, but had it been he  could hardly have chosen a more deadly weapon than the whiskey of those  days.    The \"rush to Hannan's\" had depopulated Coolgardie and the next day saw  Davies and myself amongst an eager train of travellers bound for the new  site of fortune. \"Little Carnegie\" was harnessed to a small cart, which  carried our provisions and tools. The commissariat department was easily  attended to, as nothing was obtainable but biscuits and tinned soup. It  was now mid-winter, and nights were often bitterly cold. Without tent or  fly, and with hardly a blanket between us, we used to lie shivering at  night.    A slight rain had fallen, insufficient to leave much water about, and yet  enough to so moisten the soil as to make dry-blowing impossible in the  ordinary way. Fires had to be built and kept going all night, piled up on  heaps of alluvial soil dug out during the day. In the morning these heaps  would be dry enough to treat, and ashes and earth were dry-blown  together--the pleasures of the ordinary process being intensified by the  addition of clouds of ashes.    A strange appearance these fires had, dotted through the brush, lighting  up now a tent, now a water-cart, now a camp of fortunate ones lying cosily  under their canvas roof, now a set of poor devils with hardly a rag to  their backs. Oh glorious uncertainty of mining! One of these very poor  devils that I have in my mind has now a considerable fortune, with rooms  in a fashionable quarter of London, and in frock-coat and tall hat  \"swells\" it with the best!    How quickly men change to be sure! A man who at one time would \"steal the  shirt off a dead black-fellow,\" in a few short months is complaining of  the taste of his wine or the fit of his patent-leather boots. Dame Fortune  was good to some, but to us, like many others, she turned a deaf ear, and  after many weeks' toil we had to give up the battle, for neither food,  money, nor gold had we. All I possessed was the pony, and from that old  friend I could not part. The fruits of our labours, or I should say my  share in them, I sent home in a letter, and the few pin's-heads of gold  so sent did not necessitate any extra postage. Weary and toil-worn we  returned to Coolgardie, and the partners of some rather remarkable  experiences split company, and went each his own way.    It is several years since I have seen Mr. Davies; but I believe Fortune's  wheel turned round for him at length, and that now he enjoys the rest that  his years and toils entitle him to. I have many kindly recollections of  our camping days together, and of the numerous yarns my mate used to spin  of his palmy days as a Queensland squatter.          CHAPTER III        A MINER ON BAYLEY'S      Returned from the rush, I made my way to Bayley's to seek employment for  my pony and his master. Nor did I seek in vain, for I was duly entered on  the pay-sheet as \"surface hand\" at 3 pounds 10 shillings per week, with  water at the rate of one gallon per day. Here I first made the  acquaintance of Godfrey Massie, a cousin of the Brownes, who, like me,  had been forced by want of luck to work for wages, and who, by the way,  had carried his \"swag\" on his back from York to the goldfields, a distance  of nearly 300 miles.

Everybody seemed to have forgotten the girl, a stranger in Cheslow,  and for the first day of her life away from kind and indulgent  friends.    It was only ten minutes walk to the railroad station, and Ruth  remembered that it was a straight road. She arrived in the waiting  room safely enough. Sam Curtis, the station master, descried her  immediately and came out of his office with her bag.    \"Well, and what happened? Is that boy really hurt?\" he asked.    \"He has a broken arm and his head is cut. I do not know how seriously,  for Doctor Davison had not finished examining him when I--I came  away,\" she replied, bravely enough, and hiding the fact that she had  been overlooked.    \"They took him to the doctor's house, did they?\" asked Sam.    \"Yes, sir,\" said Ruth. \"But--\"    \"Mr. Curtis, has there been anybody here for me?\"    \"For you, Miss?\" the station master returned, somewhat surprised it  seemed.    \"Yes, sir. Anybody from Red Mill?\"    Curtis smote one fist into his other palm, exclaiming:    \"You don't mean to say that you was what Jabe Potter was after?\"    \"Mr. Jabez Potter, who keeps the Red Mill, is my uncle,\" Ruth  observed, with dignity.    \"My goodness gracious me, Miss! He was here long before your train was  due. He's kind of short in his speech, Miss. And he asked me if there  was anything here for him, and I told him no. And he stumped out again  without another word. Why, I thought he was looking for an express  package, or freight. Never had an idea he was expectin' a niece!\"    Ruth still looked at him earnestly. The man did not suspect, by her  appearance, how hard a time she was having to keep the tears from  overrunning those calm, gray eyes.    \"And you expected to go out to the Red Mill to-night, Miss?\" he  continued. \"They're country folk out there and they'd all be abed  before you could get there, even if you took a carriage.\"    \"I don't know that I have enough to pay for carriage hire,\" Ruth said,  softly. \"Is--is there any place I can stop over night in the village?  Then I can walk out in the morning.\"    \"Why--there's a hotel. But a young girl like you--You'll excuse me,  Miss. You're young to be traveling alone.\"    \"Perhaps I haven't money enough to pay for a lodging there?\" suggested  Ruth. \"I have a dollar. It was given me to spend as I liked on the  way. But Miss True gave me such a big box of luncheon that I did not  want anything.\"    \"A dollar wouldn't go far at the Brick Hotel,\" murmured the station  agent. He still stared at her, stroking his lean, shaven jaw. Finally  he burst out with: \"I tell you! We'll go home and see what my wife  says.\"    At the moment the station began to jar with the thunder of a coming  train and Ruth could not make herself heard in reply to his proposal.  Besides, Sam Curtis hurried out on the platform. Nor was Ruth ready to  assert her independence and refuse any kind of help the station master  might offer. So she sat down patiently and waited for him.    There were one or two passengers only to disembark from this train and  they went away from the station without even coming into the waiting  room. Then Curtis came back, putting out the lights and locking his  ticket office. The baggage room was already locked and Ruth's old  trunk was in it.    \"Come on now, girl--What's your name?\" asked Curtis.    \"Ruth Fielding.\"    \"Just so! Well, it's only a step to our house and wife will have  supper waiting. And there's nobody else there save Mercy.\"    Ruth was a little curious about \"Mercy\"--whether it referred to  abounding grace, or was a person's name. But she asked no questions as  they came out of the railroad station and Sam Curtis locked the door.    They did not cross the tracks this time, but went into the new part of  the town. Turning a corner very soon as they walked up what Curtis  said was Market Street, they reached, on a narrow side street, a  little, warm-looking cottage, from almost all the lower windows of  which the lamplight shone cheerfully. There was a garden beside it,  with a big grape arbor arranged like a summer-house with rustic chairs  and a table. The light shining on the side porch revealed the arbor to  Ruth's quick eyes.    When they stepped upon this porch Ruth heard a very shrill and not at  all pleasant voice saying--very rapidly, and over and over again: \"I  don't want to! I don't want to! I don't want to!\" It might have been a  parrot, or some other ill-natured talking bird; only Ruth saw nothing  of the feathered conversationalist when Sam opened the door and  ushered her in.    \"Here we are, wife!\" he exclaimed, cheerfully. \"And how's Mercy?\"    The reiterated declaration had stopped instantly. A comely, kind-faced  woman with snow-white hair, came forward. Ruth saw that she was some  years younger than Curtis, and he was not yet forty. It was not Father  Time that had powdered Mrs. Curtis' head so thickly.    \"Mercy is--Why, who's this?\" she asked espying Ruth. \"One of the  girls come in to see her?\"    Instantly the same whining, shrill voice began:    \"I don't want her to see me! They come to stare at me! I hate 'em all!  All girls do is to run and jump and play tag and ring-around-a-rosy  and run errands, and dance! I hate 'em!\"    This was said very, very fast--almost chattered; and it sounded so  ill-natured, so impatient, so altogether mean and hateful, that Ruth  fell back a step, almost afraid to enter the pleasant room. But then  she saw the white-haired lady's face, and it was so grieved, yet  looked such a warm welcome to her, that she took heart and stepped  farther in, so that Sam Curtis could shut the door.    The father appeared to pay no attention to the fault-finding, shrill  declamation of the unhappy voice. He said, in explanation, to his  wife:    \"This is Ruth Fielding. She has come a long way by train to-day,  expecting to meet her uncle, old Jabe Potter of the Red Mill. And you  know how funny Jabe is, wife? He came before the train, and did not  wait, but drove right away with his mules and so there was nobody here  to meet Ruthie. She's marooned here till the morning, you see.\"    \"Then she shall stay with us to-night,\" declared Mrs. Curtis, quickly.    \"I don't want her to stay here to-night!\" ejaculated the same shrill  voice.    Mr. and Mrs. Curtis paid no attention to what was said by this  mysterious third party. Ruth, coming farther into the room, found that  it was large and pleasant. There was a comfortable look about it all.  The supper table was set and the door was opened into the warm  kitchen, from which delicious odors of tea and toast with some warm  dish of meat, were wafted in. But the shrill and complaining voice had  not come from the next room.    In the other corner beside the stove, yet not too near it, stood a  small canopy bed with the pretty chintz curtains drawn all about it.  Beside it stood a wheel-chair such as Ruth knew was used by invalids  who could not walk. It was a tiny chair, too, and it and the small bed  went together. But of the occupant of either she saw not a sign.    \"Supper will be ready just as soon as our guest has a chance to remove  the traces of travel, Sam,\" said Mrs. Curtis, briskly. \"Come with me,  Ruth.\"    When they returned from the pleasant little bed-chamber which the  good-hearted lady told Ruth was to be her own for that night, they  heard voices in the sitting room--the voice of Mr. Curtis and the  querulous one. But it was not so sharp and strained as it seemed  before. However, on opening the door, Mr. Curtis was revealed sitting  alone and there was no sign of the owner of the sharp voice, which  Ruth supposed must belong to the invalid.    \"Mercy has had her supper; hasn't she, wife?\" said the station master  as he drew his chair to the table and motioned Ruth to the extra place  Mrs. Curtis had set.    The woman nodded and went briskly about putting the supper on the  table. While they ate Mr. Curtis told about Reno stopping the train,  and of the search for and recovery of the injured Cameron boy. All the  time Ruth, who sat sideways to the canopied bed, realized that the  curtains at the foot were drawn apart just a crack and that two very  bright, pin-point eyes were watching her. So interested did these eyes  become as the story progressed, and Ruth answered questions, that more  of Mercy Curtis' face was revealed--a sharp, worn little face, with a  peaked chin and pale, thin cheeks.    Ruth was very tired when supper was ended and the kind Mrs. Curtis  suggested that she go to bed and obtain a good night's rest if she was  to walk to the Red Mill in the morning. But even when she bade her  entertainers good-night she did not see the child in the canopy bed  and she felt diffident about asking Mrs. Curtis about her. The young  traveler slept soundly--almost from the moment her head touched the  pillow. Yet her last thought was of Uncle Jabez. He had been in town  some time before the train on which she arrived was due and had driven  away from the station with his mules, Mr. Curtis said. Had he driven  over that dark and dangerous road on which Tom Cameron met with his  accident, and had he run down the injured boy, or forced him over the  bank of the deep gully where they had found Tom lying unconscious?    \"It was Jabe Potter--he did it,\" the injured lad had murmured, and  these words were woven in the pattern of Ruth's dreams all night.    The little cottage was astir early and Ruth was no laggard. She came  down to breakfast while the sun was just peeping above the house-tops  and as she entered the sitting room she found an occupant at last in  the little wheel-chair. It was the sharp, pale little face that  confronted her above the warm wrapper and the rug that covered the  lower part of the child's body; for child Mercy Curtis was, and little  older than Ruth herself,"]]]
