[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/444"],[0,"System of Economical Contradictions; Or, The Philosophy of Misery (#4)"],[1,"proves that the  globe has not been inhabited always, we must admit also that, at  a given moment, the eternal germs of animals and plants were  born, without father or mother, over the whole face of the earth.    Thus, the denial of spontaneous generation leads back to the  hypothesis of spontaneity: what is there in much-derided  metaphysics more contradictory?    Let it not be thought, however, that I deny the value and  certainty of chemical theories, or that the atomic theory seems  to me absurd, or that I share the Epicurean opinion as to  spontaneous generation.  Once more, all that I wish to point out  is that, from the point of view of principles, chemistry needs to  exercise extreme tolerance, since its own existence depends on a  certain number of fictions, contrary to reason and experience,  and destructive of each other.        I certainly have less inclination to the marvellous than  many atheists, but I cannot help thinking that the stories of  miracles, prophecies, charms, etc., are but distorted accounts of  the extraordinary effects produced by certain latent forces, or,  as was formerly said, by occult powers.  Our science is still so  brutal and unfair; our professors exhibit so much impertinence  with so little knowledge; they deny so impudently facts which  embarrass them, in order to protect the opinions which they  champion,--that I distrust strong minds equally with  superstitious ones.  Yes, I am convinced of it; our gross  rationalism is the inauguration of a period which, thanks to  science, will become truly PRODIGIOUS; the universe, to my eyes,  is only a laboratory of magic, from which anything may be  expected. . . .  This said, I return to my subject.    They would be deceived, then, who should imagine, after my rapid  survey of religious progress, that metaphysics has uttered its  last word upon the double enigma expressed in these four  words,--the existence of God, the immortality of the soul.  Here,  as elsewhere, the most advanced and best established conclusions,  those which seem to have settled for ever the theological  question, lead us back to primeval mysticism, and involve the new  data of an inevitable philosophy.  The criticism of religious  opinions makes us smile today both at ourselves and at religions;  and yet the resume of this criticism is but a reproduction of the  problem.  The human race, at the present moment, is on the eve of  recognizing and affirming something equivalent to the old notion  of Divinity; and this, not by a spontaneous movement as before,  but through reflection and by means of irresistible logic.  I  will try, in a few words, to make myself understood.    If there is a point on which philosophers, in spite of  themselves, have finally succeeded in agreeing, it is without  doubt the distinction between intelligence and necessity, the  subject of thought and its object, the me and the not-me; in  ordinary terms, spirit and matter.  I know well that all these  terms express nothing that is real and true; that each of them  designates only a section of the absolute, which alone is true  and real; and that, taken separately, they involve, all alike, a  contradiction.  But it is no less certain also that the absolute  is completely inaccessible to us; that we know it only by its  opposite extremes, which alone fall within the limits of our  experience; and that, if unity only can win our faith, duality is  the first condition of science.    Thus, who thinks, and what is thought?  What is a soul? what is a  body?  I defy any one to escape this dualism.  It is with  essences as with ideas: the former are seen separated in Nature,  as the latter in the understanding; and just as the ideas of God  and immortality, in spite of their identity, are posited  successively and contradictorily in philosophy, so, in spite of  their fusion in the absolute, the me and the not-me posit  themselves separately and contradictorily in Nature, and we have  beings who think, at the same time with others which do not  think.    Now, whoever has taken pains to reflect knows today that such a  distinction, wholly realized though it be, is the most  unintelligible, most contradictory, most absurd thing which  reason can possibly meet.  Being is no more conceivable without  the properties of spirit than without the properties of  matter: so that if you deny spirit, because, included in none of  the categories of time, space, motion, solidity, etc., it seems  deprived of all the attributes which constitute reality, I in my  turn will deny matter, which, presenting nothing appreciable but  its inertia, nothing intelligible but its forms, manifests itself  nowhere as cause (voluntary and free), and disappears from view  entirely as substance; and we arrive at pure idealism, that is,  nihility.  But nihility is inconsistent with the existence of  living, reasoning--I know not what to call them--uniting in  themselves, in a state of commenced synthesis or imminent  dissolution, all the antagonistic attributes of being.  We are  compelled, then, to end in a dualism whose terms we know  perfectly well to be false, but which, being for us the condition  of the truth, forces itself irresistibly upon us; we are  compelled, in short, to commence, like Descartes and the human  race, with the me; that is, with spirit.    But, since religions and philosophies, dissolved by analysis,  have disappeared in the theory of the absolute, we know no better  than before what spirit is, and in this differ from the ancients  only in the wealth of language with which we adorn the darkness  that envelops us.  With this exception, however; that while, to  the ancients, order revealed intelligence OUTSIDE of the world,  to the people of today it seems to reveal it rather WITHIN the  world.  Now, whether we place it within or without, from the  moment we affirm it on the ground of order, we must admit it  wherever order is manifested, or deny it altogether.  There is no  more reason for attributing intelligence to the head which  produced the \"Iliad\" than to a mass of matter which crystallizes  in octahedrons; and, reciprocally, it is as absurd to refer the  system of the world to physical laws, leaving out an ordaining  ME, as to attribute the victory of Marengo to strategic  combinations, leaving out the first consul.  The only distinction  that can be made is that, in the latter case, the thinking ME is  located in the brain of a Bonaparte, while, in the case of the  universe, the ME has no special location, but extends everywhere.    The materialists think that they have easily disposed of their  opponents by saying that man, having likened the universe to his  body, finishes the comparison by presuming the existence in the  universe of a soul similar to that which he supposes to be the  principle of his own life and thought; that thus all the  arguments in support of the existence of God are reducible to an  analogy all the more false because the term of comparison is  itself hypothetical.    It is certainly not my intention to defend the old syllogism:  Every arrangement implies an ordaining intelligence; there is  wonderful order in the world; then the world is the work of an  intelligence.  This syllogism, discussed so widely since the days  of Job and Moses, very far from being a solution, is but the  statement of the problem which it assumes to solve.  We know  perfectly well what order is, but we are absolutely ignorant of  the meaning of the words Soul, Spirit, Intelligence: how, then,  can we logically reason from the presence of the one to the  existence of the other?  I reject, then, even when advanced by  the most thoroughly informed, the pretended proof of the  existence of God drawn from the presence of order in the world; I  see in it at most only an equation offered to philosophy.  Between the conception of order and the affirmation of spirit  there is a deep gulf of metaphysics to be filled up; I am  unwilling, I repeat, to take the problem for the demonstration.    But this is not the point which we are now considering.  I have  tried to show that the human mind was inevitably and irresistibly  led to the distinction of being into me and not-me, spirit and  matter, soul and body.  Now, who does not see that the objection  of the materialists proves the very thing it is intended to deny?  Man distinguishing within himself a spiritual principle and a  material principle,--what is this but Nature herself, proclaiming  by turns her double essence, and bearing testimony to her own  laws?  And notice the inconsistency of materialism: it denies,  and has to deny, that man is free; now, the less liberty man has,  the more weight is to be attached to his words, and the greater  their claim to be regarded as the expression of truth.  When I  hear this machine say to me, \"I am soul and I am body,\" though  such a revelation astonishes and confounds me, it is invested in  my eyes with an authority incomparably greater than that of the  materialist who, correcting conscience and Nature, undertakes to  make them say, \"I am matter and only matter, and intelligence is  but the material faculty of knowing.\"    What would become of this assertion, if, assuming in my turn the  offensive, I should demonstrate that belief in the existence of  bodies, or, in other words, in the reality of a purely corporeal  nature, is untenable?  Matter, they say, is  impenetrable.--Impenetrable by what? I ask.  Itself, undoubtedly;  for they would not dare to say spirit, since they would therein  admit what they wish to set aside.  Whereupon I raise this double  question:  What do you know about it, and what does it signify?    1. Impenetrability, which is pretended to be the definition of  matter, is only an hypothesis of careless naturalists, a gross  conclusion deduced from a superficial judgment.

Murmurs and       complaints were uttered. He quelled everything; scolded,       plead, threatened, prophesied, and subdued them. With a       restless but resistless energy he set them to work, and worked       himself as their example. He directed their labors,       controlled their domestic affairs, preached at them, to them,       for them. He told foolish anecdotes to make them laugh,       encouraged their dancing to make them merry, got up theatrical       performances to distract their minds, and made them work hard,       certain of rendering them contented by-and-by. Feared with a       stronger fear, venerated with a more rational veneration, but       not loved with the same clinging tenderness that the people       still felt for Joseph Smith, Brigham swayed them at his will.       They learned to dread his iron hand, and were daunted by his       iron heart.\"[10:A]    While he was thus consolidating his power, laying plans for the  foundation of a monarchy more despotic than that of Austria, important  changes were going on in the political condition of the country. Mexico  was conquered, and much of its territory, including Utah, was annexed to  the United States, and the Mormons thus again brought within the  jurisdiction of the Federal Government.    From this era in Mormon affairs Brigham appears in so many different  characters that his history can only be fully written by considering him  in his various _roles_,--as \"Governor of Utah and Superintendent of  Indian Affairs;\" \"President of the Church, Prophet, Seer, and  Revelator;\" \"Trustee in Trust for the Church;\" \"President of the  Emigration Company;\" \"Lord of the Harem;\" \"Eloheim, or Head God;\" and  \"Grand Archee of the Order of the Gods.\"      FOOTNOTES:    [10:A] _Mormonism; its Leaders and Designs_, by John Hyde, Jr. New  York: W.

By the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, concluded between the United States  and Mexico in 1848, the country now embraced in the Territory of Utah  was transferred from the jurisdiction of the latter to that of the  former, and on the 9th of September, 1850, Congress passed an Act to  organize the Territory of Utah.    The Mormons arrived in the Salt Lake Valley on the 24th of July, 1847,  while the Territory yet belonged to Mexico. When the peace between the  United States and Mexico was concluded, the Mormons were left without a  government. They took advantage of this opportunity to set up an  independent government.    Early in 1849 they met in convention to frame a constitution for \"the  State of Deseret.\" The following is an abstract of the minutes of that  convention:--    On the 15th of March, 1849, the convention appointed the following  persons a committee to draft a constitution for the State of Deseret, to  wit: Albert Carrington, Joseph L. Heywood, William W. Phelps, David  Fullmer, John S. Fullmer, Charles C. Rich, John Taylor, Parley P. Pratt,  John M. Bernheisel, and Erastus Snow.    March 18, 1849, Albert Carrington, chairman of the committee, reported  the following constitution, which was read, and unanimously adopted by  the convention: [The preamble only is here given.]           \"CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF DESERET.         \"Whereas a large number of the citizens of the United States,       before and since the treaty of peace with the Republic of       Mexico, emigrated to and settled in that portion of the       territory of the United States lying west of the Rocky       Mountains, and in the great interior basin of Upper       California; and whereas, by reason of said treaty, all civil       organization originating from the Republic of Mexico became       abrogated; and whereas the Congress of the United States has       failed to provide a form of civil government for the territory       so acquired, or any portion thereof; and whereas civil       government and law are necessary for the security, peace, and       prosperity of society; and whereas it is a fundamental       principle in all republican governments that all political       power is inherent in the people, and governments instituted       for their protection, security, and benefit, should emanate       from the same:         \"Therefore your committee beg leave to recommend the adoption       of the following _Constitution_, until the Congress of the       United States shall otherwise provide for the government of       the Territory hereinafter named and described, by admitting us       into the Union.         \"We, the people, grateful to the Supreme Being for the       blessings hitherto enjoyed, and feeling our dependence on Him       for a continuance of those blessings, _do ordain and establish       a free and Independent Government_, by the name of _the State       of Deseret_; including all the territory of the United States       within the following boundaries, to wit:\" [Here follow the       boundaries of the proposed new State.]    It will be noticed by the phraseology of the foregoing preamble that  this government was to be \"free and independent,\" and was intended to  remain such until the new State, thus constituted, _should be admitted  into the Union_. In other words, they intended, through the machinery of  this independent State, to harass and annoy the government, and the  gentiles, until the \"saints\" could force themselves into the Union upon  their own terms. This theory is fully sustained by the subsequent  history of this inchoate State. The very first steps taken were  independent of, and in hostility to, the officers appointed by the  Government of the United States, as will more fully appear in the  following pages.    The formation of this government for the State of Deseret was the first  effort to throw off the yoke of the Federal Government,--an effort which  has been persistently persevered in to the present time.    There never has been a time since Brigham Young crossed the Rocky  Mountains, when he has honestly entertained the idea of being a good and  loyal citizen of the United States.    The following were the first officers of this infant monarchy:--         Governor, BRIGHAM YOUNG.       Lieutenant-Governor, HEBER C. KIMBALL.       Chief Justice, DANIEL H. WELLS.    The Assembly met, and after listening to the Governor's Message,  proceeded to frame a code of laws. This _pseudo_ State government  remained in force until the 22d of September, 1851, when the Territorial  Legislature convened.    In the mean time Brigham, having been appointed Governor of the newly  organized Territory, and Superintendent of Indian Affairs, and seeing a  fair prospect of lining his pockets from the treasury of the United  States, concluded to forego for a time his ambitious projects, and  consented that the new \"State\" should be merged into a United States  Territory.    The federal officers were appointed during the session of 1850-51, but  owing to the difficulty of transportation, did not arrive until July,  1851. Young, who had been appointed Governor, had, on the 3d of  February, 1851, taken the oath of office before Wells, _Chief Justice of  Deseret_.    The first session of the Territorial Legislature was convened, in  pursuance of the proclamation of the Governor, on the 22d day of  September, 1851, and continued by adjournment from time to time, until  the 18th day of February, 1852. This was succeeded by a special session,  called by proclamation of the Governor, commencing the following day,  and continuing until the 6th day of March, 1852. What there was in the  political condition of this community, subjected as they were, in almost  all the relations of life, to a complete and comprehensive system of  religious government, to require a continuous session of the Territorial  Legislature for nearly six months, has never yet been explained.    The following is extracted from the published proceedings of the first  Legislative Assembly:--         \"REPRESENTATIVES' HALL, Tuesday, Sept 23, 1852.         \"10 o'clock, A. M. Both houses of the Legislative Assembly met       in joint session, according to previous arrangement. The       President of the Council in the chair.         \"The committee appointed to that duty appeared, escorting his       Excellency Brigham Young, Governor of Utah Territory, who was       seated immediately in front of the Speaker's chair.         \"The joint committee appointed to wait upon the Judges of the       Supreme Court, and the Secretary of the Territory, appeared,       escorting the Hon. Z. Snow [Mormon], one of said Judges. They       reported that they had visited the Hon. Perry E. Brochus, and       Mr. Secretary Harris. But the answer returned by them was so       vague and indefinite that they did not know whether they would       respond to the invitation or not. The committee also reported       that they did not see the Hon. Judge Brandenburg. The United       States District Attorney, Seth M. Blair, Esq., [Mormon,] was       also seated within the bar.\"    The hostility to the federal officers had already been so openly and  offensively manifested, that the respect which these gentlemen owed to  themselves and the government and people whom they represented, would  not permit them to be present at the first meeting of the Legislative  Assembly. It will be noticed that one of them was not seen at all, and  the reply of the other two was not even reported!         \"The House was called to order by the President of the       Council, who then informed his Excellency the Governor, that       the two Houses were now ready to receive any communication he       might be"]]]
