[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5767"],[0,"The Fireside Chats of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (#4)"],[1,"  We have built a  granite foundation in a period of confusion.  That foundation of the  federal credit stands there broad and sure.  It is the base of the  whole recovery plan.    Then came the part of the problem that concerned the credit of the  individual citizens themselves.  You and I know of the banking  crisis and of the great danger to the savings of our people.  On  March sixth every national bank was closed.  One month later 90  percent of the deposits in the national banks had been made  available to the depositors.  Today only about 5 percent of the  deposits in national banks are still tied up.  The condition  relating to state banks, while not quite so good on a percentage  basis, is showing a steady reduction in the total of frozen  deposits--a result much better than we had expected three months  ago.    The problem of the credit of the individual was made more difficult  because of another fact.  The dollar was a different dollar from the  one with which the average debt had been incurred.  For this reason  large numbers of people were actually losing possession of and  title to their farms and homes.  All of you know the financial steps  which have been taken to correct this inequality.  In addition the  Home Loan Act, the Farm Loan Act and the Bankruptcy Act were  passed.    It was a vital necessity to restore purchasing power by reducing  the debt and interest charges upon our people, but while we were  helping people to save their credit it was at the same time  absolutely essential to do something about the physical needs of  hundreds of thousands who were in dire straits at that very moment.  Municipal and state aid were being stretched to the limit.  We  appropriated half a billion dollars to supplement their efforts and  in addition, as you know, we have put 300,000 young men into  practical and useful work in our forests and to prevent flood and  soil erosion.  The wages they earn are going in greater part to the  support of the nearly one million people who constitute their  families.    In this same classification we can properly place the great public  works program running to a total of over three billion dollars--to  be used for highways and ships and flood prevention and inland  navigation and thousands of self-sustaining state and municipal  improvements.  Two points should be made clear in the allotting and  administration of these projects--first, we are using the utmost  care to choose labor-creating, quick-acting, useful projects,  avoiding the smell of the pork barrel; and secondly, we are hoping  that at least half of the money will come back to the government  from projects which will pay for themselves over a period of years.    Thus far I have spoken primarily of the foundation stones--the  measures that were necessary to reestablish credit and to head  people in the opposite direction by preventing distress and  providing as much work as possible through governmental agencies.  Now I come to the links which will build us a more lasting  prosperity.  I have said that we cannot attain that in a nation half  boom and half broke.  If all of our people have work and fair wages  and fair profits, they can buy the products of their neighbors and  business is good.  But if you take away the wages and the profits of  half of them, business is only half as good.  It doesn't help much  if the fortunate half is very prosperous--the best way is for  everybody to be reasonably prosperous.    For many years the two great barriers to a normal prosperity have  been low farm prices and the creeping paralysis of unemployment.  These factors have cut the purchasing power of the country in half.  I promised action.  Congress did its part when it passed the Farm  and the Industrial Recovery Acts.  Today we are putting these two  acts to work and they will work if people understand their plain  objectives.    First the Farm Act:  It is based on the fact that the purchasing  power of nearly half our population depends on adequate prices for  farm products.  We have been producing more of some crops than we  consume or can sell in a depressed world market.  The cure is not to  produce so much.  Without our help the farmers cannot get together  and cut production, and the Farm Bill gives them a method of  bringing their production down to a reasonable level and of  obtaining reasonable prices for their crops.  I have clearly stated  that this method is in a sense experimental, but so far as we have  gone we have reason to believe that it will produce good results.    It is obvious that if we can greatly increase the purchasing power  of the tens of millions of our people who make a living from  farming and the distribution of farm crops, we will greatly  increase the consumption of those goods which are turned out by  industry.    That brings me to the final step--bringing back industry along  sound lines.    Last Autumn, on several occasions, I expressed my faith that we can  make possible by democratic self-discipline in industry general  increases in wages and shortening of hours sufficient to enable  industry to pay its own workers enough to let those workers buy and  use the things that their labor produces.  This can be done only if  we permit and encourage cooperative action in industry because it  is obvious that without united action a few selfish men in each  competitive group will pay starvation wages and insist on long  hours of work.  Others in that group must either follow suit or  close up shop.  We have seen the result of action of that kind in  the continuing descent into the economic Hell of the past four  years.    There is a clear way to reverse that process:  If all employers in  each competitive group agree to pay their workers the same wages--  reasonable wages--and require the same hours--reasonable hours--  then higher wages and shorter hours will hurt no employer.  Moreover, such action is better for the employer than unemployment  and low wages, because it makes more buyers for his product.  That  is the simple idea which is the very heart of the Industrial  Recovery Act.    On the basis of this simple principle of everybody doing things  together, we are starting out on this nationwide attack on  unemployment.  It will succeed if our people understand it--in the  big industries, in the little shops, in the great cities and in the  small villages.  There is nothing complicated about it and there is  nothing particularly new in the principle.  It goes back to the  basic idea of society and of the nation itself that people acting  in a group can accomplish things which no individual acting alone  could even hope to bring about.    Here is an example.  In the Cotton Textile Code and in other  agreements already signed, child labor has been abolished.  That  makes me personally happier than any other one thing with which I  have been connected since I came to Washington.  In the textile  industry--an industry which came to me spontaneously and with a  splendid cooperation as soon as the recovery act was signed--child  labor was an old evil.  But no employer acting alone was able to  wipe it out.  If one employer tried it, or if one state tried it,  the costs of operation rose so high that it was impossible to  compete with the employers or states which had failed to act.  The  moment the Recovery Act was passed, this monstrous thing which  neither opinion nor law could reach through years of effort went  out in a flash.  As a British editorial put it, we did more under a  Code in one day than they in England had been able to do under the  common law in eighty-five years of effort.  I use this incident, my  friends, not to boast of what has already been done but to point  the way to you for even greater cooperative efforts this summer and  autumn.    We are not going through another winter like the last.  I doubt if  ever any people so bravely and cheerfully endured a season half so  bitter.  We cannot ask America to continue to face such needless  hardships.  It is time for courageous action, and the Recovery Bill  gives us the means to conquer unemployment with exactly the same  weapon that we have used to strike down child labor.    The proposition is simply this:    If all employers will act together to shorten hours and raise wages  we can put people back to work.  No employer will suffer, because  the relative level of competitive cost will advance by the same  amount for all.  But if any considerable group should lag or shirk,  this great opportunity will pass us by and we will go into another  desperate winter.  This must not happen.    We have sent out to all employers an agreement which is the result  of weeks of consultation.  This agreement checks against the  voluntary codes of nearly all the large industries which have  already been submitted.  This blanket agreement carries the  unanimous approval of the three boards which I have appointed to  advise in this, boards representing the great leaders in labor, in  industry and in social service.  The agreement has already brought a  flood of approval from every state, and from so wide a cross-  section of the common calling of industry that I know it is fair  for all.  It is a plan--deliberate, reasonable and just--intended to  put into effect at once the most important of the broad principles  which are being established, industry by industry, through codes.  Naturally, it takes a good deal of organizing and a great many  hearings and many months, to get these codes perfected and signed,  and we cannot wait for all of them to go through.  The blanket  agreements, however, which I am sending to every employer will  start the wheels turning now, and not six months from now.    There are, of course, men, a few of them who might thwart this  great common purpose by seeking selfish advantage.  There are  adequate penalties in the law, but I am now asking the cooperation  that comes from opinion and from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5770"],[0,"The Rover Boys in the Jungle; Or, Stirring Adventures in Africa (#4)"],[1,"Tom Rover.  \"He  must be almost exhausted to row like that.\"    \"He knows what he has at stake.  He sees the prison cell staring  him in the face again.  You'd do your best, too, if you were in  his place.\"    \"I'm doing my best now, Dick.  On we go!\" and Tom renewed his  exertions.  Dick set a faster stroke than ever, having caught his  second wind, and the rowboat flew over the calm surface of the  lake like a thing of life.    \"Keep off!\"  The cry came from Baxter, while he was still a  hundred yards from the eastern shore.  \"Keep off, or it will be  the worse for you!\"    \"We are not afraid of you, Baxter, and you ought to know it by  this time,\" answered Dick.  \"You may as well give in now as later  on.\"    \"Give in!  You must be crazy!\"    \"We are two to one, and you know what we have been able to do in  the past.\"    \"Humph!  I don't intend to go to jug again, and that is all there  is to it.\"    \"Maybe you can't help yourself.\"    \"We'll see about that.  Are you--going to keep off or not?    \"Don't ask foolish a question.\"    \"You won't keep off?\"    \"No.\"    \"If you don't I--I'll shoot you.\"    As Dan Baxter spoke he stopped rowing and brought from a hip  pocket a highly polished nickel-plated revolver.    \"Do you see this?\" he demanded, as he pointed the weapon toward  the Rover boys.    Both Dick and Tom were taken aback at the sight of the weapon.  But they had seen such arms before, and had faced them,  consequently they were not as greatly alarmed as they right  otherwise have been.  They knew, too, that Dan Baxter was a  notoriously bad shot.    \"Put that up, Baxter,\" said Dick calmly.  \"It may only get you  into deeper trouble.\"    \"I don't care!\" said the bully recklessly.  \"I'm not going back to  jail and that is all there, is to it!\"    \"You won't dare to shoot at us, and you know it,\" put in Tom, as  the two boats drifted closer together.    \"I will, and don't you fool yourself on it.\"    \"Drop those oars or I'll fire, as sure as my name is Dan Baxter,\"  and the revolver, which had been partly lowered, was raised a  second time.    It must be confessed that Dick and Tom were much disconcerted.  The two rowboats were now less than fifty feet apart, and any kind  of a shot from the weapon was likely to prove more or less  dangerous.  Baxter's eyes gleamed with the hatred of an angry  snake ready to strike.    \"You think you are smart, you Rover boys,\" said the bully, after  an awkward pause all around.  \"You think you did a big thing in  rescuing Dora Stanhope and in putting me and my father and Buddy  Girk in prison.  But let me tell you that this game hasn't come to  an end yet, and some day we intend to square accounts.\"    \"There is no use in wasting breath in this fashion, Baxter,\"  returned Dick, as calmly as he could.  \"We are two to one, and the  best thing to do is for you to submit.  If you fire on us, we may  do a little shooting on our own account.\"    \"Humph!  Do you imagine you can scare me in that fashion?  You  haven't any pistol, and I know it.  If you had you would have  drawn the weapon long ago.\"    At this Dick bit his lip.  \"Don't be too sure,\" he said steadily,  as the boats drifted still closer together.  \"The minute I heard  you had escaped from jail I went and bought a pistol in  Cedarville.\"  This was the strict truth, but Dick did not add that  the weapon lay at that moment safe in the bottom of his trunk at  the Hall.    \"Got afraid I'd come around, eh?\"    \"I knew there was nothing like becoming prepared.  Now will you--\"    Dick did not have time to finish, for, lowering the front end of  the pistol, Dan Baxter pulled the trigger twice and two reports  rang out in quick succession.  One bullet buried itself in the  seat beside Tom, while the second plowed its way through the  bottom, near the stern.    \"You villain!\" cried Dick, and in his excitement hurled his oar at  Dan Baxter, hitting the fellow across the fact with such force  that the bully's nose began to bleed.  The shock made Baxter lose  his hold on the pistol and it went over the side of his craft and  sank immediately to the bottom of the lake.    \"My, but that was a close shave!\" muttered Tom, as he gazed at the  hole through the seat.  \"A little closer and I would have got it  in the stomach.\"    A yell now came from Sam, and a shriek from the girls, all of whom  had heard the pistol shots.  They were too far away to see the  result of the shooting and feared both Tom and Dick had been  killed or wounded.    As quickly as he could recover from the blow of the oar, Dan  Baxter picked up his own blades, and without paying attention to  the blood which was flowing from his nose, began once again to  pull for the shore.    \"Come on, his pistol is gone!\" shouted Dick, and then his face  fell. \"Confound it, I've thrown away my oar!  There it goes!\"  And  he pointed some distance to their left.    \"That isn't the worst of it!\" groaned Tom. \"Look at that hole in  the bottom, made by that pistol shot.  The water is coming in just  as fast as it can.\"    There was small need to call attention to it, for the water in the  bottom of the boat was already an inch deep.  Dick started in  perplexity, then, struck by a sudden idea, drew a lead pencil from  his pocket and rammed it into the opening.  It fitted very well,  and the water ceased, to come in.    \"Now we'll have to bail out and pick up that other oar,\" said Tom.  \"It was foolish to throw it away, Dick.\"    \"I don't know about that.  It deprived Baxter of his pistol.  Paddle over, and I'll pick it up.\"  Tom did so, and the blade was  speedily recovered.    But Dan Baxter had made good use of the precious moments lost by  the Rover boys, and hardly were the latter into shape for rowing  once more than they saw the bully beach his craft and leap out on  the shore.  \"Good-by to you!\" he cried mockingly.  \"I told you  that you couldn't catch me.  The next time we meet I'll make you  sorry that you ever followed me,\" and he started to run off with  all possible speed.    Tom and Dick were too chagrined to answer him, and pulled forward  to the shore in silence.  They ran the craft into some bushes and  tied up, and then started after Baxter, who was now making for the  woods south of the village of Nelson.    When the highway skirting this portion of Cayuga Lake was gained  Dan Baxter was a good five hundred feet ahead of them.  A turn in  the road soon hid him from view.  Gaining the bend they discovered  that he had disappeared from view altogether.    \"He has taken to the woods,\" sighed Dick.    \"If that is so we may as well give the hunt up,\" answered his  brother.  \"It would be worse than looking for a pin in a haystack,  for we wouldn't know what direction he had taken.\"    \"I wish I had a bloodhound with which to trail him.  He ought to  be run down, Tom.\"    \"Well, let us notify some of the people living near and see what  can be done.\"    They ran on to the spot where they supposed Baxter had left the  highway.  On both sides were dense thickets of cedars with heavy  underbrush.  All in all, the locality formed an ideal hiding  place.    Night was coming on by the time they gained the nearest farmhouse.  Here they found three men, to whom they explained the situation.  All of the men smiled grimly.    \"If he went into the woods it would be a hard job to trail him,\"  was the comment from Farmer Mason.  \"If he ain't careful he'll  lose himself so completely he'll never git out, b'gosh!\"    \"Well, I don't know but what that would suit me,\" responded Tom  dryly.    The search was begun, and several others joined in.  It lasted  until night was fairly upon the party and was then given up in  disgust.    \"It's no use,\" said Dick.  \"He has slipped us!\"    \"But we ought to notify the authorities,\" said Tom.  \"They will  probably put a detective on his track.\"    \"Yes; but a detective can't do any more than we can, up in this  wild locality.\"    \"He won't remain in the woods forever.  He'll starve to death.\"    \"Well, we can send the police a telegram from Cedarville.\"    This was done, and the Rover boys returned to Putnam Hall by way  of the side road leaving past the homes of the Stanhopes and the  Lanings.  They found Sam and the girls very anxious concerning  their welfare.    \"We were afraid you had been shot,\" said Dora.  \"I am thankful  that you escaped.\"    \"So am I,\" put in Sam.  \"But it's too bad that Baxter got away.  I  wonder where he will turn up next.\"    They all wondered, but could not even venture an answer.  Soon the  boys left the girls and hurried to the academy, where their story,  had to be told over again.  Captain Putnam looked exceedingly  grave over the narrative.    \"You must be careful in the future, lads,\" he said.  \"Remember,  you are in my care here.  I do not know what your uncle would say  if anything should happen to you.\"    \"We will be on our guard in the future,\" answered Dick.  \"But I am  awfully sorry we didn't catch him.\"    \"So am I.  But perhaps the authorities will have better luck,\" and  there the talk came to an end, and the boys retired for the night.          CHAPTER V    FUN AND AN EXPLOSION      Several days slipped by, and the boys waited anxiously for some  news from the authorities.  But none came, and they rightfully  surmised that, for the time being, Dan Baxter had made good his  escape.    On account of the disastrous ending to the kite-flying match, many  had supposed that the feast in Dormitory No. 6 was not to come  off, but Sam, Tom, Frank, and several others got their heads  together and prepared for a \"layout\" for the following Wednesday,  which would be Dick's birthday.    \"We'll give him a surprise,\" said Sam, and so it was agreed.  Passing around the hat netted exactly three dollars and a quarter,  and Tom, Sam, and Fred Garrison were delegated to purchase the  candies, cake, and ice cream which were to constitute the spread.    \"We'll do the thing up brown,\" said Sam.    \"We must strike"]]]
