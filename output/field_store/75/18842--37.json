So the  robbers are now warned that an enemy is in their cave, and they will  soon arrive to make you a prisoner, even as I am.\"    \"Ah, I see!\" said the prince, with a laugh, \"It is a rather clever  contrivance; but having been warned in time I should indeed be foolish  to be caught in such a trap.\"    With this he half drew his sword, but thinking that robbers were not  worthy to be slain with its untarnished steel, he pushed it back into  the jeweled scabbard and looked around for another weapon.  A stout  oaken staff lay upon the ground, and this he caught up and ran with it  from the cave, placing himself just beside the narrow opening that led  into this rock-encompassed plain.  For he quickly saw that this was the  only way any one could enter or leave the place, and therefore knew the  robbers were coming up the narrow gorge even as he had himself done.    Soon they were heard stumbling along at a rapid pace, crying to one  another to make haste and catch the intruder.  The first that came  through the opening received so sharp a blow upon the head from Prince  Marvel's oak staff that he fell to the ground and lay still, while the  next was treated in a like manner and fell beside his comrade.    Perhaps the thieves had not expected so sturdy an enemy, for they  continued to rush through the opening in the rocks and to fall beneath  the steady blows of the prince's staff until every one of them lay  senseless before the victor.  At first they had piled themselves upon  one another very neatly; but the pile got so high at last that the  prince was obliged to assist the last thieves to leap to the top of the  heap before they completely lost their senses.    I have no doubt our prince, feeling himself yet strange in the new form  he had acquired, and freshly transported from the forest glades in  which he had always lived, was fully as much astonished at his deed of  valor as were the robbers themselves; and if he shuddered a little when  looking upon the heap of senseless thieves you must forgive him this  weakness.  For he straightway resolved to steel his heart to such  sights and to be every bit as stern and severe as a mortal knight would  have been.    Throwing down his staff he ran to the cave again, and stepping between  the sword points he approached the pile of casks and held out his arms  to the boy who was perched upon the top.    \"The thieves are conquered,\" he cried.  \"Jump down!\"    \"I won't,\" said the boy.    \"Why not?\" inquired the prince.    \"Can't you see I'm very miserable?\" asked the boy, in return; \"don't  you understand that every minute I expect to fall upon those sword  points?\"    \"But I will catch you,\" cried the prince.    \"I don't want you to catch me,\" said the boy.  \"I want to be miserable.  It's the first chance I've ever had, and I'm enjoying my misery very  much.\"    This speech so astonished Prince Marvel that for a moment he stood  motionless.  Then he retorted, angrily:    \"You're a fool!\"    \"If I wasn't so miserable up here, I'd come down and thrash you for  that,\" said the boy, with a sigh.    This answer so greatly annoyed Prince Marvel that he gave the central  cask of the pyramid a sudden push, and the next moment the casks were  tumbling in every direction, while the boy fell headlong in their midst.    But Marvel caught him deftly in his arms, and so saved him from the  sword points.    \"There!\" he said, standing the boy upon his feet; \"now you are released  from your misery.\"    \"And I should be glad to punish you for your interference,\" declared  the boy, gloomily eying his preserver, \"had you not saved my life by  catching me.  According to the code of honor of knighthood I can not  harm one who has saved my life until I have returned the obligation.  Therefore, for the present I shall pardon your insulting speeches and  actions.\"    \"But you have also saved my life,\" answered Prince Marvel; \"for had you  not warned me of the robbers' return they would surely have caught me.\"    \"True,\" said the boy, brightening up; \"therefore our score is now even.  But take care not to affront me again, for hereafter I will show you no  mercy!\"    Prince Marvel looked at the boy with wonder.  He was about his own  size, yet strong and well formed, and he would have been handsome  except for the expression of discontent upon his face.  Yet his manner  and words were so absurd and unnatural that the prince was more amused  than angered by his new acquaintance, and presently laughed in his face.    \"If all the people in this island are like you,\" he said, \"I shall have  lots of fun with them.  And you are only a boy, after all.\"    \"I'm bigger than you!\" declared the other, glaring fiercely at the  prince.    \"How much bigger?\" asked Marvel, his eyes twinkling.    \"Oh, ever so much!\"    \"Then fetch along that coil of rope, and follow me,\" said Prince Marvel.    \"Fetch the rope yourself!\" retorted the boy, bluntly.  \"I'm not your  servant.\" Then he put his hands in his pockets and coolly walked out of  the cave to look at the pile of senseless robbers.    Prince Marvel made no reply, but taking the coil of rope on his  shoulder he carried it to where the thieves lay and threw it down  beside them.  Then he cut lengths from the coil with his sword and  bound the limbs of each robber securely.  Within a half-hour he had  laid out a row of thieves extending half way across the grassy plain,  and on counting their number he found he had captured fifty-nine of  them.    This task being accomplished and the robbers rendered helpless, Prince  Marvel turned to the boy who stood watching him.    \"Get a suit of armor from the cave, and a strong sword, and then return  here,\" he said, in a stern voice.    \"Why should I do that?\" asked the boy, rather impudently.    \"Because I am going to fight you for disobeying my orders; and if you  do not protect yourself I shall probably kill you.\"    \"That sounds pleasant,\" said the boy.  \"But if you should prove my  superior in skill I beg you will not kill me at once, but let me die a  lingering death.\"    \"Why?\" asked the prince.    \"Because I shall suffer more, and that will be delightful.\"    \"I am not anxious to kill you, nor to make you suffer,\" said Marvel,  \"all that I ask is that you acknowledge me your master.\"    \"I won't!\" answered the boy.  \"I acknowledge no master in all the  world!\"    \"Then you must fight,\" declared the prince, gravely.  \"If you win, I  will promise to serve you faithfully; and if I conquer you, then you  must acknowledge me your master, and obey my commands.\"    \"Agreed!\" cried the boy, with sudden energy, and he rushed into the  cave and soon returned clad in armor and bearing a sword and shield.  On the shield was pictured a bolt of lightning.    \"Lightning will soon strike those three girls whose champion you seem  to be,\" he said tauntingly.    \"The three girls defy your lightning!\" returned the prince with a  smile.  \"I see you are brave enough.\"    \"Brave!  Why should I not be?\" answered the boy proudly.  \"I am the  Lord Nerle, the son of Neggar, the chief baron of Heg!\"    The other bowed low.    \"I am pleased to know your station,\" he said.  \"I am called Prince  Marvel, and this is my first adventure.\"    \"And likely to be your last,\" exclaimed the boy, sneeringly.  \"For I am  stronger than you, and I have fought many times with full grown men.\"    \"Are you ready?\" asked Prince Marvel, for answer.    \"Yes.\"    Then the swords clashed and sparks flew from the blades.  But it was  not for long.  Suddenly Nerle's sword went flying through the air and  shattered its blade against a wall of rock.  He scowled at Prince  Marvel a moment, who smiled back at him.  Then the boy rushed into the  cave and returned with another sword.    Scarcely had the weapons crossed again when with a sudden blow Prince  Marvel snapped Nerle's blade in two, and followed this up with a sharp  slap upon his ear with the flat of his own sword that fairly bewildered  the boy, and made him sit down on the grass to think what had happened  to him.    Then Prince Marvel's merry laugh rang far across the hills, and so  delighted was he at the astonished expression upon Nerle's face that it  was many minutes before he could control his merriment and ask his  foeman if he had had enough fight.    \"I suppose I have,\" replied the boy, rubbing his ear tenderly.  \"That  blow stings most deliciously.  But it is a hard thought that the son of  Baron Neggar should serve Prince Marvel!\"    \"Do not worry about that,\" said the prince; \"for I assure you my rank  is so far above your own that it is no degradation for the son of  Neggar to serve me.  But come, we must dispose of these thieves.  What  is the proper fate for such men?\"    \"They are always hanged,\" answered Nerle, getting upon his feet.    \"Well, there are trees handy,\" remarked the prince, although his  girlish heart insisted on making him shiver in spite of his resolve to  be manly and stern.  \"Let us get to work and hang them as soon as  possible.  And then we can proceed upon our journey.\"    Nerle now willingly lent his assistance to his new master, and soon  they had placed a rope around the neck of each thief and were ready to  dangle them all from the limbs of the trees.    But at this juncture the thieves began to regain consciousness, and now  Wul-Takim, the big, red-bearded king of the thieves, sat up and asked:    \"Who is our conqueror?\"    \"Prince Marvel,\" answered Nerle.    \"And what army assisted him?\" inquired Wul-Takim, curiously gazing upon  the prince.    \"He conquered you alone and single-handed,\" said Nerle.

CIPA's Amendments to the E-rate Program      Section 1721(b) of CIPA imposes conditions on a library's  participation in the E-rate program.  A library \"having one or  more computers with Internet access may not receive services at  discount rates,\" CIPA Sec. 1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. Sec.  254(h)(6)(A)(i)), unless the library certifies that it is  \"enforcing a policy of Internet safety that includes the  operation of a technology protection measure with respect to any  of its computers with Internet access that protects against  access through such computers to visual depictions that are  (I)  obscene; (II) child pornography; or (III) harmful to minors,\" and  that it is \"enforcing the operation of such technology protection  measure during any use of such computers by minors.\"  CIPA Sec.  1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. Sec. 254(h)(6)(B)).   CIPA defines a  \"technology protection measure\" as \"a specific technology that  blocks or filters access to visual depictions that are obscene, .  . . child pornography, . . . or harmful to minors.\"  CIPA Sec.  1703(b)(1) (codified at 47 U.S.C. Sec. 254(h)(7)(I)).      To receive E-rate discounts, a library must also certify  that filtering software is in operation during adult use of the  Internet.  More specifically, with respect to adults, a library  must certify that it is \"enforcing a policy of Internet safety  that includes the operation of a technology protection measure  with respect to any of its computers with Internet access that  protects against access through such computers to visual  depictions that are  (I) obscene; or (II) child pornography,\"  and that it is \"enforcing the operation of such technology  protection measure during any use of such computers.\"  CIPA Sec.  1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. Sec. 254(h)(6)(C)).  Interpreting the  statutory terms \"any use,\" the FCC has concluded that \"CIPA makes  no distinction between computers used only by staff and those  accessible to the public.\"  In re Federal-State Joint Board on  Universal Service: Children's Internet Protection Act, CC Docket  No. 96-45, Report and Order, FCC 01-120,  30 (Apr. 5, 2001).  With respect to libraries receiving E-rate discounts, CIPA  further specifies that \"[a]n administrator, supervisor, or other  person authorized by the certifying authority . . . may disable  the technology protection measure concerned, during use by an  adult, to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful  purpose.\"  CIPA Sec.1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. Sec. 254(h)(6)(D)).  2.        CIPA's Amendments to the LSTA Program  Section 1712 of CIPA amends the Museum and Library Services  Act (20 U.S.C. Sec. 9134(f)) to provide that no funds made available  under the Act \"may be used to purchase computers used to access  the Internet, or to pay for direct costs associated with  accessing the Internet,\" unless such library \"has in place\" and  is enforcing \"a policy of Internet safety that includes the  operation of a technology protection measure with respect to any  of its computers with Internet access that protects against  access through such computers to visual depictions\" that are  \"obscene\" or \"child pornography,\" and, when the computers are in  use by minors, also protects against access to visual depictions  that are \"harmful to minors.\"  CIPA Sec. 1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C.  Sec. 9134(f)(1)).  Section 1712 contains definitions of \"technology  protection measure,\" \"obscene,\" \"child pornography,\" and \"harmful  to minors,\" that are substantially similar to those found in the  provisions governing the E-rate program.  CIPA Sec. 1712 (codified  at 20 U.S.C. Sec. 9134(f)(7)); see also supra note 2.      As under the E-rate program, \"an administrator, supervisor  or other authority may disable a technology protection measure .  . . to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful  purposes.\"  CIPA Sec. 1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C. Sec. 9134(f)(3)).  Whereas CIPA's amendments to the E-rate program permit disabling  for bona fide research or other lawful purposes only during adult  use, the LSTA provision permits disabling for both adults and  minors.  2.        Identity of the Plaintiffs  1.        Library and Library Association Plaintiffs  Plaintiffs American Library Association, Alaska Library  Association, California Library Association, Connecticut Library  Association, Freedom to Read Foundation, Maine Library  Association, New England Library Association, New York Library  Association, and Wisconsin Library Association are non-profit  organizations whose members include public libraries that receive  either E-rate discounts or LSTA funds for the provision of  Internet access.  Because it is a prerequisite to associational  standing, we note that the interests that these organizations  seek to protect in this litigation are central to their raison  d'être.      Plaintiffs Fort Vancouver Regional Library District, in  southwest Washington state; Multnomah County Public Library, in  Multnomah County, Oregon; Norfolk Public Library System, in  Norfolk, Virginia; Santa Cruz Public Library Joint Powers  Authority, in Santa Cruz, California; South Central Library  System (\"SCLS\"), centered in Madison, Wisconsin; and the  Westchester Library System, in Westchester County, New York, are  public library systems with branch offices in their respective  localities that provide Internet access to their patrons.  The Fort Vancouver Regional Library District, for over three  years from 1999-2001, received $135,000 in LSTA grants and  $19,500 in E-rate discounts for Internet access.  The Multnomah  County Public Library received $70,000 in E-rate discounts for  Internet access this year, and has applied for $100,000 in E-rate  discounts for the upcoming year.  The Norfolk Public Library  System received $90,000 in E-rate discounts for Internet access  this year, and has received a $200,000 LSTA grant to put computer  labs in eight of its libraries.  The Santa Cruz Public Library  Joint Powers Authority received $20,560 in E-rate discounts for  Internet access in 2001-02.  The SCLS received between $3,000 and  $5,000 this year in E-rate discounts for Internet access.  The Fort Vancouver Regional Library District Board is a  public board whose members are appointed by elected county  commissioners.  The Multnomah County Library is a county  department, whose board is appointed by the county chair and  confirmed by the other commissioners.  The SCLS is an aggregation  of 51 independently governed statutory member public libraries,  whose relationship to SCLS is defined by state law.  The  governing body of the SCLS is the Library Board of Trustees,  which consists of 20 members nominated by county executives and  ratified by county boards of supervisors.  2.        Patron and Patron Association Plaintiffs      Plaintiffs Association of Community Organizations for Reform  Now, Friends of the Philadelphia City Institute Library, and the  Pennsylvania Alliance for Democracy are nonprofit organizations  whose members include individuals who access the Internet at  public libraries that receive E-rate discounts or LSTA funds for  the provision of public Internet access.  We note for the purpose  of associational standing that the interests that these  organizations seek to protect in this litigation are germane to  their purposes.  Plaintiffs Emmalyn Rood, Mark Brown, Elizabeth Hrenda, C.  Donald Weinberg, Sherron Dixon, by her father and next friend  Gordon Dixon, James Geringer, Marnique Tynesha Overby, by her  next friend Carolyn C. Williams, William J. Rosenbaum, Carolyn C.  Williams, and Quiana Williams, by her mother and next friend  Sharon Bernard, are adults and minors who use the Internet at  public libraries that, to the best of their knowledge, do not  filter patrons' access to the Internet.  Several of these  plaintiffs do not have Internet access from home.  Emmalyn Rood is a sixteen-year-old who uses the Multnomah  County Public Library.  When she was 13, she used the Internet at  the Multnomah County Public Library to research issues relating  to her sexual identity.  Ms. Rood did not use her home or school  computer for this research, in part because she wished her  searching to be private.  Although the library offered patrons  the option of using filtering software, Ms. Rood did not use that  option because she had had previous experience with such programs  blocking information that was valuable to her, including  information relating to gay and lesbian issues.      Plaintiff Mark Brown used the Internet at the Philadelphia  Free Library to research breast cancer and reconstructive surgery  for his mother who had breast surgery.  Mr. Brown's research at  the library provided him and his mother with essential  information about his mother's medical condition and potential  treatments.  3.        Web Publisher Plaintiffs  Plaintiff Afraid to Ask, Inc., based in Saunderstown, Rhode  Island, publishes a health education Web site,  www.AfraidtoAsk.com.
