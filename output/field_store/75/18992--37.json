There are 84 locks on the main  line. These locks, originally 90 feet in length and 15 in breadth, and  with an average lift of 8 feet 2 inches, have since been much enlarged.  The total rise and fall is 692 feet. The towpath is elevated 4 feet  above the level of the water, and is 10 feet in breadth. At Lockport the  canal descends 60 feet by means of 5 locks excavated in solid rock, and  afterward proceeds on a uniform level for a distance of 63 miles to the  Genesee River, over which it is carried on an aqueduct having 9 arches  of 50 feet span each. Eight and a half miles from this point it passes  over the Cayuga marsh, on an embankment 2 miles in length, and in some  places 70 feet in height. At Syracuse, the \"long level\" commences, which  extends for a distance of 691/2 miles to Frankfort, without an intervening  lock. After leaving Frankfort, the canal crosses the river Mohawk, first  by an aqueduct 748 feet in length, supported on 16 piers, elevated 25  feet above the surface of the river, and afterward by another aqueduct  1,188 feet in length, and emerges into the Hudson at Albany.    This great work was finished in 1825, and its completion was the  occasion of great public rejoicing. The same year that the Erie Canal  was begun, ground was broken for a canal from Lake Champlain to the  Hudson, sixty-three miles in length. This work was completed in 1823.    The construction of these two water ways was attended with the most  interesting consequences. Even before they were completed their value  had become clearly apparent. Boats were placed upon the Erie Canal as  fast as the different levels were ready for use, and set to work in  active transportation. They were small affairs compared with those of  the present day, being about 50 or 60 tons burden, the modern canal boat  being 180 or 200 tons. Small as they were, they reduced the cost of  transportation immediately to one-tenth what it had been before. A ton  of freight by land from Buffalo to Albany cost at that time $100. When  the canal was open its entire length, the cost of freight fell from  fifteen to twenty-five dollars a ton, according to the class of article  carried; and the time of transit from 20 to 8 days, Wheat at that time  was worth only $33 a ton in western New York, and it did not pay to send  it by land to New York. When sent to market at all, it was floated down  the Susquehanna to Baltimore, as being the cheapest and best market.  The canal changed that. It now became possible to send to market a wide  variety of agricultural produce--fruit, grain, vegetables, etc.--which,  before the canal was built, either had no value at all, or which could  be disposed of to no good advantage. It is claimed by the original  promoters of the Erie Canal, who lived to see its beneficial effects  experienced by the people of the country, that their work, costing less  than $8.000,000 and paying its whole cost of construction in a very  few years, added $100,000,000 to the value of the farms of New York by  opening up good and ready markets for their products. The canal had  another result. It made New York city the commercial metropolis of the  country. An old letter, written by a resident of Newport, R. I., in that  age, has lately been discovered, which speaks of New York city, and  says: \"If we do not look out, New York will get ahead of us.\" Newport  was then one of the principal seaports of the country; it had once been  the first. New York city certainly did \"get ahead of us\" after the Erie  Canal was built. It got ahead of every other commercial city on the  coast. Freight, which had previously gone overland from Ohio and the  West to Pittsburg, and thence to Philadelphia, costing $120 a ton  between the two cities named, now went to New York by way of the Hudson  River and the Erie Canal and the lakes. Manufactures and groceries  returned to the West by the same route, and New York became a  flourishing and growing emporium immediately. The Erie Canal was  enlarged in 1835, so as to permit the passage of boats of 100 tons  burden, and the result was a still further reduction of the cost of  freighting, expansion of traffic, and an increase of the general  benefits conferred by the canal. The Champlain Canal had an effect upon  the farms and towns lying along Lake Champlain, in Vermont and New York,  kindred in character to that above described in respect to the Erie  Canal. It brought into the market lands and produce which before had  been worthless, and was a great blessing to all concerned.    There can be no doubt that the building of the Erie Canal was the wisest  and most far-seeing enterprise of the age. It has left a permanent and  indelible mark upon the face of the republic of the United States in the  great communities it has directly assisted to build up at the West, and  in the populous metropolis it created at the mouth of the Hudson River.  None of the canals which have been built to compete with it have yet  succeeded in regaining for their States what was lost to them when the  Erie Canal went into operation. This water route is still the most  important artificial one of its class in the country, and is only  equaled by the Welland Canal in Canada, which is its closest rival. Now  that it is free, it will retain its position as the most popular water  route to the sea from the great West. The Mississippi River will divert  from it all the trade flowing to South America and Mexico; but for the  northwest it will be the chief water highway to the ocean.           *       *       *       *       *          COTTRAU'S LOCOMOTIVE FOR ASCENDING STEEP GRADES.      We borrow, from our contemporary _La Nature_, the annexed figure,  illustrating an ingenious type of locomotive designed for equally  efficient use on both level surfaces and heavy grades.    [Illustration: COTTRAU'S LOCOMOTIVE FOR ASCENDING STEEP GRADES.]    As well known, all the engines employed on level roads are provided with  large driving wheels, which, although they have a comparatively feeble  tractive power, afford a high speed, while, on the contrary, those that  are used for ascending heavy grades have small wheels that move slowly,  but possess, as an offset, a tractive power that enables them to  overcome the resistances of gravity.    M. Cottrau's engine possesses the qualities of both these types, since  it is provided with wheels of large and small diameter, that may be used  at will. These two sets of wheels, as may be seen from the figure, are  arranged on the same driving axle. The large wheels are held apart  the width of the ordinary track, while the small wheels are placed  internally, or as in the case represented in the figure, externally.  These two sets of wheels, being fixed solidly to the same axle, revolve  together.    On level surfaces the engine rests on the large wheels, which revolve  in contact with the rails of the ordinary track, and it then runs with  great speed, while the auxiliary wheels revolve to no purpose. On  reaching an ascent, on the contrary, the engine meets with an elevated  track external or internal to the ordinary one, and which engages with  the auxiliary wheels. The large wheels are then lifted off the ordinary  track and revolve to no purpose. In both cases, the engine is placed  under conditions as advantageous as are those that are built especially  for the two types of roads. The idea appears to be a very ingenious one,  and can certainly be carried out without disturbing the working of the  locomotive. In fact, the same number of piston strokes per minute may  be preserved in the two modes of running, so as to reduce the speed in  ascending, in proportion to the diameters of the wheels. There will thus  occur the same consumption of steam. On another hand, there is nothing  to prevent the boiler from keeping up the same production of steam, for  it has been ascertained by experience, on the majority of railways, that  the speed of running has no influence on vaporization, and that the same  figures may be allowed for passenger as for freight locomotives.    The difficulties in the way of construction that will be met with in the  engine under consideration will be connected with the placing of the  double wheels, which will reduce the already limited space at one's  disposal, and with the necessity that there will be of strengthening all  the parts of the mechanism that are to be submitted to strain.    The installation of the auxiliary track will also prove a peculiarly  delicate matter; and, to prevent accidents, some means will have to be  devised that will permit the auxiliary wheels to engage with this  track very gradually. Still, these difficulties are perhaps not  insurmountable, and if M. Cottrau's ingenious arrangement meets with  final success in practice, it will find numerous applications.           *       *       *       *       *          BACHMANN'S STEAM DRIER.      The apparatus shown in the annexed cuts is capable of effecting a  certain amount of saving in the fuel of a generator, and of securing a  normal operation in a steam engine. If occasion does not occur to blow  off the motive cylinder frequently, the water that is carried over  mechanically by the steam, or that is produced through condensation in  the pipes, accumulates therein and leaks through the joints of the cocks  and valves. This is one of the causes that diminish the performance of  the motor.    [Illustration: BACHMANN'S STEAM DRIER. FIG. 1.]    The steam drier under consideration has been devised by Mr. Bachmann  for the purpose of doing away with such inconveniences. When applied to  apparatus employed in heating, for cooking, for work in a vacuum, it may  be affixed to the pipe at the very place where the steam is utilized, so  as to draw off all the water from the mixture.    As shown by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8467"],[0,"Frost's Laws and By-Laws of American Society (#4)"],[1," is often a kindly act of encouragement for the  latter to shake hands, with a few cordial words.    It is not necessary to introduce people who meet at your house on  morning calls, though it may be done with propriety if the  introduction has been previously ascertained to be mutually  pleasant.    It is optional after such an introduction, with the parties  introduced, to continue or drop the acquaintance so formed.  Without a formal introduction, the merely meeting at the house of  a mutual friend, does not warrant any future recognition. It  rests, however, after an introduction with the lady, if between  lady and gentleman, with the married or elder lady, if between  lady and lady, and with the elder, if between gentlemen, to  continue or drop the acquaintance.    Gentlemen who meet at the house or rooms of a mutual friend are  not obliged to recognize one another if they meet again elsewhere.  There is no rule forbidding their doing so, if agreeable to both  parties, but there is no requirement of etiquette obliging them to  appear as if they had even met before.    A lady is not obliged to afterwards recognize a partner with whom  she may have danced at a ball. It is entirely optional with her to  do so or not; and if she has danced several times with the  gentlemen, it will be a question between her and her conscience  how far she may consider herself justified in passing by without  notice one who has extended to her so much courtesy at a ball.  Etiquette, however, does not require even the slightest  recognition.    When strangers in a city are introduced to residents it is  customary to name the place from which they come, thus: \"Allow me  to introduce to you my friend Mr. Schmidt, from Germany. Mr.  Schmidt, Mr. Popking;\" or if introducing a traveller, \"Allow me to  introduce my friend Mr. Robinson, lately returned from Egypt.\" A  pleasant opening is thus offered for conversation, and a foreigner  may have the pleasure of a salutation in his own language.    An important duty in introducing friends is to pronounce the name  of each party clearly and distinctly, that no error or necessity  for repetition may occur.    It is often a positive kindness to take advantage of the etiquette  which dispenses with introductions at morning calls. Many a witty,  talented person has had a stupid bore pursue him upon such an  introduction, and even the one necessary conversation following an  introduction is a painful effort, owing to the entire  uncongeniality of the parties introduced.    A friend visiting at your house must be introduced to all callers,  who are bound to continue the acquaintance as long as the friend  is your guest. So, if when calling upon a friend, you are  introduced to a visitor, you are bound to extend all courtesies  and attentions which you would desire paid to your visitors in  similar circumstances.    Introductions, given at a party to a stranger visiting in a city,  must be followed by recognition as long as the visit continues.    If, when walking with one friend, you should meet another, it is  not necessary to introduce them; indeed, you should not do so  without special reason for it. Never, even after an introduction,  start a long conversation, unless all continue the walk in the  same direction.    Should you, when walking with a friend, meet a lady who desires to  speak to you, your friend must stop with you, yet an introduction  under such circumstances does not exact any future recognition.    Sisters, brothers or other relatives may always be introduced to  friends when met casually.    If friends meet at public places of amusement and are accompanied  by strangers, introductions are not required by etiquette, and if  made do not oblige any future acquaintance.    It is not necessary to have an introduction in order to pay your  respects to the President of the United States, excepting that of  the master of ceremonies at the receptions. He will receive your  card and present you. For a private interview it is better to be  introduced by a Senator or a member of the House of  Representatives.    In visiting foreign courts, introductions are more a matter of  ceremony than in this country. If you wish to obtain an  introduction to the Emperor of France, you must address your  request to the Grand Chamberlain, which may be done personally or  by letter.    Your statement that you are an American citizen, and a reference  to the American Consul will procure you an interview. Punctuality  to the hour appointed for the interview is essential, and ladies  present themselves in full dress; gentlemen in a dress suit of  black, white vest, gloves and neck-tie.    The ceremony of presentation will be explained before you are  presented.    In the English court, the ladies must be presented by a lady;  gentlemen by a gentleman. Strangers must have credentials from the  Consul before they can be introduced.    If at a dinner, a ball, or upon any occasion you are introduced,  at a friend's house, to one with whom you are not on good terms,  though it be your bitterest enemy, etiquette requires you to  salute him or her courteously, and make no sign of resentment  whilst under your friend's roof.    If you are introduced as a petitioner to any one in authority,  that introduction does not authorize you in claiming an  acquaintance afterwards.    Never introduce persons who may be related to you, without calling  their full name. It is done very often, even amongst well-bred  people, from thoughtfulness, as, \"Mrs. James, allow me to  introduce my cousin Frank; Frank, Mrs. James,\" and poor Mrs. James  is left entirely ignorant of cousin Frank's name. The proper way  is to name the relationship and also the surname of the relative.  If you introduce a brother or sister even, marriage may have  changed the name of one. You should say: \"Mrs. James, allow me to  introduce to you my sister, Miss Curtis; Miss Curtis, Mrs. James.\"    If you are introduced to the relative of a friend, etiquette  requires you to consider that relative an acquaintance, unless  there is some special reason to the contrary.    It is best to avoid introductions in a public conveyance, as few  people like to have their names called out in such places. If such  introductions are made, however, it should be done as quietly as  possible.    To introduce to a friend a person who is in any way objectionable,  is an insult which fully justifies a withdrawal of friendship.    A gentleman should always raise his hat, if introduced in the  street, to either lady or gentleman.    If introducing a foreigner or a gentleman in this country, whose  position gives him an honorary title, always give the title. Thus,  if a member of Congress, meeting a German baron at your house, you  introduce them, you say: \"Mr. Somers, allow me to introduce to you  my friend, the Baron von Schmidt; Baron von Schmidt, the Honorable  Mr. Somers.\"    LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION.    LETTERS of introduction should never be given, except to persons  well known to the person introducing them, and addressed to those  only who have a long-standing friendship for the writer. Amongst  persons but slightly acquainted, such letters are not only foolish  but positively dangerous, as you may thus give your countenance to  those who will take advantage of your carelessness to bring you  into mortifying, if not disgraceful positions.    Even amongst friends of long standing they should be given very  cautiously and sparingly, as it is a great responsibility to send  to your friend a visitor who may prove disagreeable, and you have  no right whatever to call upon comparative strangers to extend  hospitality or courtesy to your friends.    Letters of introduction should always be as short and concise as  possible. If you wish to send any information to your friends  about their visitor, send it in a separate letter by mail.    The utmost brevity is of importance in the letter of introduction,  as it is usually read in the presence of the party introduced, and  the pause must necessarily be awkward. You may in a letter of  introduction use a few words of warm, cordial feeling toward your  friend, but praise of any kind is in as bad taste as it would be  at a personal introduction.    This rule, however, does not apply to letters introducing  applicants for favor, office or position, which latter come more  strictly under the head of letters of recommendation than merely  letters of introduction.    Letters of introduction must be left unsealed invariably; they  should be folded and addressed like any other letter, but it is a  gross breach of etiquette to prevent the bearer from reading what  you may have said of him to your friend. It is optional with the  bearer to seal such letters before delivery, but it is customary  to leave them open.    A letter of introduction should not, unless circumstances make it  absolutely unavoidable, be delivered in person. It should be sent,  with the card of the person introduced, to the person to whom it  is addressed, by a servant. The person receiving it should then  call at once or send a written invitation to his house, and the  person introduced may then call in person. If, however, the stay  in the city is very short, these formalities must be omitted, and  the person introduced call in person, sending in his letter and  card by a servant.    Business letters of introduction should mention the errand and  business of the party introduced, and if your own acquaintance is  of recent date, mention by whom your were yourself introduced.    Letters introducing professional artists may contain a few words  expressive of the pleasure conferred by the talent or skill of the  person introduced.    Letters of introduction soliciting favors should be but seldom  given, and never unless the claims upon both parties interested  are very strong.    There is no rule of etiquette prescribing the exact amount of  attention required to be"]]]
