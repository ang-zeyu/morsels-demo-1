Before recounting the general data of criminal anthropology, it is  necessary to lay particular stress upon a remark which I made in  the original edition of this work, but which our opponents have  too frequently ignored.    We must carefully discriminate between the technical value of  anthropological data concerning the criminal man and their  scientific function in criminal sociology.    For the student of criminal anthropology, who builds up the  natural history of the criminal, every characteristic has an  anatomical, or a physiological, or a psychological value in  itself, apart from the sociological conclusions which it may be  possible to draw from it.  The technical inquiry into these bio-  psychical characteristics is the special work of this new science  of criminal anthropology.    Now these data, which are the conclusions of the anthropologist,  are but starting-points for the criminal sociologist, from which  he has to reach his legal and social conclusions.  Criminal  anthropology is to <p 6>criminal sociology, in its scientific  function, what the biological sciences, in description and  experimentation, are to clinical practice.    In other words, the criminal sociologist is not in duty bound to  conduct for himself the inquiries of criminal anthropology, just  as the clinical operator is not bound to be a physiologist or an  anatomist.  No doubt the direct observation of criminals is a very  serviceable study, even for the criminal sociologist; but the only  duty of the latter is to base his legal and social inferences upon  the positive data of criminal anthropology for the biological  aspects of crime, and upon statistical data for the influences of  physical and social environment, instead of contenting himself  with mere abstract legal syllogisms.    On the other hand it is clear that sundry questions which have a  direct bearing upon criminal anthropology--as, for instance, in  regard to some particular biological characteristic, or to its  evolutionary significance--have no immediate obligation or value  for criminal sociology, which employs only the fundamental and  most indubitable data of criminal anthropology.  So that it is but  a clumsy way of propounding the question to ask, as it is too  frequently asked:  ``What connection can there be between the  cephalic index, or the transverse measurement of a murderer's jaw,  and his responsibility for the crime which he has committed?''  The scientific function of the anthropological data is a very  different thing, and the only legitimate question which sociology  can put to anthropology is this:--``Is the criminal, and in what  respects is he, a normal <p 7>or an abnormal man?  And if he is,  or when he is abnormal, whence is the abnormality derived?  Is it  congenital or contracted, capable or incapable of rectification?''    This is all; and yet it is sufficient to enable the student of  crime to arrive at positive conclusions concerning the measures  which society can take in order to defend itself against crime;  whilst he can draw other conclusions from criminal statistics.    As for the principal data hitherto established by criminal  anthropology, whilst we must refer the reader for detailed  information to the works of specialists, we may repeat that this  new science studies the criminal in his organic and in his  psychical constitution, for these are the two inseparable aspects  of human existence.    A beginning has naturally been made with the organic study of the  criminal, both anatomical and physiological, since we must study  the organ before the function, and the physical before the moral.  This, however, has given rise to a host of misconceptions and one-  sided criticisms, which have not yet ceased; for criminal  anthropology has been charged, by such as consider only the most  conspicuous data with narrowing crime down to the mere result of  conformations of the skull or convolutions of the brain.  The fact  is that purely morphological observations are but preliminary  steps to the histological and physiological study of the brain,  and of the body as a whole.    As for craniology, especially in regard to the two distinct and  characteristic types of criminals--<p 8>murderers and thieves, an  incontestable inferiority has been noted in the shape of the head,  by comparison with normal men, together with a greater frequency  of hereditary and pathological departures from the normal type.  Similarly an examination of the brains of criminals, whilst it  reveals in them an inferiority of form and histological type,  gives also, in a great majority of cases, indications of disease  which were frequently undetected in their lifetime.  Thus M.  Dally, who for twenty years past has displayed exceptional acumen  in problems of this kind, said that ``all the criminals who had  been subjected to autopsy (after execution) gave evidence of  cerebral injury.''[3]      [3] In a discussion at the Medico-Psychological Society of Paris;  ``Proceedings'' for 1881, i. 93, 266, 280, 483.      Observations of the physiognomy of criminals, which no one will  undervalue who has studied criminals in their lifetime, with  adequate knowledge, as well as other physical inquiries, external  and internal, have shown the existence of remarkable types, from  the greater frequency of the tattooed man to exceptionally  abnormal conditions of the frame and the organs, dating from  birth, together with many forms of contracted disease.    Finally, inquiries of a physiological nature into the reflex  action of the body, and especially into general and specific  sensibility, and sensibility to pain, and into reflex action under  external agencies, conducted with the aid of instruments which  record the results, have shown abnormal conditions, all tending to  physical insensibility, deep-seated and <p 9>more or less  absolute, but incontestably different in kind from that which  obtains amongst the average men of the same social classes.    These are organic conditions, it must be at once affirmed, which  account as nothing else can for the undeniable fact of the  hereditary transmission of tendencies to crime, as well as of  predisposition to insanity, to suicide, and to other forms of  degeneration.    The second division of criminal anthropology, which is by far the  more important, with a more direct influence upon criminal  sociology, is the psychological study of the criminal.  This  recognition of its greater importance does not prevent our critics  from concentrating their attack upon the organic characterisation  of criminals, in oblivion of the psychological characterisation,  which even in Lombroso's book occupies the larger part of the  text.[4]      [4] A recent example of this infatuation amongst one-sided, and  therefore ineffectual critics is the work of Colajanni,  ``Socialism and Criminal Sociology,'' Catania, 1889.  In the first  volume, which is devoted to criminal anthropology, out of four  hundred pages of argumentative criticism (which does not prevent  the author from taking our most fundamental conclusions on the  anthropological classification of criminals, and on crime, as  phenomena of psychical atavism), there are only six pages, 227-  232, for the criticism of psychological types.      Criminal psychology presents us with the characteristics which may  be called specially descriptive, such as the slang, the  handwriting, the secret symbols, the literature and art of the  criminal; and on the other hand it makes known to us the  characteristics which, in combination with organic abnormality,  account for the development of crime in the individual.  And these  characteristics are grouped <p 10>in two psychical and fundamental  abnormalities, namely, moral insensibility and want of foresight.    Moral insensibility, which is decidedly more congenital than  contracted, is either total or partial, and is displayed in  criminals who inflict personal injuries, as much as in others,  with a variety of symptoms which I have recorded elsewhere, and  which are eventually reduced to these conditions of the moral  sense in a large number of criminals--a lack of repugnance to the  idea and execution of the offence, previous to its commission, and  the absence of remorse after committing it.    Outside of these conditions of the moral sense, which is no  special sentiment, but an expression of the entire moral  constitution of the individual, as the temperament is of his  physiological constitution, other sentiments, of selfishness or  even of unselfishness, are not wanting in the majority of  criminals.  Hence arise many illusions for superficial observers  of criminal life.  But these latter sentiments are either  excessive, as hate, cupidity, vanity and the like, and are thus  stimulants to crime, or else, as with religion, love, honour,  loyalty, and so on, they cease to be forces antagonistic to crime,  because they have no foundation in a normal moral sense.    From this fundamental inferiority of sentiment there follows an  inferiority of intelligence, which, however, does not exclude  certain forms of craftiness, though it tends to inability to  foresee the consequences of crime, far in excess of what is  observed in the average members of the classes of society to which  the several criminals"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47703"],[0,"Wilford Woodruff, Fourth President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day (#4)"],[1," chief consolation of his  youth and the best evidence of divine purposes, it became doubly so  when he became a Latter-day Saint. Nothing that God had done in former  dispensations {3} was too insignificant for his earnest consideration.  Henceforth he was to speak in the name of the Lord, and act by the  authority of divine command. He loved the memory of the ancient  Prophets and strove earnestly to emulate their example. His life,  therefore, is marked by spiritual growth and a devotion to God's will  that makes it an inspiration to all who knew him or who read the story  of his life and teachings. He honored and magnified every office and  calling conferred upon him from that of a teacher to the president of  the Church. In this high station he laid down his life at the ripe age  of ninety-one years.    Wilford Woodruff was born March 1st, 1807 in the town of Farmington,  Hartford County, Connecticut. He was the son of Aphek Woodruff. His  grandfather was Captain Eldad Woodruff who was the son of Josiah  Woodruff. Josiah was the son of Joseph whose father's name was John,  the son of Mathew Woodruff. This is as far back as Wilford Woodruff's  genealogy has been traced in America. It is claimed that John Woodruff  of South Hampton, Long Island, is the first person in American history  bearing the name of Woodruff. Whether he is related to Matthew  Woodruff, the earliest known ancestor of Wilford in this country, has  not been determined. President Woodruff says, that according to the  ancient Book of Heraldry, one of his ancestors was Lord Mayor of London  in 1579.    His mother's name was Beulah Thompson. The family on his mother's  side, for generations lived at Farmington, Connecticut. The Woodruff  family name is English and is derived from the occupation of its  bearers who in the days of William the Conqueror guarded the woods and  forests for the use of noblemen and who were considered among the most  honored officers in the land. From Wilford Woodruff's account of his  forefathers it appears that they were hardy and long-lived people. He  says: \"My grandfather, Josiah Woodruff, lived nearly one hundred years.  He possessed an iron constitution and performed a great deal of manual  work up to the time of his death. His wife's name was Sarah. She bore  him nine children: Josiah, Appleton, Eldad, Elisha, Joseph, Rhoda,  and Phoebe. There were two of this family whose names are not given.  My grandfather, Eldad Woodruff, was the third son of Josiah. He was  born in Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut in 1751. He likewise  possessed {4} a strong constitution and it was said of him that for  several years he performed more labor than any man in Hartford County.  From over exertion and hewing timber he was attacked with rheumatism in  his right hip which caused a severe lameness for several years before  his death. He married Dinah Woodford by whom he had seven children:  Eldad, Elizabeth, Samuel, Titus, Helen, Aphek, and Ozem. My grandfather  died in Farmington from spotted fever in 1806 at the age of fifty-five  years. My grandmother, Dinah, died in the same place in 1824 from the  effects of a cancer in her breast; her sufferings were very great.    \"My father, Aphek Woodruff, was born in Farmington, November 11, 1778.  He married Beulah Thompson who bore him three sons: Azmon, born Nov.  29th, 1802; Thompson, born December 22nd, 1804; and myself, born March  1st, 1807. My mother died from spotted fever January 11th, 1808 at the  age of twenty-eight years, leaving me a babe of fifteen months. My  father married a second wife, Azubah Hart. She bore him six children.  He was a man of a strong constitution and did a great amount of labor.  At eighteen years of age he began work in a flour mill and saw mill and  continued at his occupation there for about fifty years. Most of that  time he labored eighteen hours a day. He never made any profession of  religion until I baptized him into the Church of Jesus Christ on the  first day of July, 1838. He was a man of great charity, honesty, and  integrity and made himself poor by giving to the poor. He was liberal  in accommodating his fellow men by lending money and by becoming surety  for his neighbors. He generally said yes to every man who asked a favor  at his hands.\"    \"I assisted my father in the Farmington mills until I was twenty  years of age and continued in the occupation of a miller until I was  thirty-one.\"    {5}        CHAPTER 2.    A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.    Arms and Legs Broken.--Injury to Breast Bone and  Ribs.--Drowned.--Frozen.--Scalded.--Other Escapes.--Life Preserved by a  Merciful Providence.    The journal of Wilford Woodruff contains a chapter which he designates  as a \"chapter of accidents.\" It is given thus early in his biography as  it reveals the purposes of an overruling Providence whose mercies and  guiding powers are remarkably manifested throughout a long and arduous  career. He himself regarded his escapes from death as an evidence of a  destructive power that sought to thwart that special mission in life  so wonderfully revealed in the subsequent chapters of this biography.  His life throughout discloses a constant struggle against obstacles  which he had to overcome. They are manifested in every degree of  difficulty, and to less courageous natures many of them would have been  insurmountable.    There are in his words which describe the misfortunes that overtook him  no traces of envy, discouragement or despair. That others were born to  an easier life did not awaken within him a spirit of envy or doubt. To  his mind the joys or sorrows of this world were all subordinate to the  will of an overruling Providence. While he did not complain, he did  not ascribe his difficulties or dangers to fate. He was never so much  concerned about the difficulty in surmounting an obstacle as he was  about his ability through the goodness of God to do so. \"Evidently,\" he  says, \"I have been numbered with those who are apparently the marked  victims of misfortunes. It has seemed to me at times as though some  invisible power were watching my footsteps in search of an opportunity  to destroy my life. I, therefore, ascribe my preservation on earth to  the watchcare of a merciful Providence, whose hand has been stretched  out to rescue me from death when I was in the presence of the most  threatening dangers. Some of these dangers from which I so narrowly  escaped I shall here briefly describe:    \"When three years of age, I fell into a caldron of scalding water  and although instantly rescued, I was so badly burned {6} that it  was nine months before I was thought to be out of the danger of  fatal consequences. My fifth and sixth years were interwoven with  many accidents. On a certain day, in company with my elder brothers,  I entered the barn, and chose the top of a hay mow for a place of  diversion. We had not been there long before I fell from the great beam  upon my face on the bare floor. I was severely hurt, but recovered in a  short time, and was again at play.    \"One Saturday evening, with my brothers Azmon and Thompson, while  playing in the chamber of my father's house, contrary to his  instructions, I made a misstep and fell to the bottom of the stairs,  breaking one of my arms in the fall. So much for disobedience. I  suffered intensely, but soon recovered, feeling that whatever I  suffered in the future, it would not be for disobedience to parents.  The Lord has commanded children to obey their parents; and Paul says,  'This is the first commandment with promise.'    \"It was only a short time after this that I narrowly escaped with my  life. My father owned a number of horned cattle, among which was a  surly bull. One evening I was feeding pumpkins to the cattle, and the  bull leaving his own took the pumpkin I had given to a cow which I  called mine. I was incensed at the selfishness of this male beast, and  promptly picked up the pumpkin he had left, to give it to the cow. No  sooner had I got it in my arms than the bull came plunging toward me  with great fury. I ran down the hill with all my might, the bull at my  heels. My father, seeing the danger I was in, called to me to throw  down the pumpkin, but (forgetting to be obedient) I held on, and as  the bull was approaching me with the fierceness of a tiger, I made a  misstep and fell flat upon the ground. The pumpkin rolled out of my  arms, the bull leaped over me, ran his horns into the pumpkin and tore  it to pieces. Undoubtedly he would have done the same thing to me if I  had not fallen to the ground. This escape, like all others, I attribute  to the mercy and goodness of God.    \"During the same year, while visiting at my Uncle Eldad Woodruff's, I  fell from a porch across some timber, and broke my other arm.    \"Not many months passed by before I was called to endure {7} a still  greater misfortune. My father owned a saw mill in addition to his flour  mill, and one morning, in company with several other boys, I went into  the saw mill and got upon the headlock of the carriage to ride, not  anticipating any danger; but before I was aware of it my leg was caught  between the headlock and the fender post and broken in two. I was taken  to the house, and lay nine hours before my bones were replaced. That  time was spent in severe pain; but being young, my bones soon knitted  together, and in a few weeks I was upon my feet as usual, attending to  the sports of youth. During this confinement my brother Thompson was my  companion. He was suffering from typhus fever.    \"Shortly after this, upon a dark night, I was kicked in the abdomen by  an ox; but being too close to the animal to receive the full force of  the blow, I was more frightened than hurt.    \"It was not long before I made my first effort at loading hay. I was  very young, but thought I had loaded it all right. When on the way to  the barn, the wheel of the wagon struck a rock, and off went the hay. I  fell "]]]
