Look, for instance, at that Indian Moslem drinking a glass of  water. With us the operation is simple enough, but his performance  includes no fewer than five novelties. In the first place he clutches  his tumbler as though it were the throat of a foe; secondly, he  ejaculates, \"In the name of Allah the Compassionate, the Merciful!\"  before wetting his lips; thirdly, he imbibes the contents, swallowing  them, not sipping them as he ought to do, and ending with a satisfied  grunt; fourthly, before setting down the cup, he sighs forth, \"Praise  be to Allah\"-of which you will understand the full meaning in the  Desert; and, fifthly, he replies, \"May Allah make it pleasant to thee!\"  in answer to his friend's polite \"Pleasurably and health!\" Also he is  careful to avoid the irreligious action of drinking the pure element in  a standing position, mindful, however, of the three recognised  exceptions, the fluid of the Holy Well Zemzem, water distributed in  charity, and that which remains after Wuzu, the lesser ablution.  Moreover, in Europe, where both extremities are used indiscriminately,  one forgets the exclusive use of the right hand, the manipulation of  the rosary, the abuse of the chair,-your genuine Oriental gathers up  his legs, looking almost as comfortable in it as a sailor upon the back  of a high-trotting -the rolling gait with the toes straight to the  front, the grave look and the habit of pious ejaculations.    Our voyage over the \"summer sea\" was eventless. In a steamer of two or  three thousand tons you discover    [p.7]the once dreaded, now contemptible, \"stormy waters\" only by the  band-a standing nuisance be it remarked-performing    \"There we lay  All the day,  In the Bay of Biscay, O!\"    The sight of glorious Trafalgar[FN#7]| excites none of the sentiments  with which a tedious sail used to invest it. \"Gib\" is, probably, better  known to you, by Theophile Gautier and Eliot Warburton, than the  regions about Cornhill; besides which, you anchor under the Rock  exactly long enough to land and to breakfast. Malta, too, wears an old  familiar face, which bids you order a dinner and superintend the iceing  of claret (beginning of Oriental barbarism), instead of galloping about  on donkey-back through fiery air in memory of St. Paul and White-Cross  Knights. But though our journey might be called monotonous, there was  nothing to complain of. The ship was in every way comfortable; the  cook, strange to say, was good, and the voyage lasted long enough, and  not too long. On the evening of the thirteenth day after our start, the  big-trowsered pilot, so lovely in his deformities to western eyes, made  his appearance, and the good screw \"Bengal\" found herself at anchor off  the Headland of Clay.[FN#8]    Having been invited to start from the house of a kind friend, John W.  Larking, I disembarked with him, and    [p.8]rejoiced to see that by dint of a beard and a shaven head I had  succeeded, like the Lord of Geesh, in \"misleading the inquisitive  spirit of the populace.\" The mingled herd of spectators before whom we  passed in review on the landing-place, hearing an audible  \"Alhamdolillah\"[FN#9] whispered \"Muslim!\" The infant population spared  me the compliments usually addressed to hatted heads; and when a little  boy, presuming that the occasion might possibly open the hand of  generosity, looked in my face and exclaimed \"Bakhshish,\"[FN#10] he  obtained in reply a \"Mafish;\"[FN#11] which convinced the bystanders  that the sheep-skin covered a real sheep. We then mounted a carriage,  fought our way through the donkeys, and in half an hour found  ourselves, chibuk in mouth and coffee-cup in hand, seated on the diwan  of my friend Larking's hospitable home.    Wonderful was the contrast between the steamer and that villa on the  Mahmudiyah canal! Startling the sudden change from presto to adagio  life! In thirteen days we had passed from the clammy grey fog, that  atmosphere    [p.9]of industry which kept us at anchor off the Isle of Wight, through  the loveliest air of the Inland Sea, whose sparkling blue and purple  haze spread charms even on N. Africa's beldame features, and now we are  sitting silent and still, listening to the monotonous melody of the  East-the soft night-breeze wandering through starlit skies and tufted  trees, with a voice of melancholy meaning.    And this is the Arab's Kayf. The savouring of animal existence; the  passive enjoyment of mere sense; the pleasant languor, the dreamy  tranquillity, the airy castle-building, which in Asia stand in lieu of  the vigorous, intensive, passionate life of Europe. It is the result of  a lively, impressible, excitable nature, and exquisite sensibility of  nerve; it argues a facility for voluptuousness unknown to northern  regions, where happiness is placed in the exertion of mental and  physical powers; where Ernst ist das Leben; where niggard earth  commands ceaseless sweat of face, and damp chill air demands perpetual  excitement, exercise, or change, or adventure, or dissipation, for want  of something better. In the East, man wants but rest and shade: upon  the banks of a bubbling stream, or under the cool shelter of a perfumed  tree, he is perfectly happy, smoking a pipe, or sipping a cup of  coffee, or drinking a glass of sherbet, but above all things deranging  body and mind as little as possible; the trouble of conversations, the  displeasures of memory, and the vanity of thought being the most  unpleasant interruptions to his Kayf. No wonder that \"Kayf\" is a word  untranslatable in our mother-tongue![FN#12]    \"Laudabunt alii claram Rhodon aut Mytelenen.\"    Let others describe the once famous Capital of    [p.10]Egypt, this City of Misnomers, whose dry docks are ever wet, and  whose marble fountain is eternally dry, whose \"Cleopatra's  Needle\"[FN13] is neither a needle nor Cleopatra's; whose \"Pompey's  Pillar\" never had any earthly connection with Pompey; and whose  Cleopatra's Baths are, according to veracious travellers, no baths at  all. Yet it is a wonderful place, this \"Libyan suburb\" of our day, this  outpost of civilisation planted upon the skirts of barbarism, this  Osiris seated side by side with Typhon, his great old enemy. Still may  be said of it, \"it ever beareth something new[FN#14];\" and Alexandria,  a threadbare subject in Bruce's time, is even yet, from its perpetual  changes, a fit field for modern description.[FN#15]    [p.11]The better to blind the inquisitive eyes of servants and  visitors, my friend, Larking, lodged me in an out-house, where I could  revel in the utmost freedom of life and manners. And although some  Armenian Dragoman, a restless spy like all his race, occasionally  remarked voila un Persan diablement degage, none, except those who were  entrusted with the secret, had any idea of the part I was playing. The  domestics, devout Moslems, pronounced me an 'Ajami,[FN#16] a kind of  Mohammedan, not a good one like themselves, but, still better than  nothing. I lost no time in securing the assistance of a Shaykh,[FN#17]  and plunged once more into the intricacies of the Faith; revived my  recollections of religious ablutions, read the Koran, and again became  an adept in the art of prostration. My leisure hours were employed in  visiting the baths and coffee-houses, in attending the bazars, and in  shopping,-an operation which hereabouts consists of sitting upon a  chapman's counter, smoking, sipping coffee, and telling your beads the  while, to show that you are not of the slaves for whom time is made; in  fact, in pitting your patience against that of your adversary, the  vendor. I found time for a short excursion to a country village on the  banks of the canal; nor was an opportunity of seeing \"Al-nahl,\" the  \"Bee-dance;\" neglected, for it would be some months before my eyes  might dwell on such a pleasant spectacle again.  \"Delicias videam, Nile jocose, tuas!\"    Careful of graver matters, I attended the mosque, and visited the  venerable localities in which modern Alexandria abounds. Pilgrimaging  Moslems are here    [p.12]shown the tomb of Al-nabi Daniyal (Daniel the Prophet),  discovered upon a spot where the late Sultan Mahmud dreamed that he saw  an ancient man at prayer.[FN#18] Sikandar al-Rumi, the Moslem Alexander  the Great, of course left his bones in the place bearing his name, or,  as he ought to have done so, bones have been found for him. Alexandria  also boasts of two celebrated Walis-holy men. One is Mohammed  al-Busiri, the author of a poem called Al-Burdah, universally read by  the world of Islam, and locally recited at funerals and on other solemn  occasions. The other is Abu Abbas al-Andalusi, a sage and saint of the  first water, at whose tomb prayer is never breathed in vain.    It is not to be supposed that the people of Alexandria could look upon  my phials and pill-boxes without a yearning for their contents. An  Indian doctor, too, was a novelty to them; Franks they despised,-but a  man who had come so far from East and West! Then there was something  infinitely seducing in the character of a magician, doctor, and fakir,  each admirable of itself, thus combined to make \"great medicine.\" Men,  women, and children besieged my door, by which means I could see the  people face to face, and especially the fair sex, of which Europeans,  generally speaking, know only the worst specimens. Even respectable  natives, after witnessing a performance of \"Mandal\" and the Magic  mirror[FN#19], opined that the stranger was a holy man, gifted    [p.13]with supernatural powers, and knowing everything. One old person  sent to offer me his daughter in marriage; he said nothing about  dowry,-but I thought proper to decline the honour. And a middle-aged  lady proffered me the sum of one hundred piastres,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4658"],[0,"Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah & Meccah — Volume 2 (#4)"],[1,"off their liabilities, or relying upon the next  begging trip to Turkey; and such a proceeding, contrary to the custom  of the Moslem world, is not condemned by public opinion. Above all  their qualities, personal conceit is remarkable: they show it in their  strut, in their looks, and almost in every word. I am such an one, the  son of such an one, is a common expletive, especially in times of  danger; and this spirit is not wholly to be condemned, as it certainly  acts as an incentive to gallant actions. But it often excites them to  vie with one another in expensive entertainments and similar vanities.  The expression, so offensive to English ears, Inshallah BukraPlease God,  tomorrowalways said about what should be done to-day, is here common as  in Egypt or in India. This procrastination belongs more or less to all  Orientals. But Arabia especially abounds in the Tawakkal al Allah, ya  Shaykh!Place thy reliance upon Allah, O Shaykh!enjoined when a man should  depend upon his own exertions. Upon the whole, however, though alive to  the infirmities of the Madani character, I thought favourably of it,  finding among this people more of the redeeming point, manliness,    [p.22]than in most Eastern nations with whom I am acquainted.    The Arabs, like the Egyptians, all marry. Yet, as usual, they are hard  and facetious upon that ill-treated subjectmatrimony. It has exercised  the brain of their wits and sages, who have not failed to indite  notable things concerning it. Saith Harikar al-Hakim [(]Dominie Do-All)  to his nephew Nadan (Sir Witless), whom he would dissuade from taking  to himself a wife, Marriage is joy for a month and sorrow for a life,  and the paying of settlements and the breaking of back (i.e. under the  load of misery), and the listening to a woman's tongue! And again we  have in verse:    They said marry! I replied, far be it from me  To take to my bosom a sackful of snakes.  I am freewhy then become a slave?  May Allah never bless womankind!    And the following lines are generally quoted, as affording a kind of  birds-eye view of female existence:    From 10 (years of age) unto 20,  A repose to the eyes of beholders.[FN#35]  From 20 unto 30,  Still fair and full of flesh.  From 30 unto 40,  A mother of many boys and girls.  From 40 unto 50,  An old woman of the deceitful.  From 50 unto 60,  Slay her with a knife.  From 60 unto 70,  The curse of Allah upon them, one and all!    Another popular couplet makes a most unsupported assertion:    They declare womankind to be heaven to man,  I say, Allah, give me Jahannam, and not this heaven.    Yet the fair sex has the laugh on its side, for these railers at  Al-Madinah as at other places, invariably marry. The    [p.23]marriage ceremony is tedious and expensive. It begins with a  Khitbah or betrothal: the father of the young man repairs to the parent  or guardian of the girl, and at the end of his visit exclaims, The  Fatihah! we beg of your kindness your daughter for our son. Should the  other be favourable to the proposal, his reply is, Welcome and  congratulation to you: but we must perform Istikharah[FN#36] (religious  lot casting); and, when consent is given, both pledge themselves to the  agreement by reciting the Fatihah. Then commence negotiations about the  Mahr or sum settled upon the bride[FN#37]; and after the smoothing of  this difficulty follow feastings of friends and relatives, male and  female. The marriage itself is called Akd al-Nikah or Ziwaj. A Walimah  or banquet is prepared by the father of the Aris (groom), at his own  house, and the Kazi attends to perform the nuptial ceremony, the girls  consent being obtained through her Wakil, any male relation whom she  commissions to act for her. Then, with great pomp and circumstance, the  Aris visits his Arusah (bride) at her fathers house; and finally, with a  Zuffah or procession and sundry ceremonies at the Harim, she is brought  to her new home. Arab funerals are as simple as their marriages are  complicated. Neither Naddabah (myriologist or hired keener), nor indeed  any female, even a relation, is present at burials as in other parts of  the Moslem world,[FN#38] and it is esteemed disgraceful    [p.24]for a man to weep aloud. The Prophet, ho doubtless had heard of  those pagan mournings, where an effeminate and unlimited display of woe  was often terminated by licentious excesses, like the Christians  half-heathen wakes, forbad [a]ught beyond a decent demonstration of  grief. And his strong good sense enabled him to see through the vanity  of professional mourners. At Al-Madinah the corpse is interred shortly  after decease. The bier is carried though the streets at a moderate  pace, by friends and relatives,[FN#39] these bringing up the rear.  Every man who passes lends his shoulder for a minute, a mark of respect  to the dead, and also considered a pious and a prayerful act. Arrived  at the Harim, they carry the corpse in visitation to the Prophets  window, and pray over it at Osmans niche. Finally, it is interred after  the usual Moslem fashion in the cemetery Al-Bakia.    Al-Madinah, though pillaged by the Wahhabis, still abounds in books.  Near the Harim are two Madrasah or colleges, the Mahmudiyah, so called  from Sultan Mahmud, and that of Bashir Agha: both have large stores of  theological and other works. I also heard of extensive private  collections, particularly of one belonging to the Najib al-Ashraf, or  chief of the Sharifs, a certain Mohammed Jamal al-Layl, whose father is  well-known in India. Besides which, there is a large Wakf or bequest of  books, presented to the Mosque or entailed upon particular  families.[FN#40] The celebrated Mohammed Ibn Abdillah al-Sannusi[FN#41]  has removed    [p.25] his collection, amounting, it is said, to eight thousand  volumes, from Al-Madinah to his house in Jabal Kubays at Meccah. The  burial-place of the Prophet, therefore, no longer lies open to the  charge of utter ignorance brought against it by my predecessor.[FN#42]  The people now praise their Olema for learning, and boast a superiority  in respect of science over Meccah. Yet many students leave the place  for Damascus and Cairo, where the Riwak al-Haramayn (College of the Two  Shrines) in the Azhar Mosque University, is always crowded; and though  Omar Effendi boasted to me that his city was full of lore, he did not  appear the less anxious to attend the lectures of Egyptian professors.  But none of my informants claimed for Al-Madinah any facilities of  studying other than the purely religious sciences.[FN#43] Philosophy,  medicine, arithmetic, mathematics, and algebra cannot be learnt here. I  was careful to inquire about the occult sciences, remembering that  Paracelsus had travelled in Arabia, and that the Count Cagliostro  (Giuseppe Balsamo), who claimed the Meccan Sharif as his father,  asserted that about A.D. 1765 he had studied alchemy at Al-Madinah. The  only trace I could find was a superficial knowledge of the Magic  Mirror. But after denying the Madani the praise of varied learning, it  must be owned that their quick observation and retentive memories have  stored up for    [p.26]them an abundance of superficial knowledge, culled from  conversations in the market and in the camp. I found it impossible here  to display those feats which in Sind, Southern Persia, Eastern Arabia,  and many parts of India, would be looked upon as miraculous. Most  probably one of the company had witnessed the performance of some  Italian conjuror at Constantinople or Alexandria, and retained a lively  recollection of every manuvre. As linguists they are not equal to the  Meccans, who surpass all Orientals excepting only the Armenians; the  Madani seldom know Turkish, and more rarely still Persian and Indian.  Those only who have studied in Egypt chaunt the Koran well. The  citizens speak and pronounce[FN#44] their language purely; they are not  equal to the people of the southern Hijaz, still their Arabic is  refreshing after the horrors of Cairo and Maskat.    The classical Arabic, be it observed, in consequence of an extended  empire, soon split up into various dialects, as the Latin under similar  circumstances separated into the Neo-Roman patois of Italy, Sicily,  Provence, and Languedoc. And though Niebuhr has been deservedly    [p.27]censured for comparing the Koranic language to Latin and the  vulgar tongue to Italian, still there is a great difference between  them, almost every word having undergone some alteration in addition to  the manifold changes and simplifications of grammar and syntax. The  traveller will hear in every part of Arabia that some distant tribe  preserves the linguistic purity of its ancestors, uses final vowels  with the noun, and rejects the addition of the pronoun which apocope in  the verb now renders necessary.[FN#45] But I greatly doubt the  existence of such a race of philologists. In Al-Hijaz, however, it is  considered graceful in an old man, especially when conversing publicly,  to lean towards classical Arabic. On the contrary, in a youth this  would be treated as pedantic affectation, and condemned in some such  satiric quotation as    There are two things colder than ice,  A young old man, and an old young man.    [FN#1] Ibn Jubayr relates that in his day a descendant of Belal, the  original Muezzin of the Prophet, practised his ancestral profession at  Al-Madinah.  [FN#2] This word is said to be the plural of Nakhwali,one who cultivates  the date tree, a gardener or farmer. No one could tell me whether these  heretics had not a peculiar name for themselves. I hazard a conjecture  that they may be identical with the Mutawalli (also written Mutawilah,  Mutaalis, Metoualis, &c., &c.), the hardy, courageous, and hospitable  mountaineers of Syria, and Clesyria Proper. This race of sectarians,  about 35,000 in number, holds to the Imamship or supreme pontificate of  Ali and his"]]]
