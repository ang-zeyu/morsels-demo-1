[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4294"],[0,"Tales of Aztlan; The Romance of a Hero of Our Late Spanish-American War, (#4)"],[1," rose my fear subsided and vanished. I railed at the poor  fellow and abused and cursed him shamefully, threatening to kill him  for being a coward and a fool. I made him draw the bullet and reload  his musket in a proper manner.    When I grew older I acquired the faculty to curb the instinctive  feeling of fear which is inborn in all creatures and undoubtedly is a  wise provision of nature, necessary to the continuance of life and  conducive to self-preservation. Knowing that all men who ever lived and  all who now live must surely die, I failed to see anything particularly  fearful in death. I may truthfully say that I have several times met  death face to face squarely and feared not. On these occasions I tried  not to escape what seemed to be my final doom, but in the dim  consciousness of mind that I should be dead long enough anyway, I tried  to delay my departure to a better life as long as possible, exerting  myself exceedingly to accomplish this purpose. Undoubtedly this must  have made me a very undesirable person to contend with in a fight.  Luckily for me, I have never been afflicted with a quarrelsome or  vindictive mind. This is not a boastful or frivolous assertion, but is  uttered in the spirit of thankfulness to the allwise Creator of Heaven  and earth.    Looking around, I beheld a sight which cheered me mightily. There, a  few yards ahead of my wagon, was a great hole in the ground, made by  badgers; or it may have been the palace of a king of prairie dogs.  Quickly I drove my team forward, right over it. Then, pretending to be  rearranging my cargo, I took out the end gate of my wagon and covered  the hole with it. Next, I wet some gunny sacks and placed them on the  ground under the board. Now, thought I, here is my chance for an  honorable retreat if anything should go wrong. I intended to close up  the hole behind me with the wet sacks, taking the risk of snake bites  in preference to the tender mercies of the Indians. As these ground  lairs take a turn a few feet down and are connected with various  underground passages and have several outlets, I had a fair prospect to  escape should the Indians discover my whereabouts, for they could  neither burn nor smoke me out, and were not likely to take the time to  reduce my fort by starvation. It took me but a very short time to make  my preparations, and I did it unnoticed by my companions, who seemed  fully preoccupied with their own troubles.    A horseman galloped up to our division, a great, swarthy,  fierce-looking man, bearded like the pard. This man did not act like a  scared person. One glance at the frightened faces of his countrymen  sufficed to enlighten and also to enrage him.    \"Senores,\" he said, \"I perceive you are anxious and ready for a fight.  I hope the Indians will accommodate us, as we are greatly in need of a  little sport. It may happen that some of you will lose your scalps, and  I hope that it is not you, Senor Felipe Morales. I should be very sorry  for your poor old mother and your crippled sister, for who will support  them if you should fail them? As for you, Senor Juan, it does not  matter much if you never again breathe the air of New Mexico. Your  young little wife has not yet had an opportunity to know you fully,  anyway, and your cousin, the strapping Don Isidro Chavez, will surely  take the best care of her. They say he calls on her daily to inquire  after her welfare. Senor Cuzco Gonzales, as you might be unlucky enough  to leave your bones on this prairie, I would advise you to make me heir  to your garden of chile peppers. To be sure, I never saw a more  tempting crop! Mayhap you will have no further use for chile, as the  Indians are likely to heat your belly with hot coals, in lieu of  peppers.\"    Then he called for the cook. \"Senor Doctor,\" he said, \"prepare the  medicine for this man, who is too sick to load a musket properly, and  had to be shown how to do so by a little gringo, as I observed a while  ago. Hold him, Senores.\" And they held him down while the cook  administered the medicine, forcing it down his unwilling throat. The  medicine was compounded from salt, and the prescribed dose was a  handful of it dissolved in a tin cupful of water. This seemed to revive  the patient's faltering spirit wonderfully. The cook, a half-witted  fellow, was another man who seemed to have no fear. His eyes shone  wickedly and he was stripped for the fight. A red bandanna kerchief  tied around his head, he glided stealthily about, thirsty for Indian  blood as any wolf. They told me that his mother and sister had died at  the hands of the cruel Apaches.    To me the rider said, \"Senor Americanito, I know your gun is loaded  right and is ready to shoot straight. Look you, if you plant a bullet  just below an Indian's navel, you will see him do a double somersault,  which is more wonderful to behold than any circus performance you ever  saw.\"    Here was a man good to see, a descendant of the famous Don Fernando  Cortez, conquistador, and molded on the lines of Pizarro, the wily  conqueror of Peru, and he heartened our crew amazingly. He exhorted the  men to be brave and fight like Spaniards, and he prayed to the saints  to preserve us; and piously remembering his enemies, he called on the  devil to preserve the Indians. Such zealous devotion found merited  favor with the blessed saints in Heaven, for they granted his prayer,  and the Indians did not attack us that day.    On the following day, Don Emillo Cortez came again and asked me to ride  with him as a scout. He had brought a young man to drive the team in my  stead. Gladly I accepted his invitation. He arranged a pillion for his  saddle and mounted me behind him, facing the horse's tail. Then he  passed a broad strap around his waist and my body and armed me with a  Henry repeating rifle, then a new invention and a very serviceable gun.  In this manner I had both hands free and made him the best sort of a  rear guard. We cantered toward a sandy hill on our left. A coyote came  our way, appearing from the crest of the hill. The animal was looking  back over its shoulder and veered off when it scented us. Don Emilio  halted his horse. \"That coyote is driven by Indians,\" said he; \"do you  think you can hit it at this distance?\" I thought I could by aiming  high and a little forward. At the crack of my rifle the coyote yelped  and bit its side, then rolling on the grass, expired. \"Carajo! a dead  shot, for Dios!\" exclaimed Don Emilio. \"That will teach the heathen  Indians to keep their distance; they will not be over-anxious to meet  these two Christians at close quarters!\"    We were not molested on this day nor on the next, but on the day  thereafter we were in terrible danger. The Indians fired the dry grass,  and if the wind had been stronger we must have been burned to death. As  it was we were nearly suffocated from traveling in a dense smoke for  several hours. Then, fortunately, we reached the bottom lands of the  Arkansas River and were safe from fire, as the valley was very wide and  covered with tall green grass which could not burn; and no sooner was  the last wagon on safe ground than the fire gained the rim of the green  bottomland. Our oxen were exhausted and in a bad plight, so we  fortified and camped here for several days to recuperate before we  forded the river. This took up several days, as the water was quite  high and the river bottom a dangerous quicksand. To stop the wheels of  a wagon for one moment meant the loss of the wagon and the lives of the  cattle, perhaps. The treacherous sands would have engulfed them. Forty  yoke of oxen were hitched to every vehicle, and we had no losses. On  the other side we found the prairie burned over, and we traveled all  day until evening in order to reach a suitable camping place with  sufficient grass for our animals. As there was no water and the cattle  were suffering, we were compelled to drive our herd back to the river  and return again that same night. The rising sun found us under way  again, and by noon we came to good camping ground with an abundance of  grass and water.          CHAPTER III.    THE MYSTERY OF THE SMOKING RUIN. STALKING A WARRIOR. THE AMBUSH      Now we were past the most dangerous part of our journey, leaving the  Comanche country and entering the domain of the Ute Indians and other  tribes, who were not as brave as the Arapahoes and Comanches. Here our  caravan-formation was broken up and each outfit traveled separately at  its own risk.    The next day we witnessed a most horrible and distressing sight.  Willingly would I surrender several years of my allotted lifetime on  earth if I could thereby efface forever the awful impression of this  pitiful tragedy from my memory. Alas I that I was fated to behold the  shocking sight! For days thereafter we plodded on, a sad-looking,  sober, downhearted lot of men, grieved to distraction, and there I left  the innocence of boyhood--wiser surely, but not better! We neared the  still smoking ruins of what had once been a happy home. As I approached  to gratify my curiosity, I met several of my companions, who were  returning and who implored me not to go nearer. An old Mexican,  ignorant, rough, and callous as he was, begged me, with tears streaming  down his face, to retrace my steps. Alas, when would impulsive youth  ever listen to wise counsel and take heed! I entered the ruins and saw  a dark telltale pool oozing forth from under the door of a cellar. Oh,  had I but then overcome my morbid curiosity and fled! But no! I must  needs open the door and look in. I saw--I saw a beautiful whiskey  barrel, its belly bursted and its head stove in!    The trip across the plains was a very healthful and pleasant experience  to me. During the greatest heat and while the moon favored us, we often  traveled at night and rested in daytime. By foregoing my rest, I found  opportunity to hunt antelope and smaller game. I was very fond of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43008"],[0,"Around the Yule Log (#4)"],[1,"fellow, and it  was evident that to him Christmas meant only gladness and jollity. But  the Shadow still rested upon Mr. Broadstreet and all the snowy  sidewalk about him. He was thoroughly puzzled to find its object, and  had almost begun to consider the whole affair a delusion, when his  eyes fell upon an odd little man, standing in the shelter of the  trees, and visibly shaking with the cold, although his coat was  tightly buttoned about his meager form, and his old hat pulled down  over his ears. As he saw the portly lawyer looking at him he advanced  timidly and touched his hat.    \"Can I carry a bundle for you, sir?\" he asked, his teeth chattering as  he spoke.    \"Why, I'm afraid not,\" said Mr. Broadstreet. \"I've just sent away all  my goods.\"    The man's face fell. He touched his hat again and was humbly turning  away, when the other laid his hand lightly on his shoulder.    \"You seem to be really suffering with the cold, my friend,\" he said in  such gentle tones that his \"learned brothers upon the other side\"  would not have recognized it; \"and that's a little too bad for  Christmas Eve.\"    \"Christmas! Christmas!\" shivered the man with a little moan, wringing  his thin hands, \"what is that to me! What is that to a man whose wife  is dying for want of tender nursing and wholesome food? whose children  are growing up to a life of misery and degradation? whose own  happiness is gone, gone, so long ago that he has forgotten the feeling  of it?\"    Mr. Broadstreet patted the shoulder gently. \"Come, come,\" he said,  trying to speak cheerily; \"it isn't so bad as that, you know. Times  are better, and there's plenty of work.\"    \"Work!\" cried the man bitterly. \"Yes, for the friends of the rich; for  the young and strong; for the hopeful, but not for me. I tell you,  sir,\" he continued, raising his clenched fist until the ragged sleeve  fell back and left his long, gaunt wrist bare in the biting wind,  \"I've walked from end to end of Boston, day after day, answering  every advertisement, applying for any kind of honorable employment;  but not even the city will take me to shovel snow in the streets, and  I'm discouraged, discouraged.\"    To Mr. Broadstreet's dismay, the poor fellow suddenly hid his face in  his hands, and broke down in a tempest of sobs.    Ah, how dark the Shadow was then! The storm had ceased, but the keen  northwest wind still swept the streets, filling the air with fine, icy  particles of snow, and driving to their warm homes those who had  remained down town to make their last purchases.    The man shivered and sobbed by turns, and was quite the sport of the  wind, which was buffeting him with its soft, cruel paws; when suddenly  the world seemed to grow warmer. He felt something heavy and soft upon  his back and around his neck. Mechanically thrusting his arms through  the sleeves which opened to meet them, and looking up in amazement, he  beheld his new friend standing upon the sidewalk in his dressing-gown,  a genial smile upon his beaming face, and his hand outstretched. The  lawyer laughed gleefully at his consternation.    \"It's all right,\" he said, as the Discouraged Man tried to pull off  the ulster and return it to its owner. \"I'm warmer than ever. Come on,  let's go home and see your wife and children. Don't stop to talk!\" and  seizing the other by the hand, or rather the cuff of his sleeve, which  was much too long for him, he hurried him off, snatching a couple of  wreaths from the stand as he went by, and dropping a half-dollar in  their place.    It was a strange experience for the proud lawyer, that walk through  the dark streets, floundering among snow-drifts, slipping, tumbling,  scrambling along over icy sidewalks and buried crossings, the  long-skirted gown flapping about his heels in the most ridiculous way.  He kept his eyes steadily fixed on the Shadow, which was always before  him, now turning down a side street, now doubling on itself, ever  growing more and more distinct, and drawing its two followers farther  and farther into the lowest quarter of the city. The stars were out  now, and seemed to flicker in the fierce wind like the gas lights upon  the street corners. Mr. Broadstreet felt curiously warm without his  ulster and as light-hearted as a boy.    As they passed through the most brilliantly-lighted streets, however,  he saw much that filled him for the moment with sadness. For the  Shadow now grew enormously large, and rested upon many places. It  brooded darkly over the brilliant saloons that lined the way, and that  clothed themselves in the very garments of Christmas to attract the  innocent and foolish, so that, drawn by the sheen of holly and  evergreen, and the show of festivities and good cheer, they might  enter and find their own destruction. Oftentimes, too, the Shadow  flitted along the street in company with some man or woman who to all  outward appearance was calm and content with life; perhaps even  happy, one would have said. In the black folds of the Shadow,  brutal-faced ruffians hid their bleared eyes; houses were draped as in  some time of national mourning; once, the slight, pretty figure of a  young girl came up, wearing the Shadow flauntingly about her neck,  like a scarf; she stopped, and seemed about to address Mr. Broadstreet  with bold words. As she met his kind, pitying glance, however, her own  eyes fell, her lips quivered, she drew the Shadow about her face and  fled. Alas! he could do nothing for such as her, unless that gentle,  fatherly face should come before her again, in her solitude, and, by  its silent eloquence, lead her to better things.    While Mr. Broadstreet was peering about for the Shadow, and taking  into his heart the lessons it taught, he had not been idle, giving a  kind word or a bit of money or a pleasant glance wherever the chance  offered.    The Shadow now paused before a narrow doorway in a crooked little  street, and the two, or rather the three, for the Shadow went before  them, entered and mounted the stairway. Mr. Broadstreet stumbled  several times, but the Discouraged Man went up like one who was well  used to the premises. As they reached the third landing, a voice  somewhere near them commenced to sing feebly, and they stopped to  listen.    \"It's Annette,\" whispered the Discouraged Man; \"she's singing for me.  It was a way she had when we were first married, and I used to like  it, coming home from a hard day's work; so she's tried to keep it up  ever since. Do you hear her, sir?\"    Yes, Mr. Broadstreet heard her. Poor, poor little thin voice,  trembling weakly on the high notes and avoiding the low ones  altogether. It was more like a child's than a woman's, and so  tired--so tired! He fumbled in his dressing-gown pocket and turned his  head away; quite needlessly, for it was very dark.    The two men remained silent for a moment, listening to the echo of the  gay young voice with which the little bride used to greet her husband;  she, so tender, and loving, and true; he, so strong, and brave, and  hopeful for the future! And as they listened, they caught the words:        \"Christ was born on Christmas Day,      Wreathe the holly, twine the bay,      Carol Christmas joyfully,      The Babe, the Son, the Holy One of Mary.\"    \"That's a new one,\" whispered the Discouraged Man again, delightedly.  \"She never sang it before. She must have learned it on purpose for  to-night!\"    There was a weary little pause within the room; she wondering,  perhaps, why he didn't come in. Presently she began again, and her  voice had grown strangely weak, so that they could hardly hear it, in  the rush of the wind outside the building:        \"Let the bright red berries glow,      Everywhere--in goodly show\"--    It died away into a mere whisper, and then ceased entirely.    Mr. Broadstreet hesitated no longer, but touched his companion's arm,  and they both entered.    She was lying on a rude bed in the corner of the room, her eyes  closed, and her hands folded upon her breast. A look of agony swept  across the face of her husband as he knelt beside her, taking her cold  hands--ah, so thin! in his own, chafing and kissing them by turns.    Above his head on the whitewashed wall was the word \"_John_,\" in  large, bright letters. It was his name; she had crept from her bed and  traced it with her finger-tip upon the frosty window-pane, so that the  light from a far-off street lamp shone through the clear lines, and  thus reproduced them upon the opposite wall. Just beneath was \"_Merry  Christmas_.\" She thought it would please him, and seem like a sort of  decoration, hung there above her bed. And now he was kneeling by her  side, and holding her thin hands. Perhaps he was more discouraged than  ever, just then. O Shadow, Shadow, could you not have spared him this?    Mr. Broadstreet hung the wreaths he had brought upon the bed-post, and  waited helplessly. A mist gathered in his eyes, so that he could not  see; the walls of the little dismal chamber wavered to and fro, the  Shadow grew more and more dense until it seemed to assume definite  shape, the shape of Christmas Present, sitting as before, enthroned  amidst plenty and good cheer; the deep-toned bells in a neighboring  church-tower slowly and solemnly tolled twelve strokes, answered by  the silver chime of a clock; the flames of the open fire rose and  fell fitfully, in mute answer to the blasts of wind that roared about  the chimney top. The Ghost dwindled rapidly, the Discouraged Man  assumed the proportions and appearance of a marble figure under the  mantel, and Mr. Broadstreet, starting up in affright, found himself  standing in his own warm room, the Christmas Carol still open at the  wonderful picture in his hand. The air still vibrated with the last  echoes of the midnight-bell. It was Christmas morning.    Not many hours later, the glad sun was shining brightly over the  white-robed city, sprinkling the streets and housetops with"]]]
