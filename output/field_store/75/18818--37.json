Edward Baliol, the king's son, was contracted  to marry the French king's niece. Phillip bound himself to assist  Scotland against any invasion of England, and the Scotch agreed to  cross the Border in case Edward invaded France.    In making this alliance the Scots took the only step possible; for  they had no choice between fighting England with France as their  ally, or fighting France as the subjects of King Edward. The contest  which was approaching seemed all but hopeless. The population  of England was six times as large as that of Scotland, and Edward  could draw from Ireland and Wales great numbers of troops. The  English were trained to war by constant fighting in France, Ireland,  and Wales; while the Scots had, for a very long period, enjoyed  a profound peace, and were for the most part wholly ignorant of  warfare.    Edward at once prepared to invade Scotland; in January he seized  the lands owned by Comyn in Northumberland and sold them, directing  the money to be applied to the raising and maintenance of 1000  men-at-arms and 60,000 foot soldiers, and in February issued a writ  for the preparation of a fleet of 100 vessels.    On the 25th of March he crossed the Tweed with 5000 horse and 30,000  foot. The Scotch leaders were, of course, aware of the gathering  storm, and, collecting their forces, attempted a diversion by  crossing the Border to the west and making a raid into Cumberland.  King Edward, however, marched north and besieged Berwick, the richest  and most flourishing of the towns of Scotland. With the exception  of the castle, it was weakly fortified. The attack was commenced  by the fleet, who were, however, repulsed and driven off. A land  assault, led by the king in person, was then made; the walls were  captured, and the town completely sacked. The inhabitants were  butchered without distinction of age, sex, or condition, and even  those who fled to the churches were slain within the sanctuary.  Contemporary accounts differ as to the numbers who perished on this  occasion. Langtoff says 4000; Hemingford, 8000; Knighton, another  English writer, says 17,000; and Matthew of Westminster, 60,000.  Whichever of these writers is correct, it is certain that almost  the whole of the men, women, and children of the largest and most  populous Scottish town were butchered by the orders of the English  king, who issued direct orders that none should be spared.  From  this terrible visitation Berwick, which was before called the  Alexandria of the West, never recovered.  The castle, which was held  by Sir William Douglas, surrendered immediately; and Sir William,  having sworn fealty to the English king, was permitted to depart.    The English army now marched north. Patrick, Earl of Dunbar,  was with King Edward; but his wife, a noble and patriotic woman,  surrendered the castle to the Scots. The Earl of Surrey, with  a powerful army, sat down before it. The Scotch nobles and people  marched in great numbers, but with little order and discipline,  to raise the siege. They were met by Surrey, whose force, inured  to arms, easily routed the Scotch gathering, no fewer than 10,000  being killed in the conflict and retreat. The English army was  joined by 15,000 Welsh and 30,000 from Ireland, and marched through  Scotland, the castles and towns opening their gates to Edward as  he came, and the nobles, headed by James the Stewart, coming in and  doing homage to him. Baliol was forced to appear in the churchyard  of Strath-Cathro, near Montrose, arrayed in regal robes, and to  resign his kingdom to the Bishop of Durham as Edward's representative,  and to repeat the act a few days afterwards at Brechin in presence  of the king himself. He was then, with his son, sent a prisoner to  London, where they were confined in the Tower for several years.  From Brechin Edward marched through the whole of Scotland, visiting  all the principal towns. He had now dropped the title of Lord  Paramount of Scotland, the country being considered as virtually  part of England. Garrisons were placed in every stronghold in the  country, and many new castles were raised to dominate the people.  The public documents were all carried away to England, the great  seal broken in pieces, and the stone of Scone--upon which, for  five hundred years, every Scotch monarch had been crowned--was  carried away to Westminster, where it has ever since formed the  seat of the thrones upon which English monarchs have been crowned.    The tide of war had not passed near Glen Cairn; but the excitement,  as from time to time the news came of stirring events, was very  great. The tidings of the massacre of Berwick filled all with  consternation and grief. Some of the men quitted their homes and  fought at Dunbar, and fully half of these never returned; but great  as was the humiliation and grief at the reverses which had befallen  the Scotch arms, the feeling was even deeper and more bitter at the  readiness with which the whole of the Scotch nobles flocked in to  make their peace with King Edward.    It seemed so incredible that Scotland, which had so long successfully  resisted all invaders, should now tamely yield without a struggle,  that the people could scarce believe it possible that their boasted  freedom was gone, that the kingdom of Scotland was no more, and the  country become a mere portion of England.  Thus, while the nobles  with their Norman blood and connections accepted the new state of  things contentedly enough, well satisfied to have retained rank and  land, a deep and sullen discontent reigned among the people; they  had been betrayed rather than conquered, and were determined that  some day there should be an uprising, and that Scotland would make  a great effort yet for freedom.  But for this a leader was needed,  and until such a one appeared the people rested quiet and bided  their time.    From time to time there came to Glen Cairn tales of the doings of  that William Wallace who had, when the English first garrisoned the  Scottish castles, while Edward was choosing between the competitors  for her throne, killed young Selbye at Dundee, and had been outlawed  for the deed. After that he went and resided with his uncle, Sir  Ronald Crawford, and then with another uncle, Sir Richard Wallace  of Riccarton. Here he gathered a party of young men, eager spirits  like himself, and swore perpetual hostility to the English.    One day Wallace was fishing in the Irvine when Earl Percy, the  governor of Ayr, rode past with a numerous train.  Five of them  remained behind and asked Wallace for the fish he had taken. He  replied that they were welcome to half of them. Not satisfied with  this, they seized the basket and prepared to carry it off. Wallace  resisted, and one of them drew his sword. Wallace seized the staff  of his net and struck his opponent's sword from his hand; this he  snatched up and stood on guard, while the other four rushed upon  him.  Wallace smote the first so terrible a blow that his head was  cloven from skull to collarbone; with the next blow he severed the  right arm of another, and then disabled a third.  The other two  fled, and overtaking the earl, called on him for help; \"for,\" they  said, \"three of our number who stayed behind with us to take some  fish from the Scot who was fishing are killed or disabled.\"    \"How many were your assailants?\" asked the earl.    \"But the man himself,\" they answered; \"a desperate fellow whom we  could not withstand.\"    \"I have a brave company of followers!\" the earl said with scorn.  \"You allow one Scot to overmatch five of you! I shall not return  to seek for your adversary; for were I to find him I should respect  him too much to do him harm.\"    Fearing that after this adventure he could no longer remain in  safety with his uncle, Wallace left him and took up his abode in  Lag Lane Wood, where his friends joining him, they lived a wild  life together, hunting game and making many expeditions through the  country. On one occasion he entered Ayr in disguise; in the middle  of a crowd he saw some English soldiers, who were boasting that they  were superior to the Scots in strength and feats of arms. One of  them, a strong fellow, was declaring that he could lift a greater  weight than any two Scots. He carried a pole, with which he offered,  for a groat, to let any Scotchman strike him on the back as hard  as he pleased, saying that no Scotchman could strike hard enough  to hurt him.    Wallace offered him three groats for a blow. The soldier eagerly  accepted the money, and Wallace struck him so mighty a blow that  his back was broken and he fell dead on the ground. His comrades  drew their swords and rushed at Wallace, who slew two with the  pole, and when it broke drew the long sword which was hidden in  his garments, and cut his way through them.    On another occasion he again had a fracas with the English in Ayr,  and after killing many was taken prisoner.  Earl Percy was away,  and his lieutenant did not venture to execute him until his return.  A messenger was sent to the Earl, but returned with strict orders  that nothing should be done to the prisoner until he came back.  The bad diet and foul air of the dungeon suited him so ill, after  his free life in the woods, that he fell ill, and was reduced  to so weak a state that he lay like one dead--the jailer indeed  thought that he was so, and he was carried out to be cast into the  prison burial ground, when a woman, who had been his nurse, begged  his body. She had it carried to her house, and then discovered that  life yet remained, and by great care and good nursing succeeded  in restoring him. In order to prevent suspicion that he was still  alive a fictitious funeral was performed.  On recovering, Wallace  had other frays with the English, all of which greatly increased  his reputation throughout that part of the country, so that more  adherents came to him, and his band"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48"],[0,"The 1992 CIA World Factbook (#4)"],[1,"0; real growth rate      2.5% (1990 est.)
