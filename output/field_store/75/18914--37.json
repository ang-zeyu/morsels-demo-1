Now he was sure that he could never get back Danae as long as Perseus was  in the island; so he made a plot to rid himself of him.  And first he  pretended to have forgiven Perseus, and to have forgotten Danae; so that,  for a while, all went as smoothly as ever.    Next he proclaimed a great feast, and invited to it all the chiefs, and  landowners, and the young men of the island, and among them Perseus, that  they might all do him homage as their king, and eat of his banquet in his  hall.    On the appointed day they all came; and as the custom was then, each  guest brought his present with him to the king: one a horse, another a  shawl, or a ring, or a sword; and those who had nothing better brought a  basket of grapes, or of game; but Perseus brought nothing, for he had  nothing to bring, being but a poor sailor-lad.    He was ashamed, however, to go into the king's presence without his gift;  and he was too proud to ask Dictys to lend him one.  So he stood at the  door sorrowfully, watching the rich men go in; and his face grew very red  as they pointed at him, and smiled, and whispered, 'What has that  foundling to give?'    Now this was what Polydectes wanted; and as soon as he heard that Perseus  stood without, he bade them bring him in, and asked him scornfully before  them all, 'Am I not your king, Perseus, and have I not invited you to my  feast?  Where is your present, then?'    Perseus blushed and stammered, while all the proud men round laughed, and  some of them began jeering him openly.  'This fellow was thrown ashore  here like a piece of weed or drift-wood, and yet he is too proud to bring  a gift to the king.'    'And though he does not know who his father is, he is vain enough to let  the old women call him the son of Zeus.'    And so forth, till poor Perseus grew mad with shame, and hardly knowing  what he said, cried out,--'A present! who are you who talk of presents?  See if I do not bring a nobler one than all of yours together!'    So he said boasting; and yet he felt in his heart that he was braver than  all those scoffers, and more able to do some glorious deed.    'Hear him!  Hear the boaster!  What is it to be?' cried they all,  laughing louder than ever.    Then his dream at Samos came into his mind, and he cried aloud, 'The head  of the Gorgon.'    He was half afraid after he had said the words for all laughed louder  than ever, and Polydectes loudest of all.    'You have promised to bring me the Gorgon's head?  Then never appear  again in this island without it.  Go!'    Perseus ground his teeth with rage, for he saw that he had fallen into a  trap; but his promise lay upon him, and he went out without a word.    Down to the cliffs he went, and looked across the broad blue sea; and he  wondered if his dream were true, and prayed in the bitterness of his  soul.    'Pallas Athene, was my dream true? and shall I slay the Gorgon?  If thou  didst really show me her face, let me not come to shame as a liar and  boastful.  Rashly and angrily I promised; but cunningly and patiently  will I perform.'    But there was no answer, nor sign; neither thunder nor any appearance;  not even a cloud in the sky.    And three times Perseus called weeping, 'Rashly and angrily I promised;  but cunningly and patiently will I perform.'    Then he saw afar off above the sea a small white cloud, as bright as  silver.  And it came on, nearer and nearer, till its brightness dazzled  his eyes.    Perseus wondered at that strange cloud, for there was no other cloud all  round the sky; and he trembled as it touched the cliff below.  And as it  touched, it broke, and parted, and within it appeared Pallas Athene, as  he had seen her at Samos in his dream, and beside her a young man more  light-limbed than the stag, whose eyes were like sparks of fire.  By his  side was a scimitar of diamond, all of one clear precious stone, and on  his feet were golden sandals, from the heels of which grew living wings.    They looked upon Perseus keenly, and yet they never moved their eyes; and  they came up the cliffs towards him more swiftly than the sea-gull, and  yet they never moved their feet, nor did the breeze stir the robes about  their limbs; only the wings of the youth's sandals quivered, like a  hawk's when he hangs above the cliff.  And Perseus fell down and  worshipped, for he knew that they were more than man.    But Athene stood before him and spoke gently, and bid him have no fear.  Then--    'Perseus,' she said, 'he who overcomes in one trial merits thereby a  sharper trial still.  You have braved Polydectes, and done manfully.  Dare you brave Medusa the Gorgon?'    And Perseus said, 'Try me; for since you spoke to me in Samos a new soul  has come into my breast, and I should be ashamed not to dare anything  which I can do.  Show me, then, how I can do this!'    'Perseus,' said Athene, 'think well before you attempt; for this deed  requires a seven years' journey, in which you cannot repent or turn back  nor escape; but if your heart fails you, you must die in the Unshapen  Land, where no man will ever find your bones.'    'Better so than live here, useless and despised,' said Perseus.  'Tell  me, then, oh tell me, fair and wise Goddess, of your great kindness and  condescension, how I can do but this one thing, and then, if need be,  die!'    Then Athene smiled and said--    'Be patient, and listen; for if you forget my words, you will indeed die.  You must go northward to the country of the Hyperboreans, who live beyond  the pole, at the sources of the cold north wind, till you find the three  Gray Sisters, who have but one eye and one tooth between them.  You must  ask them the way to the Nymphs, the daughters of the Evening Star, who  dance about the golden tree, in the Atlantic island of the west.  They  will tell you the way to the Gorgon, that you may slay her, my enemy, the  mother of monstrous beasts.  Once she was a maiden as beautiful as morn,  till in her pride she sinned a sin at which the sun hid his face; and  from that day her hair was turned to vipers, and her hands to eagle's  claws; and her heart was filled with shame and rage, and her lips with  bitter venom; and her eyes became so terrible that whosoever looks on  them is turned to stone; and her children are the winged horse and the  giant of the golden sword; and her grandchildren are Echidna the  witch-adder, and Geryon the three-headed tyrant, who feeds his herds  beside the herds of hell.  So she became the sister of the Gorgons,  Stheino and Euryte the abhorred, the daughters of the Queen of the Sea.  Touch them not, for they are immortal; but bring me only Medusa's head.'    'And I will bring it!' said Perseus; 'but how am I to escape her eyes?  Will she not freeze me too into stone?'    'You shall take this polished shield,' said Athene, 'and when you come  near her look not at her herself, but at her image in the brass; so you  may strike her safely.  And when you have struck off her head, wrap it,  with your face turned away, in the folds of the goat-skin on which the  shield hangs, the hide of Amaltheie, the nurse of the AEgis-holder.  So  you will bring it safely back to me, and win to yourself renown, and a  place among the heroes who feast with the Immortals upon the peak where  no winds blow.'    Then Perseus said, 'I will go, though I die in going.  But how shall I  cross the seas without a ship?  And who will show me my way?  And when I  find her, how shall I slay her, if her scales be iron and brass?'    Then the young man spoke: 'These sandals of mine will bear you across the  seas, and over hill and dale like a bird, as they bear me all day long;  for I am Hermes, the far-famed Argus-slayer, the messenger of the  Immortals who dwell on Olympus.'    Then Perseus fell down and worshipped, while the young man spoke again:    'The sandals themselves will guide you on the road, for they are divine  and cannot stray; and this sword itself, the Argus-slayer, will kill her,  for it is divine, and needs no second stroke.  Arise, and gird them on,  and go forth.'    So Perseus arose, and girded on the sandals and the sword.    And Athene cried, 'Now leap from the cliff and be gone.'    But Perseus lingered.    'May I not bid farewell to my mother and to Dictys?  And may I not offer  burnt-offerings to you, and to Hermes the far-famed Argus-slayer, and to  Father Zeus above?'    'You shall not bid farewell to your mother, lest your heart relent at her  weeping.  I will comfort her and Dictys until you return in peace.  Nor  shall you offer burnt-offerings to the Olympians; for your offering shall  be Medusa's head.  Leap, and trust in the armour of the Immortals.'    Then Perseus looked down the cliff and shuddered; but he was ashamed to  show his dread.  Then he thought of Medusa and the renown before him, and  he leaped into the empty air.    And behold, instead of falling he floated, and stood, and ran along the  sky.  He looked back, but Athene had vanished, and Hermes; and the  sandals led him on northward ever, like a crane who follows the spring  toward the Ister fens.        PART III  HOW PERSEUS SLEW THE GORGON      So Perseus started on his journey, going dry-shod over land and sea; and  his heart was high and joyful, for the winged sandals bore him each day a  seven days' journey.    And he went by Cythnus, and by Ceos, and the pleasant Cyclades to Attica;  and past Athens and Thebes, and the Copaic lake, and up the vale of  Cephissus, and past the peaks of OEta and Pindus, and over the rich  Thessalian plains, till the sunny hills of Greece were behind him, and  before him were the wilds of the north.  Then he passed the Thracian  mountains, and many a barbarous tribe, Paeons and Dardans and Triballi,  till he came to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6782"],[0,"The Robbers (#4)"],[1,"me what she accorded to him?  Could a man pay his court to her before he was born? or offend her  before he existed? Why went she to work in such a partial spirit?    No! no! I do her injustice--she bestowed inventive faculty, and set us  naked and helpless on the shore of this great ocean, the world--let  those swim who can--the heavy** may sink. To me she gave naught else,  and how to make the best use of my endowment is my present business.  Men's natural rights are equal; claim is met by claim, effort by effort,  and force by force--right is with the strongest--the limits of our power  constitute our laws.    It is true there are certain organized conventions, which men have  devised to keep up what is called the social compact. Honor! truly a  very convenient coin, which those who know how to pass it may lay out  with great advantage.*** Conscience! oh yes, a useful scarecrow to  frighten sparrows away from cherry-trees; it is something like a fairly  written bill of exchange with which your bankrupt merchant staves off  the evil day.       * See Richard III., Act I, Sc. 1, line 17.       **Heavy is used in a double meaning; the German word is plump,     which Means lumpish clumsy awkward.       ***So Falstaff, Hen. IV., Pt. I., Act V., Sc. 1, \"Honor is a mere     scutcheon.\"    Well! these are all most admirable institutions for keeping fools in  awe, and holding the mob underfoot, that the cunning may live the more  at their ease. Rare institutions, doubtless. They are something like  the fences my boors plant so closely to keep out the hares--yes  I' faith, not a hare can trespass on the enclosure, but my lord claps  spurs to his hunter, and away he gallops over the teeming harvest!    Poor hare! thou playest but a sorry part in this world's drama, but your  worshipful lords must needs have hares!       *[This may help to illustrate a passage in Shakespeare which     puzzles the commentators--\"Cupid is a good hare-finder.\"--Much ADO,     Act I., Sc. 1.     The hare, in Germany, is considered an emblem of abject submission     and cowardice. The word may also be rendered \"Simpleton,\"     \"Sawney,\" or any other of the numerous epithets which imply a soft     condition.]    Then courage, and onward, Francis. The man who fears nothing is as  powerful as he who is feared by everybody. It is now the mode to wear  buckles on your smallclothes, that you may loosen or tighten them at  pleasure. I will be measured for a conscience after the newest fashion,  one that will stretch handsomely as occasion may require. Am I to  blame? It is the tailor's affair? I have heard a great deal of twaddle  about the so-called ties of blood--enough to make a sober man beside  himself. He is your brother, they say; which interpreted, means that he  was manufactured in the same mould, and for that reason he must needs be  sacred in your eyes! To what absurd conclusions must this notion of a  sympathy of souls, derived from the propinquity of bodies, inevitably  tend? A common source of being is to produce community of sentiment;  identity of matter, identity of impulse! Then again,--he is thy father!  He gave thee life, thou art his flesh and blood--and therefore he must  be sacred to thee! Again a most inconsequential deduction! I should  like to know why he begot me;** certainly not out of love for me--for I  must first have existed!       **[The reader of Sterne will remember a very similar passage in the     first chapter of Tristram Shandy.]    Could he know me before I had being, or did he think of me during my  begetting? or did he wish for me at the moment? Did he know what I  should be? If so I would not advise him to acknowledge it or I should  pay him off for his feat. Am I to be thankful to him that I am a man?  As little as I should have had a right to blame him if he had made me a  woman. Can I acknowledge an affection which is not based on any  personal regard? Could personal regard be present before the existence  of its object? In what, then, consists the sacredness of paternity?  Is it in the act itself out of which existence arose? as though this  were aught else than an animal process to appease animal desires. Or  does it lie, perhaps, in the result of this act, which is nothing more  after all than one of iron necessity, and which men would gladly  dispense with, were it not at the cost of flesh and blood? Do I then  owe him thanks for his affection? Why, what is it but a piece of  vanity, the besetting sin of the artist who admires his own works,  however hideous they may be? Look you, this is the whole juggle,  wrapped up in a mystic veil to work on our fears. And shall I, too, be  fooled like an infant? Up then! and to thy work manfully. I will root  up from my path whatever obstructs my progress towards becoming the  master. Master I must be, that I may extort by force what I cannot win  by affection.*         *[This soliloquy in some parts resembles that of Richard, Duke of     Gloster, in Shakespeare's Henry VI., Act V.

Fie! fie upon this weak, effeminate age, fit for nothing  but to ponder over the deeds of former times, and torture the heroes of  antiquity with commentaries, or mangle them in tragedies.

They worship any one for a dinner, and are just as  ready to poison him should he chance to outbid them for a feather-bed  at an auction. They damn the Sadducee who fails to come regularly to  church, although their own devotion consists in reckoning up their  usurious gains at the very altar. They cast themselves on their knees  that they may have an opportunity of displaying their mantles, and  hardly take their eyes off the parson from their anxiety to see how his  wig is frizzled.
