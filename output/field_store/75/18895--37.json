Behind them was  the blank failure of a life--fifteen years of miserable torture, of  degradation, of a daily descent lower into the pit, of the servitude  of shame. When at last he raised his streaming eyes, Fielding and Dicky  could see the haunting terror of the soul, at whose elbow, as it were,  every man cried: \"You are without the pale!\" That look told them how  Heatherby of the Buffs had gone from table d'hote to table d'hote  of Europe, from town to town, from village to village, to make  acquaintances who repulsed him when they discovered who he really was.    Shady Heatherby, who cheated at cards!    Once Fielding made as if to put a hand on his shoulder and speak to him,  but Dicky intervened with a look. The two drank their coffee, Fielding  a little uneasily; but yet in his face there was a new look: of inquiry,  of kindness, even of hope.    Presently Dicky flashed a look and nodded towards the door, and Fielding  dropped his cigar and went on deck, and called down to Holgate the  engineer:    \"Get up steam, and make for Luxor. It's moonlight, and we're safe enough  in this high Nile, eh, Holgate?\"    \"Safe enough, or aw'm a Dootchman,\" said Holgate. Then they talked in a  low voice together. Down in the saloon, Dicky sat watching Heatherby. At  last the Lost One raised his head again.    \"It's worth more to me, this night, than you fellows know,\" he said  brokenly.    \"That's all right,\" said Dicky. \"Have a cigar?\"    He shook his head. \"It's come at the right time. I wanted to be treated  like an Englishman once more--just once more.\"    \"Don't worry. Take in a reef and go steady for a bit. The milk's spilt,  but there are other meadows....\" Dicky waved an arm up the river, up  towards the Soudan!    The Lost One nodded, then his eyes blazed up and took on a hungry look.  His voice suddenly came in a whisper.    \"Gordon was a white man. Gordon said to me three years ago: 'Come with  me, I'll help you on. You don't need to live, if you don't want to. Most  of us will get knocked out up there in the Soudan.' Gordon said that to  me. But there was another fellow with Gordon who knew me, and I couldn't  face it. So I stayed behind here. I've been everything, anything, to  that swine, Selamlik Pasha; but when he told me yesterday to bring  him the daughter of the Arab he killed with his kourbash, I jibbed. I  couldn't stand that. Her father had fed me more than once. I jibbed--by  God, I jibbed! I said I was an Englishman, and I'd see him damned first.  I said it, and I shot the horse, and I'd have shot him--what's that?\"    There was a churning below. The Amenhotep was moving from the bank.    \"She's going--the boat's going,\" said the Lost One, trembling to his  feet.    \"Sit down,\" said Dicky, and gripped him by the arm. \"Where are you  taking me?\" asked Heatherby, a strange, excited look in his face.    \"Up the river.\"    He seemed to read Dicky's thoughts--the clairvoyance of an overwrought  mind: \"To--to Assouan?\" The voice had a curious far-away sound.    \"You shall go beyond Assouan,\" said Dicky. \"To--to Gordon?\" Heatherby's  voice was husky and indistinct.    \"Yes, here's Fielding; he'll give you the tip. Sit down.\" Dicky gently  forced him down into a chair. Six months later, a letter came to Dicky  from an Egyptian officer, saying that Heatherby of the Buffs had died  gallantly fighting in a sortie sent by Gordon into the desert.    \"He had a lot of luck,\" mused Dicky as he read. \"They don't end that way  as a rule.\"    Then he went to Fielding, humming a certain stave from one of Watts's  hymns.          THE PRICE OF THE GRINDSTONE--AND THE DRUM    He lived in the days of Ismail the Khedive, and was familiarly known as  the Murderer. He had earned his name, and he had no repentance. From  the roof of a hut in his native village of Manfaloot he had dropped a  grindstone on the head of Ebn Haroun, who contended with him for  the affections of Ahassa, the daughter of Haleel the barber, and Ebn  Haroun's head was flattened like the cover of a pie. Then he had broken  a cake of dourha bread on the roof for the pigeons above him, and had  come down grinning to the street, where a hesitating mounted policeman  fumbled with his weapon, and four ghaffirs waited for him with their  naboots.    Seti then had weighed his chances, had seen the avenging friends of  Ebn Haroun behind the ghaffirs, and therefore permitted himself to be  marched off to the mudirieh. There the Mudir glared at him and had him  loaded with chains and flung into the prison, where two hundred convicts  arrayed themselves against myriad tribes which, killed individually,  made a spot on the wall no bigger than a threepenny-bit! The carnage  was great, and though Seti was sleepless night after night it was not  because of his crime. He found some solace, however, in provoking his  fellow-prisoners to assaults upon each other; and every morning he  grinned as he saw the dead and wounded dragged out into the clear  sunshine.    The end to this came when the father of Seti, Abou Seti, went at night  to the Mudir and said deceitfully: \"Effendi, by the mercy of Heaven I  have been spared even to this day; for is it not written in the Koran  that a man shall render to his neighbour what is his neighbour's? What  should Abou Seti do with ten feddans of land, while the servant of  Allah, the Effendi Insagi, lives? What is honestly mine is eight  feddans, and the rest, by the grace of God, is thine, O effendi.\"    Every feddan he had he had honestly earned, but this was his way of  offering backsheesh.    And the Mudir had due anger and said: \"No better are ye than a Frank to  have hidden the truth so long and waxed fat as the Nile rises and falls.  The two feddans, as thou sayest, are mine.\"    Abou Seti bowed low, and rejoined, \"Now shall I sleep in peace, by  the grace of Heaven, and all my people under my date-trees--and all my  people?\" he added, with an upward look at the Mudir.    \"But the rentals of the two feddans of land these ten years--thou hast  eased thy soul by bringing the rentals thereof?\"    Abou Seti's glance fell and his hands twitched. His fingers fumbled  with his robe of striped silk. He cursed the Mudir in his heart for his  bitter humour; but was not his son in prison, and did it not lie with  the Mudir whether he lived or died? So he answered:    \"All-seeing and all-knowing art thou, O effendi, and I have reckoned  the rentals even to this hour for the ten years--fifty piastres for each  feddan--\"    \"A hundred for the five years of high Nile,\" interposed the Mudir.    \"Fifty for the five lean years, and a hundred for the five fat years,\"  said Abou Seti, and wished that his words were poisoned arrows, that  they might give the Mudir many deaths at once. \"And may Allah give thee  greatness upon thy greatness!\"    \"God prosper thee also, Abou Seti, and see that thou keep only what is  thine own henceforth. Get thee gone in peace.\"    \"At what hour shall I see the face of my son alive?\" asked Abou Seti in  a low voice, placing his hand upon his turban in humility.    \"To-morrow at even, when the Muezzin calls from the mosque of El Hassan,  be thou at the west wall of the prison by the Gate of the Prophet's  Sorrow, with thy fastest camel. Your son shall ride for me through the  desert even to Farafreh, and bear a letter to the bimbashi there. If he  bear it safely, his life is his own; if he fail, look to thy feddans of  land!\"    \"God is merciful, and Seti is bone of my bone,\" said Abou Seti, and laid  his hand again upon his turban. That was how Mahommed Seti did not at  once pay the price of the grindstone, but rode into the desert bearing  the message of the Mudir and returned safely with the answer, and was  again seen in the cafes of Manfaloot. And none of Ebn Haroun's friends  did aught, for the world knew through whom it was that Seti lived--and  land was hard to keep in Manfaloot and the prison near.    But one day a kavass of the Khedive swooped down on Manfaloot, and  twenty young men were carried off in conscription. Among them was Seti,  now married to Ahassa, the fellah maid for whom the grindstone had  fallen on Ebn Haroun's head. When the fatal number fell to him and  it was ordained that he must go to Dongola to serve in the Khedive's  legions, he went to his father, with Ahassa wailing behind him.    \"Save thyself,\" said the old man with a frown.    \"I have done what I could--I have sold my wife's jewels,\" answered Seti.    \"Ten piastres!\" said old Abou Seti grimly.    \"Twelve,\" said Seti, grinning from ear to ear. \"Thou wilt add four  feddans of land to that I will answer for the Mudir.\"    \"Thy life only cost me two feddans. Shall I pay four to free thee of  serving thy master the Khedive? Get thee gone into the Soudan. I do not  fear for thee: thou wilt live on. Allah is thy friend. Peace be with  thee!\"      II    So it was that the broad-shouldered Seti went to be a soldier, with  all the women of the village wailing behind him, and Ahassa his wife  covering her head with dust and weeping by his side as he stepped out  towards Dongola. For himself, Seti was a philosopher; that is to say,  he was a true Egyptian. Whatever was, was to be; and Seti had a good  digestion, which is a great thing in the desert. Moreover, he had a  capacity for foraging--or foray. The calmness with which he risked his  life for an onion or a water-bag would have done credit to a prince of  buccaneers. He was never flustered. He had dropped a grindstone on the  head of his rival, but the smile that he smiled then was the same smile  with which he suffered and forayed and fought and filched in the desert.  With a back like a door, and arms as long and strong as a gorilla's,  with no moral character to speak of, and an imperturbable selfishness,  even an ignorant Arab like Seti may go far. More than once his bimbashi  drew a sword to cut him down for the peaceful insolent grin with which  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6267"],[0,"The Weavers: a tale of England and Egypt of fifty years ago - Complete (#4)"],[1,"till now. For these things  I have no repentance.\"    \"Thee has had good practice in deceit,\" said the shrill Elder.    Suddenly David's manner changed. His voice became deeper; his eyes  took on that look of brilliance and heat which had given Luke Claridge  anxious thoughts.    \"I did, indeed, as the spirit moved me, even as ye have done.\"    \"Blasphemer, did the spirit move thee to brawl and fight, to drink and  curse, to kiss a wanton in the open road? What hath come upon thee?\"  Again it was the voice of the shrill Elder.    \"Judge me by the truth I speak,\" he answered. \"Save in these things my  life has been an unclasped book for all to read.\"    \"Speak to the charge of brawling and drink, David,\" rejoined the little  Elder Meacham with the high collar and gaze upon the ceiling.    \"Shall I not speak when I am moved? Ye have struck swiftly; I will draw  the arrow slowly from the wound. But, in truth, ye had good right to  wound. Naught but kindness have I had among you all; and I will answer.  Straightly have I lived since my birth. Yet betimes a torturing unrest  of mind was used to come upon me as I watched the world around us. I  saw men generous to their kind, industrious and brave, beloved by  their fellows; and I have seen these same men drink and dance and give  themselves to coarse, rough play like young dogs in a kennel. Yet, too,  I have seen dark things done in drink--the cheerful made morose, the  gentle violent. What was the temptation? What the secret? Was it but the  low craving of the flesh, or was it some primitive unrest, or craving of  the soul, which, clouded and baffled by time and labour and the wear of  life, by this means was given the witched medicament--a false freedom, a  thrilling forgetfulness? In ancient days the high, the humane, in search  of cure for poison, poisoned themselves, and then applied the antidote.  He hath little knowledge and less pity for sin who has never sinned.  The day came when all these things which other men did in my sight I  did--openly. I drank with them in the taverns--twice I drank. I met a  lass in the way. I kissed her. I sat beside her at the roadside and she  told me her brief, sad, evil story. One she had loved had left her. She  was going to London. I gave her what money I had--\"    \"And thy watch,\" said a whispering voice from the Elders' bench.    \"Even so. And at the cross-roads I bade her goodbye with sorrow.\"    \"There were those who saw,\" said the shrill voice from the bench.    \"They saw what I have said--no more. I had never tasted spirits in my  life. I had never kissed a woman's lips. Till then I had never struck my  fellow-man; but before the sun went down I fought the man who drove the  lass in sorrow into the homeless world. I did not choose to fight; but  when I begged the man Jasper Kimber for the girl's sake to follow and  bring her back, and he railed at me and made to fight me, I took off my  hat, and there I laid him in the dust.\"    \"No thanks to thee that he did not lie in his grave,\" observed the  shrill Elder.    \"In truth I hit hard,\" was the quiet reply.    \"How came thee expert with thy fists?\" asked Elder Fairley, with the  shadow of a smile.    \"A book I bought from London, a sack of corn, a hollow leather ball, and  an hour betimes with the drunken chair-maker in the hut by the lime-kiln  on the hill. He was once a sailor and a fighting man.\"    A look of blank surprise ran slowly along the faces of the Elders. They  were in a fog of misunderstanding and reprobation.    \"While yet my father\"--he looked at Luke Claridge, whom he had ever been  taught to call his father--\"shared the great business at Heddington, and  the ships came from Smyrna and Alexandria, I had some small duties, as  is well known. But that ceased, and there was little to do. Sports are  forbidden among us here, and my body grew sick, because the mind had no  labour. The world of work has thickened round us beyond the hills. The  great chimneys rise in a circle as far as eye can see on yonder crests;  but we slumber and sleep.\"    \"Enough, enough,\" said a voice from among the women. \"Thee has a friend  gone to London--thee knows the way. It leads from the cross-roads!\"    Faith Claridge, who had listened to David's speech, her heart panting,  her clear grey eyes--she had her mother's eyes--fixed benignly on him,  turned to the quarter whence the voice came. Seeing who it was--a widow  who, with no demureness, had tried without avail to bring Luke Claridge  to her--her lips pressed together in a bitter smile, and she said to her  nephew clearly:    \"Patience Spielman hath little hope of thee, David. Hope hath died in  her.\"    A faint, prim smile passed across the faces of all present, for all knew  Faith's allusion, and it relieved the tension of the past half-hour.  From the first moment David began to speak he had commanded his hearers.  His voice was low and even; but it had also a power which, when put to  sudden quiet use, compelled the hearer to an almost breathless silence,  not so much to the meaning of the words, but to the tone itself, to  the man behind it. His personal force was remarkable. Quiet and pale  ordinarily, his clear russet-brown hair falling in a wave over his  forehead, when roused, he seemed like some delicate engine made to do  great labours. As Faith said to him once, \"David, thee looks as though  thee could lift great weights lightly.\" When roused, his eyes lighted  like a lamp, the whole man seemed to pulsate. He had shocked, awed,  and troubled his listeners. Yet he had held them in his power, and was  master of their minds. The interjections had but given him new means to  defend himself. After Faith had spoken he looked slowly round.    \"I am charged with being profane,\" he said. \"I do not remember. But  is there none among you who has not secretly used profane words and,  neither in secret nor openly, has repented? I am charged with drinking.  On one day of my life I drank openly. I did it because something in me  kept crying out, 'Taste and see!' I tasted and saw, and know; and I know  that oblivion, that brief pitiful respite from trouble, which this  evil tincture gives. I drank to know; and I found it lure me into a new  careless joy. The sun seemed brighter, men's faces seemed happier,  the world sang about me, the blood ran swiftly, thoughts swarmed in  my brain. My feet were on the mountains, my hands were on the sails of  great ships; I was a conqueror. I understood the drunkard in the first  withdrawal begotten of this false stimulant. I drank to know. Is there  none among you who has, though it be but once, drunk secretly as I drank  openly? If there be none, then I am condemned.\"    \"Amen,\" said Elder Fairley's voice from the bench. \"In the open way by  the cross-roads I saw a woman. I saw she was in sorrow. I spoke to her.  Tears came to her eyes. I took her hand, and we sat down together. Of  the rest I have told you. I kissed her--a stranger. She was comely. And  this I know, that the matter ended by the cross-roads, and that by and  forbidden paths have easy travel. I kissed the woman openly--is there  none among you who has kissed secretly, and has kept the matter hidden?  For him I struck and injured, it was fair. Shall a man be beaten like a  dog? Kimber would have beaten me.\"    \"Wherein has it all profited?\" asked the shrill Elder querulously.    \"I have knowledge. None shall do these things hereafter but I shall  understand. None shall go venturing, exploring, but I shall pray for  him.\"    \"Thee will break thy heart and thy life exploring,\" said Luke Claridge  bitterly. Experiment in life he did not understand, and even Benn  Claridge's emigration to far lands had ever seemed to him a monstrous  and amazing thing, though it ended in the making of a great business in  which he himself had prospered, and from which he had now retired. He  suddenly realized that a day of trouble was at hand with this youth on  whom his heart doted, and it tortured him that he could not understand.    \"By none of these things shall I break my life,\" was David's answer now.    For a moment he stood still and silent, then all at once he stretched  out his hands to them. \"All these things I did were against our faith.  I desire forgiveness. I did them out of my own will; I will take up your  judgment. If there be no more to say, I will make ready to go to old  Soolsby's hut on the hill till the set time be passed.\"    There was a long silence. Even the shrill Elder's head was buried in  his breast. They were little likely to forego his penalty. There was  a gentle inflexibility in their natures born of long restraint  and practised determination. He must go out into blank silence and  banishment until the first day of winter. Yet, recalcitrant as they held  him, their secret hearts were with him, for there was none of them but  had had happy commerce with him; and they could think of no more bitter  punishment than to be cut off from their own society for three months.  They were satisfied he was being trained back to happiness and honour.    A new turn was given to events, however. The little wizened Elder  Meacham said: \"The flute, friend--is it here?\"    \"I have it here,\" David answered.    \"Let us have music, then.\"    \"To what end?\" interjected the shrill Elder.    \"He hath averred he can play,\" drily replied the other. \"Let us judge  whether vanity breeds untruth in him.\"    The furtive brightening of the eyes in the women was represented in  the men by an assumed look of abstraction in most; in others by a bland  assumption of judicial calm. A few, however, frowned, and would have  opposed the suggestion, but that curiosity mastered them. These watched  with darkening interest the flute, in three pieces, drawn from an inner  pocket and put together swiftly.    David raised the instrument to his lips, blew one low note, and then  a little run of notes, all smooth and soft. Mellowness and a sober"]]]
