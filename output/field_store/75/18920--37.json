Man after man came in, padded and  gloved, and looking capable of mighty things. They took guard, patted  the ground lustily, as if to make it plain that they were going to  stand no nonsense, settled their caps over their eyes, and prepared to  receive the ball. When it came it usually took a stump or two with it  before it stopped. It was a procession such as the school grounds had  not often seen. As the tenth man walked from the pavilion, four  sounded from the clock over the Great Hall, and five minutes later the  weary eyes of the supporters of Kay's were refreshed by the sight of  Fenn making his way to the arena from the direction of the School  House.    Just as he arrived on the scene, Billy Silver's defence broke down.  One of Challis's slows, which he had left alone with the idea that it  was going to break away to the off, came in quickly instead, and  removed a bail. Billy Silver had only made eight; but, as the full  score, including one bye, was only eighteen, this was above the  average, and deserved the applause it received.    Fenn came in in the unusual position of eleventh man, with an  expression on his face that seemed to suggest that he meant business.  He was curiously garbed. Owing to the shortness of the interval  allowed him for changing, he had only managed to extend his cricket  costume as far as white buckskin boots. He wore no pads or gloves. But  even in the face of these sartorial deficiencies, he looked like a  cricketer. The field spread out respectfully, and Jimmy Silver moved a  man from the slips into the country.    There were three more balls of Challis's over, for Billy Silver's  collapse had occurred at the third delivery. Fenn mistimed the first.  Two hours' writing indoors does not improve the eye. The ball missed  the leg stump by an inch.    About the fifth ball he made no mistake. He got the full face of the  bat to it, and it hummed past coverpoint to the boundary. The last of  the over he put to leg for three.    A remarkable last-wicket partnership now took place, remarkable not so  much for tall scoring as for the fact that one of the partners did not  receive a single ball from beginning to end of it, with the exception  of the one that bowled him. Fenn seemed to be able to do what he  pleased with the bowling. Kennedy he played with a shade more respect  than the others, but he never failed to score a three or a single off  the last ball of each of his overs. The figures on the telegraph-board  rose from twenty to thirty, from thirty to forty, from forty to fifty.  Williams went on at the lower end instead of Challis, and Fenn made  twelve off his first over. The pavilion was filled with howling  enthusiasts, who cheered every hit in a frenzy.    Jimmy Silver began to look worried. He held a hasty consultation with  Kennedy. The telegraph-board now showed the figures 60--9--8.    \"This won't do,\" said Silver. \"It would be too foul to get licked  after having nine of them out for eighteen. Can't you manage to keep  Fenn from scoring odd figures off the last ball of your over? If only  that kid at the other end would get some of the bowling, we should do  it.\"    \"I'll try,\" said Kennedy, and walked back to begin his over.    Fenn reached his fifty off the third ball. Seventy went up on the  board. Ten more and Kay's would have the cup. The fourth ball was too  good to hit. Fenn let it pass. The fifth he drove to the on. It was a  big hit, but there was a fieldsman in the neighbourhood. Still, it was  an easy two. But to Kennedy's surprise Fenn sent his partner back  after they had run a single. Even the umpire was surprised. Fenn's  policy was so obvious that it was strange to see him thus deliberately  allow his partner to take a ball.    \"That's not over, you know, Fenn,\" said the umpire--Lang, of the  School House, a member of the first eleven.    Fenn looked annoyed. He had miscounted the balls, and now his partner,  who had no pretensions to be considered a bat, would have to face  Kennedy.    That mistake lost Kay's the match.    Impossible as he had found it to defeat Fenn, Kennedy had never lost  his head or his length. He was bowling fully as well as he had done at  the beginning of the innings.    The last ball of the over beat the batsman all the way. He scooped  blindly forward, missed it by a foot, and the next moment the off  stump lay flat. Blackburn's had won by seven runs.          IV    HARMONY AND DISCORD      What might be described as a mixed reception awaited the players as  they left the field. The pavilion and the parts about the pavilion rails  were always packed on the last day of a final house-match, and even in  normal circumstances there was apt to be a little sparring between the  juniors of the two houses which had been playing for the cup. In the  present case, therefore, it was not surprising that Kay's fags took the  defeat badly. The thought that Fenn's presence at the beginning of the  innings, instead of at the end, would have made all the difference  between a loss and a victory, maddened them. The crowd that seethed  in front of the pavilion was a turbulent one.    For a time the operation of chairing Fenn up the steps occupied the  active minds of the Kayites. When he had disappeared into the first  eleven room, they turned their attention in other directions. Caustic  and uncomplimentary remarks began to fly to and fro between the  representatives of Kay's and Blackburn's. It is not known who actually  administered the first blow. But, when Fenn came out of the pavilion  with Kennedy and Silver, he found a stirring battle in progress. The  members of the other houses who had come to look on at the match stood  in knots, and gazed with approval at the efforts of Kay's and  Blackburn's juniors to wipe each other off the face of the earth. The  air was full of shrill battle-cries, varied now and then by a smack or  a thud, as some young but strenuous fist found a billet. The fortune  of war seemed to be distributed equally so far, and the combatants  were just warming to their work.    \"Look here,\" said Kennedy, \"we ought to stop this.\"    \"What's the good,\" said Fenn, without interest. \"It pleases them, and  doesn't hurt anybody else.\"    \"All the same,\" observed Jimmy Silver, moving towards the nearest  group of combatants, \"free fights aren't quite the thing, somehow.  For, children, you should never let your angry passions rise; your  little hands were never made to tear each other's eyes. Dr Watts'  _Advice to Young Pugilists_. Drop it, you little beasts.\"    He separated two heated youths who were just beginning a fourth round.  The rest of the warriors, seeing Silver and the others, called a  truce, and Silver, having read a sort of Riot Act, moved on. The  juniors of the beaten house, deciding that it would be better not to  resume hostilities, consoled themselves by giving three groans for Mr  Kay.    \"What happened after I left you last night, Fenn?\" asked Kennedy.    \"Oh, I had one of my usual rows with Kay, only rather worse than  usual. I said one or two things he didn't like, and today the old man  sent for me and told me to come to his room from two till four. Kay  had run me in for being 'grossly rude'. Listen to those kids. What a  row they're making!\"    \"It's a beastly shame,\" said Kennedy despondently.    At the school shop Morrell, of Mulholland's, met them. He had been  spending the afternoon with a rug and a novel on the hills at the back  of the school, and he wanted to know how the final house-match had  gone. Blackburn's had beaten Mulholland's in one of the early rounds.  Kennedy explained what had happened.    \"We should have lost if Fenn had turned up earlier,\" he said. \"He had  a row with Kay, and Kay gave him a sort of extra between two and  four.\"    Fenn, busily occupied with an ice, added no comment of his own to this  plain tale.    \"Rough luck,\" said Morrell. \"What's all that row out in the field?\"    \"That's Kay's kids giving three groans for Kay,\" explained Silver. \"At  least, they started with the idea of giving three groans. They've got  up to about three hundred by this time. It seems to have fascinated  them. They won't leave off. There's no school rule against groaning in  the grounds, and they mean to groan till the end of the term.  Personally, I like the sound. But then, I'm fond of music.\"    Morrell's face beamed with sudden pleasure. \"I knew there was  something I wanted to tell you,\" he said, \"only I couldn't remember  what. Your saying you're fond of music reminds me. Mulholland's  crocked himself, and won't be able to turn out for the concert.\"    \"What!\" cried Kennedy. \"How did it happen? What's he done?\"    Mr Mulholland was the master who looked after the music of the school,  a fine cricketer and keen sportsman. Had nothing gone wrong, he would  have conducted at the concert that night.    \"I heard it from the matron at our place,\" said Morrell. \"She's full  of it. Mulholland was batting at the middle net, and somebody else--I  forget who--was at the one next to it on the right. The bowler sent  down a long-hop to leg, and this Johnny had a smack at it, and sent it  slap through the net, and it got Mulholland on the side of the head.  He was stunned for a bit, but he's getting all right again now. But he  won't be able to conduct tonight. Rather bad luck on the man,  especially as he's so keen on the concert.\"    \"Who's going to sub for him?\" asked Silver. \"Perhaps they'll scratch  the show,\" suggested Kennedy.    \"Oh, no,\" said Morrell, \"it's all right. Kay is going to conduct. He's  often done it at choir practices when Mulholland couldn't turn up.\"    Fenn put down his empty saucer with an emphatic crack on the counter.    \"If Kay's going to run the show, I'm hanged if I turn up,\" he said.    \"My dear chap, you can't get out of it now,\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6879"],[0,"The Gold Bat (#4)"],[1,"    \"Have ye seen the baths this term,\" continued O'Hara, \"since they  shifted Dexter's house into them? The beds are in two long rows along  each wall. Moriarty's and mine are the last two at the end farthest  from the door.\"    \"Just under the gallery,\" said Trevor. \"I see.\"    \"That's it. Well, at half-past ten sharp every night Dexter sees that  we're all in, locks the door, and goes off to sleep at the Old Man's,  and we don't see him again till breakfast. He turns the gas off from  outside. At half-past seven the next morning, Smith\"--Smith was one of  the school porters--\"unlocks the door and calls us, and we go over to  the Hall to breakfast.\"    \"Well?\"    \"Well, directly everybody was asleep last night--it wasn't till after  one, as there was a rag on--Moriarty and I got up, dressed, and climbed  up into the gallery. Ye know the gallery windows? They open at the top,  an' it's rather hard to get out of them. But we managed it, and dropped  on to the gravel outside.\"    \"Long drop,\" said Clowes.    \"Yes. I hurt myself rather. But it was in a good cause. I dropped  first, and while I was on the ground, Moriarty came on top of me.  That's how I got hurt. But it wasn't much, and we cut across the  grounds, and over the fence, and down to the river. It was a fine  night, and not very dark, and everything smelt ripping down by the  river.\"    \"Don't get poetical,\" said Clowes. \"Stick to the point.\"    \"We got into the boat-house--\"    \"How?\" asked the practical Trevor, for the boat-house was wont to be  locked at one in the morning. \"Moriarty had a key that fitted,\"  explained O'Hara, briefly. \"We got in, and launched a boat--a big  tub--put in the tar and a couple of brushes--there's always tar in  the boat-house--and rowed across.\"    \"Wait a bit,\" interrupted Trevor, \"you said tar and feathers. Where did  you get the feathers?\"    \"We used leaves. They do just as well, and there were heaps on the  bank. Well, when we landed, we tied up the boat, and bucked across to  the Recreation Ground. We got over the railings--beastly, spiky  railings--and went over to the statue. Ye know where the statue stands?  It's right in the middle of the place, where everybody can see it.  Moriarty got up first, and I handed him the tar and a brush. Then I  went up with the other brush, and we began. We did his face first. It  was too dark to see really well, but I think we made a good job of it.  When we had put about as much tar on as we thought would do, we took  out the leaves--which we were carrying in our pockets--and spread them  on. Then we did the rest of him, and after about half an hour, when we  thought we'd done about enough, we got into our boat again, and came  back.\"    \"And what did you do till half-past seven?\"    \"We couldn't get back the way we'd come, so we slept in the boat-house.\"    \"Well--I'm--hanged,\" was Trevor's comment on the story.    Clowes roared with laughter. O'Hara was a perpetual joy to him.    As O'Hara was going, Trevor asked him for his gold bat.    \"You haven't lost it, I hope?\" he said.    O'Hara felt in his pocket, but brought his hand out at once and  transferred it to another pocket. A look of anxiety came over his face,  and was reflected in Trevor's.    \"I could have sworn it was in that pocket,\" he said.    \"You _haven't_ lost it?\" queried Trevor again.    \"He has,\" said Clowes, confidently. \"If you want to know where that bat  is, I should say you'd find it somewhere between the baths and the  statue. At the foot of the statue, for choice. It seems to me--correct  me if I am wrong--that you have been and gone and done it, me broth av  a bhoy.\"    O'Hara gave up the search.    \"It's gone,\" he said. \"Man, I'm most awfully sorry. I'd sooner have  lost a ten-pound note.\"    \"I don't see why you should lose either,\" snapped Trevor. \"Why the  blazes can't you be more careful.\"    O'Hara was too penitent for words. Clowes took it on himself to point  out the bright side.    \"There's nothing to get sick about, really,\" he said. \"If the thing  doesn't turn up, though it probably will, you'll simply have to tell  the Old Man that it's lost. He'll have another made. You won't be asked  for it till just before Sports Day either, so you will have plenty of  time to find it.\"    The challenge cups, and also the bats, had to be given to the  authorities before the sports, to be formally presented on Sports Day.    \"Oh, I suppose it'll be all right,\" said Trevor, \"but I hope it won't  be found anywhere near the statue.\"    O'Hara said he hoped so too.          IV    THE LEAGUE'S WARNING      The team to play in any match was always put upon the notice-board at  the foot of the stairs in the senior block a day before the date of the  fixture. Both first and second fifteens had matches on the Thursday of  this week. The second were playing a team brought down by an old  Wrykinian. The first had a scratch game.    When Barry, accompanied by M'Todd, who shared his study at Seymour's  and rarely left him for two minutes on end, passed by the notice-board  at the quarter to eleven interval, it was to the second fifteen list  that he turned his attention. Now that Bryce had left, he thought he  might have a chance of getting into the second. His only real rival, he  considered, was Crawford, of the School House, who was the other wing  three-quarter of the third fifteen. The first name he saw on the list  was Crawford's. It seemed to be written twice as large as any of the  others, and his own was nowhere to be seen. The fact that he had half  expected the calamity made things no better. He had set his heart on  playing for the second this term.    Then suddenly he noticed a remarkable phenomenon. The other wing  three-quarter was Rand-Brown. If Rand-Brown was playing for the second,  who was playing for the first?    He looked at the list.    \"_Come_ on,\" he said hastily to M'Todd. He wanted to get away  somewhere where his agitated condition would not be noticed. He felt  quite faint at the shock of seeing his name on the list of the first  fifteen. There it was, however, as large as life. \"M. Barry.\" Separated  from the rest by a thin red line, but still there. In his most  optimistic moments he had never dreamed of this. M'Todd was reading  slowly through the list of the second. He did everything slowly, except  eating.    \"Come on,\" said Barry again.    M'Todd had, after much deliberation, arrived at a profound truth. He  turned to Barry, and imparted his discovery to him in the weighty  manner of one who realises the importance of his words.    \"Look here,\" he said, \"your name's not down here.\"    \"I know. _Come_ on.\"    \"But that means you're not playing for the second.\"    \"Of course it does. Well, if you aren't coming, I'm off.\"    \"But, look here----\"    Barry disappeared through the door. After a moment's pause, M'Todd  followed him. He came up with him on the senior gravel.    \"What's up?\" he inquired.    \"Nothing,\" said Barry.    \"Are you sick about not playing for the second?\"    \"No.\"    \"You are, really. Come and have a bun.\"    In the philosophy of M'Todd it was indeed a deep-rooted sorrow that  could not be cured by the internal application of a new, hot bun. It  had never failed in his own case.    \"Bun!\" Barry was quite shocked at the suggestion. \"I can't afford to  get myself out of condition with beastly buns.\"    \"But if you aren't playing----\"    \"You ass. I'm playing for the first. Now, do you see?\"    M'Todd gaped. His mind never worked very rapidly.  \"What about  Rand-Brown, then?\" he said.    \"Rand-Brown's been chucked out. Can't you understand? You _are_ an  idiot. Rand-Brown's playing for the second, and I'm playing for the  first.\"    \"But you're----\"    He stopped. He had been going to point out that Barry's tender years--he  was only sixteen--and smallness would make it impossible for him to play  with success for the first fifteen. He refrained owing to a conviction  that the remark would not be wholly judicious. Barry was touchy on the  subject of his size, and M'Todd had suffered before now for commenting  on it in a disparaging spirit.    \"I tell you what we'll do after school,\" said Barry, \"we'll have some  running and passing. It'll do you a lot of good, and I want to practise  taking passes at full speed. You can trot along at your ordinary pace,  and I'll sprint up from behind.\"    M'Todd saw no objection to that. Trotting along at his ordinary  pace--five miles an hour--would just suit him.    \"Then after that,\" continued Barry, with a look of enthusiasm, \"I want  to practise passing back to my centre. Paget used to do it awfully well  last term, and I know Trevor expects his wing to. So I'll buck along,  and you race up to take my pass. See?\"    This was not in M'Todd's line at all. He proposed a slight alteration  in the scheme.    \"Hadn't you better get somebody else--?\" he began.    \"Don't be a slack beast,\" said Barry. \"You want exercise awfully  badly.\"    And, as M'Todd always did exactly as Barry wished, he gave in, and  spent from four-thirty to five that afternoon in the prescribed manner.  A suggestion on his part at five sharp that it wouldn't be a bad idea  to go and have some tea was not favourably received by the enthusiastic  three-quarter, who proposed to devote what time remained before lock-up  to practising drop-kicking. It was a painful alternative that faced  M'Todd. His allegiance to Barry demanded that he should consent to the  scheme. On the other hand, his allegiance to afternoon tea--equally  strong--called him back to the house, where there was cake, and also  muffins. In the end the question was solved by the appearance of  Drummond, of Seymour's, garbed in football things, and also anxious to  practise drop-kicking. So M'Todd was dismissed to his tea with  opprobrious epithets, and Barry and Drummond settled down to a little  serious and scientific work.    Making allowances for the inevitable attack of nerves that attends a"]]]
