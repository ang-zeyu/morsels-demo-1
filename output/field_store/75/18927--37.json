[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6984"],[0,"The Pothunters (#4)"],[1,"  were presented with two hundred lines apiece. Which shows more than  ever how wrong it is to bet.    The news continuing to circulate, by the end of morning school it was  generally known that a gang of desperadoes, numbering at least a  hundred, had taken the Pavilion down, brick by brick, till only the  foundations were left standing, and had gone off with every jot and  tittle of the unfortunately placed Sports prizes.    At the quarter-to-eleven interval, the School had gone _en masse_  to see what it could see, and had stared at the window with much the  same interest as they were wont to use in inspecting the First Eleven  pitch on the morning of a match--a curious custom, by the way, but one  very generally observed.    Then the official news of the extent of the robbery was spread abroad.  It appeared that the burglar had by no means done the profession  credit, for out of a vast collection of prizes ranging from the vast  and silver Mile Challenge Cup to the pair of fives-gloves with which  the 'under twelve' disciple of Deerfoot was to be rewarded, he had  selected only three. Two of these were worth having, being the  challenge cup for the quarter and the non-challenge cup for the hundred  yards, both silver, but the third was a valueless flask, and the  general voice of the School was loud in condemning the business  abilities of one who could select his swag in so haphazard a manner. It  was felt to detract from the merit of the performance. The knowing  ones, however, gave it as their opinion that the man must have been  frightened by something, and so was unable to give the matter his best  attention and do himself justice as a connoisseur.    'We had a burglary at my place once,' began Reade, of Philpott's House.  'The man--'    'That rotter, Reade,' said Barrett, also of Philpott's, 'has been  telling us that burglary chestnut of his all the morning. I wish you  chaps wouldn't encourage him.'    'Why, what was it? First I've heard of it, at any rate.' Dallas and  Vaughan, of Ward's, added themselves to the group. 'Out with it,  Reade,' said Vaughan.    'It's only a beastly reminiscence of Reade's childhood,' said Barrett.  'A burglar got into the wine-cellar and collared all the coals.'    'He didn't. He was in the hall, and my pater got his revolver--'    'While you hid under the bed.'    '--and potted at him over the banisters.'    'The last time but three you told the story, your pater fired through  the keyhole of the dining-room.'    'You idiot, that was afterwards.'    'Oh, well, what does it matter? Tell us something fresh.'    'It's my opinion,' said Dallas, 'that Ward did it. A man of the vilest  antecedents. He's capable of anything from burglary--'    'To attempted poisoning. You should see what we get to eat in Ward's  House,' said Vaughan.    'Ward's the worst type of beak. He simply lives for the sake of booking  chaps. If he books a chap out of bounds it keeps him happy for a week.'    'A man like that's bound to be a criminal of sorts in his spare time.  It's action and reaction,' said Vaughan.    Mr Ward happening to pass at this moment, the speaker went on to ask  Dallas audibly if life was worth living, and Dallas replied that under  certain conditions and in some Houses it was not.    Dallas and Vaughan did not like Mr Ward. Mr Ward was not the sort of  man who inspires affection. He had an unpleasant habit of 'jarring', as  it was called. That is to say, his conversation was shaped to one  single end, that of trying to make the person to whom he talked feel  uncomfortable. Many of his jars had become part of the School history.  There was a legend that on one occasion he had invited his prefects to  supper, and regaled them with sausages. There was still one prefect  unhelped. To him he addressed himself.    'A sausage, Jones?'    'If you please, sir.'    'No, you won't, then, because I'm going to have half myself.'    This story may or may not be true. Suffice it to say, that Mr Ward was  not popular.    The discussion was interrupted by the sound of the bell ringing for  second lesson. The problem was left unsolved. It was evident that the  burglar had been interrupted, but how or why nobody knew. The  suggestion that he had heard Master R. Robinson training for his  quarter-mile, and had thought it was an earthquake, found much favour  with the junior portion of the assembly. Simpson, on whom Robinson had  been given start in the race, expressed an opinion that he, Robinson,  ran like a cow. At which Robinson smiled darkly, and advised the other  to wait till Sports Day and then he'd see, remarking that, meanwhile,  if he gave him any of his cheek he might not be well enough to run at  all.    'This sort of thing,' said Barrett to Reade, as they walked to their  form-room, 'always makes me feel beastly. Once start a row like this,  and all the beaks turn into regular detectives and go ferreting about  all over the place, and it's ten to one they knock up against something  one doesn't want them to know about.'    Reade was feeling hurt. He had objected to the way in which Barrett had  spoiled a story that might easily have been true, and really was true  in parts. His dignity was offended. He said 'Yes' to Barrett's  observation in a tone of reserved _hauteur_. Barrett did not  notice.    'It's an awful nuisance. For one thing it makes them so jolly strict  about bounds.'    'Yes.'    'I wanted to go for a bike ride this afternoon. There's nothing on at  the School.'    'Why don't you?'    'What's the good if you can't break bounds? A ride of about a quarter  of a mile's no good. There's a ripping place about ten miles down the  Stapleton Road. Big wood, with a ripping little hollow in the middle,  all ferns and moss. I was thinking of taking a book out there for the  afternoon. Only there's roll-call.'    He paused. Ordinarily, this would have been the cue for Reade to say,  'Oh, I'll answer your name at roll-call.' But Reade said nothing.  Barrett looked surprised and disappointed.    'I say, Reade,' he said.    'Well?'    'Would you like to answer my name at roll-call?' It was the first time  he had ever had occasion to make the request.    'No,' said Reade.    Barrett could hardly believe his ears. Did he sleep? Did he dream? Or  were visions about?    'What!' he said.    No answer.    'Do you mean to say you won't?'    'Of course I won't. Why the deuce should I do your beastly dirty work  for you?'    Barrett did not know what to make of this. Curiosity urged him to ask  for explanations. Dignity threw cold water on such a scheme. In the end  dignity had the best of it.    'Oh, very well,' he said, and they went on in silence. In all the three  years of their acquaintance they had never before happened upon such a  crisis.    The silence lasted until they reached the form-room. Then Barrett  determined, in the interests of the common good--he and Reade shared a  study, and icy coolness in a small study is unpleasant--to chain up  Dignity for the moment, and give Curiosity a trial.    'What's up with you today?' he asked.    He could hardly have chosen a worse formula. The question has on most  people precisely the same effect as that which the query, 'Do you know  where you lost it?' has on one who is engaged in looking for mislaid  property.    'Nothing,' said Reade. Probably at the same moment hundreds of other  people were making the same reply, in the same tone of voice, to the  same question.    'Oh,' said Barrett.    There was another silence.    'You might as well answer my name this afternoon,' said Barrett,  tentatively.    Reade walked off without replying, and Barrett went to his place  feeling that curiosity was a fraud, and resolving to confine his  attentions for the future to dignity. This was by-product number one of  the Pavilion burglary.          [4]    CERTAIN REVELATIONS      During the last hour of morning school, Tony got a note from Jim.    'Graham,' said Mr Thompson, the master of the Sixth, sadly, just as  Tony was about to open it.    'Yes, sir?'    'Kindly tear that note up, Graham.'    'Note, sir?'    'Kindly tear that note up, Graham. Come, you are keeping us waiting.'    As the hero of the novel says, further concealment was useless. Tony  tore the note up unread.    'Hope it didn't want an answer,' he said to Jim after school. 'Constant  practice has made Thompson a sort of amateur lynx.'    'No. It was only to ask you to be in the study directly after lunch.  There's a most unholy row going to occur shortly, as far as I can see.'    'What, about this burglary business?'    'Yes. Haven't time to tell you now. See you after lunch.'    After lunch, having closed the study door, Jim embarked on the  following statement.    It appeared that on the previous night he had left a book of notes,  which were of absolutely vital importance for the examination which the  Sixth had been doing in the earlier part of the morning, in the  identical room in which the prizes had been placed. Or rather, he had  left it there several days before, and had not needed it till that  night. At half-past six the Pavilion had been locked up, and Biffen,  the ground-man, had taken the key away with him, and it was only after  tea had been consumed and the evening paper read, that Jim, thinking it  about time to begin work, had discovered his loss. This was about  half-past seven.    Being a House-prefect, Jim did not attend preparation in the Great Hall  with the common herd of the Houses, but was part-owner with Tony of a  study.    The difficulties of the situation soon presented themselves to  him. It was only possible to obtain the notes in three ways--firstly,  by going to the rooms of the Sixth Form master, who lived out of  College; secondly, by borrowing from one of the other Sixth Form  members of the House; and thirdly, by the desperate expedient of  burgling the Pavilion. The objections to the first course were two. In  the first place Merevale"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6985"],[0,"A Prefect's Uncle (#4)"],[1,"than himself, and manifestly a youth with a fine taste in  cheek, was not pleasant.    'Of course,' said his uncle. 'What did you think I was going to do?  Camp out on the platform?'    'What House are you in?'    'Leicester's.'    The worst had happened. The bitter cup was full, the iron neatly  inserted in Gethryn's soul. In his most pessimistic moments he had  never looked forward to the coming term so gloomily as he did now. His  uncle noted his lack of enthusiasm, and attributed it to anxiety on  behalf of himself.    'What's up?' he asked. 'Isn't Leicester's all right? Is Leicester a  beast?'    'No. He's a perfectly decent sort of man. It's a good enough House. At  least it will be this term. I was only thinking of something.'    'I see. Well, how do you get to the place?'    'Walk. It isn't far.'    'How far?'    'Three miles.'    'The porter said four.'    'It may be four. I never measured it.'    'Well, how the dickens do you think I'm going to walk four miles with  luggage? I wish you wouldn't rot.'    And before Gethryn could quite realize that he, the head of  Leicester's, the second-best bowler in the School, and the best centre  three-quarter the School had had for four seasons, had been requested  in a peremptory manner by a youth of fourteen, a mere kid, not to rot,  the offender was talking to a cabman out of the reach of retaliation.  Gethryn became more convinced every minute that this was no ordinary  kid.    'This man says,' observed Farnie, returning to Gethryn, 'that he'll  drive me up to the College for seven bob. As it's a short four miles,  and I've only got two boxes, it seems to me that he's doing himself  fairly well. What do you think?'    'Nobody ever gives more than four bob,' said Gethryn.    'I told you so,' said Farnie to the cabman. 'You are a bally swindler,'  he added admiringly.    'Look 'ere,' began the cabman, in a pained voice.    'Oh, dry up,' said Farnie. 'Want a lift, Gethryn?'    The words were spoken not so much as from equal to equal as in a tone  of airy patronage which made the Bishop's blood boil. But as he  intended to instil a few words of wisdom into his uncle's mind, he did  not refuse the offer.    The cabman, apparently accepting the situation as one of those slings  and arrows of outrageous fortune which no man can hope to escape,  settled down on the box, clicked up his horse, and drove on towards the  College.    'What sort of a hole is Beckford?' asked Farnie, after the silence had  lasted some time.    'I find it good enough personally,' said Gethryn. 'If you'd let us know  earlier that you were coming, we'd have had the place done up a bit for  you.'    This, of course, was feeble, distinctly feeble. But the Bishop was not  feeling himself. The essay in sarcasm left the would-be victim entirely  uncrushed. He should have shrunk and withered up, or at the least have  blushed. But he did nothing of the sort. He merely smiled in his  supercilious way, until the Bishop felt very much inclined to spring  upon him and throw him out of the cab.    There was another pause.    'Farnie,' began Gethryn at last.    'Um?'    'Doesn't it strike you that for a kid like you you've got a good deal  of edge on?' asked Gethryn.    Farnie effected a masterly counter-stroke. He pretended not to be able  to hear. He was sorry, but would the Bishop mind repeating his remark.    'Eh? What?' he said. 'Very sorry, but this cab's making such a row. I  say, cabby, why don't you sign the pledge, and save your money up to  buy a new cab? Eh? Oh, sorry! I wasn't listening.' Now, inasmuch as the  whole virtue of the 'wretched-little-kid-like-you' argument lies in the  crisp despatch with which it is delivered, Gethryn began to find, on  repeating his observation for the third time, that there was not quite  so much in it as he had thought. He prudently elected to change his  style of attack.    'It doesn't matter,' he said wearily, as Farnie opened his mouth to  demand a fourth encore, 'it wasn't anything important. Now, look here,  I just want to give you a few tips about what to do when you get to the  Coll. To start with, you'll have to take off that white tie you've got  on. Black and dark blue are the only sorts allowed here.'    'How about yours then?' Gethryn was wearing a somewhat sweet thing in  brown and yellow.    'Mine happens to be a First Eleven tie.'    'Oh! Well, as a matter of fact, you know, I was going to take off my  tie. I always do, especially at night. It's a sort of habit I've got  into.'    'Not quite so much of your beastly cheek, please,' said Gethryn.    'Right-ho!' said Farnie cheerfully, and silence, broken only by the  shrieking of the cab wheels, brooded once more over the cab. Then  Gethryn, feeling that perhaps it would be a shame to jump too severely  on a new boy on his first day at a large public school, began to think  of something conciliatory to say. 'Look here,' he said, 'you'll get on  all right at Beckford, I expect. You'll find Leicester's a fairly  decent sort of House. Anyhow, you needn't be afraid you'll get bullied.  There's none of that sort of thing at School nowadays.'    'Really?'    'Yes, and there's another thing I ought to warn you about. Have you  brought much money with you?'    ''Bout fourteen pounds, I fancy,' said Farnie carelessly.    'Fourteen _what_!' said the amazed Bishop. '_Pounds!_'    'Or sovereigns,' said Farnie. 'Each worth twenty shillings, you know.'    For a moment Gethryn's only feeling was one of unmixed envy. Previously  he had considered himself passing rich on thirty shillings a term. He  had heard legends, of course, of individuals who come to School  bursting with bullion, but never before had he set eyes upon such an  one. But after a time it began to dawn upon him that for a new boy at a  public school, and especially at such a House as Leicester's had become  under the rule of the late Reynolds and his predecessors, there might  be such a thing as having too much money.    'How the deuce did you get all that?' he asked.    'My pater gave it me. He's absolutely cracked on the subject of  pocket-money. Sometimes he doesn't give me a sou, and sometimes he'll  give me whatever I ask for.'    'But you don't mean to say you had the cheek to ask for fourteen quid?'    'I asked for fifteen. Got it, too. I've spent a pound of it. I said I  wanted to buy a bike. You can get a jolly good bike for five quid  about, so you see I scoop ten pounds. What?'    This ingenious, if slightly unscrupulous, feat gave Gethryn an insight  into his uncle's character which up till now he had lacked. He began to  see that the moral advice with which he had primed himself would be out  of place. Evidently this youth could take quite good care of himself on  his own account. Still, even a budding Professor Moriarty would be none  the worse for being warned against Gethryn's _bete noire_, Monk,  so the Bishop proceeded to deliver that warning.    'Well,' he said, 'you seem to be able to look out for yourself all  right, I must say. But there's one tip I really can give you. When you  get to Leicester's, and a beast with a green complexion and an oily  smile comes up and calls you \"Old Cha-a-p\", and wants you to swear  eternal friendship, tell him it's not good enough. Squash him!'    'Thanks,' said Farnie. 'Who is this genial merchant?'    'Chap called Monk. You'll recognize him by the smell of scent. When you  find the place smelling like an Eau-de-Cologne factory, you'll know  Monk's somewhere near. Don't you have anything to do with him.'    'You seem to dislike the gentleman.'    'I bar the man. But that isn't why I'm giving you the tip to steer  clear of him. There are dozens of chaps I bar who haven't an ounce of  vice in them. And there are one or two chaps who have got tons. Monk's  one of them. A fellow called Danvers is another. Also a beast of the  name of Waterford. There are some others as well, but those are the  worst of the lot. By the way, I forgot to ask, have you ever been to  school before?'    'Yes,' said Farnie, in the dreamy voice of one who recalls memories  from the misty past, 'I was at Harrow before I came here, and at  Wellington before I went to Harrow, and at Clifton before I went to  Wellington.'    Gethryn gasped.    'Anywhere before you went to Clifton?' he enquired.    'Only private schools.'    The recollection of the platitudes which he had been delivering, under  the impression that he was talking to an entirely raw beginner, made  Gethryn feel slightly uncomfortable. What must this wanderer, who had  seen men and cities, have thought of his harangue?    'Why did you leave Harrow?' asked he.    'Sacked,' was the laconic reply.    Have you ever, asks a modern philosopher, gone upstairs in the dark,  and trodden on the last step when it wasn't there? That sensation and  the one Gethryn felt at this unexpected revelation were identical. And  the worst of it was that he felt the keenest desire to know why Harrow  had seen fit to dispense with the presence of his uncle.    'Why?' he began. 'I mean,' he went on hurriedly, 'why did you leave  Wellington?'    'Sacked,' said Farnie again, with the monotonous persistence of a  Solomon Eagle.    Gethryn felt at this juncture much as the unfortunate gentleman in  _Punch_ must have felt, when, having finished a humorous story,  the point of which turned upon squinting and red noses, he suddenly  discovered that his host enjoyed both those peculiarities. He struggled  manfully with his feelings for a time. Tact urged him to discontinue  his investigations and talk about the weather. Curiosity insisted upon  knowing further details. Just as the struggle was at its height, Farnie  came unexpectedly to the rescue.    'It may interest you,' he said, 'to know that I was not sacked from  Clifton.'    Gethryn with some difficulty refrained from thanking him for the  information.    'I never stop at a school long,' said Farnie. 'If I don't get sacked my"]]]
