Jelliffe was regarding him with a kind of awe.    'Laddie,' he said, in a hushed voice, 'you almost scare me. There seems  to be no limit to your powers as a mascot. You fill the house every  night, you get rid of the Weaver woman, and now you tell me this. I  drew Crane in the sweep, and I would have taken twopence for my chance  of winning it.'    'I shall get a telegram from my boss tomorrow recalling me.'    'Don't go. Stick with me. Join the troupe.'    Henry stared.    'What do you mean? I can't sing or act.'    Jelliffe's voice thrilled with earnestness.    'My boy, I can go down the Strand and pick up a hundred fellows who can  sing and act. I don't want them. I turn them away. But a seventh son of  a seventh son like you, a human horseshoe like you, a king of mascots  like you--they don't make them nowadays. They've lost the pattern. If  you like to come with me I'll give you a contract for any number of  years you suggest. I need you in my business.' He rose. 'Think it over,  laddie, and let me know tomorrow. Look here upon this picture, and on  that. As a sleuth you are poor. You couldn't detect a bass-drum in a  telephone-booth. You have no future. You are merely among those  present. But as a mascot--my boy, you're the only thing in sight. You  can't help succeeding on the stage. You don't have to know how to act.  Look at the dozens of good actors who are out of jobs. Why? Unlucky. No  other reason. With your luck and a little experience you'll be a star  before you know you've begun. Think it over, and let me know in the  morning.'    Before Henry's eyes there rose a sudden vision of Alice: Alice no  longer unattainable; Alice walking on his arm down the aisle; Alice  mending his socks; Alice with her heavenly hands fingering his salary  envelope.    'Don't go,' he said. 'Don't go. I'll let you know now.'           *       *       *       *       *    The scene is the Strand, hard by Bedford Street; the time, that restful  hour of the afternoon when they of the gnarled faces and the bright  clothing gather together in groups to tell each other how good they  are.

There in seven words you have a  complete character sketch of my Aunt Agatha. I could go on indefinitely  about brutality and lack of consideration. I merely say that she routed  me out of bed to listen to her painful story somewhere in the small  hours. It can't have been half past eleven when Jeeves, my man, woke me  out of the dreamless and broke the news:    'Mrs Gregson to see you, sir.'    I thought she must be walking in her sleep, but I crawled out of bed  and got into a dressing-gown. I knew Aunt Agatha well enough to know  that, if she had come to see me, she was going to see me. That's the  sort of woman she is.    She was sitting bolt upright in a chair, staring into space. When I  came in she looked at me in that darn critical way that always makes me  feel as if I had gelatine where my spine ought to be. Aunt Agatha is  one of those strong-minded women. I should think Queen Elizabeth must  have been something like her. She bosses her husband, Spencer Gregson,  a battered little chappie on the Stock Exchange. She bosses my cousin,  Gussie Mannering-Phipps. She bosses her sister-in-law, Gussie's mother.  And, worst of all, she bosses me. She has an eye like a man-eating  fish, and she has got moral suasion down to a fine point.    I dare say there are fellows in the world--men of blood and iron, don't  you know, and all that sort of thing--whom she couldn't intimidate; but  if you're a chappie like me, fond of a quiet life, you simply curl into  a ball when you see her coming, and hope for the best. My experience is  that when Aunt Agatha wants you to do a thing you do it, or else you  find yourself wondering why those fellows in the olden days made such a  fuss when they had trouble with the Spanish Inquisition.    'Halloa, Aunt Agatha!' I said    'Bertie,' she said, 'you look a sight. You look perfectly dissipated.'    I was feeling like a badly wrapped brown-paper parcel. I'm never at my  best in the early morning. I said so.    'Early morning! I had breakfast three hours ago, and have been walking  in the park ever since, trying to compose my thoughts.'    If I ever breakfasted at half past eight I should walk on the  Embankment, trying to end it all in a watery grave.    'I am extremely worried, Bertie. That is why I have come to you.'    And then I saw she was going to start something, and I bleated weakly  to Jeeves to bring me tea. But she had begun before I could get it.    'What are your immediate plans, Bertie?'    'Well, I rather thought of tottering out for a bite of lunch later on,  and then possibly staggering round to the club, and after that, if I  felt strong enough, I might trickle off to Walton Heath for a round of  golf.'    I am not interested in your totterings and tricklings. I mean, have you  any important engagements in the next week or so?'    I scented danger.    'Rather,' I said. 'Heaps! Millions! Booked solid!'    'What are they?'    'I--er--well, I don't quite know.'    'I thought as much. You have no engagements. Very well, then, I want  you to start immediately for America.'    'America!'    Do not lose sight of the fact that all this was taking place on an  empty stomach, shortly after the rising of the lark.    'Yes, America. I suppose even you have heard of America?'    'But why America?'    'Because that is where your Cousin Gussie is. He is in New York, and I  can't get at him.'    'What's Gussie been doing?'    'Gussie is making a perfect idiot of himself.'    To one who knew young Gussie as well as I did, the words opened up a  wide field for speculation.    'In what way?'    'He has lost his head over a creature.'    On past performances this rang true. Ever since he arrived at man's  estate Gussie had been losing his head over creatures. He's that sort  of chap. But, as the creatures never seemed to lose their heads over  him, it had never amounted to much.    'I imagine you know perfectly well why Gussie went to America, Bertie.  You know how wickedly extravagant your Uncle Cuthbert was.'    She alluded to Gussie's governor, the late head of the family, and I am  bound to say she spoke the truth. Nobody was fonder of old Uncle  Cuthbert than I was, but everybody knows that, where money was  concerned, he was the most complete chump in the annals of the nation.  He had an expensive thirst. He never backed a horse that didn't get  housemaid's knee in the middle of the race. He had a system of beating  the bank at Monte Carlo which used to make the administration hang out  the bunting and ring the joy-bells when he was sighted in the offing.  Take him for all in all, dear old Uncle Cuthbert was as willing a  spender as ever called the family lawyer a bloodsucking vampire because  he wouldn't let Uncle Cuthbert cut down the timber to raise another  thousand.    'He left your Aunt Julia very little money for a woman in her  position. Beechwood requires a great deal of keeping up, and  poor dear Spencer, though he does his best to help, has not  unlimited resources. It was clearly understood why Gussie went  to America. He is not clever, but he is very good-looking, and,  though he has no title, the Mannering-Phippses are one of the best  and oldest families in England. He had some excellent letters of  introduction, and when he wrote home to say that he had met the  most charming and beautiful girl in the world I felt quite happy.  He continued to rave about her for several mails, and then this  morning a letter has come from him in which he says, quite casually  as a sort of afterthought, that he knows we are broadminded enough  not to think any the worse of her because she is on the vaudeville  stage.'    'Oh, I say!'    'It was like a thunderbolt. The girl's name, it seems, is Ray Denison,  and according to Gussie she does something which he describes as a  single on the big time. What this degraded performance may be I have  not the least notion. As a further recommendation he states that she  lifted them out of their seats at Mosenstein's last week. Who she may  be, and how or why, and who or what Mr Mosenstein may be, I cannot tell  you.'    'By jove,' I said, 'it's like a sort of thingummybob, isn't it? A sort  of fate, what?'    'I fail to understand you.'    'Well, Aunt Julia, you know, don't you know? Heredity, and so forth.  What's bred in the bone will come out in the wash, and all that kind of  thing, you know.'    'Don't be absurd, Bertie.'    That was all very well, but it was a coincidence for all that. Nobody  ever mentions it, and the family have been trying to forget it for  twenty-five years, but it's a known fact that my Aunt Julia, Gussie's  mother, was a vaudeville artist once, and a very good one, too, I'm  told. She was playing in pantomime at Drury Lane when Uncle Cuthbert  saw her first. It was before my time, of course, and long before I was  old enough to take notice the family had made the best of it, and Aunt  Agatha had pulled up her socks and put in a lot of educative work, and  with a microscope you couldn't tell Aunt Julia from a genuine  dyed-in-the-wool aristocrat. Women adapt themselves so quickly!    I have a pal who married Daisy Trimble of the Gaiety, and when I meet  her now I feel like walking out of her presence backwards. But there  the thing was, and you couldn't get away from it. Gussie had vaudeville  blood in him, and it looked as if he were reverting to type,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7477"],[0,"The Book of Wonder (#4)"],[1,"y. A glance of longing, no  more, each gave to the beautiful berries. The guardian upon his  pedestal was still asleep. Slorg climbed by a ladder, that Slith knew  where to find, to the iron clamp across the crack in the World, and  waited beside it with a chisel in his hand, listening closely for  anything untoward, while his friends slipped into the house; and no  sound came. And presently Slith and Sippy found the golden box:  everything seemed happening as they had planned, it only remained to  see if it was the right one and to escape with it from that dreadful  place. Under the shelter of the pedestal, so near to the guardian that  they could feel his warmth, which paradoxically had the effect of  chilling the blood of the boldest of them, they smashed the emerald  hasp and opened the golden box; and there they read by the light of  ingenious sparks which Slith knew how to contrive, and even this poor  light they hid with their bodies. What was their joy, even at that  perilous moment, as they lurked between the guardian and the abyss, to  find that the box contained fifteen peerless odes in the alcaic form,  five sonnets that were by far the most beautiful in the world, nine  ballads in the manner of Provence that had no equal in the treasuries  of man, a poem addressed to a moth in twenty-eight perfect stanzas, a  piece of blank verse of over a hundred lines on a level not yet known  to have been attained by man, as well as fifteen lyrics on which no  merchant would dare to set a price. They would have read them again,  for they gave happy tears to a man and memories of dear things done in  infancy, and brought sweet voices from far sepulchres; but Slith  pointed imperiously to the way by which they had come, and  extinguished the light; and Slorg and Sippy sighed, then took the box.    The guardian still slept the sleep that survived a thousand years.    As they came away they saw that indulgent chair close by the edge of  the World in which Owner of the Box had lately sat reading  selfishly and alone the most beautiful songs and verses that poet ever  dreamed.    They came in silence to the foot of the stairs; and then it befell  that as they drew near safely, in the night's most secret hour, some  hand in an upper chamber lit a shocking light, lit it and made no  sound.    For a moment it might have been an ordinary light, fatal as even that  could very well be at such a moment as this; but when it began to  follow them like an eye and to grow redder and redder as it watched  them, then even optimism despaired.    And Sippy very unwisely attempted flight, and Slorg even as unwisely  tried to hide; but Slith, knowing well why that light was lit in that  secret upper chamber and _who_ it was that lit it, leaped over the edge  of the World and is falling from us still through the unreverberate  blackness of the abyss.        THE INJUDICIOUS PRAYERS OF POMBO THE IDOLATER      Pombo the idolater had prayed to Ammuz a simple prayer, a necessary  prayer, such as even an idol of ivory could very easily grant, and  Ammuz had not immediately granted it. Pombo had therefore prayed to  Tharma for the overthrow of Ammuz, an idol friendly to Tharma, and in  doing this offended against the etiquette of the gods. Tharma refused  to grant the little prayer. Pombo prayed frantically to all the gods  of idolatry, for though it was a simple matter, yet it was very  necessary to a man. And gods that were older than Ammuz rejected the  prayers of Pombo, and even gods that were younger and therefore of  greater repute. He prayed to them one by one, and they all refused to  hear him; nor at first did he think at all of that subtle, divine  etiquette against which he had offended. It occurred to him all at  once as he prayed to his fiftieth idol, a little green-jade god whom  the Chinese know, that all the idols were in league against him. When  Pombo discovered this he resented his birth bitterly, and made  lamentation and alleged that he was lost. He might have been seen then  in any part of London haunting curiosity-shops and places where they  sold idols of ivory or of stone, for he dwelt in London with others of  his race though he was born in Burmah among those who hold Ganges  holy. On drizzly evenings of November's worst his haggard face could  be seen in the glow of some shop pressed close against the glass,  where he would supplicate some calm, cross-legged idol till policemen  moved him on. And after closing hours back he would go to his dingy  room, in that part of our capital where English is seldom spoken, to  supplicate little idols of his own. And when Pombo's simple, necessary  prayer was equally refused by the idols of museums, auction-rooms,  shops, then he took counsel with himself and purchased incense and  burned it in a brazier before his own cheap little idols, and played  the while upon an instrument such as that wherewith men charm snakes.  And still the idols clung to their etiquette.    Whether Pombo knew about this etiquette and considered it frivolous in  the face of his need, or whether his need, now grown desperate,  unhinged his mind, I know not, but Pombo the idolater took a stick and  suddenly turned iconoclast.    Pombo the iconoclast immediately left his house, leaving his idols to  be swept away with the dust and so to mingle with Man, and went to an  arch-idolater of repute who carved idols out of rare stones, and put  his case before him. The arch-idolater who made idols of his own  rebuked Pombo in the name of Man for having broken his idols--\"for  hath not Man made them?\" the arch-idolater said; and concerning the  idols themselves he spoke long and learnedly, explaining divine  etiquette, and how Pombo had offended, and how no idol in the world  would listen to Pombo's prayer. When Pombo heard this he wept and made  bitter outcry, and cursed the gods of ivory and the gods of jade, and  the hand of Man that made them, but most of all he cursed their  etiquette that had undone, as he said, an innocent man; so that at  last that arch-idolater, who made idols of his own, stopped in his  work upon an idol of jasper for a king that was weary of Wosh, and  took compassion on Pombo, and told him that though no idol in the  world would listen to his prayer, yet only a little way over the edge  of it a certain disreputable idol sat who knew nothing of etiquette,  and granted prayers that no respectable god would ever consent to  hear. When Pombo heard this he took two handfuls of the  arch-idolater's beard and kissed them joyfully, and dried his tears  and became his old impertinent self again. And he that carved from  jasper the usurper of Wosh explained how in the village of World's  End, at the furthest end of Last Street, there is a hole that you take  to be a well, close by the garden wall, but that if you lower yourself  by your hands over the edge of the hole, and feel about with your feet  till they find a ledge, that is the top step of a flight of stairs  that takes you down over the edge of the World. \"For all that men  know, those stairs may have a purpose and even a bottom step,\" said  the arch-idolater, \"but discussion about the lower flights is idle.\"  Then the teeth of Pombo chattered, for he feared the darkness, but he  that made idols of his own explained that those stairs were always lit  by the faint blue gloaming in which the World spins. \"Then,\" he said,  \"you will go by Lonely House and under the bridge that leads from the  House to Nowhere, and whose purpose is not guessed; thence past  Maharrion, the god of flowers, and his high-priest, who is neither  bird nor cat; and so you will come to the little idol Duth, the  disreputable god that will grant your prayer.\" And he went on carving  again at his idol of jasper for the king who was weary of Wosh; and  Pombo thanked him and went singing away, for in his vernacular mind he  thought that \"he _had_ the gods.\"    It is a long journey from London to World's End, and Pombo had no  money left, yet within five weeks he was strolling along Last  Street; but how he contrived to get there I will not say, for it was  not entirely honest. And Pombo found the well at the end of the garden  beyond the end house of Last Street, and many thoughts ran through his  mind as he hung by his hands from the edge, but chiefest of all those  thoughts was one that said the gods were laughing at him through the  mouth of the arch-idolater, their prophet, and the thought beat in his  head till it ached like his wrists ... and then he found the step.    And Pombo walked downstairs. There, sure enough, was the gloaming in  which the world spins, and stars shone far off in it faintly;  there was nothing before him as he went downstairs but that strange  blue waste of gloaming, with its multitudes of stars, and comets  plunging through it on outward journeys and comets returning home. And  then he saw the lights of the bridge to Nowhere, and all of a sudden  he was in the glare of the shimmering parlour-window of Lonely House;  and he heard voices there pronouncing words, and the voices were  nowise human, and but for his bitter need he had screamed and fled.  Halfway between the voices and Maharrion, whom he now saw standing out  from the world, covered in rainbow halos, he perceived the weird grey  beast that is neither cat nor bird. As Pombo hesitated, chilly with  fear, he heard those voices grow louder in Lonely House, and at that  he stealthily moved a few steps lower, and then rushed past the beast.  The beast intently watched Maharrion hurling up bubbles that are every  one a season of spring in unknown constellations, calling the swallows  home to unimagined fields, watched him without even turning to look at  Pombo, and saw him drop into the Linlunlarna, the river that rises at  the edge of the World, the golden pollen that sweetens the tide of the  river and is carried away from the World to be a joy to the Stars. And  there before"]]]
