We  clinched the dicker then and there.  I passed her over your  hundred and ten dollars--she took the money without turning a  hair--and now you are the joint owners of Fatima.  Good luck to  your bargain!\"    \"Mean old thing,\" sniffed Ismay.  She meant Aunt Cynthia, and,  remembering our shabby furs, I didn't disagree with her.    \"But there is no Fatima,\" I said, dubiously.  \"How shall we  account for her when Aunt Cynthia comes home?\"    \"Well, your aunt isn't coming home for a month yet.  When she  comes you will have to tell her that the cat--is lost--but you  needn't say WHEN it happened.  As for the rest, Fatima is your  property now, so Aunt Cynthia can't grumble.  But she will have a  poorer opinion than ever of your fitness to run a house alone.\"    When Max left I went to the window to watch him down the path.  He was really a handsome fellow, and I was proud of him.  At the  gate he turned to wave me good-by, and, as he did, he glanced  upward.  Even at that distance I saw the look of amazement on his  face.  Then he came bolting back.    \"Ismay, the house is on fire!\" I shrieked, as I flew to the door.    \"Sue,\" cried Max, \"I saw Fatima, or her ghost, at the garret  window a moment ago!\"    \"Nonsense!\" I cried.  But Ismay was already half way up the  stairs and we followed.  Straight to the garret we rushed.  There  sat Fatima, sleek and complacent, sunning herself in the window.    Max laughed until the rafters rang.    \"She can't have been up here all this time,\" I protested, half  tearfully.  \"We would have heard her meowing.\"    \"But you didn't,\" said Max.    \"She would have died of the cold,\" declared Ismay.    \"But she hasn't,\" said Max.    \"Or starved,\" I cried.    \"The place is alive with mice,\" said Max.  \"No, girls, there is  no doubt the cat has been here the whole fortnight.  She must  have followed Huldah Jane up here, unobserved, that day.  It's a  wonder you didn't hear her crying--if she did cry.  But perhaps  she didn't, and, of course, you sleep downstairs.  To think you  never thought of looking here for her!\"    \"It has cost us over a hundred dollars,\" said Ismay, with a  malevolent glance at the sleek Fatima.    \"It has cost me more than that,\" I said, as I turned to the  stairway.    Max held me back for an instant, while Ismay and Fatima pattered  down.    \"Do you think it has cost too much, Sue?\" he whispered.    I looked at him sideways.  He was really a dear. Niceness fairly  exhaled from him.    \"No-o-o,\" I said, \"but when we are married you will have to take  care of Fatima, _I_ won't.\"    \"Dear Fatima,\" said Max gratefully.        II. THE MATERIALIZING OF CECIL    It had never worried me in the least that I wasn't married,  although everybody in Avonlea pitied old maids; but it DID worry  me, and I frankly confess it, that I had never had a chance to  be.  Even Nancy, my old nurse and servant, knew that, and pitied  me for it.  Nancy is an old maid herself, but she has had two  proposals.  She did not accept either of them because one was a  widower with seven children, and the other a very shiftless,  good-for-nothing fellow; but, if anybody twitted Nancy on her  single condition, she could point triumphantly to those two as  evidence that \"she could an she would.\"  If I had not lived all  my life in Avonlea I might have had the benefit of the doubt; but  I had, and everybody knew everything about me--or thought they  did.    I had really often wondered why nobody had ever fallen in love  with me.  I was not at all homely; indeed, years ago, George  Adoniram Maybrick had written a poem addressed to me, in which he  praised my beauty quite extravagantly; that didn't mean anything  because George Adoniram wrote poetry to all the good-looking  girls and never went with anybody but Flora King, who was  cross-eyed and red-haired, but it proves that it was not my  appearance that put me out of the running.  Neither was it the  fact that I wrote poetry myself--although not of George  Adoniram's kind--because nobody ever knew that.  When I felt it  coming on I shut myself up in my room and wrote it out in a  little blank book I kept locked up.  It is nearly full now,  because I have been writing poetry all my life.  It is the only  thing I have ever been able to keep a secret from Nancy.  Nancy,  in any case, has not a very high opinion of my ability to take  care of myself; but I tremble to imagine what she would think if  she ever found out about that little book.  I am convinced she  would send for the doctor post-haste and insist on mustard  plasters while waiting for him.    Nevertheless, I kept on at it, and what with my flowers and my  cats and my magazines and my little book, I was really very happy  and contented.  But it DID sting that Adella Gilbert, across the  road, who has a drunken husband, should pity \"poor Charlotte\"  because nobody had ever wanted her.  Poor Charlotte indeed!  If I  had thrown myself at a man's head the way Adella Gilbert did at--but  there, there, I must refrain from such thoughts.  I must not  be uncharitable.    The Sewing Circle met at Mary Gillespie's on my fortieth  birthday.  I have given up talking about my birthdays, although  that little scheme is not much good in Avonlea where everybody  knows your age--or if they make a mistake it is never on the side  of youth.  But Nancy, who grew accustomed to celebrating my  birthdays when I was a little girl, never gets over the habit,  and I don't try to cure her, because, after all, it's nice to  have some one make a fuss over you.  She brought me up my  breakfast before I got up out of bed--a concession to my laziness  that Nancy would scorn to make on any other day of the year.  She  had cooked everything I like best, and had decorated the tray  with roses from the garden and ferns from the woods behind the  house.  I enjoyed every bit of that breakfast, and then I got up  and dressed, putting on my second best muslin gown.  I would have  put on my really best if I had not had the fear of Nancy before  my eyes; but I knew she would never condone THAT, even on a  birthday.  I watered my flowers and fed my cats, and then I  locked myself up and wrote a poem on June.  I had given up  writing birthday odes after I was thirty.    In the afternoon I went to the Sewing Circle.  When I was ready  for it I looked in my glass and wondered if I could really be  forty.  I was quite sure I didn't look it.  My hair was brown and  wavy, my cheeks were pink, and the lines could hardly be seen at  all, though possibly that was because of the dim light.  I always  have my mirror hung in the darkest corner of my room.  Nancy  cannot imagine why.  I know the lines are there, of course; but  when they don't show very plain I forget that they are there.    We had a large Sewing Circle, young and old alike attending.  I  really cannot say I ever enjoyed the meetings--at least not up to  that time--although I went religiously because I thought it my  duty to go.  The married women talked so much of their husbands  and children, and of course I had to be quiet on those topics;  and the young girls talked in corner groups about their beaux,  and stopped it when I joined them, as if they felt sure that an  old maid who had never had a beau couldn't understand at all.  As  for the other old maids, they talked gossip about every one, and  I did not like that either.  I knew the minute my back was turned  they would fasten into me and hint that I used hair-dye and  declare it was perfectly ridiculous for a woman of FIFTY to wear  a pink muslin dress with lace-trimmed frills.    There was a full attendance that day, for we were getting ready  for a sale of fancy work in aid of parsonage repairs.  The young  girls were merrier and noisier than usual.  Wilhelmina Mercer was  there, and she kept them going.  The Mercers were quite new to  Avonlea, having come here only two months previously.    I was sitting by the window and Wilhelmina Mercer, Maggie  Henderson, Susette Cross and Georgie Hall were in a little group  just before me.  I wasn't listening to their chatter at all, but  presently Georgie exclaimed teasingly:    \"Miss Charlotte is laughing at us.  I suppose she thinks we are  awfully silly to be talking about beaux.\"    The truth was that I was simply smiling over some very pretty  thoughts that had come to me about the roses which were climbing  over Mary Gillespie's sill.  I meant to inscribe them in the  little blank book when I went home.  Georgie's speech brought me  back to harsh realities with a jolt.  It hurt me, as such  speeches always did.    \"Didn't you ever have a beau, Miss Holmes?\" said Wilhelmina  laughingly.    Just as it happened, a silence had fallen over the room for a  moment, and everybody in it heard Wilhelmina's question.    I really do not know what got into me and possessed me.  I have  never been able to account for what I said and did, because I am  naturally a truthful person and hate all deceit.  It seemed to me  that I simply could not say \"No\" to Wilhelmina before that whole  roomful of women.  It was TOO humiliating.  I suppose all the  prickles and stings and slurs I had endured for fifteen years on  account of never having had a lover had what the new doctor calls  \"a cumulative effect\" and came to a head then and there.    \"Yes, I had one once, my dear,\" I said calmly.    For once in my life I made a sensation.  Every woman in that room  stopped sewing and stared at me.  Most of them, I saw, didn't  believe me, but Wilhelmina did.  Her pretty face lighted up with  interest.    \"Oh, won't you tell us about him, Miss Holmes?\" she coaxed, \"and  why didn't you marry him?\"    \"That is right, Miss Mercer,\" said Josephine Cameron, with a  nasty little laugh.  \"Make her tell.  We're all interested.  It's  news to us that Charlotte ever had a beau.\"    If Josephine had not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5341"],[0,"Kilmeny of the Orchard (#4)"],[1,"up yet, and who,  according to all reports, have not yet had the old Adam totally drilled  out of them. They may make things more interesting. Also a few  more compositions, such as John Reid's, would furnish some spice to  professional life.\"    Eric's laughter wakened the echoes as he swung into the road down the  long sloping hill. He had given his fourth grade pupils their own choice  of subjects in the composition class that morning, and John Reid, a  sober, matter-of-fact little urchin, with not the slightest embryonic  development of a sense of humour, had, acting upon the whispered  suggestion of a roguish desk-mate, elected to write upon \"Courting.\" His  opening sentence made Eric's face twitch mutinously whenever he recalled  it during the day. \"Courting is a very pleasant thing which a great many  people go too far with.\"    The distant hills and wooded uplands were tremulous and aerial in  delicate spring-time gauzes of pearl and purple. The young, green-leafed  maples crowded thickly to the very edge of the road on either side, but  beyond them were emerald fields basking in sunshine, over which cloud  shadows rolled, broadened, and vanished. Far below the fields a calm  ocean slept bluely, and sighed in its sleep, with the murmur that rings  for ever in the ear of those whose good fortune it is to have been born  within the sound of it.    Now and then Eric met some callow, check-shirted, bare-legged lad on  horseback, or a shrewd-faced farmer in a cart, who nodded and called out  cheerily, \"Howdy, Master?\" A young girl, with a rosy, oval face, dimpled  cheeks, and pretty dark eyes filled with shy coquetry, passed him,  looking as if she would not be at all averse to a better acquaintance  with the new teacher.    Half way down the hill Eric met a shambling, old gray horse drawing an  express wagon which had seen better days. The driver was a woman: she  appeared to be one of those drab-tinted individuals who can never have  felt a rosy emotion in all their lives. She stopped her horse, and  beckoned Eric over to her with the knobby handle of a faded and bony  umbrella.    \"Reckon you're the new Master, ain't you?\" she asked.    Eric admitted that he was.    \"Well, I'm glad to see you,\" she said, offering him a hand in a much  darned cotton glove that had once been black.    \"I was right sorry to see Mr. West go, for he was a right good teacher,  and as harmless, inoffensive a creetur as ever lived. But I always told  him every time I laid eyes on him that he was in consumption, if ever  a man was. YOU look real healthy--though you can't aways tell by looks,  either. I had a brother complected like you, but he was killed in a  railroad accident out west when he was real young.    \"I've got a boy I'll be sending to school to you next week. He'd oughter  gone this week, but I had to keep him home to help me put the pertaters  in; for his father won't work and doesn't work and can't be made to  work.    \"Sandy--his full name is Edward Alexander--called after both his  grandfathers--hates the idee of going to school worse 'n pisen--always  did. But go he shall, for I'm determined he's got to have more larning  hammered into his head yet. I reckon you'll have trouble with him,  Master, for he's as stupid as an owl, and as stubborn as Solomon's mule.  But mind this, Master, I'll back you up. You just lick Sandy good and  plenty when he needs it, and send me a scrape of the pen home with him,  and I'll give him another dose.    \"There's people that always sides in with their young ones when there's  any rumpus kicked up in the school, but I don't hold to that, and never  did. You can depend on Rebecca Reid every time, Master.\"    \"Thank you. I am sure I can,\" said Eric, in his most winning tones.    He kept his face straight until it was safe to relax, and Mrs. Reid  drove on with a soft feeling in her leathery old heart, which had been  so toughened by long endurance of poverty and toil, and a husband who  wouldn't work and couldn't be made to work, that it was no longer a very  susceptible organ where members of the opposite sex were concerned.    Mrs. Reid reflected that this young man had a way with him.    Eric already knew most of the Lindsay folks by sight; but at the foot of  the hill he met two people, a man and a boy, whom he did not know. They  were sitting in a shabby, old-fashioned wagon, and were watering their  horse at the brook, which gurgled limpidly under the little plank bridge  in the hollow.    Eric surveyed them with some curiosity. They did not look in the least  like the ordinary run of Lindsay people. The boy, in particular, had  a distinctly foreign appearance, in spite of the gingham shirt and  homespun trousers, which seemed to be the regulation, work-a-day outfit  for the Lindsay farmer lads. He had a lithe, supple body, with sloping  shoulders, and a lean, satiny brown throat above his open shirt collar.  His head was covered with thick, silky, black curls, and the hand that  hung down by the side of the wagon was unusually long and slender. His  face was richly, though somewhat heavily featured, olive tinted, save  for the cheeks, which had a dusky crimson bloom. His mouth was as red  and beguiling as a girl's, and his eyes were large, bold and black. All  in all, he was a strikingly handsome fellow; but the expression of his  face was sullen, and he somehow gave Eric the impression of a sinuous,  feline creature basking in lazy grace, but ever ready for an unexpected  spring.    The other occupant of the wagon was a man between sixty-five and  seventy, with iron-gray hair, a long, full, gray beard, a harsh-featured  face, and deep-set hazel eyes under bushy, bristling brows. He was  evidently tall, with a spare, ungainly figure, and stooping shoulders.  His mouth was close-lipped and relentless, and did not look as if it  had ever smiled. Indeed, the idea of smiling could not be connected with  this man--it was utterly incongruous. Yet there was nothing repellent  about his face; and there was something in it that compelled Eric's  attention.    He rather prided himself on being a student of physiognomy, and he felt  quite sure that this man was no ordinary Lindsay farmer of the genial,  garrulous type with which he was familiar.    Long after the old wagon, with its oddly assorted pair, had gone  lumbering up the hill, Eric found himself thinking of the stern, heavy  browed man and the black-eyed, red-lipped boy.        CHAPTER IV. A TEA TABLE CONVERSATION    The Williamson place, where Eric boarded, was on the crest of the  succeeding hill. He liked it as well as Larry West had prophesied that  he would. The Williamsons, as well as the rest of the Lindsay people,  took it for granted that he was a poor college student working his way  through as Larry West had been doing. Eric did not disturb this belief,  although he said nothing to contribute to it.    The Williamsons were at tea in the kitchen when Eric went in. Mrs.  Williamson was the \"saint in spectacles and calico\" which Larry West had  termed her. Eric liked her greatly. She was a slight, gray-haired woman,  with a thin, sweet, high-bred face, deeply lined with the records of  outlived pain. She talked little as a rule; but, in the pungent country  phrase she never spoke but she said something. The one thing that  constantly puzzled Eric was how such a woman ever came to marry Robert  Williamson.    She smiled in a motherly fashion at Eric, as he hung his hat on the  white-washed wall and took his place at the table. Outside of the  window behind him was a birch grove which, in the westering sun, was  a tremulous splendour, with a sea of undergrowth wavered into golden  billows by every passing wind.    Old Robert Williamson sat opposite him, on a bench. He was a small, lean  old man, half lost in loose clothes that seemed far too large for him.  When he spoke his voice was as thin and squeaky as he appeared to be  himself.    The other end of the bench was occupied by Timothy, sleek and  complacent, with a snowy breast and white paws. After old Robert had  taken a mouthful of anything he gave a piece to Timothy, who ate it  daintily and purred resonant gratitude.    \"You see we're busy waiting for you, Master,\" said old Robert. \"You're  late this evening. Keep any of the youngsters in? That's a foolish way  of punishing them, as hard on yourself as on them. One teacher we had  four years ago used to lock them in and go home. Then he'd go back in  an hour and let them out--if they were there. They weren't always. Tom  Ferguson kicked the panels out of the old door once and got out that  way. We put a new door of double plank in that they couldn't kick out.\"    \"I stayed in the schoolroom to do some work,\" said Eric briefly.    \"Well, you've missed Alexander Tracy. He was here to find out if you  could play checkers, and, when I told him you could, he left word for  you to go up and have a game some evening soon. Don't beat him too  often, even if you can. You'll need to stand in with him, I tell you,  Master, for he's got a son that may brew trouble for you when he starts  in to go to school. Seth Tracy's a young imp, and he'd far sooner be in  mischief than eat. He tries to run on every new teacher and he's run  two clean out of the school. But he met his match in Mr. West. William  Tracy's boys now--you won't have a scrap of bother with THEM. They're  always good because their mother tells them every Sunday that they'll  go straight to hell if they don't behave in school. It's effective. Take  some preserve, Master. You know we don't help things here the way Mrs.  Adam Scott does when she has boarders, 'I s'pose you don't want any of  this--nor you--nor you?' Mother, Aleck says old George Wright is having  the time of his life. His wife has gone to Charlottetown to visit her  sister and he is his own boss for the first time since he was married,  forty years ago. He's on a regular orgy, Aleck says. He "]]]
