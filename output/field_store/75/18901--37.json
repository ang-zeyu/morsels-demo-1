[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/64"],[0,"The Gods of Mars (#4)"],[1," the sound of my name.    And there before my astonished eyes I beheld the greatest of the green  men of Barsoom; their shrewdest statesman, their mightiest general, my  great and good friend, Tars Tarkas, Jeddak of Thark.          CHAPTER II    A FOREST BATTLE      Tars Tarkas and I found no time for an exchange of experiences as we  stood there before the great boulder surrounded by the corpses of our  grotesque assailants, for from all directions down the broad valley was  streaming a perfect torrent of terrifying creatures in response to the  weird call of the strange figure far above us.    \"Come,\" cried Tars Tarkas, \"we must make for the cliffs.  There lies  our only hope of even temporary escape; there we may find a cave or a  narrow ledge which two may defend for ever against this motley, unarmed  horde.\"    Together we raced across the scarlet sward, I timing my speed that I  might not outdistance my slower companion.  We had, perhaps, three  hundred yards to cover between our boulder and the cliffs, and then to  search out a suitable shelter for our stand against the terrifying  things that were pursuing us.    They were rapidly overhauling us when Tars Tarkas cried to me to hasten  ahead and discover, if possible, the sanctuary we sought.  The  suggestion was a good one, for thus many valuable minutes might be  saved to us, and, throwing every ounce of my earthly muscles into the  effort, I cleared the remaining distance between myself and the cliffs  in great leaps and bounds that put me at their base in a moment.    The cliffs rose perpendicular directly from the almost level sward of  the valley.  There was no accumulation of fallen debris, forming a more  or less rough ascent to them, as is the case with nearly all other  cliffs I have ever seen.  The scattered boulders that had fallen from  above and lay upon or partly buried in the turf, were the only  indication that any disintegration of the massive, towering pile of  rocks ever had taken place.    My first cursory inspection of the face of the cliffs filled my heart  with forebodings, since nowhere could I discern, except where the weird  herald stood still shrieking his shrill summons, the faintest  indication of even a bare foothold upon the lofty escarpment.    To my right the bottom of the cliff was lost in the dense foliage of  the forest, which terminated at its very foot, rearing its gorgeous  foliage fully a thousand feet against its stern and forbidding  neighbour.    To the left the cliff ran, apparently unbroken, across the head of the  broad valley, to be lost in the outlines of what appeared to be a range  of mighty mountains that skirted and confined the valley in every  direction.    Perhaps a thousand feet from me the river broke, as it seemed, directly  from the base of the cliffs, and as there seemed not the remotest  chance for escape in that direction I turned my attention again toward  the forest.    The cliffs towered above me a good five thousand feet.  The sun was not  quite upon them and they loomed a dull yellow in their own shade.  Here  and there they were broken with streaks and patches of dusky red,  green, and occasional areas of white quartz.    Altogether they were very beautiful, but I fear that I did not regard  them with a particularly appreciative eye on this, my first inspection  of them.    Just then I was absorbed in them only as a medium of escape, and so, as  my gaze ran quickly, time and again, over their vast expanse in search  of some cranny or crevice, I came suddenly to loathe them as the  prisoner must loathe the cruel and impregnable walls of his dungeon.    Tars Tarkas was approaching me rapidly, and still more rapidly came the  awful horde at his heels.    It seemed the forest now or nothing, and I was just on the point of  motioning Tars Tarkas to follow me in that direction when the sun  passed the cliff's zenith, and as the bright rays touched the dull  surface it burst out into a million scintillant lights of burnished  gold, of flaming red, of soft greens, and gleaming whites--a more  gorgeous and inspiring spectacle human eye has never rested upon.    The face of the entire cliff was, as later inspection conclusively  proved, so shot with veins and patches of solid gold as to quite  present the appearance of a solid wall of that precious metal except  where it was broken by outcroppings of ruby, emerald, and diamond  boulders--a faint and alluring indication of the vast and unguessable  riches which lay deeply buried behind the magnificent surface.    But what caught my most interested attention at the moment that the  sun's rays set the cliff's face a-shimmer, was the several black spots  which now appeared quite plainly in evidence high across the gorgeous  wall close to the forest's top, and extending apparently below and  behind the branches.    Almost immediately I recognised them for what they were, the dark  openings of caves entering the solid walls--possible avenues of escape  or temporary shelter, could we but reach them.    There was but a single way, and that led through the mighty, towering  trees upon our right.  That I could scale them I knew full well, but  Tars Tarkas, with his mighty bulk and enormous weight, would find it a  task possibly quite beyond his prowess or his skill, for Martians are  at best but poor climbers.  Upon the entire surface of that ancient  planet I never before had seen a hill or mountain that exceeded four  thousand feet in height above the dead sea bottoms, and as the ascent  was usually gradual, nearly to their summits they presented but few  opportunities for the practice of climbing.  Nor would the Martians  have embraced even such opportunities as might present themselves, for  they could always find a circuitous route about the base of any  eminence, and these roads they preferred and followed in preference to  the shorter but more arduous ways.    However, there was nothing else to consider than an attempt to scale  the trees contiguous to the cliff in an effort to reach the caves above.    The Thark grasped the possibilities and the difficulties of the plan at  once, but there was no alternative, and so we set out rapidly for the  trees nearest the cliff.    Our relentless pursuers were now close to us, so close that it seemed  that it would be an utter impossibility for the Jeddak of Thark to  reach the forest in advance of them, nor was there any considerable  will in the efforts that Tars Tarkas made, for the green men of Barsoom  do not relish flight, nor ever before had I seen one fleeing from death  in whatsoever form it might have confronted him.  But that Tars Tarkas  was the bravest of the brave he had proven thousands of times; yes,  tens of thousands in countless mortal combats with men and beasts.  And  so I knew that there was another reason than fear of death behind his  flight, as he knew that a greater power than pride or honour spurred me  to escape these fierce destroyers.  In my case it was love--love of the  divine Dejah Thoris; and the cause of the Thark's great and sudden love  of life I could not fathom, for it is oftener that they seek death than  life--these strange, cruel, loveless, unhappy people.    At length, however, we reached the shadows of the forest, while right  behind us sprang the swiftest of our pursuers--a giant plant man with  claws outreaching to fasten his bloodsucking mouths upon us.    He was, I should say, a hundred yards in advance of his closest  companion, and so I called to Tars Tarkas to ascend a great tree that  brushed the cliff's face while I dispatched the fellow, thus giving the  less agile Thark an opportunity to reach the higher branches before the  entire horde should be upon us and every vestige of escape cut off.    But I had reckoned without a just appreciation either of the cunning of  my immediate antagonist or the swiftness with which his fellows were  covering the distance which had separated them from me.    As I raised my long-sword to deal the creature its death thrust it  halted in its charge and, as my sword cut harmlessly through the empty  air, the great tail of the thing swept with the power of a grizzly's  arm across the sward and carried me bodily from my feet to the ground.  In an instant the brute was upon me, but ere it could fasten its  hideous mouths into my breast and throat I grasped a writhing tentacle  in either hand.    The plant man was well muscled, heavy, and powerful but my earthly  sinews and greater agility, in conjunction with the deathly strangle  hold I had upon him, would have given me, I think, an eventual victory  had we had time to discuss the merits of our relative prowess  uninterrupted.  But  as we strained and struggled about the tree into  which Tars Tarkas was clambering with infinite difficulty, I suddenly  caught a glimpse over the shoulder of my antagonist of the great swarm  of pursuers that now were fairly upon me.    Now, at last, I saw the nature of the other monsters who had come with  the plant men in response to the weird calling of the man upon the  cliff's face.  They were that most dreaded of Martian creatures--great  white apes of Barsoom.    My former experiences upon Mars had familiarized me thoroughly with  them and their methods, and I may say that of all the fearsome and  terrible, weird and grotesque inhabitants of that strange world, it is  the white apes that come nearest to familiarizing me with the sensation  of fear.    I think that the cause of this feeling which these apes engender within  me is due to their remarkable resemblance in form to our Earth men,  which gives them a human appearance that is most uncanny when coupled  with their enormous size.    They stand fifteen feet in height and walk erect upon their hind feet.  Like the green Martians, they have an intermediary set of arms midway  between their upper and lower limbs.  Their eyes are very close set,  but do not protrude as do those of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6422"],[0,"The Life, Adventures & Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton (#4)"],[1,"perfidious, not only to strangers but to one  another, so meanly submissive when subjected, so insolent, or barbarous  and tyrannical, when superior, that I thought there was something in  them that shocked my very nature. Add to this that it is natural to an  Englishman to hate a coward, it all joined together to make the devil  and a Portuguese equally my aversion.    However, according to the English proverb, he that is shipped with the  devil must sail with the devil; I was among them, and I managed myself  as well as I could. My master had consented that I should assist the  captain in the office, as above; but, as I understood afterwards that  the captain allowed my master half a moidore a month for my service, and  that he had my name upon the ship's books also, I expected that when  the ship came to be paid four months' wages at the Indies, as they, it  seems, always do, my master would let me have something for myself.    But I was wrong in my man, for he was none of that kind; he had taken  me up as in distress, and his business was to keep me so, and make his  market of me as well as he could, which I began to think of after a  different manner than I did at first, for at first I thought he had  entertained me in mere charity, upon seeing my distressed circumstances,  but did not doubt but when he put me on board the ship, I should have  some wages for my service.    But he thought, it seems, quite otherwise; and when I procured one to  speak to him about it, when the ship was paid at Goa, he flew into the  greatest rage imaginable, and called me English dog, young heretic, and  threatened to put me into the Inquisition. Indeed, of all the names  the four-and-twenty letters could make up, he should not have called me  heretic; for as I knew nothing about religion, neither Protestant from  Papist, or either of them from a Mahometan, I could never be a heretic.  However, it passed but a little, but, as young as I was, I had been  carried into the Inquisition, and there, if they had asked me if I was  a Protestant or a Catholic, I should have said yes to that which came  first. If it had been the Protestant they had asked first, it had  certainly made a martyr of me for I did not know what.    But the very priest they carried with them, or chaplain of the ship,  as we called him, saved me; for seeing me a boy entirely ignorant of  religion, and ready to do or say anything they bid me, he asked me some  questions about it, which he found I answered so very simply, that  he took it upon him to tell them he would answer for my being a good  Catholic, and he hoped he should be the means of saving my soul, and he  pleased himself that it was to be a work of merit to him; so he made me  as good a Papist as any of them in about a week's time.    I then told him my case about my master; how, it is true, he had taken  me up in a miserable case on board a man-of-war at Lisbon; and I was  indebted to him for bringing me on board this ship; that if I had been  left at Lisbon, I might have starved, and the like; and therefore I  was willing to serve him, but that I hoped he would give me some little  consideration for my service, or let me know how long he expected I  should serve him for nothing.    It was all one; neither the priest nor any one else could prevail with  him, but that I was not his servant but his slave, that he took me in  the Algerine, and that I was a Turk, only pretended to be an English boy  to get my liberty, and he would carry me to the Inquisition as a Turk.    This frighted me out of my wits, for I had nobody to vouch for me what I  was, or from whence I came; but the good Padre Antonio, for that was his  name, cleared me of that part by a way I did not understand; for he came  to me one morning with two sailors, and told me they must search me, to  bear witness that I was not a Turk. I was amazed at them, and frighted,  and did not understand them, nor could I imagine what they intended to  do to me. However, stripping me, they were soon satisfied, and Father  Antony bade me be easy, for they could all witness that I was no Turk.  So I escaped that part of my master's cruelty.    And now I resolved from that time to run away from him if I could, but  there was no doing of it there, for there were not ships of any nation  in the world in that port, except two or three Persian vessels from  Ormus, so that if I had offered to go away from him, he would have had  me seized on shore, and brought on board by force; so that I had no  remedy but patience. And this he brought to an end too as soon as he  could, for after this he began to use me ill, and not only to straiten  my provisions, but to beat and torture me in a barbarous manner for  every trifle, so that, in a word, my life began to be very miserable.    The violence of this usage of me, and the impossibility of my escape  from his hands, set my head a-working upon all sorts of mischief, and in  particular I resolved, after studying all other ways to deliver myself,  and finding all ineffectual, I say, I resolved to murder him. With this  hellish resolution in my head, I spent whole nights and days contriving  how to put it in execution, the devil prompting me very warmly to the  fact. I was indeed entirely at a loss for the means, for I had neither  gun or sword, nor any weapon to assault him with; poison I had my  thoughts much upon, but knew not where to get any; or, if I might have  got it, I did not know the country word for it, or by what name to ask  for it.    In this manner I quitted the fact, intentionally, a hundred and a  hundred times; but Providence, either for his sake or for mine, always  frustrated my designs, and I could never bring it to pass; so I was  obliged to continue in his chains till the ship, having taken in her  loading, set sail for Portugal.    I can say nothing here to the manner of our voyage, for, as I said, I  kept no journal; but this I can give an account of, that having been  once as high as the Cape of Good Hope, as we call it, or Cabo de Bona  Speranza, as they call it, we were driven back again by a violent storm  from the W.S.W., which held us six days and nights a great way to the  eastward, and after that, standing afore the wind for several days more,  we at last came to an anchor on the coast of Madagascar.    The storm had been so violent that the ship had received a great deal of  damage, and it required some time to repair her; so, standing in nearer  the shore, the pilot, my master, brought the ship into a very good  harbour, where we rid in twenty-six fathoms water, about half a mile  from the shore.    While the ship rode here there happened a most desperate mutiny among  the men, upon account of some deficiency in their allowance, which came  to that height that they threatened the captain to set him on shore, and  go back with the ship to Goa. I wished they would with all my heart,  for I was full of mischief in my head, and ready enough to do any. So,  though I was but a boy, as they called me, yet I prompted the mischief  all I could, and embarked in it so openly, that I escaped very little  being hanged in the first and most early part of my life; for the  captain had some notice that there was a design laid by some of the  company to murder him; and having, partly by money and promises, and  partly by threatening and torture, brought two fellows to confess the  particulars, and the names of the persons concerned, they were presently  apprehended, till, one accusing another, no less than sixteen men were  seized and put into irons, whereof I was one.    The captain, who was made desperate by his danger, resolving to clear  the ship of his enemies, tried us all, and we were all condemned to die.  The manner of his process I was too young to take notice of; but the  purser and one of the gunners were hanged immediately, and I expected it  with the rest. I do not remember any great concern I was under about it,  only that I cried very much, for I knew little then of this world, and  nothing at all of the next.    However, the captain contented himself with executing these two, and  some of the rest, upon their humble submission and promise of future  good behaviour, were pardoned; but five were ordered to be set on shore  on the island and left there, of which I was one. My master used all his  interest with the captain to have me excused, but could not obtain it;  for somebody having told him that I was one of them who was singled out  to have killed him, when my master desired I might not be set on shore,  the captain told him I should stay on board if he desired it, but then  I should be hanged, so he might choose for me which he thought best. The  captain, it seems, was particularly provoked at my being concerned in  the treachery, because of his having been so kind to me, and of his  having singled me out to serve him, as I have said above; and this,  perhaps, obliged him to give my master such a rough choice, either  to set me on shore or to have me hanged on board. And had my master,  indeed, known what good-will I had for him, he would not have been long  in choosing for me; for I had certainly determined to do him a mischief  the first opportunity I had for it. This was, therefore, a good  providence for me to keep me from dipping my hands in blood, and it made  me more tender afterwards in matters of blood than I believe I should  otherwise have been. But as to my being one of them that was to kill  the captain, that I was wronged in, for I was not the person, but it was  really one of them that were pardoned, he having the good luck not to  have that part discovered.    I was now to enter upon a part of independent life, a thing I was indeed  very ill prepared to manage, for I was perfectly loose and dissolute  in my behaviour, bold and wicked while I was under government, and now  perfectly unfit to be trusted with liberty, for I was as ripe for any  villainy as a"]]]
