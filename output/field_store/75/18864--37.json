If you had told me about such a fellow  a week before I should have been sick at the thought of him. But now I  didn't dislike him. I was bored by him and I was also tremendously  sorry for him. You could see he was as restless as a hen.    When we went back to the hall he announced that he must get on the  road, and commandeered Miss Lamington to help him find his bicycle. It  appeared he was staying at an inn a dozen miles off for a couple of  days' fishing, and the news somehow made me like him better. Presently  the ladies of the house departed to bed for their beauty sleep and I  was left to my own devices.    For some time I sat smoking in the hall wondering when the messenger  would arrive. It was getting late and there seemed to be no preparation  in the house to receive anybody. The butler came in with a tray of  drinks and I asked him if he expected another guest that night.    'I 'adn't 'eard of it, sir,' was his answer. 'There 'asn't been a  telegram that I know of, and I 'ave received no instructions.'    I lit my pipe and sat for twenty minutes reading a weekly paper. Then I  got up and looked at the family portraits. The moon coming through the  lattice invited me out-of-doors as a cure for my anxiety. It was after  eleven o'clock, and I was still without any knowledge of my next step.  It is a maddening business to be screwed up for an unpleasant job and  to have the wheels of the confounded thing tarry.    Outside the house beyond a flagged terrace the lawn fell away, white in  the moonshine, to the edge of the stream, which here had expanded into  a miniature lake. By the water's edge was a little formal garden with  grey stone parapets which now gleamed like dusky marble. Great wafts of  scent rose from it, for the lilacs were scarcely over and the may was  in full blossom. Out from the shade of it came suddenly a voice like a  nightingale.    It was singing the old song 'Cherry Ripe', a common enough thing which  I had chiefly known from barrel-organs. But heard in the scented  moonlight it seemed to hold all the lingering magic of an elder England  and of this hallowed countryside. I stepped inside the garden bounds  and saw the head of the girl Mary.    She was conscious of my presence, for she turned towards me.    'I was coming to look for you,' she said, 'now that the house is quiet.  I have something to say to you, General Hannay.'    She knew my name and must be somehow in the business. The thought  entranced me.    'Thank God I can speak to you freely,' I cried. 'Who and what are  you--living in that house in that kind of company?'    'My good aunts!' She laughed softly. 'They talk a great deal about  their souls, but they really mean their nerves. Why, they are what you  call my camouflage, and a very good one too.'    'And that cadaverous young prig?'    'Poor Launcelot! Yes--camouflage too--perhaps something a little more.  You must not judge him too harshly.'    'But ... but--' I did not know how to put it, and stammered in my  eagerness. 'How can I tell that you are the right person for me to  speak to? You see I am under orders, and I have got none about you.'    'I will give You Proof,' she said. 'Three days ago Sir Walter Bullivant  and Mr Macgillivray told you to come here tonight and to wait here for  further instructions. You met them in the little smoking-room at the  back of the Rota Club. You were bidden take the name of Cornelius  Brand, and turn yourself from a successful general into a pacifist  South African engineer. Is that correct?'    'Perfectly.'    'You have been restless all evening looking for the messenger to give  you these instructions. Set your mind at ease. No messenger is coming.  You will get your orders from me.'    'I could not take them from a more welcome source,' I said.    'Very prettily put. If you want further credentials I can tell you much  about your own doings in the past three years. I can explain to you who  don't need the explanation, every step in the business of the Black  Stone. I think I could draw a pretty accurate map of your journey to  Erzerum. You have a letter from Peter Pienaar in your pocket--I can  tell you its contents. Are you willing to trust me?'    'With all my heart,' I said.    'Good. Then my first order will try you pretty hard. For I have no  orders to give you except to bid you go and steep yourself in a  particular kind of life. Your first duty is to get \"atmosphere\", as  your friend Peter used to say. Oh, I will tell you where to go and how  to behave. But I can't bid you do anything, only live idly with open  eyes and ears till you have got the \"feel\" of the situation.'    She stopped and laid a hand on my arm.    'It won't be easy. It would madden me, and it will be a far heavier  burden for a man like you. You have got to sink down deep into the life  of the half-baked, the people whom this war hasn't touched or has  touched in the wrong way, the people who split hairs all day and are  engrossed in what you and I would call selfish little fads. Yes. People  like my aunts and Launcelot, only for the most part in a different  social grade. You won't live in an old manor like this, but among  gimcrack little \"arty\" houses. You will hear everything you regard as  sacred laughed at and condemned, and every kind of nauseous folly  acclaimed, and you must hold your tongue and pretend to agree. You will  have nothing in the world to do except to let the life soak into you,  and, as I have said, keep your eyes and ears open.'    'But you must give me some clue as to what I should be looking for?'    'My orders are to give you none. Our chiefs--yours and mine--want you  to go where you are going without any kind of _parti pris_. Remember we  are still in the intelligence stage of the affair. The time hasn't yet  come for a plan of campaign, and still less for action.'    'Tell me one thing,' I said. 'Is it a really big thing we're after?'    'A--really--big--thing,' she said slowly and very gravely. 'You and I  and some hundred others are hunting the most dangerous man in all the  world. Till we succeed everything that Britain does is crippled. If we  fail or succeed too late the Allies may never win the victory which is  their right. I will tell you one thing to cheer you. It is in some sort  a race against time, so your purgatory won't endure too long.'    I was bound to obey, and she knew it, for she took my willingness for  granted.    From a little gold satchel she selected a tiny box, and opening it  extracted a thing like a purple wafer with a white St Andrew's Cross on  it.    'What kind of watch have you? Ah, a hunter. Paste that inside the lid.  Some day you may be called on to show it ... One other thing. Buy  tomorrow a copy of the _Pilgrim's Progress_ and get it by heart. You  will receive letters and messages some day and the style of our friends  is apt to be reminiscent of John Bunyan ... The car will be at the door  tomorrow to catch the ten-thirty, and I will give you the address of  the rooms that have been taken for you ... Beyond that I have nothing  to say, except to beg you to play the part well and keep your temper.  You behaved very nicely at dinner.'    I asked one last question as we said good night in the hall. 'Shall I  see you again?'    'Soon, and often,' was the answer. 'Remember we are colleagues.'    I went upstairs feeling extraordinarily comforted. I had a perfectly  beastly time ahead of me, but now it was all glorified and coloured  with the thought of the girl who had sung 'Cherry Ripe' in the garden.  I commended the wisdom of that old serpent Bullivant in the choice of  his intermediary, for I'm hanged if I would have taken such orders from  anyone else.        CHAPTER TWO    'The Village Named Morality'    UP on the high veld our rivers are apt to be strings of pools linked by  muddy trickles--the most stagnant kind of watercourse you would look  for in a day's journey. But presently they reach the edge of the  plateau and are tossed down into the flats in noble ravines, and roll  thereafter in full and sounding currents to the sea. So with the story  I am telling. It began in smooth reaches, as idle as a mill-pond; yet  the day soon came when I was in the grip of a torrent, flung breathless  from rock to rock by a destiny which I could not control. But for the  present I was in a backwater, no less than the Garden City of  Biggleswick, where Mr Cornelius Brand, a South African gentleman  visiting England on holiday, lodged in a pair of rooms in the cottage  of Mr Tancred Jimson.    The house--or 'home' as they preferred to name it at Biggleswick--was  one of some two hundred others which ringed a pleasant Midland common.  It was badly built and oddly furnished; the bed was too short, the  windows did not fit, the doors did not stay shut; but it was as clean  as soap and water and scrubbing could make it. The three-quarters of an  acre of garden were mainly devoted to the culture of potatoes, though  under the parlour window Mrs Jimson had a plot of sweet-smelling herbs,  and lines of lank sunflowers fringed the path that led to the front  door. It was Mrs Jimson who received me as I descended from the station  fly--a large red woman with hair bleached by constant exposure to  weather, clad in a gown which, both in shape and material, seemed to  have been modelled on a chintz curtain. She was a good kindly soul, and  as proud as Punch of her house.    'We follow the simple life here, Mr Brand,' she said. 'You must take us  as you find us.'    I assured her that I asked for nothing better, and as I unpacked in my  fresh little bedroom with a west wind blowing in at the window I  considered that I had seen worse quarters.    I had bought in London a considerable number of books, for I thought  that, as I would have time on my hands, I might as well do something  about my education.

Movement of bead at end of  filament magnified about 40 times.    Another seed was treated and observed in the same manner, but the radicle  in this case protruded .1 inch, and was not  Fig. 2. Brassica oleracea: circumnutating and geotropic movement of  radicle, traced on horizontal glass during 46 hours.    fastened so as to project quite vertically upwards. The filament was  affixed close to its base. The tracing (Fig. 2, reduced by half) shows the  movement from 9 A.M. Jan. 31st to 7 A.M. Feb. 2nd; but it continued to move  during the whole of the  [page 12]  2nd in the same general direction, and in a similar zigzag manner. From the  radicle not being quite perpendicular when the filament was affixed  geotropism came into play at once; but the irregular zigzag course shows  that there was growth (probably preceded by turgescence), sometimes on one  and sometimes on another side. Occasionally the bead remained stationary  for about an hour, and then probably growth occurred on the side opposite  to that which caused the geotropic curvature. In the case previously  described the basal part of the very short radicle from being turned  vertically upwards, was at first very little affected by geotropism.  Filaments were affixed in two other instances to rather longer radicles  protruding obliquely from seeds which had been turned upside down; and in  these cases the lines traced on the horizontal glasses were only slightly  zigzag, and the movement was always in the same general direction, through  the action of geotropism. All these observations are liable to several  causes of error, but we believe, from what will hereafter be shown with  respect to the movements of the radicles of other plants, that they may be  largely trusted.    Hypocotyl.--The hypocotyl protrudes through the seed-coats as a rectangular  projection, which grows rapidly into an arch like the letter U turned  upside down; the cotyledons being still enclosed within the seed. In  whatever position the seed may be embedded in the earth or otherwise fixed,  both legs of the arch bend upwards through apogeotropism, and thus rise  vertically above the ground. As soon as this has taken place, or even  earlier, the inner or concave surface of the arch grows more quickly than  the upper or convex surface; and this tends to separate the two legs and  aids in drawing the cotyledons out of the buried seed-coats. By the growth  of the whole arch the cotyledons are ultimately dragged from beneath the  ground, even from a considerable depth; and now the hypocotyl quickly  straightens itself by the increased growth of the concave side.    Even whilst the arched or doubled hypocotyl is still beneath the ground, it  circumnutates as much as the pressure of the surrounding soil will permit;  but this was difficult to observe, because as soon as the arch is freed  from lateral pressure the two legs begin to separate, even at a very early  age, before the arch would naturally have reached the surface. Seeds were  allowed to germinate on the surface of damp earth, and after they had fixed  themselves by their radicles, and after the, as yet, only  [page 13]  slightly arched hypocotyl had become nearly vertical, a glass filament was  affixed on two occasions near to the base of the basal leg (i.e. the one in  connection with the radicle), and its movements were traced in darkness on  a horizontal glass. The result was that long lines were formed running in  nearly the plane of the vertical arch, due to the early separation of the  two legs now freed from pressure; but as the lines were zigzag, showing  lateral movement, the arch must have been circumnutating, whilst it was  straightening itself by growth along its inner or concave surface.    A somewhat different method of observation was next followed:  Fig. 3. Brassica oleracea: circumnutating movement of buried and arched  hypocotyl (dimly illuminated from above), traced on horizontal glass during  45 hours. Movement of bead of filament magnified about 25 times, and here  reduced to one-half of original scale.    as soon as the earth with seeds in a pot began to crack, the surface was  removed in parts to the depth of .2 inch; and a filament was fixed to the  basal leg of a buried and arched hypocotyl, just above the summit of the  radicle. The cotyledons were still almost completely enclosed within the  much-cracked seed-coats; and these were again covered up with damp adhesive  soil pressed pretty firmly down. The movement of the filament was traced  (Fig. 3) from 11 A.M. Feb. 5th till 8 A.M. Feb. 7th. By this latter period  the cotyledons had been dragged from beneath the pressed-down earth, but  the upper part of the hypocotyl still formed nearly a right angle with the  lower part. The tracing shows that the arched hypocotyl tends at this early  [page 14]  age to circumnutate irregularly. On the first day the greater movement  (from right to left in the figure) was not in the plane of the vertical and  arched hypocotyl, but at right angles to it, or in the plane of the two  cotyledons, which were still in close contact. The basal leg of the arch at  the time when the filament was affixed to it, was already bowed  considerably backwards, or from the cotyledons; had the filament been  affixed before this bowing occurred, the chief movement would have been at  right angles to that shown in the figure. A filament was attached to  another buried hypocotyl of the same age, and it moved in a similar general  manner, but the line traced was not so complex. This hypocotyl became  almost straight, and the cotyledons were dragged from beneath the ground on  the evening of the second day.    Fig. 4. Brassica oleracea: circumnutating movement of buried and arched  hypocotyl, with the two legs of the arch tied together, traced on  horizontal glass during 33 ½ hours. Movement of the bead of filament  magnified about 26 times, and here reduced to one-half original scale.    Before the above observations were made, some arched hypocotyls buried at  the depth of a quarter of an inch were uncovered; and in order to prevent  the two legs of the arch from beginning to separate at once, they were tied  together with fine silk. This was done partly because we wished to  ascertain how long the hypocotyl, in its arched condition, would continue  to move, and whether the movement when not masked and disturbed by the  straightening process, indicated circumnutation. Firstly a filament was  fixed to the basal leg of an arched hypocotyl close above the summit of the  radicle. The cotyledons were still partially enclosed within the  seed-coats. The movement was traced (Fig. 4) from 9.20 A.M. on Dec.  [page 15]  23rd to 6.45 A.M. on Dec. 25th. No doubt the natural movement was much  disturbed by the two legs having been tied together; but we see that it was  distinctly zigzag, first in one direction and then in an almost opposite  one. After 3 P.M. on the 24th the arched hypocotyl sometimes remained  stationary for a considerable time, and when moving, moved far slower than  before. Therefore, on the morning of the 25th, the glass filament was  removed from the base of the basal leg, and was fixed horizontally on the  summit of the arch, which, from the legs having been tied, had grown broad  and almost flat. The movement was now traced during 23 hours (Fig. 5), and  we    Fig. 5. Brassica oleracea: circumnutating movement of the crown of a buried  and arched hypocotyl, with the two legs tied together, traced on a  horizontal glass during 23 hours. Movement of the bead of the filament  magnified about 58 times, and here reduced to one-half original scale.    see that the course was still zigzag, which indicates a tendency to  circumnutation. The base of the basal leg by this time had almost  completely ceased to move.    As soon as the cotyledons have been naturally dragged from beneath the  ground, and the hypocotyl has straightened itself by growth along the inner  or concave surface, there is nothing to interfere with the free movements  of the parts; and the circumnutation now becomes much more regular and  clearly displayed, as shown in the following cases:--A seedling was placed  in front and near a north-east window with a line joining the  [page 16]  two cotyledons parallel to the window. It was thus left the whole day so as  to accommodate itself to the light. On the following morning a filament was  fixed to the midrib of the larger and taller cotyledon (which enfolds the  other and smaller one, whilst still within the seed), and a mark being  placed close behind, the movement of the whole plant, that is, of the  hypocotyl and cotyledon, was traced greatly magnified on a vertical glass.  At first the plant bent so much towards the light that it was useless to  attempt to trace the movement; but at 10 A.M. heliotropism almost wholly  ceased and the first dot was    Fig. 6. Brassica oleracea: conjoint circumnutation of the hypocotyl and  cotyledons during 10 hours 45 minutes. Figure here reduced to one-half  original scale.    made on the glass. The last was made at 8.45 P.M.; seventeen dots being  altogether made in this interval of 10 h. 45 m. (see Fig. 6). It should be  noticed that when I looked shortly after 4 P.M. the bead was pointing off  the glass, but it came on again at 5.30 P.M., and the course during this  interval of 1 h. 30 m. has been filled up by imagination, but cannot be far  from correct. The bead moved seven times from side to side, and thus  described 3 ½ ellipses in 10 3/4 h.; each being completed on an average in  3 h. 4 m.    On the previous day another seedling had been observed under similar  conditions, excepting that the plant was so  [page 17]  placed that a line joining the two cotyledons pointed towards the window;  and the filament was attached to the smaller cotyledon on the side furthest  from the window. Moreover the plant was now for the first time placed in  this position. The "]]]
