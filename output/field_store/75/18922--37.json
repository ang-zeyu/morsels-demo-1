All the Powers of old  Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise  this spectre--Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot,  French Radicals and German police-spies. Where  is the party in opposition that has not been decried  as communistic by its opponents in power? Where  the Opposition that has not hurled back the branding  reproach of Communism against the more  advanced opposition parties, as well as against its  re-actionary adversaries?''    The existence of a class war is nothing new:  ``The history of all hitherto existing society is the  history of class struggles.'' In these struggles the  fight ``each time ended, either in a revolutionary  re-constitution of society at large, or in the common  ruin of the contending classes.''    ``Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie . . .  has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a  whole is more and more splitting up into two great  hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing  each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.'' Then follows  a history of the fall of feudalism, leading to a  description of the bourgeoisie as a revolutionary  force. ``The bourgeoisie, historically, has played a  most revolutionary part.'' ``For exploitation, veiled  by religious and political illusions, it has substituted  naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.'' ``The  need of a constantly expanding market for its products  chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface  of the globe.'' ``The bourgeoisie, during its rule of  scarce one hundred years, has created more massive  and more colossal productive forces than have all  preceding generations together.'' Feudal relations  became fetters: ``They had to be burst asunder;  they were burst asunder. . . . A similar movement  is going on before our own eyes.'' ``The weapons  with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the  ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself.  But not only has the bourgoisie forged the weapons  that bring death to itself; it has also called into  existence the men who are to wield those weapons--  the modern working class--the proletarians.''    The cause of the destitution of the proletariat  are then set forth. ``The cost of production of a  workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the means  of subsistence that he requires for his maintenance  and for the propagation of his race. But the price  of a commodity, and therefore also of labor, is equal  to its cost of production. In proportion, therefore,  as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage  decreases. Nay more, in proportion as the use of  machinery and diversion of labor increases, in the  same proportion the burden of toil also increases.''    ``Modern industry has converted the little workshop  of the patriarchal master into the great factory  of the industrial capitalist. Masses of laborers,  crowded into the factory, are organized like soldiers.  As privates of the industrial army they are placed  under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers  and sergeants. Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois  class, and of the bourgeois State, they are  daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, by the  over-looker, and, above all, by the individual  bourgeois manufacturer himself. The more openly this  despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the  more petty, the more hateful, and the more embittering  it is.''    The Manifesto tells next the manner of growth  of the class struggle. ``The proletariat goes  through various stages of development. With its  birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie. At  first the contest is carried on by individual laborers,  then by the workpeople of a factory, then by the  operatives of one trade, in one locality, against the  individual bourgeois who directly exploits them.  They direct their attacks not against the bourgeois  conditions of production, but against the instruments  of production themselves.''    ``At this stage the laborers still form an incoherent  mass scattered over the whole country, and broken  up by their mutual competition. If anywhere they  unite to form more compact bodies, this is not yet  the consequence of their own active union, but of  the union of the bourgeoisie, which class, in order to  attain its own political ends, is compelled to set the  whole proletariat in motion, and is moreover yet, for  a time, able to do so.''    ``The collisions between individual workmen and  individual bourgeois take more and more the character  of collisions between two classes. Thereupon  the workers begin to form combinations (Trades  Unions) against the bourgeois; they club together  in order to keep up the rate of wages; they found  permanent associations in order to make provision  beforehand for these occasional revolts. Here and  there the contest breaks out into riots. Now and  then the workers are victorious, but only for a time.  The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate  result, but in the ever-expanding union of  the workers. This union is helped on by the im-  proved means of communication that are created  by modern industry, and that place the workers  of different localities in contact with one another.  It was just this contact that was needed to centralize  the numerous local struggles, all of the same character,  into one national struggle between classes.  But every class struggle is a political struggle. And  that union, to attain which the burghers of the  Middle Ages, with their miserable highways, required  centuries, the modern proletarians, thanks to railways,  achieve in a few years. This organization of  the proletarians into a class, and consequently into  a political party, is continually being upset again by  the competition between the workers themselves. But  it ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier. It  compels legislative recognition of particular interests  of the workers, by taking advantage of the divisions  among the bourgeoisie itself.''    ``In the conditions of the proletariat, those of  old society at large are already virtually swamped.  The proletarian is without property; his relation  to his wife and children has no longer anything in  common with the bourgeois family-relations; modern  industrial labor, modern subjection to capital, the  same in England as in France, in America as in  Germany, has stripped him of every trace of national  character. Law, morality, religion, are to him so  many bourgeois prejudices, behind which lurk in  ambush just as many bourgeois interests. All the  preceding classes that got the upper hand, sought  to fortify their already acquired status by subjecting  society at large to their conditions of appropriation.  The proletarians cannot become masters  of the productive forces of society, except by abolishing  their own previous mode of appropriation, and  thereby also every other previous mode of appropriation.  They have nothing of their own to secure and to  fortify; their mission is to destroy all previous  securities for, and insurances of, individual property.  All previous historical movements were movements  of minorities, or in the interest of minorities. The  proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent  movement of the immense majority, in the  interest of the immense majority. The proletariat,  the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot  stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole super-  incumbent strata of official society being sprung  into the air.''    The Communists, says Marx, stand for the proletariat  as a whole. They are international. ``The  Communists are further reproached with desiring  to abolish countries and nationality. The working  men have no country. We cannot take from them  what they have not got.''    The immediate aim of the Communists is the conquests  of political power by the proletariat. ``The  theory of the Communists may be summed up in the  single sentence: Abolition of private property.''    The materialistic interpretation of history is  used to answer such charges as that Communism is  anti-Christian. ``The charges against Communism  made from a religious, a philosophical, and, generally,  from an ideological standpoint, are not deserving  of serious examination. Does it require deep  intuition to comprehend that man's ideas, views and  conceptions, in one word, man's consciousness,  changes with every change in the conditions of his  material existence, in his social relations, and in his  social life?''    The attitude of the Manifesto to the State is not  altogether easy to grasp. ``The executive of the  modern State,'' we are told, ``is but a Committee for  managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.''  Nevertheless, the first step for the proletariat  must be to acquire control of the State. ``We have  seen above, that the first step in the revolution by the  working class, is to raise the proletariat to the position  of ruling class, to win the battle of democracy.  The proletariat will use its political supremacy to  wrest, by degrees, all capital from the bourgeoisie,  to centralize all instruments of production in the  hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organized  as the ruling class; and to increase the total of productive  forces as rapidly as possible.''    The Manifesto passes on to an immediate program  of reforms, which would in the first instance  much increase the power of the existing State, but  it is contended that when the Socialist revolution is  accomplished, the State, as we know it, will have  ceased to exist. As Engels says elsewhere, when the  proletariat seizes the power of the State ``it puts an  end to all differences of class and antagonisms of  class, and consequently also puts an end to the State  as a State.'' Thus, although State Socialism might,  in fact, be the outcome of the proposals of Marx and  Engels, they cannot themselves be accused of any  glorification of the State.

I should like to get Drummond on to him.\"    \"I was expecting Drummond to tea,\" said Sheen.    \"He's running and passing with the fifteen,\" said Linton. \"He ought to  be in soon. Why, here he is. Hullo, Drummond!\"    \"Hullo!\" said the newcomer, looking at his two fellow-visitors as if he  were surprised to see them there.    \"How were the First?\" asked Dunstable.    \"Oh, rotten. Any tea left?\"    Conversation flagged from this point, and shortly afterwards Dunstable  and Linton went.    \"Come and tea with me some time,\" said Linton.    \"Oh, thanks,\" said Sheen. \"Thanks awfully.\"    \"It was rather a shame,\" said Linton to Dunstable, as they went back to  their study, \"rushing him like that. I shouldn't wonder if he's quite a  good sort, when one gets to know him.\"    \"He must be a rotter to let himself be rushed. By Jove, I should like  to see someone try that game on with me.\"    In the study they had left, Drummond was engaged in pointing this out  to Sheen.    \"The First are rank bad,\" he said. \"The outsides were passing rottenly  today. We shall have another forty points taken off us when we play  Ripton. By the way, I didn't know you were a pal of Linton's.\"    \"I'm not,\" said Sheen.    \"Well, he seemed pretty much at home just now.\"    \"I can't understand it. I'm certain I never asked him to tea. Or  Dunstable either. Yet they came in as if I had. I didn't like to hurt  their feelings by telling them.\"    Drummond stared.    \"What, they came without being asked! Heavens! man, you must buck up a  bit and keep awake, or you'll have an awful time. Of course those two  chaps were simply trying it on. I had an idea it might be that when I  came in. Why did you let them? Why didn't you scrag them?\"    \"Oh, I don't know,\" said Sheen uncomfortably.    \"But, look here, it's rot. You _must_ keep your end up in a place  like this, or everybody in the house'll be ragging you. Chaps will,  naturally, play the goat if you let them. Has this ever happened  before?\"    Sheen admitted reluctantly that it had. He was beginning to see things.  It is never pleasant to feel one has been bluffed.    \"Once last term,\" he said, \"Smith, a chap in Day's, came to tea like  that. I couldn't very well do anything.\"    \"And Dunstable is in Day's. They compared notes. I wonder you haven't  had the whole school dropping in on you, lining up in long queues down  the passage. Look here, Sheen, you really must pull yourself together.  I'm not ragging. You'll have a beastly time if you're so feeble. I hope  you won't be sick with me for saying it, but I can't help that. It's  all for your own good. And it's really pure slackness that's the cause  of it all.\"    \"I hate hurting people's feelings,\" said Sheen.    \"Oh, rot. As if anybody here had any feelings. Besides, it doesn't hurt  a chap's feelings being told to get out, when he knows he's no business  in a place.\"    \"Oh, all right,\" said Sheen shortly.    \"Glad you see it,\" said Drummond. \"Well, I'm off. Wonder if there's  anybody in that bath.\"    He reappeared a few moments later. During his absence Sheen overheard  certain shrill protestations which were apparently being uttered in the  neighbourhood of the bathroom door.    \"There was,\" he said, putting his head into the study and grinning  cheerfully at Sheen. \"There was young Renford, who had no earthly  business to be there. I've just looked in to point the moral. Suppose  you'd have let him bag all the hot water, which ought to have come to  his elders and betters, for fear of hurting his feelings; and gone  without your bath. I went on my theory that nobody at Wrykyn, least of  all a fag, has any feelings. I turfed him out without a touch of  remorse. You get much the best results my way. So long.\"    And the head disappeared; and shortly afterwards there came from across  the passage muffled but cheerful sounds of splashing.          IV    THE BETTER PART OF VALOUR      The borough of Wrykyn had been a little unfortunate--or fortunate,  according to the point of view--in the matter of elections. The latter  point of view was that of the younger and more irresponsible section of  the community, which liked elections because they were exciting. The  former was that of the tradespeople, who disliked them because they got  their windows broken.    Wrykyn had passed through an election and its attendant festivities in  the previous year, when Sir Eustace Briggs, the mayor of the town, had  been returned by a comfortable majority. Since then ill-health had  caused that gentleman to resign his seat, and the place was once more  in a state of unrest. This time the school was deeply interested in the  matter. The previous election had not stirred them. They did not care  whether Sir Eustace Briggs defeated Mr Saul Pedder, or whether Mr Saul  Pedder wiped the political floor with Sir Eustace Briggs. Mr Pedder was  an energetic Radical; but owing to the fact that Wrykyn had always  returned a Conservative member, and did not see its way to a change as  yet, his energy had done him very little good. The school had looked on  him as a sportsman, and read his speeches in the local paper with  amusement; but they were not interested. Now, however, things were  changed. The Conservative candidate, Sir William Bruce, was one of  themselves--an Old Wrykinian, a governor of the school, a man who  always watched school-matches, and the donor of the Bruce Challenge Cup  for the school mile. In fine, one of the best. He was also the father  of Jack Bruce, a day-boy on the engineering side. The school would have  liked to have made a popular hero of Jack Bruce. If he had liked, he  could have gone about with quite a suite of retainers. But he was a  quiet, self-sufficing youth, and was rarely to be seen in public. The  engineering side of a public school has workshops and other weirdnesses  which keep it occupied after the ordinary school hours. It was  generally understood that Bruce was a good sort of chap if you knew  him, but you had got to know him first; brilliant at his work, and  devoted to it; a useful slow bowler; known to be able to drive and  repair the family motor-car; one who seldom spoke unless spoken to, but  who, when he did speak, generally had something sensible to say. Beyond  that, report said little.    As he refused to allow the school to work off its enthusiasm on him,  they were obliged to work it off elsewhere. Hence the disturbances  which had become frequent between school and town. The inflammatory  speeches of Mr Saul Pedder had caused a swashbuckling spirit to spread  among the rowdy element of the town. Gangs of youths, to adopt the  police-court term, had developed a habit of parading the streets  arm-in-arm, shouting \"Good old Pedder!\" When these met some person or  persons who did not consider Mr Pedder good and old, there was  generally what the local police-force described as a \"frakkus\".    It was in one of these frakkuses that Linton had lost a valuable tooth.    Two days had elapsed since Dunstable and Linton had looked in on Sheen  for tea. It was a Saturday afternoon, and roll-call was just over.  There was no first fifteen match, only a rather uninteresting  house-match, Templar's _versus_ Donaldson's, and existence in the  school grounds showed signs of becoming tame.    \"What a beastly term the Easter term is,\" said Linton, yawning. \"There  won't be a thing to do till the house-matches begin properly.\"    Seymour's had won their first match, as had Day's. They would not be  called upon to perform for another week or more.    \"Let's get a boat out,\" suggested Dunstable.    \"Such a beastly day.\"    \"Let's have tea at the shop.\"    \"Rather slow. How about going to Cook's?\"    \"All right. Toss you who pays.\"    Cook's was a shop in the town to which the school most resorted when in  need of refreshment.    \"Wonder if we shall meet Albert.\"    Linton licked the place where his tooth should have been, and said he  hoped so.    Sergeant Cook, the six-foot proprietor of the shop, was examining a  broken window when they arrived, and muttering to himself.    \"Hullo!\" said Dunstable, \"what's this? New idea for ventilation? Golly,  massa, who frew dat brick?\"    \"Done it at ar-parse six last night, he did,\" said Sergeant Cook, \"the  red-'eaded young scallywag. Ketch 'im--I'll give 'im--\"    \"Sounds like dear old Albert,\" said Linton. \"Who did it, sergeant?\"    \"Red-headed young mongrel. 'Good old Pedder,' he says. 'I'll give you  Pedder,' I says. Then bang it comes right on top of the muffins, and  when I doubled out after 'im 'e'd gone.\"    Mrs Cook appeared and corroborated witness's evidence. Dunstable  ordered tea.    \"We may meet him on our way home,\" said Linton. \"If we do, I'll give  him something from you with your love. I owe him a lot for myself.\"    Mrs Cook clicked her tongue compassionately at the sight of the obvious  void in the speaker's mouth.    \"You'll 'ave to 'ave a forlse one, Mr Linton,\" said Sergeant Cook with  gloomy relish.    The back shop was empty. Dunstable and Linton sat down and began tea.  Sergeant Cook came to the door from time to time and dilated further on  his grievances.    \"Gentlemen from the school they come in 'ere and says ain't it all a  joke and exciting and what not. But I says to them, you 'aven't got to  live in it, I says. That's what it is. You 'aven't got to live in it, I  says. Glad when it's all over, that's what I'll be.\"    \"'Nother jug of hot water, please,\" said Linton.    The Sergeant shouted the order over his shoulder, as if he were  addressing a half-company on parade, and returned to his woes.    \"You 'aven't got to live in it, I says. That's what it is. It's this  everlasting worry and flurry day in and day out, and not knowing what's  going to 'appen next, and one man coming in and saying 'Vote for  Bruce', and another 'Vote for Pedder', and another saying how it's the  poor man's loaf he's fighting for--if he'd only _buy_ a"]]]
