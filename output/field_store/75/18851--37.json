It was still dusky with the darkness of night when he crossed the  Limberlost, dropping low enough to see its branches laid bare, to catch  a gleam of green in its swelling buds, and to hear the wavering chorus  of its frogs.  But there was no hesitation in his flight.  Straight and  sure he winged his way toward the shining river; and it was only a few  more miles until the rolling waters of its springtime flood caught his  eye.  Dropping precipitately, he plunged his burning beak into the  loved water; then he flew into a fine old stag sumac and tucked his  head under his wing for a short rest.  He had made the long flight in  one unbroken sweep, and he was sleepy.  In utter content he ruffled his  feathers and closed his eyes, for he was beside the shining river; and  it would be another season before the orange orchard would ring again  with his \"Good Cheer! Good Cheer!\"        Chapter 2    \"Wet year! Wet year!\" prophesied the Cardinal      The sumac seemed to fill his idea of a perfect location from the very  first.  He perched on a limb, and between dressing his plumage and  pecking at last year's sour dried berries, he sent abroad his  prediction.  Old Mother Nature verified his wisdom by sending a dashing  shower, but he cared not at all for a wetting.  He knew how to turn his  crimson suit into the most perfect of water-proof coats; so he  flattened his crest, sleeked his feathers, and breasting the April  downpour, kept on calling for rain.  He knew he would appear brighter  when it was past, and he seemed to know, too, that every day of  sunshine and shower would bring nearer his heart's desire.    He was a very Beau Brummel while he waited.  From morning until night  he bathed, dressed his feathers, sunned himself, fluffed and flirted.  He strutted and \"chipped\" incessantly.  He claimed that sumac for his  very own, and stoutly battled for possession with many intruders.  It  grew on a densely wooded slope, and the shining river went singing  between grassy banks, whitened with spring beauties, below it.  Crowded  around it were thickets of papaw, wild grape-vines, thorn, dogwood, and  red haw, that attracted bug and insect; and just across the old snake  fence was a field of mellow mould sloping to the river, that soon would  be plowed for corn, turning out numberless big fat grubs.    He was compelled almost hourly to wage battles for his location, for  there was something fine about the old stag sumac that attracted  homestead seekers.  A sober pair of robins began laying their  foundations there the morning the Cardinal arrived, and a couple of  blackbirds tried to take possession before the day had passed.  He had  little trouble with the robins.  They were easily conquered, and with  small protest settled a rod up the bank in a wild-plum tree; but the  air was thick with \"chips,\" chatter, and red and black feathers, before  the blackbirds acknowledged defeat.  They were old-timers, and knew  about the grubs and the young corn; but they also knew when they were  beaten, so they moved down stream to a scrub oak, trying to assure each  other that it was the place they really had wanted from the first.    The Cardinal was left boasting and strutting in the sumac, but in his  heart he found it lonesome business.  Being the son of a king, he was  much too dignified to beg for a mate, and besides, it took all his time  to guard the sumac; but his eyes were wide open to all that went on  around him, and he envied the blackbird his glossy, devoted little  sweetheart, with all his might.  He almost strained his voice trying to  rival the love-song of a skylark that hung among the clouds above a  meadow across the river, and poured down to his mate a story of adoring  love and sympathy.  He screamed a \"Chip\" of such savage jealousy at a  pair of killdeer lovers that he sent them scampering down the river  bank without knowing that the crime of which they stood convicted was  that of being mated when he was not.  As for the doves that were  already brooding on the line fence beneath the maples, the Cardinal was  torn between two opinions.    He was alone, he was love-sick, and he was holding the finest building  location beside the shining river for his mate, and her slowness in  coming made their devotion difficult to endure when he coveted a true  love; but it seemed to the Cardinal that he never could so forget  himself as to emulate the example of that dove lover.  The dove had no  dignity; he was so effusive he was a nuisance.  He kept his dignified  Quaker mate stuffed to discomfort; he clung to the side of the nest  trying to help brood until he almost crowded her from the eggs.  He  pestered her with caresses and cooed over his love-song until every  chipmunk on the line fence was familiar with his story.  The Cardinal's  temper was worn to such a fine edge that he darted at the dove one day  and pulled a big tuft of feathers from his back.  When he had returned  to the sumac, he was compelled to admit that his anger lay quite as  much in that he had no one to love as because the dove was disgustingly  devoted.    Every morning brought new arrivals--trim young females fresh from their  long holiday, and big boastful males appearing their brightest and  bravest, each singer almost splitting his throat in the effort to  captivate the mate he coveted.  They came flashing down the river bank,  like rockets of scarlet, gold, blue, and black; rocking on the willows,  splashing in the water, bursting into jets of melody, making every  possible display of their beauty and music; and at times fighting  fiercely when they discovered that the females they were wooing  favoured their rivals and desired only to be friendly with them.    The heart of the Cardinal sank as he watched.  There was not a member  of his immediate family among them.  He pitied himself as he wondered  if fate had in store for him the trials he saw others suffering.  Those  dreadful feathered females! How they coquetted!  How they flirted! How  they sleeked and flattened their plumage, and with half-open beaks and  sparkling eyes, hopped closer and closer as if charmed.  The eager  singers, with swelling throats, sang and sang in a very frenzy of  extravagant pleading, but just when they felt sure their little loves  were on the point of surrender, a rod distant above the bushes would go  streaks of feathers, and there was nothing left but to endure the  bitter disappointment, follow them, and begin all over.  For the last  three days the Cardinal had been watching his cousin, rose-breasted  Grosbeak, make violent love to the most exquisite little female, who  apparently encouraged his advances, only to see him left sitting as  blue and disconsolate as any human lover, when he discovers that the  maid who has coquetted with him for a season belongs to another man.    The Cardinal flew to the very top of the highest sycamore and looked  across country toward the Limberlost.  Should he go there seeking a  swamp mate among his kindred?  It was not an endurable thought.  To be  sure, matters were becoming serious.  No bird beside the shining river  had plumed, paraded, or made more music than he.  Was it all to be  wasted?  By this time he confidently had expected results.  Only that  morning he had swelled with pride as he heard Mrs. Jay tell her  quarrelsome husband that she wished she could exchange him for the  Cardinal.  Did not the gentle dove pause by the sumac, when she left  brooding to take her morning dip in the dust, and gaze at him with  unconcealed admiration?  No doubt she devoutly wished her plain pudgy  husband wore a scarlet coat.  But it is praise from one's own sex that  is praise indeed, and only an hour ago the lark had reported that from  his lookout above cloud he saw no other singer anywhere so splendid as  the Cardinal of the sumac.  Because of these things he held fast to his  conviction that he was a prince indeed; and he decided to remain in his  chosen location and with his physical and vocal attractions compel the  finest little cardinal in the fields to seek him.    He planned it all very carefully: how she would hear his splendid music  and come to take a peep at him; how she would be captivated by his size  and beauty; how she would come timidly, but come, of course, for his  approval; how he would condescend to accept her if she pleased him in  all particulars; how she would be devoted to him; and how she would  approve his choice of a home, for the sumac was in a lovely spot for  scenery, as well as nest-building.    For several days he had boasted, he had bantered, he had challenged, he  had on this last day almost condescended to coaxing, but not one little  bright-eyed cardinal female had come to offer herself.    The performance of a brown thrush drove him wild with envy.  The thrush  came gliding up the river bank, a rusty-coated, sneaking thing of the  underbrush, and taking possession of a thorn bush just opposite the  sumac, he sang for an hour in the open.  There was no way to improve  that music.  It was woven fresh from the warp and woof of his fancy.  It was a song so filled with the joy and gladness of spring, notes so  thrilled with love's pleading and passion's tender pulsing pain, that  at its close there were a half-dozen admiring thrush females gathered  around.  With care and deliberation the brown thrush selected the most  attractive, and she followed him to the thicket as if charmed.    It was the Cardinal's dream materialized for another before his very  eyes, and it filled him with envy.  If that plain brown bird that  slinked as if he had a theft to account for, could, by showing himself  and singing for an hour, win a mate, why should not he, the most  gorgeous bird of the woods, openly flaunting his charms and discoursing  his music, have at "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53356"],[0,"Kate Vernon: A Tale.

And then,   Kate, we must bide our time.\"     \"And are there no more active steps to be taken? Could you not write   to this nephew; assure him you have paid the money, and advise him not   to expose himself to universal opprobrium by acting so base a part.\"     \"Ah, Kate, my own warm hearted child!\" said her grandfather, sadly,   \"God grant you may not have to struggle with the world of which you   are so ignorant. \"Universal opprobrium,\" is an expression frequently   and flourishingly put forth by newspaper editors; and it may be   occasionally drawn down by the singularly flagrant acts of some   public characters, but the dread of it never yet withheld any man, so   inclined, from preying on his fellows in private life; and it will   take many more years' experience to convince you how utterly fruitless   and unorthodox such a proceeding would be.\"     \"Well, grandpapa, if I am useless as a counsellor can I not be an   agent and assist you in your search.\"     \"Yes, send away the breakfast things and tell nurse to bring me the   tin box, and oak brass-bound cabinet that are in my room; make Susan   help her, they are too heavy for her unassisted strength.\"     True to his character, D'Arcy Vernon had room in his heart to think   for another, though borne down by the weight of a deeper anxiety   than he had ever felt before. His former reverse of fortune, obliged   him to renounce the pomps and vanities of high life, and soon custom   proved them to be, trifles indeed; but here was a question involving   the possibility, nay he could scarcely hide it from himself, the   probability of beggary.     \"Athen, mavourneen; it's the sore heart's within me this day to be   carryin down thim onlooky boxes; sure, I ses to meself the minit I set   eyes on that big baste iv a blue letther, faith mee dhrame's out sure   enough; an it's not for the likes iv mee to be spaken to quolity, but   it was just on the tip iv mee tongue to say 'throw it in the fire,   Kurnel jewel, an don't meddle or make with the likes iv it at all, at   all.' Sure I knew at oncet it kem from Moore's place, be the look iv   it. Oh, what was in it, good or bad Miss Kate, avourneen?\"     Nurse was too old and devoted a friend to be excluded from the   family councils, and Miss Vernon was too well acquainted with her   affectionate self-forgetful nature to consider her question intrusive.     \"Only some business, dear nurse; it may be troublesome or may not, but   cannot be avoided, even by your good advice; so just bring down the   boxes, and you shall hear more when I have more to tell, and, nurse,\"   turning back from the dining-room door, \"should Mr. Winter or Mr.   Gilpin, or any one call, you had better say that grandpapa and I are   particularly engaged.\"     \"The Lord look down on me!\" soliloquised Mrs. O'Toole, as she crossed   herself, with an air of alarm, \"not see Winther nor the crather iv an   Organist. Faith there is throuble gotherin sure enough, I knew be the   darlint's two eyes there was throuble in her heart this week past;   sure we were too long quiet an happy, that thim divils iv attorneys   should remember us.

Susy yer idle gowk, are ye goin to lave me to pull the arrums   out of mee, liftin a ton weight here, widout puttin a finger to help   me?\"     And diligently did the Colonel and his granddaughter untie, read, and   examine, and re-tie the numerous bundles of papers and letters.     Now a packet in Lady Desmond's clear firm writing was laid aside, now   a smaller one in Kate's own hand; rapturous letters, describing the   enjoyments of her memorable visit to London, the only time she had   ever been away from her grandfather; now turning over large yellow   parchments, with red seals hanging from them, now eagerly examining a   pile of papers whose crabbed writing bespoke business. It was weary   work; Kate, with all the hopeful energy of youth, rapidly searching   through each of the packets at all likely to contain a solicitor's   letter, and handing them to her grandfather, who, latterly, leaned   wearily back in his chair, and examined them languidly. Once his arm   stole round her, as she knelt beside the pile of papers on the floor,   and she felt how eloquent of despondency, was the close embrace with   which he held her to him; but she constrained herself to receive it   in silence, and took no further notice than to kiss, warmly, the hand   which pressed her to his heart, as the last and best treasure left him.     \"You are tired and cold,\" said she, rising, \"I will stir the fire, and   then, come and put your feet on the fender, and I will replace these   packets we have examined in the box, and open all Lady Desmonds'   letters, some such paper may have got among them.\"     \"As you like, as you like, my dear child.\"     There was a long silence, broken only by the rustling of the papers.   Half an hour elapsed, and at length Vernon, rousing himself, said--     \"Do not tire yourself longer, give me my desk, I had better tell Moore   there is not a symptom here of what we want.\"     \"Wait a very little longer, there is only one packet more, of   Georgina's; let us not give up too soon, dear grandpapa.\" A few   minutes after she came over to him with an old-looking letter in her   hand. \"This is signed, 'A. Taaffe,' look at it.\"     Vernon took it eagerly.     \"Ha, this may be useful, how could it have got among Georgina's   letters?\"     Kate read over his shoulder.                                            \"_Anne Street, June, 23, 18--._      \"DEAR SIR,     \"I have just received yours of the 21st, with its enclosure, many   thanks for your obliging efforts to comply with my wishes.     \"I have directed my solicitor to prepare the necessary warrants, they   will be ready by Monday or Tuesday at farthest, when I will execute   them and send them to you,                                        \"Your obliged and obedient servant,                                                                \"A.

Dearest of grandfathers will not that utterly annihilate Mr.  Taaffe?\"    \"Well, I think it must be sufficient; thank Heaven, my love, you  thought of searching among Georgy's letters; now I must write  immediately, to Moore, and I have scarce time. You can put away all  these papers.\"    With a lightened heart Kate prepared to obey, and so visible was  the change from darkness to light, in her countenance, that nurse  exclaimed, on receiving from her the letter for the post.    \"Faith, an sure, Miss Kate, you've been makin the masther tell Misther  Moore to hold his prate an lave off pinin' any more of his three an  four pinnys to him.\"    \"No; not exactly that nurse, but I think we shall soon have done with  him.\"    \"The Lord send!

An invitation to  tea from Mr. Winter,\" said Kate, returning to the dining-room, where  the Colonel was putting away his writing materials. \"Do you feel equal  to it?\"    \"Decidedly, my dear--I want to have a little kindly, honesty, after  having had a scoundrel before my mind's eye all the morning; we will  go and have a rubber, and a song. How poor Egerton used to enjoy our  little parties.\"    \"And how much more he would enjoy horse-whipping, Mr. Taaffe,\" cried  Kate, as she locked the tin box.    \"I believe he would,\" said the Colonel, laughing. \"You and Egerton  certainly understood each other.\"          CHAPTER II.    UNCERTAINTY.      Welcome indeed was the gleam of hope, afforded by this discovery, to  the Colonel and Kate.    To their non-legal minds, it appeared that any acknowledgment of money  received, was sufficient, although no sum was mentioned; and Kate even  felt remorse for her hasty condemnation of Mr. Taaffe; as she concluded  the production of the newly found letter, would settle the question at  once, and for ever, and draw forth an humble apology from the offender;  her spirits rose even above their usual height, and overleaping,  with the sanguine vivacity of her age and race, all intervening  probabilities, she revelled in her anticipated visit to Italy, and  spent many a pleasant half-hour in endeavouring to overcome nurse's  inveterate antipathy to \"thim rampagin divils, the Frinch\" (under which  name she classed all foreign nations and foreigners), and in exercising  her powers of persuasion to induce the Winters and Gilpin to join in  the pilgrimage.    \"You know we would not travel in"]]]
