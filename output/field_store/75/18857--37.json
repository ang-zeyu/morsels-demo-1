Soon afterwards, in 1498, he was bursar;  and tradition has connected with him the building of the graceful tower  which is one of the chief architectural ornaments of Oxford.  Unfortunately the tower was finished in the year in which Wolsey became  bursar, and all that he can have done was the prosaic duty of paying the  bills for its erection. He continued his work of schoolmaster till in  1500 the Marquis of Dorset, whose sons Wolsey had taught, gave him the  living of Lymington in Somerset.    So Wolsey abandoned academic life for the quietness of a country living,  which, however, did not prove to be entirely free from troubles. For  some reason which is not clear, a neighbouring squire, Sir Amyas Paulet,  used his power as justice of peace to set Wolsey in the stocks, an  affront which Wolsey did not forgive, but in the days of his power  punished by confining Sir Amyas to his London house, where he lived for  some years in disgrace. If this story be true, it is certainly not to  Wolsey's discredit, who can have been moved by nothing but a sense of  injustice in thus reviving the remembrance of his own past history.  Moreover, Wolsey's character certainly did not suffer at the time, as in  1501 he was made chaplain to Dean, Archbishop of Canterbury. After  Dean's death in 1503, his capacity for business was so far established  that he was employed by Sir Richard Nanfan, Deputy-Lieutenant of Calais,  to help him in the duties of a post which advancing years made somewhat  onerous. When Nanfan, a few years afterwards, retired from public life,  he recommended Wolsey to the king, and Wolsey entered the royal service  as chaplain probably in 1506.    At Court Wolsey allied himself with Richard Fox, Bishop of Winchester,  Lord Privy Seal, and at first seems to have acted as one of his  secretaries.    Fox was a well-trained and careful official, who had been in Henry  VII.'s employment all through his reign. Cold and cautious by nature,  Henry VII. had to pick his way through many difficulties, and took no  man unreservedly into his confidence. He was his own minister, and chose  to be served by men of distinguished position who were content to do his  bidding faithfully, and were free from personal ambition. For this  purpose ecclesiastics were best adapted, and Henry VII. did much to  secularise the Church by throwing the weight of public business into the  hands of men like Morton and Fox, whom he rewarded by the highest  ecclesiastical offices. In such a school Wolsey was trained as a  statesman. He regarded it as natural that the King should choose his  ministers for their readiness to serve his purposes, and should reward  them by ecclesiastical preferments. The State might gain by such a plan,  but the Church undoubtedly lost; and in following the career of Wolsey  there is little to remind us of the ecclesiastic, however much we may  admire the statesman.    It was well for England that Wolsey was trained in the traditions of the  policy of Henry VII., which he never forgot. Henry VII. aimed, in the  first place, at securing his throne and restoring quiet and order in his  kingdom by developing trade and commerce. For this purpose he strove to  turn his foreign neighbours into allies without adventuring into any  military enterprises. He did not aspire to make England great, but he  tried to make her secure and prosperous. Wolsey gained so much insight  into the means which he employed for that end that he never forgot their  utility; and though he tried to pass beyond the aim of Henry VII., he  preferred to extend rather than abandon the means which Henry VII. had  carefully devised. Nor was Wolsey merely a spectator of Henry VII.'s  diplomacy; he was soon employed as one of its agents. In the spring of  1508 he was sent to Scotland to keep King James IV. true to his alliance  with England, and explain misunderstandings that had arisen. In the  autumn of the same year he was sent to Mechlin to win over the powerful  minister of Maximilian, the Bishop of Gurk, to a project of marriage  between Henry VII. and Maximilian's daughter Margaret, by which Henry  hoped that he would get control of the Low Countries. Here Wolsey  learned his first practical lesson of diplomatic methods, and uttered  the complaint, which in later years he gave so much reason to others to  pour forth, \"There is here so much inconstancy, mutability, and little  regard of promises and causes, that in their appointments there is  little trust or surety; for things surely determined to be done one day  are changed and altered the next.\"    Nothing came of Wolsey's embassy, nor can we be sure that Henry VII. was  much in earnest in his marriage schemes. However, he died in April next  year, and was succeeded by a son whose matrimonial hesitations were  destined to give Wolsey more trouble than those of his father. Before  his death he laid the foundation of Wolsey's clerical fortunes by  bestowing on him the rich deanery of Lincoln.    The accession of Henry VIII. made little change in the composition of  the King's Council. The Lady Margaret survived her son long enough to  make her influence felt in the choice of her grandson's advisers.  Archbishop Warham, Bishop Fox, and Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, were  the men into whose hands public business naturally fell. But Warham was  somewhat stiff and crabbed, so that he did not commend himself to the  young king. Fox represented the opinions of the old officials, while the  Earl of Surrey was the natural leader of the old nobility, who could not  help resenting the subordinate position into which they had been reduced  by Henry VII., and hoped that a new reign would give them fresh  opportunities. So Fox urged caution and carefulness, while Surrey  favoured extravagance and military ambition. Fox felt that he was  growing old, and the pressure of a continued conflict of opinion was  irksome to him. Much as the ecclesiastics of that time were secular in  their lives, they were rarely entirely forgetful of their priestly  office, and were genuinely anxious to rid themselves of the burden of  affairs and spend their last years in quiet. So Fox chose Wolsey as the  man to take his place, perhaps because he saw in him the qualities  necessary to influence the young king. Besides him he favoured Ruthal,  another experienced official, who was rewarded by the rich bishopric of  Durham, but who was soon eclipsed by the superior genius of Wolsey,  which he frankly admitted, and willingly accepted the post of Wolsey's  assistant and subordinate.    So Wolsey was made the king's almoner, and had sundry preferments  bestowed on him as marks of the royal favour. He ingratiated himself  with the king, and worked with Fox and Ruthal to counteract the  influence of the Earl of Surrey. Probably in 1511 he was called to the  King's Council, but neither he nor Fox had it in their power to shape  the king's policy as they wished, or to direct his doings. His warlike  ardour was against their will; but from the beginning of his reign Henry  VIII. went his own way, and others had to follow. All they could do was  to show him that they were the most capable of his servants, and when  Henry VIII. had determined on war they were the men to whom he turned to  carry out the necessary details. On Wolsey as the youngest the chief  labour was thrown. England was unprepared for war, and every branch of  the military service had to be almost created. Wolsey had at all events  a sufficient opportunity for displaying his practical capacity as an  organiser.    So Wolsey worked at providing for the troops who were sent to Guienne in  1512; but the expedition itself was a complete failure. Ferdinand played  his own game of procrastination, and sent no succours. The Marquis of  Dorset was an incapable leader. The English troops were not inured to  hardships, and soon grew discontented; at last they rose in open mutiny,  and clamoured to be led back to England. Dorset was driven to retire  without striking a blow. The first attempt of England to assert her  prowess ended in disaster. The statesmen of the Continent made merry  over the blundering efforts of an upstart power. \"The English,\" they  said, \"are so unaccustomed to war that they have no experience to guide  them.\" Henry longed to wipe out this disgrace, and prepared to invade  the north of France in the next year. Wolsey was not yet of sufficient  importance to direct the king's policy, and had no experience of war.  But he threw himself heart and soul into the task of military  organisation, and the administrative capacity which he displayed secured  his hold on the king's favour. He provided for victualling the fleet,  raised the necessary number of ships, selected their captains, and even  apportioned the gunners. Nothing was too trivial for his attention, even  down to beer-barrels and biscuits. It is not surprising that his  colleague, Bishop Fox, wrote to him, \"I pray God send us with speed, and  soon deliver you of your outrageous charge and labour.\"    The fleet put to sea in March 1513, under the command of the Lord  Admiral Sir Edward Howard. The French fleet was far superior in numbers,  and prepared to prevent the English from landing on the French coast.  Sir Edward Howard was burning with desire for a decisive engagement, and  on 25th April attacked the French galleys as they lay in shallow water.  He boarded them with his boats, and himself leapt on to the ship of the  French admiral, but before his men could follow him their cable was cut  away, and he was left almost alone. Seeing that there was no hope of  support, he took his whistle from his neck and cast it into the sea;  then with his gilt target on his arm he fought till the enemy's pikes  thrust him overboard and he was drowned.

His features were of the  straight type which has been called from time immemorial patrician. He  had dark hair which escaped in waves from under his hat, and black eyes  that snapped when they perceived Miss Virginia Carvel. At sight of her,  indeed, the gold-headed cane stopped in its gyrations in midair.    \"Why, Jinny!\" he cried--\"Jinny!\"    Mr. Hopper would have sold his soul to have been in the young man's  polished boots, to have worn his clothes, and to have been able to cry  out to the young lady, \"Why, Jinny!\"    To Mr. Hopper's surprise, the young lady did not turn around. She stood  perfectly still. But a red flush stole upon her cheek, and laughter  was dancing in her eyes yet she did not move. The young man took a step  forward, and then stood staring at her with such a comical expression  of injury on his face as was too much for Miss Jinny's serenity.  She laughed. That laugh also struck minor chords upon Mr. Hopper's  heart-strings.    But the young gentleman very properly grew angry.    \"You've no right to treat me the way you do, Virginia,\" he cried. \"Why  didn't you let me know that you were coming home?\" His tone was one of  authority. \"You didn't come from Kentucky alone!\"    \"I had plenty of attendance, I assure you,\" said Miss Carvel. \"A  governor, and a senator, and two charming young gentlemen from New  Orleans as far as Cairo, where I found Captain Lige's boat. And Mr.  Brinsmade brought me here to the store. I wanted to surprise Pa,\" she  continued rapidly, to head off the young gentleman's expostulations.  \"How mean of him not to be here!\"    \"Allow me to escort you home,\" said he, with ceremony:    \"Allow me to decline the honah, Mr. Colfax,\" she cried, imitating him.  \"I intend to wait here until Pa comes in.\"    Then Eliphalet knew that the young gentleman was Miss Virginia's first  cousin. And it seemed to him that he had heard a rumor, amongst the  clerks in the store; that she was to marry him one day.    \"Where is Uncle Comyn?\" demanded Mr. Colfax, swinging his cane with  impatience.    Virgina looked hard at Mr. Hopper.    \"I don't know,\" she said.    \"Ephum!\" shouted Mr. Colfax. \"Ephum! Easters where the deuce is that  good-for-nothing husband of yours?\"    \"I dunno, Marse Clarence. 'Spec he whah he oughtn't ter be.\"    Mr. Colfax spied the stooping figure of Eliphalet.    \"Do you work here?\" he demanded.    \"I callate.\"    \"What?\"    \"I callate to,\" responded Mr. Hopper again, without rising.    \"Please find Mr. Hood,\" directed Mr. Colfax, with a wave of his cane,  \"and say that Miss Carvel is here--\"    Whereupon Miss Carvel seated herself upon the edge of a bale and  giggled, which did not have a soothing effect upon either of the young  men. How abominably you were wont to behave in those days, Virginia.    \"Just say that Mr. Colfax sent you,\" Clarence continued, with a note of  irritation. \"There's a good fellow.\"    Virginia laughed outright. Her cousin did not deign to look at her. His  temper was slipping its leash.    \"I wonder whether you hear me,\" he remarked.    No answer.    \"Colonel Carvel hires you, doesn't he? He pays you wages, and the  first time his daughter comes in here you refuse to do her a favor. By  thunder, I'll see that you are dismissed.\"    Still Eliphalet gave him no manner of attention, but began marking the  tags at the bottom of the pile.    It was at this unpropitious moment that Colonel Carvel walked into the  store, and his daughter flew into his arms.    \"Well, well,\" he said, kissing her, \"thought you'd surprise me, eh,  Jinny?\"    \"Oh, Pa,\" she cried, looking reproachfully up at his Face. \"You  knew--how mean of you!\"    \"I've been down on the Louisiana, where some inconsiderate man told me,  or I should not have seen you today. I was off to Alton. But what are  these goings-on?\" said the Colonel, staring at young Mr. Colfax, rigid  as one of his own gamecocks. He was standing defiantly over the stooping  figure of the assistant manager.    \"Oh,\" said Virginia, indifferently, \"it's only Clarence. He's so  tiresome. He's always wanting to fight with somebody.\"    \"What's the matter, Clarence?\" asked the Colonel, with the mild  unconcern which deceived so many of the undiscerning.    \"This person, sir, refused to do a favor for your daughter. She told  him, and I told him, to notify Mr. Hood that Miss Carvel was here, and  he refused.\"    Mr. Hopper continued his occupation, which was absorbing. But he was  listening.    Colonel Carvel pulled his goatee, and smiled.    \"Clarence,\" said he, \"I reckon I can run this establishment without any  help from you and Jinny. I've been at it now for a good many years.\"    If Mr. Barbo had not been constitutionally unlucky, he might have  perceived Mr. Hopper, before dark that evening, in conversation with Mr.  Hood about a certain customer who lived up town, and presently leave the  store by the side entrance. He walked as rapidly as his legs would carry  him, for they were a trifle short for his body; and in due time, as the  lamps were flickering, he arrived near Colonel Carvel's large double  residence, on Tenth and Locust streets. Then he walked slowly along  Tenth, his eyes lifted to the tall, curtained windows. Now and anon they  scanned passers-by for a chance acquaintance.    Mr. Hopper walked around the block, arriving again opposite the Carvel  house, and beside Mr. Renault's, which was across from it. Eliphalet had  inherited the principle of mathematical chances. It is a fact that  the discreet sometimes take chances. Towards the back of Mr. Renault's  residence, a wide area was sunk to the depth of a tall man, which  was apparently used for the purpose of getting coal and wood into the  cellar. Mr. Hopper swept the neighborhood with a glance. The coast was  clear, and he dropped into the area.    Although the evening was chill, at first Mr. Hopper perspired very  freely. He crouched in the area while the steps of pedestrians beat  above his head, and took no thought but of escape. At last, however, he  grew cooler, removed his hat, and peeped over the stone coping. Colonel  Carvel's house--her house--was now ablaze with lights, and the shades  not yet drawn. There was the dining room, where the negro butler  was moving about the table; and the pantry, where the butler went  occasionally; and the kitchen, with black figures moving about. But  upstairs on the two streets was the sitting room. The straight figure  of the Colonel passed across the light. He held a newspaper in his hand.  Suddenly, full in the window, he stopped and flung away the paper. A  graceful shadow slipped across the wall. Virginia laid her hands on  his shoulders, and he stooped to kiss her. Now they sat between the  curtains, she on the arm of his chair and leaning on him, together  looking out of the window.    How long this lasted Mr. Hopper could not say. Even the wise forget  themselves. But all at once a wagon backed and bumped against the curb  in front of him, and Eliphalet's head dropped as if it had been struck  by the wheel. Above him a sash screamed as it opened, and he heard Mr.  Renault's voice say, to some person below:    \"Is that you, Capitaine Grant?\"    \"The same,\" was the brief reply.    \"I am charmed that you have brought the wood. I thought that you had  forgotten me.\"    \"I try to do what I say, Mr. Renault.\"    \"Attendez--wait!\" cried Mr. Renault, and closed the window.    Now was Eliphalet's chance to bolt. The perspiration had come again,  and it was cold. But directly the excitable little man, Renault, had  appeared on the pavement above him. He had been running.    \"It is a long voyage from Gravois with a load of wood, Capitaine--I am  very grateful.\"    \"Business is business, Mr. Renault,\" was the self-contained reply.    \"Alphonse!\" cried Mr. Renault, \"Alphonse!\" A door opened in the back  wall. \"Du vin pour Monsieur le Capitaine.\"    \"Oui, M'sieu.\"    Eliphalet was too frightened to wonder why this taciturn handler of wood  was called Captain, and treated with such respect.    \"Guess I won't take any wine to-night, Mr. Renault,\" said he. \"You go  inside, or you'll take cold.\"    Mr. Renault protested, asked about all the residents of Gravois way,  and finally obeyed. Eliphalet's heart was in his mouth. A bolder spirit  would have dashed for liberty. Eliphalet did not possess that kind of  bravery. He was waiting for the Captain to turn toward his wagon.    He looked down the area instead, with the light from the street lamp on  his face. Fear etched an ineffaceable portrait of him on Mr. Hopper's  mind, so that he knew him instantly when he saw him years afterward.  Little did he reckon that the fourth time he was to see him this man was  to be President of the United States. He wore a close-cropped beard,  an old blue army overcoat, and his trousers were tucked into a pair of  muddy cowhide boots.    Swiftly but silently the man reached down and hauled Eliphalet to the  sidewalk by the nape of the neck.    \"What were you doing there?\" demanded he of the blue overcoat, sternly.    Eliphalet did not answer. With one frantic wrench he freed himself, and  ran down Locust Street. At the corner, turning fearfully, he perceived  the man in the overcoat calmly preparing to unload his wood.          CHAPTER III. THE UNATTAINABLE SIMPLICITY    To Mr. Hopper the being caught was the unpardonable crime. And indeed,  with many of us, it is humiliation and not conscience which makes the  sting. He walked out to the end of the city's growth westward, where the  new houses were going up. He had reflected coolly on consequences, and  found there were none to speak of. Many a moralist, Mr. Davitt included,  would have shaken his head at this. Miss Crane's whole Puritan household  would have raised their hands in horror at such a doctrine.
