She got blown to the Land of Oz by a cyclone, and while she was here  the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman accompanied her on her travels.\"    \"And where is she now?\" inquired the Pumpkinhead.    \"Glinda the Good, who rules the Quadlings, sent her home again,\" said the  boy.    \"Oh. And what became of the Scarecrow?\"    \"I told you. He rules the Emerald City,\" answered Tip.    \"I thought you said it was ruled by a wonderful Wizard,\" objected Jack,  seeming more and more confused.    \"Well, so I did. Now, pay attention, and I'll explain it,\" said Tip,  speaking slowly and looking the smiling Pumpkinhead squarely in the eye.  \"Dorothy went to the Emerald City to ask the Wizard to send her back to  Kansas; and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman went with her. But the Wizard  couldn't send her back, because he wasn't so much of a Wizard as he might  have been. And then they got angry at the Wizard, and threatened        37  to expose him; so the Wizard made a big balloon and escaped in it, and  no one has ever seen him since.\"    \"Now, that is very interesting history,\" said Jack, well pleased; \"and I  understand it perfectly all but the explanation.\"    \"I'm glad you do,\" responded Tip. \"After the Wizard was gone, the people of  the Emerald City made His Majesty, the Scarecrow, their King; \"and I have  heard that he became a very popular ruler.\"    \"Are we going to see this queer King?\" asked Jack, with interest.    \"I think we may as well,\" replied the boy; \"unless you have something better  to do.\"    \"Oh, no, dear father,\" said the Pumpkinhead. \"I am quite willing to go  wherever you please.\"                   Line-Art Drawing        38               Full page line-art drawing.        39               Tip Makes an Experiment in Magic      The boy, small and rather delicate in appearance seemed somewhat embarrassed  at being called \"father\" by the tall, awkward, pumpkinheaded man, but to  deny the relationship would involve another long and tedious explanation; so  he changed the subject by asking, abruptly:    \"Are you tired?\"    \"Of course not!\" replied the other. \"But,\" he continued, after a pause, \"it  is quite certain I shall  wear out my wooden joints if I keep on walking.\"    Tip reflected, as they journeyed on, that this was true. He began to regret  that he had not constructed the wooden limbs more carefully and  substantially. Yet how could he ever have guessed        40  that the man he had made merely to scare old Mombi with would be brought to  life by means of a magical powder contained in an old pepper-box?    So he ceased to reproach himself, and began to think how he might yet remedy  the deficiencies of Jack's weak joints.    While thus engaged they came to the edge of a wood, and the boy sat down to  rest upon an old sawhorse that some woodcutter had left there.    \"Why don't you sit down?\" he asked the Pumpkinhead.    \"Won't it strain my joints?\" inquired the other.    \"Of course not. It'll rest them,\" declared the boy.    So Jack tried to sit down; but as soon as he bent his joints farther than  usual they gave way altogether, and he came clattering to the ground with  such a crash that Tip feared he was entirely ruined.                   Line-Art Drawing along right side of this page        41    He rushed to the man, lifted him to his feet, straightened his arms and  legs, and felt of his head to see if by chance it had become cracked. But  Jack seemed to be in pretty good shape, after all, and Tip said to him:    \"I guess you'd better remain standing, hereafter. It seems the safest way.\"    \"Very well, dear father.\" just as you say, replied the smiling Jack, who had  been in no wise confused by his tumble.    Tip sat down again. Presently the Pumpkinhead asked:    \"What is that thing you are sitting on?\"    \"Oh, this is a horse,\" replied the boy, carelessly.    \"What is a horse?\" demanded Jack.    \"A horse? Why, there are two kinds of horses,\" returned Tip, slightly  puzzled how to explain. \"One kind of horse is alive, and has four legs and a  head and a tail. And people ride upon its back.\"    \"I understand,\" said Jack, cheerfully \"That's the kind of horse you are now  sitting on.\"    \"No, it isn't,\" answered Tip, promptly.    \"Why not? That one has four legs, and a head, and a tail.\" Tip looked at the  saw-horse more carefully, and found that the Pumpkinhead was right. The body        42  had been formed from a tree-trunk, and a branch had been left sticking up at  one end that looked very much like a tail. In the other end were two big  knots that resembled eyes, and a place had been chopped away that might  easily be mistaken for the horse's mouth. As for the legs, they were four  straight limbs cut from trees and stuck fast into the body, being spread  wide apart so that the saw-horse would stand firmly when a log was laid  across it to be sawed.    \"This thing resembles a real horse more than I imagined,\" said Tip, trying  to explain. \"But a real horse is alive, and trots and prances and eats oats,  while this is nothing more than a dead horse, made of wood, and used to saw  logs upon.\"    \"If it were alive, wouldn't it trot, and prance, and eat oats?\" inquired the  Pumpkinhead.    \"It would trot and prance, perhaps; but it wouldn't eat oats,\" replied the  boy, laughing at the idea.\" And of course it can't ever be alive, because it  is made of wood.\"    \"So am I,\" answered the man.    Tip looked at him in surprise.    \"Why, so you are!\" he exclaimed. \"And the magic powder that brought you to  life is here in my pocket.\"        43               Full page line-art drawing.                   THE MAGICAL POWDER OF LIFE        44    He brought out the pepper box, and eyed it curiously.    \"I wonder,\" said he, musingly, \"if it would bring the saw-horse to life.\"    \"If it would,\" returned Jack, calmly for nothing seemed to surprise him\" I  could ride on its back, and that would save my joints from wearing out.\"    \"I'll try it!\" cried the boy, jumping up. \"But I wonder if I can remember  the words old Mombi said, and the way she held her hands up.\"    He thought it over for a minute, and as he had watched carefully from the  hedge every motion of the old witch, and listened to her words, he believed  he could repeat exactly what she had said and done.    So he began by sprinkling some of the magic Powder of Life from the pepper-  box upon the body of the saw-horse. Then he lifted his left hand, with the  little finger pointing upward, and said: \"Weaugh!\"    \"What does that mean, dear father?\" asked Jack, curiously.    \"I don't know,\" answered Tip. Then he lifted his right hand, with the thumb  pointing upward and said: \"Teaugh!\"    \"What's that, dear father?\" inquired Jack.        45    \"It means you must keep quiet!\" replied the boy, provoked at being  interrupted at so important a moment.    \"How fast I am learning!\" remarked the Pumpkinhead, with his eternal smile.    Tip now lifted both hands above his head, with all the fingers and thumbs  spread out, and cried in a loud voice: \"Peaugh!\"    Immediately the saw-horse moved, stretched its legs, yawned with its  chopped-out mouth, and shook a few grains of the powder off its back. The  rest of the powder seemed to have vanished into the body of the horse.    \"Good!\" called Jack, while the boy looked on in astonishment. \"You are a  very clever sorcerer, dear father!\"                   Line-Art Drawing        46               Full page line-art drawing.        47               The Awakening of the Saw-horse      The Saw-Horse, finding himself alive, seemed even more astonished than Tip.  He rolled his knotty eyes from side to side, taking a first wondering view  of the world in which he had now so important an existence. Then he tried to  look at himself; but he had, indeed, no neck to turn; so that in the  endeavor to see his body he kept circling around and around, without  catching even a glimpse of it. His legs were stiff and awkward, for there  were no knee-joints in them; so that presently he bumped against Jack  Pumpkinhead and sent that personage tumbling upon the moss that lined the  roadside.        48    Tip became alarmed at this accident, as well as at the persistence of the  Saw-Horse in prancing around in a circle; so he called out:    \"Whoa! Whoa, there!\"    The Saw-Horse paid no attention whatever to this command, and the next  instant brought one of his wooden legs down upon Tip's foot so forcibly that  the boy danced away in pain to a safer distance, from where he again yelled:    \"Whoa! Whoa, I say!\"    Jack had now managed to raise himself to a sitting position, and he looked  at the Saw-Horse with much interest.    \"I don't believe the animal can hear you,\" he remarked.    \"I shout loud enough, don't I?\" answered Tip, angrily.    \"Yes; but the horse has no ears,\" said the smiling Pumpkinhead.    \"Sure enough!\" exclaimed Tip, noting the fact for the first time. \"How,  then, am I going to stop him?\"    But at that instant the Saw-Horse stopped himself, having concluded it was  impossible to see his own body. He saw Tip, however, and came close to the  boy to observe him more fully.        49    It was really comical to see the creature walk; for it moved the legs on its  right side together, and those on its left side together, as a pacing horse  does; and that made its body rock sidewise, like a cradle.    Tip patted it upon the head, and said \"Good boy! Good Boy!\" in a coaxing  tone; and the Saw-Horse pranced away to examine with its bulging eyes the  form of Jack Pumpkinhead.    \"I must find a halter for him,\" said Tip; and having made a search in his  pocket he produced a roll of strong cord. Unwinding this, he approached the  Saw-Horse and tied the cord around its neck, afterward fastening the other  end to a large tree. The Saw-Horse, not understanding the action, stepped  backward and snapped the string "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5402"],[0,"1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (#4)"],[1,"body or society; an allusion to the    fore horse or leader of a team, whose harness is commonly    ornamented with a bell or bells.
