[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8190"],[0,"A Wodehouse Miscellany: Articles & Stories (#4)"],[1,"you see of us, the better  we look.          A PLEA FOR INDOOR GOLF      Indoor golf is that which is played in the home. Whether you live in a  palace or a hovel, an indoor golf-course, be it only of nine holes, is  well within your reach. A house offers greater facilities than an  apartment, and I have found my game greatly improved since I went to  live in the country. I can, perhaps, scarcely do better than give a  brief description of the sporting nine-hole course which I have  recently laid out in my present residence.    All authorities agree that the first hole on every links should be  moderately easy, in order to give the nervous player a temporary and  fictitious confidence.    At Wodehouse Manor, therefore, we drive off from the front door--in  order to get the benefit of the door-mat--down an entry fairway,  carpeted with rugs and without traps. The hole--a loving-cup--is just  under the stairs; and a good player ought to have no difficulty in  doing it in two.    The second hole, a short and simple one, takes you into the telephone  booth. Trouble begins with the third, a long dog-leg hole through the  kitchen into the dining-room. This hole is well trapped with  table-legs, kitchen utensils, and a moving hazard in the person of  Clarence the cat, who is generally wandering about the fairway. The  hole is under the glass-and-china cupboard, where you are liable to be  bunkered if you loft your approach-shot excessively.    The fourth and fifth holes call for no comment. They are without  traps, the only danger being that you may lose a stroke through  hitting the maid if she happens to be coming down the back stairs  while you are taking a mashie-shot. This is a penalty under the local  rule.    The sixth is the indispensable water-hole. It is short, but tricky.  Teeing off from just outside the bathroom door, you have to loft the  ball over the side of the bath, holing out in the little vent pipe, at  the end where the water runs out.    The seventh is the longest hole on the course. Starting at the  entrance of the best bedroom, a full drive takes you to the head of  the stairs, whence you will need at least two more strokes to put you  dead on the pin in the drawing-room. In the drawing-room the fairway  is trapped with photograph frames--with glass, complete--these serving  as casual water: and anyone who can hole out on the piano in five or  under is a player of class. Bogey is six, and I have known even such a  capable exponent of the game as my Uncle Reginald, who is plus two on  his home links on Park Avenue, to take twenty-seven at the hole. But  on that occasion he had the misfortune to be bunkered in a photograph  of my Aunt Clara and took no fewer than eleven strokes with his  niblick to extricate himself from it.    The eighth and ninth holes are straightforward, and can be done in two  and three respectively, provided you swing easily and avoid the  canary's cage. Once trapped there, it is better to give up the hole  without further effort. It is almost impossible to get out in less  than fifty-six, and after you have taken about thirty the bird gets  visibly annoyed.          THE ALARMING SPREAD OF POETRY      To the thinking man there are few things more disturbing than the  realization that we are becoming a nation of minor poets. In the good  old days poets were for the most part confined to garrets, which they  left only for the purpose of being ejected from the offices of  magazines and papers to which they attempted to sell their wares.  Nobody ever thought of reading a book of poems unless accompanied by a  guarantee from the publisher that the author had been dead at least a  hundred years. Poetry, like wine, certain brands of cheese, and public  buildings, was rightly considered to improve with age; and no  connoisseur could have dreamed of filling himself with raw,  indigestible verse, warm from the maker.    Today, however, editors are paying real money for poetry; publishers  are making a profit on books of verse; and many a young man who, had  he been born earlier, would have sustained life on a crust of bread,  is now sending for the manager to find out how the restaurant dares  try to sell a fellow champagne like this as genuine Pommery Brut.  Naturally this is having a marked effect on the life of the community.  Our children grow to adolescence with the feeling that they can become  poets instead of working. Many an embryo bill clerk has been ruined by  the heady knowledge that poems are paid for at the rate of a dollar a  line. All over the country promising young plasterers and rising young  motormen are throwing up steady jobs in order to devote themselves to  the new profession. On a sunny afternoon down in Washington Square  one's progress is positively impeded by the swarms of young poets  brought out by the warm weather. It is a horrible sight to see those  unfortunate youths, who ought to be sitting happily at desks writing  \"Dear Sir, Your favor of the tenth inst. duly received and contents  noted. In reply we beg to state....\" wandering about with their  fingers in their hair and their features distorted with the agony of  composition, as they try to find rhymes to \"cosmic\" and \"symbolism.\"    And, as if matters were not bad enough already, along comes Mr. Edgar  Lee Masters and invents _vers libre_. It is too early yet to  judge the full effects of this man's horrid discovery, but there is no  doubt that he has taken the lid off and unleashed forces over which  none can have any control. All those decent restrictions which used to  check poets have vanished, and who shall say what will be the outcome?    Until Mr. Masters came on the scene there was just one thing which,  like a salient fortress in the midst of an enemy's advancing army,  acted as a barrier to the youth of the country. When one's son came to  one and said, \"Father, I shall not be able to fulfill your dearest  wish and start work in the fertilizer department. I have decided to  become a poet,\" although one could no longer frighten him from his  purpose by talking of garrets and starvation, there was still one  weapon left. \"What about the rhymes, Willie?\" you replied, and the  eager light died out of the boy's face, as he perceived the catch in  what he had taken for a good thing. You pressed your advantage. \"Think  of having to spend your life making one line rhyme with another! Think  of the bleak future, when you have used up 'moon' and 'June,' 'love'  and 'dove,' 'May' and 'gay'! Think of the moment when you have ended  the last line but one of your poem with 'windows' or 'warmth' and have  to buckle to, trying to make the thing couple up in accordance with  the rules! What then, Willie?\"    Next day a new hand had signed on in the fertilizer department.    But now all that has changed. Not only are rhymes no longer necessary,  but editors positively prefer them left out. If Longfellow had been  writing today he would have had to revise \"The Village Blacksmith\" if  he wanted to pull in that dollar a line. No editor would print stuff  like:        Under the spreading chestnut tree        The village smithy stands.      The smith a brawny man is he        With large and sinewy hands.    If Longfellow were living in these hyphenated, free and versy days, he  would find himself compelled to take his pen in hand and dictate as  follows:        In life I was the village smith,      I worked all day      But      I retained the delicacy of my complexion      Because      I worked in the shade of the chestnut tree      Instead of in the sun      Like Nicholas Blodgett, the expressman.      I was large and strong      Because      I went in for physical culture      And deep breathing      And all those stunts.      I had the biggest biceps in Spoon River.    Who can say where this thing will end? _Vers libre_ is within the  reach of all. A sleeping nation has wakened to the realization that  there is money to be made out of chopping its prose into bits.  Something must be done shortly if the nation is to be saved from this  menace. But what? It is no good shooting Edgar Lee Masters, for the  mischief has been done, and even making an example of him could not  undo it. Probably the only hope lies in the fact that poets never buy  other poets' stuff. When once we have all become poets, the sale of  verse will cease or be limited to the few copies which individual  poets will buy to give to their friends.          MY LIFE AS A DRAMATIC CRITIC      I had always wanted to be a dramatic critic. A taste for sitting back  and watching other people work, so essential to the make-up of this  sub-species of humanity, has always been one of the leading traits in  my character.    I have seldom missed a first night. No sooner has one periodical got  rid of me than another has had the misfortune to engage me, with the  result that I am now the foremost critic of the day, read assiduously  by millions, fawned upon by managers, courted by stagehands. My  lightest word can make or mar a new production. If I say a piece is  bad, it dies. It may not die instantly. Generally it takes forty weeks  in New York and a couple of seasons on the road to do it, but it  cannot escape its fate. Sooner or later it perishes. That is the sort  of man I am.    Whatever else may be charged against me, I have never deviated from  the standard which I set myself at the beginning of my career. If I am  called upon to review a play produced by a manager who is considering  one of my own works, I do not hesitate. I praise that play.    If an actor has given me a lunch, I refuse to bite the hand that has  fed me. I praise that actor's performance. I can only recall one  instance of my departing from my principles. That was when the  champagne was corked, and the man refused to buy me another bottle.    As is only natural, I have met many interesting people since I  embarked on my career. I remember once lunching with rare Ben"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8220"],[0,"Remarks (#4)"],[1,"bob-tail car, yelling \"Eureka!\" The  car-driver told him that Eureka wasn't on the car, and referred Archimedes  to a clothing store.    Everywhere he was greeted with surprise. He tried to pay his car-fare, but  found that he had left his money in his other clothes.    Some thought it was the revised statute of Hercules; that he had become  weary of standing on his pedestal during the hot weather, and had started  out for fresh air. I give this as I remember it. The story is foundered on  fact.    Archimedes once said: \"Give me where I may stand, and I will move the  world.\" I could write it in the original Greek, but, fearing that the  nonpareil delirium tremens type might get short, I give it in the English  language.    It may be tardy justice to a great mathematician and scientist, but I have  a few resolutions of respect which I would be very glad to get printed on  this solemn occasion, and mail copies of the paper to his relatives and  friends:    \"WHEREAS, It has pleased an All-wise Providence to remove from our midst  Archimedes, who was ever at the front in all deserving labors and  enterprises; and    \"WHEREAS, We can but feebly express our great sorrow in the loss of  Archimedes, whose front name has escaped our memory; therefore    \"_Resolved_, That in his death we have lost a leading citizen of Syracuse,  and one who never shook his friends--never weakened or gigged back on  those he loved.    \"_Resolved_, That copies of these resolutions will be spread on the  moments of the meeting of the Common Council of Syracuse, and that they be  published in the Syracuse papers eodtfpdq&cod, and that marked copies of  said papers be mailed to the relatives of the deceased.\"          To the President-Elect.    Dear Sir.--The painful duty of turning over to you the administration of  these United States and the key to the front door of the White House has  been assigned to me. You will find the key hanging inside the storm-door,  and the cistern-pole up stairs in the haymow of the barn. I have made a  great many suggestions to the outgoing administration relative to the  transfer of the Indian bureau from the department of the Interior to that  of the sweet by-and-by. The Indian, I may say, has been a great source of  annoyance to me, several of their number having jumped one of my most  valuable mining claims on White river. Still, I do not complain of that.  This mine, however, I am convinced would be a good paying property if  properly worked, and should you at any time wish to take the regular army  and such other help as you may need and re-capture it from our red  brothers, I would be glad to give you a controlling interest in it.    [Illustration: A DEARTH OF SOAP IN THE LAUNDRY AND BATH-ROOM.]    You will find all papers in their appropriate pigeon-holes, and a small  jar of cucumber pickles down cellar, which were left over and to which you  will be perfectly welcome. The asperities and heart burnings that were the  immediate result of a hot and unusually bitter campaign are now all  buried. Take these pickles and use them as though they were your own. They  are none too good for you. You deserve them. We may differ politically,  but that need not interfere with our warm personal friendship.    You will observe on taking possession of the administration, that the navy  is a little bit weather-beaten and wormy. I would suggest that it be newly  painted in the spring. If it had been my good fortune to receive a  majority of the suffrages of the people for the office which you now hold,  I should have painted the navy red. Still, that need not influence you in  the course which you may see fit to adopt.    There are many affairs of great moment which I have not enumerated in this  brief letter, because I felt some little delicacy and timidity about  appearing to be at all dictatorial or officious about a matter wherein the  public might charge me with interference.    I hope you will receive the foregoing in a friendly spirit, and whatever  your convictions may be upon great questions of national interest, either  foreign or domestic, that you will not undertake to blow out the gas on  retiring, and that you will in other ways realize the fond anticipations  which are now cherished in your behalf by a mighty people whose aggregated  eye is now on to you.    Bill Nye.    P.S.--You will be a little surprised, no doubt, to find no soap in the  laundry or bath-rooms. It probably got into the campaign in some way and  was absorbed.    B.N.          Anatomy.    The word anatomy is derived from two Greek spatters and three polywogs,  which, when translated, signify \"up through\" and \"to cut,\" so that anatomy  actually, when translated from the original wappy-jawed Greek, means to  cut up through. That is no doubt the reason why the medical student  proceeds to cut up through the entire course.    [Illustration: STUDYING ANATOMY.]    Anatomy is so called because its best results are obtained from the  cutting or dissecting of organism. For that reason there is a growing  demand in the neighborhood of the medical college for good second-hand  organisms. Parties having well preserved organisms that they are not  actually using, will do well to call at the side door of the medical  college after 10 P.M.    The branch of the comparative anatomy which seeks to trace the unities of  plan which are exhibited in diverse organisms, and which discovers, as far  as may be, the principles which govern the growth and development of  organized bodies, and which finds functional analogies and structural  homologies, is denominated philosophical or transcendental anatomy. (This  statement, though strictly true, is not original with me.)    Careful study of the human organism after death, shows traces of  functional analogies and structural homologies in people who were supposed  to have been in perfect health all their lives Probably many of those we  meet in the daily walks of life, many, too, who wear a smile and outwardly  seem happy, have either one or both of these things. A man may live a  false life and deceive his most intimate friends in the matter of  anatomical analogies or homologies, but he cannot conceal it from the  eagle eye of the medical student. The ambitious medical student makes a  specialty of true inwardness.    The study of the structure of animals is called zootomy. The attempt to  study the anatomical structure of the grizzly bear from the inside has not  been crowned with success. When the anatomizer and the bear have been  thrown together casually, it has generally been a struggle between the two  organisms to see which would make a study of the structure of the other.  Zootomy and moral suasion are not homogeneous, analogous, nor indigenous.    Vegetable anatomy is called phytonomy, sometimes. But it would not be safe  to address a vigorous man by that epithet. We may call a vegetable that,  however, and be safe.    Human anatomy is that branch of anatomy which enters into the description  of the structure and geographical distribution of the elements of a human  being. It also applies to the structure of the microbe that crawls out of  jail every four years just long enough to whip his wife, vote and go back  again.    Human anatomy is either general, specific, topographical or surgical.  Those terms do not imply the dissection and anatomy of generals,  specialists, topographers and surgeons, as they might seem to imply, but  really mean something else. I would explain here what they actually do  mean if I had more room and knew enough to do it.    Anatomists divide their science, as well as their subjects, into  fragments. Osteology treats of the skeleton, myology of the muscles,  angiology of the blood vessels, splanchology the digestive organs or  department of the interior, and so on.    People tell pretty tough stories of the young carvists who study anatomy  on subjects taken from life. I would repeat a few of them here, but they  are productive of insomnia, so I will not give them.    I visited a matinee of this kind once for a short time, but I have not  been there since. When I have a holiday now, the idea of spending it in  the dissecting-room of a large and flourishing medical college does not  occur to me.    I never could be a successful surgeon, I fear. While I have no hesitation  about mutilating the English, I have scruples about cutting up other  nationalities. I should always fear, while pursuing my studies, that I  might be called upon to dissect a friend, and I could not do that. I  should like to do anything that would advance the cause of science, but I  should not want to form the habit of dissecting people, lest some day I  might be called upon to dissect a friend for whom I had a great  attachment, or some creditor who had an attachment for me.    [Illustration]          Mr. Sweeney's Cat.    Robert Ormsby Sweeney is a druggist of St. Paul, and though a recent  chronological record reveals the fact that he is a direct descendant of a  sure-enough king, and though there is mighty good purple, royal blood in  his veins that dates back where kings used to have something to do to earn  their salary, he goes right on with his regular business, selling drugs at  the great sacrifice which druggists will make sometimes in order to place  their goods within the reach of all.    As soon as I learned that Mr. Sweeney had barely escaped being a crowned  head, I got acquainted with him and tried to cheer him up, and I told him  that people wouldn't hold him in any way responsible, and that as it  hadn't shown itself in his family for years he might perhaps finally wear  it out.    He is a mighty pleasant man to meet, anyhow, and you can have just as much  fun with him as you could with a man who didn't have any royal blood in  his veins. You could be with him for days on a fishing trip and never  notice it at all.    But I was going to speak more in particular about Mr. Sweeney'"]]]
