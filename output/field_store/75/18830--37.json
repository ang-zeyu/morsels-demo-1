My  father----\"    \"Your father, I dare say, got something to eat when he was hungry!\"  interrupted the Prince.    \"Oh! certainly,\" answered the Fairy, \"and you also shall have supper  directly. I only just wanted to tell you----\"    \"But I really cannot listen to anything until I have had something  to eat,\" cried the Prince, who was getting quite angry; but then,  remembering that he had better be polite as he much needed the Fairy's  help, he added:    \"I know that in the pleasure of listening to you I should quite forget  my own hunger; but my horse, who cannot hear you, must really be fed!\"    The Fairy was very much flattered by this compliment, and said, calling  to her servants:    \"You shall not wait another minute, you are so polite, and in spite of  the enormous size of your nose you are really very agreeable.\"    \"Plague take the old lady! How she does go on about my nose!\" said the  Prince to himself. \"One would almost think that mine had taken all the  extra length that hers lacks! If I were not so hungry I would soon have  done with this chatterpie who thinks she talks very little! How stupid  people are not to see their own faults! That comes of being a princess:  she has been spoiled by flatterers, who have made her believe that she  is quite a moderate talker!\"    Meanwhile the servants were putting the supper on the table, and the  prince was much amused to hear the Fairy who asked them a thousand  questions simply for the pleasure of hearing herself speak; especially  he noticed one maid who, no matter what was being said, always contrived  to praise her mistress's wisdom.    \"Well!\" he thought, as he ate his supper, \"I'm very glad I came here.  This just shows me how sensible I have been in never listening to  flatterers. People of that sort praise us to our faces without shame,  and hide our faults or change them into virtues. For my part I never  will be taken in by them. I know my own defects, I hope.\"    Poor Prince Hyacinth! He really believed what he said, and hadn't an  idea that the people who had praised his nose were laughing at him, just  as the Fairy's maid was laughing at her; for the Prince had seen her  laugh slyly when she could do so without the Fairy's noticing her.    However, he said nothing, and presently, when his hunger began to be  appeased, the Fairy said:    \"My dear Prince, might I beg you to move a little more that way, for  your nose casts such a shadow that I really cannot see what I have on my  plate. Ah! thanks. Now let us speak of your father. When I went to his  Court he was only a little boy, but that is forty years ago, and I have  been in this desolate place ever since. Tell me what goes on nowadays;  are the ladies as fond of amusement as ever? In my time one saw them at  parties, theatres, balls, and promenades every day. Dear me! _what_ a  long nose you have! I cannot get used to it!\"    \"Really, madam,\" said the Prince, \"I wish you would leave off mentioning  my nose. It cannot matter to you what it is like. I am quite satisfied  with it, and have no wish to have it shorter. One must take what is  given one.\"    \"Now you are angry with me, my poor Hyacinth,\" said the Fairy, \"and I  assure you that I didn't mean to vex you; on the contrary, I wished to  do you a service. However, though I really cannot help your nose being a  shock to me, I will try not to say anything about it. I will even try to  think that you have an ordinary nose. To tell the truth, it would make  three reasonable ones.\"    The Prince, who was no longer hungry, grew so impatient at the Fairy's  continual remarks about his nose that at last he threw himself upon his  horse and rode hastily away. But wherever he came in his journeyings he  thought the people were mad, for they all talked of his nose, and yet  he could not bring himself to admit that it was too long, he had been so  used all his life to hear it called handsome.    The old Fairy, who wished to make him happy, at last hit upon a plan.  She shut the Dear Little Princess up in a palace of crystal, and put  this palace down where the Prince would not fail to find it. His joy at  seeing the Princess again was extreme, and he set to work with all his  might to try to break her prison; but in spite of all his efforts he  failed utterly. In despair he thought at least that he would try to  get near enough to speak to the Dear Little Princess, who, on her part,  stretched out her hand that he might kiss it; but turn which way he  might, he never could raise it to his lips, for his long nose always  prevented it. For the first time he realized how long it really was, and  exclaimed:    \"Well, it must be admitted that my nose _is_ too long!\"    In an instant the crystal prison flew into a thousand splinters, and  the old Fairy, taking the Dear Little Princess by the hand, said to the  Prince:    \"Now, say if you are not very much obliged to me. Much good it was for  me to talk to you about your nose! You would never have found out how  extraordinary it was if it hadn't hindered you from doing what you  wanted to. You see how self-love keeps us from knowing our own defects  of mind and body. Our reason tries in vain to show them to us; we refuse  to see them till we find them in the way of our interests.\"    Prince Hyacinth, whose nose was now just like anyone's else, did not  fail to profit by the lesson he had received. He married the Dear Little  Princess, and they lived happily ever after.(1)      (1) Le Prince Desir et la Princesse Mignonne. Par Madame Leprince de  Beaumont.          EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON      Once upon a time there was a poor husbandman who had many children and  little to give them in the way either of food or clothing. They were all  pretty, but the prettiest of all was the youngest daughter, who was so  beautiful that there were no bounds to her beauty.    So once--it was late on a Thursday evening in autumn, and wild weather  outside, terribly dark, and raining so heavily and blowing so hard that  the walls of the cottage shook again--they were all sitting together by  the fireside, each of them busy with something or other, when suddenly  some one rapped three times against the window-pane. The man went out  to see what could be the matter, and when he got out there stood a great  big white bear.    \"Good-evening to you,\" said the White Bear.    \"Good-evening,\" said the man.    \"Will you give me your youngest daughter?\" said the White Bear; \"if you  will, you shall be as rich as you are now poor.\"    Truly the man would have had no objection to be rich, but he thought to  himself: \"I must first ask my daughter about this,\" so he went in and  told them that there was a great white bear outside who had faithfully  promised to make them all rich if he might but have the youngest  daughter.    She said no, and would not hear of it; so the man went out again, and  settled with the White Bear that he should come again next Thursday  evening, and get her answer. Then the man persuaded her, and talked so  much to her about the wealth that they would have, and what a good thing  it would be for herself, that at last she made up her mind to go, and  washed and mended all her rags, made herself as smart as she could, and  held herself in readiness to set out. Little enough had she to take away  with her.    Next Thursday evening the White Bear came to fetch her. She seated  herself on his back with her bundle, and thus they departed. When they  had gone a great part of the way, the White Bear said: \"Are you afraid?\"    \"No, that I am not,\" said she.    \"Keep tight hold of my fur, and then there is no danger,\" said he.    And thus she rode far, far away, until they came to a great mountain.  Then the White Bear knocked on it, and a door opened, and they went into  a castle where there were many brilliantly lighted rooms which shone  with gold and silver, likewise a large hall in which there was a  well-spread table, and it was so magnificent that it would be hard to  make anyone understand how splendid it was. The White Bear gave her a  silver bell, and told her that when she needed anything she had but  to ring this bell, and what she wanted would appear. So after she had  eaten, and night was drawing near, she grew sleepy after her journey,  and thought she would like to go to bed. She rang the bell, and scarcely  had she touched it before she found herself in a chamber where a bed  stood ready made for her, which was as pretty as anyone could wish to  sleep in. It had pillows of silk, and curtains of silk fringed with  gold, and everything that was in the room was of gold or silver, but  when she had lain down and put out the light a man came and lay down  beside her, and behold it was the White Bear, who cast off the form of  a beast during the night. She never saw him, however, for he always came  after she had put out her light, and went away before daylight appeared.    So all went well and happily for a time, but then she began to be very  sad and sorrowful, for all day long she had to go about alone; and  she did so wish to go home to her father and mother and brothers and  sisters. Then the White Bear asked what it was that she wanted, and she  told him that it was so dull there in the mountain, and that she had to  go about all alone, and that in her parents' house at home there were  all her brothers and sisters, and it was because she could not go to  them that she was so sorrowful.    \"There might be a cure for that,\" said the White Bear, \"if you would  but promise me never to talk with your mother alone, but only when the  others are there too; for she will take hold of your hand,\" he said,  \"and will want to lead you into a room to talk with you alone; but that  you must by no means do, or you will bring great misery on both of us.\"    So one Sunday the White Bear came and said that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50302"],[0,"The Rise and Fall of Nauvoo (#4)"],[1,"ch, 1839.        DEAR SIR--On my return to this city, after a few weeks' absence in      the interior of the Territory, I received your letter of the 25th      ultimo, in which you give a short account of the sufferings of the      _people called Mormons_, and ask \"whether they could be permitted      to purchase lands, and settle upon them, in the Territory of Iowa,      and there worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their      own consciences, secure from oppression,\" etc.        In answer to your inquiry, I would say, that I know of no authority      that can constitutionally deprive them of this right. They are      citizens of the United States, and are entitled to all the rights      and privileges of other citizens. The 2nd section of the 4th      Article of the Constitution of the United States (which all are      solemnly bound to support), declares that the \"citizens of each      State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of      citizens of the several States.\" This privilege extends in full      force to the Territories of the United States. The first Amendment      to the Constitution of the United States declares that \"Congress      shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or      prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"        The Ordinance of Congress of the 13th July, 1787, for the      government of the Territory northwest of the river Ohio, secures      to the citizens of said Territory, and the citizens of the States      thereafter to be formed therein, certain privileges which were, by      the late Act of Congress organizing the Territory of Iowa, extended      to the citizens of this Territory.        The first fundamental Article in that Ordinance, which is declared      to be forever unalterable, except by common consent, reads as      follows, to-wit: \"No person demeaning himself in a peaceable and      orderly manner, shall ever be molested on account of his mode of      worship, or religious sentiments in said Territory.\"        These principles, I trust, will ever be adhered to in the Territory      of Iowa. They make no distinction between religious sects. They      extend equal privileges and protection to all; each must rest upon      its own merits, and will prosper in proportion to the purity of its      principles, and the fruit of holiness and piety produced thereby.        With regard to the peculiar people mentioned in your letter, I know      but little. They had a community in the northern part of Ohio for      several years; and I have no recollection of ever having heard in      that State of any complaints against them from violating the laws      of the country. Their religious opinions, I consider, has nothing      to do with our political transactions. They are citizens of the      United States, and are entitled to the same political rights and      legal protection that other citizens are entitled to.        The foregoing are briefly my views on the subject of your inquiries.                   With sincere respect,                        I am your obedient servant,                                            ROBERT LUCAS.        To ISAAC GALLAND, Esq., Commerce, Illinois.    This communication Dr. Galland sent to the Quincy _Argus_, accompanied  by the following note:                                                      COMMERCE, ILLINOIS,                                                        April 12, 1839.        MESSRS. EDITORS:--Enclosed I send you a communication from Governor      Lucas of Iowa Territory. If you think the publication thereof      will in any way promote the cause of justice, by vindicating      the slandered reputation of the people called Mormons, from the      ridiculous falsehoods which the malice, cupidity and envy of      their murderers in Missouri have endeavored to heap upon them,      you are respectfully solicited to publish it in the _Argus_. The      testimony of Governor Lucas as to the good moral character of      these people, I think will have its deserved influence upon the      people of Illinois, in encouraging our citizens in their humane and      benevolent exertions to relieve this distressed people, who are now      wandering in our neighborhoods without comfortable food, raiment,      or a shelter from the pelting storm.                 I am, gentlemen, very respectfully,                      Your obedient servant,                               ISAAC GALLAND.    In conversation with Dr. Galland, Isaac Van Allen, Esq.,  attorney-general for the same Territory (Iowa), gave him to understand  that he would, so far as within his power, protect the Mormon people  from insult and injury. It was these assurances of sympathy and  protection which led to a reconsideration of the conclusion of the  former conference, and the appointment of a committee to examine the  lands offered. But little or nothing was ever done by this committee.    On the twenty-second of April, 1839, the Prophet Joseph joined the  exiled Saints at Quincy. After a cruel imprisonment of over five  months, he had escaped from his persecutors while en route from Liberty  prison, Clay County, to Columbia, Boone County, to which he and his  companions in prison had taken a change of venue for trial. The guards  got drunk and were evidently willing for their prisoners to escape.  At any rate, the Prophet, in stating the circumstance in his history,  says: \"We thought it a favorable opportunity to make our escape;  knowing that the only object of our enemies was our destruction; and  likewise knowing that a number of our brethren had been massacred by  them on Shoal Creek, amongst whom were two children; and they had  sought every opportunity to abuse others who were left in the State;  and that they were never brought to an account for their barbarous  proceedings, but were winked at and encouraged by those in authority.  We thought that it was necessary for us, inasmuch as we loved our  lives, and did not wish to die by the hand of murderers and assassins;  and inasmuch as we loved our families and friends, to deliver ourselves  from our enemies.\" And so the Prophet and his companions escaped and  arrived in Quincy as already stated.    I need not stop to undertake a description of the scenes of this  exiled people welcoming their youthful Prophet into their midst, after  such trials as they had passed through, in which the strength of each  man's soul and love for his brethren had been tested. The Saints had  seen their Prophet and his fellow prisoners betrayed into the hands  of a merciless enemy, and knew that a court-martial of the Missouri  State militia had condemned him and his companions to be shot in the  public square at Far West. They had seen him and his fellow-prisoners  torn away from their parents and families, and their people, under  circumstances the most distressing. They had been told by the haughty  commander-in-chief of the mob militia forces which invested Far  West--General Clark--that the doom of their leaders was sealed, and  they need not expect, nor even let it enter into their hearts that they  would be permitted to see them again. Many of them had seen him chained  like a felon, standing before unjust judges, whose hearts were filled  to overflowing with hatred towards him. Contrary to every principle  of justice, he had been sent to languish in prison in the midst of  his enemies; while they themselves, with bursting hearts and blinding  tears, were compelled to sign away their lands and homes at the muzzle  of the musket and flee from the Christian State of Missouri, under the  exterminating order issued by Governor Boggs. Yet in all these trials,  from the dangers of the murderous militia camps, from the malice of  corrupt courts, and the injustice of drunken juries, and at last from  the prison's gloom, a kind Providence had delivered him, and he was  again in their midst, again with them to still their fears and direct  their movements.    His presence was the signal for action. He arrived in Quincy on the  22nd of April. The day following he spent in greeting his friends, and  receiving visits from the brethren; but on the twenty-fourth he called  and presided over a conference, at which, in connection with Bishop  Knight and Alanson Ripley, he was appointed to go to Iowa to select  a place for the gathering of the exiled Saints. The conference also  advised the brethren, who could do so, to go to Commerce and locate in  Dr. Galland's neighborhood.    On the first of May the committee purchased a farm of one hundred  and thirty-five acres, for which they agreed to pay five thousand  dollars; also another and a larger farm of Dr. Galland for nine  thousand dollars. The committee desired that these farms should be  deeded to Alanson Ripley, but Sidney Rigdon, manifesting a rather  sour disposition, said that no committee should control any property  that he had anything to do with. So the purchase made of Dr. Galland  was deeded to Sidney Rigdon's son-in-law, G. W. Robinson, with the  understanding that he should deed it to The Church as soon as it was  paid for according to the contract. This was the first purchase of  lands made in Commerce. The place is thus described by Joseph: \"When  I made the purchase of White and Galland, there was one stone house,  three frame houses, and two blockhouses, which constituted the whole  city of Commerce.\"    This small collection of houses was immediately on the banks of the  river, and scattered between them and what afterwards became the south  part of the city of Nauvoo, were one stone and three log houses. It  was one of these humble dwellings that Joseph moved into on the tenth  of May, 1839. Back some distance from the river, however, were other  dwellings scattered over the country, one of which was the home of  Daniel H. Wells, a justice of the peace for the district of Commerce,  and who afterwards became a prominent Church"]]]
