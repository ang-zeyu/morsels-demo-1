Remember that all which you can put aside as not  yourself is the body of the yogi, and hence, as you go higher,  the lower bodies form but a single body and the consciousness in  that sheath of matter which it still cannot throw away, that  becomes the man.    \"Yoga is Samadhi.\" It is the power to withdraw from all that you  know as body, and to concentrate yourself within. That is  Samadhi. No ordinary means will then call you back to the world  that you have left.[FN#4: An Indian yogi in Samadhi, discovered  in a forest by some ignorant and brutal Englishmen, was so  violently ill used that he returned to his tortured body, only to  leave it again at once by death.] This will also explain to you  the phrase in The Secret Doctrine that the Adept \" begins his  Samadhi on the atmic plane \" When a Jivan-mukta enters into  Samadhi, he begins it on the atmic plane. All planes below the  atmic are one plane for him. He begins his Samadhi on a plane to  which the mere man cannot rise. He begins it on the atmic plane,  and thence rises stage by stage to the higher cosmic planes. The  same word, samadhi, is used to describe the states of the  consciousness, whether it rises above the physical into the  astral, as in self-induced trance of an ordinary man, or as in  the case of a Jivan-mukta when, the consciousness being already  centred in the fifth, or atmic plane, it rises to the higher  planes of a larger world.          The Literature of  Yoga        Unfortunately for non-Sanskrit-knowing people, the literature of  Yoga is not largely available in English. The general teachings  of Yoga are to be found in the Upanishads, and the Bhagavad-Gita;  those, in many translations, are within your reach, but they are  general, not special; they give you the main principles, but do  not tell you about the methods in any detailed way. Even in the  Bhagavad-Gita, while you are told to make sacrifices, to become  indifferent, and so on, it is all of the nature of moral precept,  absolutely necessary indeed, but still not telling you how to  reach the conditions put before you. The special literature of  Yoga is, first of all, many of the minor Upanishads, \"the  hundred-and-eight\" as they are called. Then comes the enormous  mass of literature called the Tantras. These books have an evil  significance in the ordinary English ear, but not quite rightly.  The Tantras are very useful books, very valuable and instructive;  all occult science is to be found in them. But they are divisible  into three classes: those that deal with white magic, those that  deal with black magic, and those that deal with what we may call  grey magic, a mixture of the two. Now magic is the word which  covers the methods of deliberately bringing about super-normal  physical states by the action of the will.    A high tension of the nerves, brought on by anxiety or disease,  leads to ordinary hysteria, emotional and foolish. A similarly  high tension, brought about by the will, renders a man sensitive  to super-physical vibrations Going to sleep has no significance,  but going into Samadhi is a priceless power. The process is  largely the same, but one is due to ordinary conditions, the  other to the action of the trained will. The Yogi is the man who  has learned the power of the will, and knows how to use it to  bring about foreseen and foredetermined results. This knowledge  has ever been called magic; it is the name of the Great Science  of the past, the one Science, to which only the word \" great \"  was given in the past. The Tantras contain the whole of that; the  occult side of man and nature, the means whereby discoveries may  be made, the principles whereby the man may re-create himself,  all these are in the Tantras. The difficulty is that without a  teacher they are very dangerous, and again and again a man trying  to practice the Tantric methods without a teacher makes himself  very ill. So the Tantras have got a bad name both in the West and  here in India. A good many of the American \" occult \" books now  sold are scraps of the Tantras which have been translated. One  difficulty is that these Tantric works often use the name of a  bodily organ to represent an astral or mental centre. There is  some reason in that because all the centres are connected with  each other from body to body; but no reliable teacher would set  his pupil to work on the bodily organs until he had some control  over the higher centres, and had carefully purified the physical  body. Knowing the one helps you to know the other, and the  teacher who has been through it all can place his pupil on the  right path; but it you take up these words, which are all  physical, and do not know to what the physical word is applied,  then you will only become very confused, and may injure yourself.  For instance, in one of the Sutras it is said that if you  meditate on a certain part of the tongue you will obtain astral  sight. That means that if you meditate on the pituitary body,  just over this part of the tongue, astral sight will be opened.  The particular word used to refer to a centre has a  correspondence in the physical body, and the word is often  applied to the physical organs when the other is meant. This is  what is called a \" blind,\" and it is intended to keep the people  away from dangerous practices in the books that are published;  people may meditate on that part of their tongues all their lives  without anything coming of it; but if they think upon the  corresponding centre in the body, a good dealÄmuch harmÄmay come  of it. \" Meditate on the navel,\" it is also said. This means the  solar plexus, for there is a close connection between the two.  But to meditate on that is to incur the danger of a serious  nervous disorder, almost impossible to cure. All who know how  many people in India suffer through these practices,  ill-understood, recognize that it is not wise to plunge into them  without some one to tell you what they mean, and what may be  safely practiced and what not. The other part of the Yoga  literature is a small book called the sutras of Patanjali. That  is available, but I am afraid that few are able to make much of  it by themselves. In the first place, to elucidate the Sutras,  which are simply headings, there is a great deal of commentary in  Sanskrit, only partially translated. And even the commentaries  have this peculiarity, that all the most difficult words are  merely repeated, not explained, so that the student is not much  enlightened.          Some  Definitions        There are a few words, constantly recurring, which need brief  definitions, in order to avoid confusion; they are: Unfolding,  Evolution, Spirituality, Psychism, Yoga and Mysticism.    \"Unfolding\" always refers to consciousness, \"evolution\" to forms.  Evolution is the homogeneous becoming the heterogeneous, the  simple becoming complex. But there is no growth and no  perfectioning for Spirit, for consciousness; it is all there and  always, and all that can happen to it is to turn itself outwards  instead of remaining turned inwards. The God in you cannot  evolve, but He may show forth His powers through matter that He  has appropriated for the purpose, and the matter evolves to serve  Him. He Himself only manifests what He is. And on that, many a  saying of the great mystics may come to your mind: \"Become,\" says  St. Ambrose, \"what you are\"--a paradoxical phrase; but one that  sums up a great truth: become in outer manifestation that which  you are in inner reality. That is the object of the whole process  of Yoga.    \"Spirituality\" is the realisation of the One. \"Psychism\" is the  manifestation of intelligence through any material vehicle.[FN#5:  See London Lectures of 1907, \"Spirituality and Psychism\".]    \"Yoga\" is the seeking of union by the intellect, a science;  \"Mysticism\" is the seeking of the same union by emotion.[FN#6:  The word yoga may, of course, be rightly used of all union with  the self, whatever the road taken. I am using it here in the  narrower sense, as peculiarly connected with the intelligence, as  a Science, herein following Patanjali.]    See the mystic. He fixes his mind on the object of devotion; he  loses self-consciousness, and passes into a rapture of love and  adoration, leaving all external ideas, wrapped in the object of  his love, and a great surge of emotion sweeps him up to God. He  does not know how he has reached that lofty state. He is  conscious only of God and his love for Him. Here is the rapture  of the mystic, the triumph of the saint.    The yogi does not work like that. Step after step, he realises  what he is doing. He works by science and not by emotion, so that  any who do not care for science, finding it dull and dry, are not  at present unfolding that part of their nature which will find  its best help in the practice of Yoga. The yogi may use devotion  as a means. This comes out very plainly in Patanjali. He has  given many means whereby Yoga may be followed, and curiously,  \"devotion to Isvara'' is one of several means. There comes out  the spirit of the scientific thinker. Devotion to Isvara is not  for him an end in itself, but means to an endÄthe concentration  of the mind. You see there at once the difference of spirit.  Devotion to Isvara is the path of the mystic. He attains  communion by that. Devotion to Isvara as a means of concentrating  the mind is the scientific way in which the yogi regards  devotion. No number of words would have brought out the  difference of spirit between Yoga and Mysticism as well as this.  The one looks upon devotion to Isvara as a way of reaching the  Beloved; the other looks upon it as a means of reaching  concentration. To the mystic, God, in Himself is the object of  search, delight in Him is the reason for approaching Him, union  with Him in consciousness is his goal; but to the yogi, fixing  the attention on God is merely an effective way of concentrating  the mind.

How dismal must night have been in the times when only gas lamps  or a few electric lights were used in the streets, although our  great-grandfathers appear to have extracted a good deal of  merriment from the dimly lighted hours after sundown. Our domestic  lighting is now done almost entirely by electricity, or the  brilliant little phosphorescent lamps, gas having long been  banished from dwelling-houses; and our method of lighting the  streets is a grand advance, indeed, upon the flickering yellow  gas lamps of old. The great glass globes, which we see suspended  from the beautiful Gothic metal framework at the intersections of  streets, contain a smaller hollow globe, about eighteen inches in  diameter, of hard lime, or some other refractory material, which  is kept at white heat by a powerful oxyhydrogen flame inside. In  this way our cities are illuminated by a number of miniature suns,  making all the principal streets as light by night as by day.    One of our most interesting cities, and one to adopt all the newest  improvements as soon as they come out, is Churchill, Hudson Bay,  that most charming of northern sea-side resorts. Churchill's  population is already 200,000, and is rapidly increasing. Here are  the celebrated conservatories which help to make the long winter  as pleasant to the citizens as summer. These famous promenades,  or rather parks under cover, have a frontage of a mile and a half  along the quay, with a depth of nearly 500 feet. They contain two  splendid hotels and a sanitarium, the latter being surrounded by  a grove of medicinal and health-giving plants and trees from all  parts of the globe. A summer temperature is kept up through the  vast building by utilising the heat from the depths of the earth,  and by natural hot springs which flow from deep bores. Another  fine city of which we may well be proud is Electropolis, on Lake  Athabaska. Electropolis can boast of 100,000 inhabitants, and  most enterprising citizens they are. Their great idea is to work  everything by electricity, and to them belongs the credit of all  the latest discoveries in electrical science. Their beautiful  city is a great centre of attraction for scientific men, and many  European electricians make a practice of coming over every Saturday  to stay till Monday. Here are the colossal thermo-electric  batteries which work throughout the year by there being stored up  in immense solid blocks of aluminium the heat of summer and the  cold of winter. The hot blocks, which are protected in winter, are  exposed to the sun in summer, and are heated nearly to red heat by  the rays concentrated upon them by a series of large mirrors. The  cold blocks are simply exposed to the intensest cold of winter and  protected from the heat of summer. Thus two permanent extremes of  temperature are provided during the whole year, and the batteries  only require to be placed in suitable positions with regard to the  blocks to work continuously.    While speaking of cities in the far north, that of Bearville, on  the shores of Great Bear Lake, in latitude 65 degrees, must not  be passed over. Bearville is the metropolis of one of the finest  mineral districts in the world, but had it not been for the  inexhaustible deposits of all the useful metals in its vicinity,  it is probable a city would never have sprung up in such an  inhospitable region. Between the Coppermine and Mackenzie Rivers  gold and silver are abundant. Platinum and iridium are also common,  and are exported from here to all parts of the world; they are in  great demand by chemists and electricians. A rough population from  all quarters has been attracted to the district, of which Bearville  is the centre, and it would astonish people who seldom come to  the North to see how the ingenuity of man has made life not only  tolerable, but enjoyable, in the neighborhood of the Arctic Circle.  Coal seams crop up above the ground in many places, and wherever  this is the case, large frame conservatories are built which are  lighted, not from the roof, but by wide double windows reaching  from the eaves to the ground, and heated by numerous stoves into  which the coal just taken from the ground is thrown. Electric  lights, magnesium lights and lime lights help to make the long  nights of winter as cheerful as day elsewhere.    In this region wonderful blasting operations are performed by  charges of solidified oxygen and hydrogen. The charges are placed  at the bottom of a 40 foot bore and exploded by a powerful electric  spark. The effect is very different from that of other explosives  which usually rend the rock into large fragments that have to  be blasted again in detail before a clearance is made, for the  oxyhydrogen charge has such terrible force that it completely  pulverizes the rock, scooping out, even in granite, a deep wide  pit of parabolic section of which the spot where the charge was  is the focus. The dust is blown out in a cloud high in the air.    Our finest and largest cities are Halifax, St. John's, Rimouski,  Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Hamilton, Saulte Ste Marie, Port  Arthur, Winnipeg, Brandon, Edmonton, New Westminster and Victoria.  Toronto, Montreal and Winnipeg each contain more than 2,000,000  inhabitants, while the others range between 500,000 and a little  over 1,000,000. At Halifax is one of the greatest car depots in the  world, and here the traveller can step on board a car for London,  Rome, Jerusalem, Bombay, Cape Town, Melbourne, Sydney, Auckland,  etc. St. John's, Fredericton and Campbelltown are large cities,  the latter being a great rendezvous for pleasure-seekers in summer.  Rimouski is a manufacturing centre and a large car depot. Cars  spring from here to Tadousac, Lake St. John's, Lake Mistassinie  and Hudson Bay ports. Quebec retains much of its old-world  picturesqueness while keeping up well with the times; its  inhabitants number about 700,000. Montreal and Toronto are without  doubt the most magnificent cities in the Dominion, perhaps in the  world. They are both famous for the grandeur of their buildings.  In them, for the most part, each block is a complete structure and  not a conglomeration of little buildings of all shapes and sizes, a  two-storey house next to a four-storey one, and so on. Thus, among  a number of blocks a pleasing harmony in architectural styles is  obtained, which is a golden mean between the rigid uniformity of  some new cities and the antique irregularity of old ones. Winnipeg  is generally reckoned to contain the finest brick buildings to be  seen anywhere; many blocks in brick may be seen of eight and nine  storeys in the grandly decorated modern style. Victoria has grown  into fame by its immense trade with the old Asiatic countries. The  ancient Orient and the modern West here combine. The broad busy  streets are thronged with a motley crowd, in which representatives  of Asiatic races mingle with Anglo-Saxons and representatives of  European nations, all speaking the universal English language. New  Westminster increases its attractions every year. It contains the  noted observatory with the splendid telescope through which living  beings have been observed in the countries in Mars and Jupiter.  In its Hall of Science is the great microscope which magnifies  many million times, and shows the atomic structure of almost any  substance. Its College of Inventors and Physical Institute are the  most perfect establishments. From its extensive Botanical Gardens,  where the Dominion Botanical Society make their experiments with  plants and trees from all countries, great national benefits have  been derived. Here are grown specimens of herbs and shrubs which  prevent or cure every human disease. On one side is seen the plant,  before the smoke of whose leaves when inhaled, consumption  succumbs; on another, the shrub whose berries eradicate scrofula  from the system, and thus through all the catalogue of ills. New  Westminster also boasts a fine University, a College of Physicians  and a Sanitarium; the two latter cause the city to be the resort of  invalids from far and near. No diseases are here called incurable.  At Mingan harbour, on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, are situated the  great works where all the rocket-cars for the Dominion are built.  The site was chosen on account of the large tract of desolate  country to the north of it. The cars as soon as built are tested,  first at short flights, then at longer ones, and conductors are  trained to manage them. There are no regular lines of cars through  or over Labrador, and so there is no risk of collision in the trial  trips. Considerable difficulty is experienced at first in taking a  car a flight of 100 miles, but by practice flights of over 1,000  miles are managed with perfect safety.    The contrast between the present and past might be drawn out to  any extent, but enough has been said to enable the dullest mind  to realize the truly marvellous development of our great Dominion.  And if the development and advance have been great industrially  and commercially, so have they been great, almost greater,  socially; for socially we have set examples which the whole  world has not been slow to follow.

The state of society in the nineteenth century would have but few  attractions for us of the twentieth, were we able to return along  the vista of a hundred years. Our manners and customs are so vastly  different from those of our great-grandfathers that we should feel  out of place indeed had we to go back, even for a short time, to  their uncouth and imperfect ways.
