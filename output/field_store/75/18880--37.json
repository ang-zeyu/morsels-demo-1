[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/590"],[0,"Robert Louis Stevenson: A Record, an Estimate, and a Memorial (#4)"],[1,"-have-  beens when I talked with him on this subject.  He had reconciled himself  in a way to the inevitable, and, like a sensible man, was now inclined to  make the most and the best of it.  The marriage, which, on the report of  it, had been but a new disappointment to him, had, as if by magic, been  transformed into a blessing in his mind and his wife's by personal  contact with Fanny Van der Griff Stevenson, which no one who ever met her  could wonder at; but, nevertheless, his dream of seeing his only son  walking in the pathways of the Stevensons, and adorning a profession in  Edinburgh, and so winning new and welcome laurels for the family and the  name, was still present with him constantly, and by contrast, he was  depressed with contemplation of the real state of the case, when, as I  have said, I pointed out to him, as more than once I did, what an  influence his son was wielding now, not only over those near to him, but  throughout the world, compared with what could have come to him as a  lighthouse engineer, however successful, or it may be as a briefless  advocate or barrister, walking, hardly in glory and in joy, the Hall of  the Edinburgh Parliament House.  And when I pictured the yet greater  influence that was sure to come to him, he only shook his head with that  smile which tells of hopes long-cherished and lost at last, and of  resignation gained, as though at stern duty's call and an honest desire  for the good of those near and dear to him.  It moved me more than I can  say, and always in the midst of it he adroitly, and somewhat abruptly,  changed the subject.  Such penalties do parents often pay for the honour  of giving geniuses to the world.  Here, again, it may be true, \"the  individual withers but the world is more and more.\"    The impression of a kind of tragic fatality was but added to when  Stevenson would speak of his father in such terms of love and admiration  as quite moved one, of his desire to please him, of his highest respect  and gratitude to him, and pride in having such a father.  It was most  characteristic that when, in his travels in America, he met a gentleman  who expressed plainly his keen disappointment on learning that he had but  been introduced to the son and not to the father--to the as yet but  budding author--and not to the builder of the great lighthouse beacons  that constantly saved mariners from shipwreck round many stormy coasts,  he should record the incident, as his readers will remember, with such a  strange mixture of a pride and filial gratitude, and half humorous  humiliation.  Such is the penalty a son of genius often pays in heart-  throbs for the inability to do aught else but follow his destiny--follow  his star, even though as Dante says:--       \"Se tu segui tua stella     Non puoi fallire a glorioso porto.\" {3}    What added a keen thrill as of quivering flesh exposed, was that Thomas  Stevenson on one side was exactly the man to appreciate such attainments  and work in another, and I often wondered how far the sense of Edinburgh  propriety and worldly estimates did weigh with him here.    Mr Stevenson mentioned to me a peculiar fact which has since been noted  by his son, that, notwithstanding the kind of work he had so successfully  engaged in, he was no mathematician, and had to submit his calculations  to another to be worked out in definite mathematical formulae.  Thomas  Stevenson gave one the impression of a remarkably sweet, great  personality, grave, anxious, almost morbidly forecasting, yet full of  childlike hope and ready affection, but, perhaps, so earnestly taken up  with some points as to exaggerate their importance and be too  self-conscious and easily offended in respect to them.  But there was no  affectation in him.  He was simple-minded, sincere to the core; most  kindly, homely, hospitable, much intent on brotherly offices.  He had the  Scottish _perfervidum_ too--he could tolerate nothing mean or creeping;  and his eye would lighten and glance in a striking manner when such was  spoken of.  I have since heard that his charities were very extensive,  and dispensed in the most hidden and secret ways.  He acted here on the  Scripture direction, \"Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand  doeth.\"  He was much exercised when I saw him about some defects, as he  held, in the methods of Scotch education (for he was a true lover of  youth, and cared more for character being formed than for heads being  merely crammed).  Sagacious, with fine forecast, with a high ideal, and  yet up to a certain point a most tolerant temper, he was a fine specimen  of the Scottish gentleman.  His son tells that, as he was engaged in work  calculated to benefit the world and to save life, he would not for long  take out a patent for his inventions, and thus lost immense sums.  I can  well believe that: it seems quite in keeping with my impressions of the  man.  There was nothing stolid or selfishly absorbed in him.  He bore the  marks of deep, true, honest feeling, true benevolence, and open-handed  generosity, and despite the son's great pen-craft, and inventive power,  would have forgiven my saying that sometimes I have had a doubt whether  the father was not, after all, the greater man of the two, though  certainly not, like the hero of _In Memoriam_, moulded \"in colossal  calm.\"    In theological matters, in which Thomas Stevenson had been much and  deeply exercised, he held very strong views, leading decisively to ultra-  Calvinism; but, as I myself could well sympathise with such views, if I  did not hold them, knowing well the strange ways in which they had gone  to form grand, if sometimes sternly forbidding characters, there were no  cross-purposes as there might have been with some on that subject.  And  always I felt I had an original character and a most interesting one to  study.    This is another very characteristic letter to me from Davos Platz:       \"CHALET BUOL, DAVOS, GRISONS,     SWITZERLAND.  (_No date_.)       \"MY DEAR DR JAPP,--You must think me a forgetful rogue, as indeed I     am; for I have but now told my publisher to send you a copy of the     _Familiar Studies_.  However, I own I have delayed this letter till I     could send you the enclosed.  Remembering the night at Braemar, when     we visited the picture-gallery, I hoped they might amuse you.       \"You see we do some publishing hereaway.       \"With kind regards, believe me, always yours faithfully,       ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.\"       \"I shall hope to see you in town in May.\"    The enclosed was the second series of _Moral Emblems_, by R. L.  Stevenson, printed by Samuel Osbourne.  My answer to this letter brought  the following:       \"CHALET-BUOL, DAVOS,     _April_ 1_st_, 1882.       \"MY DEAR DR JAPP,--A good day to date this letter, which is, in fact,     a confession of incapacity.  During my wife's wretched illness--or I     should say the worst of it, for she is not yet rightly well--I     somewhat lost my head, and entirely lost a great quire of corrected     proofs.  This is one of the results: I hope there are none more     serious.  I was never so sick of any volume as I was of that; I was     continually receiving fresh proofs with fresh infinitesimal     difficulties.  I was ill; I did really fear, for my wife was worse     than ill.  Well, 'tis out now; and though I have already observed     several carelessnesses myself, and now here is another of your     finding--of which indeed, I ought to be ashamed--it will only justify     the sweeping humility of the preface.       \"Symonds was actually dining with us when your letter came, and I     communicated your remarks, which pleased him.  He is a far better and     more interesting thing than his books.       \"The elephant was my wife's, so she is proportionately elate you     should have picked it out for praise from a collection, let us add, so     replete with the highest qualities of art.       \"My wicked carcass, as John Knox calls it, holds together wonderfully.     In addition to many other things, and a volume of travel, I find I     have written since December ninety Cornhill pp. of Magazine     work--essays and stories--40,000 words; and I am none the worse--I am     better.  I begin to hope I may, if not outlive this wolverine upon my     shoulders, at least carry him bravely like Symonds or Alexander Pope.     I begin to take a pride in that hope.       \"I shall be much interested to see your criticisms: you might perhaps     send them on to me.  I believe you know that I am not dangerous--one     folly I have not--I am not touchy under criticism.       \"Sam and my wife both beg to be remembered, and Sam also sends as a     present a work of his own.--Yours very sincerely,       ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.\"    As indicating the estimate of many of the good Edinburgh people of  Stevenson and the Stevensons that still held sway up to so late a date as  1893, I will here extract two characteristic passages from the letters of  the friend and correspondent of these days just referred to, and to whom  I had sent a copy of the _Atalanta_ Magazine, with an article of mine on  Stevenson.       \"If you can excuse the garrulity of age, I can tell you one or two     things about Louis Stevenson, his father and even his grandfather,     which you may work up some other day, as you have so deftly embedded     in the _Atalanta_ article that small remark on his acting.  Your paper     is pleasant and modest: most of R. L. Stevenson's admirers are     inclined to lay it on far too thick.  That he is a genius we all     admit; but his genius, if fine, is limited.  For example, he cannot     paint (or at least he never has painted) a woman.  No more could     Fettes Douglas, skilful artist though he was in his own special line,     and I shall tell you a remark of Russel's thereon some day. {4}  There     are women in his books, but there is none of the beauty and subtlety     of womanhood in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5921"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 1, Complete (#4)"],[1,"extended to literature. Men who, like Garcilaso de la Vega  and Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, followed the Italian wars, had brought back  from Italy the products of the post-Renaissance literature, which took  root and flourished and even threatened to extinguish the native growths.  Damon and Thyrsis, Phyllis and Chloe had been fairly naturalised in  Spain, together with all the devices of pastoral poetry for investing  with an air of novelty the idea of a dispairing shepherd and inflexible  shepherdess. As a set-off against this, the old historical and  traditional ballads, and the true pastorals, the songs and ballads of  peasant life, were being collected assiduously and printed in the  cancioneros that succeeded one another with increasing rapidity. But the  most notable consequence, perhaps, of the spread of printing was the  flood of romances of chivalry that had continued to pour from the press  ever since Garci Ordonez de Montalvo had resuscitated \"Amadis of Gaul\" at  the beginning of the century.    For a youth fond of reading, solid or light, there could have been no  better spot in Spain than Alcala de Henares in the middle of the  sixteenth century. It was then a busy, populous university town,  something more than the enterprising rival of Salamanca, and altogether a  very different place from the melancholy, silent, deserted Alcala the  traveller sees now as he goes from Madrid to Saragossa. Theology and  medicine may have been the strong points of the university, but the town  itself seems to have inclined rather to the humanities and light  literature, and as a producer of books Alcala was already beginning to  compete with the older presses of Toledo, Burgos, Salamanca and Seville.    A pendant to the picture Cervantes has given us of his first playgoings  might, no doubt, have been often seen in the streets of Alcala at that  time; a bright, eager, tawny-haired boy peering into a book-shop where  the latest volumes lay open to tempt the public, wondering, it may be,  what that little book with the woodcut of the blind beggar and his boy,  that called itself \"Vida de Lazarillo de Tormes, segunda impresion,\"  could be about; or with eyes brimming over with merriment gazing at one  of those preposterous portraits of a knight-errant in outrageous panoply  and plumes with which the publishers of chivalry romances loved to  embellish the title-pages of their folios. If the boy was the father of  the man, the sense of the incongruous that was strong at fifty was lively  at ten, and some such reflections as these may have been the true genesis  of \"Don Quixote.\"    For his more solid education, we are told, he went to Salamanca. But why  Rodrigo de Cervantes, who was very poor, should have sent his son to a  university a hundred and fifty miles away when he had one at his own  door, would be a puzzle, if we had any reason for supposing that he did  so. The only evidence is a vague statement by Professor Tomas Gonzalez,  that he once saw an old entry of the matriculation of a Miguel de  Cervantes. This does not appear to have been ever seen again; but even if  it had, and if the date corresponded, it would prove nothing, as there  were at least two other Miguels born about the middle of the century; one  of them, moreover, a Cervantes Saavedra, a cousin, no doubt, who was a  source of great embarrassment to the biographers.    That he was a student neither at Salamanca nor at Alcala is best proved  by his own works. No man drew more largely upon experience than he did,  and he has nowhere left a single reminiscence of student life-for the  \"Tia Fingida,\" if it be his, is not one--nothing, not even \"a college  joke,\" to show that he remembered days that most men remember best. All  that we know positively about his education is that Juan Lopez de Hoyos,  a professor of humanities and belles-lettres of some eminence, calls him  his \"dear and beloved pupil.\" This was in a little collection of verses  by different hands on the death of Isabel de Valois, second queen of  Philip II, published by the professor in 1569, to which Cervantes  contributed four pieces, including an elegy, and an epitaph in the form  of a sonnet. It is only by a rare chance that a \"Lycidas\" finds its way  into a volume of this sort, and Cervantes was no Milton. His verses are  no worse than such things usually are; so much, at least, may be said for  them.    By the time the book appeared he had left Spain, and, as fate ordered it,  for twelve years, the most eventful ones of his life. Giulio, afterwards  Cardinal, Acquaviva had been sent at the end of 1568 to Philip II by the  Pope on a mission, partly of condolence, partly political, and on his  return to Rome, which was somewhat brusquely expedited by the King, he  took Cervantes with him as his camarero (chamberlain), the office he  himself held in the Pope's household. The post would no doubt have led to  advancement at the Papal Court had Cervantes retained it, but in the  summer of 1570 he resigned it and enlisted as a private soldier in  Captain Diego Urbina's company, belonging to Don Miguel de Moncada's  regiment, but at that time forming a part of the command of Marc Antony  Colonna. What impelled him to this step we know not, whether it was  distaste for the career before him, or purely military enthusiasm. It may  well have been the latter, for it was a stirring time; the events,  however, which led to the alliance between Spain, Venice, and the Pope,  against the common enemy, the Porte, and to the victory of the combined  fleets at Lepanto, belong rather to the history of Europe than to the  life of Cervantes. He was one of those that sailed from Messina, in  September 1571, under the command of Don John of Austria; but on the  morning of the 7th of October, when the Turkish fleet was sighted, he was  lying below ill with fever. At the news that the enemy was in sight he  rose, and, in spite of the remonstrances of his comrades and superiors,  insisted on taking his post, saying he preferred death in the service of  God and the King to health. His galley, the Marquesa, was in the thick of  the fight, and before it was over he had received three gunshot wounds,  two in the breast and one in the left hand or arm. On the morning after  the battle, according to Navarrete, he had an interview with the  commander-in-chief, Don John, who was making a personal inspection of the  wounded, one result of which was an addition of three crowns to his pay,  and another, apparently, the friendship of his general.    How severely Cervantes was wounded may be inferred from the fact, that  with youth, a vigorous frame, and as cheerful and buoyant a temperament  as ever invalid had, he was seven months in hospital at Messina before he  was discharged. He came out with his left hand permanently disabled; he  had lost the use of it, as Mercury told him in the \"Viaje del Parnaso\"  for the greater glory of the right. This, however, did not absolutely  unfit him for service, and in April 1572 he joined Manuel Ponce de Leon's  company of Lope de Figueroa's regiment, in which, it seems probable, his  brother Rodrigo was serving, and shared in the operations of the next  three years, including the capture of the Goletta and Tunis. Taking  advantage of the lull which followed the recapture of these places by the  Turks, he obtained leave to return to Spain, and sailed from Naples in  September 1575 on board the Sun galley, in company with his brother  Rodrigo, Pedro Carrillo de Quesada, late Governor of the Goletta, and  some others, and furnished with letters from Don John of Austria and the  Duke of Sesa, the Viceroy of Sicily, recommending him to the King for the  command of a company, on account of his services; a dono infelice as  events proved. On the 26th they fell in with a squadron of Algerine  galleys, and after a stout resistance were overpowered and carried into  Algiers.    By means of a ransomed fellow-captive the brothers contrived to inform  their family of their condition, and the poor people at Alcala at once  strove to raise the ransom money, the father disposing of all he  possessed, and the two sisters giving up their marriage portions. But  Dali Mami had found on Cervantes the letters addressed to the King by Don  John and the Duke of Sesa, and, concluding that his prize must be a  person of great consequence, when the money came he refused it scornfully  as being altogether insufficient. The owner of Rodrigo, however, was more  easily satisfied; ransom was accepted in his case, and it was arranged  between the brothers that he should return to Spain and procure a vessel  in which he was to come back to Algiers and take off Miguel and as many  of their comrades as possible. This was not the first attempt to escape  that Cervantes had made. Soon after the commencement of his captivity he  induced several of his companions to join him in trying to reach Oran,  then a Spanish post, on foot; but after the first day's journey, the Moor  who had agreed to act as their guide deserted them, and they had no  choice but to return. The second attempt was more disastrous. In a garden  outside the city on the sea-shore, he constructed, with the help of the  gardener, a Spaniard, a hiding-place, to which he brought, one by one,  fourteen of his fellow-captives, keeping them there in secrecy for  several months, and supplying them with food through a renegade known as  El Dorador, \"the Gilder.\" How he, a captive himself, contrived to do all  this, is one of the mysteries of the story. Wild as the project may  appear, it was very nearly successful. The vessel procured by Rodrigo  made its appearance off the coast, and under cover of night was  proceeding to take off the refugees, when the crew were alarmed by a  passing fishing boat, and beat a hasty retreat. On renewing the attempt  shortly afterwards, they, or a portion of them at least, were taken  prisoners, and just as the "]]]
