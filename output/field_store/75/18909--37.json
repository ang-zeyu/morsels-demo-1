Aviators, of course, are imitating the  gull, and soon perhaps we may see an aeroplane or a glider dipping  gracefully up and down in the face of an opposing wind and all the  time forging ahead across the Atlantic Ocean. The gulls were still  behind us when night fell, and still they screamed and dipped down  into the broad wake of foam which we left behind; but in the morning  they were gone: perhaps they had seen in the night a steamer bound for  their Queenstown home and had escorted her back.    All afternoon we steamed along the coast of Ireland, with grey cliffs  guarding the shores, and hills rising behind gaunt and barren; as dusk  fell, the coast rounded away from us to the northwest, and the last we  saw of Europe was the Irish mountains dim and faint in the dropping  darkness. With the thought that we had seen the last of land until we  set foot on the shores of America, I retired to the library to write  letters, little knowing that many things would happen to us all--many  experiences, sudden, vivid and impressive to be encountered, many  perils to be faced, many good and true people for whom we should have  to mourn--before we saw land again.    There is very little to relate from the time of leaving Queenstown on  Thursday to Sunday morning. The sea was calm,--so calm, indeed,  that very few were absent from meals: the wind westerly and  southwesterly,--\"fresh\" as the daily chart described it,--but often  rather cold, generally too cold to sit out on deck to read or write,  so that many of us spent a good part of the time in the library,  reading and writing. I wrote a large number of letters and posted them  day by day in the box outside the library door: possibly they are  there yet.    Each morning the sun rose behind us in a sky of circular clouds,  stretching round the horizon in long, narrow streaks and rising tier  upon tier above the sky-line, red and pink and fading from pink to  white, as the sun rose higher in the sky. It was a beautiful sight to  one who had not crossed the ocean before (or indeed been out of sight  of the shores of England) to stand on the top deck and watch the swell  of the sea extending outwards from the ship in an unbroken circle  until it met the sky-line with its hint of infinity: behind, the wake  of the vessel white with foam where, fancy suggested, the propeller  blades had cut up the long Atlantic rollers and with them made a level  white road bounded on either side by banks of green, blue, and  blue-green waves that would presently sweep away the white road,  though as yet it stretched back to the horizon and dipped over the  edge of the world back to Ireland and the gulls, while along it the  morning sun glittered and sparkled. And each night the sun sank right  in our eyes along the sea, making an undulating glittering path way, a  golden track charted on the surface of the ocean which our ship  followed unswervingly until the sun dipped below the edge of the  horizon, and the pathway ran ahead of us faster than we could steam  and slipped over the edge of the skyline,--as if the sun had been a  golden ball and had wound up its thread of gold too quickly for us to  follow.    From 12 noon Thursday to 12 noon Friday we ran 386 miles, Friday to  Saturday 519 miles, Saturday to Sunday 546 miles. The second day's run  of 519 miles was, the purser told us, a disappointment, and we should  not dock until Wednesday morning instead of Tuesday night, as we had  expected; however, on Sunday we were glad to see a longer run had been  made, and it was thought we should make New York, after all, on  Tuesday night. The purser remarked: \"They are not pushing her this  trip and don't intend to make any fast running: I don't suppose we  shall do more than 546 now; it is not a bad day's run for the first  trip.\" This was at lunch, and I remember the conversation then turned  to the speed and build of Atlantic liners as factors in their comfort  of motion: all those who had crossed many times were unanimous in  saying the Titanic was the most comfortable boat they had been on, and  they preferred the speed we were making to that of the faster boats,  from the point of view of lessened vibration as well as because the  faster boats would bore through the waves with a twisted, screw-like  motion instead of the straight up-and-down swing of the Titanic. I  then called the attention of our table to the way the Titanic listed  to port (I had noticed this before), and we all watched the sky-line  through the portholes as we sat at the purser's table in the saloon:  it was plain she did so, for the sky-line and sea on the port side  were visible most of the time and on the starboard only sky. The  purser remarked that probably coal had been used mostly from the  starboard side. It is no doubt a common occurrence for all vessels to  list to some degree; but in view of the fact that the Titanic was cut  open on the starboard side and before she sank listed so much to port  that there was quite a chasm between her and the swinging lifeboats,  across which ladies had to be thrown or to cross on chairs laid flat,  the previous listing to port may be of interest.    Returning for a moment to the motion of the Titanic, it was  interesting to stand on the boat-deck, as I frequently did, in the  angle between lifeboats 13 and 15 on the starboard side (two boats I  have every reason to remember, for the first carried me in safety to  the Carpathia, and it seemed likely at one time that the other would  come down on our heads as we sat in 13 trying to get away from the  ship's side), and watch the general motion of the ship through the  waves resolve itself into two motions--one to be observed by  contrasting the docking-bridge, from which the log-line trailed away  behind in the foaming wake, with the horizon, and observing the long,  slow heave as we rode up and down. I timed the average period occupied  in one up-and-down vibration, but do not now remember the figures. The  second motion was a side-to-side roll, and could be calculated by  watching the port rail and contrasting it with the horizon as before.  It seems likely that this double motion is due to the angle at which  our direction to New York cuts the general set of the Gulf Stream  sweeping from the Gulf of Mexico across to Europe; but the almost  clock-like regularity of the two vibratory movements was what  attracted my attention: it was while watching the side roll that I  first became aware of the list to port. Looking down astern from the  boat-deck or from B deck to the steerage quarters, I often noticed how  the third-class passengers were enjoying every minute of the time: a  most uproarious skipping game of the mixed-double type was the great  favourite, while \"in and out and roundabout\" went a Scotchman with his  bagpipes playing something that Gilbert says \"faintly resembled an  air.\" Standing aloof from all of them, generally on the raised stern  deck above the \"playing field,\" was a man of about twenty to  twenty-four years of age, well-dressed, always gloved and nicely  groomed, and obviously quite out of place among his fellow-passengers:  he never looked happy all the time. I watched him, and classified him  at hazard as the man who had been a failure in some way at home and  had received the proverbial shilling plus third-class fare to America:  he did not look resolute enough or happy enough to be working out his  own problem. Another interesting man was travelling steerage, but had  placed his wife in the second cabin: he would climb the stairs leading  from the steerage to the second deck and talk affectionately with his  wife across the low gate which separated them. I never saw him after  the collision, but I think his wife was on the Carpathia. Whether they  ever saw each other on the Sunday night is very doubtful: he would not  at first be allowed on the second-class deck, and if he were, the  chances of seeing his wife in the darkness and the crowd would be very  small, indeed. Of all those playing so happily on the steerage deck I  did not recognize many afterwards on the Carpathia.    Coming now to Sunday, the day on which the Titanic struck the iceberg,  it will be interesting, perhaps, to give the day's events in some  detail, to appreciate the general attitude of passengers to their  surroundings just before the collision. Service was held in the saloon  by the purser in the morning, and going on deck after lunch we found  such a change in temperature that not many cared to remain to face the  bitter wind--an artificial wind created mainly, if not entirely, by  the ship's rapid motion through the chilly atmosphere. I should judge  there was no wind blowing at the time, for I had noticed about the  same force of wind approaching Queenstown, to find that it died away  as soon as we stopped, only to rise again as we steamed away from the  harbour.    Returning to the library, I stopped for a moment to read again the  day's run and observe our position on the chart; the Rev. Mr. Carter,  a clergyman of the Church of England, was similarly engaged, and we  renewed a conversation we had enjoyed for some days: it had  commenced with a discussion of the relative merits of his  university--Oxford--with mine--Cambridge--as world-wide educational  agencies, the opportunities at each for the formation of character  apart from mere education as such, and had led on to the lack of  sufficiently qualified men to take up the work of the Church of  England (a matter apparently on which he felt very deeply) and from  that to his own work in England as a priest. He told me some of his  parish problems and spoke of the impossibility of doing half his work  in his Church without the help his wife gave. I knew her only slightly  at that time, but meeting her later in the day, I realized something  of what he meant in attributing a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6677"],[0,"Seventy-Five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes and Sweetmeats, (#4)"],[1,"taste fresh.    Raspberry and apple-pies are much improved by taking off the lid,  and pouring in a little cream just before they go to table.  Replace the lid very carefully.      OYSTER PIE.      A hundred large fresh oysters, or more if small.    The yolks of six eggs boiled hard.    A large slice of stale-bread, grated.    A tea-spoonful of salt.    A table-spoonful of pepper.    A table-spoonful of mixed spice, nutmeg, mace and cinnamon.    Take a large round dish, butter it and spread a rich paste over  the sides, and round the edge, but not at the bottom.    Salt oysters will not do for pies. They should be fresh, and as  large and fine as possible.    Drain off part of the liquor from the oysters. Put them into a  pan, and season them with pepper, salt and spice. Stir them well  with the seasoning. Have ready the yolks of eggs, chopped fine,  and the grated bread. Pour the oysters (with as much of their  liquor as you please) into the dish that has the paste in it.  Strew over them the chopped egg and grated bread.    Roll out the lid of the pie, and put it on, crimping the edges  handsomely.    Take a small sheet of paste, cut it into a square and roll it up.  Cut it with a sharp knife into the form of a double tulip.    Make a slit in the centre of the upper crust, and stick the tulip  in it.    Cut out eight large leaves of paste, and lay them on the lid.    Bake the pie in a quick oven.    If you think the oysters will be too much done by baking them in  the crust, you can substitute for them pieces of bread, to keep up  the lid of the pie.    Put the oysters with their liquor and the seasoning, chopped egg,  grated bread, &c. into a pan. Cover them closely, and let them  just come to a boil, taking them off the fire, and stirring them  frequently.    When the crust is baked, take the lid neatly off (loosening it  round the edge with a knife) take out the pieces of bread, and put  in the oysters. Lay the lid on again very carefully.    For oyster patties, the oysters are prepared in the same manner.    They may be chopped if you choose. They must be put in small  shells of puff-paste.      BEEF-STEAK PIE.    Butter a deep dish, and spread a sheet of paste all over the  bottom, sides, and edge.    Cut away from your beef-steak all the bone, fat, gristle, and  skin. Cut the lean in small thin pieces, about as large,  generally, as the palm of your hand. Beat the meat well with the  rolling-pin, to make it juicy and tender. If you put in the fat,  it will make the gravy too greasy and strong, as it cannot be  skimmed.    Put a layer of meat over the bottom-crust of your dish, and season  it to your taste, with pepper, salt, and, if you choose, a little  nutmeg. A small quantity of mushroom ketchup is an improvement;  so, also, is a little minced onion.    Have ready some cold boiled potatoes sliced thin. Spread over the  meat, a layer of potatoes, and a small piece of butter; then  another layer of meat, seasoned, and then a layer of potatoes, and  so on till the dish is full and heaped up in the middle, having a  layer of meat on the top. Pour in a little water.    Cover the pie with a sheet of paste, and trim the edges. Notch it  handsomely with a knife; and, if you choose, make a tulip of  paste, and stick it in the middle of the lid, and lay leaves of  paste round it.    Fresh oysters will greatly improve a beef-steak pie. So also will  mushrooms.    Any meat pie may be made in a similar manner.      INDIAN PUDDING.      A pound of beef-suet, chopped very fine.    A pint of molasses.    A pint of rich milk.    Four eggs.    A large tea-spoonful of powdered nutmeg and cinnamon.    A little grated or chipped lemon-peel.    Indian meal sufficient to make a thick batter.    Warm the milk and molasses, and stir them together. Beat the eggs,  and stir them gradually into the milk and molasses, in turn with  the suet and indian meal. Add the spice and lemon-peel and stir  all very hard together. Take care not to put too much indian meal,  or the pudding will be heavy and solid.    Dip the cloth in boiling water. Shake it out, and flour it  slightly. Pour the mixture into it, and tie it up, leaving room  for the pudding to swell.    Boil it three hours. Serve it up hot, and eat it with sauce made  of drawn butter, wine and nutmeg.    When cold, it is good cut in slices and fried.      BATTER PUDDING.      Six eggs.    Eight table-spoonfuls of sifted flour.    One quart of milk.    A salt-spoonful of salt.    Stir the flour, gradually, into the milk, carefully dissolving all  the lumps. Beat the eggs very light, and add them by degrees to  the milk and flour. Put in the salt, and stir the whole well  together.    Take a very thick pudding-cloth. Dip it in boiling water, and  flour it. Pour into it the mixture and tie it up, leaving room for  it to swell. Boil it hard, one hour, and keep it in the pot, till  it is time to send it to table. Serve it up with wine-sauce.    A square cloth, which when tied up will make the pudding of a  round form, is better than a bag.    Apple Batter Pudding is made by pouring the batter over a dish of  pippins, pared, cored, and sweetened, either whole or cut in  pieces. Bake it, and eat it with butter and sugar.      BREAD PUDDING.      A quarter of a pound of grated stale bread.    A quart of milk, boiled with two or three sticks of cinnamon,      slightly broken.    Eight eggs.    A quarter of a pound of sugar.    A little grated lemon-peel.    Boil the milk with the cinnamon, strain it, and set it away till  quite cold.    Grate as much crumb of stale bread as will weigh a quarter of a  pound. Beat the eggs, and when the milk is cold, stir them into it  in turn with the bread and sugar. Add the lemon-peel, and if you  choose, a table spoonful of rosewater.    Bake it in a buttered dish, and grate nutmeg over it when done. Do  not send it to table hot. Baked puddings should never be eaten  till they have become cold, or at least cool.      RICE PUDDING.      A quarter of a pound of rice.    A quarter of a pound of butter.    A quarter of a pound of sugar.    A pint and a half of milk, or cream and milk.    Six eggs.    A tea-spoonful of mixed spice, mace, nutmeg and cinnamon.    A half wine-glass of rose-water.    Wash the rice. Boil it till very soft. Drain it and set it away  to get cold. Put the butter and sugar together in a pan, and stir  them till very light. Add to them the spice and rose-water. Beat  the eggs very light, and stir them, gradually, into the milk. Then  stir the eggs and the milk into the butter and sugar, alternately  with the rice.    Bake it and grate nutmeg over the top.    Currants or raisins, floured, and stirred in at the last, will  greatly improve it.    It should be eaten cold, or quite cool.      BOSTON PUDDING.    Make a good common paste with a pound and a half of flour, and  three quarters of a pound of butter. [Footnote: Or three quarters  of a pound of beef suet, chopped very fine. Mix the suet at once  with the flour, knead it with cold water into a stiff dough, and  then roll it out into a large thin sheet. Fold it up and roll it  again.] When you roll it out the last time, cut off the edges,  till you get the sheet of paste of an even square shape.    Have ready some fruit sweetened to your taste. If cranberries,  gooseberries, dried peaches, or damsons, they should be stewed,  and made very sweet. If apples, they should be stewed in a very  little water, drained, and seasoned with nutmeg, rosewater and  lemon. If currants, raspberries, or blackberries, they should be  mashed with sugar, and put into the pudding raw.    Spread the fruit very thick, all over the sheet of paste, (which  must not be rolled out too thin.) When it is covered all over with  the fruit, roll it up, and close the dough at both ends, and down  the last side. Tie the pudding in a cloth and boil it.    Eat it with sugar. It must not be taken out of the pot till just  before it is brought to table.      FRITTERS.      Seven eggs.    Half a pint of milk.    A salt-spoonful of salt.    Sufficient flour to make a thick batter.    Beat the eggs well and stir them gradually into the milk. Add the  salt, and stir in flour enough to make a thick batter.    Fry them in lard, and serve them up hot.    Eat them with wine and sugar.    They are improved by stirring in a table-spoonful of yeast.    These are excellent with the addition of cold stewed apple,  stirred into the mixtures in which case use less flour.      FINE CUSTARDS.      A quart of milk or cream.    The yoke only, of sixteen eggs.    Six ounces of powdered white sugar.    A large handful of peach-leaves or half an ounce of peach kernels    or bitter almonds, broken in pieces.    A table-spoonful of rose-water.    A nutmeg.    Boil in the milk the cinnamon, and the peach-leaves, or  peach-kernels. When it has boiled, set it away to get cold. As  soon as it is cold, strain it through a sieve, to clear it from  the cinnamon, peach-leaves, &c. and stir into it gradually, the  sugar, spice, and rose-water.    Beat the yolks of sixteen eggs very light, and stir them by  degrees into the milk, which must be quite cold or the eggs will  make it curdle. Put the custards into cups, and set them in a  baking pan, half filled with water. When baked, grate some nutmeg  over each and ice them. Make the icing of the whites of eight  eggs, a large tea-spoonful of powdered loaf sugar, and six drops  of essence of lemon, beaten all together till it stands alone.  Pile up some of the icing on the top of each custard, heaping it  high. Put a spot of red nonpareils on the middle of the pile of  icing.    If the weather be damp, or the eggs not new-laid, more than eight  whites will be required for the icing.      PLAIN CUSTARDS.      A quart of rich milk.    Eight eggs.    A quarter of a pound of powdered sugar.    A handful of peach-leaves, or half an ounce of peach-kernels,      broken in pieces.    A nutmeg.    Boil"]]]
