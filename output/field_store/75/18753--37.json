You will smile at my allusion; but I will  disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my  passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean, to that  production of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something  at work in my soul, which I do not understand. I am practically  industrious--pains-taking;--a workman to execute with perseverance and  labour:--but besides this, there is a love for the marvellous, a belief  in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out  of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited  regions I am about to explore.    But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after  having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of  Africa or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to  look on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to  me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions  when I need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly.  Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.    Your affectionate brother,    ROBERT WALTON.          LETTER III.      _To Mrs. Saville, England._    MY DEAR SISTER, July 7th, 17--.    I write a few lines in haste, to say that I am safe, and well advanced  on my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on its  homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see  my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good spirits:  my men are bold, and apparently firm of purpose; nor do the floating  sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers of the  region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We have  already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of summer,  and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which blow  us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain,  breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected.    No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a  letter. One or two stiff gales, and the springing of a leak, are  accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record; and  I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.    Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured, that for my own sake, as well as  yours, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool, persevering,  and prudent.    But success _shall_ crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I have  gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas: the very stars  themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not still  proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the  determined heart and resolved will of man?    My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must  finish. Heaven bless my beloved sister!    R. W.          LETTER IV.      _To Mrs. Saville, England._    August 5th, 17--.    So strange an accident has happened to us, that I cannot forbear  recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before  these papers can come into your possession.    Last Monday (July 31st), we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed  in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she  floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were  compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that  some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.    About two o'clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in  every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have  no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow  watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted  our attention, and diverted our solicitude from our own situation. We  perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on  towards the north, at the distance of half a mile: a being which had the  shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge,  and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with  our telescopes, until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the  ice.    This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,  many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote  that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in,  however, by ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had  observed with the greatest attention.    About two hours after this occurrence, we heard the ground sea; and  before night the ice broke, and freed our ship. We, however, lay to  until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose  masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited  of this time to rest for a few hours.    In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck, and  found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking  to some one in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen  before, which had drifted towards us in the night, on a large fragment  of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within  it, whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as  the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some  undiscovered island, but an European. When I appeared on deck, the  master said, \"Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish  on the open sea.\"    On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a  foreign accent. \"Before I come on board your vessel,\" said he, \"will  you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?\"    You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to  me from a man on the brink of destruction, and to whom I should have  supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not  have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I  replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the  northern pole.    Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to come on board.  Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his  safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were nearly  frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I  never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him  into the cabin; but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted.  We accordingly brought him back to the deck, and restored him to  animation by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing him to swallow a small  quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in  blankets, and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove. By slow  degrees he recovered, and ate a little soup, which restored him  wonderfully.    Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak; and I often  feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he  had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin, and  attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more  interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness,  and even madness; but there are moments when, if any one performs an act  of kindness towards him, or does him any the most trifling service, his  whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence  and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy  and despairing; and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of  the weight of woes that oppresses him.    When my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off  the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not  allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body  and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once,  however, the lieutenant asked, Why he had come so far upon the ice in so  strange a vehicle?    His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom; and he  replied, \"To seek one who fled from me.\"    \"And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then I fancy we have seen him; for the day before we picked you up, we  saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.\"    This aroused the stranger's attention; and he asked a multitude of  questions concerning the route which the daemon, as he called him, had  pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said,--\"I have,  doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people;  but you are too considerate to make enquiries.\"    \"Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to  trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.\"    \"And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have  benevolently restored me to life.\"    Soon after this he enquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice  had destroyed the other sledge? I replied, that I could not answer with  any degree of certainty; for the ice had not broken until near midnight,  and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that  time; but of this I could not judge.    From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the  stranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck, to watch  for the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to  remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of  the atmosphere. I have promised that some one should watch for him, and  give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.    Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the  present day. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4248"],[0,"The Problem of the Ohio Mounds (#4)"],[1,"8, p. 57.]    Tribal divisions.--As the proofs that the mound-builders pertained  to various tribes often at war with each other are now too  numerous and strong to be longer denied, we may see in them  evidences of a social condition similar to that of the Indians.    Similarity in burial customs.--There are perhaps no other remains  of a barbarous or unenlightened people which give us so clear a  conception of their superstitions and religious beliefs as do  those which relate to the disposal of their dead. By the modes  adopted for such disposal, and the relics found in the receptacles  of the dead, we are enabled not only to understand something of  these superstitions and beliefs, but also to judge of their  culture status and to gain some knowledge of their arts, customs,  and modes of life.    The mortuary customs of the mound-builders, as gleaned from an  examination of their burial mounds, ancient cemeteries, and other  depositories of their dead, present so many striking resemblances  to those of the Indians when first encountered by the whites, as  to leave little room for doubt regarding their identity.  [Footnote: Evidence bearing on this point will be found in the  paper on The Burial Mounds of the Northern Sections, by C. Thomas,  in the Fifth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology.] Nor is  this similarity limited to the customs in the broad and general  sense, but it is carried down to the more minute and striking  peculiarities.    Among the general features in which resemblances are noted are the  following:    The mound-builders were accustomed to dispose of their dead in  many different ways; their modes of sepulture were also quite  varied. The same statements will apply with equal force to the  Indians.    \"The commonest mode of burial among North American Indians,\" we  are informed by Dr. H. C. Yarrow, [Footnote: First Annual Report  Bureau of Ethnology, Smithsonian Institution, 1879-'80 (1881), p.  93.] \"has been that of interment in the ground, and this has taken  place in a number of ways.\" The different ways he mentions are, in  pits, graves, or holes in the ground; in stone graves or cists; in  mounds; beneath or in cabins, wigwams, houses or lodges, and in  caves.    The most common method of burial among the mound-builders was by  inhumation also, and all the different ways mentioned by Dr.  Yarrow as practiced by the Indians were in vogue among the former.  It was supposed for a long time that their chief and almost only  place of depositing their dead was in the burial mounds, but more  thorough explorations have revealed the fact that near most mound  villages are cemeteries, often of considerable extent.    The chief value of this fact in this connection is that it forms  one item of evidence against the theory held by some antiquarians  that the mound-builders were Mexicans, as the usual mode of  disposing of the dead by the latter was cremation. [Footnote:  Clavigero, Hist. Mex., Cullen's transl., I, 325; Torquemada,  Monarq. Ind., I, p.60, etc.] According to Brasseur de Bourbourg  the Toltecs also practiced cremation. [Footnote: H.H. Bancroft,  Native Races, vol. 2, 1882, p. 609.]    REMOVAL OF THE FLESH BEFORE BURIAL.--This practice appears to have  been followed quite generally by both Indians and mound-builders.    That it was followed to a considerable extent by the mound  builders of various sections is shown by the following evidence:    The confused masses of human bones frequently found in mounds show  by their relation to each other that they must have been gathered  together after the flesh had been removed, as this condition could  not possibly have been assumed after burial in their natural  state. Instances of this kind are so numerous and well known that  it is scarcely necessary to present any evidence in support of the  statement. The well-known instance referred to by Jefferson in his  \"Notes on Virginia\" [Footnote: Fourth Am. ed., 1801, p. 143; p.  146, in 8th ed.] is one in point. \"The appearance,\" he tells us,  \"certainly indicates that it [the barrow] has derived both origin  and growth from the customary collections of bones and deposition  of them together.\"    Notices of similar deposits have been observed as follows: In  Wisconsin, by Mr. Armstrong; [Footnote: Smithsonian Rept., 1879,  p. 337] in Florida, by James Bell [Footnote: Smithsonian Rept.,  1881, p. 636.] and Mr. Walker; [Footnote: Smithsonian Rept., 1879,  p. 398] in Cass County, Ill., by Mr. Snyder; [Footnote:  Smithsonian Rept., 1881, p. 573.] in Georgia, by C. C. Jones.  [Footnote: Antiq. So. Inds., p. 193.] Similar deposits have also  been found by the assistants of the Bureau of Ethnology in  Wisconsin, Illinois, northern Missouri, North Carolina, New York,  and Arkansas.    Another proof of this custom was observed by Mr. J. D. Middleton  and Colonel Morris in Wisconsin, northeastern Missouri, and  Illinois. In numerous mounds the skeletons were found packed  closely side by side, immediately beneath a layer of hard, mortar-  like substance. The fact that this mortar had completely filled  the interstices, and in many cases the skulls also, showed that it  had been placed over them while in a plastic state, and as it must  soon have hardened and assumed the condition in which it was  found, it is evident the skeletons had been buried after the flesh  was removed.    As additional evidence we may mention the fact that in stone  graves, so small that the body of a full-grown individual could  not by any possible means be pressed into them, the bones of adult  individuals are sometimes found. Instances of this kind have  occurred in Tennessee, Missouri, and southern Illinois.    From personal examination I conclude that most of the folded  skeletons found in mounds were buried after the flesh had been  removed, as the folding, to the extent noticed, could not possibly  have been done with the flesh on them, and the positions in most  cases were such that they could not have been assumed in  consequence of the decay of the flesh and settling of the mound.    The partial calcining of the bones in vaults and under layers of  clay where the evidence shows that the fire was applied to the  outside of the vault or above the clay layer, can be accounted for  only on the supposition that the flesh had been removed before  burial.    Other proofs that this custom prevailed among the mound builders  in various sections of the country might be adduced.    That it was the custom of a number of Indian tribes, when first  encountered by the whites, and even down to a comparatively modern  date, to remove the flesh before final burial by suspending on  scaffolds, depositing in charnel-houses, by temporary burial, or  otherwise, is well known to all students of Indian habits and  customs.    Heckewelder says, \"The Nanticokes had the singular custom of  removing the bones from the old burial place to a place of deposit  in the country they now dwell in.\" [Footnote: Hist. Manners and  Customs Ind. Nations, p. 75.]    The account by Breboeuf of the communal burial among the Hurons  heretofore referred to is well known. [Footnote: Jesuit Relations  for 1636. Transl. in Fifth Ann. Rept. Bur. Ethnol., p. 110.] The  same custom is alluded to by Lafitau. [Footnote: Moeurs des  Sauvages, vol. 2, pp. 420-435.] Bartram observed it among the  Choctaws. [Footnote: Travels, p. 516.] It is also mentioned by  Bossu, [Footnote: Travels through Louisiana, p. 298.] by  Adair,[Footnote: Hist. Am. Indians, p. 183.] by Barnard  Romans,[Footnote: Nat. Hist. Florida, p. 90.] and others.    Burial beneath or in dwellings.--The evidence brought to light by  the investigations of the Bureau of Ethnology, regarding a custom  among the mound-builders of Arkansas and Mississippi, of burying  in or under their dwellings, has been given, in part, in an  article published in the Magazine of American History. [Footnote:  February, 1884.] It is a well-attested historical fact that such  was also the custom of the southern Indian tribes. Bartram affirms  it to have been in vogue among the Muscogulgees or  Creeks,[Footnote: Travels, p. 505.] and Barnard Romans says it was  also practiced by the Chickasaws.[Footnote: Nat. Hist. Florida, p.  71] C C. Jones says that the Indians of Georgia \"often interred  beneath the floor of the cabin, and then burnt the hut of the  deceased over his head;\"[Footnote: Antiq. So. Indians, p. 203.]  which furnishes a complete explanation of the fact observed by the  Bureau explorers, mentioned in the article before alluded to.    Burial in a sitting or squatting posture.--It was a very common  practice among the mound-builders to bury their dead in a sitting  or squatting posture. The examples of this kind are too numerous  and too well known to require repetition. I may add that the yet  unpublished reports of the Bureau show that this custom prevailed  to a certain extent in Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, North Carolina,  Missouri, Ohio, and West Virginia. Instances have also been  observed elsewhere. [Footnote: Jones's Antiq. So. Indians (Georgia  and Florida). pp. 183-185.] That the same custom was followed by  several of the Indian tribes is attested by the following  authorities: Bossu, [Footnote: Travels, vol. 1, p. 251.] Lawson,  [Footnote: Hist. Carolina, p. 182.] Bartram, [Footnote: Travels,  p. 515.] and Adair.[Footnote: Hist. Am. Indians, p. 182.]    The use of fire in burial ceremonies.--Another observance in which  the burial customs of mound-builders corresponded with those of  Indians was the use of fire in funeral ceremonies. The evidences  of this custom are so common in mounds as to lead to the  supposition that the mound-builders were in the habit of offering  human sacrifices to their deities. Although charred and even  almost wholly consumed human bones are often found, showing that  bodies or skeletons were sometimes burned, it does not necessarily  follow that they were offered as"]]]
