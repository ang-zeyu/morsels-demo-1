He  looked back in time to see the trading-post, bleak and lonely on the  bare slope, pass out of sight behind the bluffs. Shefford felt no  fear--he really had little experience of physical fear--but it was  certain that he gritted his teeth and welcomed whatever was to come to  him. He had lived a narrow, insulated life with his mind on spiritual  things; his family and his congregation and his friends--except that  one new friend whose story had enthralled him--were people of quiet  religious habit; the man deep down in him had never had a chance. He  breathed hard as he tried to imagine the world opening to him, and  almost dared to be glad for the doubt that had sent him adrift.    The tracks of the Indian girl's pony were plain in the sand. Also there  were other tracks, not so plain, and these Shefford decided had been  made by Willetts and the girl the day before. He climbed a ridge, half  soft sand and half hard, and saw right before him, rising in striking  form, two great yellow buttes, like elephant legs. He rode between them,  amazed at their height. Then before him stretched a slowly ascending  valley, walled on one side by the black mesa and on the other by low  bluffs. For miles a dark-green growth of greasewood covered the valley,  and Shefford could see where the green thinned and failed, to give place  to sand. He trotted his horse and made good time on this stretch.    The day contrasted greatly with any he had yet experienced. Gray clouds  obscured the walls of rock a few miles to the west, and Shefford saw  squalls of snow like huge veils dropping down and spreading out. The  wind cut with the keenness of a knife. Soon he was chilled to the bone.  A squall swooped and roared down upon him, and the wind that bore the  driving white pellets of snow, almost like hail, was so freezing bitter  cold that the former wind seemed warm in comparison. The squall passed  as swiftly as it had come, and it left Shefford so benumbed he could not  hold the bridle. He tumbled off his horse and walked. By and by the sun  came out and soon warmed him and melted the thin layer of snow on the  sand. He was still on the trail of the Indian girl, but hers were now  the only tracks he could see.    All morning he gradually climbed, with limited view, until at last he  mounted to a point where the country lay open to his sight on all sides  except where the endless black mesa ranged on into the north. A rugged  yellow peak dominated the landscape to the fore, but it was far away.  Red and jagged country extended westward to a huge flat-topped wall of  gray rock. Lowering swift clouds swept across the sky, like drooping  mantles, and darkened the sun. Shefford built a little fire out of dead  greasewood sticks, and with his blanket round his shoulders he hung over  the blaze, scorching his clothes and hands. He had been cold before in  his life but he had never before appreciated fire. This desert blast  pierced him. The squall enveloped him, thicker and colder and windier  than the other, but, being better fortified, he did not suffer so much.  It howled away, hiding the mesa and leaving a white desert behind.  Shefford walked on, leading his horse, until the exercise and the sun  had once more warmed him.    This last squall had rendered the Indian girl's trail difficult to  follow. The snow did not quickly melt, and, besides, sheep tracks and  the tracks of horses gave him trouble, until at last he was compelled to  admit that he could not follow her any longer. A faint path or trail  led north, however, and, following that, he soon forgot the girl. Every  surmounted ridge held a surprise for him. The desert seemed never to  change in the vast whole that encompassed him, yet near him it was  always changing. From Red Lake he had seen a peaked, walled, and  canyoned country, as rough as a stormy sea; but when he rode into that  country the sharp and broken features held to the distance.    He was glad to get out of the sand. Long narrow flats, gray with grass  and dotted with patches of greasewood, and lined by low bare ridges of  yellow rock, stretched away from him, leading toward the yellow peak  that seemed never to be gained upon.    Shefford had pictures in his mind, pictures of stone walls and wild  valleys and domed buttes, all of which had been painted in colorful and  vivid words by his friend Venters. He believed he would recognize the  distinctive and remarkable landmarks Venters had portrayed, and he was  certain that he had not yet come upon one of them. This was his second  lonely day of travel and he had grown more and more susceptible to the  influence of horizon and the different prominent points. He attributed  a gradual change in his feelings to the loneliness and the increasing  wildness. Between Tuba and Flagstaff he had met Indians and an  occasional prospector and teamster. Here he was alone, and though he  felt some strange gladness, he could not help but see the difference.    He rode on during the gray, lowering, chilly day, and toward evening  the clouds broke in the west, and a setting sun shone through the  rift, burnishing the desert to red and gold. Shefford's instinctive  but deadened love of the beautiful in nature stirred into life, and the  moment of its rebirth was a melancholy and sweet one. Too late for the  artist's work, but not too late for his soul!    For a place to make camp he halted near a low area of rock that lay like  an island in a sea of grass. There was an abundance of dead greasewood  for a camp-fire, and, after searching over the rock, he found little  pools of melted snow in the depressions. He took off the saddle and  pack, watered his horse, and, hobbling him as well as his inexperience  permitted, he turned him loose on the grass.    Then while he built a fire and prepared a meal the night came down upon  him. In the lee of the rock he was well sheltered from the wind, but  the air, was bitter cold. He gathered all the dead greasewood in the  vicinity, replenished the fire, and rolled in his blanket, back to the  blaze. The loneliness and the coyotes did not bother him this night.  He was too tired and cold. He went to sleep at once and did not awaken  until the fire died out. Then he rebuilt it and went to sleep again.  Every half-hour all night long he repeated this, and was glad indeed  when the dawn broke.    The day began with misfortune. His horse was gone; it had been stolen,  or had worked out of sight, or had broken the hobbles and made off. From  a high stone ridge Shefford searched the grassy flats and slopes, all  to no purpose. Then he tried to track the horse, but this was equally  futile. He had expected disasters, and the first one did not daunt him.  He tied most of his pack in the blanket, threw the canteen across his  shoulder, and set forth, sure at least of one thing--that he was a very  much better traveler on foot than on horseback.    Walking did not afford him the leisure to study the surrounding country;  however, from time to time, when he surmounted a bench he scanned the  different landmarks that had grown familiar. It took hours of steady  walking to reach and pass the yellow peak that had been a kind of  goal. He saw many sheep trails and horse tracks in the vicinity of this  mountain, and once he was sure he espied an Indian watching him from a  bold ridge-top.    The day was bright and warm, with air so clear it magnified objects  he knew to be far away. The ascent was gradual; there were many narrow  flats connected by steps; and the grass grew thicker and longer. At noon  Shefford halted under the first cedar-tree, a lonely, dwarfed shrub that  seemed to have had a hard life. From this point the rise of ground was  more perceptible, and straggling cedars led the eye on to a purple slope  that merged into green of pinyon and pine. Could that purple be the  sage Venters had so feelingly described, or was it merely the purple of  deceiving distance? Whatever it might be, it gave Shefford a thrill and  made him think of the strange, shy, and lovely woman Venters had won out  here in this purple-sage country.    He calculated that he had ridden thirty miles the day before and had  already traveled ten miles today, and therefore could hope to be in the  pass before night. Shefford resumed his journey with too much energy and  enthusiasm to think of being tired. And he discovered presently that  the straggling cedars and the slope beyond were much closer than he  had judged them to be. He reached the sage to find it gray instead of  purple. Yet it was always purple a little way ahead, and if he half shut  his eyes it was purple near at hand. He was surprised to find that he  could not breathe freely, or it seemed so, and soon made the discovery  that the sweet, pungent, penetrating fragrance of sage and cedar had  this strange effect upon him. This was an exceedingly dry and odorous  forest, where every open space between the clumps of cedars was choked  with luxuriant sage. The pinyons were higher up on the mesa, and the  pines still higher. Shefford appeared to lose himself. There were no  trails; the black mesa on the right and the wall of stone on the left  could not be seen; but he pushed on with what was either singular  confidence or rash impulse. And he did not know whether that slope was  long or short. Once at the summit he saw with surprise that it broke  abruptly and the descent was very steep and short on that side. Through  the trees he once more saw the black mesa, rising to the dignity of a  mountain; and he had glimpses of another flat, narrow valley, this time  with a red wall running parallel with the mesa. He could not help but  hurry down to get an unobstructed view. His eagerness was rewarded by a  splendid scene, yet to his regret he could not force himself to believe  it had any relation to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5089"],[0,"Boris Godunov: a drama in verse (#4)"],[1," of a fasting man is he? Of his     own accord he attached himself as a companion to us;     no one knows who he is, no one knows whence he comes--     and yet he gives himself grand airs; perhaps he has a     close acquaintance with the pillory. (Drinks and sings:     \"A young monk took the tonsure,\" etc.)       GREGORY. (To HOSTESS.) Whither leads this road?       HOSTESS. To Lithuania, my dear, to the Luyov mountains.       GREGORY. And is it far to the Luyov mountains?       HOSTESS. Not far; you might get there by evening, but for     the tsar's frontier barriers, and the captains of the     guard.       GREGORY. What say you? Barriers! What means this?       HOSTESS. Someone has escaped from Moscow, and orders     have been given to detain and search everyone.       GREGORY. (Aside.) Here's a pretty mess!       VARLAAM. Hallo, comrade! You've been making up to     mine hostess. To be sure you don't want vodka, but     you want a young woman. All right, brother, all right!     Everyone has his own ways, and Father Missail and I     have only one thing which we care for--we drink to the     bottom, we drink; turn it upside down, and knock at     the bottom.       MISSAIL. Well said, Father Varlaam.       GREGORY. (To Hostess.) Whom do they want? Who     escaped from Moscow?       HOSTESS. God knows; a thief perhaps, a robber. But here     even good folk are worried now. And what will come of     it? Nothing. They will not catch the old devil; as if     there were no other road into Lithuania than the highway!     Just turn to the left from here, then by the pinewood     or by the footpath as far as the chapel on the     Chekansky brook, and then straight across the marsh to     Khlopin, and thence to Zakhariev, and then any child     will guide you to the Luyov mountains. The only good     of these inspectors is to worry passers-by and rob us poor     folk. (A noise is heard.) What's that? Ah, there     they are, curse them! They are going their rounds.       GREGORY. Hostess! Is there another room in the cottage?       HOSTESS. No, my dear; I should be glad myself to hide.     But they are only pretending to go their rounds; but     give them wine and bread, and Heaven knows what--     May perdition take them, the accursed ones! May--       (Enter OFFICERS.)       OFFICERS. Good health to you, mine hostess!       HOSTESS. You are kindly welcome, dear guests.       AN OFFICER. (To another.) Ha, there's drinking going on     here; we shall get something here. (To the Monks.)     Who are you?       VARLAAM. We--are two old clerics, humble monks; we are     going from village to village, and collecting Christian     alms for the monastery.       OFFICER. (To GREGORY.) And thou?       MISSAIL. Our comrade.       GREGORY. A layman from the suburb; I have conducted the     old men as far as the frontier; from here I am going to     my own home.       MISSAIL. So you have changed your mind?       GREGORY. (Sotto voce.) Be silent.       OFFICER. Hostess, bring some more wine, and we will     drink here a little and talk a little with these old men.       2ND OFFICER. (Sotto voce.) Yon lad, it appears, is poor;     there's nothing to be got out of him; on the other hand     the old men--       1ST OFFICER. Be silent; we shall come to them presently.     --Well, my fathers, how are you getting on?       VARLAAM. Badly, my sons, badly! The Christians have     now turned stingy; they love their money; they hide     their money. They give little to God. The people of     the world have become great sinners. They have all     devoted themselves to commerce, to earthly cares; they     think of worldly wealth, not of the salvation of the soul.     You walk and walk; you beg and beg; sometimes in     three days begging will not bring you three half-pence.     What a sin! A week goes by; another week; you look     into your bag, and there is so little in it that you are     ashamed to show yourself at the monastery. What are     you to do? From very sorrow you drink away what is     left; a real calamity! Ah, it is bad! It seems our last     days have come--       HOSTESS. (Weeps.) God pardon and save you!     (During the course of VARLAAM'S speech the 1st     OFFICER watches MISSAIL significantly.)       1ST OFFICER. Alexis! Have you the tsar's edict with you?       2ND OFFICER. I have it.       1ST OFFICER. Give it here.       MISSAIL. Why do you look at me so fixedly?       1ST OFFICER. This is why; from Moscow there has fled a     certain wicked heretic--Grishka Otrepiev. Have you     heard this?       MISSAIL. I have not heard it.       OFFICER. Not heard it? Very good. And the tsar has     ordered to arrest and hang the fugitive heretic. Do you     know this?       MISSAIL. I do not know it.       OFFICER. (To VARLAAM.) Do you know how to read?       VARLAAM. In my youth I knew how, but I have forgotten.       OFFICER. (To MISSAIL.) And thou?       MISSAIL. God has not made me wise.       OFFICER. So then here's the tsar's edict.       MISSAIL. What do I want it for?       OFFICER. It seems to me that this fugitive heretic, thief,     swindler, is--thou.       MISSAIL. I? Good gracious! What are you talking about?       OFFICER. Stay! Hold the doors. Then we shall soon get     at the truth.       HOSTESS. O the cursed tormentors! Not to leave even the     old man in peace!       OFFICER. Which of you here is a scholar?       GREGORY. (Comes forward.) I am a scholar!       OFFICER. Oh, indeed! And from whom did you learn?       GREGORY. From our sacristan.       OFFICER (Gives him the edict.) Read it aloud.       GREGORY. (Reads.) \"An unworthy monk of the Monastery     Of Chudov, Gregory, of the family of Otrepiev, has fallen     into heresy, taught by the devil, and has dared to vex     the holy brotherhood by all kinds of iniquities and acts     of lawlessness. And, according to information, it has     been shown that he, the accursed Grishka, has fled to the     Lithuanian frontier.\"       OFFICER. (To MISSAIL.) How can it be anyone but you?       GREGORY. \"And the tsar has commanded to arrest him--\"       OFFICER. And to hang!       GREGORY. It does not say here \"to hang.\"       OFFICER. Thou liest. What is meant is not always put into     writing. Read: to arrest and to hang.       GREGORY. \"And to hang. And the age of the thief     Grishka\" (looking at VARLAAM) \"about fifty, and his     height medium; he has a bald head, grey beard, fat     belly.\"       (All glance at VARLAAM.)       1ST OFFICER, My lads! Here is Grishka! Hold him!     Bind him! I never thought to catch him so quickly.       VARLAAM. (Snatching the paper.) Hands off, my lads!     What sort of a Grishka am I? What! Fifty years old,     grey beard, fat belly! No, brother. You're too young     to play off tricks on me. I have not read for a long time     and I make it out badly, but I shall manage to make it     out, as it's a hanging matter. (Spells it out.) \"And his     age twenty.\" Why, brother, where does it say fifty?--     Do you see--twenty?       2ND OFFICER. Yes, I remember, twenty; even so it was     told us.       1ST OFFICER. (To GREGORY.) Then, evidently, you like a     joke, brother.       (During the reading GREGORY stands with downcast     head, and his hand in his breast.)       VARLAAM. (Continues.) \"And in stature he is small, chest     broad, one arm shorter than the other, blue eyes, red     hair, a wart on his cheek, another on his forehead.\"     Then is it not you, my friend?       (GREGORY suddenly draws a dagger; all give way     before him; he dashes through the window.)       OFFICERS. Hold him! Hold him!       (All run out in disorder.)          MOSCOW. SHUISKY'S HOUSE    SHUISKY. A number of Guests. Supper       SHUISKY. More wine! Now, my dear guests.       (He rises; all rise after him.)                             The final draught!     Read the prayer, boy.       Boy.                Lord of the heavens, Who art     Eternally and everywhere, accept     The prayer of us Thy servants. For our monarch,     By Thee appointed, for our pious tsar,     Of all good Christians autocrat, we pray.     Preserve him in the palace, on the field     Of battle, on his nightly couch; grant to him     Victory o'er his foes; from sea to sea     May he be glorified; may all his house     Blossom with health, and may its precious branches     O'ershadow all the earth; to us, his slaves,     May he, as heretofore, be generous.     Gracious, long-suffering, and may the founts     Of his unfailing wisdom flow upon us;     Raising the royal cup, Lord of the heavens,     For this we pray.       SHUISKY. (Drinks.) Long live our mighty sovereign!     Farewell, dear guests. I thank you that ye scorned not     My bread and salt. Farewell; good-night.       (Exeunt Guests: he conducts them to the door.)       PUSHKIN. Hardly could they tear themselves away; indeed,     Prince Vassily Ivanovitch, I began to think that we     should not succeed in getting any private talk.       SHUISKY. (To the Servants.) You there, why do you stand     Gaping? Always eavesdropping on gentlemen! Clear     the table, and then be off.       (Exeunt Servants.)                                 What is it, Athanasius     Mikailovitch?       PUSHKIN.    Such a wondrous thing!     A message was sent here to me today     From Cracow by my nephew Gabriel Pushkin.       SHUISKY. Well?       PUSHKIN. 'Tis strange news my nephew writes. The son     Of the Terrible--But stay--       (Goes to the door and examines it.)                                 The royal boy,     Who murdered was by order of Boris--       SHUISKY. But these are no new tidings.       PUSHKIN.                        Wait a little;     Dimitry lives.       SHUISKY.     So that's it! News indeed!     Dimitry living!--Really marvelous!     And is that all?       PUSHKIN.       Pray listen to the end;     Whoe'er he be, whether he be Dimitry     Rescued, or else some spirit in his shape,     Some daring rogue,"]]]
