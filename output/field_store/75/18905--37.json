I will detain you, sir, no longer. Indeed I have run into a preface,  while I professed to write a dedication. But how can it be otherwise?  I dare not praise you; and the only means I know of to avoid it, when  you are in my thoughts, are either to be entirely silent, or to turn  my thoughts to some other subject.    Pardon, therefore, what I have said in this epistle, not only without  your consent, but absolutely against it; and give me at least leave,  in this public manner, to declare that I am, with the highest respect  and gratitude,--    Sir,    Your most obliged,    Obedient, humble servant,    HENRY FIELDING.            THE HISTORY OF TOM JONES, A FOUNDLING.          BOOK I.    CONTAINING AS MUCH OF THE BIRTH OF THE FOUNDLING AS IS NECESSARY OR  PROPER TO ACQUAINT THE READER WITH IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS HISTORY.        Chapter i.    The introduction to the work, or bill of fare to the feast.      An author ought to consider himself, not as a gentleman who gives a  private or eleemosynary treat, but rather as one who keeps a public  ordinary, at which all persons are welcome for their money. In the  former case, it is well known that the entertainer provides what fare  he pleases; and though this should be very indifferent, and utterly  disagreeable to the taste of his company, they must not find any  fault; nay, on the contrary, good breeding forces them outwardly to  approve and to commend whatever is set before them. Now the contrary  of this happens to the master of an ordinary. Men who pay for what  they eat will insist on gratifying their palates, however nice and  whimsical these may prove; and if everything is not agreeable to their  taste, will challenge a right to censure, to abuse, and to d--n their  dinner without controul.    To prevent, therefore, giving offence to their customers by any such  disappointment, it hath been usual with the honest and well-meaning  host to provide a bill of fare which all persons may peruse at their  first entrance into the house; and having thence acquainted themselves  with the entertainment which they may expect, may either stay and  regale with what is provided for them, or may depart to some other  ordinary better accommodated to their taste.    As we do not disdain to borrow wit or wisdom from any man who is  capable of lending us either, we have condescended to take a hint from  these honest victuallers, and shall prefix not only a general bill of  fare to our whole entertainment, but shall likewise give the reader  particular bills to every course which is to be served up in this and  the ensuing volumes.    The provision, then, which we have here made is no other than _Human  Nature_. Nor do I fear that my sensible reader, though most luxurious  in his taste, will start, cavil, or be offended, because I have named  but one article. The tortoise--as the alderman of Bristol, well  learned in eating, knows by much experience--besides the delicious  calipash and calipee, contains many different kinds of food; nor can  the learned reader be ignorant, that in human nature, though here  collected under one general name, is such prodigious variety, that a  cook will have sooner gone through all the several species of animal  and vegetable food in the world, than an author will be able to  exhaust so extensive a subject.    An objection may perhaps be apprehended from the more delicate, that  this dish is too common and vulgar; for what else is the subject of  all the romances, novels, plays, and poems, with which the stalls  abound? Many exquisite viands might be rejected by the epicure, if it  was a sufficient cause for his contemning of them as common and  vulgar, that something was to be found in the most paltry alleys under  the same name. In reality, true nature is as difficult to be met with  in authors, as the Bayonne ham, or Bologna sausage, is to be found in  the shops.    But the whole, to continue the same metaphor, consists in the cookery  of the author; for, as Mr Pope tells us--        \"True wit is nature to advantage drest;      What oft was thought, but ne'er so well exprest.\"    The same animal which hath the honour to have some part of his flesh  eaten at the table of a duke, may perhaps be degraded in another part,  and some of his limbs gibbeted, as it were, in the vilest stall in  town. Where, then, lies the difference between the food of the  nobleman and the porter, if both are at dinner on the same ox or calf,  but in the seasoning, the dressing, the garnishing, and the setting  forth? Hence the one provokes and incites the most languid appetite,  and the other turns and palls that which is the sharpest and keenest.    In like manner, the excellence of the mental entertainment consists  less in the subject than in the author's skill in well dressing it up.  How pleased, therefore, will the reader be to find that we have, in  the following work, adhered closely to one of the highest principles  of the best cook which the present age, or perhaps that of  Heliogabalus, hath produced. This great man, as is well known to all  lovers of polite eating, begins at first by setting plain things  before his hungry guests, rising afterwards by degrees as their  stomachs may be supposed to decrease, to the very quintessence of  sauce and spices. In like manner, we shall represent human nature at  first to the keen appetite of our reader, in that more plain and  simple manner in which it is found in the country, and shall hereafter  hash and ragoo it with all the high French and Italian seasoning of  affectation and vice which courts and cities afford. By these means,  we doubt not but our reader may be rendered desirous to read on for  ever, as the great person just above-mentioned is supposed to have  made some persons eat.    Having premised thus much, we will now detain those who like our bill  of fare no longer from their diet, and shall proceed directly to serve  up the first course of our history for their entertainment.        Chapter ii.    A short description of squire Allworthy, and a fuller account of Miss  Bridget Allworthy, his sister.      In that part of the western division of this kingdom which is commonly  called Somersetshire, there lately lived, and perhaps lives still, a  gentleman whose name was Allworthy, and who might well be called the  favourite of both nature and fortune; for both of these seem to have  contended which should bless and enrich him most. In this contention,  nature may seem to some to have come off victorious, as she bestowed  on him many gifts, while fortune had only one gift in her power; but  in pouring forth this, she was so very profuse, that others perhaps  may think this single endowment to have been more than equivalent to  all the various blessings which he enjoyed from nature. From the  former of these, he derived an agreeable person, a sound constitution,  a solid understanding, and a benevolent heart; by the latter, he was  decreed to the inheritance of one of the largest estates in the  county.    This gentleman had in his youth married a very worthy and beautiful  woman, of whom he had been extremely fond: by her he had three  children, all of whom died in their infancy. He had likewise had the  misfortune of burying this beloved wife herself, about five years  before the time in which this history chuses to set out. This loss,  however great, he bore like a man of sense and constancy, though it  must be confest he would often talk a little whimsically on this head;  for he sometimes said he looked on himself as still married, and  considered his wife as only gone a little before him, a journey which  he should most certainly, sooner or later, take after her; and that he  had not the least doubt of meeting her again in a place where he  should never part with her more--sentiments for which his sense was  arraigned by one part of his neighbours, his religion by a second, and  his sincerity by a third.    He now lived, for the most part, retired in the country, with one  sister, for whom he had a very tender affection. This lady was now  somewhat past the age of thirty, an aera at which, in the opinion of  the malicious, the title of old maid may with no impropriety be  assumed. She was of that species of women whom you commend rather for  good qualities than beauty, and who are generally called, by their own  sex, very good sort of women--as good a sort of woman, madam, as you  would wish to know. Indeed, she was so far from regretting want of  beauty, that she never mentioned that perfection, if it can be called  one, without contempt; and would often thank God she was not as  handsome as Miss Such-a-one, whom perhaps beauty had led into errors  which she might have otherwise avoided. Miss Bridget Allworthy (for  that was the name of this lady) very rightly conceived the charms of  person in a woman to be no better than snares for herself, as well as  for others; and yet so discreet was she in her conduct, that her  prudence was as much on the guard as if she had all the snares to  apprehend which were ever laid for her whole sex. Indeed, I have  observed, though it may seem unaccountable to the reader, that this  guard of prudence, like the trained bands, is always readiest to go on  duty where there is the least danger. It often basely and cowardly  deserts those paragons for whom the men are all wishing, sighing,  dying, and spreading every net in their power; and constantly attends  at the heels of that higher order of women for whom the other sex have  a more distant and awful respect, and whom (from despair, I suppose,  of success) they never venture to attack.    Reader, I think proper, before we proceed any farther together, to  acquaint thee that I intend to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6603"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage : 600-1776 King Aethelbert - King George III (#4)"],[1," a bot of 25 shillings.
