[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/852"],[0,"Democracy and Education: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education (#4)"],[1,"are in outer action rather than in  mental and emotional dispositions of behavior. The distinction is not,  however, a sharp one. The child might conceivably generate in time a  violent antipathy, not only to that particular toy, but to the class  of toys resembling it. The aversion might even persist after he had  forgotten about the original burns; later on he might even invent some  reason to account for his seemingly irrational antipathy. In some cases,  altering the external habit of action by changing the environment to  affect the stimuli to action will also alter the mental disposition  concerned in the action. Yet this does not always happen; a person  trained to dodge a threatening blow, dodges automatically with  no corresponding thought or emotion. We have to find, then, some  differentia of training from education.    A clew may be found in the fact that the horse does not really share in  the social use to which his action is put. Some one else uses the horse  to secure a result which is advantageous by making it advantageous  to the horse to perform the act--he gets food, etc. But the horse,  presumably, does not get any new interest. He remains interested in  food, not in the service he is rendering. He is not a partner in a  shared activity. Were he to become a copartner, he would, in engaging  in the conjoint activity, have the same interest in its accomplishment  which others have. He would share their ideas and emotions.    Now in many cases--too many cases--the activity of the immature human  being is simply played upon to secure habits which are useful. He is  trained like an animal rather than educated like a human being. His  instincts remain attached to their original objects of pain or pleasure.  But to get happiness or to avoid the pain of failure he has to act in  a way agreeable to others. In other cases, he really shares or  participates in the common activity. In this case, his original impulse  is modified. He not merely acts in a way agreeing with the actions of  others, but, in so acting, the same ideas and emotions are aroused  in him that animate the others. A tribe, let us say, is warlike. The  successes for which it strives, the achievements upon which it sets  store, are connected with fighting and victory. The presence of this  medium incites bellicose exhibitions in a boy, first in games, then  in fact when he is strong enough. As he fights he wins approval and  advancement; as he refrains, he is disliked, ridiculed, shut out  from favorable recognition. It is not surprising that his original  belligerent tendencies and emotions are strengthened at the expense of  others, and that his ideas turn to things connected with war. Only in  this way can he become fully a recognized member of his group. Thus his  mental habitudes are gradually assimilated to those of his group.    If we formulate the principle involved in this illustration, we shall  perceive that the social medium neither implants certain desires and  ideas directly, nor yet merely establishes certain purely muscular  habits of action, like \"instinctively\" winking or dodging a blow.  Setting up conditions which stimulate certain visible and tangible ways  of acting is the first step. Making the individual a sharer or partner  in the associated activity so that he feels its success as his success,  its failure as his failure, is the completing step. As soon as he is  possessed by the emotional attitude of the group, he will be alert to  recognize the special ends at which it aims and the means employed to  secure success. His beliefs and ideas, in other words, will take a form  similar to those of others in the group. He will also achieve pretty  much the same stock of knowledge since that knowledge is an ingredient  of his habitual pursuits.    The importance of language in gaining knowledge is doubtless the chief  cause of the common notion that knowledge may be passed directly from  one to another. It almost seems as if all we have to do to convey an  idea into the mind of another is to convey a sound into his ear. Thus  imparting knowledge gets assimilated to a purely physical process. But  learning from language will be found, when analyzed, to confirm the  principle just laid down. It would probably be admitted with little  hesitation that a child gets the idea of, say, a hat by using it as  other persons do; by covering the head with it, giving it to others  to wear, having it put on by others when going out, etc. But it may be  asked how this principle of shared activity applies to getting through  speech or reading the idea of, say, a Greek helmet, where no direct use  of any kind enters in. What shared activity is there in learning from  books about the discovery of America?    Since language tends to become the chief instrument of learning about  many things, let us see how it works. The baby begins of course with  mere sounds, noises, and tones having no meaning, expressing, that is,  no idea. Sounds are just one kind of stimulus to direct response, some  having a soothing effect, others tending to make one jump, and so on.  The sound h-a-t would remain as meaningless as a sound in Choctaw, a  seemingly inarticulate grunt, if it were not uttered in connection  with an action which is participated in by a number of people. When the  mother is taking the infant out of doors, she says \"hat\" as she puts  something on the baby's head. Being taken out becomes an interest to the  child; mother and child not only go out with each other physically,  but both are concerned in the going out; they enjoy it in common. By  conjunction with the other factors in activity the sound \"hat\" soon gets  the same meaning for the child that it has for the parent; it becomes a  sign of the activity into which it enters. The bare fact that language  consists of sounds which are mutually intelligible is enough of  itself to show that its meaning depends upon connection with a shared  experience.    In short, the sound h-a-t gains meaning in precisely the same way that  the thing \"hat\" gains it, by being used in a given way. And they acquire  the same meaning with the child which they have with the adult because  they are used in a common experience by both. The guarantee for the  same manner of use is found in the fact that the thing and the sound are  first employed in a joint activity, as a means of setting up an active  connection between the child and a grownup. Similar ideas or meanings  spring up because both persons are engaged as partners in an action  where what each does depends upon and influences what the other does. If  two savages were engaged in a joint hunt for game, and a certain signal  meant \"move to the right\" to the one who uttered it, and \"move to the  left\" to the one who heard it, they obviously could not successfully  carry on their hunt together. Understanding one another means that  objects, including sounds, have the same value for both with respect to  carrying on a common pursuit.    After sounds have got meaning through connection with other things  employed in a joint undertaking, they can be used in connection with  other like sounds to develop new meanings, precisely as the things for  which they stand are combined. Thus the words in which a child  learns about, say, the Greek helmet originally got a meaning (or were  understood) by use in an action having a common interest and end. They  now arouse a new meaning by inciting the one who hears or reads to  rehearse imaginatively the activities in which the helmet has its use.  For the time being, the one who understands the words \"Greek helmet\"  becomes mentally a partner with those who used the helmet. He engages,  through his imagination, in a shared activity. It is not easy to get  the full meaning of words. Most persons probably stop with the idea that  \"helmet\" denotes a queer kind of headgear a people called the Greeks  once wore. We conclude, accordingly, that the use of language to convey  and acquire ideas is an extension and refinement of the principle  that things gain meaning by being used in a shared experience or joint  action; in no sense does it contravene that principle. When words do  not enter as factors into a shared situation, either overtly or  imaginatively, they operate as pure physical stimuli, not as having  a meaning or intellectual value. They set activity running in a given  groove, but there is no accompanying conscious purpose or meaning.  Thus, for example, the plus sign may be a stimulus to perform the act of  writing one number under another and adding the numbers, but the person  performing the act will operate much as an automaton would unless he  realizes the meaning of what he does.    3. The Social Medium as Educative. Our net result thus far is that  social environment forms the mental and emotional disposition of  behavior in individuals by engaging them in activities that arouse  and strengthen certain impulses, that have certain purposes and entail  certain consequences. A child growing up in a family of musicians will  inevitably have whatever capacities he has in music stimulated, and,  relatively, stimulated more than other impulses which might have been  awakened in another environment. Save as he takes an interest in music  and gains a certain competency in it, he is \"out of it\"; he is unable  to share in the life of the group to which he belongs. Some kinds of  participation in the life of those with whom the individual is connected  are inevitable; with respect to them, the social environment exercises  an educative or formative influence unconsciously and apart from any set  purpose.    In savage and barbarian communities, such direct participation  (constituting the indirect or incidental education of which we have  spoken) furnishes almost the sole influence for rearing the young into  the practices and beliefs of the group. Even in present-day societies,  it furnishes the basic nurture "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8537"],[0,"Lonesome Land (#4)"],[1," marched Kent. He went into the office--which was really a saloon--invited  Hawley to drink with him, and then wondered audibly if he could beg some  pie from Mrs. Hawley.    \"Supper'll be ready in a few minutes,\" Hawley informed him, glancing up at  the round, dust-covered clock screwed to the wall.    \"I don't want supper--I want pie,\" Kent retorted, and opened a door which  led into the hallway. He went down the narrow passage to another door,  opened it without ceremony, and was assailed by the odor of many  things--the odor which spoke plainly of supper, or some other assortment of  food. No one was in sight, so he entered the dining room boldly, stepped to  another door, tapped very lightly upon it, and went in. By this somewhat  roundabout method he invaded the parlor.    Manley Fleetwood was lying upon an extremely uncomfortable couch, of the  kind which is called a sofa. He had a lace-edged handkerchief folded upon  his brow, and upon his face was an expression of conscious unworthiness  which struck Kent as being extremely humorous. He grinned understandingly  and Manley flushed--also understandingly. Valeria hastily released Manley's  hand and looked very prim and a bit haughty, as she regarded the intruder  from the red plush chair, pulled close to the couch.    \"Mr. Fleetwood's head is very bad yet,\" she informed Kent coldly. \"I really  do not think he ought to see--anybody.\"    Kent tapped his hat gently against his leg and faced her unflinchingly,  quite unconscious of the fact that she regarded him as a dissolute, drunken  cowboy with whom Manley ought not to associate.    \"That's too bad.\" His eyes failed to drop guiltily before hers, but  continued to regard her calmly. \"I'm only going to stay a minute. I came to  tell you that there's a scheme to raise--to 'shivaree' you two, tonight. I  thought you might want to pull out, along about dark.\"    Manley looked up at him inquiringly with the eye which was not covered by  the lace-edged handkerchief. Valeria seemed startled, just at first. Then  she gave Kent a little shock of surprise.    \"I have read about such things. A _charivari_, even out here in this  uncivilized section of the country, can hardly be dangerous. I really do  not think we care to run away, thank you.\" Her lip curled unmistakably.  \"Mr. Fleetwood is suffering from a sick headache. He needs rest--not a  cowardly night ride.\"    Naturally Kent admired the spirit she showed, in spite of that eloquent  lip, the scorn of which seemed aimed directly at him. But he still faced  her steadily.    \"Sure. But if I had a headache--like that--I'd certainly burn the earth  getting outa town to-night. _Shivarees_\"--he stuck stubbornly to his own  way of saying it--\"are bad for the head. They aren't what you could call  silent--not out here in this uncivilized section of the country. They're  plumb--\" He hesitated for just a fraction of a second, and his resentment  of her tone melted into a twinkle of the eyes. \"They've got fifty coal-oil  cans strung with irons on a rope, and there'll be about ninety-five  six-shooters popping, and eight or ten horse-fiddles, and they'll all be  yelling to beat four of a kind. They're going,\" he said quite gravely, \"to  play the full orchestra. And I don't believe,\" he added ironically, \"it's  going to help Mr. Fleetwood's head any.\"    Valeria looked at him doubtingly with steady, amber-colored eyes before she  turned solicitously to readjust the lace-edged handkerchief. Kent seized  the opportunity to stare fixedly at Fleetwood and jerk his head meaningly  backward, but when, warned by Manley's changing expression, she glanced  suspiciously over her shoulder, Kent was standing quietly by the door with  his hat in his hand, gazing absently at Walt in his gilt-edged frame upon  the gilt easel, and waiting, evidently, for their decision.    \"I shall tell them that Mr. Fleetwood is sick--that he has a horrible  headache, and mustn't be disturbed.\"    Kent forgot himself so far as to cough slightly behind his hand. Valeria's  eyes sparkled.    \"Even out here,\" she went on cuttingly, \"there must be some men who are  gentlemen!\"    Kent refrained from looking at her, but the blood crept darkly into his  tanned cheeks. Evidently she \"had it in for him,\" but he could not see why.  He wondered swiftly if she blamed him for Manley's condition.    Fleetwood suddenly sat up, spilling the handkerchief to the floor. When  Valeria essayed to push him back he put her hand gently away. He rose and  came over to Kent.    \"Is this straight goods?\" he demanded. \"Why don't you stop it?\"    \"Fred De Garmo's running this show. My influence wouldn't go as far--\"    Fleetwood turned to the girl, and his manner was masterful. \"I'm going out  with Kent--oh, Val, this is Mr. Burnett. Kent, Miss Peyson. I forgot you  two aren't acquainted.\"    From Valeria's manner, they were in no danger of becoming friends. Her  acknowledgment was barely perceptible. Kent bowed stiffly.    \"I'm going to see about this, Val,\" continued Fleetwood. \"Oh, my head's  better--a lot better, really. Maybe we'd better leave town--\"    \"If your head is better, I don't see why we need run away from a lot of  silly noise,\" Valeria interposed, with merciless logic. \"They'll think  we're awful cowards.\"    \"Well, I'll try and find out--I won't be gone a minute, dear.\" After that  word, spoken before another, he appeared to be in great haste, and pushed  Kent rather unceremoniously through the door. In the dining room, Kent  diplomatically included the landlady in the conference, by a gesture of  much mystery bringing her in from the kitchen, where she had been curiously  peeping out at them.    \"Got to let her in,\" he whispered to Manley, \"to keep her face closed.\"    They murmured together for five minutes. Kent seemed to meet with some  opposition from Fleetwood--an aftermath of Valeria's objections to  flight--and became brutally direct.    \"Go ahead--do as you please,\" he said roughly. \"But you know that bunch.  You'll have to show up, and you'll have to set 'em up, and--aw, thunder!  By morning you'll be plumb laid out. You'll be headed into one of your  four-day jags, and you know it. I was thinking of the girl--but if you  don't care, I guess it's none of my funeral. Go to it--but darned if I'd  want to start my honeymoon out like that!\"    Fleetwood weakened, but still he hesitated. \"If I didn't show up--\" he  began hopefully. But Kent wittered him with a look.    \"That bunch will be two-thirds full before they start out. If you don't  show up, they'll go up and haul you outa bed--hell, Man! You'd likely start  in to kill somebody off. Fred De Garmo don't love you much better than he  loves me. You know what him and his friends would do then, I should think.\"  He stopped, and seemed to consider briefly a plan, but shook his head  over it. \"I could round up a bunch and stand 'em off, maybe--but we'd be  shooting each other up, first rattle of the box. It's a whole lot easier  for you to get outa town.\"    \"I'll tell somebody you got the bridal chamber,\" hissed Arline, in a very  loud whisper. \"That's number two, in front. I can keep a light going and  pass back 'n' forth once in a while, to look like you're there. That'll  fool 'em good. They'll wait till the light's been out quite a while before  they start in. You go ahead and git married at seven, jest as you was going  to--and if Kent'll have the team ready somewheres, I can easy sneak you out  the back way.\"    \"I couldn't get the team out of town without giving the whole deal away,\"  Kent objected. \"You'll have to go horseback.\".    \"Val can't ride,\" Fleetwood stated, as if that settled the matter.    \"Damn it, she's got to ride!\" snapped Kent, losing patience. \"Unless you  want to stay and go on a toot that'll last a week, most likely.\"    \"Val belongs to the W.C.T.U.,\" shrugged Fleetwood. \"She'd never--\"    \"Well, it's that or have a fight on your hands you maybe can't handle. I  don't see any sense in haggling about going, now you know what to expect.  But, of course,\" he added, with some acrimony, \"it's your own business. I  don't know what the dickens I'm getting all worked up over it for. Suit  yourself.\" He turned toward the door.    \"She could ride my Mollie--and I got a sidesaddle hanging up in the coal  shed. She could use that, or a stock saddle, either one,\" planned Mrs.  Hawley anxiously. \"You better pull out, Man.\"    \"Hold on, Kent! Don't rush off--we'll go,\" Fleetwood surrendered. \"Val  won't like it, but I'll explain as well as I can, without--Say! you stay  and see us married, won't you? It's at seven, and--\"    Kent's fingers curled around the doorknob. \"No, thanks. Weddings and  funerals are two bunches of trouble I always ride 'way around. Time enough  when you've got to be _it_. Along about nine o'clock you try and get out to  the stockyards without letting the whole town see you go, and I'll have the  horses there; just beyond the wings, by that pile of ties. You know the  place. I'll wait there till ten, and not a minute longer. That'll give you  an hour, and you won't need any more time than that if you get down to  business. You find out from her what saddle she wants, and you can tell me  while I'm eating supper, Mrs. Hawley. I'll 'tend to the rest.\" He did not  wait to hear whether they agreed to the plan, but went moodily down the  narrow passage, and entered frowningly the \"office.\" Several men were  gathered there, waiting the supper summons. Hawley glanced up from wiping a  glass, and grinned.    \"Well, did you git the pie?\"    \"Naw. She said I'd got to wait for mealtime. She plumb chased me out.\"    Fred De Garmo, sprawled in an armchair and smoking a cigar, lazily fanned  the smoke cloud from before his face and looked at Kent attentively.          CHAPTER III.
