At present, then, I must regard myself solely as a  French noble, for Villeroy has passed into the hands of France, just as  for a while it passed into the hands of England, and if this war goes on  we shall have to take a side.\"    \"And to which side do your thoughts incline, Sir Eustace, if I may ask  you?\"    \"I love not either side, Guy, and would fain, if it could be so, that my  sword should remain in its sheath. I fear that I shall have to go with  Burgundy, for he is all-powerful in Artois; but had I been altogether free  to choose, I should have sided with Orleans. In the first place, it is  certain that the last duke was foully murdered by Burgundy, who thereby  laid the foundation for the present troubles. There were jealousies  before, as there have always been between the great nobles, but that act  forced almost all to take sides. The Dukes of Berri and Brittany, who had  been of the party of the late Duke of Burgundy, were driven by this foul  act of his son to range themselves with Orleans. Armagnac is very powerful  in the south, Berri's dukedom is in the north, that of Orleans to the  north-east. Burgundy's strength lies in his own dukedom,--which has ever  been all but independent of France,--in Flanders, in Artois, and in Paris;  thus, generally, it is the north and east of France against the south and  west. This is broadly the case, but in a civil war provinces and  countships, neighbours, ay, and families, become split up into factions,  as interest, or family ties, or the desire to increase an estate by  annexing another next to it, may influence the minds of men.    \"So long as it is but a war between the great dukes and princes of France  we smaller men may hope to hold aloof, but, as it goes on, and evil deeds  are done on both sides, men's passions become heated, the spirit spreads  until every man's hand is against his neighbour, and he who joins not  against one or the other finds both ready to oppress and rob him. I should  not have cared to bring out an English following with me had we been  forced to march any distance through France; but as Villeroy is but a few  miles from the frontier, and of that distance well-nigh half is through my  own estates, we can reach the castle almost unnoticed. Once there, the  fact that I have strengthened my garrison will keep me from attack, for  either party would be chary in attacking one who can defend himself  stoutly. I was minded to leave your lady and the two younger children in  England, but in truth she begged so hard to accompany me that I could not  say her nay.\"    The Castle of Villeroy was somewhat larger than the one in which Guy had  been born and brought up. The plan, however, was very similar: there was  the central keep, but, whereas at home this was the dwelling-house of the  family, it was here used as a storehouse, and the apartments of the count  and countess were in the range of buildings that formed an inner court  round the keep. In point of luxury the French were in advance of the  English, and they had already begun to combine comfort with strength in  their buildings. The apartments struck Guy as being wonderfully spacious  in comparison to those with which he was accustomed. On the ground floor  of one side of the square was the banqueting-hall. Its walls were  decorated with arms and armour, the joists that supported the floor above  were carved, the windows large and spacious, for, looking as they did into  the inner court, there was no occasion for their being mere loopholes.  Above the banqueting-hall was a room where Lady Margaret sat with her  maids engaged in working at tapestry; here the priest gave such slight  instruction as was then considered necessary to Agnes and Charles; Henry  had already passed out of his hands.    Next to this room was the knight's sleeping apartment, or closet as it was  then called, a room which would now be considered of ridiculously  straitened dimensions; and close to it were the still smaller closets of  the children. Beyond were a series of guest-chambers. Another side of the  court-yard contained the apartments of the castellan, Jean Bouvard, a  sturdy soldier of long experience, and those of the other officers of the  household; the other two sides were occupied by the chapel, the kitchens,  and the offices of the servants and retainers. All these rooms were  loopholed on the side looking into the outer court. This was considerably  wider and more extensive than the one surrounding the keep. Here were the  stables, storehouses for grain and forage, and a building, just erected,  for the lodging of the English garrison. All these buildings stood against  the outer wall, so that they would afford no shelter to an enemy who had  obtained possession of the first defences and was making an attack against  the second line. The outer wall was twelve feet in thickness, and thirty  feet above the court; outside the height was considerably greater, as  there was a moat faced with stone fifteen feet deep entirely surrounding  it, and containing seven or eight feet of water.    Walls ran half across the outer court, and, from the end of these, light  wooden bridges formed a communication with the wall of the inner court, so  that in the event of the outer wall being stormed or the gates being  carried by assault, the defenders could retire to the inner defences. The  ends of these bridges rested upon irons projecting from the wall, and so  arranged that they could be instantly withdrawn when the last of the  defenders had crossed over, when the bridges would at once fall into the  court-yard below. The inner wall was twelve feet higher than the outer  one, and, like it, was provided with a crenellated battlement four feet  high; there were projecting turrets at each corner, and one in the middle  of each side.    The keep rose twenty feet higher than the wall of the inner court. The  lower portions of the cross walls of the outer court were carried on as  far as the inner wall, thereby dividing the space into four; strong gates  gave communication from one to the other. Into these could be driven the  cattle of the tenantry, and one of them contained a number of huts in  which the tenants themselves would be lodged. The court-yard facing the  entrance was the largest of the areas into which the space between the  outer and inner walls was divided, extending the whole width between the  outer walls. Here the military exercises were carried on. Along the wall,  at each side of the gate, were a range of stables for the use of the  horses of guests, with rooms over them for the use of their retainers.  There was a strong exterior work defending the approach to the drawbridge  on the other side of the moat, and in all respects the castle was well  appointed, and to Guy it seemed almost impossible that it could be carried  by assault, however numerous the foe.          CHAPTER II -- TROUBLES IN FRANCE      As soon as it was heard that the lord and lady had returned, the vassals  of Villeroy came in to pay their respects, and presents of fowls, game,  and provisions of all kinds poured in. The table in the banqueting-hall  was bountifully spread, casks of wine broached, and all who came received  entertainment. As French was still spoken a good deal at the English court  and among the nobles and barons, and was considered part of the necessary  education of all persons of gentle blood, Guy, who had always used it in  his conversation with his father, had no difficulty in performing his duty  of seeing that the wants of all who came were well attended to. In a few  days guests of higher degree came in, the knights and barons of that part  of the province; a few of these expressed surprise at the height of the  sturdy men-at-arms and archers loitering about the court-yard. Sir Eustace  always answered any remarks made on the subject by saying, \"Yes, Dame  Margaret and I thought that instead of keeping all our retainers doing  nothing in our castle in England, where there is at present no use  whatever for their services, we might as well bring a couple of score of  them over here. I have no wish to take part in any of the troubles that  seem likely to disturb France, but there is never any saying what may  happen, and at any rate it costs no more to feed these men here than in  England.\"    The English archers and men-at-arms were well satisfied with their  quarters and food, and were soon on good terms with their French  associates. The garrison, before their arrival, had consisted of fifty  men-at-arms, and although these had no means of communicating verbally  with the new arrivals, they were not long in striking up such acquaintance  as could be gained by friendly gestures and the clinking of wine-cups.  Their quarters were beside those of the English, and the whole of the men-at-arms daily performed their exercises in the court-yard together, under  the command of the castellan, while the archers marched out across the  drawbridge and practised shooting at some butts pitched there. To the  French men-at-arms their performances appeared astounding. The French had  never taken to archery, but the cross-bow was in use among them, and half  of the French men-at-arms had been trained in the use of this weapon,  which was considered more valuable in the case of sieges than of warfare  in the field. While they were able to send their bolts as far as the  bowmen could shoot their arrows, there was no comparison whatever in point  of accuracy, and the archers could discharge a score of arrows while the  cross-bowmen were winding up their weapons.    \"_Pardieu_, master page,\" Jean Bouvard said one day as he stood with  Guy watching the shooting of the archers, \"I no longer wonder at the way  in which you English defeated us at Cressy and Poitiers. I have heard from  my father, who fought at Poitiers, how terrible was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7065"],[0,"Children of the Bush (#4)"],[1,"too--afterwards. P'r'aps she didn't mean it that way.  I s'pose the fact of the matter was that she didn't cotton on to me, and  wanted to let me down easy. She didn't want to hurt me feelin's, if  yer understand--she was a very good-hearted little girl. There's some  terrible tall fellers where I come from, and I know two as married  little girls.\"    He seemed a hopeless case.    \"Sometimes,\" he said, \"sometimes I wish that I wasn't so blessed long.\"    \"There's that there deaf jackaroo,\" he reflected presently. \"He's  something in the same fig about girls as I am. He's too deaf and I'm too  long.\"    \"How do you make that out?\" I asked. \"He's got three girls, to my  knowledge, and, as for being deaf, why, he gasses more than any man in  the town, and knows more of what's going on than old Mother Brindle the  washerwoman.\"    \"Well, look at that now!\" said the Giraffe, slowly. \"Who'd have thought  it? He never told me he had three girls, an' as for hearin' news, I  always tell him anything that's goin' on that I think he doesn't catch.  He told me his trouble was that whenever he went out with a girl people  could hear what they was sayin'--at least they could hear what she was  sayin' to him, an' draw their own conclusions, he said. He said he went  out one night with a girl, and some of the chaps foxed 'em an' heard her  sayin' `don't' to him, an' put it all round town.\"    \"What did she say `don't' for?\" I asked.    \"He didn't tell me that, but I s'pose he was kissin' her or huggin' her  or something.\"    \"Bob,\" I said presently, \"didn't you try the little girl in Bendigo a  second time?\"    \"No,\" he said. \"What was the use. She was a good little girl, and I  wasn't goin' to go botherin' her. I ain't the sort of cove that goes  hangin' round where he isn't wanted. But somehow I couldn't stay about  Bendigo after she gave me the hint, so I thought I'd come over an' have  a knock round on this side for a year or two.\"    \"And you never wrote to her?\"    \"No. What was the use of goin' pesterin' her with letters? I know what  trouble letters give me when I have to answer one. She'd have only had  to tell me the straight truth in a letter an' it wouldn't have done me  any good. But I've pretty well got over it by this time.\"    A few days later I went to Sydney. The Giraffe was the last I shook  hands with from the carriage window, and he slipped something in a piece  of newspaper into my hand.    \"I hope yer won't be offended,\" he drawled, \"but some of the chaps  thought you mightn't be too flush of stuff--you've been shoutin' a good  deal; so they put a quid or two together. They thought it might help yer  to have a bit of a fly round in Sydney.\"    I was back in Bourke before next shearing. On the evening of my arrival  I ran against the Giraffe; he seemed strangely shaken over something,  but he kept his hat on his head.    \"Would yer mind takin' a stroll as fur as the Billerbong?\" he said. \"I  got something I'd like to tell yer.\"    His big, brown, sunburnt hands trembled and shook as he took a letter  from his pocket and opened it.    \"I've just got a letter,\" he said. \"A letter from that little girl at  Bendigo. It seems it was all a mistake. I'd like you to read it. Somehow  I feel as if I want to talk to a feller, and I'd rather talk to you than  any of them other chaps.\"    It was a good letter, from a big-hearted little girl. She had been  breaking her heart for the great ass all these months. It seemed that  he had left Bendigo without saying good-bye to her. \"Somehow I couldn't  bring meself to it,\" he said, when I taxed him with it. She had never  been able to get his address until last week; then she got it from a  Bourke man who had gone south. She called him \"an awful long fool,\"  which he was, without the slightest doubt, and she implored him to  write, and come back to her.    \"And will you go back, Bob?\" I asked.    \"My oath! I'd take the train to-morrer only I ain't got the stuff. But  I've got a stand in Big Billerbong Shed an' I'll soon knock a few quid  together. I'll go back as soon as ever shearin's over. I'm goin' to  write away to her to-night.\"      The Giraffe was the \"ringer\" of Big Billabong Shed that season. His  tallies averaged a hundred and twenty a day. He only sent his hat round  once during shearing, and it was noticed that he hesitated at first and  only contributed half a crown. But then it was a case of a man being  taken from the shed by the police for wife desertion.    \"It's always that way,\" commented Mitchell. \"Those soft, good-hearted  fellows always end by getting hard and selfish. The world makes 'em so.  It's the thought of the soft fools they've been that finds out sooner or  later and makes 'em repent. Like as not the Giraffe will be the meanest  man out back before he's done.\"    When Big Billabong cut out, and we got back to Bourke with our dusty  swags and dirty cheques, I spoke to Tom Hall:    \"Look here, Tom,\" I said. \"That long fool, the Giraffe, has been  breaking his heart for a little girl in Bendigo ever since he's been out  back, and she's been breaking her heart for him, and the ass didn't know  it till he got a letter from her just before Big Billabong started. He's  going to-morrow morning.\"    That evening Tom stole the Giraffe's hat. \"I s'pose it'll turn up in  the mornin',\" said the Giraffe. \"I don't mind a lark,\" he added, \"but  it does seem a bit red hot for the chaps to collar a cove's hat and a  feller goin' away for good, p'r'aps, in the mornin'.\"    Mitchell started the thing going with a quid.    \"It's worth it,\" he said, \"to get rid of him. We'll have some peace now.  There won't be so many accidents or women in trouble when the Giraffe  and his blessed hat are gone. Any way, he's an eyesore in the town, and  he's getting on my nerves for one.... Come on, you sinners! Chuck 'em  in; we're only taking quids and half-quids.\"    About daylight next morning Tom Hall slipped into the Giraffe's room at  the Carriers' Arms. The Giraffe was sleeping peacefully. Tom put the  hat on a chair by his side. The collection had been a record one,  and, besides the packet of money in the crown of the hat, there was a  silver-mounted pipe with case--the best that could be bought in Bourke,  a gold brooch, and several trifles--besides an ugly valentine of a long  man in his shirt walking the room with a twin on each arm.    Tom was about to shake the Giraffe by the shoulder, when he noticed  a great foot, with about half a yard of big-boned ankle and shank,  sticking out at the bottom of the bed. The temptation was too great. Tom  took up the hair-brush, and, with the back of it, he gave a smart rap on  the point of an in-growing toe-nail, and slithered.    We heard the Giraffe swearing good-naturedly for a while, and then there  was a pregnant silence. He was staring at the hat we supposed.    We were all up at the station to see him off. It was rather a long wait.  The Giraffe edged me up to the other end of the platform.    He seemed overcome.    \"There's--there's some terrible good-hearted fellers in this world,\" he  said. \"You mustn't forgit 'em, Harry, when you make a big name writin'.  I'm--well, I'm blessed if I don't feel as if I was jist goin' to  blubber!\"    I was glad he didn't. The Giraffe blubberin' would have been a  spectacle. I steered him back to his friends.    \"Ain't you going to kiss me, Bob?\" said the Great Western's big,  handsome barmaid, as the bell rang.    \"Well, I don't mind kissin' you, Alice,\" he said, wiping his mouth. \"But  I'm goin' to be married, yer know.\" And he kissed her fair on the mouth.    \"There's nothin' like gettin' into practice,\" he said, grinning round.    We thought he was improving wonderfully; but at the last moment  something troubled him.    \"Look here, you chaps,\" he said, hesitatingly, with his hand in his  pocket, \"I don't know what I'm going to do with all this stuff. There's  that there poor washerwoman that scalded her legs liftin' the boiler of  clothes off the fire----\"    We shoved him into the carriage. He hung--about half of him--out the  window, wildly waving his hat, till the train disappeared in the scrub.    And, as I sit here writing by lamplight at midday, in the midst of a  great city of shallow social sham, of hopeless, squalid poverty, of  ignorant selfishness, cultured or brutish, and of noble and heroic  endeavour frowned down or callously neglected, I am almost aware of a  burst of sunshine in the room, and a long form leaning over my chair,  and:    \"Excuse me for troublin' yer; I'm always troublin' yer; but there's that  there poor woman....\"    And I wish I could immortalize him!          THAT PRETTY GIRL IN THE ARMY          Now I often sit at Watty's, when the night is very near,      With a head that's full of jingles--and the fumes of bottled beer;      For I always have a fancy that, if I am over there      When the Army prays for Watty, I'm included in the prayer.      It would take a lot of praying, lots of thumping on the drum,      To prepare our sinful, straying, erring souls for Kingdom Come.      But I love my fellow-sinners! and I hope, upon the whole,      That the Army gets a hearing when it prays for Watty's soul.                                               -When the World was Wide.      The Salvation Army does good business in some of the outback towns  of the great pastoral wastes of Australia. There's the thoughtless,  careless generosity of the bushman, whose pockets don't go far  enough down his trousers (that's what's the matter with him), and who  contributes to anything that comes along, without troubling to ask  questions, like long Bob Brothers of Bourke, who, chancing to be \"a  Protestant by rights,\" unwittingly subscribed towards the erection of a  new Catholic church, and, being chaffed for his mistake, said:    \"Ah, well, I don't suppose it'll matter a hang in the end, anyway it  goes. I ain't got nothink agenst the Roming Carflicks.\"   "]]]
