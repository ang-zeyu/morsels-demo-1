God! how I love that boy!  And he shall never starve!  A goodly share  of what I have shall go to him!  But this clause in my will, which the  Judge recently drew for me, will, I warrant me, give the dear child the  greatest happiness:    \"Item.  To my beloved grandnephew and namesake, Matthew, I do bequeath  and give (in addition to the lands devised and the stocks, bonds and  moneys willed to him, as hereinabove specified) the two mahogany  bookcases numbered 11 and 13, and the contents thereof, being volumes  of fairy and folk tales of all nations, and dictionaries and other  treatises upon demonology, witchcraft, mythology, magic and kindred  subjects, to be his, his heirs, and his assigns, forever.\"        III    THE LUXURY OF READING IN BED    Last night, having written what you have just read about the benefits  of fairy literature, I bethought me to renew my acquaintance with some  of those tales which so often have delighted and solaced me.  So I  piled at least twenty chosen volumes on the table at the head of my  bed, and I daresay it was nigh daylight when I fell asleep.  I began my  entertainment with several pages from Keightley's \"Fairy Mythology,\"  and followed it up with random bits from Crofton Croker's \"Traditions  of the South of Ireland,\" Mrs. Carey's \"Legends of the French  Provinces,\" Andrew Lang's Green, Blue and Red fairy books, Laboulaye's  \"Last Fairy Tales,\" Hauff's \"The Inn in the Spessart,\" Julia Goddard's  \"Golden Weathercock,\" Frere's \"Eastern Fairy Legends,\"  Asbjornsen's  \"Folk Tales,\" Susan Pindar's \"Midsummer Fays,\" Nisbit Bain's \"Cossack  Fairy Tales,\" etc., etc.    I fell asleep with a copy of Villamaria's fairy stories in my hands,  and I had a delightful dream wherein, under the protection and guidance  of my fairy godmother, I undertook the rescue of a beautiful princess  who had been enchanted by a cruel witch and was kept in prison by the  witch's son, a hideous ogre with seven heads, whose companions were  four equally hideous dragons.    This undertaking in which I was engaged involved a period of five  years, but time is of precious little consideration to one when he is  dreaming of exploits achieved in behalf of a beautiful princess.  My  fairy godmother (she wore a mob-cap and was hunchbacked) took good care  of me, and conducted me safely through all my encounters with demons,  giants, dragons, witches, serpents, hippogriffins, ogres, etc.; and I  had just rescued the princess and broken the spell which bound her, and  we were about to \"live in peace to the end of our lives,\" when I awoke  to find it was all a dream, and that the gas-light over my bed had been  blazing away during the entire period of my five-year war for the  delectable maiden.    This incident gives me an opportunity to say that observation has  convinced me that all good and true book-lovers practise the pleasing  and improving avocation of reading in bed.  Indeed, I fully believe  with Judge Methuen that no book can be appreciated until it has been  slept with and dreamed over.  You recall, perhaps, that eloquent  passage in his noble defence of the poet Archias, wherein Cicero (not  Kikero) refers to his own pursuit of literary studies:  \"Haec studia  adolescentiam alunt, senectutem oblectant; secundas res ornant,  adversis perfugium ac solatium praebent; delectant domi, non impediunt  foris; PERNOCTANT nobiscum, peregrinantur, rusticantur!\"    By the gods! you spoke tally, friend Cicero; for it is indeed so, that  these pursuits nourish our earlier and delight our later years,  dignifying the minor details of life and affording a perennial refuge  and solace; at home they please us and in no vocation elsewhere do they  embarrass us; they are with  us by night, they go with us upon our  travels, and even upon our retirement into the country do they  accompany us!    I have italicized pernoctant because it is that word which demonstrates  beyond all possibility of doubt that Cicero made a practice of reading  in bed.  Why, I can almost see him now, propped up in his couch,  unrolling scroll after scroll of his favorite literature, and enjoying  it mightily, too, which enjoyment is interrupted now and then by the  occasion which the noble reader takes to mutter maledictions upon the  slave who has let the lamp run low of oil or has neglected to trim the  wick.    \"Peregrinantur?\"  Indeed, they do share our peregrinations, these  literary pursuits do.  If Thomas Hearne (of blessed memory!) were alive  to-day he would tell us that he used always to take a book along with  him whenever he went walking, and was wont to read it as he strolled  along.  On several occasions (as he tells us in his diary) he became so  absorbed in his reading that he missed his way and darkness came upon  him before he knew it.    I have always wondered why book-lovers have not had more to say of  Hearne, for assuredly he was as glorious a collector as ever felt the  divine fire glow within him.  His character is exemplified in this  prayer, which is preserved among other papers of his in the Bodleian  Library:    \"O most gracious and merciful Lord God, wonderful is Thy providence.  I  return all possible thanks to Thee for the care Thou hast always taken  of me.  I continually meet with most signal instances of this Thy  providence, and one act yesterday, when I unexpectedly met with three  old MSS., for which, in a particular manner, I return my thanks,  beseeching Thee to continue the same protection to me, a poor, helpless  sinner,\" etc.    Another prayer of Hearne's, illustrative of his faith in dependence  upon Divine counsel, was made at the time Hearne was importuned by Dr.  Bray, commissary to my Lord Bishop of London, \"to go to Mary-Land\" in  the character of a missionary.  \"O Lord God, Heavenly Father, look down  upon me with pity,\" cries this pious soul,  \"and be pleased to be my  guide, now I am importuned to leave the place where I have been  educated in the university.  And of Thy great goodness I humbly desire  Thee to signify to me what is most proper for me to do in this affair.\"    Another famous man who made a practice of reading books as he walked  the highways was Dr. Johnson, and it is recorded that he presented a  curious spectacle indeed, for his shortsightedness compelled him to  hold the volume close to his nose, and he shuffled along, rather than  walked, stepping high over shadows and stumbling over sticks and stones.    But, perhaps, the most interesting story illustrative of the practice  of carrying one's reading around with one is that which is told of  Professor Porson, the Greek scholar.  This human monument of learning  happened to be travelling in the same coach with a coxcomb who sought  to air his pretended learning by quotations from the ancients.  At last  old Porson asked:    \"Pri'thee, sir, whence comes that quotation?\"    \"From Sophocles,\" quoth the vain fellow.    \"Be so kind as to find it for me?\" asked Porson, producing a copy of  Sophocles from his pocket.    Then the coxcomb, not at all abashed, said that he meant not Sophocles,  but Euripides.  Whereupon Porson drew from another pocket a copy of  Euripides and challenged the upstart to find the quotation in question.  Full of confusion, the fellow thrust his head out of the window of the  coach and cried to the driver:    \"In heaven's name, put me down at once; for there is an old gentleman  in here that hath the Bodleian Library in his pocket!\"    Porson himself was a veritable slave to the habit of reading in bed.  He would lie down with his books piled around him, then light his pipe  and start in upon some favorite volume.  A jug of liquor was invariably  at hand, for Porson was a famous drinker. It is related that on one  occasion he fell into a boosy slumber, his pipe dropped out of his  mouth and set fire to the bed-clothes. But for the arrival of succor  the  tipsy scholar would surely have been cremated.    Another very slovenly fellow was De Quincey, and he was devoted to  reading in bed.  But De Quincey was a very vandal when it came to the  care and use of books.  He never returned volumes he borrowed, and he  never hesitated to mutilate a rare book in order to save himself the  labor and trouble of writing out a quotation.    But perhaps the person who did most to bring reading in bed into evil  repute was Mrs. Charles Elstob, ward and sister of the Canon of  Canterbury (circa 1700).  In his \"Dissertation on Letter-Founders,\"  Rowe Mores describes this woman as the \"indefessa comes\" of her  brother's studies, a female student in Oxford.  She was, says Mores, a  northern lady of an ancient family and a genteel fortune, \"but she  pursued too much the drug called learning, and in that pursuit failed  of being careful of any one thing necessary.  In her latter years she  was tutoress in the family of the Duke of Portland, where we visited  her in her sleeping-room at Bulstrode, surrounded  with books and  dirtiness, the usual appendages of folk of learning!\"    There is another word which Cicero uses--for I have still somewhat more  to say of that passage from the oration \"pro Archia poeta\"--the word  \"rusticantur,\" which indicates that civilization twenty centuries ago  made a practice of taking books out into the country for summer  reading.  \"These literary pursuits rusticate with us,\" says Cicero, and  thus he presents to us a pen-picture of the Roman patrician stretched  upon the cool grass under the trees, perusing the latest popular  romance, while, forsooth, in yonder hammock his dignified spouse swings  slowly to and fro, conning the pages and the colored plates of the  current fashion journal.  Surely in the telltale word \"rusticantur\" you  and I and the rest of human nature find a worthy precedent and much  encouragement for our practice of loading up with plenty of good  reading before we start for the scene of our annual summering.    As for myself, I never go away "]]]
