The King of Navarre \"sent for Monsieur _de Mirabeau_ under colour of     treating with him concerning other businesses, and forced him to deliver     up Brouage into his hands, a Fort of great importance, as well for that     it lies upon the Coast of the Ocean-sea, as because it abounds with such     store of salt-pits, which yeeld a great and constant revenue; he made     the Sieur de Montaut Governour, and put into it a strong Garrison of his     dependents, furnishing it with ammunition, and fortifying it with     exceeding diligence.\"--_His.

The Rochellers consented to     this Enterprise, both for their profit, and reputation which redounded     by it; and having sent a great many Ships thither, besieged the Fortress     by Sea, whilst the Prince having possessed that passage which is the     only way to Brouage by land, and having shut up the Defendants within     the circuit of their walls, straightned the Siege very closely on that     side.\"--_Davila_, p. 582. See also, _Histoire de Thou_, a Londres, 1734,     Tom. IX., p. 383.       The blocking up the harbor at this time appears to have been more     effective than convenient. Twenty boats or rafts filled with earth and     stone were sunk with a purpose of destroying the harbor. De Saint Luc,     the governor, succeeded in removing only four or five. The entrance for     vessels afterward remained difficult except at high tide. Subsequently     Cardinal de Richelieu expended a hundred thousand francs to remove the     rest, but did not succeed in removing one of them.--_Vide Histoire de La     Rochelle_, par Arcere, Tom I. p. 121.    7. The Prince of Conde. \"Leaving Monsieur de St. Mesmes with the Infantry     and Artillery at the Siege of Brouage, and giving order that the Fleet     should continue to block it up by sea, he departed upon the eight of     October to relieve the Castle of Angiers with 800 Gentlemen and 1400     Harquebuziers on horseback.\"--_Davila_, p. 583.

An old writer gives us some idea of the vast quantities of salt exported     from France by the amount sent to a single country.       \"Important denique sexies mille vel circiter centenarios salis, quorum     singuli constant centenis modiis, ducentenas ut minimum & vicenas     quinas, vel & tricenas, pro salis ipsius candore puritateque, libras     pondo pendentibus, sena igitur libras centenariorum millia, computatis     in singulos aureis nummis tricenis, centum & octoginta reserunt aureorum     millia.\"--_Belguae Descrtptio_, a Lud. Gvicciardino, Amstelodami, 1652,     p. 244.       TRANSLATION.--They import in fine 6000 centenarii of salt, each one of     which contains 100 bushels, weighing at least 225 or 230 pounds,     according to the purity and whiteness of the salt; therefore six     thousand centenarii, computing each at thirty golden nummi, amount to     180,000 aurei.       It may not be easy to determine the value of this importation in money,     since the value of gold is constantly changing, but the quantity     imported may be readily determined, which was according to the above     statement, 67,500 tons.       A treaty of April 30, 1527, between Francis I. of France and Henry VIII.     of England, provided as follows:--\"And, besides, should furnish unto the     said _Henry_, as long as hee lived, yearly, of the Salt of _Brouage_,     the value of fifteene thousand Crownes.\"--_Life and Raigne of Henry     VIII._, by Lord Herbert of Cherbury, London, 1649, p. 206.       Saintonge continued for a long time to be the source of large exports of     salt. De Witt, writing about the year 1658, says they received in     Holland of \"salt, yearly, the lading of 500 or 600 ships, exported from     Rochel, Maran, Brouage, the Island of Oleron, and Ree.\"--_Republick of     Holland_, by John De Witt, London, 1702, p. 271. But it no longer holds     the pre-eminence which it did three centuries ago. Saintonge long since     yielded the palm to Brittany.    10. Vide _Oeuvres de Champlain_, Quebec ed, Tom. III. p. v.    11. In 1558, it was estimated that there were already 400,000 persons in      France who were declared adherents of the Reformation.--_Ranke's Civil      Wars in France_, Vol. I., p. 234.        \"Although our assemblies were most frequently held in the depth of      midnight, and our enemies very often heard us passing through the      street, yet so it was, that God bridled them in such manner that we      were preserved under His protection.\"--_Bernard Palissy_, 1580.

Philippe Emanuel de Lorraine, Duc de Mercoeur, born at Nomeny,      September 9, 1558, was the son of Nicolas, Count de Vaudemont, by his      second wife, Jeanne de Savoy, and was half-brother of Queen Louise, the      wife of Henry III. He was made governor of Brittany in 1582. He      embraced the party of the League before the death of Henry III.,      entered into an alliance with Philip II., and gave the Spaniards      possession of the port of Blavet in 1591. He made his submission to      Henry IV. in 1598, on which occasion his only daughter Francoise,      probably the richest heiress in the kingdom, was contracted in marriage      to Cesar, Duc de Vendome, the illegitimate son of Henry IV. by      Gabrielle d'Estrees, the Duchess de Beaufort. The Duc de Mercoeur died      at Nuremburg, February 19, 1602.--_Vide Birch's Memoirs of Queen      Elizabeth_, Vol. I., p. 82; _Davila's His. Civil Warres of France_, p.      1476.    14. Jean d'Aumont, born in 1522, a Marshal of France who served under      six kings, Francis I., Henry II., Francis II., Charles IX., Henry      III., and Henry IV. He distinguished himself at the battles of      Dreux, Saint-Denis, Montcontour, and in the famous siege of      Rochelle in 1573. After the death of Henry III., he was the first      to recognize Henry IV., whom he served with the same zeal as he      had his five predecessors. He took part in the brilliant battle of      Arques in 1589. In the following year, he so distinguished himself      at Ivry that Henry IV., inviting him to sup with him after this      memorable battle, addressed to him these flattering words, \"Il est      juste que vous soyez du festin, apres m'avoir si bien servi a mes      noces.\" At the siege of the Chateau de Camper, in Upper Brittany,      he received a musket shot which fractured his arm, and died of the      wound on the 19th of August, 1595, at the age of seventy-three      years. \"Ce grand capitaine qui avoit si bien merite du Roi et de      la nation, emporta dans le tombeau les regrets des Officiers & des      soldats, qui pleurerent amerement la perte de leur General.

There are no efforts which are so efficient and powerful in the  accomplishment of their end as those which a faithful wife makes to  rescue and save her husband. The heart, generally so timid, seems to  be inspired on such occasions with a preternatural courage, and the  arm, at other times so feeble and helpless, is nerved with unexpected  strength. Every one is ready to second and help such efforts, and she  who makes them is surprised at her success, and wonders at the extent  and efficiency of the powers which she finds herself so unexpectedly  able to wield.    The queen interested all classes in Holland in her plans, and by her  personal credit, and the security of her diamonds and rubies, she  borrowed large sums of money from the government, from the banks, and  from private merchants. The sums which she thus raised amounted to two  millions of pounds sterling, equal to nearly ten millions of dollars.  While these negotiations were going on she remained in Holland, with  her little daughter, the bride, under her care, whose education she  was carrying forward all the time with the help of suitable masters;  for, though married, Mary was yet a child. The little husband was going  on at the same time with his studies too.    Henrietta remained in Holland a year. She expended a part of her money  in purchasing military stores and supplies for her husband, and then  set sail with them, and with the money not expended, to join the king.  The voyage was a very extraordinary one. A great gale of wind began  to blow from the northeast soon after the ships left the port, which  increased in violence for nine days, until at length the sea was lashed  to such a state of fury that the company lost all hope of ever reaching  the land. The queen had with her a large train of attendants, both  ladies and gentlemen; and there were also in her suit a number of  Catholic priests, who always accompanied her as the chaplains and  confessors of her household. These persons had all been extremely sick,  and had been tied into their beds on account of the excessive rolling  of the ship, and their own exhaustion and helplessness. The danger  increased, until at last it became so extremely imminent that all the  self-possession of the passengers was entirely gone. In such protracted  storms, the surges of the sea strike the ship with terrific force, and  vast volumes of water fall heavily upon the decks, threatening instant  destruction--the ship plunging awfully after the shock, as if sinking  to rise no more. At such moments, the noble ladies who accompanied the  queen on this voyage would be overwhelmed with terror, and they filled  the cabins with their shrieks of dismay. All this time the queen herself  was quiet and composed. She told the ladies not to fear, for \"queens  of England were never drowned.\"    At one time, when the storm was at its height, the whole party were  entirely overwhelmed with consternation and terror. Two of the ships  were engulfed and lost. The queen's company thought that their own was  sinking. They came crowding into the cabin where the priests were  lying, sick and helpless, and began all together to confess their sins  to them, in the Catholic mode, eager in these their last moments, as  they supposed, to relieve their consciences in any way from the burdens  of guilt which oppressed them. The queen herself did not participate  in these fears. She ridiculed the absurd confessions, and rebuked the  senseless panic to which the terrified penitents were yielding; and  whenever any mitigation of the violence of the gale made it possible  to do any thing to divert the minds of her company, she tried to make  amusement out of the odd and strange dilemmas in which they were  continually placed, and the ludicrous disasters and accidents which  were always befalling her servants and officers of state, in their  attempts to continue the etiquette and ceremony proper in attendance  upon a queen, and from which even the violence of such a storm, and  the imminence of such danger, could not excuse them. After a fortnight  of danger, terror, and distress, the ships that remained of the little  squadron succeeded in getting back to the port from which they had  sailed.    The queen, however, did not despair. After a few days of rest and  refreshment she set sail again, though it was now in the dead of winter.  The result of this second attempt was a prosperous voyage, and the  little fleet arrived in due time at Burlington, on the English coast,  where the queen landed her money and her stores. She had, however,  after all, a very narrow escape, for she was very closely pursued on  her voyage by an English squadron. They came into port the night after  she had landed, and the next morning she was awakened by the crashing  of cannon balls and the bursting of bomb shells in the houses around  her, and found, on hastily rising, that the village was under a  bombardment from the ships of her enemies. She hurried on some sort  of dress, and sallied forth with her attendants to escape into the  fields. This incident is related fully in the history of her husband,  Charles the First; but there is one circumstance, not there detailed,  which illustrates very strikingly that strange combination of mental  greatness and energy worthy of a queen, with a simplicity of affections  and tastes which we should scarcely expect in a child, that marked  Henrietta's character. She had a small dog. Its name was Mike. They  say it was an ugly little animal, too, in all eyes but her own. This  dog accompanied her on the voyage, and landed with her on the English  shore. On the morning, however, when she fled from her bed to escape  from the balls and bomb shells of the English ships, she recollected,  after getting a short distance from the house, that Mike was left  behind. She immediately returned, ran up to her chamber again, seized  Mike, who was sleeping unconsciously upon her bed, and bore the little  pet away from the scene of ruin which the balls and bursting shells  were making, all astonished, no doubt, at so hurried and violent an  abduction. The party gained the open fields, and seeking shelter in  a dry trench, which ran along the margin of a field, they crouched  there together till the commander of the ships was tired of firing.    The queen's destination was York, the great and ancient capital of the  north of England York was the head quarters of King Charles's army,  though he himself was not there at this time. As soon as news of the  queen's arrival reached York, the general in command there sent down  to the coast a detachment of two thousand men to escort the heroine,  and the stores and money which she had brought, to her husband's  capital. At the head of this force she marched in triumph across the  country, with a long train of ordnance and baggage wagons loaded with  supplies. There were six pieces of cannon, and two hundred and fifty  wagons loaded with the money which she had obtained in Holland. The  whole country was excited with enthusiasm at the spectacle. The  enthusiasm was increased by the air and bearing of the queen, who,  proud and happy at this successful result of all her dangers and toils,  rode on horseback at the head of her army like a general, spoke frankly  to the soldiers, sought no shelter from the sun and rain, and ate her  meals, like the rest of the army, in a bivouac in the open field. She  had been the means, in some degree, of leading the king into his  difficulties, by the too vigorous measures she had urged him to take  in the case of the attempted parliamentary arrest. She seems to have  been determined to make that spirit of resolution and energy in her,  which caused the mischief then, atone for it by its efficient usefulness  now. She stopped on her march to summon and _take_ a town, which had  been hitherto in the hands of her husband's enemies, adding thus the  glory of a conquest to the other triumphs of the day.    In fact, the queen's heart was filled with pride and pleasure at this  conclusion of her enterprise, as is very manifest from the frequent  letters which she wrote to her husband at the time. The king's cause  revived. They gradually approached each other in the operations which  they severally conducted, until at last the king, after a great and  successful battle, set off at the head of a large escort to come and  meet his wife. They met in the vale of Keynton, near Edgehill, which  is on the southern borders of Warwickshire, near the center of the  island. The meeting was, of course, one of the greatest excitement and  pleasure. Charles praised the high courage and faithful affection of  his devoted wife, and she was filled with happiness in enjoying the  love and gratitude of her husband.    The pressure of outward misfortune and calamity has always the same  strong tendency as was manifest in this case to invigorate anew all  the ties of conjugal and domestic affection, and thus to create the  happiness which it seems to the world to destroy. In the early part  of Charles and Henrietta's married life, while every thing external  went smoothly and prosperously with them, they were very far from being  happy. They destroyed each other's peace by petty disputes and jars  about things of little consequence, in which they each had scarcely  any interest except a desire to carry the point and triumph over the  other. King Charles himself preserved a record of one of these disputes.  The queen had received, at the time of her marriage, certain estates,  consisting of houses and lands, the income of which was to be at her  disposal, and she wished to appoint certain treasurers to take charge  of this property. She had made out a list of these officers in  consultation with her mother. She gave this list to Charles one night,  after he was himself in bed. He said he would look at it in the "]]]
