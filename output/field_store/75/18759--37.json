Why raise landmarks between my neighbour's  field and mine, when my heart has made no division between our  interests; but shares all his joys and sorrows with the same force and  vivacity as if originally my own? Every man, upon this supposition,  being a second self to another, would trust all his interests to the  discretion of every man; without jealousy, without partition, without  distinction. And the whole human race would form only one family; where  all would lie in common, and be used freely, without regard to property;  but cautiously too, with as entire regard to the necessities of each  individual, as if our own interests were most intimately concerned.    In the present disposition of the human heart, it would, perhaps, be  difficult to find complete instances of such enlarged affections; but  still we may observe, that the case of families approaches towards it;  and the stronger the mutual benevolence is among the individuals, the  nearer it approaches; till all distinction of property be, in a great  measure, lost and confounded among them. Between married persons, the  cement of friendship is by the laws supposed so strong as to abolish all  division of possessions; and has often, in reality, the force ascribed  to it. And it is observable, that, during the ardour of new enthusiasms,  when every principle is inflamed into extravagance, the community of  goods has frequently been attempted; and nothing but experience of its  inconveniencies, from the returning or disguised selfishness of men,  could make the imprudent fanatics adopt anew the ideas of justice and of  separate property. So true is it, that this virtue derives its existence  entirely from its necessary USE to the intercourse and social state of  mankind.    To make this truth more evident, let us reverse the foregoing  suppositions; and carrying everything to the opposite extreme, consider  what would be the effect of these new situations. Suppose a society to  fall into such want of all common necessaries, that the utmost frugality  and industry cannot preserve the greater number from perishing, and the  whole from extreme misery; it will readily, I believe, be admitted, that  the strict laws of justice are suspended, in such a pressing  emergence, and give place to the stronger motives of necessity and  self-preservation. Is it any crime, after a shipwreck, to seize whatever  means or instrument of safety one can lay hold of, without regard to  former limitations of property? Or if a city besieged were perishing  with hunger; can we imagine, that men will see any means of preservation  before them, and lose their lives, from a scrupulous regard to what, in  other situations, would be the rules of equity and justice? The use  and tendency of that virtue is to procure happiness and security, by  preserving order in society: but where the society is ready to perish  from extreme necessity, no greater evil can be dreaded from violence and  injustice; and every man may now provide for himself by all the means,  which prudence can dictate, or humanity permit. The public, even in less  urgent necessities, opens granaries, without the consent of proprietors;  as justly supposing, that the authority of magistracy may, consistent  with equity, extend so far: but were any number of men to assemble,  without the tie of laws or civil jurisdiction; would an equal partition  of bread in a famine, though effected by power and even violence, be  regarded as criminal or injurious?    Suppose likewise, that it should be a virtuous man's fate to fall  into the society of ruffians, remote from the protection of laws and  government; what conduct must he embrace in that melancholy situation?  He sees such a desperate rapaciousness prevail; such a disregard  to equity, such contempt of order, such stupid blindness to future  consequences, as must immediately have the most tragical conclusion,  and must terminate in destruction to the greater number, and in a total  dissolution of society to the rest. He, meanwhile, can have no other  expedient than to arm himself, to whomever the sword he seizes, or  the buckler, may belong: To make provision of all means of defence and  security: And his particular regard to justice being no longer of use  to his own safety or that of others, he must consult the dictates of  self-preservation alone, without concern for those who no longer merit  his care and attention.    When any man, even in political society, renders himself by his crimes,  obnoxious to the public, he is punished by the laws in his goods and  person; that is, the ordinary rules of justice are, with regard to him,  suspended for a moment, and it becomes equitable to inflict on him, for  the BENEFIT of society, what otherwise he could not suffer without wrong  or injury.    The rage and violence of public war; what is it but a suspension of  justice among the warring parties, who perceive, that this virtue is now  no longer of any USE or advantage to them? The laws of war, which then  succeed to those of equity and justice, are rules calculated for the  ADVANTAGE and UTILITY of that particular state, in which men are  now placed. And were a civilized nation engaged with barbarians, who  observed no rules even of war, the former must also suspend their  observance of them, where they no longer serve to any purpose; and must  render every action or recounter as bloody and pernicious as possible to  the first aggressors.    Thus, the rules of equity or justice depend entirely on the particular  state and condition in which men are placed, and owe their origin and  existence to that utility, which results to the public from their strict  and regular observance. Reverse, in any considerable circumstance,  the condition of men: Produce extreme abundance or extreme necessity:  Implant in the human breast perfect moderation and humanity, or perfect  rapaciousness and malice: By rendering justice totally USELESS, you  thereby totally destroy its essence, and suspend its obligation upon  mankind. The common situation of society is a medium amidst all these  extremes. We are naturally partial to ourselves, and to our friends; but  are capable of learning the advantage resulting from a more equitable  conduct. Few enjoyments are given us from the open and liberal hand of  nature; but by art, labour, and industry, we can extract them in great  abundance. Hence the ideas of property become necessary in all civil  society: Hence justice derives its usefulness to the public: And hence  alone arises its merit and moral obligation.    These conclusions are so natural and obvious, that they have not escaped  even the poets, in their descriptions of the felicity attending the  golden age or the reign of Saturn. The seasons, in that first period of  nature, were so temperate, if we credit these agreeable fictions, that  there was no necessity for men to provide themselves with clothes and  houses, as a security against the violence of heat and cold: The  rivers flowed with wine and milk: The oaks yielded honey; and nature  spontaneously produced her greatest delicacies. Nor were these the  chief advantages of that happy age. Tempests were not alone removed from  nature; but those more furious tempests were unknown to human breasts,  which now cause such uproar, and engender such confusion. Avarice,  ambition, cruelty, selfishness, were never heard of: Cordial affection,  compassion, sympathy, were the only movements with which the mind was  yet acquainted. Even the punctilious distinction of MINE and THINE was  banished from among the happy race of mortals, and carried with it the  very notion of property and obligation, justice and injustice.    This POETICAL fiction of the GOLDEN AGE, is in some respects, of a piece  with the PHILOSOPHICAL fiction of the STATE OF NATURE; only that the  former is represented as the most charming and most peaceable condition,  which can possibly be imagined; whereas the latter is painted out as  a state of mutual war and violence, attended with the most extreme  necessity. On the first origin of mankind, we are told, their ignorance  and savage nature were so prevalent, that they could give no mutual  trust, but must each depend upon himself and his own force or cunning  for protection and security. No law was heard of: No rule of justice  known: No distinction of property regarded: Power was the only measure  of right; and a perpetual war of all against all was the result of men's  untamed selfishness and barbarity.           [Footnote: This fiction of a state of nature, as a state of war,  was not first started by Mr. Hobbes, as is commonly imagined. Plato  endeavours to refute an hypothesis very like it in the second, third,  and fourth books de republica. Cicero, on the contrary, supposes it  certain and universally acknowledged in the following passage. 'Quis  enim vestrum, judices, ignorat, ita naturam rerum tulisse, ut quodam  tempore homines, nondum neque naturali neque civili jure descripto,  fusi per agros ac dispersi vagarentur tantumque haberent quantum manu ac  viribus, per caedem ac vulnera, aut eripere aut retinere potuissent?  Qui igitur primi virtute & consilio praestanti extiterunt, ii perspecto  genere humanae docilitatis atque ingenii, dissipatos unum in locum  congregarunt, eosque ex feritate illa ad justitiam ac mansuetudinem  transduxerunt. Tum res ad communem utilitatem, quas publicas appellamus,  tum conventicula hominum, quae postea civitates nominatae sunt, tum  domicilia conjuncta, quas urbes dicamus, invento & divino & humano jure  moenibus sepserunt. Atque inter hanc vitam,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43282"],[0,"Scientific American, Vol. XXXIX.No. 6. [New Series.], August 10, 1878 (#4)"],[1,"a large drum shaped head divided into  one hundred equal parts, so that moving this head by one division  carries the second \"wire\" 1/10000 part of an inch nearer to the first.  Motions smaller than this can clearly be registered, but it will be  evident that everything here really depends upon the accuracy of the  screw. The guide screw of the best lathe is a coarse piece of work by  comparison with \"micrometer\" screws as now constructed (especially those  for making the \"gratings\" to be described later), for recent uses of  them demand perhaps the most accurate workmanship of anything in  mechanics--the maker of one which will pass some lately invented tests  is entitled at any rate to call himself \"a workman.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 11]    Since the \"wires\" are stretched precisely in the focus, where the  principal image of the sun is formed, and move in it, they, and the  features of the surface, form one picture, as magnified by the eye lens,  so that they appear as if moving about on the sun itself. We can first  set them far enough apart, for instance, to take in the whole of a spot,  and then by bringing them together measure its apparent diameter, in ten  thousandths of an inch. Then, measuring the diameter of the whole sun,  we have evidently the proportion that one bears to the other, and hence  the means of easily calculating the real size. A powerful piece of  clockwork, attached to the equatorial, keeps it slowly rotating on its  axis, at the same angular rate as that with which the sun moves in the  sky, so that any spot or other object there will seem to stay fixed with  relation to the \"wires,\" if we choose, all day long. The picture of  \"wires,\" spots, and all, may be projected on a screen if desired; and  Fig. 11 shows the field of view, with the micrometer wires lying across  a \"spot,\" so seen on the 6th of March, 1873. Part of a cambric needle  with the end of a fine thread is represented also as being projected on  the screen along with the \"wires\" to give a better idea of the delicacy  of the latter.    Now we may measure, if we please, the size of one of those bright  objects, which have just been spoken of as being countable by hundreds  of thousands. These \"little things\" are then seen to be really of  considerable size, measuring from one to three seconds of arc, so that  (a second of arc here being over 400 miles) the average surface of each  individual of these myriads is found to be considerably larger than  Great Britain. Near the edge of the disk, under favorable circumstances,  they appear to rise up through the obscuring atmosphere, which darkens  the limb, and gathered here and there in groups of hundreds, to form the  white cloudlike patches (_faculae_), which may sometimes be seen even  with a spy-glass--\"something in the sun brighter than the sun itself,\"  to employ the expression by which Huyghens described them nearly two  hundred years ago. They are too minute and delicate objects to be  rendered at all in our engraving; but this is true also of much of the  detail to be seen at times in the spots themselves. The wood cuts make  no pretense to do more than give an outline of the more prominent  features, of which we are now about to speak. The wonderful beauty of  some of their details must be taken on trust, from the writer's  imperfect description of what no pencil has ever yet rendered and what  the photograph has not yet seized.    [Illustration: Fig. A.]    [Illustration: Fig. 10.]    Bearing this in mind, let us now suppose that while using the polarizing  eyepiece on the part of the spot distinguished by the little circle, we  have one of those rare opportunities when we can, by the temporary  steadiness of our tremulous atmosphere, use the higher powers of the  telescope and magnify the little circle till it appears as in Fig. 12.  We have now nearly the same view as if we were brought close to the  surface of the sun, and suspended over this part of the spot. All the  faint outer shade, seen in the smaller views (the _penumbra_) is seen to  be made up of long white filaments, twisted into curious ropelike forms,  while the central part is like a great flame, ending in fiery spires.  Over these hang what look like clouds, such as we sometimes see in our  highest sky, but more transparent than the finest lace vail would be,  and having not the \"fleecy\" look of our clouds, but the appearance of  being filled with almost infinitely delicate threads of light. Perhaps  the best idea of what is so hard to describe, because so unlike anything  on earth, is got by supposing ourselves to look _through_ successive  vails of white lace, filled with flower-like patterns, at some great  body of white flame beyond, while between the spires of the flame and  separating it from the border are depths of shade passing into  blackness. With all this, there is something crystalline about the  appearance, which it is hard to render an idea of--frost-figures on a  window pane may help us as an image, though imperfect. In fact the  intense whiteness of everything is oddly suggestive of something very  cold, rather than very hot, as we know it really. I have had much the  same impression when looking into the open mouth of a puddling furnace  at the lumps of pure white iron, swimming half-melted in the grayer  fluid about them. Here, however, the temperature leaves nothing solid,  nothing liquid even; the iron and other metals of which we know these  spot-forms do in part at least consist are turned into vapor by the  inconceivable heat, and everything we are looking at consists probably  of clouds of such vapor; for it is fluctuating and changing from one  form into another while we look on. Forms as evanescent almost as those  of sunset clouds, and far more beautiful in everything but color, are  shifting before us, and here and there we see, or think we see, in the  sweep of their curves beyond, evidences of mighty whirlwinds (greater by  far than the largest terrestrial cyclone) at work. While we are looking,  and trying to make the most of every moment, our atmosphere grows  tremulous again, the shapes get confused, there is nothing left distinct  but such coarser features as our engraving shows, and the wonderful  sight is over. When we consider that this little portion of the spot we  have been looking at is larger than the North and South American  continents together, and that we could yet see its parts change from  minute to minute, it must be evident that the actual motion must have  been rapid almost beyond conception--a speed of from 20 to 50 miles a  _second_ being commonly observed and sometimes exceeded. (A cannon ball  moves less than 1/4 of a mile per second.) I have seen a portion of the  photosphere, or bright general surface of the sun, drawn into a spot,  much as any floating thing would be drawn into a whirlpool, and then,  though it occupied by measurement over 3,000,000 miles in area,  completely break up and change so as to be unrecognizable in less than  twenty minutes.    When we come to discuss the subject of the sun's heat, we shall find  that the temperature of a blast furnace or of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe  is low compared with that which obtains all over such a vast region, and  remembering this, it is evident that its disappearance is a cataclysm of  which the most tremendous volcanic outburst here gives no conception. We  cannot, by any terrestrial comparison, describe it, for we have no  comparison for it in human experience. If we try to picture such an  effect on the earth, we may say in another's words that these solar  whirlwinds are such as, \"coming down upon us from the north, would in  thirty seconds after they had crossed the St. Lawrence be in the Gulf of  Mexico, carrying with them the whole surface of the continent in a mass,  not simply of ruin, but of glowing vapor, in which the vapors arising  from the dissolution of the materials composing the cities of Boston,  New York, and Chicago would be mixed in a single indistinguishable  cloud.\"    These vast cavities then in the sun we call spots are not solid things,  and not properly to be compared even to masses of slag or scoria  swimming on a molten surface. They are rather rents in that bright cloud  surface of the sun which we call the photosphere, and through which we  look down to lower regions. Their shape may be very rudely likened to a  funnel with sides at first slowly sloping (the _penumbra_), and then  suddenly going down into the central darkness (the _umbra_). This  central darkness has itself gradations of shade, and cloud forms may be  seen there obscurely glowing with a reddish tinge far down its depths,  but we never see to any solid bottom, and the hypothesis of a habitable  sun far within the hot surface, suggested by Sir William Herschel, is  now utterly abandoned. We are able now to explain in part that  mysterious feature in the sun's rotation before insisted on, for if the  sun be not a solid or a liquid, but a mass of glowing vapor, it is  evidently possible that one part of it may turn faster than another.  _Why_ it so turns, we repeat, no one knows, but the fact that it does is  now seen to bear the strongest testimony to the probable gaseous form of  the sun throughout its mass--at any rate, to the gaseous or vaporous  nature of everything we see. We must not forget, however, that under  such enormous temperature and pressure as prevail there the conditions  may be--in fact, must be--very different from any familiar to us here,  so that when we speak of \"clouds,\" and use like expressions, we are to  be understood as implying rather an analogy than an exact resemblance.    [Illustration: Fig. 12]    We must expect, with the great advances photography has lately made, to  know more of this part of our subject (which we may call solar  meteorology) at the next spot maximum than ever before, and by that time  it may be hoped that some of the wonderful forms"]]]
