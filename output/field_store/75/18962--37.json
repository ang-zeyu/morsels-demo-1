No sooner was peace restored, in 1763, than these laudable designs  engaged his majesty's patronage; and two voyages round the world had  been undertaken before Mr. Cook set out on his first command. The  conductors of these voyages were the Captains Byron, Wallis, and  Carteret,[4] by whom several discoveries were made, which contributed,  in no small degree, to increase the knowledge of geography and  navigation. Nevertheless, as the purpose for which they were sent out  appears to have had a principal reference to a particular object in  the South Atlantic, the direct track they were obliged to hold, on  their way homeward by the East Indies, prevented them from doing so  much as might otherwise have been expected towards giving the world a  complete view of that immense expanse of ocean, which the South  Pacific comprehends.      [Footnote 4: The Captains Wallis and Carteret went out together    upon the same expedition; but the vessels they commanded having    accidentally parted company, they proceeded and returned by a    different route. Hence their voyages are distinctly related by Dr.    Hawkesworth.]    Before Captain Wallis and Captain Carteret had returned to Great  Britain, another voyage was resolved upon, for which the improvement  of astronomical science afforded the immediate occasion. It having  been calculated by astronomers, that a transit of Venus over the Sun's  disk would happen in 1769, it was judged that the best place for  observing it would be in some part of the South Sea, either at the  Marquesas, or at one of those islands which Tasman had called  Amsterdam; Rotterdam, and Middleburg, and which are now better known  under the appellation of the Friendly Islands. This being a matter of  eminent consequence in astronomy, and which excited the attention of  foreign nations as well as of our own, the affair was taken up by the  Royal Society, with the zeal which has always been displayed by that  learned body for the advancement of every branch of philosophical  science. Accordingly, a long memorial was addressed to his majesty,  dated February the 15th, 1768, representing the great importance of  the object, together with the regard which had been paid to it by the  principal courts of Europe; and entreating, among other things that a  vessel might be ordered, at the expense of government, for the  conveyance of suitable persons, to make the observation of the transit  of Venus, at one of the places before mentioned. This memorial having  been laid before the king by the Earl of Shelburne (now the Marquess  of Lansdown), one of the principal secretaries of state; his majesty  graciously signified his pleasure to the lords commissioners of the  Admiralty, that they should provide a ship for carrying over such  observers as the Royal Society should judge proper to send to the  South Seas; and, on the 3rd of April, Mr. Stephens informed the  society that a bark had been taken up for tire purpose.    The gentlemen who had originally been fixed upon to take the direction  of the expedition, was Alexander Dalrymple, Esq. an eminent member of  the Royal Society, and who, besides possessing an accurate knowledge  of astronomy, had distinguished himself by his inquiries into the  geography of the Southern Oceans, and by the collection he had  published of several voyages to those parts of the world. Mr.  Dalrymple being sensible of the difficulty, or rather of the  impossibility, of carrying a ship through unknown seas, the crew of  which were not subject to the military discipline of his majesty's  navy, he made it the condition of his going, that he should have a  brevet commission, as captain of the vessel, in the same manner as  such a commission had been granted to Dr. Halley, in his voyage of  discovery. To this demand Sir Edward Hawke, who was then at the head  of the Admiralty, and who possessed more of the spirit of his  profession than either of education or science, absolutely refused to  accede. He said, at the board, that his conscience would not allow him  to trust any ship of his majesty's to a person who had not regularly  been bred a seaman. On being further pressed upon the subject, Sir  Edward declared, that he would suffer his right hand to be cut off  before he would sign any such commission. In this he was, in some  degree, justified by the mutinous behaviour of Halley's crew, who  refused to acknowledge the legal authority of their commander, and  involved him in a dispute which was attended with pernicious  consequences. Mr. Dalrymple, on the other hand, was equally steady in  requiring a compliance with the terms he had proposed. Such was the  state of things, when Mr. Stephens, secretary to the Admiralty, whose  discrimination of the numerous characters, with which by his station  he is conversant, reflects as much credit on his understanding, as his  upright and able conduct does on the office he has filled for so many  years, and under so many administrations, with honour to himself and  advantage to the public, observed to the board, that since Sir Edward  Hawke and Mr. Dalrymple were equally inflexible, no method remained  but that of finding out another person capable of the service. He  knew, he said, a Mr. Cook, who had been employed as marine surveyor of  Newfoundland, who had been regularly educated in the navy, in which he  was a master, and whom he judged to be fully qualified for the  direction of the present undertaking. Mr. Stephens, at the same time,  recommended it to the board, to take the opinion of Sir Hugh Palliser,  who had lately been governor of Newfoundland, and was intimately  acquainted with Cook's character. Sir Hugh rejoiced in the opportunity  of serving his friend. He strengthened Mr. Stephen's recommendation to  the utmost of his power; and added many things in Mr. Cook's favour,  arising from the particular knowledge which he had of his abilities  and merit. Accordingly, Mr. Cook was appointed to the command of the  expedition by the lords of the Admiralty; and, on this occasion, he  was promoted to the rank of a lieutenant in the royal navy, his  commission bearing date on the 25th of May, 1768.    When the appointment had taken place, the first object was to provide  a vessel adapted to the purposes of the voyage. This business was  committed to Sir Hugh Palliser; who took Lieutenant Cook to his  assistance, and they examined together a great number of the ships  which then lay in the river Thames. At length they fixed upon one, of  three hundred and seventy tons, to which was given the name of the  Endeavour.    While preparations were making for Lieutenant Cook's expedition,  Captain Wallis returned from his voyage round the world. The Earl of  Morton, president of the Royal Society, had recommended it to this  gentleman, on his going out, to fix upon a proper place for observing  the transit of Venus. He kept, accordingly, the object in view: and  having discovered, in the course of his enterprise, an island called  by him George's Island, but which has since been found to bear the  name of Otaheite, he judged that Port Royal harbour in this island  would afford an eligible situation for the purpose. Having,  immediately on his return to England, signified his opinion to the  Earl of Morton, the captain's idea was adopted by the society, and an  answer conformable to it was sent to the commissioners of the  Admiralty, who had applied for directions to what place the observers,  should be sent.    Mr. Charles Green, a gentleman who had long been assistant to Dr.  Bradley at the royal observatory at Greenwich, was united by  Lieutenant Cook in conducting the astronomical part of the voyage;  and, soon after their appointment, they received ample instructions,  from the council of the Royal Society, with regard to the method of  carrying on their inquiries. The lieutenant was also accompanied by  Joseph Banks, Esq. (now Sir Joseph Banks, Bart.) and Dr. Solander,  who, in the prime of life, and the first of them at great expense to  himself, quitted all the gratifications of polished society, and  engaged in a very tedious, fatiguing, and hazardous navigation, with  the laudable views of acquiring knowledge in general, of promoting  natural knowledge in particular, and of contributing something to the  improvement and the happiness of the rude inhabitants of the earth.    Though it was the principal, it was not the sole object of Lieutenant  Cook's voyage to observe the transit of Venus. A more accurate  examination of the Pacific Ocean was committed to him, although in  subserviency to his main design; and, when his chief business was  accomplished, he was directed to proceed in making farther discoveries  in the great Southern Seas.    The complement of Lieutenant Cook's ship consisted of eighty-four  persons besides the commander. Her victualling was for eighteen  months; and there was put on board of her ten carriage and ten swivel  guns, together with an ample store of ammunition and other  necessaries.    On the 25th of May, 1768, Lieutenant Cook was appointed, by the lords  of the Admiralty, to the command of the Endeavour, in consequence of  which he went on board on the 27th, and took charge of the ship. She  then lay in the bason in Deptford-yard, where she continued to lie  till she was completely fitted for sea. On the 30th of July she sailed  down the river, and on the 13th of August anchored in Plymouth Sound.  The wind becoming fair on the 26th of that month, our navigators got  under sail, and on the 13th of September anchored in Funchiale Road,  in the island of Madeira.    While Lieutenant Cook and his company were in this island, they were  treated with the utmost kindness and liberality by Mr. Cheap, the  English consul there, and one of the most considerable merchants in  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7787"],[0,"A Complete Grammar of Esperanto (#4)"],[1,"ng.     fresxa = fresh.                    sur = on.     gxardeno = garden.                 sxajnas = seems, seem.     kampo = field.                     verda = green.

TRANSITIVE VERBS.    22. The verbs so far given have been \"intransitive verbs\", expressing a  state or an action limited to the subject, and not immediately affecting  any other person or thing, as \"la knabo kuras\", the boy runs. On the  other hand a \"transitive verb\" expresses an act of the subject upon some  person or thing; as, \"la knabo trovas -- --\", the boy finds -- --.                                THE ACCUSATIVE CASE.    23. The person or thing acted upon is called the \"direct object\" of  a transitive verb, and is given the ending \"-n\". This is called the  accusative ending; and the word to which it is attached is said to be  in the \"accusative case\":       La viro havas segxon, the man has a chair.     La knabo trovas florojn, the boy finds flowers.    [Footnote: The ending \"-n\" follows the ending \"-j\", if the word to be  put in the accusative case is in the plural number.]    24. An attributive adjective modifying a noun in the accusative case is  made to agree in case, by addition of the same accusative ending \"-n\".  This prevents any doubt as to which of two or more nouns in a sentence  is modified by the adjective, and permits of variation in the order of  the words:       La knabo trovas belan floron, the boy finds a beautiful flower.     Florojn belajn la viro havas, the man has beautiful flowers.     La viro havas grandan segxon, the man has a large chair.     Rugxan rozon la knabo havas, the boy has a red rose.    25. A predicate adjective or noun (19) is never in the accusative case,  nor is the accusative ending ever attached to the article, which is  invariable as stated in 18.                               THE CONJUNCTION \"KAJ\".    26. In the expression \"both ... and ...\", the conjunction \"kaj\" is used  for both words, being merely repeated:       La viro kaj marsxas kaj kuras, the man both walks and runs.     La cxevalo estas kaj granda kaj forta,        the horse is both large and strong.     La knabo havas kaj rozojn kaj violojn,        the boy has both roses and violets.     Kaj la knabo kaj la viro estas altaj,        both the boy and the man are tall.                                 THE NEGATIVE \"NE\".    27. The negative word meaning \"not\" when forming part of a sentence,  and \"no\" when used as an answer to a question, is \"ne\". When used as  a sentence-negative, it usually immediately precedes the verb. For  emphatic negation of some other word than the verb, \"ne\" may precede  that word:       Violoj ne estas rugxaj, violets are not red.     La viroj ne sidas sur segxoj, the men are-not-sitting on chairs.     La kolombo kantas, ne flugas, the dove is-singing, not flying.     La domo estas blanka, ne verda, the house is white, not green.

The infinitive is a form of the verb which expresses merely the  general idea of the action or condition indicated, and has some of the  characteristics of a noun. The ending of the infinitive is \"-i\", as  \"kuri\", to run, \"esti\", to be, \"havi\", to have.    29. An infinitive used to complete the meaning of another verb, serving  as a direct object to a transitive verb, is called a \"complementary  infinitive\". If the complementary infinitive is from a transitive verb,  it may itself have a direct object:       La knabo volas kuri, the boy wishes to run.     Birdoj sxatas kanti, birds like to sing.     La knabo volas havi cxevalon, the boy wishes to have a horse.     Ili volas trovi florojn, they wish to find flowers.                                   INTERROGATION.    30. An interrogative sentence is one which asks a question. Unless some  directly interrogative word (as \"who,\" \"when,\" \"why,\" etc.) is used,  the sentence is rendered interrogative by use of the word \"cxu\". This  interrogative particle is placed at the beginning of a sentence, the  words of which are left in the same order as for a statement. Since  there is no inversion of order, there is no necessity for a word like  English \"do\" or \"does,\" to introduce the verb:       Cxu la knabo estas bona? Is the boy good?     Cxu ili havas florojn? Have they flowers?     Cxu la kolomboj kantas? Do the doves sing? (Are the doves singing?)                               THE CONJUNCTION \"NEK\".    31. In the expression \"neither ... nor ...\", the conjunction \"nek\"  is used for both words. Since an adjective modifier of two or more  words connected by \"nek\" must necessarily modify them separately,  the adjective remains in the singular number:       Ili nek marsxas nek kuras, they neither walk nor run.     La viro havas nek domon nek gxardenon,        the man has neither a house nor a garden.     Nek la rozo nek la violo estas verda,        neither the rose nor the violet is green.                                     VOCABULARY            (Verbs will hereafter be quoted in the infinitive form.)       bruna = brown.                     matura = ripe.     cxerizo = cherry.                  Mario = Mary.     cxu = (30).                        nek = neither, nor.     dolcxa = sweet.                    persiko = peach.     gusto = taste.                     jes = yes.     gxi = it.                          preferi = to prefer.     Gertrude = Gertrude.               sxati = to like.     knabino = girl.                    voli = to wish.                                  READING LESSON.    1. Cxu persiko estas rugxa? 2.
