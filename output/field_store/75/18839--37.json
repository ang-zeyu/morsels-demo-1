Of chouse you  don't remember it.\"    \"But who are they, papa?\"    \"Mrs. Page was your dear mother's second cousin; and at one time she  lived in your grandfather's family, and was like a sister to mamma and  Uncle Charles.  It is a good many years since I have seen her.  Mr.  Page is a railroad engineer.  He is coming this way on business, and  they will stop for a few days with us.  Your Cousin Olivia writes that  she is anxious to see all you children.  Have every thing as nice as  you can, Katy.\"    \"Of course, I will.  What day are the coming?\"    \"Thursday,--no, Friday,\" replied Dr. Carr, consulting the letter,  \"Friday evening, at half-past six.  Order something substantial for  tea that night, Katy.  They'll be hungry after traveling.\"    Katy worked with a will for the next two days.  Twenty times, at least,  she went into the blue room to make sure that nothing was forgotten;  repeating, as if it had been a lesson in geography: \"Bath towels, face  towels, matches, soap, candles, cologne, extra blanket, ink.\"  A nice  little fire was lighted in the bedroom on Friday afternoon, and a big,  beautiful one in the parlor, which looked very pleasant with the lamp  lit and Clover's geraniums and china roses in the window.  The tea-  table was set with the best linen and the pink-and-white china.  Debby's muffins were very light.  The crab-apple jelly came out of  its mould clear and whole, and the cold chicken looked appetizing,  with its green wreath of parsley.  There was stewed potato, too, and,  of course, oysters.  Everybody in Burnet had oysters for tea when  company was expected.  They were counted a special treat; because  they were rather dear, and could not always be procured.  Burnet  was a thousand miles from the sea, so the oysters were of the tin-  can variety.  The cans gave the oysters a curious taste,--tinny, or  was it more like solder?  At all events, Burnet people liked it, and  always insisted that it was a striking improvement on the flavor  which oysters have on their native shores.  Every thing was as nice  as could be, when Katy stood in the dining-room to take a last look  at her arrangements; and she hoped papa would be pleased, and that  mamma's cousin would think her a good housekeeper.    \"I don't want to have on my other jacket,\" observed Phil, putting his  head in at the door.  \"Need I?  This is nice.\"    \"Let me see,\" said Katy, gently turning him round.  \"Well, it does  pretty well; but I think I'd rather you should put on the other, if  you don't mind much.  We want every thing as nice as possible, you  know; because this is papa's company, and he hardly ever has any.\"    \"Just one little sticky place isn't much,\" said Phil, rather gloomily,  wetting his finger a rubbing at a shiny place on his sleeve.  \"Do you  really thing I'd better?  Well, then I will.\"    \"That's a dear,\"--kissing him.  \"Be quick, Philly, for it's almost  time they were here.  And please tell Dorry to make haste.  It's  ever so long since he went upstairs.\"    \"Dorry's an awful prink,\" remarked Phil, confidentially.  \"He looks  in the glass, and makes faces if he can't get his parting straight.  I wouldn't care so much about my clothes for a good deal.  It's like  a girl.  Jim Slack says a boy who shines his hair up like that,  never'll get to be president, not if he lives a thousand years.\"    \"Well,\" said Katy, laughing: \"it's something to be clean, even if you  can't be president.\"  She was not at all alarmed by Dorry's recent  reaction in favor of personal adornment.  He came down pretty soon,  very spick and span in his best suit, and asked her to fasten the  blue ribbon under his collar, which she did most obligingly; though  he was very particular as to the size of the bows and length of the  ends, and made her tie and retie more than once.  She had just  arranged it to suit him when a carriage stopped.    \"There they are,\" she cried.  \"Run and open the door, Dorry.\"    Dorry did so; and Katy, following, found papa ushering in a tall  gentleman, and a lady who was not tall, but whose Roman nose and  long neck, and general air of style and fashion, made her look so.  Katy bent quite over to be kissed; but for all that she felt small  and young and unformed, as the eyes of mamma's cousin looked her  over and over, and through and through, and Mrs. Page said,--    \"Why, Philip! is it possible that this tall girl is one of yours?  Dear me! how time flies!  I was thinking of the little creatures I  saw when I was here last.  And this other great creature can't be  Elsie?  That mite of a baby!  Impossible!  I cannot realize it.  I  really cannot realize it in the least.\"    \"Won't you come to the fire, Mrs. Page?\" said Katy, rather timidly.    \"Don't call me Mrs. Page, my dear.  Call me Cousin Olivia.\"  Then the  new-comer rustled into the parlor, where Johnnie and Phil were waiting  to be introduced; and again she remarked that she \"couldn't realize  it.\"  I don't know why Mrs. Page's not realizing it should have made  Katy uncomfortable; but it did.    Supper went off well.  The guests ate and praised; and Dr. Carr looked  pleased, and said: \"We think Katy an excellent housekeeper for her age;\"  at which Katy blushed and was delighted, till she caught Mrs. Page's  eyes fixed upon her, with a look of scrutiny and amusement, whereupon  she felt awkward and ill at ease.  It was so all the evening.  Mamma's  cousin was entertaining and bright, and told lively stories; but the  children felt that she was watching them, and passing judgment on  their ways.  Children are very quick to suspect when older people  hold within themselves these little private courts of inquiry, and  they always resent it.    Next morning Mrs. Page sat by while Katy washed the breakfast things,  fed the birds, and did various odd jobs about the room and house.  \"My  dear,\" she said at last, \"what a solemn girl you are!  I should think  from your face that you were at least five and thirty.  Don't you ever  laugh or frolic, like other girls your age?  Why, my Lilly, who is  four months older than you, is a perfect child still; impulsive as a  baby, bubbling over with fun from morning till night.\"    \"I've been shut up a good deal,\" said Katy, trying to defend herself;  \"but I didn't know I was solemn.\"    \"My dear, that's the very thing I complain of: you don't know it!  You are altogether ahead of your age.  It's very bad for you, in my  opinion.  All this housekeeping and care, for young girls like you  and Clover, is wrong and unnatural.  I don't like it; indeed I don't.\"    \"Oh! housekeeping doesn't hurt me a bit,\" protested Katy, trying to  smile.  \"We have lovely times; indeed we do, Cousin Olivia.\"    Cousin Olivia only pursed up her mouth, and repeated: \"It's wrong, my  dear.  It's unnatural.  It's not the thing for you.  Depend upon it,  it's not the thing.\"    This was unpleasant; but what was worse had Katy known it, Mrs. Page  attacked Dr. Carr upon the subject.  He was quite troubled to learn  that she considered Katy grave and careworn, and unlike what girls  of her age should be.  Katy caught him looking at her with a puzzled  expression.    \"What is it, dear papa?  Do you want anything?\"    \"No, child, nothing.  What are you doing there?  Mending the parlor  curtain, eh?  Can't old Mary attend to that, and give you a chance  to frisk about with the other girls?\"    \"Papa!  As if I wanted to frisk!  I declare you're as bad as Cousin  Olivia.  She's always telling me that I ought to bubble over with  mirth.  I don't wish to bubble.  I don't know how.\"    \"I'm afraid you don't,\" said Dr. Carr, with an odd sigh, which set  Katy to wondering.  What should papa sigh for?  Had she done any  thing wrong?  She began to rack her brains and memory as to whether  it could be this or that; or, if not, what could it be?  Such needless  self-examination does no good.  Katy looked more \"solemn\" than ever  after it.    Altogether, Mrs. Page was not a favorite in the family.  She had every  intention of being kind to her cousin's children, \"so dreadfully in  want of a mother, poor things!\" but she could not hide the fact that  their ways puzzled and did not please her; and the children detected  this, as children always will.  She and Mr. Page were very polite.  They praised the housekeeping, and the excellent order or every  thing, and said there never were better children in the world than  John and Dorry and Phil.  But, through all, Katy perceived the hidden  disapproval; and she couldn't help feeling glad when the visit ended,  and they went away.    With their departure, matters went back to their old train, and Katy  forgot her disagreeable feelings.  Papa seemed a little grave and  preoccupied; but the doctors often are when they have bad cases to  think of, and nobody noticed it particularly, or remarked that several  letters came from Mrs. Page, and nothing was heard of their contents,  except that \"Cousin Olivia sent her love.\"  So it was a shock, when  one day papa called Katy into the study to tell of a new plan.  She  knew at once that it was something important when she heard his voice:  it sounded so grave.  Beside, he said \"My daughter,\" he began, \"I want  to talk to you about something which I have been thinking of.  How  would you and Clover like going away to school together?\"    \"To school?  To Mrs. Knight's?\"    \"No, not to Mrs. Knight's.  To a boarding-school at the East, where  Lilly Page has been for two years.  Didn't you hear Cousin Olivia  speak of it when she was here?\"    \"I believe I did.  But, papa, you won't really?\"    \"Yes, I think so,\" said Dr. Carr, gently.  \"Listen, Katy, and don't  feel so badly, my dear child.  I've thought the plan over carefully;  and it seems to me a good one, though I hate to part from you.  It  is pretty much as your cousin says: these home-cares, which I can't  take from you while you are at home, are making you old before your  time. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51461"],[0,"A Pail of Air (#4)"],[1," of the strangers called a \"survival school.\" Or maybe we will  join the pioneers who are going to try to establish a new colony at the  uranium mines at Great Slave Lake or in the Congo.    Of course, now that the strangers are gone, I've been thinking a  lot about Los Alamos and those other tremendous colonies. I have a  hankering to see them for myself.    You ask me, Pa wants to see them, too. He's been getting pretty  thoughtful, watching Ma and Sis perk up.    \"It's different, now that we know others are alive,\" he explains to me.  \"Your mother doesn't feel so hopeless any more. Neither do I, for that  matter, not having to carry the whole responsibility for keeping the  human race going, so to speak. It scares a person.\"    I looked around at the blanket walls and the fire and the pails of air  boiling away and Ma and Sis sleeping in the warmth and the flickering  light.    \"It's not going to be easy to leave the Nest,\" I said, wanting to cry,  kind of. \"It's so small and there's just the four of us. I get scared  at the idea of big places and a lot of strangers.\"    He nodded and put another piece of coal on the fire. Then he looked at  the little pile and grinned suddenly and put a couple of handfuls on,  just as if it was one of our birthdays or Christmas.    \"You'll quickly get over that feeling son,\" he said. \"The trouble with  the world was that it kept getting smaller and smaller, till it ended  with just the Nest. Now it'll be good to have a real huge world again,  the way it was in the beginning.\"    I guess he's right. You think the beautiful young lady will wait for me  till I grow up? I'll be twenty in only ten years."]]]
