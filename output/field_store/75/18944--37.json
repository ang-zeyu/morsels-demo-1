Ah, yes, to go, and know it not; to separate and  know it not; how could one go peace--fuller than that?  It was  his reward for a cruel life patiently borne.\"    There was a slight noise from the direction of the dim corner where  the ladder was.  It was the king descending.  I could see that he  was bearing something in one arm, and assisting himself with the  other.  He came forward into the light; upon his breast lay a  slender girl of fifteen.  She was but half conscious; she was dying  of smallpox.  Here was heroism at its last and loftiest possibility,  its utmost summit; this was challenging death in the open field  unarmed, with all the odds against the challenger, no reward set  upon the contest, and no admiring world in silks and cloth of gold  to gaze and applaud; and yet the king's bearing was as serenely  brave as it had always been in those cheaper contests where knight  meets knight in equal fight and clothed in protecting steel.  He  was great now; sublimely great.  The rude statues of his ancestors  in his palace should have an addition--I would see to that; and it  would not be a mailed king killing a giant or a dragon, like the  rest, it would be a king in commoner's garb bearing death in his  arms that a peasant mother might look her last upon her child and  be comforted.    He laid the girl down by her mother, who poured out endearments  and caresses from an overflowing heart, and one could detect a  flickering faint light of response in the child's eyes, but that  was all.  The mother hung over her, kissing her, petting her, and  imploring her to speak, but the lips only moved and no sound came.  I snatched my liquor flask from my knapsack, but the woman forbade  me, and said:    \"No--she does not suffer; it is better so.  It might bring her back  to life.  None that be so good and kind as ye are would do her  that cruel hurt.  For look you--what is left to live for?  Her  brothers are gone, her father is gone, her mother goeth, the  Church's curse is upon her, and none may shelter or befriend her  even though she lay perishing in the road.  She is desolate.  I have  not asked you, good heart, if her sister be still on live, here  overhead; I had no need; ye had gone back, else, and not left  the poor thing forsaken--\"    \"She lieth at peace,\" interrupted the king, in a subdued voice.    \"I would not change it.  How rich is this day in happiness!  Ah,  my Annis, thou shalt join thy sister soon--thou'rt on thy way,  and these be merciful friends that will not hinder.\"    And so she fell to murmuring and cooing over the girl again, and  softly stroking her face and hair, and kissing her and calling her  by endearing names; but there was scarcely sign of response now  in the glazing eyes.  I saw tears well from the king's eyes, and  trickle down his face.  The woman noticed them, too, and said:    \"Ah, I know that sign: thou'st a wife at home, poor soul, and  you and she have gone hungry to bed, many's the time, that the  little ones might have your crust; you know what poverty is, and  the daily insults of your betters, and the heavy hand of the Church  and the king.\"    The king winced under this accidental home-shot, but kept still;  he was learning his part; and he was playing it well, too, for  a pretty dull beginner.  I struck up a diversion.  I offered the  woman food and liquor, but she refused both.  She would allow  nothing to come between her and the release of death.  Then I slipped  away and brought the dead child from aloft, and laid it by her.  This broke her down again, and there was another scene that was  full of heartbreak.  By and by I made another diversion, and beguiled  her to sketch her story.    \"Ye know it well yourselves, having suffered it--for truly none  of our condition in Britain escape it.  It is the old, weary tale.  We fought and struggled and succeeded; meaning by success, that  we lived and did not die; more than that is not to be claimed.  No  troubles came that we could not outlive, till this year brought  them; then came they all at once, as one might say, and overwhelmed  us.  Years ago the lord of the manor planted certain fruit trees on  our farm; in the best part of it, too--a grievous wrong and shame--\"    \"But it was his right,\" interrupted the king.    \"None denieth that, indeed; an the law mean anything, what is  the lord's is his, and what is mine is his also.  Our farm was  ours by lease, therefore 'twas likewise his, to do with it as he  would.  Some little time ago, three of those trees were found hewn  down.  Our three grown sons ran frightened to report the crime.  Well, in his lordship's dungeon there they lie, who saith there  shall they lie and rot till they confess.  They have naught to  confess, being innocent, wherefore there will they remain until  they die.  Ye know that right well, I ween.  Think how this left us;  a man, a woman and two children, to gather a crop that was planted  by so much greater force, yes, and protect it night and day from  pigeons and prowling animals that be sacred and must not be hurt  by any of our sort.  When my lord's crop was nearly ready for  the harvest, so also was ours; when his bell rang to call us to  his fields to harvest his crop for nothing, he would not allow that  I and my two girls should count for our three captive sons, but  for only two of them; so, for the lacking one were we daily fined.  All this time our own crop was perishing through neglect; and so  both the priest and his lordship fined us because their shares  of it were suffering through damage.  In the end the fines ate up  our crop--and they took it all; they took it all and made us harvest  it for them, without pay or food, and we starving.  Then the worst  came when I, being out of my mind with hunger and loss of my boys,  and grief to see my husband and my little maids in rags and misery  and despair, uttered a deep blasphemy--oh! a thousand of them!  --against the Church and the Church's ways.  It was ten days ago.  I had fallen sick with this disease, and it was to the priest  I said the words, for he was come to chide me for lack of due  humility under the chastening hand of God.  He carried my trespass  to his betters; I was stubborn; wherefore, presently upon my head  and upon all heads that were dear to me, fell the curse of Rome.    \"Since that day we are avoided, shunned with horror.  None has  come near this hut to know whether we live or not.  The rest of us  were taken down.  Then I roused me and got up, as wife and mother  will.  It was little they could have eaten in any case; it was  less than little they had to eat.  But there was water, and I gave  them that.  How they craved it! and how they blessed it!  But the  end came yesterday; my strength broke down.  Yesterday was the  last time I ever saw my husband and this youngest child alive.  I have lain here all these hours--these ages, ye may say--listening,  listening for any sound up there that--\"    She gave a sharp quick glance at her eldest daughter, then cried  out, \"Oh, my darling!\" and feebly gathered the stiffening form  to her sheltering arms.  She had recognized the death-rattle.        CHAPTER XXX    THE TRAGEDY OF THE MANOR-HOUSE    At midnight all was over, and we sat in the presence of four  corpses.  We covered them with such rags as we could find, and  started away, fastening the door behind us.  Their home must be  these people's grave, for they could not have Christian burial,  or be admitted to consecrated ground.  They were as dogs, wild  beasts, lepers, and no soul that valued its hope of eternal life  would throw it away by meddling in any sort with these rebuked and  smitten outcasts.    We had not moved four steps when I caught a sound as of footsteps  upon gravel.  My heart flew to my throat.  We must not be seen  coming from that house.  I plucked at the king's robe and we drew  back and took shelter behind the corner of the cabin.    \"Now we are safe,\" I said, \"but it was a close call--so to speak.  If the night had been lighter he might have seen us, no doubt,  he seemed to be so near.\"    \"Mayhap it is but a beast and not a man at all.\"    \"True.  But man or beast, it will be wise to stay here a minute  and let it get by and out of the way.\"    \"Hark!  It cometh hither.\"    True again.  The step was coming toward us--straight toward the hut.  It must be a beast, then, and we might as well have saved our  trepidation.  I was going to step out, but the king laid his hand  upon my arm.  There was a moment of silence, then we heard a soft  knock on the cabin door.  It made me shiver.  Presently the knock  was repeated, and then we heard these words in a guarded voice:    \"Mother!  Father!  Open--we have got free, and we bring news to  pale your cheeks but glad your hearts; and we may not tarry, but  must fly!  And--but they answer not.  Mother! father!--\"    I drew the king toward the other end of the hut and whispered:    \"Come--now we can get to the road.\"    The king hesitated, was going to demur; but just then we heard  the door give way, and knew that those desolate men were in the  presence of their dead.    \"Come, my liege! in a moment they will strike a light, and then  will follow that which it would break your heart to hear.\"    He did not hesitate this time.  The moment we were in the road  I ran; and after a moment he threw dignity aside and followed.  I did not want to think of what was happening in the hut--I couldn't  bear it; I wanted to drive it out of my mind; so I struck into the  first subject that lay under that one in my mind:    \"I have had the disease those people died of, and so have nothing  to fear; but if you have not had it also--\"    He broke in upon me to say he was in trouble, and it was his  conscience that was troubling him:    \"These young men have got free, they say--but _how_?  It is not  likely that their lord hath set them free.\"    \"Oh, no, I make no doubt they escaped.\"    \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7248"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 7. (#4)"],[1," one month at a time,  if he wants to.\"    \"What?\"    \"It's true.  Moreover, a magistrate won't be able to force a man  to work for a master a whole year on a stretch whether the man  wants to or not.\"    \"Will there be _no_ law or sense in that day?\"    \"Both of them, Dowley.  In that day a man will be his own property,  not the property of magistrate and master.  And he can leave town  whenever he wants to, if the wages don't suit him!--and they can't  put him in the pillory for it.\"    \"Perdition catch such an age!\" shouted Dowley, in strong indignation.  \"An age of dogs, an age barren of reverence for superiors and  respect for authority!  The pillory--\"    \"Oh, wait, brother; say no good word for that institution.  I think  the pillory ought to be abolished.\"    \"A most strange idea.  Why?\"    \"Well, I'll tell you why.  Is a man ever put in the pillory for  a capital crime?\"    \"No.\"    \"Is it right to condemn a man to a slight punishment for a small  offense and then kill him?\"    There was no answer.  I had scored my first point!  For the first  time, the smith wasn't up and ready.  The company noticed it.  Good effect.    \"You don't answer, brother.  You were about to glorify the pillory  a while ago, and shed some pity on a future age that isn't going  to use it.  I think the pillory ought to be abolished.  What  usually happens when a poor fellow is put in the pillory for some  little offense that didn't amount to anything in the world?  The  mob try to have some fun with him, don't they?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"They begin by clodding him; and they laugh themselves to pieces  to see him try to dodge one clod and get hit with another?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then they throw dead cats at him, don't they?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, then, suppose he has a few personal enemies in that mob  and here and there a man or a woman with a secret grudge against  him--and suppose especially that he is unpopular in the community,  for his pride, or his prosperity, or one thing or another--stones  and bricks take the place of clods and cats presently, don't they?\"    \"There is no doubt of it.\"    \"As a rule he is crippled for life, isn't he?--jaws broken, teeth  smashed out?--or legs mutilated, gangrened, presently cut off?  --or an eye knocked out, maybe both eyes?\"    \"It is true, God knoweth it.\"    \"And if he is unpopular he can depend on _dying_, right there in  the stocks, can't he?\"    \"He surely can!  One may not deny it.\"    \"I take it none of _you_ are unpopular--by reason of pride or  insolence, or conspicuous prosperity, or any of those things that  excite envy and malice among the base scum of a village?  _You_  wouldn't think it much of a risk to take a chance in the stocks?\"    Dowley winced, visibly.  I judged he was hit.  But he didn't betray  it by any spoken word.  As for the others, they spoke out plainly,  and with strong feeling.  They said they had seen enough of the  stocks to know what a man's chance in them was, and they would  never consent to enter them if they could compromise on a quick  death by hanging.    \"Well, to change the subject--for I think I've established my  point that the stocks ought to be abolished.  I think some of our  laws are pretty unfair.  For instance, if I do a thing which ought  to deliver me to the stocks, and you know I did it and yet keep  still and don't report me, _you_ will get the stocks if anybody  informs on you.\"    \"Ah, but that would serve you but right,\" said Dowley, \"for you  _must_ inform.  So saith the law.\"    The others coincided.    \"Well, all right, let it go, since you vote me down.  But there's  one thing which certainly isn't fair.  The magistrate fixes a  mechanic's wage at one cent a day, for instance.  The law says that  if any master shall venture, even under utmost press of business,  to pay anything _over_ that cent a day, even for a single day, he  shall be both fined and pilloried for it; and whoever knows he did  it and doesn't inform, they also shall be fined and pilloried.  Now  it seems to me unfair, Dowley, and a deadly peril to all of us,  that because you thoughtlessly confessed, a while ago, that within  a week you have paid a cent and fifteen mil--\"    Oh, I tell _you_ it was a smasher!  You ought to have seen them to  go to pieces, the whole gang.  I had just slipped up on poor  smiling and complacent Dowley so nice and easy and softly, that  he never suspected anything was going to happen till the blow  came crashing down and knocked him all to rags.    A fine effect.  In fact, as fine as any I ever produced, with so  little time to work it up in.    But I saw in a moment that I had overdone the thing a little.  I was expecting to scare them, but I wasn't expecting to scare  them to death.  They were mighty near it, though.  You see they  had been a whole lifetime learning to appreciate the pillory; and  to have that thing staring them in the face, and every one of them  distinctly at the mercy of me, a stranger, if I chose to go and  report--well, it was awful, and they couldn't seem to recover  from the shock, they couldn't seem to pull themselves together.  Pale, shaky, dumb, pitiful?  Why, they weren't any better than  so many dead men.  It was very uncomfortable.  Of course, I thought  they would appeal to me to keep mum, and then we would shake hands,  and take a drink all round, and laugh it off, and there an end.  But no; you see I was an unknown person, among a cruelly oppressed  and suspicious people, a people always accustomed to having advantage  taken of their helplessness, and never expecting just or kind  treatment from any but their own families and very closest intimates.  Appeal to _me_ to be gentle, to be fair, to be generous?  Of course,  they wanted to, but they couldn't dare.        CHAPTER XXXIV    THE YANKEE AND THE KING SOLD AS SLAVES    Well, what had I better do?  Nothing in a hurry, sure.  I must  get up a diversion; anything to employ me while I could think,  and while these poor fellows could have a chance to come to life  again.  There sat Marco, petrified in the act of trying to get  the hang of his miller-gun--turned to stone, just in the attitude  he was in when my pile-driver fell, the toy still gripped in his  unconscious fingers.  So I took it from him and proposed to explain  its mystery.  Mystery! a simple little thing like that; and yet it  was mysterious enough, for that race and that age.    I never saw such an awkward people, with machinery; you see, they  were totally unused to it.  The miller-gun was a little double-barreled  tube of toughened glass, with a neat little trick of a spring  to it, which upon pressure would let a shot escape.  But the shot  wouldn't hurt anybody, it would only drop into your hand.  In the  gun were two sizes--wee mustard-seed shot, and another sort that  were several times larger.  They were money.  The mustard-seed  shot represented milrays, the larger ones mills.  So the gun was  a purse; and very handy, too; you could pay out money in the dark  with it, with accuracy; and you could carry it in your mouth; or  in your vest pocket, if you had one.  I made them of several sizes  --one size so large that it would carry the equivalent of a dollar.  Using shot for money was a good thing for the government; the metal  cost nothing, and the money couldn't be counterfeited, for I was  the only person in the kingdom who knew how to manage a shot tower.  \"Paying the shot\" soon came to be a common phrase.  Yes, and I knew  it would still be passing men's lips, away down in the nineteenth  century, yet none would suspect how and when it originated.    The king joined us, about this time, mightily refreshed by his nap,  and feeling good.  Anything could make me nervous now, I was so  uneasy--for our lives were in danger; and so it worried me to  detect a complacent something in the king's eye which seemed to  indicate that he had been loading himself up for a performance  of some kind or other; confound it, why must he go and choose  such a time as this?    I was right.  He began, straight off, in the most innocently  artful, and transparent, and lubberly way, to lead up to the  subject of agriculture.  The cold sweat broke out all over me.  I wanted to whisper in his ear, \"Man, we are in awful danger!  every moment is worth a principality till we get back these men's  confidence; _don't_ waste any of this golden time.\"  But of course  I couldn't do it.  Whisper to him?  It would look as if we were  conspiring.  So I had to sit there and look calm and pleasant while  the king stood over that dynamite mine and mooned along about his  damned onions and things.  At first the tumult of my own thoughts,  summoned by the danger-signal and swarming to the rescue from  every quarter of my skull, kept up such a hurrah and confusion  and fifing and drumming that I couldn't take in a word; but  presently when my mob of gathering plans began to crystallize  and fall into position and form line of battle, a sort of order and  quiet ensued and I caught the boom of the king's batteries, as if  out of remote distance:    \"--were not the best way, methinks, albeit it is not to be denied  that authorities differ as concerning this point, some contending  that the onion is but an unwholesome berry when stricken early  from the tree--\"    The audience showed signs of life, and sought each other's eyes  in a surprised and troubled way.    \"--whileas others do yet maintain, with much show of reason, that  this is not of necessity the case, instancing that plums and other  like cereals do be always dug in the unripe state--\"    The audience exhibited distinct distress; yes, and also fear.    \"--yet are they clearly wholesome, the more especially when one  doth assuage the asperities of their nature by admixture of the  tranquilizing juice of the wayward cabbage--\"    The wild light of terror began to glow in these men's eyes, and  one of them muttered, \"These be errors, every one--God hath surely"]]]
