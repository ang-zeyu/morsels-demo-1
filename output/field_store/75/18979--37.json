All             that cometh is vanity.    21:011:009 Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer             thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine             heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for             all these things God will bring thee into judgment.    21:011:010 Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from             thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.    21:012:001 Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the             evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt             say, I have no pleasure in them;    21:012:002 While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not             darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:    21:012:003 In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and             the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease             because they are few, and those that look out of the windows             be darkened,    21:012:004 And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of             the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the             bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;    21:012:005 Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and             fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish,             and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail:             because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about             the streets:    21:012:006 Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be             broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel             broken at the cistern.    21:012:007 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the             spirit shall return unto God who gave it.    21:012:008 Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.    21:012:009 And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught             the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out,             and set in order many proverbs.    21:012:010 The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that             which was written was upright, even words of truth.    21:012:011 The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by             the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.    21:012:012 And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many             books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the             flesh.    21:012:013 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and             keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.    21:012:014 For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every             secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/808"],[0,"The Complete Plays of Gilbert and Sullivan (#4)"],[1,"of a    gondolier.  I can give you his addressI see him every day!  In    the entire annals of our history there is absolutely no    circumstance so entirely free from all manner of doubt of any    kind whatever!  Listen, and I'll tell you all about it.                             SONGDON ALHAMBRA                (with DUKE, DUCHESS, CASILDA, and LUIZ).           I stole the Prince, and I brought him here,              And left him gaily prattling         With a highly respectable gondolier,         Who promised the Royal babe to rear,         And teach him the trade of a timoneer              With his own beloved bratling.                     Both of the babes were strong and stout,                        And, considering all things, clever.                   Of that there is no manner of doubt                   No probable, possible shadow of doubt                        No possible doubt whatever.      ALL.                No possible doubt whatever.           But owing, I'm much disposed to fear,              To his terrible taste for tippling,         That highly respectable gondolier         Could never declare with a mind sincere         Which of the two was his offspring dear,              And which the Royal stripling!                     Which was which he could never make out                        Despite his best endeavour.                   Of that there is no manner of doubt                   No probable, possible shadow of doubt                        No possible doubt whatever.      ALL.                No possible doubt whatever.           Time sped, and when at the end of a year              I sought that infant cherished,         That highly respectable gondolier         Was lying a corpse on his humble bier         I dropped a Grand Inquisitor's tear              That gondolier had perished.                     A taste for drink, combined with gout,                        Had doubled him up for ever.                   Of that there is no manner of doubt                   No probable, possible shadow of doubt                        No possible doubt whatever.      ALL.                No possible doubt whatever.           The children followed his old career              (This statement can't be parried)         Of a highly respectable gondolier:         Well, one of the two (who will soon be here)         But which of the two is not quite clear              Is the Royal Prince you married!                     Search in and out and round about,                        And you'll discover never                        A tale so free from every doubt                   All probable, possible shadow of doubt                   All possible doubt whatever!      ALL.                A tale free from every doubt, etc.           CAS.  Then do you mean to say that I am married to one of    two gondoliers, but it is impossible to say which?         DON AL.  Without any doubt of any kind whatever.  But be    reassured: the nurse to whom your husband was entrusted is the    mother of the musical young man who is such a past-master of that    delicately modulated instrument (indicating the drum).  She can,    no doubt, establish the King's identity beyond all question.         LUIZ.  Heavens, how did he know that?         DON AL.  My young friend, a Grand Inquisitor is always up to    date.  (To Cas.)  His mother is at present the wife of a highly    respectable and old-established brigand, who carries on an    extensive practice in the mountains around Cordova.  Accompanied    by two of my emissaries, he will set off at once for his mother's    address.  She will return with them, and if she finds any    difficulty in making up her mind, the persuasive influence of the    torture chamber will jog her memory.                    RECITATIVECASILDA and DON ALHAMBRA.      CAS.      But, bless my heart, consider my position!                   I am the wife of one, that's very clear;              But who can tell, except by intuition,                   Which is the Prince, and which the Gondolier?      DON AL.   Submit to Fate without unseemly wrangle:                   Such complications frequently occur              Life is one closely complicated tangle:                   Death is the only true unraveller!        QUINTETDUKE, DUCHESS, CASILDA, LUIZ, and GRAND INQUISITOR.      ALL.      Try we life-long, we can never                   Straighten out life's tangled skein,              Why should we, in vain endeavour,                   Guess and guess and guess again?      LUIZ.               Life's a pudding full of plums,      DUCH.               Care's a canker that benumbs.      ALL.           Life's a pudding full of plums,                   Care's a canker that benumbs.              Wherefore waste our elocution              On impossible solution?              Life's a pleasant institution,                   Let us take it as it comes!                Set aside the dull enigma,                   We shall guess it all too soon;              Failure brings no kind of stigma                   Dance we to another tune!      LUIZ.               String the lyre and fill the cup,      DUCH.               Lest on sorrow we should sup.      ALL.      Hop and skip to Fancy's fiddle,              Hands across and down the middle              Life's perhaps the only riddle                   That we shrink from giving up!      (Exeunt all into Ducal Palace except Luiz, who goes off in    gondola.)      (Enter Gondoliers and Contadine, followed by Marco, Gianetta,    Giuseppe, and Tessa.)                                   CHORUS.                          Bridegroom and bride!                             Knot that's insoluble,                             Voices all voluble                        Hail it with pride.                        Bridegroom and bride!                             We in sincerity                             Wish you prosperity,                        Bridegroom and bride!                                SONGTESSA.      TESS.          When a merry maiden marries,                   Sorrow goes and pleasure tarries;                        Every sound becomes a song,                        All is right, and nothing's wrong!                   From to-day and ever after                   Let our tears be tears of laughter.                        Every sigh that finds a vent                        Be a sigh of sweet content!                   When you marry, merry maiden,                   Then the air with love is laden;                        Every flower is a rose,                             Every goose becomes a swan,                        Every kind of trouble goes                             Where the last year's snows have gone!      CHORUS.             Sunlight takes the place of shade                             When you marry, merry maid!      TESS.          When a merry maiden marries,                   Sorrow goes and pleasure tarries;                        Every sound becomes a song,                        All is right, and nothing's wrong.                   Gnawing Care and aching Sorrow,                   Get ye gone until to-morrow;                        Jealousies in grim array,                        Ye are things of yesterday!                   When you marry, merry maiden,                   Then the air with joy is laden;                        All the corners of the earth                             Ring with music sweetly played,                        Worry is melodious mirth,                             Grief is joy in masquerade;      CHORUS.             Sullen night is laughing day                        All the year is merry May!      (At the end of the song, Don Alhambra enters at back.  The    Gondoliers and Contadine shrink from him, and gradually go off,    much alarmed.)           GIU. And now our lives are going to begin in real earnest!    What's a bachelor?  A mere nothinghe's a chrysalis.  He can't    be said to livehe exists.         MAR.  What a delightful institution marriage is!  Why have    we wasted all this time?  Why didn't we marry ten years ago?         TESS.  Because you couldn't find anybody nice enough.         GIA.  Because you were waiting for us.         MAR.  I suppose that was the reason.  We were waiting for    you without knowing it.  (Don Alhambra comes forward.)  Hallo!         DON AL.  Good morning.         GIU.  If this gentleman is an undertaker it's a bad omen.         DON AL.  Ceremony of some sort going on?         GIU. (aside).  He is an undertaker!  (Aloud.)  Noa little    unimportant family gathering.  Nothing in your line.         DON AL.  Somebody's birthday, I suppose?         GIA.  Yes, mine!         TESS.  And mine!         MAR.  And mine!         GIU.  And mine!         DON AL.  Curious coincidence!  And how old may you all be?         TESS.  It's a rude questionbut about ten minutes.         DON AL.  Remarkably fine children!  But surely you are    jesting?         TESS.  In other words, we were married about ten minutes    since.         DON AL.  Married!  You don't mean to say you are married?         MAR.  Oh yes, we are married.         DON AL.  What, both of you?         ALL.  All four of us.         DON AL. (aside).  Bless my heart, how extremely awkward!         GIA.  You don't mind, I suppose?         TESS.  You were not thinking of either of us for yourself, I    presume?  Oh, Giuseppe, look at himhe was.  He's heart-broken!         DON AL.  No, no, I wasn't!  I wasn't!         GIU.  Now, my man (slapping him on the back), we don't want    anything in your line to-day, and if your curiosity's    satisfiedyou can go!         DON AL.  You mustn't call me your man.  It's a liberty.  I    don't think you know who I am.         GIU.  Not we, indeed!  We are jolly gondoliers, the sons of    Baptisto Palmieri, who led the last revolution.  Republicans,    heart and soul, we hold all men to be"]]]
