When the fighting opened on the next day, Agamemnon distinguished  himself by deeds of great bravery, but retired at length wounded in the  hand. Zeus had warned Hector to wait for that very moment before pushing  home his attack. One after another the Greek leaders were wounded,  Diomedes, Odysseus, Machaon; Ajax alone held up the Trojan onset,  retiring slowly and stubbornly towards the sea. Achilles, seeing the  return of the wounded warrior Machaon, sent his friend Patroclus to find  out who he was. Nestor meeting Patroclus, told him of the rout of the  army, and advised him to beg Achilles at least to allow the Myrmidons  to sally forth under Patroclus' leadership, if he would not fight in  person. The importance of this episode is emphasised in the poem. The  dispatch of Patroclus is called \"the beginning of his undoing\", it  foreshadows the intervention which was later to bring Achilles himself  back into the conflict.    The Trojan host after an attempt to drive their horses over the trench  stormed it in five bodies. As they streamed towards the wall, an omen of  a doubtful nature filled Polydamas with some misgivings about the wisdom  of bursting through to the sea. It was possible that they might be  routed and that they would accordingly be caught in a trap, leaving many  of their dead behind them. His advice to remain content with the success  they had won roused the anger of Hector, whose headstrong character is  well portrayed in his speech.        \"Thou biddest me consider long-winged birds, whereof I reck not nor      care for them whether they speed to right or left. Let us obey the      counsel of Zeus. One omen is the best, to fight for our country. Why      dost thou dread war and tumult? Even if all we others were slain at      the ships, there is no fear that thou wilt perish, for thy heart      cannot withstand the foe and is not warlike. But if thou holdest from      the fight or turnest another from war, straightway shalt thou lose      thy life under the blow of my spear.\"    Thus encouraged the army pressed forward, the walls being pierced by the  Lycian King Sarpedon, a son of Zeus. Taking up a mighty stone, Hector  broke open the gate and led his men forward to the final onslaught on  the ships.    For a brief space Zeus turned his eyes away from the conflict and  Poseidon used the opportunity to help the Greeks. Idomeneus the Cretan  and his henchman Meriones greatly distinguished themselves, the former  drawing a very vivid picture of the brave man.        \"I know what courage is. Would that all the bravest of us were being      chosen for an ambush, wherein a man's bravery is most manifest. In      it the coward and the courageous man chiefliest appear. The colour of      the one changeth and his spirit cannot be schooled to remain stedfast,      but he shifteth his body, settling now on this foot now on that; his      heart beateth mightily, knocking against his breast as he bodeth death,      and his teeth chatter. But the good man's colour changeth not, nor is      he overmuch afraid when once he sitteth in his place of ambush; rather      he prayeth to join speedily in the dolorous battle.\"    Yet soon Idomeneus' strength left him; Hector hurried to the centre of  the attack, where he confronted Ajax.    At this point Hera determined to prolong the intervention of Poseidon in  favour of the Greeks. She persuaded Aphrodite to lend her all her spells  of beauty on the pretence that she wished to reconcile Ocean to his wife  Tethys. Armed with the goddess' girdle, she lulled Zeus to sleep  and then sent a message to Poseidon to give the Greeks his heartiest  assistance. Inspired by him the fugitives turned on their pursuers; when  Ajax smote down Hector with a stone the Trojans were hurled in flight  back through the gate and across the ramparts.    When Zeus awakened out of slumber and saw the rout of the Trojans, his  first impulse was to punish Hera for her deceit. He then restored the  situation, bidding Poseidon retire and sending Apollo to recover Hector  of his wound. The tide speedily turned again; the Trojans rushed through  the rampart and down to the outer line of the Greek ships, where they  found nobody to resist them except the giant Ajax and his brother  Teucer. After a desperate fight in which Ajax single-handed saved the  fleet, Hector succeeded in grasping the ship of Protesilaus and called  loud for fire. This was the greatest measure of success vouchsafed  him; from this point onwards the balance was redressed in favour of the  Greeks.    Achilles had been watching the anguish of Patroclus' spirit when this  disaster came upon their friends.        \"Why weepest thou, Patroclus, like some prattling little child who      runneth to her mother and biddeth her take her up, catching at her      garment and checking her movement and gazing at her tearfully till      she lifteth her? Even so thou lettest fall the big tears.\"    Patroclus begged his friend to allow him to wear his armour and lead the  Myrmidons out to battle, not knowing that he was entreating for his own  ruin and death. After some reluctance Achilles gave him leave, yet with  the strictest orders not to pursue too far. Fresh and eager for the  battle the Myrmidons drove the Trojans back into the plain. Patroclus'  course was challenged by the Lycians, whose King Sarpedon faced him in  single combat. In great sorrow Zeus watched his son Sarpedon go to his  doom; in his agony he shed tear-drops of blood and ordered Death and  Sleep to carry the body back to Lycia for burial.    The great glory Patroclus had won tempted him to forget his promise to  Achilles. He pursued the Trojans back to the walls of the town, slaying  Cebriones the charioteer of Hector. In the fight which took place  over the body Patroclus was assailed by Hector and Euphorbus under the  guidance of Apollo. Hector administered the death-blow; before he died  Patroclus foretold a speedy vengeance to come from Achilles.    A mighty struggle arose over his body. Menelaus slew Euphorbus, but  retreated at the approach of Hector, who seized the armour of Achilles  and put it on. A thick cloud settled over the combatants, heightening  the dread of battle. The gods came down to encourage their respective  warriors; the Greeks were thrust back over the plain, but the bravery of  Ajax and Menelaus enabled the latter to save Patroclus' body and carry  it from the dust of battle towards the ships.    When the news of his friend's death came to Achilles his grief was so  mighty that it seemed likely that he would have slain himself. He burst  into a lamentation so bitter that his mother heard him in her sea-cave  and came forth to learn what new sorrow had taken him. Too late he  learned the hard lesson that revenge may be sweet but is always bought  at the cost of some far greater thing.        \"I could not bring salvation to Patroclus or my men, but sit at the      ships a useless burden upon the land, albeit I am such a man as no      other in war, though others excel me in speech. Perish strife from      among men and gods, and anger which inciteth even a prudent man to      take offence; far sweeter than dropping honey it groweth in a man's      heart like smoke, even now as Agamemnon hath roused me to a fury.\"    Being robbed of his armour he could not sally out to convey his  companion's body into the camp. Hera therefore sent Iris to him bidding  him merely show himself at the trenches and cry aloud. At the sound of  his thrice-repeated cry the Trojans shrank back in terror, leaving the  Greeks to carry in Patroclus' body unmolested; then Hera bade the sun  set at once into the ocean to end the great day of battle.    Polydamas knew well what the appearance of Achilles portended to the  Trojans, for he was the one man among them who could look both before  and after; his advice was that they should retire into the town and  there shut themselves up. It was received with scorn by Hector. In the  Greek camp Achilles burst into a wild lament over Patroclus, swearing  that he would not bury him before he had brought in Hector dead and  twelve living captives to sacrifice before the pyre. That night his  mother went to Hephaestus and persuaded him to make divine armour for  her son, which the poet describes in detail.    On receiving the armour from his mother Achilles made haste to reconcile  himself with Agamemnon. His impatience for revenge and the oath he had  taken made it impossible for him to take any food. His strength was  maintained by Athena who supplied him with nectar. On issuing forth to  the fight he addressed his two horses:        \"Xanthus and Balius, bethink you how ye may save your charioteer      when he hath done with the battle, and desert him not in death as      ye did Patroclus.\"    In reply they prophesied his coming end.        \"For this we are not to blame, but the mighty god--and violent Fate.      We can run quick as the breath of the North wind, who men say is      the swiftest of all, but thy fate it is to die by the might of a      god and a man.\"    The Avenging Spirits forbade them to reveal more. The awe of the climax  of the poem is heightened by supernatural interventions. At last the  gods themselves received permission from Zeus to enter the fray. They  took sides, the shock of their meeting causing the nether deity to  start from his throne in fear that his realm should collapse about him.  Achilles met Aeneas and would have slain him had not Poseidon saved him.  Hector withdrew before him, warned by Apollo not to meet him face to  face. Disregarding the god's advice he attacked Achilles, but for the  moment was spirited away. Disappointed of his prey Achilles sowed havoc  among the lesser Trojans.    Choked by the numerous corpses the River-God Scamander begged him cease  his work of destruction. When the Hero disregarded him, he assembled all  his waters and would have overwhelmed him but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8129"],[0,"A Dreamer's Tales (#4)"],[1,"trouble between the man  and his soul, for his soul would not let him be, but went on reproaching  him.    \"Then the man saw me and said, 'This at least will not fail me.' When I  heard him say this about me, I determined that whatever he might require  of me it should be done to the uttermost. And as I made this determination  in my unfaltering heart, he picked me up and stood on an empty box that I  should have bound on the morrow, and tied one end of me to a dark rafter;  and the knot was carelessly tied, because his soul was reproaching him all  the while continually and giving him no ease. Then he made the other end  of me into a noose, but when the man's soul saw this it stopped  reproaching the man, and cried out to him hurriedly, and besought him to  be at peace with it and to do nothing sudden; but the man went on with his  work, and put the noose down over his face and underneath his chin, and  the soul screamed horribly.    \"Then the man kicked the box away with his foot, and the moment he did  this I knew that my strength was not great enough to hold him; but I  remembered that he had said I would not fail him, and I put all my grim  vigour into my fibres and held by sheer will. Then the soul shouted to me  to give way, but I said:    \"'No; you vexed the man.'    \"Then it screamed for me to leave go of the rafter, and already I was  slipping, for I only held on to it by a careless knot, but I gripped with  my prison grip and said:    \"'You vexed the man.'    \"And very swiftly it said other things to me, but I answered not; and at  last the soul that vexed the man that had trusted me flew away and left  him at peace. I was never able to bind things any more, for every one of  my fibres was worn and wrenched, and even my relentless heart was weakened  by the struggle. Very soon afterwards I was thrown out here. I have done  my work.\"    So they spoke among themselves, but all the while there loomed above them  the form of an old rocking-horse complaining bitterly. He said: \"I am  Blagdaross. Woe is me that I should lie now an outcast among these worthy  but little people. Alas! for the days that are gathered, and alas for the  Great One that was a master and a soul to me, whose spirit is now shrunken  and can never know me again, and no more ride abroad on knightly quests. I  was Bucephalus when he was Alexander, and carried him victorious as far as  Ind. I encountered dragons with him when he was St. George, I was the  horse of Roland fighting for Christendom, and was often Rosinante. I  fought in tournays and went errant upon quests, and met Ulysses and the  heroes and the fairies. Or late in the evening, just before the lamps in  the nursery were put out, he would suddenly mount me, and we would gallop  through Africa. There we would pass by night through tropic forests, and  come upon dark rivers sweeping by, all gleaming with the eyes of  crocodiles, where the hippopotamus floated down with the stream, and  mysterious craft loomed suddenly out of the dark and furtively passed  away. And when we had passed through the forest lit by the fireflies we  would come to the open plains, and gallop onwards with scarlet flamingoes  flying along beside us through the lands of dusky kings, with golden  crowns upon their heads and scepters in their hands, who came running out  of their palaces to see us pass. Then I would wheel suddenly, and the dust  flew up from my four hooves as I turned and we galloped home again, and my  master was put to bed. And again he would ride abroad on another day till  we came to magical fortresses guarded by wizardry and overthrew the  dragons at the gate, and ever came back with a princess fairer than the  sea.    \"But my master began to grow larger in his body and smaller in his soul,  and then he rode more seldom upon quests. At last he saw gold and never  came again, and I was cast out here among these little people.\"    But while the rocking-horse was speaking two boys stole away, unnoticed by  their parents, from a house on the edge of the waste place, and were  coming across it looking for adventures. One of them carried a broom, and  when he saw the rocking-horse he said nothing, but broke off the handle  from the broom and thrust it between his braces and his shirt on the left  side. Then he mounted the rocking-horse, and drawing forth the broomstick,  which was sharp and spiky at the end, said, \"Saladin is in this desert  with all his paynims, and I am Coeur de Lion.\" After a while the other boy  said: \"Now let me kill Saladin too.\" But Blagdaross in his wooden heart,  that exulted with thoughts of battle, said: \"I am Blagdaross yet!\"          THE MADNESS OF ANDELSPRUTZ      I first saw the city of Andelsprutz on an afternoon in spring. The day was  full of sunshine as I came by the way of the fields, and all that morning  I had said, \"There will be sunlight on it when I see for the first time  the beautiful conquered city whose fame has so often made for me lovely  dreams.\" Suddenly I saw its fortifications lifting out of the fields, and  behind them stood its belfries. I went in by a gate and saw its houses and  streets, and a great disappointment came upon me. For there is an air  about a city, and it has a way with it, whereby a man may recognized one  from another at once. There are cities full of happiness and cities full  of pleasure, and cities full of gloom. There are cities with their faces  to heaven, and some with their faces to earth; some have a way of looking  at the past and others look at the future; some notice you if you come  among them, others glance at you, others let you go by. Some love the  cities that are their neighbours, others are dear to the plains and to the  heath; some cities are bare to the wind, others have purple cloaks and  others brown cloaks, and some are clad in white. Some tell the old tale of  their infancy, with others it is secret; some cities sing and some mutter,  some are angry, and some have broken hearts, and each city has her way of  greeting Time.    I had said: \"I will see Andelsprutz arrogant with her beauty,\" and I had  said: \"I will see her weeping over her conquest.\"    I had said: \"She will sing songs to me,\" and \"she will be reticent,\" \"she  will be all robed,\" and \"she will be bare but splendid.\"    But the windows of Andelsprutz in her houses looked vacantly over the  plains like the eyes of a dead madman. At the hour her chimes sounded  unlovely and discordant, some of them were out of tune, and the bells of  some were cracked, her roofs were bald and without moss. At evening no  pleasant rumour arose in her streets. When the lamps were lit in the  houses no mystical flood of light stole out into the dusk, you merely saw  that there were lighted lamps; Andelsprutz had no way with her and no air  about her. When the night fell and the blinds were all drawn down, then I  perceived what I had not thought in the daylight. I knew then that  Andelsprutz was dead.    I saw a fair-haired man who drank beer in a cafe, and I said to him:    \"Why is the city of Andelsprutz quite dead, and her soul gone hence?\"    He answered: \"Cities do not have souls and there is never any life in  bricks.\"    And I said to him: \"Sir, you have spoken truly.\"    And I asked the same question of another man, and he gave me the same  answer, and I thanked him for his courtesy. And I saw a man of a more  slender build, who had black hair, and channels in his cheeks for tears to  run in, and I said to him:    \"Why is Andelsprutz quite dead, and when did her soul go hence?\"    And he answered: \"Andelsprutz hoped too much. For thirty years would she  stretch out her arms toward the land of Akla every night, to Mother Akla  from whom she had been stolen. Every night she would be hoping and  sighing, and stretching out her arms to Mother Akla. At midnight, once a  year, on the anniversary of the terrible day, Akla would send spies to lay  a wreath against the walls of Andelsprutz. She could do no more. And on  this night, once in every year, I used to weep, for weeping was the mood  of the city that nursed me. Every night while other cities slept did  Andelsprutz sit brooding here and hoping, till thirty wreaths lay  mouldering by her walls, and still the armies of Akla could not come.    \"But after she had hoped so long, and on the night that faithful spies had  brought her thirtieth wreath, Andelsprutz went suddenly mad. All the bells  clanged hideously in the belfries, horses bolted in the streets, the dogs  all howled, the stolid conquerors awoke and turned in their beds and slept  again; and I saw the grey shadowy form of Andelsprutz rise up, decking her  hair with the phantasms of cathedrals, and stride away from her city. And  the great shadowy form that was the soul of Andelsprutz went away  muttering to the mountains, and there I followed her--for had she not been  my nurse? Yes, I went away alone into the mountains, and for three days,  wrapped in a cloak, I slept in their misty solitudes. I had no food to  eat, and to drink I had only the water of the mountain streams. By day no  living thing was near to me, and I heard nothing but the noise of the  wind, and the mountain streams roaring. But for three nights I heard all  round me on the mountain the sounds of a great city: I saw the lights of  tall cathedral windows flash momentarily on the peaks, and at times the  glimmering lantern of some fortress patrol. And I saw the huge misty  outline of the soul of Andelsprutz sitting decked with her ghostly  cathedrals, speaking to herself, with her eyes fixed before her in a mad  stare, telling of ancient wars. And her confused speech for all those  nights upon the mountain was sometimes the voice of traffic, and then of  church bells, and then of bugles, but oftenest it was the voice of red  war; and it was all incoherent, and she was quite mad.    \"The third night it rained heavily all night long, but I stayed up there  to watch"]]]
